I swear I saw the comments 666 when I read it
For stewed apples, you don’t need to boil the apples.\n\nI just cut apple into quarters (using apple cutter which takes the core away)\nPut in MICROWAVE for around 5-8 mins (depending on amount of apples. 4 apples = around 8 mins.) \n\nWallah!
This man sounds like a robot

I clicked on this video because I thought it was a hack.\n\nNope.

No I wouldn't eat an apple like that because I don't like apples.
What's so special about these? I've done these before..
D don't you know gods of death love apples
No sir I would rather eat a regular apple
My best friend eats apples like that.
There is no such thing as too much topping when it comes to a crumble.
Next time add a bit of butter on top aswell, it will golden the crumble
I hate the music this is in every tutorial
well done to this *_3 dimensional carbon based life form_* for achievement thy art of the \n\n*_APPLE CRUMBLE_*

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk

Pause and read the whole thing OH MY GOD HDNDNFNV
Suddenly he wasn't so sad about Dumbledore fucking dying.
Never thought the day would come where I would unsubscribe from jacksfilms :’( been subscribed since 2013 big big fan but I think I’ve just become older and have grown bored of yiay’s like it’s nearly all you do now, love you and big respect! Goodluck with your future
My eyes have leaked thousands of tears. Reminded me of everything I read.
The part about Voldemort trying to kill baby Harry was the best.
you forgot fred you fksajfasjfksjakfjlkasfjksafj\n:'(\n\nor maybe it was george i dunno
I feel like the true goal of the Jacksfilms channel is to utterly destroy the Harry Potter saga for everyone. Luckily I never read them soooo...
The snake dun got 'im good. Damn, belched Harry\n\nHermione didn't do a damn thing, the bitch. \n\nBlimey! said Ron, eating. \n\nNo clothes in Heaven, he whispered. How wonderful. The thought of a Heaven with no clothes delighted Harry. Suddenly he wasn't so sad about Dumbledore fucking dying.\n\nJub Jub want rub rub, Jub Jub whispered.  Jub Jub want rub rub, whimpered Jub Jub, shedding a single tear. \n\nGive us a kiss, smiled Jub Jub.\n\nThe cup... It was a portkey! said Cedric. No shit! said Harry. Try to keep up, dumbass. \n\nWow I'm really evil, thought Voldemort, evilly. Like, really really evil. I'm finna kill an infant. That's messed up. Dang. I should take a good, long look in the mirror. Nah I'ma kill this kid. He did lol\n\nAnd with that, arrowed-Harry went limp in healthy-Harry's arms. Healthy-Harry cried out to the heavens, but his anguish fell on deaf ears. He would have to continue alone. Jub Jub wants rub rub, said Jub Jub. \n\nI can't possibly be the only person that noticed this right?
I'm still waiting for the Marauder Era movie
He's back. Hey it's boy mcfacto
Pause at 2:51 and read
what the fuck did I just watch, jack
Sorry, but these jokes just didn't hit for me
Is this an actual book ? If so, what is It called ?
Did he just change the thumbnail? Or am i the only one​ that saw it
Who else read the whole pages in the video?
Hmmmmm, this must be the manga...
Ahh, those pages gave me such a nostlgia(critic now on channel awesome, green lantern is now on. watch it now for 9,99) trip. I remember it just like it was, it makes me want to read the books all over again.
The fuck did I just watch?
1:05 \nEehhhh.... Am I the only one or does Jub Jub looks like Squidward? Because dammm that's a great Squid!
I cried for 8 years because of this video. 😢
I think I saw another video by you about the Emoji movie which I couldn't figure out if you were serious about it or not, yet I think you where and this cringy as fuck video tells me that much, please stop.
Is there a full story he's reading lines from? If so, link please.
*TOP TEN THOTS OF ALL TIME*
The snake dun got 'im good - JK Rowling
WTF. Comprehension on the other side...
Dumbledore was arguably a character in the books \nYes Jack I believe he was
Bullshit! I don't care if this is comedy, Dobby's death should be #1
Oh dear!!!\nNeither does RON nor does HARRY DIES in this original series...
What happened to the thumbnail?
Spoilers for a book series that's over a decade old, with a movie franchise that ended maybe 5 years ago. Yes, definitely worthy of a spoiler warning
I can no longer call Dumbledore Dumbledore, he is always Dumblecunt.
“That snake dun got ‘im good.\n“Damn,” belched Harry.”\nMan I can’t believe I forgot this beautifully written, emotionally driven part after Snape died. I really need to reread these books.
Looks like Harry was giving Jub Jub a handjoby
There's no cloth in heaven  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Suddenly he wasn't so sad about dumbledore fucking dying.
Dumbledore's death: /Last Sentence/ Suddenly, Harry wasn't so sad about Dumbledore fucking dying.
One of your best lmfao
Jack I still ironically dab and I see you do too but I think it's for the best if we both stop embarassing ourselves and find a new cringey dance move
Let me lick you clean boy.\n\n~???
Let me lick you clean, boy. I wouldn't be surprised if Sirius said that in canon at some point.
I literally died when you said a ham. Literally. I was eating a $1 cheeseburger from Hungry Jack's and choked to death. My last words were boy-oh-boy that's some throat-clogging value.
God I'm dumb af I thought this was legit until he got all the way to Ron
(quote from video)\nloL Xddddd\n\nwhere are my likes
Someone changed the thumbnail... \nVery naughty John.
I kept waiting for an ad for Harry's Razors to show up
Is this a joke?...
This is shite!! Not funny at all.
Best video in years,  10 out of 10 would project this video on jacks forehead.
I thought Jub Jub died in book 2.
Huh? Anyone else lost because they haven't read the book they just watched the movie and you're like  Harry Potter died?  tell me I'm not the only one plz.
Umm idk if this is real but it funny
I'm happy now
Hermione didn't do a thing... That bitch 😒
The thought of a Heaven with no clothes delighted harry. Suddenly he wasn’t so sad about Dumbledore fucking dying\n\nJk Rowling is a genius
Im halfway through watching the Harry Potter movies and Jub Jub still hasn’t made an appearance??? When does he come into the story??
Watch mojo in a nutshell
You you small girl
jk rowling more like jgay rowling
These deaths hit harder then my bully in middle school
im taking a shit rn and i feel wrong watching this while i shit.
Give us a kiss said Jub Jub
Is this true?
Dobby... more like 🔥DABBY🔥
is the Lt.general running for president..... very well spoken.... realistic.
Trump can truly learn a lot from his leadership
In the marines, it didn't matter what race you were. They treated everyone like shit. This is just another reason why USAF is a joke lol.
Like they said in the movie everyone is equally worthless  had a drill Instructor that preached that before that movie was made when some issues happened in the barracks
White people are racist. No white person has gone through life not THINKING about black people as lesser people, Idc what anyone says. In 2017 all I've seen is nigger this, niggers that, blacks  that. It's the way it is. You think white people as a majority will respect us? LOL TRY AGAIN. We will be hated until the end of time. Satan or somebody else has brainwashed certain people into that way of dominance. All it takes is the color of your skin. You can't get rid of racism. You can get them to eliminate a certain aspect of it, but we will ALWAYS be viewed as less. You can get mad, I don't care. Racism dates back to when? And what year is it now? And we're still having the same discrimination going on. These little speeches do nothing to those who just hate. Some of your favorite youtubers have most likely done or said something racist. But the world is gonna continue to move forward regardless. Start ignoring it and stop being shocked that these speeches have to happen. People who even work for our country are racist. Without racism, there'd be no elite race. And white people aren't gonna let that happen, think about it. Waste. Of. Time.
Waaaaaa some nigger got offended waaaaaaaa except I bet the blacks weren't as bothered by this as were the pussy self hating guilty white sellouts
Love how liberals wanna put something like this on trending but as soon as they found out that the church shooter in Tennessee who shot up all those elderly people was black they stopped reporting about it. Typical democrats always acting like black people are victims all the time. This isn’t true equality.
What an incredibly powerful speech. God bless this man.
True leader. Not too powerful. Not too much. Definitely not too less. Straight to the point and executed it gloriously
they censored my response to this democratic party hack
This man for president
We are the men and women of the United States Military and we do not tolerate such things among our ranks.
Bravo! What a great leader. There may be hope for America after all9
BAD GOYS! Now go die for Israel.
Good story bro but the demographics of the air force tells the tale.
I believe this is setup, until I see video I think this is bullshit, especially since he brought up Ferguson and so on. BULLSHIT PROPAGANDA
That was legit like something out of a movie! Very powerful speech!
Who gives a fuck
What exactly happened? What was written? 😳
That is the proper response.    I admire real leadership no matter what your color is..this is what you call a real man. #Salute
That's a really white crowd in attendance.\n\n....Just sayin'
Ironic how you can't treat those with a different viewpoint than your own with dignity and respect, while you preach about diversity. Time to get out Jay?
this was blown out of proportion some post the n word online and you need to make a fucking speech about grow thicker skin what a over reaction way to escalate things
This is how Trump should address the racists that we have in the U. S. Of course he won't, because most them voted for him
I would have smoked the shit out of them...Push up the earth..
He is red 3rd degree hot burning upset and I don't blame him I salute you sir amen
That's a true American
It's like we are in an inescapable high school. Don't need a lecture, drones on and on.  Most people feel this way already. True racists will be unfazed by this
Please don't interpret this a bigotry, but I just want to ask if there is another side to this story?  I don't approve of racism, but I find it hard to believe we have just reverted back to 1960s mindset without provocations.  This kind of thing wasn't common in the 90s or 2000s, but why now.  I'm not approving of bigotry in any form, but I'm just trying to form an open mind and get the facts.
This kind of Leadership we need to help the weak
I feel like a special snowflake  after listening to this..thankyou.
Black people are overrated. They really aren't that great.
wow so brave. such valor. i can only imagine the horror in isis ranks from the diversity of the usaf
What a hero. Give him the highest medal possible.
You people saw a man run his car into a group of walking protesters, but you are aghast that racism may exist in the Military? In this country?SHOCK, OUTRAGE, OH LORDY.
I guarantee this racist language was a fucking hoax just like most of them have been found to be.  I'd like to see what it actually said.  This is beyond virtue signaling.  I guarantee if it was something racist to a white person he wouldn't give two shits.  Air Force recruitment 101 happening right here.
What a LOSER!!!! He wants to talk about FERGUSON and the protests within the NFL??? Okay.... Michael Brown was a CRIMINAL NEGRO who RIGHTFULLY GOT HIS ASS SHOT!! And nobody CARES what message some LOSER NFL PLAYER thinks about police treatment of NEGROES or their thoughts on the N. Korean missile crisis. If the NEGROES wouldn't be STEALING STUFF, the POLICE WOULDNT SHOW UP IN THE FIRST PLACE. And if NEGROES would COOPERATE WITH POLICE, they wouldn't GET THEIR ASSES SHOT, you MORON!!!
It is scary garbage like that seems to go through the filter and get into powerful positions. Those people become doctors, lawyers, police officers. Truly scary. Good on this Lt. on addressing the situation. Ignorance and small thinking only hurts this country.
Good talk. Good talk. Now only if you were half the man you sound like when you talk...
people like him should run our country
This is a real man and he would kick Donald Trump's racist draft-dodging ass.
This is the kind of cucking America needs! Silveria 2020!!
the fault is the racism of Trump. it was over untl him.
Thank you for that. See? Leadership.
Blacks are taught to play the victim card from the time they can walk; They consider race in EVERY incident - and are encouraged to hunt for racism under every rock.\nWake Up Lt. General!😂
Why can't we have someone like this man run our country..  Well spoken words and i have amazing respect for this man.
Diversity is for salads, for to have diversity for the sake of it, is just as bad as racism, Inclution of the best to do the job is what needed
I wish he was our president.
Who cares who said it, if it was a black or white or Hispanic, as long as racism is shut down. That's all you need to worry and know about.
That's what's up! I SALUTE YOU🛠
As an air force vet. I am proud of this speech.
Damn, I guess that's why he's a Lieutenant General.
Wow.  I feel little emembrass.  For sone reason I thought this video would be racist.  I was rotallt wrong.  Just another reminder don't judge somthing by it cover.
This guy is a better leader then retarded trump... Impeach that orange dumbass....
He would be a Great president.
This is a true leader.  How in God's name did something like trump become president?
That took guts and balls. Good for him
Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria for president! I am not even American. Eh.
General, sir.  Will you be my President some day?  Mkay thanks.  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Everyone is a little racist. Anyone who says otherwise is wrong and a liar.
White Trash will be white trash.  It's genetic.  They can't help themselves.  They can't resist using racial slurs  as  much as a dog can't resist barking.  Keep barking Pale Supremacy.
Does that apply to Transgender people as well or do you want them to just get out? You better be prepared to treat everyone fairly and equally. You going to take a stand for ALL people? I sure hope so.
Imagine if he was the one that made the racial slurs but he is blaming it on the cadets that would be funny.
why can our usaf general make a speech like this?
Very good! Dignity and respect for ALL races period! We ALL bleed red! God bless the USA! 🇺🇸
Political correct, my nigga.
Lt. Gen Silveria, God Bless YOU!!!
👏✈🇺🇸
THANK YOU!!!
Moving. Unifying. Courageous. Right. Bravo!
What a whiney tirade.
Its 4chan they were larping

Gay speech
Not only get out, but fuck off and die.
Diversity creates weakness, not strength.  Even liberal social scientist Robert Putnam had to admit such in Bowling Alone.
Trump and his racist supporters are dividing America
Dude who gives a fuck rly our Air Force is having a racial problem and getting lectured like a middle school when somebody writes shit in the bathroom shouldn't they b like solving bigger problems like genocide poverty or fucking imminent war?
Someone wrote some naughty words?
niggers
All my respect Sir !!!!  A true American values!  You are a HERO !!!!    Run for president you are a leader!! We need you here !!!!!!!!!!!!
As a former NAPSter (Naval Academy Preparatory School student), I cannot imagine the the horror those four AFAPS students felt waking up to messages of hate from within their own ranks. However, I can tell you that the response by Lt. Gen Silveria makes me proud to know that ALL of those young men and women have a true leader who values diversity and integrity and unity. I sincerely hope and pray that the cowards who wrote the vile messages are caught, charged with violating the UCMJ, and expelled from the AFAPS or the Academy.
This song is so addicting. ❤
Sam is back 🙌🏼🙌🏼
i notice the background singers are always black. must be black=good voice

Lyrics: You must think that I’m stupid You must think that I’m a fool You must think that I’m new to this But I have seen this all before I’m never going to let you close to me Even though you mean the most to me 'Cause every time I open up it hurts So I’m never going to get too close to you Even when I mean the most to you In case you go and leave me in the dirt But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry And every time you walk out, the less I love you Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes) I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes) No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry) I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes) I know you’re thinking I’m heartless I know you’re thinking I’m cold I’m just protecting my innocence I’m just protecting my soul I’m never going to let you close to me Even though you mean the most to me ‘Cause every time I open up it hurts So I’m never going to get too close to you Even when I mean the most to you In case you go and leave me in the dirt But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry And every time you walk out, the less I love you Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes) I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes) No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry) I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes) No... (I’m way too good at goodbyes) (I’m way too good at goodbyes) (No way that you’ll see me cry) Oh... (I’m way too good at goodbyes) ‘Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry And every time you walk out, the less I love you Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true I’m way too good at goodbyes
SAM'S ALWAYS BEEN BETTER LIVE <3
It will be a masterpiece..
Sam Smith is the most pure and genuine artist/singer, ever. You can feel everything he feels every time he sings. His voice never gets tiring. I love everything about him to his music. A legend. I love you Sam Smith.
Everytime you walk out the, less i love you😭😭
Beautiful Sam, l hope this did not come from another bad relationship for you, If anyone wants to know Sam even sounds better in his concert
sad but this sums my marriage
Black people are music magic
Just after a break up. This song hits hard.
ugh he’s so good . and this song hits home . amazing
better than the original he ate his own audio wow
He skinny af
Sam's voice is out of this world. He looks amazing with the weight loss. He's overall a lovely person and his songs tug on your heartstrings like no one else but man, he needs a new stylist. I hope he's not attached to that shirt because it needs to be buried far far away.
Man he looks so different
Don't go messing up your talent and your life on senseless drugs and partying - you have a gift to share, share it well and help those in need vs wasting it.  Beautiful voice be a beautiful person and live long and happy.
WHO IS SAM SMITH?
He may not be fat anymore but he still dresses like a fat guy.
Is this the original or live??! Damn Sam !! Slaying
he look like a snack here
This is what pure talent is
When the camera zooms out a bit, he looks like Mac Miller
Wow, how can such a beautiful song mark the end of my courtship?! Unforgettable...
Im too food at middle finger
....This song touched me in a way.... that I haven't been touched since my gym teacher in middle school....
Most singers don't sound great live but boy he does
His voice is amazing.
I'm way too good at getting high.... 🙃🙃
I love this, I love him and I love that shirt
Wait this is LIVE???? oh wow it is exactly the same as the studio version.... Love it!!!
his voice is so pure <3
Love him so much

how long before this guy deals with Child protective services
Still doesn't beat the Roman Atwood's prank where he  throws the baby a floor down while playing
We’re gonna see news headlines of parents injuring their kids cause of this 😂
What happens when mommy is gone for the weekend.
Dad of the year
Man this is weak my dad used to throw me at our metal fan for a warm up then topple me over furniture
Good lord that little kid beat the crap out of that giant buffoon! But he hardly even tried. It’s almost as if he let him win.... hmmm I knew wrestling was fake.
Second second waiting to be a shooting star meme when the kid is flying and his hair is floating it would be a good shooting star meme
Stupid and gay I want blood!
lol OMG this was great. I'm doing this with my daughter.
This is what happens when you leave your kid alone with the dad 😂\n\nWhat all moms are thinking: This play fighting is gonna end up with a real busted lip 😉 (lets them do it anyway)
Expected bunch of bad vibe comments. I'm surprised. Good job everyone 🤗👏.
That’s the kind of father I’m trying to be
If this makes it to FB you can guarantee it's going to trigger the hell out of some highly strung earth mother sorts.  Which automatically earns it a thumbs up from me. 👍
Pick on someone your own size!
Ooh, not the fac-- OH MY GO-- THAT MAN IS BROKEN IN HALF!
next wwe champion, like this comment if u agree
More entertaining than current wwe product.
I remember doing this with my dad
Amazing lol. Make a money in the bank video next..
I saw your video a year ago and I thought this guy isn't for real but you were
I don’t want to have kids. But this is the reason I want a son!
This is the YouTube I miss
Dad of the year
When you love your kid... ❤️
That spear was good
haha! this reminded me of when i had my kid...i usedd to push all the pillows up to the headboard and chuck him into the pile from across the room...he would laugh and laugh! then his mother decided to pull a knife on me spit in my face and take me to court and divorced me got a long term protection order againts me and i havent seen him in over eight years.....and i hope i never do if it means seeing that retarded witch....but yeah bed wrestling is awesome! i havent been on a date in eight years either.....true story...i now live with my 80 something year old grandparents and we party like its $19.95....and it might be...i dont need no stinking love! my last name is love...im maxed out for life! beeyatch! she can try to steal my name but....im the real mack....shes just another nut been cracked....dont worry girl...grown men never cry unless a hero dies...and im the hero so....i dont cry...i barely even say ouch. suckah.
when mom isn't home 😂😂
What happens when you leave Dad alone with the kids ...
My most fond memories of my son and I were wrasslin' on the bed when he was a toddler!  Priceless.
U know how YouTube is
When moms away and dad is left in charge
This guy only has 4 videos in his channel and he posts each one on 9/30. He hasn't broken that habit for 4 years now. I guess that makes him... dedicated?
Wrestling from 2009 - 2017 is unwatchable and boring as shit.
Time for a German suplex 😂
Hahaha Fuck yeah!\n\nThis people = Is why you don't bastard your children, because they're awesome!\n\nMake that shit work!
Aha, I watched the video before reading the title and I was so confused why this man was body slamming this child
Great way to get hurt.
Fake just like WWE I love it!!!
OKAY SO WHEN SOMEONE GETS HURT WE CAN SUE THEM?
Remember when wrestling was for young adults(with the bloody matches in attitude era) this is depressing to realize how low wwe has got into
Hahaha just did a video like this a few months ago. This is awesome
Dad to the bone.\n\nThese videos are going to be amazing if that kid becomes a wrestling star one day.
I want to see kid do a Stone Cold stunner.
This is some great stuff. Straight quality time!
BAH GAWD HE NEARLY BROKE HIM IN HALF WITH THAT LEG DROP OFF THE LADDER
This is awesome !! This made my Saturday watched all series and each everyone are a classic. Especially  the RKO !!

Subscribe for free mints!
This guy posting 20 sec. videos ONCE A YEAR... That's more akward.
This will stop when the big dumbass gets the little dumbass hurt 😂😂😂
YO!! You are on to something huge here. Capitalize on this idea. Lots of wrestling fans out there. All big time YouTubers start small with a basic camera. Get creative this could be your ticket.
There needs to be more of these!
Anyone else here because they don't know what to watch so they just went to trending?
This shit weak I rko my 5yr old threw a burning table
:04. Reported for sexual child abuse. I see the judge giving 20-25 years easy.

섹스
와
확실히 조쉬도 긴장한게 느껴지고 또 영국남자 특유의 인터뷰느낌이 아니라 제한적이고 격식화된 인터뷰라 아쉽긴 했지만 전에 에릭남이 그랬나? 한밤같은데서 리포터 자격으로 가도 5분 10분밖에 안주고 시간도 엄수해야하고 여러모로 제약이 많다고 들었어요 그쪽 시스템상 어쩔수 없는 부분이겠죠..\n그래도 개인 유튭채널이 아시아에서 유일한 매체로 선정된거라니 축하해요 잘봤습니다!
콜린퍼스는 우리 아빠 정장 입어도 멋있을거야 밑단이 좀 짧겠지만

*WUT THE HELL IS ALL THESE DAMN SQUIGGLY LINES ALL BOUT!!?? This is MURRICA, SPEAK MURRICAN DAGNABBIT!!!*
what ?????? \nDodie you is 100/10
This reminded me a bit of the dance in The OA
You won't like this comment, you may even consider it to be a hateful comment, it is not, it's just my concern. \nConcern of the person who's also struggling with depression and anxiety, who takes medication and who has problem to get up in the mornings. Oh and that sweet time my friends came to my home to tell my mom I'm suicidal, or that time I had to be taken by emergency car to the hospital because my panic attack wouldn't stop after an hour of shaking.\n\nAnyway. I know what it's like so what makes me different? I'd say my age, I'm much older than the average of dodie's fans and I want to warn you kids, and yes kids, even you 16-17 years old, you're kids, trust me. You are impressionable, in a desperate need to find your place in this world, you're lost, you're unpopular, you're sad, you spend too much time on youtube and tumblr. And then there's dodie, a young artist singing about your feelings and you feel like there's more of you, like you belong. Belong to this club of special snowflakes, of a club of depressed. You know how many of you are actually depressed? Maybe a half, I'd say a third. I am not dismissing your illness. If you're struggling with depression, please go see a doctor, ask your mom, ask your family for help, ask at school, call the help number, don't suffer on the internet, get help first.\n\nIf you're sad, you may not feel sad in a short period of time, it is okay to feel sad and lost but sad is not the same as depression. You want to be included to some group because people do this, we want to feel we are in a group, this group will protect us. And you chose to be in this club of pretty depressed people because you're sad and you feel like you belong. \n\nDodie did a very brave move when she started to talk about her illness, however she made a huge mistake by glamorizing the illness. There's nothing pretty about depression. There's nothing pretty in tears, in fears, in struggling to feel happiness. It's scary and lonely and even I wear my brightest lipstick on my bad days and I go out with my friends. But I do not promote a pretty depression. What we see with dodie is a pretty skinny girl, surrounded by friends, fans, art, beautiful fashion, aesthetic style and quirky smiling instagram posts. Those are her coping mechanisms and believe me I understand and I try those but you know what it also does? It promotes depression as something pretty, as something worth to have because with depression you can be like dodie, you can be pretty, you can be in this club of misunderstood very very sad people and that's wrong.\n\nDepression should to be warned about and spoke about but the last thing this illness has to be is to be promoted and never ever glamorized.\n\nI'm sorry, dodie, but it got out of hand and seems like you attract people to be depressed to be like you and those are impressionable young people who want to follow and they do follow and it's so wrong to make a mental illness your brand... it's low to make money of a brand like this.\n\nI am sorry to anyone who read this whole comment, call it hate, I don't mind, I think a bit of awareness and new opinion was needed and I really hope those of you who are ill will find your way to heal and those of you who are temporally sad will shortly get to their bright days again but I really ask you not to fall down this rabbit hole of depression just to feel special, thank you.
I don't think 6/10 is supposed to represent how attractive she is but rather how she fells mentally... I don't know
This was so beautiful, thank you.
oh my god this is beautiful
My friend is boring. She feels like a 5/10 not a 6. I feel sad for her. I want to unlock her potential. But im not qualified to.
this is so beautiful, i’m in awe
This is one of the most beautiful music videos I have ever seen.
this is so beautiful
When will this air on radio
Sammy did such a good job.
this is so so so beautiful and captures a feeling I and so many people know so well. thank you for once again sharing your art with us Dodie and Sammy.
I can’t actually handle my existence oh lord qlidiis
I’m not crying there’s just a 2011 attack helicopter in my eye
im disappointed that this barely has half a mil views in a day, deserves a full solid million :(
Thank you for this dodie
This genuinely made me cry and I never cry 😢
Dodie and Sammy once again you melt my heart and make me cry. Beautiful work guys x
DODIE I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART, SAMMY PAUL I ASPIRE TO BE LIKE YOU IN THE FUTURE
This is actual art I love it so dearly
Your a 10/10 to me
this was - wow - so very powerful and i don't really know how to say it properly, but i am touched by this little piece of art 💞
Ohhh so she thinks it's just her and she feels so isolated and sad but everyone is going through the same thing deep down.   \n\n\nI've watched it 14 times.
That was heavy and wonderful and all the things
Dodie, you are so pure, beautiful, and inspiring, what did we do to deserve you?!? Thankyou for all the art you create for us, we love you 💛💛💛 And Sammy, you did such an amazing job at directing this video, it's beautiful 😍😍😍
Idk why but this video made the song more emotional. Yeah it’s short but to be fair it’s absolutely beautiful.
Oh my god this is amazing
Was she wearing a zoella lifestyle at the stairs lol, love this video so much 💙💙💙💙
Is it just me not seeing it but.... why do all of their shoulders hurt?
I’m really confused do they all have a bad shoulder? Or are they trying to stop dancing?
WAIT I STILL DONT GET IT. WHY DO THEY KEEP LIFTING THEIR HANDS?
I think a Thousand Dodies just ripped my heart out and cuddled it to death
I fell in love with this song so much more with this video!
such a beautiful work of art 😭
I'm 14 and I don't really understand the Choreography but the small movements , like each girl rubbing their necks , has a really deep meaning. So good job to you Deepraj
I love you way more than I should ❤️❤️
This is beautiful, I'm crying
Oh my god this was incredible! I'm trying not to cry because I'm watching this at work
you are an angel!!!
im not even a fan but this is BEAUTIFUL
Mygod! Who the heck make Dodie cry!? 😭 Love it a hundred times! 😍😍😭😫💕💕
great job sammy and dodie! I love you guys!
i watched this like 15 times and i regret nothing
Beautiful song and young lady
dodie you wonderful human we all have a lot of love for you
this is so awesome and so powerful
Love it so so much!
I cried. I don't even relate to this, but I'm crying. Oh god
Sammy never fails to amaze me. Wow. Just wow.
This song has effected me and been on of my favorite songs by you since you first released it. And then I became incredibly thrilled to see that you put it on your “You” EP. And now; this video, truly reaches out to me. And I love it, it is all around beautiful. And I thank you so much for the song, the video, and the message.
DODIE YOU MADE MY EYES SWEAT I LOVE YOU
This video was honestly so beautiful
THIS IS SO POETIC AND BEAUTIFUL AND I CAN FEEL THE MEANING AND I JUST\nCAN I CRY
i didn’t even notice there were tears until they dried
holy shit this is perfect. dodie i love you
This is posted on my birthday <3 honestly best birthday present so far.
Always noticed how the lyrics are  I feel like a six out of ten  instead of  I am a six out of ten. Which probably means that people may think of her higher than a six out of ten , and shes the only one who sees herself as a six out of ten because of her insecurities and mental illness
This is so so beautiful. Please keep doing what you do because you inspire me and so many others each and every day. ❤️
i'm not even kidding when I say thins; the emotion and meaning behind all of this has to make this music video the most beautiful I've ever seen. how much I can relate to the song and video makes it 100000xs more heart jerking and i now have tears streaming down my face. thank you dodie for creating such a beautiful masterpiece.
I love this so much.... the way I see it, the shoulders and arms moving up represents the anxiety of each person. And when they push it down, they are trying to control it and keep it hidden. And feeling like a 6/10, to me, means that Dodie feels just above average (5/10). Meaning that she isn't doing great, but she's doing okay; she's able to somewhat control everything: the emotions, the anxiety, etc.\n\nIdk. These are just my thoughts on it.
Omg omg omg I've got goosebumps this is so good
this is amazing, dodie. i understand if you want to leave this to everyone's own understanding and perception, but i just can't help thinking of what you wanted to show yourself? there are theories in the comments of what your movements portray and what the 6/10 actually means, and quite frankly i love all of them, i love how differently people see this video and hear this song. and i understand if you'd like to keep it that way, but boy am i curious of your thoughts on this. anyways, a wonderful song, and a wonderful video. thank you dodie clark and sammy paul, and everyone else working on this piece; amazing.
Reminds me of Cassie from skins when she was at the cafe
This is so powerful
This comment section is so wholesome. This video is so beautiful. And whoever is reading this, know that you are loved. You may feel like a 6/10 or even a 0/10. But you are a 10/10.
I cried. I cried because of this amazing song, I cried because of the amazing meaning, I cried because of the amazing video, then I cried because of the amazing person behind all of it. I love you dodie 💛💛💛

Ah ok, but where's the pornhub link to the rest of the video ?\nLevel 7: successful foreplay..... ooops!\nYour penis just died.
This is the closest thing ive seen to the REAL smosh - Ian\nThis was so creative and enjoyable to watch unlike smosh’s unoriginal and repetitive new “content”
This is so cool
Any fans here of D-trix...that are reading my comment? :p  Wasn't he in a serious relationship with Bethany Mota?!?  I stopped watching him because his content changed drastically, so I got not clue...but he's still on my mind. :p  I'm asking b/c some are saying he's with Lily.
fucking noob I easily got past the 5th lvl where the titty scene is.
Well made, relatable, I wish every youtuber put out content of this quality. Good job Anthony

This video gave me anxiety
Come in Paris we don't give a fuck about all this things. Holding the door for more than one or three person maximum would be weird any way and you would be taken for an idiot.
There's literally no joke. This is the biggest pile of shite ive ever seen in my life
cringier than hillary clinton's wrinkled ass face blushing when someone called her beautiful
Awww he looks so patient despite having to hold the door for people! 😂✌🏻
Anwar is so small but u know he got dat 🍆🍆🍆😋
Legends say that guy is still holding the door till this day

35 second ad at the beginning? this CATS people are spending the big bucks !!!
Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan, DuPont. They control banking, energy, education, health, food, military, entertainment, media.
Rothschild Bank, control almost every central banks in the world, control the world financial system, even Bill Gates or Donald Trump cannot stand against them.
And Coca-Cola Company?
VW Group doesn't own Porsche per se, but it does own the Porsche brand. However, Porsche SE owns VW Group (due to taxes).
Fire service in the USA vs UK for next video?
This is a socialist's nightmare
Some of them can certainly be good. But not Facebook. Facebook is bad.
Uhmm... I just want to point out that it's 'May-lo' not 'Mi-lo'.
Birmingham is the uk's second largest city what else did you get wrong?
How come you left out the oil companies? They have such a huge impact on geopolitics
since when was Manchester the UK's second largest city? its actually Birmingham and now I can't take you and your sources seriously.
Believe it or not Walmart is the strongest
i say behemot companies are neither good or bad for socaiety its just a part of it. Cant live without it, but cant fully let it run loose either.\nIn a modernized world. we depent on such companies to have our economy go around globally.
This video is the only sponsored video that i take action
Writes Toyota, has a Mazda Rx8 oin the video...
British East India Company?l\nThat was worth roughly $7.4 trillion in todays money. They also had 200,000 men in their army, making it one of the largest in the world. Considering at the outbreak of World War One, Great Britain itself only had 250,000 troops, that is pretty good.
I thought there was only 195 countries?
Hahaha I used to play C.A.T.S.
When it comes to computers, Microsoft can shut down EVERYTHING in a few days
Why some companies are valued lower than their revenues?
CATS is a terrible pay-2-play game
I know a guy who likes Golfs
I thought the second most populous city in the UK was Birmingham, no?
All nestle does is kick people out of their homes and make people in developed cities happy.
Really great episode guys, I love how it wasn't a linear top 10 list but actually compared and contrasted the companies
What About Kraft-Heinz. They basically have a monopoly on ketchup
According to your figures Walmart hires 197 people per store. Does this include Customer Service too?
Lol, his sponsor so out of date 😂
I deleted my Facebook, couldn't be happier. Such a huge waste of time. Playing video games is way better use of my time :p
Could you do companies v corporations?
Did he say Meelo for Nestle? It's Milo. It's pronounced My-low. Like Milo and Oats, the movie. But HUMMAGOD, Milo is literally the best chocolatey drink that you can make with powder. It's better than Nesquik. It is sooooo good!
Who’s bill gates
manchester? its birmingham the second city
I love that game
Do something on Airlines! @The Infographics Show
Why is Tata not in the list?
Erm, Manchester has a population of just over 500.000. England's 2nd city is Birmingham @ 1.1 million people.
Bro this is ur best video in a hell of a long time
How can you legitimately claim a video about the most powrful corporations without listing the most profitable, and fundamental to all other private AND public industries - the OIL companies...\n\nExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron. Definitely much more powerful than the companies you list...
Damn my cousin worked at a mcdonalds rip off. Does  that count??
I'm gonna make a company bigger than Apple
Its Strange to see how the markets work;\nFacebook had revenue of $26.5 billion and a market value of $500 billion in 2016, while Wal-Mart had revenues of $485.3 billion and a market value at less than half that amount at $221.3 billion. This means that Facebook's valuation isn't based on its current financial standing, but on what it's expected to be in years to come,which although it seems like sound investing,I see it as a little troubling.Facebook would need a 1731.3% increase in its revenues to simply match Wal-Mart's performance (And if it ever does its market valuation will be at One gazillion dollars).\nInternet stocks are notoriously known for being overvalued and for generating little profit.\nI wouldn't invest a dime on any established internet company, bubbles seems always immanent, because it's genuinely hard to separate genuine businesses and not let yourself be caught by the hype created by the market.
Oh my the amount this channel growed\nI remember when TIS is just 100k subs\nNow its 800k\nAlso yay an interesting advertisement
Microsoft has more than 18,000 employees
SHowed how stocks are overvalued.  Only place where low revenue can have a high value.
India has the largest Telecom network operated by Reliance Jio which covers 99% of Indian population.
I didn't notice that The Infographics Show has less then 1 mil.
I'm Filipino and I'm cringing to how you pronounce milo
USA is the most powerful corporation on earth.
Can I get a short answer
BIRMINGHAM is the UK's second largest city, not Manchester!
most powerful coorporation? the Atlas of course
the infographics show mentioned toyota corollas, officially same person as Real Life Lore
Take a look at Saudi Aramco
One could say that the Chinese Communist Party is the most powerful Corporation.
This video is just some fucking ad for a cat game
Do a video on largest companies regardless of the number of people influenced
A city with a population of 100,000 thousand people is “small” lol alright
Map of India is still incorrect.
You didn't mention the Federal Reserve. They own the world.
Microsoft has 100K+ employees, not 18k.
Brush WERE are the evil central banks they practically rule the world
Your facts are incorrect, Microsoft employs 120,000 people...
And they say monopoly is illegal LOL
You mean corporations that ruined the world?
Monsanto? The biggest agriculture corporation in the world? Has its nasty hands all over basically everything based in plants and animals
No body rules me so do one
what about the trump covfefe corporation? is it number 1? maga
Haha the way he said Milo, Meelo
Milo is pronounce wrongly in this video
What is the value of your life and happiness? These things cannot be purchased. Follow your heart and care for those around you.
Manchester is not the uk second largest city

1:51 so your nuts are your most prized possession?
I absolutely adore Simon's cat !! He captures all the annoying yet adorable and amusing quirks of cats so perfectly. I've had twelve cats during my lifetime who are sadly now all deceased and I miss them every single day. Watching Simon's cat though brings a smile to my face and often makes me laugh out loud ! 💕
You think a cat is a pain, try living with a raccoon. OMG it's worst than a 2 year old and puppy combined.
Oh my god. I wa laughing so badly as I saw the cat in the first scene, tanning under the lamp. Hahahahah
Miaou i suscribe
lmao
Priceless possession :D
Awh, this makes me sad that my Fluffbutt decided to sleep in the closet tonight. :(
9 minutes of simon's cat. SO HAPPY
Regardless I still love my cat no matter what. <3
That eas great! And long too! 😁😂

Always happy to find a new story from Simon's Cat :)))  =^.^=
Such a talented cartoon artist! This is so much like my cat. You got the actions of a cat drawn perfectly.
So, so true. Blessed Be my furry friends. Some day we all shall meet again. I love each & every one of yr cartoon critters. U perfectly capture their essential spirit, awa their p.o.v. I particularly enjoy the it's their world, really, & we're just along for the ride, w/their permission, that is realization that comes thru when it's all said & done. We try to act all stern & head-of-household w/them, but deep down, we all know we're completely smitten & would jump thru a field of hoops for just one kitty kiss or outstretched puppy paw against our cheek. Who's really the pet, I wonder? I don't see them fawning over/cleaning up after us. I have always had a true & honest love & respect for our animal friends. They really oftentimes are more kindred to me than my own family/human companions. And they don't judge, so long as u care for them proper. I joke, but it's a win-win, really. Simon's Cat forever reminds me of this.
Anybody else notice the oven mitt hand towel combo in the 3rd short?
Cats are selfish, self-serving cunts that want what they want when they want it. Get a dog.
He threw the tissue in the trash and just said. Yes...
This is the online equivalent of those really bad comics from the funnies section of the newspaper
I've seen your videos since I was 6 years old. This cat is my childhood :)
This is hilarious I could not stop laughing 😂
Simons cat told you to tap a few buttons here and get paid for it.....\n\n\n\n\nGO HERE 👉 http://tinyurl.com/y7gq4xz8
Great stuff, but I wish you had broken them into separate videos.
Neither of my cats ever played with lasers.  They always gave me a look as if to say, I always thought better of you…  Give me something to actually catch, or no go.
I just got a kitten 4 days ago! She's 8 weeks old and her name is Kindle. :)
Congratulations on making the video on #18 in trending, keep up the great work!!!
I just want everyone to know that every year in Minneapolis MN in the USA there is a cat video festival!
Cats are TOO funny and so much fun! I love my cat, her name is Shrimpy!
can i tag my cat in this
I'm in the same situation everyday! 😺👍💗
Hahaha all true and still all worth it. 🐾
I love this cat lol
You make my day-no matter what worries I carry around with me -you make me laugh and smile-thanks so much for keeping us smiling -we need it!
I love Simon's Cat - been watching for years.  Love IT!
Thank you so much for the giggles! Have a fantastic weekend. :D
For that first one, my cats will just try to catch the pen, and make me mess up.
As annoying as they can be, we love them just the same.
Does anyone else use the paw gesture, the cat does when it wants food, to refer to your own cat wanting food?
love the planting cartoon then the cat does what a cat does in the hole the look on the cats face is priceless, Brilliant love you simons cat!!💜💜
that was the perfect start to my saturday morning ...thanks simon's cat and the man himself .
I love the smug 'what a good boy am I' look he has - like after catching the race car.  My cat gives me the same look and it just cracks me up.
I'm not a cat person, but I love these videos!
So what you're saying is, dogs are better? :P
Best videos ever! How could anyone not like this? Ha!
So much reasons to send them to the sun.
My cat is fat and fluffy like a cloud also it weighs 20 pounds...
7:19 that was sad af
Then don't own a cat. Simple.
HA HA, LOLOUDLY, MAN!!! You was havin fun with that cat!
Is Simons Cat based off a real cat
i read that as cats can be a real pain in the ass
I LOVE how u draw your cats!!! why am I here
please hold while I transfer your call LMAO IM SCREAMING JACKIE
“Milk you need some milk” I’m dead I don’t even know what that means but I’m GONE 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
milk and also glossier is just invisible makeup for ppl with flawless skin i do have skin problems, my skin gets dry sometimes! and too much money
I love your videos. I watch them for entertaining , but damn I hate make up
I am big fan of glossy lids and I love this eye look
WE STAN YOU JACKIE, YES MOTHER SHAKE US 🗣🗣👏🏾
I want your lashes! So beautiful!!
I know you're not living for the foundation, but I've got to say your skin looks beautiful! This look is so fresh and pretty! The lip is oon my wish list now, thanks, lol!
Yes...! The stick blur stick was oily on me... The foundation on it's own was ok..
I hope one day some brand makes a sili sponge that is actually likeable😂
Lmao I swear you're my best friend in my head. You're so funny and real. I don't wear makeup because I spend all my money on yarn but I be living my beauty life thru you lol
You ballin. I need your bank account 😭😭😊😊
Although I understand that milk is supposed to be one of those trendy minimalistic indie brands, the way these products work together gives the impression that they aren't that well thought-out. It makes me feel like we're paying for a gimmick, and that's a lot of money to be paying for a product just because it's cool
This is more of Korean meets american makeup formula. Like they give you Korean dewy finish with full face. It CAN be cute but for some people it can come off sweaty or oily.
I love the fact that you sing your own intro😂😂
I love the milk makeup foundation.(I have extremely dry skin with hyper pigmentation and acne and this this foundation covers me). But it also separates in the tube after a while and cost so much:: I’m honestly trying to find something to replace it.
I am so here for this eye look!!! Fabulous!!!!!
It would be interesting to see you without a mock neck top on. \nThat foundation was straight Lisa Simpson looking. \nThe products looked like they would be better stroked on a brush and then applied, just so you can control the product. That chubby stick is just not good. \nIf you hadn't used the Wowder, it would have been straight yellow oil face. The only think I have ever liked from this brand is the lid gloss. Hope that $1K is a tax write-off 😩😑
This look is so beautiful 😍
I legit suscribed the moment this video started
Hey Jackie! I reached out to you on ig via DM and Email. ig@tonimosshair The Golden Serum Growth Elixir
omg i have hyperhydrosis tooooo and girl is it a fucking struggleeeeeeeeeeeee. like i feel you soooo hard🤕❤️❤️
Eww omg I have the same reaction when people blend with their fingers I just hate how the product feel on them afterwards lmfaoo
Jackie you're to entertaining not to watch. You're one of the few beauty gurus I'd watch for 26 min.
The foundation...is my everything!!! SO FUCKING GOOD
Yikes. That silisponge is a def no go
That's a no on this foundation.
I thought the finish of the foundation was gorgeous when you powdered it but it seemed to get oily so quickly. It would slide right off my face. Your natural lashes looked soooo bomb!! Idk if it was because of that mascara or if they look that bomb with every mascara lol
Thanks for review but I'm not buying milk.
I don't wear makeup and I'm not a WOC, but I'm a subscriber because I enjoy your personality :)
I love All your videos 😍😍😍
not here for the milk makeup girl
the amount of jump cuts made my head hurt
I’m waiting on someone to make the Jackie song for Jackie! But I still want Jackie to sing 🎤 at the beginning! 😍😘😍
I love her face at 11:15 !!!😂😂I love her videos
Can you review the tarte magic star collector's set please??!!!?
You just contributed to like 90% of their sales bc no one is fucking buying their products because of the lack of diversity in shades lmaoooo
For a girl you're pretty funny
Review the Laura Lee palette!
If you don't do a lil dance when she does the Jackay song, do you even deserve to be here??? 😂😂
I haven't had luck with milk products.
I spent $97 at Sephora and started crying ! Lol I look forward to the day when I can spend $1000. Until then I'm living through you financially ahahahhah😆
And..... It turned me black.. OMG
All the fenty products in the background
LIIIIVVINNNGG for this look you created, regardless of the performance of some of the product, you freaking pulled this through girl ❤️❤️
love the way you pronounce dollars
I loveeeeee you so much
Didn't understand the misogynistic comment about her indecisiveness and inability to understand her own wants. Was this a joke?
I love how you start your videos
You got me dying with your milk jokes
Nail are killing the game
Milk, I need som Milk!! LOL Tell em Jackie!  This is why I live for you!
INtro has GOT TO GO!
I've been subscribed for months and I still feel like your judging me like a non subscriber. 😂😂
YOUR SKIN LOOKED AMAZING AFTER YOU PUT ON POWDER WOW!!!
Jackie I laugh so hard every time you upload! You’re hilarious, I love it!
Seem like a lovely person but don't waste so much money on makeup
Jackie’s hair looks like ramen noodles and I LOVE ME SO NODDLES. \nNatural hair is POPPPPPIN 😍😍😍😍😍
Them eyes and them lips honey are errrrrythang 😘😘😘😍😍😍
😂😂😂if it washed up on the shore. Im dead 💀
That is blending right into my skin tone 😂ur face
_MILK YOU NEED SOME MILK_
They do need more dark shades 😂😂 it's just easy to make white skin makeup bc it's basic asf  😑😐 like some of our personalities
This look was high key 90's tea!
You're not supposed to put a creme on after you powder. Creme won't mix with powder
that lip is giving me such heavy fall vibes!!!!!!! love it
Don't worry too much lol you need all the makeup you can get.
I actually have and really like their mascara!
Okay but why am I living for the eye and lip together
das espensive eh kathleen
YOUR HAIR 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥
It’s U-ba-mey. not Ubam
ZIMONZIA GURL, YOU NEED SOME MILK

I Spent $1,000 on MILK Makeup, And.... STILL UGLY
jesus all might that foundation was so yellow on u damn damnn jesus
At the rate we're going we're gonna be dead way before we have the tech for this
How would they know what protons and neutrons are? What if they explain the universe a different way?
Did not have instructions for how to construct a teleported out of aliens. Disappointed.
But what if what we call electron, proton, and atom they have different names for them and can't understand the shit we talk to them ?😞
How would they know what numbers you are talking about?
Instead of a teleporter, just build a wormhole. It's so much easier. \n#DUH
but second is something we made up just like kg   , as well as proton and numbers are the same thing , we can't talk with them about anything really
I'd like to see how us or aliens are going to measure things up to 10 or even more numbers after zero so they can match it to system of measurements and not screw everything up by tiny, insignificant margin of error %)
Before we go trying to communicate in terms of charged particles, we should switch our proton/positive, electron/negative convention so they don't make fun of us.
the kilogram will soon be defined by the caesium hyperfine frequency, or the #2 incase you were wondering. we can use the speed of light and the planck constant aswel
How if they don't understand our numbers?
How can they read our numerals?
Didn't Carl Sagan's Contact book/movie already cover this?
So wait, I didn't actually learn how to build a teleporter with aliens?! Fraud!
And how to comunicate 'atoms' 'protons' or number??
then again math is our language or at least our interpretation
The assumption the standard model is also used by aliens is fallacious.
How do we know.if they know what does an atom means
but telling them what we mean by protons and neutrons ...
you missed the decimal system .. how are they supposed to know what our numbers mean?
What if they don't have mathematics, or what if they don't count in base 10?
may be they don't even know what a proton is!!
In a parallel universe, there's another ME that has won the Mega Millions Jackpot.  Every year.  For the past 20 years.  That me is a BALLER!  \n\nIn that universe, I have a skyscraper 3x as big as the Burj Dubai.  And that's just my vacation home in the mountains!  :)
What about right and left?
Can't we just wait for the aliens to send us their method of determining mass and use that?
thats some deep thought for an imaginary concept  that is impossible to begin with because we haven't even invented  the necessary science for the steps
+minutephysics \nHappy birthday, belated :D\n\nAlso, how can you ensure that both parties are using the same number system? E.g. base10, base8, or something different.
Couldn't we calculate each other's mass by knowing the size of the planets and star and their orbits and then just do the conversion to their system?
To work out a kilogram I guess you could tell them to drop a 10cm cube of ice (or whatever molecule) in a vacuum and ask them to measure it's acceleration (once they've worked out time and distance)
Literally ignored the title to a tee. Still an interesting video, but so very misleading
More like, how to better define the kilogram...
This is of course assuming that the aliens have a compatible capacity for communication and they have a 'current' understanding of what's a proton or electron is.\nGranted it is likely that they would know but if that is really old hat to them it might be akin to the discovery of cooking meat to us. They might be looking for a more modern analogy from their perspective (imagine if they communicated with us in 1890). Communication will need to cross species barriers, biological barriers, technological barriers etc.\nI would love for this to happen but I think there is a risk that communication would be somewhat harder than this.
yea, except they have different number system lol
Hang on. 1kg = 1 litre of water = 10cm x 10cm x 10cm cube of water. So if you can communicate what a metre is and what water is you can tell them how much 1kg weighs.
And I thought the aliens would tell us complicated things.
They have already captured our cows and made circles in our farms. Only reason for building a teleporter is to send a photon torpedo through it.
I had this scenario in the back of my mind.
How do you teach them what proton means? We would need to learn their language first
This situation gets even more complicated when we consider the difference of our linguistic and mathematical languages to theirs. Like, how can we be sure that they represent mathematical concepts with the same labels and symbols like we do?
What if aliens count to 11 before its a 2 diget number
Yeah, the aliens will surely know what are  protons   neutrons and electrons.
But who says aliens count in base 10? I think the trouble starts with conveying numbers, especially such large ones...
so much to tell about new standard of mass!
Why aren't we using an even number of some atom as a measuring rod? I mean after all, the mass of an electron (or proton, or neutron) as is the wavelength of hydrogen (or cesium) emission is the same all over the universe, so shouldn't we use exactly (say) 2^100 (since we know they have computers and must understand base 2) or 10^30 or some other even number to converse to aliens?
Only, the communications will take millenniums.
But how would they know what a proton or neutron is?
how would they know what a electron ,atom or protons is
You assume we can communicate. And that they know what a proton is. And that they know what numbers are.\nBut before you even start to communicate, you first need to build a faster than light method of talking to them. Unless you want to wait 8.734 years between replies.
And how would they know what a proton is to begin with
The thing is, if the aliens don’t know what a kilogram is they probably don’t know what proton or a neutron is.
Man what a click bait title
We will build a teleport, and the aliens will pay for it. \nMake the earth great again.
This was quite an interesting way to talk about Avogadro's number :P
This seems like a weirdly roundabout premise considering you clearly just wanted to talk about the problems with basing our units on physical things.\n\n\nLike, what if we lose the fucking thing?
Of course make sure they come through first! Remember The Fly? Yeah... also prepare to feast on their corpse!
In what language will you talk to them?
Make a video on them teaching us their measurement ..that would be funny 😆
Thanks, but I think you gave the impression that the kg is only defined in Paris, but that's just where the standard is stored. Maybe Bose–Einstein condensate would be the best mass standard since it has no kinetic energy.
what if they don't know math
But how do we know they even know what an atom is ?
Is it true that we'd never be able to correctly convey the concept of Left and Right (and associated concepts like clockwise) without being able to demonstrate in person?
*Why am I watching this at 2 A.M.?*
A kilogram is a certain number of a certain atom though, you absolutely could tell them what a kilogram is
PSA - Skillshare is super sus, I signed up through another youtubers link and got a free month. To do so though I had to put in my credit card details, I figured hey even if I forget to cancel it's only like $10 so who cares. Turns out the first time skillshare charges you they automatically charge you for a whole year. You have been warned...
I wonder if it's an alien watching this right now thinking, you Humans haven't figured out how to space travel yet
light doesnt travel the same speed through all atmospheres, right?
Presumes that Aliens perceive what we perceive in atoms. What if, say, they can perceive dark energy and they have a completely different model of the atom.
Such a click bait title... wasn't expecting this from you guys T_T
..and you think THEY will listen to US?
Who said aliens even count?
Pump your room full of dmt vapor, there's your portal.
This is why we need to move away from the kilogram and back to the stone.
build two, send one... ez pc
So this is assuming that they work in a base 10 number system?
Isn't a kilogram 1 cubic decilitre of water, which is 10cm^3, or isn't that what it's supposed to be? Wouldn't that be easy to tell the aliens about?
OK But even if we managed to establish communication with them, the messages would take many years to travel that distance soooo it would be a very long process as well as a confusing one
omg, lol, you are the king of clickbait.
Can't they just Google?
0:45 flawed since 0:00 They maybe not comunicate in any way close to ours, the wont knwo what a atom is and they wont know what a proton or anything else is
can you teleport a person but leave cancer behind?
How do we know when we tell them the element with 3 protons that they know what we mean with element, proton or even 3?
I think it's likely that if a human is ever born in another solar system it will be because we tell an alien race how to arrange DNA to make a human and what to feed it.
Wait can't you just tell them to get a cubic desimeter / a liter of water? Cuz iirc that should weigh one kilo
How do you learn the language first?
how would they know what a pronton or electron is, u solved nothing in ur video. Communication should be the first thing to get down.
As I understand it, nobody knows how to tell an alien which is left and which is right. That might be important.
CARTOONS ARE FOR CHILDREN!
Someone has been watching Contact
How do you know that Aliens from Alpha Centauri never visited our planet?
science is hard
Tu canal  esta en español  pero esta en inglés  el contenido . .
2:08  (Haha, a photon that weighs a kilo :)
happy birthday bro.
Atoms Atoms Atoms\n\nGot It
Got a minute?
Sorry no espanol
That was awesome. ^.^

Nice to see he wants to stay thank god
Western populations should shed their illusions. Our governments are committing war crimes and imposing an overseas holocaust on non-belligerent countries. The West and its allies are terrorizing and destroying countries and they are falsely projecting their own high crimes onto their victims.
Exercise clothes make the best pajamas
I hope everyone saw the Illuminati symbol on “You hate working out”
My home gym consist of a squat rack, bench, barbell, dumbells, dip belt, and an arm blaster. I love working out regardless of where sometimes I’ll even run to the park just to exercise.
*looks at gym equipment gaining dust*\nI should work out again.......\n\nI'll start tommorow
This is a funny idea and is totally true, so why am I not laughing. I've been wondering about this in their last few videos.
Most machines are ass, they don't build stability muscles. I prefer to lift my own American stomach fat up and down.
I thought the machine could talk and would insult you as you used it
Lower the volume of the background music. It was a bit too loud
Where do I buy this?
This was hilarious, because it hit way too close to home. My mom has an ab lounger that she's never taken out of the box. I'm so used to it partially blocking the hallway that I step around it subconsciously. It's a really great cat pedestal.
Yes! That is exactly right! \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Finally an episode that is not liberal propaganda.
GRANT, YOU'RE TOO FUCKING TALL!
Grant is so hot 😂😍
Just Give Us Your Fucking Money!
this videa is awesome, snl quality all the way, you are great collegehumor
I feel like CH made this video specially for me and it´s their way to tell me to move my fat ass to the gym...
I now want to buy a work out machine, and never use it...
Your humour is a thin mask for your self loathing
Where's the damn phone number!!! I desperately need this man!!
Why do people hate working out? I can never get it.
You're so cute. Can we go on a date?
My dad uses it for a hanger at his house
College humor has really fallen from grace
… \n\nI know it's supposed to make fun of his height..\n\nBut with all those freeballing shots in his underwear.. \n\nI think it was just to see his bulge..
I legit thought this was keith from try guys
You should do an it themed skit but for adults and it represents what adults are afraid of and it's commitment being sober and debt
Before you watch this, here is the answer to the video's title:  Don't
I actually thought this was an ad and tried to skip it
I'm too embarresed to try new machines at the gym so I just do treadmill and leave
How long till we get another troopers episode,love the skits yall do but would love to seen another episode of troopers.
I just don't know how I lived without this. :)
This channel is going to shit
This is so true
Thought this was a new idubbbz video from the thumbnail :'(
It's the first time that thhe writer didn't do the outro!!! What happened?!?! :OO
Damn, I didn't know College Humor was still around.  They've been around for years. I forgot about them.
Lol! I'm bigger than that guy and I'm 15 years old.
This was too real to be funny
This video helped me find an excuse to stop working out at the gym 😉
You're saying you *don't* use them as sex toys?
He put the lightbulb in, while there was still electricity coursing threw it.
Why is this not a marketing campaign already?
It would have been just as funny without the profanity.
Makes me want to buy one just for all those purposes
Grant just wanted to be shirtless
this needs to be a real  commercial
Who ever did the voice kinda sounds like John Cena
Finally. College humor made a good video
So where could I get this from again?
is it just me or has Pat becum more hawt over the years
Hi I'm Roge ... oh wait, you stole his video
Fighter Workout Tip: End of the day you only NEED two things. Nice set of reasonable weight dumb bells (10 for newer folks, 20-25 goal. Higher if bigger person) and a really durable heavy bag. That and some god damn discipline is all you need to not only get your body in order, but do so in a way that gives you a very natural build. Nothing overly stressful, very little chance of injury unless you're a fucking imbecile, and exceptionally relaxing afterwards. I'm telling you, NOTHING like just going apeshit on a heavybag to make a shitty day a bit better. Put in what you want to get out. 5-10 minutes a day, or a few hours. You got that shit either way.
Intruding into a No Flex zone?\n\nThey knooooow better. They knooooow better.
This is so accurate it's making me rethink my life
i watched this to help motivate me to workout and by the end i am eating chips on the couch.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
Hello, I recently started my humouristic channel. It would mean the world to me if you could give me a chance
i dont remember the word pajama looking like that
Hey guys, remember when College Humor was actually funny? I know, I almost forgot they were too
Where do I sign
I hate the no flex now all my close are ripped
That's a shitty apartment?
Can I actually buy that, I'll pay it off
Now this is why i sub to collegehumor.
Boo! I only tune in to these to see Katie. We wanna see Katie!... Naked... Now...
Come on! We need iPhone X parody!
Anybody else notice the person in the window at the end?
Fun video, but how about showing a little maturity, and stop trivializing the benefits of physical fitness for a change America?
Only watch grant shit now, rest of videos have gotteb meh
Didnt pat used to be ripped? I have a vague memory of him having abs or some shiett
Esse em alta ta uma porra
Do drink or candle
Wanna suck dem pink nips all hardcore
SUB TO ME!!!
Accurate. Just another clothes hanger.
E
I find Grant really sexy
We're trending
Hot <3

The internet memes return..
N
Jesse welling is the king of creation \nAn you can't say your not creative the way you talk about serious stuff an makes people want to watch it again and again because you have an inviting an happy vibe in all you videos
I can relate so much to this. I am surrounded by creative people and I can't even make pretty doddles.
Hi Hannah, \nI think being creative is not about just 'being able to draw' but rather a way of life and understanding things. I really believe that everyone is innately creative, however society has kept telling us that only certain 'arts' fir into that category. \nYou should read Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert, she talks about and redefines, in my view, what a creative life is!\nXxxx
I freaked out when you showed the doodle you always do because I always do the exact same one!!!
I DO THAT DOODLE, that's the only one that I do and I relate to this video a lot. I'm an academic and not creative at all, but that's ok :) great video
Agh thank you! I'm the same all my friends are so incredible at art or music or writing but I just can't do those things however much effort I put into them and I've kinda been struggling with that lately so thank you for making this bc actually I'm a really hard worker and I'm sure if they tried to do politics or sociology they wouldn't be as good as they are at art either :) xx
My dream was always to be an artist. Be it a musician, painter, writer or an actor. That's why I'll never be happy, I think. My creativity is minus 1 thousand. I still play guitar and other instruments because playing and singing gives me a little of joy, but I think I gave up on being a musician. I'm trying photography now, cause it seems it can be an art form, but doesn't need as much creativity as say writing. Oh, and I'm not a people person. I suck at communicating. I can be organised but that doesn't come easily as well. Might as well shoot myself in the head.
I definitely resonate with this. I am also very organised. I feel like being creative is a process that I have to practice and hone. It does not come naturally to me, but I enjoy the satisfaction of seeing small improvements in my work.
I'm not creative either I suck at all things arts n craftsie luckily my job doesn't require me to be artistic but I do feel your pain as most of the ladies I know are good at creative things and I think it would be nice to have a little bit of skill with a paintbrush or sewing machine x
I’m creative and I’m organised, I put everything in my life into a routine
I'm the opposite. I am a creative person, I can dream up stuff and draw and create but I am surrounded by people who think this is magic. But I am insanely jealous of people who are seamlesy self disciplined and work hard because I am lazy and dream a lot. \nNot everyone has to be creative, not everyone has to be good with numbers, not everyone has to be organized (at least not heavy organized :D ) but we can all work together and learn from each other a bit.
I completely changed my mind about creativity when I read Elizabeth Gilbert's book Big Magic where she essentially says every person is creative. You might not be creative in your editing, but you are creative in coming up with content. Creativity is often pigeon-holed as just art, music, painting, and poetry but writing is also creative and you wrote a whole bloody book!  Also don't believe organisation opposes or limits creativity. Loved the video!
love this!!!! :) such a great video as always xoxoxo
Honestly Hannah, I swear we are the same person! My boyfriend is incredibly creative, its what calms him down, and he can't understand how I can't doodle or write a story or write a song! Thank you for this
Funny thing for ne is that I actually love all the arts. I love music, poetry, photography. I'm just not good at that. But that's ok, I'm graduating from med school and that's where my being driven and organized really helped. In my free time I enjoy arts or I bake cake, for fun not because I feel obligated to do it!
I think creativity is more of a spectrum than discrete categories. Maybe it’s not that you’re not creative, it’s just that it takes a bit longer to come up with ideas and stuff, compared to more creative spirits. But when it comes to putting those into practice, girl you got this! Much love for your vids 💛
Creativity isn't necessarily talent to make beautiful stuff. For me it is about taking your way of looking at the world and applying it to solving problems in a way that no one else can. For me, the ability to 'get stuff done' is creative. \n\nIn her book 'Big Magic', Elizabeth Gilbert says ...the central question upon which all creative living hinges: Do you have the courage to bring forth the treasures that are hidden within you?. And I think you're extremely courageous.
Another one into the club! Welcome hannah
I disagree. Creativity is about how you think, not what you can physically do, and that can include hiring other people to execute your ideas. The drawing, building, making, strumming, composing, writing and so on are all skillsets that can aid your creativity. You can improve them through hard work, but it’s ok if you don’t want to. What matters is that you keep making amazing things, with the help of others if that’s what you need, that enrich and improve the lives of everyone around you.\n\nBut mostly I came here to say that the space shuttle necklace is AMAZING.
That quadratic equation, so hot. How about showing us some differentials girl 😂
Do you have a toy space shuttle on your necklace?! That must've been made by someone very creative 😂
To me 'creativity' never really ment to talent to create, but more the urge to do so. I see it as similar to hunger. If I don't get around to make something for a while, I get irritated, sometimes not even knowing why. You don't have to do it well, you just have to want to do it.\n\nIt seems to me  (from the other side of the screen) that you do have an urge to create. I'd be hard to make videos every week if you didn't! \n\nX viv
I sure like to think juices ooze out of you constantly :) (jk Hannah :D)
Both of my parents are analytical. One is very organized, one is not. My sis found math and science easy. I didn't. I'm still writing songs, and being more creative than my sis. When we were younger, my sis and I both played multiple instruments. We asked our parents, How did we get so creative? Neither of you are. There wasn't a good answer. It's whatever random amount of stimuli that I clinged onto. I've had song books thrown away by my parents and I still wrote songs. You gravitated to math and science. That's good enough. Making videos in the way you can is good enough. I can't make videos all the time without them turning into garbage. This was a great video because you're not an artist and you did it to the best of your ability anyways.
I love it. Even as a creative person, I can relate.
Well not with an attitude like that!
I'll trade you some of my creativeness for some of you hard-working focus ;)
This makes creative things seem more achievable and do able for people who aren't creative in the normal sense. Hannah, thank you for always being honest.
i love that you reinforce that it is actually okay to not be a creative person, because so often it's seen as this Super Amazing Personal Quality™ that we should all aspire to have! i do just want to say though, that the vast majority of creative things you listed, require a heck of a lot of practice - even from creative people! so, while it's definitely a-okay to not be creative, don't completely discount it just because you're not automatically great at visual art or music or design. creativity is also one of those things that you need to actively work at and develop, and i believe, from what i understand anyway, that creativity is sort of like a giant-ass heavy boulder - if you can get it rolling, you can keep it going but, if it stops, it's hard to get it going it again. anyway, great video, i really enjoyed it (very creative for someone who isn't creative 😉), and i love the message you're sending x
It's amazing because although you mourn your lack of 'creativity', it's your logic, well defined, interesting and heck creative ideas that i come back for. I have dyslexia and loads of issues with organising my thoughts (lol why do i like three essay subjects) AND IT SUCKS. Be proud of your organisation, babe, i am in such awe of it 🖤 Hey you're not conventionally 'creative' but you are interesting which is so much more important xxxx
Hannah, you are absolutely a creative person. How the hell could you not be as an ENFP? You wrote a book - that's a creative talent to me!
That was so good to hear, and I guess good to tell people. I'm also not creative. And while I'm not a youtuber or something like that, the word creative seems to dominate all jobs now and that makes me so stressed because in next year I'll be fresh after my Master, needing to get a job. Like you, I was bad in art and my friends were awesome. I still can't draw a straight line!\nI like your videos. I like that you just talk to us and I can tidy my room while listening to you. I enjoy looking at you as well and I don't feel like you're missing some artistic light, crazy frames or italics flying around. You do you, we're here to watch!
THANK YOU SO MUCH for this. I've also been surrounded by insanely talented people, and although I am creative, I have been feeling out of touch w my creative side. I always think that I'm not creative enough. Love you, Hannah. X
Well just cuz u can't draw more than doodle stick people boobs... u are still pretty cute and your accent makes u even better 😊 Have fun out there!
Nerdy Hannah!  Thank you so much for making these videos. You make us feel better about who we are. :)
Being creative and being organized is so often portrayed as an either/or kind of thing.. but in the end I think it comes down to what you define yourself as? I'm more on the creative side, but also somewhat organized (otherwise I wouldn't be able to do all things I'm doing). For others it might be the other way round. And still I define myself as a creative person and somehow, in the general narrative, this entails that I can't also see myself as an organized person. Weird.
I love this! As a math major I can relate so much!
this was so good!!
Really like your videos all the time - but I just plainly disagree with this. Why create a restriction of what an artist is or isn't.
juices oozing out of YOU?! I don't think so ....
We would be great friends. Your honesty inspires me
Yeah thanks for putting exactly how i feel in words
i'm gonna be honest i only liked bc of boobies
You are creative by approaching challenges and communicating with people in creative ways. Creativity doesn't always mean putting pencil to paper. For a large majority of people who are uncomfortable expressing themselves artistically, they take their inherent creativity and put it to work in their own fields. Loved the video Hannah!!!
Nice video, Hannah - creativity does come in many forms, and it's enough to be hardworking and driven! I've been told I can write well, but mathematics and making things with my hands have never been easy for me. I was only able to draw coats of arms after weeks of practice; hard work does definitely pay off!
Because you're not a good at drawing, painting, music, etc. (as you say) doesn't mean you're not creative. It just means you don't have a natural talent for drawing, painting, music, etc.
I HAVE NEVER RELATED SO MUCH IM ACTUALLY CRYING. I just reached Year 10, and was far too eager to quit art, it was so stressful being around too many creative people and seeming incapable. Same as you, maths was my best. I love numbers and equations. However, I do music now only because I can manage to play 2 instruments. BUT IT'S FAR TOO STRESSFUL and now I want to go to art.
I have never related more, I too and surrounded by creative people and I can't draw or make something for the life of me. I'm so much more of an academic, rules and ways of doing things, I even got excited when I saw the quadratic formula. This video is amazing.
Its a very different take love it no body holds up none creative people there always shown to be boring and in the way but you are defiantly not
I'm the complete opposite. I'm creative as hell but when it comes to organization and focus, I'm a shitshow. Does it really come naturally to you?! I have to work so bloody hard to be organized and stay on task, and even then, it doesn't always happen.
Did you ever hire a PA in the end?
An artist isn’t a cookie-cutter label with strict boundaries!  Yes, people define an artist as making some form of visual/auditory art for money, but you can still be a creative person/artist without staying within the boundaries of that definition!  You are creative with how you write, express yourself, and yes, even with how you stay organized!!!!  Being creative or an artist is all about breaking boundaries and smashing labels to smitherines!  Get the tradition definition of artist out of your head and embrace your own definition of being creative 😄
Omg Hannah this was such as good video. I hope you're proud of the end product! Well done to sam too!\n\nBut also you talked about how you 'just stand in front of a camera' and I was yeah you do but that's what I like about you!!  💗
I am an unorganized creative human. But man, you are enough. I loved this.
I relate to this so so hard this feels like a video I could make and I agree I often feel I don't belong on this site because I'm not creative enough but its been a part of my life for 7 years and I can't stop doing it and I can't draw or do music or anything like that but my lack of creativity hits a lot in enjoying creating videos
Hi Hannah,I am also not a creative n artistic person but surrounded by them n believe me I hate myself for not being one of them,but sometimes I think what I am capable of they aren't like making 💰,
I also don’t think being creative is limited to things like sketching or writing poetry - you are such an inspiring person and you take really important and interesting topics and put them into relatable words and dialogues. How could that not be creative ?
I admire people like you. You help us not descend into chaos.
i'm far more creative than I am organised, it'd be nice to be somewhere in the middle 🙈
I was beginning to fall down an anxiety rabbit hole but I put this on just as background noise and it pulled me out of it - thanks Hannah!
thaaaaaaank yooou! I feel the same way. I’m a nanny and I’m just expected to tell stories and make crafts constantly and I just don’t have that gene!
Your thoughts are creative. The fact that you posted this is creative!
i think that everyone can create, just not everyone is artsy. you create ideas and make them come to life, you create schedules and plans and stick to them. Those are things i wish i could do. You create different things.
You are primed to become a logical artist.....I found myself the same way, then I discovered drafting and design. You turn numbers, logic and organization into buildings, homes, airplanes etc. I took me years but I found art I could make.
Hi Hannah! Many singers do not write their own songs nor they compose the music. Are they less artist for that? Or course not, because they can transmit messages and emotions.\n\nIn your videos, you communicates a lot of messages and a lot of emotions. Case point: the menstrual cup video. :) Producing movies and short videos is an art. You perform in front of a camera.\n\nAre you creative? I do not know, how much of the writing do you do for your videos? Are you and artist? Yes, as much as any actor/actress.
I LOVE this, so genuine. V inspired right now (is that ironic?)
I'm going to teach you something, I hope. Creativity comes through in many ways, not just artistic. I am retired now, but i was a laboratory whiz . I could organize better than most. That was part of my creative nature.  Didn't have to paint or draw to be creative.  Think you're mislabeling your sitch. You're probably not artistic, you are sure the heck creative.
This is honestly such a relief to watch. I feel the exact same way--I'm not an artistic or ideas person and it's really easy to get down on myself about that. Great to know I'm not the only one feeling this way, and it's a good reminder to focus on my strengths.
I'm exactly the same Hannah, my dad and sister are fantastic at Art and design etc and here's me still drawing stick men...but someone once told me: art comes in many forms my friend, doesn't just have to be a pen to paper ❤
Being creative is subjective. I think if you try to write poetry, or draw and expect something amazing right away then you don't really understand how long it takes to be good at something. I believe there is literally no such thing as being talented right from the start, even those with amazing voices still need to practice them. I'm a writer and do you know how many times I have sat and wrote some pretty bad shit? I agree with the video, but I also think it's very hard to define what being creative is just like how it's hard to define what being smart is
That was a beautiful chorus of ums
I see you, quadratic equation, I see you. This is what GCSE maths has trained me for
More about the maths! I find maths really creative for me, but typically 'creative' stuff I hate.
You are truly a Hufflepuff and I really enjoy the after maths of your hard job, so thanks :)
Serious question:  You put out roughly one video a week.  What does your work week require?  Is that time spent editing, emails, contracts, etc?  I really am curious.  What about people like the Shaytards or CtFXC who put out a video everyday.  Do they have teams to help them?  You had an intern, what did they do for you?
Semi good at art but not a people person, but I'm pretty determined at what I do and I guess that's pretty ok :)
great video. we all have our strengths and weaknesses. no one type of personality is better than another.
does making memes count as being creative?
Why is this my whole entire LiFe
this video is awesome and i think it actually highlights one of the major problems with how we view creativity in people, like a well or a constant outpouring, like talent rather than skill, as if anything ever really comes naturally to anybody. i'm a creative person. i'm a musician and a songwriter, and i take great pride in being those things, but i wouldn't say they come naturally to me. i'd say that i'm lucky that my parents put me in classical piano when i was five, and i'm lucky that i grew up in an environment that allowed me to experiment with writing and music in a way that's led me to the place that i'm at today, but it doesn't come naturally to me. it takes a lot of practice and passion and hard work to make the things that i do. i think what's more important than whether or not you're creative is whether or not you care, whether or not you're passionate about what you're doing. cos that's what shows, and that's what really matters. at least to me
Every talent is a talent
I'm the absolute same way. Not creative, but analytical and organized. Also, what app are you using for your calendar/to do list? It looks so streamlined omg
You are the kind of person I crave in my life Hannah. I am debilitatingly creative. I suck at communicating, organization, follow through, ALL OF THE THINGS. At one point in my life, I realized that I was only surrounded by other creative people, and I felt this crippling inertia. I decided to proactively have more people like you around me. And I became more productive! Now I hire people like you to help me accomplish my goals. Never doubt yourself. You are SUPER valuable!
The idea that you have to make art to be creative is dumb. Being creative is not only about making art, it's also about coming up with new ways to solve problems, etc.
What if you're none of those things? I always struggle because I'm not creative, I'm so not organised and I'm not good at maths or science. Most of the time I'm not good at anything and that's not me being self depreciating, that's just my conclusion after spending a lot of time in contemplation about this. Who am I and what am I supposed to be? I'm lost with no song to write, no picture to draw and no scientific equation to explain it.
Hi
so good!
v nice witton
quad formula + boobies = magic.
Ugh you are so fantastic.
damn, great video
loving the space shuttle necklace!
You are amazing! ❤️
Two sentences dilated. LMFAO\nYour great!
man i love trello boards
Alright okay (supa hot fire)
I love this
Yay Hannah's trending❤
My creativity is minimal and my organisation is nonexistent... uuuggghhh 🙄😜
Yep. Sick 🤙🏼
I completely agree with you, these are the stories that keep me hooked. Two of these I have recently enjoyed: Sherlock (I know, late to the party) which is about the struggles of relating to each other even when the others capacity is lacking (be it emotionally or intellectually) and also how to cope with our own otherness (healthily and unhealthily). And then I went to the cinema to see Wind River (would highly recommend) which is about family, and how to be a family when the world takes it away from us, and how we can fight and be strong and still lose. And how that has to be ok, and we can still be considered strong! And how we can still keep living, even if we are broken!
Sounds like you'd love SJW marvel comics nowadays. Forget a good story! Where's the propaganda?
Shaka, when the walls fell.
I thought Hank was about to do the Magic trick called healed and sealed
you should totally watch the orville
Wow! I just realized this is a lot of the reason I tend to hate the synopses on the backs of books. Because they always tell you (maybe too much) about the plot, and never what the book means. Like I always get a little miffed when I read a really good book and go back and look at the synopsis and it makes the book sound so ordinary and shallow
Permission to speak freely sir?\n Space... The final frontier...These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: To explore strange new worlds...To seek out new life; new civilizations...To boldly go where no one has gone before!
It might be the other way around i.e. it's because the coke can is cold... so more gas dissolves in the liquid. If it was hotter the gas would dissolve more easily into the liquid.
Hank, I would loved to know if you have seen Mother! and your thoughts on the film.
Quick way to get the video trending lol
I am also tired of watching TV shows that are just dark and I do not care about any of the characters
I'm deeply bothered by the fact that Hank just called this a Coke when it's a Dr. Pepper....
YAS Next Gen 🖖 I'm going to be  Beverly for Halloween
THANK YOU for making this video.  A lot of movies and tv shows don't have a great plot (i.e. Moonlight - a friend of a friend literally said it was a movie where nothing happens and it made me SO ANGRY) but they are *about* something. I think projects like that are way more influential and its a shame that so many miss out because theyre looking for a plot
Ugh, and here I was just about to gut the meaning in my own stories so I could actually write them. But now I'm gonna have to go back and make the stories about more than a bunch of mercs shooting another bunch of mercs in space.
we are storytellers. write your book
Botulism can cause cans to have indents- just a head up
I think it's bacteria inside the can that could have given you food poisining
no longer the west wing world but the house of cards world. wowowowwww that was deep
Could you make a video on why your vids are alsays on trending with such low view counts
USES Coke AS A GENERIC TERM FOR ALL SODA POP\nI am so triggered right now.
Only on youtube would you worry about racism in space. Does youtube pay big youtubers to be dumbasses?
Orville or ST: Discovery... What's your preference?
I LOVE THIS VIDEO. I work hard to make all my art about something.
bf works at coke. says it doesn't have CO2 in it (which is used to make the bubbles)
Watch The Orville.  It is far from perfect, but it is a lot TNG.
I really miss the native hope in scifi. So often it's like the writers are laughing at their own premise are think that self-deprecating \n humor is the only way to seel the genre or show. I miss the genuine thoughtfulness of old scifi and the faith in humanity that it portrayed.
Could not disagree more that stories REQUIRE some deeper meaning. I always just look for stories that depict consistent characters, i.e. believable characters. I think you discover more about humanity, and yourself in turn, when you see how different people think and act. I think having a story to drive home some moral/political lesson as the most part always ends up poorly.
I'M NOT ALONE! If a show/movie/book/or even a youtuber is all about how bad the world is or people doing evil things with no deeper message, I am done with it too! I always felt like the odd one out not liking House of Cards and similar things. I don't want to add that kind of negativity to my life! I want my downtime to make me feel better about the world or help evolve my worldview! Thank you Hank for putting this into words and telling the world. I'm inspired to be truer to myself without being ashamed. Thank you ❤️. \n\nNerdfighteria helps me so much with random things like this, and is an example of the kind of content you outlined as the best, only it is an entire community too.
But you can get apple and orange juice in cans and they aren't carbonated?
Watch Master of None !!
Check out The Orville, I wasn't planning on watching it because I don't enjoy Seth Macfarlane but it's actually a really good show. It has a Interesting set of characters, once you get past the first episode it's awesome.
Why doesn't this always happen to cans of noncarbonated canned beverages like Hawaiian punch?
I truly love our president. He stands up for our country, for our people, and for the values that have made us prosper. Despite the millions of Americans who have been brainwashed against him by the mainstream media, he will undoubtedly leave the world in a better place by the end of 2024!
TNG was my star trek.😌
WHAT IS THIS VIDEO ABOUT?
Voyager is 100x better then all the other series combined.

The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!
Some of my faves off the top of my head: Measure of a Man, Darmok, Chains of Command, Time Squared, The Nth Degree, Tapestry.. oh there's too many to choose.
Dr Pepper: An intellectual drink, for the chosen ones! (Who knows what show I’m referencing?!)
I think I finally understand what all of my high school Literature teachers tried to get across to us.
from Season 4, Episode 14: You are a most unusual species - worthy of a second chance
In reply to the non-flat soda-related content I'd say there are some remaining bastions of meaning out there.  Specifically kids shows.  While I'm not going to binge watch Dora the Explorer (or whatever the newest kids show is.  I'm 36, cut me some slack),  shows with that particular target audience still do have moral of the story sorts of content.  I'd agree, though, that we need a return of broader meaning to our programming.  90's plots were sometimes paper thin, but a lot of them delivered messages in incredibly creative ways.  Some did it ham fistedly, of course.  *cough* Full House *cough*   But again, that's partly target audience.
I agree I don't always want to see how the world sucks. I want to feel hopeful and inspired.
This is such a Vlogbrothers video. Y'know what I mean? It's a little all over the place but still informative and entertaining.
Plot is just what happens, it's not important in a story. What is important is how the events influenced and shape the characters and how they feel about that. Because it makes us think of how we would feel in certain situations and if we would want things to go like that in real life.
Meaning is good and all, but man... allow yourself to read and watch stories with great intentions and meaning, but horrible plot and story structure, is incredibly frustrating.\n\nThe delivery of the message and the point is as important or even more than the message itself, otherwise you wont even bother with the damn story in the first place.
So, this justifies those stories in high school, where the plot was absolutely What-the-hell-why-did-that-happen? or Nothing-happens-in-this-book-at-all!!, yet were abundantly meaningful.
HANK! Watch Person of Interest, I think you'd really enjoy it based on what you've said here.
I seriously need to re-watch that! Like Hank, I was about 10 or so when I saw it, mostly out of order. Although I do remember being at grandmas house(I was about 4yrs old) and my brother and I would excitedly watch the intro and we'd run to the TV and put our hands over the flash of the ship when it went to warp. I don't remember why, but we loved doing that!
You just put your finger on why I miss there being new Terry Pratchett books.
Oh look, again on the trending page: a youtuber as irrelevant as Tyler Oakley and Hannah Hart
What does dr.pepper taste like? Is it anything like coke?
You just very clearly articulated something I've been struggling to put my finger on for ages. Thank you!
My birthday is in a week, and I'm getting a (probably) signed copy of TAtWD. So excited!
Have you seen the Orville yet?
I started watching TNG all over again without even realizing it was the 30 year anniversary!
I'm so surprised that Hank doesn't have more extensive knowledge about how cans of soda work. This feels like something he'd know.
(has Star Trek on other screen)
I've been rewatching Star Trek TOS and it really makes me realise how much is missing from the recent movies. The plot is there, but there's no morals, no lesson, no meaning. It's just another mindless action and that's kind of disappointing.
2:31 Well, President Bartlet was a Democrat, so maybe to Republicans _The West Wing_ seemed as amoral as _House of Cards_ ?
The West Wing was the greatest show ever.
I can’t wait to see you two in October.
Hank, are you familiar with Pareto distributions in regard to human productivity?  Is oppression the sole reason for that inequality?  Is the problem really that simple?  OR is it possible there are other forces at play that have nothing to do with bigoted oppression.
I have heard of adding a nitrogen drip to non carbonated drinks to give to thin containers or plastic strength.
OKAY WATCH THE ORVILLE!  It's basically Seth Macfarlane doing Star Trek and it's AMAAAAAZING
Steven Universe. Watch it Hank. It's about all that good stuff and more.
Hank you should watch Easy on Netflix. It doesn’t have spaceships. But it’s a really explorative, thoughtful show!
Thank you. I needed this video. You will be credited in my book, if I manage to finish writing it. Which I am now finally once again hopeful about. :D
It’s about trying to get views
I had a coke that did the same thing. not sure how it happened. but it tasted bad LOL.
DS9 was the best Trek series. By far......it's not even close.

Preach, Hank!
I preemptively liked this video.
I agree
Shaka, as the walls fell.
Why would you say Coke can when you're demonstrating the dr. Pepper
The Inner Light is an incredible, beautiful episode of TNG. Great choice.
What is this video about?
It's called a low-fill. If you make friends with people who work at breweries, they give you boxes of 'em. \n\nAbout half the box will be drinkable, which is pretty good for a free box of beers.
I love you Hank. You're videos always make me so happy
Evil people doing evil things. Yep, that was my conclusion after the first half of the first episode of GoT. Not interested.
Your distinction between plot and the meaning of a story is ultimately my issue with people who say video game have bad stories. Video games are hindered at delivering plot - players get in the way of the execution and often the solution is to put limitations on their interactions during important scenes. Games are fantastic, however, at delivering meaning, subtext, ideas and feelings. They can envelop you into a world. They can extend multiple threads of questlines, dialogue, player actions and music into an almagamation together. They can be messy and inconsistent, while still being evocative. Games are where I go now for media with ideas now. Most recently I've been enthralled by the game *Nier Automata* _which takes a sci-fi apocalypse, and makes it about the folly of determinism._
If you want to know anything about soda cans watch this watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw.\nActually I can't recommend this channel enough, just see for yourself.
This may not be a popular opinion, but I think if you’re looking for a current sci-fi show with excellent themes, I’d recommend Doctor Who, especially Series 10. That season explored themes of racism, the value of a single human life, capitalism gone wild, utilitarianism, duty, and redemption. But it’s also not afraid to take itself too seriously (one episode finds Victorians on Mars).
Hank, I love your theory about carbonation in coke cans, but I have one problem... They sell non-carbonated iced tea and lemonade in cans too. Unless they add additional pressure to these cans that they wouldn't add in a carbonated beverage, I don't know if your theory would make sense. Thanks for the videos! I've been watching for years
This video should be in the moPOP star trek exhibit
I miss the Woody Guthrie poster on the wall..

The best video I have seen from Vox, the Itza people back then were incredible and way ahead of their time. Please, keep on making videos like this one. Thank you!   \nLocation: Yucatán, Mexico Cultures: Maya civilization Periods: Late Classic to Early Postclassic Archaeological Site:  Chichén Itzá The Maya name Chichén Itzá means At the mouth of the well of the Itza.
Looks like too much speculation. I have no idea what's up with the Orion's belt @2:34, but doesn't look correct at all.
I'm calling it now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is going to be trending, and I was here before the masses
Finally! The documentaries are getting published.
what's with the editing?
Overnight I became a sun-worshipper. Well, not overnight, you can't see the sun at night. But first thing the next morning, I became a sun-worshipper. Several reasons. First of all, I can see the sun, okay? Unlike some other gods I could mention, I can actually see the sun. I'm big on that. If I can see something, I don't know, it kind of helps the credibility along, you know? So everyday I can see the sun, as it gives me everything I need; heat, light, food, flowers in the park, reflections on the lake, an occasional skin cancer, but hey. At least there are no crucifixions, and we're not setting people on fire simply because they don't agree with us.\n \nSun worship is fairly simple. There's no mystery, no miracles, no pageantry, no one asks for money, there are no songs to learn, and we don't have a special building where we all gather once a week to compare clothing. And the best thing about the sun, it never tells me I'm unworthy. Doesn't tell me I'm a bad person who needs to be saved. Hasn't said an unkind word. Treats me fine. So, I worship the sun. But, I don't pray to the sun. Know why? I wouldn't presume on our friendship. It's not polite. \n\n- G. Carlin
i m excited to see them as well, u did a great job on sharing the knowledge and experience to us
I think they were killed and raped by European Invaders.
You just restated yourself about 4 times. This video has the least amount of content
Gave up watching as the music was just too bad
white liberal travels the world
It was already abandoned, its builders unknown, when the Aztecs came upon it. They have idea who built it so they just called it City of the Gods.
BGM too loud at some places
I'm going to like it because it was amazingly produced. But moreover, because it is Mexico and I am mexican :D
I was there this February! It's amazing~~~~~~~~
See they not how many of those before them We did destroy?- generations We had established on the earth, in strength such as We have not given to you - for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave (fertile) streams flowing beneath their (feet): yet for their sins We destroyed them, and raised in their wake fresh generations (to succeed them). (6:6)\n\nGenerations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their messengers came to them with clear-signs, but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin! (10:13)\n\n But when they forgot the warning they had received, We opened to them the gates of all (good) things, until, in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts, on a sudden, We called them to account, when lo! they were plunged in despair! (6:44)\n\n How many were the populations We utterly destroyed because of their iniquities, setting up in their places other peoples? (21:11)
Ive been there before and its just tiring to climb up the stairs they were so tall
I guessing he went the entire video without mentioning how old the civilization was.
Wow, a YouTube video about a mesoamerican culture that is located in Mexico is filled with racist. That is incredibly rare. No wonder the uploader didn't mention what country it was in.
Just beautiful.  I am looking forward to more. thanks!
What do you mean by these people??
They got abducted by aliens
this guys production and choice of beats is off the fukn hook! \nerytime
Most if not all tribes in the Central Valley had an understanding of celestial movement and objects. Many of the gods were the same, tribe to tribe as well.
So hyped for the documentaries!!
I like lots this documentary
I will definitely be here to watch the docs. I've been excited waiting for them!
This looks like it was detected by Casey neistat
Maybe it wasn't a city, maybe it was a science lab that was abandoned
Interesting video. That city must have taken forever to build. Very impressive what people could do without metal tools, although the city was probably built up over several lifetimes. \nFor those talking about Europeans here in the comments, note that these people were long gone by the time Spaniards arrived.
but Vox, you didn't tell us how this is related to the U.S. and Donald Trump?
I was there I visited with my uncle and aunt it was pretty beautiful
Someone tell me how to get a job like him
0:57 she actually said where the sun sets not rises. Probably a mistake.
They were time travelers
aliens man; they were aliens!!!!
Maybe they went to mars...yo elon musk is getting a surprise
Looks like my peak design backpack. Love that thing!
Same old deal, an intelligent civilization got eliminated by another barbarian savage.
I was already impressed by those cactus hedges! I've never seen cacti like that IRL...the life of a Canadian :/
Dude Vox's not political stuff is so f*cking good\n\n(I censored the eff word please don't demonetize Vox)
Worshiping the sun is probably a better idea than worshiping a god
Uh, check that giant calendar out over there
These people were busy practicing astronomy while people in the middle east people were developing a cult based around a guy who they claimed was the 'son of god'...(6oo AD)

Those wondering where this place is, because the video forgot to mention it, it's in Mexico, just north east of Mexico City.
Pogba?
it was ALIENS
He looks like Rhett from GMM!
Impressive
I like this dude
Rhett, is that you? #mythicalbeasts

*Inserts a Giorgio Meme here* Aliens!
💚
Yes so excited I love these
cool video👍 i was actually born and raised in a town around the archeological site. keep up the awesome videos!
Spring equinox? How old is this footage?
Thank you for doing this series.
Easy with the contrast
Vox should make a video about Foo Fighters
So for the ppl who want to go but Teotihuacán doesn't ring the bell it's Mexico City. You go and ask for Teotihuacán or Pyramid of the sun and it's 2 hours away...hmm traffic may take longer... but Mexico it's wonderful.
Like the video but please improve audio levels between cut 👍
Oh yes. This is what vox should invest their money in! Quality!
Have you herd the theory that the city was an alien spaceport.
In a time where ignorance is rampant, thank you for these efforts at educating and expanding minds
how come he's always on those ancient sites without a load of tourists being there?
Where did he get the shirt at the end? It’s nice.
You make my day!!!
They knew so much about space and stars, so that people from the stars visited. The ancient culture then vanished from earth and joined the aliens. If we know what they know, then the people from the stars come.\n\nCould be a decent book/movie
at first I thought this was Rhett from Rhett and Link omg
The dude in the thumbnail looks like Rhett from Rhett & Link/GMM.
If Europeans didn't exist then we would have known why we existed.
Love it except for the valley-girl sounding ends of sentences
Doesn't even HAVE the respect to mention the name of the city in the video. White culture appropriation
I've been watching Egypt pyramid videos for the past two days, and now this video shoes up ... coincidence, it's a sign of the ancient civilisations?! Something is about to be discovered?!
T H E S U N I S A D E A D L Y L A Z E R
My family did that.
cities are huge microchips. true fact
You are amazing Mexico is amazing you should talk more about it !!!
Well... Teotihuacan was a Mexican(meshica, x is pronounced as an SH) city. The Mexican(meshican) people are known to most as the Aztecs, but that is not how they identified themselves. As far as what language they spoke, it is not a mystery. They spoke a dialect known as Nahuatl, which is still spoken by many people in mexico. But still, good video. :)
I am assuming that these are the Mayans or Aztecs. It is in Mexico I believe. This is all very interesting when you think about it. How could this people and the Mayans or Aztecs and Egyptians build similar pyramids. How can the Mayans and Chinese have the same Dragon God? This is fascinating and makes u think if aliens were involved.
The reason Mexico has so many issues is because the age of sexual consent is 12 THE HISTORY OF ALL HITHERTO EXISITING SOCIETY IS THE HISTORY OF CLASS STRUGGLES

For the millionth time, The Spaniards Murdered them.
Bullshit. Why would ancient man make such immense structures to 'keep track of time and the seasons' when all they had to do is look at the flora and fauna around them to easily tell when the seasons where changing, which they had to do anyway just to survive as hunger-gatherers. They were far more intricately connected to the seasons and biorhythm of the earth than we are; the modern mainstream archeological opinions on these kinds of structures is utterly devoid of logic. My wife is an archeologist and has been trying to fight the established status quo for years, which is to say that modern archeology doesn't formulate their theories from the evidence, rather, they have a theory before the evidence is gone through and any evidence that contradicts their theory is generally disregarded. This is even the case in paleontology, where the desire to name something or be 'the discoverer' has caused the dinosaur bones of young, juvenile, and then adult species of the same type, possibly even from the same family unit in cases where the remains were found right next to each other, be classified and named as completely separate species for over 100 years, only now being realized as bogus. There's a TED talk on youtube about that very case, just do a quick study for 'TED talk young dinosaurs'.
White people came and wiped out the population with disease that’s what happened
I'm disappointed in the fact that this is continuing to push the narrative of the mesoamerican people's mysterious disappearance. we should all be aware by now that colonization and european aggression played a huge role in the destruction of the american indigenous tribes and empires.
BUILD THAT WALL
Son una chingoneria las piramides de mexico
What happened? The European plague is what...
Please do video on India and Pakistan..your channel gave world knowledge..thanks..
Thanks Casey Neistat for making journalism into this....:(
this dudes kind of annoying? love the idea of infomational travel vids but he sounds pretentious and obnoxious?
It is just a theory...another theory is those temples were built by the Egyptians and they were portals all around the world , ancient egyptians found a way to travel all over the world by WAVES.
2:35 LOL
amazing how so many civilizations around the world create such amazing things\n\n\n\nexcept african civilizations

ah i love the japs, uchimura, what a boy. love that you guys are still friendly with your competitors even in sport where you could potentially isolate yourself from the world and just train individually.
The gravity gets weaker as you move further away from the earth's core. So you're effectively cheating. And people liking your cheating video.

what is the Bane Mask that you wear when you are warming up sometimes?
Are the world championships shown on TV??
What would you wish for? (No extra wishes! (or genies!))
My life has changed.. it's like a whole new world! 😂
Hit LIKE if you Love Aladdin ❤
Aladdin's second wish was to be saved from drowning after the guards tide him up and through him into the water. Genie said that he couldn't save him without him wishing to do so and then saved him under the assumption that Aladdin wished for it.
Lmao at the people who dont realize the intro was a joke
I agree there are some things that don't make sense, but the prince thing is explained by the zapping of his clothes, I think this is to imply that he reverses that wish :)
I dont buy that - it means he doesnt accept the branding he's been given by others... it makes perfect sense... well in British English it does
0:12 makes perfect sense to me mate
Alladdin makes sense, this video just made me confused
I would wish that I could fill anything with whatever I want. So, fill bank account, fill cup, fill baskets with food(end world hunger! :))
your problems are very superficial
Well, I kind of understand why Aladdin is a thief, he has no family or money so he has to steal food to survive. He doesn't hurt anyone or steal money or things to sell, he just steal food so he and Abu won't starve to death. If he had money or family with money then he wouldn't need to steal food to survive and thus wouldn't be a thief.\n\nThough I think he should have just been honest with Jasmine and told her who he was and why he was suddenly a prince, I mean he only made that wish because he fell for her and the law stated that Jasmine had to marry a prince, though at the end the dad made an exception because he saw that Jasmine loved Aladdin and Aladdin risked his life to save them from Jafar.
9:50  maybe he used magic to reverse the wish??????
Please watch my channel Glitchmaster Nintendo heres a link\nhttps://youtu.be/addme/ELm6ThO5akDeeG9SjZexEz8xljSIkw
It all makes sense if you believe the entire story is all fabricated by the vendor in order to convince you to buy the lamp...
I would wish that the pokemom go kid (misha) would die
I wish being in any fictional world whenever and wherever I want
This video is so good I’m watching it twice
Great video! I so agree on how it doesn't seem to make sense that Aladdin doesn't stay a prince. Unless...maybe when Jafar changed his clothes and revealed that he never was a prince (because Jasmine still thought he was a prince who just dressed as a commoner), maybe his magic took away his prince title? What do you think? But yea the Sultan's change of the law at the end almost makes the film's events have no bearing, except Aladdin's actions moved the Sultan to that decision.
I would wish for the right amount of money for every purchase
Hey cartoons don't have to makes sense
he's a prince of thieves
1. wish to be pretty\n2. wish to be smart \n3. wish to have a magic journal that can give me whatever I write down in it. then I would wish for clothes, world peace, no death, my friends to be happy, stuff like that
Aladdin, Aladdout (I got this from my classmate lol)
Well said!\nThe story of Aladdin in The 1,001 Nights is far more interesting to me, than the Disney version.
Ive been missing you guys! Either you havent been posting or I havent been getting the notifs. I havent checked yet
Y'know what does make sense? Racquetball.  What doesn't make sense is how stupid good I am at it.  Check it out here: https://youtu.be/fcrhdn-MXV4
Aladdin is the chosen one because he doesn't have nipples
The prince thing was taken away by Jafar's magic being amped up to the most powerful sorcerer ever.
My focus was completely on the half-attached-stash.
Gotta eat to live gotta steal to eat other wise we'd get along (tell you all about it when i got the time) I love Aladdin!!
According to Once Upon A Time - all magic has a price. Maybe Aladin somehow knew this and decided not to give Jasmine the lamp because Genie was his friend he didn't want to add more to the price Genie would eventually have to pay. Idk.. straws. Pulling at straws.
you need a life. you just wasted precious time in my life that I'll never get back. You are overanalyzing a damn cartoon. Ugh
That one really makes me think.... Like did genie just wish an entire country into existence for Aladin? And what happens to that country now that Aladin isn’t governing it?
Hey I have the same shirt as you!!
I live in Roanoke and I want to see u guys, my world geography teacher is some how connected with you guys...?...
Maybe diamond in the rough is a translation issue. Maybe it was rough diamond.
“Most” of the rugs can’t even fly?
This video is in the dictionary next to overthinking.
I just realized how weird the concept of a sand tiger that's the entrance to a huge magic cave is. Why have I always just accepted the cave of wonders??
I was going to have voldemort plan my wedding but after reading the reviews I see he isn't much of a wedding planner. So I decided to hire George RR Martin instead.\n\nAlso why not after she makes her wishes she hands it to the sultan who would wish for his daughter's happiness, his country to prosper and the genie be free?
IS THAT A WTNV POSTER I SEE?
He steals food!!! Stealing to eat is diamond in the rough material! (Says Disney)
I need help spreading this to these guys, in UP when they first start walking the house. There are stones cut in PERFECT rectangles like an old walkway. Its only where they first start walking and it quickly goes back to the wind/water carved stone thats huge flowing in appearence. I think between the walkway type look, the area, and the chocolate loving fast tropical bird, i think they might be making allusions to the central american indigious people amd their beliefs and culture.  The chocolate, the bird, and the messenger roads. Many thanks if the brothers team sees this and looks into, wether i am right or wrong, never saw the path style in the movie before...
Aladdin is only seen stealing produce and bread, all of which are the kind of things that get spoiled and thrown out. those guys are trying to behead him because he is eating their trash without paying for the privilege. he's not a paying customer who chooses not to pay. he's a guy who isn't going to pay, who chooses to eat anyway, knowing that the only harm it does is in a theoretical sense where it undermines the rules that keep us all fed, which they don't do for him.\n\nRiff Raff?\nStreet Rat?\nI don't buy that.\nit's just a social construct, man.
What about his parents????
I know commenting on these types of videos is pretty pointless, but whatever.\n\nAladdin never wished to be a prince. He wished for the genie to MAKE him a prince. All the events for the rest of the film constitute the genie's convoluted plan to fulfill that wish. Aladdin was not a prince until he married Jasmine, because he never asked to be a prince, he asked to be made into one.\n\nThe cave scene is most likely an homage to the original tale from 1001 Arabian Nights, which is why it doesn't make a lot of sense nor have consistent rules. If you've ever read the book, you'll recognize the feel of it. Magic being fickle, dangerous, full of lies and half-truths is a very central theme to the Arabian Nights stories - genies are not supposed to be good guys. From my memory of the original stories, I might even say it's more likely that the genie engineered the entire cave debacle specifically to lure in the type of person he knew would eventually free him. He claims to be imprisoned in the lamp, but genies are deceptive. Does he ever say he can't use magic while in there? If no, then he made the cave. The whole movie is him trying to get Aladdin on his side so he'll be freed. And if this were anything like the original stories, Aladdin would be brutally murdered the second he freed the genie.
I need only one wish: omnipotence. If you don't know what that is, look it up. And it technically isn't cheating.
I'd wish for the ability to have exact change appear in my pocket when I buy things, a sonic screwdriver, and for pockets that are bigger on the inside.
Still, it kinda makes no sense, because it's very coincidental that Aladdin just so happened to be the one person on EARTH to enter the cave, and just so happened to be in the same city and proximity as Jafar, so that he doesn't have to take a long time to find this one person on earth. Jafar must be super lucky.
Money\nSuperpowers \nSave the last one
I would wish that all the rules would no longer be relevant, therefore cheating the system making it possible to wish for infinite wishes, therefore, winning the game of life
Recently watched the movie and one thing I don't get is the carpet ride Jasmine takes with Aladdin.  Assuming that they got back on the same night it makes me wonder how fast the carpet was going, clearly not the same speed throughout the trip because of the slow river ride.  Going to all these places: the desert where the horse are running, Egypt where the Spinx was being build, Greece where the statues are which look like the ones in Hercules, and China where the fireworks are going off with a dragon before returning to the palace.  I get that most of the places I listed they did not actually stop and check it out but it's the great distance along with the very short time frame that is tripping me up.  Did they leave the palace when it was late at night because all of these other places are experiencing nighttime and when they got back it is still nighttime at the palace because Agrabah would be experiencing daylight when they got back from China or did they just skip a day and came back the next night if this is the case then how is it that no one notice them gone for so long especially Jasmine's father who is pressuring Jasmine to marry a prince before her birthday which is less than three days away because it is the law.  Very hard to wrap this one around the brain.
Maybe once Aladdin wished to be a prince, his father in some other part of the country/land got promoted to King of Thieves....
According to djafars plan: Man, would you go into a cave you KNOW you're gonna die in because you're no 'diamond in the rough'? That would be ridiculous! I mean, he can hypnotize other people AND he got the sultans guard on his side. Simple as that: Get a thief to steal the lamp. Poissibility number 1: thief fulfills the deal and gives djafar the lamp. Number 2: thief doesn't hand over lamp so he has to hypnotize him. If this doesn't work - send the guards. Finally - IF all of these possibilities doesn't work for djafar he can still kill the thief - who would miss him anyway? Sounds logical to me ;)\n\nOh and Aladin keeps his purity of character because he steals because he has to - not because he wants to. He's not a rotten character, he just had very bad luck (remember? Dead mom, bad father who left for adventure and hab the time of his life - midlife crisis?)\n\nThe part about Aladin being a prince is also very simple. You have to be VERY specific with wishes because there still is room to be interpreted. The only logical option is that Aladins wish made the illusion of a prince. The wish at the end would have needed to be more detailed to let him be a real prince with everything with it.
My first wish would be to have the estate of my dreams. for me and my girlfriend to move into asap.\nsecond I'd wish for a treasure large enough for my family present and future to be able to live on until the end of time.\nthird I would wish for the genie to be free.
Why do people want to poke holes in movies,stories, ect...? If all you do is look for flaws in everything, how will you notice the good? Movies are for entertainment.  Everyone knows it's just a movie! So sit back,and enjoy the ride ;)
5:50 sounds like Simon from Alvin and the chipmunks :O
Anybody else unable to reply to SuperCarlinBrothers' comment? I can reply to any other comment, but not that one or its replies.\n\nEDIT: My wish would be for my genie to forget that they ever gave me my the wishes the next day 😜
My explanation: The royal status in a person doesn't physically exist. It's only that people acknowledge them as royal. When Jafar exposed the fact that he is really a street rat, his status is lost because no one no longer acknowledge him as a prince since he got that status from the genie.
My wish would be for my hogwarts letter to arrive ( I'm still waiting I'm sure my owl just got lost )
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable.\n\nAnyone get my Hamilton references?\n#HAM4HAM
I would wish for my mom to have an easy and happy life. She has worked so hard to bring me up and always gets the short end of the stick. An abusive marriage, depression, poverity. She worked 4 jobs to support us. Just want her to be happy.
Who disturbs the comments section? It is I Diacomical!
7:36... You should make a video called, Are Pinocchio and Aladdin, related?
1 i would wish for me and everone in world to be immortal2 i would wish to be the best at everthing 3 i would wish for the ability to make anhone love me
I think the diamond in the rough thing means that since he's in a bad situation in his life but he's kind hearted is pretty rare like a diamond
I would wish for:\n1) I win every bet I agree with\n2) everything works in my favor in any situation anytime (subconsiously as consiously)\n3) I wish that I would always know what would be the best choice in every situation anytime (subconsiously as consiously)\nWould that make me the ultimate human?\nDid I do it right mom?
(The perfect wish no strings or subtracting condition.) The power to do what I want, when I want, where I want, why I want, how I want, to who I want, without answering to anyone except God and Mother Nature which I already know what they sound like at least un so far as speaking to me.
I suppose you were making a joke in the intro... but it was terrible, and just made you look like an idiot.
I'd wish to become an all powerful genie. My second wish would be to be set free. Don't even need a third wish, what up haters.
I have the shield in the background
I'd wish for more genies
Wayyy too much time on your hands, “bro”. Embarrassing.
i perfectly UNDERSTOOD IT WHEN I WAS A KID AND I STILL DO BUT I CANT PUT IT INTO WORDS
Well actually as sultan, jafar had the power to revoke royalty, so he undid the genie's wish
Neither does Pinocchio... Who takes their fish and cat to look for a wooden boy??
You're just saying the plot of the movie without these things that makes no sense it wouldn't even be the movie like all movies don't really make sense
my dad used to have a real persian rug in his house and he said it got stolen so yeah they're pretty expensive if they get stolen
Wish 1: Ability to bend reality to my will, without having to become a genie.\nWish 2: That no one, or creature, or thing, including myself, can take this reality bending power away from me.\nWish 3: That no other person, creature, or thing, can make the same wishes that I have just made, including this third wish.\n\nFirst is the real wish. Second is security, so that my powers are never lost. Third is insurance so that no one/nothing else can become as powerful as I am... even though I could have probably set the security and the insurance myself...\n\nI can now grant my own wishes.
Or Jafar could have hypnotized the Cave of Wonders into letting him take the lamp, lol XD
A lot of old aircraft like a travel air and a pietenpol
Don't be messing with my favorite Disney movie but you know what I still love you PS I'm so glad you guys are 44 and trending Ive watched you since the beginning
The reason Aladdin is the chosen one is because he's not stealing just for the fun of it, he's stealing to survive. Meaning also that he wasn't stealing for his own gain and for selfishness! Duh! How do you not know this?
Ya and neither do the majority Disney movies
Money, Health and my own magic powers but not be a genie.
I think it's time to take a break. You are thinking to hard on this on.\n\nPS you all wrong.
Flying carpets! Alladin doesn't make any sense at all!!! Probably cos its a Disney cartoon...
You should join Cinemasins (Y)

Ur forhead makes no sense
Its a cartoon......
Fam he's so shook, XD
GIVE MEE THE LAMP 😂😂😂😂
I'd wish for the Walt instatly built just to see how trump would react
Natalie Portman needed more meat in her bones to be believable in this role.
stop doing whatever your doing and watch some Zachary Zimmer
All I see is people complaining hollywood this, hollywood that. Shut up. You're no expert. You're annoying.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I invite all reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. We've always believed God rested on the 7th Day, but what about after that day? \n With All Of My Heart what I found is NOT Click Bait. All I ask is, after you watch, that you please take a few moments to consider just who God is before you comment. I can prove to anyone, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT, this proves it. Several times I've asked different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please I'm begging you to Help me Share this with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
Annihilation? I like the sound of that.
Can you describe it?  And she answers, No.\n\nLike, uh... transluminescent with rainbow colored light patterns/fractals undulating in a polymorphic crystalline structure exhibiting reactionary intelligence.
So basically the planet absorbed people and turned them into plants... Next.
I never imagined that they would be able to make a movie out of this, so surprising!
It's a Trilogy.series so hopefully it does well. be the 1st for portman
It has Begun Mortal Kombat ding ding ding da da da bing bing bing Mortal Kombat annihilation
I think this is from the writer & directer of Ex Machina
I have always wanted a good nature-based horror movie.
Looks like an Arrival inspired movie.
Another strong woman movie. Great.
Oh my god an orignal ip that looks good
I guess Thor will save her....
I AM SO PUMPED FOR THIS HELL YEAH
Is this movie sf?
It's very simple:\nLéon: The Professional 1994\nNatalie Portman played Mathilda\n\nAnd I've watched every movie she's in in since. & Natalie Portman + Sci Fi = take my $
This has something to do with AVATAR? ....in some dark-weird way?
Too vague to perk my interest. NEXT!
Hey guys please subscribe to my channel ❤️❤️
Sooo, The Happening but with a more pro-active form of deadly plant basically...
new movies scare me there just way to real
this trailer looked so cool that I bought the book series, halfway through the second book now and I'm loving it!! has a real HP Lovecraft doom and unknowable terror vibe
Is this the new Ghostbusters?
Looks kinda ok. Wrong actor for the main role
Annihilation? This could only mean...\n\n*MORTAL KOMBAT*
This is the kind of movie I need Hollywood!!!!
Getting a Color out of Space vibe from this, looks good
I feel like Natalie Pittman is too pretty and not muscular enough to play the biologist but I'm hoping for the best.
Looks like she is losing the will to live
Lovely garden!!
Mortal kombat ?
FLOP.............
Song
God fucking dammit does she have an ouroboros tat? UGH
Reminds me of Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker.
looks like aliens terraforming earth. good job ET
❤ Natalie Portman
I actually read this novel in february. I think the story will be much better as a movie! Not that the novel was particularly bad, but... Fingers crossed :)
0:14 _There's a problem on the horizon... There's no horizon!_ No, K2SO, there can only be the Car Wash of the Apocalypse!
I loove this, it looks very diverse!!!
Looks weird, I doubt it's any good.
HELPING YOU! Comment below if you need my subscription!
Finally a trailer without revealing the plot so much that it ruins it
I hope she gets naked.
I need someone to ya know get me off
It looks like the earth and plants are intelligent and are fighting back
I better smoke a blunt before walking in to see this movie!
Um Natalie Portman is the most beautiful actress to exist.
Like for a tbh!
Who thinks they'll tease you with its identity until the last two minutes? he he
Is there a soundtrack for this? What's the music for this trailer???
Hey 0:35 it's they one fat Asian guy from prey
benny wong is everywhere this year!
I prefer to think of it as From the Writer of Sunshine and 28 Days Later instead of Ex Machina.
In the future could an AI robot that\ngets super smart to a  a god like state,  be the future Antichrist or Beast of the book\nof Revelation ???   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs_HhZrCBdg

This gave me nothing what the actual fuck is the movie about
Damn even xerneas is in the movie!
First Sci Fi movie I was excited about since Ex Machina
The japanese guy it's Alex Yu from Prey. COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT!
Does she finally get her fucking tits out, or is she just going with the same old I'm constipated look shit.
Should be interesting.  But I doubt very much it will fit the tone of Roadside Picnic, let alone the Stalker series.  Not outside of There's a crazy zone and wacky metaphysics happens!\n\nRoadside picnic style, you've got non military stalkers making a buck off the insanity of a cruel but (mostly) manageable zone, as everything slowly spirals out of control between looking for deeper answers to the underlying mystery they may never know.\n\nYou don't dramatically exclaim My husband was sent on a suicide mission! and then just walk into spooky science land without so much as a gas mask.\n\nThis is NOT LOL gonna suck!. But anybody hoping for a Roadside Picnic fix is gonna need to keep looking. They will just fine a good but unrelated sci-fi movie. With more emphasis on the 2 spooky for the human mind phenomenon, than the horrors of the unknown just being your dangerous day job until you ask yourself was it worth it?
Trailer before trailer is for ads so people don't skip after 5 seconds

I have absolutely no idea what's going on from this...
It has a STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl wibe I like it.
Looks good! I rather enjoyed Arrival. Which was a otherworldly sci fi. And Ex Machina was really good. \nSo, the movie obviously has a twist/obligatory ending.\nJust don't come out during Black Panther. I'll watch both but average moviegoers might not
When was the last time you heard of a novel that wasn't acclaimed or best selling?
Very reminiscent of the movies by Oats studio!
This may be similar to the part of the Dark Continent (HxH) where Brion the plant weapon lives
Looks cool, but I'm going to assume the plot simplifies out pretty fast. Alien force turning us all into Gaia. That's my guess.
from the creator of one hyped up crappy movie ... NOW another hyped up crappy ass flick
milk truly sounds like   sncrtspot  XD
This looks pretty intense 🙈

Did your Helio 300 come with a bracket and cable for the second hard drive? Their reviews on Amazon are getting bombed from them being consistently missing with their support team unsure if they'll ever get more. It's been holding me back from picking it up.

If you watch closely the flags, when he runs at the track, you can see that all the countries, which the flags show are in the Balkan peninsula in Europe.
Omg sza😍😍
Reminds of their other song Don't Wanna Know
the CGi is god awful but the music is amazing
Interesting. North Korea shouldn’t nuke US, or they will get fucked up.
BMDS more like BDSM
Blah blah blah... stfu
4:19 WTF?????..... OMG.... Heavy breathing.....
https://youtu.be/m6MOaECL6FM
Being worried about North Korea, is like being afraid of the boogie man. What you should really be afraid of is Russia. That's like having herpes, except this herpes can actually kill you.
How to prevent WW III:\n1) Buy Twitter\n2) Shut it down
Are we just ignoring the fact that Democrats derailed the missile defense shield just because they hated Ronald Reagan and America? Reagan and every Republican since wanted to fully fund and push for a missile defense shield, but the Democrats just didn't like him and were traitors to America, so they derailed and defunded the missile shield. Obama was  the latest Democrat to do so. Now North Korea wants to launch missiles at us, and we don't have a full scale missile shield.
The way to stop North Korea is to get the loud mouth loser Chump trump to STFU and for the USA to mind its own crappy problems at home and stop trying to tell the DPRK what to do ! \n The USA government is the problem not North Korea or Iran or Syria !
When the warheads are deployed in space you have basically no chance. when they are coming than with 4km/s or 14400km/h. Also It's very unlikely that a nation only fires 1 ICBM. each ICBM can have up to multiple warheads.
heres how you stop NK missile\n\n\n*Read more*
Next up\nHow to stop the imperialism and warmongering of America
noway to stop. all those for show selling story selling arms. try flying.
I want the plan to go wrong so they can't nuke
The fact that this video has been made tells us something about the state of the world right now. Though it's to be expected that when two insane retarded children have a catfight, someone will suffer.
How to stop Stop north korea nudes \n1. Suck your own dick
4:25.....WTF was that?   was that just floating around on micro rocket bursts?
NK starting a nuclear war with the US is like a guy with one snow ball starting a snowball fight vs someone with a few thousand snowballs.
I thought we just look at it
How can we stop this USrAel terrorism!\nThe world do not need this Rockefeller rothschild capitalism warfare
We are Russia we have superior technology!!!
What if a North Korean sub sneaks through Mexican waters and fires a Missile there? Then What?\nWe got San Diego the Pacific Fleet in danger.
Thaad cannot intercept an ICBM and be useless for protecting mainland USA
It would be suicide for NK to engage in nuclear warfare with the US. Kim Jong Un might not care about his citizens but he still would want to keep his country.
You know shits gonna get ugly when you get these kinds of videos recommended
Let them have their nukes.\nThey are not stupid enough to use them.
Pull the pin and throw it back...?
If NK launched a real nuke, whether it hits its target or not, NK would have been turned to a smoldering wasteland before their missile even reached the terminal stage.
wow, storyblock is amazing!
The Israeli Arrow-3 is way better than THAAD and was developed with a fraction of the cost.
North Korea uses their Nuclear Stockpile to sustain their stability in the world stage. The Nuclear weapons are to keep the US at bey, as well as giving off a possible threat of 'nuking' South Korea or Japan to keep their stance on Global Power. North Korea wouldn't dare to launch a 'ICBM' or Nuclear Weapon at the US. However, the US fear of North Korean nuclear usage would keep the US from directly conflicting NK. As well as keeping the Kim Regime standing.
North Korea doesn't want to nuke, or fight, with the US.  \nNorth Korea only wants to frighten the US enough so that they, North Korea, can retake South Korea.  If the US gets involved in such a war, North Korea will lose but if North Korea can scare off the US (or at least delay it) it could win. Will the US be willing to possibly get Seattle or L.A. nuked to save South Korea?  North Korea doesn't think so.
Here's how to stop a North Korean Missile:\n\n\n\nBomb them before
It's pronounced THAAD, not TARD.
Aegis -- THAAD -- Patriot (PAC-3)
Fearmonger\nWarmonger
press f
Impeach Trump, that's how.
Nuke em first
Don't.
Plot twist\n\n\n\n\nNk ICBM are all fake
Nuke them first
Donald Trump: Send nukes\n\nKim Jong Un: Ok\n\nDonald Trump: Nudes*\n\nDonald Trump: O shit
I dunno ask Colin furze
the best way is to Jail Trump.
may i know who and what iran and nokor is backmailing??? tell me which countries are the nokor and iran is threatening to nuke unless they give what. isn't it the other way around? other countries like the usa and her allies are blackmailing iran and nokor to give up their nukes or else get demolished! may god damn you warmongerers!
lol I bet the Koreans are watching this right now and making another plan to fuck USA
Lmao North korea complete the Manhattan Project.
How come you did not mention the EKV system?
Great video! I've been reading that they are working on a drone armed with a laser that can knock down a ballistic missile in the boost phase. That is when it is vulnerable - when it is slowest and no decoys can be deployed.
UMAD Kim Jon Un?
Sign complaint rather lose Italian inside
What happens when a nuclear ICBM is intercepted, does it blow up and still emit a bunch of radiation?
Fuck america bech mader fuck

WHAT IS THIS?!! WHY AREN'T YOU PEOPLE PAYING ATTENTION TO IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE THE ALLEGED SUBLIMINAL RACISM OF CHILDREN'S STORIES?
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SDI OR STAR WARS? HOW MUCH IF ANY OF IT WAS DEPLOYED?
It wont happen. Just bullshit in name of nothing. Chine set the rules there and wont let it happen. Otherwise a new Korea north and south come together as one economy and massively grown as territory. Since South Korea produces technology, there you can find Samsung headquarter. Never in this short decades an invasion ou a peaceful union between them will happen. Its just the fear they want you to be real. Once again it shows that the era of corporations world wide is the new order. Welcome to the ilusion of true. Just a bunch of idiots raised by their dog grandmothers that  started our technology with the goal to create the most powerful circus in the world. If you can buy coca cola there, means... Corporations runs the show, because cause all the countries in the world just cant political 'help them' but still, North Korea gives money back to  North America consume that slaves us to support the rich stay cool.
What about dummy rockets to overwhelm the defense system? Isn't that a thing? NK might be able to do that... ?
You have to play Rick and morty musically's in order to stop a North Korea nuke
Reminds me of Missile Command...a game that couldn't be beat.
Send over a TR3B and smash the surface with our kinetic cannon...
Wait did I hear that right, $149 = modest fee?  Maybe it's just that I'm unfamiliar with video making  but wouldn't google.com provide you the same material but for a real modest fee of free?
yet how to stop american drone bombs raining down on children, on civilians, on poor unprotected people in a school, hospital, a marriage or even the side walk .. Assholes like you never make films about the reality .. always hoodwinking .. copying third grade graphics and hollywood trailers .. pathetic trash Duh Engineering Crap !
THAAD isn't even the main BMD weapon. \n\nThe Standard Missile 3 is. \n\nThe SM 3 has a top speed of mach 15+\n\nWe also have various kinetic options.\n\nAnd then there are the lasers.
Thats easy. Just send a commando team to cut the rubber band on their slingshot.
Wouldn't a physical impact on the warhead create what is basically a dirty bomb with a cloud of shredded plutonium in the athmosphere
How to stop a North Korean missle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't do anything
Somebody needs to shoot that asain baby in his fuckin brain
Threath such as Russia... realy?? What about threath such as US?? You are so bias.\nAs I remember only country in the world that used nukes against humanity is US!!!
I think one of the worst parts is usually a nuclear blast sets off an EMP. Which would destroy most electronics.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
You can't stop whats coming.
It actually made me more hopeful about interception, because I knew it was hard to intercept, but maybe it's not near impossible to stop a warhead flying at 7 km/s.
Even they would lunch rocket to whatever country, NK will be obliterated and all regime will end. so they not stupid. They only want to protect they regime.
No way to stop it ,,,,, my goodness.. are we going to die?????????????
Honestly,i dont put too much trust into BDS's,from what I've read online they are a huge money drain and barely work at all.\n\nShooting down ICBM's is often compared to shooting down a bullet with another bullet,only difference is that this bullet is travelling several times the speed of sound and has up to 16 different warheads,some of which can be used as decoys.\n\nI've also read that Russia developed new missiles that can withstand smaller yield nuclear blast from 500m,so its not just a bullet,it is a bullet proof bullet.\n\nIt looks that avoiding the nuclear exchange is still our best option.
It's not gonna happen! Stop!
How to stop a North Korean nuclear missile:\n1. invent time travel\n2. go to 1953\n3. turn loose MacArthur\n4. no North Korea, no nuclear missiles.
How to discuss people... make biased videos about trending topics
Jeez. This stuff scares me. I wish that all humans would just work together instead of fighting. There are other things we should worry about other than each other.
You haven't mentioned the Israeli interception systems, that's too bad because their tech is pretty advanced on this field
You forgot our first and most important line of defense against a nuclear attack: diplomacy. If NK gets to the point where they are actually launching missiles, millions will die. Of course most of theses deaths would be North Koreans, but that is still an unacceptable outcome. I'm glad that we have defenses that might work against ICBMs but I'd rather live in a world where they are unnecessary.
lasers is the only thing that comes to mind as a reliable way of shooting everything down, but then we would need a farm full of fusion reactors to power enough lasers to make sure nothing keeps flying
The problems of low iq ppl are caused  weed doe, it
sorry you are a liar thad is proven to be useless
Since the North-Koreans are brainwashed to think a Kim must be in control of their country it would be a smart move by the us to place Kim Basinger as the country's new dictator (friendly to the west) once the regime has been removed.
Israel also has a pretty nice track record of missile defence systems. The Iron Dome, laser defence, David Sling, Arrow Block 2 and now Arrow Block 3.
One could start by not provoking them constantly... That's a start.
You can't unless it is intercepted before reaching above atmospheric levels. Once a ICBM enter sub-orbit there is no way to stop the nuclear tip coming down into Earth at mach speed.
Every war is like a game of rock paper scissors oh shit.  Im boss at rps and ill beat every country that tries me.
I propose new technology: Force fields to stop ICBMs.
Realistically, we only fear North Korea because they have nukes, but realistically, if they fire one at us, theyre most likely dead, we have many more missiles and nukes than they do
Yes but how can we stop someone trying to stop a North Korean nuke??
I live in Canada so why am I watching this
Here’s how you stop a nuke:\n\nCall Superman
kill all americans. so there will be no americans left for north koreans to shoot their nukes at.\n\n#Genius.
We need balance , USA did so many bad things.
just imagine nukes don't exist, and they have been lying to you, now stop imagining
we need to kill kim jong un soon im sick of his bullshit and im tired of being afraid of his sorry ass
Thank you for this. This glimpse into the reality that exists in the BVI right now does not exist, and people need to see this to understand. Thanks Sam.
Good stuff Sam. Thankfully Antigua was spared and is trying to help our neighbors. All the best.
What I don't understand is why there has been no preparation for this? For an island that regularly experiences hurricanes why are the buildings not being built with concrete and bricks? Why are the roofs not strapped? Why are the boats not pulled into dry docks? There is usually 10+ years between big hurricanes but it seems very little preparation if any has been done.
Thanks so much for supporting this beautiful people in  need , thanks a million Sam.
I'm so appreciate for your good works. Keep going Sam.
Thank you from Singapore! Is internet connectivity restored +Sambranson  ?
Thankyou for documenting this.Gives good insight on whats happening in BVI.Am grateful there hopeful and grateful to be alive.It will get better with time.
How can I physically get involved and help in person, for an open amount of time, not a vacation? I am strong, multi-talented, and can do so many things, like help rebuild, with many carpentry skills, as well as cook, teach the children., an artist that can beautify the current environment they have.  Do you know of anyone who would be organizing volunteers?  Love to all on BVI.\nThank you for your honest and touching video.
Hi Sam. Great video. I’m devastated by what has happened. I want to know what I can do to help. My friends run sunchaser scuba and I was over there just in May / June. The pictures I’m seeing are horrifying and bring me to tears each time. 😢 how are the animals in the sanctuary on Necker doing and on VG?
Keep up the positive work Sam! Proud of you taking care of other and yourself. Stay safe and continue to have high spirits! Help is on the way! If you need a Master Electrician I'm always around! Don't look back and continue to build for a better future!
Sad to see such devastation but amazing job Sam going in to help! The world needs more people like yourself! Keep safe and positive. Hard times can have an effect on the brain too so take care of each other and you! Heads high and help is coming soon!
Help's coming.  Great job keeping hope alive Sam.
Thank you for this video. My niece is in St John living it & volunteering. Pictures can't show what they're experiencing but this gives us an idea.  God Bless you!
These people care about one thing, Living.\nMeanwhile, arrogant Americans in the USA fighting over everything from skin color to kneeling to a slave song (National Anthem)\nPeople in the USA mind is fucked up. Most, not all
Wonderful documentary showing the resilience of these beautiful people and the strength of community in the face of such devastation. Thank you Sam Branson ! Shared to several groups...
Amazing story. Keep up the good work!
Thank you so much Sam for your big heart. This is a very moving video. Be blessed for reaching out to your community. The people also seem to genuinely love you. Thank you for reaching out and for sharing this with the world. #bvistrong
For a greener,stronger and more positive Virgin Islands! Amazing people! Stay safe Caribbean!
Love this..Thanks for sharing your good work!
Oh my goodness!  I knew it was bad but not this bad.  Thank you so much Sam for sharing this and giving an insight into how devastating the situation is.  God Bless you for your efforts to help these people.
Honestly this is just DC being inconsistent and showing favoritism to him, we always show DC showing favoritism to Batman and Superman even when it doesn’t make sense.
You said it best. This is why I love your channel. 👍🏻
Of course he is, as well as the majority of DC characters! \n\nThat was the defining difference between DC and Marvel, until Marvel decided to make their characters o.p. as well. \n\nSentry, WWHulk, Blue Marvel, etc. \n\nDC characters have for the most part been way more powerful, with the exception of Aquaman.\n\nThe Flash alone should be able to stop most crime in the DC universe. \n\nI preferred Marvel to DC because of that difference, now there's no point!\n\nWeaker characters presents more vulnerability, more relatable stories. \n\nGranted some exceptions exist, Kingdom Come and others have showed with the right wrighter, there's no hero too powerful!
Superman is fucking awesome I don't care how strong he is
No he's not op. He evolves just like any other villain or superhero
i consider superman to be overpowered but mostly just because of the landscape he falls into. there are a few beings in DC that make regular appearances that are close to superman on power level (wonder woman,martian manhunter, etc.) but most of them are friends and the others he beats like all the time. he has very few challengers that pose a threat to him, that is why i think he is OP
Of course he's overpowered he's a friggin god he needs to be nerfed or killed off at least for a while...nuff said
He looks like louis litt from suits
No after all every single one punch man villian can beat the whole justice league...including superman
I am not a fan of superheros that don't have a stake in the problems they solve. The entire earth could get obliterated and Superman would be totally fine. Sure he might fight for people he cares about but when he fights there are hardly any things that can stand up to him and yet he still gets kicked around a lot. He's so powerful he feels distant and unrelatable.
Why is this even a question???
I have always loved Superman for the exact reasons you gave. He is supposed to be that unreachable pure good. An example of the best of us. He doesn't have to be dark and broody because there are other heros for that. It's the contrast of his light versus Batman's dark that make their paring and relationship so compelling. I really wish that the current movies would depict Superman in the character's classic light. I love Henry Cavil for the role, I don't think the direction he took with Superman is his fault. That's a combination of writers, producers and the director.
Is Superman faster than the Flash??
I think the incredible hulk is way worse too over powered
Is one punch man overpowered?
He only squeeze away a solar system because of Mxypilik's Influence.
this guy just wants views... he has done about a dozen videos on why supes is the strongest
If he can die from kryptonite it doesn't matter about his power
Did you just make this political? Sorry, I really loved your videos...unsubscribed.
Just loose Martian Manhunter on him. Superman himself called him the most powerful being on earth. It would barely be a fight, and it would be glorious- especially because the big S is such a lame, vanilla hero. \nI mean, MMH has the power of intangibility- Superman couldn't even hit him.
Yeah take away the flying ability he never had in the comics till cartoons showed up and he'll be much more balanced. Besides he's an illegal alien ;D
That's why Superman is the icon of superheroes.
BS spiderman is essentially the same when it comes to embodiment of hope and he isn't a ultra god
That's why he's Superman,man you know what I mean man.
This should be a 5 second video. \n\nIs Super-man overpowered? \n\nYes.\n\nEnd of video
Limit of Superman is bat preptime
im not saying Superman IS overpowered but only naming Gods, or anything/one close to the level of a god, when talking about who would beat Supes, only strengthens the argument for him being OP.
One above all is overpowered superman doesnt even come close to him
He’s Jewish so yes very powerful
Nice job making it to #13 on trending
Everything you said is true but you missed one thing: kryptonite.
Goku over Superman yeah I said it.
Who is stronger? Dr Manhattan or Silver Surfer?
Superman sucked when I was a kid for that reason alone, too powerful. Still sucks...
One punch man vs. Superman. I’ll wait
superman can't beat flash!!!🙃
He got beat by an orphan with trust issues dressed in a bat costume with the underwear on the outside. He’s not overpowered.
for the character he represents he is definitely NOT overpowered
YOU JUST SUCKED SUPERMAN'S DICK FOR 5 MINUTES AND 28 SECONDS
Nope but all the Batman fan boys will think so. And will totally over look all the heroes who are much stronger than him.
You really need to talk about this with Angry Joe.....quite an interesting debate IMO. I sure win fo views.
Overpowered? I can give you one character that could kill him in one punch without effort
No i do not believe he is overpowered, not at all. what i don't like about his storyline is how almost nothing goes wrong for him and even if something goes wrong it goes round and becomes alright like nothing happened, of course it comes at the cost of innocent victims but dc makes it look like that it is perfectly alright as long as superman has everything goes right for him. remember how he was dead after doomsday fiasco and came back to life and resumed his life like it was never over at the cost of city of metropolis? yeah i am talking about that bullshit. bullshit stopped with new 52 but then we got rebirth.....
Not as op as batman's plot armour, though...
One punch that all it take for super man to be done
pls do a video of black canary vs black widow or history of black canary/black widow
Yes and that's the point, but there's kryptonite.
One punch man beats both Goku and Superman then went back to bed. Nuf said
Nope, hardly galactic and needs special powers to be universal+\n\nJust a middle level guy in the grand scale of comics, the same way Goku is just middle in the grand scale of anime/manga
Christopher Reeve I love those comics where they drowe Superman looking similiar to Christopher Reeve...
The character of Superman is just flawed. That's why many comic heroes and villains have increased in popularity while Superman is just there.
super man lame , as you can see the movies are the worst comic book movies. Superman is a lame goodie goodie thats story makes awful movies. Thats why wonder woman was so much better. F Superman...
He is as strong as he needs to be to get the job done
of course superman is over powered. have you read any superman comic? he can hold a star in his hand. wtf!!! 😒
History of quake , poison ivy , the hellfire club and the blue lantern core !
He was for sure golden age superman is the most OP character ever that is why they ret-coned him. I think it really got in the way of good stories in the past but superman can always be more interesting.
Apparently not if he struggled against Batman 🙄 I still won't ever accept that that was a even real fight lol
Superman can get taken down by magic and kryptonite. Not a God.
No, he lost against Batman. Then again Batman is the most overrated character.
Yes, Superman is overpowered. But just because he can punch reality, doesn't mean he can punch Beerus. Beerus destroyed half a planet with his fingernail. He could touch Superman and half of his body would explode. Not to mention Hakai, which is a technique only possessed by the Gods of Destruction to wipeout any being from existence. Beerus The Destroyer isn't about being a symbol of hope, he's about being symbol of destruction. We haven't even seen Beerus's true power and probably never will because he's a god of destruction with the experience  of 1000 years under his belt.
If I’m not meant to be OP.., then I wouldn’t be Superman..:/
Well Kryptonite is his weakness. Pretty big one. I don't think he's that OP because even a weak human could beat him using it.
No I just wish that Batman killed him in Batman Vs. Superman
Next video topic is Batman over rated? I'm kidding don't worry but it'd make for an interesting video.
To answer your question OBVIOUSLY
For the people that think this is bad, or ''Alien X'' would win (BEN 10) he wouldn't because Superman could go Superman Prime, which is a Superman like this, but A LOT more, plus Prime has a green lantern ring (that's a character by itself!). Oh I forgot, he can manipulate time and galaxies too, and brink back the dead as gods, break the Source Wall (DC's space's , yes, outer space, edge. Which is guarded by trillions of guards).
I think Mr Oz is actually the superboy in reign of the supermen. He became strengthened during crisis on infinite earths, infinite crisis and new the 52, so he created a pocket universe to hide. He's gone bitter over the fact that the new 52 universe forgot him until he found out that Doctor Manhattan took ten years away from the new 52 universe. And therefore is building a new army.
NIBBA you already stated 69 times that superman is a benchmark for all superheros and should be op, come on maann
YES, HE'S O.P. \nThat's why he's so fuckin boring!
The Justice League/Unlimited cartoon from the mid-2000s was the best on screen depiction of Superman. He was stronger than everyone else but not by much. \nAlso had the best superman personality too.\nThe Nicest man you'll ever meet. I mean he invited Martian Manhunter to come to his house for Christmas since the Martian was alone for the holidays.(One of my favorite episodes BTW)\nBut don't threaten his friends or innocents, then Mr. Nice Man goes away.\n\nInfact the JLU cartoon had some of the best Depictions of DC super heroes and villains period.
Yes and Batman is still better.
That's fine that he's a symbol of hope and how he demonstrates that via his seemingly unlimited power, but he's still a character. He still needs challenges to overcome and face. And when you have someone who can run faster than the fastest man alive, contain black holes and reverse time, then he becomes less and less a character and more like a symbol than anything else.
super man sux!
13 on trending holy crap
Superman sucks
Silver Surfer vs Superman
Talk about cosmic armour superman
pls nerf
Yes
He was \n\nTill Saitama
Pre crisis sups >>>>>>>>>>> post crisis sups > new 52 sups
Batman is overpowered.
Goku can beat him
Batman is overpowered
Yes.
No
Yes
Superman vs trump
Yes he is
Is water wet 💁🏻‍♂️?
Yup he is, and answer is fucktard fanboys, fuck you bitches
Cosmic Spider-Man or Superman?
Sounds like Goku lol
http://FixMonthlyincome.Com/?refer=47639
yes
goku is better
Do deathstroke next
Nah goku can beat him...
arris qunones: i dont personally think superman is overpowered because of one reason \nwhich is as he is a symbol of hope (wrong)\nwhich is because i love dc more than marvel(true)\njust admit it you dont like marvel as much as dc \neven in the strongests weapons video you said the white ring is stronger then the freaking infinity gauntlet \njust admit it arris
Before I watch the video, to answer the question, I say yes. Superman is OP. That is why I generally dislike him. No matter what happens, he always wins. Imagine playing every videogame with Godemode on. That's Superman.
I feel I'm too old to say this but Carrie I've watched these watch me Wednesday's since the start and to sit and watch your relationship with Oliver Develop over time has been magical. Yous are so good for eachother- whether that's friendship or dating that's none of our business
Is it sad I sit and have the biggest smile on my face every time carrie & Oliver have 'moments' 😩🙌🏽👌🏽❤️
Where is 'It'swaypastmybedtime' she changed the name.
Oliver reminds me of Jack Harris a little bit
We are doing Addams Family for our school music. I’m trying out for puglsy, do you have any tips?
I love your videos! You're wonderful! xxx
The guy you were singing with on the stairs has taught me at my drama school loads!
I would love to see Scott as Fester but I'm a bit worried about Les! He has been off for ages. Hope he is doing okay. I'm seeing the show in Glasgow! Can't wait to see a vlog there if you do one ☻
I use to sing the song they were singing at the beginning with my choir, and I loved it :)
I love watching these... I literally watch these for the costumes so I can design costumes based off them for my production of Addams. Everything is so amazing here, thank you for showing us these Carrie. I know all of us in my production of Addams love your videos
I'm sure both Carrie and Oliver don't want to confirm whether they're dating or not until Addams is finished. They obviously don't want anything to ruin what they have at the moment ❤️
Can't wait to see you perform in the Grand in October! I went to see the English Youth Ballet today and it was brilliant, then I bought tickets to see The Addams Family and I realised at half time that you were performing!! It was a great surprise
Hi Carrie. I saw you at the stage door today. I was the one that probably looked very nervous. (I was wearing a pink dress)\nI loved your performance. You were amazing!
I watched it today and it was amazing!! So glad I saw it!
All small YouTube's let's all help eachother out.sub to me and comment done. Then ill sub to you
I saw your show in Sheffield for my 7 year anniversary, you were amazing! I heard every word right from the back, and I thought you were the best singer by far.
My school's doing Addams Family this year, and I love watching these videos and hearing about your experience with the show. It's one of the reasons why I'm so excited to do it!
I'm so sad cause I was meant to be seeing it tonight but it turns out I can't come, and I really wanted to come see it cause the last time I saw you perform was in les mis and you're my favourite west end actress :(❤️❤️
I'm guessing you never know when you're going to stage door because I'll be seeing Addams family on Wednesday (oohhh) and I would love to see you at stage door but of course I get it if you aren't there
The warmup is always my favourite part of these vlogs
I came to the wednesday show in working with my school and you were absolutely incredible!!!!
ok im shocked by how long your hair has grown. i got used to seeing you with a wig or in a bun
I get so excited when a new video comes up! How many more Watch Me Wednesday's are there?
I saw you in Cardiff Carrie and I'm seeing you again tonight, can't wait!! Break a leg to all!!
I would hope Captain America would be a bit more sure of himself 😂😂😂
Oliver trying an American accent sounds so much like Captain Jack Harkness omg
I love your friendship with everyone!! It’s so great to watch <3
I understand why but sometimes I'm so sad your channel is PG because I need to know what Oliver said in the pub
Carrie! Don't use wipes to get your makeup off. Use the Camomile Cleansing Butter from The Body Shop. It's not harsh on your skin at all and it gets rid off your make up very easily. It's also cruelty free and so much better for the environment than those wipes! x
Are you the only one from the original U.K. Cast going to Singapore? 🙃
Hunnyyy you’re hairs getting so long it’s gorgeous!!
Ah you went to my local! Good old Sovs.
❤Great video 😁 Please check out our small YouTube channel and subscribe if you like the content ❤
can't wait to watch you in Singapore!\nhope i can see you as well! I dont remember Mediacorp Theatre having a stage dooor
Awww I LOVE this video Carrie. I love watching the behind the scenes of all the work it takes to put on a touring theatre show omg xxx
i KNEW my hair was growing super slow compared to usually. You confirmed it coz I cut my hair about the same length shortly after you did. And I've been thinking that my hair has grown SO slowly than usual, and now I've been confirmed.
Hey guys please subscribe to my channel ❤️❤️
Awww Carrie watching you meet all the people at stage door made my heart so happy, one of my travel goals in life is to see one of your shows and hopefully meet you one day but WELL DONE THIS WAS A GOOD EPISODE ❤
I sat in the same seat that Oliver is in last time I went to the Sovereigns. Huh.. Oooh!. I went to see the show at 5 on Friday (29th) at Woking. You were amazing, Oliver was amazing, Scott was amazing. 'Full Disclosure', I loved it.
Your video is the 7 most trending video on YouTube atm!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
You & Oliver are actual friendship goals <3
Anyone else REALLY want to hear the inappropriate things that Oliver said? 😂
Why dafuq is this trending 6th, it has 56k views?????!!!!
Hahah I love the ending :'D
Aaah! I went to see the first show on Friday! I was like, middle, top in the audience. My mind is blown that you were filming somewhere I walk past several times a week. The sovereigns is a great pub - opposite the cycle shop on the corner and a walking distance from the station. I recognise the party shop because it's the shop which opens at weird times and is almost always empty. It's so weird! The chips \nin the sovereign are good tho! Anyway, the show was aammaazing!! If you guys haven't watched it, I suggest you do. It's amazing. My fave bit is whenever you pulled the creepy eyebrow slanty face thingy. Anyway, thank you again!! 😃😃
I am dying to fly to Singapore for the show!! But I live in Hong Kong (which is not that far if you consider Europe) and I have school :/ Will you be in the Singaporean tour? love you!  (also, will try to watch this ten times more to figure out what Oliver was saying) cheers x
I CANT WAIT for you guys to come to singapore :'')
I love that everyone has beer and then there's Carrie's wine glass hahahh that's absolutely me
Did anyone else notice the kissing-sound around 6.58 or was that just me????
Carrie when you first started the Addams Family you said the producer wanted you to wear those cool spider earrings. Do you still wear them every show? Love youuuu xxx
Are you actively trying to grow your hair out again or is it because too busy to get a hair cut? Also, loved seeing the after hours!
I’m really going to miss the Carrie and Oliver show when Addams Family is over. You guys make me giggle. 💕
Hi Carrie! Just a quick question for you and your cast mates. My school is starting our own production of the Addams family and I was thinking if any of you had any advice for playing your characters or tips for making things more fun/enjoyable in these cooky and spooky roles. If you do, I'm sure we'd love to hear from you amazing actors! Thank you and have a lovely day <3
CRAZY FOR YOU I FREAKED OUT WHEN I HEARD IT my friend was just in the musical
So many media interviews will leave you PRESSED for time!
Watching you Scott and Oliver just makes me happy 😊 ❤️ xx
Carrie, did Oliver share the After Eights I gave him for you all on Thursday night at stage door? :D
UK stage doors are so chill I expected ear drum bursting screams but overall it was quite quiet
I'm sure you've already tried it but coconut oil is amazing at getting make up off. :)
Ooh are you going on tour to Singapore too? That's exciting! :D\nSo looking forward to seeing the show in Glasgow!
I have to say it's weird to watch you be at my home town! Also sovereigns is definitely one of the nicer pubs in woking! Watched the show on Tuesday so didn't see you at stage door
You are so sweet at the stage door! A true inspiration. I would love to meet you one day!
I'm two subs away from 425 PLEASE help me reach it, I ONLY NEED 2 MORE SUBS!!\n\nCHEERS GUYS!
She's like our own little celebrity! Lol xoxo
My mum came up to Bristol last weekend to see the show with me on Sat evening, it was bloody amazing! Thank you so much to you and the rest of the cast for putting on an awesome show!! Big love <3
Omg I love the ending 😂❤
Hey I saw you tonight in Woking and you were absolutely insane. Keep doing what you’re doing because you and the rest of the cast were incredible xxxx
without sounding too much like regina george, I LOVE your jumper, where did you get it? (but seriously, the grey one, I love it).
Why are the running times announced after the show?
Carrie to get your makeup COMPLETELY off invest in come cotton pads and micellar water. Properly wet 2 cotton pads with the micellar water and use that to take all of your makeup off like a makeup wipe, works a treat!! Xx
I remember the video, where you cut your hair! It is like yesterday, but no! Your hair is long again o. O
I’ll forever love you Carrie. Please check your Insta inbox from athina_alice xxx
I JUST GOT BACK FROM YOUR SHOW IN WOKING CARRIE YOU WERE AMAZING ALSO PLEASE ASK FESTER IF HES OK AFTER HE BUMPED HIS HEAD ON THE DOOR FRAME BECAUSE IM PRETTY CERTAIN THAT WASNT PLANNED AND IM A CONCERNED FAN (real talk though you were all amazing and I absolutely loved it from start to finish, I wish you all the best!!!!)
I’ve officially made it! Finally in one of your videos Carrie! Glad you loved the necklace my friend made you! ❤️
Coming to watch saturday night (cause missed it in my hometown Southampton)  :-D so excited! Love watch me Wednesday
I love that, with everything you do during the day and doing a show in the evening, you still make time for The Bake Off!!
Carrie are you growing your hair long again (i was just wandering)\nP.s you were in the first les mis show my mum wached
I AM DOING THE ADAMS FAMILY THE MUSICAL FOR A HALLOWEEN SHOW!!! I am Pugsley so...I AM YOUR LITTLE BROTHER!!!!! Lol I love your videos. Keep up the good work.😃👍
Just curious why do you get the running times? I know during dress and tech the production for shows I've done would time the runs but I don't fully understand why other than knowing how long a show will be.
Carrie! Where'd you get the floral dress from the beginning of the vlog?
I have the same floral patterned H&M top as you! It's soooo nice! x
If you're looking for a nice place to go after a show, try Cellar Magneval, it's a really nice wine bar in Woking town centre 😊
Ollie is just the most precious gem ❤❤ i adore you both
In all seriousness what are you and Oliver gonna do when addams is over 😔 yous still need to see eachother 😩🙏🏼
I'm going to be subscribing to anyone who likes this comment and subscribes to my channel! Comment when done (legit)
I saw the Addams family on Wednesday and met you at the stage door and gave you a letter from me and my friend and you were so lovely  xx
Ive got to say... Oliver's eyebrows are great. No joke
I know Steven lol.
Bake off traitors 😛😉
Is Samantha womwick eg Ronnie Mitchell eastenders the mum
Seeing it tonight ommggg
lol love it :)
Oliver's dance omg
oh gosh, your poor skin! :D
What your funniest moment on stage
Wonderful 🤗😘
<3
It's so strange to me how stage door works for the west end. In almost any venue on broadway in New York,or on a tour,there's a barrier and the actor walks down the line and says hey to everybody.
but wheres pete
Oliver does a pretty good American accent. Speaking of, could you do a video where you talk with one, at least the parts where it's just you talking to the camera? I'm curious what that sounds like lol.
I am inspired beyond belief!
You can kiss my ass on the white house steps... Love it!!!! What happened to buying songs on Google music?
I'm amazed how well that lady sang the 'yeah' part
This is just like musified mad libs? 😂😂
SLEAZLY!
New Yorkers? Isn't Times Square 99.9% tourist?
I scrolled past the thumbnail really quick and honestly thought that was Megan mackenna🤔
Normally I'm a #defenderofawesome . This one was interesting. It's not my favorite, but it's creative and I loved the summer jams so I see why this was done. Even my 9 year old was like.. come on man. In other news... where's that bodak yellow parody
Priceless and a new classic :-)
Hahahahahaha you guys are the very best

WHO ELSE FREAKED OUT WHEN YOU SAW THE POSTERS OF WAITRESS AND WICKED
This is the greatest song of all time...
Mark, please be an awesome sloth all the time. I'd buy that shirt.
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!
Fake, New Yorkers don't spend time in times square.
This lady at 2:30 is my spirit animal. She might not be advertiser friendly :P there is no but ...
I will play this when I need to revise😅😂
I thought was that YouTube wasn't allowed Patreon link in description box without their permission from their YouTube program... Now I'm scared.
this is so funny😂😂 evan is great too
Sorry, but  I didn't find this really funny, or uplifting, or catchy.\nJust kind of obnoxious.
This is the best hahaha
this was just bad, nothn u could do to help this one, i like the first one u guys did in NY, it was summer jam
When it says stronger than a can of tuna the captions say 'strong than a can or tuna'
Err this video has less then 15k views... why is this in trending already? lol
This is like what Flight of the Concords did to raise money for charity. So cool!

My son and I had so much fun doing this interview. The spider idea was his even thought his talking on cam didn't make the cut. So much fun! Great video using a great concept and if you don't like my comments, well.... you can kiss my ass on the White House Steps.
the next song should be a Kesha song with Andrea fezko, or despacito by Justin Bieber, or how about an all original Key of Awesome song. something super catchy and yet funny with an awesome beat, featuring a cameo by reggae Shark, Doug, and Batman. enough said.
What an inspired idea! Do more!!
Mark you make a great old lady
This is the key of awesome I signed up for
A song about everyone's family

Salute to you all the way from NZ Mr Attenborough!!
his voice is one of a kind... i have never heard ne1 like him. a rare gem.. amazing documentary with great voice.
What horrible music to go with some of the best wildlife footage ever.
As a canine this trailer makes me all warm inside
take my money and my soul! THIS GONNA BE EPIC!
some of this stuff is so high quality it almost looks CG
anybody else keep watching this over and over just for the music?
gonna blaze up for all 6
The most majestical collab I could ever think of
The only tv show I’ll go back to tv for
Pure nostalgia. Remember watching blue planet 1 as a kid all the time. So hyped up
and i love😍BBC😍very much too
What a  Mesmerise blue world 👌and David voice is always like cherry of the cake,he hypnotized viewers through his amazing voice  love you David atounbourgh ... God bless you...
When I see this, I think that the criteria we need to judge the destruction we provoke in order to sustain our lifestyles should not be based on ethics but aesthetics.  It is not a lack of goodness, but a lack of good taste. When I see this masterpiece prequel and think of what we humans are doing I cannot see us but as vandals threatening the beauty of these frames.
Radiohead, Hans Zimmer and David Attenborough in the same sentence? I'm dead. HYPE.
When it comes to nature documentaries. NO ONE does it like the BBC ... Planet Earth I and II, Blue Planet I and II, Life ... which was also an amazing series ... the crews are masters of their craft ... combined with Sir David ... it's the pinnacle of documentary making. Archiving our amazing planet and showing us that if we do nothing, this will be the only way future generations will be able to appreciate the beauty that once was. We need to do more, not less.
Beautiful but misleading. The planet is  not pristine, we have ruined it to the point of no return.
Calm down. We've discovered not more than 10% of the ocean life. Many more to come.
We are destroying our earth our beloved home 😭
Need to see this!!
Nobody, and I mean NOBODY does it like BBC.  This looks absolutely wonderful and I can't wait to watch it.
Take my money, where do I watch this?
Who's joining me on the Blue Planet ll hype train!?
How marvelous God's creation is - how magnificent!
just trying not to cry
Take a break from humans
❤❤❤baby turtles😊\nAnd shout out to all the camera guys and gals who capture all of this wonder. 💯
david attenborough is the best thing that happened to this planet
David Attenborough can give you an orgasm with his narration.
Stunning, absolutely stunning. Just shows the beauty of the world we live in.
Just stunning, absolutely beautiful! Anyone agree that this is gonna be great?

Wow amazing can't wait. Looks Beautiful
Why's it titled prequel?? Surly this is a sequel?
That opening song is “Bloom” from The King of Limbs album.
Need this in 4k goodness!
Exactly the reason why I wanna be a marine biologist 😍💙
Meanwhile in America we have the Kardashians....
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VID IN YOUTUBEEEEE!!💙💙💙💙💙 JOB WELL DONE BBC AND SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH!
Wow this is amazing and again so beautifully captured. Have always loved you David Attenborough and all you do to bring our awareness to the natural world. We need to do more to protect our precious gem...our home. 🐳🐬🐠💙
Watched the original over and over on vhs as a kid\n\nThis makes me very happy
oh my god the colours are really wonderful, i never saw something like that
As beautiful as this is, it makes me think of the damage we've done to the ocean just since the last Blue Planet series came out. Not much hope that there will be an ocean around that's anything like the one we have today in even 100 years.
I've never watched an advert so much..
OMG, I CAN'T WAIT, David Attenborough You Are AMAZING!!! Keep spreading the positive message to raise awareness to save our planet & preserve these natural wonders! <3
what kind of sick ppl disliked this video lol
When does it come out ?
I remember watching the trailer for the original Blue Planet when I was 10. In that time I’ve become a PADI Advanced Open Water Diver and now sponsor Hawksbill Turtles with WWF. Can’t wait for this to return!
Goosebumps to the maximum with the song
When does this air on BBC ?????
That song was awful ... ruined the trailer ...  no singing in your documentaries please BBC.
thank you more than so much about this video
Who actually disliked this video? I'm truly puzzled.
What have we done to this beautiful earth , fighting fighting and fighting\n\n\n\nI'm so inspired by this vedio ,that I am going to start a campaign ,by God
Please consider veganism! Why would anyone want to destroy beauty like this with overfishing? It will never fail to baffle me. We need to protect marine life, now more than ever, as it is likely many species will be extinct by 2050. It may seem a long way off, but in the grand scheme of things, this is a minuscule amount of time to cause such irreversible damage to our beautiful planet.  They don't belong on your plate, they belong in the oceans. Please, please help keep them there, supply and demand. If enough people stop contributing to our ocean's exploitation by buying fish, there will be no profit in it and they will have to find another source of money. Hopefully a much less destructive one that allows these incredible creatures to live out their lives free of suffering and pain.

We all came from the sea, this is our god
I feel strange for being this excited for a documentary. <3  And is it my headphones or is the sound mixing slightly off in this trailer? Sounds like his voice is drowning in the music a little.
I loved this video about land animals.                                              \n\n\n\n\n\nT R I G G E R E D
Anyone know when it will be released?
I dying Moe. Unless u have a cure for cancer. Do you have a cure for cancer ?

Save planet
When i watch the planet series by bbc i feel like giving up everything. I just feel like going into the wild and experiencing the nature. Ironically i am working hard to make a living when life is in the mountains or by the lake or deep in the blue. Was born a human, rat race made me a robot !

You look SO COOL with the leopard coat on with that outfit!! You're looking so slim too! Helen is goals - still watching you everyday when I'm travelling th world!
That leopard print coat is amazing 😍😩
The background of this video is so aesthetically pleasing. Oh my.
Loads of great pieces, especially like the jellyfish top in pink. Loved you alternative going out lookbook, could you maybe do a similar one for the office, or places where you need to look more put together but want to keep something interesting, edge or alternative about your style (why are all the word that describe that look so awful???).
Love those laceup front jeans, really flattering, especially when paired with both black shirts!
Helen, you need to go and look at BlackMoon Cosmetics. They have a color called Cider and you will be obsessed!
GOD NO IM HAVING FLASHBACKS TO SPLICE NOW HELEN
Seriously wish i didnt miss the 50% off!
How did I not know about the discount 😞

Your style gives me LIFE
This does all the talkin'....literally it's got a mouth on the back of it hahah
I looove your style (and just you) so much, man! „Oooooh... it‘s a sleeve!“ 🤙🏻😂❤️

Every haul I pray for Helen to say sleeeeeve and again, she has not let me down ❤
Witch vibes! Loved the haul as always.
If I was to pick out some of those items I would be clueless on how to wear them but YOU SUIT EVERYTHING💕
The Jellyfish tops were really pretty. They looked really good on you.
i love the black top with the fluted sleeves ! ! 😻 great video as per :’)
Helen you should show us some footage of you actually doing shopping online that way it may benefit other people into buying and could show this in your vlog or something cause I just think it's a good idea haha, let me know if it is?

That's the same name as my dog
evan holds the camera below his neck
(TIPS FOR EVAN) When a puppy pees get a towel and some vinergar sorry for no English but you should get what I mean
What is her breed ?
Evan your tiny 😅😄😂
Get Ariana Grande, Fifth Harmony, Camilo Cabello, Lewis Hamilton in this 😊
If Wanda doesn't top the power rankings after this I give up.
@firstwefeast you should do a compilation with @goodmythicalmorning
please can you get Tiffany Haddish and Aziz Azari to come on and eat some wings. i dont think you'll make through with her she is too hilarious
Please get Conan O'Brien on!!
Syikes is a vicious sodomite lesbian. I mean vicious as can be. if u get into confortation wit this beast you better boldly bring the business to that azz. Cause she's the beast666 within.
The sound effects had me dead..
She wasn't funny or interesting at all...
Wanda is a straight bad ass!!!
I’m mean I know it would kill me or does it seem like the last dab isn’t nearly as hot as Blair’s. No one ever really reacts to it that strongly. Wanda was dying on Blair’s and Da Bomb and almost tapped and she took another bite before she threw it away. Hell that guy from 1D slathered his and took another bite because he didn’t think he got enough. Maybe they went overboard with the mustard instead of actually just trying to make a kill switch with that Pepper X
i like the passvie peer
Sean easing her into continuing after Da Bomb was masterful. Well played, sir. And of course props to Wanda for powering through like a champ.
Wanda Sykes is a living legend with the heart of a lion after that shit! also Sean Evans is the best interviewer of our generation in my opinion.
Why did you let her on the show
You need game grumps on here
This show is fake. Been watching for years.  Filthy Frank got real wings, other people get different wings.
DO THE BATTLE RAPPER DIZASTER AND HAVE HIM FREESTYLE HIS ANSWERS!
Congrats Sean you will get that ranking you want for sure!!!
You need to have Felipe Esparza on this shit!
Please get father john misty on here
Believe in the wings
PLEASE GET CARDI B ON THIS!! IT WOULD BE SO HILARIOUS
It would be cool to see Aziz Ansari on the show
Bruh get Larry Or Jeff or more people from curb
Should have the guys from Impractical Jokers on here!
The only show with intro music in 7/8
You should get Sarah Paulson on this
This is so damn funny! Dude, you are a freakin' genius! Kudos to you for coming up with this concept. You are infinitely talented - I don't laugh at many things and this had me rolling.  Thank you for that. Sometimes you just need a good laugh! The Russell Brand episode is awesome!
DO TYLER THE CREATOR
Nice to see a real celebrity for a change.
*Please feature Talib Kweli, Mos Def, or Ivy Doomkitty on the show!*
The music every time she was hit with a wave 😭
Make sure u nail the sojourner truth statue down or the next white people will move her to the kitchen 😭😭😭😂 they laughed in private at that shit guaranteed lmao
The entry music was off this episode..
Please get Louis C.K. On this show!
Get on Alex Turner from The Arctic Monkeys!
How is Chigga still not on here?
We need Kid Cudi on here!
She's boring
Get Marques Brownlee on this
yass queen yass queen yass queen yaw
Why she red?
Get Chino from Deftones on here!!
wow sean smooth
Get lil pump!!!
Fuck this nappy headed bitch.  😂😂😂😂😂
Cardi b
Do Lil Yachty 👌🏻👌🏻
Dont jump buddy, you got me...HAHA!!
Please bring on Matt Stonie
Invite Brian Ambs
Damn Wanda! You Destroyed those wings :D
I just... adore Wanda so fucking much!
Do one with lavar ball PLEASE he's the GOAT
Remember her don't say that's gay commercial? Never looked at her the same ever since.
get edgar wright, pls. pls. p.s.: watch baby driver then you'll want to get him.
Great episode.. I love Wanda.. and Sean.. and Spice.. and everything nice. / love from sweden
Sean's outros just keep getting better
I want some hot wings so bad now
I wonder how much business Blair's mega death sauce with liquid rage gets because of this show

Almost 17 and definitely grew out of the cuddly stage a year or two after primary school,  I have no idea why i just feel super gross being so affectionate (not that I’m not still loving to my parents though!) so make the most of it!
6 and a half?! Already?? Wow, I remember watching you before she was even born. Doesn't seem that long ago at all. I think you've made a very wise choice to just let her do her own thing without a camera on her all the time. 🙂
can you do a video on how you introduced darcey to liam?
having her less on camera makes sense, and it makes the moments she is on camera all the more precious :)
Darcy is simply the most adorable little munchkin! What a lucky wee girl to have such a doting mum, too! You are just *oozing* joy at the moment Louise. I can see how proud of your family you are and just how content life is for you at the moment. I'm so happy you're happy!
It's so warming to hear about your affection for each other😊 she such a sweet little girl💛when I was 6 I also liked to play role play, mainly as a vet with my stuffed animals, now I'm volunteering at my local vets for real!!💛
Ironic how u wash her hair when you dont wash your own
greatest thing since wifi  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 as a mum I can relate 💖💖💖💖
This conkers for you vicar and I've named it jesus
Louise oh my gosh I cannot even BEGIN to tell you how much I appreciate you taking so much care into preparing Darcy for the new baby :') Every time you talk about it I'm reminded of the godawful job my mom and stepdad did for me when my mom was pregnant and I'm just really happy for Darcy that she has such a great mom like you * crying emoji *
My niece is 6 next month and is a gorgeous little weirdo too. I swear we weren't as quirky as kids today. I sound so old lol.
I'm so happy you're PTA president!!! What a special thing to be able to do for Darcy. My mom was president when my sisters and young and I have so many great memories of her being at school for parties and being so proud of her when she spoke at meetings! You rock
I'm 21 and haven't grown out of loving having hugs with my momma and never ending saying I love you to my momma she's my best friend. Darcy sounds like such an amazing little girl who has such a great personality and is such a mini you ❤️
I am currently 16 years old, and my mother is like secretly FREAKING OUT and everytime I mention moving out when I'm 18 or going to university she just avoids the topic, or tells me how I'd probably be more comfortable at home where she can cook for me and do my laundry while I'm busy studying...\nBless her <3
My little sister was born on Christmas Eve, and it took me months to open my Christmas presents because I was more interested in the baby! 😂😁
Why is this on trending?
Hi Louise, loved this video it's so nice to hear how Darcy is doing I'm glad she's growing up so well❤️ just wondering how do you and Liam go about disciplining her? Like do you let Liam tell her off to?
Darcy is the sweetest little girl x
So lovely seeing another girl who shares my name! (even with a different spelling) \n\nI've only ever met dogs called Darcey haha
Go you for being president of the PTA.  I've never joined.  Apparently it's a political minefield 😱
I've named it Jesus 😂😂😂😂😂
Louise you are such a great mom! Great video 💞
Darcy is a big part of the reason why I started watching .... Hope to see more of her..... Until then I'll check once in awhile💕
My friend is 24 & she still gives her Mom a cuddle, or sits close together on the couch having tea & sharing stories or their day. So don't worry Louise some people never grow out of the cuddles.
I like Liam a million times more now after finding out he's a swimmer! I am too :) :)
Lol ha pj masks so true. Having sisters is so super special xx she sounds like such a loving girl xxx Jesus concur. 😂 I am sure he loved it. So funny.
The greatest thing since WIFI --- LOL! I laughed so hard, partly because I understand. I think my son is the greatest thing since WIFI too!
Would love to see you colab with emily norris
Awww, Darcy seems to be growing into a very sweet, intelligent little lady.  I don't have children, but I love hearing about Darcy.  It's lovely to see how proud you are of her.  Also Louise, you look amazing in this video! x
When is the video with Dan and Phil?
I have been watching your videos for so long, I feel like Darcy is my niece (I already have 4 nieces, so what's one more). Can't wait to see baby Pentland as well.
When i was 6 i was the exact same
What's a concur?
this conker is for you... i've named it jesus. honestly relatable
It's so funny hearing about Darcy learning to swim (which is awesome go her!!) because here in Australia it seems like kids can swim before they can walk! We start swimming lessons when we are only months old. I didn't realise how early that is until you mentioned darcy's swimming lessons!
AHHHH please dont talk about darcy going 7 i feel so old omg
You look so lovely here louise. Healthy and glowy and beautiful ❤️
'and ive called him jesus' ahaha laughed out loud at that
Omg I remember when Darcy was so little, and you guys did a Q and A. Somebody asked if Darcy loved one direction and she just says 'raisins' and I replayed that so many times it was so funny!
My son has recently discovered PJ Masks... it has taken over everything! He has decided I have to be Owlette for Halloween!
Loved this video, not having kids of my own (yet?) it's very interesting and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. Please keep them coming xx
I'm 20 and I still cuddle my mum every day when I'm back home - sign of good parenting I think!
I absolutely love that Darcy wants stickers of squirrels on her car. Definitely the next big trend.
Darcy is such a precious soul and we all love her but not as much as a mother's love Louise you are the greatest mother on YouTube
My sister negotiates as well 😂😂 she's crazy but it's kind of funny 😂😂
I genuinely think I washed my own hair from about the age of 4...but then I was really into swimming from very young so I used to wash my own hair in the pool showers. Don't really remember hair washing with my mum...although I'm sure she did at some point 😂
This is so cute. The squirrel stickers on the car made me chuckle xxx
Madame President 😂😂 god I love you haha
I was six when my sister was born, she is my best friend ever since. Hope Darcy and the little one go on <3
I understand Mickey Mouse Clubhouse & PJ Masks, I feel like I can quote every episode word for word with my siblings! 😂
Our daughters have the same age and we are due almost the same time :-)! Darcy is such a sweetie! Also my daughter is still all huggy and sweet and I hope so much that this will never change!
My daughter is 6 &1/2 halos and she is so similar to Darcy. I get a letter almost every day and hugs and kisses and I love yous and she likes to negotiate dinner a lot. My daughter likes to have private talks away from her brother about school and her friendships and it makes me so happy and I just know that God-willing we will be best friends. 🤗🤗🤗
Jesus when did you tube turn this crap on
OMG now i want to have a six year old this made me so excited and happy and 😍
im 15 and am still the biggest cuddle ever i love it and my mum is too! xx
I'm 19 and I'm still super cuddly with my mum because we're very close so I wouldn't worry, Darcy could definitely hold on to that trait x
I'm almost 22 and I still live with my mom, we still cuddle every day so don't worry, she will probably do that when she's older \n\nYou look absolutely lovely Louise xx
The Jesus conker story made me howl with laughter!  I teach children Darcy's age and they are just FULL of random little comments like that!
PJ MAKS ARE ON OUR WAY INTO THE NIGHT TO SAVE THE DAY, this sound is in my head far too much
I was so confused as to why Darcy was so scared of swimming until I realised that she had only just started! Most kids in Australia are swimming from 6 months old haha. So pleased she loves it!
What a cute video!!
I love that! The greatest thing since WiFi!
Darcy is sooooo sweet, such a lovely little girl🌸 & when I was younger I always remember wanting the family pet to be mine😹🌸
honestly one of my main reasons for being alive anymore if watching lil darcy grow up happy. <3
I've just realised there's the same age gap between Darcy and the baby as there is between me and my sister. It's really the best. I'm sure they'll get on so well and Darcy will teach her new little sister so much 😊
Can you do what's in my baby's registry
Louise you are #8 on trending!!💗
What I remember watching your pregnancy announcement and it feels like only yesterday! She's so amazing and I'm praying for a smooth pregnancy for yous. \nAlso try keep darcy in swimming and maybe get her on your local team, I'm a swimmer and it is such a nice lil community and swimming is so amazing❣
My daughter is 6 and a half too. I've been following you and Darcy for years ;) My daughter Matilda is obsessed with card making and making me little letters and 'story books' I absolutely love this age :)
I love that you and Darcy are so close, I never grew out of the cuddly stage. I would always cuddle my mum and sit on her lap for a hug until I was 15 when she passed ❤
I'm pretty sure the best thing since sliced bread came from the wonder loaf the first packaged slice bread in America I think before that there was obviously only loafs that you had to cut and I guess got laborious and it would dry out etc so imagine packaged bread that you don't need to hack at ... sorry probably WAY too much information lol 😂
I'm so happy Darcy is all good and happy :)xx
Actually laughed out loud over Jesus the Conker, brilliant!
I want a video of Dan, Phil, and Louise playing with Darcy (: please please please
I'm sure she will love having a little sister xx
My cousin is 4 and wants to be a stripper. Like, I know I said you can be anything but you have to draw the line somewhere.
I'm so happy for you Louis! Your a great mum!😁💖
Madam president has a nice ring to it, alright madam president.
We all love Darcy so much❤️❤️❤️
I have a feeling Darcy will be a great sister because as you said during the video she loves playing with dollies and things so she'll probably be her little sisters mummy and probably be a waiter to her little sister.
I'm 15 and me and my mum still have bedtime cuddles and lots of cuddles and I love you's! She's still my best friend x
you look so good in this video Louise!!!
Darcy is gorgeous!
Love this so  muchglad shes going great
❤️❤️❤️
Squirrel car sounds iconic honestly
Jesus conker 😂

Are you a part of the ASAP Mob ?
Hey, it turns out to be pretyyyy good
So, to summarize \nSkip the laptop\nStudy sleep study \nModify practice slightly\nGet some exercise \nSay it out loud\nStay hydrated \nReward yourself
Man this channel is a lifesaver
What if I handwrite notes on surface pro?
I'm waiting for the pill to skip the learning part and make it instant.
I don’t understand this,  I need to understand this by watching this video again!
Focus is incredibly important to learning because it helps release the hormone BDNF, which in turn helps you focus more.  This is how babies learn!  All of these tips are great, but at the end of the day, focus is key to learning and retaining new information.
I didn't learn anything from this video...
Thanx.....next month my exams are starting...will try these out in bio for sure😊😇
sorry what was that I was busy commenting
1:53 Even a quick walk around the baaak (slight voice crack)
So what ur saying is...teachers should give us money for getting a question right , and it’ll make me smarter, I love this video I GOTTSS PROOF
That's interesting. If I am made to read something out loud, then I have little to no understanding of what I just read. If I am allowed to read silently, then it's very easy for me to comprehend. Apparently, the opposite is true for the general populace. Hmm.
I'm learning how to learn faster...brilliant\n\n\n.org

My question is this: why do women like hot showers over men who think our showers are too hot?
Having my finals soon, glad this popped up :::)

Wow this is genuinely informative. You've earned yourself another subscriber!
why am i watching this ? because my exams are coming up
Is Beyonce an alien? Yeah, i read that article and it looked promising 🌝
I wonder how much the typing vs handwriting difference may correlate with people who at a younger age wrote mostly by hand versus typing on a computer. Perhaps for people who used almost exclusively handwriting to write stuff from ages 5 to 14 or so have better retention with handwriting, specially if they type slowly, whereas perhaps people who got used to type a lot in the same age window would have better retention typing than handwriting, specially if they're slow with handwriting. I've heard many people don't even know cursive scripts these days, not being able to write or read it.
Pls no1 dislike this Video. Keep it at 420
Learning is different for everyone
I've a question; could you think with two brains?
It's 4:00 am \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill don't know what I am doing in my life smh
Do a video on dyslexia
Let me test you.. repeat all the tips on how to learn faster on this video??\n\n\n\n\nNahhh you’re slow
I would do all of this.... \n\n\n\n\n\nIf I wasn't lazy enough.
i am going to follow these steps and probably still fail lol
That voice crack at 1:53
Good vid but I can exactly say a mnemonic out loud in a exam 😂
The best thing you can do is study something you enjoy!
I hope this work😂💤
do a video about why do armies have drumlines, i know its not science its history but like why
Here's how I remember my homework\nWhenever I'm in a class with journals required, I just write down what I need to do at home every 2 minutes, during actual lessons so I can switch my brain faster. Of course it trains your muscle memory, but it helps me actually remember.
Ok so those are really small samples you're using to the claim you're trying to make. Very vague...
asapscience i would love to know how you get your info
*that is a great tip , the app is really fun to use*
I want to see if anyone remembers this from science class:\nKing\nHenry\nDied\nDrinking\nChocolate\nMilk
Can you do a video on this question: Can you learn a language in your sleep? (Listening to audio tapes while you sleep. Something that has been done by a few people, but is it possible for anyone?)
2:17 that's a little offensive ain't it xD
Me: *watching this at 3AM, stressing over a big test tomorrow that I promised to do, but is too lazy and is now desperate.*
Haha im trying to remember the periodic table song lol
Please do a video on what is our goal/purpose in life And why are we born .
Or just drink a Rockstar Bubbleburst. The caffeine speeds up the mind and the intense flavour prevents you from drinking it too quickly. Sorted.
I couldn't hear anything after 'is beyonce an alien?'

2:15 read it... that's what she said
instead im studying for mid term test, im watching this video and hoping i could pass the exam without even studying
I'm great at cramming, the problem is I'm a genius for about 48 hours, then forget everything. It's like knowing a lot but understanding little.
I tried everything, yet i fail
I'm horny.
I already do all this
i use brilliant.org lmao hahhahaha
Why are you recommending mnemonic devices for learning? Mnemonic devices are good for short-term memorization, but not long-term learning. The method is not proven but has mixed and sometimes poor results, with subjects retaining the mnemonic but not actually learning the target of what the mnemonic was designed for in the first place.
1:50 did anyone get the joke?😃
The stay hydrated thing really explains why I can't concentrate in class when I'm hungover

Actually when memorizing memorize it at night then sleep. You gonna remember it better in the mornin
1. Disable email notifications\n2. Disable facebook notifications\n3. Switch off phone\n4. Only google what's related to your topic\n5. Have a willpower to actually follow these 4 steps.
It sucks to have cognitive impairment (sigh)
Very useful video

Can you make a video about:\nHow stereo types / modern gender roles affect both Men & Women in a psychological way i.e. how it affects thier decision making, habbits etc. :)
Beautiful makeup! Hope you will enjoy dating again 💓 (men, be aware 😎)
You look lovely Sam. Very youthful and fresh. Love it!
Look forward to the Daniel Sandler vid. Would also love an updated skin routine from both you & Nic. X
Love you make up tutorials an how you girls explain everything. Nothing is staged. However, I feel disappointed because it seems your videos are only for caucasian and young women. Being latino and in my mid forties, I would love to see something special for us. There are plenty of celebrities, gorgeous and mature such as Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek that you could take inspiration from. Any hope?
The best! Thank you. I'm taking notes - and thank you for the movie recommendations too. 🌸
I've been a bad subscriber and was startled to find out Sam is single! I thought she was dating someone for some time? Can somebody give me the rundown?
Love love the look... I have 4 Daniel Sandler blushes and adore them. I use them on my eyes too instead of shadow. You must get the shade Glow from Katie at Beauty & the Boutique... it's incredible for a sun kissed look. Can't wait for the D/S video
Please do an update on your eyebrows so we can see what the microblading looks like now!!
I’ve never watched one of your videos before. I have to say, this was completely mesmerizing. Incredible. I love your approach to makeup. Thank you!
I literally gasped when you said 40! You look amazing.
❤️ Sam since 2009 your the best!
SAM you look phenomenal- and in the real world, you can do so much better than a chris pratt/ryan gosling type. go get yours hon xo
Sam you are way too hot to be single, get that dick girl
Hope you find someone worthy of you. Maybe you'll bump into Chris Pratt? 😍
Would love a video on tinting brows!
Go for it!! Get back in the game!! 😉
Where is your NECKLACE from?
I love that movie!!! For sure you'll not have a hard time dating, you look gorgeous!!! 💛💕💕💛
So excited for the watercolour blush video! I've been meaning to order one for months
You have amazing skin!! Please do a skin care routine video 😍
I looked in ur description box and tried to find the urban decay Brighting and Tightening and couldn't find it...I also looked up from ulta and sephora and couldn't find it, (I try to avoid buying from online) bit wanted to know where u got it:)
i have a similar eye shape to you in that i have pretty deep set eyes and a lot of space between my crease and my brow. I've kind of given up on eyeshadow because it always looks funny. I have found that if I put shimmers in the crease (usually just a one shadow look), it makes my eyes look less deep set and small. I don't know, it could all be in my wee little brain lol. Your comment about putting bronzer on the brow bone made me think about my first world problem eyeshadow struggle. Lovely as always! :)
So gorgeous! If you like shadow sticks, try the Mally Beauty Evercolor shadow sticks. Dusk and Saddle Shimmer are my go-to's😊
Can anyone suggest a good daily moisturizer for dry skin that has spf?? I love Cetaphil moisturizer but it doesn't have spf and I'm trying to do better about taking care of my skin. Thanks in advance~
What a gorgeous look! That blush is stunning on you.
I just love the way you do your makeup!
What is your nail polish? It’s beautiful!
What eyelash comb did you use ? A real technique one ?
i am sooo waiting for the daniel sander blush video!
Would love to see the colors of that blush!!
I absolutely love your necklace!! Could you tell us where it's from?
Your necklace the a with dots on where are it from? Lovely makeup I do it a lot.
Gorgeous and simple!! Definitely start dating again and please do a Fenty Beauty review. Love ya.
I tried this today but substituted the base for Armani Maestro and Nars duo for my oily skin. Worked well Thanks!
Love this so much! I really hope you do a video for the Daniel Sandler watercolour blushes as I've been wanting to try them for ages but not sure which to go for xx
Beautiful. Can I ask where your necklace is from? It is really pretty.
hi,  Wondering where you get your botox done?
I just hope that you find the right and hot guy soon! You will!!!!
So very pretty, looks lovely on you - young and fresh. Thanks for sharing.
Love love love AH.. these blue ayes.. So beautiful..
Your soo beautiful it wont take you long to bag a man, and its not just because of ur stunning looks its because of how smart and sweet and lovely your personality is!!!
I am very grateful for your natural look tutorials. That's what I'm looking for and good ones are fairly hard to come by.
Gorgeous! Can you do a full face waterproof make up routine?
i am a fan of the crazy arty looks but i loovooooed this video :) thanks sam .\nhave fun with dating x
Chris Pratts single......get in there girl! Do it for us All! 😂😂❤️
I always find that lip-makeup ruins the look...
sam is such a goddessssssss
RYAN GOSSLING & CHRIS PRATT? Really? Oh, Sam, you've got awful taste in men. IMO LOL\nYou're just horny, and that's okay.
So beautiful! You look like Helena Christensen!
When are the bleu brushes coming to U.S.?
You always look amazing but god damn you look stunning! 😍👌
Beautiful! What shade is your nail polish? Love it!
I thought she was married! Anywaaay, go and date again!! You are a wonderful person!
You look amazing: but you talk way too much (in my opinion) (when it comes to dating) otherwise the looks ✌🏻
love your tutorials keep up the great work and happy birth day xoxo
Yes, I would love to see a Daniel Sandler blush video. You've always talked about them but they're not readily available so I've never had the chance to play with them. I'd also love to know how they wear and if they're suitable for oily skin. Thanks!
Love it! I also don't use mascara on my bottom lashes. I've found not using it on the bottom lashes makes my eyes look more awake. Such a simple yet stunning makeup. Thanks Sam x
such a fresh look
Hi, I really love your hair colour but I don't know how to ask my hairdresser to do the same? My base colour is like yours but I have never died it. Are yours low lights? In what colour? Thank you 😊
Oh my, you look like Autumn Giselle !!!
Your hair is a dream! So glossy and delicious colour
So frustrating that I can't give this multiple thumbs up! Loved this xxx
I'm a guy, I don't know why I'm watching this but my God, she's pretty.
So lovely!!!!!\nI will definitely try it in my new job I’m starting on Monday!!!! \nThanks so much!!!\nGreetings from Spain 😘
So freaking beautiful!!!! \n\nI haven't watched a video in so very long... but I thought she was dating someone.
Sam is one of the most beautiful women in the world in my opinion..
Gorgeous as always Sam 💕 go for it, any guy would be lucky to have you (just hope they will appreciate your make up collection 😋) xx
Thank you so much Sam for this super useful video....you are so good at what you do and so acknowledgeable so it’s refreshing. Please do also a video on no make make up style. MERCI, Sandra
Love this look Sam! What was the bronzer you used? Thanks!
She look like Elizabeth  moss
You look so much like Helena Christensen in this video! 🙌🏼
Love this natural look... have you tried Tropic skincare products? I too am 40 and have finally found skincare that nourishes my skin and makes it look brighter, make up sits lovely too.  I would love to see makeup tutorial with their products too.
I don't believe there's anything better than a good old classic Pixiwoo makeup tutorial. I adore how candid and comfortable they are in front of the camera. Nothing is pretentious, there's no big production, acting ridiculous, etc. I hope they never stop filming these.
Shut your mouth you're not 40!!
Gorgeous, and making it simple always appreciated! Can't wait to see the Daniel Sandler blushes!
I love how you can share some personal bits here and there, without it being too much though, still keeping bits to yourself. You're a gorgeous, witty, independent young woman. Whenever you are ready, you'll find love again. Kisses from Greece 😘
You look just beautiful <3
Blooooooomin lovely xxxxx
Gorgeous! Oh and get dating 😘
What was that eyebrow pencil?
Stunning xx
You are sooo amazing! You should totally start dating Gurley :)
Love you 😘

I'm sorry Jay pharoah just isn't funny sum of his impressions r good others not so much
Check out this new South African banger right here https:youtu.be/Dkv-hz0IANk. It's a wavy hip--hop record you'd bump on your way to a lituation somewhere coastal and sunny. Check it out and tell me where you're watching from in the comments. Shout out Chiraq, Rèunion & Namibia for showing us love!
Jamie fox kanye kinda sounds like terrence howard 😹😹😹 jamie is amazing and Jay is insanely good too good 😹😹😹
Jamie was being nice and passing the easy ones off to Jay. He's a lot more humble in his older years, cause old school Jamie would have stolen the spotlight easily.
Im sure the used car is kim actually 😂
That Jay-Z laugh is so wicked😂\nNever knew he laughs like that
VOTE ALL REPUBLICANS OUT OFF OFFICE 2018

Jamie has nothing to work with.
Jay making it known he can do better than Saturday night live

S O ... Illuminati has to give as well as receive ! So that still makes it what...90% receiving and taking. 10% giving and killing. Raping. Molesting etc... Not included
Jay got worst at impressions I swear he still nice but not like his early stuff
A black youtuber, Victor Mann aka Vic Damoane(sp?) admits to beating black woman who disrespects him...Black woman domestic abuse is real in our generation 49:51 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiLtjHvY4yk
I am tried of laughing
They should let Jay do Denzel and Will Smith
Intentionally kept secret temple from tourism Cricut in Bangalore \nhttps://youtu.be/CzjIbL89PTE
...Barack Obama and Beyonce...  And to answer your next question, Yes. It is because they are black, like most prominent political figures and entertainment performers.
Am I the only one in love with Jay Pharaoh at this moment?
I guess I'm the only one who thinks this is trite and painfully awkward. Obviously pre-rehearsed like these impromptu games always are on talk shows.
if you can get Jamie to laugh you are funny
Damn Ellen u too sweet I love u
This made my week
Dam that kid is good wow shieeetttt
‘ Hold On Fam . You aint bouta put me in the NO ford Focus 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💰
Why the hell did SNL can Jay? Just dumb.

This cat Jamie Foxx come out of the closet yet or still hiding
This is what I've always wanted to see! Good team ellen
😂 did they come dress alike? Or it wasn’t planned
I always knew the home alone kid had talent.
Some good head paint in this video
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
His Jay Z was spot on.
Why is Jaime holding back!
nobody wants to be in the Ford Focus

KANYE WAS SPOT ON WTF
It seems like they asked Jay what impressions he does every time he's on TV and then just gave Jamie people who don't have any notable speech patterns
gotta give it up for jay pharaoh you can tell he came from a good family. parents look like good people.
LMAO hilarious
Jay pharaoh is so inappropriate
slavery is real
Could have done wonda

No one is saying your getting lame....However eating fast is what you do so smashing this in 90secs is still frankly boring. We want to see you eating 15pds of food testing your capacity rather than eating a pizza quickly. Most competitive eaters have at least a 12 pd capacity so go big or join the queue
$5 to join your league for free?? 🤔
I’m just waiting for a video officially announcing that he’s dead from all this
Who else is fasting while watching this
How does he not bite his tongue or finger while eating like that 🤣
Damn Matt you have the stomach of steel
but u havent done the biggest pizza in the world that challenge what furious pete did id would be fun if u would do that challenge
Matt's content has gone down hill so badly.  Used to be creative, hard, fun challenges.  Now it's just some shit stuck on the end of the advert.  He's got lazy with it
MATT!!!  WHY DONT YOU DO THE HOW MANY JELLO CUPS CAN YOU EAT? CHALLENGE???  I can eat 24 cups!!! 🍸💕
Hi\nDo you need to make yourself puke after your challenges?
For just 5 bucks you can join for free!
Do something that tastes  awful but would also be really hard. Like a DURIAN challenge!!! And challenge other eaters on YouTube!!!
So it's free but you pay five dollars
This was bad u better make up for it

You should eat baklava ! İts so calorily food !

I would like to try a pizza like that. Minus the mushrooms, of course.
For 5 dollars u can play for free... I like it

You could get in the world record books for eating so quick m8
He shuts the fuck up and starts eating at 1:36
How long do you think it will be before Leah Shutkever posts a vid of her smoking Matt's time. But she'll get a 9 inch pizza, no toppings, and it will be thin crust. And she'll say she beat him lol. She's a joke.
Pizza Hut is the worst. Could’ve picked almost any other pizza chain.
Can you make a video of what do you do or how do you feel after eating like a lot of sugar..  (any sweet food  challenge)
Anyone else want to see his stomach without a shirt on just to see how bloated he is? I wonder what his stomach/chest looks like when he eats around 10 pounds of food.
Bro we have same shirt
You are absolute savage!
14 of dough & 12 of toppings.
Please eat 5 big dairy milk chocolars

Matt Stone dares you to eat a whole Mcdonald's menu, and you're going to face it?

I've never seen this film, but it looks boring and uninspired.
Oh fuck that Deadpool made me want to shoot my head off
Did you see a movie called Starkid?
Nothing more satisfying than watching My favourite NC Critic character beating up my least favourite kind of Comic Con attendees
Imagine how great would be see Major Thunder review with some russian movie critics, like BadComedian or Chuck review...
Nostalgia Critic you should review the hobbit 1977
While I think this film is not as terrible as depicted here it is indeed still rather uninspired. For a better fix, one can always watch the Green Lantern animated series :)
Personally, it would’ve been kind of funny if, when trying to figure out the Green Lantern oath, they referenced the Duck Dodgers version.
With Jigsaw coming out soon you guys should do Saw! It's like 13 years old, that's old enough right?
Why is NC taking a shit in the thumbnail
the intro made me feel like i was waiting for a movie to begin on a vhs tape.
I think you're over reacting, movie wasn't that bad.
Does anyone blame Ryan Reynolds for the failures of Green Lantern, Blade Trinity, or X-Men Origins: Wolverine?
What even happened in this movie 0____o
Jesus christ that deadpool shit was cringey as living hell
Finally after all these years they're almost at 1 million subs. Can't wait👍🏼
To Err Is Human
you are just a unfunny and boring version of CinemaSins
Doug , thank you for helping Mexico , I´ve seen so few people taking about it outside my country, thank you very much
That proposal was both gross and adorable.
Taika Waititi is in this movie?! Crazy.
I gotta say I do have to agree this was not that great of a movie but at the same time I did enjoy it the first time seeing it just not any time after that
The narrator in the movie's intro sounds a bit like Obi Wan.
What's that music used for the IT preview?
He needs to review Miss Peregrines home for Peculiar children. Do yourself a favor and see the movie FIRST before reading the books
6:13 as someone who's in the military, that technology is better than what we are given.
Will the IT review be posted on the channel because I don't live we're the event is
Does anyone remember when Duck Dodgers did a crossover with Green Lantern?
I really hope Ryan Reynolds stumbles upon this.
they got many things wrong with this  film but they also got a lot of stuff right
I got my ticket for Wednesday. See you guys there!
What was with the IT begging....it was terrible booo
Abin Sur was voiced Temuera Morrison? How did I not know that?
I honestly forgot about this movie
If Ryan Reynolds was Tommy Oliver.
Please do The Iron Man 3 episode!
6:55\nA pity, that nobody ever invented a device, that would help a pilot to exit his plane fast and relatively save in an emergency.
I never saw this movie but I always thought it looked horrible. The Green Lantern is one of my favorite superheroes. I watched the John Stewart version of him on the Justice League TV series and green is also my favorite color.
I like this movie as a guilty pleasure.
green is not a creative colour
Now we're gonna make him review Marvel's Inhumane! 😂
This movie uses more special effects than a fucking video game.
For a moment there I thought I saw Jon Favreau at 6:30.\n\nHe doesn't deserve that kind of misunderstanding. Especially with this film.
Nathan fillon should have been in this movie...
Critic's makes a lot of faces and blinks alot
THE EMOJI MOVIE IS WORSE THAN FOOD FIGHT x9999999
I think Deadpool cosplays can be funny when you have someone who not only put effort into his costume, but jokes as well.\n\nThe Deadpool in this review strikes me as the person who saw Deadpool in the theaters not knowing who he was and went to a Convention the very next day as him.
What is said at 3:10?
Yeah this movie was a little bad but I still like it a lot.
Ho are you what did you do to Nostalgia Critic tell me now
wait ...honest trailers could get ryan Reynolds ...but NC can't?
i remember watching this when I was 5.. I was stupid
I love the Deadpool segments
oh, S10 means season 10! I thought it meant it costs 10 dollars to view. (It started showing ads in masse when I last tried to click it)
I knew it , he did shave his head!
Just because you're dressed as Green Lantern doesn't mean you're Green Lantern.........but it does mean you're Deadpool.............i'm confused
I remember waiting for a sequel after the first film, I was probably high that day
They should have went with the black one.
Never had to forward a Youtube Video because of ads and long intro. :( seems to be a trend here now, as compared to the old days
The most exciting thing in the Green Lantern movie was the 1971 Dodge Challenger he owned.
I thought the visuals were alright it's the writing that killed it for me
free society everyone share the idea shut down the government close down the banks open the borders implement free reasource based economy lets free our selfs. Free society society watch venusproject
this is something from Michael bay film
I would take a bus to go about four states over to Chicago if I could, but it's on the same weekend as a show that I'm performing at. ;A; DAMMIT!
Omg they brought back the characters for however briefly! I love hyper!!!!!
3:24 Love that smile couldn't be less honest
I hope you don't have to review TROLLAND and if you do, may god have mercy on your soul.
The only good DC movies I can name\nBatman begins\nThe dark knight\nWonderwoman \nThat's it...
Wait, wait, wait..... why does the critic keep shaving his head?
you should review house of the dead
do you think this Green Lantern movie would have been better if it was fully animated?
I have the same birthday as Ryan Reynolds.
I love the new episodes of Nostalgia Critic. It's like the show is going back to basics with no dumb skits...
The recent animated Green Lantern movie is better.
Please put the IT 2017 review on YouTube
Mr Critic, can you review Johnny English please?
Still can't wait for the 2020 new Green Lantern Movie!
So no Sinestro movie then?
Ballshit face I've come to bargain\n(Comment section do your thing)
Trying to copy cinema sins too much
HA! Moron :D
I really recall you being funnier
Oh dear god its memepool......
It sucked
Yawn..
16:36 HOT WHEELS!  BEAT THAT!
Review Boss Baby 👶 🍼
Ahhhhh! I wondered why cosplay deadpool was here. The conclusion made sense. haha
Nice it crowd reference
Was Devil Boner using a Negan Bat?
You made Deadpool annoying
Pleasssssse review zoom
23:11\nLucille was thirsty...
OMG THAT IT CROWD REFRENCE!
(Whiny bald goat nitpicks really bad CGI movie)
I must disagree about the CGI - I feel it was pretty good for its time.
Honest i like this movie
This is why ive never watched deadpool even tho loads of people say its great, cos i just see the deadpool character as doug sees the deadpool cosplay character
This guy's voice and style is extremely obnoxious. I've seen cinema sins get alot of hate for being an over critical douche when this balding middle aged man takes it to new levels.
Wendy looks good here hair and makeup
She's doing that lil kim proud by looking more modified every time she appears
She seems like a lot of fun
The hell she got on tho?
The Real is so bad without her involved.
Tamar is so awesome! I'm loving her look and her nails are incredible!
I love Tamar! She's always kept it real, one hun! I'm so glad I watched her to derived my own opinions about her!
7:30 The nostalgia hit hard. I love the Muppets!
My god I just want to hang out with her!
Im really happy for her. It looks like shes matured a lot and took time to really focus on being a better person. Hope she continues to grow
 I have no issue with nobody but the devil lmao I looooove Tamar 😂😂😂
Tamar looks pretty. I definitely can't wait until Toni Braxton comes back on here💜
why did I think Wendy was going to go for her butt when she hugged. Tay lol!!
She's picked up some weight!! 😍😍
Tamar need to understand that unfollowing and unfriending others on social media speaks volumes nowadays. Totally understand why Monica decided to one-up her and block her.
Tamar is the beautiful badd friend that everybody wants☺🇺🇸
Flipping love Tamar
Tamar is looking so gorgeous
Not their real hairs not their real noses! LOL
Love this!!!!
She should go on The Real
WENDY YOU SO Dumb right now your playing your self your not only trying to play your Cohosts but your fans that actually support You! Nobody is that stupid. You got a big mouth only when it's beneficial to you. Your a fraud and your slowly being exposed!!
Tamar looks great! I can't believe she is 40 years old. She looks late 20s early 30s.
Wendy if somebody is willing to give the tea shush lol
Why dont she just change management keep businesses businesses and family family and  like TayTay came so far  with her career We love your Voice. You are a great singer. I know shes not quit  music but damn i want a nother abulm like Calling all lover the New one its alright but hey  I  love her though.
Tamar, I hope the designer of those boots you're wearing is paying you a fee to promote their brand. Ijs.
Kitten friendly??? Those are a good 5 inches
Am i the only one who dislikes Tamar??? She's so narcissistic.
I had been avoiding this video on my suggestions , but I'm glad I finally let it play
I love you Yamr and miss you on the Real ' when you left so did I
THIS NEW TAMAR IS GIVING ME LIFE💙💙💙💙
I thought black doesn't crack if she's 41 and then I'm 21 again get the f*** out of here
I am now a fan of Tamar Braxton, she is so funny and cool!!
She so extra but I love her spirit!
You can't help but love Tamar man she is such a ball of energy!!
This is as good as an interview gets. Funny and not afraid to talk. Conversations > interviews
Christ on a bike, way toooo much plastic and Botox on show for my liking!
,,I unfollowed about 30 people\n(...) and Vince had a taping spirit... (...) (she meant to say that her husband that has no insta etc. accidantly liked a shady post from brandy about monica) come on Tamar!!! Who do you think you fooling girl?!!😑🐸☕
I love me some Tamar 😂
love tamar but she needs to listen to people who are telling her to leave her face alone
I don't care what anyone have to say. I love Tamar.
Tamar seems so sweet and humble. The boots are 🔥🔥🔥🔥.
And The Real has not been the same without Tamar!
Nice interview. But why she hug my sistuh like dat? 21:28 lol
It's not Tamar isn't a interesting person. It's just that for daytime t.v. as a host (like when was The Real Daytime) I can see way her personality wouldn't work nor did it last long. Tamar can sing her was off but I think she needs to stay doing reality TV and or become a judge on something or even a host for like Love & Hip Hop kind of shows. Basically anything late night tv would be nice
Beautifull  I love  her  new take on life  always a fan
Shi walk in lik MI's nene
A*2*the*MEN! HUNNY!!!! TELL IT TAMAR! I completely understand
She so funny im so confused as to why she wld say this is her last album she been tryna do music for so long.. now this the last album? Hmm
she's thick!  what happen?
I really really likeTamar. She has this bratty but very down to Earth factor.
That’s one thing I wished interviewers would ask these artist! Tell us about the cover art work! Obviously, it has to mean something to them in order for them to have selected it. Unless, it was done by the record label it helps make sense of their music and album as a whole.
In love with the outfit
This is coming from a woman who thought nothing of Tamar!  But great job!  And I wish you well on your growth journey!
Tamar is so misunderstood.  I appreciated her honesty.  God Bless Ms. Tamar!
I’m here for the entire outfit! 🔥
The way she said birdman....😂😂😂😂
I have to be honest. Tamar is ENTERTAINING. I was cracking up and rewind this like crazy hahaha
Is that the hypothermia blanket hooker look?
Tamar's blend game is on point! Love this makeup artist!
she changed a lot I'm happy for her I can watch her in this space she was to over the top b4 but congrats Tamar.
I just believe Vince never wanted Tamar to have professional independence in the industry.  I hope her decision to not make another album is her own decision and not an attempt to please her husband.  Tamar you are still doing a lot with your career so leave The Real situation behind you.  Don't allow that situation to control your mind and destroy relationships with others around you.
That dress and boots!!! Love!!!!!!
Realizing How much I missed this girl remember He tried it, Get ya, your life Yess T do your thing ❤
Tamar is my spirit animal when she start going down that list of people she unfollowed 😂😂😂
I love love Tamar! !!!! I want your shows back Tamar!
I love her outfit!
One of my faves, gotta love Tamar!!
My breasts are still mine...😩... oh the shade... but unknowingly
I wish it was longer she's very entertaining!
I love Tamar's boots...Girl where did you get it?
Damn I wish I had a friend like Tamar!
I love me some Tamar.
She's a blessing. This interview made me really love her!
Tamar is funny af!!!😂😂😂
Two fake bitches
Love Tamar
yaaaaaaaas that wig z giving me life....
Tamar 😴😴😴
Tamar's look is on point. Loving the hint of blue nail polish too.
Wow, I've never bought any of Tamar's albums, but I can listen and look at her all day lol
7:37 her face tho when Monica blocked her 😂😂😂
Instant like. Tamar I know its in the past, but loved you on the Real. Love her personality and sis is stunning here.
Ta Monster looks Amazing I love that picture with the wings
I wish she would stop lip-syncing her voice is way too beautiful to be lip-syncing like she does
Tamar keeps it real ✔people hate the truth 💯
I love Tamar
She beefs with everyone
Tamar is gorgeous!!!
https://youtu.be/AapWWmI8dSo

Absolutely love Tamar!
I’m obsessed with future friends
I GOT THE ALBUM LAST WEEK AND EVERY SONG IS FIRE!
When's the Melodrama medley coming out?
If you want a good show with hot boys in leather BBC The Musketeers.
It really showed you both would be awesome if you had an indie film. Road trip film for the summer maybe? Everything you do is GOLD... at least... & Platinum.
I just watched their first videos and I'm literally crying I'm so proud of y'all ❤️
It feels like forever since the last time you’s sat in front of the camera 😂❤️
when Hoying said One Piece i literally thought he meant the anime
I laughed so hard through all of this
Aaaaaa congrats guys! You guys are killing it, keep up the amazing work!
Why do they both look so sexy rn
Every time I come back to this channel, Matts image is always different
THE 'STACHE IS TOTALLY WORKING
I'm such a fucking weeb, when Scott said one piece I immediately thought Mitch was gonna reply with a one piece character goodness me
If y'all don't make a Guy.exe video that's basically a Weird Science parody, it's going to be a real missed opportunity.
SHE IS SO FUNNY
Who else thought of the kpop groups when they said one piece and two piece
I was waiting for Mitch to say and my name is Two Piece and A Biscuit.
Lol she said my name. 😂
THE GOOD PLACE  THATS WHERE I KNEW HER FROM
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
i'll never be over you two. y'all are so incredible :)
Now do you have a BEARD Mitch?!! Oh and BTW there's this app called Flipagram and I believe you shall get a account of flipagram!
LORD ITS TRENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS OML I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE SO MUCH PENTAHOLICS AND KIDS HERE LORD OF THE HOLY UNICORNS!
Post Malone wrote I Fall Apart because Mitch forgot about him.
Is it just me or is Mitch copying Scotts facial hair? Either way, keep it up Queens! ❤️👑👑❤️
How ironic is this, I missed a superfruit notification, because I was doing a superfruit binge 😭😂😂😂❤️❤️
The album is amazing! Congratulations ❤️
i was hoping the names would be like \n“my name is horse”\n“my name is cowboy and i’m gonna ride you”
You're trending on YT and Im a proud momma!
God she is funny
All of the shirts that Mitch wears, I want
SCOTT DID THE FALLING ASLEEP THING AGAIN AHHHHHAHAHAHAHA
i love these music videos SO much, but I'm excited for sit down videos like this again, you guys are killing it with balancing them though and its insane how far this channel has come in such a short time:)
Only 90’s kids will remember the time when this was called ‘HURRY UP BLOOPERS?’
When Scott said One Piece I was secretly hoping that Mitch would say Cowboy Bebop because of his shirt 😅
Hurry up and make an album with Mars Argo
1:33 put that audio inside a stuffed bear because that's the cutest two seconds I've ever heard in my life
Janet! :D The whole exchange with you guys and her was fantastic. I was laughing the whole time. XD
i was hoping for Deny U music video this friday
Mitch. Bring the septum piercing back and throw the porn stach out! 😂
Mitch looks different everytime I see him 😂😍
4:18-4:33 what every scomiche shipper thinks. She knows what's good!!
Mitch what the fuck is up w ur hair and facial hair.
at first I didn't like Mitch's mustache, but then I started watching Parks and Rec
She is HILARIOUS in The Good Place.
I love the most is they always put their weekly obsession and also their week songs they love ! I mean I wish all YouTubers would do that !
i love mitch's hair like this
They’ve been\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating?\no-o \nO-o\nO-O
4:18 wouldn't we all
Lmao I've been born and raised here in Hawaii so when Scott pronounced poke bowls the first time I cringed SO MUCH lol but I'm just happy that he is eating Hawaiian foooodd
I’m so proud of y’all!!! Like I listen to talks music on REPEAT but I’m so happy y’all like poke and true blood because they are literally the best
My song of the week is Mitch's song of the week
How am I just now realizing how much they look like Mitch and Greg from ASAPscience. like BRO the similarities are AMAZINGGGG.
Omg when Mitch throws the imaginary Pokéball at 6:50 I just died.

Cum guzzling tramps

Hey dudes! You guys are fags!
When Mbappe is more matured than Neymar/Cavani/Alves combined.
Bayern are trying to finish 3rd so they can face Arsenal in the Europa League  knockout stages and beat them again.
Mbappe destroyed Bayern what a performance
Where's Arsenal in the programme
It's looking good for the English teams
United need to start playing some passes back rather than just shooting, because they had players in much better positions. This could've easily been 7-1
5:33 is messed up listen to the audio
A English team is definitely going far in this tournament
Steven Gerrard is honestly one of the worst pundits. He talks nonsense every week. He talks about Atletico never being torn apart like that yet Real Madrid beat them 3-0 twice last season
Even Celtic have won more than Looserpool lmao, currently the worst British CL team and the embarrassment of English Football (Apart from Arsene Wenger FC).\nChelsea, City, United and Spurs are class 👌
Lol RIO is such a Londoner I love it it's illegal 😂👏🏾
Gerrard always salty about Rashford and Man Utd in general
Lukaku too powerful
As a Man Utd fan I'm really glad Chelsea won. It's good to see English teams putting up a good fight in Europe right now compared to the horrendous few seasons we've had before in Europe!
Martial FC
Its illegal what he's doing, not allowed, get out of the stadium
How does Costa feel now?
No surprise from Stevie g to make comment like that about a Manchester united player saying mbpappe is world class and not rashford
All UK teams \n\nMatch Day 1\nCeltic - Lose \nMan City -Win \nMan Utd - win \nSpurs - Win\nChealsea - Win (sorry if i spelled wrong )\nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\nMatch Day 2 \nCeltic - Win \nChealsea - Win \nMan Utd - Win \nSpurs - Win \nMan City - Win \nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\n This shows that liver pool are the best team in the champions league
Bt sport are great this year but they need to get rid of Owen
Wrong commentary at 5:30
English Teams 👏👏👏👏 But Liverpool🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Neymar>Mbappe<Lukaku>Martial<Morata<
Martial >>> Mbappe
Come catch up with whether my door is locked
if mbappe is world class then what does that make gabriel jesus
Manchester United best team in England ❤️
What's with the music?
Boom CHELSEA CHELSEA ARE THE BEST ARSENAL FANS DONT MESS WITH US
stevie, micheal owen was world class at 18, he won a ballon d'or and everything!
Neymar right now is on his own at the top, best player in the world.
Check out the full fight video of England cricketer Ben Stokes on my page
I would love to see an English team in the CL finals
The music for Juve made me think Dybala hit the post haha
BT's pundits are the worst. They do remember Madrid tearing them apart last season 3 times right?
Mbappe is so LIT 💥 its almost illegal what he's doing in the pitch ⚽️
Now what happened to the commentary at 5:33
got the commentary wrong at like 5:50 with lewandowski
Never thought the team id be happy to get in the last 16 would be Barca
Lukaku is the definition of a overrated tap-in merchant.
The commentary at 5:43 does not refer to what is being shown on screen. Its hilarious. Bayern are on the attack but listening to the commentator you'd think PSH had had the shot.
Look whoever keeps saying Rashford is better then Mbappe is on crack he has potential to be better then neymar rahsford will be lucky if he reaches rooneys potential lets be honest he has great players around him where mbappe didn’t come from the bottom and worked hard
Psg got lucky
Fantastic coverage
Lukaku more like Donkeykaku lolz
5:33 doesnt make sense
BT Sport > Sky Sport > BBC Sport
Wheres arsenal... oh wait
Chelsea make their Mark
Roma only beat Qarabag 2-1? Very weak score
Fair play chelsea
5:32 audio mixed up???
Higuine
Common chels!!!
Loved Bayern getting raped by Paris
5:33 ...
Haha costa
mBappe 😁😁😁
umtiti and semedo >>
5:40 I'm confused
5:30 lol
Shouldn't the title say 27th instead of 28th? :D
Anyone know the song name and artist for the song played during the PSG vs Munich Highlights?
Benfica are nothing without Ederson in goal
david luiz.. what a liability
1:54 Conte's cunting the floor lol
liverpool will be the first English team knocked out ...
The English teams are improving, so far so good!!!!!!
Just saying but Lukakus goals were both VERY lucky. Moratas goal was seriously a gem
get rid of Chris Sutton
Wow Benfica are truly awful
Anyone notice Liverpool's game was not shown. 😂
I love seeing Athletico lose for some reason. Shaping up to be a stacked knockout round this year.
Great to see English teams doing well! I'm envious Arsenal aren't a part of it. What a win by Chelsea, just superb, United looked clinical and City will be tough for anyone to defend against. Good for Spurs too, it's about time their fans enjoyed watching a decent side. Hopefully Liverpool will improve to make it 5/5 in the last 16, Anfield needs more big nights. As for my team, well I'm off to Belarus, should be fun. Would love to see us win the whole thing.
Jan Oblak??????
september 27th - not 26th ------- terrible mistake
Carlo Ancelotti has been Sacked
Its funny how it perfectly fits on his trunk
So they are using kids now...
I like how he drove by the first time casually to scope the place out.
Cops later pepper sprayed and tazed this kid.
That did fit so perfectly in the back of his car, i would forgive because of that reason alone.
Quick right down his license plate number
Hilarious!
not cool.
He literally brought it back two minutes later after driving it around. \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Shit I'd press charges teach that little fucker early.
He thought real hard about it before he picked it up
What happened later? Follow up?
Don't blame the kid! Blame the delivery service! OR BETTER: blame the stupid laws, that allow a delivery service to leave a package unattended at the porch!!!

This is the 3rd British Youtuber in a week with the exact same vlog format for this lipstick brand AD. I mean, I'm not mad cause I like your vlogs and you got to pay your bills but they're really over-saturating YouTube with this campaign.
That blue coat😍 it's from other stories too?
omg that drummer man looked like someone soo much.. who the heck did he look like!!
Love this type of videos ☺️💕💕
Think the more 🍅 jumper looks like Velma from Scooby-Doo xd, definitely the boss bitch coat!! The name says it all. I liked the first red jumper and the 2nd :)
I don't mind the AD you put in any video, keep them videos coming Sam, it's awesome! 😄
You looked really good in that first red jumper ! You look amazing in everything though! Lol love the coat on you 💕👑
what store was she in with the boss btch coat ?
Looved the blue coat,but I would definitely go for the one you ended up picking up! I wanna go coat shopping too hahah I have a coat but I want a longer one :P Also liked both the second and the last sweater you tried on you. Looks like didnt end up with either of them though. Loved coming along shopping love that kind of vlog x
Samantha you're a sweetheart !! Really enjoyed watching this video, this coat looks great on you :-)
LOVED THIS!! please do more, shopping is my favourite thing xD
Love the lip colour on you! Do you think it'd be good for someone who struggles with applying lipstick?
Loved come shopping with me vlogs, would be interesting to see where you go for coffee/food/drinks when you're in london! I always love trying new places and would be interesting to see where you enjoy going!
Feus de Bois candle is the most beautiful candle at diptique I burn it summer winter spring dont care love it. goes well with the lavender. I burn both when putting my babaa to bed. very soothing.
the Tomato colored jumper was amazing on you! It maked you pop!
Hey guys!!! I've been following Samantha Maria for about ten years, and she's inspired me to start vlogging! If you have time, please check it out... I just started grad school, so I'm vlogging about my PhD experience. Sam, if you see this, I hope you'll check it out, too! (I posted this comment on one other video, but I'll stop now because I don't want to spam :o )
The blue coat was looking super good on you.
Isn't her foundation a little bit orange in this video? Especially in the beginning..?or is it just me maybe 🤔😂
You always look so so beautiful and i love you as a brunette, it is so natural and fresh on you 😘
I NEED that coat.
You look so good and this was a great vlog!!
I've seen other british youtubers do the Bourjois lipstick test, and their video was marked as an AD. Isn't this one an AD as well?
What was the name of your Jo Malone perfume?  You're gorgeous!
I love the coat.
Great buys Sammi!
Sam! Your eyebrows looks amazing 😍
love the 2nd jumper and the boss bitch coat lol! :)
Love to watch your videos Sam. You look amazing wearing that lipstick and your hair looks so so nice too. You seem so happy and I'm glad for you 🤗 Love the coat and I'm in love with that blue ruffle dress 😍😍😍 Lots of love from Holland
i'm going to head up to london i thought she would be living in london. Anyone can help me here?
I live in Amsterdam and tried the same coat in & other stories! Loved it! So soft. But was a bit worried about all the rain in fall and winter. What do you think? Will it ruin the coat..?
Just watched about 8 of your vlogs 😂😂 #sammicatchup but seriously loved every single one!
❤ your vids so much . You have great understated style
Love the video I need to go shopping with u lol 🙌🏼✨
You didn't really pick the best colour to be testing out because it's so similar to your lip colour. Just a suggestion to try a darker or bolder colour next time
I loooooove the first red sweater
God this channel is shit..
I loveeee ❤️ the black boots. Does anyone know the brand of the boots?
I am OBSESSED with the coat!! I need something like it in my life!
Which red jumper did you choose? My favourite was the second one
If I were to visit London, I would ask you to go shopping with me! love your blogs sam!
Absolutely LOVE the coat 😍
The coat looks so good on you! I definitely think you made the right choice - stylish and classy 😍 xoxo
yaaay I love this blog. where are the high shine pointed boots you were wearing from? x
<3 You pull of so many looks. Love your style. You inspire me to create my own style and experiment out of my comfort zone.
I'd love to see more of these videos 🙌🏼
😍 Oh I love love the black coat! It looks so great on you. I'm from Florida so of corse we don't get the weather to wear a coat like that. Also the earrings are beautiful!
It's interesting to see you debate investing on a winter coat since those are the things I find myself willingly splurging on. About 5 years ago I bought a €150 coat and a €50 and while the first one is still going strong, the second has been replaced after a year of wear because it was wrecked. I would rather invest in such a staple than in trendier pieces such as jackets and shirts.
You look so happy! Love seeing you this way 😊❤
Loved this video!! I really love how we get to see  the thought process behind what you choose to buy and not just the haul portion of the video. By the way what foundation are you wearing because your makeup looks amazing in this video :)
Loved it:) def would enjoy if you do those more :) xx love the coat, suits you so well
I love this video! Here in Denmark we have a coat/Blazer that reminds you very much of the one you looked at in Mango. It's called 'neo noir wales coat', and it's really good quality, and it fits so well!! <3
YES PLEASE, do more videos like this if you can, seriously it makes me feel like I'm with you, going around shopping :D and also its obviously so awesome to be able to see what kind of staple pieces you choose to buy!
I haven't watched you before but this was fun!
I really enjoy come shopping with me videos (:
Yes more videos like this please! Love your coat btw! 👏
That blue coat on you was EVERYTHING 😍😍
The lipsticks look great. And the color you chose looks great. I just feel like they will be so drying. All the long lasting ones are. I might try one. Love the coat you bought.
Love these type of videoes! Definitely do more please! xx
Yeah made my day as usual
I loved the blue one as well :) You looked very nice with it too. Probably I'm telling you because I love blue color.
where are your boots from?
This hair color and texture reminds me of Mariah Carey in the 90s
Well done for vlogging when it was so busy!!! I think I would have chickened out xx
Almost 500k!!! I remember watching your get ready with me while you were in uni
I enjoy your videos because your personality isn't fake and cloying. You just seem authentic and down to earth.
anyone know the song in the back at 6:07?
Song name and artist please @6.23
Loving your hair right now Sam!  The colour the texture, it's so suits you!
When you showef the lip color range; my eye went straight to the color you chose to wear.  It's a lovely color. Good choice girlie. Also, you looked really good in the orangy-red jumper. It was a nice Fall color.
Please do more of these!!! So in love with the coat, great video :)
Hi Sammi, just curious why don't you wear blush?
Love it! Samy where is your bag from?
The second red jumper looked lovely on you, I hope you bought it x
I love this video style and hearing your thought process about picking out pieces and then deciding which one to get if you do buy one
I love seeing your shopping videos
Really enjoyed this.  The coat looks amazing but truthfully, everything you tried on looked beautiful.  I actually really liked the second red jumper but I know comfort is important and that material is far too itchy scratchy for my liking. Anyway, thanks for a lovely vlog.
The coat is lovely and you look so good in it, lovely vlog Sammi 💕👍🏻
For all the American ladies, Target (yes babygirl, Target) has a Prince of Wales check blazer for 34.99 that KILLS. I was floored at the quality and fit. Karenbritchick put me on to this and I will love her forever for it. Go get it while you can. The size is spot on but I sized up because I like a little slouch and give. It really is a jewel and a quality bargain. . I wish you could get your hands on one Sammy. Ok back to watching, lol.
Where is that leopard print bag from?? I NEEEEED 💕
Loved following you round! Also, as a longtime subscriber it was cool because I knew which pieces were more Sam haha. 😘\n\nI think I will wait a while before getting the bourjois lipsticks.. whenever a brand does a big campaign and sponsors a lot of Youtubers etc, it makes me suspicious. Lol. I want a product that sells itself.
Loved everything about this video!
love that coat !
I forgot, Zara has amazing red sweaters
❤️
Love your darker hair!
Bourjois lipsticks are amazing :)
Love your outfit!
Love watching your shop.
Love your shopping vlogs keep them coming
Loved this video!
Thank you Sammi!! Love your vlogs :) <3
love that coat!
Love your style :D
Love the vlog, Sam 💕
One word - Lint Roller.  Beautiful coat. x
❤️💜🖤💛💙💚
Love your vlogs! Xx
Really enjoyed this hun xx
You are amazing
Yesssss Sammi! You are so great at styling I love videos like this
thanks for making great videos, i learned alot here. nicely done
Don't be afraid to prove some one, something or some belife wrong.
That stomach is a UCKERS
This video is amazing! Thanks and keep bringing content as great as it.
Being stabbed in the gut is also caused by bacteria, and made worse by stress.\nThis explains why Jamaican food tastes like dirt.
What does smoking not cause?
You guys are so cool, I really enjoy these lessons !! Keep going! :)
I cant watch this video when the narrator whistles his esses so loud, its a shame unsubscribed
I thought the first thing to do was to use antibiotics.
Big Brother is watching you!
he trsusted his guts . pun intended
I remember back in February I vomited like 9 times in the matter of 8 hours
I bet you could cure it with drinking bleach.
As an helycobacter pylori user i must say yeah everything is correct
i have never had this.
The link between stress and stomach ulcer/acid reflux could be because of reduced Melatonin. There are a number of recent studies showing lowered Melatonin in patients with stomach ulcer and acid reflux. Melatonin has regenerative and protective qualities in Gastrointestinal mucosa in addition to regulating sleep patterns. That could also explain lack of sleep accompanied by these symptoms when stress levels are high. A clear mind allows the body to heal.
There are plenty of herbs much better then the antibiotic the medicine has to offer.
Scientists that knowingly put themselves in danger to find answers are quite  some heroes.\nBut I ask myself: Is it ethical?\nWe already know it is unethical to put others in danger (even with their consent) for science.\nBut isn't it as unethical to put oneself in danger for science?\nIs it even legal?\n\nAlso. Is this something a scientist can do to circumvent the unethical act of using test subjects in dangerous experiments?
Doesn't H pylori cause inflammation by increasing acid levels in the stomach?
Unfortunately many people STILL believe today, in 2017, that stress is the CAUSE (keyword here) of ulcers. You can even read through the comments here and see the people who still fervently defend this notion.\n\nJust a reminder that even if all of the evidence says no, the hubris of people will deny it to satisfy their own ego or desire to be right. This includes scientists.
Whether H. pylori is detrimental to health in long term is still not clear. There is a theory that there is a **dynamic equilibrium** acting on our body in which different forces counteract with other. Since H. pylori have existed for such long time in humans stomach, and antibiotics is a recent approach to act against it, we should be able to eliminate them far earlier or suffer from it for a long time, which neither was the case. Given the apparent negative impact of antibiotics, it is highly doubted whether we should use them to eliminate this bacteria...
So every morning I get a upset stomach and ending up puking up bile or the food I ate before. Could I have a alcer?
I got gastritis but it was because I skipped lunches or breakfasts allot in college to save money..
I see lord of the rings reference, I like.
Could've seen this before my test.
Super informative, well organized script with awesome animation! Great job keep it up!
DON'T TOUCH ME I'M ______
I thought it was a virus and not a bacterium.
make video on why we fall down when we smell chloroform
Battle of the five armies...Oh no here comes a dragon fruit i call smaug
I demand my stomach to build a wall and keep this bacteria out
After my gall bladder removal the Docs pushed the NSAIDS (oral and iv) even after they were told I had issues with them in the past. Eight months later I am still suffering from gastritis, a culture of my inflamed stomach lining revealed NO pylori. NSAIDS interfere with the production of mucous in the stomach and have caused many catactrophic bleeding events. NSAIDS are more dangerous then they are letting on and stronger warnings should be in place.
Herbs are for the healing of the nation. Replace inorganic chemicals with natural herbs then maybe you'll live a few years longer. Herbs cure diseases and Rx Meds reduced your discomfort. It doesn't get rid of it. It's their way to make sure you keep coming back.  I get it though, everyone just wants to make money. Try a Bromide, it's good for your digestive system.  I make it myself. And happy to report that I haven't had any stomach discomfort for quite sometime. I was born with a sensitive digestive system. Everything and Anything would cause discomfort. If you want more info, hit me up.
Definitely gonna show my mom she has no idea why she has ulsers and now she will know!! Yay!! 🙂+😟
Guys, check out my latest social experiment 👇\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KF6gRtt9DdA
Anyone else learning this in health class right now?
Been watching this for 3 minutes. Can't watch anymore what causes it?
I actually had one and at  the time it open, which caused internal bleeding which lead to six months of isolation mixed with pancreatitis caused my transplanted kidney to fail after five years. ESRD came back and here I am 8 years still on dialysis waiting for transplant. :(
I have a question for future videos: How smart are dolphins?
Wow I’m over here with stomach pain because of my stomach ulcers  and this video pops up on my feed 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Someone might gag at this video.
I still don't get how we got those bacteria? Which of our activities make the bacteria causes the pain? How to actually avoid getting ulcers in related to this knowledge?
Good job at illustrating Stomach Ulcer!
Did I Enjoy it??.. I am Suffering from it.. I owe soooooo much to that doctor.. Still ain't cured but I'm getting there
Had 2 bleeding ulcers that were right on an artery earlier this year that required 2 emergency surgeries and was negative for H pilory. \nTurns out my great grandfather died from bleeding ulcers, my grandfather had ulcers and then I had these ulcers at the same age. \nWhile this is completely anecdotal it shows a genetic predisposition for my family and was able to give my doctors a look at a possibility of what otherwise seemed unheard of for my age.
For science!
I'd say chewing gum
Lovely animation
I’ll spicy your food...

i had ulcer ever since i was 9 now im 11
Titanium dioxide is put in many foods and it will end up in your stomach, these nano particles will act as Trojan Horse that will let bacteria penetrate your stomach lining with ease. I remember using chewing gum after every meal and always having very painful stomach problems, now I know that all chewing gums are full of Titanium nano particles.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
nice  and Informative video :-)
That don't sound right I ate a lot of spicy food and greasy foods and I developed ulcers because of that, the doctor confirmed it.
Believe me stomach diseases are more dangerous than some life threatening diseases. I have been suffering from IBS-C for last 10 years and at every point of my life it reminds me that I am badly sick. Stress is definitely one of the causes of developing these problems and the issue is that when you have IBS it brings stress with it even if you're doing well in your life it keeps you stressed hence it aggravates the symptoms and this cycle continues. IBS causes stress and stress causes IBS. The worse thing is that there is no cure for IBS in the medical world in 21st century.
You know you have balls of steel when you experiment on yourself. Wowza!
i got rid of my h pylori after 4 years
loved those awkwardly silent solid couple seconds of nothing but fish floating in acid
That abdominal pain is no joke my peeps, if youre suffering from Ulcers I highly recommend you seek help and get treated for it.
This video shows why we should not disregard those scientists who express doubt about Global Warming.  In this medical instance, two lone doctors turned out to be correct when the vast majority of their peers felt confident that those two doctors were clearly wrong to doubt the majority opinion on ulcers.  A new, correct, correct idea is usually discovered by just one or two maverick researchers, and it can take years before the majority of scientists come to accept that new idea.
We all know that ulcers are caused by pregnant ex girlfriends.
healthy Breakfast a day, keeps the ulcers in jail.
Moral lesson: We should legalize human experiments so that the valuable people won't have to suffer.

Apple vinegar can kill this bacteria in 40 days if you add 2 spoons in a glass with hot watter and drink it on empty stomach! Many people didnt get cured even with antibiotic it is havy to cure... http://www.grocare.com/blog/tag/h-pylori-natural-treatment-apple-cider-vinegar/
Medicine kills and no such thing as infectious disease. Antoine Bechamps terrain theory not pasteurization.
Did anyone Noticed in the Animation Barry and his associate was doing Bhangra after recieving Nobel Prize.
4:34 and was the joint pain killers helping the h-pylori? or was it a symptom of h-pylori infection?\n\n\n\n\nbecause i searched for relations between h-pylori and joint pain killers ans what showed up was that joint pains may sometimes be a symptom of h-pylori infection...
The animations is becoming better and better
I had an ulcer when I was 15. I know it isn't pain medication because I didn't use to take it. Is this quite young?
Can ulcer be cured permanently? My friend have this I'm worried about her.

I had stomach ulcer once after taking antibiotics. If it's supposed to kill HP, I wonder what caused it then? I am no medical expert as you can tell, but is it possible for HP to bypass the effects of certain antibiotics out there?

6:26 If you look carefully, you can see the cameraman
Sorry Zac but Dave Grohl did a better impression. Yours was still good.

I LOVE THE NAME VIENNA
When you pronounced Hudson, it sounded like Hoodson. I had to read the name on the screen. When you said shorten it to Hud, it sounds like Hood. I love accents. 🙂 Out of curiosity, how do the English pronounce hood? Is hud and hood pronounced the same?
I really like the names Essi and Autumn xx
my name is amber and my second name is Nova and my whole life I went by the name Nova and I've never heard anyone else with the name nova😊
You look gorgeous omg 😍
What eyeliner are you using in your waterline? & does it actually stay put and smudge proof all day? Ps love this look & vid!❤
I personally love the name Izzy but I know loads of people that call me Isobel because they don't like the shortened version 🤷🏻‍♀️
What app is it that you use for your cover photos?? Just got myself an iPad Pro 😁
Summer will be her top 3
When you put the girls names in pink I was like, hmmm I wonder how much shit she would get if she put the boys names in blue! I don't want children, but if I did I'd only want boys lol: Finn, Rory & Elisha! You should have a look into Jewish/Hebrew names Gabs, there's some lovely names that I've never really come across.
i never comment but you look so beautiful and stylish !
Daisy is now on my list lol
When I heard Blair, I thought of two things. Tony Blair and The Blair Witch Project.\n\nSorry Gabby! 😂
My name is Isabella 
My best friend is called Isabella no one ever calls her Bella or izzy because she hates being called anything but Isabella
I love the name Aprillll
Love you so much 💜 also I love Vienna, def putting that on my potential baby names list
Just for the record I've known about 4 people named Autumn and yes it is such a nice name!
My name was featured in this hahaha! Daisy is weird because it's kind of common but then again I don't actually know many other Daisy's. This is so funny as my dog is called Teddy Edward and I actually know a girl called Autumn with strawberry blonde hair! Such a coincidence. Love this video as always Gab and all of the names you have such a cool and different taste✨🌹
vienna is my #1 😭 a mum once called out to her gorgeous little daughter in the hairdresser saying “vienna” and i fell in love, it’s so beautiful
My name is Monika and I hated it almost all my life. Now Imm 29 and I actually quite like it. Maby because I feel this name is more unique in Scotland where I live than in Poland where I come from.
My nephews called Hudson and I definitely agree about it being American sounding but his brothers are called Lennon & Jaxon so they go well together
Sky is a beautifullll boys name but nobody has ever agreed with me😂 reminds me of mamma Mia aha
Oh my gosh Gabs you are glowing!! I want to come round to yours so you can do my makeup this beautiful haha ❤️
I love the boy name Clay 😊
Me and my cousin Isabella were able to choose my baby cousins name so we called her Gabriella Claudia! 💗
You remind me of poppy deyes so much 😮
Hi Gabbie I've got a great video idea for you I've snapped you it it's a pll tag and it's so fun and I'd love you to do it  it has so many questions that I'd love to know as Ik your a big pll fan like me xx ps Ly❤️❤️
I know someone called Autumn!!
Aww one of my best friends is called Liesel xxx
My sisters middle name is nova
Liesel sounds too much like weasel for me. But love all the other names you talked about! I too love the sound of music!
I have a niece named Izabella. We call her Bella
Also I hope this isn't too random, but I really think Desirae is such a nice name ^_^ xxxx
Love this video Gab!! At my work placement there is a girl called Autumn and she's so cute!! Loving the darker hair, it looks so good on you and it suits you so much, love you always!! Xx
Oh my god my childhood teddy was called Teddy Edward 😂😂😂
Love the names you love omg !! Sky is my favourite boy name, reminds me of Sophie’s fiancé in Mamma Mia the movie 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
My friends called autumn and her brother is called archer. Feel like you may have a similar asthetic to her mum 😁
Your hair looks so healthy and shinny, woah!! I'm thinking of dying it darker as well, love it😍 Out of all the names you said in the video, I love Blair, Nova, Daisy and Vienna, I would probably use Vienna too!
my parents let me name my cat when I was 8 and I named him tedward 😂
Ok so when you said Monica I thought that Isabella would be a good first name with Monica in the middle... Then you mentioned Isabella literally five seconds later 😱
Omggg I’m called Viana but it’s pronounced Vienna 💗 love you soo much
I’ve got a nephew called teddy xx
Not even pregnant but I know that I'm calling my first daughter Skye
Me and my brother both have four letter names because my parents didn't want us to have nicknames which hasn't worked 😂 Esme-Ezz and Toby-Tobs 😊
Hope your feeling better x
Love Autumn and Vienna ❤️ xx
I watch the sound of music with my nana, and we have bonded so much over that c
I absolutely adore the name Freddie for a girl 😍 my cousin has a friend called that and I think it's just gorgeous 😍😍
My surname is HUDSON!!!!!!!!x

My auntie is called Monica and her daughter is called Claudia 😘
I love the name Vienna but it's far too similar to my name❤️😭 ( Sienna)
i bloody love your dark hair! it suits you so much what the heck!!! love you xx
I love the French name Ninon so much but of course my sister decided to call her daughter Nina so my husband now doesn't like the fact that there will be a Nina and a Ninon in the family 😂 otherwise I love Stella and Emilia.
lol I hate it so much when people call me Izzy its such a rank nickname I don't mind Bella though
My sisters are called Claudia, Gabriella and I'm Isabella 😂❤
glad I'm not the only person who likes the name Autumn love it :)
Daisy here 🙋🏼 I feel like its such an old persons name hahah but glad ur a fan

PLEASE DO A MEETUP IN VIENNA PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE OMG

My top three names are:\nalysandra\navery \nlena
My sister in law is called Isabel but everyone calls her Isa :)
I love my name too 😳😘
I'm called Kate, but I noticed how you said you can't shorten it, and for me that's true however every single teacher decides to call me Katie and It annoys me sooo much x love u gabby
Two things: 1. You look gorgeous here. You always look gorgeous obviously but I am loving the eye look & your hair length. 2. Great idea for a video!! I've always had a long list of baby names on my phone...I mean I've had one since college which was like 8 years ago 😂😂. Thought I was the only single girl with a list of baby names haha. Ok a couple of my favorites for a girl are Nora and Holland. For a boy I love Rafe and Mac.
Can you do this makeup look? It’s so so pretty You look THE BOMB
“I was gonna call my cat Teddy, his name is Nelly, his proper full name is Penelope but now I call him Nelson....yeah”

Greetings from Austria ❤️🙋🏼🇦🇹
wtf!!! u are not pregnant and you have no kids yet u have baby names.....girls are NUTS!
I always wanted to call my baby girl Ava, but my boyfriend's surname is Braun. So I can't.
I love how she didn't express the fact that she thinks they're alike in negative way. She ''praised'' both songs and didn't pit one woman against each other. I gotta admit I didn't expect that answer but I loved it. Way to go Fergie!
I love a three way 🤣🤣👏🏽🤦🏽‍♂️
FERGIE is unbothered I love her.
nice way to dodge directly answering that question
I also love a threeway
Ok why andy feel the need to bring up Taylorswift in every interview?
The song actually borrows from I'm Too Sexy.
If it was Taylor she would be sueing to the godss
Andy: I love a threeway ... so casual.
wow she looks so gorgeous
Fergie is beautiful
Andy says, I love a 3-way. LMAO!!! I bet he does.
I love her!
First time I heard it I thought it was very Fergie!
It amazes me how Taylor has so many people hooked on her with such mediocre vocals and basic songs.
So both songs are shite, gotcha.
I also noticed the look what you made me do in both songs when I first listened to Just Like You. Love both songs!!
Of course they sound the same. Their music is all written by the same guy.
Yeeesss her voice is so lovely!! Sing it!
Don't they all have the same song writers lol
I can’t stand her
Not feeling taylors song at all!!!
They were probably written by the same person.
Most pop songs sound the same to make sure it speaks to the mass/mainstream and sell for millions
Fergie is an amazing live singer
I really like how nice and positive she is. ALSO WHEN SHE STARTED SINGING? Slay!
Sounds nothing like Taylor's song. She just want attention and views lol
I love a threeway? I bet the only threeway he had was with his dog and his TV remote control
It's like those vines where the guy's like oh is it the part that goes OHWAOooHAaaWAAAAOHWAAH?
Did anyone else freak out when she started singing? Such a pure voice! Love you Fergie!
What! The chorus for Taylor's song had the best sampled from Too Sexy For My Shirt song, so I am confused why Fergie name is in the same mix.
I love it i love a threeway. I bet you do you creeper lmao
Fergie threw no shade I love her
They probably share the same songwriter that's why.
We all love 3 ways!
Yeah, they are both shit.
As they used to say in the olden days Fergie's got CLASS.\nI said it right away about it sound like Fergie and the Black Eyed Peas
There are only so many combinations of music. Silly pricks trying to cause some drama.
That's a great answer to that question
Does anybody else cringe when people start singin like that?
Isn't she a mother of a child? Hmmmmm. Great goals!
Its true after hearing Taylor Swifts new song i thought she'd joined the Black Eyed Peas lol
I thought the song sounded like Boom Boom Pow rather than My Humps.
Where is the love?......remember that deep song....what happened? Do they have charities helping others?
Well they both took it from right said Fred - I’m to sexy.
Why would she care that it sounds the same, the chorus of the new Taylor Swift song is shit, monotone, repetitive and boring and with that being the case it says a lot about the chorus of her song.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that new Taylor swift song was meant for fergie
i love a threeway
What a legend
Nobody claps or whoops after she sung..burn!
I love a threeway! Lmao Andy
Both shit
They are both shite performers anyway.
Clever reply, classy lady.
👌 attitude. Classy lady!
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZ5phVyvAw
Haha ......... Silance             😂
Stop using Botox
So they're both shit artists ahhh I get you
first time I heard Taylor's song I was like this is so fergie humps
You know what? Fair play to her! I dont like Fergie i never have (except for the first 2 Black Eyes Peas albums and even then i didnt exactly LIKE her) but ive got a lot of respect after seeing this! She easily could have gone in for an attack on Taylor and point out how she sues everyone she can think of for the most pathetic and minor of similarities (she tried trademarking 'haters gonna hate' ffs a saying older than her and she wants to own it) but nope she kept a cool head and proved shes a better person than me 😂
I would suck the farts out of her baking bowl.
oh fergie you pig just shut your mouth and go back to the drawing board
Taylor Swift is a tranny. I was shocked when I found out the truth.
Irrelevant
poor thug
Die of aids
Taylor is cancer
THUMBS UP THIS VIDEO IF YOU’RE A KILLER!\n(Probably not the best name for the Kill’em family 😂)\n\nP.S.

Jamie! When you use baby facial for the first few times mix 2 pumps of the facial with 2 pumps of the oil. It adds extra hydration to the peel and makes it more balancing and your skin will be super soft. It also makes it a little more comfortable too. I'm obsessed with it and actually use it 2x a week religiously, but I had to work up to that. \nAlso, you just don't want to use anything with AHA/BHA/retinol/enzymes immediately after washing Baby Facial off. But surrounding days you def can. DE also recommends using the Marula oil after rinsing baby facial. \nI would do baby facial on Sunday, TLC 1-2x a week and maybe rotate in moonfruit 1-3x a week. I'm a Skin Lead at Sephora and highly recommend all the things you bought 😊
I think am cheap but I think that $6 for 1 mask is not  affordable
For UK people who can’t get sephora - the body shop do an amazing dupe for the drunk elephant baby facial! the vitamin C glow revealing liquid peel 🤓 you use it in the same way and it makes all your dead skin cells ball up and come off when you rinse it. it’s only £18 too, i swear by it 🙊
Hello
24 on trending! Whoop!
sephooda

Absolutely obsessed with you🙊

Jamie, this is #gaols & drop dat dough. P.s. Luv ya!
60 FPS makes me so uncomfortable
Love Hauls/favourites vids! And you! <3
Top video 😁😁
The thumbnail made me lol!!!!
Your face looks so amazing.... 😍😍😍
Great video💖💖💖🔝
Fake. Terrible judge of character
I NEED A TRIP TO SEPHORA! LIKE NOW! Who wants a trip to the USA? I need an enabler 😂😂😂😏
Why is the trending page of YouTube just an endless stream of women posting ‘look how much I spent at this shop’ it’s so vapid. YouTube is a platform to share something amazing with the world and this is all society can come up with?
I really like hauls like this so I'd love to see more! I also feel like it's time for another skincare routine 🙌🏼 xx
OMG I never realise that there was no Sephora in the UK! 😱
Im sorry but you look like the hotter Scottish version of Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner in some of your thumbnails
Hey Miss JJ, what foundation are u wearing, looks amazing !
Make up tutorial on this please Jamie, I love the olive green! Xx
Jamie, I just love you! You have quickly become my favorite YouTuber. You are so real and down to earth. I love that you also represent the tattooed and pierced girls out there. You are beautiful! 😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please do a makeup tutorial on this makeup, thanks
I arrived back from New York this morning for the for the first time in america! I spent $800 in Sephora 🙈😂 I was like a kid at Christmas 😂😂 I’m now bankrupt!! X
How many did u roughly spend all together
A good dupe for the drunk elephant baby facial is the body shop drops of youth liquid peel. Does exactly the same thing but is only £18. So gross but so satisfying at the same time !
For those of you who are old enough to remember, there used to be a Sephora on Oxford Street, London years ago but closed down. There are talks one will be opening in Westfield East London soon, shame it won't be in Central London like Covent Garden which is like Beauty Central. Whoop x
We need a tutorial on this eye look please Jamie, you look bloody gorgeous girl 😘
Are you going to review the new kat von d palette???
You said it rite the first time is said bosha and the feet mask is amaze balls it works very very well!
I live in the Netherlands and there's also no Sephora here! Seriously, Sephora step up your game and come to more European countries!!
Please do a first impressions/testing of that foot mask!!!
Hi Jamie, what product do you use to bring out your freckle? Thank you! You’re ace. 😘
It was not cheap but it was the last one, which make me think it was super necessary 😂😂😂 Thats so me.
Totally agree bring Sephora to the UK
You're camera quality is off the chain. Great vid, J. Thank you.
Tutorial on this look please, omg its amazing
am I the only one who got ASMR from 15:43
Girl when I was in New York I was spending thousands! I git to VIB Rouge status in a week 🙈😂
Hey guys! Hope you're having a great day. I make videos about food and it would mean the world to me if you gave my channel a looking, lemme know what you think. Much love!
WE NEED SEPHORA IN THE UK😭😭
Jamie you can use the drunk elephant baby facial and the tlc framboos at the same time just not on the same day so use the baby facial on Monday and then the rest of the week use the tlc framboos (I work at Sephora)
Please do a tutorial on applying lashes 💖💖💖
That Baby Soft Foot Mask is CRA CRAAAAA! Your skin peels off!!
hey any smaller youtubers want to support each other? xo
Jamie you need to do a tutorial on this eyeshadow😍💚
You and kaushal are my favourite youtubers I think you should do videos together
Do a tutorial on this look!! I love it!
I LOVE this eye look you've got on Jamie... tutorial pleaseeee xxx
It's almost become a daily routine to sit and watch your videos whilst doing my makeup ❤️
Ugh so jealous of this haul 😭 if you just use the Sukari Facial every 1.5-2 weeks, you can still use the DE night serum or other AHA products in conjunction with it! You just need to make sure you stay away from actives 3-4 days before you use the Babyfacial. Just listen to your skin, if you are over exfoliating it will let you know!!
Ugh I want to try all this stuff! I need more money 😩
can you do this make up look in a video plz
wish i could buy all this ughh hahaha
Omg Jamie, please do a tutorial/review on the rubber mask!!❤️
I live for your vlogs, and the hauls are always amazing too! Hope your jet lag wears off before your next trip!
And you're still not hot 💀💀\n\n\n\n\n\nLMAO issa joke
Girl ya just HAD to go and post a huge haul on payday! Desperately praying for my bank balance 🙃
Liked before i even watched just because of the oops in the thumbnail 😂😂
Girl. We N E E D a tut on this look.
I love that your hauls consist of so much skin care ❤️
It’s the farmacy products that came with the little spoon!
Yay yay yay! So happy a bigger YouTuber talked about Farmacy! I absolutely love that brand especially sleep tight and the honey potion moisturizer
please do a makeup collection x
Hey Jamie! Are you going to be dropping your teeth transformation video? Lots of love xM
Can you do a night time routine :)
hi Jamie!! I've seen you own the simple Human mirror...Do you like it for everyday make up?? I need one  and I would love to know your opinion!!\nthanks love, kisses from Spain
I think you can use the glycolic acid and the facial at the same time-- just not the same day. So, once your skin is used to it, I think you could use a schedule like this: TLC S-T-Th, facial F, rest Sat. (Although since they're both heavy AHA's that might be a lot of the same acid to put on your face... but you *could* is what I'm saying.) I do a similar schedule with lactic acid and a mandelic peel respectively, and my very chronically sensitive skin loves it.
Love you Jaime !!! Love that eye look, it's so beautiful!
I've become such a huge fan of yours . Everything about you is so real and classy . Your skills are insane and completely beautiful #girlcrushjng
Drunk elephant is such an amazing brand! For video ideas I still love the full face looks that you do, especailly when they're extra long. I'd love to see a classic bronze smokey eye from you. Those are my favourites to watch because everyone looks good in them
Please film the foot mask thing!
A fat stack of face masks 😂😂😂
I love getting your opinion on beauty products! Loved it xx
Her my face on her thumbnail made me click on it 😂😂😂like 😰
Jamie can you PLEASE do a review on the new Huda Beauty eyeshadow palette? I have seen so much controversy over it and I really trust and respect your opinions and honesty when reviewing products. Thanks love you xx
Your face in the thumbnail #canrelate 👌🏽
I remember when I was a kid and we had Sephora in the Uk- In London in Angel and Brent Cross. I guess they weren’t so successful at the time, but it was before blogging and YouTube ect really took off
Hey Jamie, would you be so kind as to do a basic gentle skin care routine from start to finish for newbies in this beauty world? :)
I love the Drunk Elephant Glycolic Serum, my skin has been so much better since I used it.
please do a vid about round eyes and a green eye makeup look. Also my eyeliner used to be perfect and its no longer awesome so a an eyeliner look where you really delve into semi-hooded eyes would be helpful. also please do a video on night skin care! love you Jamie! your the shit! I gather so much inspiration
I thought that said “Noon Fruit” hahahahaha
What eyelashes are you wearing in this vid? 😍😍
Wow your videos are blowwwing up lol I love it! I like the haul vids, for sure! Keep doing them! Could you do an updated brow routine (+ any tips with eyebrows that don't grow symmetrically, or up in the center? Weird but I can't figure it out and I just want your brows :( \n\nWould also love to see a NAF trip vlog! Always dope. \n\n+ your routine touch ups at your favorite place :)))) 👄
Please do a makeup tutorial on your Vegas make up look and your dark eye when you were on the plane the 2nd time!!
Can u do a tutorial on this look?? 😍❤️
I love it when you do hauls because it's on skin care!! Not so many gurus do this (or at least the ones I've seen), and it's so important to have a good bra and knickers for the face before makeup; so thank you. \n\nAlso, can we just talk about this GAWWWWWGEEEEEEUS eye makeup??!?!?!! GURL. YOU KILLING ME.
You makeup looks soooo good ! \nI definitely want to try those Sephora mask and the watermelon mask
you should look into The Body Shop skincare products! My brothers girlfriend works at one and she's been hooking me up with samples, and everything i've tried is to die for! I think you'd really love their face/hair masks, and the drops of youth oil/oils of life. I use the drops of use which have more of an aloe vera texture as a primer base, and the oils of laugh as your signature i'm crying! drops onto my face to help blend and add some extra glow to my face when putting on foundation. ☺️💕🌻
Please do a tutorial on this eye look!
I wish you could come to New Mexico and do my makeup for my husbands return from deployment! You are so incredibly stunning & talented!
Could we have a tutorial on your eye look?? I love the green and wud love to know WHICH shadows you used 😃❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish drunk elephant was just a smidge cheaper. I've heard such great things about their products!!
#bringsephoratoscotland I'm from Scotland I know how it feels ! 😂
Did sephora GIVE YOU a gift card to use for this purchase? case that makes all the difference.
What are you wearing on your lips, it's gorgeous! Also, love that eye look!
You should get Louise Pentland on your podcast! Xx
Matching colour again 😂
Vlogmas? :D
Welcome back! We've missed you ❤️ love your podcast btw! I'm expecting twin girls with 3 weeks left before my C-section, so it's really inspiring!!! ❤️
Shouldn't the title of this actually be Recently I've Been? 😁
We've missed you! But I'm excited to read the book 😁
Love to see you back Gi, glad you've had time to spend with your family. I listened to your podcast with Emma Willis and Izzy Judd, both were brilliant in different ways. I will be using the Jo Elvin, Frankie Bridges and the next one on Monday to do my long run to. Hopefully doing 8 miles on Monday. Have a great day Gi x
Just finished 'Billy and Me' and really like it and I have 2 questions:\n1) any chance it's gonna be published in Poland?\n2) is this fair to put boyfriend standards this high with Billy? Me as single now have to take normal boy?
I’ve got hypermobility and fibromyalgia!!! I do get where you’re coming from Gi ❤️
My husband and I just found out that we are expecting a baby in December. We had no idea that we were pregnant. But now that we know I've been reading  Happy Mum Happy Baby. And I have cried several times. Thank you for saying everything that needs to be said to future parents! Everyone has there own way of parenting and no one way is right and I'm so glad that I ordered it.
When (I assume Tom) walked past in the hallway at 6.26 I totally freaked out 😂
I have hyper mobility too
Would love to here Anna Saccone-Joly on your podcast another YouTube Mum xx
I LOVE the podcast! I listen to it while nursing ^^
I've recently been diagnosed with hyper mobility and hyperalgesia (hyper sensitivity to pain) and it was explained to me as a hyper flexibility or double jointedness in the bones and when the joints do overextend it puts stress in the nerves which is what causes the pain later on
Muscle pain is horrid i feel ya girl
Will there be a book signing for some kind of wonderful??!!!
we've been Trying to conceive now for 7 years it honestly felt like it was never going to happen i saw rubbish doctors that where really insensitive and i've just started with a new team in a different hospital i had my 2nd appointment yesterday the difference it makes having people that are good at what they do and compassionate is huge and at the moment i'm feeling much more positive about things i've just started listening to your pod cast with izzy but have to pause it and will continue it later when i have some more time to listen.
Hyper mobility is a killer! I have it mainly in my knees too x
Gi, you look absolutely beautiful! This lighting suits you!

I've got to say that I couldn't stop paying attention to Tom instead of you. Please don't be mad at me!
Not related to your vlog in anyway Gi but LOVE your tablecloth 😍

We all cry sometimes xxxx
The best part about Jon's music videos is he features aesthetic sky and beauty of nature instead of girls jumping around in bikini. Such a gorgeous song and video
Your my idol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.s you kinda look like an older version of my brother
You try to kill it, but it won't stop bleeding
It's funny because the day before I looked to see if he released anything new or when he last released it, and then I saw this one and lost my shit
*I've been looking at the sky since i was like 5 years old* yes.
Hey Eden, great song! You are one of my favourite artists, I hope I will see you live one day. The song just kick ass'es, I listen to that song to get into flowstate before I start to grind. Keep up that great work.  BR
this is such a beautiful film, the song is pretty good too xD
I need you singing in Brazil!
Ever since Eden Project this man is the goat
EDEN is like drugs to me
EDEN's visual effects are some of the best out there. His songs, videos and pictures inspire me all the time.
dont wanna be That person but please come to Brasil
At first, I didn't like this song that much. I really like EDEN and I was like... maybe it is just me. But every single time I listen to it, I like it a little more. It has come to the point I like it as much as Rock + Roll
I'm crying. Thank you for this gift Eden.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you
FUCK YES A NEW EDEN SONG!!!!! THERE IS A GOD! :D ily EDEN <3
EDEN keeps smashing through his own ceilings. Beautiful piece 👌🏻
By far the best music video ever
omfg you can't believe how much i love you and your music. you helped me through soooo much and oh my gosh. I can't even put it into words. favourite singer for a lifetime!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have never been this in love with a song before!!!!!!😭😭😭❤❤
Been playing for like an hour now. Don't know when the fuck I will stop.
Youtube should contain wayyyyyy more buttons than just 'like' or 'share' for such songs. \nLove you Eden!
I wanna draw EDEN and make this my background music.
why do i love him so much?
1:20 sounds like an old linkin park song to me but I dont remember the name. Help?
what kind of people dislike EDEN song. feel sorry for them
but dude this has got me really sad
Holy shit, the song and video fit so good together. It was worth to wait all this time for a new song. Continue with the great work Eden  😊
Such a good song Love you Eden ❤️
Of course I hope there is a heaven.\nThe thought is extremely comforting to my fears of losing those I love.\nBut there's no reason to believe in any of the manmade gods.\nI don't see why I should compromise my morality and intellectual integrity for fear.\nIt's life.  None of us get out of it alive.
such a beautiful work of art - this is truly a masterpiece
make more music dont ever stop keep going
A beautiful song made by a beautiful man
@EDEN when will u have more merchandise available?
First listen seems kinda bad to me, but not it sounds rly rly good ! But it's the first time his perfect lyrics don't talk to me yet :/
IM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU! \nPLEASE MARRY ME!\nYOU SAVED ALL THE LAST YEARS FOR ME AND NOW OMG!\nPLEASE BE MINE FOREVER, YOU ARE THE BEST!
the bes music x
IM SO LATE AND I CANT EVEN LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE I HAVE NO HEADSET AHHH FUCK MY LIFE
I absolutely love the song but I think this is a rare case where the video detracts from the music. The whole time I'm trying to figure out the importance of the footage but realize there really isn't any. Yes it's beautiful and sure it can be argued that it's a similar feeling of the song but it's just not capturing me as much as the music itself.
How can this even get any dislikes!?
Love this song its so beautiful
I want that EDEN becomes really famous because he deserves it.. But on the other side I want that EDEN is our little secret...
This song is beautiful i love it it’s my current favorite song😍 everytime i hear it my feels really begin to showing. Eden had always been my mood singer wherever i’m sad or happy Eden has always have the right song for each mood it’s a positive thing ofc each way i love his voice and his song show some love to him by liking this not tryna get attention from you guys but i do this bc i love his songs🖤🌑
I saw a new Eden song and I was like hell yeah then I saw an add come up and I punched my monitor
I was digging this so hard until around 1:20
where's ngals comment at?
These shot are amazing, also the song too
im not ready for this new era but this song gave me feels hello
Stuck between being broke and shocked at the fuckin' same time. EDEN is One of the 🐐.
A E S T H E T H I C C
The only person i would go gay for.
This song is just... idk how to describe it its just so goddamn beautiful
They say love was suppose to make you happy but I feel quite sad..
e a r g a s m
He makes the music the way he feels which is very relatable.....❤
the more i listen to it the more i love it.
Am I the only one who was like shit these some good screenshots just dying to be taken\n\nAlso its hard to explain the emotions I got out of this. Its like a peaceful silence.
I can't believe, you finally released a new song !!!! :D
Hey, I love you, and I know it isn't always easy. But you should upload more <3.
I feel like this would play in a slowmo tage at the end of a sad war movie.

You’re helping me move on. Your songs are helping me to not to take that awful step. Thank you.
He should do a studio version of amnesia.
In case anyone wants to sing along.\n\n\nYou try to kill it but it won't stop bleeding\nTry to forget it but it won't stop killing you\nYou're running out of time\nYeah, you know you can't go back\nIt's too late\nTo say it's too late\nYou can't take back that you said nothing\nHow could you do nothing?\n\nIs this burning right?\nAm I living bridges?\nCan we build our past right?\nLearning through future solecism\n\n(I've missed times)\nIt's played out (been disconnected)\nI've moved on (I stressed time)\nGet fucked up (forgetting timing)\nMy new draw  (and I need you to talk me down)\nAnd it's not right \nYou're dead wrong (cause I feel like I need to crash)\nWhat are we doing? \nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong\n\nCause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong\nBeen looking at the sky like someone was looking down\nBut it keeps raining on me\nAnd I've been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old\nBeen looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone\nAnd the fault's not ours alone\nBut I think it's time to go\n\nIt's played out\nI've moved on\nGet fucked up\nMy new draw\nAnd it's not right\nYou're dead wrong\nWhat are we doing?\nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong\n\nAnd I've got way too many questions just to try and get it right\nCause I can't be the one to shrug it off\nAnd I could be the reason that we stay up all night\nTo be someone, to be someone\nAnd oh, all we've got is to try to get it right\nBut no one told you\nThat this gon' hurt, oh no\nAnd now all I really want is to scream\nNow all I really want is to scream\nNow all I really want is to scream\nNow all I really want is to scream\n\nThat shit just to try and find a way to get my head down\nAnd head out or maybe just the two of us and head now\nI'm just tryna find the real now\nDream clouds, ghost ground\nReal friends, dead hometown\n\nCause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong\nBeen looking at the sky like someone was looking down\nBut it keeps raining on me\nAnd I've been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old\nBeen looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone\nAnd it breaks my heart, you know\nBut I think it's time to go\n\nIt's played out\nI've moved on\nGet fucked up\nMy new draw\nAnd it's not right\nYou're dead wrong\nWhat are we doing?\nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong
I wish Eden would sell his old merch from June again. Even for 200 $ I would buy one of these hoodies.

[LYRICS]\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou try to kill it but it won't stop bleeding\nTry to forget it but it won't stop killing you\nYou're running out of time\nYeah, you know you can't go back\nIt's too late\nTo say it's too late\nYou can't take back that you said nothing\nHow could you do nothing?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs this burning right?\nAm I living bridges?\nCan we build our past right?\nLearning through future solecism\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIt's played out (I've missed times)\nI've moved on (been disconnected)\nGet fucked up (I stressed time)\nMy new draw (forgetting timing)\nAnd it's not right (and I need you to talk me down)\nYou're dead wrong\nWhat are we doing? ('cause I feel like I need to crash)\nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong\n\n'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong\nBeen looking at the sky like someone was looking down\nBut it keeps raining on me\nAnd I've been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old\nBeen looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone\nAnd the fault's not ours alone\nBut I think it's time to go\n\n[Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]\nIt's played out\nI've moved on\nGet fucked up\nMy new draw\nAnd it's not right\nYou're dead wrong\nWhat are we doing?\nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I've got way too many questions just to try and get it right\n'Cause I can't be the one to shrug it off\nAnd I could be the reason that we stay up all night\nTo be someone, to be someone\nAnd oh, all we've got is to try to get it right\nBut no one told you\nThat this gon' hurt, oh no\nAnd now all I really want is to scream\nNow all I really want is to scream\nNow all I really want is to scream\nNow all I really want is to scream\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat shit just to try and find a way to get my head down\nAnd head out or maybe just the two of us and head now\nI'm just tryna find the real now\nDream clouds, ghost ground\nReal friends, dead hometown\n\n[Bridge]\n'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong\nBeen looking at the sky like someone was looking down\nBut it keeps raining on me\nAnd I've been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old\nBeen looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone\nAnd it breaks my heart, you know\nBut I think it's time to go\n\n[Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]\nIt's played out\nI've moved on\nGet fucked up\nMy new draw\nAnd it's not right\nYou're dead wrong\nWhat are we doing?\nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong
*Such an incredible and underrated Artist*

dont be a bad mainstream shit ! fans loves you !
Does anyone know where I can find his You don't love me yet sweater??
You guys should've watched somebody black instead of the other random tutorials. And the lace is going to be visible to a certain extent. You just do as much as you can to disguise it
The wiggs dont fail ! \nYou fail!! 😅
Is it me or it took about the whole 1 minute to realize they were two different people in the thumbnail
Chloe doesn't sound like an Aussie anymore 😂 Pia's accent is much stronger
chloe you are sooooooo pretty
Dumb white girls
they struggling
Please do another one PLZZZ
Want a wig now lol 😂💞
https://youtu.be/dNR6Aj9O_ks
Chloe with long hair reminds me of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan 😻
Hahahaha so funny. Best video Chloe!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You 2 obviously are clueless
Pia looks exactly like Angelina Jolie
12:46 😂. Oh nuh nah nah, yr fucked 😂😂😂😂 subscribed!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂
aw nah nah nah, you're fucked HAD ME DYING HAHAHAHA <3 this collab
Trypophobia from that lace
Lol hilarious!!!
My two favorite YouTubers 😍
Chloe looks so much like Blair Waldorf 😩
Wow!. Check this out: http://amzn.to/2xM32Qp
Tip! If you plan on wearing the wig with the cap try picking up a dark coloured wig cap so it doesn't show through the wig! Light coloured caps work better with light coloured wigs so it doesn't look like weird patches :) also netted caps are a lot more comfy than stocking caps!
You are so funny
Holy shit, you spent $3000 on wigs she will never wear. Crazy!
you also have to put make underneath the lace in order to make it more like scalp jajaja its also called bleaching the knots or hiding the knotsss
From far away and on their Instagram account they made it look so easy and so pretty and natural af but in real life you can see everything
How you cut and apply a wig depends on what you’re wearing it for. For everyday kind of use, you just trim back the lace as close to the baby hairs as you can. You secure the wig down by having a wig cap on, and using bobby pins to secure it in place. Under the wig cap you can do multiple things. You can do a wrap, you can do pin curls, you can do anything that holds the hair flat and gives your natural hair some shape or texture for the pins you put through the wig to grip on to. For stage, you’d leave the lace long (with repeated use the lace gets shitty and you have to trim it back. Eventually you run out of lace and you have to get it replaced) and use adhesive to stick the lace down around the face. Never put adhesive in the hair because that just ruins it. Sometimes the wigs natural hairline doesn’t match your own so you just kind of have to fiddle with it and find a way to disguise any lace that stands out. You can use makeup to cover it too
ladies if you buy a wig that expensive you need to get one with bleached knots so you cant tell its lace.
You can sew the lace under so you don't have to cut it :)
Lol.. I bought a $1700 wig from freedom couture and didn't even get a wig cap with it. Beauty bloggers getting more treatment? Hm yeah
I ordered one and it didn't fit on my head!! It was so small and they told me it was a large! The company are really vague with details.
If you don't want that wig , I'll take it
Also there are usually clips on the inside to help keep the side down.. but look up  got 2 be glued method
I specialize in making and showing how to lay wigs down to look natural. You shouldn’t have to pull any of your natural hair out while wearing Freedom wigs. And also make sure there is a elastic band sewn in so it for snug to the head. Lastly do two braids to the back of your head and pin them. And if you use stocking cap pull it back away from hairline so you don’t see it in the front. Hope this helps ladies. Also here is my video 😉 https://youtu.be/8BzfjSc1RNs
I’m surprised no blow torch was brought out 😂
Am I the only one that thinks that at some angels Pia looks like Jennifer Lawrence?
Chloe, If u hate them, I have alopecia and can only leave my house with a wig on. I will gladly take them off your hands 😬🙏🏻
I think the girl with brown hair could bear me a fine son.
hey everyone! I just wrote a simple blog post on how to eat organically to lose weight and stay healthy. Please support <3 \nhttps://thehealthynewyorker.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/delicious-organic-healthy-breakfast-ideas/
You guys are both beautiful!!!!
You guys need to join Wig Skaters group on Facebook. $1500 is way to much for a wig
You get your foundation then flip the wigs and place it on the lace. Braid you real hair to lay flat then use gots to be glued to keep the wig Down or you can sew the wig on
I'm a black woman and those wigs looks so natural but 1500 dollars might as well should of tried clip in extensions would of saved some money!!!
Pia has had so much shit done to her face it doesn't move
i subscribed, you if you like you can subscribe me back ❤
This video is Everything! Shows me that I'm not the only one who struggles with wigs and that you Will be able to see the lace.
When I first saw the thumbnail I thought they were the same person
Pia is the best I love her sooo much ❤️💜💕✨ this was sooo funny !!!!
LOL.  You guys did that all wrong in front.   😂😂😂
Chloe looks like Belle from Beauty and the Beast with that long haired wig!! Loll
That's because you aren't....nevermind. Y'all tried it, good job.
They don't need wigs though, laughed when the other girl said where is it??? while looking for the strap
Now you know how us people who have no idea about makeup feel !!! lol
Next time watch a black beauty guru..
You're both so funny and sweet. Loved this! 😊❤❤
Pia's a babe, kinda looks like Victoria Beckham 2.0...
that was entertaining.   and informative.   didn't know it was so hard to get a wig on!
I was literally cringing when Chloe' was cutting w the scissors! ❤️🇺🇸
PLEASE do a makeup tutorial of this look 😍😍
Can we just looook at Pia’s biceps!!!!! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
You need dark wig caps and lace wig glue to stick down the edges xxx
Great video! And why is it you still looking stunning even with the stocking cap on by itself?! I would look like a huge freaky egghead 😳😩
This is too funny
So fun to watch
You need to go to a black salon. They will show you how to do it.
Loved this vid! Next time try using spirit gum as it will not only glue the wig to you but if you put it on the lace, put tights on your finger and dab firmly onto the lace it will also diminish the appearance of lace and will blend into the skin! (Reason for the tights is that the glue wont stick to your finger and it doesn’t stick to tights very well) hope this helps!
Both wigs are bomb. You ladies just needed a little help applying them. I absolutely adore the short one 😍. You can tell its amazing
Thier can't possibly be 2 million people interested in this moolah\nstuff.Must be the chicks attracting \nattention.The wig show.
I think you should have made the front lace a little longer then stick down with spirit gum then apply foundation over the top.
My two faves TOGETHER! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do a makeup tutorial together!
try to go on the lace with an eyeshadow xx
Soooo amazing to see the transformation funny to see u with long hair hahs
Hey, put a 1 shade lighter concealer in the wig scalp!
Sorry if it's a mess at work 😝
LIKE BEFORE WATCH CLUB 😂❤️
Two of my faves 🙌
pia's makeup😍😍😍😍😍
Watch the Jackie Aina tutorial!
Yeaak
2 beautiful ladies ❤️❤️
Hi Chloe, if you end up not using one or both of the wigs, please consider donating them to a cancer charity
Can you tell us about your HAIRCUT FROM HELL please?!!
the blond chick, pardon the orange chick's nose is cut way to short and tucked on side way to obvious - makes my eyes feel uncomfortable
Pia looks like the sweetest girl 😍
بحبك كتير وبعشق فديوهاتك im from syria
Yes you need to glue down the side... A lot of serious wig wearers do this so they don't get there wig snatched
I'm a guy and even i found this funny to watch.
Pia looks like Nina dobrev at certain angles with that wig on!!!
As a straight male I watched this to learn for my girlfriend. That is all.
Those wigs are amazing, you guys just don't know how to put them on but it was really funny 😂😂 do more vids together! Maybe watch some black YouTubers, they know the best wig techniques
This was such a funny and fresh video! Thank you Chloe, nice meeting you Pia! By the way you look Really good with that dark colored wig. I suggest you also check Jackie Aina's video on how to install the wigs. Blessings from Mexico 🇲🇽
I totally understand your frustration!! esp with the sides!!! i have a wig that i never use because the lace on the sides is always showing.....and i can never manage to conceal the lace in front either? :(
Stick with the Jon Renau, and Raquel Welch wigs. The lace front in these wigs are very realistic, no cutting lace as it's already cut.\nGet hand tied as they're much better quality.
What a ugly girl
Chloe quick tip get some wig glue and glue the edges down, then you can use concealer (personal preference is face powder) along the part to hide the lace. Also you can trim them side bits to your liking ( be careful and take your time ) then glue them down 😘💖
this is gentrification
I'll be ready in two minutes I literally died 😂😂😂
I watched a couple of front lace wig videos and some of the ones I watched the people cut the lace off before they put on the wig and I think that would be much easier and you could get some of the side bit of mesh/lace.
Hahaha loved this! Some people do glue it down :) and makeup would help but cut it where you can still see it! Xx
The studio version is brilliant but wow, this LIVE version is PHENOMENAL. Kelly is such an amazing vocalist. Her new album already deserves a big publicity, popularity and tons of Grammys
I have no words to describe the awesomeness of this performance. Kelly is the epitome of a TRUE artist. Not too many artists out there today who are as diversified or talented as Kelly is>>>
Kelly you look and sound beautiful as always! I forever fan since the beginning I will always cherish you! XO
Absolutely amazing. Can’t wait to hear the album.

Every time I see/hear her sing live, it always takes my breath away and gives me chills. She's hands down my favorite female artist. Ain't no denying that voice!
There are always people who dislike an awesome video like this. I really wonder sometimes what do they actually like! Sometimes I want to find them and ask them why they really hit that dislike button.
SING SING SING KELLY! Shes so talented it is unbelievable!!!

She deserves so much more than she gets, Kelly is a beautiful soul that shows us what a true artist looks, sounds, and acts like. This is music!
She's pure gold.
this song makes me cry
Mmmm, the way u move me...
This is music.  This is artistry.  Absolutely superior.
11 really silly/stupid people out there. I mean, I respect different tastes in music, but disliking this song??? WTF?
Clicked *like* before i can even hear a second of the song. Duh.
Which imagery did you guys connect with the most? For me, the thrill of christmas morning.  I distinctly remember that childhood experience of waking up a little chilly and running downstairs while hearing x-mas music and seeing a glowing x-mas tree..plus the gifts of course.  As a child, it last a lifetime.
I couldn't love this more!!
The beauty in the the whole aspect of this song
Even with 50 CENT in tha house playing the drums, Kelly sounds amazing!
EPIC... Just Amazing. Without autotune, Live and Just better than the record...
Such restraoned power in her voice.
Wow. What a performance. :'-)
Incredible...I have no other words.
The real deal ! Kelly is amazing
Please, come back to Brazil! \n\nO Brasil te ama 👏😍
Stunning.  I'm so buying this album

Incredible, never sounded better
8 people gave this a thumbs down.  Really?  8 people?  Did these people confuse thumbs down for being freaking awesome?  This performance is amazing.  Definitely in the top 10 of her performances.  The production of this is just phenomenal.  How she doesn't win all of the Grammy's is beyond me.
just wondering; why she is not using her vevo account anymore?
Girl........are you a white walker? coz I want you to have my babies...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will leave now.
No no no no no we're going to have to see people my life 😂
Could you do a video where you recommend cheap/ish items for beginners, or a Halloween’s basics with face paint recommendations etc?? And your advice on using these??
I would love to see you do a tutorial of Sally from Nightmare Before Christmas!!
I love this!\n\nBut where is Chase?! 😒
This is amazing!!! Could you maybe do some fairytale themed glam and gore? Love love your videos
That intro is life
Is there ever going to be a cool giveaway on SFX makeup for Halloween? I have so many ideas and know what I want but I don't have much access to all the supplies to do so or I don't have enough money because most of it costs a lot for me. Just a suggestion but if not then I understand  :)
Hands up of you're the 0.01% of the worlds population who doesn't watch GoT
Do a creepy Thing 1 and Thing 2!
Mykie can you help meee (off topic from the video but..) \n\nI just got liquid latex and it's not liquid whatsoever, it's basically a rubber and idk what to do, I put it in hot water to see if it'd break down but nothing happened.. (I can't return it either)
You need to do freak show makeup cuz it's awesome
Can you do beetlejuice ? :3
DARTH MAUL GLAM LOOK PLS!!!!!
Missed these videos 💕😓
HAVE YOU DONE A COLAB WITH SIMPLY NAILOGICAL!!!
Can you pleeeease do «The mad hatter» look? I love your chanel❤️
I love mykie, but dear god Game of thrones' story has gone to shit
a mouth of suaron would be great to see at one point.
This IS unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Only you girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
Do you keep all the faces you've created? Or just toss em out?
Can you please do a minnie mouse glam and gore like if you agree
HELLO! Here's my face I almost lost it 😂
So happy you're uploading more videos these days! Thank you/<3
Did mykie and chase break up?
You should check out the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett! Also it would be so awesome if you could do your own version of how the characters would look :-D
The Halloween intro/logo gives me life😝😂🎃
yOU SHOULD DO A HANAHAKI DISEASE SFX MAKE UP TUTORIAL ITS SOO COOL!!\n\nif you dont know what the hanahaki disease is its basically a fictional disease in a one-sided relationship where the infected starts coughing and vomiting flower petals:D
Hey mykie wat color is ur blue hair dye like wat shade blue and name of the color
Watching you try to eat was priceless!
I know you LOVE Melanie Martinez so how about you do a video showing how to do the sfx in her “Mad Hatter” music video (where she peels her face off to be exact😉😱)
Audible was how I read the entire GOT series. Over halfway through my second listen through now. Do one of the children of the forest!
i love you so much
YAS that them song fucks me up
THIS would make George R.R. Martin so proud of you !
I can't even watch GOT but I love this  😂
I would love to see you on 'Face off' !!!
i officially love you!
DO CAROLINE WITH BUTTON EYES😩😩😩😩😩😩
why would ANYONE thumb down her videos....😫
OMGGGGGG, I LOVE GAME OF THRONES, I definitely bend the knee to this makeup! Slaaaaay
Because of your hair you look like Evan Peters character in season 7 of American horror story
I want to see mykie's cotton ball collection I feel like you got a full room of just cotton balls.
It's hard to believe that someone so beautiful turned themself into THAT
Will you do a Cheshire cat tutorial and make the smile out of cotton and latex?
Same lol forced myself to watch the first 3 seasons and then it just gets SO good SO fast
Haha. Before the tutorial started I watched an ad for Game of Thrones. :-D
Mykie I really want to be a velociraptor for Halloween... can you help?
I want to be khaleesi for Halloween but I don't know where to get a dress bc in eBay sometimes they're not good quality
I literally JUST started GOT. It's pretty good so far! I've read a couple of the books at least. This is awesome!!! Also, would love to hear your book recommendations...would you consider sharing them at least on twitter if not in a video? <3
they had me shook when they shot the dragon then revived it , i was done.
Mykie this might be to much to ask but for everyone's sake who can't afford the fancy Halloween makeup is there anyway you can show us how to do cool makeup looks with the Walmart/dollar store grease makeup kits without latex unless it was in it?
Soooooooooooo I'm not trying to start drama, but are Mykie and Chase still together....? We haven't seen him in a while...
Could u do a creepy coraline look? Maybe the other mother or an alternate coraline where she agrees to sewing the buttons in her eyes. P.s this look is so detailed and amazing YOU SO COOOLLL
Since Stranger Things season 2 is coming out on Halloween, you should do a tutorial for the demogorgon... I don't know if that's possible, but it would be SO awesome.
love it, and game of thrones !!
Oh, how I've missed the intro with the pumpkin🎃🎃
I got really hyped for this especially because of a vld ad popped up before this
Oh Mykie... you are such a nerd 💚
After a long day in the hairsalon to get an internship I'm living for this music
Can you do Nearly-Headless Nick?
i'm going to be dany
I have never seen Game of Thrones. But, I am thinking of watching it.
Сурова, как первомайский утренник
lol i love the idea of you walking out in public in your 'Gore' looks! It looks so good!!

Lesbian feminist in the making.
Talk about a perfect accidental commentary on modern day society.

Don't feed her too many candies.
Sexist bitch
Cuteness overload! God bless you all!
get rid of the little cunt, i mean the alive one BTW
I thought this was very cute until I realized that his is her typical behavior she has adapted to, in order to earn blue sweeties. =(
Fuck, people dumb enough to still film vertically squeezing more out.
so funny when grownup neo-feminists act like exactly the same way sometimes
I agree with this little girl 100%.   It is a completely valid opinion.
So sweet! saw her on the Wendy Williams Show!Adorableness
making the sex of an unborn crucial\nvertical video\nboy's and girl's color\nbribing with sweets
my little too when she he a him.
Fake tears, the parents have taught her to be this way through poor reinforcement. She cries, then gets rewarded with candy. Unsurprisingly, her tears end immediately.
He\n He\n  He\nShe's funny.
Siobhan, turn off the comments. They're saying awful things about your children. Just turn them off!
I know this is British, but can any of you Brits tell me what area this accent is attributed to?
Start saving and you can pay for his surgery, little girl.
This wouldn't happen in China. It would be more like Good news! We're having a boy so we don't have to infanticide your new sibling like we almost did with you.
you know what this video really means. the boys are her school are not very nice to her
That boy is going to be tortured for at least the first 10 years of his life.
I had a british older sister, she was mean and didn't want me either lmao
It boggles my mind why parents like this are so eager to share their shitty parenting with the rest of the world.
I wouldn't leave her alone in the room with the new baby, just sayin
Hi Siobhan I work for @DailyBlasLive! We would love to use this adorable video please email me at alexie.pincus@dailyblastlive.com
What a brat. You can tell the kid uses crying to get what she wants. And these parents videotape as if it's amusing. Just wait 10 years.
Hopefully her brother realizes he is a she and gets HRT therapy before she can walk.
Good luck with all that, little guy.
Guuuuul
What a cutie :)
Sexist toddler! haha xD
Your kid is dumb
Circi Lannister's first home movie
feminism in a nutshell
Damn feminist brat
Bitch
Feminism already corrupting the youth smh tbh fam
Rescue a dog.  Problem solved.
new phone who dis?
Poor baby hahaha.
Giiiiiiiirrrrrrrrllll
Thanks for reminding me why I don't have kids.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
She needs to step away from the Pop Tarts from time to time, methinks.
Tell her the baby boy is trans and can dress her up like a girl.
Brat
I came for the comments and I am not disappointed.
My parents did the same thing when my sister was going to be born. I still wish she was a boy...
I'd grab that little fucker and shake her violently. Then sell her to my friend Jeremy Epstein. John Posestda will pay top dollar too
*Did you just assume that baby's gender what the fuck you are literally hitler I am calling CPS right now prepare to have your life ruined and your family torn apart!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
Cheer up, little one! These days, newborns get to choose their gender! So, they just might end up being a girl after all!\nHopefully your tax funded public school administration will get the gender situation sorted out early on by Pre-K! Good luck!
Beggars can’t be choosers
just cut off his penis
If you think she's being mean, let me tell you that I stepped on my brother's throat after he was born because I wanted to be an only child. (He's fine, i didn't press my foot too hard. My parents saw and stopped me). I also tried to strangle him on several occasions and there's even a picture of it
dumb cunt dont sideways film u dumb whore and beat ur ugly ass kid. dont ever let them talk back like its nothing dumb whore
fucking annoying little kid
www.reddit.com sent me here and oh my god im glad i dont have a fuckin annoying girl like that as my kid the parents are obviously pussy liberals for letting this happen my sister would have never acted like that because my parents believed in spanking not being a pussy parent who gives trophys for everything
THAT LITTLE GIRL IS JUST LIKE THE REDDIT COMMUNITY, CRYING OVER SOME STUPID SHIT, AND UPSET THAT THEY CANT GET THEIR WAY. POOR BABIES
I really felt her pain; that was so sad :(  Saddest thing ever.  never watching this type of stuff again its horrible.
You gotta show this on her wedding day..
Hi, I'm Ivana from Rumble.com. We are interested at featuring your amazing video on our site. Please email me at ivana@rumble.com for more info. Thanks!
Ray J: Epitome of a lame nigga
Ray j is consisntanly full of shit
Ray j got that pipe 20k a month.
And he over 25 he a old head -Uzi
They wanted ray j to go up there & embarrass himself but he flipped the script on em
Did this nigga just really just made lean in interview
i have to think..im telling you his tone of voice just makes the shit sound correct
 A bunch of checks for the fuckery.  Ray J  much love and respect.....
I would def let him screw me in all 3 holes on camera
For a man to play it so cool and they say he wilds out is too much for me. Im sure theyll change the title of this video soon but oh boy is this fake news title of the year. Much respect to Ray J keeping it cool and not going haywire on these crazy nutty show hosts. The fact that they were trying to push his buttons is the fact that they sensationalized the headline when they couldnt get him to go haywire. Wow. Ray J is dope for keeping his head. Pause.
I like but, not them bars
&he's trying to make a baby...
and did he jus confirm Chris is on drugs
He keeps saying sorry cause he was tweaking yet he's drinking lean now lol
LMAO Ray J is ALWAYS being made fun of without knowing it smh. His level of intuition is ZERO. Joe said well if Ray J said it, it must be right. You can tell deep down Joe sees him as a clown. The same way Charlemagne did. The same way we all do. But from Ray J to Cardi B ignorance is accepted and rewarded in today's world
Ray J hit it first kanye
This nigga retarded but smart and Joe need to stop sucking the guests off, fucking lame
Ray J's stuck in 2011 with 3 cups sipping nothing.
Ray J is very delusional very
Has anybody noticed that this fake ass tech mogul, fake ass rapper,fake ass celebrity is faking drinking lean.
I TOLD YOU 5 seconds later... yeah im humble.
He playin crazy about that R.kelly stuff fr
Lil Yatchy: I don't hate nothing, I'm making money living life.\n\nJoe: WHAT THE FUCK!? HOW ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY!!!!?? \n\nRay J: I don't hate nothing, I'm making money living life.\n\nJoe: That's what's up man good for you.
i been to silicone valley.  i seen, like ......i seen it
Why he got the white cups with the blurred out sprite bottle tho!!!???     LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!
The reason we have the Kardashians and The Breakfast Club.. If only he could cash the royalties
This nigga better not drop no fucking album named Raydemption.
Joe, you don't understand California, there are helicopters everywhere. At least in the cities - Oakland and LA. Very different than the east coast.
Damn it's fucked up how they were reaching for dirt the whole interview SMH
The reason why I like the breakfast club is cause they ask the question people want to ask . This guys just go searching for a story even if they aren’t interested
Ray J matured. Complex wit the clickbait. This my first dislike
Ray J and Kanye have to be related!
The sprite bottle is probably blurred out because they don’t wanna give sprite free promotion.. that’s why sometimes rappers shirts or certain labels will be blurred out in their video
Is Ray J a football fan? https://goo.gl/N6ruJc
I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY COMPARE THIS DRY ASS LAME SHOW TO THE BREAKFAST CLUB ! ??? LMAO 😂😂😂
I'm humble. - Ray J\n\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bye Bitches! LOL ladies this is what a professional liar sounds like
Which Ray J interview are they talking bout that was so great ??
Craplex done it again dry ass joe budden,weakest interviewer and ak carries them the most
Rayj and Budden should be gay for each other
what's in his cup? lol
everyone using nadeskas lap to rest on
This nigga Ray J has lived a great life deadass. This nigga thotted Out the most famous women in the world grew up on TV as the little brother to a Grammy award winning sister and had one of the most remembered VH1 reality shows of all time he going down as a goat easily
Fake ass title to get viewers smh. Everyday struggle only got 4 more months then it's a wrap
If i had one wish\n*Joe budden premier skin for injustice 2 😂😂😂😂*
Wilding out and being high af is two different Shits
I def didnt see him wild out! I love his growth Great interview. And the album being called Raydemption I would like to hear some r &b like One Wish & another song  w Lil Kim
Did they say he was wildin just cuz he had the lean cup at earlyoclock in the morning or something. Ak ain't neva have to click bait niggas. Complex weak
Ray j just Seems Like the type of Guy who just talks ..
Guess Kanye won't be stepping foot into Complex anytime soon.
Everything that comes out his mouth sounds like a lie lol
How is the  nigga getting interviews,when was the last time  he was in the radio?..2001?
Complex, Click Bait titles that aren't truthful diminishes your integrity.
Why do these overrated artist with one or two hits think they're so relevant and impact is so strong. U acted like a fool your whole career ray j.
If you like being introduced to new artist and new music as well as interacting subscribe to our channel
11:10 the realest shit I've ever heard someone say... like Vince Staples said, Ray J can never take an L
From what I see weed and/or lean just make you calm & jus bring up all ya honesty.
Ray J is always so funny 😂 he's a cool cat lol.
niggaz be so pressed to show they sipping lean these guys goofy
Damn... im feelin this new ray j
He spitting straight facts! Take yourself to the next phase in life and don't take money for fuck shit.
Wow, they're sucking him the fuck off, lame episode
This nigga is such a complete fuck boy...he is a  tech guy  now visiting  silicone valley. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Like a smaller Mike rashid
Damn this nigga rich asl. Who else you see with 3 cups smh
8:35 iss.. iss.. isszz cowwect- Inspirational quotes by Ray j

CLICKBAIT
Click bait turn away now looool
https://youtu.be/PvzlWE9tZIY
Love Ray J

nigga glasses cleaner than wales
I told Ya! I'm Humble lol
Kanye West - 11:45
niggas be so hype to touch nadeska's legs, thinking they slick lmao
Im faithful, a thousand quadrupal percent
Why Ray pretending he drink lean
Everyday Struggle>The Breakfastclub<Drink Champs
I swear Joe Buddens always kissin these VH1 guys asses
Wack title
3 cups is unnecessary my nigga, wasting cups n shit
Coplex doing the Vladtv title shit fck
Clickbait.
why he pourin sprite in a tripple cup?\n\nbro is wylin
He sippin mud?
this nigga on drugs
Dj fatkademiks
Joe is a feen
Fuck Outta here Joe. U tryna do him dirty like taxstone did u; wit ur condescending ass asking stupid ass Questions
Lmao they blurred out the mud 😭
This Guy...
joe budden signature wrestling move hand slap, then says...HAAAAAAAAAY!
Much Dank
She's a bit too small for the chair since she can't sit yet... maybe wait a bit :)
Yeah they grow fast. I have twin nephews (first time aunt) who were born this year and are 8 months old about to turn 9. When tried food for the first time is was cute.
can all of the online doctors shut the fuck up ? it's their child they know what to do. they wouldn't do anything to hurt their baby.
I'm glad you uploaded this. Im a first time mum and my baby is about 2 weeks older than yours. I'm weaning him at the moment. And he makes those faces when I give his food. I thought I was doing something wrong lol x
Oh my god when me and my siblings were little we had those exact trip traps but one in red and one in a lighter wood I even remember giving up my one so my brother could have it ☺️🚼
Look forward to a future where Alessia feeds her carrots to the dogs on the down low.
Augh!  Soooooo CUTE!
Awww Alessia is growing up!😍
16:39 ahahah😅😅😅
How much fuel does your car drink, you put a full tank in testerday
Hi, All:   I'm new to your channel since May of this year.  I find your family enchanting and charming and your parenting skills progressive and loving.  However, and I don't want to write that word,  I am at the computer right now because I couldn't sleep for my concern about sweet Alessia having to sit up before she has the muscle power and motor skills to do so. and her evident distaste for carrots being expressed but not honored.  She's cluing you in in her own little way...please listen to her.   That's all.  Hope you have a beautiful day.
Sometimes when they first go in a high chair they lean from side to side ..Take a pillow or a bulky towel and put it on the side of the high chair she leans and prop her left arm on it and after a while she will get used to having it on the high chair instead of her side I had the same probables  with my son ...He first time was also carrots.. I remember the first time he spit them out all over me...But after a ew times he liked them...He hated peas.. you better wear something that you don't really like to wear that much..I love her she is a little Doll Baby ..my daughter was that tiny and we used to call her Sweet Pea.from the flint stones...I love your whole family they make me laugh.....😍😍😍😍
She's such a happy baby Anna! you guys are doing a wonderful job
I have no idea who u lot are
Best way to get downstairs EVER! The Daddy Express!!!
Alessia's so cute! When she was eating, she was playing the piano with her right hand. So sweet.
Who makes a poster of himself? Only f*cked in the head would Jesus Christ
all they worry is there nasty asses and money there vlogs are so shitty I would not by shit from them low lifes
its so refreshing seeing a mother actually feeding her child and with appropriate baby food. not putting chunks of avocado in front of her and expect her to eat it .
I ordered the calendar can’t wait until I get it except I’m not allowed have it until Christmas 😭so excited looks amazing xxxxx
I love ya'll! You make my heart happy! Such a blessing
That last bit got me all emosh!
I thought they would've started earlier on the baby food. She starting to look chubby.  👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
HOW IS ALESSIA EATING PROPER FOOD. I CAN'T. I remember when she was born and waiting to see pics and it felt like ages an now she's nearly 6 months!!! omg emotional. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My how times have changed! When my children were babies, the first food introduced to them was  rice cereal mixed very watery with their formula so they could just sort of slurp it down ! Mind you my first child is now 47 years old so that was many many years ago and so many things have changed!
Got it last year and advent but as much as I adore this family funds don’t allow to get this year and poster plus packaging take to nearly 20 so I will just keep the Callander I have as a momento
My niece has that pink Disney Minnie Mouse, she wore it for her 1st birthday ❤❤
Holy crap, I teared up at the end.
Guys, episode guide website doesn't work(
I have never bought a calendar before because I was waiting for the one where Alessia makes her calendar debut and yesterday I bought it 👍👏
Amazing guys! I cant believe she is 6 months already!!!! Ive always wanted to buy a calendar but my mum would think its weird i have a family calendar in my room im only 18 😂💗
Jofee? Stop using that song it makes me cry every friggin time
Hi Anna, what is that book you are using?? I am just curious as my 19 week old has just started weaning (been told she is fine to by her health visitor) and has just started on porridge at breakfast time. As i am a first time mum i don't really know much about weaning or where to start and how to keep introducing new foods any tips would be very appreciated. :) Hope you are well. Love to you all <3<3<3<3<3
The ending made me cry 💕 so beautiful
I wouldn’t listen to bestie in front of the kids the word are quite yano😂x
Kids do grow up so fast! My son just turned one. Looking through his pictures makes me emotional and happy at the same time.
What is alessia thinking when she's humming and waving in the high chair? Because she's not crying but she's not smiling. Not judging or anything I'm just genuinely interested to know if there are any baby experts!
omg!! i want the calendar😍😍
I have the 2016&2017 calendars but I don’t use calendars any more :(
@20:46 she looks like your dad Anna.........
does anyone know the song that starts at 0:43 ?
Hey, what is the song that was in the video?
Ordered the calendar yesterday.  My third one!    💗
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  a pearl necklace 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he gave Anna a hug and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling at the camera :):) :):) \n\nAlessia is getting big now Aww that was so cute seeing alessia trying food for the first time x
I live in China and how to get the calendar?
Everyone is saying isn't it weird yo have a calendar from an other family. Well I'm sure you have a calendar from idk Shawn Mendes but that's not weird????? Hypocrits.
This is so special! \nVery cute. 💋\nGreetz from Holland
It's insane to me how even though you're only seeing literally less than 5% of someone's day, there are actually people out there who don't comprehend that what you see isn't the whole picture. And these people seem to always be know-it-all's in the comments telling the SacconeJoly's how they are living their lives all wrong because of course, the know-it-all's obviously know everything as well as the amount of people who literally CHOOSE to watch these vlogs, yet consistently make the most asinine and terribly rude comments with the sole goal of tearing this family down. It's honestly so pathetic how people can act so outrageously if they're behind a keyboard where they're 'safe,' yet wouldn't dare to speak the way they do out loud in the 'real world.' \n\nJesus Christ people, let the SacconeJoly's freaking breathe. Let them live rather than criticizing every chance you get. How you treat others says a LOT about your character and who you truly are as a person. Do you feel fulfilled as a human being by always trying to bring someone else down? Ask yourself that and be honest. \n\nAnna and Jonathan, keep on keeping on. Turn a blind eye to those who don't bring anything good to you. Thanks for being my daily getaway from my personal troubles and stress and always bringing me 20 minutes of happiness when I need it most. You have made my life a bit better than it was before I first found you on YouTube. I am forever thankful for that. Keep making your dreams come true! \nGodspeed. ✌🏼❤️
Alessia's little hands are so cute 😂😂😍😍
JONATHAN!  I hope you see this before I go and buy another calendar that I can't write on.  Is this years one different paper than last year?  Can we write on this one with any pen or is it the same one from last year that I can't write on without using a permanent marker?!  Is 2018 pen friendly??
Dear stupid kids \nstop with the same shit like oh i wont not buy a random family calender is just so anoying ok im chill with it but they act like victims and say no body is saying nothing 😳 im chill still but THEY GOT ME THERE LIKE THEY KEEP SAYING SHIT that is out of the conversation like if they wanna fight and do drama do it in another place were no body wants them
Baby looks so uncomfortable and shaken.... I feel so bad for her.  Isn't she too small to be eating food like that?  I haven't even seen her grab toys first.  I feel like she was 2 months yesterday and still looks the same.  How has this much time passed?   It doesn't seem like it.  She is soooo petite tiny!!
She's so little, she doesn't look 6months 😍
My neice is 6months and i saw her eat solids 4 the first time it was so cute and she kept smiling and trying to laugh xx i love her so much
Vomit material. This is the modern world. The abyss is staring at it, staring, and no-ones looking back.
Her face every time you put the spoon in her mouth 😂 bless her
You make my day I was going to see the NHS doctor today changed my mined I just wanted to match you guys love you xxx 😘
It’s not time to chill lol
I’m 27 and I  make the same faces as Alessia when someone forced veggies on me.
Awww her what are you even feeding me face is so funny. Bless her. She's adorable. Hope the next taste/texture of food goes down better with her x
What a beautiful video!!!
You should make a little video of the three of them trying food for the first time! That ending was too sweet by the way!
We're gonna be here for all of Alessia's first and I can't handle the excitment.
I want to be woken like Eduardo 😜
do you guys ship to india ? the calendar ?
No Advent calendar this year? 😔
My mum has ordered the calendar and the poster and I am soook excited ❤️💖💗
I'm crying with joy 💕💕💕💕
Aww, you always make me smile. Another beautiful baby we all get to enjoy. Love you all. 💜💓💙💛
Aww now I have tears because of that lovely montage! An emotional video for you and me, Jonathan!
It was even cooler if u guys did a theme for the calendar for next year
Do they still have their workouts?
that montage at the end!!
Am I crazy to still think about alessias Burberry jacket she has..is.she big enough yet?? I would love to see it again
6 months already?! WOW!! It felt as if she was born yesterday
Children are the gift of god.
Dear Anna and Jonathan,\n\nI'm taking a moment to comment on your video once again for a very good reason. I would like to thank you both for allowing me the privilege to have a glimpse into your daily lives and I am grateful for it. You and your amazing family had never failed to put a smile on my face and have helped me through many tough times. You two are an inspiration to me and I only hope to have a marriage and little family of my own someday just like yours. Always remember, there is no such thing as the perfect parent, but you two have done incredibly well and Emilia and Eduardo's manners, including Emilia tipping the pizza man, are a symbol of how well you have done. Please continue to make videos and never change.\n\nFrom a happy viewer and one of your biggest fans,\nKayleigh
got real emotional at the end there! can't believe how fast shes grown. can't get over this beautiful family with three incredible kiddos<3
I remember being told to mix my breastmilk with the baby food when I started feeding Mari solids
I bought a calendar ! Eeeeeekkkk soooooooooooooooooooooo excited love your videos soooooooooooooooooooooo much

This was great. I'm glad I found this channel, very relatable
I love you. But you could’ve just done with one. Be grace.
Dick eating hoe diet consist 24 coves a night literally hit her up on tinder
Here's a thing. I am also 32. yay....
Happy Birthday, Grace! Here's wishing that your year is incredible!
I actually love your douchebag cousin.
You gotta love Grace
I hope she'll make couple of videos with her mother and brother during the Christmas season :)
Great video! Happy Birthday Grace, you make my day better whenever I watch you. Thank you for that.\nAlso, the final expression in the video is precious.
Happy birthday! And also you should totally be a drag queen.
I think I want that sweater. Where'd you get it Grace?
whats the video at 3.38 ?
Happy bday why am I her
You share a birthday with my cat!!
I always forget we almost share a birthday (mines the 28th). Hello from the land of 38 year olds, where we miss being 32 and thinking that 32 was old. :)\nHappy birthday Grace!
Happy happy happy birthday! I love you Grace!

That last one tho! P.S. Wasn't Goose's former name Phoenix?
32? Fuck, I wish she was still in her 20's so she'd still be young and fuckable. Middle aged women aren't attractive.
you're a queen 💓
I make videos sometimes and sometimes I don't. XD  Stay silly and wonderful Gracie. :D

Happy belated birthday! By the way, Forrest Lawnzzz (#30) is excellent :).
Hey Grace, I don't know.

Happy birthday!! I hope that I look as good as you when I'm 32... Except that I'm 39... and a boy... Damn you're hot!!!
4:25 Why was blonde Michelle Wie in this video? Makes no sense.
32 things you've learnt this year = 32 reasons why I love this channel 🔥❤
Thank you once again !! I really wish more people could laugh at themselves more. It just makes sense to want to laugh!!
Everything I learnt this year came from this video.
Grace, can i have your top...it speaks to me!
You are one of my favorite humans
GRACIEEE you old fuck I love you
Haven't heard from Margaret Cho or Clidoris Trembles in sooo long!
I'll be 32 this Halloween! Happy birthday Grace!
Can you say HELLO to Matreya for me please, please thank you.
How to get a haggard face?
this is also a reminder of the segments grace has introduced and immediately abandoned
we have the same bday!
When I was 32 I went to Disney World for the fist time. Just saying.
Everyone needs a Grace Helbig in their lives, just sayin'.
Happy bday grace thank you for making the internet a better place xoxo
Your greatest hits!! Love it.
I have grown up watching you grace. I started when I was 14 and now I am 21. You feel like an old friend. You really do. Happy Birthday and Thank you!
Don't trust my comment. In me I trust, says Tony Montana. Really though I rarely think anyone would care.

Happy Birthday Grace!!! :) <3 <3
Doesn't it suck not being good at processing emotion. To day someone told me the reason a helicopter had been hovering over my village was because some girl got drunk and tried to commit suicide by jumping into the harbour and my response is an awkward smile and saying well that was a great idea in a sarcastic tone....what is wrong with me. And when people tell me a problems all i can suggest is tea. And when I sign cards I can only think of really generic things to say because i'm really bad at sentimentality.  The weird thing is that I am actually a really caring person....i just don't convey it well.
Haaaa congratulations Jessyyyyy
God damn amazing!!!
super cool video!
great bro.. just great
awesome
You definitely made something awesome
Love it
You ever shop at Homedepot?
Nice
Very cool!!

Impressive. Thanks for sharing
U really rock
Cool~!
Im so jealous

SO awesome!
I NEED ONE!
More big projects!
nice workshop .
well done Sir 👏👏👏
grat video!
Really dig this one.
*Wow!*\n_Enough said_
Make more!
Those chickens are adorable 😊
Bravo; well done. Enjoyed your presentation.
Can't wait for a black cat to sneak in there.  It's going to ruin your white palace of a work shed lol
Can't wait for a full house build!!!\nLove this video, so many good ideas!🙏
Excellent build! Keep them coming please
the only thing  missing in there is insulation, this thing will be hot as an oven in the stummer and cold in the winter.
Ryobi and husky should pay you for all the plugs...nice job.
Dude one of the best videos so far!
If this is just for your sister. You need to do another on to be the next level.  A shtf shed plus instead of running tool charger via inverter. In my dewalt world. I just use car charger plug directly to the charge controller so I don’t lost energy thru ac dc conversion.  But damn dude I need to watch this video over and over. The most awesome parts are the details. My solar panel just drill Directly to shed. Lol
Well, now that you have a lawn mower... you'll need a lawn!
This is amazing, such a smart space. Would love to work there.
The only thing missing is closed cell insulation and tiles.
MORE WHITE TO THE GOD OF WHITE
I insulated my 24 x 12 workshop from the bare internal framework stage using 4 recycled bottle-glass wool, then lined the inside walls and ceiling with drywall board before any fitting out took place. This means it is a cosy area to work in and very cheap to heat in winter. Widows are double-glazed ex-demo units from a local distributor. Google 'the shedifice'
The title reads Building a solar powered workshop. Instead, it should be Having someone else build a solar powered workshop. I can appreciate the idea of this, but would have rather see you do the work so you had buy in to the project instead of just dropping a crazy amount of cash. I've priced the prebuilt sheds, and scratch built in my area Prebuilt doesn't even come close to what I can build myself, and are built to a lesser standard than I am comfortable with once built. Thanks for the heads up though, for the 4oo watt kit solar panel set up., That was a great nugget of wisdom.
Would it take much more to make a living space out of one of these sheds? Maybe another project for your list?
Niiiiice! Absolutely great job. Many good ideas to adopt. Thanks for this great video.
Love how you guys did the video,i have a Q why use 6volt batterys and not larger 12 volts ?\nand you made so much space for items,nice real nice job.
How much did it all cost?
great idea, and what a time to live in where affordable tech enables these applications!
Nice! You could make series our of a build this size.
Over the top project congrats!
I love it you dick. *Jealous*
Hey there, what capacity/type of batteries did you use? And how much life do you get out of them?
Hey! Mike Montgomery I knew that sounded familiar! You guys should do a project together but your designs definitely can't be beat
Was this funded by Home Depot? Great video.
Very very veeeeryyyyyyy nice project!!!\nBest regards from down here in Brazil!!!
Awesome.. And affordable, in my country it would cost 3 times and it not even be near to that quality
like this long videos for this major projects though it was a little fast
I've watched thousands of DIY, how-to-repair/install/build, tiny home build, off-grid build, etc. videos and this is by far one of the most fluid videos I've ever seen in production.  Fantastic job here -- there's hardly any step that an amateur craftsman cannot figure out -- you detailed the key steps without missing your surprisingly brisk pace of explanation.\n\nI know you said you added the link to your podcast on the photovoltaic solution details, but it would have been nice to have a quick inserted sentence on how you wired your 4 100w panels (2 parallel 2 series or 4 parallel I imagine) and then added a quick floating link to the podcast for more details on voltage/amperage configuration on both your panels and battery bank.  \n\nI'll be bookmarking this for two sheds and a workshop bench I'm working on currently -- great tips and ideas.
Hey man, you did a Great job all the way around!
Great work, so much useful information. I saved this video, I will have to keep coming back to take it all in.
Cool setup I would love to make a setup like that someday for my self
Love it!!!! Excelent job!!!! Kisses from Argentina!!
You're an amazing brother!!! <3
Wow that's cool who would think u could run a work shop on solar power great idea thanks Tony
very nice work..looks reliable and renewable..great!
Yes this was so amazing, I love it! So inspiring to breech large scale projects, so ready to see a house build. Also super nice of you to make this for your sister
Wow that was awesome. Great work, great ideas , great choice in everything. Mastermind is what you are. Congratulations
dreaming to build but unfortunately I stay in apartment! that too in India😂
Sponsored by Home Depot I guess
Why didn’t you insulate it?
Really well done!  esp liked the time lapse footage, thanks.
Great little workshop. What size inverter did you go with? 2000W?
Awesome build! .....but OCD alert!  That power strip is crooked. Tear the whole thing down and start over!! Lol 😂
a real great video
What did that Tuff Shed cost you? You don't need to pour a concrete slab for a base for the shed?
I'm in love with this project. Yes! More big projects! My partners and i new house has an old built-in shed, and im going to update it with your tips 😁 keeping my eye on your vlogs
Damn, your painting friend is proper fit!
Ben, LOVE the video. A complaint that I have always had is that your videos are always short, projects are small. I loved this project, I wish I had the space to put something like this in my back yard! Great job, looks AMAZING!
spectacular. i'm already planning a workshop but the solar power part really impressed me. I WILL be using solar for my shop.
Good job Ben and team! (Y) Sweet build!
would you share the cost of the whole project?
Great job.  I want this for a craft space.
That was a great build, thanks for the detail on the solar aspect of this project. Great work, looks amazing 😃
awesome vid, loved your style and use of timelapse. I also like that you kept it all business with no real filler, just all useful informtation. I am very interested in doing a project like this myself in the future and will come back to this video when I'm ready. keep up the good work. also how much did this project cost in total, and how long did it take?
I want this workshop!
Wow.....so much genius in one video.... well done Sir!
I love that this is one video.  Straight to the point most other channels would have stretched it out over multiple videos
Good editing.  Like that you don't waste time
Hi My work shop is close to 25 years old, similar size and was built with my father in law ( great fun ) and as of last year has a solar panel system 450W and slightly bigger deep cycle gel battery storage running a 240volt fridge thru a 3000W inverter approximately 400 litre fridge/freeze continuously with a timer off switch for night time isolation. It can also run band saws table saw and other mains power tools but Max's out at 6000w when drawn for 8+ seconds I.e. major motor startups otherwise surprising similar and I still have back up mains power with PV mains inverter feed system from the house anyway. \nNo major issues with power supply and none of this weekend warrior crap, it just takes a little time effort and research. No assistants and no one designing and installing it for me, so yes I agree in can be done! NSW in Oz
After watching this and hearing your goals about building an affordable house I just had to subscribe
This is great, well done. I just posted this video on The Perfect WorkShop https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfectworkshop/
Advertisement for Home Depot and their brands much?
This is soooo awesome!!!! Those sheds are so unbelievably affordable. Can I ask what building code challenges you had to face? Did you have to get permits of any sort? Also do you think it would be feesible to have this shed turn into a tiny little adu unit or perhaps even a working office space? It looks fantastic!
Awesome new shop. See if Home Depot might sponsor Rod and donate him a free shirt!
Just an idea, when you showed of the bandsaw on the rolling cart, when you plugged it in the cable just stretched across half the space. If you werent being careful you could walk there, run through the cable and knock over the bandsaw (maybe breaking it). Would't it be a better idea to get a power strip in the middle of the shed hanging from the ceiling from some kind of bracket? then you dont have to worry about knocking anything over if you arent careful
All that ryobi, and a rigid shop vac....
Tornado: Bye bye house and Ryobi
So, was this video sponsored by the Home Depot?
Paid advert without a disclosure😂
I am sure you can build a shed like that for less than 5k.
Why a jacketed ground wire?  It is after all grounded and at NO potential voltage ... right?  No Shock hazard.
I can listen to your voice all day 😍 absolutely obsessed 💙🖤❤️
I could listen to a audio of your voice without any video and be completely content and happy but the work you did is amazing!!! Idk which side I liked the most.
This is so amazing!
How do you learn to talk like this?? Seriously someone link me a video I MUST adopt this accent it is everything
That’s ART in its purest form . I admire your sophistication . A rare commodity now a days .
I like John, but I hate this character he’s made. Look at his first video to now, this accent is so fake and not necessary
I seriously cannot stop watching your videos. I've never come across someone so skilled at the art of makeup.
I wish I was able to give your videos a thousand thumbs up. You are, without a doubt, my favorite person on YouTube as of late. 🤗🤗🤗
There are simple makeup artists...and then there are artists who happen to choose makeup for their medium. You are the latter. Positively stunning!
how i did my makeup in high school john i’m waiting
You're a beautiful soul🖤💙
You have an artist's eye! I'm a graphic designer and I'm really enjoying how you use color, gradient and lighting in a way that compliments the curvature of facial features. I always know when I have a great design when I can't stop looking at it. I feel like you've accomplished that feeling with this tutorial. I would really enjoy it if you shared more of these editorial and artistic looks with us. They are very amazing and show us the power of makeup in a way that isn't being portrayed on YouTube.
Oh my God, your channel is growing! I'm so excited for you!
I feel like you're staring into my soul and judging all of my life decisions. Your eyes are such a piercing, icy blue, and you rarely blink. I adore your videos regardless.
That looks is GORGEOUS!!! I love the contrast between the made-up side and the more organic side. I also adore how you teach how to play with the light in our day to day makeup while showing it in this editorial look!! Wonderful!!
5:19 ...victim, which is very fashionable to be, nowadays. Oh my word you are a killer hahahaha.
This isn't makeup this is art
Well I died and went to creative makeup heaven
Incredible look by an amazingly talented artist. More avant garde creations please! Much love :}
I love how the Krylon looks. I would love to see you do a Krylon pale skin foundation video.
If I attempted this look I'd look like a mauled Smurf. You are very skilled and it's a pleasure to watch!
This is indeed quite chic
This is almost reminiscent of the cubism art style! Love it!!
when i apply gel liner in the waterline, i take the end of a brush and dip it in the liner, it irritates my eye less
You're simply a breath of fresh air. I'm upset over the immense amount of time I've wasted on less-than-brilliant channels these past few years.
I love seeing you opening up more to us <3
Those people who dislike this are complete buttocks.
The face and makeup is amazing but I personally don’t feel the red wig goes with it
I am impressed. However I can't help but cringe at the thought of washing all of the brushes after this...
Your voice is so soothing, I could listen to you all day!
It has a bit of a Blade Runner feel. Just Beautiful, John.
Hey john I love your YouTube channel and I think that you have awesome makeup videos. There super helpful for me when it comes to putting on my makeup everyday. I was wonder if u would ever be interested in doing like a mukbang eating show or an asmr show? Love you xoxo
Would anyone eles love to hear him say yassss slayyy queen just me? Ok
Why don't you have more subscribers, you are perfect!
Your voice and accent is so stunning
I'm really not a fan of them. I think they're slightly rancid. I'm cackling with wild abandon here! :'D
5:18 victim which is very in fashion to be in nowadays 😂😂😂
This is gorgeous!! I would just add some bright contact lenses!
“Now I’m going to begin sculpting the face with Illamasquas powder eyeshadow in te shade ‘Victim’... which is very fashionable to be nowadays”\n\nThat shade doe.
I am in love with how sophisticated you speak and your voice, makeup and everything!!
Can you please list products used in your description box in future videos? Please and thank you
All of her videos feels like a master class not just a tutorial.
New Subbie. You're accent is very regal and stunning. You have me hanging on hour every word!
Listening to you talk and create is my therapy
You're the bob ross of makeup 😊
I look forward to watching your videos. You are teaching me so many things, makeup and vocabulary
Why does he remind me of morticia?
I've only discovered you in the last weeks and I'd been blown away by your voice, your passion and your expertise. Seeing you have fun with this video made my heart absolutely sing. You look stunning and the individual techniques were interesting and amazing. More people need to be aware of you. You are simply incredible xx
I seriously need you to do my makeup
I've often been dissapointed at the lack of vocabulary of some other MUAs on youtube, but this is almost the complete opposite, far more in depth & more explanatory.
Love this! More of these please!
In the shade: 'Victim'. *Which is very fashionable to be, nowadays*  LMFAOOO
so... when did you lose control of this makeup?
This video is probably my favorite in YouTube
Aah, this channel is giving me LIFE!! +I can expand my vocabulary in a way I enjoy😄😻❤️❤️❤️💙💙💙
Where did you get those lashes from?  They are so beautiful 😍
my favorite part was when you bite the air. I love you immensely darling <3
does this look resemble the femininity and masculinity present within you, the way that each manifests?
I wish we can be friends 😊❤️
he soinds so enthused to be doing this look, its lovelt to see him so happy and passionate
This is magic! You're brilliant!
you already look like an alien.
You have one incredible talent that is so rarely seen. I'm very excited to see what is in store for your future!
Can u make a video on makeup removal...??
Just when I thought my eyes were open and I've seen everything that makeup can do to transform,  you have opened my third eye and I'm now seeing a whole new world of art, talent and magic.  I thank you for sharing your gift with us. Xo
The blue starts to look quite intense...*this being said once a third of the face is already blue* \n.\n.\nI really appreciate how this look came out John. It's beautifully blended and exceptionally creative.
This is fantastic to watch be created. I am going to be going to a convention for cosplay and the creativity is inspiring. Thank you.
This is amazing. Love the artistry.
This is so Grace Jones 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I love it!!!!!!
Victim, which is fashionable to be lately Fantastic! I love that you have such wonderful little lines within your videos!
19:34 - 19:58 me in the mirror every morning
Do you know what I love about your videos?  You don't just dub them or use voice overs. You give off an expression as you explain everything you are doing as if we are your friends, or perhaps students. I enjoy that we get to see all expressions of you; your voice, your word choices, your facial expressions and your talented hand at work creating a masterpiece . This is so soothing to watch. I believe you produce a positive refreshing, original kind of art.
This look gives me 'The fifth element' vibe, Love it!
victim, which it's very fashionable to be these days.... OH MY GOD JOHN SAVAGE
Ugh that cut crease is life!
You're literally me when I can't stop putting on highlighter
From one fellow androgyne to another... it's so refreshing to see another male comfortable in both his more masculine form as well as when he creates a more feminine illusion. Stunning androgyny as always - and a real class act to boot! \nStay fabulous xx
My goodness... You've transformed into an some sort of beautiful alien. The deep orange hair compliments the split skin tone wonderfully. I shall call you Gwendolyn Phaslor from the ice world, Lurren. You work as a spy operative and dismantle tyrannical regimes lol.
omg plz make more videos. I am addicted to your content! plz dont ever dissapear for more than a few days
Hahahahaha love your subtle sarcastic comments every so often. 😂😂💖💖
Victim, which is very fashionable to be nowadays  - Haha I love that... sadly so true
Hi John, I was wondering if you could do a blue eyeshadow look, that you could wear more often than this, although it is gorgeous. And could you also do a makeup storage and favourite products video?
Gorgeous!
“Slightly rancid”
greasy finga
nice vid, thank you!
WOW.
I adore your voice ohmygosh
Vampy vibes loving it
19:48 my favorite thing
I'm stunned 😍👌
His smile makes me smile
Reminds me of Mystique
Wow, stunning!
i love you ❤❤❤
Just WOW! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
What a fruit.
I love this.  The black side (with the blue highlights) would make an excellent base for a galaxy inspired design - replete with comets, stars and nebulae.  Thank you for all your excellent videos!!
the blue part is absolutely stunning, but a bit uncomfortable to see so much black on a white person's face haha
I love editorial looks, they give you such an opportunity to have fun and forget about the rules. Please do more, John! Also, your victim comment made me laugh, lol. Took me a second to get it.
Hey folks, hope you enjoyed the video! It'd mean a lot to me if you guys checked out Tab for a Cause; what they're doing is truly amazing and I've proudly been opening tabs for just over a week now. As a stats nerd it's insane how something as mundane as the new tab page can help raise funds for charities across the world. Go download it here: http://tabforacause.org/businesscasual
AMD next! I've really been enjoying the videos lately.
Are you fine with the shitposter... I mean..... The editor putting Felix the trap in your videos
When you can have registered lobbyists in a parliament/senate then it really shows that the democratic process is fucked up in a country....
Do Kodak next
Umm...... why was Felix the trap-o-cat hiding behind that stack of cash.....
Now AT&T likes to fuck us in the ass
I still love Business Casual, I'm pissed at YouTube for not giving me the notifcation though :P
Great video, and a sponsor I can get behind. Thanks!
Some notes on the weakened AT&T ... it was much larger and more profitable than the baby bells.  It ran 80% of the Internet.  It still had bell labs for its entire run.  I would trace its demise to the MCI worldcom multi-year illegality of stating false profits which real companies could not compete with.  Also a failure for the federal government to enforce the telecommunications completion act.  In the end the Internet bubble busted and the most unimaginative and backward baby bell, SBC, had the cash on hand to buy the name and what was left.
Do The Walt Disney Company!
Best girl is at it again. What does Felix say at 5:30?

What about Cingular?
These videos are so good. Well versed, brilliantly created, punctuated with pure intelligence. THIS is what YouTube needs.. NOT Jerk Porl.
Fascinating learning the history of this huge businesses. To see their strategic plays over the years is interesting to see how they are still relevant today. Great videos!
So... the US govt destroyed a company once, and now they're helping companies (such as; Google, Boeing, JP Morgan, etc) with tax payers money? I wonder....
Satellite internet my peeps; thats where I believe AT&T is and always planned to be heading towards with the aquisition of DTV. Another great video @BusinessCasualYT. Nostradomus out.
AT&T acquiring Time Warner will not make them a larger broadband provider as that portion of the business was already sold off to Charter.  They would only be acquiring the media portion of Time Warner.
That felix cameo though

Is it laggy for everyone?
still less than comsuk
Did tab for a cause pay you? Because if they did it means they’re not using 100% of the money I give for charity... they use that to advertiser (such as paying you) and maybe who knows? If they do that, they might also pocket some money
2:21 gotcha!
and what was the greatest invention of the 20th century ?
Do one on Carlos Slim and Claro!
Maybe do Philips soon? The lightbulb manufacturer that makes MRI and CAT scans.

Time Warner was formed when Time inc merge with Warner communication. Then they merged with Aol and mad Aol Time Warner but then they spun off Aol in 2009 They used to own Warner Music, Group,Warner Books,Time Warner Cable,Aol and Time inc
This video naturally overlooks a lot of history in order to keep the video relatively short.  For example, people often claim that landline phone service was a natural monopoly, because how efficient would it have been to run multiple, competing phone lines?  While that certainly pointed to a difficulty early phone companies had, it doesn't really make it a natural monopoly,  Instead, the companies were working out agreements to share the phone lines, so that multiple lines weren't necessary.  Bell Telephone, however, successfully argued the natural monopoly argument to local legislators, and got them to grant local monopolies to phone companies, and Bell, being the biggest phone company at the time, was well-positioned to receive most of those government-granted monopolies.\n\nAnd, in fact, national telecommunications in the U.S. was nationalized, if only briefly:\n\nIn 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid duplication. The claim was that telephone service was a natural monopoly, meaning that one firm could better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_AT%26T\n\nThe history of phone service in the U.S. would have been very different if government intervention hadn't occurred.
You should do a video on Compaq Computers
AT&T built it but was bought out by Southwestern Bell Communications. Who knew.
Thanks for the video, you deserve 1M subs. This could be a show on the History Channel.
You're infringing on my copyright pay-tint!
My grandmother worked for Bell South.

If Disney can do it they might as well be allowed to.
Would love for you to have incorporated the AT&T copper mines in Chile and the Kissinger memo urging for US intervention.
You are awesome Business Casual!! Loved this video :) Could you make one video about TV broadcast companies like Cable TV/Dish TV etc?
I'm going to see this again I didn't catch it all, at all.
i just found your channel I love it already
Thumbed up regardless of my views.
I like your videos. You're cool.
Did J.P. Morgan just invest in or buy anything he could?
Ayy fuck Americans we don't have any of these
I hate at&t
Great video!
technically bell canada is the real company behind the phone since it is the only division left of the original bell
Apart from the third party operators out there, one familiar to those my age is GTE (General Telephone), whose service differed greatly from Bell/AT&T as they had to have their own phones and wires.  Don't forget before 1984, Bell was the only company to manufacture their own phones that customers could only pay to have installed in their homes.  You just don't go out and buy an extra phone as it didn't work that way.  That all changed after the breakup and we started to see a lot of cheaply-produced phones out on the market.  Bell System phones (made by Western Electric) were heavy and practically unbreakable like tanks. \n\nGetting back to GTE, they mostly serviced specific areas Bell wasn't it, usually rural/suburban.  My grandma had GTE where she was and I can remember the odd noise the dialer made and the rings itself.  I'm sure this all had to do with those  specific patents AT&T had.\n\nIt should be noted, outside of DirecTV, AT&T also has it's own broadband service including DSL and a cable TV service called U-Verse in a number of markets they do operate landline phone service in (like the former Ohio Bell in my state).
10:16 Traps will not divide us...

I also live in Orlando, Florida & I have Fiber Internet provides by AT&T for a good price. But here they do have to compete with Spectrum Cable as well.
I might start using his tab for a cause, I have between 80 and almost 200 tabs opened. And once I check them all I'll end up opening more anyway.
I'm enjoying the hidden felix's
That Russian accent though.
Can You Do Nickelodeon Or Cartoon Network?
I think you guys made a mistake at the end... AT&T is indeed trying to buy Time Warner, the entertainment company, but not Time Warner Cable, so them acquiring Time Warner has nothing to do with broadband or internet.
lazy animations...unsubscribed.
5:29.  No way, anime girl.  This show isn't stupid at all
nice anime at the big bang xD notice me sempai. yes traps are gay are gay not the old word for jolly
That jab at Ajit Pai, OMG THAT WAS GREAT.
12 I'm early
It's like that returd, larry page, and his bullshat google fiber. It was DOA. comcraps and the rest own the internet and will not let you join, and fiber costs a fkload to lay and is impractical except for BUSINESS use, like internet2 at 100Gb/s.
AT&T and Time Warner, two big companies combining to make a really big one, remember when this type of thing happened once? Remember how it ended?
At least here in Ohio, Time Warner had been bought out by spectrum instead of at&t.
If Ella doesn't want Boris, I'll take him
Only Nicks with a k are allowed. I love the tribute photo to you and John and I would've guessed old ladies as well if it weren't for the tuna.
He's the nicest one they've had on there. Also can't use a phone.
It's based off our names.
Once a week haha what a strange way to describe the kind of physical set you're looking for in a man.
This guy likes the Grateful Dead. STILL hahaha omg I love it
I love his advice at the end basically.... its so very true .... i love Nick Kroll so much, even more now
Her voice and laugh is amazing
9:58 - this guy likes The Grateful Dead. Still   //  Savage.
7:32 my thoughts and prayers to my man Stefan. He never had a chance.
Still waiting for one of these videos with the genders reversed.. Seriously, I can't imagine half of the shit that is said in this video getting a laugh with the genders reversed.
Are they getting hooked up or what? I'm pretty sure he was flirting, and she liked that shit.
Haven't laughed so much in a *long* time
I loved this haha, this should be a show or something with nick as the host
tbh Ella seemed more into nick kroll than the dudes on tinder
That's the least assholey I've seen Nick Kroll act.
Boris really needs to get over his grammar fetish.
i really wanna see ella and boris go on a date they seem to have a nice sense of humour
Wow you swiped left on the Asian without any comment.
I just realized that I have a crush on Nick Kroll. wow
He was so much more sweet and thoughtful than anyone else.
Bryan, 25. Phish, The Grateful Dead.... First pic is me and the best  mom in the world at a show. We go to a ton of concerts together HAHA, Tinder is fucking full of weirdos
Y'all see that tuna?
It's crazy Ira annnnd the DOUCHE!!
I wanted to see what her friend answered back
What a nice guy Nick is.
😂 nope that's been on my tinder ellaaa.. OH HELLO BE MY FRIEND ELLA
this guy's not funny irl & it's sad because you can tell he tries really hard unlike eric andre
Nick Kroll is a national treasure.
Can you imagine if you saw yourself on this video haha
He starts talking about how it's okay to mess up on a text right after he sent one that started with I will I am tall.
why does his forehead look like a hydraulic press crushed it
Hey, I don't have kids . But I'll put one in ya 😂😂💀
I'd pay to see Tinder Takeover with Jeff dunham
Man I haven't laughed this hard in ages!
Did....did he just say Cyrano de Borat? Okay, I'm in love.
His eyes are the most unique color of green. Beautiful
Nick Kroll is a savage.
When u gotta pretend like you've never used tinder
Plot twist, these two should date!!!!
Boris really out here making moves.
Can Nick Kroll date Ella? I think they'd be good together
Boris was a kool dude though. I respect the game
Another reason for me to kms
first mistake, you're using tinder. tinder is for lonely fools that want to stay lonely but get stds too
this made me love nick kroll even more holy fuck
I fucking lost it when his immediate response to that photo was Oh, hello!
Your great Nick Kroll and Ella hope tinder went well
Count how many times she fake laughs
Can we please have a follow up on Borris? I gotta know
didn't know who Nick Kroll was before watching this; definitely a good dude, funny but real and on point - that aside about sending a bad text is amazing
why don't they ever do this for a guy?
Wow I love this item. http://amzn.to/2xJYbzw
I just recognized this guy as the douche 😂
That’s my name
So this is why kroll got his shows canceled not funny
We love your video! Come check out ours 💕 https://youtu.be/m0nGJCK_tzU
This whole video I couldn't look away from Nick Kroll's amazingly beautiful green eyes
Was I the only one rooting for her and Nick Kroll to end up together?
Do you wanna fuck bro?  Is in the running for greatest text ever.
Can you plz get Sarah Silverman to do this
Ohhhh you molest dogs
Wasn't Ella in that Extra Gum commercial?
Nick's eyes are everything....
Nick is my favorite.
Try to get John Mulaney
She funny too tho
hit me up on tinder Ella
Cyrano de Borat?
KROLL how did you miss saying Bye Bye Birdy 9:48
Excellent
Oh, hello!
Boris FTW! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Oh Hello.
hot new \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiPsTXcakBY
Ella should date Nick
Love this guy!
AMAZING
8:30     did she fart?
THE DOUCHE !!!
Oh hello
I think I love nick kroll.
She cute though.
PLEASE JOHN MULANEY NEXT!!!!
Smashed for sure
Ooh these eyebrows are tough
Oh hello
Taller than a locker
“Ohhhh you molest dogs!”\n(Smiling) “Mmhmm”
douche.
Ruxin
Nick Kroll... Is an intellectual...
Ruxin???? is that you?
i like Ella
la la muchi la la muchi midnight
NINOOOOOO
Ruspin hijacks strangers Tinder
If anyone ever asks me what negging is I'll mention Boris
Nick Kroll is a good looking ugly dude. No homo
This man is a pedophile

Not a bad life, Amelia.  Not bad at all!
I love how she did your brows.
I think your father is a bit late on that DNA test haha
If you don't do that in the car then why the frick are you driving? - YES!
Could not stop laughing at your face mask! Reminded me of the scene in Mrs Doubtfire where her face is covered in cake and it just PLONKS into the man's cup 😂😂😂😂
I like the eyeliner she did on you !! It’s not so thick , and it flatters you eye shape . 🤗
No disrespect to Ms. Tibury but I prefer the way you do your makeup. :) You really know how to transform your already gorgeous face!
The RICE😍😍😍
Notification squad!!! 🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆
Lol at 7:13-7:15 the guys in the background
sorry for being nosey but why are you all taking a dna test? i could really feel your positive vibes haha loved it x
Congrats Amelia, I am so happy for you! 4 years ago I bought my first pillowtalk lip liner after your recommendation and I loved it! Since then I have repurchased over and over again! I recently bought the very victoria & pillowtalk lipstick and I fell in love with her matte formulas! Same happened with her light wonder foundation, sooooo good and natural looking! Every product I have tried from her makeup and skincare line in full size or in a sample version, I ended up  loving it and buying it! She does her best and deserves all the praise for that! I wish there were more people so passionate and dedicated to their job like her! By the way, I watched the entire video you did with her and you were adorable! You deserve all this success Amelia!
I love the Dior tour🙋
Love the car karaoke!! 💓💓
currently 2:04am in Melbourne, Australia & I should be asleep but #priorities 😂💘 LOVE YOU AMELIA !
11:02 Duke, the Gremlin haha <3

Such an amazing trip with Dior! Everything looked so beautiful!
Such a special month!!! ☺️🙌🏼🙌🏼⭐️ everything was beautiful!!!

Duke waiting for that treat though!!!!! lol if he were my dog and was that cute, he would be fat on treats
awesome video but seriously..all these 25 minutes ive been so distracted by your nails..WHAT NAIL COLOUR IS THAT!!?Looks gorgeous,love you!
OMG you always look so glamorous! I literally just walked my dog in unicorn onesie pajamas LOLOL <3 xx
Thank you for sharing so much about the Dior trip-so lovely and amazing. And your 👗 was so so pretty
the design of house is timeless
I just love watching your videos... you are so full of life..😍
I feel like for every time I've had my hair done you've had yours redone about 5 times 😫 haha x
U r such a darling love u so much. I feel lots of positivity from just watching u alone. And I recommended ur channel to many of my friends I knew. Lots of love from Singapore 😘👱🏻‍♀️❤️
Wow, what a video, you seem to have a charmed life this month. You look and sound amazing, really enjoyed this video.
❤️❤️❤️
What is the name of that type of rice? The mum-made rice, its the same type of rice Amelia has made in other videos! What is it called? I really want to try making it... it looks so good!
The dress you wore to the dinner was so pretty. Just perfect for the occasion. I love Jasmine. My niece wore a Jasmine headdress in her wedding in India and it was beautiful.
Karaoke in the car! Fun times!!
That Dior mascara was wow!  J'adore is one of my favorite fragrances.  I can't wait to get a whiff of the new one.
The face mask thou hahahahahahha :D
What are konkers (sp)?
17:19 Fanny Bourdette in the background 💜
Your awesome ❤️
Ahhh you are good for the soul Amelia😊
Amelia I couldn't stop laughing by the end of it with your face mask 🤣 by the way you looked so pretty when CB did your makeup! The foundation/ contouring looked amazing as well . You always look gorgeous anyway. Loved the video ❤️
The more you talked the more that face mask deteriorated 🤣
Loved your vlog 😍😍 What nail polish are you wearing? Lots of love ❤️
I prefer the way you do your own make up. You are gifted at elevating subtlety, be it with color, style, jewelry, outfits, etc....you don't need experts---you are gifted, and you need not be intimidated by othersd, Amelia. You are elegant, refined, kind, loyal, and I wish you lots of joy and blessings.❤️
I was just laughing my a** off seeing you with the face mask on! So funny 😂
just curious as to what you do when  there is food at an event. do you tell them your restrictions or just eat some if it?
The  fields 😍
Giiir what are your glasses when you were driving from?????? ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
What's the name of the blusher Charlotte used on you, it looked great!
Amelia you are so lovely!! But the yellow sunglasses are just well, NO :D :D
Girl the dior chateau was a dream 😁
Amelia you look amazing darling!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘Charlotte is just such a sweetheart I'm sure you where on cloud9 best wishes from Ireland 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
I love that black Chanel at the salon you had. Updated bag collection please?
I feel so happy to see that you are happy Amelia!
19 kilos is nothing - that suitcase weighs like 18 on its own!  So beautiful, but so heavy. I bought the (not as pretty) lightweight version because I could barely pick that one up 😂
You looked SO pretty in that but dress at Dior....<3
This was such a good video. It's always a treat to see Duke & Dior's house is fantastic. Thanks
Dior's house looked divine! What an adventure <3
LMAO at your face mask at the beginning! every time you jump cut, it just keeps sagging lower and lower. Legit burst out laughing at 2:33 xoxo
Love Charlotte! can you please post the link to the coat you are wearing whilst walking Duke? the one above isn't working. Thanks
What's a conca?? A chestnut???
You make me feel so energetic . You are always cheerful
You're living a fairytale right now. So happy for you I hope it lasts forever. \nLiterally goals ❤❤
Okay love your hair color 10x more now. I liked it before but now...it's perfect!
If she is Charlotte  u r Amelia  u r really  one of best  make  up  bloggers  🙂
So exciting, thank you for sharing. PLEASE can you share your 23andme DNA results? The results are always so interesting! xx
I don't know what happened with youtube but your video was not in my subscription box. Am I the only one?
I love your earrings Amelia! Where did you get them?
The food looked amazing! please can you share the salad & rice recipes?
The tour of Dior's home was magnificent! Thank you so much for sharing that beauty with us! I'll have to go back and pause it to really study the rooms. So much to see in a split second!
You singing along to Taylor swift in the car is literally me driving home tonight
I think thats the first time Amelia has ever sworn in a video and I had to do a double take on that! Great video!
You talking with that face mask on, had me howling!! 😂
Girl, that face mask is out to get you! 😂
The best!!!!  Of all the trips I've seen YouTubers take this was the best ever.  I want to be you. Great vid.
Actually randomly early for once! Great vid as always Amelia 😘
Why always some judging people are here? They always tell her wht to do about her fashion lens makeup and even life! They should know they bother Amelia and some peop who enjoy her vids.
Wait what is a conker??
That ghemeh bodamjoon looked pretty good though! If that's how you spell it 😂😂
Pretty pink flowers speak to me too Amelia, I completely understand haha
An hour late for an engagement party! The Persian in you is showing!
Hello, Miami girl here. Had to google what a conker was, we don't have those here!! Lol. Super beautiful video, impeccable style as always. Such a dream life surrounded by beautiful places and people 😍
Can you tell which earrings you are wearing pls xx
Duke is the most adorable puppy I've ever seen! What breed is he?
wtf is a conker..... british ppl are crazy
All that wonderful Persian food made me hungry!
Wow where did you get that picture of the peonies? I LOVE IT!!!
Hello! Lovely video! \nWhere is your peony wall picture from? Thanks x
What song were you singing
Where is the gorgeous picture/poster of the pink peonies from? \nLove it 😍😍😍
Amelia, your videos simply make my day. You are genuine and I think you should do more chatty videos. I love hearing you talk xxxx
💗💛💙💜❤
Hi Amelia.\nJust want to let you know dr Josh axe's youtube video was talking about how to get rid of SIBO naturally.\nIf you never seen it maybe you can take a look. \nHope you will get well soon!\n\nBest wishes
aww watched the lifestream while I was baking :D loveee the result and now I really want to own those eyeshadows :Dxx
I just got my results from my 23andme test 😳
is CT cruelty free and vegan??
You are the funniest. I love you for that. So I have a question for you. Do you like more fashion or make up?
Wait, so this is the second official video for this song? Damn he must love this song so much :/

Why on the earth two videos for a song?
Love James since elementary school. His voice and music are both great.
Love this video, which tells a deeper story, and it is so so tragic.    😭😭😭\n\nJames Blunt is a pure artist.  Every song is genuine and from the heart.
So are there 2 official videos?
Amazing video, the best. I was surprised and I was moved because by that james blunt is the best
I can't say no to you, James.
I loooove this song....not all songs, James is the best
Love it -  I love your music Mr Blunt <3
your voice is so amazing
any filipinos listening or am i the only one? (:
The lyrics though... they speak to me!! ❤
I'm confused why does the song has tow videos!!
Great song. My favorite. James is the best.
For a moment there i though that this was the preview story of if time is all i have, amazing video <3 last part gave me chills
I was thinking dis' video could be more... dramatic// I mean, 4 da' lyrics, but good job 4 a very great song // this song remember me my situation: I love it but... I hate it
Elisangela, \nSul real, '?
The little girl is my cousin
This song is the only good in this album. Sorry James, but your last album is so different.
We still got some good Singers
Wow, James Blunt you’re so amazing and hopefully someone will do Remix soon could be great
Hope is the worst motherfucker out of Pandora's can.
This is FANTASTIC, Blunty. There’s a reason why this is one of my favorite songs on The Afterlove.
God bless your voice man!  love your songs!
Video gave me a whole new perspective at the song.
love the song! love from Kazakhstan
my favourite song in The After love
please come to Ecuador again >:(
I think I'd like to listen to his voice for the whole of my life ❤️
OmgI swear that I've cried. Stop to kill yourself in your videos!!
Who else was amazed by the aestehtic and got aboslutely shocked at the and when the car crash happens? goddamn now I'm crying.
I've been learning how to sing most all your music perfectly but this song with the auto tune now I cant =/

Que musica ruim :(  que pena. James Blunt é top. Mas essa musica é ruim
Please make a video for Paradise
*Before my 100th birthday,* I need to find me some me-time to go and see him in concert.\n-\n*There is just no one like him!*  (I love James Blunt!)

YOU’RE THE SHIT BLUNT 💜\nMe embolas muy cañón 🖤
Şuraya bir tane Türk yorumu bırakıym,bir insanın hiç bir şarkısı mı kötü olmaz,yine mü kem mel
... BUT I LOVE YOU ...
Peruvian fans ? 🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪
Kiera, I absolutely adore your makeup in this video!!! You look gorgeous!\nAlso we're the same personality type! Woooo
I love how you called fantastic 4 'fantfourstic' 😂😂
don't get the medusa!!! I think it would look pretty but the scar/hole that it would leave would be in such a noticeable place
How can we find your eBay? Xx
Aww bless Louis x hope you're alright :( 💞💞💞 but thankfully your last video was with him which is beautiful :)
Your make up is studding! You should make a tutorial on it
I've done so many Meyers Briggs tests and I always get INFP as well! :-)
omg you answered my question! thank you so much :))) x
💖 Ahah! We listen to the same music. So glad! 💖\nHope the little souvenir of Louloubean's painting will help in the loss of this sweet lil'thing.\nxx
When you said Fant 4 Stic I laughed really hard because i use to call Fantastic 4 that when I was younger
A medusa would look fab on you I had one a few years back one of the easiest piercings to look after in my opinion - had to take it out for work :'(
You should do a video with highlights from the team beam store x)
Hi Keira, I'm sorry for your loss, I can only imagine the pain you and Alex went through. Your boys warmed my heart and made me love ratties and mice (wich I already loved but didn't know could be such amazing pet friends) and thanks to you all back in April I got two little mice which I love with all my heart. I can never thank the Bean family enough for that. Btw you both ROCK and are as strong as only a bean can be! We subscribers are all with you and we can't wait for you next amazing videos 💕
So sorry to hear about Louis 💔 you gave him and all your rats such good lives! And it's nice that you did that video where you got some of his pawprints, so you have something to remember him by ❤❤
I'm INFP also, apparently we're pretty rare ;)
Kiera, would you pass the butter please?
are you getting any more rats?? xx
Okay. I have a min pin that’s name is Sophie that looks exactly like your little stuffy!! to a tea! \nLove the rick and morty reference at the end 😂😂😂
I've been watching you for yeeaaaars now, waaay back in your ScarletSaint days, and to find out that you love Florence and the machine too is well cool! Florence Welch speaks to me on a spiritual level, she has an incredible voice!🖤
I'm so sorry for your loss, Kiera. I can only imagine how you must feel. I have two rabbits, named Darwin (I named him after your Darwin, he was my fave ratty!) and Daisy :). Darwin has had some medical problems in the past year or so and I cry just at the thought of losing him. They've both helped me so much with my anxiety and depression, it's unbelievable. Fur babies are the best, and even though it's a shame they're with us for such a short time, we should consider ourselves lucky for being able to spend so many precious moments by their side <3
Good luck to you babe . You will be strong and this pain will fade away over time to be replaced with a happy heart for all the great memories you spent together.\nLexi
i can't wait for little doe to return so i can ruin my bank balance and support your shop!! you make the most beautiful jewellery <3
We're the same personality type! I always connect so much with people who are the same type as me, it's nice to understand why I like your channel so much! I'm excited for little doe to launch, are you going to do more jewellery, like rings and bracelets?
You should watch Nasty Gal on netflix.. or is it amazon. It is really cool and could totally be you with thrifting!
I'm an INFP too! I always thought you were :)
Just do it! I got an Ashley piercing last month and I love it! 😍😙
That blue cat was actually the stuff of nightmares! Haha
I feel your pain, my pup of 13 years just passed away yesterday, I can't believe it, and I find myself expecting to see her come around the corner, and then I remember that she's gone...it's the hardest thing ever. \nSo my heart hurts for you, sending you lots of love.
QOTSA!💓
your eyeshadow looks amazing!
Second comment, but if you do the ebay charity thingie with thrifted items If you find any could you list plus size finds? I would love to have a browse but I'm like a 18 or 16 on a good day :)
I know that seeing my goals in practice with other people really helps me achieve them because I can visualise them better. If you're like me and would find this useful, you should check out Christine Kobzeff's channel. She makes jewelry as a full time job, employs her husband, and goes to outdoor markets and fairs regularly to sell (but also to go flee market shopping!)
I've been following you since your first adventures with the beans. I got two of them at the same time actually and that's why I found your channel! I got into a depression and didn't watch much YouTube or go on Instagram or anything and then I came back and saw how many beans you've lost. I knew it was inevitable but it still sucked to see you sad. I almost mourned with you, because I lost mine at the same time. I don't know where I'm going with this but to say I'm sorry and even I'm the worst of times, know you have a support system.
I'm so sorry to hear about Lou :c I can't imagine.... It's always hard losing a pet because to us they're not our pets they're our family our children our best friends.. May Lou rest peacefully.
idk... a medusa is so front and center
I just got my medusa and I am so happy! I have my septum pierced too. I will say that the medusa didn't hurt as bad as my septum but you do feel that needle more moving through your skin lmao. I even got both my nostrils pierced when I got my medusa. Nose hurt me more than the lip piercing. You would look gorgeous with the medusa <3 Sending love to you for the loss of your ratty babe <3
I just about died at I pass butter xD
I'll share my own opinion on the piercing ONLY cause you asked for feedback. When someone has such a beautiful face AND amazing makeup and hair abilities, piercings just take away from it. I don't like them. They never make someone look better imo. At least with a septum, you can not wear it and the hole isn't visible. The lip one--probably not so much.
I also have a poser clock. I use to use it but then the ticking started driving me CRAZY so I had to take the batteries out. Now it just sits on my night stand looking pretty and gathering dust 😂
In a very similar position - four ratties to none. They do leave a hole but you'll always have given themthe bestlives they could have asked for x (edit- god yes get that piercing )
I’m so sorry about Louis 💕 sending lots of love.
Get your Medusa!! It'll look awesome on you!
Woooo! welcome to the Mediator Group! I know its not real science or anything, but i love this kind of shit. That site particulary, i really enjoyed. I read through the entire Mediator pages and descriptions and ive never seen a personality description so apt. Of course its not 100%, but some of the things it go t right were so right, like in ways i never had the words for before. I was quite impressed.
holy I'm an infp-t as well! Do you ever feel like you're an empath? Whenever I meet other infp's, I've found that we tend to be extremely empathic <3
I love your passion for making genuine videos that you want to make, without having to worry about views etc :) I can't wait until you have your business up and running. 🌈 All the best to you and Alex 💜
also get your medusa pierced! it would look amazing!!! i would have got mine already but my job doesn't allow it :( your very lucky that you can have all the tattoos and piercings you like! so doo eeeet
I made the test a few days ago and i am a mediator, too. I really get you and how you just want to do little doe. you are so passionate about it and I am absolutely in love with his. \nAnd a medusa would look really cute on you.
lovely babycakes, Im so sorry about Louis. that's all I wanna say<3
You were an amazing rattie mummy and they loved you tons! Huge hugs my lovely x
I love your widow's peak!
Hope you're okay and sorry about little Louie. Least you have happy memories of them all and have the videos and pictures of them that you did :) they'll always be in you're heart and always be around as little spirit beans 💙
so sorry to hear about your precious  bean, its so hard to cope with. Please please please dont get your gorgeous hair cut it looks amazing .My hair is the same length and colour but sadly doesnt look as amazing as yours.Sorry but i think a piercing above your mouth will drive you nuts, especially when eating or talking, love your videos , really look forward to them, love to you and alex
i have my nose septum and medusa and i love all of them i think it would suit you so much! Xx
I'm so sad to hear about Louie ❤ I had two girl mice with my boyfriend, and they were my everything. (We even bought a real Swarowski mouse on a vacation, because it reminded us of them, lol) The first one (Makker) had to be put down a year ago this summer, and her sister (Bakker) had to be put down a year ago this November coming up. I had to take 3 days off work BOTH times because everything made me cry. It might sound so dramatic, but honestly, I still can't look at pictures of them or even talk about them for too long without crying to this day. It annoys me so much, because I would LOVE to relive all the good memories we had, but I just can't yet. Even telling this is making me emotional. I just wanted to say that I'm so terribly sorry about what you are going through, but as you said youself; you know he had a great life. ❤❤🐁 much love from Denmark.🌟
Btw as someone who works as a part of the CITV scheduling team I can assure you that grizzly tails and my parents are aliens are still frequently shown on that channel. Let's all get nostalgic ;) absolutely adore you Kiera <3
Because of you I got three pet ratties called Greg, Oscar and Alfie. They’re 3 months old now and I’m in love with them, they have bought me so much happiness! I’m so sorry about your loss, they do only live a short time :( x
We have the same music taste 😍 you named all my faves 💕 love you and hope all is well 🌿✨
i love your The Room references so much, oml
I'm so sorry for your loss honey I hope that it gets easier <3 I love your make up and your top in this video could you do a tutorial on the eye look? xx
Love Hozier! So sorry to hear about Lou 😢
I'm so excited you answered my question! Love your videos, they're always so calming :)
I felt really sad about Lou :c hope you get well love ur videos <3 !
Awww I'm so sorry about Louis!!
I'm so sorry about Lou bean 🐁 xx
Get the piercing girl!
I'm so happy that you like paranormal shows too :) Have you ever considered doing a video about your paranormal experiences? I would love to hear about them! Also, I'm so sorry to hear about Louis :( I hope that you and Alex are doing ok xx
What eyeshadow and lipstick are you wearing? 😍
Oooh I'm a mediator too !\nMuch love from France, as always ❤️
It's good to see you again! <3
MY GOD, YOU ARE ADORABLE! Thanks for your beautiful video and beautiful thoughts. <3
OMG OMG OMG... Okay, so Kiera Rose just answered my question in one of her videos... I can see unicorns now
Oh my gosh yes Dougal and the Blue Cat!! Finally someone else who knows what this is. Thank you 😊
LOL the Johnny and Rick and Morty edits <3 Hope you're doing well and YES PLS to the medusa!
I used to cry as a child when I realized my pets would eventually die 😢
COMMIT! You can take it out if you hate it. It'll be nice! :3
*hugs- I totally understand your feelings with Lou Bean. ): I spent almost the whole week before Kari had to be pts crying because I just knew the surgery didn't work and there was nothing left to be done, because hand feeding just wasn't helping. UGH now I'm tearing up. lol\n\nI honestly don't blame you for skipping the if you'll get more question (be it you meant to or just didn't see it). I currently still have 3 and have lost 3, in the same three years PLUS 4 I took in to help after Hurricane Harvey. I'm honestly wondering if I really want more after this or not...\n\nI will forever love rats but between the loss and heart break, we're also finally taking the steps to get our first home and save towards the wedding (and to go to a friend's wedding across the country!), I just don't know if I would be able to take on more after this. v.v
I’m an INFP too!
I'm so sorry for your loss Kiera. I always enjoyed your rat videos a lot and they're are the reason I found your channel! Much love and stay strong x
I pass butter... Every time I think I couldn't love you any more... 😂
I am a mediator too! Apparently we make up just 4% of the population. No wonder I have no friends XD
Love you lady x <3
u are so 70s omg. also ur hair looks gorgeous!!
I ASKED A TATTOO QUESTION AND YOU MAY DO A TATTOO QUESTION VIDEO YASSSSSSSSSSSS, Sorry about your little beans! <3 I have 4 ratties and i cant bare to think about when my beans are gone :(
I’m so Sorry to hear about Louis. ❤️ BTW you have beautiful porcelain skin 💚
Rip Louis🐀😢💙
Medusa !!! Definitely

Yes commitment
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! (medusa piercing)
I'm INFP toooooooo!!! 💕💕💕
Definitely get a medusa piercing!!!!!
im sorry about your loss :/ i hope you feel better 💛 // p.s. im an ENFP!! so cloooose hahah
After I lost all my ratties I thought I would never want to be a little fuzzy mum again, then I rescued a ferret :| ( the charity was going to kill him because no one wanted him ). I have never looked back, he's such a character, and so so funny. Just a thought.
so sorry to hear about little louis, at least he's with the other boys now 🌈💖 sending loads of love ur way. thank u for being such a fantastic rat mummy & giving these lovely boys a wonderful life 💕
I freaked out at that clip from the room and kept replaying it. You're my favourite customer byeeeee!
Eyelash glue a little screw top/ ball top piercing to your lip and test if you like a medusa
Can you please post a link to your ebay?
The Medusa piercing would look cool but just know if you would ever want to take it out that it will leave a very noticeable scar
Idk if you've had mouth piercings before, but I wouldn't  recommend it if you don't see yourself committed to it. Not that it wouldn't look good on you, but it can scar your face permanently
I'm so sorry for your loss 😔 I lost my rat Lewis a month ago, and I know his brother Boris doesn't have much longer left. It's horrible having to deal with type of stuff. Why can't animals just live forever you know? But anyways I'm sending good vibes your way ❤
Made a fortune appealing to the natural instincts of humans. Right on man
Hugh Hefner's last words: *Oh God, the flames, I''m burning!!!!!!*
He saw the goodness in others...helped so many people and animals...He was there with Tea, Sympathy, and Hospitality when one needed a Friend...!!
no matter how many women and how much money he had, he finally died.
Women are NOT sexual objects they are Human beings with feelings, talents and deserve to be treated with respect and not used for the pleasure of the Male Supreme.  They are the bearers of life, and the authors of Love and have a natural spirituality.  Women are to be loved and repected as the Nurtures of society, not used for the Male Supremacy that this world promotes.
DIRTY PEDOPHILE!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS CASE , RAPING 5YEARS OLD???????????????
Life is like you dip the tip of your finger in a cup of water and take it out,  all the money, all the girls, all his property, left behind, now he's in darkness alone he took nothing with him, except his deeds. Life is short, lets work for the after life instead.
So all of those scantily clad Playboy bunnies need a place to live now? And all that I need is a mansion??? And then they can all come and live with me and I'll be in heaven??? Thank you JESUS!
Hugh hefner died still an IMPERFECT MAN, seen as a pervert and just fully degraded woman..
Does anyone no about the hidden bunny on the cover you have to look hard to find it but I want to no is why and when it started my wife was reading a article in one of mine when she ask did you no about the Playboy Bunny hidden on the cover I said no she showed it it has a hint were to find it we stared looking every month one was hard a girl had blond hair they made the bunny with it this was around the same time China was on the cover can't recall if she was playmate I didn't get it for some time after but we went in the store every month to look for the bunny we were friends with the store owner they ask what we were doing we told they said it was ok just not to open or rip the plastic if it's a secret cool if not I'd like to no I'll keep looking
He destroyed to many families
His entire life is glamorized but people fail to mention how he treated his bunnies.
What a life! He boinked the hottest women on the world all his life and became rich doing so. He continued this until he was 91! Awesome! RIP.
This was created before he died
talk about revenge on the first chick who cheated
....it's hot down here.
A lot of the girls I've fallen in love with. What's love got to do with it? Orwellian dementia.
My daughter in law loved Hugh Hefner. He was a great business man. He showed people you can do anything no matter where they come from. He lived a great  lifetime
You Go Hugh. Singular man accomplishing great business.
RIP to the man
HIs life was all a lie. He may have had fame and money, but it was all a superficial.
Dad : What do you wanna grow up to be ?\nMe: Hugh Hefner.
This man is a great example of gain the whole world but lose your soul..
NOW!!!   How it all gets divvyed up!  Who gets what?  Lets play the Family Feud!
Man if only he knew that throught the world for more than 5 decades he was responsiable for the hapiness of a lot of  young men ... I myself was one who used to spend a lot of time in the rest room just reding playboy.
14:20 the ultimate Alpha males.
There is No Rest or peace for the unrepentant sinner. Only a fearful Judgment. God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that everyone believing in Him should not PERISH but have Everlasting life.

Well if he did make it to heaven.....then all the rest of us are safe when our time comes!
How many young men would look at his magazine and have unrealistic expectations for a woman especially after child birth. The world is a better place with him dead
He did all this to get back at his wife nice
The real moral of the story:\nFirst and foremost, a number of girlfriends are easier than one wife.
oddly i expect his empire is bancrupt ... but his reputation allowed him to survive in the last years ~
His work touched many people. And many people touched themselves.
I believe in exactly what Hughe Hefner believes in; something good, magical, and exciting, yet unconscious.
Watch America suddenly go into a new age of purity
The good ones always die too young.
So basically he got red pilled after rejection and cucked. And the rest is history
He Used women and in the end women used him....Karma.
Thanks for the good childhood memories❤️
Clint eastwood is going to be the next to go
No such things as the last words of Hefner! Ain’t a titty that will come out a bra that you can’t thank hugh.....
Hugh created a media empire that revolved around the objectification of women, and made it seem intellectual and hip to do so. We should not idolize him.
He died with a stiffy
Can anyone from these sick twisted comments politely explain to me how is this man an example or anyone's missed one? what is his legacy he left to YOU? HOW IN ANY WAY HE HAS SHOWED ANY GOOD THING TO THIS WORLD ?
Sadly, he is not in heaven with God.
I guess the bunnies aren't going to be playing Hop on Pop anymore.
He was so handsome
I like playgirl better than playboy
Hugh Hefner is the only person who can say 'I wasnt in it for the money' and I dont roll my eyes
I don't believe he was a nice guy
My mom was a playmate for a short time and was on that show playboy after dark this is sad I always wanted to meet this this Legend God Rest his soul
He was not a good man so he def is not going to heaven!! Not much of a loss.
If u guys can celebrate Hugh ... Let celebrate r kelly
R.I.P Hugh Hefner you will never be forgotten I got memories of watching girls next door since I opened my eyes 😚😭😭😭😭
Standing on the Sun.\n\nWomen are multi-taskers.\nThey could literally drive many cars on a busy motorway.\nThey've got tons of common sense.\nTheir demand for recogntion on the ground started with the Suffergettes. So why have they so much common sense then?\nIt's cause their Standing on the Sun. They give life to all.\nThey made our brains and activate them/peace with their shapley appearence, sensuality and inner strengths.\nAnd it's cause their standing on the sun it's why they have a hyper intel' and peace that powers and creates men who invents entertainments........For her of course.\nOh Maria.
No one can say that man is in a better place rn
Im SURE all those women just loved him for who he was....nothing to do with money and fame.
Hef was indeed on his own right a trailblazer breaking the taboos and moraes of American Society.He really set the standard and brought a relax element to Americans men and women alike there is only one Hef.
I can't help but wonder where you spend your eternity and did anyone tell you the sinners prayer in your old age or did they just like you for your money
Say Hi to John Holmes, let him know Ron Jeremy is taking care of unfinished business down here where he left off.  Rip playboy
HUGH HEFFNER HELD CIA  ,DEMON ,WORSHIPPERS AND A SATANIC PROMIS , AND SACRIFICE , OMG SACRIFICE TO THE DEVIL
Wait. This isn't Destiny 🤔
Let's see what the Word of God has to say about whoremongers like Hugh Hefner:\n\n_For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God._--Ephesians 5:5
Its not about hugh or me, its about connection
Jimmy Fallon should have died instead.
At least he  does not need Viagra to get stiff anymore.
He sold his soul to the devil.   What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul.
Rest in peace
polygamist pervert pedophile

What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\n- The Lord Jesus Christ
Life is just vanity and chasing after wind. But to lie that he was not into it for the money is untrue. May his soul RIP.
This guy is my God \nr.i.p Hef
Hugh's last words: Jesus, I want to ask for your......  uhhhhhhhh.  \nDon't worry, I hear it's a dry heat down there.  lol
He was a sexual predator,  used his money to control silly young women
Sexist pig! Ugh...
I really thought it would be Eureka
Good luck tho the Norwegian post service is slow even on the mainland
Norway squad, where ya at?
You know you live in Ny-Ålesund when you cheat on your wife and the whole town finds out about it
I'd say do the southern most town, but I imagine everyone's parents are brother and sister, and the place would be rampant with mental disability.
Love it that you roast everyone – even Newark 😂😂😂
Can you please make more videos every week
Hey, Long-Years-byen right?\n(Long year it's been)
I found one flight reference. I'm at peace now.
So Svalbard might not require a visa but in order to get there - I'm assuming you will need a transit visa via a third country to get there depending on your passport.
Fascinating video. Thank you for all of your hard work in making it!
I have a friend from Svalbard, hes fuckin' weird.
Whats the northernmost town? How depressed are they? Why havent they moved? And why am i still commenting!?
1:12 How the f**k is Murmansk a city with 300000 people a town
Omg my grandad did his military service in Murmansk in soviet times
You should have used a globe instead of a projection for this one
grise fiord, nunavut is the most northern town
Tromsø\nPronounced (bear with me, that ø is a vowel that doesn't occur in English) trohm-say (-ay has rounded lips)\nÅlesund\nPronounced Uh-lay-soond
I like that word stupid youtuber
Is there any internet there on that island?
Why would a Brit say that Edinburgh's the most northern town in the world? it's not even the most northern town in the UK.  I'm currently in Loch Ness, which is situated in Inverness, a whole city further north than Edinburgh.
Half as interesting is the mean cousin of wendover productions.
As a Canadian, i'm actually happy that you put up a picture of two tents in Alert and called it our northern most military settlement. Our military is useless.
Your transitions into the ad part are getting more creative...
I'm Norwegian and the way he pronounces the cities is hilarious😂
Okay, you STOOPID YOUTUBER...
Suomi mainittu torilla tavataan
The Starks liked this video
I live in Toronto, anyone else?
This video is stolen
Toronto the northernmost? I hope this was just a joke and no one believes that, the US has entire states north of Toronto (Washington, Montana and North Dakota).
i get rly annoyed by the way he pronounces tromsø
You're more sarcastic than informative
Why would a Brit say Edinburgh?
Does it have Internet
After seeing this video, I was really excited with story blocks free trial and went for it and from the impression I got in the video I would be able to download many clips over the next 7 days and try out this amazing platform, but just after downloading a half a dozen clips or so I got a message saying I have exceeded the limit of video I could download during the trail, this limit wasn't explicit in your video or after clicking the link. I would like to know if anything can be done about this and if I could continue downloading stock footage
It's not too-lay\n\nit's a th sound like when you say through then ool like tool
I’ve been to Ny-Ålesund
Only British people aren't retarded enough to think Edinburgh is the northernmost town.
You can just decided to move to Svalbard. You are required to have a job  if you wanna live there and you need a permanent address somewhere else. When you retire you have to move.
Not only did he call Edinburgh a town he didnt realise that there is civilization above it seriously?
How about what is the southernmost Town in the world?
The transition to that sponsorship was not boring at all. That's pure marketing.
Already trending on this channel..Big things are to come
Thank you for the video! Ive always wondered whats going on the northernmost part of the world..
because logic and sensibility does not exist in Russia...\n\nhuh. it'll be The Northenmost World in Town
I wanna move to svalbard.
If you ask an American, the northernmost town in the world is probably Toronto, Canada.\n\n\n\nLmfao
The humour is great, and that segway into the ad was flawless
I live in Longyearbyen !!
To my bucket list
I really do not think anyone in the UK thinks Edinburgh is the northern most town. Its not even a town. I live further a lot north than Edinburgh.
1:43 gives me a cool fact:\n\nLongyearbyen saw totality in the 2015 total eclipse on March 20, but the same year the town suffered an avalanche.
Its called Tromsoe in english i come from Tromsø
I'm just happy Norway got mentioned in something
Really? Toronto? Even just sticking with Canada's 3 largest cities, Vancouver is further north. So are Ottawa (national capital), Montreal (other of the 3 largest), most of the other provincial capitals, and all of the territory capitals.
... Or you can move there and become a stupid YouTuber 😂😂😂😂
I know this isn’t a “town”, but there is a Russian camp on the artic ocean, which is more further than Alert, Canada
all time time i thought the whole inverted shoe was Norway/Sweden/Finland \ndidn't know russia owned that part as well
Nice to see this on the trending list. More of this, please!
That Segway at the end tho 🤣
logic and sensibility doesn't exist in Russia. what in the fuck. am American, and fuck you
Hang on the most northern city in the uk would be Inverness not Edinburgh or even wick is further that Inverness??
Edinburgh? Edinburgh's about 2 hours south of me and there's still a lot of towns further north. No Brit would answer Edinburgh.
One of best video

Tomorrow I'm putting at least 15mn of deleted scenes on Patreon - and I will be quitting my Patreon campaign pretty soon. Last chance to jump on! http://www.Patreon.com/JoeGoes
Juggaloes are nice people, but they are really, really stupid. Seriously, I'm not joking, if you are open minded or a very accepting person. They are seriously lacking in intelligence generally speaking. Just listen to the music. It's unquestionably retarded. No one can or will challenge me on this. I am right. Goodbye retarded but nice juggaloes. Listen to someone smarter than you .
Honestly It's hypocritical ; they listen to horrorccore  rap which describes beheading people,  stabbing people, collecting heads, and murdering children yet they claim to be the nicest people on earth liker one big family, it's really stupid.half of these motherfuckers are obviously on hard drugs; yeah real great culture to raise your kids in :/. bTW looks like violent Jay lost a lot of weight ;)
Sounds like furries trying to justify their degeneracy.
It's all about love, acceptance, and family. Their Family.  I know some juggalos and I'm different from them and they ignore me or call me names for not agreeing with everything they do. I'm Disabled so it feels good to be hated for no reason.
Thank you for this joe.... I mean dad
Ruining my reputation by proving there are more literate juggalos than just myself?!  For shame!
That redhead kid just needs a friend
People don't even know what juggalettes and juggaloes even are. *Listens to what is a juggaloe by ICP. Well they sound like lovely people.
we love you, Joe.
Juggalos are cool people. One of the only people I kept in contact with after high school is a Juggalo. He doesn't drink, doesn't do drugs and works with at risk kids. He was one of the only people who had the balls to call me on my shit about my Heroin use. Went to the Gathering with him a couple years back, it was so much fun. I don't care for ICP, but most Juggalos are pretty decent people.
I got the Juggalo juice ! I still listen to the music,  such good fun , I'm down with the Clown ! 😂😂😍😍❤ Respect ICP😍❤
Juggalos are the weird kid in school, all grown up.
Fittest bunch up in the cut
Mankini makes it look like a gay pride parade and nope..it makes a joke of what juggalo was when I started..... Mne !!!
I am the Juz Bling. Thanks Joe!\nHere's some of my music!\nhttps://youtu.be/XkHx2Bewj9c
they're a bunch of fucking weirdos but at least they embrace it and roll with the stereotypes, bit of respect for that
Where the fuck you have been JOE?
‘The most diverse group of White people, you’ll ever meet’ LMFAO
so there has to be a reason for them being treated as a gang right? what did they actually do?
I BETTER BE IN THE FUCKIN' VIDEO
If you have a Hatchet on your car , you deserve to be pulled over.
Wow....the first time I heard of insane clown posse was back in 96’, s dude from my work was into them, I listened to them for 5 minutes and all they talked about was clown life and hacking up people ....I guess rapping about drugs and gang life is more tolerable....ISP is laughable and demented.
Have to say they seem like pretty nice folks.
You looked so done with that ginger dude haha!
9:52 I’m the guy in the back petting the dog
THIS GUY SOUNDS LIKE HE IS DEEP THROATING BLACK DICKS WITH A FIST UP HIS ASS
Joe made it on trending... Thats a start. .3.
Thank you for this upload joe
Why you have to get all political every time?
props for still makin quality vids even though all of them are basically demonetized
This is honestly one of the best darn videos I've ever seen on youtube. These jeffalos are so sweet and Joe is good at doing his program Joe Goes.
the juggalos seem a lot more rational than trumptards.
Someone please tell these people the difference between a hatchet and a meat cleaver
I could see LBJ being a Juggalo
TO THE JUGGALO at 1:54 what other fanbase has been discriminated like that? Oh Manson Fans got blamed for Columbine, Judas Priest got blamed and sued for those kids shooting their faces off with a shotgun, and Slayer fans get pretty much blamed for being satanists every day soooo stop bitching
8:07 Gabe has to go home.
I only know Joe as the normy who gets amongst the Ninjas. Legendary Buttery Mother Fucker.
the white retards matter movement is what this should be called. these people are the lowest of low life scum around. this music group should just tour the slum trailer parks of america because thats where their fans live. they are classified as a gang because of  its very common for them to act out like these examples: http://www.ranker.com/list/10-most-violent-juggalo-attacks-ever/michael-gibson    how many food stamp card holders do you think are in this march?
Icp trying to latch onto the victimhood movement... Grow the fuck up
Disliked because of the censorship. Fuck that.
Fsu has it just as bad same with sosf and courage crew
I'd love to see Joe in Wolfpac.
Can you go a video without spewing your liberal bullshit
Are you censoring your shit now because of Ads?
I love that Joe is now an official Juggalo celebrity. The look on his face as he slowly realises that these are his people now.
Damn. Joe is still making the same stuff huh. Persistence pays off I guess :)
17:36 one more to add to the outro?
The Juggalo stereotype: Dr. Pepper drinkin’, cigarette smoking, trailer park white trash fan base. I’m not a juggalo, but the fans have a strong sense of comradery and that’s chill...
All the trailer trash in one area but these are the other side of the trailer park people that voted for Hillary lol
Welp...seems like these guys aren't as bad as I originally thought...good interview/video and eye-opening. Kind of made me realize that I probably jumped to conclusions on these guys based off the actions of a few, something a lot of people probably do. This video also did a good job of somewhat humanizing them, rather than just looking at them like 'clown people who don't give a shit about anything'.\n\nHowever...is it just me or does their little running man symbol w/ the hatchet look like it was based off a swastika? \n\nAnyways, like them or not, America is about being able to express yourself freely, and these guys sure as fuck are doing that! \n\nCool video.
i like juggalo ron weasley, but he really needs to get laid
I would like to know the occupations of these people
Joe congrats you made it to the trending page!
We're not a gang. I'm a mom. Lost it.
A lot of these people are fucking stupid they want Trump out
Oh my god this is trending!!!!
Juggalos might seem odd to us, but I think that the vast majority of them are good people
I went to high school with Mankini, and he has always been a warm-hearted, kind, and generous guy.
Next episode: Joe Goes to Censorship
Can't wait to see ginger guys comments in the comment sections lmao
best video of urs
Never clicked on a video so fast in my life
It's nice to see the media on our side for once\n\nThey aren't.  They're against Trump.  Don't confuse their opposition to Trump with their support of Juggalos.
Bunch of losers
Wtf are these inbreds on about
RAP LOL
I like juggalos now?
Holy shit those motherfuckers still exist
3:05 whoop whoop
Bring back the flickering text!
11:30

Joes Goes To Alt-Right Rally
Am i the only one that thinks joe goes has gotten worse
I want to make a movement, it's going to be called suckthedick movement. Were accepting female applications only.
Hey Rhett & Link, I know this will get lost in the comments but, I just want to say I really appreciate this specific Wheel of Mythicality. I am Puerto Rican and while I live in Massachusetts I have quite a few family members who live in down there, including my grandfather from my dads side. He was hospitalized a week ago with an infection in his leg and because of the lack of medicine and resources the infection spread and they're gonna have to amputate it. You guys always put a smile and my face even in hard times and the fact that you guys take a moment to acknowledge and help those in need makes, me love you guys even more. From the bottom my heart, thank you, and you make me want to be my mythical best!
I've heard of Jojo's, but I know them as potato wedges, not cookies.
You can feed orgainic pumpkin puree to dogs for tummy aches and to get more fiber in their diet :)
Thank you guys for your support for Puerto Rico. My family there is safe but theres millions in despair with no food, water and shelter. GRACIAS, DIOS LOS BENDIGA!!!! Q VIVA GMM!!!!!!
Plain pumpkin is great for dogs actually. It helps with constipation and other GI discomfort. Ask your vet for the right proportion for yours, but mine was always a Tbsp per 50 lbs. Dog ate it like a treat and within a few hours no more crying fur baby. Just do NOT use the spiced can version, only the original pumpkin purée.
My teacher had us watch one of your sea animal videos and it was awsome
pumpkin flavored dog treats?  even the  dogs are taking part in pumpkin spice everything....lol
I have not watched GMM in forever and that new intro shocked me
Hey mythical crew, you guys rock and are one of the main reasons gmm is such a great thing; without your skills and everything you do on and off camera the show wouldn't have the same quality, emotions, and vibes. Keep it up guys and don't  get discouraged by rude people that forget they are insulting real people and are not aware of everything you guys do.
I don’t see the problem with the crew laughing
My god. I love Rhett and link but my respect for them just went way down. As an almost fluent Spanish speaker, I am offended that they got tortilla, the whitest Spanish word, wrong. if you do not know  the Spanish alphabet, the double L sounds like a Y.
Rhett:That's Good |Link:That's Bad | Link: Oooh, it gets better!
not everything pumpkin flavored has pumpkin spice in it.
They seem amped in this episode. Something's different--are they fighting?  Hope not...
Thank you so much for donating to  the maria disaster in puerto rico im really gratefull as im puerto rican but live in the U.S but i have family in puerto rico so thank you #levatandopuertorico
We like the laughing
How many oldest biggest coffee pots could possibly have been competing for that award. Haha. Like really what a specific thing.
Thank you for donating $1000 to Puerto Rico I have family there and my dad lost his garage roof, and Link was not wearing that GMM shirt the the whole time
They have pumpkin spice cream cheese. Not Trader Joe's though lol.
Was that a JoJo reference?
I actually like the laughters. Makes it feel more real. Less planned.
Here in the netherlands, we don't have that flavor so i've never tried it😬.\nI'm so curious about it though, what do you guys think??
coffe ice cream is the best
Do Will it Parfait? Like if you agree...
They have pumpkin spice pop tarts that are amazing, fail for not including! 👎🏻
Sorry guys, I don't often turn off a GMM video, but the crew shouldn't laugh every time either Rhett or Link open their mouths. It's very distracting, at least turn them down in the mix
My mom and her husband just makes me feels weird...
Is that a jojo's reference?
My mom bought so many of the pumpkin things at traders Joes... I laughed at her when she showed all of them.
Watching this on Yom Kippur and I'm starving to death
During taste tests, Link is always high on something.....
Thank you for this funny video!
Rhett's hair is the most mythical thing on the set. Man his hair is beautiful
Link was NOT wearing that GMM shirt the entire time. LOL.
Admit it, who else looked back to see if link was wearing the shirt before?
u r from NC and u don't know what apple butter is?  Yuppie LOL
I'm new to this channel is there people laughing in the background??and why?
you should try to figure out the best brand of vanilla ice cream !!!
You guys should do a will it tamale!
Pumpkin ice cream from traders joes is the best
Great way to wake up laughing!
Dogs do eat pumpkin it is very good for them. Give them canned pumpkin for tummy troubles especially BTW...if anyone cares to know....
I'm only mad that they didn't do the pumpkin cereal
The pumpkin dog treats is for dogs who are constipated haha! It should be a regular thing in the pet area
Actually I like when the crew laughs
i immediately started clapping when they announced that they were donating the money to help people in puerto rico.
i LOVE the crew and all... but I do have to agree the laughs got a little annoying
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Everyone in the comments: The crew should stop laughing at funny things gOD\n\nMe: * laughs at everything Rhett and Link say *
I have never had any pumpkin spice product nor have I had any trader joes product.
They make all sorts of pumpkin based dog treats, and I think they purposely don't make the pumpkin noticeable.\n\nI get them for my rabbits, because the treats are vegan (bunnies don't eat meat) and full of stuff rabbits can have in moderation. They often come in fruit flavors, like apple, blueberry and banana.\n\nBut I think advertising the dog treatsas a pumpkin treat for fall is a gimmick. I suspect the treats taste the same. The pumpkins blend in with the rest of the flavors.
I broke my foot at my football game
Dogs actually love pumpkin and some added to their dog food helps harden poops if your dog is having the runs 😁 it's also just good for them in general if given the right amount
=idek=
no Link dogs eat pumpkins my grampa gives his dog buddy canned pumpkin everyday
OMFG 666DISLIKES!!!! AM CURSED!!
isnt it that dogs shouldnt eat pumpkin? Or is it pumpkin seeds? :/

I wonder if a pallet cleanser between tastings would have affected the level of pumpkin spice detected.  It's possible the flavor on the dog biscuits and other stuff was lost from some of the other stuff they had already eaten.
Aww.. you guys left out my favorite pumpkin item, the pumpkin cereal bar!
I don't like mint chocolate chip ice cream but LOVE pumpkin spice
Dose anybody else think why is Rhett not in the thumbnail it's always likn
i love pumpkins i love the smell of pumpkin spice. but i hate the taste unless its in a pie or in frozen yogurt is anyone with me🎃🎃🎃
Went out and bought the Joe Joes after watching ... yum!
You can give pumpkin to a dog for constipation
Is it me or was link rushing and being kinda rude?
I like your intro
Thanks for donating to UNICEF. Talk about being your mythical best!
Glad you are all making money and stuff.... But just stop. Let this show be a good thing, before it turns into desperate.
So terrible to talk about cows like their lives mean nothing. The science is in: meat-eating is not sustainable. It's ruining our planet with methane, animal waste run-off and tailing ponds (see Barcelona's drinking water problem), resource depletion, and deforestation (40% of crops in the US are grown JUST to feed livestock). There are plenty of tasty, cruelty-free alternatives and absolutely no excuse to stick to a tradition that is pointless and harmful to this planet. And before you even mention health aspects, learn some basic biology (e.g. how proteins are formed, what essential nutrients are, how vitamers are metabolized) before looking like an uneducated fool.
The donation was so nice 😭💓💓
Why do I get the feeling that that was the ONLY roadside coffee pot in America...
That pumpkin butter is basically ginger butter. It’s disgusting.
5:45 My dog was on a pumpkin only diet for a while for medical reasons, so yeah, dogs eat pumpkin.
They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy, but we go where we want to. Anyone? No? No one gets the reference?
puerto rico is not a country..
I don't know why people are complaining about the crew laughing in fact to me and all of my friends it makes it feel Lively not just two people commentating it gives it a more TV show feel I like it and I think they shouldn't stop them from laughing
A piece of me died when Link tore open the pumpkin bagel bag instead of opening from the top!
2:05 - can you research greek-yogurts-popularity-is-harmful-to-the-environment please?
I appreciate crew laughter
I feel completely indifferent towards pumpkins 😂
Boring
EMMA CHAMBERLAIN DID THIS!
Yaaaaas bring back RANKED
Dogs eat pumkin it's  good for them
Rhett: Thats good\nBatman: Thats bad
GIMME ALL THE PUMPKIN!!!🎃🎃🎃🎃
It's Halloween!!! 2spoopy4me
Try the trader joe’s pumpkin pop tarts
Wow. Trader Joe sure likes pumpkins!
I love pumpkin pie. I despise pumpkin spice. It tastes nasty.
I love that they’re helping the people of Puerto Rico, nothing but respect for my presidents
My mo makes pumpkin soup out of pumpkin butter along with some extra spices and it's sooooooooooooo good.
10:56 Not really...\nNext episode tho, then they got high...
All of Link’s dinks today were so aggressive
My mom's husband \nyou mean your dad?  lmao
Haha, they're so comfortable with each other :) A great episode!
Crew please
Hi subscrbe
Stay in yøur lane bøy
Tony hijo de tu puta madre ferguzon
https://youtu.be/eHmbO6s1DmU
Damn tony keeping his composure . That's dope
Just one wicked Werdum knee on T-Ferg’s chin and he’s done like Lombard, when Hendo put his lights out...
I'll pay for that wall and build it with my own hands! Tony Ferguson
Hey have fun fighting on my under card LOL end of battle.
Since he appeared in TUF he showed he was a piece of crap
Werdum said conor would tee off on you
Thought Ferguson handled himself well.
Go agent smith
Cabron hahahhaha i like his Spanish
Fabricio is a slimeball .
Smelly Brazilian like his country..
tony carayusen
Werdum's jealous of Ferguson's gourmet green juice.
subtitles would be good
Fabricio 110 kg Tony 70 kg.
Tony made werdum take a few steps back when he stood up
What i'm trying to say is... What I'll like to say is... hahaha
I'll ankle pick you...that was funny.
dont mess with brazilians or they will pull out your teeth! 😂👊
Werdum can kill Ferguson in a 10 seconds
wtf is tony talking about.. he doesnt like people who dont run as hard as him and those who didnt give him ice for an ice bath?
El cucuy 😍😜👹
Kkkkk
Its impossible not to like Werdum
Stfu werdum.. Or Stipe will come there and crash u like a blob
Damn! Tony's Spanish is awful!!! Werdum is such a tool! I hope Lewis KO  him the fudge out!!!
Lol i think the mistake is in the interviewer\nWhy they interview both guy in the same place with different question and camera lol
lol ankle pick werdum? werdum would crush your throat in a heartbeat
Hahah Werdum picking a fight in 3 languages
Fergie ferg trying to hype himself like mcgregor does. Cringy.
Cara como eu ri do Werdum,isso é homem de verdade lutador por isso  que gosto dele kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
CÚ DE CACHORRO KKKKKKKKKKKKKK
tony dark matter ferguson
maybe cos Tony cutting 30lbs while Werdum can eat popeyes with DC cos he got 265lbs allowance
Why is Tony Ferguson is built like Crash Bandicoot? lol
1:18 Ferguson to Werdum: Shut up before I ankle pick you!!\n\nYea good luck with that homie. \nLmfao
Werdum is right...Tony is different in front of camera...
Tony Fergunson is a great fighter.\nBut he acted like a douchebag on this one. He was the one who idiotically provoked this beef.
Sou fã do werdum mano! Kkkkkk ele é sinistro!
Tony is a G.Real
Ferguson pau no cu do carajo!!!
Animo cukuy Ferguson
Tony Ferguson💪💪 goat
Fabricio bad energy werdum
Werdum would kill tony...
Ferguson=Honeybadger\n\nWerdum=Tiger
If you look close...Tony Ferguson has bigger hands than Werdum WTF???
why does verdum say i dont like bisping all the time
hold on I'm talking brother -- what a preppy, street thing to say. Some elements of hood in here.
Tony vs Werdum could have happened in the old UFC days.
I didn't know Kev is Mexican?!
If Werdum can beat Cain, he can easily swat Tony around.
Tony really trying to be Conor 😂
Verdum is a coward picking I fight with a smaller fighter
So what got in Werdums panties? Dude was more trigger then anything ive seen in awhile.
Tony is so Bs, he not even could make a point on the interview   After almost got crushed by Verdun, super funny 🤣🤣
he's channeling conor..lol.....why not.
LOL  I doe say nutin cause I'm heavy weight oh no
I don't like fake people coming from ferguson is the biggest irony ever
We're gonna just pretend like Werdum didn't just try to cut him off mid sentence?
That douche
Weight classes, judges, ppv ruin the UFC
É isso aí werdum. Acabá com esse cu de cachorro kkkkkkk
Tony Black Energy Ferguson
Whoa tony, easy man, thats werdum, the guy that subbed fedor and tuned up and subbed cain.
Kayate tu puta madre and he even didnt stand up wtf
Wolf tix
hehehehehehehehe
...tu puta madre maricon , hahaha, priceless!!!
have fun fighting on my undercard.    -Ferguson.
I think verdum has a ADHD problem, this guy is not matured
Ferguson doesn't think he's fake? He has one of the most affected, uncomfortable, personalities in the UFC. Everything about him is fake
Tony doesn't know how to speak Spanish
Tony looked like  a hobbit next to verdum. I like Ferguson and hope he wrecks Kevin Lee.
werdum would kill him in 10 seconds
Werdum picks on smaller guys to make himself feel better for that 1st round KO loss to p4p king #stiopic #immigrantmentality
Hahaha Ferguson is out of his mind. He looks stressed out for some reason, werdum can probably brake his arms and put him in coma in seconds.
Now I want to watch Kevin Lee and Derrick Lewis to win their fights for sure.
why did tony say that thing about kicking werdums ass there mustve been some background story here
Werdum would of killed his ass
I would have to go with werdum whooping his ass
Someone tell me what werdum was saying  please
I EMBRACE THE CRINGE GOD TONY
Haha one light jab from werdum and he would be asleep 😂 😂
Tony Ferguson vs Kevin Lee, the battle of the the Cringe. Who will take the cringey  throne and become the cringest of them all?
Hes lucky hes in the main event at ufc 216 .
Like sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives.
These 2 idiots using the word maricon ( gay) as an insult in 2017....then they try to portrait MMA (which i am a fan for over 8 years now)  the UFC\n and their fighters like a sport ...omfg
It's good to know a little fame won't go to Tony's head...
UFC fans should go back too WWE.\nWAAAAAAH WAWAWA WAAAAH beta
Poker player vs Real Brazilian champ...hmmm)
aiai.. sou brasileiro...\n\ne achei a atitude do Werdum uma grande babaquice, tão ruim quanto à do outro idiota chamado Ferguson.\n\nComo dizia o poeta: o inferno e o cemitério estão cheios de valentões...'
Ferguson se acha a estrela... só que não ...
So Ferguson says he'd kick Werdums ass if he had to. Werdum gets offended and mouths off. Then Ferguson plays the victim by saying Werdums trying to fight a small 155 pounder? I'm giving this one to Werdum.
Tony u not even close to what verdum has achieved..SFU
Lets's translate this
Werdum switched to Spanish to Portuguese real quick! Guy is truly gifted with speaking all these different languages at one time lol
That idiot should learn how to speak English  stupid no respect   have some class and be civilised  you stupid puta   English English English if you can't speak English don't speak rubbish lol lol lol looser
Do an honest trailers for the UK inbetweeners
in all fairness the mark twain performance turned into an award winning one man show and apparently was pretty spot on to the actual man as far as historians and people that knew him can say
do buffy the vampire slayer (tv show)
YES. Being civilized is boring. I think you named the next Star Trek series when Discovery gets cancelled.
How did I never notice the Riker maneuver???
That is SO true about Worf...to be a bad ass Klingon he sure got his ass kicked a lot. I do call bs on battleship though.
Damn you, you just made me realize that Patrick Stewart was basically shouldering the whole show by himself.
I never met a chocolate I didn't like...\n\nTROI!
Say Damn it Jim!! I'm a doctor, not a voice actor!
Jordi Laforge became the Reading Rainbow guy I love it I love it I love it take a look inside upper Reading rainbow 📖🌈
what is 3:37 from? ty god bless
Guys I am so happy you did this one!!! TNG so deserves that!
..and the answer is sisko!
I might just watch this for the concerts
That was simply hilarious! Well done Screen Junkies!
You must do the X-Files.
They're never done a single tarentino movie
Please say Hi id like to order a Slam with extra Jam please
Babylon 5 Honest Trailer! So much you can do with it!
you really did  a lot of work with this one. Great job! I too hadn't noticed Riker maneuver
3 t-mobile commercials in one 8 minute video
Obviously its picard! And they couldve done the whole show without counselor troy.
You guys should do an honest trailer for Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments next, that would be greatly appreciated
When I first saw it, I thought it was a comedy show.
Next Generation was my least favorite of all of the shows. Most of the characters were based on characters from the first series....Spock was divided three ways between Worf, Data and the Psycho lady, Ryker was Kirk lite. The original Star Trek often had award-winning sci fi writers doing episodes whereas NG was essentially typical TV writers of the time period. The Psycho lady spent way too many times explaining why she ate chocolate whenever she was upset, Worf spent way too many times explaining Klingon culture and losing fights and how many times could Data sty something that had never worked before....but if the cosmic sub megaton defibrillator untensed the quantum flux hiccups at just the right intensity without waking up the giant space warthog, then it just might work and save the ship from an otherwise undefeatable threat? How many times was that card played? And I stillc irnge just thinking about Data with his emotion chip singing about life forms.
Im curious anybody who hasn't watched Star Trek TNG did this trailer make you more or less likely to watch it?
please say Spying is for the weak. I stare defiantly, at the ice cream truck.
MY CHILDHOOD! I was so happy you included Riker climbing over chairs. 😂 And hey, I like the one where they turn into kids!
Capt. Picard the most British French man in the galaxy, ah I do miss Star Trek TNG, man did worf get his ass kicked he did his duty alright.
3:34 -  Rust Never Sleeps is my favorite Neil Young album too.
how about doing one about deep space 9 next since you started on star trek series
Love this. Was enjoying it considerably until 6:54 - At which I chuckled heartily. \nThen they called out the The Picard Maneuver and I blew my lid - spewed my tea (Orange Pekoe, Sorry) all over the computer. F#@*ing brilliant. This channel is awesome.
holy hell...i never noticed ricker doing that before now
Honest trailer do keeping up with the Joneses!!
4:55 I forgot Troy was first and foremost the eye candy.
Did anyone else stop at 4:54 to check out Troy's nips?
Say: I LIKE TRAINS!
This was the best thing ever
I love Star Trek Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager:). Captain Picard was my favorite Star Trek Captain.  However,  my favorite Character was Seven of Nine on Voyager. The Borg Episodes with Seven of Nine including Scorpion were the absolute best:).
The future is woke is my favorite new thing to say. Here's to hoping it is.
Say Brought to you by AT&T, now Netflix has included, another reason why AT&T is America's best unlimited network

How did I never see the ghost episode?
Why did they Yamcha Warf like that?
Can u do a honest trailer on Shadow Hunters?
Yeah yeah, we've been trying to forget season 7's Sub Rosa for decades now. That's just cruel to make us remember! In it's defense, it's the one time they made the lightning green! The worst is still Dark Page or Masks IMO. In fact the 1st, 2nd and 7th seasons should be scrapped. I did love Parallels though...
this is like the best thing i've ever watched
Frames gets a pass he has a back injury that makes sitting down the normal way painful he kind of straddles chairs.
TNG is even more awesome than you remember and you didn't even mention half the things you could have made fun of.
Lt Commander Data, an android, who drops being an android into conversations, like your friend who just became a vegan\n\nSo true. My friend became a vegan and couldn't make two complete sentences anymore without mentioning the fact he's an android.
The first two ST:D episodes recap: totally batshit crazy, incompetent and mentally unstable idiots engage in bitching, moaning and dieing in space.\n\nEven TNG code of honor had better plot and acting.\n\nCGI was top notch though...
Say  dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives.

I was worried before watching this. What if they will now try to sound like the sellouts in the charts? But they didn't, they still sing what they feel. What I like the most is that they actually changed while still keeping the spirit. After all, I have heard 100 traditional u2 songs, it's time for something different! Keep it up, I like it that way!!! :)))
Larry has to be the most focused drumer in rock and roll.  No showboating or headbanging, his playing speaks for itself.
I didn't like the song first time I heard it, but it's grown on me and now I sing it in the shower, I sing it in the car....you're the best thing about me!
*What a fucking nice looking video!*
classic..☺
Thank for thes great song. U2
Shocking song! Didn't buy the last album doubt Il buy this one!
I really don't like this video. I get it, on the face of it. But I don't like it. And for all the charms, in particular from Bono...I don't get the charms.\nThe song I'm not sure about. Songs Of Innocence is great cuz it couldn't not be, but it's also near the bottom of the canon. I hope this album doesn't follow that direction, because waiting years for a U2 album means I should get something in the top 5.
I love this song but why does Larry look so miserable all the time? :-(
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
excellence,this song is melodic not disappoint
U2 is the best thing abt me
FINALLYYY U2 IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST THING I HEARD FROM YOU IS SONG FOR SOMEONE, RAISED BY WOLVES, CALIFORNIA, THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN REACH ME NOW, ETC.\n\n\nI LOVE U GUYS SO MUCH AND YOUR MUSIC! :DD

I'm digging the song. But honestly,  that video sucked.
Have they forgotten they're Irish?
Looks like predictive programming about the NEO 9-11 in Babylon the Great > the complete destruction of NYC under an upcoming full moon...  U2 saying goodbye and walking away b4 the illuminated event?  In your face!

Yes, I am a fallen angel.. This is my highway to hell death sentence prison i fell into.. I deserve the lake of fire.. I am a prodigal son.. i preexisted my upside down flesh snake skin birth.. my free will was in heaven my home i fell from.. I followed Lucifer here for prostitution and riotous living..By Grace through faith in Jesus Christ I am converted turned upside down again reconciled pardoned adopted and going back home to heaven.. I await the redemption of my body ... relationship not religion .. Lucifer runs all governments and religions.. NYC is about to die
Great song, terrible video
Who knows where the bar and the Harley Quinn looking bartender is? That looks like my kind of joint!
Sounds like a Coldplay song
What an annoyingly unwatchable video!!!
bunk
Terrible.
U2 exposed as a bunch of libtards. No thanks.
This is amazing advice but it's very situational. Don't do this with a narcissist, or anyone who is emotionally immature. In both childhood and adulthood I've expressed when I'm hurt to my parents, and their immediate reaction was denial, rejection and gas-lighting. Rarely will they apologize and soften up. My mother, who adores being the victim in any circumstance, can never bring herself to a proper apology, it is always I'm sorry you misinterpreted what I said to anyone and everyone.... If you practice this with these type of people, it can draw up a lot of resentment and make it harder to open up (or be open) to someone who is genuinely emotionally there for you. So yes, good advice, but be careful. The supportive and emotionally vulnerable girlfriend is not always the reaction. Sometimes she'll lash out and say you're making her out to be the villain.
My only qualm:\n\nI know it's stupid, but...\n\nNo. It's not stupid to feel unimportant when you're trying to have a conversation about something that matters to you with someone that matters to you. It's not stupid to feel hurt or to ask to have just a moment of their undivided attention😕
*I want to address the line: I have a big ego by asking you for your attention, forgive me.* Asking someone for their attention doesn't mean you have a big ego, it simply means you want to connect. If said person has abruptly stopped conversing with to play Candy Crush or Facebook, that is fine, you can leave them be and have the conversation another time or you can ask them for their attention. _I feel that should be said. if you think I am wrong then by all means, critique me.
We can't control someone elses reactions. Sometimes even explaining calmly doesn't get us the support we need, it doesnt always work that way and to be honest he sounded very apologetic. Sometimes people will explode or find things offensive no matter how calmly we state our point.
Well the girl chatacter is kind of a bitch in this one
I love this channel. One of the most insightful places on YouTube in my opinion.
I dunno about this one.  Sure, communicate better and you can avoid patterns of these types of interactions before the relationship deteriorates in the first place.  But, that first segment looks more like negative sentiment override where neutral behavior is interpreted as criticism and each party is basically waiting to attack or be defensive.  Showing vulnerability at that point may not do much to improve interactions between people who no longer feel fondly for each other.
It feels like you're just rehashing old videos under vaguely different titles... time for something new to get this channel back up and running again
When you're a loner but still watch this shit carefully just in case one day someone loves u back and you end up in a relationship
Narcissistic Personality Disorder - Love to see a video on that one - a nightmare condition.
Why am I watching videos about devonping a good relationships when I've never had a relationship and will never get one?
I just watched it with my Girlfriend to see if there is something new that we could apply in our relationship. We were so happy to realize that we already act like this. Unfortunately we realized that a lot of people we know do not.
These videos are pretty bad lately.. terrible acting
thank you . this came at the perfect time
I break up usually
What is the background music?
It's so like us..even the topic of conversation
I feel like dealing with the pain of being alone is much easier than dealing with the pain (and annoyance, and stupid bullshit) of being in a relationship.
men have pride ,women have harsh-head ,nothing would work except long time arguing to relieve the stress .... arguing is a solution to say everything you want to say
As a woman, I find vulnerability in men almost invariably attractive. Many feel so much pressure to be stoic or strong that it feels hard to get to know the real person within. So revealing weakness to me feels like a gesture of trust, which I find ultimately flattering. (Egocentric motivation, I suppose 😏 at least in part) I am slow to trust, so the vote of confidence means worlds to me.\n\nHowever, I will admit there are caveats: \n1. When someone has hurt me very badly, and they express guilt or shame upon releazing my hurt, I do feel somewhat satisfied and take pleasure in their pain, but only to the extent that I feel it evens the score (no more than I hurt for no longer than I hurt). This is only in extreme situations.\n2. ‎When people use a facade of honesty as an excuse for being an asshole or venting raw emotion carelessly without any effort towards tact or self-restraint. (Basically launching a personal attack under the guise of just being honest.)\n3. ‎When I feel their expressing hurt is actually a tale of woe aimed at manipulating my emotions intentionally to make me feel sorry for them and reduce their culpability. Or if I notice that particular person seems to have a pervasive victim mentality, even if they are not consciously aware of it. This is frustrating. Taking responsibility is key.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, I can deal with sadness quite well, but not anger. Anger antagonizes, whereas sadness invites empathy.
Naturally, it goes both ways. If someone courageously admits that he/she felt hurt, then you should properly and eagerly listen to them without hitting back.
first time clicking on this, i thought it was gus johnson in the thumbnail........................................................
I've always wonder at The School Of Life is this advice to help everyone no matter where we are in life. Wether you are a 14 year old in the states or a 23 year old attending college are you all makerting to every person?
I see myself in this.
which one of yall read the monologue in the narrator’s voice
is it ok if i show that i'm hurt, angrily?
hey how does the rest of the calmer discussion end???
Unless you're dating a sociopath as they will use any vulnerability you show against you.
I like how they learn to communicate better on this one thing, then argue about something else afterwards. It seems realistic to point out that this will not end all conflict.
of course he’s right, it’s very disrespectful
What should someone do if a fight starts based on your confession about being vulnerable? When your partner instead of just accepting your vulnerability wants to go deeper and this makes you feel under judgement? He just wants to understand, but i just want to be accepted and these questions especially when i am trying to fight my anger seem so inappropriate for that moment
I can not relate to someone who takes out their cellphone before a conversation is over. It's phenomenally rude. That cellphone is going in the toilet.
You know what? The second way of reacting sounded much stronger than the first, childish one. Remaining calm feels like a very both empathic and confident person.
Crying is not just for infants.  Haven't you ever experienced a scene in a movie where an adult cries?  Yes, even adult men... especially men.  It's very moving.  Crying gets you in a different place than the part of your brain that is trying to protect YOURSELF...now you feel protective (compassionate) toward the other person.\n\nAlso, some people below had questions about how to express that someone is hurting you, in a work context.  Here is what I have seen, and does not make the person look weak:  Say, Ouch.  That's it.  Then quickly move on.  There isn't time for the person you are speaking to,  to mount a counter-attack; they might even be slightly confused (they didn't realize the stupidity/insensitivity of what they were saying).  But later they will think back at what they said (because you said Ouch) and they'll get it.
Its hard to identify when the people in the video are so annoying.
School of Life do you not realize that the lashing out and insulting behavior IS how people show thier hurt? What you are advocating isn't showing people you are hurt but rationally explaining why they feel hurt. Reveling in your negative emotions leads to negative responsess, like insults and attacks. You can not explain to another person why you feel hurt unless you know why yourself. This means taking a moment,  stepping back and examing your emotional state. In this video, in your positive example, the man explains to  the woman why he is hurt he doesn't show it. Most animals lash out after they have been hurt, the hardest part is stopping yourself from that behavior,  and this video does nothing to help with that part.
I tried scenario two once and got told to not be such a baby, y e a h, that's doesn't work either.
This shit doesn't work. They will tell you to get over it, a partner that cares about you doesn't do shit they know will upset you unless it is unavoidable.
I wish it were that easy. I'm glad sometimes it is. It should be our first line of defense. It seems though that there are people who watch for that kind of thing to use it. Sociopaths. And if you are with them, well I just don't know if there's any good way to deal with someone who eats off of your vulnerability. Who waits for it and hopes for it to use it against you. \n        I guess if you get a healthy person this is the best way. But if you were predisposed, trained to be in defective relationships from childhood, well it's a bit more complicated. But not to be given up on.... it's just going to take more time and focus to fix all the backwards stuff you were trained to accept.
Yeah. It doesn't work in today's fearful/narcissistic society. It doesn't work. Show your hurt, women leave. Show your hurt, men take advantage of it.
Great acting / depiction of real couple arguments
Sometimes I want angry make up sex, not apologetic tender sex.
Not working for me.... a person keeps hurting me and refusing to talk to me. No matter if I tell her I'm hurt or if I get mad. She just doesn't care. And I care for her so much. She's my sister, so it's not like I'll ever walk away from her. What can I do but just hurt silently? Addressing what's hurting you isn't always the answer because sometimes the person really is selfish and they aren't going to care.
JACK HOWARD IS IN IT. I SAW THE THUMBNAIL AND COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!!! <3
He should have just got up and turkey slapped her....
Mind what you say. Words, like bullets, cannot be taken back.
Jack Howard!?! How'd I find you all the way over here?
Hello from Colombia. What about a video of schizophrenia? Causes, treatments and related things? Blessings from Sincelejo.
Jack Howard was a great choice for this video! : )\n\nI think most people are afraid if they show vulnerability, they will be mocked or hurt further. This is a good response to those fears. <3
Being lone is the best the way to avoid these problems.
Beautifully acted. Gave me an anxiety attack.
I wish you would do a video about someone trying to break their habit of being toxically submissive.The kind of quiet self restraint that helps no one in the end.
Ironic how they’re watching Germany Vs. Brazil 😂😂😂🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣
Omg Jack Howard and School of Life crossover. Worlds colliding! 🌏
I lost someone I loved with all my heart when instead of being kind when I felt hurt by him, and explaining this to him nicely, I decided to lash out at him. I lost him. Lesson learned...entirely too late, though. 😞
Jack! I'm super pleased to see you.
I feel like relationship advice from The School of Life represents how ideal people in the ideal world SHOULD behave, rather than useful advice to be used in the real world with real people.
One should sacrifice if you want to understand each other
How do you handle it when you show hurt and they respond by mocking you? Let's also assume that, for the sake of having a real conversation, they are not evil monsters. They just have a difficult time taking emotions and related conversations seriously.
That's not Jim, that's Jack Howard.
What a good acting
FUCK that! She needs to listen! If he goes and finds someone else who will listen, then he's somehow wrong! GTFOH WITH THAT BULLSHIT! 😐
School of life please make more videos to enhance our emotional intelligence. The world is not kind:(
3 hours ago I had the same thing with my partner \nAt first I was angry and we argued about stupid things for half an hour\n \nBefore we go to bed he saw how sad i was and asked me in such a deep kind way  why are U upset   did I hurt you? \n\nAnger always makes things worse.
URGENT QUESTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Is your voiceover guy the same voiceover guy from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?! They sound the same!!!!!!!!! :o
question: does this have something to do with bad parenting ?
The parallel the guy showed vulnerability by expressing how he was hurt? Well, the “bad” parallel to the “good” parallel would have been if she wasn’t acknowledging and accepted that she hurt him. Sometimes, if you tell someone that they hurt your feelings and how they hurt you, they’ll deny their part and blame you for being “too sensitive/emotional” or “I shouldn’t have to walk around eggshells around you” translation,”I have to think about what I say to you before I say it. I don’t want to be respectful of your thoughts and feelings.” or “Then, I must be the monster or the bad guy.” After, they’ll entice you to fight or argue back with them so they don’t feel like they’re the only monster or bad guy, thus they will push you to say something just as cruel or malicious so they feel they are on equal footing. “Now we’re both hurt, so you can’t say shit else.”
Jack, fancy seeing you here.
LOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLL because this how my arguing starts

Jack Howard ye
I'll tell you exactly what happens when you reveal your emotions to most women:  Awww, man up.  If there's one thing most women in my life couldn't handle its listening to men's emotions, they don't matter and they have the nerve to call US the whinebags at the slightest sign of complaint.
And what happens when you tell your partner he hurt you, but he continues to do the same, and then blame you for feeling hurt and angry?
I did that and she said I am not man enough and broke up.
I'm autistic and even I realise that getting out your phone while someone is trying to talk to you is offensive.  How does that make his ego fragile? Would the  women be fragile if the roles were reversed?\nPlease explain.
This sounds great but, my wife would call me a pussy if I showed my feelings. In fact she has before.
To be quite honest, I'm confused about how emotional intelligence is any different from intellectual intelligence-isn't rational thinking (essentially the type of thinking being endorsed here) a type of intellectual intelligence readily captured in existing IQ tests? We acknowledge that there is some kind of emotional disturbance, but choose to suppress or ignore it for the sake of rational thought and behavior. How is this type of thought different from the type of thinking required to decide to pull a train track switch to save 5 people instead of doing nothing and saving one?
I could be crying my eyes out and my husband wouldn't bat an eye. I hate that narcissist
So, pay Amazon to watch you have sex?
Amazon wants camera and mic in every room of the house

Great job CIA 😀👌🙌🎆🎉🔥
hi i'm Casey, and this is 90 seconds on the verge
Typo at 0:48
Great now the NSA can see me sleeping !!
I want this as a center console in a Mini Cooper
Now they can see me while having sex
The Amazon Echo looks like a rip-off of the Bonjour Alarm Clock...\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1450781303/bonjour-smart-alarm-clock-with-artificial-intellig
You all are a bit paranoid about big brother. I'll be getting one. I like the idea of having a interactive and smart alarm clock and this one looks aesthetically beautiful
they should kill the bezels
the goal of modern living is simplicity, not more gadgets
free video calls to amazon corporate headquarters and the NSA.  just press nothing.
Its going to look so hot with s big piece of black tape on the camera. I'll sit it right next to the fan I have with matching black tape on the blue light that shoots out of it.
Just as a word of advice to some of the people commenting, here's a hint: ANYTHING with a camera or a microphone connected to the internet can be used by the government to watch you. Your phone, any microphones you have connected to your computer, webcams, all of that can be used to watch you. So, can the government watch you through this? Yes. Of course they can, and I'm sure they probably will. But they can also watch you at all times when you're on your phone or your laptop watching this video. It isn't new information, people. Yes, these devices can be used to watch you, but anything connected to the internet with some kind of recording device can be used to do that. The only difference is that this is a smart alarm clock. Doesn't matter.
Jeof Bezzoz is lost
Yea if i buy one, the first thing i will do is put a tape on the front facing cam. \n\nIt would be nice if companies would think about actually making some kinda lid on the camps their integrate into their products, \nso people would have a choice, so people dont have to destroy the design of the thing with a ugly table. \n\nBuy hey, first world problems..
Amazon need to stop stealing others ideas, like this one:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufR8uJAAw0&t=
Yay an alarm clock that uses electricity!! That's a game changer!
what a load of rubbish
I will not put that magic 8 ball w/ a camera in my bedroom. \n\nAlso I wonder how many ppl do video calls. Anecdotally idk anyone. Curious if the rest of population does regularly enough to buy this. They must if Amazon if Amazon is betting on it
This is almost what I wanted... but for something to really be an alarm clock it needs to have a backup battery.  I used my dot as an alarm clock for awhile, but the first time the power went out and my alarm didn't go off, I had to stop using it.
That THING looks like a color iMac! Amazon devices are REALLY FAT-Show, Spot, Tablets EVERYTHING.\n\nThat's why they only show front views of the Show.
Amazon wants a bunch of these in homes. The price needs to be $50 less then.
So 100 dollars less than a spot?
I want one. But can't even pre-order it in the UK. Probably won't get it until Spring.
150$ ??!! No thanks
Would be nice if it had a phsical camera cover
Is amazon going to offer some kind if trade in upgrade for people with old alexas
I'm distracted by his tiny head.
I have a phone.
Not to be confused with the nVidia Spot, which is scheduled to come out.... someday, they think.\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/smart-home/
Cool device with an attractive pitch and design, but Amazon's ecosystem doesn't appeal to me at all, and it's not available in all countries.
I would buy that for a dollar
love it. need to get it. available yet?
i thought we developed smartphones in order to get rid of alarm clocks...
Why would anyone want that wire tap in their house?
Okay, of all of the echo products so far, this one (to me at least) looks the most futuristic of the bunch. I don't even use Alexa or any smart home appliances for that matter, but I want it anyway
one in the kitchen, bedroom, and living room? yeah no thanks. and you know why...
Looks cool but always listening is becoming always watching...
Looks nice but Alexa can’t answer some very basic questions. Would love to see this hardware with google assistant intelligence.
0:48 indeed, a good clcol amazon echo spot is
The dot next to my computer keeps waking up to this
So pretty much a device that does everything my smartphone already does.  I think I'll pass.
Probably most appealing thing in the line-up more affordable price, small modern form-factor, and it has the luxury of a screen + all the features of a regular echo.
FREE video calls?!? No freaking way!
don't put that in bedroom
Imagine Alexa in your bedroom listening to you sleep...
This is my favorite eco but I’m not buying it since amazon have information to the government about people talking to the eco
Not sure about having a camera next to my head while I'm sleeping.  Believe it or not, I obviously LOVE tech....emmm emm my tech review channel :).  However, when it's time to sleep I want absolutely NO TECH in my bedroom, including my phone.
Does youtube work on it?
WALLS HAVE EARS! AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT!
I wonder why they didn't make the screen bigger. Should have went with a 3 screen
Wow now that's cool
new product from CI... i mean amazon 😊
I think this is the most interesting of the new devices but it's real potential is lost to me when it doesn't keep a charge for like lets say the power goes out...    Then it's not a dependable alarm clock.
Who wonna trade vid clips on this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Any idea if the display can turn off?  Asking for the clock in a bedroom use case.
Has anyone ever told Alexa to shut up
Coming Soon: Amazon Cool Beans- an alexa enabled refrigerator, specifically designed for beans. starts at 1299
Why would you want a camera on it?
My Echo kept going off during this video lmao
Doesn't this one look too similar with the upcoming smart speaker by the essential?
too pricey, $75 per an we got a deal
It's a buy and a great deal.. can't wait for the knock off version
This looks cool but has personal data breach written all over it. -no thanks.
So it does nothing my phone can't do.
Put one in your bedroom huh? then don't forget to cover the camera or turn it around whenever you're pleasuring yourself, cause you just never know who's watching.........
South Park should had waited to make that Alexa episode how funny whould this be if they mocked the fact that this thing has a camera on it
Ah, great...  A camera next to my bed
one in the bathroom?
These devices are great epitomes of consumerism.
How come Amazon sucks at making products.
Bedroom
Makes me miss my Chumby.
Should have included wireless charging
meh.
たけー
Nest Alarm Clock
Gayy
Its pretty elegant
A smart alarm clock? Nice.
Make Alexa Great Again #MAGA
STOP saying ALEXA! lol
Djmario sube el CAMINO!!
Nexus Q, anybody?
I want it
To all who are commenting that this echo spot will now be able to hear you and see you in your bedroom. Hope you morons realize you carry your phones everywhere.
Wait until edward snowden see this..
putting an internet connected smart device with a good front facing camera in your bedroom? Grrreeaat idea!
I want one
Is there anyway that if you had one in your kitchen, in your living room, on your desk, and in your bedroom that you can link them and use them as home surveillance?
I'd pay $20 for this glorified photoframe.
this is pretty cheap so idk why people are complaining
Got Siri, I don’t need this weird spyware thing too.
What usefully those devices do? Other than stealing your data.
130 is way too expensive
The issue with this is that an alarm clock needs 100% reliability. What if there is no power or WiFi. Does it have back up power and does the clock work fully with no internet. Does it go down sometimes.  On a regular Echo none of this matters, but it does on an alarm clock. That has to work every single time, with no exceptions ever.
But does it have an aux out port. If it does I'd totally get one.
Mac users are too dumb to build and assemble a PC
I don't know specific models, but definitely get a good mechanical keyboard; you gotta treat your fingers.. :)
Hey Austin this is guys
John Hill in the background, amazing 12:48
Nice work Sara and welcome to the pc comunity by the way
Okay that was awesome! I sleep, eat, and DREAM pc's. so to Sara, John and Austin. watch bitwit where kyle and austin do a speed build on a $700,000 boat.  but sara. the my setup of monitors. for 980ti (last gen of flagship graphic cards). i run 3 22 1080p and 1 55 LG 4K IPS super UHDTV. model number 55UH7700 or 55UH77. I currently watch all my youtube and play rocket league, and then on the graphic creation side of things. Ill use it to check colors. till I update my triple monitors to something better. but dont just limit yourself to just one monitor.
The logitech mx Master s2 is a very good mouse for video editing, and usually i would recommend any of the mechanical keyboards from Razer or Corsair.
Hey Sara . . . for the monitor I use the LG 27UD88 . . . its a beautiful monitor  and I would also recommend the LG 43UD79 because its pretty much got the same features of the 27UD88 in a giant 43 inch screen and thats it . . .
I bet he uses a floppy
You should probably just a get a Logitech mx master mouse. Keyboards are pretty based on preference, I don't much like mechanical ones but you might. For a monitor you should get a professional 4k monitor that is color accurate. Idk a model in particular.
0:59 Austin be like :\nU are not the guy , u are not capable of being the guy , i had a guy but now i dont :)
get the mionix castor mouse
U look dope
That cooler is Giant 6:03
Super nice PC!
NH-D15 <3
PC MASTER RACE!!!
buy this one, the best for video editing: LG 38UC99-W
This was a solid video.
My computer has almost the exact same specs
Great video, I wish I could do a video with you sigh.
logitech mx master 2 productivity mouse,corsair k95 platinum rgb keyboard and a lg 34uc98 4k ips ultrawide monitor and u will be in heaven
I'm gonna hold it if you can screw it. Austin, comedy gold.
The logitech MX Master mouse is amazing
If you're looking for a mouse then I recommend logitech mx master 2s. Probably the best mouse out there.\nLink: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B071YZJ1G1/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1506769278&sr=8-2&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&keywords=logitech%2Bmx%2Bmaster%2B2s&dpPl=1&dpID=41DA1NEJN-L&ref=plSrch&th=1&psc=1\nFor monitor then I recommend getting something that's 120hz+ and has G-Sync since you have a GTX 1080. It's good to have one in case you might want to game one day. Don't want to regret the decision later, trust me.\nHere's one: Link  https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017EVR2VM/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1506769839&sr=8-5&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&keywords=gsync+ips+monitor&dpPl=1&dpID=41NvEug7zyL&ref=plSrch \n\nHope this helps.
Since it's for editing the monitor should be IPS no need for a fancy keyboard or mouse although it would be shame to not throw in some rgb on those XD
For that mouse, Logi MX Master 2S all the way. A bit pricey, but worth it.
Sara you are amazing. Was that Austin's camera recording you during the build or your own?
You should do a vs between your MacBook and this New PC, and show the difference to all those blindfolded Apple lovers. I liked that you realize there's a lot of products outside Apple that do the same or better and are cheaper. and I say yes you should explore them. \nFor Mouse I recommend the MX Master it's great for productivity and editing and you should look into some LG 4k monitors do your research there are so many channels about tech. Ask them look into their forums and discussions. The tech world is huge and not just Apple products. Keep going.\n Pd: can't wait to see John's PC tho :v
No way, we have the same case XD
I actually went backwards went to Mac platform from Windows, ended up building up the old Mac Pro (last good Mac desktop). 3.46Ghz 12 core cpu, 128Gb of ram! check out the specs, prices and process. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YdpN1kk2Wk&t=940s\n\nI also use premier pro cc, and this build owns my pc that was built several years ago. Highly recommend the mx masters or the mx masters 2s mouse. It is by far my favorite mouse of all time. I grew up with windows pc and always been a windows guy, but am now realizing what the Mac hype is all about. Although I'll always have a spot for windows, OS X and program optimization is amazing.
I got the same motherboard x370 with the 1800x for a streaming box. Only issue with the build is i can't get the ram to run over 2133. I bought vengence lpx 16gb 3200. Even after 5 bios updates can't get it running still faster then 2133. other then that it's top notch. I stream at 1080P 60fps on medium with x264 on obs.
Sara, you are the ultimate girl next door. 👍
Just use your Mac monitors. Grab the necessary cables and hook it up.
Great video!!! amazing collaboration! show us the final setup when u have ir ready!!! stay peachy!!
I definitely recommend the Logitech MX Master series of mice. Great for editing!
LOGITECH MX MASTER MOUSE!!!\nJust get it.\nThank me later.
Why did you miss out on installing Windows....awww
mouse for u..> mx master 👍✌️🙂
If you prefer the mac OS, theres nothing wrong with that :) Why not hackintosh your PC? Best of both worlds, power of the pc and the OS of your choice! Great vid keep them up
Both of you done a great job. Nice collaboration :)
Once you go PC...;-)
Such a great video Sara, love it! Get the Lofree keyboard, it’s mechanical, wireless, backlit and super retro looking! For mouse look at the Logitech MX master 2S, it’s got tonnes of customisable buttons and feels amazing to use. For a monitor, check out the Acer H277HU, it’s a 2K monitor that looks super stylish! All are available in white which would make a really clean setup with minimal cables as both the mouse and keyboard are wireless! Hope this helps, can’t wait to see the final setup!!
Get the Logitech MX Master Mouse, it is fantastic for productivity and ergonomics 😄😄
I just picked up the 1080 founders edition. Does anyone know the difference between it and the one Sara & Austin are using in this build?
Mouse: Logitech MX Master\nKeyboard: Take a look at a few mechanical keyboards\nMonitor: It depends! If you decide to game any time soon, a 1440p 120/144Hz would be good. Else, stick to a 1440p/4k 60 Hz monitor.
The Logitech MX Master 2S is a nice mouse to use for editing. Its very ergonomic and feels nice in the hand. Many video editors use it. Its also wireless which is a nice bonus. (Link below)\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Cross-Computer-Control-910-005138/dp/B071YZJ1G1?th=1
can't suggest a monitor but for peripherals go with the Logitech mx Master mouse and corsair rgb strafe keyboard
what a nice couple
Hey peachy check this out for video editing monitoring goodness https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1224156-REG/lg_34uc88_b_34_21_9_curved.html
Logitech MX Master mouse, with a logitech g810 orion would be a very good keyboard mouse combo
For mouse, I'd get the best one in the world: the MX Master 2S. And for keyboard (get a mechanical!), you can either go with a Corsair or Logitech brand.
This is super Fresh!!!!
Get an ultra wide monitor. I just got one for my editing....life changing. It works so much better than dual screen.
Congrats on the build!! You'll definitely enjoy having a computer faster than you while editing. As for the mouse recommendation, definite check the Logitech MX Master
I'd go with the Dell 4K ultra wide curve.
I want a GTX 1080 TI\nBUT TWO OF THEM IN SLI\nI MADE IT RHYME \nSO LET ME HAVE A LIKE\n\n\n\n\nAND is he your boyfriend
Yaaasssss. Seems like a pretty cool dude. Glad he was able to hook you up wit dat knowledge yo!
These two should more together!
Too bad he used old equipment and a Ryzen processor for that build.
For a keyboard, get a Razer Blackwidow Chroma, and a logitech mx master 2 for the mouse
If you'd gone Intel instead of AMD you could have ended up with a Hackintosh and had your choice of OS's.   \n\nAs far as a monitor,  and respectable brand, 4k, with 100% sRGB colorspace, and as high a bit-depth as your budget allows.\n\nA mouse is a very personal thing so go to a store where you can test them.  Keyboard is nearly the same but I generally like Logitech wired and wireless keyboards.
You have to check out the logitech craft keyboard, the knob works super well with Adobe stuff and it can also connect to your macbook and a third device. The logitech mx  master 2s is a really cool, really functional mouse that again is amazing for creators with multiple machines.
I would suggest getting a Logitech MX Master 2s Mouse, Das Mechanical Keyboard they work both on Mac and Win and BenQ Pro 32inch 4K monitor or LG's 31.5inch 4K Monitor.
all pc fan boys were just staring at the beroll in awe
WHY WAS THIS in my notifications
as a video editor you would love wide-screen monitors! either 29 or 34 inch
Austin - it was definitely 8 ^_^
Recently got the Mx master 2 And it is Really Nice. (As a full time video editor) the vertical scrolling is such a Nice feature And its not (too) expensive.
With a kick ass monitor, keyboard and mouse. This will be awesome. \n\nI want to see the review of this machine already.
-“What’s a ‘cd drive’, you’re gonna have to explain that to me”\n-“Replaced the FLOPPY DISK.”\nLOL great explanation 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope you show us the new setup when it's ready. I'd like to see the process of you deciding why you picked what u picked. I'd also love to see you use ur pc on video. I like seeing people switch over from Mac to windows. It's an interesting perspective, especially since ur a tech fanz
“I’m going to hold it and you screw it “ lmao 👋😂😂😂
Awesome build.
best Mouse for editing is for sure the Logitec MX Master!
Definitely a 34 inch ultrawide of some sort. The LG ones are pretty good.
Logitech MX Master is the mouse for you, that's all I know :)
MX Master mouse, Logitech k810 keyboard. The keyboard is very similar to the apple bluetooth keyboard , but backlit. it's awesome! Acer Predator Z35P 35 ultra wide  monitor.
Why not keep using your old monitors?
Get the logitech G403 mouse, i hear only good stuff!
Mouse: for editing Logitech MX Master
I really love how Sara is collabing with pretty big you tubers and she makes content that is just as good as them and she is a smaller youtuber.
Get the Logitech MX Master. You will love it.
Next up Casey Neistat
Wow Nice Pc!!!! Great Build
Logitech mix master and Corsair k70 lux
Mx master 2 mouse
Mouse : Corsair M65 PRO RGB FPS \nKayboard : Corsair K70 RGB (or any K series mechanical keyboard)
Use razor keyboards. They r sick

good video
I feel like more people try to make mean tweets about celebrities now than before because they wanna get on this show.
Can anyone in this comment section please just take a moment to +1 this comment to pay their respect for @brandenp's mother? She arrived at burn ward less than 5 minutes ago in critical condition from being utterly DECIMATED by that savage level Kumail Nanjiani comeback :D
I only watched this because I thought Gal Gadot was going to read a tweet calling her a zionist. It must have taken ages to find that one tweet.
No! Jennifer Aniston is an amazing actor, just look at the sitcom friends!
stop doing what ever your doing and watch some Zachary zimmer
I agree with the one about Baldwin...He is a good actor... But he's degrading with all those Trump impersonations...his face looks so sick-making...I feel sorry for him. Stop it, Alec, come back to real acting! Good, meaningful films that make people think!
I'd love to judge Gal Gadot's breasts. I'm sure they are as hot as she is.
gal gadot??? I don't know about you but Gal Gadot can gal my gadot anytime :)
Okay thats it, Kumail has won. He is officially the most savage man in hollywood
Kumail was so badass he dusted off that old Thug Life meme and 8-bit shades landed on his face as Snoop played.
Just couldn't do anything without a jab at trump. Uhg these tv shows are so lazy. Who isn't tired about trump jokes. Alec has done this running joke for 2 years now.... it's like borat and all these talk show hosts like jimmy are all still saying great success.....This show's biggest hit is to have celebs read tweets, what a great writing team they have.....hah
I was wondering when Donald Trump was gonna take a virtual swing at Baldwin on Twitter.
John Lithgow is also a savage.
You know when you see a lady that looks so old that it's impossible to imagine a time when she didn't look old? Emma Watson is what she used to look like.
Gal Gadot got nice-shaped 't*tties' imo, even if they're small.
Must have been hard to find a Gal Gadot tweet that wasn't about her killing Palestinians
Aniston's is lost on me. Is the tweet calling her plain and white? ...If so, that set up made it a weak burn. Definitely could have thought of a more clever way to phrase that. Not me ... But someone could have. u.u
liked this video just for the last one lmao
Beach in the middle of the ocean? https://youtu.be/EsMOB_XdUsQ
I bet it was difficult to find a bad tweet about Gal Gadot that didnt have to do with her being a zionist lol
Everyone is applauding Kumail's comment, which was great and all, but are we going to over look Michael Keaton's I mean come on
Comment crucial threat kaebiw estimated Christian office community publication holy versus topic.
Kumail should be arrested for that burn.
Haha that Last one was Bloody Awsome
Hey, I love your video Jimmy Fallon! My first daughter, who recently had her first child (His name is tommy by the way. Really good boy) used to watch you all the time. That episode where you had the lasagna spill over over jamal! Classic! haha! anyways. I gotta get back to mowing the lawn. The grass wont trim itself. Actually. I think I just came up with an amazing idea for self lawn mowing lawn mower. I'll call it Trim my yard. I'm actually on squarespace right now to build my website. Head on over to www.AlltheothernamesweretakensoIhadtousethisonehahahahaha.org for your free shipping of the self mowing lawn mower. Anyhow. I'm lonely please help.
I WISH ALEC BALDWIN READ THE TWEET IN TRUMP'S VOICE
That zinger at the end there!!!
That last one was the best 😂😂his comeback
does anyone else feel like these get unfunnier as they go? the early ones were so funny
The Jim Parsons one is the funniest because it's true. 1:36
0:12 it's sad when an Israeli woman understands the English language better than an average twitter user.
THE LAST ONE IS PRICELESS 😂😂
The last one killed me
They already used that SNL Trump Impression one before..
The last guys retaliation was epic.
The Elizabeth Moss tweet is actually 100% accurate.
The last one lmfao😂😂

What is the goal? It's going to be controversial. The goal is to meet the challenge of racial interbreeding.\nThe challenge that faces us in the 21st Century. It's not a choice, it's a obligation. It's imperative.\nWe cannot do otherwise. We find ourselves being confronted with major problems.\nWe must change! we WILL change all at the same time in buisness, in administration, in education,\nin the political parties. And we will obligate ourselves as to results.\nIf this volunteerism does not work for the republic, then the state will move to still more coercive measures.\n- Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France (16 May 2007 – 15 May 2012), Speech from 2008\n\nI think there is a resurgence of anti-Semitism because at this point in time Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural.\nAnd I think we are going to be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. \nEurope is not going to be the monolithic societies they once were in the last century. \nJews are going to be at the centre of that. It’s a huge transformation for Europe to make. \nThey are now going into a multicultural mode and Jews will be resented because of our leading role. \nBut without that leading role and without that transformation, Europe will not survive.\n— Barbara Lerner Spectre, IBA-News, 2010.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I hereby prompt you to participate at the protest,“Live better without Nazis - diversity is our future”, \non the 6th of June at 10a.m. in Neurupinn. We have to take a stand against the Nazis. \nBecause of our history between 1933 - 1945 we are obliged to treat refugees properly. \nWe also have to save their lives in the Mediterranean. There has to be a legal [unbureaucratic] way to get asylum in Europe. \nCountries like Poland - very Catholic by the way - have to be willing to accept [more] refugees. \nOh, and by the way: Every year more native Germans die than there are born. That is very fortunate. \nIt’s because the Nazis are not very good at having offspring. This decline [of Germans] is why we are so dependent on immigration from foreign countries.  \nSee you at the protest. Goodbye!

Alguem PT
It is a mental game, he is getting in the head of the other team
He just wants to get some camera time...BVB really should look into upgrading in his position though.
How have I never noticed this?
If only he'd be as keen to get his hands on the ball when it comes flying at him in the middle of a match.....
Im from Bayern but this is funny lmao xd

Ein Ritual hat doch jeder. Ich kratze mir morgens erstmal die Eier.
Was für ein Depp! Wie wärs mit einem Ritual nach jedem Stuhlgang die Toilletenrolle als Andenken an die Wand tapezieren
das hat wer von neuer geklaut... nixwisser...
Da werde ich in Zukunft mal drauf achten.\nAm besten finde ich das bei 0:30 :D
es un completo crack jajaja
Neuer macht das vor jedem Spiel genau wie Fährmann es auch vorher so gemacht hat bevor er Kapitän wurde.
ICH SAG NUR KURZE ECKE
Der soll mal lieber seine kurze Ecke zu machen
Ist alle schüsse am kurzen eck reinlassen auch ein ritual von ihm?
Bürki ist Top und passt perfekt zu BvB
Vor einem Dortmund Video Bayer Werbung ?!? Nice!!!
Haha was macht der jung:)
Richtig lustig. Habe mich vor lachen weg geschmissen.
Bin zwar Bayern Fan,aber finde das Bürki ein guter,erfahrender und Sympathischer Typ ist 😂💪🏼
Ach man der roman
Nur das das Neuer schon gemacht hat bevor Bürki schon bei Dortmund gespielt hat
Das beste ist bei 0:32😂😂😂😂
Schon aufgefallen,aber gibt es eigentlich einen Grund?😂
Neuer macht das auch
Bringt ihm ja nicht sonderlich viel, wenn er die letzten Spiele fast jeden Ball der auf die Torwartecke geht nicht halten konnte
Bin ich der einzigste der das gerade zum erstenmal mitbekommt ? 😂
I LOVE THIS TEAM!!!!!!

It's inevitable, she's going to be kicked off. NBC, just save the time & money and do it now. She's nothing special and was only popular because Trump talked about her vaginal blood.
So, here she has two living legends from film and television; so what does Megyn Kelly focus on? AGE! Throughout the whole segment, rather than focusing on their film project, she keeps asking them both about age and plastic surgery. Sorry Megyn, but interviewing is not your forte either. What an awkward interview.
Kelly is not a people person and has zero charisma. This interview is so awkward.
Megyn Kelly sucks on morning tv.  Who asks about plastic surgery during an interview about a movie.  Her “gotcha” style interviews sucks and hurts the TODAY show brand. Stars are going to start boycotting appearances because of her
Poor little Megyn. She can't hold a conversation. Why in the world does anyone think she can handle this sort of interview? So embarrassing.
Really!??? That's what you're asking? Such a waste of time... can i ask you something Megan? Can you leave!? right now!
Megyn Kelly is horrible! I would never watch her show after seeing this!
Redford is funny! MK screws up with Jane and is inappropriate in her questions.
So ageist, so sexist. this was criiiiiiiiiiinge lol
cringe interview
megyn is just so awkward.
Megyn should quit this job....its just not for her....shes off topic
I can't believe MK had two of the greatest actors sitting right in front of her and decides to discuss plastic surgery! REALLY??? She's blowing her chances, you can't teach humility. Crash and burn...........
Is MK interested in anything  besides appearances and age????? How shallow! (and that's a kindness!)\nwhatever made someone hire her in this capacity ??? nearly brainless. And the audience as well, WHY would they populate the seats for a program like this?
The interviewer couldn't make it more awkward for these legends with her imbecilic questions
Megan: Lose the f**king pen! IT's stupid
Omg that question to Jane Fonda was so inappropriate and ill timed! Horrible horrible horrible! Megan is so bad at this job it's startling.
Megyn Kelly is the worst. How is it possible to be so thoughtless? Jane Fonda and Robert Redford are amazing and I wish she could have asked relevant questions. #losthope
Queen Jane shoots down the vile Megyn Kelly. Take this witch back to the slime bucket that is Fox News.
LOL.. the fail is strong with this narcissistic blonde twit.
I thought she said Arseholes at Night ! ( it's the American accent, I'm a Brit)  Terrible interviewer and possibly the most insulting dumbest cringeworthy ageist questions she could ask ... these two legends. And yet they were still gracious . Wish someone would give them the time they deserve and a respectful interviewer
Three Days Of The Condor is the best suspense film ever made.  And one of the best films ever made, period.
Megyn says it's a beautiful, beautiful film @ 5:00 and it sounds so disingenuous, she probably didn't even see it!!
Did anyone else feel like the question was really inappropriate? About plastic surgery? I mean really?
Yeah plastic surgery and exercise.
The only thing Megyn has going for her is her looks. She is terrible at interviewing. That is why her show is tanking.
I feel bad for Fonda. She had to sit through an interview with this ignorant woman.
1:51 Really Megan Kelly That like Bryanstars level of Stupid questions i mean come on.
Hanoi Jane, never forget.
She is trying its hard to overcome old habits fox news was and is the worst
megyn kelly really sucks...more and more...pretty amazing redford's gone from media recluse to showing up on day time chat shows...getting older made even the sundance kid come in from the cold...
It’s over Johnny
Megyn Kelly screwed up here.  But sometimes I get the feeling these liberal celebrities try to throw her off balance on purpose because of the fact that she came from Fox News (which they absolutely hate).
Megyn Kelly is AWEFUL.
Horrible interview.
You know that something is seriously wrong with today's society when someone like Megyn Kelly is a somebody.
What a hack job Kelly did on both of them ... yuck!  no more Meghan Kelly
I think Jane looks great, nothing to be ashamed of. What's her surgeons name, lots of woman have had surgery and look it, jane looks pretty natural.
Jane Fonda got more class, brains and beauty today and always, than that intervier Megyn Kelly has.\nThe way Jane Fonda handled that interview was amazing considering it was a full on nasty cut-throat remark by Megyn Kelly.\nI'm with Jane Fonda all the way, and Robert Redford. Just amazing talented people.
it's amazing how when you only see a short clip about the plastic surgeon question, an impression is left with the viewer how inappropriate the situation was and how angry Jane Fonda was. However, when you watch the entire interview, it was really only a blink in the context of it all.
man, do they live in the past or what?
Wow, they are still alive.
WORLDAASS NEWS.HAIL THE TODAY SHOW.HEALTHCAREAMERICA.COM ASK TRUMP IF.CLARENCE A WHITE.TODAY SHOW
Jane was looking daggers at Megyn and rightly so.  Megyn was extremely rude, would she want to be asked about her hair extensions?   I've always liked Jane Fonda and am glad to see her and Redford together again in a sequel of sorts to Barefoot in the Park.  I don't recognize that electric horseman movie because it was so awful.
Almost every question had to do with age.  WTF!?  When the interviewees keep having to save the interview, you know that something's JUST NOT RIGHT.   Redford's right about Jane, she's amazing.
The only way a Megyn Kelly talk show could be anywhere near remotely entertaining  is if it involved her stripping down and showing off those floppy, whithered, 46 year old fun bags.\nREPLY
MK sorry, but can you drool over Redford even more?
Kelly is great...who doesn't love watching a clown, just waiting for the fool to show up.
hahHHA I AGED NORMALLY BUT ALSO HIT THEM INJECTIONS HAHA XD IM GOOD ACTOR
why is the camera CONSTANTLY MOVING? distract from what's actually happening on screen maybe? BECAUSE IT SUCKS (the camera and the content). thanks
Megyn Kelley like most conservatives and Fox News anchors are tone deaf and just completely ignorant.
MK is not for daytime TV - she does not relate - she is a hard news person
I  would spit on Hanoi Jane heifer dog
Her show appeals to idiots. That's all
I just don't like Megyn.
I just heard the next episode is going to be completely devoted to DIY tips to protect your family from the New Black Panther Party. You're doing gods' work Megyn!
She destroyed her career when she left fox...today show screwed themselves after paying millions for her😂😂 instant buyers remorse
women have nothing to offer other than their looks. they are all terrified of aging, its sweet justice for us men who have to watch them entitled and evil all their life
Miss Kelly should just get off TV!!!!!
Megyn Kelly is no OPRAH. WHY is she so obsessed with Jane’s looks and body -_- she’s so fake. Trying to force feed us superficiality. She is spearheading ageism by constantly talking about Jane’s looks.
Megyn is forced and beating to her own drum at the expense of Fonda here. And also, why didn´t you ask Redford about his facelifts? Probably had as many as Jane has. Be a little self-critical about how you reproduce old stereotypes of women by the questions you ask. Not cool, sorry.
First the Will and Grace Snafu. Now this.\nYikes.
Cringing in embarrassment for Megyn. Why not askJane who she's looking forward to working with on the next project? Jane has class for miles!
Jane and Robert came to promote their new movie and Megyn consistently tried to take the conversation to any other topic besides the movie.  Strange way to do a movie-promo interview.  I can see why Jane was annoyed.  And Megyn still didn't take a hint.  She's got a big learning curve on how to do this kind of show.
Can't stand Megan Kelly, what a horrible interview
Awful host! She don't know how to listen to her guests...
Isn't this Megyn Kelly that person who claim that Jesus Christ was white and should only be showed as white? Isn't she the one who makes all types of excuses for police shooting of unharmed black people and claims that it has nothing to do with race.
Show's not going to last !!!
This isn’t about you Megan!! Please ...
Redford has become so effeminate.   He has been a good actor and last saw him in A WALK IN THE WOODS  with Nick Nolte in 2015.
MK just can't stay in the moments.... interrogate off topic vs. appreciate now
Jane Fonda is a 10 - in more ways then one. Admirable woman. Great respect for her.
never has there been two ego maniacs like Megyn Kelly and Jane Hanoi Jane Fonda pompous arrogant complete drones .  Redford that ship has come and sailed but still hanging on for some publicity and to be adored by the public.  PATHETIC !!!!!
Megyn Kelly already reached her peak of fame. It's all downhill from here.
i came here for Robert & Jane\n& then i saw  the cow\non the presidential debate \nit is her ?
A communist and a hateful feminist walked onto a stage........and then I turned the t.v. off.
in before canceled
JANE IS 😍😍
shadow gov. fake tv..
Omg that was upsetting to watch
Bye Megyn.
MEGYN KELLY IS TERRIBLE. Awful. Awfully terrible!! Terribly awful. \nGo back to Fox News.
r/cringe
Megan Kelly malicious
Megyn Kelly is trash lol
jane fonda has everything it takes to become a major political player.\nevery conservative fears jane fonda entering politics.\npelosi / fonda 2020!
It seems like when you're older your age will be rubbed in your face whether it's in a form of compliments or not...Honestly it doesn't need to be constantly pointed out 🙄
I personally think MK did a great job, and I’m not even a fan.
Redford looks like an old butch lesbian 😂😂😂
Redford should do a commercial for eyebrow dye for men
Megyn Kelly will never be half the woman Jane Fonda is.  Not to mention the Integrity.
If they want viewers they need edge, this is not edge, there is no edge on tv anymore!
Jane is funny.  She definitely likes to be the centre of attention with discussion pertaining to her or her co-star referencing her or them, even at her age.   Robert Redford has a good sense of humour.
This dyed-blonde skank must be deported to Saudi Arabia ASAP.
Jane Fonda just through complete shade...NAHH ..., she threw ABSOLUTE DARKNESS on this ignorant, moron, lawyer turned news anchor, turned entertainment host. Meghan,,dear,,,, CATS are the only creatures to boast about 9 lives, your DONE.
I think people or the media are making too big of a deal out of this part of the interview. Now that Ive seen it it just wasn't that bad.
Meghan has new charisma with whoever
i thought Jane Fonda died
why so much hate. news flash, the jane fonda plastic surgery qs is not a new qs :/
All these comments...\nSo much love in this world...\nWow.\nI’d like to see each one of you become an attorney, work for a major news station, and then run your own show.\nNo, she’s not perfect and neither are any of you.\nFor god’s sake it’s her third show-give her a break!\nThis endeavor of hers is entirely new and a completely different style of reporting.
Yes, I was trolling British cider lovers. Sorry.
Ohhhhhhhh so good!\nI will.....WILL try this one!\nGreets from far away Germany....which is gettin colder day by day :)
Give it the oooolllldd poka poka lol
I tried this. It was delicious. I added pig trotters to it so it was rich and so good.
nope... sorry... cant watch this right now. im not ready to be hungry yet... im saving this for breakfast lol
I make pork in cider with apples every fall. The gravy is brown, savory and spicy. Cider goes into my squash soup too. Cider is under utilized in cooking,
a la pork latte with a vinegar kicker....  \nThis was DELISH! The smell reminded me if my Grandmother's chitterlings but taste better.
my food wish is a savoury puff pastry appetizer. I keep making your sausage rolls for my guy, as he LOVES them. Unfortunately I have never been a huge fan of sausage rolls,  so I would love a little puff pastry appetizer I could make at the same time for myself!
The old poke-a poke-a
I'm sick to death of these dammed 'Prescription Drug Commercials! I thought there was a law against advertising Prescription Drugs drugs online! All I want to do is watch these videos without all the BS!
I'm onto you chef John. I saw that America's test kitchen episode a few days ago.
Chef John: What brand of French hard cider do you use. Is Calvados appropriate? I intend to make this recipe soon.
Can one use some of the amazing stock of the pork and cider as a stock for risotto?
Wow.
Hi ☺️, could you do a video making mulligatawny soup sometime? Thanks!
My mouth watered ugh 😑 I want some !
SPIDERMAN IS HUNGRY ! SPIDER MAN HA HA HA HA HA
This is my new place to come to when I miss my dad reading me bed time poems.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yummiest
rub rub 💩👅💋🐛
Interesting take on Somerset Pork.
Looks like you stole this idea from another YouTube Channel
Chef, at about 6:11 you showed a close up of the simmering gravy. The sides of the dutch oven had fond on them. Why didn't you scrape it down and dissolve it into the simmering liquid?
OM NOM NOM NOM NOM
Wow
Omg, that sounds foodgasmic!
Looks amazing!!!!
El chema de nega
you is you 💛
Delicata squash? Yes,please!
Kosher salt on pork...
Buttered rice you say?
That looks soooo good.
YOU ARE TRENDING :)
#25 trending thats what i wanna see
always love ur recipe this 1 looks outrageously YUM! Thank chef John.
Yoooo, Chef John is trending
Making this!! 😋😋
omg
First time the cayenne came in so late
Lol give it the old poke-a-poke-a I love Chef John!!! ^.^ Hope everyone is having great day!!
Looks ultra-yum! I also admire that freakishly small ladle.
John,  I shouldn't watch your videos at 1 in the morning.  I'm now gonna go cook.
i reduce my sauce/gravy in a vacuum evaporator.. so much better
Would this work with beef for those who can't eat pork?
Stole my recipe except that I always leave it bone on.  You just can't replicate the feel and taste of collagen.  Way better than resorting to flour or corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I also add thick apple slices to the braise so when done you have a more less savory apple sauce
in Turkish pork shoulder means domuz omzu shoulder is omuz pork is domuz THAT'S NO COINCIDENCE
John have you tried traditional English cider? Flat, strong, dry, tasting 100% of apples, tart, etc? I really think youd like it (maybe in recipes like this, or to drink...)
Takes sooo long to cook. I cooked it in a pressure cooker and took half an hour only.
we're not trying to make pulled pork here\nBut could we make pulled pork with a similar method?\npossibly thickening the sauce so it sticks more to the meat?
My heart never beats like it beats at this
I would love to see the squash recipe as well.
Ok, going on next grocery list.  Can't wait to drink the sauce!\n\nJust had the billionaire frank and beans, never been a fan but Chef John's recipe is simple, quick and absolutely gonna be an added favorite to my house (I cheated in one spot and didn't use water, I used veg broth ; ) watch the vidy and you'll understand.
Omg.....this is a alllllllllll day to cook 🍖 meat. Thanksgiving turkey 🦃 doesn't even take this long.! I'm going to give it a try though.
I have that exact same pot but can't brown anything in it! How do you brown meat on ceramic?
The rhythm of how you speak is very entertaining! :)
Wow not hours before I watched this video I bought a delicatta squash! Please show me what to do with it :)
Hi Chef John, is this recipe going up on All Recipes?
Sounds yummy. I’m making it this weekend.  Please do the squash video, too. It is squash season, after all.
You are the boss of your pork shoulder stewed in a creamy apple cider sauce!  Yes!  Want to learn more about Delicata squash for sure.  At first I thought it could have been sautéed apples which, of course, would have paired nicely with the pork shoulder.   Regardless Chef more on Delicata and other winter squash types.  Very underrated vegetable.
This man is bordering on national treasure
I could of used this recipe about 4 days ago when I found a 5LB pork shoulder for $7.00 . The only recipes I could find was bbq pulled pork.
My food wish is a open cheese pie\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/d5/ea/55d5eac2d9f69dd00e390535d6958ff5.jpg
Congrats on being #20 on the trending list! Good for you.
the cadence of this dude's voice bothers me
Did recipe with beef shoulder instead...worked great!
Pork shoulder is one of my favorite cuts from pork besides pork ribs and belly. Usually pork loins are too lean to my taste unless I make it sous vide.
Everything is better with a touch of Cayenne.
Cider from France??? Live local,buy local,love local,,,support our own.

I would like to try this with lamb.
I think I will add a star anise and a cinnamon stick.
what does hard cider mean? how is it different from regular cider? (a non-native english speaker here)
Wooo 25 on trending!! 😁😁😁
listen to me now and hear me later....lol
Chef John when I eat ass should I add a bit of cayenne or not? What do you think
the link doesn't pull up anything. wanted to send my husband the recipe but it just opens a blank browser
Is a Dutch Oven just a ceramic coated Cast Iron Pot?
really nice recipe.  and delicata squash is the absolute best.
FRESH-LY
Chef John, Amid the chaos, corruption and scandal that peppers the news on a daily basis, your humour and good nature provide the perfect antidote! Please keep up the great work!
Just made it. With a twist I reduced with a bit of the best home made beef stock, no salt added, and put just a few flakes of teragon. Wow amazing.
bouncin on my boy's d to this
All I saw in the title was PORK CREAMY SAUCE
I've been watching Food Wishes for years! Do you know how much I support and love the channel? I don't even skip the ads so you can get that revenue. Stay hustling Johnny boy.
His voice makes me sooooo sleepy \n😴😴\nI'm not complaining or anything
Making a batch of hard cider next week.  Looking forward to trying this recipe after it ferments.
Why does he sound like he is singing?
Good god his tone of voice is so crazy its like hes excited about every single sentence that comes out of his mouth oh my god!
Hello Chef John. I just made this and the pork was delicious, but the gravy is too tangy/vinger-y. Did I not reduce it enough? I reduced the liquid low and even added about 2 teaspoons of sugar because the sauce was very vinegar-y.
No garlic Chef John?
where is the beef, I mean MEAT!!!!!! I'm not much on boiled fat.
i dont know enough about being jewish, but is there a thing with kosher salt on pork, is that halal or whatever ok forget it.
chef john - i really must ask you this: do you have some religious objection to pressure cookers??  while this may not be the best example, but there are plenty where you could have used one and (imho) think you could have gotten better results, far faster.  you NEVER use pressure cookers.  what's up with that?\n\nanyone else with me on this?
I am sure others commented on @  4:14  the sauce went from a liquid to a thicker more reduced sauce. Plus pan had more meat in after the edit.  Chef John I am rather disappointed in this presentation.
the brown stuff at the bottom of the pan is actually called the suuc. the fond is when you deglaze it with liquid.
Now give it the old poka poka  i will forever use this😂😂😂
What did you say the glaze at the bottom of the pan is called ?
his voice goes up and down again and again
I'm guessing the question soon will be 'Tara where are you?'
tarararewee?
unoriginal wanker
I trolled my girlfriend, for vanity and youtube likes.
Wow so original...
Breaking News: Man annoys girlfriend with same repetitive unfunny prank over and over again, films it and the video goes ｖｉｒａｌ
Yeah... that was painfully not funny.
Tarawewawi
Lots of negative comments but the content was still good :)
Would have been a good video if the last one was a Tara would you marry me?, but this is just annoying.
Wow your girlfriend is so lucky.  She must think you're so unique.  I've never seen anyone do a video like this before..............................
unfunny copy of the other guy wasn't funny either
Tara is taking him to all these places without telling him where because she is probably going to kill him at one of them.
tarawawy?
I guess she doesn't understand that not responding will cancel out the joke?
If she havent dumped you after this, your lucky..........
Don't see how this is remotely funny, just a pretty sad attempt to seem witty.
Where were you at :25? Jay and Silent Bob get around
not funny, not original.  go away
Fuck bro you're annoying, you're lucky she didn't ditch you.
Cringey and not funny at all
What's her name?
Tarawerawi
Bali ?
tarawerarwe?
tarawarewee??
those looks!! killing me
tara we a wi?
Tara we're early.
Tara take me along next time.  Especially to the place with the electric scooter.
At one point they were in Crysis
lol the amount of people in the comments that can't even handle this video.

Tara, please answer him!
tawaawaawy?
when they are in the bedroom 'Tara, where are we?'
Is it only for me or she played along the whole video?..
what's with the random Jay and Silent Bob painting at 0:25 ? Where was that?
Where are we Tara?
Tara, you should be with me instead.  I will never ask you where we are.
Ruined your whole trip for this lol
WHERE ARE YOU THEN?!
Yep. These things still aren't cute or funny or anything
This is the least enjoyable version of this, bothering your girlfriend thing. You should take a page from the “they got enough X here” or the ikea pun guy.
how is this funny?
leaves on the motor bike - laughed real hard

Hi @LTavvy! I'm with ABC News! Did you make this video? Can we use it on all ABC platforms/partners with credit to you?
Why?
Nobody cares
Abusing women, filming it and putting it on YouTube for the world to see is NOT okay.  Males need to realize that this is NOT acceptable behavior.
This is the first video I saw from your channel and oh my goodness. This is so adorable❤❤ I can't take it anymore. Little Juno is so cute and small. Love love love
We would like a proper tour of Ollie's cute house!!!
Juno is sooo cute!:))) Congrats Ollie! Just waiting for the future to come when she sees this video.
Welcome to the world Juno!
you'll be a good father ❤
OH MY DEAR GOD!!!!!!!!! I COULD'NT STOP SMILING DURING ALL VIDEO!!!! I am so happy for you Ollie! OH MY GOD! I wish Juno will grow up healthly, happy and saved (please wear the clothes everyday Josh) ~ She is already loved by lots of people. God bless you all, my adorable friends!! (I see you guys as my friends, Im sorry hahaha). Best wishes from BRAZIL!  - Amanda

여기에 싫어요 한사람 최소 사람아님.
Y'all asked for savageness and y'all got it
That Lilly and Liza joke tho... ❤
Wait who did it first Liza or lily?😂
We are the generation of self-aware-hate 👊
The Shane Dawson roast was Soo cringe inducing kinda a low blow especially since it's been years since that was a thing.. you could tell even he felt wierd about it after saying it
some of y’all stupid asf i swear, they didn’t mic the entire audience, in fact likely muted it for the purpose of them hearing the performance. logic.
Can someone please explain the joke at 0:54 about the texting?
This was so good! It's too bad they were all too full of themselves to laugh.. 2:46
omg they sat Shane Dawson with Sugar Pine 7, I knew I saw a pink hat
The best roast song I've heard
Can I buy this on iTunes?
liza and lilly why r they a like their brown youtubers?
i've always loved jon cozart. this makes me love him even more.
The crowd was dead I felt the pain
I liked it when people booed him, and he just pat the air like, hush, I'm not done child,
jon's fake laughs hurt my soul he looks like he's in pain
I face palmed at the Shay Carl one 😂
*the teen choice awards for everyone who wasn’t invited to the teen choice awards*
I love everyone he mentioned but oh my god everything he said was accurate. 💀
this needs to be an hour long or more
Haha so many social media people take themselves so seriously these days, I feel like they just don't get that humor Cozart uses.
I'M SO SHOOK OMG I LOVE IT
Kinda feels like a cross between Bo Burnham and John Mulaney and I love it
dodie and stevie are totally 100 percent dating i am screaming
I love this video
he was anxious behind his stage personality cuz he knew he was in trouble xD
Ok but i would have been laughing hard as hell like the annoying person at every concert that you want to be quiet because they are doing too much
me and my life in four mins
BLESS THIS MAN WHO GIVES NO FUCKS AND BLESS THE YOUTUBER’S HE MENTIONED FOR BEING LIGHTHEARTED AND ADORABLE ABOUT IT
he went fucking in
the audience is horrible here, jon you did AMAZING. this is hilarious
THIS WAS SO GOOD I LOVE JON
He doesn't even give a fuck 😂❤️
Liza was the only one who could laugh at herself :\
The only people that cool and having fun are Lilly Singh and Liza Koshy. Cool personality too.
Where’s the Lilly part?
This is what he's been doing probably. Writing and practicing this.
I love how even when Liza was getting roasted David was still JAMMING
THE LILY AND LIZA THING OMG-
okay the Shane one was a TAD too far but this roast WAS FIRE
oh my god this was SAVAGE and also amazing
Jon still doesn’t have a real ukulele strap😂
I love how he doesn't give a shit if he's gonna get attacked
DAMN I LOVE THIS GUY. HE IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL.
The audience were shit
Whoever picked John Cozart as host deserves an award.
If I did that, I would dig a hole so deep so I could go to North Korea to die happily after roasting Kim Jong-un too....
WATCH OUT FOR MY GIRLS AND MY BOI SHANE ok
I love how Liza was like TRUE TRUE
This is fucking great.
I know this happened a few days ago, but is there anywhere I can watch the full show again?
I'm not even a native speaker and this made me laugh SO HARD my neighbours could probably hear me. 😂
I know every one said this but really the audience is so blank 😁😂 Kinda makes you feel bad
“The A-List of the D-List celebrities”\n\nSo spot on😂
MAMRIE IS READY TO FIGHT!
its sad that most of the people in the audience are so stuck up they cant laugh at jons jokes about them. he fucking killed it
Jon is such a talented little shit it isn't fair. The audience is crap though.
This is why I love him. What a savage.
okay but I ship dodie and stevie so just asdfghjkl
Yet he still hasn’t uploaded in like a year
He was perfect!!! I love it but the crowd was dead man what the hell he was funny
I wish I knew someone as funny as Jon Cozart!! 😂😂
Why is the audience so dead? Like most of these people make careers out of roasting people online???
OH MY GOD. The audience is fucking muted. Very common for award ceremonies because the microphone focuses its audio inputs to the speaker. Calm the fuck down people, It wasn't a tough crowd.
Everyone talking about the audience being dead, well, seemed pretty darn lit to me! I’m _sorry_ you could actually hear Jon at all, next time we’ll just have to mute him instead of the audience #logicisstrongwiththeseones  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2:33 was the best part
Best diss track so far
*steamy awards*
ITS NEDDDDDD @1:40
That was bloody amazing
best song ever
Well shit
MAMRIE HART'S REACTION LMFAOOO
THOSE ARE MY FRIENDS jon cozart 2k17
I love this 😂❤️
I’m fucking dying
This is ..... AMAZING
3:09 yo its tessa brooks blah blah blah im tessa brooks
Impressed Jon, very impressed ;D
Omg he is great!
BEAUTIFUL
ded
SHAY LOL
HE ROASTED EVERYONE IM CRYING
poor dodie
Shaycarl’s got me dead😂😂
He killed it
2:10 HAHAHAH
Ahhh cringing so bad😬😬
This was amazing
THIS WAS EVERYTHING
Boom roasted.
I LOVE HIM fullstop 😂😂
Love it
Shanaynay wasn't blackface but ok
too real
F*ck😂
Seeing all these comments about the stuck up audience and how nobody knew how to laugh at themselves. I watched it again to find out what they're all talking about, and I still see people laughing at themselves all over the place. Sure, there was one person who looked like she was saying something snappy, but she had a smile on her face before that. The audience is muted. We can't actually hear what they're doing...
Why was everyone like ahhhhhhhhh!\nWhen he talked about Tyler Oakley and Hannah Hart and said don't you worry your careers will be featured at the Imamorium park. \nLike what does that mean??\nCan anyone explain?\nP.s it's 2:36
Can someone explain the blackface joke please?
I love this Sanneeeeee!!!!
Aw I love this video. It captures that warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you pick up a new book or finish a great one. Fantastic work, Sanne!
haha to all my school books....
I absolutely adored this! I am also so heartbroken at how few books I have left to read.
That was really sad! Beautiful, but sad.
This is so different from your usual videos but I absolutely love the different feel!\nAnd I can totally relate still. There are simply books we'll never read, for one reason or another.\nBut it's okay.
Beautiful and I'm now depressed about how few books I still have time to read...
I loved this! Great video!
Omg why did this make me tear up?! The feeeeeeeeeels !!!! 😢
THIS WAS SO GOOD!!! I'm in awe
I love this sooo much 💜
Where are the pillows around the 1 min mark from ? Love the print!
can i have the books that make me look impressive tho
You are beautiful, this is beautiful.
ONLY 3550??????? a;ldkfjaoisdjfakjbglajfldajs?!?!?!?! woah. That absolutely blew my mind. I need to reevaluate my life O_O
This was so beautiful ❤
That was like a love note to all books 😍☺️
Aww this is so cute 💕 absolutely love it!
So true! love this :)
Yes!!! I love this! Warmed my heart <3
This is such a wonderful video! Love the atmosphere ❤️
This is amazing. I love this so much! ❤️❤️❤️ I couldn’t agree more for this.
Loved this😊
I absolutely loved this, well done!
This is so beautiful❤️
This is a very cute video, and something I can relate to as well. I loved the stop motion animation. Very nice job!
This so beautiful video!
Beautiful. But I got kind of freaked out by the book count. So many books, only one lifetime 😯
Beautifully made and very touching 💝
What a beautiful video!
This is so beautiful!
Such a beautiful video! I’m obsessed with the doodles 😍
Okay, this goes to one of my favourite youtube videos ever. LOVED IT.
I love the way you edited this video!!
This is so beautifully made. Thank you 😊 \nMay I ask what music you used in the background?
Such a wonderful video!
this is so lovely! 💛
Amazing video!!!! It's very different from what you usually do, I love it!
this is so cute!
Thank you for making this. Love it!
It hurts how clod your words are towards those books. If I've ever decided to do a video like this, I'd be crying because of how sorry I am.
Love this so much <3
This is so cute! Love it!
Sanne I have CHILLS. Also I can't bear the thought of how few books I'll get to read in my lifetime, I am reading as fast as I can!!
Such a beautiful video, I'm very moved and I don't even know why!
This is so great Sanne 💖
This is a beautiful video !
Sanne, this is soo beautiful! \nI can relate so much lol, although I don’t like giving up on books, they just wander back onto my to-read pile, in the hopes that I’ll eventually come back to them. Especially uni books. I doubt I ever will though. There’s way too many wonderful stories out there that are just waiting for me. :)
This puts me in the right mood for a reading weekend!
this is so beautiful :)
Wow Sanne that video is so great, I'm in love 😍😍
i LOVE this idea
Glad it wasn't just me who didn't read books that were part of a school/college/university course, I was supposed to read Great Expectations for my English Language and Literature A-Level, I never did, I didn't like it, not helped by the fact that it was a crumbling old copy last borrowed from school in 1974 (I started my A-Levels in 1999).
This made me emotional and idk why? Like I feel like I could cry. That was beautiful
that was beautiful! :) you should do more videos like that, i would enjoy them.
This is wonderfully made! I really enjoyed watching (might go back now and whatch it again hihi)
This is gorgeous and amazing!!!
THAT IS SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!
Omg that was so beautiful!
I had a tear???? This was beautifullllllll! 💝
loved this
This was wonderful <3
Beautifully filmed video x
loved this video :D
beautiful video <3
💕
cute
Loved this, Sanne!
I loooove this
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
Great video!
Çok tatlısın💕
This was amazing ❤️
Lovely lovely
Wonderful 😍
beautiful!
I adored this one
This was stunningly done!!!!
super cute!!
loved this!
Loved this
Loved this ❤
Perfectly and beautifully said Sanne ❤️
love this!😍
Love love love this
Ohhh love this. Beautiful.
вау!
THAT WAS SOOOO GREATTTTT!!!!!!!!
Thisss was lovely!
this was awesome!!!!
This is so lovely, Sanne!
Amazing!! <3
Loved this!
This is beautiful! <3
Looooooooooooved this.
Wow this was amazing!
fuck the literary canon created by old, white, straight men. i'd rather be at a party discussing some queer poc authors or something than a book by obe everyone pretends to have read because some senile people think we have to.
Lovely video, Sanne! As I get older I think about this more and try to both read more and not waste time on things I don't really enjoy. I have to add, though, that you should give Middlemarch a chance - it's absolutely full of interesting characters and a world you can absolutely get lost in!
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you really haven't read Tess of the D'Urbervilles because there is nothing to smile about in that book! Bleakest story ever.
This is brilliant😁 ILOVEILOVEILOVE❤❤❤
In American black people are pokemon...why you think police and prisons are always tryin to catch em all?!
This guy is awesome and he's talented. Not much to do with his skin color to become a celebrity.
 he's a rare Pokemon LMFAO
What they don't tell you is that they make him act dumb all the time, sane with Bobby Olugun, and the other Black famous actors on Japan, to poke fun at Black people so it isn't as good as they make it seem
*Two homosexual black I guess*
if i remember correctly there was a black samurai that worked for oda nobunaga and people from all around japan would go to see him to the point where some people got trampled to death, i think some servants of nobunaga when they first met tried to see if they could wash the black off of him, probably need some fact checking on that but im pretty sure those are things that happend
Isn't this video a replay from like five months ago?
2 black guys speaking fluent japanese. I love this
I can be famous just for being black and speaking japanese.\n\n*on the fucking plane now*
this guy is too cool
the thing is Japanese girls like BBC
It may seem irrelevant but I must point out that on the daytime show oha sta he is the only male on the set wearing something ridiculous! Baby steps for equality I assume....
This will give a lot of filthy weeaboos  hope lmao.
Not only this guy but both Jero an Enka singer and Chris Hart  a J-pop singer are accepted and very popular in Japan as well.\nJapanese people might be xenophobia on the whole for sure, but seems like most of them are not racist.\nJust examine the Art Blakey's anecdote, or W.E.B.Du Bois' column he wrote for The Pittsburgh Courier.
to black guys speaking Japaneses in Japan thats a big deal
They forgot to ask him the most important question. Who in the right mind leaves Goldman Sachs for some talent agency?
they are not racists they just don't know wtf
Sweet talk, “I don’t think Japanese are racists”. Dream on! Try to settle in Japan outside the world of entertainment ....
Damn, these Vice reporters know so many languages it blows my mind. I can barely handle one, and they seem to know whatever needs to be spoken.
I wish you could go into even more depth. Double this segment! Maybe Japan is more use to seeing white guys, but over in China that wasn't the case for me. Everyone would stare at me like I'm a walking museum. I would have people ask if they could take a picture with me at least once a week. Mind you, I wasn't living in the big major cities (Bejing, Shanghai, Guangdong). They'd get weirded out even more when I'd start speaking in Mandarin. They'd still try speaking English to me even when I'd respond in Mandarin. I definitely get what he's saying about the 'train thing' and no one sitting next to you. It's a bit weird...
Sadly no one will remember him by this time next year, like the formerly famous Atsugiri Jason.
A Brain and a Shell. The Brain can be trained to do anything. But we can't look pass the Shell, The Color.
dont accept multiculturalism japan, you'll regret it
you'll see, when Africa will be 4 times more populated by the end of this century, you'll regret to call them rare pokemon : Visiting Europe you'll only see blacks.
good for you brotha! ✊🏾
Ok why is japan bad for not accepting so many foreigners??
I am sick and tired of hearing about this multiculturalism bullshit everyday! Stop! just STOP!!!
Whyd they bringin whites into this. Bruv it meant to be black vs asians.
This is awesome 👏🏽 you gotta start somewhere and yes kids tv is probably the best place.
pokemon or no pokemon, get that money bruuuuh!
The hair and pokeman comment was funny! Lol
I just wanna know how the women are treating him over there ;)
There’s that chef hat hairdo again. Lose it already. It’s your job to report the news not be the news!
This vice guy is way funnier than the guy in the video. And not just in japan, his brand of humor transends all borders and barriers.
He's a rare pokemon. 😂
The interviewer's hair is distracting & looks stupid, & he's stupid for keeping that in a job like this.
so what i can speak scottish english and american lol
Seriously? 4 min for this shit? You want us to watch it or not?
I want to learn Japanese.  Sounds cool
>used to work for goldman sachs\nKILL THE BOURGEOISIE
Japan here I come
Japanese would be smart to kick him out
Nothing special about it. Just one black dude being on Japanese tv show. So what?  Yes, of course he should be able to speak Japanese he lives in Japan.
Can I find a video on YouTube with racist comments from white people ??
What a bunch of weaboos
Dang, they're still sporting jheri curls in Japan.
Hell no not this long hair dude again. Viceeeeeeeeeeeeee
Still an outsider who is nothing but a clown
I am very surprised when I hear the host speak Japanese, because I just heard him speak mandarin in the higher brothers video. Like I'm native chinese and have learnt japanese for 4 years and its obvious that this Dexter's Mandarin and Japanese are native level, like he doesnt even have that foreigner accent
“They don’t know how to do black hair” 😂💀.
Japanese :  oh my god, it a nergo
I'm not surprised, Nigerians are a vibrant community in Japan. If I recall I know of a Nigerian boxer whose a daytime talkshow host there and is also fluent in Japanese. I forgot his name but some may know it.
Breaking racial barriers in Japan. Very cool.
@0:18 \nRick? Is that you?
Boy! 2017, Trump is President and this guy is getting famous in Japan, anything is possible! Tune in next week to meet the juggling gay amputee couple that're taking Russia by storm!
Congrats on being made fun of dude
Bruh I respect your story and everything but what is up with that line up my guy? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
That is weird, I've now seen 3 black guys speaking fluent Japanese in less than a week. 2 on this video, & one on some PBS show about Japanese textiles.
REALLY good video. I had NO idea things were like this over there.
My god shes beatiful
He has nice lips
He a mark
*I get the impression they're laughing at him, not with him.*\nI'm also getting the impression that he knows that and Vice knows this, and they tried to film this in a way that didn't show that.
Bobby ologun is my favorite black tv personality in japan
Why did you feel the need to mention he's black? I'm I supposed to give a shit?
Thumbs down for not putting or saying his name almost anywhere.
It's a good thing you really hammer home the fact that he's black.  Really touches the identity high notes.\n\nThe interviewer reminds me of Kid 'n Play.
Something i thought I'll never see, two Black guys speaking Japanese
he appears as tho he doesnt want to be in the kids show... so low energy
The crazy thing is that he didn't study Japanese before getting a job there, yet his fluency is so good.
Vice has the most unique segments\nSeriously interesting stuff
niggu?\nneegeiru?
What a trailblazer!
誰こいつ？
That's funny seeing two black dudes conversing in Japanese. \n\nそれは会話2人の黒い男を見て面白いです
4:30 nigga please hahaha
Same shit in Estonia tho
this dude seems like a caricature smfh
looks like Josh from JKparty😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dude looks miserable
Good for him. 👍
wait whos this dexter thomas guy?
Impressive! Keep on keeping on!
Haha that Pokemon joke cracked me up bad 😂😂😂
Both these niggas wild for these hairstyles
Guys the original Weaboo
Wut he a gud boi. Din do nothin
Naija forever!
Damnnnnnnn his Japanese though.
Why you funny? Cos you black
wtf\ndisgusting !! niggerz , go home , yankee bastard metis inbred pig , go home , kaijin , shine , zenmetsu , kiru , kutabare kasu\nkusoga ; normies , youre fucking disgusting as well , and have std , kek , you fucking dumbcunt shabbo$ goyim shiksaz
I greatly respect anyone who paves the way for diversity and give talented people a platform despite what others may say about it.
No racist but class segregation  & discrimination, which is unfortunate in Japan.\nAlso Japanese shop owners are subject to yakuza protection. Women are still 2nd class.\nGood & bad in Japan.
Nigga stole ma bike
No diversity send in a sjw feminists and bicycle lives matter!!
Many people hate perfumes in Japan. So when you come to Japan for sightseeing, we hope in half of usual.
My cousin live in japan (shes black), when she goes out into the public people ask her Can i touch your skin? or Can i touch your kids?. What do you think about that?
日本語字幕も出してもらえたら嬉しかったです。
Leave Japan for the Japanese\nbad reputation for accepting foreigners doesn't have the best reputation for diversity\nHow are those bad things? Diversity is cancer. Japan is better without africans and arabs
I like that... I don't think Japanese people are racist! I think they just don't know! 😂 I think whites are the same way they just don't know...🤔
Im 16 right now and I ain't really had a bad life it's been good just always been short on money so my family struggles a little and this film really helped me because   recently I've not been in the right state of mind like I've been on the edge of throwing away my life and getting involved in things I shouldn't because of the way society is nowadays it just glamorises this kind of badman life and I was seriously considering getting involved in it like one sentence and my life could've been changed In a moment but this film brought me back to reality it really did and I feel it saved me it's a great message man and I think more people need to see this
Excellent.
Thug Life !! L.O.V.E !!
yo, the fucking second beat, the orchestral one, it is outta this world.. surely the instrumental is out there somewhere? anyone got it? fucking gassed
mad
Good
Sick and fire 🔥😝
🙌🏽
Thomas looks like hakkz
🙌
rudeboi shut up
nice
whaT a video..👐
Luv this, nice job! Would've liked a longer, focused film with more depth, details and showing the climb to success. A more diverse cast would have been 👌 Powerful, necessary, poignant message that (I hope) will hit home for those who need it. Congrats to all involved with this project. Salute!!
stormzy release this song as a single so I can listen to this all the time som1 do it plz

Oasis made rock n roll \nStormzy MADE Grime ! \n\nFucking epic on so many levels
Oh damn this actually got more than one dislike.
You killed someone???
Lukaku🔥🔥🔥
Lukaku is on top. Whats the bald man doing in the barbershop?
more of a long music video than a film
When KSI and Lukaku have a child
Jheez, what a role model this man is. GQ man of the year? No-one came close....
This is brilliant Stormzy.
One  of   the best films I have ever seen that combines the blood of the street with the spirit of philosophy. Who  Jah bless...tindrum13
Wow this will explode. This is amazing.
Much love from the states fam
New album from Bugzy and geovarn check this out is lit \nhttps://youtu.be/CoIa__NqNkE
2 WAYS ON THE STREETS SHITS YOU BE DEAD OR PRISON MOST DEFINITELY.
Stormzy just tells the truth about everything its what grime should be
yea stormzy we're gonna need a separate video for bad boys
which songs are in there?
Basit is my mate goes to same school
This is basically a bunch of raps this aint a movies
Nice...love the message nuff love from Ny❤️
Stormzy Just raised the bar like if you agree 💪
God didn't give you to hands to sit around praying 😶
Message in the beginning was so amazing
The people chatting shit about this album don't get it. Stormzy went against the demand for a hard banger album and wanted to make something that he actually wanted to make. This has a lot more meaning than other UK rap albums. It's an excellent album.
Tony is Konan in 20 years (only in looks)
I swear the boy goes to my school 😂
This goes hard, soooooooo hard, I Finna watch this again that how good it is.
What is the first song called
Is there no heights that the problem won't reach...
Stormzy should do when plan b did with ill manors release and album make a film filmed with the music
rate this so much wish it was longer will definitely win awards
Best short film I ever watched
THIS IS SOME GOOD SHIT RIGHT THERE
that womans voice at the start though...fucking hell...no one talks like that
This man is MY HERO.
may the GOD OF JEHOVA guide you? this is a video to misguide you all god does not have a god. following things like sheep becuase it sounds good. educate your minds you fools. www.evilbible.com
The young man has got his head screwed on, a blessed message. Respect stormzy
massive message being sent out by stormzy. man is real and a perfect example that it doesnt matter were you are from who your around and what your involved in. its up to you to choose your path find your power your energy and create your own faith and strength and defeat your demons and decide are you worth or waste .

THIS SONG WILL WIN SOME TYPE OF AWARD. \nInstagram @therealangelafang
Did anyone else notice lines from other artists in the dialogue? \n\nGo back and watch it again...
the concept of this is so revolutionary in grime, making productions like this is really giving grime the right vision that these mc's dj's producer's arent all gangsters involved in crime or living up to that steereotype, it shows the talent this genre called 'Grime' has real raw talent who can make big movements and make good money and make a success out of it \n\nbig up stormzy for showing people how much potential is in GRIME
Lame af
Stormzy just set new levels for the scene!!! This is Heavy 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Gwaaaan B!!!!
Nothing beats days like this :) Thanks for being a huge part of everything we do. Smile More :)

Do it roman no cutting vlog
I see them wearing Logan Paul's merch but not Jakes but Logans is dope but also so is jakes
Hey dude your the best ever u have brought me up from the ground me an my girl just lost our little one before it was even born u are keeping me going an help me out an she want me to let u know her name is Cindy an mine is Justin Adams on little girl wasgoing to be born at the end of October right on hollween but ifucan keep doing these broogs there the great an maybe u could thing ofsomething to say to help the to of us get through this keep doing your job I been watching u forever I have had a lot of set backs an everything but I am not letting it keeps us down so if u could let us know how we can get through October together its going to be hard thanks man your the best god bless keeping we need more people like your fly an friend to make to world a better places
I like the white hat style and I hope it comes in the mint color
In the side yard he should build another garage to store the quad bikes and stuff
Kane's a fan of Logan Paul
she is so cute
You know your kids sick of u when he wears maverick merch
Can you pay with English mony
Zeus would love the suite case❤️
Theres one thing i can say this is one of the most positive families out there i love it. I get up and all i want to do is go and watch the vlog but i have to wait till school is over to watch it after a bad day a school i really enjoy watching the vlogs like every other vlog. :) Roman if you ever see this it would make my day.
Ramp your suit case in the swimming pool
I love how much the boys love Cora and I am sorry is I spelt it wrong. But I just wanted to say I love how much the boys love her
Roma Atwood how many bikes do you have
Who else saw Kane's shirt maverick?!!
Why do they always have Logan Paul's merch on
You guys got to chill tf out if he hasn’t posted In 2 days chill tf out he’s trying to care for his baby and other things around the house like construction and the shop and for his pets like calm down guys damm
You guys just made my birthday love all of you and I'll watch u guys all day
Jesus Christ that's an ugly baby hahahaha Hahahah
Roman you get me up everyday and I've been going through a lot at school and you've helped me up everyday
Logan Paul and roman should make a Roman Logan merch line
Help me to help u u all sub to me and I sub to u
that bag was $1200 and he was ok with them taking his money😂
I want the merch soo bad but just can't afford
Man I really like that teal one
She's so cute
Roman and Logan should work together again
Omg Cora is absolutely perfect!!! This family is complete with her! Btw it totally sounded like she was sayin ice cream omg adorable! Also my Roman and Brit I absolutely LOVE these laid back hangin around the house kinda days!!!
Being another Smile More Store but it's just for your toys and not for your merch
Sub for a sub people
that was one of your best videos!!!
Cora is the cutest baby ever!!!!! She is going to be the best YouTuber ever!!'
Is it me or is Caine wearing Logan Paul's merch?!
Why is no one talking about how beautiful Cora's eyes are? <33333333333
I love the mint color
Can you add me on messenger because I added you but you haven't
you go Roman
How old is cora
i love family vlogs theyr4e my favourite
Ayyyyyeeeeeee  da Maverick Merch
Smile More 😃
Kane's wearing maverick merchandise
Stop at 50 secs
You are soo rich
Is keane wherein a mavrik shirt
denem dan
800 mins of laughing. Mr. Roman
Kade has maverick merch
Family time 😇🤗
Coraaaaa 😫😍😍😍
fuck romanatwood
YO KANES IN THE LOGANG AND HES REPPIN THE MERCH
LOVE YOUR VIDS ROMAN
cora is so cute
I love Kane’s shret
Muscle shirts are for muscles
Grabs knife\n\n\n\n\nHi cora😂😂😂😂
nosh has a maverick shert lol so cute loganforlife
She is growing so fast
I wish you wouldve dropped that camera in the water gosh
i saw a commercial for that suitcase a few days ago. lmao
You should colab with the funk bros
Kane's wearing a MAVERICK SHIRT
I well want a motor bike I'm allowed one but mum can't get me one 😩
I won't one
Did you see that came was wearing a maverick T-shirt
she is getting so big!
Roman you need to do a fan mail unboxingg!!!!!
The entire vlog I could not get over the muscle shirt 😂😂 and white? Whattttt
Hi I have been watching u for 3 years
Kane's silver tooth is in the same spot as mine
I have a friend that h's on of your shirts two of them
Love when you show food in the vlogs hahaa
I bet roman that Cora will be able to talk
I do not think that suitcase is ment for adults
First of all how is his channel dying
Irelevence for  Roman is going to be a bitch
Smile laugh live love dream be amazing smile more☺😊😀😁😃
I have a baby brother and he is 10 months old
IS THAT MAVRICK MERCH I SEE?!?
When Roman got the knife then went to say hi to Cora, I got so scared! Oml😂 love u Roman!
I would  love  one  I am a XL
Cora is already on lock having big bros means your on lockdown no boys until your old lmao 😂 kidding
You should do the dye hats that say smile more that would be assume I would bye one but my family does not have a lot of moneu
Wait, is the baby girl named Cora?
The kittens were so cute but big when they first got them
I would fuck that baby soo hard
I want u to adopt me
You should get a second garage
I have a smile more shirt cryed when I got it we all love romen and Brit
Hi Roman I was asking can you do a breast cancer hat
White girls on barz.... Gawd oh gawd
u who made this music video are a slave. break free my black brother. money aint your friend, find Jesus my brother. from a white brother in Australia. find peace man!

Thats a trailer of a sex tape right there 😉😉
Where do you even find these girls lol
Heard this a week after it came out and thought it was shit but now that I’m listening to it more, i fucking love it.
So nobody gonna mention thug said he hide in the closet
Song of the year #BigFactz
Didn't kodak have another version of this song on snap when he got his teeth done back in june...
Get me on that boat
Damn I was a young ass nigga back then but life in 2003-2007 musta been dope
This is some lame ass phony franchise fake ass hip hop bull shit that is horible i could rap better ob acid after a fifth if whisky and smoke a bow to my head
So there goes another dumbed down word! 'Relationship!!' What a scream. Nice beats though. These guys are geniuses!
This looks like the same camera from Swae Lee Swang
This video quality reminds me when the cable  cost only 19.99 a month or 199.99 for a year subscription. Lol
Girls look like they came from an ad on Craigslist
They got my boy lilduke on the yacht too oh snap
Should have just hired gab3 to film it
Future and Thug you are best niggas yo 🤘🏿😎
This is like mixing weed with hash

Recommend me any other song like this ???
Wolf of Wall Street
Is this porn or something
I say this to my girls
The clip doesnt match with the song IN MY OPINION.
This remind me of Girls gone wild commercials
912 people don't need to cut some girls off cuz they got NONE

Here you see real bitchies.\nBut i want to fck them.
she sucking my dick, I'm hiding in the closet and people say he not gay wtf
Here before those fake fans claim to fuck with thugger.
what kind of glasses future is wearing ?
Feel like I just watch a girls gone wild music video wtf 😂😂
Is somebody gonna help Future or what!
Adele's simple chords inspired so many songs.
Bruh dis a smooth as beat I'm high af to dis bih 🏄
Everyone go check out our recent song! 😝
I need a video for You Said
A joint future and young thug project would be dope
What's the name of the original song?
Was She Giving Thug Top @ 1:27 ? Ion think y’all peeped 😦
Thug actually decided to show up for this music video 🤔😂
Here before a million

Aye this is fire tugger
You already kno Jerrika gon break up with Thug after seein this LOL
And people thought young thug couldn't rap... Now he rapping with Camilla cabello
It would be interesting if the results are better if filmed with 60fps
Could you not have just opened windows media player for the same effect haha
I ran across this video today and it looks very similar to this but is using a completely different method. Its called the shape of music, He has more information on how it works in the description. Are these two methods similar in any way? https://youtu.be/8TxTilR7xu8
Really nice idea! What would be also very interesting to know, is if you can predict a composite wave form from two separate ones by addtion of the xy traces. Also what would be an effect of an offset related to that.\n\nIn a similar sense ... what would happen if one could take the surface of a disco ball onto a speaker and shine light onto it, or several lasers? What I wonder, would it be possible to see some complete image of the membrane?
You mean auto not manual lol
OMG MY FRIEND AND I JUST TRIED IT AND IT'S AMAZING WTH WHO THOUGHT OF THIS I JUST WANT TO HUG THAT PERSON
This is called a lissajouls figure
6:09 >i don't think it's because the laser pulses, otherwise i would have noticed it watching it live\n\nNo, you really wouldn't have.  \n\nDiodes can be PWM pulsed very quickly, faster than the human eye can hope to see.  LEDs for example are typically pulsed at thousands of pulses per second, the human eye thinks it's just dimming but in reality it's turning full-on & full-off thousands of times per second.
The single frame with many lose ends, could it be because the laser leaves the mirror?
My first thought would be rolling shutter, but it doesn't have the right artifacting. It could be the physical properties of the mirror fragment itself (such as it being too small, the glass taking an internal reflection, etc.). A high speed camera would really be the only thing I could think of to answer that question.
While this a beautiful demo, I can't help but feel that the mirror shard's asymmetry affected the vibrating membrane and gave an unpure reading of the tones you used. Also, why place the mirror somewhere other than the center of the membrane? From the Chladni experiment we know certain sections of the membrane vibrate differently than others for a given time, why not place mirrors at nodes & antinodes and repeat the experiment and compare the laser paths? \n\nSemi-related, I know you're interested in visualizing sound, I think liquid cymatics could be a rad project for you (especially using mercury on a speaker with lasers)
Instead of you talking to the camera do voiceover. We came here for the laser not for you.
What if you put a Shepard tone
It will be awesome if you do the same but with Jerobeam Fenderson’s Oscilloscope Music!\nMaybe the patterns produced with that music can be visible with your laser-mirror system.
I'm pretty sure (correct me if i'm wrong) that the segmentation on the freeze frame is due to the way a laser works. it pulses a light on a tube of some crystal, the electrons absorb the energy then emit it again slowly at all the same frequency and direction. then it pulses again. so maybe there's your answer. I'm not sure though
This was really good. Gj
I made some java-script programs a few years ago to draw Lissajous figures and cycloids which look similar to some of those. Sorry that but you need a khan academy user to view them. https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/mouse-operated-spline-oscilloscope/5921753556320256
This was so cool. Instantly my mind jumped to string theory and what strings of vibrating energy look like.
Discount oscilloscope music?\n\nAlso, does the position of the mirror affect the shape? My hypothesis would say yes, however I don't have the resources to experiment at this moment.
Use oscilloscope music. I want to see if it will still create the same effect.
Those are Lissajous (after the mathematician who first described them)patterns. I thought they were purely theoretical being the quotient of waves. But they do appear in multidimensional membranes as seen here.
Put the laser and speaker in a vacuum and slowly decrease the amount of air and observe how the patterns change
The extra loose ends might just be the laser moving momentarily back up the path it came, but then I guess you would see it in person?
I'd recommend imagining them as 3D shapes, it really changes the experience.
You should glue 2 bits of mirror on and use 2 separate lasers to get 2 different cross sections of the same wavelengths
Try a combination of 741 Hz, 528 Hz, and 432 Hz. I wonder what kind of complex pattern that might make...
I think the reason why you get more than one starting point on the laser path is that the mirror turns away from the laser beam a number of times during the time the shutter is open, since the diaphragm would be vibrating at a higher frequency than the shutter of the camera, right?
Back in the day, a friend of mine took an old black and white tv set and used it as a basic cathode ray tube wiring the left channel of a stereo across the vertical control and the right channel across the horizontal (or something line that).  The effect was very very similar to what you have here.
Water on a speaker would also show you what you are looking for.
You just made the language of the future
I'm a laser geek the reason for this pulse effect is some lasers are either pulsed or continuous pulsed causes it's to flicker
its a analogue laser show.
the speaker used in this video is a UE Roll, from experience i know its a very good portable speaker :)
the multiple breaks is due to rolling shutter\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP1elMR5qjc
This reminds me of Lissajous Patterns. It is cool how you are generating them with a single signal source. Using an oscilloscope, one must use two signals to control the x and y position of the beam. However, in your setup, the x and y position is controlled by the orientation of your mirror! Wonderful video  :3
I want to challenge u to make a video using the speaker and laser
I'd love to see how multiple lasers (perhaps different colours to make analysis easier) interact with each other and if one balloon membrane would have sympathetic vibrations from another speaker. Another interesting experiment would be to see how bowl shape, size, and material affects the result.
Ths reminds me of the experiments we had with cathode ray oscilloscopes.
What are the notes to draw genitals, butts, and the Batman symbol ?
I thing that the reason for multiple starting points is rolling shutter.
I think you and mackenwells may have unwittingly created a whole new field of ufo-conspiracy/paranormal investigation.
A front-silvered mirror would prevent that faint second line (from the laser bouncing off the glass) above the bright one (the laser bouncing off the silvering). Take apart an old SLR camera or flatbed scanner and you'll find some tiny ones inside.
you should do the descending tune illusion through the mirror!
You should use a really strong laser to see what note is played most in music
wow that's beautiful and really interesting
The laser hits the end of the little mirror fragment. It is not the camera. Its the light hiting the ballon.
6:15 camera stacks 5 motions in 1 frame\nlaser did not hit the mirror? maybe ...\nlaser beam pulse? maybe\ncamera shutter captures the motion most used by the laser, maybe the laser moved faster in that area, you had one sound that made the mirror move sto fast for a brief moment and jumped from that FINISH to the next START ... camera to slow\nmirror moved to fast? maybe, but it still would have had a small trace ... you can't reset the position without a trace ... maybe the camera did not pick that up \nnice brain exercise :)
you said manual instead of automatic
OMG this is so awesome!\nNow we need to hook up a neural network powered AI\nput the goal to: awesome geometrical shapes\nand give the AI the sound controll\nthen see what happens!
Which waveform(s) are being used here? I'm very curious as I'd love to give this a go at home.
Does this work with music too, or just solid frequencies?
shouldn't you have put the mirror in the exact middle of the balloon for most exact results?
At ~ 5:28 when there is a short shutter speed and the contour is broken up, some parts are longer. This suggests that the speed of the laser image is changing along its path, it would be interesting to think of a way of showing this intentionally and looking if there is any further pattern to the behaviour. Perhaps intentionally strobing the laser to produce a finely dotted line to see spacing between them? Any way of changing to colour would be good, the only way I can think of is again strobing the laser but using a 'white' laser with three diodes that fire sequentially.\n\nAlso, I wonder how some of these patterns hold up against solving the displacement of the surface of the balloon using bessel functions etc.\n\nAnyway great video as always
Wonder what this would look like with a smoke screen
This is how aliens communicate
Lisadues loops with the radial and circumferal oscillations? Rather than a ballon , I wonder if two elastic bands at 90' and a stereo setup could give xy control? Add in a mosfet for controlling the laser and that might make a very inefficient display.
For those of us without Perfect Pitch would have been neat if you'd added what frequency was playing to produce each shape.
Play despacito and see what shit it makes
3:30 that's actually magnetic field
Is there a way to predict a frequency of a certain shapes, like square, tesseract etc?
Commented code is great, why would people be happy about there being few comments? Inside joke?
This was super cool and interesting! Thanks.
But can it run doom
Some of the patterns that look distorted or to have many starts and ends are caused by the rolling shutter effect. You can google it if you want to know more details about it and why it makes fast movement look distorted
Shouldn't the laser pulse at the frequency of the electricity it uses? Then if you shutter speed is not at the same ratio you would see awkward start and end points
be skipping parts like it a porn video
The CIA window-prism surveillance technique is pretty interesting.\n\nThe balloon and the captive airspace will Considerably distort the output and introduce vibratory modes, but as a fun desktop oscilloscope, no doubt some fun can be had.
That's beautiful and  impressive.\nDo you think you could be making mathematical model to invert the experience and pull out the sound that certain shapes would make?\nLet me know if you are interested by this idea
Idon't usually leave a comment to compliment a video, but this one is just way too good. Nice work Steve.
rolling shutter effect could be the cause of the multiple beginnings and ends of the laser
Multiple starting and ending points is due to the cahracteristics of modern shutters. When the shutter speed is turned up  to a certain point, the sensor does not sense light simutaniously.
Might rolling shutter be a cause of the broken ends?
Should have tried different wave shapes rather than just a sine wave (for example square, triangle, sawtooth . . . etc).
At 6:00 I belive its because how cameras dont take their pictures in one shot, explained wonderfully in smarter every days video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNVtMmLlnoE
You should do this but film it with a slow motion camera so you can see what path the laser is following.
I bet this would be fun while tripping.
This was the coolest thing I've seen in a while. Original and interesting! =D
Multiple stop start I think maybe due to rolling shutter effect. Fantastic explanation here https://youtu.be/eMJFpj-0ogA
film these with a high speed camera please
This is cool
Mesmerizing
my brain exploded at exactly 2:52
THIS IS AMAZING
You should do oscilloscope music
cool!!
Rolling shutter.
how about 60fps?
Try playing jerobeam fenderssons music with this
Looks like an oscilloscope
Reminds me a bit of oscilloscopes.
6:18 Rolling shutter effect maybe?
Should try playing jerome fender somethingings ossicliscope musice
SLOW MOTION
This is basically a homemade oscilloscope
Rolling shutter effect?
Deadmau5 will love this
This is genius!
Laser oscilloscope
Awesome video, your voice reminds me of Johny Ive
At 2:05, the resonant frequency is probably that of the room you're in, since it sounds like it's about 110-120 hz which corresponds to a wavelength of 3.12-2.87 meters.

Can you try the clothes on in your next one so we can see how you style them 😭😍😘
Men are just pain in the arses, so at least wearing their clothes they're good for something that was brilliant 😂😂
that glow!!
Babe you should try on the items so we can see what they look like on you!!! :D <3
That highlight though 🔥
How come when I go to primark all I can find is a pair of two different sized shoes and a ugly jumper
Love all of these. You literally want me to go off sick tomorrow and sneakily run to Primark 💁🏻😂
Ugh I’m trying to save money and you’re out here making videos like this 😩😂
I need those burgundy heels & that royal blue handbag! Obsessed 😍
Wish you had done prices for everything
I need to go to  primark 😭 thank u love
Those court shoes are a major Gianvito Rossi dupe... ☺️👍🏻
How much was the mushroomey pink skirt with zips?  💓
I was in London a week ago, and  of course I went to Primark and buy and buy and buy a lot of clothes, I was so happy in that store.
I love their Floyd tshirt
What I wanna know is have you not watched pulp fiction?! Xxxxx
Mushroom pink? 😂😂😂
LOVED this vid as I can never find the good stuff in primark (it's like searching for diamonds in A LOT of rough) - gonna head to Primange v soon now!! Can you pleasee do a Zara haul? Think you'd find lots of great stuff, not just casuals but also for going out/clubbing (throw back to the Zara white lace bralette you wore a few years ago or something) xxx
Would love a try on haul x
Loveeee your hauls, if you could do ones from like online shops like PLT mssguided etc, that'd be fab, your style is always on point!!
Pointless to do a haul if you're not trying things on 😰
I wish Primark would do an online site and ship everywhere!
Please show us how you style these pieces next time!😍
Are you ok? Like is everything alright at home? 😂 But you're right, those 3 pack underwear sets are so fab
Darling,where is this Pink Floyd t shirt from,it looks gorgeous on you
them fluffly shoes are a nightmare 😂 fluff just falls off in tuffs and ends up everyyywere :( 🙈
How much is the red jumper?! ❤️❤️❤️

Love your channel ❤️ it was kinda difficult to see items like the jumpers that you were holding
Whenever I go to primark I never find anything 🤦🏽‍♀️😭

Men are just pains in the arse's 😂😂
Why the fuck would anyone spend £200 in primark?
Piss of if girls didn't have men the human race would die out because girls wouldn't be able to reproduce you daft prick
I would love if anyone could support me! I have a you tube channel and my aim for creating videos is to help people overcome their insecurities! x I have a birthmark on my face and I want to show others to embrace it! xx I hope people can support me :)
AHHHHH😱 I'm literally poor and spend like £500 shopping for clothes and stuff, primark must be cheap af! Heading to Oxford Street this weekend
You should do a collab with @imogenation !!!

Omg haven’t you ever watched pulp fiction!?! Amazing film - must watch 💕

Love your Pink Floyd top I went to the Pink Floyd exhibition on Tuesday in London
Definitely should of got involved in the beauty section! Gutted you didn't show any finds there. The brushes and make up is as up there as the clothes
She reminds me of me so much! I absolutely love baggy jumpers and buying from the men's section! I also have that pulp fiction tee and I bought it in a large too 🤣 the yellow baggy jumper is a must!!! I'll be getting that when I go in Primark next week lol
Would of made sense to actually try the stuff on. Also what on earth is up with the eyebrows?
Why don't you get a real job instead of posting shit on YT.
Amazing babe ❤ would love to see more haul style videos from you!!
You're actually amazing - totally agree about mens clothing might as well use them for one thing 😏 xo
I find it funny how Hollywood always cast pussies like Travolta to play gangster types like Gotti lol...
No.. this man whore a suit that made him a women
this will never top the gotti movie from 1996, also imo travolta trying way to hard with his ''mean face'' lol. and why they make a fag play john gotti, mafia is very much against gays
royal with cheese bet not fuck this up cause it looks pretty good
Damn Scientology is sucking the life out of him looks horrible
😂 how can you take this movie seriously when John travolta is in it!
what a strange but interesting choice casting Travolta. Will check it out. I really liked Armand Assante's portrayal.
This real? It isn’t a joke?
I can't believe a movie was made about this criminal scumbag.
this is a insult... i knew most of the original gangsters and half of this isn't even true.. other then the hit on Big Paul.
This is just a remake.
Dumbest possible actor to remake Gotti. Armand Assante did it best and it should've been left at that. Now you have a dimple chinned brunette doing Gotti? Fuck outta here
Thumbs down. John Travolta's acting is overdone in this; he's not at all convincing as Gotti. The trailer was painful to watch.
What gay rumors? I don't know about why John did all that stuff like kissing the guy by the plane. This is Oscar worthy stuff. Real acting. You forget it's Travolta.
Travolta. He will be the best Gotti yet. He never made a bad movie his entire life.
I'LL SEE IT but this movie will bomb and be critically panned.
Gotta say it looks very good.
Ill watch it, but I already think gotti with armand assante, anthony quinn, frank vincent, vincent pastore, and william forsythe is awesome
oh hell yeah! It's kind of like seeing Vincent grow up... It's nice to see Travolta in a gritty role again. I am Wrath was good but it was sad too.
We ride together. We die together. Bad boys for life....
This is going to be the truth...
This origanal movie is free on youtube seatcg gotti movie
All nonsense ... died in a cell alone  a bum loser ..no money is worth that
Can't back someone who supports a murdering cult.....
this movie looks like it is going to suck.  Travolta looks and acts NOTHING like John Gotti.  The HBO film GOTTI with Assante looks like it is clearly superior.
Thank God real movies about real people are still being made.
John Travolta is aiming for the Oscars
he really looks like him tho
John Travolta as Gotti... WOW, what a waste of money xD
honestly when you put this next to the one with  Armand Assante, this looks like a cheaper rip off. i highly doubt Travolta can be better Gotti than Assante
HA!
Looks like  a b movie
Story not good this movie
I'll give it a chance
The trailer looks interesting but it seems like it doesn't have even half the authenticity the HBO movie did.
Love Travolta but he was the wrong choice for this role. John Gotti's voice was so much deeper and he was more handsome. John Gotti would flip the fuck out if he new they cast the guy who played leading roles in the musicals Grease, and Hairspray to play him in a movie.
He looks nothing like him.
oh gee , another fucking movie about this scumbag. Oh, and let's cast the worst person in the world to play him. What an original title. Direct to DVd wal mart discount bin.
Typical Hollywood bullshit.  They denounce violence but, make the most bloody made up crap.  It's in the name of art folks so, it's OK!!  Travolta looks convincing too....
John travolta is gonna make this movie suck!!! He can not play a john gotti they neededto get a real italian from the nyc area who understandsthe culture travolta is not the guy for that part
This trailer pretty much summarizes the entire movie.
Stop glamorizing criminals you pedophiles of hollywood
We already know the story waste of time to see this 👎
10 million dollar budget. I Hope it's a good movie
Anything involving the Legend himself John Gotti im in
This makes no sense. This movie has been made already. Armand Assante did it best.....TRAVOLTA ISNT EVEN ITALIAN!! It better with REAL Italian actors!! The previous movie was authentic in the way the actors could portray the characters. I don't even want to see it. I'd rather just put in the old film and watch it.
enough already with these corny ass mafia movies please leave that shit in the 90 s .  pathetic
This is the kinda movies John Travolta should have been doing his whole career.
John Travolta is just too corny for me
Ruined the entire damn movie. We know he becomes the head of the family, he kills his friend that is accused of being an FBI informant, and he ends up in prison.
Jon Gotti would not be happy with this. They shoulda got Ray Liota
When does this movie come out
I lack the proper words to describe how truly awful this looks like it’s going to be.
I really Gotti not see this. See what I did there
No cause something came in the mail today. Deez Nuts! Ha, Gotti.
is this supposed to be a scary movie?
Hmmm, looks pretty good.  I'll wait for the reviews.  I will have to temporarily suspend my boycott of current Hollywood films & celebritards.  Travolta's constant scowl seems rather exaggerated in this trailer.  I checked out MANY images of Gotti and he never looked quite that mean all the time.  It is interesting that Travolta and Tom Cruise, both closeted gay Scientologists, have new films out.  The church must need money.
Another trailer which shows basically the  WHOLE FUCKING MOVIE. I hate it!!!
I don't care how good this movie is - I refuse to watch anything Travolta and Cruise, since they belong to an abusive Cult - Scientology - and they choose to ignore its abuses.  They can go to hell.
I don't think I've ever seen a trailer which gives more away...
is it just me or does he look a bit like schwarzenegger here?
Esta mierda de trabolta o trebol es siempre lo mismo pura cagada de zorrillo pinches directores no saben buscar gente que traiga reating pinche viejo no vale verga y ahi lo traen.
*HA! GOTTI!*
Really? JOHN TRAVOLTA?
I’ve been waiting for this Travolta #faceoff #phenom #getshorty
Corny
Ha
Holy Travolta! It's Teflon Don
not a John Travolta role. dude looks odd.
Dats a Nice :)

Having a preschooler and a school age child does keep a Mom very busy
Emmy pls pls pls make a video on your Pad See Ew. 😍😍
Emmy, you should get a Soda Stream. Love my fizzy water, and your boys will love the fart noises the machine makes!
No offense but....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAin't nobody got time for that
My favorite thing about this, is that you don't completely cut all the junk out. You don't regularly consume it, but you do indulge
Emmy! Look at these crazy retro recipes! \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolRidiculous/comments/68bsg0/my_day_is_never_too_busy_to_eat_this/  and  http://i.imgur.com/IhExOzx.png\n\nYou have to make them!
I wonder if the seltzer water might be the culprit behind all the burp outtakes :D
I have been waiting so long for another one of these! 😮😄😍
You know when you watch Emmy's videos the hunger strikes
You should have an EmmyMade recipe and meal plans book!
First of all I adore you. You are probably my fave on YouTube, have you tried the POLAR or GOYA brand of flavor seltzer water  it's really good not too strongly flaverd more like an aroma. I'm a pepsi drinker trying to you know kick the habit and it's working.
I thought the bowl in the thumbnail was a colander and I was really confused about how you managed to keep the liquid in.
I love a good handful of nuts
Day 1 - Day 7 Breakfast -Dinner = rice rice and more rice for me :D
How did you change that habit from constant soda to tasteless water? Was the transition hard at first? Sorry to ask, I'm just in the same predicament and I would really like to know how you changed your habit.
I wanna be in her family so I can eat the spicy ramen cuz my mom trippin
I was expecting a burp at the end of the video as I've gotten used to....
Portion control has been a big hurdle for me!! I just get so ravenous when I'm hungry! I started drinking a full glass of water before each meal, and it helps a lot :)
I love fizzy water too! My favorite right now is Topo Chico! Especially the one with lime!
Okay so.. I don't eat half that and I'm 3 times bigger. .. I think I need to eat more rice. ....
Hey Emmy. I love in a small town in Northern MI and I would love to try Natto but I don't know where I can get any. Is there a certain place you get yours from? Thanks😊
I would love to see a La Croix taste test of all of the flavors!!!
What's a 'vegan' chicken pot pie ?
I love food presentation it makes me happy when my plate looks pretty lol
I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old as well!
Do you buy fizzy water or do you have a home machine?
2:30 huh, that's kinda weird that's a pretty seasonal Vietnamese dish we only make close to the Chinese New Year, unless they're frozen and thawed.
where did you get the narutomaki?
I love your name!
THAT UDON LOOKS SO GOOD, I'VE BEEN CRAVING SOME, PLEASE TELL US  HOW TO MAKE IT
What are those pink things in the noodle dish
the McDonald’s in my lap suddenly doesn’t seem as appetizing 😂😭
Hey Emmy check out this YouTube channel  Bellaboos lunches the mom makes lunches for her daughter I think you’ll like it
I love fizzy water too. It took me ages when i was young to get used to it but again like you. Didn't like still water! Love adding aople juice or something into it :)
I really like the hello fresh recipes. Are you a stay at home mom?
I'd love to see video recipes for some of these things like the udon noodle soup and the Burmese pickled salad.
Do a video of your daily routines
Love your videos so much 😀😀😀
How do you bite so fast at the end xD
I love, love, love your what you eat in a week videos!!!  And I wish I could live with you, because your meals always look soooo fabulous!!!
Would you show us the burrito method? I would vegify it, but the technique is the same x
I like how small your portions are, especially that sandwhich and bagel. Makes me think I should do that too
I eat one maybe twice a day and I eat less then you and somehow I gain weight. How
Udon noodle (thick udon) soup is incredible and very easy to make. I add lots of fish cake, scallops and bok choy. I add 4 eggs on top and also splash my serving with sriracha sauce...mmm. I make my own chicken bone stock first as my base for the udon.\nGreat video and that's why I love Emmy's diversity with her food to show everyone what is yum-yum to eat in this world.\nCHOMP
When are you going on Hot Ones?
If someone want's an actual opinion about hellofresh,I'm going to write a bit about them since I'm a customer.\nI buy their three-meal boxes.They cost 39 € (In germany), so this option would cost approximately 46 dollars.Their boxes are indeed somewhat pricy,but the recipees are really varied,especially the vegetarian boxes (which I order) are good to try out some new things.I'm a little bit picky when it comes to food and because I paid for the boxes,I actually try new things,which I normally wouldn't do:D.
the end is gold hahaha :D
Watching this video when you're hungry.. it's just pure torture. Everything looks so good.
Seeing the McDonald's there in your video made me feel so much better. I strayed alway from fast food, but now that I'm working and my son started school, I barely have time to do anything. I definitely need to up my healthy food game though.
I assume you also stay very active, what with having the toddlers. I mention that because I intake about half the calories that you do and actually have issues not gaining weight (but I'm a night person, so my outdoor activities are somewhat limited). (Had I waited a few seconds to comment I would have heard you mention the toddlers and going to the gym).
Try to pan fry the sticky rice cake, cut them into slices and fry until golden brown, it's a treat
thank you for sharing. I love drinking lemon water
gym once a week?!! u joking girl dont lie
I'm glad to see that you're not a crazy health nut and slip in some normal food, even a trip to mcD' s. thanks for being a normal person Emmy
i love oatmeal!! thanks to you,and your advice about portion control, i have gotten slimmer than ive ever been, i am so grateful 💕.
Omg I have been watching you since I was in year 7! Now I am in year 12 almost graduating! kdhkaaihdj
Vegan chicken pot pie? How did you do it!!!!!!!!!
Can you make more recipe videos? I mean of normal food not the you made what?
If you still have some of the saft from IKEA (or something concentrated like it) it is absolutely delicious in sparkling water! We used to have it like soda when I was a kid.
3 and 5yr olds! Holy crap ive been subbed to you so long i remember when you were preggo w your first son!
As a person who has had an eating disorder. I can't tell you how nice it is to see someone showing that it is possible to eat normally and not gain weight.
❤️ I love your life ❤️
You're youngest son is 3?!? I remember when you were pregnant in your videos. Aww time flies and you're just casually getting younger. EmmyButton
Some of my coworkers are Cambodian and one or two will bring in homemade food. The rice and pork roll is one of them and it was quite good. the texture can be off putting to some, but I didn't mind it too much
I loved that we could see you explaining things in this video! I like the other videos but I just really liked this style. Also love the way you put your sponsors in, it isn't annoying and it doesn't take up a huge amount of the video which is nice.
I would love to see a video on Lahpet! I had never heard of it til now! I've been cooking a lot lately and I love food but I feel so uninspired making the same old stuff every week, so I'm very interested in anything new. Your channel helps a lot :)
Pad Gra Pow is my favorite Thai dish, by far. *nom*!
CAn you please share your vegan chicken pot pie recipe? As a vegetarian I would love to learn that!
Hi Emmy!  I have been watching and loving your videos for like 3 weeks now. I only just subscribed.  Anyway,  can you suggest some tasty sweet vegetarian eggless recipes for  about say 4 yr olds, maybe something that includes oats/other protein cereal in disguised form. I have a picky eater at home but he enjoys sweets. Love you bye.
lies she didnt eat all that crap from the sponsor liar! and yes soda is nasty after a while of just driniing water or juice
I am so ready for this.
God damn if it's anything like The Lobster count me in
Oh my God Nicole is just EVERYWHERE! So proud of this woman. Congratulations on your recent strings of success!
A24, you had my curiosity. Now you have my attention.
Aint that the dude in Dunkirk ..?
I think I always say this after every trailer but I love A24!
Yorgos Lanthimos is a fucking genius filmmaker
Jesus im so excited for this one!!!
Colin Farrells beard godamn.
So when do we see some deer action in this film?
I seriously want to watch this movie, but I'm afraid it's not going to be shown in mainstream cinemas in Germany :(
Hank Hill voice: 'something's not right with that boy, tell you what
YO EVERYBODY\nIf you liked The Lobster, \nWATCH DOGTOOTH
In a world of relying on loud noises (IT) and unneeded gore (Mother!), A24 is back again to save the day. This is gonna be B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T
I love Yorgos Lanthimos.
And people say there are no more original films
Wow this looks good, and it's coming out on my birthday
I love almost movie you guys have made so far! All original, well done, and entertaining! I'm definitely going to see this one in theaters as well! The only complaint I would have is to not do what you guys did with It Comes At Night for any of your movies ever again. The trailer was misleading and because of that it got trashed on by the casual audience who went to go see it, which is a shame, since it was a really good movie.
lol everyone thinking they're cinephiles because they support A24
Excellent
❤
I agree
Nicole Kidman is literally everywhere now
This looks awesome.
Fucked up.
Absolutely fucking brilliant - that's my kinda review
Young Barry Keoghan is a superb actor.  Loved him in Irish gangland series LOVE/HATE. He has also been in Dunkirk, Trespass Against Us (with Michael Fassbender and Brendan Gleeson) and 71, with Jack O'Connell
The guy from Dunkirk❕❗️❕❗️
I have no idea what is going on but I'm all in.
not as good as the lobster, but still pretty interesting and creepy at some points. never really scary, but the acting is great and it looks good.
One of the best directors right now.
I still don't know anything about the films plot and I can't wait for it. It looks brilliant
Έχουμε καβλώσει!
A24 is best girl
DAAAAD, Bob's dying !
So fucking haunting. Chills.
I am waitingggggggggggggggggg
This looks fucking amazing
Can't wait!
Bless
This looks great
I don't get it.
Love more with hot couple on screen * Nicolin * after watched THE BEGUILED movie
This is the most sinister trailer I have ever seen.
Yes, this one. I wanna see this.
*WE ARE GOING TO WAR GEORGE*
This is going to be so awesome
saw this at TIFF and HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND
How could Barry's name not be mentioned in the end with the rest wtf
Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman were recently in another film together, The Beguiled. It's fantastic, must watch.
The sequel to The Lobster?
I loved that as fucked up as it's looking it's still trying to make you laugh
Oh, look! It's the stairs kid from Dunkirk!
THE SINGING GETS MORE AND MORE CREEPER
can't do less Kubrick-esque
Duuuuuuudee this movies gonna kill it!!!! Love A24
And way to spoil the twist, A24. Good job.
I can’t wait for seeing this’ll movie
Thought he was blind and dead.
GOOSEBUMPS!
That's the little girl from Tomorrowland!
Dunkirk 2: George in Heaven is looking really interesting
Dad your son is fucking dying...I think he needs some help...He is bleeding from the eyes!!!. Shit
please release it in india
Holy shit the cinematography is so good
So God Damn tense I love it
Yorgos Lanthimos is already a legend to me
yall dick riding A24 like they're the ones making these movies.  Give Yorgos Lanthimos some credit here, A24 is just the distributor
So here we r bcoz its from A24 nd we r loving it..hit like if u agree
Such a weird looking movie but definitely gonna check it out out of curiosity
This does look interesting, but the acting seems a little off for how talented the actors are so I assume it was intentional. It just seems like one of those movies where all your questions and the mystery is revealed in a single scene and you could get most of the story in just a few minutes. Its just about the tension and not knowing.
After that movie it comes at night and a ghost story I'll never watch another movie by this shitty ass production company. Worst movies I've seen in a long time and the acting is laughable
why does a24 only make massive piles of shit?

A Slave and a Slave Master CAN NOT pray to the same God!!!
The white supremacist have always used religion to control black people and we've allowed it to happen since slavery. Always forgiving these white supremacist race soldiers for killing innocent unarmed black people.
Black Atheist here. Christianity is a cancer to modern society and made to keep the minds of black people enslaved.
Black and atheist as ever, however I stay gucci down to the socks
Love DL he always says whats on his mind
Shit i know a few black atheists...they believe there's no God but everything is just part of the universe
I think black people process non-belief differently. Generally, whites become Atheists and want to tell the entire world. Many of them come off as having a real ax to grind with religion. Plenty of black people have turned away from religion. We just don't feel the need to broadcast it like that.
Black and atheist AF
Christianity is a religion designed for peasants! I have more respect for (1)Buddhist, (2)Muslims, hell , even(3) Scientologist.  This is why blacks cling on to it. When they fabricated the stories in the book they did it so to control the mass population and  to keep lower class people in check.
YOOHOO....OVER HERE DL!!! I'm black and I am an atheist!!!! And I know a few more! We are DEFINITELY out here, lol!!!
Vaccines changes the dna of the children,  so u add that with gmo products,  bad water, and gay images. We are in a war.
I bet there are plenty of people who go to church every Sunday, sit in the pews, and have a struggle in their heart and mind about whether God truly exists. They go out of routine and from fear of rejection and disownment from family, partners and friends. At least 90% of blacks are religious and are ready to cut your throat if you say you don't believe God exists. So some people keep quiet and just do the routine.
hell is a mythology about Earth, so u might as well let that fear go, G and hit the books. Salute to the OG DL tho on God/Allah/Buddha and Big Mama.
DL? More like Double D L! Look at those fucked up titties of his!
D.L. is correct look at side effects of soybean food, vaccines, dental mercury amalgam and black preacher etc it's crazy man very crazy the world we live in
DL face when Vlad said gay cartoons 😂😂😂
Reverse Psychology 101: First Create a Religion. Then claim that the Religion comes from certain books (Bible). Then hire many who hate and despise the books (Bible) & Yah to proclaim a ton of lies about the books and many customs. \nAnd people who dont read, will hate the persons (Yahweh & Yisrael) in the book, the book itself (Bible) and the religions they think come from the books (bible)\n\nYea, yall fell for the okie doke. 99.999% of people who hate Yah/Bible dont hate it because of what they read, but they hate it from he say/she say of religions and religious people, and the things religious people do.
I don't believe in God. I think religion is used for mind control. I'm not knocking anybody for believing, as long as you practice what you preach. If not, keep it movin'
Gays flock to the church because they feel safe because they know the church HAS to accept everyone.  It's their safe place.
ATL niggas be like it's only gay if you suck dick and you like
im just here to see what the DoDo chasers are going to say !
forgiving? \nRuthless. \nWhy does every black person think slavery was like all the slave movies? \nDo people know what a drama is . If slave movies showed the vast reality of it you would be bored off your ass. Plantations were often to mostly remote , rural and life was tedious and mundane. Africans Americans know nothing about the actual brutality of slavery . The real brutality was over in Africa where Muslims (whether black , Arab or Amizigh) castrated slaves. Why does everything that rape was so common and prevelant. That's just an assumption from watching slave dramas. \nWhy do American blax show almost no interest in learning about the real past? Because deep down they don't want to know their real involvement.
Black gay men go to church because that's what black women do.  They take their cues from black female behavior.  They mimic them completely.  Church attendance in the black community is cultural and traditional.  It's not about God or being a good Christian.  It's about following that cultural imperative, because your mama and grandma forced you to go and they called out Jesus name in vain all the time.  The black church is a cesspool of sin.  There is no God there.
There's plenty of evidence: go to evidenceunseen.com and actually investigate and read a book vlad.  You can tell your not studied our country is becoming post modern not atheist anymore.  If you are an atheist you have no objective standard of morality, you have no objective purpose, there is no point of even living if there is nothing after this because you can't take it with you.  You have the burden of proof.
I don't Agree with this Fool at all but He's Dead On...Churches be Gay asf 💯😂
Please...don't....mention Jesus's name....you're an athiest right? And dont mock Christianity...as for what I said about you choking or gasping for air....believe me...you would no longer be an atheist...NOW....dont bother responding moron.
This Russian bitch stop dropping parts and just drop entire video
So a suicide bomber is spiritually fine? A pedophilic priest is spiritually fine? Black people spend $14 mil a week at church, but hardly support each other or invest in our community infrastructure. That $14 mil would be a great start towards being financially fine as you put it. My comment came as harsh, but I truly don't care about or hate any religion, I just see it as a hindrance for progress and a waste of my time.
I'm bout to start going to church again, find me a black woman.
D.L. actually has a point, cause the black Church well not Church, but the crazy lunatics inside the Church hates LGBT ppl, but they're always the ones whose LGBT, but on the DL...what D.L. said about the Boosie thing is what I've been saying for the longest is that nothing can turn you gay or make you gay, cause you're gay if you find the same gender attractive, so how can seeing gay ppl on TV automatically make you attracted to the same gender? that means you already had thoughts like that, but scared to express it and also when you're uncomfortable with LGBT ppl then you turn to children trying to use that as bait and blame blame blame...on the restroom thing I just think that women whether cis or trans should be in the woman's restroom period, cause what if you put Jazz Jennings a 16 year old in the men's restroom? what about her safety? cause there's numbers of assaults done to trans women and not one evidence showing that trans women use the restroom for nefarious purpose, but ppl are uncomfortable, so they bait you talking about what about the children? well guess what dummies, a predator doesn't need a law to stop them from hurting kids you morons.
I'm tatted up, but his tattoos doesn't fit him
He dont have any eyebrows...dl need to do some research on cartoon tho i mean the gayest shit ever..
black people dont like gay people? ..fake news
Shout out to Eddie Long!
He sounds stupid as hell.  I see why I don't even entertain his shows.  Go do something with your life becasue your wisdom and been a comedian is not working for you.  How his men in the church are gay.  You may have 1 out of 100 but you saying it as if all men in church is gay.  My choir director is not gay.
Correction Mr Hughley. You need Jesus, Comic View. As a 'Joy' man, a homospiritual, gayness is a sexually oriented counterfeit of my spiritual relationship with an invisible man called Jesus. He makes my joy complete. Ever since I started listening to Jesus every other dude started looking like a ladyboy. You too, Jamar. Just ask Yeezus. My wife would prefer it if I slept in the bed with Jesus inside me. I don't expect anyone to understand what it is to be 'joy'. Joy rights have been replaced gay rights, the spiritual with sex. I'm staying in love with my man Jesus, Jamaicans know this is right. I'm just in love with the perfect man. It saves me watching anybody else, whooo! Joy pride...looks like a fool on a cross until you wake up into reality.
What is up with all those tattoos on his neck...SMH\nDude is over 50 with all that mess on him.
It's so many niggas on the down low in church
If u dont believe in God then Who created the earth ur standing on? Who created Adam and Eve? How would u know that a woman was made for a man? How would u know that homosexuality is wrong? Plz dont say science . Majority of these so called christians u see today are fake christians so people give up on faith becuz of how christianity is being portrayed. Anybody can go to church and claim they're a Christian, but are they truly living the Word of God? If I go to a church and all I see is homosexual ppl in the pulpit and the pastor isnt preaching the word of God or is teaching prosperity, i know thats wrong becuz thats NOT christianity. Im not gonna jst say well God isnt real and give up on my faith based off other peoples sinful acts. That should have nothing to do with ur walk with God. All u can do is pray for them.
I didn't know this brother was so deep
dl..if it's supposed to be a girl, but she's just a guy Cross dressing!? then he rapes your daughter? his point is correct. but that's not OUR, people against it, point..
I KNOW God exists. But that's not for me to prove. Either your spirit knows or you're just lost in the human experience. Such is life, literally. But if you fear going to hell that's not true belief anyway. May as well be athiest.
And DL just LOVES Church.

Psalm 14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good... The fool (one who is morally perverse, not mentally deficient) is described as to his belief (no God) and behavior (none... good). His is a practical rather than a theoretical atheism. vv.2-7. Psalm 10:4; Psalm 53:1; Genesis 6:11-13; Romans 3:10. Be Bless.
It was given to us by the white man to keep us down! They hid the truth and our history from us please READ and RESEARCH
Boozie saying their trying to make ppl gay but he said when he was locked up he seen 2 niqqers fucking each other... So I guess black dudes don't need no help?!
He said it doesn't make sense lol
I like D.L., but I think there is something to what Boosie said.  I've seen things and been a victim of things that give me an understanding of how people can try to intrude on the most personal and basic attributes of human existence.  And the big orgs that he's talking about are made up of people.  As a writer, I often write about character's private lives and a few of those characters in every would I have created have been homosexual.  I'm not trying to change the sexuality of others, I'm just creating worlds that look like the world I've experienced.  But others aren't like me.  If they can use storytelling power to rule over others, they will.
I used to believe in God.. until my grandmother, a woman who has served the Lord for the majority of her life, spent most of her time serving the church, has always paid her ties....ends up with Alzheimer dementia...God is allowing her to lose her mind, despite her faithfulness. My family seems to believe that she can just speak the disease away by quoting scriptures, esp my aunt who is in denial... and it really enrages me. IDK what to believe... im leaning/moving more towards Deism to be honest.\n\nMy aunt is in denial, willfully ignorant about my grandmother's condition... and as a result, she is doing things that she is not supposed to do when dealing with an elderly person that has this condition, she doesn't understand that my grandmothers mind rubberbands and that the disease causes habits that are innate ... so it is pointless to attempt to constantly correct or remind my grandmother.. I got so angry at her a couple weeks ago about a situation between both of them that  i wanted to lay hands on her.... but that would be unacceptable.
Never mistake the Christian church for being connected with the bible,its not!!!\nThey hold the bible in their hand but blaspeme and don't follow it or teach it at all!!!!
2:00-06 he just said the shit Vlad
I believe in the higher power but not da bullshit
Also I said to my friend the other day it's really no longer a man's world it's a women and children's World hence there's more gays in the world which I have no problem with it but it's true there's more homosexuals in the world today than there ever has been a lot of people like to blame it on the men not being in the home but again these men are being raised mostly by women
DL looks like a state trooper with that hat on
Majority of these churches are full of undercover devils. Those preachers will preach the word but will do the exact opposite. The ones preaching sanctimoniously be the ones with the most dirt like that dude on the Spike Lee movie Red Hook Summer.
What is the deal with the black community always finding this shit to discuss? Somebody always being suspect or looking a certain way, its not gonna matter whos gay or straight, its not gonna stop nobody's money flow or how this economy is ran, why is this the only community that has such a stigma with this? Ya'll don't like talking about it then turn around and bash your very own brothers and sisters of color that are. This is why blacks will never be able to come together as one
D.L is not lying about that.  All jokes aside 💯💯💯💯
Vlad : Kaityln Jenner was ESPN's woman of the year!\nDL : Yeah & she wasn't a woman for a month!
Bra DL old ass TATTED THE FUCK UP THO !!! I nigga got mo hits then lil wayne
The Truth will either set you free or scare the shit out you God is a women not the one n that fake as Bible with fake ass jesus
TOXIC COMMENT SECTION BELOW: GRAB SOME POCORN AND SOME ORANGE MILK SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE SHOW!
A  black man on his knees in a church with a white jesus image in his mind you got to be GAY. Along with that type of posture and that image NO way you can be a positive image other young black men absolutely 👎 NO way.
That have to conflict your mind a lot on top of all the other issues that they face
Man, i LOVE this hat DL. Very stylish sir. Man, it's banging!!!!!!!
You wanna solve the bathroom issue....write dick on one door and vagina on the other...boom
This guy acts woke but he really isnt. He is also indoctrinated by white society. IMO.
The last minute of the video, he's right. Like no you want people to know. That example goes along with so many other things
That forgiveness trait comes from slavery!
Y'all wannabe atheist nigga goofy 😆😆
Dislike squadddd all day culture vulture
Vlad don't know SHIT
society...meaning white people.
Black atheist here! ✋🏿
https://youtu.be/VA5xiaR971I
greatttttttttttt question VLAD..
This guy is weird looking now lol
Now He Tripping
Eddie Long?
Homos flock to church
*Church is THE gayest place on earth.  I feel sorry for the gays @times.  Imagine me attending a KKKlan rally/backwoods meeting only to hear they don't like my kind for hours on end?  This is how gay folk look in church when Rev. Do-Wrong speaks of them going to hell on a bobsled for being gay.  Then he signals the gay choir director to cue the music.* sad.
Boosie said evil coming at the kids with gay agenda through cartoons D L refutes it and then turns around to strengthen it with his bathroom logic saying they're trying to push something on us we don't agree with by unnecessarily bringing it up, whether cartoons parades bathroom disputes or coming out the closest it's to desensitize and normalize abnormalities
Davey & Goliath was a Lutheran show. Shame on you D.L.
DL so you just gonna let a atheist shame your people bcz they practice the virtue of forgiveness . Shame on you DL for not knowing the value of human value of true love . Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness it’s a gift that brings abundance of great energy . It takes a real man / Women to forgive . Let’s not forget that .
No forgiveness this side... i give as good as i get
I don't believe that the they if they exist would be putting the gay agenda forth for monetary gains I think they would be putting the gay agenda forth to try and control the population.
No shit! A Jew obsessed with black culture is essentially an atheist... I've never seen one of those before
What's up with dude vlad a black people. He need to talk to some real niggas
Just read Deuteronomy 28 the whole chapter an Deuteronomy 7, an Psalms 83. It will tell you who the true hebrew an jews are. An why black people go through so much
African spirituality is full of forgiving people also before, and after Christian influence.
In slavery the church was the only place you could come together and have some relief , it was like the only social gathering available almost like a concert  , you was not allowed in night clubs , theatres and etc. Thats why it became a big deal with the culture .
The black church is definitely beyond suspect of gay shit
We should not be so forgiving
Atheism >>>>>
Forgive lol why?
Goe is Real ! Just because you don't see his presence that's what Faith is about... This life is a Test
WE ARE THE REAL JEWS THE ISREALITES
Vladimir Putin SHUT THE FUCK UP FUCK UP... ps MR HUGHLY SHUT THE FUCK UP.. AFTER U TELL A LIL TRUTH......\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStupid mf
Been A Black Athiest since Birth!'
Play Christensen regularly he's our next great center back.
Batshuayi is brilliant but Morata is better, well done Chelsea for beating Atletico Madrid in their new stadium it was magic so very happy 😊
If Batshuayi worked on his movement, he could compete with Morata as his finishing is just as good. Morata's movement is on another level though.
Every week I watch these videos William is always doing skills, does he even concentrate on actual football
Willian should definitely start his YouTube channel side by side similar to F2 Freestylers...
Play Musonda more
Victor Moses can speak
David Luiz 😂😂 0:11
COME ON CHELSEA 🔵💙
Well done boys! Lets beat city 💪💪
Play musonda ..it will be fun seeing delph chase him for 10 or so mins
Willian should practise passing and not those stupid skills
Please play Kenedy and musonda more
Willian should be behind Musonda in the squad has any one noticed Willian gives the ball up after Chelsea push forward all time with him in attack he passes or shows of to much and looses possession no disrespect his a great player but we’ve got better and his wasting to many chances in such critical games
Aguero got in a car accident
Michy is still young n has plenty of room to improve his football at chelsea fc. He will soon become a star at the club.
People bashing on Willian are total idiots. They guy is amazing and he can practice the skills if he wants.. Yes, sometimes he does silly things. Don't attack him. Every player does mistakes.
Chelsea❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chelsea squad 11 12 =< Chelsea squad now\n\nAre they gonna win ucl
*MORATA >>>>>>>>>>> Aguero*
Willian should create a YouTube Football Freestyle Channel because that's all he's about these days & leave football for men, smh
today tactically technically Conte he got it wrong
Michy doesn't know how to play with his strengths. Otherwise he would have been a good player. Atm he is just average.
We deserved more goals but well played chelsea. Our dominance in the game was crazy.\n#ktbffh\n#coyb
Yo moses's english is on point didnt expect tht
Let's pick up where we left off boys!
Who's ready to for FIFA 18 today and Wreck teams with Chelsea FC!?
Show more of hazard in training
only 2 days preparation for the city game is a joke!!! but i believe in the boys to get the win. #COYB💙💙
Does anyone know what sneakers Morata is wearing? The white ones? Looks like Addidas
4:17\nwhy two pairs for the match? does he change them at half-time?
Mitchy is too fat! Get some fat loss diet & exercise!
This channel needs more content same thing every week\n We need more in depth look. Also longer footage
Cahill well played on Wednesday. You deserve more credit sometimes
Some of ya'll so disrespectful, Willian has carried the team by himself so many times when they other players are under performing. The most consistent player in our shirt for the pass 5years. #FakeFans 😡
The Wanda Metropolitano is no joke, that is one fresh, footballing arena!
Bats has to rethink his bags lol
Been noticing Batshuayi wearing old F50 boots why is that ?
how you doing Chelsea fans
Все равно Батшуаи деревянный!!!))))
Come on boys, same ting as last years let’s sweep City under the rug.
Willian works very hard
lovely
Batshuayi = training legend
Boys lets focus city game
Williann ...... 🙄🙄🙄
Chelsea 💙💙
Esse David Luiz 😂😂😂
CHEELLLSSEEEAAAAAA
Batschuayi on wednesday night made me happy for the first time in UEFA champions league since 2012
Morata or lukaku?
IF YOU SUPORT CHELSEA COMMENT UNDER THIS CHELSEA ARE THE BEST
Michy on fire🔥
Breaking News Aguero got in a car accident and is out for two months. He won't be playing against Chelsea. 😫😫😫😭😭😭
Sou brasileiro, mais amo o Chelsea desde pequeno.\nVamos, vamos Chelsea  blue
I love the fact they are training at the stadium. Very shrewd move by Conte. All teams should be doing this to make their home stadium a fortress.
willian should improve in playing always concentrates on dribbling
Morata, Pedro and Alonso are besties
Goodbye zuma
HAZARD <> MORATA <> MUSONDA
I really like that this video wasn't just about buying loads of new stuff 🙌
I love red, so that is a trend I am looking forward to. And I like the print you showed, will need to check out some thrift shops.
Inasmuch as I love this style of video, I'll always have a soft spot for your old LookBook style videos shot in your house. I still go back to those when I'm in a style rut!
I like these kinds of videos. If you like this you should also check out KarenBritChick. She does these kinds of fashion style videos all the time.
I’ve been following you for so many years and it’s amazing to see how much you’ve grown 💖💖 love you sam
Aaaah love the colder seasons fashion so much! Great video Sammi :))
I always like your videos even though I can't wear anything you style because I live on an island. 😭
I loved this video so much Sammi! it was so nice to hear you suggest that you could get a prince of wales check blazer from a charity shop and that you can pair items we already have for the oversize jumper over skirt trend! ☺️💕 I know it's common sense that you don't need to buy new stuff all the time to be on trend, but it's always nice to have sustainable shopping suggested from a blogger! all the outfits were lovely as always xx
For the instagram: I like a mix of both. Everything doesn't have to be perfect
Hey not one to comment but I love the mirror pics and selfies, I think your casual but chic posts set you apart from all the overly polished content online, plus those type of posts make it a bit easier for me to imagine how I could actually wear such looks in day to day to life. Just love seeing the looks you put together really, so keep doing what you're doing and whatever you enjoy the most ❤️❤️
I love your fashion videos!!
Love this video! More please! ♡
Also, just watching old vids and realized how much I miss the kaleidoscope intro!
I love the mirror selfies!
I love your fashion videos! they're always super helpful!
I remember watching you when you wore your Docs and chunky shoes. Bring em back! =) Love watching your videos as alway, Sam. You brighten my day.
This earrings suits you soo much Sam! I 'm waiting for some ootd videos! xx
I prefer mirror pictures because they are more accessible and I feel like I could relate to that style of picture more.
Sammi I love your style! You're so good at putting outfits together that flow really well!
Right before you said it I was thinking those trousers would look good with a red jumper 😂  I've also seen a lot of extremely pointy boots out and about but they look kind of clown-ish to me 🤷‍♀️
I love how down to earth you are! Professional pics are neat, but mirror pics are definitely more relatable and are still great!
Definetly the mirror selfies, they just have this effortless and casual feel to them. Whereas the more professional shots are a little more clean cut. \nDoes that make sense? Lmao. \nBoth are stunning though!
You should release a red jumper with Novem & Knight!!!!
Girl first of all this was amazing, you are amazing! I love your videos to the moon and back, truly! And to answer your question I actually like the mirror pics more than the professional shots (although those are marvelous too) as I feel like they're a bit more charming and relatable. So much love to you and your lovely family! xxx
ive been a subscriber since ur doc martens days omg!! time flies!!!!
You look so stunning in this video!
I just want to go out buy so much more clothes than what I was already thinking about! Love this video!
What i love about your fashion videos is that it inspires me to be braver with my own personal style. Now i'll actually take the plunge and wear something i like even if it's a bit out there and it's a great feeeling  xx
Love love love your fashion videos ! And i dont mind both for your outfit photos. Love checking out your instagram stories about your outfit and Indie as well ❤️
I really like your hairstyle like that ☺️
Loved all the pieces but the sequins blazer was my favorite😍
I've just seen that Zara has a quilted scarf. That might be a way to get the puffy bomber look without being overwhelming. #teampetite
I've just bought an oversized grey/brown check blazer and i love it but have no idea how to style it! any suggestions?
I like this kinda neutral sage green or slate blue color on stove pipe dress slacks. The pants are kinda high waisted with deeper pockets and are worn with a rugged boot. I kinda like the professional Instagram photos.
I love your style, you are and have been for years an inspiration to me <3\nI prefer more laid back insta pictures! They are so much more authentic :)
where is that lovely red floral tea dress from ? x
WHAT LIPSTICK IS THAT?! You're always, always, always SO gorgeous
Love videos like this!
I think Polka Dots are also a thing this season !!! I see them every where & instead of red , maroon jumpers is a huge trend !!! Goes go well with the checkers x planning to do something like this on my blog soon !
I think a variety is good, but I prefer selfie, mirror pictures. It's nice to see more selfies and mirror pictures just to remember that you are just a normal person like your followers. A lot of fashion YouTubers are leaning more towards the professional side of things and sometimes it's nice to be able to relate to you on some level, if that makes sense!
This is awesome video. Great creation\nif you want to like this just come to My channel and subscribe my channel.\nhttps://youtu.be/fz9cEb_6fl4\nCreate a good comment and like my video\nhttps://youtu.be/qk-ekQuK2Gk
The check print is called Glen plaid (which is short for Glen Urquhart plaid) or Glenurquhart check
I love these videos Sammi!! And I love how excited you are, it makes me so excited to shop too - you're so bad for my bank balance! xx
I like seeing both for sure but more mirror pics!
I like both! Sometimes I like to see something really pro and full of effort, but sometimes it's nice to just see a regular person taking a regular photo in front of a mirror! (Possibly stuck all the crap things in the room to where you can't see in the pic.)\nLove you!!
The red jumper and skirts with oversized sweaters are my favourites! 😍 Love it. \nAnd I'm loving your lipstick, your hair and your shirt in this video. 😍😍 You always look so good! \nLoved the video 💕
The kitten heel... it's a no from me 🙈
Loving these videos on upcoming trends and how to incorporate them!
Love love loved this! I feel so inspired now thank you! x
This is your best makeup look! 💄
love the format of you vids sami
This filming background is SO nice 😍
Sammi you'll love this site for all these trends! https://imaginebykim.nl/collections/newin
You're makeup looks amazing in this video! That lip is everything!
No disrespect but other than the 40s blue and the red autumnal boots most of the other pieces reminds me of the story ‘the emperors new clothes’, kinda.
I would LOVE to have this grey jumper!!! I even wanted it last year.. but shipping to germany and from pounds to euro is just toooo expensive for just one jumper.. I wait till payday or you post a coupon code :D:D
very good video! so put together and insipring! thank You! so professional, Sammy!
hi where is your gold lamp from?! :)
Love this! I'm pregnant with twins and seriously don't know how I'm going to find anything in trend for my growing body, knowing colours and patterns will really help! Also I love your selfie posts 📸 xx
I like a combination of professional photos and selfies! They both show something different :)
Im not into any of those trends. Except red bc it's my favourite colour. But i dont get the trend of the biiiig jackets/coats and wide shoulders. And shiny clothing ugh \nTbh i personally think it's not important to follow trends. It's better to build a solid wardrobe and then maybe buy a few pieces here and there and personalise everything
Try reserved for a red jumper! They have the nicest roll neck xxxx
Are those bomber jackets? Most of the pictures you showed are puffa jackets
Where is that red flower dress from @ 8:27?  I can't find it in the discription box :(
👍🇺🇸🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧💞💕💞💕💞💕💞💤💤💤💤💤💤🌐 you have beautiful hand Sammy I got interrupted the first time I washed your blog great blog as usual Kansas City Missouri
I love the look of your N&K jumper but it doesn’t say what it’s made of......could you let me know? X
Love that red is in! This was a really helpful run down, loved it 💗🍂
Hey Samantha, if you're worried about the oversized bomber trend not suiting your short frame (same tbh) Ariana Grande has been known to wear them from time to time and she is next level tiny! You may have already seen it since it's a little old now but check out her music video for Everyday for some inspo. Not a plug but shorties like us can definitely pull off all the trends too!
always enjoy your fashion videos :) I like both types of instagram pics - I think it's good to have some of both as it keeps it looking sophisticated but real
Hi Sam, personally I like a mix of professional shots and mirror pics, but I also like whatever gets us more outfit pictures!
I bought a bright red scarf yesterday and I am in love! Such a good way to get a bit of colour for someone who's scared of deviating from monochrome!
As for Instagram I really like a good mix of both !!
the puffy bomber is one of my favourite wardrobe pieces cause it instantly makes your outfit trendy
Loving statement earrings on you! You look great in this video.
You look gorgeous!! Where is your necklace from?
Hi Sammy! You're looking gorgeous! I loved the video but I think you shoud have mentioned the vinyl trend and showned your H&M skirt, I have one too and I'm in love with it :D!! Love from Portugal XXx
Hey Sam, sorry just seen Jason uploaded a podcasts with you.. I'll be back ☝️😊
The curly hair suits you so well! I love it
Amazing Samantha! For advice on relationship, friendships and more - check us out! :)
Loooooove the earrings Sammi!
Reds & sequins not for me👎
I love you!
Does anyone really just wear what's in 'fashion'? Personally i don't care if something is or trend or not. I wear what i like and feel comfy in. Docs literally never go out of style. I had my first pair aged 8 and am now 34. I have 3 pairs and they're practically all I wear. Screw fashion. Wear whatever you want.
Mirror pics!! <3
Selfie pics for sure 😊
Your just delightful to watch ❤
LOVEEEEE THESEEEE VIDEOSSSSSS

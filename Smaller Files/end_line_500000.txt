Who do you think did better?!
This is so hilarious !! and wow amazing what the right lip color could do to a look
At least they are both equally annoying so no one can make a video JACLYN HILL ANNOYING NIKKIE TUTORIALS FOR 5 MINUTES STRAIGHT.     I mean this with love and I love both of them and their channels ❤❤❤
No hate for these twooo. They jammed so good 😍
This is actually such a funny video I can't stop laughing nikkie and jaclyn are such a perfect combination for collabs
Stressed out Jaclyn looking for the bronzer is me 90% of the time 😂
I love this so much😂😂
Lol you guys should’ve just put a countdown timer for six minutes instead of waiting for four minutes to pass by. Lmao 😂 \n\nLove ya still! ❤️
hey could you do a bomb ass halloween makeup tutorial. maybe a sexy one inspired by pennywise from IT.
I love how they sat and waited for the timer to hit 4 minutes rather than restarting timer and it running to 6 minutes to equal 10  minutes haha. Love them
I usually don’t like Joslyn Hill’s videos but this was really enjoyable lol
Literally the best video I've watched in months ♡
This was SUPER CUTE!!!!!! I LOVE IT!
I've dreamed for this moment to happen and finally it did. My two most favorite make-up guru in one video.
For 10 minutes they look beautiful
Why didn't they just continue on for 6 more minutes, instead of waiting for it to go to four minutes again?😂😂
where can I find a cross necklace like her??
I love both  looks...love you guys❤💋❤💖💋💋💋
Anyone know what brand is Jaclyn's lip color from? It's the perfect red 😍
Jaclyn you are not funny your make up looks so so freaking good compared to my 3 hr makeup!!!!! How can that be!! 😥💔
love this!! i would die if you did the sweet peaches matte pallete by too faced!! i have it and find myself doing the same look every day and don't know how to branch out!
I love this video 😍
Nikkie tryied hard... but jaclyn works better under pression so points for jaclyn and she was right, the red lipstick was GLAM!!! #dermacolissofuckinggood
I'm happy to see that you are uploading content more frequently <3 That red looks great on you, btw!
Does anyone know what lipstick Jaclyn is wearing in this video? TIA
They do their makeup better in 10 minutes than I do in an hour.
some ninja shit I'm in tears
You girls are so cute
I love you both! So funny!
I just can't believe that Nikkie skipped lashes.
Hahahahahahahaha still laughing my ass off.. this is the best
I feel bad about the n word thing u we're both wrong in my mind u guys r not perfect people and other people have to understand that
Hilarious 😂❤️
What Lashes Are Those ?
What color lip is Jaclyn wearing???
I'm crying laughing rn
YOU LOOK LIKE FUCKING SQUIDWARD 😂
Omg! I love it 💖🤣😗😗
Wow not bad!
Ohhh, Nikkie, I’m so happy to see you in something again, but _whhyyyy_ Jaclyn??
😂😂😂😂😂 I can’t stop laughing
“I think I’m gonna go with a red lip to trick people into thinking I went really glam but I didn’t” THATS ME 💄💋🙆🏼🙆🏼
My favorite 2 makeup artists are finally collaborating together .. hilarious vid😂.. waiting for a get ready with us and a real makeup tutorial 😘
Hahahahahahahahahahaha The Pros can't do their makeup in 10 min.
nikkies eyebrows are jus the best lol xxx love you both xx
😂😂😂 i loved this video!!!
Omg Jaclyn I don't know what you're talking about, every step of your makeup looked flawless!
The foundation on the left is way to light in color and heavy on application.  She should never use that again.  It’s horrible.  The one on the right won this.
Why not just start the timer back at 6 minutes???
Why couldn't they just do 10-4 which equals 6 so they could of just started right away and just go to 6 mins
Haha omg y'all had me laughing the hole time I love it #ILY ❤️💜💛💚💙
nikkie, are you okay? hahahahhahahahahahhhahhhahahahha...
Hahaha... So hilarious you guys! 🤣😂\nGreetings! 😘😘✌🏼
This is the most hilarious makeup video I’ve seen in a while, I cried from laughing so hard 😂
JACLYN! WHAT LIP ARE YOU WEARING! IM DYING I NEED IT IN MY LIFE!
if the timer stopped at 4 minutes, couldn't she have just set the timer to 6 instead of waiting??? lmao
What was the point of filming so late?
Can you do a video with your full make up routine with your favorites ? And include all the products used...... detailed lol please!!!!
When u have  a bad day and this just makes you laugh  your  ass off  lol thank u ladies love the video
Please Subscribe to my channel!! Will subscribe back :-)
I'm laughing so hard and I think the race gave me anxiety😂
What are they doing is like when you woke up late and you have a toddler and a husband saying you only have 10 minutes because the bus or train is leaving soon. And I am in a hurry!!!
9:56 freaked me out! who is that?
Anyone else notice the random man at 9:58 😂 Otherwise, loved this video. Felt like it ended so quickly 😭😭
Thank you for this video. 10min glam💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 you guys are the most creative and outgoing. I adore your videos guys
both of you are cray and we love it and we want moreeeeeeee  hahaha btw, this gave me so much more anxiety haha
you girls are funny should do more together
This video legit had me cracking up the entire time 😂😍😍😩😩 I lovedddd it !!! Such a good idea !!! Do this with Manny next !! Loved this video
Please do a furnished house tour!!!!!
Scrolling through the comments & wondering why so many people feel the need to watch an entire video just to find something to talk shit about? I thought this video was hilariously cute & both of you look stunning! 💗
I’m being dead serious
can you pretty pleeeease do a tutorial with the 35R for beginners???
Use the bright colors in the palette
they waited for it to go to 4 minutes again instead of setting it for 6 minutes ... like wth?

A Monet, LOL I used to say that because of clueless,  then I took an art class and was like, oh.. lol
Stressed about how much dermacol Nikki squeezed out
I loved this!
Hi
Why not me lyrics\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z9d6gimjRn4
Eric God Church
AMEN 🙏🏻
Tosh.0?
It was an amazing performance, Thank you for sharing your soul with us Eric Church
God bless you all every one ☝️ I love going to church both really church and Eric church
Eric Church is the epitome of what a musician, a human being should be.  Heartfelt, he knows were he came from and respects it, and the fans who have found him.  Simply my favorite musician, and a human I strive to be.
I started listening to the Chief back during the Sinners like me Album, I kept trying to show him to everyone I could. The way he conveys his message is incredible and this song just shows it. I could have been there at that concert and am thankful I wasn't. He is truly the Chief! Eric Church is the real deal. He isn't like the other modern country artist, this man is real.
Excellent, beautiful, heart wrenching and pure art.
So now that every part of the American background has been affected can we talk about gun control? Insane how these guys have to sing about this...
4:12 tears started flowing. How can you not love this guy?
There is no better artist
You have a huge heart Eric.. God Bless you!!!
Heart of gold love his words in a song...he is truth and country music💕💕💕
Somerset Ky  shout out from the bluegrass..... we love you Eric  Church
Eric, I sense that you grasp the connection between all of us, so let me suggest this as the answer to your song.  Why not me?   I'd say, a part of you did die. As a part of all of us died.  We are truly all connected.
Brave performance and beautiful song. A fitting tribute.
Song I wrote for the tragedy that happened in Las Vegas. 🙏🏼https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1926598244024504&id=100000230425794
This is why Eric is my favorite and always will be. Thank you for sharing your heart Eric. Continued prayers to all affected. #churchchoir.  #prayers.
Thank you.  We needed to see this.  My cousin was there.  I'm sorry you had to go through what you did.  Glad you made it to the Opry that night.
I love this man!
Don't know about y'all but at 4:15 I broke down
He's amazing....if he read the bible hed know why the wicked pray on the good....God will put an end to it soon Death will be no more
I would like you all to thank X-President Obama & Hillary Clinton for all the Violence weve been going through after our election of President Trump. They will answer to their sins & crimes against our people eventually.
he's famous now... #illuminati
Why so many dislikes?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Awesome...God Bless..
God bless you.

I'm a huge country music fan! I've always loved Eric Church and love him even more after this! Made me cry....so heartwrenching! Beautiful song! My prayers and thoughts go out to Eric Church, all of the artists, fans, and their families that were affected by the Las Vegas tragedy!
No big deal here.
This is Eric Church.
Thank you Chief for helping us heal with your music.  You are incredible. From another one of your people & Church Choir member.
A new era is sure to come, it is definite and it is written.....And the kingdoms of this world, have become the kingdom of our Lord..
Eric Church you are a amazing man.  There is no artist like you.  You are a gifted man. Both artistically and personally.  Keep being you!!!
you are so amazing... I love you so much Eric. This broke my heart....
so sweet
Tell the loudmouth in the crowd to shut up. Annoying
Great song rip the Vegas victims

Nice Job Mr Church
I am so glad we have people like Eric.  He always says almost exactly what i'm feeling in times like these.  And he is so right. You can't kill music.  It's there and will survive as long as someone sings it.
I'm crying...thank you Eric for your heartfelt words and beautiful rendition...it helps in the healing... xx & prayers.
how could 2k ppl not love this man? I feel sorry for them, I truly do....
Such a beautiful, heartfelt performance and message ❤ I will forever be a fan of EC, he is a true artist who is truly in love with music. The best music in the world is the kind that speaks to your soul, brings tears to your eyes, and moves you deep inside ❤❤❤
What a beautiful tribute to those who lost their lives. As someone who was there, this is how we all feel!  Love you Eric!
3 women are still in critical conditions at the hospital. Krissy was shot by the liver and the lung and may not make it. My friend’s friend died and her husband is still here. They have funeral expenses. A sad song is not going to be enough to cover the funeral 😡
Very sad..\nYour a true hero\nLove your songs\nLots of respect..\nLove you
Such a awesome artist. I have always been a church fan. Will forever!!
I live in Vegas. God be with you.
Am I the only one who thinks this guy is a douchebag for capitalizing on people's emotions?

Eric, you are amazing and God Bless you for having the courage to get up on stage and pour your deepest, heartfelt feelings out.  So much admiration and respect for you <3
There's a reason why you were Sonny's guy! You are a class act Eric Church.
sonny melton was my best friends uncle and she just sent this video to me...
I went to Willie Nelson Sheryl Crow concert this summer & he played. I laughed at him & made fun of him (and his fans), he seemed phony & shallow. He is now a broken man. This is a beautiful song. Thanks for sharing💔
I know it's you Daniel tosh. Stop hiding behind them shades.

A bunch of heartless SOB's disliked this video and song.
New song for me
Thank you Eric for everything. My mom and my dad were both shot. My mom will be okay but my dad is in the ICU in rough shape. Anyways, I kept being told that my dad absolutely loved your performance. Thanks for that bit of joy ❤️
I don't know how anyone could hit the dislike button on this video. You should be ashamed of yourselves!
I believe something good will come out of this tragedy,
As a singer and music lover I must admit that I'm not the biggest country fan. I'm familiar with some, but not many of the artists- but my heart goes out to every spirit affected that day.\nChurch, I felt your compassion here..  You're the man.\nGod bless

Sick of all the negative news nowadays and want a good laugh? Here's a video of some lady who is terrified of opening a Pillsbury container: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tle5JZoPheM
What career?
OMG! This was just awesome to watch! 😍 😍 😍
Holy shit his Tom Hanks is perfect
the whole time I kept wondering “where’s my best friends wedding..it’s my favorite movie of hers, please don’t let them leave it out..” then the way they ended it was just perfect oml😭😭💞
I have seen or owned majority of Julia's movies. I absolutely freaking love her. She is definitely one of my favorite actresses. Favorite movie is My Best friends wedding!!!! 😍😍
absolutely brilliant
Love her!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
3:53 HELL YEAH!!!!!!! 💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
love love love!! < 3
hey graham norton r u jealous corden has julia roberts
OMG i love it,,and she's trying so hard not to laugh
This was absolutely fantastic!  Now I know I have seen all her movies, she has an amazing range, I love you Julia!
Steel magnolias makes me cry every single time
she is so pretty❤️❤️❤️
Julia Roberts is great. James Corden can fuck right off though!!!
Damn....she's still very stunningly beautiful!
She is ageless person . i love her so much 😊
Please do this with sandra bullock!
I loved the pretty women
do one with Meryl Streep PLEASE
Man this was awesome James!  🤣😂
Замечательная актриса. Обожаю ее) Правда, видела с ней всего несколько фильмов. Надо бы пересмотреть все)
That amount of pasta is how much I end up with when I try to cook pasta
What about the Mexican? Did they do that one?
Everyone is talking about which movie of hers is their favorite, but my favorite thing she was in was FRIENDS when she leaves Chandler in the restaurant bathroom in just her thong. 😂😂💙 Although Pretty Woman was a gem too. (;
I love both of u.. :)
I just came to the realisation of how many many movies julia has been in
0:48 where my directioners at ❤️❤️💕💕 Harry’s Carpool karaoke was THE B E S T
This is so cool!
Julia Roberts . I like when she get angry in the movies !!!
James' Tom Hanks impression isn't bad.
Tell me why James Corden looks like a fat andy dalton #beyourownlifecoach
Let’s face it... James Corden is not funny at all, he’s the worst TV host ever. We all watch his videos because of the celebrities but he is annoying as hell!
My favorite version of this bit!
That was so much fun!
I love this
Never knew you liked running !!
Almost new all of them! Julia is amazing 😁😄😀🙌
Oh my gosh! At school we are reading wonder I'm so glad she will be I  it we are gonna watch it when it comes oit
Here so they could do steel magnolias. That movie ripped my heart out
They didn’t do the Mexican I love that movie. This was pretty epic tho Julia is such an icon she should have more than one Oscar.
How about Meryl Streep’s film career
Omg thank you for making this 😍😍😍\nSo many memories \nI love you Julia 💛💛
What a marathon!  Amazing
Господи, как это не интересно!
just perfect
Corbin really nailed Tom Hanks.
That was epic!
Julianroberts is a legend ❤️❤️❤️
no Michael Collins
Do this with meryl streep
wow shes done so many movies
That was great!! Very creative! She is one of my favorite actresses. I was going to name my daughter Julia, but decided on a character she played instead.....Darby.
ive only seen like 3 out of all these movies
A definite walk down memory lane of my favourite movies - now time to watch them all again!  Such an infectious smile and presence in all that she does <3
Funny to see her trying not to laugh at the sight of him in that wig.
She's just the best. My most favorite actrees.
James Corden - I hope you see this....you are a fat..unfunny cunt! And I hope\nYou die soon
the only white woman that doesn't age
Sleeping With the Enemy????
This is pure gold!
THE BEST THING IVE WATCHED EVER!!! AMEN!!! JULIA, YOURE A GEM!
Adore her. There is noone like her :-)
Another great concept for the show.
What kind of evil dislikes this?
Wasn't Julia Roberts in avatar (with the blue tall people) or am I getting mixed up like Julian(uhh)? Haha
Love what they did. But covering everything as the description reads, isn't true. I can think of at least 4 movies that wasn't done that Roberts was in. Like the movies Dying Young, Duplicity, Money Monster and The Mexican, for instance.
Haven't seen most of those movies...
I balled my eyes out on that 'Stepmom' scene!
Watching this makes me wanma marathon her movies asap, she's amazing 😍
Pretty Woman and Eat Pray Love ❤❤💙💚💖💜💛
Love Julia Roberts fantastic personality good on you both
Julia Roberts has the most memorable movie lines, I love her since until now she's not aging she still looks good at her age. Runaway Bride, Notting Hill, My Best Friend's Wedding, Pretty Woman are my favorites film of her and I'm so excited for Wonder :-)
DO THIS WITH MERYL PLEASE
I wish they added her tv appearances my fave was friends where she got even with chandler 🤣❤️
I have exams coming up and I rrrreally want to binge watch her movies. Damn it.
And this is exactly funny how :? CBS pls bring Craigy Ferg back!!!
Julia is so talented and beautiful
this was so amazing!!
Love her!  Pretty woman will always be my fave!  Such a great movie.. she looks beautiful!
I don't think there's any one movie they reenacted that I don't like.  Most of her films are some of my favorites like Pretty Woman, Erin Brockovich, Notting Hill,  My Best Friend's Wedding, Flatliners, Steel Magnolias, The Pelican Brief, and Mystic Pizza.  They left out I Love Trouble, Something to Talk About, and Duplicity, but those are the few that people don't remember.
Julia is fantastic, as always. James is hillareous.
Awww. So sweet. Julia Roberts has the most famous smile in the world i think but she's as lovely even when she's trying to NOT smile and hold her chuckles in!!!! James Corden is a true fan...like one of us.. that's why his show his awesome.
Very cool.
Great. Sandra Bullock next please :)
epic!
August Osage County?
Johnny Depp please! :)
бабушка с нарощеными волосами
Sooooo jealous of James Corden right now
brilliant!
Best one pretty woman!
la amo!
No August: Osage County?!
FINALLY A WOMAN!!!!! There's also Michelle Pfieffer, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and obviously Meryl Streep.
Too bad that you've put the texting right over the tags of the movies. Would've been nice to know, when I don't recognize every single one movie....
a list actors don't usually like doing things like this. she's great.
I was so hoping for Julia to tell James to Eat the fish, bitch!
In Ocean's 11 & 12, James' George Clooney impression was on point 😂
holy cow, I didn't realize she was in so many movies!  the minute I though it was about done then there's another & another.... and it occurred to me...oh yeah I forgot about that one!
That man don't want full custody of that child he just wants to get at Keyshia to hurt her because he's hurt that she don't want his lying, cheating bum ass no more and she's over it. Keyshia not gone let him have full custody and take her child. That child is just $$$ signs to him. She's already being fair with him which some men don't even get, now he's being greedy. What a way to treat a woman after she let you live in her house when yo ass had nowhere to go and you cheated on her, but she still had heart enough to not want to see you on the street, and this how you repay her🤦🏾‍♀️. Karma is a bitch in the end.
Her hair is usually on point but THIS wig is a NOPE!
Her hair is killing me
Her hairstyle overshadowed her ☹️
That hair🤔😑
I love keyshia but this hair is not it. It looks dry and old
Get jhene aiko on th real!' Make her talk. Too!!
These wigs, that she only wears to the real is so bothersome, last time her wig was hideous
she has feelings for that man still.
Y'all are so beautiful and I look up to you and we share laughs
Love Keish She is about her child and he is #1 in her life.
I love Keyshia Cole but baby she needs a better hairdresser. 🙅
SORRY.... But gurlll tht WIG doesnt want to do her job on u gurll..
She need to throw that wig away looking like Frankie 😩
Keyshia Cole is a dime. But she's wearing a Darth Vader helmet hair hat!Her hair stylist should be tar'd and feathered!She looks like a 50's pornstar that sucks dicks on roller skates beside juke boxes.
Oh Keisha you are with Floyd...leave Booby alone
She reminds me of this gay chick who hit on me a few years ago, I regret not trying it, she was sexy
This conversation is stupid like why should she care this was really a waste of time next
Don't like her hair it looks too much.. wig
I don’t think she’s over Gibson 🤔
Keyshia is so bitter 😑
Damn keyshia hair ugly
If we only would have gotten 10% of this Keyshia on the show.....
I think Keyshia is bringing her own style...even if the wig is big, it wasn't ugly especially on Keyshia
She looks different these days skin color wise
Keisha’s hair...🤦🏾‍♀️
She is beautiful  but I need to see her face, she need a better stylist
For one, who the heck is Boobie? And two, why is his name Boobie? 😂 😂
All the wigs in the world and this is one we pick
So we gonna ignore the wig
He is a good daddy
So let me see she took care his ass wen he lost his nba job n cheated on her n still took care him while he was so called gettn his rapp career on .and he got nerve to fight her for custody .how he plan to take care of his child with no income...... Oh wait let me guess he  want that keshia money .lmao smh boy bye grow up get a job split custody of child n be on your way !!!!! She aint buggn u for nun be with who u wana be wit n just co parent rightfully  like half the world does .or should in that matter .lbvs
Brooke how can u be booby bff and u never had a relationship as an Aunty figure to his child? Very odd.
I have no respect for Brooke. She stay dealing with a married man!!
I love that she's coming out her shell more!
whats going on with the hair keyisha
That damn wig make her look like she just turned 70
wth is on her head?
she regret putting him on the show Keisha Cole you a strong women
It's funny Boobi and Brooke felt the need to get closer on Love and HipHop. Sooo there wasn't an incline of sexual feelings between them before and during k and B's marriage?\nHhhmmm..ok....\n..random
I clicked when I saw that wig! Damn that's horrible
That hair though.
Her bangs are too low; you can hardly see her eyes. How does that not annoy her?!?
Her hair 🤢
I luv u keyshia what's going on with the hair
Keyshia Cole is so real, she needs her own show again.
LooooooooooVvvvvvvvveeee Keisha💚💚💚💚💚
I love Keyshia but that hairstyle doesn't suit her well.
I didn't even recognize her
I like Keyshia, but someone needs their a** whooped for putting that Elvira wig on her head. Most of the season, she's been giving me Morticia Addams teas. Wtf?!
That wig...ohhh god. Let's try again.
Love me some Miss Cole  <3♡♡
Keyshia girl. Why is your bang so thick? The whole wig overall really. It's swallowing your whole face. Can't barely see your eyes.
That’s hair on Keisha 😮 um
I still laughing at Jeanies corny ass dancing when she comes out
I love keyshia but gurrrrl this wig😔😔😔 no ma'am
Short and to the point
Beautifully stated!!
Wtf is wrong wit Keysha hair
There's a person named boobie?!?! Omg 😂😂😂😭
they need to start posting full shows clips suck
Omg i so just thought this was k Mitchell smh
Who did her hair like that??
That wig or whatever on top of KCole Head looks crazy!
YOU ARE DEAD
Tf her wig doing??? 👀
ytf she up there lookin like Judy Jetson
Her wig tho lol
she said brooke valentime
“No” lol
Ikr keyisha u don't got one wit my child. So basically Brooke Whoooo #Ooooh lls
Keisha hair, ni hao kylan -ish
Keisha baby, who's your stylist?
I agree with Keyshia Cole 100%
Love lonis jet black hair 😍😋
Did Loni just say Brooke ValentiME? 😑
Keyshia, I love you. But you gotta fire your makeup artist and hair stylist. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Keyshia hair is cute 1:12 ❤️ hair behind her ears 😍😍
Those bangs ugh\nI cant see Keyshia's pretty face
Valentime Loni, Really?  I'll bet you celebrate Valentimes day also.
Boobie doesn't want full custody, he just wants that spousal support and if he gets custody it'll be ammunition. Smh, SAD.
nah I can't..you seriously have to know who you're having a child with.
That Wendy Williams wig is a no Keyshia...😐😒
She looks so much like K Michelle here
Keisha kole is really not as intelligently sophisticated in her communication as i thought. She sound like shes slow asf w a hidden clingy demeanor. # unmasked
+The Real Daytime come on now I don't even cable right now I have basic channels so I won't be able to watch the show on VH1 or in the daytime because I'm in school... and I was really looking forward to Girl Chat atleast... and this week we've only been getting one girl chat a day I atleast wanted two ?
That hair looks like it’s overwhelming her head but I agree with her on the custody thing. I’m shocked she’s being so damn mature about it, if only all parents were that way
Her skin becomes so white 😐😐
So we not talking bout her hair !  Im getting distracted by it
Ewww  I can't stand this talentless bitch!
How y'all manage to butcher her name when it's literally right in y'all face?  🤔
I have a sister that looks like Keyshia!!
Call me a heater but Keisha Cole's jet black hair is what made me not watch this video
Did she get veneers ?
LOOKS SOOOOOOMUCH LIKE K. MICHELLE
Stupid wig!
Grown Woman response
anyone who watches LHH is ratchet lol
You guys need to bring relevant guests to the show
Why she so pale?
The pianist's song choices are so delightful! I heard Abba, The Beach Boys and a swath of musicals in there, and I'm sure there were more. What a treat. 💛
Oh, and Fumi Kaneko looks stunning and incredibly elegant as always. I'm so glad she recovered from her injury!
Can we take a minute and appreciate the pianist?? What an amazing job :) :)
thank you Lord for this treasure of pure #JOY
I just adore Alexander Campbell!  He is both a magnificent dancer but also seems like a gentleman!
I squealed when Alexander Campbell appeared.
oh my god, mamma mia into rhapsody in blue. so perfect!
Vadim😍. So, so elegant, even in class.
That girl at 57:55 who just skips off like NOPE, I don't know what's going on at all! is literally ME every single time we get to petit allegro in class. I love her reaction though.
Seeing Sarah lamb and Fumi great ballet dancers
Thank you ROH so much for giving us this wonderful treat every year! It's so special.
Every year there's someone pregnant hahaha!
Thank you for this video!!♡
Simplesmente maravilhoso !  Excelentes bailarinos e belíssimos coreógrafos.
A bit disappointed that we didn't get to watch Alex in class! I always love seeing him. But between Steven, Lau, and Ryo I was already torn for who to look at, so I suppose it was for the best, lol. I always find myself drawn to Steven in the end though, he really is incredible...
Does anyone recognize the tune at 53:48?
1:30 into the tape is a fantastic ballet
Why wasn’t Yasmine Naghdi in class? I was really looking forward to her in class this year, she’s so lovely! So happy she was promoted to Principal this year!!
Olga makes all this up? Someone let her choreograph her own ballet please👍👏👏😂
I love all the different styles of their clothes :D
Sae Maeda already stands out and she’s one of the newest. I knew she was going to be something when I saw her perform at Prix de Lausanne. Cannot wait to see her perform principal roles someday!
What’s the song at 01:30:00?
Thank you SO MUCH for the videos! Couldn't watch it live but I've now watched this afterwards 2 times already!
What's the song at 37:40??
Steven McRae's chaines at 44:18 holy crap!
I love watching Olga teaching. She's so nice and vibrant. She pays so much attention to the details and to each and every dancer. The dancers seem to  like her very much, too!
You know I noticed that the Royal dancers were all very honest with their turn out. I recall watching some Russian ballet company classes last year the dancers all had their feet 180 flat in first position and one dude even had his toes pointing backwards in second position - a bit freaky to be honest. There are many things I adore the Royal Ballet for and now I discovered one more. It is my favourite ballet company of all : )
My favorite time of year, I just love watching World ballet day with the royal ballet every year
look at the men in the Royal Ballet their feet their bodies their technique their turns Etc and look at the men in San Francisco Ballet and it is so embarrassing for sfb these days
(if only the commentators would stop talking...)
Whoops! I spelled her name wrong. I meant to write Yuhui Choe.  Is she still with the company?
I Love😍 World Ballet Day!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
God, my calves are killing me just watching those 16 rises  😭 😭  Relevés and frappés were my most dreaded exercises in ballet lmao
I always love Royal Ballet's class in World Ballet Day :)
The pianist likes his musicals!
what a wonderful teacher, i also love her barre combinations!
My eyes always go straight to Sarah Lamb whenever she's on screen. Olga is also such a great teacher, I'd love to have a teacher as sweet and straight to the point as her.
At 1:09:45 the music is I could have danced all night from My Fair Lady. And at 1:10:55 My favourite things from The Sound of Music.
ROH channel, thank you for uploading the whole thing! I never get to watch it live. This is my favorite stream from the World Ballet Day!
Does anybody else just LIVE for videos like this, because they can't take ballet themselves?
I am an aspiring ballet dancer and watching this really inspires me.I hope I can be there with you one day.Every year is better than before.Congratulations!
As good as calf rises are they should be doing it turned out , so they don't bulk up muscles that aren't needed when the legs are turned out.
Can we talk about Steven McRae at 44:15?
I love this company and Olga's classes so much ❤
I so appreciate the pianist's inclusion of Monty Python's Lumberjack Song
Who's the guy in the black tights and white tank top that looks like it has bananas on it?? I'm really enjoying his dancing.
I always love the live stream on world ballet day! ❤️
What’s the music for the dreamers ever leave you ??
Could I get any information about musics in this video?
I find ballet dancers fascinating because of their commitment to hard physical work coupled with their artistry.  I admire each dancer's accomplishment to get to this level.
The class of Olga Evreinoff is very fun. But I am waiting for Brian Maloney's class. Can I see his class again? Is Brian a class teacher in World Ballet Day 2018?
I loved what O'Hare said - we can do more together to bring awareness to ballet as a vital art form than we can each standing alone. Collaboration among art companies in the US has always seemed too politicized to work, as each is trying to beat out each other for limited funding, etc. Everyone seems out for themselves a bit. Worldwide there seems to be a lot more opportunity to come together and be a stronger louder voice that's needed to keep critical arts like ballet alive and thriving as we are stronger together than apart. This is such a lovely experience every year, thanks to ROH and all the companies that share intimate coverage of their beautiful creations, dancers, and processes.
squealed when i saw vadim - love that guy!
There's something hypnotic about watching class.  Fumi looking drop dead gorgeous here.
I love how this year they keep the camera on the dancers so you can still follow along while they're commentating instead of going to the commentators and missing part of the warm up class.
Absolutely wonderful! Every year is better! Crazy music, fantastic: classic, jaz, pop (Abba's Mamma mia!). Love
I just missed Natalia Osipova in class :(
Love the sound of music in there
1:02:22 is so me when i screw up and 1:02:50 is me when i think i'm at the club when i'm in class
Oh! I was so glad to see Nadia in the first class! If she is into her apprenticeship then I wish her the best of luck for a contract!
I love how the pianist went from Là ci darem la mano (Mozart's Don Giovanni) to Wagner's Treulich geführt (Wedding march) What an irony.
They guy at 1:02:23 is literally me everyday 😂
Love to see all the dancers.  They work so hard and create such beautiful art.  Grateful for their dedication.
What's the song at 1:30:00 ?
Olga's class! Love it!
The talent of the young dancers from the Royal Ballet School is amazing.
Love Vadim!
I love Olga!
Where is Yuhui Choe pls?
Steven McRaes but😍😍
What is the music of 'rond de jambe a terre'?
Leticia Stock, so beautiful!
Marianelaaaaa!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
AWESOME!  I ADORE BALLET.
frankie's legssss
Does osipova appear somewhere?
my legs hurt watching them lol
Olga -amazing teacher
Annoyed that I didn't get any notices that this was only on Facebook and not streamed on Youtube too. Not everybody likes fb or wants an fb.
Love this ! Delicious !
Tchaikovsky pdd😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 amazing
J'aime !
Muntigirov! Love him
Ahhh <3 <3 <3. The pregnant ballerina is definitely goals!!! :D xxxx
1:16:15 'cause its just not World Ballet Day without Nela :)
After the last year's disastrous presentation by Darcy, the World Ballet Day has become immensely enjoyable again. I love Kirsty and Alexander's supportive attitude towards their great colleagues.
Horrible! Royal Ballet is a piece of shit
during class, does anyone know who the girl right in front of the middle is? the one with the oversized white longsleeve and the black knitted legwarmers with white stripes?? she's incredibly good!!
Talking about the rehearsal of the Caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland, the guy in purple (Fernando?) is definitely not as good as Eric Underwood in this role back in the original production. Maybe he's still young and has to learn but Eric's Caterpillar was just so much more sexy and fascinating and his movements much softer, bigger and more elegant and worm-like.
talk the talk .... you'd think they'd sort the picture quality oot        , shabby cunts         . love the dancers tho
Can anybody tell me what the song at 30:20 is?
Sadly no Natalia Osipova, she's been with TRB since 2013 - never seen her dance live or in the cinema, boo hoo :-(
do they dance at their own time..
when will this be deleted??
38:30 men's butt in tights...
EEEEEK!!!! Alexander has a hairy chest AND a nice ass!!! (jumping and screaming like a fangirl with panties falling on the floor).
Steven Mccrae😍 hope i spelled that right
Who is the Asian male dancer in the black socks and green tights?!
Только не прыгай, Вадик! XD  36:48
Thanks a lot for sharing, FTM full support

This is kinda weak for TY$ hopefully when the album's here is gonna have some fire shit
Yuen in a virus movie.  Awesome.  I have never seen him in anything like that.  Bold career choice, Steven...
This is like a retarded version of Fight Club.
chill out we do this everyday in our office killing each other fighting each other backstabbing each other from  8.30 am to 5.30 pm
Kudos to Steve Yeun, he chose an interesting movie to star in. I'll see it.
I don't get it but I love Steven so...I love it.
hey wait a sec. Negan smashed his head in. Otherwise this is totally legit.
The type of movie that will desensitize you to blood.
What the hell is Glenn doing?
Glenn still looks like he just got out of the negan beating hahaha
Oh glenn, you're so much better than this.
subscribe or ill do it.......
I can't believe how many people have seen The Belko Experiment. I didn't know it was that popular.
It needs more Negan and Lucille, but it's ok
Can't he do a movie or TV show where his face isn't getting smashed?
i´m only watching this movie because of Steven
This looks like the belch experiment but better
I hope Steven kill Jeffrey Dean Morgan in this movie
Sooo... this is literally just a “Belko” movie. Or rip-off whatever.
Isn't that Eugene a 1:28?
another movie for pussies who dont dare to punch someone
Glad to see my chink back in action
This is were Glenn went when he died
Send help, I can't find the release date for this movie, I'm getting March 13th - 17, Oct 7 - 17, and Nov 10th - 17.
He become the walking Dead!
Glen didn't die, Lucille teleported him to another reality  now it makes cents
Oh man i  love to do this in my office.
It's like when you see Daniel Radcliffe in a non-Harry Potter movie
Steven Yeun is my new favorite actor
Hide under the dumpster Glenn! Hurry!, HURRY! It's your only chance!
Looks better than the Belko Experiment.
Damn Glen.  You can't catch a break lol\nEven got Milton on here too lol
Milton's in this too a walking dead reunion
So you're going live in hell with zombies and now you're going live in hell with humans who have gone crazy
Will watch this because of Glenn hahaha
Steven Yeung & Blood Violence: Love It!!
Jeez he hit you in the head that hard huh?
The Belko Experiment.  Did like it when it was called that either.
How does it feel killing your boss? Satisfying?
this is so BELKO EXPERIMENT..!!!!..bruhhhh
This is literally TWD inside the Belko experiment
good thing he has all that training from killing the undead
The Walking Dead meets Corporate America.
I like how this guy sees nothing but everything at the same time\n\n\n\n\nfor example the bat,\nbut on this trailer he kept his eyes opened (pun intended)
What's the chance Steven Yeun will get his head beat in with a baseball bat in this movie?
Glenn: I'll find you.....................and crush your skull.
Glenn and Milton are in the same movie! Sick!!
oh man...this is gonna bomb. no one even liked the belko experiment.
Hmmmmm.....Saw a bunch of brutality & killing. Firearms? Not so much. Thanks for trying to make the point.
Steven's going to survive\nHe has a pretty good practice of six years on TWD
This is like a weird version of the Belko experiment
Glenn save maggie
Glen in earth 2
Oh shhhh its Gleen 😂
Samara is the only reason for me to watch this movie
hey its even got samara weaving in it
28 days + Belko experiment + the office???
Glenn's Back, MOTHERFUCKERS.
Gleeeeenn!!!!
Hey keith
The Belko Experiment ripoff
Yo, Glen.....
Welcome back Glenn!
Rage, Steve.\n\nRage.
Gleen is alive!!!
Glenn and Milton reunited
The belko experiment 2
More mindless violence 👎
Belko Experiment all over again
Hmm, ummmm...yes. yes yes! Will watch!
Looks like Glenn recovered just fine lol
Wtf?! Not gonna lie.. lookin forward to seein this 😂😂
negan must be so proud of glenn hahaha
Is she harley quinn?? Lol
I CANT WAIT😁😁😁😁😁
Looks awful dumb
Muggee Uhl find yoooo
Steven❤❤Glenn
0:23  Will Smith :)
Does it reminds me American Ultra?
Rick would be proud! Wait..
Rage virus
Yeah. Alright.
new kill bill
🔴 *Mayhem 2OI7 ᴴᴰ FuII Mᴏᴠɪᴇ* ( bit.ly/2z80oDB )
wow. this look great
Glenn should have been delivering pizzas
여자 주인공? 너무 이쁘네요.
Twist is probably something like the virus didn't make people violent at all. Somebody respond to this in like a couple months.
Isn't this The Belko Experiment?
Can anyone explain to me what is going on?? Why ppl killing each other in the office? and what virus?
This film ALREADY came out
I'm sure whatever Yeun is in whether it be TV or movies he will always be known for as Glenn.
Just when you think that homerun to the head couldn't get any wost. Huh, Glenn? Im glad he got his eye ball pop back in his socket tho AH HAAA HA HA HA! Were's Negan and Lucille when you need them? Am I right 😂😂👍👍
So, we entertain ourselves with movies about people snapping and killing each other, and then we are suddenly horrified when it plays out in real life wondering how anyone could act like that.
Happy to see you again 😙
belko exp. comedy edition\noh wait
The Belko Experiment hipster version
Wait...really?  Asian lead in a major hollywood movie?
Fuck this shit up, Glenn. Show them who's the baddest mofo out there
If you have Netflix & haven't seen Kick Kroll and John Mulaney's show Oh Hello, you are missing out. It's their stage production on Broadway and it's hysterical. :)
I think John was uncomfortable the whole time because he knows these kids know exactly what to say to bully him accurately.
Kinda creepy no? Lol
what highlighter is Nick Kroll wearing because it's really pretty!
hi i'm nick crompton and no i'm n-
This was a ridiculous waste of time. Not funny....(John Mulaney is a funny dude, BUT not here.)
This is going to be me with my kids
I need 2 black people please?!?
Neosporin is great for after you have popped a zit. Really speeds up the healing process.
name a better duo! i'll wait
Nick looks sorta like my youth pastor who's also named Nick. Creepy.
What is the point of this video
i can’t listen to john’s voice without imagining andrew talking lmao
I could see Nick being a great dad some day and giving funny yet honest advice. And John... tried lol
John Mulaney bull? Why buy the cow? Because that's you love her that's why.
A pathetic example of stupidity masquerading as humor.  Made all the worse because these fools are substituting nonsense for critical information.  If you are lacking the knowledge or guts to tell the truth, don't bring up the subject.
I clicked as soon as I saw John Mulaney 👏🏼
i thought nicks laugh at 3:13 was the little girl
Your video was very well made & inspiring to watch! My favorite way to make money online, legitimately is by earning residual income with Bitcoin... by Auto Trading Loans, I make up to 40% R.O.I. monthly.. Check out this tutorial to learn how:\nhttps://goo.gl/242BgP
Big Mouth is the fucking best
There is no such thing as puberty or sex  we are sexless consciousness
Does Nick Kroll not actually believe in evolution?
But they won't put iddubz in the trending tab
I love this so damn much
Nick Kroll looks exactly like nick from big mouth
There coming if age all over the place.......
I finished Big Mouth in a day in a half 😂😂😂
i will miss the brain cells i lost watching this
If the boy did asked the question What third base is these guys would have answered it better or comfortably than when the girl asked it.
nick kroll definitely made nick to look like him
Nick Kroll should be legally obligated to stay away from children
I’m 13 and damn I wish I could be in this video
ANDREW AND NICK \nBIG MOUTH\n\nIS \n\nAWESOME
John Mulaneys career must be going thru hard times if he is at buzzfeed. BTW who is Nick Kroll?
What was the advice?
watched until he said evolution wasnt real, i didnt realize he was an idiot.
John was so close to cussing at 2:20 😂
Not sure how Nick got House of Pain and 3rd Bass mixed up. Or did I miss some sort of joke?
I guess you can ball park someone’s income bracket by asking them about their butter preferences. “French butter” Lmao. What? Kroll is my hero.

What am I watching.  The Douche is describing puberty to me.
It's a 90s hip hop group lolol Great answer
I'm guessing they only did this to promote Big Mouth and BuzzFeed didn't put it anywhere in the video or the description.

Nick Croll is a pedophile y’all
Be gay. That’s the only message you will get from youtubers
I always love spreading fatty butter on my skin.
only buzzfeed would make a video idea as dumb as this.
This stuff has to stop
I like Big Girls ;(
I lost brain cells watching this shit
Buzzfeed this was a real bad idea with these fellas. Lol
I don’t think these men should be allowed to be near teens
Buzz feed is a very gynocentric channel. It's awful.. 3 girls and 1 homo kid. Jesus Christ.
If you finish a shower with cold water, the pores on your skin will close, preventing dirt and shit from getting in there. \n\nI know it sounds sketchy, but It’s worked very well for me and some friends of mine that also do it. Plus it also prevents you from feeling freezing when you step out of the shower.
They would make such a cute couple
Nick looks almost exactly like his character on Big Mouth...
this could be an entire television show

Here's Buzzfeed, pushing for sexualizing younger teens. 👌👌👌😂😂😂 Kinda how WatchCut threw a bunch of sex toys on a table and mentally scarred a group of kids. Disgust. The left will keep on pushing for normalizing pedophilia, so f*cking disturbing.
What is wrong with society? Having young children questioned by two grown male comedians about intimate topics that should be discussed with their parents? Shame on the parents for allowing this. Disgusting, this is not normal. Wake up

guys do you think pixel 2 XL might suffer bootloops? since it's made by lg again?
I wonder if Pixel2 will support HDMI through the USBC port?
I'm really confused, is there actually a Google Pixel Ultra????
Funny. Google pixel xl #1\nIs better than this..lol\nThe object recognition is cool but that can be patched surely to older models.
no headphone jack is a deal breaker
If only the new pixels had an SD-card reader and a HeadphoneJack, guess I'll go with some other manufacturer :(
also, always listening...for music, yea....
When the track will be released by alltta?
Still waiting for the full review...
Another solid review. Looks like a pretty cool phone, I think the Squeeze feature is very clever.
please please comment on audio quality via dongle. i need to know how it sounds compared to htc 10
Thanks for the thoughts, looking forward to the 2 XL.
Waiting for one plus 6
wtf now everyone is gonna follow google on deleting the headphone jack
Stop copying Apple and removing features. Remember back when an Android without a removeable battery was ridiculous?
i m confused between this one n s8 plus but now i have to makeup my mind for s8 plus :/
I’m just here to hear your voice... I love it baby.. and the phone too
Am i the only one that saw Joshua vergara @androidauthority .
Don't really get the issue with taking out the headphone jack. Yes, it wasn't necessary, but sound quality doesn't degrade, it's a more uniform design, it's less likely to get water damaged, and people shouldn't use their phone while charging it anyway as it degrades the battery over time, or so I've been informed. Any contrasting info/opinions would be appreciated!
Google pixel 2 commercial says earth is flat.
Google lost me at no headphone jack. Note 8 here I come (and I'm more of an apple person...)
I honestly don't get the issue with not having a headphone jack. I mean I like music and enjoy listening to music but that fact that people render that a deal breaker blows my mind. Like you can still use headphones (wired or wireless) and listen to all your content. I truly believe people complain just to complain, like I'd rather have dual front facing speakers than a headphone jack and if the pixel buds have good quality audio they will be a no brainer for me.
Everybody complains about Samsung's fingerprint sensor placement, but your finger actually had to travel further to reach it in the middle on this phone. And those side bezels...blah.
So I know you don't do case reviews, but would you possibly do a review of the Rhino Shield bumper case if you have a minute (specifically for the note 8 since that's the device I'm leaning towards)? There are a few crazy drop tests out there, but I'd trust your review most. Your videos are really honest/genuine, and that's why I stick with and recommend your channel to people. Fingers crossed. Thanks for the great videos. Much appreciated
I'm confused, doesn't it come with an adapter for head phones? I get that you can't charge but you get 8 hours of charge in 15 minutes.
While I think the smaller one should have had the same bezels as the XL, I really like the designs of these phones (kinda blue being exclusive to the smaller one and only on Verizon sucks too).  They balance non-display features with shrunk bezels better than most other phones, but the loss of the headphone jack is a shame.  It doesn't kill me the same way it does other people, but it is far more convenient if you want to plug into random headphones or speakers while out (I know you can keep the adapter with your main headphones, but if you forget those you're kinda screwed even if you can borrow headphones from someone).
Where can we find this Live wallpaper on Google pixel 2 xl?
omg, it's ugly as fuck...
i think LG would make a better pixel phones than HTC
looks like i am the only one liking the bezels on the pixel 2 xl '-'
can you buy me one?
I do like having the headphone jack on the S8, but honestly, I wouldn't mind moving towards USB-C headphones. Computers are coming with USB-C now, tablets and laptops will have it, and all the new phones have it. Except for *cough* apple. Would get potentially better sound quality and functionality too. Also, with wireless charging, you could have the phone charging while plugged in.
Lol people bitching about the headphone jack. i bought some bluetooth ones on amazon for $10 they last 8-9 hours on a charge perfect for at the gym
hmm yeah.. that tiny side bezel does make the screen looked embedded than embossed.. wonder how much that would be .. for the XL.. and wonder WHEN that would be available here in the Phils.. we're so effin late in technology its not funny! :(
I just want those live wallpaper on ios
Jack? Never heard of him.
The deal breaker for me with this phone is the lack of SD expendable store. Yeah the pixel will have unlimited storage but only until 2020. Top it off Google can access your uploaded photos and use them as they please.
No mention of 3.5mm jack? lol
Haha, you said Ok Google and boom, s7 launched google now. Thannks MKBHD, this is why we subscribe!
I'm very much unclear on how they can do that Now Playing feature without sending at least some information to the cloud on a rolling basis - wouldn't every track require its own fingerprint in some kind of massive database? \n\nLet's say they are storing this on the phone for like 100,000 frequently accessed songs, and each song has a combined name and artist of about 50 characters. A unicode character is 4 bytes, so that's already 20+ megabytes of additional data just for the song titles - we haven't even started with the fingerprints yet, which would probably reasonably be at least 1kb each to stay unique and minimize computing burden. We're talking a database the size of hundreds of megabytes just running in the background all the time. \n\nWhat do they have up their sleeves here?
I guess I'm weird but I enjoy the bezles on the side and top doesn't bother me at all
I really don't see that the bezels are that bad on the sides. You didn't say those things for the iPhone X, and the bezels are about the same, if not bigger.
Dual speakers are back. My money is on the Pixel 2!
Google Pixel: Ugly afGoogle Pixel 2: UglyHow many phones wil it take Google to gets its design right?!!
I am not happy that manufacturers are killing off the headphone jack. It's like they're sheep, they think Apple does it so. It should be cool
There still behind Apple and Samsung.
word portrait sounds like Porsche))))))
Too expensive !!!
No headphone jack no buy.
NO SD EXPANSIONS
Eeeww....one ugly phone. Not worth $900.
YOU DICK!  YOU ACTIVATED MY OK GOOGLE HOTWORD!
Your fingernails are always perfectly clipped. Impressive
No closed captions = Fuckin bullshit.
Flop phone
I see joshua 😂
Headphone jack R.I.P 🎧
What's with this Google pixel 2 . Ugly looking phone, no headphone jack, small screen. Just terrible. Samsung S8 all the way
I just bought a laptop and i swear i love watching your videos even more than other youtubers than before. Once you go 4k you cant go 1080p
No squeeze to take a pic? That's something I think could be rather useful over having to tap an onscreen button.
They fucked up by not having a headphone jack. You can already tell that  the adapters for the headphones are going to be troublesome
Why are these phones so damn ugly the first pixel still looks better than these
google have a good hit on business.. However, it look very simple design & expensive...
Why this dude sounds like a white guy...
OnePlus 5 is better \n4gb ram on a new model is a letdown, OP5 gives you 6gb or 8gb which is fucking great\nOxygenOS is very simplistic, borderline vanilla android and will get future updates\nOP5 also looks sleeker and sexier in the midnight black \nGoogle fucked up mate
Nahhhh i dont like it. Gona buy the s8.
Is the picture searching because google got a quantum computer or something else
Yo the price though... Value!
Weirdly I like the desing of the pixel 1st gen more. A combination of the glass placement on 2nd gen with the desing of the 1st would be cool
You are the reason I got my pixel XL
Thank you Google for not going Samsung on us and adding a Google Assistant button ... Samsung could take a hint from you w/ Active Edge
I dunno those round screen corners look really weird. Maybe if the phone was square then it might look fine, but otherwise it looks weird. Maybe because the radius of those corners mismatch the external roundness? And maybe because the top bezel is bigger than the bottom? The back of the phone is as ugly as previous, eeew
Is the top bezel larger than the bottom?
I like the back on the black version, but have to agree that the front of it looks wrong with those bezels on the sides.
I have my Nexus 5, Google phone is Google phone, without apps still a Google phone. So compare with other brands are apps phone. Bad is I can't buy Google phone in my country ==
Thank god headphone jack is there in this phone
Everyone is so obsessed with the damn headphone jack lol Funny thing is, my Audio Technicas sound louder and clearer through the adapter that comes with the iPhone 8 plus than it does in my pixels 3.5 mm jack and the Note 8 I had to return due to a defective screen.
Hi! Nice review! What about sales markets? Will it be sold in Scandinavia? \nWhy/why not?
The bezels looks the same on the iPhone x, Duno what you are complaining about
Is a phone!!!! Now is more about looks of a phone really. You reviewer from YouTube suck. Oh look the phone is to big, to heavy, to white or to black. Is a PHONE..
woah, what's up with the stranger tihngs backdrop?
marques make a review on nokia 8... i m waiting for it..
I wonder if somewhere in the future 2016-2017 will be known as the jackoff age,because all the companies are taking the jacks off the phone...what did you think I was talking about??
Just three words the design sucks
Wish you would roast Google for getting rid of the headphone jack, but it looks like they bought you out
These pixel phones are too much expensive..
Phones come and phones go - who cares
What if someone decided to pick up your phone and simply unlock it by saying okay google? Would they be able to access your phone without a fingerprint?
What is the background and weather widget?
Rip headphone jack u will be missed
bad.
What is wrong with earphone jack port or whatever it's called.....does that create any inconvenience or it's just plain stupidity??!!.....they can have both anyways?!
Samsung must keep the headphone jack.
old pixel is also amoled
It's overpriced
Test Google lens
No headphone jack = no deal.
I'm another video, I heard plastic screen. Is that right?
Love the pixel 2..the only downside  is the glass portion at the back...will buy it if it's all metal on the back..🙁
I hate bezel-less designs. They're unusable...
I love that. Anna is ignoring all the 'don't hold your baby too much' 'rule and doing whatever she feels right for her I love that really like whatever makes ur baby happy and is working no matter what the rules are then do it like so what at least it's working for u and the baby. I love it
Anna, I feel the nursery isn’t a very big room. A little fussing a crying is okay, if she gets hysterical, yes plz pick her up. But if you wanna redo it, maybe put her in her crib, play some soft music or fun kid songs she likes and continuously talk or sing to her as you work to redo her room the way you want so she hears your voice and knows your close. Maybe take breaks every half hr or 10 min to hold her and play with her, then do another 10 min or so. It will take longer then if you were alone (but what doesn’t with kids) but I feel you can get it done. Could work? Worth a shot?
Eduardo: So good morning I am naked cracked me up! 😂😂😂
The way Alessia was looking at Johnathan when he was trying to feed her was like smirking as if to say im not going to open my mouth 😁😁😁
Did they change the title and thumbnail? Thought it was named ‘feeding the baby’ before and had a picture of Alessia and a spoon?
Who remembers when Emilia would just sit and rock and bang her head? 🤣🤣🤣 smh
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  wait why are you talking? 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said  good morning my friendliest friend very slowly and when johnathan asked him if he had a girlfriend he said   yes then when johnathan said what is her name? Eduardo said  emilia and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling at the camera when johnathan was holding her :):) :):) \n\nAnna what you could do is give alessia a dummy for comfort x \n\nJohnathan is a great dad and Anna is a lovely mum x
How cute are your kids!! Love watching your videos 💚💛❤️💙
When are use going to move house
You are such a good mom.  It's a lot of work and you do a wonderful job.  What a good example you are for others when it comes to parenting. Love watching you guys.  Been watching since Emilia was a baby.  It just keeps getting better.
😂Eduardo coughing at Alessia's was so funny , I love the kids theyre so cuttee❤️
It's bounces off and out cause its a spiky ball
Guys it's been officially one year since i've watched sacconejolys every single day! love you guys
alessia is so cuteeee! can we have her haha?
Anna YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL 👏🏻👏🏻
I wish it was cold in Texas where I live 😕 -*jealous*
I hear ya Anna! You rock as a mom :)
The best bit made me roar with laughter Jonathan feeding the baby and get bored face. And Eduardo stripping off. Typical child  very funny
 So good morning. I am naked!
I KNEW I couldn't possibly be the only person in the world who says Whatever song is playing on the radio when I turn it on will depict how the day is going to go !!!!!!!!!!!!! Woooooo !!! Haha !! Thanks Johnathen !! 😍😍😍
Awww Alessia was so happy to see her mommy in the beginning of the video. Too precious for words!!!
Anna you are so right ❤ dont ever listen to other people. A mom always knows whats the best for her children/babys. + you can never cuddle your baby to much. Enjoy every minute ❤
I love Eduardo's passion for Little Mix 😂😂
why don't you put alessia in that like thing that moves up and down and its always moving maybe she'll enjoy it and set it outside the nursery door so she can see you. then maaaybe the little cutie will let you do thing without holding her. I'm sure she will cry at first but yeah shouldn't get her use to always being carried cause that's what happens. she gets spoil and thinks well if I cry mom will pick me up lol
I'm in love with this family.
Alessia is finally in that phase where babies have developed their growing personalities.  She's so cute and tiny petite..., just like Erika!  I think Alessia is going to be the most precious of all your children.  She's just a little beauty with those drop dead gorgeous baby blues and her long dark lashes.  Emilia has a built in best friend and Eduardo will have the company of two great sisters to walk through life with.  Of course, a brother will even the odds for Eduardo and give him a brother/best mate to leverage his odds, but I'll just leave that area up to you guys.  Love your vlogs!!!
Prepping the kids for beer pong, a useful skill in high school and college. Lol
Oh my gosh is it me or is jonathan screaming nonstop at the camera? I wish he would just talk normal sometimes and not so animated.
In Germany it is more common to put the baby in a sleeping bag - because blankets can move over to her face overnight and she might get too less air
eduardo's favorite song is shout out to my ex by little mix?? omg that's funny! hahaha
Let Allessia nap in your room while you tackle the nursery
When are yall moving?? Lol at Jonathan's Comment...Alessia is so cute!
Middle child syndrome 😂😂😂😋😂 I'm a middle child
Anna you are my idol!!!! Such a strong and inspiring woman 🌸🌸
Aleesia is cute.  She loves that camera!  What is everyone being for Halloween?
Do you like to baby wear? Maybe that’s help getting stuff done!
You guys are such a beautiful family. I really love watching your videos. You always lift my spirits up. Keep being awesome. <3
Eduardo I am naked. He always cracks me up.
Anna I'd love to see your nighttime routine! Like makeup removal to bed! :)
Hi everyone, I'm wanting to give it a shot at vlogging so I have memories to look back on. Should my channel be called\n- Zac and Sophie\nor\n- Sophie + boys\nAm open to any other suggestions too! ☺\nMy fiance name is Zac and we have 2 little boys.\nThanks for the help ☺❤
My mom called me her broach because i never wanted to be away from her.
Alessia is a smiling baby like Emilia when she was young. Hahaha! Edwardo was the opposite.
I can't believe Eduardo only 3 it sounds weird when you say interview with my three year old so cute my little cousin is 3 Lenny and he still can't speak very well he can speak but he still can't say proper conversations and when he does try you don't under stand he turnt three 2 weeks ago xx
My brother is Eduardos age and all he wants to do is strip off it's so funny but annoying xx 😘
Love the kiddos. Love u all!
My 3 year old brother likes Steve and Maggie
Anna never mind what others think you are both great parents and no matter what age we are we want and hug from mammy
the most adorable family on the internet 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
“don’t press that button!” Haha Jonathan’s Irish accent really came out there
Omg when Edwardo said that emelia was his girlfriend, dead 😂😂😂
Shoutout to my ex😂 Eduardo is hilarious 😂🙈
Get your baby snuggles while you can.
Johnathan is teaching Amelia how to be the queen of beer pong when she's older 😂😂😂😂
That ball you were using was way to bouncy. Fun though. Alessia looking at Emilia at the dinner table was so cute.
Just keep cuddling as much as you want to. The time flies too quickly.
Eduardos saying is I'm Anna or I'm Elsa😂❤️
Ha-Ha!  Jonathon is so hilarious - Why is the tv show from last night coming over the radio?!  Anna is right, there is no such thing as loving a baby too much! 💕
I adore Eduardo he is just adorable is hillarious and extremely clever and we'll developed for his age!!!😋😉😃👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👶🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕
I laughed sook hard this vlog :\nEmilia: Wait! Why are YOU talking😂😂😂
i love how excited the kids got on the bowl game x so lovely xx
Get a Lillebaby carrier, Anna! It will help so so so much. The 6 in 1 Complete in Woven. Just trust me. SO SOFT.
Yes Eduardo!!! Mini mixer right there!!!!
Amazing parenting! :)

Sweet Eduardo

Ffs

Pobre bb no tiene cámara para mirarla y no tiene protección la cuna el video anterior se metió un golpe muy feo porfavor tengan más cuidado los amoooooooo
EDUARDO GETTING NAKED AND JUMPING IN THE CRIB WITH ALESSIA IS THE MOST BIZARRE THING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED.
Emilia is Eduardo's hero and gf.
I can’t believe Eduardo is only 3! He acts so much older I think!
Poor Edourdo he has  pressure of speech he never gets the chance to verbalise himself fully. Jonathon always has to be yapping  ALL the time
Emilia saying Give me some hope LOL she is adorable
I haven't watched lately!  What happed with the new house? Are they getting a new house like they said? Or what happened?
You were saying we're moving soon and when we move a lot these past few weeks, now it's all we're never moving what happened??! Please fill us in more about this, it's so confusing 🤔
Ok I Alesia's adorable we get it. But did they forget they have 2 other kids? I know babies attract more views🙄 but come on. Almost every thumbnail lately has been Alessia
What day was this filmed on. Are the vlogs not filmed the day before they're uploaded anymore?😔😭
watch +kavos video about family vloggers
I really hope you taught Emilia and Eduardo they're not supposed to climb in the cot with Alessia unless you or Anna are there. I'm imaging all sorts of tragic scenarios here...
Silly spoons for feeding babies
Lol @ Jonathan feeding alessia, typical Man slopping it everywhere 😂
At 6:49 Edwardo is naked 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Anna, I love you honesty. I had a baby boy around the same time as you did Alessia (I think they are about 2 weeks apart) and with it being my second I have really struggled with some of the day to day!! I think you're doing an amazing job and you are just so real!! Thank you for making me fee like I am doing a great job too. Xxx
Does anyone know what is Vodafone please leave in the comments
Eduardo is an expressive child. He have a big heart and plenty of love to give. Him getting naked is his way of saying that he does not want Alessia getting the grubbiness from his school clothes. I am sure his parents will teach him the norm of things as he grows older. He is only 3 For God's sake....
Have you tried baby wearing so you can get stuff done? All my friends swear by it to get the housework done!
Omg she slept whole night on her tummy!Is it safe to do so.Bit confused as i was told to make my baby sleep on her back by my midwife😔
I finally realized who Anna reminds me of: Julia Roberts
I don t know when they are moving but it s hard to take all the things that they need in the new house and they have 2 kids in school and a baby it must be hard
Jonathan what is with Eduardo stripping of all his clothing when he goes in allesia bedroom  it’s a little odd
Ive never comment but I just want to tell you I understand how you feel about the whole weight thing. Im 4'8 and have always weighed under 100 pounds to 110. I had a baby girl around the same time as your baby girl. Her name is Ahsoka Nohea born 7-11-17. My husband friends give him advise about my pregnancy but they were from wifes that didnt have the same difficulties I had. I was sick the whole time. My body expanded everywhere, shoulders, face, neck, sides and my feets were so swollen you could see the water coming out of my legs if you touched it. I had heartburn that no amount of tums could cure. I tried exercising but I could barely walk for 30 mins without having to sit down. I tried eating heathly but I would throw it up oh and water I would throw up too. My weight gain and the fact we were dealing with a big move made me very emotional. I'm just not losing the weight as fast as all the other mommies. Always i dont want this to be a downer but just know your not alone.
4:58 That face makes my heart MELT TT-TT <3
Bubz, you literally have the perfect family. 2 adorable dogs, an awesome son who is 2 years older than your beautiful daughter, and an amazing husband. I love your family, P.S. you neeeeed to add ayla to the intro :DDDD
You are beautiful to me ! :) Family can be rude most of the time!
Second borns always seem so chill. They’re just happy to watch what’s going on and be part of the family. First borns have no chill!! Lol.\nI’ve got an 18mo daughter and I can’t imagine having another sibling in the house. She demands your full attention! Lol. Maybe it’s a first born girl thing? 👸🏼😳
But Lindy you’re 10x the mum any there kid has!
Can someone explain what Bubz means by feeling condemned by a 3 year old? I'm just confused why she lied about Issac's age o.O??
Bubz, i have a question: if it is a cultural thing for your Chinese relatives to be blunt, wouldn't it be culturally okay to be blunt back at them? And just answer with something like yes, but I just had a baby and you are hurting my feelings? Or just it only go one way?
cute
I am absolutely dreading seeing family in Hong Kong!! \n\n‘Why have you gained weight? Why don’t you have a job after university? Well that’s what you get for taking a creative subject...’  ffs 😐
I think your face is just a little fuller than it used to be and that is why they notice it so much more but I think you look amazing Bubz. Healthy and happy and your family looks the same. Like you said in time it will change and you did just have a baby.
Omg I cried when you all were saying good night to Isaac 😭 oh my pregnancy hormones
This kid stopped, said in English that Lindy is 10 times his age.... these 3 year olds out here.. amazing 😩😩
Naturally you have baby weight atm but tbh it's not even that much! Youre Still quite slim even with the gain, you'll be back to your usual size soon but just remember size isn't everything and you are beautiful no matter what!
you look perfect ❤ and you are such an inspiration ❤
Both your kids are adorable, and I love the body positivity you're expressing.  My relatives are the same way regarding my weight gain (which is really from stress eating because of studies lol), but it's nice to hear how you deal with it.  Ayla and Isaac are so cute!  Thanks bubz <3
A friend of mine had similar issues after she had her kid. I went to her daughter’s first birthday party and she took a moment to sit with me in a private corner and vent that one of her family members had criticized her choice of outfit for the occasion because it made her look fat. She almost broke down in tears. I don’t understand how anyone, especially family members can put down a woman who is pregnant or has given birth recently.
They want you to have a happy marriage. The lack of momentum leads to further loss momentum. Weight gain strains attraction between the husband and wife.\n\nThey want a happy family. If it's happy wife happy life than there is also the equivalent for the husband side. Relationships require dual effort from both sides.\n\nThis is why they say such things. It's out of care.
Normally boy looks like mom and girl looks like dad but urs is the opposite 🙃 I actually like it that way .... goofy son and pretty daughter ☺️
Ayla is getting so big already.. she's only 2months old. She looks so much like her Mummy!
She's tiny. And her babies are born chubby and cute
Ayla is such a happy Bub😄
The same thing happened to me although I'm not overweight even after baby .. My family would call me fat. And after all the sleepless days or nights it could definitely be a damper on the spirits. Keep up mummy bubz u r doing so well! They really don know what they r saying. We r the best mums to our kids for giving them what we can
Can you make a “how to vlog“ video?
It's usually the older generations that do this too.\nMy mom is my worst reminder of all my insecurities cause she always says I'm fat even though I'm not and then I start believing her :C
i will never get tired of bubz putting lotion on her babies
How old Isaac is?
Hi Bubz, been a subbie for a long time but not been much of a commentor. However just wanted to say you are doing an amazing job! The fat shaming and image expectations of HK or the asian culture is ridiculous and I admire that you are trying to not let it get to you. I recently moved to HK and I have never been skinny, had fat comments made to me all the time, mostly from relatives or family friends. Coming here has showed me that even your boss or colleagues feel they are right to comment on your weight and how you should look. It got to me but we can only shrug it off cos we can never meet these so called expectations. We can be too skinny, too fat, too tall, too short! The list goes on!
You have a beautiful family bubz . Love ya 💕 I love when Isaac says hi mummy . So sweet 😭😍
I love when you show Ayla's facials. She looks so happy and relaxed 😊😊
Isaac is such a sweetheart.
You look GORGEOUS bubz!! Dont worry about your body it created an amazing gift and blessed you with a healthy baby. It just needs time to recover
I love Isaac so much it hurts :(
Don't worry about Isaac, he will learn when he's ready. Kids develop at all different rates. I have a son just few months younger Isaac and I always kept stressing he doesn't know this or that. It's not worth it. He's a healthy, happy boy. That's all that matters.
Isaac is so sweet ^^
Congratulations with the birthdelivery of your daughter. What is she beautiful. Wish you alots joy & happiness♡
Try to wipe her tongue with glycerin it will get rid of all the residual milk
9:33 Don't hurt my mum. I'll cut you with my chin! D:<
I love you big much daddy😂❤️
Bubz, you have two beautiful children and are beautiful just the way you are on the inside and out. I love your sweet, kind, sincere, and down-to-earth personality. God bless you, Tim, and your two little ones! Sending love and hugs your way! ♥♥
That child who new his multiples sounds adorable. XD
No joke in hongkong the kids have too much competition kid start there addition at like 2 and learn algebra at 5 or something
Can someone tell me what camera that is she’s using to vlog???
ayla bathing looks so much like Isaac when he was her age... omoooo so cute.. love them chubbchubb rolls
Love you, Lindy <3
Issac is super adorable. He's so grown up now!
Issac is one of the sweetest boys I have ever seen <3
Awwwww she's a chunky baby just like isaac was ❤️❤️❤️
Ayla is the cutest, just like her mom! Also, I have that same little portable fan. IT'S LIFE CHANGING. I like to use it in the morning to help facial mists or makeup sprays dry faster, too. xD
Bubz , You Are An Excellent Example Of A Lovely Human Being... ! 😊
You are perfect the way you are. I am sick of the world trying to make girls and women think they must be perfect based on social values.
I’m honestly surprised that so many people are commenting on your weight because you don’t even look like you’ve gained to me. I think you look great!
Isaac is such a polite and well mannered kid, well done to you both. I come from a Chinese family too, so I totally understand where you are coming from. I know I will never do it to my kids when they get older ❤️
Oh so Ayla has cradle cap. That's easy, coconut oil or baby oil will soften the skin then gently get a fine tooth comb and gently run it along the skin. I was able to get my son's cradle cap off that way. It's normal and common, and usually happens around newborn age to 1 years old
Hey bubz really my son is also 3 but he s not even interested in abc or ne learning thing it make me sad
I’m due my first baby any day now and I was at a wedding about 8 weeks ago. One of the grandmas looked at me when I was eating and said wow you still have a while to go yet and you are pretty big. I managed to laugh it off but I was not expecting comments like that! I’m a UK size 8 normally and I’m probably a UK size 12 now. I just keep thinking of how sore you must have been during the final weeks now I am there. You did amazing!
5:00 And this is how God came into play/ was invented :D lol
Hi Bubz-mommy ! im glad you all are ok there! i hope your little doggies are ok also! please tell us about them at next video! :)
Feel the same way with my 2 toddlers..😭
lol never miss an arm day😂😂😂
Loved how she randomly spit on your hand
Your not fat because, that what happen when you give brith and it call beauty and plus you should said I also human begin too so sometime my body is not going to be like as you wanted my body to look afther getting brith because I also getting old so there no need to worry about my body no more because I already have someone who love me for who I am and how I look like and take care of my two kids. 😊😍😘 but it just depend on what you decide and choose so yea . 😊 and plus your baby is so cute when she yawn 😍😘.
LOVE your makeup whenever you're in Hong Kong! Looks so much fresh :D
so cute😍😍😍 I like the way you and Tim teach your children. Love care.
She is so cute!
Isaac is growing so fast 😭 what a cutie
She's such a happy baby I'm so in love
This kids make my day. SOO CUTE 😍😍
Bubz you look beautiful, and your babies look so happy.
My grandma used to tell everybody, including me: 'you're fat!' while she would take a big piece of your belly or your butt to prove her point. And she would say this as a compliment, very happy that at last the kids and teens in her family put some meat on their bones... We didn't like it at all, compliment or not. But she was adorable in everything else, so... We gave her that privilege of being our personal scale.
Isaac seems to be speaking more and more, and he is so polite! He really is getting cuter and cuter by the day <3
Just tell them sometimes that is the eye opening for them I know that horrible felling
People need to stop with how one looks because everyone is made in God's image and we should Embrace our Individuality! not compare,their opinion is their opinion and it's better if they just chill out
Ah I get it a lot too....the constant you're so fat! Lose some weight! I've honestly given up trying to say no, I'm healthy! It's quite bad as I am at the age when girls feel the most vulnerable to these comments and do extreme things to make themselves perfect. However, rather than feeling crappy about it, I use it to my advantage and make jokes about it. I've been hearing the comments over and over I basically immune to it 😄
ohh Lindy,  may I know your lipstick ? that you wore in the car.  it's look so nice on you :)
bubz: who's a pretty girl?\nayla: lol das me
the disconnect between the mentality of asian relatives who live in asia vs. your own upbringing as an asian in a western country will always exist. you just need to remember that in their culture, it's automatically assumed that every individual wants to be thin. they're not telling you you're chubby or fat because they don't love you, but rather it's because they care about you and are trying to be helpful in the way that they think they should be.\n\nwhich is totally not to invalidate anything you're feeling, because i've absolutely been there too. i gained about 15 pounds in the last year and a half and while i'm not fat, i look noticeably different to my family. when i'm just sitting there with my mom and my sister having unrelated conversations and my mom suddenly finds another way to bring up my weight and my out of control habits, it makes me feel like she can't even see her own daughter as anything but a measurement of fat. but you just have to keep doing what you're doing and let it roll off you, while reminding yourself that it's not a matter of love or not-love, but just difference.
Hi bubz! Love your videos! You are doing so well only having a baby 2 months ago and looking after two kids! Don't worry about what people say, I cannot understand them, esp the women who probably have been through the same thing! My daughter is exactly 2 months older than Ayla and had the same white patch on her tongue, just gently brush with some cooled boiled water and toothbrush and it all went away! I read if you do not, then it can lead to thrush ... all the best :)
#1 - You are AMAZING! And you're so right, it took your body 9+ months to make that adorable little girl of yours and it's going to take time to heal.\n#2 - She could have cradle cap. My son had it. You just need to get a little brush and gently scrub her scalp with some soap and warm water. It will go away soon enough. \n😊💖
Older family members are never held responsible for their hurtful words because others make excuses for them, such as, It's just a generation/culture thing!, or, They honestly feel like they are helping you. None of the hurtful comments will ever stop until you hold them accountable for it.
Hi Bubz, so glad you guys back to Hong Kong. I have been watched your videos for such a long time.But i was like the silent viewer ,quite shy to leave a comment.Your videos are so amazing and inspirational.It is trilled to see you guys vlogging, from seeing Tim's proposal until Ayla is born,. I really feel like being part of your family. I know Youtube has tons of youtubers but you guys are absolutely  be my favorite. I remember once you asked Tim what is the thing that he miss the most in HK, he said food!!!! Since I am currently working at yuen long ,i always looking for amazing dish for lunch , i would just killing me by not sharing the good food for you guys.Bubz i know you love dim sum you mentioned in the video back in Belfast said you didn't find a place in hk served good dim sum.I found a place call Big Belly at 教育路they did serve nice dim sum,you should try it!!!!!Anyway wish your family all the best ,healthy and happy ^^Have a nice time in Hong Kong .God bless your family .
all children develop different I wouldn't beat yourself up over lying about your sons age, I'm sure most mom's on here have told some porkies now and then. lol

💝💝💝💝💝💖💖💖💖💖
If you rinse out a clean wash cloth you can use it to gentle clean Lala's tongue just like teeth brushing to help with the white tongue. I used to do it once daily- gently because breast milk is so fatty :) is even do it to clean the sides of his cheeks, gum stimulation to help with milk teeth and the roof of he younger. You just gotta go slow as not to hit their gag reflex lol she's so cute!!
you are really fat these days, bubz

They are one of my favorite groups!
too good at goodbye please !!!
*tears. My favorite Tom Petty song is Alright For Now. He's alright forever now.
Oh I love the older bluegrass feel... Tom Petty will be so missed  #WootWOTE
I've loved Tom Petty ever since my dad played his music at hime when I was a boy. That's been 25 years ago. I was very sad when I read he passed away, I will miss him. He was unique.
You guys should do let me go by hailee steinfeld ft. Florida Georgia Line
Someone can recommend me songs like this i like how it sound but is the first time i heard something like this
Great tribute guys!   You rock in every since of the word
You guys are amazing!! Love this so much! Great tribute to Tom Petty <3
I was so satisfied when the camera turned to the bearded guy in the hammock.
Hmmmm...never heard of you cats before.\nDigging your sound as we morn the loss of a truly great artist.\nWell met. \npeace
R.I.P. Mr.Petty,great song performed by some great artists right there.love it ❤❤👍👍(on another note how in the hell this video got 72 dislike?)
Are they hiring people? I could be those two on the right easily. Clap some random shit and get to be with WOTE in a video...!
Awesome Tribute.  1st concert I ever saw was Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, at Hec Edmundsen pavilion at UW. Saw him 3 times and loved every show. Would you consider covering Spike, off of Southern Accents, or pack up the plantation live version?  Love Your Music!
They should do a cover of Shut Up and Dance. Who agrees?
Wow... I'm not into this music genre but I love the vibe you guys give off. The sound is smooth. Nice in general. 👍
Another amazing cover and big props to Tom's legacy!
Top downloaded WOTE on Google play (just downloaded it myself) Very cool all the proceeds going to the Heart and Stroke Foundation :D
I would pay good money to sit by the fire with these guys and just listen
When I saw this was a  Tommy Petty cover, I was upset. But after watching and listening I was smiling, singing and clapping😁 Amazing job and don't think Tom would have disagreed...how fun!
You guys are always so amazing.
this kind of looks like a bunch of camp counselors have abandoned all the children
Love this. Thanks Walk of the Earth It's a pleasure to see what you do with music and video and your generosity.
We love you guys!!!!! Amazing cover. Thanks.
Marshal looks like he would be very much at home on a tractor
I thought this was going to suck.  I was wrong.  RIP Tommy boy
Ohh damn. How much I've missed you guys.
amazing vibes and color tones, makes me wanna just sit with them and listen
hi. im one of your fans from indonesia. can i request for the next song Walk off the earth use Angklung or Kolintang. :)
Please don't ever stop doing this! You guys are too good :)
that was pretty amazing\nwell done!
Thankyou very much guy's. That was such a  beautiful rendition of the late Tom Petty's  song. Another Legend we all loved. RIP Tom Petty ❤ \nYou rock!
I'm not going to lie and say that I didn't tear up from trying to hold back emotions about this loss. You guys did a great job, I think it's truly good enough for tom
What a great cover! Thank you, thank you, thank you, and thank you some more.
so well done!! Tom is smiling down! RIP Tom Petty
Lovely tribute to one of the best!  RIP Mr. Petty.

So much love in the song!
As always, this cover did not disappoint. My 4 year old can't get enough of you guys. He told us today that he has three favorite seasons... summer, fall and walk off the earth 😂 from the mouths of babes. #playburlingtonagain
Totally did it justice dudes and dudette. So great ❤️❤️❤️
Great tribute as far as I'm concerned.  Love the accordion.

You guys are amazing! Wonderful tribite to an amazing music icon!
If you've never seen the Postman with Kevin Costner.watch tom pettys eyes in the basket scene! That's living!!🖒🖒😉RIP
Tom petty was my friend when I really didn't have any , like many  I feel I have known  him for over thirty five years,have a bad day and put tom in it was hard to stay down, thank you for this
A wonderful tribute to a man that will be sorely missed thank you guys!🌱🌿🍀🌲🔥💨💨😀
Fantastic job guys!!!!!! I absolutely loved this, very harmonious! Put a smile on my face. You should do a little Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac, y'all would be great at it after hearing this.
Thank you! Great tribute to Tom Petty, who we all will miss. You truly embrace us all with the spirit of music, in all you do. I am now going to go hug my husband, who turned me on to your videos several years ago, and I have to thank him, too! It's a family of the world thing. Then, on to your Patreon page!
lost all respect for tom petty when he sued sam smith for royalties because tom was broke. stay with me doesn't have the same melodies or respective choruses as i won't back down. sad
Great tribute to Tom, great artist played by great artists!
That long haired guy is really good at the harmonica
Walk off the earth has done it again.....niiiice
If there was a way to commemorate him, well, i think yall did awesome job

Or you can be Tyler Oakley the thespian from escape the night
I may or may not have shrieked when I saw two of my favourite things in one video!!!!! Tyler you must go play Evan on Broadway right now thanks.
How do we get an official Evan Hansen polo shirt?? I would love to be Evan for Halloween but I NEED THE SHIRT!!
Isn't that Cameron Dallas?
Everyone’s talking about the dear Evan Hansen costume but my first while watching this was, “I’d never be able to wear that la croix costume. My lack of spatial awareness plus no arms to keep balance/break a fall. It’s a clumsy person’s nightmare”.
Did you fall or did you let go?
IM SCREAMING WHO IS THE DISCREET YOUTUBER

I don't know 'Dear Evan Hansen', but I do know Connor Franta messed up his arm once, and he had a cast and/or sling. I thought he was Connor Franta. I was legitametly disappointed when he wasn't.

The video I never thought I needed
WAIT WHERE CAN I GET THE EVAN HANSEN SHIRT
When I first saw the dear Evan Hansen one and the name Connor on it I thought it was supposed to be about Connor Franca lol
I have a theory for Zootopia. I noticed Judy is the smallist police officer, so for smaller animals particularly mice sized do they have their own police or are they free to do what they want without worrying about cops? IE. The godfather mouse and his gang. \nThats a little messed up I think?
GEEEEZZZ!  Leave the relationShips to OTPs, please!\n\nWhy not just say all the princess are really sisters separated at birth and the whole stepmother thing is just one big foster program, while you're at?!?! (I rage-typed that, by the way.)
Definitely ice powers. #thecoldneverbotheredmeanyway. That's what comes of growing up in Minnesota.
I'd choose ice powers
i think mat pat's theory made more sense
I have a theory for you just do a Jelsa theory
Maybe Ariendelle is a magic country and Anna is unfortunatly a fluke child. #RipMagicAnna
0:00 Heyyyyy brother! Jay, it's BEN a while...
Anna & Elsa = not sisters\nRapunzal & Elsa =sisters \nSo therefore anna is elsa & Rapunzals sister.😊😀
Stay in the same place please u keep jumpin around
Film theory already covered this just to let you know
i don't understand though, how do they both have powers, so to say since Rapunzel's mother  was the only one to drink the tea of the flower. Wouldn't Elsa's mother have had to drink it as well in order for her to have powers? Also how is it it that Anna doesn't have powers?  I don't know however here is this video that also speaks about frozen and tangled this theory makes more sense though.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhf9dekzyq4\n\nBut i still wanna know more.
I'd choose the ice powers because I live in Florida and if I had ice powers I might actually go outside.
Maybe Olaf is related to Jack Overland? Lol
Wait, I thought the theory was that Elsa and Rapunzel were twins, not cousins.
Healing hair. Then I could heal myself/others when my inner clumsiness rears its ugly head.
YOU GUYS LIVE SO CLOSE TO ME I LIVE IN RADFORD AND DO YALL GO TO THE RONANOKE MALL AND THE PUPPY LOVE AHHHHHH IM FLIPPING OUT
Where did you get the Pixar red yellow and blue balls in the background?
Answer to the question at the end...ICE POWERS😆
....The Tarzan thing is them trolling you. Was I the only one who watched the Making of Frozen extra which was just one long musical number asking that then ending in We don't know!? That was when I realized that Disney, especially the people involved in Frozen, had learned how to troll and not to trust them. Which doesn't even touch on things like hair color not being the same...\n\nThat said, I do kinda like the cousin idea. It makes more sense and it's interesting.
They've done this before...\n But I can still appreciate it!
Them being cousins makes way more since than them being sisters, Nice video!
Here's a question I want answered and it's about Toy Story 3. The monkey looks over the woody and everyone else by a security camera right. And the whole point of a security camera is record things like break ins and fires right, so the camera must be recording 24/7. So why hasn't the person who looks over the footage not see toys locking in other toys in shelves?
what happened to that theory that Elsa is Rapunzels sister?
😱😱The flower part in Moana is mind blowing!!
If fire weren't an option, I would definitely go with the ice powers.
Hey Carlin Brothers!!!! I happen to notice that you guys didn't do a Harry Potter video having to do with a lot of things being in 7's. There are 7 books, 7 quidditch players, 7 floors in Hogwarts, etc. This needs to be explained!!!!!!!!
U should make a theory bout a connection of UP and IT
Dear stars we are just making a Pixar theory with Disney movies now aren't we? \nWonderful. Let's link the Marvel universe to Treasure Planet now. \n\nI'm not being sarcastic let's do it.
I don’t understand something about the Tarzan theory. If they where going to a wedding in the German kingdom of Corona departing from the Scandinavian kingdom of Arendelle than why the heck did their ship crash in Africa?\n\n\n\nP.S. It’s totally a German kingdom with names like Rapunzel, Eugene Fitzherbert, and Mother Gothel.
TARZAN IS NOT RELATED to the sisters! I'm calling bullshit on the director's part. It literally doesn't make sense. Fight me.
can you make a theory about why mother gothel isnt allowed to see pascal because when mother gothel is shouting rapunzel to let down her hair she says to pascal to not let her see him??
Theory: Anna is an only child and Rapunzel and Elsa are sisters\n[don't deny it, it makes sense]
Fun fact the Corona is a layer of plasma that surrounds the sun and it hotter than the sun's surface.
I have to say, didn't the director bring up the Tarzan relation and dismiss it in the same statement? Pretty much saying that this was their fantasy (with Surf's Up being on the other side of the island).
I will call you king 😍😂
Excuse me, what? Tarzan is their brother?? What's the use in establishing that now? Those stories are completely unrelated. Frozen is a fairy tale, magic, trolls, supernatural powers. Tarzan, despite the Disneyfication, happens in the real world. Also timelines and locations make no sense whatsoever.
Answer to the question: Neither. I wanna teleport. If I get ice powers, I will freeze the world and hold it hostage until someone can give me teleporting powers.
Ya know how Ben said, “Gosh, why can’t Olaf just be related to someone else in the Disney universe?” Well he technically kills his brother if ya think about it.... I mean since Elsa is kind of like his mom since she made him and she also made the snow monster guy Olaf and Snowball would be brothers. So Ben technically Olaf WAS related to someone else in the Disney universe.
Ice powers. Becuase Elsa can do way more than just control ice. She can change people's outfits. She can change her makeup. She can make her hair pass through her shoulder.
It took me half the video before I realised he changed shirts LOL
Did you know the location in frozen is based on the norwegian terrain. By the way norway kind of suck
In toy story of terror, there is an accepts bnl credit card sticker
Ice powers, I like to keep my hair short lol
Ice\nLike if you agree
I was thinking about how disney parents are dead but rapunzel's, merida's and mulan's parents aren't dead
Wait - what if it is ELEMENTS not MAGIC. What if Moana us the missing element? Anna made a fire to defeat the wolves, Elsa has ice powers, MOANA IS GOOD WITH WATER
I would love to have magic ice powers, I would build a giant ice castle and make magic snowmen to do my bidding.
okay, at first I was disappointed because this felt like old news, but then I looked up the video I thought you guys made, and it was FilmTheory. Sorry, guys. I do wonder what your thoughts are on their theory though.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhf9dekzyq4
Make a theory on the golden compass (the northern lights)
I like the film theorists theory about Elsa being adopted and rapunzel being sisters better
ICE! then i could be like iceman!\niceman is seriously COOL.
If Elsa has ice powers does that mean she's always cold? ._.
I DARE you to tell this to MatPat I DARE u
Hehe I love using dad's account
You become a prince if you marry a Queen. Even if you don’t have any previous title.
Hey, I got a theory for you that has bothered me. In the 1st Harry Potter movie we see that Harry is staying with his AUNT and UNCLE. Why not his nanny and grandad? Why his aunt and uncle specifically?
Wait. The Tarzan one was confirmed? I thought several people had debunked it
I like the idea of Tarzan and the Frozen sister's being siblings, but the times don't make sense. Frozen/Tangled take place in the 1840s, where as Tarzan takes place in the 1910s. So unless their parents lived another 40ish years on the island before having Tarzan (putting them anywhere between 60 and 80) and then dying, it's not very likely. Of course that would put Tarzan in his 30s during the time of the movie, meaning his parents dying in 1880s. I don't know how old truly was in the film, but those are the times that make them most sense. Sorry Carlin Brothers, the facts don't lie
yep, you're right ben, hot pockets are hotter then the FRIGGEN SUN!\n#triggered
Hopefully will get more hint and connections in Tangled Before Ever After.
Why do I see the Happy Death Day ad on a SuperCarlinBrothers Frozen theory? This does not match.
Ice powers
STAR WARS LAST JEDI TRAILER BREAKDOWN
Lol
ice powers
ice totaly ice powers
Magical hair!
ice powers
I’d choose saving Asia. #Mulanismyfavee
well you would be PRINCE Ben because you would be the prince consort. maybe not king but its better than nothing. not half bad.
What if Elsa and Rapunzel were sisters? That'd explain Elsa's looks and powers. Also I'd probably prefer Rapunzel's hair with Elsa's powers, how am I supposed to choose?!
5:33 Sun compared to Hot Pockets...\nI vote hot pockets!
#deadpool or #jackfrost

Dude ur editing us slipping

Ice duh
Ice powers
Nope. Still with the the theory that Elsa a d Repunzel are siblings and Anna is their cousin.
I thought Anna and Elsa weren't sisters and Rapunzel and Elsa were. Honestly there's way more evidence over on Film Theory and more stale memes\n\n\n\nStill love SuperCarlinBrothers though, you do make other awesome theories
Ever wonder what happened to Elliot Stabler of Law & Order: SVU? Well we found out.
God, I can't wait for this. If you guys at Syfy are finally making good shows, I think it's fine for them to not always be the genre your name dictates.
You had me at Christopher Meloni dabbing while his head was a blood fountain... AND ITS OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!
There must be something seriously wrong with me... Because I am going to enjoy the crap out of this show!
Elliot. Plz come back.
When Stabler misses Olivia...
I see Detective Stabler and I am down.
Detective Stabler???? Ha - this looks like a trip. Kind of it to it tho, plus I like how the scenes are shot & edited.
I GOTTA see this.
Pause at :49. I swear one of these paramedics is Jon snow
This looks so good!
This. Looks. AMAZING!!!!!!!
Welcome back Meloni!
So no crank 3 :(
Reminds me of I man.
sooooo a cop with a cartoon character, hmmm....reminds me of another movie with the same concept...
This will be a hard R right? Not that it will full of violence but no uses of the F-word and stuff? Don't know what the policy of SYFY is.
For some reason I want to hear Carpenter Brut - Roller Mobster on one of the episodes. Can you imagine?
Anyone know the song in the beginning when he’s dancing?
WHAT IS THIS I DON'T EVEN
Anyone know the song they used? It kind of reminded me of Prodigy. Would like to hear more.
i know ya seen that dab at 00:13
I'd watch anything with Chris Meloni in it.
Why he left SVU?  He was my favorite character.
Meloni is doing the batman voice
I love how the blood just came rushing out when he dabbed
At the end of this show series, he is finally arrested and sent to jail under the name Chris Keller.
where do i get that disco jingle bells track?
What is the song in this trailer?
I REALLY hope this is as good as it looks .... and not another Son of Zorn
The Animation on him Blew me away! This is a Television Show, Could a TED TV Show be possible now?!
DROP DEAD FRED!
So excited for this.  Syfy just keeps on getting better and better as a network. I hope this continues that trend.
Eu tenho o encadernado da Devir. Apesar de ser bem violenta a história é o maior barato. Muito ansioso por esta série. Acho que não vai dar errado.
LONG LIVE GRANT MORRISON!!!
Shows have gotten fucking weird.
Come back to SVU
Amazing!!!
This looks amazing!!
Поезд сделал БУМ!
This. Looks. Amazing!
Beginning scene remind me of Rorschart
This looks amazing.
I was kinda in, then the cartoon thing showed up and I was way out.
Wow. This looks really good.
And you cancelled Dark Matter for this? Why should I watch anything you make when that show had just as high (if not higher) ratings than your other shows. I will not invest my time in your shows. You only cancel them -- even if they are going strong.
entertain you with violence.. And then cry their agenda all over the place.....
awesome trailer,  I can't wait for this
Manoooo que fodaa ansioso pra ver já!
Ohhh i definitely will be watching this!
this looks amazing
oh heck ya! I'm excited for this
I think you got one, Syfy\n 😂😂😂
I've never really been into Syfy shows but this looks amazing! I am so watching this!!!
😍 #FuckYeah

I'm having really bad depression symptoms right now & watching your videos helps me calm down and sleep
The coat looks like the coat that Tyler bought for Safiya for their challenge!
The outfit where he had the fanny pack, and the tiger shirt reminded me of Allen from the hangover!! Just needed the white pants!!!

Jenna's jacket is giving me Missy Elliott vibes and I am SO here for it.\nEverything about this was beyond enjoyable.
Jenna's looking sexy, rocking those glasses! Julien is such a cutie
Julian reminded me of Zach Galifianakis from The Hangover when he wore the blue polo shirt and khaki pants!!
Why is Jenna dressed 2008 hot with the big hoop earrings and big poofy jacket! Lol
this is the greatest video of all time. ALL TIME.
JENNA! you have to do the nose hair extensions thing people are doing with fake eyelashes!! xD would be hilarious!!! \nLike If You Agree!!

Julien slightly thrusting while holding peach makes me very uncomfortable
Fook you
Your videos suck now days
i wonder what mosquitoes do to contribute to humanity
people being scared of bugs/insects is realy cringey to watch because they're so interesting and most of them are harmless
i'd rather spare bees and wasp
Just have force field that kills bugs within 10 yards of you
all we just need is just more useful bugs like bees and get rid of the digusting bugs like moths or cockroches
Don’t kill all bugs just the annoying and dangerous ones agreed
Just kill the mosquitos and flys and done
Remember when dinosaurs are extinct?  Well i hope that mosquitoes go extinct in 20 years
If there was no such thing as a wasp, my life would be 100000000000000000x better
We would all die 15 minutes later
We would die if insects died
3:04 There's a mosquito in my room right now and I cant find it
If every bug died we die as well finish you don't even need too watch the video all you have is a comment BOOM WIN WIN
The Life devs are working on removing the bugs.
If insects dissipated, in 50 years everything on earth will die\n\n\n\n\nIf humans disappeared, in 50 years the earth will flourish
One we make fake bugs can we kill al da bugs?
I believe the Jews are similar to bugs so they might be cool.
On a forum a read a quote and it said 'when someone says he or she is an animal lover but says he or she hates bugs, they are hating 84% of all animals.
Sooo you're saying that getting rid of all bugs is BAD!!!!😶.And I'm still afraid of bugs.
If cockroaches, water bugs, mosquitoes and other bugs that people are mostly afraid of(including me) are gone, then we wont have to worry about bugs anymore.
This video is really *bugging* me...
Don't pin me let me drown in the comints
If we .would've only killed .all mosquitoes it would've all just been happiness
“I wish spiders would just all die”\n“But then other bugs would have a much higher population!”\n“So lets just kill all of the bugs”\nWhat happens next? Watch till the end of this video!
I just want spiders and cockroaches out of this world
I think useless insect should be all killed
U only need to kill bugs in yo house dudes
I just thought back to the bee movie when the bees stopped working and everything died
Let's just get rid of mosquitos
Great video!!! Really interesting. By the way I just uploaded my new track 'Kingdom Lost' so please come and check that out on my channel :)
Insects will always scare the cap out of me!
I keep a flamethrower close at all times, damm insects, you shall BURN!!!!
What we keep bees and flies
What would happen if all the flies died at once
I have a question, life noggin; what would the technology in the future? would we start using magnet motors instead of our average motors in cars? k thanks!
Well then. But who says we still can't murder mosquitos?
Bugs i wish were extincted are\nMosquitos \nFire ants\nAnd head lice
Just stab the pests in the eye and keep the bees and crap.
what would happen if only spiders die?\n\ni don't even care if the world will end as long as im not scared of those creepy eight legged beasts
No I don't recknet phobia
Im not even scared of  bugs... I am sacred of computer bugs tho, i dont want to have my computer glitched ;-;
The only bugs I kill are misqitos and wasps. My friend has an allergy to wasps and if he gets bit he can go into a coma. BUT WHY ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF COCKROACHES??!??!?!?.!?!??!?!..!?!??!??!?!??!?!!?!??!?!??!?!??!?!?
I think they are kinda cool now.
Little things means a lot. :)
I love all the insects they also make great pets I have a colony of Dubia roaches they are  simple to care for you guys should get some :)
To be honest, I already liked bugs but now I like big bugs and I cannot lie
Flies and mosquitos have no purpose search it up
U know my teacher takes a week... he takes 3 min... with jokes.
girls will stop screaming every 10 min
i was expecting....what if all Mosquitoes died all of a sudden?.
every little creepy crawly is amazing plus I need those butterflies and fireflies
Make a video abt phone addiction........
Hey life noggin, can the ocean get struck by lightning and if so why do people/fish not get electrocuted while swimming?
Get rid of flies and mosquitos and im good! XD
Doesn't everyone know this?
All we need are bees
As long as they stay away from me I won't kill them 😐.
Humanity will finally have peace
What about the ugly insects...
I still don’t see the point of cockroaches, or fleas, or ticks, or...(insert shudder)...bedbugs.
Why are the fruit-flys alive??
What if dinosaurs still existed
If the sun doubled in Mass, (throwback) would mars or Jupiter's moons be in the new habitable zone?
What will happen if all roaches died
If the moon Dissapeared or Exploded
Why do we see stars not in the sky in your eyes
I love your videos
If you drained the entire ocean of its water, and only its water, how much salt would be left over?
Bugs r still so creepy even if they help us humans out 🕷😣
Wait what\n0:10\nYour human world...\nHnmmm
Don’t kill bees!!!!!

Can you make a video about what would happen if rhe sun got smaller?
Kill bug! (But not bee and butterfry)
Hey Blocko, I have a question. Why does music seem to play faster at night?
I'd say get rid of everything but ants and bees. The rest of insects are jerks.
What happens if humans vanished
I always liked bugs
All bugs=my new cousins
That a salamander
Gonta would go ballistic
Nuts
3:00 You spelt it 'incite'...

It would be an absolute, global catastrophe of Biblical proportions. The damage that would do to the biosphere would rival a supervolcano eruption. Removing any entire class of species would be destructive, but insects are the largest class of animals in the world. There can be as much as 30 MILLION of species of insects.
We need diseases, it mitigates overpopulation
Please make Why is the ocean salty?

One of the best written ones yet.\nAlthough, the Russian guy does sound remarkably like Jose Mourinho
how dare you leave Portugal out of this! :)
9GAG make me come here...
As an Englishman from the town of Hastings and with the 951st anniversary of the battle of 1066 looming, I think England needs to get back to what we've spent the best part of a 1000 years getting good at ... Pissing off the French!!!\n\nSo let's invade Calais, but only for a weekend booze cruise ...\nBecause, um yeah, apparently taking over other people's countries is a bad thing ...\nWoops, sorry! If only someone had told us that like a 1000 years ago - you know, the whole shit with Longshanks just nabbing Wales, Scotland and Ireland ... Yeah, sorry again!
That Dutch accent was definitely something!
When international relations gets too heated, send in the mammies!
who was your one in the orange vest with the joint meant to be?
Okay I binge watched your Videos the entire morning and now I have a crush on Arms. Thanks I guess 🙍🏻🙄
Who would ever deny Scott anything?
You guys just keep getting better and better. As if that was even possible!!! I'm so happy for and proud of you two!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I had reached the point in my life where I didn’t think Scott could get any hotter, but I was SORELY 👏🏼 MISTAKEN 👏🏼 and I’m living for it.
Omf this video is so damn good
OK BUT THIS VIDEO IS FIRE THE PRODUCTION IS FIRE THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS FIRE THE EDITING IS FIRE THE ACTING IS FIRE THIS SONG IS FIRE THE HARMONIES ARE FIRE AND I'M SO FUCKING PROUD OF THEM AHHHHHHHHHH
I love this video but what makes it special is that their eyes are so expressive.
But honestly IMO this is their best MV yet..like the production and imagery is so good and it's just pleasing to the eye
This was made so well and so visually appealing 10/10
Why there are ANY 👎🏻 idgi!! Song and video sooooooo good! And acting on point! This better keep rising in views! Deserving to hit over a mil! ❤️
I. CANT. STOP. REPLAYING.
I can't stop listening to this
Why does Mitch look like a pedophile (Its a joke!!)
Also I’m obsessed with the song. Damn, I can’t stop listening.
Scott reminds me of a vampire from The Lost Boys movie
unlike justin beibers new song, this song will NEVER get old.
2:04 When someone laughs at my girlfriends joke.
Legit. I started sobbing in the middle of class because of this video. T h a n k s.
this brought me back to life
I want to play this song till it leaks through my ears. Fun. :)
At 0:11 Mitch reminds me of Mario but in a good way
I just need to get one thing off my chest..........Mitch looks like a French factory worker from the 19th century
In next video they could both be canadian lumberjacks.
Love you guys and always have, BUT Mitch hunny! Yes the stach changes your face, but there are a lot of angles that makes it look 70’s trucker porn star. No shade rly, just trying to help.
I am affected, big time.
This reminds me of UK garage, love it
I love the song but his mustache makes me scared for life.
i actually hate Mitch's outfit and this video confuses me so much\nbut the songs lit and I still love them sooo
thought it was an ad in the begging
Mitch makes me think of Freddie mercury with that look
Scott NEVER make the faces you made in the video EVER again
fans: SCOMICHE HAS TO BE REAL \nI try but I can't deny....\nfans: COME ONNNNN
I'm a simple girl. I see a new video from superfruit. I click it and up vote it right away. And I wasn't disappointed! Awesome work guys
This video is INCREDIBLE!! Beautiful, haunting, and fits the song perfectly - obsessed to say the least <3\n\nxxxxxxx
The beat is INSANE!!!!!! Love this sooooo much!!! Keep going!!! #bestwishes from Germany!!!!
SCOMICHE NEEDS TO LIKE HAPPEN AND THIS PROOF!!!
this is my favorite song and video so far, my weekly obssesion, the light and the camera movement is on point, I would give a million likes to this video if I could
Ahhhighhht! Loved Imaginary Parties, LOVED Sexy Ladies, Super Loved Heartthrob - admittedly mostly 'cause I couldn't get enough of vid. for that one - but this, *this* song has a no $ girl buying the album.
I still ship them so much and this is EVERYTHING also i relate so much to this
I can't stop listening and watching this video,,, everything about it is so well done and made
I swear YouTube is unsubscribing me from everyone what alSO THIS IS AMAZING
Never knew Joel McHale was a super fruit
221,219 views. I'm responsible for 200,000 views 🍓
mitch babe you look like that one green car from Cars that everyone hates
So this ended up being the first video that came out since my birthday AND THIS ISNT EVEN LIKE ABLE I CANT NO.
I need superfruit funkopops in my life, someone make this happen :')
I'm getting so many future bass vibes from this, but it's also not?? and I love the soft synths so much, they're lovely. ugh this song is great
Mitch SANG this though!!! love it!
Mitch: I just can't deny you\nMe: OKAY SI DOES THIS MEAN SCOMICHE IS REAL?  DONT DENY IT
Favorite song on the album
I don't even ship Scömìche that hard but I after seeing all the MVs lead up to this... I swear to Beyoncé y'all better be making out in the next release.
My gay fangirl heart.... can I just mention how Mitch /doesn't/ have 20 different fabulous outfits (each more colorful and fashionable than the last) in this video. I'm shocked.
Still confused why Katy Perry is still more relevant than these guys...this is the most talent that has ever happened! Superfruit is GOLD.
OMG love it so much. Reminds me of the dangerous woman album!!!
EVERY VIDEO BREAKS MY HEART A LITTLE MORE GUYS 😍😍😍😍
This needs more views!
These two guys are so fucking amazing !!! Thanx Scott and Mitch your friendship is a gift for entertainment. Really hope you'll be rewarded for Future Friends album, you deserve it ! Hug from France
Fabulous.  You have a string of videos that should get much attention.  Especially since the Billboard... thing.   PLUS;  I am pleased that you found some funk in you ass.
all these videos have been beyond insane quality like holy shit whoever made these needs a fkin award theyre so amazing the fx are amaze
Thank you! Memorizing this on my trip🤣

♡♡♡
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
❤️ Scömiche
I've been a Superfruit fan for a pretty long time, and never fell down the scomiche void lmao, but the recent MVs are really doing a good job building a case against all that I believe in and now I'm confused?? Are they trying to say something or is this just fan service?!?
SONG CODEWORD FOR BIGGER WORSER MASSACRES OF AMERICANS \nTHIS SHIT PYSOP CANCER CONDUCTED \nBY ILLUMINAT FUCKS HAS GOTTEN OLD QUICK \nTIME T O  S P I L L THE  B L O O D OF THOSE WHO SPILL B L O O D\n#DUEtoRACISM #DUEtoNARCISSISM #DUEtoGREED #FUCKBIGGOTRY #FUCKSATANISM
God damn I have never been more attracted to Scott in my life. I know he's cute and all but they did an amazing job turning him into forbidden fruit. I feel like I'm hung up on Scott too now lol
Oh yeah how were people created then May GOD have mercy on your soul  And I'll praye that you come to GOD be for it is to late we are in the end time s GOD will  give you everlasting life in HIS KINGDOM  if you repent of your sins to HIM because JESUS willingly gave his life for our sins and I'm 21:-P
Loving Mitch's voice but I want Scott to sing more
Scott says like 2 words in this song lol
i love them, and LOVE this song, but is this video supposed to be a joke ?? im lost - they almost look serious but at the same time its so much that it must be fake
I love this song the most out of the album. But is it just me or is Mitch the only one you can hear in every song?
no hate to Mitch, but I feel like Scott doesn't have ANY solo lines in a single one of the songs off of part 1 or part 2
IM 18 AND LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!
Any new YouTubers want to subscribe to each other let me know I'm subscribing to all. If you subscribe to me as well. I hope you guys ENJOY MY PG ❤️❤️❤️
I don't like texture like tree bark and little holes it's perfectly normal hahahaha no its not
You should try to he Korean brand innisfree
BlackUp is always a no for me.
I have this foundation and it's amazing. My skin is dry and sensitive and I would recommend it without hesitation!
I’m not gonna say it cause I’m a Christian 😂
Omg, I'm right there with you on the tiny holes and textures! It literally freaks me out and makes my skin crawl!
My kind of video!
WOW I CAN'T STOP WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS! AMAZING DARLING KEEP IT UP!
I’m so happy that I found your channel. Love your reviews
Your face looks amazing! Really like this face combo!
the sort hair really suits you, you look beautiful
babe, zoeva 102 silk finish is brush for foundation, it gives really full coverage and blends out like beauy blender!!
Anyone know What song is playing at the beginning?
I love how well u edit your videos
3:43 min “I’m a Christian” WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THE SAME OMG
I love the Sephora brand foundation-- it's about the only thing that doesn't freak my skin out, so if you have sensitive skin/combination, it is WONDERFUL.
Patricia I would like to ask you something in regards my personal experience, maybe you have had the same experience. I was wondering if there's private message on her thanks x
I usually don't buy stuff just because a youtuber made a video about it, but yesterday i bought the dr jart mask and the sephora cream lip stain in 26 after seeing this video.
New sub.....I love your personality........
Hey Patricia please I would like to know how u wear your hair it's really nice please make a vlog on how to wear it..😘😘😘
I have the same phobia!!!! It’s horrible, I have the itches just looking at honeycomb or anything similar to that.
Pleeeeeease don’t promote black. Up it’s a very racist company to simplify their disturbing origin.
That lip is beyond amazing
I'm 22 and want to hear these rude jokes 😂
This is the best foundation on you
Lol it looks like semen on your face @3:38... I'm 29 :)
So glad my phones finally working so I can watch Patricia :)
I love your new hair style.... very nice.
I know exactly what you was going to say 😂🤣. I get you give, i get you.
I really enjoy shopping in Sephora, and I'm starting to use more of their own brand items
I'm 12 but SUPER dirty minded, I get what you mean
23 years in the house boo :*
Youuuu are golddddddddddddddd.  What color is that lip liner??
Patricia there's a three month old fyi ~
I saw someone else use that mask and I thought the same thing. 😂. It’s one reason I won’t be trying it.   I have a thing about certain textures or whatever.   I just cannot.
You look really different without makeup on. Not saying it's a bad thing as your pretty with or without makeup. It's just unusual how different you look. Your eyes especially.
Yassss so excited for the triple uploads!! Always need more Patricia in my life!!
Old enough to get the joke😩😂💕
You’re too much 😂😂😂 with your little mind 😂😂
21 but I know older things I love the 80s and 60s
Always beautiful whatever you wear, actually makes me want to start wearing make-up x
my fav brush is anastasia renaissance palette brush, it makes all that lines that you want, i never liked any palette brushes before that one
13
Beautiful~
I'm 17 so you can say everything you've got 😂
This hair!!! There's no way I'm not getting a wig like this ❤️
Wow. I thought I liked you before but you just won me over with the Edith Piaf, subscribed...
Omg Pat I have Trypophobia why did you zoom in I cringed 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love that Sephora foundation. I am a 57. It's a perfect shade on me!
Love the final look on your face
this look turned out great i love this look!
My sister and I have it... fear of holes in clusters...
Hey, I do hair and art videos ! I'm doing a FREE portrait drawing giveaway! All you have to do is subscribe to my  channel and send me a screenshot! I will follow you back too!
How come you don’t do like I spent $$ on tarte?
I bought that same Fresh Rose Toner JUST because it's pretty to look at. Can't tell u the last time I used it. It's sitting pretty on my shelf though lol
Wow your skin looks great... I need this mask
Patricia!! Please tell us where you got the wig from cos you look good girl!!
Go ahead and say it.. I'm a Christian but this looks like jizz.. it's true.. that's the secret to the glow
Where is she from she has a beautiful accent
i am 13 i know what it looked like though
'I need to look RICH... in colour and in life' wauuuw. Ain't that the truth🤷🏾‍♀️
Great video! I love watching your kinda make-up /grwm video. You are beautiful
@patriciabright I’m so happy to be a subbie! Especially when you do the try ons with the clothes! Girl you make my day! I get a laugh with the facial expressions you do with the likes and dislikes... before I shop at Sephora I checked this video out! Thanks, Your subbie!

Loved this!! Annnnd Colette's pants are super cute :) \n\nXOXOXO
This was so great and I definitely got a little teary eyed.
Loved this Carlie!! If me four years ago had any idea how happy me now is, she wouldn't have even sweated that stuff before!! When you're in the thick of it, people always say, this won't last forever, you'll get through it, blah blah blah. But you're always like, nope, not for me. I will be miserable forever. But little do you know that things DO change and they DO get better. Usually it takes time. But it happens. But gosh, back then I was sure I'd be that way forever. Hindsight!! 💜
that is very helpful ladies. thank you
Thank you Carlie that was so helpful to me💗
Awesome! I'm sorry you felt like you had to distance yourself from this beautiful practice and downplay it as hippie dippy it's ok to go for it and own it. 💖
I love this!!!! I am going to use this for sure in my own life. Thank you for sharing
This is wonderful....  Thank you for sharing this :)
After my mom passed I realized how much I leaned on her in hard times. I had the hardest time of my life after that and I couldn't lean on her.  I found the quote she needed a hero, so she became one and it really woke me up.  ♡
I love that Carlie! I’m glad that you guys are spreading positivity and self love. We need more of this around he world.
As soon as Carly said introduce yourself to yourself I started to cry. I needed this so much. Thank you 💓
Thanks, Carlie. That is very helpful. 😊
Collette don't be guarded let karlie love you
Can you guys do challenges again I miss them
Great video
Collette are the shaytards making  videos  again????
This is an awesome thing to do! I kinda got teary eyed lol
So glad you ladies are all back! You guys really life this mamas spirits!! ❤️
You guys are amazing , this is helping me so much. Thank you ❤️❤️
I love this exercise and I've done it before, it really works! Although I would've loved to see you go into more dept with this exercise. Like who did Colette and Kayli see in front of them in the bad and good times? More examples would make this so much better! We love to hear about YOUR struggles that you've overcome. Please keep this in mind for the next segment. 😘
So sweet
Don’t understand why carlie not verified or hasn’t more credit becuase I honestly think she amazing inside and out she has the best personality and is an all around nice person
wow i did it with you guys and it was hard looking at me at my worst it almost bought me to tear and then seeing my good embrace it felt so relieving thank you guys for showing me that i can get through the worst by just thinking about all the good that my life will bring.
That made me cry 😢
Are you guys going to volg again
Carlie, this was such a lovely exercise; I thought maybe I'd feel too weird doing it but I decided to follow along and actually found it helpful. Love where the momsview is going! I'm going to keep this exercise in mind
Wow... I needed that! <3
This video was really good. I enjoyed the exercise very much.
I need so help my husband decided to walk away after 21 yrs of marriage  I feel lost
I really want to see all the kids and see how much they have grown
Love you guys!\nNot a huge fan of the extra camera angles... but love ya anyway!!
I would really like to see a video about infertility and its struggles from you guys and maybe an expert and someone who has struggled or is struggling with that. I think it’s a subject that’s not talked about frequently and something that affects a lot of women and couples. Love you girls!
I really enjoyed doing this :) felt a bit silly but think it worked to remind me of how far I’ve come in my life
I couldn't do it. yet. But I feel like my friends would love this, sounds so amazing
I think a GREAT show idea would be top self help books yall have liked, or a book club type thing.
Real moms have dirty windows. 😉 Good to see it's not just me. 👍🏻
These type of things don't do anything for me.
It looks like collete is crying
Totally teared up while doing this. Thank u for reminding us to love ourselves through the good and the bad. Loving this new moms view!!!!
I love how genuine The Mom's View is!
That was beautiful! Thank you!!
dont like carlies self help on her channel either.i am a hippy and fake hippy isnt helpful
That’s bullshit she got cheated and she acting like he didn’t do anything wrong
That made me cry, imagining myself at my weakest and giving that person a hug. Thank you Carlie!
Mommytard is so sad at the end :( stay strong and think about yourself first cause nobody will no matter who you are.
How great. I love that. Thanks so much for sharing. \nSince I don't have any kids of my own yet, I wanted to know if any of you guys had fertility issues leading up to any of your pregnancies or even if you know people who have or do.\nI have been struggling with infertility for the last 3 years and I'm trying to trust in God. I'm having a really hard time knowing what my next step should be and if having kids is really what God wants for me. I am LDS and there is definitely some expectations I know that there is only so much I can control but this is something that is really really difficult for me to not feel shame and guilt about. I'm 29 and been married for 9 years for the first 6 years of my marriage we used contraceptive. I think, Did I screw this up? Is it my fault my body isn't working? Did I miss my window for having children? and all the time everyone is asking me when I'm going to have a baby. It was easier to tell people that we were waiting than it is now to say we are trying and failing. Any insight or even just words of advice you can give would be much appreciated. Thanks!
I love you guys, I really needed this. thank you.
Dear ladies, still so happy you are back. \nI would be interested for you to talk about cancer and breast cancer. Last year my mom has gone through her second round of breast cancer, the first was 10 years ago. It was a tough time and I learned so much about cancer and about myself. I feel like my mom, though right now she is struggling with depression, is growing stronger and learning so much about herself and her own strength because of the disease. What is hard about it for her right now and for me during the last year is accepting that you sometimes are weak and that you are not always at your best and you are still you and you are still a genuinely perfect person just the way you are. My thoughts, I would love to hear yours. \nBest wishes from Germany! \nOh PS I'll be in Santa Barbara, California and in south Utah the next couple month. If you do any kind of meet up I am dieing to meet you. You gave me so much strength, knowledge and are a big role model for me! Love you
Dark hard times make the amazing times even better :) life is about learning, sometimes we learn things we don’t want to but it’s worth it in the end.
One day I want to be this carefree
I absolutely needed this today because sometimes it's hard to remember that we won't always be at our worst... I love you ladies and thank you for having these chats with us. I feel like you three are the sisters i always longed for. \n\nAlso a Friday show that would be amazing: How to not lose yourself when becoming a parent/wife?
so glad this is back 😭💗
Welp. If Susan watches it then it must go to the trending page!
Cathal love ❤ all girls Cathal like you girl \nI a am little sissy girl mistress
I'd love if there was a self-help video like this every week :)
Omg I literally cried I needed that thank u
I really liked the exercise Carly!
Ugh this is why I love you guys. ❤️
As I did the exercise with you girls I was so taken back by how differently I viewed my best self and worst self. How they almost seemed like completely different people. Thank you for this and for helping me reconcile my worst and best self. Self love is something I am working on too!
That was.... unexpectedly emotional! Jeez! From an overweight, suicidal college freshman to a happy wife, mom and fit triathlete. I've come a long way, and sometimes it's hard to recognize that through all the daily details!
I loved this exercise. It made me so incredibly emotional because I know my younger self would be so proud of who I am today. Made me want to go back and hug the little girl that thought things would never get better and just hold her and tell her it's all gonna be okay.
This exercise was interesting.  Because as I am  urrently at my lowest in self esteem right now. It felt good to hug my old fun self and have my fun self hug my new sad self. It's weird to say, but it made me feel like I was being a friend to my new self as well as my new self felt relief for having a friend to hug and admire.
Thank you Carlie! This is a life saver! You're the best!
In love with Carlie's top! 😍
Oh mom's view gals, I needed this more than you know right now.
Wow, it's been a year since I was at my worst. Suicidal, unmotivated, etc. I'm doing so much better now. People keep telling me that I look different, beautiful, and happier without even knowing my situation. Improved mental health shows on the outside too, I guess! What a great exercise!
Carle I did it with you and it was great. Thank you
Does anybody know the name of this exercise or who created it? cheers :)
Thank you this helped a lot! high school is such a struggle for me competition in seat placement in music , being a clumsy/awkward lab partner, mediocre grades, parents saying I'm a failure and other insecurities I have. I feel like if I pay attention to the good times all the bad times will gradually vanish away and I will become the person I see myself as in the future :) at one point last year I was considering suicide because of all the academic and social obstacles I've been going through. I hope I inspired someone today and that the bad times are what make us a better person today :)
Hey an idea for next Friday could be to update us on all of your kids and maybe bring some guest stars (the kids)
I'm not sure this would work for me. I can't imagine meeting myself during the darkest time, because I'm currently in the darkest time right now
Thank you!  This was so great!  I'm leading a bible study for women called Broken, and Im going to share this video as one of the exercises we do during our time together.
Dont mind me being immature but this remind me a TON of Joy & Sadness from Inside Out! 😍😍😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm going to try this. After Vegas incident, I dont feel like a good role model for my kidsk as i come undone. If I can stop and say the chances are small and find the best me that knows through prayer and what I've learned I can pull myself together. I'll try anything. :(
Nice exercise thanks for sharing! Sweet lady's.....💞😊
Carlie I'm obsessed with your shirt!!! Where did you get it?
Love this exercise! Thanks for sharing! What an awesome perspective!
This is beautiful!!!! Thank you!!!!!
I loved that exercise!
*when are the shaytards going to post again*
I love this
Really really loved this video
OK. only 5 seconds eyes closed aaaand hello tears! lol thank you Carlie It was an awesome exercice.
Should have Shaycarl as a guest. Seeing how he is a selflove specialist. Only give him a twitter account and some lube.
Thank you so much for this exercise. I haven't been feeling like my authentic self lately, and this has just made me step back and reminded me I'm a strong individual.
Thank you! Yes, the exercise was  helpful, I got teary eye.
I love Carlie's top where is it from ????
Carlie! You have no idea what that did for me. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart .
That helped a lot thanks guys 😊 I looked at myself two years ago when I was self harming and hateting myself. Then I put the person who I am today with her. Today I am happy loved and pregnant with a baby boy. I had them hug each other and the one who was self harming  was so happy to see the me today and was happy to see me/herself pregnant.  God had a plan for me and today I finally realized what it was supposed to be.  Thanks again ☺❤
That was wonderful. The exercise; Carlie's explanations and advice were so on point and just so good. I will remember this, use it, and share it. Thank you.
Can you guys pleaseeeee do a nother challenge
I like moms
I cried. I seriously cried. I loved this exercise
Love you all ❤️💛💚💙💜
so love you guys!!
Definitely got teary eyed through that <3 thanks mums!
Selp helf
I would love to see more girly stuff, girl chats, makeovers, makeup, hair, clothes talk and more. You should go on a girls trip and just relax, do some shopping, get massage, manicures etc
Ahh I love this very helpful. It was super weird to think about those 2 people because those are very different for me at least. Love this and love you lovely ladies ❤️
Has Carlie had plastic surgery or something because her skin looks so tight!
social media doesn’t help with this in modern times. we need to understand a lot of thoughts aren’t put into words, and everyone has felt negative emotions. you are not alone.
Am I the only one here that actually prefers to be alone for an extended period of time?
I feel lonely and odd because I'm lonely and odd.
Because Jesus isn't in their heart without him you'll feel empty. Triggered comments put below👇👇👊
Its why I think I'm alien to my own species. Most times I just feel like everyone is out for themselves and only need you when they want something.
I don't know if this is a great idea or not. Sometimes I wonder if I throw my weight around online too much simply by offering suggestions (for content). Or, maybe I think I am more powerful than I actually am (because of my brilliant suggestions). It seems like, if not School of Life, then another place should do an episode on social statistics, and what they actually mean. I'm autistic, and I've read that autistic people usually end up trapped in working class-like situations, regardless of where we start. I look at that and think rather than I'm going to beat these statistics, I think Ahhh, I'm doomed! There's no way out! The good psychologist or sociologist asks why, and what causes a statistic to be. The good epistemologist asks a) Does knowing a statistic like this count as self-knowledge and b) Is it better to know this, or is it better not to know? It's The Meno Problem right?
These days i feel less lonely when i am around books , dogs and nature .Being in a group of people makes be extremely lonely ..i really dont like the shallow talks , selfies ,snapchat and gossiping about others .i especially vowed never to go to a dinner with somebody who uses phone all the time .
Just moved into uni and was putting myself down because I'm not as good at socializing as my flatmates, but then I thought how far I've come, making friends with course mates and having long conversations with new people because a few years back I never would have been able to do that :') I feel a tad lonely, but I guess everyone else does at this stage as well
ever since I was a kid ppl thought I was a weirdo so I embrace that shit, makes life easier and much more fun when I can do whatever the fuck I want and ppl are like oh well that's just dynp being dynp also you're not fukkin alone. I'm a juggalo and I know there are a shit ton of weirdos out there JUST LIKE ME who like the same shit I do and don't give a fuck. whoop whoop!
This animation art is wonderful !!! I am amazed !!!
I love seeing depressed people self loathe like total retards. I kinda pity them. Just to feel bad for themselves. It's edgy, retarded, and doesn't help depression.
Maybe you think you know yourself but your mama thinks she knows better but your psychiatrist says you're both wrong then the priest says nah you're all clueless...none knows the 100% truth so there is no such thing as you...or they ..just an idea
I like the love illustration. Who did it?
For me it doesn't help that my parents have told me when I overreact or don't react normal/properly to simple things such as when I feel annoyance or sadness or hate. I once became so upset with a person because they tricked the teachers, lied multiple times a day, and yet they were proud of this and others did not seem to think badly of them. My parents tried to come up with excuses for why this person might do those things but she herself had said she was lazy and had the time to do them on multiple occasions. I broke down into tears because I felt doubted by my family, angry at the girl, wrong and bad for feeling this way, and an extreme hatred that stemmed from my feelings toward myself and her. I can also suddenly hate a person I'm supposed to love for no reason I know of and I have an overwhelming urge to kill any living thing almost every day. My parents have also repeatedly told me that I was using the wrong tone of voice (I would sound annoyed or upset when I wasn't), I was blaming others (I would explain something and mention another person when I was only trying to say how something happened not that it was their fault), and that I am glaring at them (I will try not to cry or just be staring at them).
School of life should do a literature video on Anthony Burgess/ F Scott Fitzgerald/ or like John Wyndham or HG Wells they've all got a form of literature with meaning
I just want to thank you for all the videos you do and the hardwork you put in them. I really enjoy them. Also, the essays you write , i read them when i wake up for school and they always get me thinking. Keep up the good work 💛
Plain and Simple, Start a relationship with Lord Jesus Christ and let him fill your heart, Never let your flesh control you which are focused more on the world which is the pride and lust and sex, drugs and alcohol, Etc.\n\nMoney and possessions and lust won't fill your heart and you will never experience life and peace and joy and everlasting life unless you come to repentance and get to learn of Lord Jesus Christ and let him enter your heart and when that does happen, What a great blessing it is Amen, Not even wicked people and satan and his demons can't do anything about it because God of Israel is mighty and strong and in control, Never doubt the Father from the heavens and know that he is for you and not against you.\n\nThis society, lifestyle, This system in countries and schools and teachings and knowledge and possession and money and religions around the world isn't from God, Their from man, Man made, True Relationship with Lord Jesus Christ is where the truth is at, You only have to be willing to run into the Father's mighty arms and let him embrace you and let him change your heart brand new through the blood of Lord Jesus Christ, Spiritually amen.\n\nIf you take Jesus out of your region you won't be safe, You take his commandments down and don't even keep it, Your in danger, you continue to mixture yourself with demons that only want to bring you down with them in the Lake of fire and be destroyed, You are in grave danger that only in Jesus name is able to break and destroy the devil strong holds and evil curses as well, Nothing is too hard for the Lord, They all tremble before God because He is mighty and strong and soon destroy them, And how terrifying it will be if you made that choice to join along foolishly in their greater damnation, Jesus brings True liberty and salvation and sweet victory, America, and all these things won't give you anything, Your life is only rough and hard because you choose not to listen to the Father calling, He is able to bring you up and you will supplied and will be blessed, As long as you keep following Jesus and not yourself and this world Amen.\n\nYou people laugh and smirk and think evilly before God, you people, don't you know that God has not forgotten what you did wrong? your not safe and will never be, But God is being very patient and merciful for you because he loves you unconditionallay, Get away from wickedness you people, No matter what color or race, You are made in the image of God physically and spiritually, You cannot escape from God's mighty judgment, he will judge the righteous and the wicked, The righteous will have life but the wicked will perish, Turn to the  Father you people no matter how your situation is, Come to him if not then God will be far from you and you will cry and none will hear, You will call for help but none will help, You people how long will you anger God? he loves you just get up and be serious about your life, CALL UPON JESUS NAME and let him deliver you and draw near to God and he will draw near to you and you will be reborn again and then will your cry and it will be heard from the Father, he will deliver you and when call upon him for his help and he will deliver you and help you, when you are in pain and trouble, Child don't let sorrow break you, The Father loves you for all things have a purpose and he will take vengeance for you, You see these sad people child, don't be bitter and do not let hate overtake you and never let go of love, Lust ain't love throw that away, Lift up True Love inside your heart Child and that's Lord Jesus Christ, look to the Father and let him help you, In the end, your painful experience is a blessing and it will shine bright, All souls belong to Jesus, never doubt the father, You people how long will you choose to follow evil and not Good? Don't waste your life and your purpose God has created you for, don't waste yourself for folly things that are pointless if it won't encourage you and bring you closer to Jesus and bring your faith to shine more, it is not worth it, Following Jesus is amen, He will comfort you and wipe your tears and remind you of his unfailing love for you, For He is your true father from above in the heavens amen, He is a Father to the fatherless, don't mess with them because if God hears their precious cries and tears then you will be destroyed, God is a judge for the widows, Don't mess with them because God will judge you and you'll be in great trouble, God is an Awesome and Fair God, God of Israel Amen.\n\nIf there's no love which is Jesus, Then people will error greatly and follow their own way and it may seem good outside and they may try to use history to back up their foolish imaginations, but inside them, it isn't the truth, neither is it good, And Good works will never be enough to enter into the Kingdom of God only through Lord Jesus Christ, who paid our debt and did it for us, You only have to believe and have Faith, not belief and your feelings those are entirely different from Faith and believing, having a relationship with Lord Jesus Christ who is God is the Good news and the Truth Amen.\n\nThere are sad people on this world that rather reject God and go after the world which is pointless and no hope for them unless they be willing to turn to the Father, Jesus can change a wicked sinner into a beautiful, clean saint, And how beautiful it is indeed, You won't learn from anything from this video neither anything else but from God's words alone, The Holy Bible King James Bible Amen, You have to take everything from God's words literally and ask for Jesus for Guidance and help in his words and you will see, You will understand that others will not because everyone is different and unique, Just like the stars God created for example, Each having names and each being very unique and beautiful, But for you, You are much more to God then the Stars, God of Israel Loves You Unconditionallay and you will always be important to God but if you continue to live in sin, Don't do it, Go any deeper and there will be no hope for you and there will be no way for you to come to repentance, But it is never too late right now while there is still time, Jesus is able to restore the soul and deliver everyone from falling, You only need to look deep into God's words and learn from him Amen.\n\nWhat will you do? Get up and get away from being comfortable to this world, Living for Jesus Christ is worth it Amen, There are greater things ahead that this world will never understand but only in Jesus alone, God knows your heart and there's no hiding anything from him, You can hide in a cave but that still won't hide yourself from him, It's a very very very terrible, Dreadful and terrifying experience to be standing against a Strong and Powerful Living God who created you and form you with a purpose, But how a great blessing and beautiful it is to stand with our True Father God who is Mighty and Strong, God can do the impossible and never doubt him, He's GOD OF THE LIVING! GOD OF ISRAEL AMEN.
I needed this right now, thanks for helping me feel better :)
Because you hang out in front of your computer all day!
I think you're wrong with this one, School of Life. Sometimes you just have to cope with realizing that you're odd. Sometimes trying to connect with people on a deeper level is great for realizing that their insides are different from what they portray externally, but it's also great for realizing that who they are internally is still very different from who you are internally. Sometimes you really are just odd and you have to embrace that.
Feedback: been subscribed for about two years now. I wish you guys would make more videos that feature actors or even real world scenarios. Actually I also loved your videos about the great philosophers... if there aren't any of them left to do then what about other notable artists or famous people like, I dunno... JFK, Martin Luther King or Lady Gaga.
art? not so sure abut that. especially with it being so subjective.
Loneliness is that feeling to be stranger; the fact is that we're all strangers to each other. We live between two worlds; the inside and the outside, if you focus in the one of the inside, you'll fall in anxiety, depression and anguish and if you just focus in one of the outside you'll lose your confidence in yourself and you fall in the same illness. The other is a book, be courageous and go to the library and chose a book. Open it and start reading. We're all strangers.
This is, as often, an excellent synopsis, but I wish it would elaborate on the point that deals with the expression of internal feelings in art and love a bit more in depth instead of cutting it short at this quite important intersection. I feel like it's all a dilemma - We eithe repress our feelings like everyone else, or we choose to display them more openly at the risk of becoming vulnerable in the presence of the people we thereby choose to trust. As an artist, I've also run into a third phenomenon - where I've personally become a screen for others to project their own feelings onto because they started to view me as deep and special because of the work I do while not at all making a connection to their own innermost stuffings. This inevitably resulted in repeated cases of very tiring groupiedom. I do feel producing artworks makes for exchange and connection with other artists, though, which is a wonderful byproduct of making art and, measured by the concept presented in this video, this would be the successful scenario of solving the asymmetry. Yet --- Is this one of those problems where you end up dissatisfied whichever option you choose? Because I don't feel like being an artist has helped me with feeling lonely and odd. Like, at all. Neither has love.
Such as amazing Channel. They  never teach this in school. And if so , it feels to technical (Lack of feeling and association. Like robots). \n\nThis channel deserves more subs like 7 billion!
Please translate it to Arabic
1. There is an excellent video by the legendary psychologist Erich Fromm on youtube, where he says:\n\nThe most normal are the sickest, and the sick ones are the most healthy\n\n( Die Normalsten sind die kränkesten und die Kranken sind die gesündesten. )\n\nWhat he means is that people who show absolutely no symptoms of suffering, anxiety, or confusion are the ones who are most in  trouble. Because they are probably supressing everything, being totally alienated from themselves. \n\nBut those who worry, suffer and feel  tormented most of the time are indeed the healthy ones because these symptoms show that they are still  connected to their inner selves.\n\n Well, isn't that good news??\n\n2. Now, just as a thought experiment, take the person who seems to you to be the most different, the most distant person from you. If you think long enough about  him / her, you surely will find a trace of every aspect of his personality within yourself too. \n\nThe very same fear or insecurity may turn one person into a wiseman and the other into a tyrant...That's why our personalities seem so different at first sight. But when we label those who don't seem like us as  abnormal indeed we shy away from the task of searching for the same disturbing character features within ourselves.\n\nI would also like to recommend a great movie called  Normal. ( With an amazing Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson ) There you will find a man who seems  abnormal to everybody in his life including his wife and children!  Poor guy, what a hell that must be... But in the end you will see how much you have in common with him. \n\nThat's why I love the movies and literature... They open you the doors to the inner lives of people whom you could never truly get to know, even if they were your neighbours, your partner or your best friend...A great book or movie has the capacity to show you every aspect of a human being. In real life you only see that what the other person allows you to see, plus what your intuition adds to it. \n\n( You can at least watch the trailer of the movie on youtube. Just search  for:  Normal - Trailer Jessica Lange, Tom Wilkinson. The acting is really incredible!! )\n\n3.  The good thing about none of us  being normal, is that when just ONE person dares to open up, be vulberable and be himself, then it helps all the people around him to liberate themselves too. There is a really wonderful example of this on a RADIOLAB podcast called  The New Normal. It is the story of Stu Rasmusen, the first trangender mayor in the US. He managed to be the mayor of a very conservative small town and change everybody's perspective about what it means to be normal! \n\n\n4. And here is a remedy for all shy friends: \n\nYou can read Ryszard Kapuscinski's wonderful book  The Other . That can really  be a life changing experience for you. Because: what can help overcoming shyness more than realising that there is NO other?\nWe sometimes exaggerate our differences in order to  confirm our identity and feel ourselves more special. But we must indeed do the opposite: we must always deliberately look for what we have in common. It would be helpful to have these simple lines always in mind:\n\n You are human beings nonetheless.\n As far as one can see\n Of the same species as myself \n\n( Pozzo, in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot )\n\nThanks a lot for this very consoling lesson and for the truly wonderful animation!
I feel lonely because I lost all my friends when they left to different colleges.
This explains why I'm honest and blunt with my character.\nMy character helps people be more comfortable being themselves around me.
This video gives points that are completely subjective. How does this shit get on trending? Who did you pay?
I deeply and truly appreciate these videos and this narrator's work.
Can you do a Literature episode about Balzac?
I don't agree with this silly generational we are all ultimately the same, share the same experiences, the same thoughts and feelings. I talk to people lots and meet very few who have same or similar thoughts, feeling and experiences as me.
worship 1 GOD, \nVerily only with the remembrance of god do hearts find peace-Quran
ive learned i enjoy life a hell of a lot more on my own.  im happy being lonely!!
What a coincidence. I just watched a video from SciShow Psych on a very similar feeling. They called it imposter syndrome. It's a feeling of inadequacy in successful people and thinking their success was only based on luck and that other people deserve more admiration than they do. I think you mentioned it at one point in the video.
Birth we come alone. Death we leave alone.
I AM NOT LONELY! I FEEL SO ATTACKED BY THIS
Another pretentious video. We feel odd because life is fucking strange it's that simple.
Because we have no God.
I will have to rewatch that several times to really get the idea behind this animation. For now I can tell, these are some beautiful illustrations!
I feel like you guys are rehashing your old stuff
no because of society
because we are odd and alone
This is so accurately and beautifully expressed
Hello friends, have a great day, love you
This is why reading introspective literature is so important! This is reading Kafka, ladies and gentleman! Then you can easily imagine what others in you life are going through and how they are in the inside, which is very much like yourself, which is very comforting.
Really? But I use mINS reading and individualism. I simply don't care what people think and expose my true self as much as possible.
the sketch was kinda depressing :/
man, I don't know how you choose your topics, but please keep up what you're doing.\none of the best channels on youtube.
I have spent 5 years listening to the inner reality of women's lives. http://www.collectingconversations.com Our stories may differ but we are very similar.
Truly beautiful animations! I loved when the lead character turned off the light to reveal everyone else’s deep, neon mysteries.
Life every day is happy or sad thats your life you should choose to take one of this in your life be successful and dont forget me
Is it ok to think that we should act fake so we don't put others down or bore them? I feel like we are our own individuals and that we can choose how we want to feel, but a lot of people do not think that way and expect others to entertain them or serve their interest the way they want.
I feel lonely because I decided to ditch my toxic friends and ex-partner. Now I'm too busy turning my life around studying uni via correspondence in the small rural town I live in to make friends with people I have nothing in common with. So for now, until I meet other people passionate about Science, I am lonely.
Moral of the video. Don’t care what people think because we all go through the same inner battle we try to fight
Well shit... looks like one of those solutions is hopeless for me... -_-
It's hard to make new friends when you have none because you forgot how.
Hi School of Life. Can you write an essay regarding gratification excesses found mostly on social media usage? And idenitfy newly adoptive practices of communication influenced by rapid tech advancements? Since you emphasize that well being is so important, I believe you ahould begin to study this behaviours.\nP.S Your videos always help me understand human weirdness. This is a positive thing, haha.
You have got a very limited set of topics for your videos. I feel like i've watched this one already five times. Also I wonder how lonley and odd you feel Alain de Botton, and weather talking about it over and over again helps you with it. Hearing about it over and over again sure doesn't help me a lot.
i’m so in love with this art
Reminds me of we judge others on their actions, and judge ourselves on our intentions
Uhhhhh I know I'm odd... I have sex with dogs... that's pretty disgusting in everyone else's view points... but I find that eating animals out of enjoyment is disgusting... I could never eat pork or pig... I do eat chicken but I always feel sad and guilty while eating it for needed nourishment to help my skin disease.. :(
This describes me too  well
YES! I relate so much! Thanks SOL!!
I tend to not talk about some stuff like anime and video games (two things that are a big part of my life) with people I don't really know well just because there can be a negative connotation that comes with people who like that sort of thing. I've never been bullied or criticized for liking that stuff, in fact, all of my close friends are into at least one of those things. I'm just afraid of people thinking the wrong thing about me I guess.
Just told somebody how I'm still struggling with feeling lonely where I live and this video awaits me in my sub box. Impeccable timing once again.
That was some trumpy handshake right there...
So the person with a Macbook that's got Harry Potter stickers on it who's wearing a Normal People Scare Me shirt and whose hobbies are Netflix, food, and sleep is secretly quirky and different in the inside? I doubt it. People vary in terms of their tolerance/appreciation for strangeness.
You've got to love psychology. It opens a window to the things we can't understand about ourselves and it also let's us in on the minds of people around us. \n...Very enlightening.
*Is life repetitive?*\n\n\nIs life a pattern?\n\nPattern of lies no matter how you try to prove it’s not..?\n\nPatterns of *”types”* of people? Feelings? Thoughts? Expressions?\n\n\nAlways expected to be a “good” person? Someone *”special?” Or “unique?”*\n\nAlways expected to be “different” *simultaneously?*\n\n*Why?* \n\nsame thing, passed to another.

Dear School of Life,\nPlease stop stalking your subscribers, you are always uploading videos exactly when we need it to the point where it gets a little eery.
I'm lonely cuz most people are retards.
1:05 When will tSoL stop the sex obsession?? That is literally pornography!!
Jesus knows you completely and loves you unconditionally. Have a moment with Him and ask Him to live in your heart.
To be fair,  people you know could also know you better than yourself.

I lauv how lauvly Lauv is.\n\n\nSorry
i will be so happy if they got so much more view and more recognized but low-key dont like it too if they get too mainstream.
Love the guitar solo and drop @ 02:57
Lauv's songs actually mean something to me, that is why I love them so much!!!!😍😜
Loved it! I love you're songs and you're pretty awesome voice!
How's your dad? Doctor Leff? HE TEACHES ME CHEMISTRY AT SCHOOL :D
Tf how relatable is this song !!!!!!
Lauv got some amazing songs and talent but whack moves haha. Keep the grind up
You got a way of making me feel insane\n\nLike I can't trust my own brain\n\nUnless it's screaming your name\n\nI'd have it no other way\n\nI'd have it no other way\n\nAnd maybe that's why I stay\n\nHow many times can we pick up the same fight?\n\nCan we keep screaming all night\n\nAnd make up until it's light?\n\nThat's when I say that you're right\n\nAnd feel your body on mine\n\nOh, maybe that's why I stay\n\n \n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\n\nI could be with someone, making me happy\n\nBut that would be too easy love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nI could put my phone down\n\nJust pick up my keys\n\nI could let you go and we could let it be\n\nBut that would be too easy love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\n \n\nKeep coming back\n\nGuess you can say I'm attached\n\nLast time we called it a wrap\n\nI came begging and all that\n\nYou're like a habit, it's bad\n\nI gotta have it, it's bad\n\nOh no, I'm not even mad, no\n\n \n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\n\nI could be with someone, making me happy\n\nBut that would be too easy love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nI could put my phone down\n\nJust pick up my keys\n\nI could let you go and we could let it be\n\nBut that would be too easy, love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\n \n\nIt's the way you keep me up all night\n\nIt's the way you make me lose my mind\n\nEvery time I'm saying one more night\n\nIt's the way you know I'm yours\n\nIt's the way you know I'm yours for life\n\n \n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\n\nI could be with someone, making me happy\n\nBut that would be too easy love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nI could put my phone down\n\nJust pick up my keys\n\nI could let you go and we could let it be\n\nBut that would be too easy, love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love

the vibes on this tho😭❤️
Where he says I could be with someone making me happy, I though he said I could be with someone making me a beat. I can't hear. Its terrible. And yes I'm being serious. So don't verbally attack me. I did not mean the song was terrible. I love it. Had to clarify that.
I Like Me Better\nA Different Way\nEasy Love\nPerfect 👌
So smooth when that electric guitar kicks in
listen to it in 0.75 speed
Waiting for you here in PH :)
No one is probably going to read this,\nBut i don't mind writing it because I feel at least one person will read it.\n\nI'm an artist pursuing my dreams & pray that my dream will someday be a reality. I have my latest video up on my channel & would love the support from anyone. \n\nEither leaving a like on this comment, liking one of my videos or subbing to my channel would mean a lot to me. \n\nJust some simple views & subs can get me closer to living my dreams. Thank you:)

I CLICKED SO  *FAST*
Omg Hannah I've commented this before and I am honestly sorry for repeating myself, but if you like your romantic comedy tropes deconstructed, then give Crazy Ex Girlfriend another go!!!  I swear every other favourites video you give me another reason to be sure that it's basically made for you. But, you know, no pressure. :)
I work in technical theatre and I had the opportunity to shadow the touring stage manager for Wicked one year. Best experience of my life, that show is amazing!! \nI’ve never had a chance to experience an Immersion theatre show, but I get so excited every time I hear about one. I’m so glad you shared!!
not loving the higher fps used for talking vlogs, theres so little visual information needed in these videos that they always have the feeling of being fast forwarded (esp with hannah's naturally fast paced delivery)\n\ngreat favorites video otherwise!
Can you film a video where you show all the books on your bookshelf and mention a few of your faves and why. You have so many books I really want to hear some good recommendations.
You hair looks longer because it probably is - they often do that when you have a side part. :-P
i adore EE jewellery!! so jealous they sent you all their beautiful stuff
I LOVE The Virgin Suicides movie. Would you say the book is worth it? I'm not sure if I should read it.
I love the Eclectic Eccentricity jewellery, so pretty. Last month I read quite a few books, but at the moment I'm reading The Sun and Her Flowers which is beautiful. Also I've been loving the articles on the sex and relationship site neutral.love - which I think you'd probably enjoy. :)
It'd be a shame if someone did a video with Boyinaband
Thanks for the recommendations, Hannah! \n\nI finally got around to seeing Jessica Jones ... great show! I also watched Mr. Robot, which was weird but good. I've mostly been enjoying my writing class in my spare time, though. :)
Can I just recommend that you watch a film called I am me it's heartbreakingly beautiful and British
some nice favourites you have there :)
I'm seeing wicked november 8th with my school chorus! How is it? :)
and i am here sitting and waiting for a fionas apple record. and she releases an album once every 7 years or so.
We did the same with House of Cards! We'd already watched it though, so we started the new series just after GOT finished *I had the void too...*I also love how you described it as GOT in the Whtie House as that's how i describe it to people! Along with Game of Thrones meets West Wing :P\n\n i also really recommend Designated Survivor, if you're looking for one AFTER House of Cards. Isn't Kevin Spacey AMAZING? One of the best actors and it only gets better!\n\nI'm also a huge Reese fan, ever since her Legally Blonde days - i just went to see the musical on friday night in Bristol and it reminded me how much i adore the film! It's also so lovely to see the jewellery brand on here as i discovered them on Not on The Highstreet a few years ago :) As ever, your videos never fail to bring a smile to my day! xxx
The star actor in The Big Sick is Kumail Nanjiani.
You came to Toronto and didn't say :(   Yeah, it's cool here, 'cept when the winters suck xD
Hannah your brows are on point girl
Wicked is good Hamilton is the best! Highly recommended
You have the best favourites videos
About a month ago I read the Manifesto on How to Be Interesting and loved it! It left me feeling personally affected. I didn't realise you knew Holly Bourne :) I'm happy now to have something to relate to!
thank you! ( your hair texture is first class, Hannah! you are looking Gorgeous, I like you very much, obviously!) thanks! good night! what's next? have a wonderful happy week ahead! thanks!
how come there's no motion blur in this video? my eyes feel warped
i read it only happens in the movies yesterday, it’s the first book i’ve read all the way through in about 3 years (i used to read all the time and went off it completely) it was so good, planning on reading the spinster club ones next
House of Cards is my favourite netflix series EVER! Wicked is also my favourite musical so i'm all over this favourites video :)
My September favourite was definitely meeting you and Lucy at Buffer Fest :)
You're jumper looks so cosy... where's it from?
Have you found your perfect man yet?
I love The virgin suicides :)
I loved Holly's book! and those jewellery pieces look beautiful! :)
Omg yes! Share that First Aid Kit love <3
Dear Hannah,\nI want to thank you for a lot of things but I think I'll tell you a story first, so here goes nothing: \nIt was 11:45 or something and we were sitting on the tables because it was breakfast break (we have that at my school). Everyone is really exited because Anderson asked Eva if she wanted to go to dance lessons for the 9th grade dance (we have that at our school too). There is a certain pressure in the room because              everyone is expecting other boys to ask other girls... who do I want to dance with me? I ask myself...without hesitating I already know: Andrew, with the ginger hair who sits behind me. Without thinking twice about it I ask him: are you going to dance lessons? No, I don't have anyone to go with and he turns around, almost in shame, because he can't  pluck up the courage to ask\nanyone. Do you want to dance with me? I ask and I see his face light up...I still don't know if in embarrassment or happiness. Yeah, I'd love to he says. Why? Don't you have a boyfriend? Because I like you...I  a friend way and he's not my boyfriend, he's my best friend plus he's too old for the dance, he'd have to be 4 years younger \n\nLater that day alot of my friends had been asked out to dance, but none of them had asked any boy. Who are you dancing with? They asked me. Andrew. oh, did he ask you? \nNo, I asked him *silence* \nThey didn't seem to get the idea that it was totally fine to ask a boy out! (Not even out, to dance lessons!!)\n\nBut sure enough the girls that weren't asked, asked the boys themselves the next day.\nHooray for empowering women! \n\nI'm telling you this because I think women like you Hannah, gave me the confidence to do my little act of rebellion against societies ideas. \n\nI probably git some stuff wrong and part of its cheesy but I hope I got out what I could. Thankyou Hannah:)
I went to see wicked the same night :) it was my second time and I'm still awed by it. I wish I could live somewhere nearer to London to be able to see more Musicals!
I was wondering why this video seemed hyperreal.  And it was in 1080p50.  That explains everything.
That Alice Underground theatre show sounds incredible! So sad I didn’t get a chance to take part!!
My boyfriend and I are watching House of Cards and we’ve just gotten into season 2 as well! Also, you’ve made me want to finally read The Virgin Suicides.
I once actually had to explain to a guy that the way men pursue women in movies is generally not a good idea in real life.  He thought that was actually how it's done.
haha I think those intros are so cute :P
Hey!\n\nI've just recently discovered your channel and i love it!\nthe  jewellery.... omg.. i want it. I hope i can find something similar here (i'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).. i looove galaxy and space stuff.\n\nI really love wicked! wish i could have seen it many times as well.\n\nYou could have an amazing intro that is like you.. but you do not need it! seriously!
Adore Wicked - I've seen it twice in London and I'm really tempted to see it again when the tour visits next year.  Will def be checking out Holly's new book!
That's me too! I feel like i need to get the souvenir programme everytime i watch a musical.... and then i don't actually know what to do with it....
I love your hair in this video! Cutie.
You're videos seem to begin after the beginning. Like YouTube delays your video just a bit, but I can't tell how much\n Stop it or stop them. I want to see all of you and I mean that in every good way.
Where is the jumper you're wearing from? I love it!
The Big Sick made me cry too. Kumail Nanjiani who wrote it with his wife and stars in it is really talented and funny. You should follow him on twitter.
Are you planning on seeing It? Or maybe you're not into the horror genre? I think it has a very beautiful cinematography and it was a very good movie, that's why I'm curious :)
oh my gooood I saw the big sick on it's release day it's one of my fav films it's so so so so good, glad you liked it too!!!
Yesss, first aid kit! The new single is amazing.
I love watching these vids because some of these things I’ve heard of and some I haven’t, if I haven’t, then they become my favourites. Lol, plus I just love hannah❤️🙏🏼
i NEED to see Wicked again! i saw it a couple of years back and it was honestly incredible, so much better than i expected! love your vids Hannah!
Tickets booked! A great 19th Birthday present to myself - I can't wait :D
So jelly! I've seen Wicked twice and it was my first theatre show that I saw live. I sat in the front row the first time and cried because of how excited I was. Needless to say, I love it. I would have loved to celebrate the 11th :)
I love Wicked so very much 💚
Was nice seeing you at Buffer Fest! :D
I think I will have ti buy Holly's book
You haven't seen IT
I know this is a weird video to comment on this but the quality of this vid is awesome! Like super HD
My friend read The Manifesto On How To Be Interesting by Holly, and then wrote a blog pretty much copying it? And I got so annoyed, like, I was all 'She's Hannah's friend you can't plagiarise her!'😂
Did you get a new camera? I can't really explain it, but you look more...real?
Is it just me or does the video look slightly sped up?
OMG House of Cards AND First Aid Kit being mentioned in the same video 😍😍😍 First Aid Kit are amazingggg live
I've been enjoying starting university. So far it's just been a blur of lectures, training, eating and sleeping
The Virgin Suicides is SUCH a great book. I read it in one sitting while sitting on a bench in  park, and it was the most beautiful day.
Pls don’t rip the page out of the programme, it makes me a little uncomfortable thinking about it 😩
i haven't watched the last season of house of cards just yet but holy fuck is that A Show™
Get one like the Drunk Advice intro!
I LOVE The Big Sick. One of the best pieces of film I've seen in awhile.
Oh the last 2 episodes of OITNB are in my opinion the best .. enjoy
FIRST AID KIT ♥︎
Omg southbank 😍😍
Good 🎥 film
Love this narcissist 💋💋🌷
Dannah
First Aid Kit, ahhhh ❤❤
Omg I loooove Holly Bourne
Show off TV
Your amazing hannah! Great vids
I LOVE WICKED
Omg yes love First Aid Kit!
Is the jumper Dodie yellow tho?
BYOI  it's audience participation Improv group,  renaissance  fairs,
You are gorgeous Hannah. :)
Hi
I. LOVE. WICKED.
Robin wright is my BAE!
why is it in a higher frame rate this time? It looks odd to me
The actos name from the big sick is Kumail Nanjiani and I highly recommend his stand up and maybe even more so his twitter. Seriously it's a treasure box! I love that guy. oh and while I'm at it, he's in the show silicon valley. Also amazing.
What time-ish will the event with Holly finish? Just wondering so I can book my train!
The idea of someone ripping out pages of a theatre Programme pains me. Lol
I love your rainbow book stacks
I'm seeing First Aid Kit next week for the first time! I'm so excited!
I'm a gardener, we call it the change. Thank you your up beat and happy perspective.
Holly was literally in my school today
Literally just found your account I’m 16 and wondering where I’ve been under what rock to not find you you’re amazing omg ❤️
HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU HAVE PER DAY TO READ AND WATCH ALL OF IT AND LIVE
Omg my friend played Alice in that play! What a small world 🙊
Genuinely interested- if I now comment that The Big Sick is not a Judd Apatow movie, but was directed by  Michael Showalter and writen by Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani (a.k.a. the leading actor and his wife), would that be considered a rude comment? I really want to know, because I am a big Kumail fan and am totally excited for the movie, and was just kind of sad to hear Hannah's mistake.
Aaah I had no idea Holly Bourne was releasing another book, I need to get it asap!
Hopefully you'll do more twitch stuff in the future! Been loving that when you were on :D\n\nAlso this video is great! Love getting recommendations for things from your monthly fav's videos!
I'm I the only one distressed by the disorganised bookshelf???  :P
YOU CAN BE MY FAVORITE SONG ...LOVE IT
They all looking like a meal made by Gordon Ramsay 😭😍😂

Austin really has a deep voice.
Edwin sings his verse*\nMe: wow I love poetry.

I pretty much love it 😸
zion and edwin's voice <3
If they say they can dance...atleast try to show it and not replace it with shitty dance moves.
Someone needs to leak the extended version 😩😫😭😭😓

How come Nick doesn't have a solo
You can tell who's the face of the group . ( The guy in the glasses) Tell me I'm wrong . Their  all cute af. even the one with glasses is hot af. They are better than 1D. Their sound is amazing, it's not too poopy.  The sound is a mixe of pop/R&B and a little it of hip hop.
Look Comparisons on the this video:\nBrandon= Brandon Urie\nEdwin= Cameron Boyce\nAustin= Kurt Cobain\nNick= Nick Lachey\nZion= The Weekend\nAny opinions?...
finally...a group that can freestyle God Blesssss <3

Michael can you please do a review of different setting sprays! I have oily skin and an make up setting sprays make it worse. Can you suggest any? Thanks hun x
I love your videos Michael but you didn’t disclose in this video that it was sponsored, only right at the bottom of the description. On FTCs website it clearly states that only disclosing in the description that a video is sponsored isn’t enough as it can clearly be missed. No hate as I love you but as a loyal follower I’d prefer it be clearly stated whether or not a video is sponsored ❤️
i feel like a lot of your catch phrases havent been said as regularly and it makes me that sad q not a problem bin
Thank u for not been afraid to say what products are shit.stay honest,much respect and love from UK xx
Pls do more of these hot and misses videos love u xxxxx
Your losing so much weight you should be so proud of yourself Ox

Would love to win your giveaway on Insta have always wanted to do my makeup but never had the money for it so your giveaway would help me get started p.s love your videos
Love your videos but the ginger girl has so over played her little hand joke ...

I LOVE THIS DO MORE!!!!!!!
That mask burned the shit out of my skin and left me looking sun burnt the rest of the day :(((
Loving this and loving you 👏🏽🌱💛✨
I noticed how YouTuber beauty gurus are super careful about what they say about tarte products because tarte is quick to snatch people off their PR list these days even if it's constructive criticism
I miss your old hair!
I love watching your vids, they put me in a good mood😻
You are looking amazing!
Thanks Michael for your honesty, I truly appreciate it. It saves me going out and buying a crappy product!
You’re makeup today is ridiculous 😍
He looks like Ursula from the little mermaid
Almost died laughing a the review of the Natasha palette ..... A lot of persons seem to be like they are walking on eggshells when doing a hit or miss....best of all time
You look fabulous! I love your honest opinions!!
The fact that you admit you got a product in PR & STILL state your honest opinion .. respect 🙌🏻 love you !
I just loves you! Xx

I love it when you do favourites videos I always value your opinions on beauty products 💖💖 love ya

Omg I so so love your makeup vidz your so amazing
That Mecca primer is an EXACT dupe for the Becca backlight primer... I compared the two today and the Mecca one had just a teeeensy bit more pink pigment to it. But they pretty much look, perform, smell the same except one costs nearly $80 and the other costs $20. Ps they both have 30mls of product
That makeup look with that hair.. yas mama!👏
Giving me Katy Perry but 100x better!!!
You legit look like Pink the singer with that hair I can't deal
That little “HMM” after the pro glow concealer 😂😂😂
Thank you I love your videos ❤️
Could you do a full face first impressions on sports girl makeup. I really like watching your first impressions love you ❤️❤️
Yaaas the Lancôme has been my fave for years! It's the best!

No sabia que la paty maldonado era youtuber
После этого ролика начал бояться синей зоны больше, чем смотреть фильмы ужасов!
the numbers of retarded videos made around pubg... i wonder if pubg pay them to make ads or if they are just trying to surf the hype wave. The game is full of bugs/cheaters and unbalanced shit its overhyped asfuck ( i got over 400hours on pubg, im talking from experience)
Never have died to red zone, never see whats the big deal
that guy's ak was still going off a second after u ran him over, must be desync
that dumb mf' still runs with his weapon out. what a pleb
Beats the corridor digital one
Man you really made the blue look terrifying...
...the thing that nags me is that they use a shotgun that's not in the game.
The daily adventures of a noob
give them money for a full-size movie
What kinda noob opens their parachute as soon as they jump out of the plane
U forgot to loot that guy with AR :p
Ok the start was pretty badass
It was be awesome if this was a series or at least movie
next, the last guy survive.
@0:30 Wait was that a banana man reference
Disappointed that he didnt steal the 300$ skirt and worn it.
how come half the people here speak japenese in the comments
This looks like it could be a fun full length battle royale movie. Make it happen! Go, go, go, Up on kickstarter ffs! :)
look this and like  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9RKGu63MVw
Скупи дороу!\nКсть видос топ
Wow!
Simply genius work!
Fucking goood !!
Típicos ratas 🐀🐁
music in 3:00 pls
fan-tastic
Two melee weapons equipped at once. Literally unwatchable.
awesome video
lol that was hilarious
Danm, get rekt Corridor Digital
Frickin awsome
awesome dude👌👌👌
RIP
Epic video
Banana man LOL
This is awesome
kys
Amaaaaaaaaazing
BANANA MAN @0:30
so cringe
Um I wish the game was that hectic in the beginning
The PUBG I know is a walking sim with random death moments features. Anyways great vid!
Omg you are a genius thats how the zone should work, you cant see in it every thing is blured, Fu** you zone campers!!!!
Story of our life
Whats the name of the song? I cant find it on the link you had in the description...
nice and cool effect working. And music theme is really good, I like that :3
That was so good! Thank you for your efforts! ;)
New watcher here\nThat was good
When the Bombs hit the Ground and explode with a Sound thats a scary
The effects were amazing
This is sooo well made!!! Loved it!!
i like the animaton of the blue wall
We need a link to the remix of the Battlegrounds theme, and we need it now!
Ok I love the shit out of Corridor, but this kicks that videos ass.
im tired of all the live action adaptations of the game making melee weapons look bad ass.
0:07 thats so me in the background
I don't know which one is better. Nukazooka's or CorridorDigital's
Holy fuck, that quality and accuracy!
This is actually really really good
very very Good!!!!! \nI live it.  <3
wow! i need more video
Not realistic. That wasn't a c-130 at the beginning...
Well we all would've died if we were out of the circle for that long but lol I love the ending circle. Whenever I get automatically marked in the circle I try running on the edge of the circle lol. Well it looks like you didn't survive long enough to receive your winner winner chicken dinner... But your team's production on this remake live action deserves the best chicken dinner. Just make sure you use your frying pan to make the best chicken ever 😂
They really need to nerf that frying pan.
3:48 The way he holds the can changes after the cut. Other than that, great vid!
Pubg dev should really catch up with u.
1:01 menpan  lol
フライパンつえーｗ
OMG thus is  amezing
Editing was fucking awesome!!!!!!👌👍👌👍👍👌
That frying pan is OP
AWESOME !!
Props to the renderer
Those special effects tho
Nice
Damb nice fricken cg
Good video!!!!
The new freddiew

00:30 BANANA MAN

Everything about this is perfect. The visuals, the sounds, the kills, and memes....
This was actually so good well done
0:29 - BANANAMAN!
this was great!
super well made
Omg it was amazing
I need that synth remix
*takes helmet off* *puts glasses on*

the swagger pan
Remix anyone?

a little cringy but nice
fucking red zone
Lmao thats good
B A N A N A  M A N
Omg! More,moreeee
Truth or dare????? (Typing with your elbows isn't actually that hard)
WHY IS EVERYONE IGNORING THE FACT THAT COLE ISNT EVEN IN HERE?!
They RUINED the show by making this show sexual other then that the actors are dope but come on really??
Something is off with the Chemistry. Team ignores Cami and reactions change when Ashleigh speaks
did anyone else notice that when kj is on the couch he has his arms around lili and ashleigh but is touching lili and not touching ashleigh? lol i ship the whole cast w/everyone lemme be honest 😂
Why do kiwis sound australian next to americans hah NZ fan wya
Weird Cole was there for the photoshoot didn't anyone else see the posts on Instagram the cast posted of them wearing the same clothes and background?
4:18 KJ is having a flashback crisis
WHERE THE FUCK IS COLE
looks like all my fav comicstars from childhood got exploited or something
I bet the cast of riverdale would be the best friends like ever
She was not singing
Camilla has the best style
Favorite child hood show.........WHY did none of them say Archives Weird Miseries?!?!?!
But can we talk about Lili’s pants😂
It took me till 3:48 to realize K.J had an accent.... wow.
typed this with my elbow
My God he has an accent I did not know that
Who else tried using their elbow to navigate through YouTube after cam did?
Madelaine: omigod rocket power, ROCKET POWER!!!\n\nShe sounded so aggressive it was hilarious 😂
where the heck is cole at??????
Is it weird I got a riverdale ad?
omg I forgot kj was Australian and I was shook it
when kj was speaking i literally needed caption lol
there all, mostly, as pale as meee
they're so annoying and not even funny (but I love Ashleigh)
why is nobody talking about the fact that lili did the spongbob alien scene
I just typed truth or dare???? With my elbows
Nah I reckon KJ Apa would more suit being with one of his own kind #Don'tForgetYoutRoots 😂
where is cole though
where's cole at??
I love how embarrassed kj gets it's adorable
I was laughing so hard, they're so funny. I wish I was friends with all of them :(
Where is my babe!
WHY COLE IS NOT HERE ? ♡
Guys what does KJ say about date, Cacey says i'v seen it, can you tell me??? \nI watch it over and over again, but i can't get it :D
i'm typing with my elbow
where in the world is coleeee
this video is my aesthetic in every way possible
I wonder if their clothes all match on purpose
I wrote this with my elbows😂
This is one good looking cast
3:56 That's tragic.\n\nme.
Love the cast!!!! This is the coolest
Am I the only one who felt the awkwardness radiating throughout this video?
I can't be the only one who finds them all annoying as FUCK
Seriously love this cast. They are so genuine.
Now I am going to try to text with my elbows 😆
I’m surprised no one said their favorite childhood show was Suite Life of Zack and Cody to make fun of Cole
why is camila so left out. love her
“We’ll see you on the flippy floppy” 😂😂😂 dead
Lili and Madeleine seem very basic and not funny at all. Ugh, riverdale is so overrated. And Cami looks like she is left out.
where is cole sprouse???
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Lamb chop
they hella cut camila out
Where’s cole @???

9.3m ....\nOnce keep streaming.....\nLet's make 10m ..\nFighting ...
Hey, some really important messages to ONCES. I know all of us have suffered from trolls/haters/immature fans attack and harass time after time after time. Since ''ONE MORE TIME'' released, I at least reported over hundreds of trash comments, and many of them still keep coming to attack us. And many of us already addressed this issue. I hope the situation can cool down a bit. Right now we should all focus on supporting TWICE because that should always be the NO.1 priority. Even if you want to defend or fight back, you've got to remember two golden rules:  1. Don't accuse a whole fandom and generalize them as attackers. Because it's incorrect. Every fandoms will have mature and immature fans. If you posted comments like this, it's totally unfair to those mature fans who don't want fan wars and have nothing to do with other immature fans behaviors. 2. This is even more important, never ever attack artists !!! I repeat : Don't bash artists and drag artists into fan wars. Just don't do it. Artists have nothing to do with fan wars and they all deserve our respects, even if we aren't their fans, we still need to respect them. If you can't obey those two rules, then I suggest you to use your time to support and promote TWICE. We will have ONCES who know how to do it to defend and protect this family when needed. We as a fandom already suffered from hatred too much, don't make things worse. \nLast but not least, I have followed KPOP for over 8 years. Last night was a tough night for me. SNSD was the group that brought me into KPOP since 2009. Most of you might not be their fans, but I really hope you can understand what SNSD has brought to KPOP and what they means to KPOP. I won't talk about them too much here, but I just hope we ONCES can also respect them, I believe we will because we are a mature fandom. That's it, I will use every possible ways to support and to fight for TWICE AND ONCE, I am a hardcore ONCE and I really hope all of us can unite and fight for the legacy of TWICE and this ONCE family. See you guys, TWICE AND ONCE FIGHTING !!!
you guys forced me to press the like button
Dear Once, let's keep streaming for 10M to support our girls ..... fighting !!!
ONCES, please remember to think of TWICE first before other groups. Make sure we are fulfilling our own goals first before we do charity work. Remember how we always help others but when it comes to streaming our girls' MVs its mostly just us. Not telling you what you should do or what you shouldn't, just think about it TWICE before you play the good Samaritan. We've done that enough and somehow all those *dislikes* hardly look motivational anymore.
Can they be any more perfect!!?? LOVE TWICE FOREVER!❤💜
9.3M! Really almost 10M! Come on ONCEs, we are going to make this song hit and even hitter than TT!!
Once keep Streaming this video and other twice music videos and keep liking and subscribing in their youtube channel❤️
We are saddend with the news about SNSD ONE OF THE GREATEST ARTIST of Kpop. It is up to Twice now to carry on with the Legacy of Legendary Kpop Girl Groups..\nThis fandom is READY. We are backing Twice all the Way. As Once we can do nothing Less. ONCE 💖 TWICE

I wish I had the time to talk about how impactful each member was in this MV. They all had such good killing points. ❤️
this video reminds me so much of SNSD's early cheerful, bubbly debut days and this is not an offence both are different groups but seeing this makes me feel emotional now that three members will be leaving.....I hope twice members will always be together for a long time with once.......stay strong and rule girls !! wish a lot of success to twice......sincerely from a SONE ❤❤❤❤❤
Blink here! I REALLY LOVE MINA HERE. SHE LOOK GORGEOUS!
Dear Once's! Let's Go 10 Million Today! One More Time is a new song,may be because of\nthat it attract us so much to this BOP! To those that want to keep advancing the View's!?\nKeep streaming and keep saying Give me Give me MORE! ONCE LOVE TWICE!!!

I really want to be able to purchase this song. 😭

Britney Spears disliked...
Momo’s voice is so annoying ugh and idek why Tzuyu got picked she sucks at singing like seriously JYP just picks people who are pretty not by their talent, JYP is ugly as well
seriously ..I am so sad..This song is bored
Do one on persons of interest and zootopia. Please.
It's not really to do with the execution of tragedy and catharsis.  It's popular because it doesn't make the point obvious.  You're inclined to watch it from the start because you want to figure out what weird thing is happening.  The endings are often twists.  The structure lends itself to catharsis but many stories do.  It departs from the typical story arch though, you're rewarded with satisfaction in knowledge rather than satisfaction in resolution.  If you've any interest in marketing things to gen-Xers and Millenials you'll understand why that's important.
To me, Twilight Zone did what Black Mirror does, without the need to think about futuristic technology. \nThe world was grounded for it's time, and even when there would be a morality to the story, it never made you feel content and have resolution. \nIf anything, it made you feel like you were just as capable of doing the messed up stuff people do in that episode.
A love Eminem so much.. but please could talk about why actors like Jim Carrey, will smith still lost to find only one Oscar.
I love your videos so much! I even watch the ones about topics that usually don't interest me. This week's topic is definitely an interesting one, though.\nI've seen the first but I've never watched the second episode of Black Mirror, probably for the same reason I'm never going to rewatch Idiocracy. I feel that both, BMs first episode and the idea behind Idiocracy are brilliant, but I've always said I feel they hit to close to home. I've despised the people tuning in on the Prime Minister's misery in the first episode of BM, while realising that, by watching the show, I was one of them. The uneasy feeling of voyeurism while being helpless to do something to relief the PM's pain is unbearable. Idiocracy on the other simply didn't make me laugh. Not because it wasn't hilarious but because it was too close to our modern day reality. When a certain president was elected last year I couldn't stop thinking about how shockingly close we are to what was meant to be a socio-political satire.
Talk about Mother! please
okay i will watch it\ni will\ni promise
Have you put on weight?
My only note is that at 2:07 you say the public does not enjoy/seek out tragedy in real life. I need only point out how the 24 hour news cycle that has made this very thing a form of entertainment as opposed to informational like news was originally intended. Love the channel. Keep it up.
As for me it's also addictive not cause of this tragedy things ,but much more cause it shows people and society their problems in pretty aggressive and dirty way.\nLike...FACE IT,you're piece of ...poop.\nAnd it's all built on this small pieces.
At 0:56 it says that Fifteen Million Merits is season 3, episode 6... it's actually season 1, episode 2
Please do an video about the movie mother 😭😭😭😩😩😩😩
Enjoyed this video. Interesting layout of how you analysed Black Mirror with mentions of GOT.
Black mirror causes empathy toward those who we would at first argue don't deserve it\n or takes away are empathy towards those who we thought deserved it\n\nSomeone who has watched the episode will find themselves often arguing with people who have only heard the premise
I'm such a massive fan of black mirror. I would to hear your commentary on each episode.
Nice video, wow I didn't know blue Apron has soooo much plastic packaging, that's horrible.
Best show ever Black Mirror
It was so much better when it was directed at a British audience.
can you please do a video on Revisionist History by Malcolm Gladwell
With the one bright spot being my sweet perfect 80's Lesbians
I need to watch things die - from a good safe distance \nVicariously I live while the whole world dies
Fantastic analysis!
I'd argue that we do enjoy tragedy in real life, not always, but often.
Bulllfighting is the culmination of this - death is an actor - death visits the stage.
I like it mostly for its thought provoking , high technological future subject.\n , the idea of a virtual heaven? To live withA homunculus with your loved ones dead memories and personality just for your sake?( this one was the most for me cuz its relatable) , man , there's nothing to not love about this series.
The first episode was the only episode that really got me. You think it starts out as a joke but in the end you feel really really bad jus tlike the citizens in the show.
Can someone who likes the show help me out with a question?\nI haven't seen the show. But looking at this video, I can see that, obviously, it invokes a lot of heavy emotions, it looks beautiful, it seems very original,... but. It also seems a lot like torture-porn? \n\nLike, look how miserable we can make those people, and how they don't deserve it, and how they can't get out and it's depressing and disgusting. Watch how we can take all kinds of people and put them through all kinds of crap. Enjoy how they get emotionally broken! Be amazed at how _original_ the torture is, too! \nObviously that will make me feel heavy emotions. It still feels like a sort of Hunger Games. Torture porn on the next level; not with (or solely with) physical torture, but with elaborate psychological schemes/happenings. Saw in pretty, for the intellectual!\n\nAgain I want to point out that I haven't seen BM. I'm _not_ judging it. This is just the impression I've got from this video, but considering some of the people who love it I think that this can't be quite true. (The show's probably really good even.) So, anybody like the show and want to 'defend' and explain it a little to me, please? :D
Because Charlie Brooker is a fucking genius that's why.
So much talk so little said. Unsubbed
fuck your sponsors go to a supermarket
Once again, SO GOOD
at 0:55 the caption says fifteen million merits, Season 3 Episode 6 but it is actually Season 1 Episode 2
Can anyone tell me which season the GOT spoilers are? I’m on 5.5
Here is the thing. \nI had never heard of Black Mirror until you posted this video. I clicked Watch Later and started watching them on Netflix. I just finished the last episode. \n1. I didnt want any spoilers \n2. Well there isnt a 2 other than to say there isnt a two\nI sure am glad i didnt watch this until after I was done!  Which ive seen every single one of your videos so I knew enough not to watch unit i was ready. \nGreat video btw. As always. \nAny more great shows i havent heard of you want to tell me about????  I am now kinda sad that i binged watched the fucking awesomeness that was BLACK MIRROR? I NEED MORE!!!!
What is the name of the song that comes on at 6:55???? It is the same song from the episode.. A Million Merits.. the theme... pleaseeeeeeee help.
Please do a video on A Ghost Story
0:56 Fifteen Million Merits is the second episode of the first series.
I couldn't get past the first episode, not my cup of tea
I thought the sponsored bit at the the end of the video was a lead up to something really dark and messy. It wasn't. And thereby totally ruining the actual message of the whole video.
Black Mirror is disgusting. A show entirely based on covering the deepest depravity of humanity. Shows like this should not exist.
I don't get why Black Mirror is so revered. I don't think it's clever. You know how each episode is going to end. Badly. You know your going to watch character A go through situation X, and the opposite of desrired outcome Z is going to happen and in the rare cases where Z does occur it never justifies X. There. Black Mirror explained in a word formula.
I love your videos man! Great work as well. Only this time I don't understand why you mention that Black Mirror doesn't evolve around the concept of Catharsis? I think it is fundamentally based on that concept as almost every hero of every episode is, in the end, subdued to the process of facing the consequences of it's own actions. With a tragic end in most cases as they couldn't avoid their fate, that they themselves created. Would love to understand more what you mean. Thanks!
well thanks. i will safely skip this show if i happen to stumble upon it. the idea of convening meaningless tragedies is not new. always wonder whether it's a good thing or not. never been my thing...\ni thought game of thrones was about families fighting? may have to skip it too
That's why I don't like the highly praised San Junipero, as much as it is a beautiful a story, it's the least Black mirrorish episode of the whole show.
Hey Nerdwriter, can I subtitle some of your videos into Turkish and post them ? credits to you of course
Oh, shut the fuck up.
Fuck. Being spoiled by this video is a Black Mirror episode itself. P.S. Blue Apron would be å great title for this.
PhillyD brought me here. GREAT VIDEO!! But where was the BB spoiler?
Could you do one like this on Bojack Horseman?
Black Mirror’s episodes don’t remind of tragedies like Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, or Antigone, but it very much reminds me of 1984. Those first three plays end with a closure and you feel the characters like Macbeth, the Capulets and Montagues, and Oedipus got what they deserved in some way. But in 1984 and Black Mirror there is no satisfaction and no one really gets what they deserve.
I'll get the family deal for one person
It deals with a lot of cruel and unusual punishment. Having one’s memory wipes every day and tortured for people’s entertainment? Indefinitely?? Forced to literally spend a million years in complete isolation with nothing? That was especially fucked up considering that he was a good guy and only did what he did because of impulsive, angry behavior. Also, what good does it do to punish someone’s copy for millennia when the organic version’s still locked up? What are they going to do to the original? Such technology could be used for so much good yet here it is used for ruthless torture and the enslavement of sentient intelligences. That’s why this is so dark.
can you next time speak on gameof thrones spoilers smh? please use a warning... not cool
I... Didn't... Know... That.... The dude from braking bad died.... Fucksakes
To me it seems that Black Mirror is all flash with no substance. The writers are very good at coming up with imaginative scenarios around technology and it's possibilities, but they all boil down to the same overused trope. It's lacking in the nuances and details that make a really exceptional show. I really think the draw of the show is less that it's genius, and more that it is avante garde. \n\nBasically, the draw of black mirror is the same as under age drinking. It's only fun because it feels rebellious.
I love your videos!
The episode with Domhnall Gleeson ended happily. She was able to put her feelings for him away like a box of keepsakes. She still loved him, her child as well, but they knew that the 'man' in the attic was an approximation.
Pleasure is not the only human motive
REVIEW BLADERUNNER 2049 PLEASE I LOVE YOU ABSOLUTELY
unrelated, but please do a video on BLADE RUNNER 2049... I just watched the movie and would love to hear your opinion on it.
At 0:56, Fifteen Million Merits is credited as being the sixth episode in the third series; it's the second episode of the first series.\n\nI think it's telling that there were few, if any, clips from The Waldo Moment used.  To me that's the only bad episode of the series to date.
Blue Apron is fucking bullshit. Just buy your groceries it's so much cheaper.
How can bb and got still be spoiled at this point.
I dont say thank you because, because of you a what all the black mirror, with, at the end, a bad taste... but it work
Black Mirror is not a tragedy, unless not getting what you want is tragic. It is about the darkest implications of technology, the limitations of using technology as a substitute for reality. Comparing it to Game of Thrones is just odd. Black Mirror is not about tragedy so much as it's about trying to overcome loss and the limitations, shortcomings and consequences. A better comparison would be that it's about the future after the downside has been revealed: Facebook, not when it was hey! I can stay in touch with all my friends, but Facebook with algorithms for advertising to antisemites, it's use by Russian intelligence to undermine American democracy. If I had to write a Black Mirror episode that was five minutes long: Someone finds the perfect mate using an advanced online dating app, they meet, everything is amazing, except one person likes Grand Theft Auto, the other person asks on the way to dinner, 'Can you wait while I run into the bank? then robs it, starts a shoot out and as police close in hops back into the car.
It wasn't to underage kids, that what the other guy did and Kenny was too shocked to disagree and clear it up before they fought to the death
Is this like Outer Limits?
Maybe now that you can cook you could stop using Blue Apron b/c that company creates so much waste.
My favourite episode of black mirror is the Christmas special season 2 because it makes you think the most about how blackmailing can be used for good but the consequences of it to
Black Mirror seems to me like a good example of cyberpunk, with the emphases on advancing technology and the resulting dystopian elements, especially in regards to economic class. However, I think the more plausible sub-genre of science fiction is a sub-genre known as post-cyberpunk, in which the sheer number of issues stay the same; some problems are solved with technology while new ones arise. This, I believe, is what we've seen with past advances in technology. For example, the development of antibiotics was a profound achievement in medicine, but it is also because of those antibiotics that we now worry about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I did recall that the various iterations of Ghost in the Shell are an example of post-cyberpunk, especially the Stand-Alone Complex series. I think the sub-genre of post-cyberpunk has a lot of potential, perhaps even involving stories analogous to other sub-genres. Imagine, for example, a space opera, except instead of being set in space, it's set in a vast sea in the distant future, where the design elements of the sea-borne vessels and the marine life can often overlap...
I actually really regret watching black mirror, it just lingers as a dark spot i my mind. I think that if we want honesty, there is plenty to go around, but in entertainment this is just not for me at least. (Not meaning all honesty, but the total display of parade of tragedies) This does not make the show inherently bad, but I do think that for many people like myself, we just do not want or need to occupy our time with it. I don't find it challenging or developing in any way, it has just conjured grief and unease. \n\nI still loved your composition of the video, and I am a huge fan of your content. I just wanted to give you maybe a (less intellegent, less researched and shortly formulated) different view on it.
I personally watch it because it reflects our own society through a distorted lens (a black mirror, you could say)
We don't like hearing about tragedies in real life.\n\nYou know that's a lie. People get amped up. News outlets go crazy with all the sensation. It's a circus. People LOVE tragedy, it's just faux paus and socially damaging to admit it.\n\nYou don't admit it because being a personality is how you eat, and how people perceive you determines how well you eat.
I'm sure Nerdwriter is not unaware of the irony of the content of this video and the sponsor of the video. \n\nI hope people can learn to go to the market and find their own ingredients. Perhaps think for themselves.
Very disappointing analysis. It's like the guy didn't capture any of the ethical implications in any of the episodes within black mirror
the add at the end was disgusting. promoting something that produces so much garbage in form of plastic bags for produce that needs no wrapping makes me sick
Spoiler alert for the following: Season 3 Episode 1,3,&5, Season 1 Episode 3 of Black Mirror as well as Oedipus.  Hopefully you’ve read it by now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think anyone is actually going to read this but if you would like an opposing viewpoint to this article, please continue. I’ll try to keep it brief, this is a youtube comment after all.\n\nSo I feel like you’re slightly off on your point. When you talk about Catharsis around the 1:10 mark you say that Black Mirror only has Catharsis when the characters in the story experience relief which happens in season 3 episode one and season 3 episode 6. If you look back at Oedipus for example you actually don’t have that experience, when Oedipus experiences his anagnorisis he has blinded himself and is banished from Thebes. My point is, to evoke Catharsis you don’t need a moment of relief or a happy ending, you need peripeteia where the protagonist’s fortune changes from good to bad and an anagnorisis where the protagonist has a shift from ignorance to knowledge, which Black Mirror has, for example the ending of “Shut up and Dance” when Kenny is caught by the police.\n\nAlso just to throw my hat into the ring about the meaning of Catharsis. If you take a look at Greek society when they embrace the idea of ideal forms. This part of Greek society did not believe in an afterlife so they believed the only way to achieve immortality was through being remembered which typically meant through wars. The idea of Catharsis was to purge emotions such as pity and fear from the audience so that they were not seen as weak and could become ideal men. \n\nAll of this being said I would assert that Black Mirror has a closer resemblance to the roman playwright Seneca as opposed to Aristotle. The first big difference between Seneca and Aristotle was that Seneca allowed violence to be displayed on stage. For example in his version of Oedipus when Jocasta realizes what has happened she rushes to the front of the stage, cuts open her uterus and bleeds out on stage as opposed to Aristotle having her hung off stage. As we have seen in several episodes throughout the series, they are not afraid of horrific displays of violence on screen, they even make reference to this in “Men Against Fire.” Seneca’s plays would also have moral harangue which is similar to season 3 episode 6 of Black Mirror where Bing gets his own show at the end of the episode where verbally assaults his audience about how they participate in the society they are all in. Also on an unrelated note, Seneca had a fascination with the super natural, much like Black Mirror's fascination with technological dystopias.
you should try the leftovers.\n\n\n\n\nso goddamn depressing..
Warning! Game of Thrones spoiler alert. Almost threw my phone at the wall when I saw it. I'm only on season 3 of G.O.T.
All people are asking for is a spoiler alert. No one is asking you to move a fucking mountain. Damnnit Evan. And I really liked you and your content but if this is how it's gonna be from now on, I will never watch a Nerd Writer vid ever. Unsubbed and disliked. Fucking asshole
Why would anyone wanna watch this?
FUCK YES, I love this show. Thank you for this.
Man everyone makes these faces of tragedy (infinite reincarnations!)
1:21 That spelling mistake, though...
Ever Heard of spoiler alerts ?

https://youtu.be/oZGgXkb4V6w
For me, you two are the best comedy duo I've ever known. With content like this, there's no way you don't blow up eventually.
Posting a day late? Forgiven
seriously where are all your subscribers guys? like every video is gold!
This has become one of my favorite channels in a short amount of time
You guys are like american Jack and Dean
What if there's a bunch of channels out there with this level of effort but they don't blow up because of lack of marketing... Maybe? I'm just trying to rationalize why you don't have a million subs.
I laugh out loud at ALL your sketches keep up the good work :)
YES POSTING AGAIN! THIS MADE MY WHOLE MONTH
i legitimately had no idea jack played sokka in avatar the last airbender
I really love your stuff, guys! By the way: I forgive you, too.
HOW DO YOU PEOPLE NOT HAVE 10,000,000 SUBS?!?!
please like this video for win the competition https://youtu.be/VOfkATP7Z8M
zzzzzzzzz last video i saw was abduction these guys arnt showing up in my mfkin sub  box. putting bell on
Wait. That's David's lair in Alien Covenant.
Sorry, I just didn't really think this was funny.
wow this was funny im mad that this should have more views i will share it tho
consistently well-scripted, well-executed, well-edited, well-produced; the youtube algorithm messed up big time
I have no friends.
One of the best channels on Youtube.
CMON MAN! YOU DONT JUST LET THAT STUFF GO
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
The best goddamn chanel on all of youtube
This video literally helped me figure out some things about me and my best friend LOL. Thanks
That was hilarious, you guys have to be the best short film creators on Youtube.
I just can't get over the fact that's Sokka. Fucking Sokka dude.
I love a good channel that puts the focus on the right factors in their sketches. Its not like WOOO WE CAN EDIT REALLY WELL and the sketches never really revolve around the editing or anything directly related to pop culture or anything. Always very obscure and interesting. Really its just the disctinction between intelligent people and unintelligent people, and you guys are obviously the former.
most underrated channel on youtube. no contest. this video even made me feel better about settling things with my best friend tomorrow. thank you guys, please keep it up.
GUYS. 👏🏼 you're killing it.
I was dying throughout the whole video! keep it up you guys!
This was so funny and so well done!
i love you guys
I think a good way for you guys to get more views is to do a more frequent side series or something.  I'd love to see more of you guys even if it's not your usual big production videos
Man you guys are a true inspiration, every single video is straight fire and so quotable. Beautiful \nI strive to make our channel as good as you guys. One day
Well wiener on the forehead IS a classic prank, just saying *shrug emoji*
Better acting then twilight as well. Hell, its easy when its true.
The production value alone on these is absolutely incredible! Paired with the chemistry you guys have and the HILARIOUS writing, I'm honestly hooked! One a month is just unfair! Keep it up guys, you're amazing ❤
This is why we bring pickaxes and tnt on expeditions
Damn, you guys are good at this
There's something really wrong about these guys not having at least a million subscribers. One awesome video after the other!
Always a great surprise ending!
You guys are so creative! KEEP IT UP!!!
You guys covered so much ground with this one.
Like we haven't ALL taken a picture with Chris' weiner.
I can't think of a funnier duo than these two, not Jake and Amir, not Jack and Dean, not even Rick and Morty.
These are always so inspirational! And funny.
SO GOOD, as always !!
Put on headphones in the middle of a lecture just to watch this. \n\nI'm in medical school.
My question is where do you get the budget?
The smallest channel i'm subscribed to but also my favorite, I love it keep it up and it will pay off!
Jesus this is amazing
Okay wow! so this is the set of Alien Covenant. Was there scenes in that location in the movie?
Ahhhhhh so excited to see you guys upload!!
Please don't encode 21:9 with black bars. Otherwise great video!
I once too put my wiener on someone's forehead.....
Who is bankrolling the productions of these videos?
How do you not get more views?! Keep up the good work!
Im so surprised that you guys don't have more subs, you are one of my favorite channels
How do you guys come up with these awesome crazy sketch ideas? xD
Shared this with my two best friends. Boy, that's going to cause some issues. Someone is getting left in the Scorpion Tunnel.
Slow and steady you’re growing, keep it up guys!
Thank you Jack and Chris for another awesome skit!
I jumped terribly at that last trap. lol poor jack jack
The month does not pass fast enough!  I want more!!! Love these guys
I knew it. But damn it was good.
I just found your channel the other day and you guys are honestly so funny! I'm definitely gonna show your stuff to my friends, you deserve a lot more views and subscribers!\nA lot of love from Germany:)
I'm not your friend, guy!
I am going to show it to all my Best Friends.
Sent this to my best friend right away! Your videos are so good and i get so excited when the new ones come out!!
Please never stop making these videos. Even if you may not have a huge amount of subscribers, eventually someone in the large productions business will notice you guys 100%
How, how have you guys not blown up yet
I love this unique humor you guys have.  I feel like this is more of a series than a youtube channel, and it should be called The Infinite Realities of Chris and Jack.\n\nI remember meeting you guys at FilmQuest a few years back and saw Movies in Space.  I thought it was the best film at the fest.  I've been following your channel ever since the first video you posted.  I'm a fan. Great job guys!
Damn, I never clicked on the thumbnail of a video so fast before in my life
This was amazing! Really proud of you guys! 😚
Damn, the production is getting better and better.\nKudos guys! You are the best (friends)!
Favorite channel on YouTube hands down
Always top notch comedy from Chris and Jack.

That door is racist
Nigga was wall hacking too gawhdamn he doing it right

When a cracker does something wrong, he was pushed to do it....if you're non white, no matter how innocent you are, you're in the wrong....
The increasing number of long range weapons attacks should compel law enforcement personnel to be better trained and equipped.  All officers should be basically qualified infantry men equipped with long range weapons as a counter measure against elevated positions.
MSN WIIL NOT STOP AT GIVING US FAKE NEWS/
were are the body cams of the SWAT TEAM when the breached the room???
I wonder if this happens in Denmark....
I don't understand why people want to hurt others life just because there not living an amazing life
My heart goes out to the shooter's family. They're the real victims in this shooting. If only the shooter had shot the fucking  redneck performer of the horrible music, I wouldn't have complained. It's funny how it's always white Americans that carry out innocent mass shootings.
Steve the shooter,  had 2 planes, I would like to see his flight records, flight paths, States and Countries he visited, petrol consumption, service maintenance recordes, who were his PASSENGERS ?? the passengers list. This would be in all aviation records. Perhaps he leased a plane overseas, this would be in global records, he would need to produce his licence, ID, PASSPORT, to lease any plane ABROAD, then there's the payment records to do all of the above, follow the money and his carbon footprint.
Media is either ignorant or complicit in the conspiracy. There were shots fired at the Belagio hotel over a mile away from Mandalay Bay. There were two people registered as being guests in that room !!!!!!
Cops told niggas to stay within the festival fences. Hm
Are semi-auto guns cheap? is that why so many people have them?
Um, why an hour later after the security guard notified police?
There goes all the fake ass Russian bots arguments that he targeted country music because he was leftwing.
Good on those cops love it
Go to: Movie BREACH - THAN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jesus is the second shooter !!!!  He shot himself to look like a victim ! And his buddy ran away
Is it necessary for George Stephanopoulos  to teach me how to subscribe on YouTube at the end of every single video?
shooter? i would call him a terrorist, oh wait, he's a white caucasian.
Thankful for all of the brave men and women who risked their lives and saved many. <3
An hour before they got to him!! Are you fucking kidding me!!!
this guy sure did his research.
Did he just say the correspondent's name is Matt Gunman?
False Flag does not mean nobody was hurt. False Flag means that the official narrative has nothing to do with the truth.
Inside Edition said he never checked into any. This all is insanely sad.
This is proof that Hillary was involved in the LV shootings, look at how poor of a turn out for her book sales.
Sense when did they start filming these tragedy's?
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for you? He had no criminal background but look he carried out a massacre!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLkruVqQLEM \nyou have to be REALLY, but REALLY stupid and retarded to think that there is only 1 weapon shooting at a time. 5:00
Now whitey knows how it feels to be shoot at for no apparent reason, like innocent Native Americans , Blacks and Mexicans have endured for many many moons!
Where is the hotel security camera footage?
HOW MANY TIMES IS THE AVERAGE DUMBED DOWN IDIOT AMERICAN GONNA FALL FOR THE SAME BULLSHIT TRICK. IF YOU BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL STORY YOU'RE NOT FIT TO WALK THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
100 round clips? those are 30 round clips. Only way for 100 rounds is in a drum.
Or they had multiple hotels in his name because they were shooting out of all of them! Quit lying MEDIA!!!!!!
Chicago Illinois was next Google it,

alright so basically \nStephen Paddock wanted to kill himself, but since he was messed up he wantedto kill as amny people as posible with him\na clever plan. but not so clever if he kills himself
Wow ! Silly me!! I just got it !! It's like a dick extension having a gun and having a bigger gun is a bigger dildo!! It's only just occurred to me that this old dude probably can't get it up any more!! I mean look at all the younger spree shooters who did it because they couldn't get laid, well we know this dude had money and a girlfriend but he probably lost it cos he's now a limp dick!!\nYou see that is what you need to do now America, tell the truth about why a man would need a big gun , let alone 40 of them!! You need to let young kids know how deeply uncool it is to need a gun. What man needs a gun ? Over here in Blighty we would consider that being a pansy as tis old school to have a bloody fist fight and guess what? Nobody dies.
The sad thing is that these hotels have little to no security he could have done the same at any hotel bring all those weapons in ... also what did he have against country music instead of rappers? Hmmm....
There had to been two shooters. He couldn't have done it alone.
an hour later? Thought it was 10 minutes
Thank the lord he didn't shoot up the rap show....

Why still no fucking hotel videos from inside!?
Also google LIVEWIRE VEGAS. 1ST RESULT SHOWS A GRAPHIC VIDEO.
This are all fucken lies the media is reporting. Tell us the truth . Just let's us know the truth . He had help and let us know who help him .? Everything is fishy
Guns were placed previously in the room...the guy just walked in and got the keys at reception...inside job.
false flag perpetuated by the demonrat libtards to take away muh guns!
The conspiracy theorists are not the only ones u gotta watch out for now lol anyone can go nuts
Look for the photo released/leaked that show the dead lone wolf on the floor. \nThen take special note that there is a rifle on a bipod OVER his left leg. \nThey reported that he was killed on breech, then they said it was suicide, now they are back to killed on breech. \n\nLooking at his body position with the rifle over his left leg...... hmmmmmm>\n\nI hope you can find it, but the pic of his face shows he spit up a lot of blood, but you can see he was shot in the lower chest to stomach from the front. \n\nWith the rifles position and his final resting spot, that means he was shot by someone else standing in the room at the broken window. \nSWAT didn't enter the window and they did not have a sniper shooting into the room. \n\nFor all those who say the 4th floor muzzle flashes were the reflection of a strobe light, tell me how a moving cab wouldn't have fallen out of the reflective line of sight of that distant strobe reflection. \nNot to mention other camera angles showing the same muzzle flash. \n\nJust watch all the first shooting videos.....where the guy was still singing on stage. \nYou can hear shots and echo, but then you will hear overlapping fire. \n\nHead back to the pics in the room and look at the shot with his legs in the photo....top left of that photo is the window he was shooting from. \nThere aren't nearly enough empty casings on the ground for this to make since
He should've uploaded the videos to YouTube before he killed himself.
Who else flinched when they demonstrated the ak
WOW  Lone gunmen don't need several spots to shoot from,  Teams do.  Real deaths, real injuries, bad reporting.
What will be next step for USA government.
If we don't want this to happen anymore we shouldn't be creating more gun laws. We should just have metal detectors added to buildings. Going in and out. That way they can keep track of the firearms better. Concealed carry is ok. But you can't have someone stockpiling weapons in any building. If you bring a weapon in you can't bring another one in until your other one is out. Its called being smart and caring about what goes on.
Chicago people still being killed by gun men. No outrage there, the hypocrisy is real!
a sad moment in history
George Stephanopoulos is a little bitch, I remember he called this monster Mr Paddox fk him. Call him the killer or evil man, not mr you stupid ass news anchor. What a douche say what it is politically correct ass hole.
IT'S GOVERNMENT SETUP AND HE GOT FRAME FOR IT BLAHHH
what is that odd piece of furniture around 00:25 with giraffe print? strange, appears to have sections and cracked on the outside. anyone have an idea?
Why did he dicide to go and kill country folk?
FBI created a Lee Harvey Oswald.
More people, the better.
What about the note found near the body - WTF is the media suppressing this information?  They keep saying no suicide note or anything - yet clearly there is a note on a table right near the body!
Admiring the fact that it is fall and in Canada it's freezing but there you see he has his sleeves rolled up

I wonder what those “fuck the Police“ people think about that when they need some one to save ther ass the police are ther when they don't need them they just talk 💩.
It's only a false flag when a white person does it but if you're not white you're a terrorist

..Gathering people who wants to be a part of building a network of stable, fully self sustaining and self sufficient communities (a.k.a. life-boats for the coming social & environmental collapse).  Peaceful communities that are built upon foundation of : love, spirituality, mercy, generosity, tolerance, intelligent, and wisdom. If you are interested in becoming a part of this grass root efforts, I encourage your reply.\n\nThis Community ARK Project is looking for peaceful, patience, humble, and kind-hearted people who are awaken and aware of the coming social & environmental collapse; who want to roll up their sleeves and participate in preparatory efforts. One cannot pull someone out of a raging river standing on a muddy slippery slope. In order to pull someone out of the river, one must stand on a firm solid foundation. A fully self-sufficient community is that solid foundation, upon which we stand in order to rescue other less fortunate who will be affected by the collapsing environment.  If people are struggling to survive as the environment collapses, how can they help others?  People need fully self-sufficient communities to shelter and nourish them, in order for them to reach out and help others.\n\nWe are gathering people from all spectrum of professional background: engineers, scientists, architects, biologists, farmers, doctors, nurses, artists, etc. Both skilled and unskilled people. Those with knowledge will teach those who lack them. Those not in the know will listen and learn so they might in turn teach others in the community. We have spent 6 years researching technology that were designed to allow Mars colonies to thrive in a desolate environment. We are now planning on using those very same technology to prepare people for the coming environmental collapse. If you are interested in helping out, we could use the help to reach the ears of people who are awaken via social media, or you can read our blog titled Generalized Plan of Action for a list of positions you can volunteer for.\n\nWe are speaking to those of like mind who do not need convincing; in their hearts and in their thoughts, they recognize the catastrophe that lay ahead if our modern societies continue on their current path of promoting competition, strife, ignorance and scarcity. This Community ARK Project is lighting a beacon so that those with similar mind set will know that they are not alone in their thoughts and impulse; that there are others like them out there who desire to come together to pool our effort in order to extract ourselves and place ourselves on a different path.  One that promote cooperation, harmony, foresight, and a nurturing environment.
Notice the WHITE media keeps showing MANY pictures of the non-white Filipina who didn't even commit the crime, but the WHITE man who's the perpetuator has only 1-2 pictures, yes, mostly ONE picture of him with EYES CLOSED.\nNo doubt they are trying to WEAKEN the image of the WHITE barbaric man in the head of viewers. \nDirty white bastards strike again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Don't worry folks, we will see the hotel security video as soon as they release a better video of what actually hit the Pentagon

I knew Denzel's He Got Game 'fro would make a comeback!
Even denzel gets that feminist bullshit
I love Danzel Washington, and I cannot wait to see this! My 2nd most anticipated film of the fall season!
I love Dankzel. Finally! A movie against all this liberal agenda bullshit! And here I thought Hollywood was forcing a liberal agenda on us.
The whole we were filming this movie it was called Inner City, i guess they changed the name in post...
I LOVE MYSELF
oh hollywood ugh
writer and director of NightCrawler, alright, i'll give it my attention.
So this is the movie Ashton Sanders told Denzel on the red carpet of the Oscars that he was gonna do with him! Too bad Ashton had to drop out of the project :(
So this is why he gained all that weight.
Bout time this trailer dropped! Can't wait for this performance by Denzel.
Test it but not repeat ?
Looks good terrible title
Another Oscar
Have to watch.
Denzel can play anything.Cant wait
#VamosSuscribete a mi canal  por favor plis
When Denzel goes for shots at another Oscar....I'm there for it.
Definitely will be seeing this. November is shaping up to be a good month for movies.

Each one of us is greater than the worst thing we've ever done.
Sony Pictures Entertainment, you guys should team up with LEGO to make a LEGO GhostBusters movie for all of the long-time GhostBusters fans and all of The LEGO Movie fans out there and then make a irresistibly fun LEGO GhostBusters film franchise out of it and it'll be THE greatest film franchise Sony Pictures Entertainment has ever made in recent memory. The long-time GhostBusters fans will even say it's right up with the hit TV show, The Real GhostBusters, itself on so many possible levels. #LEGOGhostBusters
Where are the trolls? This movie looks good!
I know a guy who's a local pimp, can I report him to the cops for cash??
NO Oscar for Washington. No nomination. Nothing. This movie is awful
more stupid worthless niggers trying to play the victim bullshit
Love the vlogs. As horrible as it would be, I do wish that they would take you to the labs in China where they test the products on animals instead. Hopefully everyone would wake up and see how these companies profit from the torture of these innocent, scared animals 😢💔
Am I the only one wondering how the lipstick turned out?! I was hoping you would try it on! So curious about the color!!!!!!!!!!!
Love love your outfits ❤️
Wow, this is such a great opportunity, so glad that you have had a chance to create your own lipstick! Good job! :)
Good to see Patricia.\nThat Balmain bodycon dress is hot on you. \nBalenciaga bag and shoe. Girl you are popping.\nOh and the DVF dress, the turquoise brought out your eyes.
You look like sarah jessica parker in the thumbnail
Take me with you Lydia next time💋💕

Congratulations on 500k subscribers!! 😊😊❤️
Love Lydia 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄 !!! please follow my DEPOP @kaddensecondhand
You look stunning wit your make up and hair like that!!!!! 
Make up tutorial when you wear your black dress
Ps- Another fab vlog from you again Lyd, they just keep getting better!
Lumi does the paw and claw thingy to put his scent down there! He’s claiming you 😻
The paris dress matches the bag but not the black boots.....
You look like wonder women with those glases lydia so beautiful
I know your sister she goes to my school
I would Never Buy one there are so many shades out there

I think you look ten times more beautiful without makeup
Love that Balmain dress!
Is your Peekaboo the mini size?
Looooooool “hold on to ur butts” 😂😂😂
Go Lydia♣♣♣
You are sooo pretty Lydia 😍
12:19 Lydia looks exactly like faryal makhdoom Amir Khan the boxers wife
Lydia you did not look bloated. If I'm bloated I look like 6 months pregnant 😂
kartal kalkar dal sarkar dal sarkar kartal kalkar
love patricia 💕
Love your videos !!❤️
Lydia u r gorgeous!))
WOW...you look stunning !!
Loooooove the long vlogs xxxxx
PAT!! AHAHAHA
Hi Lydia! Love this video; as always :) and what a bummer. I was also so  excited for you to work with Brides because of how excited you are! Hope all is good between you both. 😘 😘
Loved this vlog so much Lydia, you looked stunning as usual and your lipstick shade was amazing!! I wish they could put that on sale xx
Love the make up look for the party. You look really pretty with ur hair tied up! X
Lydia, feed Lunie on a flat plate or a wider bowl. She might not like her whiskers touching the bowl when she eats and that could be why she drags her food out to eat it. Cats are weird like that.
Lydia please please!! do makeup tutorial on the one you were with the Balmain dress, it looked stunning on you!! xx
Patricia we love you😀❤
At the start of the video You did such an amazing job with your make up 😱❤️just loved it..
What is the lipstick youre wearing at the beginning? I need it
Ok but was the rubber duck actually chocolate????
So it's a chill one today, we're just heading to Paris that's it... 😂 who wants Lydia's life 🙋🏽
Love the ponytail look you've been rocking lately! Might you do a hair tutorial for it in the future? X
Cats do that paw thing because it reminds them of the womb. It's a comfort mechanism.  bless her!
What is u nice hair Colour called?
I've been on maternity leave for the past two months and though I really loved watching your videos before they have become a nice break for me from mommy duties. I love what you do, you make my  day when I have me time.
loved the vlog such an amazing experience!! love Balmain
SWEETGREENS! I discovered them in the US and have been obsessed since. They need to open one in London. Like now. Literally the only thing I eat in America. #guacamolegreens\nAlso, you look gorgeous as usual. That dress is amazing on you.
That’s what cats do when they are happy and relaxed, it’s like the motion they made when they were kneading Their Mum while drinking milk as kittens.
Sorry, not a fan of those huge clear glasses....looks kinda odd ~_~
Wow, the Balmain show must have been a dream come true and it looked so extravagant and princess like. I am really sorry though about the Bride's Show. I know you have been looking forward to it. Stay positive, maybe an opportunity like that will come your way in the future!
I loved ur video but lumi just makes its pop.  I just love her little self.  I have a kitty named Cali but she doesn't hardly talk.  Ever.  So my request is an entire video of a day with lumi.  It may be difficult with ur work and all but I know if anyone can do it, Lydia can.  Love u both.
the glow scrub must be new..it doesn't come up
Thank you for your wonderful vlogs! Would like to ask you a question. You and Ali are always traveling , going to parties, meeting different people. How have you solved the issue of jealousy?
LOVED your outfit to Paris: roll neck & H&M satin shorts. Obsessed!!!! X
So Happy that i found you on YouTube 🙏 love you Lydia 🎉
You are SO pretty😍
You so beautiful, I like your dress.
Cats do the thing with their paws because it's what they do on their mother's breast when they are nursing and they never grow out of it. They do it when they are warm, relaxed, and feeling lovey :)
Hi Lydia\nThe watch you are wearing in this blog will you let me know what make and size it is thanks. Have to say you look fab .
Love all your outfits!! You look amazing 😍 xo, Daria
Omg I would love a lipstick made by you together with L'Oréal! It would probably be the best nude ever. ❤️☺️
the london transport is really bad
been really loving your make up lately xx
Your gratitude is what makes you one of the best YouTubers.
Really bloated? Pleeease Lydia give us normal girls a chance eh?! 😂😂 \nGreat video! Xx
That mayberlline red lipstick looks beautiful on you
Oh wow, must show us your final product of your lipstick :) Lumi is so cute, must have missed you so much 🐱
Its so wonderful to see your success. You’ve worked so hard for these experiences!
What an amazing trip! The Balmain dress looks gorgeous on you!
Tori Amos for the runway show, GENIUS!!!
no sorry to the ladie below but Lids i love ur over 40 min vids....keep them coming.... :)
Lydia what photo camera do you use for taking pictures ?
I absolutely loved that dark lipstick that you wore at your shoot! So beautiful
I'm waiting for the colder weather to come, so I can see your jumper dress outfits again!! My all time favorite AW clothing item, and you make it extra! I'm currently rewatcing some of your vlogmas 2016 videos just for that purpose.
when cats feel confident and secure they like to do that thing with their claws. By the way  i really love you and you are such an inspiration! Maybe you are comming to austria some day :)
Omg there was an Estonian model!!!!!! Im from estonia!!!!!! So proud of her, we actually danced together few years ago 🇪🇪🇪🇪
Your older videos.were more watchable.n entertaining. Now it's so much of needless talking . Why change the concept?
Please do your evening makeup with charlotte eye palette
Wow, you look so beautiful! It seems your body is even more toned (not like lost weight, but more sports) and your cheekbones are chiseled and goddess-like! Really cool, so happy for you :)))
I LOVE when Lumi makes an appearance! 😻
I hope it will be cruelty free
Cats do that motion with their paws, because they feel safe and comfortable with you. Basically, it stems from how they would get milk from their mum as a kitten, so when they feel in that same safe way, they do it. It's super sweet, means she loves you lots :)
I can't understand the craze to wear clear glasses before I had my eyes lasered I detested my glasses and had it done purely for vanity sake. But then mine were really thick lenses. Love you Lydia and look forward to your vlogs so much 😘😘
LOVE the first out. Simple, autumnal and your legs 👌
You are one of my biggest inspirations and I have so much love and support for you. My only wish is that when you filming in a car please wear your seat belt. I know that your an adult and can make your own decisions and I hope you understand where I am coming from. I don´t want anything to happen to you or anybody else for that matter. We are so many people that look up to you so I hope you will take this in to consideration or not just film and show that in your videos if you decided to not be wearing a seat belt. Hope you have a wonderful day Lydia :)
Your cat is just kneading :) they do it as that is what they would have done to their mum as a kitten!
I always wanted to make a lipstick! Lucky you!
I love that black dress, need it in my life, how tall are you and in wich size is it? :)
That balmain dress looks like it was made for you, fab! Xxx
That Balmain black and gold metal dress is sick! Love it! The bag should be w one handle and it'd be perfect, methinks?
OMG PATRICIA AND LYDIA IN ONE VIDEO!!😍😍😍
Patricia is my fave glad they appeared together on this vid
Love seeing my two fav YouTubers: Lyd & Pat!!! You two need to get your butts together and create a bleamin video, seriously!!!!!!!😂
I wanted to see the lipstick!!! Please show us soon.
Hey Lydia, I have been subscribed for a long time but in the last few weeks/ months I havent clicked on your videos as much mostly because they are always over half an hour long and to be honest while I love to see a vlog sometimes I do also like short snappy sit down videos. I do not have the time to watch 40 minutes of youtube and I dont wanna root through your vlog to find what you have bought or what you are wearing. I do understand that you want to share parts of your life with us but I'd much rather watch a series if they are as long as your video. I still admire your Style and your personality but I havent watched a full video of yours in 3 months which is why I have decided to unsubscribe. Just thought you may want some feedback. All the best to you <3
That Balmain looks superb on you✨Lumy probably approves of that one over the DvF 🐈
Love everything bout Lydia’s style ❤️but that nude/blue/black/white dress... no no no. 😬
I'm here for you guys. I know CPR. Keep eating that much. You'll need me sooner, or later.
closer to 1x100 but still cool
I could have devoured it BY MYSELF!!!
They didn't waste it and thats all that matters to me so kudos Buzzfeed
I hate how yb is super skinny but eats all the time 😂
YB and evan need to be in more videos pls n ty
What’s wrong with me?? Why am I turned on watching her eat 🤤
Heard of heart attack?
Omg, she's so skinny(in a nice way) and yet she can eat 20 patties. p.s 1 person 20 patties, 17 people 1 100x100 0w0 ok...
could of fed half of Somalia
It's metabolism, it's in her genes. She has giant shits, that is the only logical explanation when you think about it. \n\nI'd love see her bowl after a meal, if you know what I mean... (just out of curiosity)
Good luck with heart diseases
@mattstonie
WHY AMERICA WHY!!!!
Matt stonie or furious pete will definitely complete this
isnt it just a 100x5
Evan and YB are literally the human embodiment of perfection.
Pretty sure thats a whole calf or something...
That girl is pretty
You could have fed 16 Poor & Hungry African children with this!
That waste of money......... millions in Africa could have eaten that
I love YB. She is fucking awesome!
I wish i could do that! I love cheeseburgers 😍😋❤️
At my In-N-Out (it's only in the state) I cover my burgers in *frysauce.*
Am I the only one who ships? Lolol
Is it me or the Asian girl is so cute
Do buzzfeed people only hang out with other buzzfeed people?
Just wondering if YB actually has hyperthyroidism... She eats a lot but is too skinny even if she says she exercises every day.
Buzzfeed is trying to fucking kill these 2. They always do the eating challenges
they better be eating healthy for the rest of their lives
YB is a monster!! I wish i had her metabolism!!😅
I want to pipe her
i could eat this all my self
I can relate to YB. I eat more than my friends but I'm the thinness and i don't exercise ever.
I want in n out right now so badddddd bruvz!!
I'd need half a bottle of tequila for that.
In n Out is overrated. I  prefer Wendy's or Shake Shack any day over Inn n Out.
After 3 or 4 burgers I wouldn't be able to move ,these asians can eat !
YB is perfection. Evan's cool too
Jesus Christ yb you are the real boss dude!
Who eats utensils on the burger?
Everyone: that is way too much!! \nMe: that looks quite um... Good. I say Breakfast and Lunch... Maybe Dinner.
how does she eat so much and so fast?
Everyone who gets into buzzfeed would get fat
If she's eats like that. You know what else she's good at eating.
i wish i could be like yb she loves eating but she has good body  😦😦
Its a good burger for a party, but not two people lmao
love these two,  expecially YB, seems so nice
can i work at buzzfeed to eat that burger T_T looks so yummy ~
When the said 100X100 I thought it was like 10,000 so step it up buzzfeed
Kind of find these video ideas pointless other than having views and revenue because it's just a waste of food.
Evan is from heaven 😍
THROW THE TOMATOES AWAY HOW DARE YOU.
I love YB i can relate to her soo fucking much
K so I'm a 6'3 fatass and I couldn't eat more than 6.
What’re the point of these.
dont mind being hired to do these :)
Cultural appropriation at it`s worst, there are no blonde asians, only white women can have blonde hair.
They’re making Evan lose his eight pack to make another ‘we got abs in a week’ video lol
Why am I watching this? This is literally a vegetarian's worst nightmare.
ORRRR she just has high matabalism.
I just had like two burgers and a fudge ton of fries and my stomach is killing me and I'm watching this and I'm actually puking
1:55. There's an article saying in n out managers and lawyers can earn the same over a decade working towards it yet only one will have massive student loan debts. Moral is if you work hard and can wait 10-15 years you can make a lot and have food benefits as an in n out manager
That's American for you
It's out of pure curiosity but I always see YB eating a lot of unhealthy food. However, she never seems to gain weight.
I don’t understand why they only had 2 people do it, and these two make a lot of similar videos. Have other people do it!
I could eat that
Lol my friend saw you guys buying those at ni n out
I could literally watch Evan do anything! ❤️❤️❤️
I would Love to try this challenge with a Vegan, so I could eat everything ;)
I want to see YB do competitive eating
I have never had In-N-Out....
YB is from outside of this world!!! She is in all of the eating-like-a-beast videos
I luuurve a nice blonde Asian, suits them
I love her! Lmao
YB is so cute 💕💕💕
In-n-Out associate. AMA lol.
Legislative computer shortly retired nonetheless van.
Metabolism? Nah fam, puking is what.
somebody call matt stonie
i could eat 200 big macs rn
FAIL
Die
WAIT I THOUGHT EVAN'S VEGAN?!?!?!?!
cancer and cholesterol gains
She's hot
My chest started hurting watching this lol
They should date
Date already.
2:27 \nEvan: HELP MEEEE\nYB: 😂
YB what a fucking beast!
YB is so pretty !
Waste of water...
Try tacos
As a vegan, this is my worst nightmare
Damn, only in America 😂
I'm not assuming bc I wouldn't know- but I feel like YB may have an eating disorder bc she can eat so much (binges) but shes pretty skinny...?
the other korean girl is hotter
Meat is murder
99% of you won't see this. But have a great day? :)
Loving the vocals.

Love it and Kane's voice is deep and beautiful. The first time I heard There Goes My Everything touched me!!!
This is perfect\nCome kiss me one more time\nI couldn't dream this up\nEven if I tried\nYou and me in this moment\nFeels like magic only\nI'm right where I wanna be\n\nEverybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go\nSaying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful\nLying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced\nCause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven\nCould be better than this\n\nI swear you're and angel\nSent to this world\nWhat did I do right to deserve you, girl?\nI could stay here forever\nI'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room\n\nEverybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go\nSaying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful\nLying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced\nCause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven\nCould be better than this\nCould be better than this\n\nEverybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go\nSaying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful\nLying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced\nCause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven\nCould be better than this (heaven)\nCould be better than this (heaven, heaven)\n\nI swear this is perfect\nCome kiss me one more time
Wow.........first line gave me chills, his voice 😍😲😀
Your voice is what makes me like your songs. I usually like a song for it's lyrics and the emotion put into singing it, not for it's singer. But your voice is what makes the songs you sing so much better. Please don't take this the wrong way, but I don't believe you when you sing, like I am not convinced that it feels like heaven for you. But your voice is so beautiful that even though i'm not convinced, I still want to hear you sing it.  +KaneBrownVEVO
LOVE HIM I THINK IM IN LOVE WITH HIM
Why is there 817 dislike this song is amazing
Kanes gonna be as famous as Jason Aldean one day
I love your music I have been following you since you posted your first video on social media. You're an amazing singer I just can't get enough of your music its just the right beats and the perfect words.
Yasss! Loving this song and his voice is dreamy

i love this song
ya I relate to this song a lot . I remember hearing a kid say I'm gonna kill myself so I can go to heaven . So maybe God made things like this so we wouldn't kill ourselves and go to heaven when we where supposed to . Ya that got deep
Thanks YouTube for putting this in my recommended😍😍😍😍
You have such wonderful music. Keep going strong. ❤
Omg love this song from the frist few words
This song is so incredible
Kane. Brown is the bomb !!
He’s so... polished. And so... smooth. I’m enthralled.
the name of this song is my first name. I love it!
Very good this misic
He made this song for the vegas shooting, he is giving half the proceeds of how many cds of this he sells to the victims.
Nice song! Sorry not being creepy. lol he's old enough to be my kid😂 !
Move To The google search And Type: *gamesecrxguide facebook* It is the purely working facebook secret working these days. Don't waste your entire available free time on other tools
Glad I get to see you the last two times u were in Oregon... Now come to eugene oregon please
One of my all time favs. Keep it up bro.
Beautiful. Such a chill song and his voice is like butter
The next big Super Star of Country music....For sure
I have already listened to this song so many times. I love it so much.
I'd like to hear it with less backup vocals on the chorus and definitely less instrumental. He has strong but smooth vocals.
Love me some Kane Brown!  :) His voice + his looks = perfection
nigger garbage
Fag music
this is fucking stupid
EWWWW country no
Thisss\nIsssss\nTrashhhhh\n\n21 21 21 SaVaGe

Wow! What a beautiful song! And Paris Jackson moves fantastically!
This is incredible, Paris really is something else. Such a beautiful music video 💛
[Verse 1]\nYou should put that cigarette out\nYou should have faith in my mouth\nLike my mother, like your son\nLike my temperamental lungs\nEach piece fits into the next\nI come not black and I'm not white\nBoth reveal me in my sight\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou've got twinkles in your eyes\nYou said, Vegetarians save lives\nBut there's your wings, despite my back\nThere's your baby's bassinet\nWill there be one more of me?\nClose my eyes and try to hide\nFrom my form of dragonfly\n\n[Verse 3]\nLittle Bear woke in the woods\nChipped and peeled the hicklehoods\nIn that pen under the covers\nI've been stealing from my lover\nMoments I cannot replace\nTo my former dragonfly\nI resist and I survive\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhat a state I've brought this to\nLogic lies [of mine?] pull through\nBut what's that say of my character?\nI retreat back into nature\nWill there be one more of me?\nTo my form of dragonfly\nI resist and I survive, survive\n\n[Outro]\nI survive\nI survive\nThis is resistance\n\nI survive\nI survive\nI survive\nThis is resistance\n\nI survive\nI survive\nI survive\nThis is resistance\n\nI survive\nI survive\nI survive\nThis is resistance\n\nI survive (oh, this is resistance)\nI survive (yeah, this is resistance)\nI survive (this is resistance)\nThis is resistance (this is resistance)\nI survive (this is resistance)\nI survive\nI survive (oh yeah)\nThis is resistance\nI survive\nI survive\nI survive\nThis is resistance

the world needs us. our time is now to make that change <3 i love you all Today and everday I challenge you in the mist of hard times. to love stronger and harder. The world needs it more then ever right now. Shut off the news, put down the phone, tune out, to tune in. The only way we can fight these forces is with love. Do something for someone else today, big or small it doesn't matter. A simple positive change is a change in the right direction. I'm here for you, you are not alone in this world. We are all in this together, so its time we start acting like it <3 i love you all, have a blessed day hug the ones you love a lil tighter and smile at strangers. stay humble be blessed. <3 i believe in the good things coming <3 one day one day even to those who hate me everyones that done me wrong thank you Thank you for helpin me grow aand love myself even more♡♡ either a lesson or a blessing i have no time for hate cuz i'm to busy loving the people around you know we really can do so muuuch with so little if we all just learned to love and accecpt. sometimes you gotta accecpt things you cant change, and hey thats alright cuz your still beautiful on the inside you where born a star! <3
This video is very simple and yet so meaningful, it manages to perfectly capture a feeling of finding your place in life, being part of nature and the universe, being free and living life with all its joys and sorrows. And Paris is a beautiful human being and such a talented actress, just look at how expressive and fluid her movement is when she is dancing!
thank you so much.. I'm almost in tears its like... I see poetry and beauty only, this song is inspiring.. Paris jackson is  so full of light.  I'm in love for the art of life.
To the Few people who are commenting a Dislike on this song.  Keep in mind that it is a song Nahko wrote a long time ago.  This song is not indicative of where his Sound is moving too.  Nahko chose this song because it reminded him of his Friend - Paris Jackson and he wanted to capture her Pure and Natural Beauty and Inner Essence.  I Think Nahko and Crew did a Fantastic job in this..  Paris has a You Tube Channel.. You can see what she is really like.  A very down to earth young lady with a sweet soul.   I expect we will hear much more of Nahko and MFTP music that we will love as much as the other songs now and in the future 💗
So moving, totally resonate with this. You can just feel the energy through the music
Vim pela a Paris
Nahko, you always make me want to cry and smile :)... your music picks me from ground many times. This song again hit my life, I finally found a girl that understand me. After year 3/4 year that i have a really bad break up, it end when it don´t have to. But now i feel happy and you make me fly in mind with my dragon fly :). You're music shaman to me and i hope this will come to you, to make your day better, as you make mine :). and to all of you, open your mind, open your heart and fly. Cuz YOU know you want to fly :)
I like Paris Jackson (Michael Jackson's daughter) in this music video. She is a pretty girl. This was a good music video and a good song. Very relaxing. You can play this at work or in your car on the way to work to calm and center yourself. I am a music lover...trust me this is a good song. Also I heard influences 100% of The Dave Matthews Band...instantly...the voice is very much similar to Dave Mathews voice! Not bad...if your gonna be influenced by someone then let it be one of the best bands out there.
Mmm right in the feels, but I'm feeling strong and unified. ❤
Jackson❤
Such a good song
Love always!
Paris is so beautiful ♥ i love her.
Medicine
Here for Paris my beautiful sunshine ♡
This is medicine. It couldn't be more perfect. Thank you. See you in Bristol. Much love <3
So delicate and inspiring.\nAll the nature and the human connected.  Beautiful.
I've been away from nahko's music for a little now, maybe two weeks since i heard a song? But i was drawn to search for him today, just after a new song was released. Spooky!
I dont even understand why tears welled up and why I find this so emotional but its a great video. I love his eye.
Finally..I have been waiting for this video..Paris Jackson..WOW .She is such an amazing women..Mike is so...Proud of u babygirl😙😙😙😙
Paris is the beauty of nature personified
zero: stay tuned Nahko may do some very un-like Nahko things too, some already claiming to see..
Paris is my new age hippie inspiration how she can be so beautiful I don't understand ☮🌸❤❤❤❤🌻
Alguma boa alma traduz pro português por favor✌
My paris🌻💘
Paris Jackson is great, this song is so relaxing
Beautiful song. Nice music video. I love nature. We should all protect nature.

:) Nahko you never disappoint me.\nSuch a beautiful song and such a beautiful video.\n\nI love you guys. All of you ♥
This is such a beautiful song as as well as video, and it is mainly or partially due because of Nahko Bear. And of course  the other part of thee success of this video as well as song, being his producer or his producers.
my dream is to collaborate a song with you. hope to one day make that possible.
Thinkyouknowmusic on Twitter brought me here.
i'm in love

A survivors song.....thank you! Strength given and recieved <3
Loved it
I'm looking forward to the new album !!! Since I started listening to this group, it seems a lie, but my life changed. I have learned new things with each of their songs, they have helped me to overcome very bad moments, they have helped me to learn things, to make my life different otherwise ... Thank you very much for being there, Nahko and Medicine for the People\n\nRegarding this song, I love it, it's beautiful. I liked that someone explained to me a little what he understood with the lyrics of the song, because to this day, I'm not very clear about its meaning.\n\nThank you!\n\nMuch love and respect for all! : D
Beautiful video! Thank you!
Beautiful, thank you
chur..neat alright! plz come back to Aotearoa sometime soon!
Beautiful
La copia barata de The Scientist, pero con la sucia de Paris Jackson.
VEGANS save lives❤ \nI love you nahko😙😑😙
Why  not run the video in forward motion?
did the band break up?
Whats the name of that dancing yoga practice that i see in almost all your videos ?
Paris Jackson is so beautiful.😍 Song is boring & music video was so boring.😞
Speechless.. an amazing song and very emotional the video.. i don't have enough words to explain how much i'm proud of you Paris...  your daddy is so proud of you.. thank you for everything.. a big hug♡
Paris has such a beautiful soul man. Omg. And she's gorgeous
Paris seems like a reincarnated Flower-Child ~ evoking remembrances of my young days in the 1960's.  Pairs carries the beauty and grace of her father. Sweet soul, lovely and kind.
I hate Paris... but I love this song ❤
Million dollar voice 💖🙈

Im crying because im so proud of you ! <3
Hi grace! First of all I just want to say that you’re so pretty and so talented and I want to be just like you! I’m just mindblown of how amazing you are and you are my inspiration and my motivation to just keep on the going. Lol you just make me feel stuff that I don’t normally feel 😂 this weekend I actually had super long hair and I cut it really short like yours so you really are a inspiration but not on just a haircut LOL I like you bc you’re talented, you’re sweet, you’re pretty, you’re funny, you’re relatable, and you’re perfect in every way and no matter how much people tell you to give up just don’t because they’re all jealous and they need to calmmmmmm downnnnnn lol \n\n                                    jur average fan lol 😝 \n                                                                            -Emsley :D
Just casually dancing down the street while this song is blasting through my headphones
Grace! I have been watching you since your first appearance on AGT. I think as of last week I had heard and seen everything 'Grace' out there. Then Austin and BANG, you blew my mind all over again. 4 new songs that are off the charts young lady. You seem to have an excellent crew on top of so much of what makes this whole thing work in this next phase I see you in.\n\nIn my opinion, you have knocked the new Album to a top 10 position on the Pop Charts. As you have said about AGT, ‘Miracles do Happen’. Don’t be too surprised, this is destined to greatness and if there were award shows in December 2017 coming up, you are winning some great honors. If you do that…if it happens that fast, it would be like a world record of Unbelievable Songs, Great Lyrics, Great Ideas, flowing, and Miss VanderWaal's two other huge traits. \n\nAs a singer she has transformed herself into a dramatic belter with the croaky voice when she wants it. But her voice is smoothing out BIG TIME and her control has become so apparent, which I didn’t expect so soon. This Austin Show, the act with the keys, drums and guitar was simple astounding!\n\nHow can you possibly get this ‘so polished so fast’. And to know you will continue to grow and bend and change and probably blow us away again in 6 months or so. \n\nThe cliché many comparisons have been made and I'm form the sixties and a musician all my life. She elicits memories to Bob Dylan, and the great poets of that era as well. Second, as a performer she has been aware of her abilities to elicit certain responses in her songs and performance from the words to the color of the lights to pretty much the whole show.\n\nThe way she commanded the ACL stage was her incredible ‘trying to please and make safe, the world’ energy coming together with what I think is the idea that she was a flower opening up and to see that manifest so quickly must be applauded. She reminded me of Bruce Springsteen. Dancing moving, looking so professional. I know you could write a book about reflections of a 18 mos and how to get this kind off transformation to happen. Maybe keep that a secret for a while.\n\nThe ACL show could not have been more you and not more professional. You had an extremely talented band who were taking directions of a 13 yr old and paying you total love and support with their smiles and eyes watching you; paying you huge respect and love. Who does this? Grace does. Especially your Austin guitarist was so communicative with her glances at you that I thought to put her on the full tour coming up, if you get her.\n\nI have seen nothing like this in 30-40 years if ever. Michael Jackson comes to mind. Congratulations Grace on everything do you; you deserve it an more to come. And we’re all happy that Grace tries to just be Grace without putting on too much pressure. Please.\n\nDe-stress in mediation. Don’t treat the treehouse as a summer 1 week vacation spot. Go there!
Grace Vanderwaal and Melanie Martinez need to make a song together!
It was wrong, well, it never worked\nOr at least I told myself\nTo not make it hurt\nI try to blast music\nIn attempt to get you out of my eyes\nBut I can't escape my mind\n\nI hate you 'cause I've always\nLook at your picture\nAnd I tell myself\nThat I'm over you\nBut then I get a little unsure\n\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind\n\nI know we were never a thing\nBut I always think about\nWhat could've happened if we kept going\nAnd I never had this happen to me\nOnly in the movies\nBut honey it is happening\n\nI hate you 'cause I've always\nLook at your picture\nAnd I tell myself\nThat I'm over you\nBut then I get a little unsure\n\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind\n\nI can't escape my mind\nI wish I could turn it upside down\nOh, I can't escape my mind\nOh, no matter how hard I try\nI wish I could turn it upside down\n\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind
❤
Love it!! 😁

I wonder if negativity can work to our advantage. If some people go on Taylor and Miley's latest video and say your not happy about Grace's latest., maybe they will come over here in droves and we can get the view count up a bit. Just kidding
shes done better but i still love it!!!!!
I'am Brazillian and love u Grace s2   you're much talent
Here before a million!!!! I love Grace Vanderwaal
Mel B - “For once in my life” Could had been coincidence?
Grace is so amazing, her talent will  flow ... and we follow the path...
Hey, she is in love!
I live in the Tucson area no ones playing her music on any of the radio stations even  though her hits views are well above the artists that are being played any answers her talent and songwriting are in a league  of its own I love her
I like it🌞✨💙✨🎉🍀
Honestly so relatable
Overrated singer.

This reminds of the day dogs😀
Bet 1,000,000,000 Dollars That Grace Won't Pin Or Answer This.
I get the feeling this song isnt just about the classic love story, it may appear that way but to me it has a whole other reason, hating yourself thats what she means when she says she sees it in the movies she sees the big terrifying deppresion hallucinations tv sets but in actuality its something that is just there thats who she hates herself she can escape herself she cant escape her mind, it might not be what it mean but thats how I see it
When is there a full album coming out
the one bit is almost screamo.

I for one enjoy being in a theater and not my home when watching movies of this caliber. The sound design and score through arclight cinemas Atmos sound system was the best character of the film. I'm always perplexed at reviews of movies that are too long.
Didn’t see the original yet, will probably watch it now. I’ve heard to watch the final cut. 2049 was gorgeous and the best film of this decade. The score is spectacular
Blade Runner and BR2049 don't have pacing issues. In BR2049, every single scene moves the plot forward and contains important information to the next scene. Most movies these days are bloated with exposition and quick edits to make it seem like the movies moving faster but nothing of importance happens for like 30 minutes. In this movie, A LOT happens in every scene, the plot continues to build at a steady pace the entire way through, it's not slow or an issue because the scenes are just long takes that immerse you into the world and let you just breathe and take it in. That's *proper* pacing. If you say the pacing is slow or it's boring, it makes you seem kinda dumb, or your taste in film is immature and gravitates towards unimaginative crap like the MCU/Fast and Furious/Transformers movies.
great sound, graphic and cast.. still overrated.. watched this on midnight screening.. good lullaby..
I put the visuals right up there with Fury Road. I don't say that lightly. It was too long however. Shave 10-15 minutes off and this movie is nearly perfect.
respect your review but totally disagree with you about the pacing, that being said I'm a huge blade runner fan. I thought the sequel was one of the best sequels ever made.
I have nothing against Ryan gosling but in response to what Jeremy said in the first 1-2 minutes of this review.....Gangsterland (or is it Gangster Squad? I forgot). Man, is he bad in that. Pretty much everyone save Sean Penn phones it in for that movie.
It's about love and hope found and then lost.
I'm glad the movie took it's time. Finally!
The movie was a 3 hour bore. looks great though but not a enjoyable movie.
I didn't really like the first Blade Runner. I like the concept and the idea behind it but the movie itself I just didn't like\nI liked this slow burn movie a looot!  Darn well too long yes indeed.\nThe main complaints will be.. the audio balancing and the 'BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA s. \nIt wasn't the theater.. but the balance was just off, near the end of the movie, the SFX were just god awful loud then anyone talking is just so quiet. It was horrible when they did that.\nSecondly and far worse for me.. the Bwahhhhs.  Dear lord. They had over 30+ scenes with bwaaahhs for the sake of  bwaaahs. Trying to be hyper dramatic or something? Every. Single. set up scene that I can remember had their own bwah. Flying over the city? Bwaah. seeing the lil hover drone shoot out towards the desert? Bwaah.  Opening of the movie? Bwaaah. They had a bwaah. then a shot of his apartment for maybe 3 mins. then another bwah. followed by the inside of the car... then another bwaaah right after that.\nJust what the flying fuckery was going on with that?\nLike everyone was making fun of it from that one inception movie and after that it became a funny thing to comment on.. but this one can't even make fun of. just soo many...\n\nso yeah... the movie itself and content I all enjoyed but some random details just annoyed the hell out of me. \nStill i'd watch it again if someone else bought the ticket or it shows up on tv later.
I hated the original the first time I watched it. But I was like 15 I think. It bored me to death. Then I rewatched the original & the directors cut back to back about 10 years later. It’s one of my favorite sci fi films. But I can understand why a lot of people don’t like it. Prolly 90% of the people I know who have seen it hate it. They say it’s too slow & boring. It’s like an old 40s noir film meets science fiction. And I love it more and more with every viewing. The directors cut not the original lol.
Jared Leto was so under used. He could have been such a great Roy Batty. But the movie was great anyway.
HOW WAS THIS MOVIE NOT AWESOMETACULAR????!?!?!?
I was not impressed by Blade Runner 2049.  It was too long, too confusing, and its ending was too abrupt.
I never saw the original, still need to watch it but I loved 2049.
It could have been a good movie. if they made it 90 minutes , and cut out all the slow crap parts.  i was annoyed as fuck !
SOLDIER was the original Blade Runner Sequal
as someone who hasn't seen the original blade runner, yes this movie does appeal to casual viewers and it made me interested in finally seeing the first one although i'm not sure which one i should see since I've​ heard it has been George Lucas'ed
love your reviews Jeremy,love how you add those funny mimic bits in many reviews of yours. It would be great if you could actually do more trailer reactions too.the new JL trailer? Have you seen it? What did you think about it?
I kept thinking Robin Wright's character should have been played by Lucy Lawless. (Or was played by her)   ;)\nIt felt much smaller than the 1st movie, def could have cut a lot of this movie and yeah felt like a retred of the 1st.  :(
Don't like the original. Loved this one
god i could not watch this fucking dick cheese guy i wanted to slap the shit out of him with in 30 seconds holy fuck
How does this douche have a million subs?
So, I watched it with my girlfriend yesterday and she enjoyed the hell out of it. She wants to watch the first one now.
Can I watch this without seeing the first?
Gosling was NOT great though. His character was so FLAT. I had no reason to care for him. He was a sad, pathetic character. Don't agree with me? Let's discuss. =)
I am not actually a huge fan of the original Blade Runner but absolutely love Blade Runner 2049
Can't listen to this idiot
No more official ratings? E. G. Awesometacular? Also Jeremy's has good thoughts, but his reviews can benefit from being longer
As I teenager I watched the original Blade Runner over and over again. Partially because I didn't understand it, partially because it was my only VHS tape, and I had a thing for Daryl Hannah.  After awhile I eventually read the short story it was based off of which was written by the guy who also inspired Total Recall.  While the film left you wondering about the humanity of it all, DADOES leaves you wondering if the communist have taken over but only half the population knows about it with dueling police departments loyal to two different governments operating in the same city at the same time.
Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be doing well at the box office. Guess it's a blade runner sequel in more ways than one.
Chris, like every other critic and person that loves this flick, is stuck in nostalgia mode. I have been guilty of the same thing, ie Indy 4 and Star Wars 7. Walking out the cinema, happy to just have revisited familiar universe. But once the nostalgia wears off, you realise how flawed it actually is.\n\nThe cinematography and sound was amazing I'll give them that. But the plot and characters were very weak. There was no logic to the storyline, potholes big enough to drive an 18 wheel through. I wasn't disappointed, as I was never expecting much, I heard the rave reviews before had, but new most the critics same age as me, 30 something growing up with late 70s, 80s and early 90s cinema, where just viewing this mediocre flick with nostalgic eyes.\n\nPs Denis is one of my favourite directors at the moment. But unfortunately I think his hands were tired having RIDLEY Scott as producer. I think if Denis was left to his own device's, he would of created something special. But under RIDLEY Scott who has single handedly destroyed the Alien franchise with his latest two attempts. Just leave these classics along.
I don't get the positive reviews for this Movie. Its good, but its not great either. Like Jeremy said the pacing is bad and if you pay money for a movie to watch it you should be happy about a long movie but it didn't feel like that.\nAlso everything was good but maybe too much. Everything was too much.\nEven the Hans Zimmer Music Style was too much for too simple scenes, like it wanted you to feel a certain way about a shot and the Atmosphere for some sceneries was visually so strong like you should feel like this about this scene.\nAnd characters were too much for me too. Leto was also not really needed here and I enjoyed some small characters like the Somalian Dude much more then him.\nGosling was good but I couldn't connect with his distanced and seldomly emotional and reactive behavior. It may fit the newer replicants but compared to the old movie he nevers feel like he is in danger, because he is like Terminator in Terminator 2. The bad guy has become the good guy and will save the day against the Replicant Terminatrix.\n\nI can't get the detail but it was overall an unsatisfying movie for me. Too long and too much.
In the future you can torrent a girlfriend
What's up with your hand movements? Is that a trademark of your videos or something?
I split because Critics are giving the movie good ratings with 7/8 out of 10, Film Fans are giving it excellent ratings with 10/10 and general audiences seem uninterested. I haven't seen the movie but, I think the answer is somewhere in the middle.
I really want to see a spoiler video from you about this movie. There’s so much to talk about
Well done Jersey for not shying away from an insane running time. The movie could've been under 2 hours and been great. Instead it was overly long. I think it spoiled it for me
Watched the movie over the weekend, after having watched the 1982 one twice. As an animation & art enthusiast, it was absolutely breathtaking - I was sitting through the entire movie with my mouth wide open. The movie is full of haunting visuals, incredibly immersive audio & a whole lot of substance & heart. I whole-heartedly recommend watching it in a cinema, if you can, because this movie really benefits from it.
I like the old Blade Runner, but I do very much agree that the pacing in the old one and the new one are both just awful. Great ideas, philosophical questions about humanity and special effects are what makes Blade Runner important, but goodness gracious was this new one full of dull characters. The most lively character was Harrison Ford's. Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto are both phenomenal actors in my opinion, but they were both so crippled by their characters in this film. They didn't get the opportunity to showcase their talents in this one. The plot was also rather cut and dry. I respect everyone's opinion but that's just mine, and I figured I'd share it even though no one really cares.
This movie was bad ass
I like how Stuckmann didnt give away any of the plot
I love the original. Do not like this one. I think the two movies are very different movies, in their storytelling approach.
Not hard pressed to see a sequel made some 30 yrs. after the first movie.
For me its a near cinematic perfection as you can get .I liked it when i first saw it on video long after its original release.I grew to love it and now its my number one movie of all time so far.I did not get to that point right away but its a film you see say hey Harrison Ford hes good lets watch it.Oooh effects intense bad guy that isnt really a simple bad guy.Later you think about the films themes and start to theorise.I watched the various cuts and you started to see more  of Ridleys original vision and then you get the final cut.This film has been like a love affair.Attraction interest mystery intrigue discovery  love.Yep im a fan no i dont have bits of the set or one of Harrison Fords ties.Idont go to comicon dressed as one of the characters.I just love the film
This movie seriously sucked, I don't understand what the hype is about. The story barely chugs along and is way too predictable. Then there are several moments that to arrive at a destination in the plot, the story negates all logic to get there. The audio was completely out of place and sounded like a speaker was being unplugged (staticy). Ryan Gosling was awful, zero emotion. Granted he didn't play his usual smug/prick self that he usually does, but he really was just reading dialogue. But the worst part about this (outside of the 3 hr run time of boredom) is that it wants you to think that it is incredibly deep, thought provoking and artsy. The reality is that this film is shallow, predictable and generic; making it feel completely pretentious. During my screening, the guy next to me feel asleep and several people walked out. Please save your money.
I've tried watching the original (final cut) twice, can't get through it. Saw 2049 in IMAX yesterday. I dozed off in the first 20 minutes and then a Nolan-esque bass sound woke me up. I was a huge fan of the way they did the opening logos. Pacing was up and down, but Gosling and Ford were fantastic. 3/5.
Two things were good about this movie: 1) the cinematography and artwork I guess was special, 2) the naps I got while trying to watch it. Long movie for nothing and the story is super weak.
I found the original pretty boring, but I really like 2049, after seeing 2049 I kind of want to go back and watch the original and see if my opinion on it has changed.
didn't love the movie
Thought the first one was boring, but I really enjoyed the new Blade Runner 2049.
I didn’t see the first, this movie is one of my favs now
I saw the original twice in a theater, yes, I know, I'm old... but this one, the 2049 edition, I just saw it in iMax, and I think I'm going to see it three times... could Denis Villeneuve be the new Ridley Scott, or even better ? what a feast for the eyes and mind, the best follow-up I ever saw. If you're a sci-fi fan, or not, go see it
Love first BR. This was better then I expected, but still kinda meh .. main thing - no music. First is all about music for me. It's more like LP. You play it when you have the right mood for it. This one doesn't have music (for most part). It only has atmospheric sounds ..and that just won't cut it for me. I don't feel like watching it ever again.
SO glad that the thing attatched to the plot with the unicorn is kept subtle. Every single time I watched this trailer I kept saying to the person next to me : But this can't be canon because unicorn!! Damn glad unicorn is still as vague as ever.
This movie is the new benchmark for cinematography and effects. It just looks breathtaking in every scene and the cgi is simply amazing. Every set and background looks real even though it can't be. The level of detail and thought that went into this is absurd. Easily a 10/10 movie for me.
I didn't watch the previous BladeRunner, but I did watch this one, Have to say the lore and story behind felt confusing at times, and overwhelming at others. \nbut overall I did enjoy the movie from an experience perspective, and surely I can tell that it is an amazing film, especially to those who are fans of the first
I feel sorry I yawned so much during the movie.
Will there be a sequel
So to answer your question: Yes, it is absolutely possible to be a fan of this movie, even though you are not a fan of the original! I was born in 1995 and even though I really liked the story and concept of the original Blade Runner movie, I just couldn't stand the aesthetics of it. The whole visual style just made me feel so uncomfortable while watching it (kind of similar to the movie Brasil) that I couldn't enjoy it as a whole. That is to say I aknowledge, that it was a very groundbreaking movie that deserves the many fans it has, just for me personally it was not as enjoyable! \nNow Blade Runner 2049 brought the same qualities as described before just with a different, more modern visual style. So now that I could actually not only stand looking at it without feeling uncomfortable, but actually be amazed and stunned by the imigary, I was just blown away by this movie! \nSo I love this movie and I think it is very unfortunate, that I can't enjoy the first Blade Runner the way it would deserve it!
i caught a matinee today for it and i'm glad i just paid $5.75 to see it. it wasn't terrible but it wasn't that great either.
Saw it in IMAX today...people, THIS and Godfather II are the best sequels ever, and BLADE RUNNER 2049 is the greatest sci fi film EVER. My GOD...I feel like it's 1977 and I'm 13 and I just saw STAR WARS. Movie of the Year...it's the Sgt. Pepper album of science fiction films.
I loved this fucking movie
Who else just skips to rating?\nFYI 4:54 I disagree...
I loved it. My favorite movie of the year so far. I kinda don’t want a sequel but who knows.
I like the original, but I love this one way more
I thought it was visually stunning, the soundtrack was great, the acting was great but I thought it was too long and got boring at times
it was so much better than that stupid first one. and the one with vin deisel in it. now I want my sexbots and flying car in the next 30 years.
i was not aware whatsoever about the plot of blade runner itself when i got into the theatre to watch this.  I didn't knew who the director was and what i was walking into. That being said, i liked it and definitely would like to watch it again having a bit more of background info. Some nerdy things i loved was the typography and the whole concept design of the city and the futuristic world. The music, if you asked me what would my soundtrack song is for an apocalypse yep this whole soundtrack takes the price. I loved how minimalistic it was compared to every comercial movie out there nowadays.
I'm glad this movie took almost 3 hours to show us this world and tell us this story. Heck, I'm watching it again!
Well, I wasn't a fan of the first movie and I saw one of the more recent cuts a few years ago, so don't know if it was the Final cut, but . . . I think I love this movie. The first time I tried to watch the Director's cut of BR 20 years ago I fell asleep thirty minutes into it. It took 20 years to finally watch it all the way through to the end and even then I started checking my phone and web surfing during the dull parts. I did a lot of surfing. But this movie, I was totally into. There was just one time I almost dosed a little and that was during a quiet moment in between Zimmer's new BWAHs score ,plus my theater now has these comfy recliners. I think this will be in my top five this year.

The movie is worst like this review
Answer to your question: I really don't like Blade Runner, found it boring and didn't get why it's such a classic, although I can appreciate the influence it's had. However, I absolutely LOVED Blade Runner 2049. All the best parts of the original were here, but better, and the movie itself just blew me away.
Didn’t watch “Blade Runner 2019” but find this movie interesting, long and tiring at some points as you said, but interesting 😜 BTW love you reviews 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
The thing I really didn't like about 2049 was that you didn't see anyone walking around the city. Like, ever. Never at all. It's just weird.
The thing about the action scenes were how brutal and uncomfortable they were. In real life violence isn't pretty and feels unnatural, and that came across here. Well done.
Anyone else find the first Blade Runner movie incredibly boring??
I've watched half of the original movie and turned it off because I thought it dragged on for too long, and then went to see the sequel. I loved that movie from beginning to the end, it felt like it was 1,5 hrs at max so I was shocked when u said 3 hours, 9.5/10

Kept waiting for the action movie I was hoping for--it never came! Not one action sequence in this 3-hour movie that was satisfying. Lots of expensive -looking visuals that did not further the plot. This movie is more like a Roger Deakins vehicle-- most frames were gorgeous but overly and meticulously photographed to a fault.
You cut your speeches too much, drives me nuts, learn to speak continuously for more than 20 seconds without making mistakes or losing your train of thought.
Can you do a spoiler review? I want to talk about holograms.
Is there gonna be a spoiler talk for 2049?? I'd really like to know your opinion on some story heavy stuff and your thoughts on the ending.
one problem: the future of automotive technology is in Peugot according to 2049...
I just hope Roger Deakins wins the Oscar this time
Ha! All the hype and so far it has bombed. Womp. Womp.
If you have even a passing interest in this film, go see it. Just go in blind. Don't worry about reviews.\n\nTo quote Harrison Ford, I thought it was fucking awesome! I was blown away...
No Awsometacular? C'mon Jeremy.
It was absolute trash

HATED the original, LOVED the sequel.
So sweet of Mathew to wake you up like that!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It honestly baffles me that some people find the motivation to put actual clothes on when they're not going to leave the house
I think my cats would try to eat me if they didn't get fed right away.
You make my mornings look so unproductive 🤣🤣
You're such a go-getter, I can't beLIEVE how motivated you are. And I/we/your audience can tell that you are this productive all the time because in your daily vlogs you always get so much done. It's honestly amazing and I think you're super rad. You motivate me to quit procrastinating on crap in my life and just get on with it. Keep up the good work, but also don't forget to give yaself a break now and then, too!
I feel a bit attacked about the microwaved tea.
i love this video SO MUCH. little barneys grumpy face when you were putting the harness on just warms my heart <3
I love how motivational this is but realistic too. No, I wake up bright and early then I use these 10 products then I have a bath using this product then I do a 5 mile run blah blah blah. You get shit done whilst still being a babe. Love you Hel. One of my utter faves.
I'm so impressed by how much you do in the morning and by the fact that you get yourself up to workout so early! I can hardly get myself to workout at all. \nAlso, your house is so beautiful! From the wallpaper to the tiling it's stunning.
Loved this video Helen! Although I'm so bloody jealous of how productive you are, if it's a work day I wake up about half an hour before I need to leave and if it's the weekend I stay in bed until about midday hahaha
Those black jeans! Where did you get them? 😍
Body looks amazing!🙌
I have a double leash for my bubbis too and it's the best!!!!! <3
Where are the jeans from? X
Where did you get those pants?! They are amazing!!
Love this video!! Looks amazing
Love your trousers where did u get them from please ❤️😀
Could you do a video on the best places in Norwich please? I've just moved here for uni and it would be useful to know some of the best places :-) thanks xxx
Helen, this video is amazing! It's like high-production film, so well made. Loving your content as always!
Any small YouTuber's wanna help each other out? 😊❤️
I would love to see a tour of your place. Just seeing bits and pieces makes me want to see the whole thing put together!!!
Your curves are to die for, darling! And your outfit in this video is stunning.
love the colours in this video so much, so PLEASING
I wish I was able to wear no makeup to the gym but my skin is horrible so I always have to wear makeup even if I'm stepping like one step out of the house
I bloody love you.
OMG YOUR HOUSE IS LIKE A DREAAAMMMM <3 I love it !
Where did you get your jeans and top from? Pretty sure I didn’t see them in your misguided haul so just wondering where they were from

The push up needs to be in an arrow position rather than a T. If you stick your arms so far out you put unnecessary strain on your shoulders.
I just love your videos Helen. There’s something about you and how you film and edit your videos which makes you so unique. 💖
Omg helen you look fabulous in those jeans and shirt with the fluted sleeves 🔥
Wear is that top from??? does anyone know?? I love it!!
You get a lot done before lunch! I also feel your “pain” with a light colored pet. But the floors aren’t dark the furniture is..lol.
I’m reading Order of the Phoenix at the moment too haha
Ahhhh finally a morning routine again!!! I loved it:)
Your a busy busy bee! 🐝 Leg kick dance when your getting dressed - yes! Agreed living room always looks a mess, always replumping pillows 😂 x
Those trousers while you tidying look very sexy on you Helen! 💛💛
Those jeans look great on you.
were are your pants from? I love them!
Where did you get those jeans?! Love them so muchhh❤
You should get a new toothbrush. But other than that cool video, you're very proactive.
So well shot, love it!
I wish we had decent seasons here 😐. We have stinking hot, hot, cool, a day or two (this year we had two Mondays)  of coldish and uncomfortably hot
THOSE JEANS. I must know where
Where are your jeans from?!!  They are so nice 😍
So disciplined to workout first thing in the morning! but girl you need to have proteinafter your workout or you wont see changes!!
Those jeans on you, Helen!!!! :') <3 <3
Totally off topic but where did you get your couch? Is it comfy? I've been searching for a nice one and I can't seem to figure out what is a good deal. lol
I love your home it's so cool. Luv from California
Great job, Helen! love the quality and effort 💕
The only thing i want to know is how long all of this actually takes you to do 😊 i struggle to get things done in the morning
Maff is a gem, you’re insanely motivated and inspiring, and my fav part is Lola peeling out on her walk.☺️
Where are those new pants from? 😍
Helen how have I not found your channel before, god you are a breath of fresh air! Loving your videos xx
Fab video! You look absolutely gorgeous 😍 also twinning with those white boots, I absolutely LOVE mine 😍
Does anyone know what camera Helen is using? :o\nI always found it's such great quality hhh
Gotta know where the jeans are from 😍😍😍
Love those jeans, where are they from?
this was so nicely filmed and narrated, it's like the perfect mix of casual and chatty, but still filmed in a professional way yknow
You have such a nice body Helen💜 not to sound like a creepy weirdo lol but you do
Babes that black outfit is banging on you. You have such a nice shape

The bit with Matthew in the morning 😭😭😭 you guys are so cute
I need to take note from this!!! On my days off I struggle to get out of bed before midday - and days when I'm going somewhere I usually give myself half an hour to get ready😩 What sort of time is it usually when you're at the point of makeup done, gym done, editing done etc, & ready to go out and get on with your day? 💖
GOsh I love these kind of videos theyre suuuper entertaining
i don't know what it is about this video, but it was gooooorgeous!! love it

The way you filmed this video is simply amazing! It's so well done and gives the feeling of a beautiful movie! Everything you do has just the best quality
You're looking great Helen, all that hard work at the gym is showing xx
Dear lord, I class it as a productive day if I get a few of your morning things done 😐\nNeed to get in a routine like this :')
How is that just one morning?! Looks like a flipping whole day for me
this video is really beautifully shot x
I honesty love morning routines, they are so motivating! This is amazing Helen! <3
Your outfit is bomb!!!! ♥♥
#37 on trending!

Love love love this video!!!!! ❤️

That outfit man <3
Your soo adorable !!!!

Leg kick dance club! 💃
Oh I got the leg kick dance DOWN #thunderthighs 😂
When do you do a jobby?
I don't know how you are so productive all the time! 💖
I NEED that top! Was it in your recent missguided haul because I can't find it online :(
you already have a morning routine for autumn? girl it's been 2 weeks
MAFF IS SO SWEET
Love how you stick your finger in the tea haha.  I don't have a routine, I really should.....but most mornings it's: debate whether to shower or not, eat breakfast (a leftover reese's peanut butter cup) LMFAO what is wrong with me??
Pleeeeeease don't use those plastic milk pods for your coffee! They're not biodegradable and they're so so harmful for the environment. Please consider drinking your coffee black (if it's good coffee you'll love it!) or making your coffee by other means. Lovely vid, all the best <3
Free? See now was that so hard capcom?
I WILL NEVER PAY FOR A FREE UPDATE!
Angry Joe where you at?
Finally Street Fighter V is good enough to play. Finally!
I see Capcom finally decided to step up. Hope it's actually good and not just hype.
Come on, Capcom... can Ryu get over the dark hadou already? It's been like 20 fucking years
I'll wait until they come out with Ultra Street Fighter 5.
Free update this is heaven.
The dead horse is flogged to mush at this point
And it only took Capcom a year and a half to finally make me, a dirty filthy casual, to consider getting this. Just having Arcade mode does wonders, don't you think?
Why are people complaining about that they need to pay this!? It's also a free update, but you won't get all the Season 1 & 2 characters though. Seriously people... either buy the game, wait for the update or don't buy it. Geez, read the description...\n\nOther than that, I can't wait for the new updated version of Street Fighter V! That's how it should've looked like before! Thanks Capcom for making Street Fighter V Arcade Edition! #CapcomRules
so the full game was supposed to be out in january we got half game so is this gonna be a content download cause i already have sfv
To all of you people saying it's free 😂 \n0:59
Okay guys im planning to double dip since I have not bought any season passes and only unlocked 3 characters thru FM and bought some dlc costumes too. So what I want is to buy this edition to get the characters. Do I get to retain my bought costumes and stages ?
This not gonna change the fact that you came out with a incomplete game still
game still SUCKS SACK ill go play usf4 on practice mode, so i can throw a fireball with my foot with ken
Maybe it will sneak to Xbox now
This mode shouldve been available in the game since day1, shoddy practice that hurt more sales because lets face it console gamers and some pc gamers dont care about online only play and go on forums and alot more say this release is too late theyve moved on from this game. Have to say capcom even with no xmen in the marvel game and no arcade mode it really does stink where midway is the better fan friendly fighting game company. MKX, MK9 and Injustice1 and 2 really are not bad games and I find to be really good
Congratulations, it only took almost TWO YEARS to give a game mode that MUST come from START and FREE in the launch game.\nThat's the new idea now ?? sell GAME MODES like DLC
Anyway since I already own the game but didn't get any DLC, i'll just sell my current copy and then get this edition to get it with the DLC.  At least that way i'll be spending $40 instead of $50 on DLC? Smh still kinda a loss though.
Now I have MORE of a reason to get Street Fighter V when I get a PS4 Pro.
Oh no Chun-Li showed her underwear. SFV Arcade Edition banned at ESPN now.
Finally over the years..arcade edittion now...take all my money alr!!!!
fuck you capcom for not giving so much importance to Ken when he's one of the best in All Street fighter series and most anticipated Character in online and on Pro tour Competition and winner plus Finalist,  they didn't even Put him on this trailer and gave him a shitty role in SFV's story mode when he deserves much better storyline along side Ryu and guile  *raises middle finger*
Put it on Switch and I’ll buy it.
This would've allowed the game to fully capitalize on the market, had it been available on release. While it will be a nice addition to the game, business wise, it may be a bit too late. Only us who already bought the game will benefit with the new v triggers and stuff.
Glad to see the game is finally leaving beta.
lol they finally finished the game....
Thought you guys said there were NOT to be any new versions of the game, just the initial release.
GIVE US Oro and Sean Please
It took them this long to put in an arcade mode? I feel like it was forever ago when they added the story mode but I'll be honest beating the original street fighter was more fun. Street Fighter five was better than street fighter the movie the game though.. can't even force myself to make it through that game.
Good move capcom now make the right choices for infinite and things will go your way drop a huge graphics patch music adjustments and a massive roster overhaul
holyshit arcade mode is it true?
Street Fighter is vastly superior to Mortal Kombat.
SFV is not doing fine and MVCi is rising fast, so Capcom need to buff SFV to keep SFV alive.
how everyone says how cool and nice this is from capcom.\nThis is something that should have been in the game right from the start.
So its a free update for those who bought sfv
OMGOMG THATS WHAT MAKES CAPCOM A GREAT COMPANY!!!
Now what we need is the version MVCI arcade complete no more dlc edition
Better fix bullshit in this game balrog,cammy,and fucking zangief so  god damn tired of getting grabbed a light speed can't even do a combo with his bitch ass around
Shit Fighter got a bit better now , but it still a piece of shit. Took CrapCom all this time to have an Arcade mode which were suppose to come out upon game release , not DLC.
Man i need a strory mode between Ryu and Akuma!!\n2 V triggers \nNew stages\nNew characters\nBonus stages\nArcade mode\nExtra battle mode\nCAPCOM YOU ROCK!!
Are characters gonna be free too?
I can't believe it's been 30 years for this franchise
If I buy this version, will my christmas Juri dlc transfer
We were sold the beta version, so MVCI I will wait for the free update and not buy DLC
This is what Street Fighter wanted, Dhalsim's brother Dhalsim said paint.
The update it's free, but the season 1 and 2 characters not. Right?
It's obvious that all of those dislikes are from people who didn't buy the game.
Just one question.I have season 1 pass but not season 2,will this effect me if i cant get it for a free update?.i got season 1 pass on day one of release with the collectors edition.
And the third update going to be super street fighter 5 and the final updated going to be ultra street fighter 5 with 60 playable characters?, i hope so
Whos coming for season 3 tell us Capcom
So, the DLC characters will become free?
*Phone rings and Sagat answers\nSagat: What? \nCapcom: We aren't doing too well.\nSagat: .....on my way
Nice only 2 more years for ultra sfv
I have a Xbox.
Remember the SFV will not have the same shit treatment as sf4/ssf4/usf4? ... look at this
Ehh should have released a complete package in the first place
HOPESTAR OF CAPCOM\nGIVE ME THE FAME, THE MONEY, THE GLORY OF ARCADE EDITION
Except I as a day one player still have to grind endlessly to unlock all characters(or cave and pay up) while Arcade buyers get a code to unlock them right away. One step forward 2 steps back seems to be par for the course with Capcom these days.
i love street fighter
Nice games almost out of beta
Best fighting game e ver!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well I'm guessing I'm head to the arcade, cause tk7 arcade ass I'm huge tekken fan myself but come OK harada just 5 matches tk6 arcade was a lot better but he well learned, I bet sense ono put arcade in it harada going to compete well sure as hell love competition 
If the leaks are true, people who buy this will actually get bamboozled because they'll have to grind Fight Money to unlock the DLC characters instead of having them right away, a grind which of course (Capcom being Capcom) can be dodged by just buying the currency directly.
Yay another beta game being sold for $60
Hey look, more content that should've been a launch. Why are we excited again? Because it's free?
wait they're not making an xbox one version..........................\n.................,............................,\nFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
This game has been out for almost 2 years. Like it's great that it's getting a update, but street fighter 4 was a better game.
It's a *completely free* Update of a game that cost 18.99-$20 max in stores.\nTake that damn dislike off the video, Capcom did okay with this one.
Si no fuera por las noticias de el fedelobo no me entero habia olvidado que este juego existia la verdad
Finally, damn
so exiting over 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AT LAST! FUCK! %&$%#%$*%#(!^(#^ Slow CRAPCOM!
Finally
Fucking finally Jesus Christ

BOUT DAMN TIME, GOOD JOB CAPCOM
evil ryu bitches
Este mensaje va para Capcom,\nSi queréis que el juego triunfe y que sea un éxito en ventas, tenéis que añadir a la edición arcade el pase de temporada 3 y 4 también. Aparte, empezar el juego con todos los escenarios desbloqueados, y tener la posibilidad de desbloquear todos los trajes, incluidos los premium con el fight money. En resumidas cuentas, la gente que compre el Arcade Edition, que lo tenga todo sin tener que realizar ningún pago en el futuro, eso haría que yo mismo comprara esta nueva edición y eso que pagué los 70 Euros de Street Fighter V. Para que lo entendáis mejor, echar un vistazo al Battlefield 1 Revolution, que inlcuye todo el contenido y los próximos DLC's en un único pago,  39,95 Euros/Dólares.
Now we wait for Super street fighter V then Ultra Street fighter V and finally maximum over Street fighter V ultra arcade edition.....
Dear Capcom,\n\nIf you're gonna make Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition Awesome then ever, here's what you gotta do.\n\n1. Characters\nBlanka\nE. Honda\nSagat\nSakura\nDan\nGuy\nCody\nSodom\n\n2. I want Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition on the Xbox One. Because I don't own PS4. I really really REALLY want Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition on the Xbox One so bad.\n\nI just want to let you know I'm not telling what to do. I'm only asking you. It's for the fans.\n\nSincerely,\nAlec James Rathermel
still feels incomplete if you ask me
.... but there is no arcade cabinet
FUCK YOU CAPCOM , you dont give the dlc for people who've already played your unfinished game????
There's a misconception that's every is free. IT'S NOT.  For the people that bought the original SF5, you still have to pay for the season 1 and 2 DLC characters....that's not included in this update for you guys
I am going to post some short videos on Instagram (@ChrisFixit) answering some questions like if I was able to make a U-turn instead of a K-turn now. Also I am almost at 100k followers on Instagram so be sure to follow! Once I hit 100k I am doing a giveaway of ChrisFix swag with 7,000 winners!!!

This kid is so impressive, a real go-getter.
Hey Chris can u do a q&a. I think a lot of us got some questions for u including me
I just deleted the sway bars and bought negative offset rims.
My 2000 toyota corolla does an excellent job when it comes to turns, but my 2011 chevrolet impala sucks! I hate the chevrolet impala, plus I have to spend more on gas. I used to perpendicularly reverse park easily with the corolla, but now I have to turn before I perpendicularly reverse park with the impala. When I was driving the corolla I would wonder why do people turn before they park? I thought It was just because they're lazy (and that may be the case), but now I understand. They can't make sharp turns. Like my corolla could. I will say the Impala is a bit faster but every car has its advantages and disadvantages. I don't like impalas though. I would (and am going) to sell it for another car, a ws6 trans am.
Great job Chris !\ngreetings from Israel :)
Chris i have a old 4wd but it keeps over heating my 4wd is n dedicated rock crawler please show me how to install a electric radiator fan plz
there's a 99% chance I'll never do this to my car but I enjoy watching your videos
When the rack in my V6 2000 Mustang went out, I thought I was gonna be a little badass and buy myself an 04 Cobra terminator steering rack, and man lemme tell ya there went ALL my turning radius. Seriously considering this mod, since the bump stops in my 04 CObra rack are for much wider tires than stock 00 V6 tires and wheels
I think I fell in love with cars by watching your videos
He's making a wheel spacer/adapter video.  _YES_
When are you going to install the roll cage
Chris goes above and beyond to explain things in his videos, literally. The drone footage was a nice touch. Kudos mi amigo.
Can you drift next ep
Hey man.whats up ?I'm just one of your followers and I was wondering if you can help me with something.... today I was putting some brake fluid in my car but for accident I didn't read and it was the steering fluid... what I did was I took it out immediately with syringe and I took a little bit more that what put... it was just like 1 to 2 oz of steering fluid... my question do you think that's gonna cause any damage ?? I haven't use the car
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE YOUR VIDEO
How hard/easy is it to put new alloys on your car?
You should make a video on how to put a wrap
Hey Chris.. need a bit of an advise. I hear a clinking noise from the right front underneath my car. Have taken it to 3 shops and they all say they can't spot anything wrong and that the suspension is all good... What can I do next.. ? Any thoughts?
Is there something loose in the front end? At 2:08-2:10 when he is stopping the whole wheel shifts compared to the car. But in a side to side action...give the car the back to back movement when stopping.
Thanks Chris fix this helped my rx8 because the angle isn’t the best on it
Hey Chris! Would you happen to have a video on fixing a parking brake that's mounted down by the pedals? Like one that's in a 92 GMC Jimmy. If not, could you make a video on it? My Jimmy's parking brake lever is broken
Seriously need to do this on my K74 L200 😂
Chris, you are an absolute star, really I swear you have helped me through so much on my car, all the best!
Could you do a video, how to improve windows open/close. My get a little bit stuck while opening HELP :)
Was watching your video on gaining steering angle and noticed something. Former tire tech here in Ohio. L9ng story short, take a wire grinder to the back of your rims where they meet your wheel spacers, then have them rebalanced. That oxidation can cause a bad balance, and more importantly, can cause your lugnuts to loosen via vibrations. Alot of tire shops don't do it. We do alot of high value cars, aka bmw's, vette's, benz's, etc. We're the only tire shop for 3 hrs drive that most bring theirs in for us to work on. Just trying to help, faithful follower here!!!
More videos on the stang Chris!!! Pleeeeaaassseee!!!
Can you make a video of cleaning windows not the windshield
You're awesome Chris! No matter what the Junkie says, keep on keepin on! Cheers
You have probably the best channel for vehicle tutorials
auto transmission to Manuel conversion can you?
do a face reveal
when you said torque the wheel spacers to spec do you mean you tightened them to the same torque as the lug nuts were originally, or do the spacers come with their own torque spec?
can you make a video on how to stretch a tire
Chris do you still sell the chris fix shifter knob? I looked on your site and did not see them
I Love your videos! I installed new Brakes all by myself ...and they are working! Thanks to you ChrisFix! saved me alot of money! greetings from Germany!
You should make a video on how jack up a car and how to fix the common problems.
Do a video over supercharger on the driftstang!!!!!!!
Chris doesn't reply to my comments anymore :(
Do not do this if your car is front wheel drive or all wheel drive, because exceeding the designed angle limit of your CV joints is a good way to destroy them.
Has you're ford windstar had a recall?
I can tell you put a ton of work into this. It turned out great! Thanks for making this.
Can you do a face reveal?
Needs spacers in the rear too
Or you can make tighter turns by drifting.  Interesting though, I never knew about rack limiters.  Need to check for clearance with the suspension loaded though.
does a 2008 charger rt have these?
hey chris when are you going to start back up the drifting
For a future video would you ever show how to disassemble a truck? Because I’m getting this project truck and I don’t know how to to take stuff off a truck and change it. Like I’m getting everything from my local salvage yard body part wise. Like I don’t know how to remove a bed or tail gate or whatever.
Have you ever drove a 1998 Monte Carlo LS? And can you make a video on how to do a front end alignment?
Who else think he should put some new rims on this or a big wing
cant wait for new vid wondor if i can this to my 94 cougar with same motor as ur stang?
Chris fixes videos are just fun to watch even if you don't use what he is showing you
More videos more videos MORE VIDEOS
Awesome job!
Hi! what kind of gloves do you wear? Thancks.
liked for the visuals
So... no Soapy Wooder this time??
That's really cool to use the drone above your cul-de-sac
@ChrisFix - I'd be interested to know how the spacers would effect a truck, mainly 4 wheeling. Thanks
Go drift in a frozen lake its alot of fun trust me its just no grip at all and no matter if you spin out get someone to make you your own track
Hey Chris can you make a video of how to replace the backup lights switch on a manual transmission vehicle
Plenty of room\nLiterally like 3 hairs of clearance.
i just pull the ebrake to do sharp u turns much easier and quicker
I have a 2017 Nissan Maxima and I don't get such tight turns. I wish I knew how to find out how to get it done for my car.
Just woundering, Is it possible to have something to seperate the drivers from the passangers? it's aimed for uber and lyft drivers for their safety.
What about rack and pinion steering?
Where do you find bolt torque specs for your vehicle
Chris fix is a talented person 😐🔥
Man! My 81' montecarlo got a problem, when slowing down (even if I don't press de brakes) a weird sound comes out and it's driving me crazy. It sounds as a bus braking
This is just what I need for my triton mk (l200) turns like a logging truck. Hopefully I can go the cheap route
i would really love to see some diesel videos and I'm sure a lot more people would watch your videos too.
ChrisFix How can I troubleshoot and fix a whining noise coming from my engine only when the AC is running. The whining pitch increases higher as the rpm increases. For some background, I was driving and switched my AC to full blast. When I did that, something happened and zero air was blowing. For awhile, the “High” AC setting would not work. It works now tho but the noise persists. Any comment (or video) would be much appreciated!! Thanks!!
How would find, and fix a engine coolant leak?
Could you please make a video about how to convert a lock that requires a key (Not a remote thingy) to a lock that can be unlocked by a remote.
Still wondering how the hell he got that overhead shot
Clever mods Chris! This is the least money you can spend to increase the turning radius of your car. Drifters must love this mods! Very useful
Also, most importantly. Where did you get the angle kit?
Hey @ChrisFix, I'm curious why you didn't add spacers to the rear wheels as well.
you need spacers on the rears because you have a unbalanced wheel spacing. also you don't need to torque the nuts on the tires, you get them tight with the factory included tire iron and your foot
I love this guy..
Awesome as Always Chris. Hope all is well.
Hii friends can u help me to find the right jack stand for my 2013 suburban how manny tons jack stand good gor my suv
What is that sticking out of your front bumper on the Mustang?
Awesome vid...thank you so much for putting in all that extra time and overlay vids.  Top Shelf stuff!!!!
I've always wanted to know how to do at least a little on my own vehicles. I've never had anyone to teach me. I've watched every one of your videos the last 3 days and I really might go out and try something myself with what you've taught me. Thank you
why there is a tongue sticking out of your car ?!!
So now your front wheels stick out from the fenders, and your rear wheels are tucked in under the fenders. You put the spacers on the wrong wheels!
Your angle measure wasn't aligned with the wheel, cause you shouldn't have different angles whether you turn left or right. It wasn't 30 and 25 degrees, it was probably something like 27.5 and 27.5 degrees.
Chris you have not upload any video... please upload now!!!

DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It's written and directed by Woody Allen an alleged molester who married his stepdaughter. He is disgusting and I strongly advise you refrain from giving him money. The fact Amazon is parading around his name in the trailer is just wrong. Just don't.
Watch it because of Paulie Walnuts and Bobby Bacala, also Belushi as semi Tony Soprano.
Love me some Juno Temple. I dig that she’s recently been doing period pieces.
Somebody was watching The Toy just recently, lol.
hmm.. we at #woodyallenretro are somewhat skeptical but are keeping a open mind... has potential

You still got it woody Allen as sad Amazon studios is making more original stuff than Hollywood studios out there.
I would only see it if Woody Allen was crucified on the Wonder Wheel.
Visually nice but doesn’t seem all that great of a story to me.
Woody Allen and Bill Cosby are two men cut from the same cloth. Despicable creatures who should not be allowed to work
No Justin Noooo why'd you work with this creep? 🤦🏼‍♀️

Something sketching is going on with him
Why is this guy so defensive?? No one is accusing him of anything. He also seems very out of touch with reality. He showed no remorse or compassion for the victims and their families.
Reporters ask what do you say to the families..and he cuts her off and talks about how he's a good guy who helped his neighbor pull a tree of his house..wtf?...but this isn't about me..
The whole family is weirdos and should be executed !! I think they all got a little piece of the dad in them
He's a little off...
1st interview: I didn't know he had any guns.\n2nd interview: He tried those bump fire stocks and didn't like them.\n\n1st interview: Haven't spoken to him in a while. Don't know any details.\n2nd interview: He paid a bellhop $100 to lug all those bags of guns to his room.\n\nAnyone else get the feeling the brother is being deceptive and may have more knowledge than he cares to speak on?\nThe guy's a terrible liar. Should have had his lawyer speak for him. Even if he isn't, he sounds guilty of something he wants to hide. What a mess.
Who else thinks this guy is a psychopath just like his brother?
is it just me, or does anyone else feel hatred towards this man?
In vegas have security cameras everywhere, specially in the casinos, how come no body have any video of that guy going in the room, walking in the casino,  playing, eating, nothing?
Leave hem alone he don’t do anything wrong only he’s crazy brother
I feel so bad for this man. The media cornered him and he didn't have time to get a lawyer to help him first. The man clearly is just trying to be helpful while in complete shock. No one should judge.
he is as bad as his brother.
31:15 Wait a minute, pause...his mother's husband went to jail for robbing a bank with a machine gun? Ummmm...
12:54 “The first thing that comes to my mind was that she wasn’t gonna get shot when she was walking through the hotel, and the cops came in” -gunmans brother ... 🤔 hmm wasn’t there a press release & pictures of the gunmans wife’s plane surrounded by law enforcement the minute she landed in Vegas from the Philippines? ... kinda weird ..
Too many judgmental people here. This guy's brother just killed almost 60 people. This guy is freaked out and that's thats
Close your eyes and listen to him talk. He sounds like the dude kind of. Idk, just throwing that out there.
If there is no tumor in his head everyone is in trouble.
you guys really need to stop talking so poorly about him.. he’s obviously in shock of what his brother did. people grieve in different ways. i’m sure he’s grieving the losses of every life his brother took as well. there’s a million things going on in his head right now.\n\nyes, it’s disgusting what his brother did...his brother was a terrorist. but let him be. he’s human too.
The effects of drugs
Crying is not my normal gig
He said Steve said and then stopped himself right before describing what guns he used.   This guy needs a lawyer
This guy is a nut job as well. Wow
Sounds like an actor.
What a load of crap!!!
Mary anne my mom.... I mean mary lou.....  damn it they got me keep it going. I mean cmon u dont forget your mothers name
Steve did anything he wanted to do whenever he wanted to do.. and Shooting is the thing he wanted to do?
Good thing STEVE made a lot of money.  There are a crap load of people who will be getting it!!!!!!!
Watch Forensic acoustic proof of SECOND shooter in the Las Vegas massacre on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/JxmEFeKy8aI
People are saying it's all an act....  but come on guys imagine the emotional stress all this has put on him.  And he doesn't even have time to process this his own way.  He just gets constant bombardment
The FBI called and said you better say your brother acted alone
I hope they checked this dude to make sure he wasn't strapped before this.
Shock makes people act in ways that make no sense to anyone. But this guy is obviously high. He rambles like he’s on speed. He almost sounds like toward the end that this was a message. I wouldn’t be surprised if this knew everything. And to flaunt that he always knew how to be around people dumber than him so he never got caught, that was a pretty deliberate message and one that he is really feeling now
It went from an intelligent and professional response to an absolutely bizarre and ego driven self-interview about himself. He used a lot of I and Me statements when the questions were about the victims and the suspect. I hope he realizes, and no offense, but nobody cares about him.
My Analysis: He is trying to be helpful by describing the brother he once knew. In other words, he isn't denying that his brother did it. On the contrary, he was saying that his brother had the means to do all of it himself.\n\nLike everyone else, he doesn't understand what the motive was. He is trying to understand for himself. He has no answers, just like we don't have the answers.\n\nThere's footage of everything prior on the casino's cameras. They are investigating and I hope the will release more information. I'm sure they have a lot of data and can draw some conclusions.\n\nMy guess, is that his brother was on some medication prescribed a doctor. Sometimes these pills cause people to go crazy. Just listen to the side effects on these prescription drug commercials. For example, look at Chantix which they prescribe to people who want to quit smoking. Side effects include nightmares, delusion, depression, hallucinations, thoughts of suicide, paranoia, aggressive behavior, etc. This is for something they prescribe to people trying to quit smoking, imagine what they give to people with depression!\n\nIf that is true, I'm pretty sure these multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical companies wouldn't want that information to get out there. Just a theory.
Gawd is Eric weird or what? His conversations are all over the place and he cries with no tears. How does one do that?
It's not the bothers' fault . Another person is another person .
This guy is crazy
Did you hear him say no we didn't have guns as kids because my dad was a bank robber was in arm robbery with automatic weapons and just normal for mom to hate fully automatic weapons.   What??  Crazy h my mom hates guns because dad robs banks   what   no follow up questions
When will we run out of victims? All the best to all the Families. This man and his family are victims in their own way.
Says his brother never accepted any help for anything. Then immediately tells a story where his bro would make him get sandwiches instead of getting them himself. \n\nWtf?
I wish I was a detective.. I found found so many concerning things throughout this entire interview. I could go on, but I'll leave it at that and hope that the investigators catch it all.
This guy is doing nothing wrong hes in shocked and it isn't fake
Did anyone else see the snot come out his nose and then sniffed it back up...
My Theory: Vegas shooter motive was manipulating firearm manufacturer stock prices for someone he cared about to invest in ahead of time.
So nobody gonna say nothing about the cocain he sniffed back in his nose at 7:26
I think this guy should sit down, take 10 deep breaths and start the interview over. \n🤷🏻‍♀️
If brother doesn’t really know much then how does he know so well he acted alone? This is one the strangest things ever. It’s like these conspiracies are getting more obvious over time and less careless with facts. Only the naive fall for media and government lies at this point.
this guy is deluded cuz they got cash ur brother maimed and hurt a lot ov ppl if a was you a would be in hiding ppl can easily turn espically way the rambling your doing
He is such a bad actor... All this is so fake. I can't believe people believe this false flag.
He keeps saying steve gambled as a job. You cant make a living playing video poker thats complete nonsense. My guess Steve went on a massive hot streak a few years ago and this last year it went south fast.
This is an actor.
Sounds like Steve finally had to pay up for all the wealth he showered everyone with. And dude seems coached and very detached from actual emotion.
This guy should make a YouTube channel.
Idk. He seemed too eager to answer any questions that could arise from a conspiracy point of view...he didn’t seem to be shocked as in “Hey he wouldn’t do this”... It was more of a “Of course he would use a Tripod” & “He didn’t take all those guns up there himself he just has to pay a kid $100.00 to get them up there.” I mean it’s weird to say the least.
You guys are all calling him crazy and saying he was part of it , you can tell he is just tired of being interviewed. He is grieving too and and all that unwanted attention is probably what's driving him crazy . You can tell he's frustrated with all these people blaming him for what his brother did . He's just trying to get his point across , the way he is talking you can tell he just wants this to end and for them to leave him alone . Leave this poor man alone he has nothing to do with what his brother did .
You and your family are in my prayers, this is a difficult thing to go through especially after everything that had happen. God Bless You.
Can I say THERAPY! 😳👊🙏
This guys (his brother)  is responsible for the shooting. Im sorry I find his honesty a little bit on the sociopath side. He might be a little too smart for his own good.
This man is as honest as it can get
this is some very bad acting.
This guy is all messed up. Whats in his coffee? Scary family for sure.
He was constantly using the present-tense when referring to Steve, and sometimes correcting himself back to the past-tense. He also directly defends the major arguments against the official story, while going in and out of faked emotions and his voice cracking. I'd like to hear his voice from a year ago. He showed spurts of his normal voice, but most of his interviews are in his lying voice.
Weird dude.  I wonder if his mom will lose her house/$ when Feds freeze all\nAssets and trace his wealth to illegal activities.
Can’t even remember his moms name??
Wtf is with this guy?  He acts very odd.  And yes, I know he just lost his brother, but it's something else too.
Regardless of what people are saying about Eric Paddock, he still lost his brother, his blood, the man that helped raise him. I feel bad for him, his siblings and especially their mom. It’s not their fault their brother/son is a monster.
shooting on the 32nd floor....this guy's house number    ....320...STRANGE!!!
Its funny in the beginning when it looks like he is reaching out to grab the reporter asking him a question
he is nervous...keeps talking nonsense.  He needs to step away and collect himself before talking to the press..
Chris Elliot will be  a shoe in for this role when they make the hollywood movie (remake of the real fake event) in 2-3 years.
I'm an old fashioned guy?!??? Why is he talking so much?!??? He's a good actor people!!
Seems like he went over this speech over and over.
When he's talking about himself he's so whiny I can't stand it..
White dude would be from the San Fernando valley 818 crazy that’s where I’m from crazy from
I think he knew about the shooting before it happen
Looks like bad acting.\n\nAnd usually people in this position avoid publicity...
He got burnt out working the job he had at TACO BELL!!!
His brother was a terrorist and he seems to be talking highly about his brother. Lock him up just to make sure he doesn’t terrorize like his terrorist brother
Im not a tinfoil kind of guy , but this interview is weird A F .
18:08 And up is all about gun control .
His brother did not do it and if he did , it was Devils breath / scoplamine , cloak and dagger type of crap was done TO him.. PERIOD!!!!
Wasn’t fake
Cringingggg
Something kinda fishy here
32 floors up. Address 320
Wow - narcissistic much?
Cocaine!!
Monsters
7:26 tho
dan hit him
He's autistic
Homeboy needs a cat scan
Weird
He used drones!
3:40 forgot his mom name , said diffrent one can this be a fake?
If his brother had brain cancer and he did pay someone to take his bags/gus to the hotel room then he knws alot more than you think
At least there are 59 less animals too feed. Thanks too me I'm still alive you retards
HERE IS STEVE 👴🏻 .  STEVE NEVER TAKES HELP  .  EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO SANDWHICHES. \n\n\nEdit: this guy consistently contradicts his statements on who Steve was .  Is Steve the new bo Jackson?
Anti-Trumper
Oh my God at 14 minutes and 55 seconds is where he's getting ready to say his brother was an arms dealer but he cut himself off and tripped all over his sentences of Lies

Julie Andrews
Love this honest content. It's refreshing to see how someone handles the stress of internet based entrepreneurial business in reality. Especially in relation to how it can all affect your mental health. This was hands down the best vid. Great to see your efforts and progress and to hear your honest experience! #realest

Respect for Dina! Putting family first! Trust me best thing to do once everything goes you'll always have ur family to rely on nd they will support you
This time with your girl will go make the most of it
You do you and do what makes you happy. You don’t have to follow the crowd and your content is good enough as it is. I love you vlogs that involves your family rather than events and stuff.
feel like there is sth different in ur face. maybe the teeth 😒
Kids grow up so quick, so being with them while they are still little and still think you are the best person in world is more important, then suddenly before you blink, they are know it everything teenagers with stacks of attitude.\nAlthough mom guilt is normal, don't feel ever feel bad about putting your family first. :)
Sid is so funny especially when he pops in at the end of your videos also great video thanks for sharing peace
You made some great decisions. You do you boo!
Your teeth does age u a bit but still beautiful
Do what you want, simple :)
Good Dina, always put your family first, you won't get that time again with your daughter when she's already a grown up. Btw love the lashes, what mascara dear, looks good like wearing the one with fake lashes. OMG... That what every girl wishes for a good mascara !!!

You are amazing at what you do!!!! xx
okay but gurllll what mascara have you got on
Salam go check out my YouTube channel and enter my giveaway!!
I never really comment, but I really felt for you when I watched your video. I've got 4kiddies my eldest is 13 and youngest is 3, and mummguilt is something we all struggle with. At No matter what stage of life we are at. Just wanted to say Your doing an amazing job. Your great at what you do and it's a blessing to have a supportive husband and family around you. Whatever your doing is for your family as well. So take solace in that. Your videos are so genuine, nothing fake about what you do, which is why I love watching your Vlogs. You show the true side to you nothing made up with fairy dust over everything. Where everything is hunky dory in Lala land. Your show the good and bad (nothing too bad) and that's what life is. Do what your happy with. Regardless of what other people are doing. It doesn't matter. Good will come it's self. But it's only worth it as long as your happy xx sending love
I get it. I don't have a child so I don't have the mom guilt but I get the anxiety. It prevents me from doing so many of the things I really want to do. About the mom guilt I think it's really important to remember to sometimes put yourself first. I don't care what people say, you CAN have a career AND a loving family - especially when you have a husband that supports you. So good luck :) and hopefully one day our anxiety wont stop us from doing what we love.
Plz remove ur vineers they dont look good on u, u have good teeth and r pretty the way u r
Can you tell us more about your anxiety & how you cope with it? A lot of Muslim people don’t know how to deal with it. :/
why are you and Sid in back hoodie alot my sweet? new looks?? I love it! ill call it the bank robber look!
Thumbs up to you. Time with your daughter and family is more important than money. You can always make money but can never get time back.
Love the fact that Dina is one of the most normal people ever!!  Love it!!!
Alsalamu Alakuim Allah bless you and protect you.  Love your makeup and turban and black sweater. I want to meet and be your friend so much and love you sister. Your soo cute 💎💎💎💎😘😘😘😘
dina, do you feel part of your anxiety comes from being a Muslim woman? I remember your bafta vlog where you talked about how you had been treated at the afterparty and another event which was supposed to honor ALL women but you and your mother were the only ones having issues getting into the event, tho you had the invite and your ID....I’m sorry if that’s part of the reason and people make you feel that way cause of your religion. I’m not Muslim but I am black, I get the being the only one in the room mentality.
nawww your a great mom tbh, and yes I feel like this when I dont spent time with my siblings/parents forget even the guilt of having a child. Dina your awesome, and hana is super lucky to have such a humble and warm mom like you. Love watching you
Good for you gal!! Do you!! If I could stay at home and spend more time with my little one, I sooo would. Maybe one day Insha'Allah...anyway stay happy and sane! 😊
Hi Dina it's very understandable. The opportunities are good but just do you. Hannah will grow up and you won't get the time back so it is ok for you to find a balance that works for you. Please do what you feel good doing and don't stress too much. Also so happy that you will be doing stuff with your sister so you won't be too lonely. ☺️
properly because this is not the right way maybe you don't know so I am just saying and any non muslims who don't know anything about Muslim I don't want any of your reply thanks 🙏🏼
R E A L T A L K ❤️
I think you're just an introvert and get naturally tired after extending yourself too much, there is nothing wrong with that
Absolutely love how brutally honest you are.
Where's the makeup tutorials
The fact that you feel guilty shows how much you care. Hana has such an amazing mother who thrives to make a better change in society. Well done and you deserve a break! We are all human 🌹
You see so many hijabi you tubers begging it to become famous now days so they jump to the opportunity for abit of lime light for this dunya. Dina on the other hand has always remained grounded and raw when it comes to YouTube that’s why no one will ever top her in this game. My fave Muslim YouTuber you are amazing at what you do & a great mom. 💕
Anxiety is a bitch isn’t it. Fair play though if you don’t enjoy them as much for whatever reason. Define your own success you’re doing amazing <3
Your makeup looks awesome, do you mind sharing what you're wearing (specifically foundation and lip stick)? Thanks :)
Your make up is stunning today
Everyday and family-related content is much more interesting than any fashion week :)
Sid coming at the end hahahahaha
Aa fuck that Dina, fashion week is so boring anyways
Do not feel bad! Mom guilt is normal, but never feel bad about wanting to be with your baby. Enjoy it when you can and when your not enjoy your you time. Knowing your limit and keeping balance is life... were all trying to keep it in check. Your a good mom & blogger!! You got best of both worlds. 😍
Love that you and Sid has black hoodies on. In time for the All black game. :)
Dina I never knew you had anxiety... Thank you for being so open ... I def get the mummy guilt I am the same with events especially with several in a week. Hey you can always go with me.... Just saying 💛
I know exactly how you feel. Anxiety can be a bitch but who doesn't love being comfortable
i like ur language dina
not to take away from the message of the video, but I love your brows dark!
Thank you for this video. It just shows how real you are, how everyone is fighting their own battles and that no one has it easy. I hope you achieve even greater success in life inshaAllah. Hopefully things will get easier once Hanna grows older. And who knows, she can be your ultimate company to these events :)
Wow ur so honest ...
What mascara do you use your eyelashes look bomb girl 😍
This is 100% relatable.
Dina, Don’t mistake what uv been made to believe is ‘anxiety’ or ‘Mum guilt’ with what is in-fact u fighting against ur natural fitrah as a woman.\n The things u mentioned that u feel are because of the way Allah designed women to be. U will always revert back to ur natural fitrah no matter how much u try to fight it. Society has made a name for  these feelings and called them ‘anxiety’ so that u stop there and don’t look into deeper meanings as to why u feel the way u do. So u don’t look to religion and Allah for guidance. U just say I suffer with anxiety. In fact u don’t. It’s just an internal battle with ur innate feelings as woman to want to be at home with her family where Allah prescribed for is the best place. And to be modest and conservative in every way which is why u find these events so uncomfortable sometimes. \nUr not meant to find it comfortable to be around inappropriately dressed people, alcohol, music. So in fact what ur feeling is complete NORMAL and what isn’t normal is what ur doing and trying to convince urself is a problem with urself called anxiety. Don’t fight ur fitrah. What Allah designed u as. U will never find true happiness that way. Go with what Allah has prescribed for u and only then will u  taste the true sweetness of happiness. \n\nI’m not one to leave comments ever, but I saw this short clip and felt compelled to say something. I get how u feel coz I was in the same position few years ago. Feelings I couldn’t quite explain. An uncomfortable feeling being in certain places. It’s because it’s not what Allah has prescribed for us as women. \nAnd By the Way men face the same battles with ‘anxiety’ as they go against their natural fitrah too. By becoming less protective towards their women. Society has completely changed the roles to make it that men who accept their wives free mixing and dressing inappropriately are viewed as confident in themselves and those who find it uncomfortable for their women to be speaking to non mahrams as insecure men. But no. Men should feel a natural jealousy and protectiveness over their women. Be it their mother wife sister or daughter. When they fight that, they also have these ‘feelings’ that  they can’t explain and name them anxiety. They feel frustrated and can’t explain it. \n\nI hope this didn’t read too bluntly but that’s how text can be sometimes. Compared to actually speaking about stuff. \n\nAnyway I just wanted to help u with the way ur feeling. I know exactly what it feels like and I am now free of that. Alhumdulilah. TabarakAllah. Happiest Iv ever been. \n\nAs Muslims we’ve been given the gift of knowing what’s to come and if we truly claim this to be certainty then how can we justify the actions we knw r wrong to be ok.. what will u say to Allah when ur standing infront of him.. that’s the question that changed my life. What will I say to my creator..? What will be a good enough reason..? I wasn’t ready? I tried my best? Not good enough. \n\nHope U read this and it helps in some way  inshallah. At the moment Allah has kept some form of guilt in ur heart when u do something u knw isn’t right, don’t let that small portion be taken away from u. Act upon it before it’s taken away. It’s not too late. U have a daughter who will lead by ur example. True love means wanting jannah for those we love x

Sorry its not in spanish for you spanish speaking people.
Estoy 100% seguro  q el comentarista es chileno
I think Chile can make it to at least the semi finals in the world cup.
Me da gracia, hay mas perucas que propios Chilenos, como siempre pendiente de su padre.
jejejjeje ese es mi chile el bicampeon del mundo
Me pareció bueno que Chile gane. Pero ni Ecuador  ni Chile recuperan su nivel.\nMe pareció un poco pobre el partido.
Las clasificatorias sudamericanas sin duda las mejores del planeta.
Chile great team... we wanna see it in Rusia!
Chile gano sufriendo , gracias a ese defensa bruto de Ecuador q se resbalo😡😡, y colombia estaba celebrando y burlándose de otros y ahora esta en riesgo lol, estas eliminatorias sudamericanas ya nadie es local , cualquier cosa puede pasar en cualquier minuto , solo se respira cuando el arbitro diga Fin
soy peruano y trabajo en Chile hace cuatro años ...quiero a mi pais y quiero ver a la roja en el mundial ...viva chile carajo !
Jajaja Brasil los va hacer mierda!!!
que me hacen reir los chilependientes
Alexis Sanchez is there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He was the fox
Go Chile, from England!
Difícil estas eliminatorias, esto se putio porq ganó Paraguay, chilenos diciendo q ya clasificaron. Acaso no ven que se van a enfrentar a Brasil, selección que jamás a perdido en eliminatorias  y que está hecho una máquina para jugar al fútbol? Argentinos, ir a ganar en la altura de Ecuador? Colombianos y peruanos que partido más duro, y paraguayos, acaso no han visto los últimos tres partidos de Venezuela? Esto está jodido
Que chileno tan rico cuando se saca el polo. Que cuerpaso ,
espero que chile no juegue sucio  porque ya lo hicieron antes en BRASIL https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maracanazo_de_la_selecci%C3%B3n_chilena\n\nЯ надеюсь, что чили не играют грязной, потому что они уже делали это раньше в БРАЗИЛИИ
Jajaaj Chileindios ahora a perder contra Brasil jajaja!!
Grande el Mago Valdivia! el ultimo 10 clasico de Chile...  ojala y nuestra seleccion Colombia pudiera tener a Macnelly Torres para esta fecha, Dios quiera que Colombia y chile clasifiquen pero para poder ver al Mago y a Macnelly en el mundial. Saludos señores amantes del buen futbol
ese hijo de puta del arquero bravo no la ve ni cuadrada...tirelen pijas gringas al negro ese van a ver como las ataja todas con la jeta ..jejje
Ese ecuatoriano quería cancherear jajajajaja GOL CTM
GO GO Chile!!
Q maricones los chilenos así noma meten gol
todos aca me chupan el pene especialmente messi jajajajaj
Hasta paraguay les gana
Argentina y Chile quedaran fuera. Firmalo.
Fixed match
Chileno hijo de puta raz asquerosa
spasibo loco
estaban sufriendo
Que asco con ecuador como regala ese segundo gol así , se nota que querían favorecer a los rotos por que Perú los dejó fuera del mundial
3 cupos para 5 equipos,esta claro que CHILE es el que la tiene mas dificil ya que jugamos con brasil,paraguay es el que la tiene mas facil pero veremos muy pronto de que estamos echos,peruanos muy agrandados por que le empataron a argentina cuando le ganen 2 finales consecutivas hablamos...
Brasil Uruguay Perú Paraguay Argentina.Despúes no digan que no avise.Chi chi chi le le le lo mira por la tele!!! Por las dudas soy uruguayo.
K lastima k no hay carteles en ecuador
El 2do gol de Chile : Cerca a su área, un defensa ecuatoriano está en posesión del balón, un delantero chileno lo empuja, hace caer al defensa, el árbitro no cobra infracción, y se generó el gol chileno
Vamos Paraguay carajo!!
ECUADOR 1  - CHILINDIOS MARICAS LAMEHUEVOS  DE LOS INGLESES   2
Volvió esa mierda de valdivia, bueno en fin la mayoría son una mierda: jara, arturo, medel, etc
SI NO QUIEREN QUE TANTO NOS OCUPEMOS DE USTEDES, PORQUERÍAS, SIMPLEMENTE NO TROLEEN NI COMENTEN HUEVADAS EN VIDEOS PERUANOS, NO PIDAN DEMASIADO, PORQUE IGUAL VAMOS A SEGUIR JODIENDOLES MIENTRAS NOS SIGA DANDO LA PUTA GANA, VAMOS PERÚ CARAJO, EL CAMINO A RUSIA TOTALMENTE DESPEJADO, CARAJO!!!!
es gracioso ver a peruano chilenos y ecuatorianos llamando se monos entre sí \na jajajaja todos son monos!!
Chileno que no le gusta la pinga no es chileno :V
Chilenos el martes lleven su bacelina q brasil se las va a meter doblada rotos hijos de perras :) ! Peru y argentina en el mundial fuera chilenos indios :)
error del back ecuatoriano
Esperaba mas de esa seleccion pero la victoria que han tenido contra ecuador,no fue tan merecido,ya que sus dos goles fueeron regaladas por los defensas ecuatorianas .....veremos con brazil ahora!!!
Pobre Chile, Brasil lo va a violar en casa
cholo, deja de estar pendiente de tu padre, entro a ver los goles de Chile y solo veo a cholos picotas comentando
Les regalaron el partido a los chilenos.
uds creen que brasil les regalara algo o se dejara ganar o empatar , brasil se perfila como primera potencia futbolistica y quiere recuperar eso . mucho menos quiere cerrar con derrota en su propia casa que ingenuos. ya fueron chilenos.
Es increíble como los peruanos culiaos andan mas preocupados de Chile que de su mierda de selección jajajaj
TODO ESTAMIS IGUALADOS POR UN PUNTO CADA UNO EL MARTES SE JUEGA SU FINAL ASI DE SIMPLE. AQUI YA NO ESTAN LAS MATEMATIKAS ETC.. EL MARTES ES UN PARTIDO PARA CADA SELECCION SU PASE ALA FINAL..
Por la culpa de quinteros no pasamos al mundial:( pero ahora ay que pensar en catar
ROTOS Y LA REPUTA QUE LOS PARIO...
SOLO EL CHILENO EN EL SEGUNDO GOL NO LO MARCÓ NADIE Y SEGUNDOS ANTES OTRO CHILENO HABÍA HECHO FALTA
Waa genial ver como muestran estos partidos en Europa y en Rusia en especial
se viene un partido difisil que es brasil
3:15 que emocionante el relato😭😭 claramente lo dise hdjndidjdjdbĢuiűű§😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hello Neymar tengo lubricante para el martes
4:05 \n*voz de Homero*\nEs que es mi primer dia!
Me gusta como otros paises le tienen miedo a chile y ven los videos y todo, siempre atentos a los superiores
estos peruanos que llegan solitos a humillarse, les gusta decir que Brazil nos va hacer mierda, les gusta escuchar eso por que su selección nunca lo hará xDd
NADA MAS CON ESTOS TRAIDORES DE ECUADOR!!
Es tan malo ese gueon de bravo
Ke inocentes estos de ecu! No te pueden meter 2 goles robandole la pelota al defensor!!
una cancha que parece un patatal pero no es culpa de la gran seleccion chilena, es el Estadio Nacional y sus putos conciertos de Guns n Roses y Def Leppard, una pesima pesima organizacion.  Coordinacion mediocre.
El arquero se entregó en el primer gol
chicos pasen por mi canal, tengo videos interesantes que les pueden servir como bajar sin límites por mega, hackear wifi , juegos y otros trucos y programas , saludos
increible como lo perdio ecuador,estamos meados por un dinosaurio
puta que son feo los chilenos weon, la cagó XD
Ecuador se puede ir con la frente muy en alto si elimina a Argentina del mundial.Sera recordado por los Argentinos eternamente.
Ahora con Brasil moriremos peleando hasta el final. Muy buena eliminatoria.
rotitos por los ingleses para
Puta madre! Renovaron Ecuador completamente y si mejoro el ataque pero la defensa de antes se tiene que quedar. Necesitamos Ayovi, Erazo, Mina, y Ramírez. A chillier también está bueno en Mexico
POR FAVOR UN EMPATE EN BRASIL Y DESPUÉS QUE SE VALLA pizzi Y LLEGUE PELLEGRINI
tanta gente insultando a los países vecinos y creyéndose el cuento de que pueden “predecir” de que uno le ganará al otro...en serio digo , no se pueden calentar por un juego...que inmadurez más impresionante , pero bueno , de mal en peor van todos . Que gane el equipo que mejor juegue , ya fue .
Brasil en tus manos encomendamos nuestros espíritus(Colombia,Peru,Argentina,Paraguay)
Jajaja lo bueno q Brasil de local no a perdido ni cagando perderá con los chiliindios.\nVa mejorando el idioma chiliindio entendi al comentarista cuando dijo ecuatoria jajaja
Buen partido, saludos de Perú
vidal hijo de puta sige diciendo que por culpa de los que juegan en mexico la seleccion esta mal por eso vargas t mando a callar!! pendejo
Super Duper Bonus TurnOver Bulanan hingga 60juta lebih  hanya di JPS POKER
Brasil le ganarà, y Paraguay ganarà a Venezuela, adiós chilindios juar juar
SOY CHILENO ME ENCANTA EL PERRO AL HORNO Y LOS BRASILEÑOS NOS VAN A DAR UNA MANO POR QUE NO LES GUSTAN LOS ARGENTINOS  PERO NADIE  ME  QUIERE SOLO POR QUE ME ADUEÑO DE SUS COMIDAS Y SUS TRAGOS  OJO COMPRO ARBITROS Y DIGO QUE SOY EL CAMPEON DE AMERICA
Chilenos hijos de puta
Dicen que Chile perdera ante Brasil, nunca hablen despues de tiempo. O quedaran como Argentina, decian que les iban a ganar a Chile 3, 4 a 0 a Chile en la Copa America 2015 y 2016 y que paso? Nunca subestimen a NADIE
Que se siente que ningún país de tu continente te quiera ... Afuera chile
Like si crees que este partido estaba actuado como juegan los ecuaterianos....???? este partido está comprado por chile...observen a los de ecuador cuando chile tiene la pelota..
en el segundo gol de Chile fue falta, empujo al defensa.
Sanchez hijo de tu puta madre mal parido d..... menos mal que Brasil les ARA mierda 😹
Mala suerte para los chilenos😡😡😡xd
Pinches chilenos roban siempre cabranes los partidos pero brasil los hara mierda
CHILENO MAL PARIDO HIJO DE PERRA FEOS HDP NO IRAN AO MUNDIAL BRASIL LES METERA PINGA CON SALIVA BRASIL 6 CHILE GAY 0
si le hubiesemos ganado a paraguay de local o ha bolivia de visita estariamos clasificados.😑
Espero que el pueblo chileno se haya dado cuenta que este partido fue comprado... basta con ver el error del defensor ecuatoriano seguido de la marca del resto de los defensores ecuatorianos que se quedaron mirando al linea pidiendo offside
su primer gol de chile acepto pero el segundo no no saben jugar pasaron no se lo llevaron mierda maricones asieron trampa con uruguayo
Buena come perros.
235 COMEPERROS LES GUSTA ESTO :V
Que sospechoso ese segundo gol
si ganamos en brasil   meo en todas la banderas de america puta , si perdemos cago en las misma puta
si a Perú también le regalaron tres puntos
Juegan con el arbitro a su favor, así cualquiera gana :v
para todos los putos que dijieron que ya estabamos eliminados chupenla jajajajjja aparecio el campeon de america hijos de puta a tragarse sus palabras jajajajaja
I'm feeling pretty constipated
1 time a day is to much for me lol
Why did I want to know this
the harappan civilization was the first civilization to invent and use flush toilet...\nuse missed the fact @infographics
We all all know if your on the toilet for 10 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaco Bell is the blame
A good amount of people are watching this on the toilet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop watching this video and wipe already, you're gonna get a numb leg.
I'm pooping right now!
I'm watching this while taking a crap👍
I've seen squat toilets when searching videos, it's pretty weird looking.
The way you say poop is amazing...
Dam I don't feel to to poop when there is an anaconda in the toilet
I once used the squat toilet in Kenya. easy for pooping and uncomfortable for the knees
I spend like 5 hours a day in the bathroom
u running out of ideas boi
Never Thought This Vid Would Come Out 0-0
I live in South Africa 🇿🇦
Who's watching this in the toilet...
Oh no I clogged the toilet
i watch this while i'm pooping😱
Have you ever ate a cheeseburger while taking a dump?
I just dropped the kids off at he pool
Why...............
this video is very shitty
Drop the kids off at the pool xD
Actually the Squat toilet is available and used in Iraq.
so you mean that girls poop too? D:\n\n\n\n\noh wait, they are also humans, my mum lied to me...
Perfect i am shiting right now
Why did I clicked on this video
I feel disgusted 🤢 I wonder why and I watching wait what am I doing with my life 🤔 Ehh This is my opinion I'm not hating on this but Let's Just finish this video.
I was going to make a joke but it’s kinda crappy.
The videos require a lot of work, I'm surprised that the channel promises a 3 videos a week now!
I am watching this video as im pooping! XD!
What, who drinks 8 cups of water a day? 4 is fine unless you're working out. Or unless they count the water you take from food, than I would understand. But no needs to drink that much water a day.
Does anyone know what software they use to make the infographics?
Too much fun with the 30 second intro
Why am İ watching this?
Sorry to be “that guy”, but I think that last fact of how many litres over your lifetime is off by a factor of 1000. 51,000,000 litres divided by the number of days in 80 years (around 26,000) is still 2000 litres. I think you meant 2000 millilitres?
That's definitely not average weight
I honestly don't go in with my phone or newspaper when I go in the bathroom because it doesn't take long to come out. Why do people do this?
Please do  if NASA had a 1 trillion dollar budget 
I’ve always pooped once a day, always in the morning. But I took a biology class at my community college, and was totally shamed by everyone telling me they poop after every meal. (That’s why restaurants are required to have restrooms.)
Are you ALREADY running out of ideas?????
What a crappy video\n\n\n\nNot really only for a joke
Yo do a vid on North Korea vs China
Wow u make great content i really enjoy watching ur vids u earned a subscriber!

I poo about 5-7 times a day as i have ibs and ibd 💩👌
You've clearly​ never met a 100 lb girl who likes Chipotle 💩💣
Why is this in my recomended? And it is in the Entertainment Section ._.
Dahell? poop once a day? im more like once a week.
We had sit down toilets until 2012
The Infographics Show can u make a video of differences in American and European food... i  mean why US food is so trash packed with chemicals and EU food is better ? :)
Now we are asking real questions.
Think about it. In the future the kids will be even more depressed and stressed because they will have to learn more history. Because things that happen after we go to school....and they will have to study it.

Now that I've been eating healthier I've been pooping 3'xs a day. It's literally impossible to gain weight!
Who else is picking up their shit and eating it?
We brits dont call that a toilet roll.\nToilet roll and toilet paper are synonymous.

Dogshit turns white when left out in the sun.
💩I just laid down the law.

I haven’t watched this yet. But after knowing what the Michele Obama one was.  I don’t think I’ll live after this video. (Dying of laughter of course)
Ellen: Picks up cucumber\nOprah: What are you doing with those?\nEllen: (Shrugs with big smile)\nI'm done!!! lmfao
Omg I hAve coupons oh my God I love Ellen so much I am laughing so hard right now 2017 10:43 p.m. Chicago it's my city
I’m pretty sure Oprah was faking getting scared by the plastic skulls
When Ellen scared opera at the cashier with the skull, Andy was behind them and got scared more 😂😂
Is Ellen #TeamAndroid?
What gets me, is all those people holding up their phones. Obviously there is a camera crew and it will be on youtube, ellentube, and national TV.  They'd already have a video copy.  Take  a picture or 2 and then put your damn phone down and enjoy their little show there!   And now all you people have phones covering your faces, so no one can see you were there now anyways!
I wanna see Beyoncé doing this 😂😂
3:57 i absolutely adore how the mother covers her daughter's eyes from the Tugboats magazine😂😂❤️ and THAT is education 🙈💕💕
i laughed so hard when ellen ask what size of zucchini should she get.
This was posted on my birthday!!
Oprah is so out of touch. Its a product of circumstance I suppose - she used to be so relatable .
Ellen is so crazy😭 no doubt.
I love Ellen and Oprah.
Only Ellen can make Oprah do that. Lolz
I couldn't stop laughing Ellen is hilarious & that lady & her daughter are so lucky to have gone home with Ellen & Oprah
Got an add with Ellen in it.
Ellen: Which one do you want\nOprah: this one is too big \nOprah: and this one is too small\nEllen: 😂😂😂\nMe: Dammn Oprah she has a specific size 🤣😂
This was too funny!!
So Ellen is being funny when she makes Oprah look like a clown using melons to degrade her, but that's funny! Smh! But then Cam makes an unintentional statement that was deemed offensive too many women, but no woman is offended by Ellen's behavior! Typical! As long as women do things to each other it's ok like constantly referring to each other as the B-word! I'm appalled by the hypocrisy. Using a cucumber to make fun about a male size and how to use it! All of this is so-called cute when they do it! So pathetic! Then Ellen using a mic to embarrass and degrade Oprah making it appear fun. This is so offensive, and not funny at all.
I wish I could say the last time I went to a grocery store was years ago 🙄
The sad part is that you know those peaches all got bought that day!
I love those ladies 😊
What brain dead considers this entertainment ?? A racist and a dyke shopping...REALLY !! I guess this caters to the TV crowd or clueless libtards . When is Oprah going to do a special on the Blacks who owned slaves in the NORTH after slavery was abolished ??....crickets
How did I even get here I don't even WATCH this channel!
😂😂😂😂they look like they had fun
I would love to go shopping with Ellen
When was the last time you were in a grocery store? I cant imagine what life is like for celebs, what do they do off camera...that said, these 2 are hilarious together
I love Ellen. She is so funny!
i love Elen and Opra they're funny as hell
i dont think i could handle so much fail in one store
Did they not know tiffany?
I love Oprah but she is trying too hard to beat Mitchell Obama hang out with Ellen coz that was absolutely amazing
*Brings a big bag*\n\n*gets food*\n\n*puts the groceries in the bag without paying the money*\n\n😂👌🏼
hahaha! This is amazing! Two frickin awesome woman! Love this! I wanna meet them both!!
Oprah hair is so pretty!!  I mean gorgeous Even!!
Omg so funny you are both God bless our souls
They are so funny together
Ellen and Jake Paul are are honestly the craziest people when it comes to Stores and shoppin😂😂
Was Ellen named Ellen? Or, was she named Hellen and decided to drop the r?
When that kid just stared at Oprah when Oprah said just drink it
Lol, 3:55, the lady covered her daughter's eyes 😂😂
This guy is rich
This is going to be the inspiration for my next video. Crazy
I feel like these grocery store videos are just Ellen and her friends showing off how rich and entitled they are.
I was on Oprah when I was a baby.
Plot twist, Oprah comes out as gay to Ellen on Ellen's show.
Ellen is so irritating she isn't funny now repetitive
Which one is bigger?
Fakest scare ever
two queens
OPRAH'S DANDRUFF SHAMPOO
Look at Ellen firiend at 16.00 or 06.00
So funny
lovvvvee it 😂😂

When they were holding up the magazine of Ellen the mom in background was covering her daughters eyes
0:50 is me shopping with my nan 😂
I almost died of laughs!!! Awesome clip.
way faint economist laser stop other thought whatever lack space bend.
Even the store workers are filming. hahaha
Oprah and Ellen should make a tv show together
Peaches everyone. Oprah's touched the them! So true Ellen
Notice Andy in the background at 03:15 when Ellen scares Oprah and he is like scared FOR Oprah HAHAHAHA
maaan i just wish i meet Oprah and Ellen before i die
Hmm Ellen isn't funny in this clip, she's just annoying.
who are these people?  youtube u r drunk (again)
Economic taxpayer second body extremely kiss sport Asian hot in.
Is it weird that i ship them
I love both but for some reason, I found them a bit obnoxious in this video...
Ok, so a bull and a dyke walk into a china shop...
Are they both drunk? 😂😂😂 it looks so fun!!!
WTF! How old are these people? This would be something we did in HIGH SCHOOL! Time to grow up people. These two should be laughing and carrying on with their GRAND CHILDREN for Christ's sake. Dispicable 🖕
Ellen seems so fun to hang out with!
Oprah' s product placement ruined this a little for me. 😕😒
It’s never too big.
Omfg the lady with the brussel sprout is MY ENGLISH TEACHER AHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Who's Oprah and Ellen?
That looked like a lot of fun shopping with you two. thanks for sharing.
Ellen is so childish and I love that 😂😂😂
It's oprah and white oprah
I wonder if the Ellen show could help me find my biological family I was adopted at birth and I always wanted to meet my real mother
3:55 good mum :D
Oprah is actually thicccccccccc 😂😂😂
3:16  LOL ANDY ALSO GOT SCARED HAHAHAHAHA

Thanks for posting Paty InStyle-Decor Luxury Lifestyle http://instyle-decor.com Beverly Hills
Wow! That estee lauder box looks amazing!
Become super Beautiful \nhttps://youtu.be/Kuyz4jlA8HI🐼🐻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐻🐼
Fleur😍😍😍😍😍
SERIOUSLY NEED THE NEW TARTE PALETTE😍😍😍😍🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
You are looking beautiful Fleur!
i  ordered the cancer box .. and i never got it..they even took my money.. :(
lol be these videos Fleur!! ❤️
These vids are my fave x
Okay, am I the only one that that when she was talking about the Clinique Pep-Start range actually thought she was saying Pet-Start?? 😂 I was thrown off for a sec ( why the heck would Clinique be starting a pet range??). Maybe just me, yeah? We shall see.....😂  BTW your videos are consistently great Fleur stay fabulous! ❤️
Have u tried Bobbi Brown Eye Opening Mascara, suuuuper volume n long lasting! Wovzers was so impressed x x x
Really interested in seeing a review of that Lancôme stick foundation!
So is this the old formula? And it's only available in the USA? It's a little different name, SPF 21, and shade range is different from the U.K.  I wear 110 in the one available in the USA but that's a shade too dark. Here is the link to the USA one I'm referring to (please someone let me know if this is different from the new UK release!!). https://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/teint-idole-ultra-longwear-foundation-stick/3605971343964.html
looking really glowy Fleur! Pregnancy looks great on you:) X
I’m not a girl but I wear makeup and I like acting like a girl! Awesome video and I love the tarte palette!
Loved this video Fleur, you look absolutely glowing, pregnancy is really suiting you! I can't wait to get my hands on those serums! xx
Hi Fleur.. Love your makeup look in this video.. Do a tutorial maybe? :)
Your under eye concealer has looked very cakey in your last few videos - what is it? 😳
Clinique skincare is a hit IF you find the right product for your skin type. I have super dry skin (not dehydrated) and Moisture Surge Intense Skin Fortifying Hydrator for a moisturizer and All About Eyes Rich or Repairwear Anti-Gravity Eye Lift Cream for the eye area are my favorite skincare products that I've tried from the brand. I like the Dermalogica balm cleanser 10x more than Clinique's since it's in a tube and it doesn't make my vision insanely blurry like Clinique's does when I take off my eye makeup. There have been some definite misses in Clinique for me as well but the Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief is my ride or die moisturizer for when my skin is at its absolute driest and tightest so I would highly suggest that if you have dry/dry combo/very dry skin.
have been expecting for this video for so long!!! love your new launches video Fleur!
Ahhh I love your reviews! You’re quick, honest and hilarious. Excited about the ouai spray and that toasted palette- I love tarte.
Did you know the Estee box is sold out?
Could we have a best candles / Reed diffusers video. Not the Xmas candles, just a general one. Thanks
love the video - as always!! :)\nwhat about the new hourglass holiday palette? you didn't mention it in september either..
You look great in this video Fleur!!! Thanks for bringing me up to date! Lancome stick foundation seems great! Would love a more thorough review on it!
Aw, the beauty box isn't sold in the US, but all the other Estee Lauder companies pink products are :(
Remember when trying these new products out Fleur, that you are taking prenatal vitamins which are full of so much nourishment. That can contribute to your hair being so wonderful right now. Happened to me darn it.
Shut up Zoe’s friend.
That Tarte palette looks so frickin' amazing! Please do a tutorial on it x x
Hi Fleur! Since it's breast cancer awareness month, I would really love to see what you think of MÊME cosmetics, which are supposed to be formulated for women who are fighting cancer!
The Estée Lauder box is still in stock on the Clinique website!
Wow I want to try all of it! And you know me and my obsession with Tarte! ❤️Lol 😆
Always love these videos! Where are your earings from Fleur? They're lovely
your voice is the best i have ever listened to :-)
I was so happy when I discovered the Ordinary! I cannot afford fancy serums but I swear the Ordinary serums have seriously changed my skin!
Gutted to have missed out on that Breast Cancer box!!
I have yet to try The Ordinary, but the serums look promising. These overview videos are really so helpful!
Always wanted to try some Ouai products! I love the sound of them and the package is gorgeous! Definitely going to pick up some of the new ordinary stuff! I'm obsessed xox
Fleur- what are your thoughts on the new Charlotte Tilburry pallet?
Hi There Guys! This Is Awesome! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 $𝟚𝟝𝟘 𝕀𝕥𝕦𝕟𝕖𝕤 ℂ𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Claimanygiftcardfrofree
that tarte palette looks amazing! I'll have to check it out, it does look more wearable than the naked heat palette
Hope you can make a Drugstore Makeup 💄 video next. All ur videos are mostly high street and high end. 😔 thanks!
Your face is radiant as usual, Fleur. Can't wait to see how the baby will look like. It's going to have a face like a flower or like the sun. Cute!
Are you using all products during pregnancy? Or have you changed anything in your routine?
The ester lauder box is already sold out. Boo!
Well that's my Christmas list sorted! Thanks FleurB. Hope you're well x
Your hair looks incredible, I definitely need to try those Ouai products!
Your videos are ALWAYS informative and fantastic!!!  P.S. Pregnancy looks great on you!! XOX
Hi Fleur, today in France, we're celebrating everyone named Fleur so happy name's day , happy Fleur's day 🎉😘 tc !
What nail polish are you wearing? 😍
Hi Fleur I really enjoyed the October update so many interesting new things. I'd love to know which of the Ouai shampoos you used and enjoyed I was about to take the plunge. Also I had read about the smoothing product you mentioned but haven't been able to find in the UK so thrilled it may now be available.
Hi fleur are you wearing maternity wear? Could you do a video on maternity wear?
Smashbox has sold out of the charity boxes on your link but Bobby Brown still has some in stock :-)
This is my favorite series of yours!
Love your top ooh new products
Your hair in this video is amazing!!!!
that brown sparkly shade in the tarte palette STRESSES ME OUT hahahah IMAGINE THE FALL OUT
The toasted looks amazing and supporting a good cause, I always love
I never realised you still made YT videos! I’ve missed them; I used to watch you way back in the day! Hey girl!
Hi Fleur, what did you think of the new Chanel perfume- Gabrielle? X
I love what you're wearing Fleur! Where is it from and can you get it non maternity? It's so cute 😊 Love your videos and hope you're enjoying your pregnancy. Can't wait for #babydeforce
You look so beautiful you are glowing 🤗😍
Love that box for breast cancer! Great idea. Another great video, Fleur :)
Love these videos Fleur, really respect your opinion and appreciate work you put in to research and try all these products out x
Fleur whats wrong with your undereye concealer, it doesnt look as good as always. Have you used another one ?
some nice looking products there
Love watching an intelligent woman with good vocabulary playing with beautiful frivolous stuff  I'm 36 and get a headache from the omg babes channels lol .. I love that you try enough of the things to give an opinion rather than just a basic show what's out xxx
Love these types of videos! Do you have any recommendations for liquid eye liner? I’m on the hunt for something new because my favourite one has been discontinued. Also, waterproof would be an amazing plus ❤️
So happy to see your video Fleur! I am in love with the Tartlette palette and the Erborian mask I'll definitely look into. (Before this vid, here I was trying to whittle down my makeup stash for some while 😂)
Love it all and you are lovely! xoxo
Love these 'new i beauty' videos☺️
Awesome idea for the breast cancer box 💕and looking forward to trying the new Ordinary serums!
Lovely choices as always, Fleur. :) Hope you're feeling well ; before you know it your Favorite Beautiful Lead Item of All Time will be ... *Baby DeForce.* :D
I am so sad the toasted palette isn’t out yet 😩 it looks amazing
I'm not loving that UD mascara either.  The Perversion mascara is one of my favorite from them, though!
The tarte palette is so beautiful😭
I am definitely going to pick up the Tarte  palette. Curious about the Eborian mask since I enjoy their BB cream. The bubble mask looks fun! What would you compare the Clinique  overnight lip balm to? Oh my gosh! Nooo replica! I adore their fragrances & I don't need to because they are pricy but that one sounds good. Beach Walk is my all time favorite scent. It's pretty much been my signature scent for the past couple of years. Hope you're having a lovely week. Hugs, Summer xo
I'm so excited and ready for the tarteltte toasted pallete 😍😍😍
i have to look for that beauty box for breast cancer, that's nice! i will look for and try the clinique double bubble mask is available in the US for $24.50
My favourite and what I look forward to most are your Vlogtober and Vlogmas vlogs. I, of course, totally understand why you are not doing them but I am still a little heartbroken. Hopefully next year.
Gutted that the breast cancer beauty box is sold out. Is it a one off or do they come back in stock?
no shops in the UK stocks tarte make up !!!;( if anyone things i'm wrong and know the place pleat let me know!!!!) there is one place like a pharmacy and let's say for tarte eyeshadow palette charges like 149 pounds!!!????🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🙄
Urghhh the breast cancer box is sold out. My mum just finished treatment a few months ago and would have loved it! Hoping they'll restock
Wear us your top from?!
It's a shame that the Estee Lauder box sold out in minutes! Would have liked one....
The tarte palette looks so good but idk where to buy it from in the uk
Does Tarte ship to the UK ? Or how else can we get this palette?
Are you a male to female transgender? Born a man?
Love your hair Fleur. The new growth looks so heathy and shiny. Natural color looks so flattering.
did anybody misunderstand fleur saying sweat proof as 'sex proof'??
Your explanation of hair memory :) haha.
Loved this new-in-beauty video as always!  You always give great reviews/first impressions
Hi Fleur! Question! Where/How do you get Tarte in the UK?! Thanks for answering love! ❤
I love videos about people's BELONGINGS and ROOMS and SPACES. It is the most fascinating thing what everyone has, what connections people have to the things they own and how they arrange them. What crumpled receipts people have in their bags, and their favourite cuddly toys, and the things they keep as mementos. The things they can't throw away and the things that remind them of, say, 2007 specifically. The colours and light flow and the arrangement of furniture in people's rooms. How people organise the same stuff in a thousand different ways. What we consider necessary, or a part of our identity, or a tangible expression of some facet of ourselves. Anyway I want you to know that I own 20 plastic frogs.
I am a camera, I didn’t want to learn this truth
YOURS WILL SOON BE NOT AS NICE
Dan. I would hands down date you. Like no joke.
Dan I can watch you do anything and love it, literally when I feel down I binge watch your videos and it immediately makes me feel better because you're so honest in every video, I love it ❤️
I mean you have 4 suits that you have worn so talk about being an adult 🤗
Not to be captain obvious but you take your dry cleaning to the dry cleaners.
Yeh but is it even a Daniel J Layton video without the Harry Potter books in frame???
Does anybody really know what dry cleaning is? A good place to go for dry cleaning is Timpsons, and they might be able to fix boots as well. Kill two birds with one stone. Potentially three birds with one stone, because there are Timpson branches at some supermarkets like Sainsbury's and Morrisons, so you can do food shopping as well.
this is one of my favourite “series” i guess idk i love the two videos you’ve made about this it helps so much.
Please make more of these. Mainly because I love the way you pronounce stuff.
Not knowing what dry cleaning is--too real.
Dry cleaning is a process of soaking in a chemical solvent rather than water. It's for fabrics that would degrade in water, or for pieces that are too delicate for a washing machine.
HAHAHAH the Janet posters even in ur uni halls.\nYou already knew who you were. I'm proud.
I have just cleaned the three mugs from my room. And I now have a clothes bench at the end of my bed. I will never really be an adult.
Well done for getting this far in it! (This is genuine and not sarcastic btw)
I do this thing where I allow my room to get messier and messier and messier as my mind seems to do the same thing. Then when I've had enough of how messy my mind and my room is (usually when I can't walk around anymore and I am very angry) I will go through and clean everything. It is the most calming thing. It is a safe way to deal with anger, and I feel better inside and out. It's quite lovely.
I utterly understand everything said in this video, and its nice to know as an 18 year old female that people other than me enjoy cleaning...but where is the room tour tho.
Will you make a video of you building your desk like you did with dodie?
I do the same thing when I’m cleaning/tidying I’ll either put on headphones and listen to non lyrical music or YouTube videos (depending on my mood) and when it’s YouTube videos it definitely something to just listen to in the background and have a voice I can check in with at times, it’s SO nice and cathartic and I get to laugh if things are funny or just listen to someone go through their day/topic and it’s makes me feel accomplished and stuff, agreed. It’s great
I love this video! I clean my room late at night and listening to music and watch tv or movies, I love your videos and I relate to the stuff you talk about, I am Fan of your bakingwithlayton videos there amazing and I also love to bake.
having a film 'keeping you company' whilst cleaning is the best description i have ever heard - i do this at least 3 times a week (but normally with reruns of community or rick and morty)
Did... did Dan go to Canada recently? He really didn't mention it much if he did ;)
My Mum asked me to take a dress to the dry cleaner once and was perplexed about why I seemed so stressed out by what seemed to her, a simple task. I had to go to the city, talk to the lady I mean... what do I ask for? Can I just be like, here's a dress do your thing? How much does it cost? Can I pick it up that day? That week? Whats the deal?\n\nIt's funny because I only did it that once and it was so stressful it was all kind of a blur so if I ever needs to do that again I'm back to square one I've got no idea.
where is your closet from? it is exacly what i've been looking for
But you forgot about room tour!!!
Ask google to find you a decent dry cleaners. You haul your stuff to them they work their magic and then you get it back clean pressed and on hangers. If you want your stuff starched make sure to ask. I liked a really stiff chefs coat back in the day. Like turn it sideways and it doesn't budge. I'd ask for hot press and triple starch. Then I wouldn't have to iron it as hard to keep that nice line. It shouldn't be too expensive either. I mean less than $20ish per suit. Usually they can do it super fast too.
M8 where are your fairy lights from? 😂. The really important question
Stoff
Hm... with all of the stuff you still have, I'm not sure I'm convinced that you ever actually got rid of anything. Lol. Dan, at this rate you are going to end up on that show hoarders!
You're so right about spending all your money moving that you have none to actually decorate. I found this out when I moved to edinburgh and ended up buying two leather recliner sofas for £50 in total. They look like shit, but are comfy as hell. I also bought a wardrobe and chest of drawers for £40 in total as they were ex display. It is these kind of moments when I realise that I am truly an adult.
I moved in august, the bedroom is a disaster (the rest isn't much better but that isn't my point). Soon very soon there will be bought another closet for the bedroom, so at least 40 % of the floor will reappear from under bags of towels, table cloths and bedding stuff - I hope.\nVedo is nice, I have missed these short interactions, like back in the old days where you challenges yourself to do a video every week :)
3:29 babe you could never turn me off.\n\n\nhahaha.\n\n\n\nlol.
Wow, I'm fairly confident that me and Dan shared the same student halls... and I can confirm they really are great!
OMG Tell me if you have figgured out the Dry Cleaning! I have a dedicated place in my bathroom where I hang my dresses for weddings... and they stay there, I buy new ones. I love the old ones... they need dry cleaning.... I don't even??? I am good at grown-up stuff (thats half a brag right there!) but Dry Cleaning is an actual mystery...
Wall of memes i love it
Dry cleaning is cleaning using regulated and toxic chemicals instead of water and its so expensive its not economical for anyone to have a private dry cleaning setup which is why you need to go to a storefront for it. Also water will shrink suit fabric which is why you need to do that.\n\nJust google dry cleaner near me, bring your suits, and maybe ask how much its gonna be and how long its gonna take.
I am moving house at the the moment, so I can feel this video really well.
You should do some film recommendations 😻
I relate to this so much. I started uni 2 months ago and I'm still decorating my room!
Were you in Lincoln courts because that's where I am right now.
LEGIT HAVING THE EXACT SAME ADULT PROBLEMS. I have a coat and a dress that need to be drycleaned, plus a pair of boots that desperately need a fix. So please update us on when and how you solve these issues.
Your VEDO is my favorite VEDO, I could honestly listen to you talk about anything.
Been in my place for 11 years now.   Still not done.
This video was the perfect length for me to watch while I took off my make up. So THANKS DAN!
So excited for your vid on my birthday (25th october, pls give me a shoutout am too excited <3 )
I moved to uni a few weeks ago, and it took me about 3 days to put my polaroids up in my room. And oh mY GoD did it make a difference. Literally 15 tiny little photos from holidays, SitC, parties etc made my room instantly feel more like home. Today we printed a load of flat photos and hung them in our kitchen/dining area. It's crazy how much difference a few photos and fairy lights make
In the time between when I was 11 to 18 I moved house 9 times. The thing that mad my room my room was all my posters and drawings. Every house they moved with me and made it the new place a home.
As a kid I used to love going to the dry cleaners with my mum/dad. The front desk was at a level above my head but it had a sort of ledge on it that was child level. I thought they were the best place caus they remembered that little kids like to see the top of a front desks too. I was a very easy child to please 😁
Okay a little tip for the drycleaning suits. IT'S expensive. This is something a lot of professional instrumentalists do. They wait until it's really cold out, like freezing overnight and they just put their suits outside to get the smell of sweat out of their suits. Apparently this is supposed to work, don't ask me how, I'm a girl, but I've heard this so many times by different people. It's worth a try.
Talking about things being familiar and comforting, sitting in a new uni flat and just hearing your outtro makes me feel so much more comfortable in my own skin. Thanks for the video today Dan :)
Lucky, my uni doesn't allow me to hang pictures or posters on the wall, not even with Blu Tack. However, there's a huge corkboard along the wall, so my grandad undid a couple of the screws and that's where my pictures hang instead.
I started uni about a week ago and this helped me a lot :) thanks Dan
I legit want to do a big tidy now... I suppose that is procrastinating as I have SO many essays due in
This spoke to me. I feel like I am in exactly the same place as you. I love the chill clean up time!
Go to the dry cleaners for your suits And the cobbler for your boot.
‘How do you amass glasses in such a fashion’ *stares disappointedly at the piles of glasses and clothes scattered all over my war zone of a room*
I have your videos to keep me company while I'm doing my evening routine. :-)
clothes on clothes on clothes on clothes...... on a *chair* \n\nnever thought I'd relate so much <3
Lovely vid Dan, hope you're settling in well! I really enjoy your I'm just a normal person doing normal things with a sarcastic yet hopeful British attitude brand. It makes me feel like I'm not the only one, you know?
I love you Daniel J. Layton!! Xxx
I love that you guys live so close it really is like you're living in the Friends building because you have your friends close 😊
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR
I love when YouTubers make videos of them just talking about life and doing everyday tasks like in Dodie's vid where she makes pasta and talks about her love life or now when Dan is just cleaning his room. It feels so personal and I feel at ease and so comfortable in this one sided conversation.
1:05 i now have defying gravity stuck in my head cheers daniel j
i cleared so much shit out of my childhood bedroom a couple of months ago and dear god CATHARSIS
Literally just stopped everything I was doing to watch this video I love all your videos Dan but these are my favourite just listening to you rambling is in a way comforting just feels like we are two friends hanging out and just talking xx
The not feeling settled and 'at home' until you've decorated it to make it your own personal safe space is SO TRUE. You discussed it in your August PMS too and all of the chaos of my mental state suddenly made sense: I recently moved to a new city for a year long work placement.. I'm living with people I barely know who know each other better, I'm away from friends who in the past two years of uni have become like family, and as a result am missing my beloved family more so than previous years away from home. We can't decorate our rooms, so I have large expanses of white walls surrounding me and whenever I'm in my room I never felt quite fully relaxed.. It's not MY space, it's no ones space and as such it feels like I've in turn rented my brain out to so many feelings that I can't nail down and think through freely. Thank you Dan for helping that fall into place, your videos are one thing that does feel homely (if that can be not a weird choice of word) and calm my racing brain xx
I have exactly zero suits, and I also do not know what dry cleaning is ;) sorcery!
I do the same but instead of tidy because effort, I alphabetise my dvd collection and when I say collection I mean I could single handily re open blockbusters
I'm just moved and THANK YOU. My house is like almost there now at about 2 months after the move in date.
@daniel J. Layton Can we start a patrion to get you money to buy a bookshelf because the books just sitting in the corners are killing me.
That was my room then I moved out from my parents and left it all because it didn't fit in my suitcase
I love your videos you are an inspiration <3
i love videos like this :))
free shirt when you're buying a suit
SUHNday
Your hope framing and focusing makes me feel relaxed
9:25 min How Do Dry Cleaners Clean Clothing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhlVfHMidZU :)
Omg I love your Harry Potter poster 💛
Lol dan is adorable
I'm enjoying you VEDO immensely! ^_^
Stoff stoff stoff stoff stoff
YES DAN
STOFF
Relatable
bit echo-y innit. still great tho. still great.
That Janet Jackson poster though
Yay, i got the first like.i love you're videos thank you for them i was just in a really bad place, exxellent timing\nDry cleaning is getting a person at a laundromat to do it
Wow I actually want to tidy now, thank you Dan I am going to tidy now
Even though I'm literally a teenager right now, I'm already pretty house-proud and 'Monica'. I have two things on my desk right now - both anthologies for uni - and then there is nothing else messy in my room.
SPOTLESS
It takes a talent to entertain people with the bare minimum. I mean, i've just watched 4 miutes of you folding clothes and it ended too soon. Looking forward to tomorrow's vid :)
Your gonna laugh but British Heart Foundation is great to cheap furniture.
Really not a fan of wire hangers. Hate to break it to you.
I am sitting in my uni room as a first year with the exact same Friends poster on my wall. Love that
Cleaning has become my relaxing thing as well, whenever my mental health gets a bit shaky and I feel like I can't achieve anything, I just do a bit of cleaning so I know I've got something done, it's lovely!
Cleaning is  so calming sometimes and I agree, cleaning with something like a movie playing in the background is so cathartic
I clean my room to procrastinate then procrastinate cleaning my room :/
I'm a hoarder too, I keep leaves and rocks and things, mostly paper from school... it's clogging up my room. there is stuff everywhere in my room... I am probably, sadly the 'typical teenager' who just hoards plastic bottles. plus I love your poster... 😁
Why is Chris dressed up as a Witch?
He's taking after his mother.
Everytime I watch this it makes my day lol
HA HA HA HA HA! You fucking LOSER guy! Go kill yourself!
Just... Watching this again, my god, I don't think he's ever been this upset. Hilarious to watch with how deranged he is and the fluctuating pitch of his voice. \n\nStill, I stand by what I said earlier. He's never been this unhinged after a breakup before. Deteriorating vocabulary aside, you can't fake this kind of crazy. He really is genuinely upset. He really thought he had a good thing going here for real. If he wasn't so funny to listen to and watch here, I'd almost feel sorry for him.
God..I think Chris is ready for the asylum.
Okay, around 0:11 I can only understand at least half of what he's saying. It's like he has the hysterics dialed up so high the knob came loose. \nEdit: Nevermind, I found the transcript on the CWCki.
Chris could you please learn some yard sale logic? You can't just sell so many games and toys for any price over $5 or $10, if it's too expensive no one will buy it.
OUR MASTERS GIVE US A CURSE-HAME-HA , WE ARE'T PURE ENOUGH TO RECEIVE SUCH A GIFT FOR  MASTER.
He sounds like a woman who just learned the man she thought was her child's father, wasn't the father at all.
If there's one thing cartoons have taught me, it's that curses by crazy-sounding old women are serious business.
To think this was a guy.\nAnd autistic.\nMight be a good explanation for this... Video?
Chris sounds like he's jizzing for simply stretching his arms out to the camera.
he literally looks like an old lady screaming
This is the Chris Chan we all know and-\n\nThis is the Chris Chan we all know!
Is it a man or a woman? He or she sounds like this crazy lady from the westboro baptist church!
Bad acting Christine, not worth the oscar
y'know sometimes i genuinely feel bad for CWC\n(s)he just doesnt know what this looks like to everyone else\n\nlike, sometimes you have a daydream where you suddenly get everything you've ever wanted and never have to do anything ever again. i know i've done that -- like what if you rubbed a fuckin lamp, a genie came out and suddenly you just had everything? that'd be great.\n\nthe difference between CWC and us is that we snap out of it and realize it's a dream.
Give this it an award
When is the apology video for the curse coming do you think?
This just reminds me of Brian's mother in Life of Brian.
Was that supposed to be his best Marlin Brando impression?
Ah Chris Chan. It's nice to know that you haven't changed.
0:55 He said 'Sofa King'.
Is this an enemy stand?
Is he just blaming us for something that probably had nothing to do with us
The bear has awoken from slumber.
Lol, I hope this is the beginning of the old yard raging Chris, this DUDE is funny!
Would you do me? I'd do me
Cuz I'm not afraid to SHAHOW MY FANGZ
How did his voice get so high? what happend to the autistic casual voice we came to love?
chris his fault that he should never reveal to his sweet jessica
Anyone know what happened to the CWCki? The website has been down for a while, and now I don't know how to catch up on all of my Chris Chan related news. Can anyone point me in the direction of a new place to hear about his/her exploits?
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN \nWHEN WILL YOU LEARN THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES
0:23 He turned into sammyclassicsonicfan for a second.
0:59 - I do believe that might just be the last shred of Chris's sanity breaking there folks
Can somebody add subtitles? I can't make out half of this...
Hope we can see a happy Christine for a long period of time.
M8, get a hold of your life. Probably move. I suggest you go move to the arctic circle.
Chris is ageing like a fine wine.
this is the worst ronnie james dio song ever.
I wouldn't be surprised if he shat his pants again like did when sparing w/ Clyde Cash and Billy Mays on IRL. Dirty, Crapped, Briefs Part 2.
This does not even deserve a captains log introduction, *Takes glasses off* BECAUSE THIS IS DEAD SERIOUS
sometimes when I feel like a no hoper I remember that people like this exist somewhere
Look's like classic  Chris is back ROFL.
Well I have a feeling that the trolls are returning
This reminds me of that Monty Python sketch that takes place in Happy Valley. You sound just like King Otto playing the Hammond Organ.
You don't need her. You're the creator of Sonichu for crying out loud. Who did she think she was to boss you around?
Holy crap, I found a new video to terrify those kids for Halloween! Thanks for the wicked witch video, dude!
Seeing as I'm not superstitious or a total fool I'm not at all moved by your melodramatic attempt at cursing others.\n\nYou have to either be spectacularly naive or incredibly thick to think that such a childish display will put fear into anyone seeing as this sort of nonsense hasn't been in fashion since about 1400,
If I had 100 million dollars I would give Chris a million. But then again he would just spend it all on toys and mcdonalds in the first week and then ask for donations for a storage unit to put his new toys in and claim he needs even more money for food and Barb's atkins books.
What's with his eye?
Honestly, it seems as if Chris is the one getting the last laugh. People keep asking why he keeps feeding the trolls, but then again, trolls are the only form of social interaction he can achieve. The trolls are only giving him the attention he desires.
0:53\n\nChris Chan was Sofa King: confirmed.
I'm starting to think this guy might be retarded.
Sounds just like Sonny the Cocoa Puffs bird
10 out of 10 performance, Shaman Chris
This was disturbing to say the least.\nIs this the new Wizard Of Oz Movie? The portrayal of The Wicked Witch  is... interesting.
I wonder if he realizes that this is all his fault this happened...probably not.
He was SOFA KING WRONG!!!!
One of my dreams is to kick Chris Chan really hard in the nuts and see how he reacts.
A Saga ends\nA Story begins
Anyone else reminded of I.M. Meen?
This is your brain on autism.
IMMMMM MELLLLLTTTTTTIIIINNNNGGGGG
Get help
Aaand we have classic Chris Chan saga material.   Awesome
Am.....am I watching a pantomime??

Hopefully you get an aneurysm soon .

Whats happening now? Can somebody fill me in?
Why doesn't CWC ever use a comb??
it makes me borderline depressed to think i'd probably just take one for the team and take his virginity
I just had a thought. Is it possible that Chris has been playing a character all these years and we're actually the fools for believing it? What if Chris is the ultimate troll...that would make him a genius.
still has the same fucking music.
Why won't someone kill this retard already?
I remember that part of the movie
I can't get over how amazing you two look together! I think you're soul sisters 😁

I didn't know Chucky was a lip-pouter.
And that will suck All the dick greatest phrase ever. stealing it.
You earned my VOTES! I didn't know we could vote multiple times! And ticket prices are amazing it quoted me $44.75 that was on the site.
You already KNOW I love this shit. Buttttttt, as a girl new to SFX AND WHAT NOT I would love to know which editing software you use for your intro and videos!!! \n\nXoxo Love ya betch
Hey Mama Hanz!🤗 This is my 3rd Hanzoween and I LOVE your work! Its so detailed and you always learn something by the end! I think your looks using sfx like your Jigsaw and mummy are sooo amazing but can you also do lots of looks that use just body paint? I absolutely love watching you create such deatailed and dimmentional looks with just different paints! Its truly a joy to watch and to learn from you! I soooo look forward to the rest of Hanzoween! Its my favorite time of year on YouTube!!! XOXO💜😘
This is such a great partner look I love it omg
Seriously, think you two could be sisters. I, at first, during the intro, was like, hmmm, which one is Jordan....then I'm like...duh, Chucky....Jordan is Chucky.
I don't know why, but black lipstick is sexy af
I'm so happy to have watched the two of you together :) The two of you are amazing to watch absolutely amazing artists and can't wait to see if you both collab agin through out the month of hanzoween..... :)
Literally thought Jordan was Jaclyn Hill in the thumb nail! 😬
The Lady who played Chucky looks more like Tiffany tho lol
There aren’t enough thumbs on YouTube for how much I like this video
Jordan looks like a scary but somehow still pretty Jennifer Lawrence 😂 and Kristi is a bad ass as always
I loved this video😍😍😍😍
how do you not have more subscribers?? i’ve honestly never seen a more talented artist 😍
Chuckys scars are on the wrong side XD
😂😂😂 love you girlssss
You make Chuckie look pretty af. #hanzfam \nCan't wait for more collabs with you and Kristy. Y'all did great. And the red hair looks awesome on you.
Is the pros aide cream essential and also how is the alcone 3rd degree going over your brow, do you cover the jar to protect it? Thank you, hoping to recreate for Halloween! 🎃 💗 👻 p.s. love you and your videos you're AMAZING!!
Love tge attention to detail!
Aw, Rawbeautykristi is teeny tiny - or are you tall Jordan? Love your collabs! :) x
Im curious about your lip piercing.. I want one it's so cute! Does it hurt? Is it in the way? Did it hurt to do it? How was the healing time? What kind of jewellery have you in it?
Bishhhhh I’m shook!
Some advice for the freckles: dont mix eyeshadow with water ! The water will evaporate and leave powder which will move around and be dirty looking. (Trust me, i learned the hard way). Use a mixing liquid or setting spray instead.
He's kind of a warm ass bitch lmao, please do more collabs!! :-D
I HAVE to try this for Halloween this year. Like I'm in love with your take on it. Whenever you were searching for the on Amazon what did you search? Because I've searched red/orange wigs and I they're all like waaaay to red or way to orange
7:22 Está bien,  está muy  bien ¿Y saben porqué está bien? porque Ecuador no reventó la pelota, quisieron salir jugando, cuando se dieron cuenta Chile ya había adelantado a todo el batallón 😂😂😂

Weekend Woman debuted at #12 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGuUAtJ8yMM&index=12&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5
This song is more Beach Boys than Beach Boys
I like how all four of these songs sound different from each other, and yet, they are all awesome songs. I'm sure this will become one of Weezer's best albums.
I was there when they played this live and it was awesome
Argentina is still waiting for Weezer!! =w=
Feels Like Summer, Mexican Fender, Weekend Woman = YES, GOOD.\nBeach Boys = *no*
Weekend Woman is much more complete, as Burning Sun lacks a proper chorus, a middle-eight, or decent lyrics... but I can't help but feel that the verse melody goes much better with Burning Sun's propulsive, rocky arrangement than with Weekend Woman's slower, more sedate arrangement.\n\nStill, Weekend Woman is great, and it's interesting to see a song that originated in 2001 evolve into something totally different for its eventual release 16 years later. (For all Weezer's faults, they're a great band to follow if you're interested in the songwriting process.)
This better get some radio play
I LOVE THIS TRACK!
Been listening to this song on repeat while I'm studying.
Suddenly the sounds of the 60s bump my mind because of the tune of this song <3.
Sounds like a generic Gin Blossoms song from the mid 90's
where's my hash pipe?
This song gets better with every listen. Can't get enough of it.
I stopped listening since after Maladroit... I think I might listen again :)
Judging by that bridge, this is the song that should have been called Beach Boys.
really love the new songs
Oh God this is my favorite off the album so far!!
Oh wow burning sun done over. Good song. This album has a nice rhythmic sound.
Much, much better than the previous 3 singles. Still scared for this album.
Wonderful verse, weak chorus and OK bridge.  6/10   I'd rather listen to the Green demo than this unfortunately.
This has a modern yet classic 60s pop sound. Between this and Weezer's recent use of the 50s chord progression in Go Away and Endless Bummer, they are bringing back great things. This really reminds me of Weezer combined with The Monkees new song She Makes Me Laugh (written by Rivers, of course.) Buying the new album at release.
Weezer is probably my favorite active band. I've really liked the past 2 albums and the first 2 releases from the new album are good just not as good as most of their past work. This song however sucks.
Best single they've released for the new album by far
this is actually good
Really good. I'm enjoying the change, especially from the White album.
Must be a big album
Not a bad track... the more I think about one of my top 10 Weezer tracks, “Eulogy for a Rock Band,” the more I think it’s about them and leaving rock music behind 😢
Melody sounds like it was lifted from an earlier B-side called Burning Sun.
I'm a Weezer fan..went on first Weezer cruise..this song is pretty lame..most of the recent releases have been lyrically pretty crappy..almost like Rivers lost his edge for writing good pop singles. The alliteration is great.
what a good song
he sounds like the dude that sang rude
still stucky in my head
Not 1 single mention of Mary Tyler Moore. Disappointed
sorry, but in my opinion this is not good...
I swear, when I first saw the title, I thought it was showing Wonder Woman, anyways, great song!
This is a really good song!
This video made me fart.
This is the only song I like off Pacific Daydream but still lower the Pop taste just a but please.
thought I was looking at the ocean man album cover from a distance
Best single so far.
is weezer going to hit the trifecta of 3 good albums in a row...\nman i dunno if i'm ready for this
The melody/harmonies and the arrangements are just beautiful <3
These new songs aren't bad. Not my jam though. This one is actually really good compared to the others though.
Use more vocal melodies and songs Rivers wrote from the 90s and we'll talk.
Best single from this album so far imo
For me this makes 4 great summer jams on this album so far. Very happy with how this is turning out.
Nice one!  \nSpecialy when this began: I still believe your beautiful lies
yes, if you're trying to figure out that youtube is an algorithm based on previous video views and snapshots of thumbnails, yes, it is true.
I feel like nobody brings up how creative these lyric videos are!
Much better than burning sun imo, this takes everything good from burning sun and enhances it, burning sun has the same problem that all Green songs have (i critique green for being solid but extremely safe and the songs follow a generic and identical formula)
Best song you guys have released so far! Love it!
dig the song! here's a brief write-up I did about it https://zumic.com/weekend-woman-weezer-youtube-audio-single
Amazing to think that Rivers has been holding onto a melody this good for so long, unable to finish it until now. And now we've ended up with one of the absolute best modern Weezer tracks, with new lyrics and an incredible arrangement. I'm glad it's finally finished and out there, because this song is excellent.
Finally we got a good one
I miss Weezer so much. Will they ever come back, or is fluffy beach stuff all they're going to churn out now?
*My personal rankings so far*\n1. Feels Like Summer\n2. Mexican Fender\n3. Weekend Woman\n4. Beach Boys
O c t o b e r 2 7 t h
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD
New Weezer, Liam and Noel Gallagher album! What a time to be aline 💕
Sounds very 80s prom to me lol
Thinkyouknowmusic on Twitter brought me here.
good one.
The bridge gives me chills =w=
Genius
2 3 la rola
los amo, hijosdeputa!
stop
meh
Always late
I love it! <3
weezer manda mtoooo!!!!
Is gud
Thats a tune!
The Shins sound great!
4.07 minutes of happiness
Burning sun anyone?? B sides little bitches.
love weezer always
Booo make weezer suck again!
no
Damn.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Good job, Weezer!
Good
Burning Sun from Green Era almost exaclty.
Weezer is one of the best bands ever, with some of the worst fans ever.  So negative, always picking apart every note of every song, forever comparing everything they do to Blue or Pinkerton.  Where's the loyalty?  Where's the love?  Honestly, the worst Weezer song is better than nearly every song that gets played on the radio.  Stop complaining and give Weezer the credit they deserve.
<3
This is Burning Sun remade, cool
Burning SUN!!!!!
When did Weezer become another lifeless pop act?
is the Black Album, Pacific Daydream? Or is this just a separate Album?
Even the B sides off the white album are better than this. Missing the rock sound.
Sigh. More overproduced pop rock from a beloved band with which I grew up. What happened? No band will always remain the same, but WHAT IS THIS?!? Where is the authenticity of Pinkerton? Where are the harder riffs?
Wish there was just more fuzzy guitars and less church bells and reverb. 🙄
More and more bullshit. Just retired already Weezer, you haven't had a decent album in 11 years!
SOUNDS LIKE BURNING SUN!
This is a great Weez tune. Has a White vibe and Green vibe. Ranking high on my Weezer overplay list. The previous 3 were flimsy. This one's strong. 
Good
Meh
Can't believe people are disliking this song just because it's included in the MLP Movie OST. Damn you guys, at least show some mercy lol.
When is he gonna make a video of any of his album songs. Well, his other songs that he didn't do yet. (Obviously)
Whoaaa, first time i heard this song i thought it was old, it sounds wayy older than it actually is. Can't believe it's a new song lmao! Love the classic feel to it.
IT'S EASY M'KAY
Best movie I've ever seen

I'm surprised this song is in that movie
Love it. Pony power!
YEEEESSS I FOUND ITT SINCE AUGUST THIS YEAR\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (im fan boying so much now)
Finally, a Lukas Graham song that doesn't reek of ego and actually sounds decent.
Whether it be a MLP song, I haven't heard Lukas' voice in a while 😞👌. Keep that talent up 👍🔥
Who is here before 1 mill
Out of all in the Movie this one really stuck to me, anyone else?
I LOVE THIS SONG
The song that played in the trailers and TV spots.
I JUST FINISHED THIS MOVIE! Lol
was a great song to end the movie
Why do I love this *so* much
A lyrics on my channel to this song, plz check out https://youtu.be/8vqaIjZ6KHM
I've been waiting. It hasn't been in the album till now. \n\nWorth the wait!
Lukas Your song is on the movie!? 😉
An ok song, but it's not old Lukas, it's too much pop, not enough original Lukas. But still the best voice in the world
Just the movie today, it was SO AWESOME!\n#MyLittlePonyMovie\nMy only real complaint was during the pirate introduction, there wasn't really any background other than how they used to be.\nOther than that, one of the greatest ever made by mankind! (Or ponykind, or bronykind... whatever you prefer).
YEAAAAAA I LOVE THIS SONG
I just got back from watching the movie! AND I LOVE IT EVEN MORE THAN BEFORE!!! And may I just say Capper is one SEXY CAT!!!!!
I love you guys
My children are a gift- TO ME!\n- Todd in the Shadows, 2k16
This song doesn't take advantage of his incredible voice. He tries too hard in this song to appeal to the gen pop, so...meh.
wow finally a new song and its great
This song makes me want to drop everything and travel the world. ;w;
IDEC ITS FROM MY LITTLE PONY *I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!*

Does this mean Lukas is a brony?
good song but why is there so bad quality sound but in movie not? sound is distorted here.?
Quem ficou com vontade de ver o filme de novo deixa o like
Is his hair receding??
Nice stone cold like entrance bro xD
forgot about wcw for nintendo
I liked HammerLock Wrestling on SNES. :)
White Castle shit
Yeah dude!! AVGN for years!! For me the best game reviewer! Shitty games rule! xDDD
LJN messes up everything.
I FUCKING LOVE THAT TITANTRON.
he shouldve reviewd wcw nwo
Strong Bad - Check-a, da e-mails, check, check, checkk-a da emails!
Damn another AVGN. Seems fast. Dig it
i want cuphead
Play cuphead
Somebody get the Nerd some Rogaine for Christmas
Wrestlemania Challenge on the NES was a great game.  Good graphics, great music, impressive variety of grappling moves - totally ahead of its time.  Steel Cage Challenge deserves more coverage though, it was totally shit.
A good one was WCW for the N64
+Cinemassacre Love the video the next avgn episode should be Super Mario Bros. 2 aka the lost levels for the famicom disk system.
I wonder if James is familiar with Homestarrunner
Does it look like James is loosing a bit of his hair at the front tip of his head?
Hey, I had one of these kinds of wrestling games on PC back when I was a teenager. It lagged so bad and was so slow it was hilarious!
AVGN is as good as it's ever been. Loved the Stone Cold beer intro!
Did... did we just find a homestarrunner character origin?\n\n\n\nHelllll yeah!
ad just before the clothesline...that suspense
Like getting a new pair of underwear and taking a shut in the already that was classic.
I hope he plays the N64 games! Even though most of them followed the same designs.
The nErd I have missed!!!
Ha!  He got hit in the back by a steel chair by a overgrown video game.
IF YOU SMEEEEELLLLLLLL WHAT THE NERD...IS...COOKING!!!
Tbh, wrestling games didn't get good up until the PS1/N64 titles.
Royal Rumble on SNES was one of my favorites lol and I agree, Slammasters was fun and Super Brawl was crap!
Good thing you didn't play the game boy games, they're ljn too.. best wrestling game for nes, you didn't even cover it, it's Tecmo World Wrestling.. all the wrestlers are based off real life personas..
Well, I lasted 20 seconds. I cannot watch this anymore, it's toe-curling (and a little stale)
James. Is. Losing. His. Hair.  :(
that capcom game was so funny.
Lmao the beginning is hilarious :D this is toooo good
royal rumble was the tits
Stop been angry,  cause you losing hair!!! \nI mean on playing ljn games. \nI care about you
Eh, Raw is ok. LJN were starting to get it by then. Acclaim’s N64 output was trash.
my  fave parts of the playstation games are going  in the corner and punching the turnbuckle and running out of the  ring as the other guy is coming at you,
Great video but one critique. He shoulda used rolling rock cans! It's an avgn staple
That Hulkster AVGN theme kicked my ass . . .MY 300 POUNDS OF MAN ASS!!!
Blues Brothers. Simply Blues Brothers video games. Review them - (Doug's does not count, he is not a critic)
Nerd! You really should do a Robocop episode! There's a LOT of shitty Robocop games!
I totally agree about slammaster and I'm wondering if you ever tried the game woodreuf on the pc that was the best game i played during my childhood but dunno if it existed in an English version, I played in french, if it exist please review it it's deliciously weird yet awesome
takes me back,especially the wrestlemania by midway
Please do one on boxing games and review Ring Kings!
Have to admit, I loved playing WWF Royal Rumble and RAW for the SNES
Love watching these with a gamer friend :) May I ask about origins of series? Did angry video game nerd evolve over time or did series start with an overall plan to keep the character consistent across all episodes? Trying to decide if I can be more entertaining etc in my videos.
Yo Nerd, Play WCW Revenge for N64. It's fucking awesome. Featuring one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. THQ MAN! Also you can make your own wrestlers with moves of your choice. It's actually fucking awesome. Mainly because THQ made it.
There was some good on SNES, genesis, ps1 and n64
That POS WCW game featured Scott Steiner before he hit the roids so at least there is that.
the later WCW games (not including Revenge) are so bad. their only worthy of a episode per game.
A winner is you!
And today I learned the origin of the Homestarrunner character, Strong Bad.
I loved this one lol
Well that WCW Super Brawl game for the SNES is embarrassingly bad. Oh can please review Family Dog for the SNES.
At least THQ would take over wrestling games in the N64 era onward. R.I.P.
Do a video on bad nickelodeon games, SENPIE
I think you should review the last LJN game ever made spirit of speed 1937
Hey nurd, make review about apple pippin, if you dare
I know it's not related with the video but I'm looking for an old game title. Can't remember it well but I think it's on a CD platform, probably in late 80's or early 90's. The cinematic introduces a freshly married couple who's chased by thugs in cars...they have an accident on a cliff and it looks like the bride is the thugs' boss or something. Anyone has an idea? In my memories I associate this game with Runaway Train song from Soul Asylum but it's nearly 25 years old memories so...
I feel like you should play cuphead with the guy behind the couch! It'll be battletoads all over again!
Can't wait for the 150th episode
Please tell me that tattoo is real
Calm down its not real
Can't wait until episode 150
I had so much fun playing wcw superbrawl at my friends house back in middle school, 20+years ago lol
I was hoping Saturday Night Slam Masters would get mentioned. Best wrestling series ever.
Mental that this hasn't been done yet, top notch stuff!
I so want to believe the promo at the end was done in one take
Buuh Not cool !    I want my time and money back...*throws popcorn...This was not even funny...BUUH !
One of the best yet. Thanks!
The LJN toys were great. I had Bundy, Orndorf, Piper, Sheik, Hogan, JYD, Valentine, and the wrestling ring. I had WCW for 8 bit Nintendo. Michael PS Hayes, Ricky Steamboat, and Rick Steiner with the Road Warriors on the cover. Good game for its time but probably sucks today.
2 avgn in 1 is like a solar eclipse
king of fighting games my ass
You press the select button to pin.
Wrestlemania? Ouch. I don't envy you at all, James.
You know who made that WCW game on Super Nintendo? Beam Software, the people who made the NES classic Back to the Future. :P
Seriously, so many wrestling games and only two that AVGN reviews are any decent.
Oh man these are such a treat. The classic style of AVGN
AVGN every two to three weeks? I'm definitely not complaining. Thank you. I do miss Kyle and the theme song though...\n\nIs he dead again?
I had a feeling that 1 of your next video's would be about Wrestling:D\n\nKeep up to good work James and team.
I want more giant game cartridge suits. They were beautiful. Like a giant one in a city that you have to fight like Godzilla.
I remember playing the last game called Slam Masters'' in the arcades but it had the title Muscle Bomber Duo. Does anyone know why?
This guy is the king of diarea jokes 😂
I didn't mind the LJN made WWF SNES/Genesis games.  Granted, they were button mashers but they were fun to me.  Super Slam Masters was the tits though.  Completely forgot about that game.  Lots of fun.
OH MY GOD I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO DO AN EPISODE FOR SHIT WRESTLING GAME FOR YEARS!!!!!! Thanks Guys!!
and a  new intro holy ljn this is amazing
To bad they did not have Battle Royale for the TG16. It had no licensed content, and had complex controls.
There's 45 games published by LJN (according by Wikipedia) and you have played 26 of them (according by AVGN Wiki + this video): So only 19 LJN games left.
Stwong Buh
new avgn video!!!!!\nYEEEEEEY!!!!
Hard to think that this man is a father now.
as a fan of wrestling, let me just say this was terrific. also if any game deserved to be given a semi human form only to have its ass kick, it's superbrawl. with its mentally scarring rick steiner pelvis thrusts.
Where I grew up \n30% of all people watched wrestling\n10% were pussies\n60% watched dragon ball z\n\nI was in the majority
I want Mike to do a title card for episode 150!!
Royal Rumble on SNES was a great game! :)
Great video, James. Loving that intro especially!

You should make the extra living room with a diy room
That  day  is my birthday
i love you emma!!
The chat feature is just like the messages app, but it's organized in a way like a chatbox where you can see replies in one screen, unlike the messages which displays messages inbox style like mail. But the chat feature back in 3310 was such a hassle to use and it eats up so much load.
Nobody got nostalgic because they thought you were a hipster with your dad's ringtone...
my first phone was a firefly omg
My god this was my first phone too
Your Dad absolutely cracks me up - I love your videos with him, and your relationship with him :)
Emma I love u but...\nI'm so sorry. Ur eyebrows bother me.
Omfg, John has the same phone cover as my mum
Sure I've watched a buzz feed video with the exact same idea \n\nNOT HATING \n\njust saying what I've observed \n\nGREAT VIDEO THOUGH
Emma's like a London dealer now
Just buy a Nokia and ring it a couple of times - That was like the most comfortable I've ever seen someone say something like that around a parent ever to the point where I felt awkward :P
Answer to your question do we need smart phones   NO!! \nSmart Phones get smarter and the user get dumber \nYou should upgrade to the Nokia 3330, it had internet connection. ( Really I did)
Do we need smartphones? Absolutely not! But we use them because they are very handy 😃
turns out to be a nokia\nedit:called it
Yesterday I saw Emma live at the guides big gig, she was amazing!
I have a nexus 4 I don't use... don't project yourself on everyone else just look around not as many people as you think are glued to a phone...
I'm actually considering getting rid of my smartphone for as long as I feel like. Going back to the old nokia flipphone
You were really good at the big gig!!
anyone know the music at 0:08 ?
Merry Xmas has been in my head ever since this video😂
I acc love your new style of videos
the chat function was like threaded messages. like, one message thread with one person.
GO TO LONDON ON WEDNESDAY, IM GOING WITH MY CLASS XD
I had three games and I didn't even understand one of them
Please does ANYONE know where Emma's denim jacket is from?? 😍😍😍
My mum had that phone and i was so jealous
Omg u sounded amazing at the big gig!!!!
What?! I am 16! And I had that phone on my elementary school😂😂
....is this entire video a satire?
That is the same ring tone that was on the Satellite phone that was in Jurassic Park III  and was found in Dinosaur poo.
Emma dancing around and playing the Nokia ringtone was really adorable
wow I remember this sound 0:00
I'm travelling around Vietnam and I hear that ringtone everyday! Ps where's your jacket from?
did anyone not get a notif for this vid?
I used to own the Nokia 3310 as well.  You can knock someone out with it.
I'm late to this video, but omg that ringtone takes me back!
now you can do a full gameplay of snaek\n\ntwo
1:52 yes emma that is the iphone 8. No difference. So instead of giving you a real iphone 8 they gave you a phone with the exact equal functions
You where amazing at big gig
awww i remember my first phone, one of those nokias too. i hated it but like, it did work damn well
I saw you at the big gig, and you were absolutely great!!!! <3
I want to be in the early 2000's because that's when emo was more popular.
Yessssss you're chilling in Brighton Emma what a g
Hey Emma blackery I saw you live today at big gig and OMG I was one of my only people out of my pack who knew you! I love you Emma!
In a couple years i should use my iPhone 5 like when im twenty something
that ringtone is the sound my washing machine makes
You did amazing the big big today I loved all your songs
idk why but the beginning reminds me so much of jacksfilms..i like it :D
Hope u see this emma. You were great at the big gig and i loved your performance i cant believe you got to meet caspar lee!!!! I hope you enjoyed it yourself love ya x
I love this video
All these years hearing that same ringtone and I had no idea my dad had the Nokia ringtone
The first phone I ever had! I was 9 years old when I got it . This is so entertaining!
I wear I thought your dad in the background of the bank scene was totally going to call you after you just said you didn't want to set it off!
Hey emma\nI love your videos \nI saw you at the big gig\nit was amazing\nyours was  my favourite performance :)
Regular Snake was in the 3210. That was my SECOND phone. My first phone, when I was 13, was a brick like Motorola. I can't remember the model name but man was it solid. lol. I don't think I ever owned a 3310... But to be fair it was a loooong time ago. sigh.\nYou should have played the Nokia ringtone and done a Trigger Happy: ie, shouted HELLOOO?? lollol
Hey emma blackery i know that you were at the girlguides concert! Believe it or not yesterday you made my first concert l just lit up it was the best time of my life thank you
/i was just wondering, are you thinking of releasing some new merchandise? i was going to order some but idk whether to wait for new merch or if that will be a long time in the future?
That was also my first phone, that remembered me so much of my childhood and I'm only 16 XD
My first phone ever was a Dancall HP 2731.\nMy second phone was a Nokia 3210.
General \nSilence \nDiscreet \n\nAh yes the three genders
I m going to see her at the big gig
I hope you didn't drop it by mistake...
this is completely unrelated to the video but where's your jacket from it's so cute
Did anybody else think that whilst she was talking about not setting off the phone in the bank that her dad on his phone in the background was gonna ring her? \n\nI’d have found that hilarious.
My first phone was nokia 5110. Damn that was at my 6th grade lol first year hs when i got a 3310. Snake and space impact ftw
My first phonebwas in 1998 and i got the Motorola Startac. Flip phone and it pre-dated these, was first phone to have text messaging. Had a green screen and the sim card was the size of a credit card.
I don't know why I was excited when Emma was doing the unboxing part
The auld Lang syne tune genuinely sounds like the bagpipes up here in Scotland on new year 😂
The sad thing about this is that the phone that is your FIRST PHONE is the most up to date phone my grandad has ever owned
I wounder why her daddy loves her, shes got a charming personality.
I called it that it would be a nokia
I wanted to see old phone not new one\nEdit: NeVeRmInD
“I’m gonna become a tech channel”\n.\n.\n.\n“I’m gonna make a gaming channel”
The chat function was for AIM!!!
I literally love Emma so much
I'm surprised that still works considering analog vs digital technology
Imagine opening a box expecting an overpriced shit apple iPhone and finding a genuinely alright phone. Would rather a brick than an iPhone.
Are you a fan of Sonic Youth? \nThose phones are sick though.
Jaysus Emma if that airbag goes off you're going to be hurting
I read this as you getting a phone for the first time
3510i was my first, I was 10 and people my age were having flip up phones, camera. Now 13 years later, iPhone.
Omg the Nokia tone brings back so many memories! 💜📱
I met her little sister at school today
Emma, I had no idea you lived in Brighton! Maybe I’ll bump into you one day
I appreciate​ the Zelda reference in the description
When I was using the old nokia phones it was a normal thing that they've sent you a message with your balance after a phonecall :D Also it's called Snake 2 because Snake was on the previous mode, the 3210.
do a filming with my first camera !!!

your t-shirt?????????
Unique idea!! Havent since this before. 👌👌👌👌
i miss lucas
Omg JEFF!\nhttps://youtu.be/gUMTX2IOFtI
Buzzfeed will steal this idea pretty soon!
Apple sucks
I have met Emre before! No noke. I went to Liverpool v Arsenal 4. March 2017. The day after I took a train from Liverpool to London. I met him on the train, he's a really Nice guy btw!
Do one with Coutinho. I like this series as release a new hip hop quiz with Sturridge, Gomez and Ox. It'll be funny.
Picking most from Bayern doesn't mean he's leaving for Bayern.Stop the stupid rumors.
Make him sign the contract and do not let him leave the room. Lol
He's just being honest. He named most Bayern players because he used to play with them and even know them in person. Indeed Bayern Munich is top 5 team in Europe so it all make sense.
Algum brasileiro q gosta do Liverpool e assiste esse canal?
I guessed everyone but ramos
literally just a bayern team
In other words- Bayern
Let him go dony need him i always sell him on fifa and get loen..saul ... kimmch or renato
This guy is a former Bayern player. It's no surprise that half of the team are Bayern players
Yes,we are living in Ronaldo & Messi era.We must be proud of it.
Mignolet no goals in should surely be ahead of Neuer.
liverpool have to buy carlos lampe, bolivia goalkeeper
Looks like Emre is pushing for a move to Munich 😂😂😂
maybe a move to bayern?
People complain about Emre choosing so many Bayern players, but keep in mind, they are all some of the best in the world in their respective positions. I totally understand him.
Just gonna take a wild guess here, he wants a bayern move?
Damn. That's a good team.
This shows can have his heart on Bayern m
Frank could have been better but still good
So basically, Emre Can is joining Bayern Munich for free in the summer.
Stop making him to videos and make him sign the contract lol
Half of the players are from Bayern Munich
That would be a beast team, and suits, the big beast himself emre
He just picked all the best players
Hope he signs new contract
That is one hell of an awesome midfield Emre, glad to see you know what you're talking about.
this is just a German/Bayern hybrid
Please sign a new contract Emre!!!
KLAVAN is god. One of the best defenders in the world. He’s strong powerful great tackle. He is a proper leader and legend
Although it's mostly bayern players n players he play with it's a pretty good team☺
Stevie G providing to Ron and Messi...just imagine 😍😍
Sounds like he wants to come back to Bayern
when did he play with ramos?
I think he likes Bayern
I love you ❤️ can \nOne of the best players in the premier league
Never mind who he picks, sign a contract and focus on the games.
I'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm…
He would like to sign for Bayern??
Lowkey emre wants to be in bayern again
Does Can just love Bayern, or does he just love Bayern. I think he just loves Bayern.
OK, Ronaldo's good and all, but Danny Ings??!!?!
Funny how most of the the team is munich
*Emre Can chooses his all-time eleven from the stars he's played with or against, for club and country.* , please read the description before talking trash.
And he's leaving in the summer ... Total shame to the board if he leaves
he want to bayern :) bitch
Not biased at all.
RB Philip lahm yes great banta can 😀😀😀😂😂😂 nah but being serious it will be bad to see him leave he seems so nice 👍
Jurgen is going to Bayern so is Emre Can.
Choses an ex Liverpool player and a player who wants to leave Liverpool great side🤣🤣🤣
To many Bayern players in my opinion
he just want is bayern move to be done soon
I thought this was Emre Can's dream team not the bayern starting XI
Can your one of my favourite midfielder
He has chosen players from four clubs only, namely:\n1) Bayern\n2) Liverpool\n3) Barcelona\n4) Real Madrid\nAre those his favorite clubs?
Bro he should just said Bayern
Clearly can is a Munich fan
I think Emre is eyeing a move to Bayern....
Title is misleading, It should be Emre Can's favourite Bayern Players and some other players as well. 😂
shame on defender lfc
Mostly FC Bayern players!
Coutinho the best
So all bayern munich players are in his dream team and his Liverpool teammates. I can understand GK position and forward but all other guys 😧😧😧
Steven Gerrard forever

Aww thanks for the reference to halah food it just makes it easier when visiting
I am definitely team red too 😋
Oh man that's sexy
YOUR STOMACH IS A BOTTOMLESS PIT MIKE
hah! You're still rocking that Vancouver T Shirt!   YES!!!!
For me, these dishes have too much starch overall, on the other hand I like starchy foods, but I would rather not gain weight.
Damn bruh, not even the hot oil could save you. That's a sad day lol
If you have never tried biang biang before, your noodle life is not complete! Lol! I agree! 😁
What is that iconic xi an cold noodle dish called again?
FoodNetwork needs to give you a show...I could watch you eat Chinese food all day long 😂 love your videos!!
Love the videos, would it be possible to add a list of the foods featured for their spelling? There aren't many authentic places near me, so when I'm out of the city I like to try out new items, but find it hard to remember what to look for, especially when the menu is poorly translated or translated very vaguely.
Mike You should go back to Xi an for a food tour filming!
I'm from 西安 as well and I loveeeee ur videos. It reminds me about home every time when I hear you speak mandarin with a bit of the xian dialect. Pepper soup is my favourite food and  vinegar complete my life. Got u fam.
Can you visit Chicago? It has a Chinatown and I want to know what restaurants to visits.
that intro song is sick... reminded me of my X.
How old are you Mike?
Your hind leg is rising up DID NO ONE CATCH THAT?\nWe are bipedal mammals we don't have hind legs b o i
baby in background at 11:50 was crying in step with the music in background lol
your hind leg is rising up  -- priceless! That pao mo looked great btw.
Thanks for telling what is halal and can you pls mention wether the food is halal or not in your future videos pls
Hey Mikey you should come back Xi'an and give us a tour of what it's like and all of your child hood foods that aren't served here in the US
I'll have to research good Xi'an places here in Vancouver. It seems like my kind of food!!!
Xi'an is Chang'an ? \n\nThe city of Empress Wu ?
I can only watch your videos when I'm eating because I get so hungry watching you
aww at the baby crying soooo cute
You can have love without marriage and you can have marriage without love.
I recognized this place immediately! When I was in La I went here with my family. How cool.
I've gone to the same plaza many times, but I've never seen that restaraunt lol
Never end a video in a low note
i feel fat watching this
YO\nI LIVE IN THAT AREA
Next thing u know the white pepper is salt
I am glad that Xi'an Garden is pretty authentic. \n\nMy girlfiend and I love that place!
You always like everything. How much they pay you?
Mike-e you are the best ! I live an hour from Los Angeles, and i'm going to try to visit the first place you went to in honor of you. I will show my waiter the foods and hopefully they will be able to bring me those, just how you had them. Keep keeping on. Much Support from a happy mother of four, that looks at your videos on her free time.
Mike you should come to Bangladesh. You would love the cuisine here.
Come to malaysia when raya fest i show you how malaysian eat
for the 200 of you guys that dislike this video ... you all dont know good food when you see it ..
I love you Mikey, but please stop sticking your chopsticks in your bowls! 😂
COME TO THE FLINDERSTREET CAFE!!!!!!!!
Great videos Mikey!  I especially liked your visit to Shirokiya in the Ala Moana Shopping Center...my favorite stop.  Next time you're in town, you gotta try their Kulu Kulu custard filled pastry....onolicious!  Thanks for the tours!  Aloha!
The food looks so good that I actually got chills while watching it!😁😌
Those steamed noodles in the second place sound right up my alley.
Mark Wiens has a million subscribers; and the Food Ranger just reached one million subscribers.  Time to get this channel to one million subscribers as well.   It would be dope if you would do a collaboration with the Both of them.  I think it would definitely get you over that million mark.
You're in my area!
How sad, disepointed, destroyed, mad, upset, lifethretendly hart broken would he have been if there would have been western broccoli in the soup.
BUT WHEN IS MIKE ACTUALLY GONNA GO TO CHINA
That place is 28 miles from my house. Guess where I'm going Saturday. Thanks
I just moved from LA to Little Fort, Canada and I'm already missing the food
try the kitchen sink at fair oaks pharmacy in south pasadena east of los angeles!
@13:35 No stuffed sneezes so your not full!
The noodles are my favorite
No buddy cares if you go round  their restaurant
Loved your videos. Keep it up. You are a legendary eater food lover
if this is your random free day, when do you ever have a real free day? 😂 thanks for entertaining us with your videos!
Anyone know what the places are called
I miss Xi'an food so much after this vedio
Makes me miss China already.
Love your honest reviews, thanks for keeping it real! You da best Mike!
Never have Xian food. Looks delicious!
You would like more pork on the back of your bun???  9:00
Making this video available in Colorado where nothing close to Xian food is available, is a crime
Get out of LA wtf!!!    Find something with ambience and class.    You are losing it bub!!!!
Hot oyul
Your making me hungry
I'm hungry, i want to eat
Those gooey noodles look amazing....wish I knew how to cook something like that
Spicy means burning butt when on the toilet 🚽
I do the same thing whenever I eat food from my country, especially specialized regional and provincial cuisine..
U should go New Orleans and go to try the special number 2 which is from Orchards Ramen restaurant.
That is not soup, its jello.
please try Filipino foods...  :)   love your videos...  the secret taste of every food I eat!!!!  stay cool!!!
Mike, make a Live Stream 🤤
Oh my god, I miss the food
this channel always makes me hungry
Definitely one thing I miss about LA is the MASSIVE variety of foods you can get.
Can you try Japanese food in LA? Cindy’s kitchen was 2 minutes away. Can you do a meetup at Westfield Santa Anita?
Hi Mike, when you order several dishes, do you eat all of them at one sitting or do you taste each and take the rest home...smile
Mike, I am so happy you got a taste of home! That is an important thing for people who have moved far from the the place they grew up. And thank you for the education! Watching your videos has taught me a great deal about places and cultures that I am not familiar with.
Your hind leg is rising up LOL
3:04 food porn...
I LOVE THE BEEF PORK THING OMG\nI'm Chinese btw\nI think it's called Rou Jia Muo?\nAnd I eat spicy food like it's no big deal
more San Gabriel please. Go to 99 ranch market
bruh look like budget jackie chan
slurp...sluuuurrppp.... mieeennn noodle...! thats a chinese burger, so delicious, with lamb,pork, Thats WOW,i think! i never try this
Slimy food
Broccoli

Go to ISIS base
Great
made me hungry
 Happy bite , happy life - Mike Chen
哇 居然来了San Gabriel!
whenever I ate a cousins regarding lam, it smells nastyhowever you ate lam without disgustingI envy you
他們殺死無辜者，殺死我們的孩子，我們怎樣不能捍衛自己，摧毀俄羅斯呢，永遠終結呢？
Is the Rouwan Hulatang 肉丸胡辣汤 different than Henan style Hulatang?
Come on Mike, you're an American. Your hometown in somewhere in the MidWest. Xi'an is NOT your hometown, damn it!
I like the body and the specs of the i7 variant, but not running on chrome OS. Running it with Linux would be sweet, having around 8hours of usage. 13 to 15 FHD or better display.
can you make a dual boot on this machine? like windows 10 and chrome os?
I'd definitely choose an iPad Pro over this. Only reason I'm using a Surface Pro is because I need to do software development.
Damnn all those Google products looks pretty clean, but still to pricy thooo 🤪😣😣.
Why would I pay 1000$ for a PC thats limited to google chrome and some android apps when I can get something for 1/2 the price or less that does both of those things, and much more?
Bla bla bla. Why don't you review the actualy chromebook?\nThat screen looked terrible. Glossy and dim.
Chromebooks should top out at 500 bucks. You can get a Windows laptop with a 1060 for 1000 dollars
does the pen work on any device. I feel like that would be a big market for google.
Google just take my money already
Yea,no. Google Office is still no Microsoft office. And I have never had any experience of  coding in android (or iOS for that matter). Is that even possible ?
A lot of people don’t need traditional computers anymore there’s a market for these and it will get bigger in the future.
Cool device, but the surface is a better deal in every way for a similar price. And if you want just install an android emulator and you get app support.
Oof. Glass on the bottom?! Na-ah.
a $1,000 Chromebook... running chrome OS? no thank you.
1 thing though. Google can lock you out of your account at any time, for any reason. Check out what happened to Dr. Jordan Peterson. No thanks
Sexy AF ! Could it run Win10 ?
No Microsoft Office? Sorry, no.
Bezels are too wide
Aaaand it just got outdated because intel launched the 8th gen laptop CPUs.
If  they make these changes, I'll switch from my Razer Blade.\n\n-Dedicated GPU or Thunderbolt 3 for external GPU connection\n\n-1080p, 2k, or 4k but I believe 2k would be perfect for it's size. I use a Razer Blade and scaling has always been an issue with non-standard resolutions.\n\n-Bluetooth 5.0 (pairing multiple speakers)\n\n-Ability to add Window OS. I'm not asking it comes with it, just that I could install it side by side. I guess I could just use Linux.\n\n-Make a black version from aluminum.
So ugly and I honestly don’t see the point of it.
The only thing I can’t do with a phone that I wish I could is use desktop-like programs and this laptop can’t do that, so it’s quite useless for $1000 in my opinion. But the design is awesome, it should have either been a windows laptop or $600
If this thing came with  a gtx 1050  ti with 256 ssd this would be my go to laptop i just love the design
What's the music in the start?
I totally would have bought this if it had come out earlier.
Any Apple haters here? If there are, *facepalm* OK.
You could buy a MacBook Air for the price of the base model Pixelbook with basically the same specs.
For the one click tethering, while it was super useful when apple first came out with it it is kind of irrelevant now. All you have to do is swipe up on iPhone to control centre (and I think swipe down on android?) to turn on personal hotspot and since the computer remembers the WiFi network it will automatically connect.
I pity the students that lived the Android/chrome OS life and enter the business world looking for a job.
Too many poor people in the comments , sad for them.
Who puts their  phone face  down anyway?
Might be easier to install android on Chromebooks by default and create a chrome os launcher an add some features
It looks so good, I wish you could run windows on it and use it as a proper laptop.
ChromeOS is so limited. Mad to pay so much for a Chromebook
If I want an expensive computer that only runs mobile apps, I'd just get an iPad Pro.
As stunning AS USELESS. \n\nDoes it give the option to install Windows? lol sorry Google, me too I don't like Microsoft, but maybe you can do something about it in 10 years.
I don't understand the purpose of this laptop. Unless Google is trying to compete with Apple and Microsoft with a *FULL* desktop OS. Which Chrome OS isn't that. I bought an Acer laptop off eBay for $300, it came with 8 GB of RAM (upgraded to 12 GB), 1 TB hard drive (upgraded to 500 GB SSD), Intel Core i5-5200u, and NVidia 940m graphics. And my Acer can do more than 10 times the thing the Google Pixelbook can do for more than half the Pixelbook's price
Would hack Linux on it anyway
What is the point of a $1000 laptop that cannot run real desktop programs like Lightroom? Get an iPad Pro if you want this almost-laptop experience
google starting to be like apple too.
Man, I really wish i could use this, but I need muh Windows apps
I don't understand why anybody would get this thing. I guess linux lovers who just purely hates Mac and Windows? For that price, you might as well get a surface or MacBook. Google seems like is trying to copy Apple A LOT recently, and in a bad way. Pixel phone copied all the stuff I hate about iPhone such as no expandable storage, no flexibility (in terms of what you can get, unlike Samsung and LG who gives a lot of options) and no style. I don't buy a phone just because it looks like something else, which is iPhone design in this case, I buy phones only when there are unique things that really makes me bond, just like how you would love a long-term crush. I'd like to see a phone with the company's own flavours, like Samsung with TouchWiz and their stylish S8/note8 and A series devices, not just copying Apple.\nOn the pixel laptop, Pixel is copying 50% Surface 50% MacBook. Heck they even copied Apple's dongle and also fanless concept, hooray! Let's see if the Core i7 chip would desolder itself after a year or two of usage!\nMy suggestion: Go dump the money on a mid-spec Surface or Dell and dump the rest of the money on a Sandy bridge budget powerful pc!
I have Surface/MS products. How can this take the place of my Surface Book or Surface Pro? I'd like to know because I am thinking of changing everything from MS to Google because MS had abandoned their Windows platform and now abandoned Groove Music streaming, of which I loved. Disgusted in MS. I need Adobe services, need a replacement for Word, and most other things I use are apps, so??? Any thoughts? How is or WHAT is Chrome OS?
if only it ran windows lol, I might be interested.
It has a headphone jack - its a dealbreaker -  would buy it if id had the new features like not having a headphone jack like apple does it !
To manage and edit photography. Good on the go tool? or should i just go back to the mac?
Probably the nicest designed piece of hardware on the market right now
Great job as always, Dieter. Just wanted to throw in that I've been using, pretty much exclusively, the HP Chromebook 13 G1 for a year. It's close, not quite!...as nice as this new Objet Du Pixel save for no touchscreen and no 360 hinge. Two bummers when working with Chrome OS/Android Apps. It has a great keyboard and screen (3200x1800 snazzy) and if you're the sort of person, like many, who really does a great deal of writing in various forms on your computer, then it makes gobs of sense. The point you make about how useful android apps are is so true. Big issue for me is running applications that are staples on Mac or Windows, for me that means One Note for example, and being constrained to a web version on the Chromebook. Mine runs an i5 with 8gb of Ram, but the web experience of such Office is just...not. For the right person, and one who digs deep into Google apps, Drive, etc, it is a fantastically efficient way to go. Cheers.
i7 with Google Chrome is like an M16 that shoots BBs. \nPointless.
This thing makes the 12” MacBook seem like a good buy
Can i code /programma with this? Like Android studio or visual code
Can you put linux in it?
For that price I'd rather get a proper Windows or Mac laptop.
Welcome to the future, where everything sold by the major manufacturers is overpriced by $200-$500.
Can I install Ubuntu in it?
People bash on chromebooks way too much. They're fantastic for school & children and college. But only when they're at a reasonable price. There are some much better windows ultra books you can get at 1000 dollars. Dare I say it a second hand mac would be better. if this were 2 or 3 hundred quid cheaper it would be a far better proposition
It's looking Dope AF...I just love how premium it looks from behind...but the Bezels are ugly IMO.
Isnt he the idiotic cable fold guy
Does this pixelbook has graphics card?
Does it support VR?
Can this run Win 10?
I hate this American accent. That nauseatingly disgusting sing song gayishly nasal English. I despise it as much as I despise Americans
Wait what... I thought the guy demoing the laptop is an ad from Google. Turns out it was the same guy speaking. Nice cinematography lol
Why all focus on Laptops? Why not a Mac mini type desktop?
Google is trying to become APPLE with way out of price hardware.   NEWS FLASH,  THE reason we HATE APPLE is because their overprice hardware.   Miss the days of the NEXUS.       NEXUS is awesome and swell,  but Pixel can go to
Hey, look a headphone jack. I thought Google was getting away from those. 😑
When you touch the screen, it shakes a lot. It crazy stupid.
Can install windows?
What?? It looks hideous
Useless af
okay yeah... but can it run Crysis?
I honestly really like Chromebooks especially for typing up papers and doing research, they're pretty inexpensive and work great with my Google Account I've actually used my Chromebook more than my laptop during school times to each their own I guess.
should cost 500-600$ for the i5 8gb 128gb to compete with the ipad line not the windows or mac laptops
i though Apps is EOL pretty soon? Google keep pushing progressing web app, how can web end in the future??\ni dont get it.
I don't understand why people are always like spending x amount of money for this piece of tech is stupid. First of all, you don't have to buy it. Secondly, why do you care what someone else buys with their money if it has no effect on you? Get a life.
Its a chrome book and has 10 hours of battery life, for 1000$. Really? You get that type of battery on Macbooks running Mac OS X. I'd expect better for something running Chrome OS.
Hope the guys at Google will make a  Pixel Tab ....
For the price of this.. I'd rather get a Microsoft Surface Pro laptop
i'de buy this if can run autocad, photoshop, sketchup and 3dsmax! ^^
Very basic usage. All that you can do with your phone. There is no point google competing this market segment, they will never get the mass with laptops. Google is all about mobile phones and their leading role in the market is undisputed.
Are we heading to a place where Chromebooks eventually run Android?
Literally copied Surfaces \n\n\n\n\n\nWtf?!
NEW GADGETS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3_qllJSfb8
this guy is sweet lol
prize?
Cannot run windows?
Reinventing the wheel.
Guys, rub Anyone  know larger  this vgrsion
google and its bezels.....
Google Pixelbook first look.. good
Preview wonderful
Me love this gargle fixal stuff
I just wanna know the song that starts playing at 4:45
To all the people confused by this product, I think it's an obvious competitor to the Microsoft Surface Laptop. It's at the same price, but the pixelbook has better specs. The surface laptop has the gimped Windows 10 S which limits you to only being able to use apps from the Windows store, giving it pretty much the same functionality as Chrome OS.
There's a million people in the comment section going what is the point of this? Well, I'm currently using a laptop with Ubuntu, and 90% of the time I'm in a web browser. This machine can run a real Ubuntu installation via Crouton, can run Android apps, can be used like a tablet and has a true stylus for drawing/notetaking. I was looking into a Dell XPS 13 and a tablet, but this + Pixel Pen actually does more than either, costs slightly less and looks fantastic. This is basically the Compaq TC1100 done right.
Surface is the best.\n      The end
How is this different from Lenovo Yoga series!!??
even this has that stupid two-tone design with the glass half above, ugh
Pixelbook without Internet = a piece of expensive metal
Can i run W10 on it? Actually, nvm, wtf is up with those bezels!?
America's own Terrorism,but refuse to call it that.. They said they needed motive and the rest of the facts. REALLY!
Thanks hats1976,yes I'm a multi millionaire lawful citizen, with 3000 guns,I would like to attend all that I can
Bruh if u have 42 guns u got a problem bruh
400 pounds up 30 floors, disables security, and fire alarms, removes 800 pounds of hurricane proof windows, reigns fire for 5-10 minutes, WITH NO MOTIVE, yup government did this
This is domestic terrorism but the media won't call him a terrorist.
This is very tragic, so is what's happening in Rosemont Illinois, with the young black lady that was found in the Crown Plaza hotel freezer, but no coverage on that,,,,,Smdh
Itsashley doesn't get it because she is a Democrat.
The only way to stop these shootings from happening again is common sense gun control.
Anyone else think that was a belt-fed gun military grade and there's no way this guy could have done that sounds like he's a patsy for some big psyop operation
FAKE NEWS RELEASE THE HOTEL VIDEOS OF THE SHOOTER BRINGING ALL THOSE GUNS IN THE HOTEL OR THE SHOOTER WITH ALL THOSE SUIT BAGS 23 GUNS SMH IT DONT MAKING SENSE
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
Paddock was VERY wealthy. Did Paddock sell his SOUL to the DEVIL to have everything he ever wanted, in exchange for this violent act?
Chris rock was right!   whatever happened to crazy ? He had no motive except crazy!  I wish they'd stop mentioning scumbags name.
Y'all a little slow over there?
What if when he booked that hotel, he saw all the people and thats where he got the idea in the first place.
That's creepy, I was just at the Life Is Beautiful Festival last week and noticed people watching the festivities from the tall condo building.
Never giving up my second amendment tho
AlJaazera im Disappointed in You Guys ,Im going back to RT
There are more the two shooters!!!! Show the countless videos with two distinct and different distance gun shots.  False flag for gun grab.
No one is talking about the woman who warned them they were going to die that night weird?
This is unacceptable let's drop some bombs on Afghanistan and teach them a lesson!!
What about the flashing lights on the 12th floor?? Plenty of videos showing it
Sin city
Will you let them rest my god. I'm sick of hearing about this. None of the news networks care about the people who died all they want is ratings and to exploit and profit from their deaths.
He wanted to be on the fbi most wanted list, like dad  who betrayed him and his family bank robbing
she very old woman she .my grandma just 55year's old she is 64..she is from Philippines..??
Notice the reporters head is perfectly covering the shot out windows? But why?
Why aren't reporters asking, why he chose a venue full of T🤡rump supporters, red necks and nationalist??? As he obviously didn't attack the other concerts full of hippies, minorities and gays!
BUMP-STOCK, bump-stock !! not quite so sexy .  IT'S A START !
more media bullshit, trying to take our minds off other questions...
This was far worse than September 11th, because it was no way an attack on government, but pure murder.
Go back to bed America. You are free to do as we tell you. -- BH
Yearly 30.000 Americans get killed by guns. More than in 44 European countries combined. The US also has the highest Infant mortality rate of all modern industry countries. America can be proud !!  👍
Government planned the attack.
This could be like that movie shooter ! Gov set uo
No rime or reason to this madness. Whatever his motives were he took along with him.
He wasn't alone in that hotel room. Media is hush about this
There's no shortage of conspiracy fuckwits posting in the comments. Sad.
Weapons aren't the problem. There is very manipulative, smart, evil people out there who will go through any means necessary to kill a large amount of people for no real reason at all.. Most people who do mass shootings like this are patient and they plan ahead, if we were to SOMEHOW stop EVERYONE from getting hands on a automatic rifle then these crazy people will just learn how to make Bombs to kill people instead. Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\n\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.
That is pretty weird that multi millionaire would go on a shooting spree so randomly
Excuse me but I need to puke!! 😷 This makes me very sick.
NO! The CIA did
What a time to live in.
How sad! My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims. I knew some people and celebrities who attended the Life Is Beautiful Music Festival. Scary to think what he may have had planned for that Music Festival.
The type of people who used to rant about Pizza Gate now have a lot of theories about the Vegas shooting.
I think there was more than one shooter. Always will
Comments on videos like this remind how stupid so many people are
On 4chan weeks before the shooting an anonymous person warned against a big attack in Las Vegas. This man is a patsy. No motive because he wasn't motivated. He somehow carried 20 guns into a hotel room by himself. Many say there were two shooters. He was probably a gun runner and got used as a patsy, killed before the shooting ever took place. Look it up.
This title is annoying😂😂
Who chooses these events next to buildings like that how do you not see that as a security nightmare
A.J., be the first network to demand the hotel security video footage, of him loading up the room with 20 AR modified full auto rifles.  and the entire 2 hour before- during -after hallway cam, on 32nd floor.  You could gain credibility as a network. simply demand the footage, till they turn it over.
I live in Las Vegas it's was not only one shooter and why the news not showing or tell the people that there are 3 windows busted out on different floors
Something definitely seems fishy about all of this. This has inside job written all over it
Why is a terrorist news channel trending ? Just more proof that Youtube is completely biased towards Democrat causes and fakes the whole trending thing. It's not an algorithm, it's the extreme leftists at Youtube manipulating views, likes and your perceptions.
No but his brother did.
God forbid but imagine if he had a Gernade launcher or other explosives
I'm still waiting on the footage of him checking in the hotel and walking around the casino to see if he had with anybody else (accomplice) with him.. there's no way he could have done this completely on his own
Sad to say... This topic will blow over in 2 weeks and we'll be talking about the kardashians again

🚫BAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!\nBAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!🚫
What happened in real was an FBI weapon deal with ISIS went wrong, Isis found out paddocks with the government and decided to either take him hostage and carry out the shooting or killed him and carried out the shooting...wondering why they not releasing cctvs of the casino.? Imagine if the public find out that it was an FBI -ISIS weapon deal gone wrong. SO now that paddock is killed he became the suspect for a while until the videos of multiple shooters came out. WAKE UP PEOPLE
So the killer was 'white'. Hope you know that Trump.
Gun control..
a 64 yearold man didnt carry 20k rounds of ammo and weapons up to his floor. plus one of his mental issues where from mk ultra. how i know? because various peoole who have been put threw it also had same issues.
Stupid whites always doing mass shootings
if we don’t change gun regulation laws. this will only get worse.
stop referring to this terrorist as the gunman he is a terrorist say it a radical white terrorists
White policeman's jobs and not hard you're never in danger. When all your job is to do is shoot down black people you're not human
Such great jihad will take place in the next three weeks, and within a year, there will be at least five times, Pado, the great hero! Great holy warrior! Heaven has your place!
wait! Isn't Al Jazera the terrorists main channel for getting their message out? Why is this allowed on YouTube?
Way to good statement I know philipinos don't talk the way that lawyer talked
Why was she stacking her belongings on top of her as if she were moving, as reported by her neighbors
americans who support owning automatic  weapon - seem to have the wisdom of a conesnail
White guy killing white people.  No problem.   Great news.
Where in the world can you find mass shooting become a regular occurence? Almost all shooters were white. But no one blamed their white families. Now you have a white shooter with a non-american, non-white girlfriend who is on the other side of the world when it happened and yet her photo is everywhere like she was the one holding the gun. Hmm.. something is NOT right.
Chance the rapper concert??all he does is help others tho!!
Conspiracy theories are simply a way for mouth breathing retards to feel like they're smart.
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist

By far the HARDEST MUSIC VIDEO EVER ... ya favorite music video is now a boogie’s toilet 😂‼️💩
at least ion see them this song makes me wanna..  comments no more 💀
When you enter the fourth dimension of friendzone where it sends you into Benjamin button lmao
white people have no cultu-
White people have no culture? What’s this then?
To be honest, I’ve desensitise myself to this sort of thing. The way I see it is, if he’s not hurting anyone then he can continue role playing as a baby lmao.
That's enough YouTube for me today thank you.
I would have fucked that blonde girl right there in the crib
Why all of these goons are found in the U.S.A always.
World is gonna come to an end
Why his parents let this happen
Oh man she got a very hot baby sitter,
He's one step away from molesting a kid.
You can see the pain in his eyes
He must be depressed for a fat baby where is his parents did they abandon their adult baby he needs treatment
How the f*ck did I get here?  WTF...where's my titty?
Okayyy so basically all men this day in age... what's the point? just kidding 😂
I came for a porno \n\nI wasn’t disappointed
He has some guts af and he wears dippers Jesus cris
A 40 year old virgin wow
who else checked the the comments to see if it was fake
How does he afford to do this?
“It’s destruction day” 😂
I'm so creeped out
Wait how does this guy live on his own?\n\nCan I just quit my job and become a giant baby too?
They get paid for this bs forget it
I think this cool HE BUILT HIS OWN BED AND HIGH CHAIR
That's it. That's the final fucking straw for me. I've seen it all. Fuck it. Jesus, just press the reset button now
Not to be messed up but ima bitch slap the goofy out of him!
Well, I guess not everyone is ready to become an adult.
Get a life u old man stop  acting  like a mothafucka baby wtf is wrong with people now this  day...
This shit just made me hella uncomfortable...Like what the fuck is this bullshit!!!???🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🤢🤢🤢
And I thought I was babyish.....
That pacifier is gonna fuck his teeth up!\nI really wanna know how much he pays her to do that.
Most mothers would of whooped his ass out of childhood big ole gerber baby.
I guess I could understand liking baby furniture, like the crib, and wearing a onesie, but the fact that he literally plays with toys and eats baby food alone all day is fucking weird.
Would it be weird if a 12 year old did it
you cant make this stuff up, i was literally dying
people took the time to comment...39 in counting...keep it coming.LMAO
how does this nigga get this fat off of baby formula and apple juice ?
The fuck this nigga got fucked up by a babie that’s my he ask like one
Bars signify safety, yeah okay then go to jail. You'll be really secure. I'm jk, it's his life so whatever.
the cat really wants to die
Shut up everyone with negative stuff I think it cool for someone with problems to do what they want . U probley have a problem to hatersss
I'm just confused
How does he get money
This is sad i legitly feel bad for him
What does he mean this is not a sexual thing? All I see is him staring @ her boobs while she reads to him
boy there is a point in life when you are soposs to stop shiting your self
I'm sleep y is this on my recommendations
i think your a big baby
Ok who else was talking to themselves and wondered HOW THE FUCK IS HE THAT FAT BUT HE LEGIT LIVES ON BABY FOOD(no offense tho)
He does not count as a man
Still isn't an addiction it is age regression. It's therapy. Ddlg and abdl are more common than you think
Honestly I wouldn't be this extreme but I would put on pajamas and just lay around tbh
I would like to knock his fat face out
Now if only H3H3 saw this.
Wow, I really want to sock this guy in the jaw. God needs to flood the earth again.
this guy is a fucking weirdo
This is gross its like wtf who is your mother
Lol this made me laugh 😄 a bit get a fall time job man
I could smash the mom
Why just why is a fat 30 yer old man acting like a baby I mean come on he has a mental problem or something!
He muders kids. If they dont agree with him, he kills them. Simple.
His mom is hot😍😍😍
This makes me so happy
At five bars signified going to jail
W.T.F
Who pays the bills tho
Wtf
Wtf
Weirdo
What a sick fuck
Jeeeeeeesus christ what am i watching
Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ wow 😳
That shit kind of looks comfy lmao.
Ew
....WHAT!!!
Fucking weirdo
This dude probably hasn’t lost his virginity
MERICA
Does he shit & piss himself?
Sick man
This guy is adorable
awwwww
MTV cribs.
this is stupid
wtf did I just watch
damn his moms hot
Bruhh
my WTF??? factor just burst threw the roof
This fatass should get a fuckin life smh
Sorry I'm mean
Oh boy.
this is completely fucked
Who Do you Wipe?
Whats wrong with people
Bet he takes the nastiest diaper shit.
wth
*white people.....*
Oh god I cummed
Umm....
Kevin looked st that scale like it was the electricity bill
Hey pussy are you still there? - Popeyes
kevin lost a extra half pound of water.. he will gas out now lol... lets go el cucuy snap down city round 4
Tony Gonna Crrruuuuush Kevin Lee's drained out ass
Tony already won the fight, u can tell. Beating the scale was prob harder than it will be tomorrow.
Let's GO Ferguson ;).
Look at his face he looks dead!!
i think the scale was a lil bit off, think they just needa go straight digital rather than that oldschool hand shit cuz he went from 156 to 154.5 idk about that
El Cucuy going to whoop that ass. No homo
TEAM LEE!!!
Motherfucker you missed the deadline.  You lucky they gave you an hour.   Wont matter.   Tony is nice and hydrated.   Enjoy the ass whoopin
Awesome. Good job Kevin :D.
Talk shit all you want but respect his dedication, dudes round plump ass isn't even seen here he cut so damn much
Its not that hard to make weight.. its part of our job and i always make weight johnny the rock hendricks
Kevin knew he wasn’t going to make it the first time. Read his body language, he put up the act. Weak ass. AND DOWN GOES KEVIN. Fake ass Mcgregor wannabe.
Ferguson looks like he had a terrible weight cut.
Lol they were wiping some of the grease out his hair to make weight.
Ferg looked very comfortable ,i hope that  young man stays Fit  against ferg
Whats that red dot on Lee Pectoral?
Why are these fuckers still using an old ass weight scale that was probably built by Adam and Eve.  It's 2017 people.....Geeeeeze!
I'm a Kevin Lee fan but man he just doesn't look so good at the weigh in
Cover your ass bitch ! this is a conservative country
(Eventually) you get a second chance i title fights. Come on stop making it a big deal
you guys hear the predator in the beginning
Tony probably had a tough cut too judging from his reaction to making the weight.
Are you sure he was 156..? It only took you a full minute to figure out the fucking weight...
The way the title is worded makes it seem as if Ferguson was the one with the issue.
EPIC TRILOGY IN THE MAKING \n\nMARK MY WORDS GUYS
Tony makes it look easy JS
For those who missed my predictions on the UFC channel, i recommend betting on Lee. I'm dropping a couple hundred on it. And DJ is the obvious choice in the other main event. Borg has too many wins by decision and he isn't winning that way against DJ. I could see Lewis potentially KOing Werdum in the first round but if it goes past the first, Werdum wins. I would bet on Werdum.
Gj Lee but man you looked drained.  Gonna be a tough one tomorrow
U don't play with the scale and double check triple check when somones on weight . It's quick , he missed weight both times
Why don't they use like electronic weighting scales?
lets go tony fergusson kill this bitchh u are the man
Ha haa Kevin Lee showing his black ass walking back!!
Tony going to knock the got a.isu outta Kevin 😂😂
Kevin looks drained....
' fuck luck ' love that comment
Lol Kevin Lee ass exposed
Weight-Cuts are bullshit
Kevin bouta lose
Nice lol
men ! i feel so fucking sorry for these fighters doing this shit everytime Really ,
He looks very drained
Kevin will win
Tiramisu outta Kevin lee
Lee cuts a lot of weight,he walks around at 190 lbs
Untill when the the new weight classes????? UFC fucks fighters health with this brutal weight cuts.
Fuck that old bald white guy controlling the scale
Pay Attention To The Little Bumps On Kevin’s Stomach You Also See Those On Canelos, Jon Jones and bodybuilders
That weigh in guy must take some serious under the table money....
I don't know what I would do . My sack itself is 10 lbs .. move up a weight class ???
Damn he is too skinny. Cutting weight sucks. Missed it by a pound. My guess he'll shave his head and sit in the sauna for 40 minutes
Kevin FTW all day sorry peoples =)
If he didn't make the weight you know ferguson would be fighting Connor for the real belt
Hahaha wtf?! GAY KEVIN LEE forgot to remove buttplug before weigh ins 😂 you can see it poking out when he was walks off after first attempt. That's a big buttplug 😳
Making weight is such a stupid useless and gross primitive practice. I hate watching these guys and girls look all sucked in just to make some fucking dumb arbitrary number that means fuck all
Why dont they just use normal weighing scales that tell you the weight instantly, fucking idiots.
Lmao told ya'll he would get beat cos he struggled with the cut😂
Kevin is one sexy mixed race man
All the stupid people are talking about weight cuts and how horrible they are but they forget it's the fighters that choose to cut all that weight. No one told them to, they just want all the advantages they can get or in some cases minimize their disadvantages. Dumbfucks!
Missed weight fix title
Nice ass
Kevin will embarrassed Connor if they fought
WTF is up with the guy doing the scale? It's 155 right?   Why would he even ask? That'\ns not his job and it doesn't affect anything. He's just supposed to read off what the scale says.
Tony is going to get stopped in his tracks and realize a couple of things

I've never matched apple and blackberry...I can't wait to try it!!
To all continental Europeans who can't get treacle: I like to use sirop de Liège (boiled down fruit juice, dates, apples and pears I think) or really dark brown muscovado sugar or dates soaked in water and blended up. If someone has another idea, please tell me! \nPs: Golden Syrup is Grafschafter Goldsaft to my fellow Germans :)
Honestly I just would like 2 likes that's all:)
Just got back from visiting the UK: I got C+D cupcakes, they were sooo good!
Everybody's good at cooking something and I'm good at cooking crumble \n\nI've got one in the oven would you like some?
Why on earth would a person (2 people) dislike this vid?
I love your videosssssss>>>>
Blackberry icing sounds amazing! Need to make it!

Could you come up with a lemon and lavender cupcake please. Also the blackberry cupcake looks amazing.
Please make cakes based on Indian theme,green tea & red wine please
Looks so good... combining all those different textures must make it dreamy 😍 but... how on earth do you stay so slim and beautiful with all those sweets? 😂 Please do tell your secret!
Hey Jem! What do you think about using mulberries instead of blackberries? :O
Hello, can anyone help me pls! How shud I store cupcakes (for a party) after baking and frosting them if I live in a tropical country? Thanks!
Your videos always make me hungry...no matter what time it is hahaha xx
Hi Jemma, how do you find the Kenwood mixer compared to the Kitchen aid?
This cupcake decoration is gorgeous and the cupcake sponge is really awesome
I am going to have a go of making the Apple & Blackberry Cupcakes they look lovely .
What about the blackberry goo? You did not use it at the end
These look incredible, and so tasty. I love to bake and this video gave me loads of cool ideas for where flavor can be infused, but theses are so fiddly. This why bakeries like yours exist! Happy to buy these from pros like you, lol.
you looked so sexy when you are baking something
Omg 😍😍😍 I need these in my life
In the southeastern US blackberries are ripe in late June-early July.
I love your shows

I was just craving for some apple crumble!
Does your mixer have light on it?! Oh my goodness..I need that!
Jemma has sacrificed her thumb to the baking gods! This means we will have good bakes for a brief moment until the next sacrifice by someone else!
OMG those are gorgeous and I bet they taste AMAZING. Totally want to make these!!
Looks yummy! Owww on the thumb--I'm always grating my fingertips, so I know how you feel. I have to try putting apple and blackberry together--don't know why it never occurred to me before.
Hello how would you make that recipe in to vegan
Think this one will be as popular in our house as the jammy dodger one, fruit crumble cupcakes winner winner. Thank You Jemma.
Hi Jemma! Thanks for all your videos, they're great inspiration for me. I wanted to ask you whether you could do a basics series. That would be awesome. Thanks again.
These look so yummy! And the potato ricer trick is inspired!
Jemma I heard recently that you don’t do apple picking in the uk, and I am devastated for you. But.. do you have apple cider donuts? Because that’s the best part of apple picking, the apple cider donuts. \nWhat I’m saying is you should make a video on apple cider donuts. 😊
Hey Jemma, love your vids. I know you love using tea infusions. Please try using Rooibos tea. South African product, it's life changing.
I think that the quality of the video is not as good as before
You know she's a pro because her mixer has a ring light
Poor thumb! \nI feel a little better about slicing my hand with a French mandolin now. Not by much because it hurt like a mother. But a little.
Hi Jemma! I am a huge fan, I recently started a small baking business and you are an inspiration. I am always surprised by your flavor combinations and I have tried dozens of your recipes, they always turn out splendidly! Thank you!
These look yummy! I've never mixed apples and blackberries before so I will definitely give it a go..\nBut I have a question: instead of apple, could I use raspberries or other berries for this recipe or do they have to much water? I'm a little worried that I would squeeze out all the flavour (I hope it makes sense because I'm not that good in English)
Is there an American alternative for golden syrup that isn't corn syrup?
good job need to try someday
hi jemma I like apple and i love your cupcake
I love love love this yesss, so beautiful and I bet it taste AMAZING. never thought about blackberries and apples!
Gemma cupcake do you have any recipe with fresh pomegranate or maybe custard apples please
I'm having a shitty day, Jemma. Hearing your voice and watching you bake brings me joy. Thanks for being you.
What a brilliant idea to use a potato ricer!
these videos get me through the week !! thanks jemma for your baking creativity and expertise ♡☆
JEMMA THIS IS TRENDING IM SHOOK. also this look so so so yum
I won’t lie, a ring light on the arm of a stand mixer seems like the most extra, ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen, that’s probably a huge improvement on user friendliness.
Can someone convert the ingredients for me in US metrics?:)
I love your straight forward approach and quick format!  Keep on baking!
(Silently cursing why I live 1 continent away from C&D).. This looks sooo amazing, I want 1 RIGHT NOW!!
My favourite dessert in cupcake form! 😱 x
Hey jemma, you didn't state the quantity of flour in your cupcakes in the description box.
I visited your shop on Saturday, and I was so happy to see all the cupcakes! Thanks so much for such a great experience😘
Gemma!!!! Please make an amazing coffee cupcake!!!! I beg you!!!!!!
hi Jemma i just wanna ask if you can also feature on how to make a french macarons..=)
It took me longer than i care to admit, to realise that it wasn't a siren that was going off in every video, it was Jemma opening the oven!
Yum! The compote filling is such a lovely addition.
I love your top! Where is it from?
Do you think this recipe could work with peaches and blueberries?
That’s looking delicious! Will give it a try👍🏻
Did anyone else think the pink buttercream looked like ham?
Hey Jemma.  How do you stop all the fruit sinking to the bottom
How could I make this vegan?
Will it make a blackberry hater like me like them?
I reckon it would be a great cupcake Jemma but too much work for me. I might make the cakes and ice them with a caramel buttercream ( your recipe of course). I love your channel. And your carrot cake is THE BEST.
Omg yummmmm!!! I never would have thought of that combo with the apple and blackberries 😲💯😍👐👏🎉
All these added sugar is bad for your health please keep that in mind when consuming such creations
Hi , if I don't have a potato riser what can I use or do? Thanks
Now this is how you fucking make a trailer
The first german series on netflix. Lets see ....
So... is this gonna be a movie or a series?
Woah this looks visually stunning!
I am ready!!!
Let me guess something Stephen King related
Ha, called it. Knew it'd be when.
As a person who loves shows like Stranger Things, I still don't see the resemblance and it feels more like IT (and just a tiny bit of Riverdale) to me to be honest...
So kids go missing\nWith Netflix that means only one thing,\nThey're trapped in the Upside Down!
This reminds me of a book I've read Black River by T.J. MacGregor which the antagonist kidnaps children from different timelines.
That looks like some good shit right there. Good shit. Right there right there If I do say so myself and I say so
OK, guys, before the movie is released on Dec. 1, guess the answer to the question: When?
I'm pretty sure the question of who kidnapped the kids is gonna come up a few times, and be important to the plot.
Love the use of typography!
German or English?
Now this is interesting! I love mystery kind of movies/show so yeah
This looks epic; is it in English tho?
I wish this was just a trailer for an episode of new season of black mirror
damn son. please find some nasty asian movie, those are hardcore too.
Nope, too late at night for this, Netflix. I'll come back in 10 hours.
I pressed like before I even watched the video
fun for all the family.
So, is this produced in English or will this be subtitled?
Its giving me black mirror and the returned kind of vibes don’t know why though
Can't wait to watch both Dark and Bright on Netflix!
Okay you have my attention.
It looks like Saw 😱
Yeah my birth day........... does that say something
sold. I'll have to read this with subtitles
Anything with time travel, I'm in.
Netflix has a lot of horror films coming out this month and I'm excited for all of them
What If Doc Brown was a Weeping Angel?\nSOLD!
Now this looks interesting.
Could be the next stranger things or it could be shit I'm gonna give it a chance
I've been waiting for this for quite sometime now
Me likey!
Jigsaw reborn...😁😁😁
Oeh Nice
DERK
So intense.
mal ne deutsche netflix produktion
looks kinda mad
I'VE BEEN WAITING A YEAR SINCE THE FIRST TRSILER I'M SO EXICTED
Like it If you are also watching this video in 2036.
This is what tpicals film
FNGHD DGTD BD
twin peaks vibes
Uumm, yea...
Fucking Pennywise.
Netflix is straight ass
Um, what?
Stranger Things + time travel
se ve genial aaaa
Can't wait !!!!
December 1
Fuck yes
Gosh darnit Netflix I can't take your awesomeness any more!
FUCK YES
JOLLY TIMES
yesss! I've been waiting!!!
ZZZZZZZZ
German Broadchurch? Yes please.
Looks promising
I'm in.
Es geschah am hellichten Tag, ich bin mal gespannt. (I'm curious.)
An article called it 'noir', i'm in!
Ok 1953, 1986 and 2019 - there's a pattern here, a 33 year gap between these dates. This definitely means something, maybe these timelines are running parallel to each other?
Okay, you have my attention.
Mixture of The OA and Stranger Things
This looks interesting
interestinggggggg
Stranger things + It
Netflix, why you're doing this to me? Too many great shows, i can't keep up , my older cousins can't stop talking how their 90's childhood were better compare to mine , Niggas please,  you didn't have netflix back then
Dammit! Another Adam Sandler movie...🤔
This is fucking good damnnn
You got my attention!
This looks sick!
This looks happy and delightful
seems good
Wunderbar!
Getting Twin Peaks vibes from this.
Netflix movies usually look the same for me. I hope they stop making such movies or use a different editor at least.
Anybody know the song at 0:34?
Hey Netflix.  Have you heard of an indie game called Inside by Playdead?  If you haven't, you should go check it out, and make a series off of that.
Really? First, a move called Bright. Now, we have Dark. Can they film Dim?
When you really want to empathize that you're show is DARK
Is this going to be in English?
Netflix I have an idea for a great show it could bring you more subscribers but nothing is free so wassup
Movie or series?
The question is not donde esta la biblioteca...
When has kidnapped the children?
Stranger Things 1.1
stränger zings or ït
Song??
is this a german production?
I don't get it..
Yo. Netflix gets a standing O from me. They are killing the movie market.
anyone knows the German song ?? the one at the end
Wow Stranger Things season 2 looks great!
congratulations Netflix on another piece of shit
Viva la France
french
Your lenses ??
Love youuuuu❤️
imma go with french....alwayssssssss <3
French side
French 😍
French side ftw
French!!!!!!
French side!
She repeats everything so much😂
Both are pretty😍😍😍😍
French
french!! 😍😍
you know christen, French people have brushes and they even have television, cars and wifi... just saying
Wow! Both are amazing but I like the french side the most <3
The French reveals her true inner Beauty! :-)
Vs BRITISH 😂 they KAKE their face like a drag queen/clown
I didn't know I was doing French makeup lol love the two makeup differences.  we are so extra highlights to the gods  😂 you kill me!
I like French more
the whole time she was doing her intro, it was trippin me out
You looked soooo fresh and naturally beautiful with the french makeup. I love it 💄
American looks more sexy / powerful while French looks more charming / sophisticated. Both are pretty cool ♥
american one is more appropriate for night out while french one is more like everyday makeup look
Are you wearing contacts? If so, where did you get them? They’re gorgeous!
the French know what works.
I really like how you did your brow on the french side ❤❤❤
Wow i really like the Franch side😢😍 it's make you even more beautiful  and natural whith no efforts on the other hand the Amrican side gash that is exactlly the standred make up in middle east I'am shocked😲that you used the samd bold extra make up like us i thought you much softer anyways we all at the same bage here😙
American side is very bold eye, nude lips, but french is nudeish eye part but bold lips, its basically the opposite xD
You are so beautiful. This comes from the bottom of my heart.
Lol not all Americans do their makeup like that. Not every American person who wears makeup piles their makeup on. A lot of American women/men, who wear makeup, wear a subtle amount of makeup
wow this is so neat! both sides are beautiful.
Wow us Americans gotta tone it down! French side is BEAUTIFUL
First time watching her and she’s amazing
You are so pretty
The french makeup looks so refreshing and natural
I love how softer looks the french side.
Do phillipphines makeup vs American or Australia ❤️
Love love love that french side!
Right side looks like korean makeup !
I think the French side looks like sommer ray but without the red lips. Anyone else?
This was so interesting and refreshing to see something different. Thank you
America is a continent. Plis be respectfull.
Love the French look, but am stuck with having to do the American look.
My makeup is pretty much exactly French except with the blinding highlight
I just realised why I always think American beauty gurus are so extra - it's because I'm European😂
omg the french one is BEAUTIFUL
I loved the french side😍
The french makeup is sooo much prettier... also it DOES look like Korean makeup haha
Am I the only one wondering what colored contacts she's using?
I’m French but I don’t wear any makeup but I the French side could really help
I just realized I've been doing my everyday makeup like french. I never watched or knew anything about french makeup but my everyday makeup is my personal likings and preferences and I'm so shookt to the core while watching the french side. I'll never regret I watched this even though I'm supposed to go to bed now. OMG
im american and I just realice that everyday I do the french makeup, howww
You look like Katy Perry on the American side.
You should do a viedio on the Dermacol foudatian 💗💗
what contact lenses is she wearing? anyone know?
I feel like I could see every pore on the American side. The simplicity of the French side distracted away from the imperfections
The American side is more for parties, I don't ordinarily see people wearing that heavy of makeup everyday, esp on the eyes. Who the heck wears falsies everyday?
The French Makeup look suit you very good!😍😨
I'd prefer french side, you look beautiful with that one
French looks like Angelina Jolie, American looks like Katy Perry. Both are very pretty but I personally go with a natural look I just never look good in red hehe
i prefer the french side, i love the dewiness with the bold lip
Can't get over how pretty the french side looks.
I love both sides but French put the same thing has Americans I’m French
I like the French one more.
I'm french and this is exactly how I do my makeup! you're good!
I love makeup so much but I also hate it at the same time. Makeup is supposed to enhance your natural beauty but we use so much stuff that makes us look like a total different person. Is a hate love relationship thing lol
I like the French
French makeup is so natural, I love american makeup but French makeup is so natural and refreshing it looks so beautiful, and you nailed it if I didn’t know you honestly I’d actually think you were French, cause you look French 😂 I miss France ☹️
Wow I’m loving the French makeup 😻 If I wore makeup that would definitely be my go to style
OMG you are so beautiful without make up on!
Both are beautiful! Both for different occasions. Since I'm a high school student, I do a similar version on of the French for everyday as it's simple and Faust. But use the American  look for going out/ pictures.
I much prefer the French!
The French side is so beautiful! So fresh and radiant.
I've been doing make up like the french I guess.
I do mine like the French actually and I didn't even know their was a style of make up . I just never felt like the bolder type of make up suited my face xl or I need to practice it haha!
The French side is more of my speed now!!! Thanks for showing me this! It's so effortless and simple! Specially since I'm about to become a mommy I don't need a full beat glam look on most days!
Guys gravitate towards American because it's more porn like. I don't mean that as an offense. Porn-stars are usually beautiful plus they have prominent makeup to draw attention. The French side looks more 'sophisticated'.
2:22 is when the video actually starts.
Mostly French doesn't focus on they eye
Why is America always so extra
I lived in France for a while and I like the one french one more 😂
The American side makes you look older
Someone PLZ NAME THE SONG
I'm in love with the French side. I'm gonna do my makeup like that tomorrow (:
I am French and I love your Makeup French and American 😋
Omgosh, can you do a separate video on full French make-up??
Honestly French side is more pretty and makes your natural beauty stand out
God your voice is amazing 😍 I could listen to it all day! (Not in a creepy way at all) 😂 I just clicked this video and it's the first one I've seen and I love you! You seem so sweet!!! 😊
I love the french side lol my daily makeup looks really similar to it
The French side reminds me of Sophie Ellis-Bextor
French side is look like megan fox
FRENCH ONE I’’M MORE INTO
she looks like a young mila kunis !!!! Love it
OH MY GOD SHE LOOKS LIKE JO FROM GREYS ANATOMY
I prefer the French
Yay thank you for this video. I’m new to this channel. I always found it hard to do my makeup and follow beauty guru’s who do full coverage makeup and it just wasn’t me. The French makeup is so simple and is so me. You can’t believe how happy I am to have found this video.
I feel like everyone is saying they love the French makeup and bashing the American because they are just trying to have an opinion that is different and not be mainstream, when in reality the entire comments section is saying that.
I rather the French one,is so natural 😍😍😍
What mascara did she use on the lower lashes for the American side?
Remember Steam users, please!
I love how this is trending with only 80k views.
I hear Spielberg is in talks to direct the 3rd season opener. Really hope he does it. Would be a [literal] return to his 80s roots.
Is this an actual game or just a fun little animation?
*I have to play this, thank you for the video because this is the first time I have heard of it*
Where can I find the 13th heart?
See the gameplay of this in\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z4sjJJnFjy4
This is an app for android and iOS.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bonusxp.legend
To everyone asking, the game is an app, available on iOS and Android.
Is this gonna be a real game?
I need this in my life.
Its hard to search for it in the play store. I downloaded it after clicking links that directed me to it in the store. Uninstalled it because im werry of its access.
LOL this trailer just spoiled me a lot, I just started watching
If they make a stranger things game, I don’t want it to follow the shows plot. I’d want it to be a completely original story.\n\nedit:unless this already is an original story
Lol wat I have more subs than this company:0
this looks just like Zelda!
I almost blew up my hand playing with dry ice.
Here before this blows up, it's only a matter of time. This looks awesome, but please, please, PLEASE don't make a bad game adaptation! We all want to see a good quality game and not something rushed and thrown together just to earn some quick money.
Omg want.\nDoesn't it come out Halloween?
I want a stranger things game similar to Friday the 13
where can I find it and bring it to the Nintendo switch
Less than 300 likes and 27 comments but it’s on trending?!?!??! \nOk YouTube
Interesting:)
YES
what's the name of the game called
Hi
Who else hit start.😁?
What a game!!👍
Looks great! But please...pretty please. Bring it to the Nintendo Switch?
Here before this blows up.
I'm here before this blows up. I made an it parody check it out ❤️

I need this to happen

So freaking cute! It's like holding a baby you're scared to drop... 🤣
Cute what do u do with all ur other creations? ❤

How does curing work for uv resin? How long should it be in the lamp or flashlight?
can you do a tutorial on how to turn the resin pieces into charm? (for like keychain, necklace, etc) thanks! BTW, love all your resin pieces... so cute!
Your creations are cute but please take care of your cuticles on your fingers being that the camera is so zoomed in we can see all of the dryness in your cuticles
I love all your small creations there all so cute
A guy who makes adorable figurines without shame...... Marry me now.
I accidentally kill every living I own so I have a pet cactus cause it's hard to kill those XD
I love your videos and sculpting style. But...\n\nCLAY POLYMER HAMSTERS \n\nPlz and thx
You're videos are sooo cute! the mini creations Are adorable!
Could you do a Pluto or a Luna?!
Is there a reason you left the bubbles in the resin? Just asking cause I watched this with the volume off and wasn't sure. Other than the bubbles this is super cute 💚💚💚
Its sooooo so cute! you also could have added some black sand to make it like the pot has soil in it !! Just an idea!! So cuteee!
How do you minimize bubbles in uv resin?
.🍎 .
It's like the cactus is wearing a hat :3 Adorable ♡
What do you do with all the stuff that you make?
He should do a resin charm colection!
This is so cute!!!! Great work!!!!

So precious!! I love the resin/clay creations! Using both just gives it so much more depth 🙂
This is so good! The fact that it's translucent makes it even better!!! Btw I have two channels that I use. One is called SuperSmashPikachu5 (this one) and one is called Jacob Hopper (the one with a mamegoma icon. But I'm still the same person commenting

My brother says this mean to me he does better than you because you are bad at art
DID ANYBODY ELSE NOTICE 2:12. And here i'll just add 6 petals...... there where only 5...
Hey Alex! I really appreciate tho tutorial, as those type of cacti have my state's national flower. Just a few things though: \n\nYou've made a suguaro cactus, which are super common in lower Arizona, northern Mexico, and just barely southern California. The flowers are *white* and bloom every summer to almost any age of cactus that has an arm (they grow one arm every ten years, and live to be 100+ years).\n\nI'd really appreciate if you could do another suguaro, but with white flowers because that's their colour. \n\nIf you wanted to keep the pink flowers, prickly pear cacti have yellow flowers and barrel cacti have pinkish orange flowers.
Sorry polymodal I like it when you're not talking is makes its faster sorry not to be mean or rude I'm really sorry🙀
If your original 21 games go missing, note you can always restore them by clicking Kernel in HakChi then choosing flash original kernel.\nThe way I kept all original games while also adding new games to the system is by including all original stock games in my sync in HakChi.\nYou can download a version of the tool with all stock games included in the following link if you would also like to do it this way:\nhttps://mega.nz/#!FUk0XapI!PQj1BEuQxgUo-FNTeGs5mPEqhKXn4wZpAvXh1LYG6Fg
will NES roms work on SNES Classic?
Where do I get the games from? Will I get in trouble if I download the roms? Any suggestions on what safe websites to download the games? And is it only for a desktop computer or can I use my PC laptop?
any idea why i get error c7 for star ocean and sd?
i wait for a simpler method. Way to many steps. If i do one thing wrong it's goodby snes mini.
is this the same in the uk ....mine just says snes not found sorry....press enter to cancel this action????.....wtf
Maybe when I get an extra one I'll try this. I don't want to risk erasing my snes
will this method work for a mac?
can i hack  super famicom mini with this?
Where can I get some nice Game Roms??
Very important question: seeing the Snes/Nes Classic Edition uses a Linux Open Source, that's mean that 'theoretically' we can use even other files, besides roms? I would like add abobo's big adventure as a game
But can it run (Crysis) Music or Video?
Im good, makes the value of the original product lesser.
i never get passed the message installing driver.. the cmd popup, tells me its installing the nesmini.inf on usb_driver then it says press enter to exit the installer... when i do nothing happens
Are the gamesaves still on there??
It will work on the Super Famicom Classic Mini too I guess?
Anyone know where to get a good snes game cluster?
Thanks Sullator! Great info..
I hope that whoever makes this hack program will also add additional screen-filter options that can be selected in the SNES Classic options menu. The two non-filtered options look terrible due to pixelation, and the CRT-filter is overdone, and while better than the no-filter options, is still not a good presentation of the games - especially when playing the SNES Classic hooked up to a PC monitor. There are some good filters done in other emulator programs. Maybe one of them can be added to the SNES Classic via this hacking tool?
i've tried this just right now : two error encountred (fr product and fr roms) : when flash the custom kernel : The kernel is already patcher or it's an unknown revision. (MD5 checksum is unknown)\n\nand C7 error when i tried to launch games (Sailer Moon & James Pond (girlfriend request). any idea ?
Anyone have a link to some roms to download?
Can I get a link to your desktop wallpaper??
Nice job. I think you can automate all of these steps from hackchi. It will be interesting to see updates, loved this video.
Hi Skullator, where can I find .sfc games, or do you have more games now formatted for the SNES mini?
You might want to run a batch script instead of invoking the cmd every time...
Just gonna wait for some OCD nerd to convert it all and share the files/data lol
Since it's an *early version* I am going to wait for a while.
Also will this work with a MacBook?
i just want  to  an uni racer and turtles in time
Can you add a super gameboy rom to this system to play gameboy games?
@skullator can you up your custom kernel and post a link with all the games you have on yours so far?
Can you play Nes games on the Snes mini ?
But can it run Crysis?
Everything works fine except the 2 player controller does not work on the new games that are 2 player.\nnba jam, ken griffey jr baseball, killer instinct
Thinking about giving this a crack on a mac (hahaha), is there anything different you think in need to be aware of? Love video btw... very well explained and seems easy to follow!
Is there a way to add Super Mario bros classic game on SNES MINI CLASSIC?! Thank you.
chrono trigger crashes at the town square
Too much of a pain. Want be buying SNES mini yet. I do have an original SNES with wildcard and a ufo 9 sd copy. To be fair the pi emulator is not bad plus as more to offer
11:11 - doesn't even use find and replace :p
Привет мэдмонкей и кластеру)))
not getting past dump. driver wont install
yis
Gonna buy mine later :)
Fantastic tutorial.
Nice screen saver dude
Any Linux tools instead of WinDoze?
I love my sneeze mini
👀
Is it good to do this now or wait? I'm not very good wth these things and I've read there will be an easier way to do this?
I cant play 2 player games for any roms i download. Only the original 21 games work as 2 player. Please help?
wooohoo I added 60 more games and works great. The Lost Vikings, Chrono Trigger, Wild Guns, Prince Of Persia, ISS Soccer , Dr. Mario, TMNT back in time, R Type , Final Fight 3...and so on
Are u Australian? Sorry just asking cause I am n have a channel too. Nice vid man!!!
does this work on windows 10? because i'm having trouble with getting cmd to load python36
Where did you get your desktop wallpaper? Mind posting a link?
Followed these instructions to the letter and everything works great! Well, except for folders/pages on mine, changed to just show all games on the home screen and no more C8 errors. :D\nI can't seem to get Illusion Of Time/Gaia working though, from multiple sources/roms. Has anyone had any luck with this one?
Please stop calling it Snes it is S-N-E-S ;D terrible to hear that ^^
your video left me stuck on where i opened up the hackchi.exe. Am i suppose to plug in my snes mini before i open it up because it doesn't show any games what so ever.
Nice to see your work getting mentioned in these hack articles mate getting your work noticed.
Epic im gonna go try this!
It works!\n\nI tried a few games and all of them work except the background music of a lot of games is acting up, like a cd that skips. Playing most games work flawlessly, except for 1 or 2 games that seem to lag when you run too fast.\nAlso, when I dump or flash a kernel, the light of the SNES turns on while step 4 in the process says that should not be the case. It does complete whatever it's doing so I guess it's alright. Between dumping the original kernel and flashing the custom kernel I reconnected the SNES. The light turned on again while flashing, but it completed without issue. I also checked if I could go back to my own original kernel and that works fine also.\n\nIt's a bit of work to put in for each game, but once they're on there, they're on there and I don't need an extra 100 games, just my personal classics. Ahhh Prehistorik Man :D\n\nThank you for the tutorial! :)
thank you Mr.Aussie!
Nice tutorial. I want that background also
How the heck do you hook up the SNES mini to your computer to get the hacks?! What cord do you use?
Where can I find that sweet desktop wallpaper of Link and Zelda? Also what is the name of the song at the end?
Can't wait to try this one. Got my Snes Mini just a few das ago. Thanks a lot for the effort man!
I might wait until the easier method comes along :)
Anyone got an easy way of doing this on mac without needing a virtual windows environment?
I'm giving away an SNES classic, check it out!!
My Australian version SNES Mini is being held by US Customs. 😥
Cool but I'll hold off for a bit should be soon for this to become atomic like hakchi  is get covers etc... good work to the people that got this working 😎😎
if i use your link for the snes roms, what abuot save states and other saves? since i cant seem to find how to get my own games dumped with the auto folder? pretty confused since the games were never dumped? never owned a nes mini so new to this.
Thanks for reminding me how crappy these old games are and why I DONT want one of these consoles.
Does this work with Super Famicom Mini? Anyway to do this for the JP version?
Will there be Game Genie support
We didn't compress the .sfrom file?
Lost all the original games, please help
Do all roms work?
ok, error mate, when i try write my custom kernel, i get CANT WRITE TO USB, any ideas whats going on ? its does a few steps first then when it tires to write the actual kernel i get the above said error
I cannot proceed this further than the Sync Games. I could dump the kernel, flash the custom kernel - that was all fine. The driver installed correctly for that. But when I boot the mini NOT in diagnostic mode but just switching it on normally for game sync I can't get passed the Turn your NES Mini on.. dialogue. Hitting Install Driver from there pops up a command line NES mini not found, sorry. Any ideas?
cant add more than 30 games for some reason?
I added 4 custom games. 1 image works but 3 of them don't appear on the SNES. It is in png. Does it have to be a specific KB size?
Games load fine but I've lost all sound both in the loaded games and the originals anyone know how to fix this?
i have a secont Problem, it worked to install the game i want but if i install it on the snes the 21 games are away, if i dump original kernel i dont have the game i installes, so how can i have the 21 games AND the new one i installed?
ok i did it but it took a long time is there any shorter way of doing it
Does this method work for all serial number ?
This is awesome, but a TON of work to do for each individual game...
Can you put the link for the updated easier version in the description.
Does this work for Mac users?
Love your wallpaper, can you share the link ?
Is it possible to replace games already on the system? If so I'd want to replace Super Mario World with Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World (seriously why the hell didn't they do this???) when I eventually get my own SNES Mini
2 player works now with hakchi intern converter, but snes mini freezes when i press down in the game selection (fastsave mode). Please please help! I allready tryied reflash, only stock kernel works fast save mod.
(sigh) i made sure python was installed on the c drive and yet the command prompt still cant find it on  there, on the verge of putting the dump back on and saying screw it =(
what is the outro music?
Awesome video! I have to ask though... why do you pronounce 'E' as 'I' and 'I' as 'E'?
when i open hakchi it only shows one game on the left under priginal 30 called bioworm.. no real games on the left side. any idea why?
I'm not expert in computer stuff. It's quite too difficult for me. I'll have to wait for easier way to install my favourite Snes's roms.
Could u add all the nes and SNES games on the SNES mini so all is on just one system ?
dont worke isntalled the programm run cmd it says WRONG NAME OR NOT ON YOUR COMPUTER i installed it on C: dont worke BULLSHTI!
you need more subs
Wow!  I wanted a Snes Mini just for Star Fox 2 but I never tought it was worth it since it's very expensive here in Brazil.  But after watching your video I really want one!  That's amazing!  Thank you!
How did you do in the test? Leave a comment!\n\nCouple weeks left to get this round of merch:\nhttp://merch.andrewhuang.com\n\nGIVEAWAY WINNERS!\nMoritz Mader\nPeter Choi\nLinus Würfel\nFélix Vandeneycken\nRida Shahdad\nJune Pilote\n\nFollow me here to catch the next giveaway:\nhttp://twitter.com/andrewhuang\nhttp://instagram.com/andrewismusic\nhttp://facebook.com/andrewismusic\n\nThanks for watching :)
The entire study is moot if you're not using recordings of actual instruments.
So proud of getting these all right! Only instrument I've ever played is recorder (but I have been listening to music/singing my entire life)
*I  T H I N K  I  D I D  B E T T E R  T H A N  R O O M I E*
I actually got all of them right, yey\nBut if I had had to solve it completely on my own it might have turned down another way, who knows :)
Lol I have absolutely no idea how music works but still got all of them right.
I got them all right, but no one cares!! :D Hooray for me!!
I got all right!!! 5 years of trumpet in a jazz band and 10 years of guitar have paid of!!!!(for the first and last time ever)
I got 5
Ayy I got em all right
Yay I got them right :D :D Tbh I did replay each one ahahaha
It could be an electric guitar if...
Yay, got em! Never went back and changed any of my answers after hearing the later sounds, only had to rewind once and that's because my first instinct for piano was nylon guitar, but then my brain screamed at me immediately after I said it out loud so I had to stop the video, deal with some internal conflict, listen again and finally change my answer. You have increased my musical confidence by 2%! Thanks!
Where is the electric guitar meme?
It could be an Electric Guitar if your rip out the insides, tape a tablet to it and charge it.
Rob has probably played all of these instruments already, that's why he knows them all.
How did I get them all right? I'm not that great of a musician, if you'd even call me that...
Wow, I actually got all correct, feeling kinda proud of myself :D
Genuinely got all of these right! Not without pausing the video and questioning myself though...
I got them all right some how! awesome
Holy shit, i'm 15 and play I can only play sax and basic things on a piano and i got 6/6 easy.
I got everyone right. Surprised myself with that one.
It could be an electric guitar if it djented
I got all of them right!
ROOMIE'S NAME IS JOEL????
YOOOOOOO I GOT THEM ALL RIGHT. I'm hella confused now. I thought this was really easy.
I got all right without like any problem? Is this supposed to be hard, feels so staged even though it most likely isn't, just because it was so easy for me.
Got them all right.
This is very easy- you can believe me or not but I think they are pretending like it's harder than it is. Or maybe it's just me.
I got them all and I’m not even a musician lmao
i got em all right yay
i got them all right yay im only a junior in highschool band in percussion no less so i barely even practice with winds and we have no official string section
I found this really easy but I'm sure my many hours using Sibelius helped a lot.
6 out of 6, not too shabby
ROOMIE'S REAL NAME IS JOEL?
I managed to get all of them right!
Yeah this would've been way easier if it weren't shitty midi instruments.\nCrap test.
I got all of them
I got um all correct and I'm 12
oh my fucking god i got all of them right what does it mean???
how am i getting these all right? please help, i'm scared.
Did it feel good though? -IDubbz
I had those headphones and they were my absolute favorite. Apparently they were my dog's favorite, too. he chowed down on them in no time.
I got that shit right
10 hour loop of Roomie saying Cello with a confused face please.
I got all of them. Perks of being in high school pep band. There are very few.
I got them all right but I don't feel confident that I would have guessed cello without hearing cello guessed. certainly I would have failed if I didn't know what the instrument choices were ahead of time, wow
100%! I'm so proud of myself! Where's my A+, Andrew?
I have people texting me rn but it's really confusing because the text tone is the same note as the samples!!!
only one person got them all right... it was me xD
I got like 3/6 right
I don't get the challenge, I named them all correctly without much trouble.
I got them right, except for switching round the cello and the trumpet - and I'm not musically trained at all!
I got all of them right, and my hearing is bad, so I'm just smugly satisfied right now
It's cello, not jello
It could be an electric guitar if you took a new born yak and threw it into a vat of nylon
I wasn't really expecting this but I got them all right. I had thought that the piano sample was the nylon guitar until I heard the nylon guitar at the end then switched my answer.
This video could be a nylon string guitar for all I know
I gotta thank my sponsor from the inside of this Unicorn head.\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!\nI haven't laughed like that at a dumb sight gag in a long time! Thank you Andrew! :)
Actually got them all correct
I got 5 out of 6
Would have been good if you could have played the entire note at the end to really hear the difference.
If they weren't talking for it, I probably would've got some more of them, they kept making me doubt myself
So I got these all right, but first I had to look up what a nylon guitar was. I figured out it was just a string type of acoustic guitar, other than that the test was fairly easy. \nI don't mean to brag or anything, I am actually confused myself, maybe its because I like to do this sort of thing a lot. A lot of the time its to find the original sounds that were modified to fit an EDM type track, or what a sound from an NES/SNES/N64 is supposed to be mimicking. I mean this is the only logical reason why someone who doesn't know a lot about music would be good at recognising an instrument. (I mean if you asked me to recognise a pitch or note just by hearing it I wouldn't be able to do that.)
it was clear, that rob win this
Woohooo I got them all right! 😁 I paused the video before hearing any other guess so I didn't cheat. 😊
I actually went through this test, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I got all of them correct. The one I had trouble with was the cello because, out of all these instruments, it's the least of heard. I'm proud that I know my tones as well as I do. c:
It could be an electric guitar if... Rob Scallon 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's make this a meme, People!!
Well, I failed miserably. And I play the clarinet. At least the piano is unmistakable.\n1: It's an electric guitar.\n2: Wait, that's an electric guitar. The first was a clarinet.\n3: No, that's an electric guitar. The second was a nylon guitar.\n4: That's a piano. Definitely a piano.\n5: I have nothing...\n6: Wait, that's a nylon guitar. Wait, then what was the second one?
Guessed all of them right!
TIP (for next time): if you number the instruments, and at the and tell the results it becomes easier for us watching to check if we got it right. ;) \nex: 1.cello, 2.piano, 3.trumpet, etc... result (played in this order):  4.clarinete,  5.electric guitar, and so on...
Wow, Andrew Huang has the same taste in music creators that I do... Neat.
I got 100% :D
I got 100%
yeah boiiii got them all right
I got 6/6 😀😀😀
TRUMPET IS BRASS.
6/6!
Easy peasy! Got 'em all right :)
4/6
OMG I actually got ALL correct!!!! :D
got em all right
Roomie saying Cello made me laugh so hard
They all sound like Otomatones!
6/6 boys
I got 100%
*whispers* cello...
Got all 6 right, yay
Cello 5 \nPiano 4\nTrumpet 6\nClarinet       1\nElectric guitar 3 \nNylon guitar 2

Well....that test was weird-ly easy.
Yes Maybeline! Yes LAGIRL! Yes L'Oréal! Yes Nyx ! Yes thank you for catering to us dark skin girls. Hopefully other brands would wake up! \nYou look beautiful Nyma😘
you look stunning Nyma!
I don't know if they make your shade in the fit me dewy, but the fit me dewy is really nice for drier skin
I love what you play on the background.....
I love that gloss on you! Girl you are just always glowing
the lipstick looks so good on you 😍
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
let’s take a moment to just appreciate your look right now 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾♥️
With YOUR pretty melanin self!! Love you girl...❤❤❤❤
In which shade did you have the maybeline fit me
Every time I watch one of your videos or see your Instagram I literally cannot get over how beautiful you are 💕💕💕
Where can i find L.A. Girl brand at??
Girl, why my dry skin doesn’t look like yours? You’re glowing, I just look dehydrated 😂
Had to click cuz of that glow, but I have oily ass skin so I need all mattifying  stuff
I saw the thumbnail for this video and just wanted to stop by to say you have the most beautiful skin color :0\nyou look like a doll
I love watching your videos! Your makeup is literally flawless!!😍💓
There's 2 types of the fit me foundation. One matte, one dewy.
You're skin tone is absolutely stunning!!!! 😍😍😍🍫
U look like a delicious chocolate bar I just want to bite into...and I'm sooooooooooo not a lesbian. Keep up the good work hun ☺️☺️☺️
The first 2 are my holy grail right now (LA Girl in White and L'oreal W4, I combine them because I don't find my shade where I live...) Love your videos Nyma 😘
I love you chicka! I just saw you on Harry. I was screaming that's my girl!!!!! I am biased though, you look just like my future daughter in law. Keep up the great videos.
Girl what is that lip? ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You look so beautiful here. Youre always pretty but today your glowing
There is a dewy + smooth fit me instead of the matte + poreless! i'm not sure if the shades are the same though
Hey Nyma I would love to see a video of you trying the darkest shade of Huda Beauty foundation
You are so beautiful nyma 💞 much love from Florida ❤️
As an oily girl I LOVE the LA Girl foundation
This makeup look you are wearing in this video is life!!
Can you do a make up tutorial video for the look you have in this video? You are beautiful.
You are so beautiful! I found you through your Fenty review and I'm so glad I did!!! 😍😍
OMG I just saw you on “HARRY” YouTube channel.  Congratulations for being on his show.
She's damn pretty😍❤💯 I wish I was like her😍😍😍✨
I am generally not fond of lashes\nBut I really loves yours\nIt really looks good on you
Take a shot every time she says foundation
Do they have the W10 in loreal one cause w stands for warm which would be more red which you will like. And if they also made the lumi one in 10w that you would love too
specifics on your nail color please? Thx
Yo I saw you on Harry the other day and nearly died from screaming. I'm so happy for your success
I literally love you!!
Girl I found u when when u had a lil bit of subscribers and I was so confused why u didn't have more cause ur content was amazing congrats ❤️
Girl what is that lippie?
I'm as dark as midnight myself and I don't wear makeup. But I'm glad there are options out there that don't stop at 11:30 p.m. Shout out to you, Jackie Aina, and toomuchmouth for representing.❤️❤️❤️
It would be fantastic if you could do a video on Vasanti Cosmetics MatteCrush lipstick line!!!
Although sometimes I enjoy longer videos, I like that the majority of your videos are shorter. It’s nice to get to the point and watch something without needing to commit to 25-30 minutes.
TAKE A SHOT EVERY TIME NYMA SAYS FOUNDATION 💚
my Walmart sells shades for deeper skin and toy don't know how excited I was when I walked into walgreens and they had all shades of the true match
I use the Fit Me in 360.I like it but its not really my color around my jaw line I feelbitsca little ashy. I would love to try LA Girl but they don't sale that around here 😒 #GETWITHTHEPROGRAM
Perfect! Short and to the point
You’re beautiful!😍Thanks for this video!
Can you talk about your tattoos please? I'm dark skin and been always wanting to get a tattoo but scared cause it won't show. I love your tatts
your skin looks so glowy!! 💕 sending you lots of love
What is in your lips it looks amazing!
She is so fucking beautiful I can’t 😭😍
girl you might want to adjust the white balance of your videos so your eyes don't look yellow hehe
I'm watching Nyma's videos even though I'm white. I like her personality, how she's not your typical beauty guru. I don't know, I just really enjoy watching her videos even though I'm not her target demographic. Keep up the good work Nyma❤️
GURL whats your lip i need it 👁👄👁 ❤️❤️❤️ love you nyma
You're so pretty and your voice is so soothing 😌
I deffo think that the NYX drop foundation must have a different formula for the deeper shades. I'm the lightest shade (pale) and it is super drying and is horrible on my dry skin RIP. I really enjoy your videos Nyma!!
I feel you on how it's hard to find foundations to match because I have a really yellow undertone and when I find a great one from the drugstore I think that'll match me it either turns out to be wayyy to pink on me even though it looks yellow tonish. The only one foundation that seems to match me good is milani conceal n perfect in #1 but it feels to heavy on the skin for me so that's why I'm kinda bummed out. Even the maybelline one I cannot find my correct shade 💔💔💔
This is such a great and important video!  I read online that sometimes mom and pop drugstores don’t stock darker shades because they’re afraid that people who use those shades would shoplift.
you look so gorgeous, you should do a tutorial on this look!
You always look beautiful but you look even more gorgeous than ever in this video. That glow is to die for 😍
Can you please try Malani Foundation?! It's a really great drugstore foundation for like $12. My fav by far.
You look so radiant and stunning 💕
Do you have any recommendations for oily skin? 😅 I'm personally not a fan of the Fit Me.
I know there is a lot of self-hate in the black community. But let me just say, as a light-skinned/high-yellow black woman I think you are absolutely GORGEOUS! I wish I had beautiful, rich skin like yours. Absolutely stunning! Love your vids!!! 😃
You're so beautiful❤️
Omg you're gorgeous
Ridiculously beautiful!
you’re so so gorgeous omg!!
Wow you're gorgeous 😍girl crush !!!😃
😍🍫👑

Hi Nyma, what lippie are you wearing?
BEAUTIFUL Hun😘
O.o shes so gorgeous...
Girllll you look GORGEOUS!!!😍
You're sooo gorgeous!!!! 😍😍😍
Omg she's so beautiful
This girl is a stunner
I like you and how you do your makeup, but everytime you say the foundation is dewy I really don't get it because all I see is oil. You always look super oily. That's different from a dewy glow when your whole face looks super shiny.
I saw and was hurt by the tweet. This video was wonderful and I'm so glad Hannah chose Kati to talk about it with her.
I was def one of the people who replied to your tweet disagreeing with the tweet and I think that this video did a great job of elaborating on the tweet and I now can definitely can see what the meaning was and I really agree with the message of this video. Thank you for elaborating!!
Thanks for the clarification!
I'm going to repeat what I tweeted at Hannah here:\n\nYes you CAN love someone if you don't love yourself but it's going to be unhealthy and it's not going to be true love. You are going to look for a partner that is capable of filling a void you have, or you are going to use them as an emotional punching bag. \n\nPutting yourself first is NOT selfish, it's the most amazing thing you can do. I was in a very, very dark place for many years. I believed I was too good for therapy (Eye roll) and that I could fix myself. That mindset bled into my relationships; and not just romantically. I hated myself and could not comprehend why anyone could love me, or find me attractive. I would pick fights; it made me feel better knowing that I was not the only one hurting. It was truly fucked up. It took me many years, and guess what, THERAPY, for me to realize what I was doing. \n\nI'm still battling my mental illnesses but I have help, and I feel better about myself. My relationships are profoundly healthier and I've learned that making others around me hurt like I do isn't going to help; it makes it worse. \n\nPeople are going to hate this comment, and if I was reading this five years ago, I would be too. But seriously sit and think about your relationship and what you project to others, whether it be a friendship, partnership, family members - It may not be so bad to focus on yourself.
I'm sorry people were so awful to you on Twitter\nYou are an amazing person and you deserve only good things!
Goodness people need to chill. I'm glad you covered this, and I love hearing from Kati! 💜💜💜💜
Thank you so much this helped me out alot.
I am glad you posted this! There are so many toxic relationships and it's so lonely compared to be just alone and love yourself
I was really looking forward to this video! I really appreciate your thoughts and Kati's thoughts on the matter, and I understand a lot more where you were coming from with your tweet. I do agree that a healthy relationship comes from self love and loving each other. Twitter is hard sometimes to express complete thoughts, so I really love that the discussion came to YouTube. Thank you:)
Oh god Hannah your hands are so TINY.
Thank you so much for making this video. I saw those comments and thought they were absolutely ridiculous to think you were trying to shut down the people who don't love themselves or feel like they can't. It was bizzare, I couldn't believe it because they attacked you for a quote they misinterpreted. I'm glad you bought Katie on to explain what you meant in video form. It really means a lot.
maybe you can't love someone until you love yourself should be sometimes the best way to love someone else is to love yourself instead. I feel that is closer to what people actually mean when they say it and it still sound like a motivational poster if thats what you're into
*Hannah* !!!! \n\nThis was so inspiring and amazing!\nThe content was beautiful and important.\nBut, your response to a possibility dramatic situation was so mature and  and intelligent and productive and healthy. \nI know that's a lot of adjectives but we need more content like this in the world\n\nThanks for existing!!
If someone apologized to me directly the way Hannah apologized in this video I’d be pretty upset. You can’t please everybody, so if you’re going to bother apologizing you may as well take the time to express yourself in a way that seems sincere. 🤷‍♀️ \n\nAlso, having mental illness doesn’t absolve anyone from saying inconsiderate things. Mental illness is such a broad category that it’s em hard to appreciate everyone’s individual struggles. \n\nAnyway, there’s nothing wrong with the message that prioritizing others over yourself is unhealthy. But recognizing that a lot of people struggle on the daily with loving themselves and are still duly capable of loving others won’t hurt you. Regardless of what you meant, it’s still technically what you said. Maybe blunt statements and clapping emojis on Twitter isn’t the best method of delivery next time?
I think it's absolutely possible to not totally love yourself and love someone else, but the focus shouldn't be on loving only the other person. I also don't think that the primary focus should be on loving only yorself, but on helping yourself and loving your partner at the same time. This wasn't the most articulate thing I've written, but I hpoe you understand.
Hmm. When I was diagnosed for depression and anxiety in 2002 I took you can't love others before you love yourself to mean you shouldn't try to find love. I thought I would be a burden and risk to everyone. That's a lot of time wasted in a misunderstanding.
Love this video. Great topic. One question is the background music The Doogie Houser tv show theme?
every move a sphinx kitty makes looks like it is planning to take over the world.... even climbing on a shoulder
I love that you came back and made a video about this important topic since there was so much frustration about the topic within your fan base. Appreciated! Good content!
Thank you Kati because this is so true and so people just disregard it
This is a really important topic, and I think you handled it really well.  It was really helpful to hear what you had to say about it
It's true that you definitely can love someone when you don't love yourself, but it gets so much deeper and more beautiful when you love yourself first.
I just learned a LOT about myself
Fill my void \n *That's what she said*

You made light of people who were bothered by your remarks. 🤔 this is just all over the place. Be you and find a place that makes you happy. There are no rules to happiness or love. ✌🏻❤️😊
This is an amazing video! Thank you for allowing us to sit in on such an important discussion
Good on you for taking the input and deciding to talk about it, especially with a professional. It would be easy for you to say Ah, screw it, shut up! but you chose to have this convo and dive deeper than 140 characters. Awesome, Hannah! 💚💛💜
Self love is awesome! It’s one of the first things you taught me about, and I for one do agree that you can have a relationship before you love yourself but in order to give yourself completely into loving someone else, you’ll need to love yourself so you can tell yourself that you can do that. But that’s just me, I understand other perspectives💖💖
This is a wonderful reaction to that tweet, Hannah. generally i've seen you handle it very well. It's lovely that you're willing to listen and modify an opinion!\nI've learned from this as well. I was quite opposed to your tweet seeing as my girlfriend would probably say she hates herself, definitely not love, but I also really see our relationship (by now) as a very healthy one! \nWhat Kati said about self-care being maybe a more important factor in that makes a lot of sense to me though. My girlfriend does work incredibly hard to take good care of herself, and I don't think we could do it without that. \nthis has been nice. i love you both <3
Thanks for the clarification. I knew what you meant when you posted that, and I agree with you, 100%. I've seen firsthand how insecurity and self-doubt can affect relationships in my own experiences over the years. But it's always good to clarify :)
On some days I self-love my brains out.  HAHA j/k thank you Hannah and Kati great video
My thought response to your tweet was that you’re absolutely right and that’s because my immediate thought was about those in abusive relationships. I myself have never been in one but I know people who have and what’s gotten them out of those relationships is realizing they deserve better. So I thought you do have to love yourself enough to know your worth and if you’re giving your love to someone who just makes you feel worse than it’s okay to walk away from that.\n\nSpeaking more from my personal walk of life, I have depression and anxiety and more often than not I will have days where I see myself completely worthless and I hate everything that I am but I know despite that my heart is so full and I am capable of loving someone else. \n\nHonestly Hannah I think it was a great tweet as a reminder to yourself and others who may struggle in the same way. And after some of the response I think you handled it very well. Thank you so much for this video ❤️
Wish I had two friends like you!
Great conversation! I think something that can get lost in this topic is what it seems like you were referring to a little bit in your tweet. The world is a mirror to our internal experience, and if we don't cultivate self-love we can react really negatively to facets of ourselves that we see in other people. So, while we can love others regardless, there can be pieces of them that we struggle to find love for because we are too preoccupied with our own self-loathing.
She said something about love wells. Now I wanna hear y'all talk about love languages lol
There was nothing wrong with your tweet .i think most of therapists I've seen have said this to me soooooooo............. love to ya Hanna you're awesome
I was one of the people who was hurt by your tweet but after this video I realise, I actually agree with you on so many points. So thank you for this great video :)
I think 'neurotypical' has just become an umbrella term for anyone who does not suffer any type of mental illness. Not sure if it is scientifically correct, but that's the common usage these days.\n\nalso i really liked this video, i think that quote (you cant love others til you love yourself) could definitely use some adjustments to clarify its true meaning. Kati is so great!
If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else? RuPaul says it all the time 😊
im so happy you guys made this. its sad and very surprising that you got negative feedback on your Tweet Hannah, but i love this video because I've been trying really hard over the last year or two to do exactly this; love myself (and love myself before i love someone else). its really important to me personally because I've never felt that way about myself before. thanks again guys!
Thank you for this Hannah <3 I am a firm advocate in loving yourself, but sometimes it's difficult to practice what you preach. Thanks for the reminder <3\n\nAlso I've seen people use Neurotypical to describe people that don't have any mental illness or cogntive/learning disabilities so maybe that's what they were referring to? I don't know, but I heavily disagree with wanting to promote self love as 'neurotypical'
Oh wow, this hit so close home I had to pause the video around 2.25 because it was making me cry. I'm gonna watch the rest later at home where I can cry 😂
Love this, such a good message to send out to the world <3 I find it strange some get mad at being told this, however some people find it a hard fact to accept. Thanks for making a video on this Hannah! :D
you need to learn how to love yourself before someone else trys to live you or love them
oh boy here comes a giant  too insightful comment! so i realize that i am 22 and i'm young and i think i know everything but really i know shit so take my words for what they are. I hated myself for the longest time, i started lately to begin trying to be less critical, which is not working out great but it's a start, and i have to agree with the fact that you have to love yourself to love someone else, not in the sense that you are incapable of feeling love for others, i fell in love and hated myself, it actually made me feel a bit less worthless, but it was a disaster, it wasn't mutual, i felt loved back but i wasn't and it fucking hurt, made situation even worse after. Before being with others i believe you have to decide who you want to be, maybe my mind is too old for my age but i worked out who i want to be, and i'm trying to and even if it terrifies me i'm now tired of being alone and i want friends and i want someone whom i know loves me back. Sorry it's a really interesting topic and i'm not having the best week, and i overshare on comments cause i kind of don't know if they get read or they disappear in nothingness. I'll shut up now, good video as always, hope you're doing good guys ^^.
Lovely video\nI love how mature you are, Hannah 💜
I've been struggling with this a lot recently. Just got out of my first ever relationship, which lasted 6 months, with a guy I knew I wasn't right for but who showed me love when I didn't love myself. I've had depression and anxiety for basically forever and have consistently struggled with loving myself for years. Even though we wouldn't have worked out if I was healthier, we probably would have had better times and I wouldn't have cried to him so much, asking him to show me that I was worthy of love. Got to figure out how to support myself so I don't put myself in another unhealthy relationship.
Calling Hannah neurotypical is eh... An interesting choice. Y'know, since she has ADHD, which is a neuropsychiatric disorder? I use the term neurotypical as a way to describe the alienation I feel as an autistic person in abled groups of people. I doesn't really apply to mental health overall, since that isn't necessarily related to neurodivergence.
Hanna I thought your tweet was honest like where you were at. I appreciate the video and found it very helpful, Thank you you are an impressive young lady-
Funny. I was just journaling and read some of my old entries, where I found this from a year ago: ... By self-love and self-respect, I learned to speak up. I actually learned to feel love. And let myself to be loved. I learned to open my heart, to give and to receive. To make the room for myself and for others. And forgiveness. You cannot love if you have reserved a place for hatred. \nNow, these are just my feelings, not marginalizing all people. I had a relationship before I learned to love myself and I loved my SO, and still, do even after a breakup, but it was not enough. I was never able to utter the words I love you, was always insecure about every of my movements, sentences, decisions. And it was a very childish way of the relationship, more of a friendship with occasional sex. I understand, what others come from. You can love even you hate yourself. But at least for me, you cannot love unconditionally, without fear and with comfort. There will always be some skeletons in the closet, which will burden you and your partner, therefore your relationship. Now I'm happily in love again, with the feeling stronger than me, making me say stupid things like my SO is the most beautiful person on the planet. I was never able to say such things, now I'm not ashamed of being in love, not scared of being vulnerable. Just happy to have an awesome partner in life :)
People need to get over themselves. You can't say anything on the internet without someone jumping down your throat for no reason. It's obvious what Hannah's tweet meant. Use some basic critical thinking skills and stop inventing reasons to be offended, people. #Smh
Thank you for bringing attention to something that is so important. I recently was thrown in to caring for my grandparents and the stress is unbelievable. I constantly remind myself that it's all for them to be happy. It's stressful but worth every minute I get to spend with them. And yes... We all need to take a day or an hour or a minute just to hit the reset button
I love Kati!! And I love this collab. You both are my YouTube mental health gurus. I only see my counselor once a week but I get my fill in when I need help from you both. Much love.
Thank you for showing how we all have love surrounding us in some shape or form and that we can do attitude x
I love me so much that others can easily learn from my behavior on how to love me.
i feel like what people usually mean by this comment/phrase is that people who are unable to love themselves or even find anything positive about who they are as a person usually wont accept love from another person, often pushing it away stemming from the thoughts that they arent worth it.. idk but it makes sense to me as someone who has struggled with it
Awesome, I'm not sure I can truly love myself, good to know it's not necessary to find love
A couple of points I'd like to make.\nFirst being that you are in the entertainment business first and foremost. Please remember you cannot please everyone all the time. It's impossible so that being the case please remember to give yourself some grace and professional distance from the comments you see otherwise I feel you will be second guessing yourself all the time. \nSecond point. When you have guests and/or your friends on to help illustrate a point that you point out somewhere their credentials. The whole video and in the description i kept waiting for something like, 'Hey, this is my friend _________ who is a __________ and/or is a licensed ________ who is with us today to discuss ________.'\nWithout that information to me it's just two like minded people trying to reiterate a point.\n\nAs always Hannah, luvs you since the first day I saw your videos and will continue to do so. SMOOCHES!
I think it is hard to love somebody if you can't love yourself. Cause not loving yourself will lead you to make choices that hurt yourself and therefore the relationship. You WILL hurt people.
Neurotypical is a term I have seen a lot on the internet and from what I understand it means if you are giving advice regarding mental health then you have no idea what it's like to struggle with mental illness. Being called neurotypical in this case is essentially in the same likeness as someone advocating for veganism telling people with chronic illness that they will be cured if they partake in a plant based diet. That if you drink water and get fresh air, that will cure your depression forever, that would be considered neurotypical in this case. Unfortunately that develops a very unhealthy rhetoric for people actually trying to gain self worth and recover from very self destructive behaviors. No, practicing self care is not going to cure you forever. It t won't suddenly fix the amount of dopamine or serotonin your brain may not produce on its on its own, but it can make day to day life more manageable and maybe even enjoyable. This internet culture of needing to actively be self destructive and that if you aren't your advice or experience is invalid is highly damaging. Whatever you can do, however small the act may be, to bring yourself some peace is worth it. And as someone who struggles with PTSD and depression, I can say that and still be valid. You are not broken for wanting to feel better in your own life and experience.
Great video and great message! Of course you can't fully love someone (without negative strings attached) until you love yourself (and, additionally, have been loved by others - not necessarily in the romantic sense). Someone who says they love you, when you hate yourself (not necessarily to an extreme) may be just in it for their own gain; there is a difference between reciprocal love and codependency. The *vs* part (the title) is a bit...off? To me if you were to compare the two there is already a clear difference as one is based on one person and the other is based on more than one person; love can be one-sided, reciprocal, or not love at all but a feeling that is confused as love. All of this is okay! We live, we learn. Keep 'em coming chickadee!
GIRL! ME! So true. Glad you spoke about this!
I am really impressed by the way you've taken critique lately, Hannah. I felt like your take on the subject was wonderfully nuanced and I appreciated your ability to take on other people's thoughts about self love and refine your understanding. As someone struggling with mental health issues who is in a healthy relationship with another mentally ill and also chronically ill (CFS) person, this video was a great reminder of some important things for me personally and I will definitely be having a loving conversation with my partner about this subject very soon. Thanks for the timely kick in the bum and the great video ^_^
I appreciate that you took something you said that people found controversial and did a constructive deep dive on it. You clarified without being defensive. It was a really beautiful way of communicating. Thanks :)
Kati's karma necklace tho <3  I never take mine off!
great video!.. but... is katie's shirt a bit offensive? i just got the feeling someone is going to say something bout it haha
Hannah I’ve recently accepted my sexuality as part of who I am and I want to come out to friends and family. However my family is homophobic and I don’t know what to do. I have four years until I can leave and I don’t think I can not be myself that long. I just don’t know what to do and need help.
I go to eat chocolate.\n\nLook in place.\n\nChocolate not there.\n\nRemember ate yesterday.\n\nMe and Myself are still coming to terms with loss,\nbut I love Me and Myself will forgive with time.\n\nWe both love chocolate, but must remember next time.
I love how you took a slightly questionable tweet you made, apologized, and turned it into a teaching moment! ❤️ Love you, Hannah! This video is soooo important. Thank you. 👏And thanks Katie!
Neurotypical was used by autistic people to refer to people who were non-autistic, but I have recently seen people who have other uncommon neurological conditions using the term, generally referring to those who not only aren't autistic but who are not neurodiverse in general.
Thank you for this video Hannah! I was there for all the kerfuffle over that tweet and I was torn between which side to be on. This video does a fantastic job of explaining your feelings and I gotta say you're completely right.
This is the greatest video you have ever made.
Hannah, you always put out videos when I need them most. I have always struggled with self loathing and I am trying to change that way of thinking and its really hard...do you have an tips?
Brene brown's book the gifts of imperfection has been helpful to me. She says you can only love someone as much as you love yourself. You can only accept someone's imperfections as much as you accept and allow your own
I'm so basic I shoulda been named Norm
You are so true!
What a great video💖💖Thanks for your advices Hannah,you're the best
I am constantly saying that you cannot expect others to make you happy, that it is something you have to do for yourself, and self love is a big part of that. Any love and happiness you gain from others should be a bonus, not an expectation. I also battle my own mind every day, and PMS makes it far worse (so fun when I forget to check my calendar), so this is definitely a struggle for me, but also something I try to be an example of, as much as I can, for my kids.
Sooo... Well thanks for mentioning this subject about Neurotypicals... I'm a psychologist who works with people in the Autism's Espectrum. They think I'm a NT but I don't. 😅😅 It's difficult to understand and this isn't the way to exchange information, but you were so correct, respectful and polite... Thanks. 👍🏻
Thank you. I needed this right now.
I really love this video because it talks about what I’m going through and it helped me to realize and learn what I may be feeling or experiencing. So thank you both! 💕 This is a really good topic to talk about.
I love this so much! Thank you for posting this
love is important, and this is a serious video, thank you hannah for bringing  up such an important topic.
People don't love unconditionally, otherwise they wouldn't get upset - if you are coming from a place of love, there is no place for anger. So your original message was correct, but broken people react the only way they are able to at that time in their life.
Heyy I think the problem a lot of people had w the tweet (me included) was that it seemed to simplify the issue wayyyy too much. And that it could easily affect some of your viewers who admire you and may be in self-hate places right now by making them feel defeated if self-love seems far away from them right now even if they’re on the journey. This was a great video which really gave the issue the time it needed.
i hate myself whoop z
YaSSs bitch LOVE YA SELF
Happy Sunday, thanks for watching.

I wouldn't worry about the twitter experts. Folks on that app like to think they know everything about anything that may roll into their twitter feed and they are required to spew their knowledge in the most unsavory of ways. YOU ROCK HANNAH :)

One more light has gone out, and the sky is a million times darker for it.
I cried. I haven't emotionally cried in about 3 years. I'll miss you dude.
lp is my entire childhood,i will not forget you mr bennington you in a better place now!
If the band does break, I just want you guys to know that you were an inspiration to everyone that you put an impact on. thank You Chester, you may now Rest In Peace.
Hard to breath, this is makes me sadfckin'cry!
This is stunningly amazing. How I wish Chester could see this.
Chester. U will always be remembered. I am going through a death in the family who took their own life and this song speaks to me so much and has helped me. Ive been a fan of linkin park since before they were even linkin park. So ive been listening to ur music since chester started and looked up to chester as a hero. All ur music speaks to me. Long live Chester, in our memories and our hearts
Sad thing is that I liked linkin park when I heard there song right before Chester died
i hope they make a video on halloween because it is my birthday and all i wanted to see was Chester Bennington \nand i am crying 😭 😭\n\nedit: and im only nine i just wish he didnt suicide
Who else cried during the song
Who's goin on a killing spree to kill the 1k people
3:17 sounds like he's singing from heaven
Midnight soldiers from everywhere, U.S.A. Russia, Chile, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Mexico, EVERYWHERE ON EARTH!!! REMEMBER YOU ARE NOT ALONE, REMEMBER OF CHESTER, REMEMBER THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE BY YOUR SIDE. \nDON'T LET YOUR OR ANOTHER PERSON'S LIGHT GO OUT...
This song is the same level as Johnny Cash's Hurt. Extremely powerful, moving songs that were their last. And its like they knew it. It's sad...
I am currently struggling with this issue myself,I ask myself this very same question @ least once a week. And if it wasn't for the love I have for my family I know I wouldn't be here right now
Chester will never be forgotten, he was such an inspiration to me and Many others, I was so inspired to make music because of him. When I found out about this I cried for days on and on, I was not able to move, eat, or sleep. He meant so much to me. I wish all of us couldve helped him in one way. You won't be forgotten.
If there is someone who truly cared, it would be Chester. I'll remember to the moon and back. R.I.P😥
So beautiful! Thank you for all the amazing music over the years! RIP Chester. You will never be forgotten
I saw an interview Mike did talking about how fans made this video and like some of their management wanted to pull this down and he and the band said no. They did it because this is such a haunting tribute to Chester and LP has always been about the fans and not the money.
And thank you all guys for legendaric songs, never forger the all times when 'Numb' stuck in my memory from age 7-8❤️ last time thanks for all🙏
#ALGERIA\nRip Chester 😢 We love you.  A legend never die
They say you die twice, the first time is when they bury you in your grave, and the second time is the last time somebody mentions your name, so let us never let Chester die in our hearts
Who cares if one more ligth goes out\n\n well i do💖💞💓\n\n rip chester
Y’know what they say... heroes never die.
Have a good after life Rip ONE LIKE EQUALS 1 PRAYER....I CANT SAY ANY MORE CUZ IM DIYNG  ON THE INSIDE...
I'm crying so bad I miss him so much I want him back😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Rip. The memory of Chester will never be forgotten
Best Part =>  0:00 - 4:52
*Chester never died he would always remain in this song*
Without you, i am scared 😞😞
people say self harm is for attention they dont know what it is
Ppl will still be remembering & mourning/celebrating Chester long after Tom Petty's ticker tape parade is over.  I think its over already. No offense to TP, but his time was up decades ago. Chester n LP are the Now, he was constantly current & a maverick. A fuckn legend. Not one musician of modern times can touch him.
THIS EMOTIONAL SHIT GETS ME EVERY TIME GOOD LORD CHESTER WHY DID YOU LEAVE US 😭💔
My Childhood Singer Will Never Be Forgotten Because Legends Are Never Forgotten \nRest Easy Bud.
Amazing video never seen this much fan support ....love linkin park and let's take this video to billions
Chester Bennington, we won't ever forget you...❤😭
This brought me to tears.
The worst thing about that Video is, that Chester is never gonna see it, or anything his fans do. But it helps me to know that Chester will never be forgotten😶😥
I love you Chester
i am doing some work and this was on auto play and this song comes out i had to stop 😭😭😭😢😢😢 we do... why...i miss u..miss u guys..
Holy shit this video makes this song so much more emotional when i thought it couldn't

Welcome to family and advertiser friendly youtube everyone.
could it be that a hyena fetus starts as a male but becomes a female
0:18 mike hawk made a featured comment
Beginning: I already the body parts of humans what would be a difference in animals?\nEnd: 😨😨😨😨😨😨
Did _that many_ people really ask this _THAT_ many times? \n\n_ya'll need helix..._
Hyenas are just all kinds of weird.
There's only one rational explanation: A Hyena laughed while God was walking by and God said Laugh at me will you?  Ooh, I'll show you!  Boom, psuedo penis!  Who's laughing now!
You really like hyenas do you, Kate?
͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
I still love hyenas.
the weird shit
thats just crazy. thats craaazy
That awkward moment when a hyena's clit is longer than the average human male penis
Hyena's are still my fav animals.
GREAT! Now Sankaku chan will have tons of furry images of futanari hyenas! Are you guys happy now?
they do a s**t of f*ck peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Guys can you answer me what is pseudo??
Holy shit this is like the millions of Why patriarchy is bad for men too. articles and videos, except Why matriarchy is bad for female hyenas too.
Not my proudest fap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't worry, I'm kidding. I'm not actually fapped.
I hate hyena, but two of the videos about hyena makes me pity them
Should be called MinuteHurt for this episode
higher testosterone. call and physically visit the hyena sanctuary in Austin, TX. interview them for your next spot! say Mix sent you
I don’t why people “blur” out bad words like: f#@k, b$#&*, p#$$y. This is YouTube not a discovery kids website, they’ll see it one way or another.\n\n\n\n\nMotherfucker, fuck, bitch, pussy, nigger, cracker, asshole, dumbass, shit.
This is called minute earth but the video lasted 3 minutes
It's just a byproduct of having more testosterone. \nEven human women (mostly body builders) who use performance enhancing (/testosterone) drugs have been known to develop enlarged clits large enough to be labeled micro penises.
So, they are essentially the feminist's spirit  animal?
they are probably like male humans - born with nipples but aren't useful for anything 😂
Hey minute earth can you make a video about dragons
I...I should have followed the disclaimer
Its how GOD made them
EVEN humans? What are you saying here?
If you can't explain a biological question like this, call Richard Dawkins first before you make a video.
God dammit that would be painful.
So do the vagina and urethra end up at the same hole, or are they separate?
More interesting facts about hyena sex in this video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHsuEa68xSQ
is it just me or are the female hyena's feminists
I don't know about pens but they do have some Balls..
Don't be a Hyena.\nBe a Tardigrade.
I hate being female anyway, periods fucking SUCK DICK
1:15 trying hard lol
Are boy hyenas blue cos that is what make them cool
Go to sleep
By far your best end pun ever!!
bravo
If there's a 60% chance of it tearing,then why doesn't a female hyena just retract her you know what when she gives birth?
Perhaps females wernt always domonant so they stuck around
Female hyenas have dicks now???
does it suck to be a female or male hyena?
Are all 4 species of hyenas matriarchal? Or only the spotted ones?
Poor hyenas, penises and female hierarchy. Poor hyenas
So are traps gay?
Kinky
XD
I know it was about pseudo-penises but this made my actual penis hurt. That birthing part... -shudders-... I thought I felt bad for human females on birthing. Damn!
Tab For A Cause doesn't work on Firefox. Firefox complains that it can't be verified, and the developers have done nothing to fix this in years.
can you guys talk about how they use dangerous chemicals in are tap water such as chlorine.
is the pseudo penis larger than the normal hyena dick
I'm scared
good
I wonder how long it will take for this video to be demonetized... I'm betting a week.
Maybe it's because male hyenas like traps
Why do they have a penis.... because they're dicks!!!
um so how does furry videos relate to this
new social expectation for trans man flound.
I'm extremely scared of hyenas now
It's just like hentai
It sucks to mate and have pups
If God is real, he must have been trippin' balls when he was making life.
If you did not know the possition Of dogstyle.. maybe this can help you \n\n\n\n\n1:12
Wait.......what?\nI don't want to be a hyena
So..MinuteEarth is not fully educational and kid friendly anymore...\n\n\n\nHey at least she got only one vid censored
7 inches doesn't sound very pseudo to me
the urethral and vaginal tubes are inside the 'shaft'? And it is a clitoris  too?
Hyenas are fucking weird. Like seriously...I can see why lions have beef with these weird ass niggas mayne.
Me watching this video: This is interesting\nMe telling my friends about this video: Why the hell would you watch that?
no matter what fucking gender you are listen to me closely\n\n\n\nWHEN YOU DIE DONT FUCKING REINCARNATE TO A HYENA
STILL BIGGER THEN MY PENIS THAT IS\nRead More
I'm on that side of Utube
It sucks to be a girl and boy hyena lol
Hyenas make men their bitch to the point they grow their own dick
I love their hyena videos
Okay just because you clearly warned us that this may be a disturbing video doesn't mean we'd take it seriously! This is gross!
This is an episode I didn't need to see while eating breakfast
So glad you didn't waste the opportunity to make a dick joke. Well played!
Ah MinuteEarth: going where even zefrank1 fears to tread....
Idk sounds pretty normal to me.
penis
Ultimate feminism
demonetized in 3,2,1
GROSS!!!!
Wow thats lot of penises
Oh
Please make more hyena videos
Oh god!!!!!!😐😶🙁😫😫😫😫😫😫
Lol
That is werd
hot
so hyena =/= good ok
Flag this video for nudity
Not my proudest fap..
Is it really that hard to write a coherent sentence? I'm starting to lose faith in humanity, and lose interest.
Who are the 1k idiots that disliked this video?
Some war is good. Having a war brings the need to be better than your opponent. That need forces you to invent now ways of perceiving reality. Which means better sciences.
i have a question can we go out in milky way galaxy
Neil is a science guy.  Not bill.  And I love science
So much more insightful than the joke known as Bill Nye
it would be fun tho if we could sense protons and the like
Poor Neil, need to answer all those stupid question :D
That's cool and all, but *what in the fuck* are we going to do about overpopulation?
I got lost in his moustache...
NOO my question was is math related to science
I believe in God, but i think this man is a genuis and respect him 100 percent👍
WHAT IS THE FOURTH DIMENSION?!?!!?!?!!??!!?!?!!??!!?!?\nAHHHHHHHHHHH
10:00 - 10:27 so if its 105 degrees, i dont actually have to eat really anything??????????\nI guess thats why you dont see fat lizards. I see kamodo pets here on youtube and they get cancer and die super quick if you over feed them. They don't get fat like humans. They just friken die. Being able to be fat definitely is part of a being that is space fairing. When you look for e.t., make sure you look for fat slug looking people like us!!!!!!! Sitting for countless hours studying requires energy reserves of fat.
What’s a front room
Listening to Neil: *Wow, there really might be some hope for our species after all!*\n\nReading the comments: *We are completely and utterly fucked.*
Is math related to science?
I still wanna take my neighbor’s stuff? HELP!
neil and bill nye are the coolest fuckin scientists
Could that guy ran for president?
@NeildeGrasseTyson:\nWould a government based on science facts would be better than our current form of government in any given country?\nOh man, this isn't twitter. Sometimes I forget i'm on TwitchTV
.. methods and tools of science reveal, for you to perceive. Ah, forgedit, he's just too adorable. Dude, you are astrologically more accurate, love you.
Just a thought, maybe would make a good Vsauce video, but lets say theoretically you somehow made it the edge of the universe where it is expanding, and proceeded to go faster than the rate of which the universe is expanding to the point of leaving the existing universe (again, theoretically. Obviously nowhere near possibility with our technology anytime soon). What would happen to you? Would you cease to exist since you are outside of existence itself? There wouldn't be gravity nor zero gravity, what would occur to you and the ship you're in?
Is math related to science?
You're not a scientist, you're a fucking spokes person.
He's my new Bill Nye... he didn't sell out to gender fluidity.
What a lying piece of shit
Make Neil come back weekly
Neat as hell
Neil supports the universe
joe jmany jdiej
2:41 He answered the question with dark matter - but isnt dark matter matter that has mass but doesnt interfere with other matter and light?
This guy makes me SMILE SO MUCH i just love him! XD
Can this guy be my teacher... Please?
Such a great guy
The fact that people immediately bring / criticize religion into this makes me uncomfortable
For anyone that's wondering that toy he plays with that the end is called a hand boiler. You can buy them online and they're pretty cheap and cool.
The peace question was totally misunderstood lmao
If anyone thinks the way like Wow Mr. Tyson doesn't know how that girl meant peace!. Then please think about that he would have enough time to understand these slang type of shit stuff of the 21st century
Yes Katy, Math is related to Science.
We have no idea how many stars a born in a year. We have never seen one form!
I have to disagree. The thing about wars not killing that many people today has little to do with science and more to do with economics. \n\nThe major countries, with the bigger military forces, are tied up with each other due commercial relationships. So, a war between then is really far from desirable.\n\nALTHOUGH... things are getting are little bit strange these days. Not saying WW3 will start tommorow, but some important changes might happen in the next decade or 2.
His tie actually looks so cool
What is the thermometer called
2:40 He meant Dark Energy in the tweet
If we're expanding, what are we expanding in to? Empty space? But even now we have empty space in atoms, so most of the universe is therefore empty space. So what defines the universe, and the things outside of it?
Is there really an Australian space program called A.R.S.E?
I love how he talks BY the way
I like his tie
If dark energy is expanding the universe and it's expansion will stretch out mass to far for new stars to form could we reverse engineer it to 1 keep the universe from ending(not anything to worry about now) (maybe in about 10 to the hundredth power years) and 2 maybe bring resources closer to us
His view on reality is wrong. You can not remove sensory perception from reality.
The formation of a star has never been observed
Hey Neil, Does Bruno Mars Is Gay?
He's in the matrix loading zone. Life is a simulation
I love science, Neil deGrasse Tyson is the shit!
Advanced nurse teaching song fight campaign magnitude slide trap
Hey neil, i have a question, if E=mc2, then why does M X plus B?
Science has led to greater peace? So the gas chambers used to kill 11 million people (6 million of those were jews) led to peace? The invention of the atomic bomb led to peace?
And the monster fell, just as his creator. Exhausted. Battered. Bruised. The four heroes entered the castle to receive their rewards.
Is math related to science?
I like how he just answered “yes.” Hahaha what a champ. That’s the only way to deal with those conspirator morons. don’t give them extra attention they want, just answer their question and watch their heads explode.
This is what happened to me after every answer he gave https://youtu.be/9CS7j5I6aOc
Is math related to science?
Neil are you a scientoligist
this guy has  in his name two  of the  fastest mens name  in the history . tyson gay and andre degrasse
If he was my teacher that would be dope
Tie steal the show
There must be actual intelligent questions he gets. The good questions probably arent as interesting to make a show out of.
The lunar eclipse is every 18 months not the solar eclipse....
Is math related to science?
I want that toy at the end!!!!!!!!!
His tie looks like my shirt, but without a Bob Ross on it.
I really wanted someone to ask him is math related to science
2:42 shouldn't it be dark energy rather than dark matter in the tweet?
Amazon prime trailers HATE the hearing impaired. But not Wired. Thank you Wired, for nit discriminating against the hearing impaired.
Across the universe greatest movie ever 👍🏼

Nice other Tyson
Yes fuckin amazing
Strange
Neil is a pseudointellectual.
Love his tie!
It might take years to see a star explode from a far so then if our sun exploded and killed us would we be able to see the star explode????
Oh this guys a government pig.
3:17  Cant this argument be used for lets say the existence of God???..... just because we cant see God or such etc dosent mean he dosent exist........ PLEASE KEEP THIS SECTION CIVILIZED.... and whoever wishes to argue lets roll😃..... Great video btw
3:14 so God exists confirmed?

It would be really cool if you got that dress you bought dyed ??? it wouldn't look as much like a wedding dress and it would be stunning !!
Amber could you send a kiss to Brazil???? We really love you <3

Hey Amber! 😄 Have you ever considered doing a video sharing all the countries/states that you have been to? I would love to know which places you've been to outside of California and if you can include the year that you went, that would be great 😊. You have such an interesting life. I don't live in a developed country so your videos are very intriguing to me. 🇬🇩\n\nKeep doing you Boo 😋\n\n- Your fan,\n                Cym 💝
Had the SAME pumpkin outfit as a bby
I just started watching your videos and you give me Priscilla presley vibes :)
Amber why don't you do  a video on a day as a pregbant woman. Where you put on ur fake belly lmao would be legit
That dress was thirty nine dollars dang!  The goodwill thats in my little town sells everything twelve dollars or less even for wedding dresses!
I wanna see Quinn in more videos honestly im dying and you two are so fun together!

Thefuckenmubthatsmygirlbynoldzajelena
AMooo
I’m totally in love with this awesome beats and song! The first video was great and way too sexy for this masterpiece! And it’s still available on Apple Music if anyone wants to watch it again \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/mx/music-video/tension/id1282657137
This video is so relaxing. I don't know what it is. It might be home girl on the onboard and the way she dances. She makes it look so easy. The guy is trying to hard. Lol
This sounds like WE GO DEEP of Janet jackson
Korean girl who is famous for boarding ?? S\n@.@
Ami the only one that feels its kind of like sad story video?
Love joanne the scamer  just not new fergi
Amei essa música, e esse clip saiu melhor que o original
It's hard to recognize Fergie's voice in this song, especially in the beginning. And Joann the Scammer... wtf?
those new folks out there should look up to Fergie.
2:45 Joanne The Scammer, you're welcome!
That Van's store is here in San Pedro! Just a few blocks down from me.. omg no wonder there was so much filming in the past month. Love you Fergie
This video is so unnecessary. The first one was more than good.
I came for Joanne, stayed for the beat.
I prefered the other music video :(  this one is more boring af, at  least the other one makes me wanna get high lol
high key the original video had a better vibe that fit the song. i know a lot of people are saying the video was removed due to the flash of a feminine nipple, but I can't help but feel the original video with girl-on-girl music festival sexual-tension fit way better than this video. :s such a shame since this being apart of the visual album becomes a filler video imho\nnot to discredit the BOMB longboarding our lead girl is blasting out on those roads, just seems like a miss in fitting in with the visual albums vibe
Hey everyone! Just did a cover of this song up on my channel ✨\n\nWATCH HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUpHm8goGdE

Quero o vídeo antigo de volta! Esse nem se compara a vibe do outro...
where is the other video?
cool
this video is really good, but the music ''sounds'' better with the old one. btw, i hated when i found out it was removed
This is interesting because I am someone who gets really heavily affected by SAD, and autumn has alwayyys been my least favourite season as my depression seems to hit me the worst during it. But in recent years it's started to grow on me, and I think a lot of that IS the grandeur that comes with the commercializations of autumn. Before when summer ended all I'd do is dread the lack of sunshine in the coming months, the rain and my seasonal affective disorder inevitably kicking in, and even though that's all still true, it's like my brain can be distracted like yeah it's going to get gloomy out, but pumpkin spice lattes are back!! Halloween decor! Cozy spooky evenings!! and even though it's all done with the intent to sell stuff, I can't say I mind it for what it's worth.
be basic finally some useful advice !
I love autumn and am (shamefully unashamedly) kind of enjoying how it’s becoming a brand or thing. It’s cosier, I want to be spooky but in a joyous way. Ha. I don’t buy any thing pumpkin spice but I do read gothicly and kick leaves.
I love you Lex. Never change. (Unless you want to it's all cool man it's your life)
this is the only comment section which is fun to read and has no awful comments! Good children
Yes. I am pro joy.
I just don't like the fact that people associate buying things with being happy... I love autumn but I hate consumerism
I was so convinced there was a window to the left of the fireplace but now there's all this space there...and objects...I don't know who I am anymore
They only meet our needs and what we demand. I dont hate commercialization. Seasons give people inspiration to switch things up to attract customers.\nThe only problem I have is that small business dont really benefit from it as  much as much as large corporations.\nI love small business. too bad nobody cares about it anymore & just runs to their local starbucks smh
A bit off-topic: it’s SO nice to see that your home is not all blogger-y, with fairy lights and matching decor. It’s cozy! And lived in! And just a normal home. ❤️
I dislike autumn but I respect people's rights to celebrate and enjoy it with items. :P and I agree, who am I to deny someone their right to make themselves feel better with socks and things? if those things worked on me to convince me that this is an enjoyable season, hell I'd be doing the same!
You look like that one girl from that black mirror episode
your summer hair was better .....love your necklace
Do you have a link to the article?:)
Weird question... Is that an air purifier behind you? Do you notice much difference from using one? OK, that was two weird questions... Have a wonderful glum glum sadness season!
I agree that nice things make SAD more bearable, I actually enjoy this side of christmas. I've always been crazy for autumn, personally!
I was randomly searching for smth that gives me a cozy, autumn feeling here on YouTube. Then I almost got a headache by all the brainless chatter about senseles​s topics from these commercialised puppies... I gave it one more shot and there were you, finally. Brain!
WHOA - Comfy socks are for the whole year!
I always love your ramble videos ^_^ <3
Thank you! I really don't want to hate on vloggers who peddle all their wares as I think we all know those arguments inside out, but I am truly agog at the amount of junk that some of them churn out. Zoella must have more than 40 different (incredibly generic) products out at the moment, all of which she is totally nuts about and LOVES. I really struggle with this as all i see it as is them taking advantage of young viewership who aspire to their lifestyle, sucking them dry of pocket money etc. I am basically a commie so realise comment is very null in void but imagine the influencers used their following to promote environmentally conscious pratices etc.
Fine decoration is not a matter of being rich or poor babe but of personal taste. Luv!
I don't like wearing summer colours so autumn makes my normal seem more ...fashionable? Autumn is quite stressful because i never know whether i should wear a coat or not.
why am i not getting your notifications.......shit
I've always loved this time of year, I love fireworks night, thanksgiving, my birthday! The colours of leaves! And the flavours associated with autumn! I also am one of the few people who doesn't like summer so when it gets cold and rainy Im Very happy! I don't have much money so can't exactly buy into it but I love watching autumn hauls or vlogs where other people have - I guess I get my autumn fix vicariously through that!
I have never heard a convincing argument for Autumn's commercialisation till now! .. \n\nJust one problem in my context. Stop trying to make Halloween a thing in Australia (at companies). There is no justification for it. You want to know why?....... Because it is freakin SPRING!
See in florida fall is the end of terrible weather and the beginning of pleasant weather
I love your hair!
Run my children! Be basic! I love it!!! Hahaha
I love autumn (or fall because America), but I live in Texas now... Fall only exists inside my apartment. :'(
The suggested video after this was Zoella's autumn homeware haul
I was just thinking the other day about how strange I find it when people aggressively autumn-decorate. I love cosiness but I'm also lazy...
I used to only enjoy spring, but since I found proper medication and don't get depressed anymore, I've started to warm up (get it) to autumn and winter. I still hate summer as I can't stand humidity and heat and am a very sweaty person, but without the prospect of crippling depression inching closer I'm just relieved I can finally cover up in big sweaters and ridiculously huge scarfs and not sweat the whole time again. And the (admittedly scarce) sun this time of year is actually enjoyable and nice and warm instead of something to avoid at all costs.
Somehow a three minute video from you leaves one with the impression of having absorbed at least 20 mins of emotionally charged, informed, and relevant content. More so than most actually 20 min long videos. How'd you do that, Lex?
Be basic, be merry in the leaves is going to be my motto for the season.
Interestingly it's because of this commercialisation of Autumn that I feel most disconnected from the world just because I live in Australia. We don't really have any of the stuff going on now when it's Autumn for us, which I'm guessing is because it's not a big enough market. Or maybe it's because it would clash with the majority of what we consume, which is American and British trends and media. We already have all of the winter-geared Christmas stuff when we are melting in 40 degree Celcius weather.
I love autumn and glumglum sadness season! I'm born in autumn and have always associated it with happy times :)\n\n(Unfortunately there's no pret where I live and the seasonal starbucks drinks aren't vegan)
It's always odd for me because summer is always the absolute worst for me, I don't sleep, my depression is a lot worse and I have nightly panic attacks. Autumn is like a 'thank fuck that's over' for me.
Unrelated but I do appreciate your eye-makeup and thats saying something because I usually dont notice makeup or care for it much... Anyway its lovely.
And like where is all the fall themed music? Everyone sings about summer and winter and spring but why doesn’t anyone sing about the best goddamn season we get?!
I'm from central California and it is ALWAYS AND FOREVER hot except for the bless-ed few cold weeks we get between early November and late January before it turns stuffy and hot again, so I've always loved autumn because it's the only time I'm not boiling hot or sweating slightly. The first excuse I get to wear a cardigan and not sweat to death I am THERE. also I was born in November so autumn time is in my nature.
Please don't say you're not young! I'm only a year or two younger than you and you feeling old makes me feel old!\n(You thought this was going to be a kind uplifting comment but really I'm just selfish hurrhurrr)
i had just started thinking about this this autumn, thanks for putting it in words!
I love autumn and I love cozy socks and scented candles, and I love everything about it. Sorry. Take my money.
I don't get the big fuss about autumn. Like sure, the leaves turn orange and it gets a bit windy. No need to go conkers over it.
Autumn rules, I love cracking out my coats and jumpers. And if people want to buy flavoured coffee and warm clothes, is that such a bad thing?
See, I'm not a fan of sunlight. So Autumn is a boon as far as I am concerned. Heck, I was married on Halloween.
I feel like you and Noel Fielding would be a dream team
this is slightly ironic, given the video but...where did you get your jumper??? I need it in my life
Thank you, I will ♡
Do you have a source for that spooky statistic claim? Fascinating.
Thank you for raising S.A.D. Lex, it's a pain in the arse to say the least
IT'S COLD SELL ME WARMTH AND COMFORT PLS THX
the commercialism of autumn doesn't really bother me that much. \n\nit's mainly cos I can't get behind the products/campaigns as a lot of them aren't of much interest to me like for example pumpkin spiced latte's (I absolutely hate coffee and milk)
One thing I'm not keen on about the commercialisation of Autumn is after one cooler day you're inundated with ads about cosy jumpers and instead of enjoying the last nice days of summer it imbues it with a sense of desperation?! Mind you I am one of the people for whom worse weather means bad times so I guess I'm not the target audience. Love your videos Lex!
I don’t think it’s deep, just how the world is, the market sees that people enjoy cosy socks and hot coco in the colder months, to pay the bills this month they sell cosy socks and hot coco
Did you dye your hair pink? x
Absolutely dislike autumn, strongly hate the cold. But nothing beats a dark autumn night, lots of rain and wind, when Im sitting inside my place with coco, next to a radiator, reading a book, wearing knitwear hugged by my teddy and a blanket. Still want summer back tbh.
This is a v interesting topic which I probably should comment on but also where is your jumper from?
Spring is the best season handsdown
I hate capitalism. :( I prefer being cosy with my wife than luxuries.
I definitely agree that celebrating every season including the miserable ones is a good thing. Part of living in the now and enjoying the present instead of always hanging out for summer. However being in the southern hemisphere it is very confusing when everyone starts getting autumnal while here we are getting 25+ degree days again!
I'm thrilled to have less humidity and bugs and more autumnal colors in the trees even if it means my tomatoes are dying and I can't make fresh pesto anymore.
I love the shattered illusion tbh
(Also Over the Garden Wall has REALLY helped me romanticize autumn)
High quality description 10/10
Honestly I love commercialised autumn/christmas.
CAT
LOVE the description
KITTEH!!!!

Toy Story 2 was alright.
Autumn's a filthy casual.
You live in central London? I thought that was impossible....
NO
Up next: Autumn Homeware Haul. Loving Autumn: yay, pro-joy. I have noticed more Autumn (insert capitalism here) vids on Youtube. I kinda don't like the idea that we have to change our whole wardrobe and decor when the seasons change. Surely most people just get out their jumpers/jackets/scarves, put away their summer dresses and leave their interiors pretty much the same. I love decorating my house for xmas as much as the next person but I don't change the cushions or the bedding... Where would I keep the spare stuff?! I ain't got space for storing this stuff when I'm not using it, let alone the bother or money to buy it all.
See this is why I love springtime. I know that it can get categorised as being 'Easter', but on the whole, aside from pastel colours, spring is left alone more so than summer (BIKINI BODIES SUMMER HOLIDAYS THERE ARE CHILDREN EVERYWHERE), winter (Christmas and New Years) and Autumn (Halloween and Bonfire night etc). I feel extremely rejuvenated during the transitional seasons of spring and autumn, and I find myself craving the change in my environment as I live in the countryside so I get the full scope of the season change in trees and such. I do love autumn, and will wear cosy jumpers and nestle up by the fire, but the commercialism of Autumn is getting a little wearing. If I have to see another Instagram post which is a list of things to do in autumn like go to a pumpkin patch and buy an autumn scented candle in a cute pair of boots, I will scream.
Either the compression in YouTube is off the charts or you appear to have aged more than 15 years in a short amount of time
I hate the cold. Summer is the only time I feel cute and able to look like my body is mine. I hate the cold and I hate having to wear layers that make me feel fat and frumpy and I hate chapped lips and raw noses and my eyes tearing from the cold and the wind and I hate the rain and the snow and the wet socks and frozen fingers. \nBUT!!! Commercialization of autumn and winter (which is just Halloween and Christmas, lets be honest) is actually getting me excited for the season! I am looking forward to autumn dresses and christmas sweaters and going to a Harry Potter themed halloween party, and getting and giving presents on christmas and pumpkin pie and cinnamon things. the whole shebang, I'm excited.
I love autumn and it's getting hotter in New Zealand now but I'll be in the USA soon and I'm way too excited to see how they do autumn and buy into all this shit hahaha
but I do not understand how someone can enjoy the cold. IF THEY CAN, GOOD ON THEM, but I can't, it's too cold. I hate this season xD
This looks like an 80s homemade video.

King Krule is so refreshing and inspiring. Excited to see such a young talent continue to create great music. Looking forward to see what he does in the future.

KING GOD KRULE !!!!
blah blah shut up everyone jesus christ. it's a cool song but you're gonna look back at yourselves and cringe at how you thought leaving the creepiest fanboy/girl comments ever and overhyping this decent song you probably have no idea the meaning of (nor do i) was gonna get you like... on his contacts list. Eh... stop.
Sometimes reporting on these things hits me hard. I know I've said it before, and I'll continue to say it but please call, text, email, or better yet tell someone in person you love them today. The world can be so cruel and our time isn't guaranteed. In case someone hasn't said it to you today, I love ya, Nation. <3
That's interesting. On Sky News in the UK, it was reported that the shooter was killed by the police.
was not a terrorist, per say just a mass shooter at the moment
We should repeal the second amendment. Go door to door and confiscate weapons starting s civil war, then if we lose see our violent crime rates skyrocket like they did in Australia after they banned guns. Great idea folks
false information my ass there is a video of a couple in a hotel called the balagio or something who reported shot being fired at their hotel and the police where detaining everyone in the hotel not letting them go to the main floor. next to that if you listen to the audio of the shooting their where multiple guns being fired at the same time. but hey just keep believing the media, just like with 9/11 because the government would never fake such a horrible thing?! well they did it to start the war in vietnam by sinking their own ship and reporting it was an attack by vietnam. so if they did it once and got away with it why wouldn't they do it again. they are also trying really hard to put the narrative out their that this is due to lack of control on guns while most of the guns that were fired are already illegal in the USA, so if a millionaire wants to empty automatic assault rifles on a group of people the law is not going to stop him/her. WAKE THE FUCK UP
Anyone blaming this tragedy on the NRA is dumber than the box of rocks that it would take to hold said flaky person down and keep them from blowing away with the wind. It's just not so.
Stfu fag
I don't know what is up with the idea of it not helping, putting a leash on people's weapons... We do it here in Denmark, and no one gets shot... Because we use knives instead
deep- state pshy-op - he has been found alive & kicking : https://youtu.be/RyH9hUxqNoI
People only become terrorists out of a lack of Islam in their life.
His name is Stephen Paddock and he is at the center of this which means it is important to talk about him. It does no good to not talk about him. Talking about the heroes of this event will not stop the next terrorist and having hope will not stop the next one. Thoughts and prayers won't either. Real journalism will and you're a part of that. Complete the picture by talking about the gunman. Calling him names or bad mouthing him is not going to help. In fact, he may have a mental disorder in which case we'd have to talk about mental disorders which means the most important human brains to talk about are the ones that actually did something like this, not just the ones that may theoretically be driven to. Stephen Paddock is famous, whether you like it or not. Now we need to talk about him and piece this together.
You did this with your hands like every time
My Family [military some music fans with friends and an UNLV ex employee with former students there] thanks you.
I'm really sad that I can't donate blood because of how small I am.
When you act like a good person by saying you're not monetizing this video, but it's against YouTube policy to monetize a video of a tragedy in the first place.
What's really starting to upset me, is the fact that this stuff is no longer getting to me. I'm rapidly reaching the point that I just don't care when this stuff happens. Nobody wants to solve the problems. It's just hand wringing, defenses from gun fanatics, pressure to do something, thoughts and prayers and then nothing happens. We turned flying into one of the most anguishing experiences after 9/11 but after how many mass shootings we still won't do anything about this problem? We're gonna keep making better and better guns while making them relatively easy to get and defunding mental health services at the same time? Yeah, no. Nothing could possibly go wrong with that.
The number 32 will always be my favorite number because it always seems to pop up in the weirdest of ways, but sure wasn't ever expecting to hear it was the floor that a mass murderer was shooting people from. Thats definitely one of the top weirdest ones.
DUDE YOU MUST BREATH THROUGH YOUR EARS CAUSE YOUR NEVER STOP TALKING . . . . .
White on white crime- Who gives a fuck, not meJust like whites don't care about Black on Black crime. Mass shooters are WHITE TERRORIST all the time. But amerikkka won't call it that unless your a person of color.
You should pray harder and get more guns. More severe prisonsentences. More death. Seems to work. Oh. The American way.
Finally a guy with common sense! I hate how the media seems glorify these acts of violence!\nGun control, isn't the problem! Mental Health issues and society itself is the problem!
You would think that Aldean would have told people to run over his microphone. The POS, p*ssy.
Too bad no one believes it.
I get not showing the killers face so you can deny some notoriety but showing a flag that has flown above hundreds to thousands of  brutal executions is doing the same exact thing. Anyone with knowledge of liveleak and a strong stomach has seen  human beings killed in the most brutal fashion (ie beheadings w det cord/having a car w prisoners shot at with an rpg/ drownings in a swimming pool/thrown from buildings). The Kurds I work with call ISIS 'dogs'. Don't say you won't show this guy and still raise the IS flag up shortly after. My 2¢, thanks.
If you want to shoot in Chicago guess what you do, drive to Indiana. Federal laws are needed.
Have we figured out a profile for all these terrorist in America?
You need to make your videos about gun control because you say that there will be a big debate over the next month but there won't!
This guy is an ignorant corporate puppet not able to comprehend the situation and how he is contributing to the downfall of his country. The government wants to abolish the second amendment for obvious reasons and if you would research outside of mainstream media you will find the lies fed to you are quite disturbing. Don't believe anything you are told, consider all information available and form your own opinion, Phillip de Franco is not qualified to give you any of this information.
Phil, it's motifs and videos like this is the reason why you've had rock solid respect in my book after many many years of watching.
the mass shooting was differently a false flag shooting im from texas and live in texas and they are already say more gun control fuck that if you try and take my guns my whole state will shoot.
Was the said man as a shooter, framed or scapegoated? It sounds really strange, like Oswald.
Not terrorism. I get that you want to place that on something for someone so evil but use the definition as intended so that we can distinguish the differences.
I wish people would stop making videos on this attack on my city before all the evidence comes out.   Today the local news is saying paddock might have accomplices and he had explosives in his cars and may have had an escape plan to cause more harm.   But go speak more about guns before we find out more of his motive and if he has  people that might be on the run that might cause something more heinous in the near future
it doesn't make sense.... why all the guns and not more ammo.... this stinks of false flag.
Your neutrality on the news reports is such a breath of fresh air in this bullshit world. All I've seen since this tragedy is conspiracy theories and gun control squabbles, as well as people blaming things totally unconnected. Almost nothing about the victims. Thank you Phil, for giving them the respect they deserve and for not giving the animal who did this the spotlight. I appreciate you so much.
I I think you're a great person with a great channel, but by not giving the identity of the perpetrator's name, you make ppl only more curious. They are less likely to search him up if his identity is revealed.
it hits me hard that murica kills zivils in the east like in syria everyday. Everyday hundreds of woman, children, babys getting killed from american bomb-carpets. Noone gives a shit. I mean, its sad that there was a man shooting 50 innocent people in las vegas. but this country is doing even more shit in wars they started by themself. wake up guys.
My mother was in Las Vegas for her one year anniversary with her new husband and they were in an Uber when all this happened. She called me at 2 AM letting me know she was OK. All I can think about is if she Uber to a little bit earlier maybe she would've gotten hurt and I feel so blessed that she's alright
I feel like there had to be more then one shooter... & I definitely think there should be more control over what weapons are being sold...  I was just at a county music concert a few weeks ago and I don't even want to imagine how it was to go though sometime like this, It's so sad , so many inocente life's gone 😕
People say thoughts and prayers\n\nHere is what I have to say to that: \nFuck.\nThat.\n\nThoughts and prayers never saved anyone. Where was God when all those innocent people lost their lives? Stop living in a dream, people. Instead of saying thoughts and prayers every time something like this happens, do something about it.\n\nLet's face the problem. Guns. Guns are the problem. Without guns there wouldn't be mass shootings. It's that simple. Of course, there will still be murder. It's human nature after all, but people won't be able to spray down a concert hall full of people with a machine gun, if only you gun crazed idiot rednecks would let go of, let's face it, your expensive toys.\n\nIf your enjoyment of shooting targets on the weekends outweigh the lives of others, you are a sick and twisted person. People are dying, can't you see? Why do you need an assault rifle for self-protection?\n\nIt's time to weigh your priorities. Freedom and liberty don't mean shit if your children are ducking bullets at school. Dead people don't have freedom.
Forget nevada state law, the word terrorism has a definition.  \n\nter·ror·ism\n[ˈterəˌrizəm]\nNOUN\nthe use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.\n\nLaws change state by state, country by country and so on.  These are not universal so to speak.  Defined language however is one place we should be able to agree.  You can somehow pass a law stating that looking at someone for more than 2 seconds constitutes assault but that doesn't change the definition of the word assault.
1. Steven is not a mass murderer he is a victim of the Las Vegas 'set up' to push gun control legislation on Americans.... he is the 60th victim of this deep state massacre!!\n2. Giving up your guns when you have a psychopathic untouchable deep state prepared to lay waste to your people in order to acheive their political agenda is pure insanity!!\n3 The factual inconsistencies in this narrative are irreconcilable with this man being an antifa lone wolf mass muderer.\n* What about the 2 women who ran through the crowd telling everyone you are all about to die. \n*What about the footage of light given off by rifle fire on the 12th or 13th floor and the lack of it on the 32nd floor\n*what about the footage captured by the female taxi driver where you can hear gunshots coming from different places simultaneously and basically on top of each other...impossible for a single shooter to be two places at once \n* How convenient for him to shoot himself and not have to be questioned or even hold up in the room keeping authorities at bay for any duration of time.\n*what about FEMA who just happened to be holding a terrorism drill that weekend -(who knew holding a terrorism drill was code for staging a mass shooting)\nNote to self - stay away from wherever FEMA is holding 'terrerorism drills'!!!\n* what about the photos showing a chest wound in addition to his head wound\n* why the gloves for a man with ZERO interest or knowledge of guns\n* how could a man without gun knowledge and training use the rifle so well first time\n* how did he get all those guns and bullets passed newly installed metal detectors\n* what about the 3 news stations who began reporting the incident BEFORE it began...let that sink in...ready🎥 ....and action🎬!!! \n* What about his neighbour and drinking buddy who said he was a TRUMP SUPPORTER with ZERO interest in guns and the friendliest guy on the planet. \n- That's why he's dead btw they needed someone accessible and trusting enough to befriend a stranger and take them into their hotel room and be set up and that was all this friendly social affable guy did wrong...he walked right into being the perfect patsy!!!\n...more footage from security cameras inside and outside of the hotel and eye witness acounts from staff and concert goers are going to lead to even more inconsistencies, the official narrative is an unsubstantiated insult to intelligence!!
Nice try you should have your own late show.All you need is some attempted fake crying.You really need to see the lying lame stream media videos of man shot three times in the chest and released from hospital the next day.Man shot in the back of the head and made a full recovery giving interview while smiling his ass off.Oh I nearly forgot about the hero,after being shot in the neck went on to help injured,and apparently still has the bullet in his neck.Although there is no sign of any bandage.STOP LYING!
Stoping the democrats on CNN will stop mass shooting, GET THEM IN JAIL NOW, be4 another mass shooting they create happens again.
For the best info look for David Icke and Paul Joseph Watson.
Lol Isis is like yeah we did it... alright ima go back to sleep now
No we don't.
If I fell off my bike I'm pretty sure isis would claim responsibility.
Gun control vultures always swarm on tragic events. Funny how a guy targets a conservative majority event and conservatives get blamed.
I don’t want to be a part of the divisiveness anymore. I feel regret from taking a part in it. I’m done.
I live in Las Vegas, and the morning after this happened I got 4 texts asking if I was alright, and I read them before I even knew this happened and I was terrified.
You're a good dude, Phil. Always appreciate your reasonable level-headed stance on things, and I agree with not showing the name/face of the killer and focusing on the victims and people who help.
gabby giffords and her nasa freemason astronaut husband are also part of the fake deceptions!!!!)
People in main steam media love BAD and TRAGIC news.  It increases their viewership
I listened to an old interview with Kingsley Amis today and he said in that interview he was just glad people could love who they wanted and the era of wars was over and the world is a safer place and then I saw this.
I honestly don't think the actual killer is dead. Why do something like this for fame if you're not going to be around to bask in the glory of your accomplishment, being that was his goal. I am not saying I agree with what he did because that's f@%#ed. All I am saying is if it's soo easy to frame an innocent person and send them to prison. It's actually easier to frame a recently dead guy. he killed 55 people before police found him, yet I would bet money that the evidence to convict said would be killer was just another victim.
The recipe of shootings like this is pretty set in stone. Big shooting happens. Everyone runs around like headless chickens spewing anything that could even be remotely connected to it. Or at the very least may appear to be connected. Then there's the crazies and idiots that deliberately lie about responsibility and spread false info. And then about 2-3 days follows of a giant clusterfuck of all sorts of bullshit floods the info lanes. Slowing down the real information getting to the forefront. Then it starts turning into the same old song and dance called gun control where the usual suspects scream at each other from the safety of their little internet fort.\n\nQuite frankly, its rather annoying. Wish people who have no fucking clue what's going on did some basic legwork before spewing nonsense. And those deliberately lying just stop. Also, if you want to talk gun control. How about you focus on making it harder to obtain illegal weapons, or obtaining weapons illegally in general. I get it, you want some regulations in place for how to legally obtaining weapons. But you're never going to be able to properly adjust for that unless you deal with the illegal side off it first.
Look this is a horrible situation, but i have a suggestion Phil, you have a great news channel but maybe instead of not getting the money from these videos, just get them and donate them to charities that involve that tragedy.
Condolences to everyone affected, My heart goes to all of you and I wish you the strength for the hard times to come. This is my opinion but in a DUI we blame the driver, in a bombing we blame the bomber but why in a shooting do we blame the gun? even if guns were banned entirely bad people will find a way to get them, like most illegal things. Yes gun regulation needs a look at but if someone good has a gun at the right time and the right place that's lives that could be saved. Bad people will find a way and D-bags will be D-bags, nothing changes that, this guy might've been sick or whatever, doesn't change the fact he was a bad person and that he just needs to be forgotten, we remember the people affected and will honor their names but not the d-bag.
Thank you, Philip. I'm saddened by the fact that so many are using this situation to spread more theories and dramatics about things unrelated, unprovable, and unnecessary when we should be focused on the real topics at hand. When we should see an event like this and come together as a nation, as a people and make changes happen to help prevent this type of thing in the future.
The fake victim, 3:33, on the right is a porn star i believe.
Bump fire stocks dont sound like that. Sounds like a M240 Bravo. just another deep state bullshit.
You have past on fake news by denying that there was other shots fired at other hotels.
Paddoch got pissed at the world because he lost his phony little slip & fall law suit.
Why do 3k people dislike this?
This is absurd that youtube was under attack by our own government just because people said and gave their own evidence that it was a conspiracy. This right here proves that the FBI and the US government do not want the public to think that for specific reasons. Certain posts were banned but if the theory of a conspiracy was under attack as it was then there is more to the story then what was told by mainstream news. Mr Paddock was not mentally ill. There was no surveillance footage released showing Stephen entering the hotel room or lobby with a suspicious arsenal of weapons.The investigation was rushed when the weapons were found in his room and he was the only one in there. He could have been a victim of a setup and used as a patsy which is highly plausible due to the information about uncovered about himself being a peaceful wealthy man. The investigation only used circumstantial evidence to pin the murders on Stephen Paddock. This smells fishy and you need hard forensic evidence to conclude an investigation. It is not hard to make a man look like he shot himself if you know what you are doing. I would say due to the lack of evidence in the investigation there is a high probability that there is something the US government does not want you to know. If this was a shooting committed by others the motive was clear to enforce strict regulations of Gun control and an excuse to go after countries that harbor members of Isis and any other terrorist groups alike.
0:00 Dude, fuck what you're talking about, I had a great day that day and view it as such. I don't live my life in direct correlation to whatever happens, good or bad, everywhere else in the US or the world. Don't you dare speak for other people.
More gun control, thoughts and prayers, banning things, government control and making more laws is NOT going to stop massacres. If someone wants to kill a mass amount of people, they will find a way to do it one way or another. I really wish people would stop believing that more government control needs to be established, I couldn’t think of a more wrong way to go about horrible situations like this.
Your very impartial I really enjoy your style of news presentation you try and cover all aspects and not swing left or right
Remember: The demographic of people responsible for the most deaths of human beings is governments (just in the 20th century we had Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, the Kims, Mussolini, and Saddam Hussein, amongst others) and gun bans don't apply to them. Gun ban = assigning wolves with the task of disarming the sheep to protect the peaceful sheep from the violent sheep.
Loved how he had the humility to leave out the like and subscribe part! Love ya Frankie ❤
Free fisherofmen.
3:33 nope.
Donated and shared!
ALL THESE HAND GESTURES
Oh
No we dont, philip. no we dont.
R.I.P
This was disgusting
So sad.
They should ban automobiles in europe cause obviously they can be used as terrorism
Here are the facts.\nA man gets 400 pounds of equipment up 30 floors, past casino level hotel security, without being seen on camera, sets up a sniper nest, removed  a window that is composed of over 800 pounds of hurricane proof glass, then laid down fire for 10 minutes straight, with inconsistent weapon and bullet types based on sound, sometimes shooting two distinct successions of fire at the same time, using an illegal full auto weapon, that he apparently got from some gun store, despite his family saying he never even liked guns. \n\nThose are the facts. That is what apparently happened. If you think that sounds suspicious then you're an insensitive biggot.\n\nAlso, he somehow got rid of all the bullet casings. And the people he shot somehow bled bright red, almost pink paint like substances. None of the videos showing any bullet wounds.\n\nAlso somehow he got some people from other tragedies like Baltimore and sandy hook to show up. Same people. Doing the same things. Crying on the phone, playing dead, etc.\n\nHe also placed an ad on Craigslist far in advance advertising for an actor crowd. And was then led to a website where you can hire a crowd of actors for basically any purpose.\n\nYes. Those are the facts. Thank God every Hollywood liberal and government official didn't even wait until the bodies were cold to discuss gun control. What perfect timing.
Tulsa Oklahoma???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
If you think gun control doesnt work you you are just ignorant of all the evidence. It works, its as simple as that. It reduces mass shootings, violent crime, suicides etc. countries with gun control are often just flat out better places to live, not some messed up oppressive regime
There was no spent brass on the floor in the shooter's room.
This is the new normal
You need to talk about how the US runs drugs and weapons, funds and supports terrorist, interferes in the elections of other countries, carries out false flag terrorism to perpetuate wars for profit, and has killed millions and millions of innocent people worldwide over the last several decades. Why can't you people acknowledge these problems as well??? You all copy each other and say we need to talk about this when these shootings happen. Why aren't you speaking out about corruption and the US's psychotic foreign policy the rest of the time?
All these attacks happening in the world but VEGAS? Beautiful place and no high security? Just makes you wonder that nowhere is safe anymore. Heart goes out to those who lose their lives ❤
This just proves the point that terrorism can not just be accredited to foreign factions or terrorist groups. We need to understand that the threat can come from anywhere. Its so sad to say that we need to be vigilant about our own safety.
false flag, there were 2 shooters and its been caught on camera and on phone calls that were to at least 2 because gun shots sounds were coming from two different directions and i bet it was set up to disarm the american public.
I'm not one for conspiracy theories but in the videos I've watched of the recent Las Vegas shootings you can clearly hear multiple automatic weapons fire from multiple different locations and it begs the question, why are the mainstream media trying to cover up the truth?!
yo phil the best case i can give you for proof of gun control working just look at australia
Trump visited the fake actors this don't look good for him if this really fake.
Argument: Gun control wouldn't work on criminals, therefore there's no point.\nCounter Argument: Making murder illegal hasn't worked on criminals, therefore there's no point in keeping it illegal. \nIt's the same argument. Can someone please take a 1st years philosophy class and learn about fallacies.
It took over an hour to get to the shooter?! That just seems so wild to me. Even wilder is the fact he had 10 weapons on him. 10. Disgusting. My heart hurts so so badly for those killed and injured. Mental health evaluations in order to buy weapons is proving to be more and more important everyday.
So if you can't stop acts of violence  completely there shouldn't be any gun laws at all?? Someone explain that to me. if people don't have guns they'll find another way. So let's make it easy for them???
Yep the world is dying. There no peace without conflict. There's no love without hate. Those were Thompson guns being shot out. Halloween massacre. This is why i say it was a Thompson https://youtu.be/x4QWrha3HLw it's the mafia. They usually hang in casinos. My whole life is based on nightmares so i don't care. We did terrorism in the past by blowing up Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Vietnam.
To all those Americans who feel their “freedom” will be impacted if their guns are taken away think of all the freedom you will gain being able to go to school and public events in peace. Starting to think Americans will never learn from their mistakes. Come to Australia we have no mass shootings and Sephora its a win win.
I'm glad I don't live in America
HOAX
4 decades, thanks for the memories T.P. \nRest in paradise good sir.
Bowie, Allman, now Petty. Think Gods trying to tell you something ??
Thanks for posting this, Skip. I was there two nights before and was in wonder at the happiness in which he played that night. I'm glad you captured this. It'll be iconic. Your seats must've been crazy good.
Love ya Tom.  You looked tired, too tired.  God Bless You Brother. RIP
Grabbed at his heart at the end of this. RIP my Mr Tom Petty. So much love too you! Thank you for giving me an awesome child hood and an escape!
We are almost outta time RIP Tommy
Thank you so very, very much. Written with teary years and a bittersweet heart.
Thanks for posting, Skip. A great song, a great man, a legend who will always be with us, through his music. God Bless Ya! were his last words to his live fans. God bless you, Tom Petty, for sharing your music, your words, your essence..your life with us.  What a wonderful spirit you shared. We will miss you, but take your rest, find your peace and fly high and FREE!!
I would like to thank the videographer who stayed on the band even after the song was over. It may have seemed precious use of bandwidth at the time, but look at what it yeilded for the world. That precious last public communion with the band and the man who was, for many of us, the soundtrack to our lives.
Random thought... I love this song but every time I hear it I am reminded of the scene from Silence of the Lambs where the girl in the well (just before being kidnapped) is rocking out to this song as she's driving home.  Anyway, Tom Petty's death is a great loss. I grew up on his music and also loved The Traveling Wilbury's.  What an awesome collaboration they were. Thx for sharing!  ☺
Everyone had to have loved Tom Petty... How could they not??
the fuse is slowly burning out on our rock  roll icons but there songs will will never burn out
I'm taking Tom's death really hard this week. I never got to meet or talk to him, but I feel like I lost one of my best friends or a family member in a way. It's not simply being a fan of his music either, I think it's because he made an emotional impact in our lives, and he was always active and touring or recording, so it feels that much more shocking to suddenly lose him. He wasn't polished or anything, just a regular dude who liked to joke around and smoke a bowl and play music.
😢 still can't believe he's gone
Of all the musicians and rock stars who have passed over the years and I have mourned, only two have hit me personally enough to make me want to cry. First was Stevie Ray Vaughn, and now Tom Petty. \n\nI never knew you Tom, but I felt like you were my friend. RIP
At 5:50, a glimpse of what occurred on 10/2/17.    R I P, Tom.
You took care of my life when  I couldn't You held me up when I fell! OMG how do I say goodbye to hero?  Thank you Tom Petty you completed me!
Fuck man this is s true tragedy he will be missed
I was at that. RIP tom petty
This thumbnail sat in my recommendation for days. Now I can watch it. Thanks, M8!
We love you Tom
He seemed out of breath at the end. Kind of clutched at his chest. Sad he didn't get medical help. Wish he were still with us.
Going to miss him
I've seen over 200 concerts but never Tom Petty. Oh well guess I missed out....
Tom used to have a place in San Francisco, I used to pick up his garbage. He let me in to listen to him play. Thanks Tom ur right on.
Rocking til the very end
His best song oh yeah alright
Soundtrack of my youth.  I loved, loved, loved him. Thanks for posting!
Everyone who gave this a thumbs-down can take that thumb and shove it straight up their ignorant, commi asses.
God how many times can that woman go WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO??? Shut uppppp
Tom Petty was such a cool dude. I wish I could've met him. He's the definition of a rockstar. I love your music. Rest in peace
I hope it's not heart cancer he had.....it's a very rare, only 1/1,000,000 can have this, 😢 RIP tom
When will it be Miley Cyrus the virus who infected everyone with Billy Ray virus
This one of the saddest videos i ever watched. Good bye Tom. The world misses you.
The last song I ever played with my band before we split for good was a cover of American Girl. It is simply one of the greatest songs I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. What a great way to go out. I love you Tom.
40 years of the best rock-n-roll I have ever heard. I was a teenager when Tom formed the Heartbreakers and listened to Tom's music almost daily since. You will be missed Tom Petty but your music will live forever.
Dude was able to rock until the very end. Sucks he died, I'm gonna miss him, but I'm also gonna remember him. His music is gonna influence people for many many years to come. What a wonderful man.
Probably would have been too obvious to hang him @ this point . Thanks for all the great music Tom RIP !
SEE YA IN HEAVEN TOM PETTY. HOPE YOU WERE SAVED. ACTUALLY SEE YOU IN RAPTURE IF YOURE SAVED. YOURE ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITE !!!
I love you Tom.  When I was younger, you and your songs were there when no one else was.  Hope to see you when I get to heaven singing here comes my girl.    ; )
That's going out with your boots on. RIP
You will be missed by so many.  None so much as me.  R.I.P.  Love ya, Tom!! Peace Out!!
Is it just me or can anyone else see TP holding his chest as if in pain at the end; looked exhausted and his left arm was hanging askew as he left the stage. I think he knew what was coming and held on like the trouper he was. What a waste, 66 is young man, really young, in r n r terms; Muddy Waters was near 90. God love you Tom and say hey to the guys up there and join the best band in the world. Say happy birthday to John from us ok?
Times gone by too fast...😞bad ass song we love and miss you Tom🎇
My Fave Song RIP TOM An Iconic Man in the music industry and as a wonderful giving Human Being
Every Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers show I've seen over the past 28 years has been a treat: every show he engages with the band, the audience, and, most importantly, he ENJOYED the f*^$ outta himself. And the music: ALWAYS GREAT!  I had the honor of going to the taping of VH1 Storytellers on the last blue moon 03/31/1999. Super! and I bummed a reet:)
Thefuckenmubtomthatsnotehatslooklikebynoldzajelena
First time I saw him was in the movie FM in 78...been a fan ever since.
In tears the entire time.   I'll always be a Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers American Girl'.
Another one of the great rockers gone way too soon.RIP Tom , you were awesome.
A great American storyteller and songwriter has passed. (:
I was so fortunate to see him on 9/22/2017 @ The Hollywood Bowl with my daughter Danielle.  I enjoyed the concert so much that I considered seeing him again on 9/25/2017.  One of the best concerts that I been to in awhile (yes even better than Eric Clapton).  He interacted with the crowd and seemed to enjoy performing.  I was sadden when I heard of his untimely death.  You are gone now but your music and legacy will live on forever.  RIP Tom Petty!
so glad i got to see him in Hamburg back in 2012. I will always be a huge fan of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. RIP Brother
TOM PETTY HAS LEFT THE BUILDING \nWHAT A CLASS ACT !!!
Can't believe he is gone....too soon, too young\n. Goodbye Tom....you were the best .
RIP MY FRIEND MUCH LOVE TO FAMILY & FRIEND'S. BLESS YOUR HEART TO YOU.  HE WAS A ASWUM ARTIST THANKS FOR HIS LIFE PF THE ART.  MAKES ME SAD. 😴
Thanks for this. My heart is still broken.
i cry now everytime i watch his concerts, especially this song. there's such a passionate theme to the song, desperation and willing to do anything to follow a dream even if it meant death. Faith beyond other's belief in what you can do. What a fucking song
Heard TP on the radio in July on a road trip. Hadn’t heard of him in a long time. Thought, oh wow, he could be next. Googled him, saw he was still performing & was pleasantly surprised. What an amazing exit to rocknroll in our dimension. 😉
This is actually really good archival footage.       God bless YOU, Tom Petty.    Thanks for all of the great, American music.
What a cool guy he was. Always loved Tom Petty. Tragic loss. :-(
Bye! Tom! I know that I will keeping rocking with you, baby.
Hey Tom life is all about free falling. Thank you
Who would give this a thumbs down??! Assholes
Thanks for sharing it. To see him walk off the stage for the last time is crushing.
Saw him live at the first Farm Aid in Champaign-Urbana!  I felt like I lived his songs!  R.I.P. Mr. Petty!
He is not dead...!! hes at the end of his career..he has had enough (thank you for the past 40yrs) now go buy my records again...wake up to what really goes on on Earth...........
At least he went out doing what he loved - playing for his fans.  Thanks for all the years of fantastic music with the Willburys, solo, and with the Heartbreakers.  He will be missed.
I have loved this song since I was a teen and 'discovered' Tom Petty's music!  That was so long ago, and I have been thru the many stages of womanhood...but every time I hear this one, I still feel like that teenage girl who is amazed that a man could verbalize my thoughts and feelings.  RIP, Tom Petty...this American Girl will miss you!
Everyone comment RIP on this video for Toms appreciation...RIP
This is the first time that I’ve been really sad when a rock star died. Truly great. But with hindsight he really does look frail and unwell here.
Love Tom Petty so much.
Thank god the suits didn’t destroy Tom. RIP brother. You earned it.
He will be missed!
YOU WILL BE MISSED.........
We miss you tom petty
Watching this video of Tom Petty you can see & hear that something was amiss that night.\nAs a long time fan I can not believe that Tom Petty has left us. \nWe, us all,have lost a great rock n roll legend!!!\nRest in peace Tom. \nYour music will live on!!
Tom and the Fender 12 String. I love that his last song was played on a Fender.

Wouldn’t Sauce Boss be better?
I like it better when they tell them the right answer after they answer so they can reevaluate their whole lives.
As you can see, we can't\n\n\n\n\nI should put that on a plaque
How about PB CUP taste test?
Watching Rhett and Link suck hot sauce off a gloved finger because pornhub was down. (I'm sorry)
There's a Jack in the Box 30 minutes away from my house, which also happens to be right by my favorite park. My favorite thing to do is drive up there, chill at the park, then get 4 tacos from JITB 😂 I live in Ohio so they're not common at all, but I love their tacos.
I'm the best!\nNo, I'm the best!
as you can see we cant dunno why that cracked me up
You forgot to go over ur answers.
These guys just appreciate the taste of latex.
Del Taco hot sauce is not as spicy as they make it seem.

I want Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) to be my mom. Nobody will mess with me at school.
I hope everything is okay between the two of them. I don't know why but something seems off after watching some of their videos. Is that just me??
I would want either Jennifer Garner or Kristen Bell

Get schooled by taco bell fire sauce Rhett. Step up your buds
Do guess that subway footlong!!!
Will it chip?
I think the weird thing is, is that I watch your videos at night but you say, good mythical morning 😒 its kinda odd
you and link my mom and dad haha
:\ I really really miss the Wheel of Mythicality skits. Improv comedy is one of Rhett & Link's funniest styles, why did they get rid of them?
I wouldn't want to eather but if i had to it would be Areana Granday
Link: [due to mix of love & guilt, refuses to pick a celebrity mom]\nRhett: [without skipping a beat] I pick Cher\nXDD
Wouldn't the rubber glove mess with the taste
You should do a powdered food taste test, like if you agree.
Rhett looks like Burger King with that Crown
Kate McKinnon for a mom
The first one....... FRE SHA VOCA DO
how dare they i love taco bell's fire sauce
fast food marinara sauce taste test? I was eating Sonic mozarella sticks and I thought about this lol

Good morning people
frankensauce sounds better than saucenstein thooo
Anyone else miss the old intro lol
I love the new intro instead of the rooster on mountain
smh they really thought jack in the box would have spicy sauce
Hey guys.\nI got 100% right.
BEYONCE!!! YAS XDDD for the moooom! XD
This is something I would do. Where my hot sauce lovers at?
Okay lets make this clear, link is a duche. he does shti like this all the time... they spin the stupid wheel and it stops at QTMBA WICH IS LITTERALLY QUESTION THAT MUST BE ANSWERED!!! And link has the audacity to NOT ANSWER wtf burn in hell cuck link

Gladly they didn’t need the anti cap pill 🤣
Why Link threw up a gang sign at 3:45?
Can I borrow that finger for something? Asking for a friend.
Why do they even have any dislikes?

I like your reviews . Simple and useful.  Best on YouTube :)
everyone was bashing apple for the removal of the headphone jack........why i dont see rude comments towards google??\nLMAO HYPOCRITES
rubbish video
GOOGLE
Preference \n3rd oneplus 5\n2nd iPhone X\n\n\n\n\n1st pixel XL2
plz i want 8 plus space gray abdimoh1598@gmail.com i dont have twitter plaz i want iphone 8 plus ig is @a.moh_19
2:45 whats that crackiling??
Cameras are dope
tbh portrait mode looks like a photoshop
That ISSA 21 savage ! 👌🏾👌🏾
$399 nope
That's awesome
Just awesome
Waiting for full review
21 savage a banger🤙🏽☝️
It looks ugly
BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL
Ugly crap
3:43 fuck face
Squeezable edge over headphone jack!? No one wants that shit #justiceForWiredHeadphones
They don’t supply any head phones need to buy your own
No headphone jack - no sale. It's also $200 too expansive for either version, but so was the original Pixel imo. Side bezels are as thick as those that come on very cheap Chinese phones. Axon 7 has two front firing, stereo speakers with a great DAC for less than half the price.
Colorizer? I think you mean circular polarizer.
My reaction....... booooorrriiinng.
Neither
I think the Pixel 2 XL is awesome I will have to get one!!
Hi, great video like always. Can you maybe introduce me a bit of the car mount with wireless charing? Thanks.
It looks cheep it looks like a 50$ Chinese phone from ebay they could have actleast  gave it dual camera the camera,but the ​ lens is just descusting tbh i like the iphone 7+ lense cuase it doesn't look cheep D- for google i expectid better im disappointed
difference between the iphone 7, 8, X and Note 8 as they do the blur effect live and not after you take the photo. you can see the blur while taking the photo
side by side with lgv30 thanks.
Wish the XL came in Kinda Blue
I have no idea what Google was thinking when they designed the Google Pixel 2. It looks outdated and is overpriced.  The company is also hypocritical for making fun of Apple for their removal of the headphone jack, while they do the same thing a year later. Of course, Android fans will say that it is innovation rather than bashing them like they did with Apple.
I’m team iPhone but I wouldn’t mind switching to a pixel
I heard you stole a seat from someone at the conference?
Good to see the next generation of Pixel. A really great alternative to Samsung crapware.
Awesome Pixel 2!! Will it be available in Malaysia?
How the hell do you fumble with voice assistant? You literally just have to ask what song it is
Another question is why is Google not releasing a new tablet? I still have a Nexus 9 and would like a similar replacement that is all Google. Huawei makes great devices and may look at their tablets. I using a Mate 9 as a daily driver and it's still great. This is someone that bought the new Nexus device every year. I have not hopped on the Pixel wagon yet. Mate 9 was my Pixel XL.
How do you listen to music
Always on looks bland compared to others . I hope it can be customised
Great video, I love your content you always do a great job. I have a quick question, Is the top bezel bigger than the bottom ? I don’t know if it’s my eyes or if it is.  thanks
Out of all of the reviews i watched, this is definitely one of the best videos. Very informative.
It looks like a note 8 fugly clone
tailosive tech got his video demonetized because he said bad things about the pixel 2
Waiting for the lg v30 comparison excited to see vs with pixel xl 2 vs iphone 8, X and samsung galaxy note and 8s
does it has status light??
Am I the only one that likes how the smaller pixel 2 looks? I mean honestly I'm in it for the front facing speakers, great software experience and optimization. I'm also tired of phablets as well so there's that.
the smaller one has only oled, the bigger one has poled
we want camera comparisons!! like if u agree
Ok this might sound dumb but what’s the difference between usb 2.0 and usb 3.0
Apple: We got the ugliest phone ever. Google: Hold my beer
Instead of making the thing thinner, google could implement a headphone jack, wireless charging, maybe a better battery and the camera wouldnt be sticking out..
Any of you guys think this phone beats the iPhone x? It has a pretty fair price
im gonna have to try it out myself too. the way it sounds is that google blew apple out of the water given what has been revealed in the past few weeks. if i heard right then pixel 2 has fast charing straight from the box, nothing additional to buy?! wow!
Does both phones have RGB notification light or not? I cannot find a concrete information anywhere.
Kinda Blue = Manatee. Come one Google, get on point with the color names.
No. Only LG phones have a 18:9 aspect ratio, that's why the top and bottom bezels are bigger. The s8 and note 8 have 18,5:9 displays, thus utilizing more of the space on the front
Did anyone else notice something strange at 3:09-3:10 with the blur that it applied in the third portrait shot where he was standing _behind_ the camera? It looks like it kept him in focus but blurred the camera out. :/ Technically both he and the camera should be in focus while everything in the background is blurred. I'm guessing it's probably because the machine learning looks for a human and keeps that in focus while making everything else blurry.
Easily the best preview on the Pixel 2 and 2 XL! Still on the fence whether to get the Pixel 2 or 2 XL.  I have a red iPhone 7 plus, but not a fan of the size.  The smaller Pixel 2 would be perfect, but will the dated look bother me - hmmm
the smaller pixel 2 has an AMOLED panel not a POLED
Can i get that iphone 8 please i still got a iphone 5s , my instagram is vstacks_
What about HDR 10 or Dolby Vision support? Google didn't say a word about it.
Lol evidently you need to memorize more of your music library. :P
The phone isn't that impressive unless you're into stock android. Its like all the reviewers are forced to say positive things about the device. If any othe OEM released a phone with similar features they'd butcher it. They practically did already tho... HTC, Bixby button etc.
These phones are way better than the iPhone 8
Pro-tip: Better sound quality with Bluetooth on Android O is already possible. Thank you Sony. Activate developer options and you will see the new LDAC codec as selectable, which allows audio streaming up to 990kbps. You can also now select the sampling rate and sample size.
So savage to blur out that other guy (his army is coming to get you)
I have an s8, I feel like getting these phones isn't really an upgrade. But your getting fast updates, pure Android experience but no headphone jack, no face or iris scanner, less water resistance..... Decisions decisions.....
The phone sounds great but I don't think the display looks that appealing, it looks washed out. The tech in the phone sounds amazing!
so the only complaints i see on this phone are with looks and headphone jack. So like, the least important aspects of a phone are what people complain about. LoL
I’m wondering which one is better between LG v30 and pixel2 XL in term of daily performance.
That’s a lit phone
Great informational review. Like always, great video.
Astute watchers will ponder whether he got coffee with Kyle or not...
This phone looks like a winner. Sure, it has a little bit of bezels, but it’s functionality and camera make up for it...And that unlimited photo/video cloud storage. Hyped.
Fantastic video ! I'm not even going to buy the Pixel but I enjoyed this. Thanks.
No headphone jack🤔 I thought they liked that thing.I guess they’ll be copying Apple from now on.
The normal one would look and prob just feel alot better with curved edges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is coming from a g6 user
It's called a polarizer my dude
please someone tell me the diference betwen this and the samsung s8. i mean even google lens= bixby vision
Why is the flash and the camera swapped on some, but Normal on others?
I'm buying! Was going for the V30 but saw it today at Verizon and it's much wider than i thought. The V30 wasn't a very comfortable fit in my hand.
Honestly, i dont really like the new design i kind of like the old design better but thats just how i feel
Best thing is the front firing speakers 👍
Personally I would love it if you do a video showing and comparing a few sound options. E.g how does audio sound using regular corded in ear earphones over the provided dongle? Would buying a different dongle improve sound? How does audio over the dongle compare to audio from the 3.5mm jack on first pixel. Perhaps also test some native usbc headsets and Bluetooth options so we can get a better understanding of sound quality across the different options we now have.
The front panel on the Pixel 2 looks really cheap compared to the XL.
XL looks ok, but Pixel is really meh~ 2015 looking. First iPhone then Pixel, I don't appreciate they are doing this. Just give us the best only!
Definitely looking forward to the in depth review. Also get a hold of Google's new headphones and do a review on them.
Can you please make a batman or nightwing theamed gaming setup because I would love to see that?!?!?!!!????!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!????!
That was cool! Your good at these videos!! (Props) Also you have some good information!! Hope some one who needs it wins your giveaways I want but people need
Shit... You had me till The removal of the headphone jack :(
Blah blah blah. If you want great camera, get a DSLR.
I am excited about Pixel 2 XL, but damn, I live in Latin America, and here, they don't sell those phones.\nFor Google, we are so poor and we do not cover their needs, that's why we aren't gonna see Google in a near future.\nGreetings from Mexico City, Mexico.
I'm I the only one who doesn't get the sudden obsession with bezel size?
No headphone jack, No micro SD card slot, Not water resistant = Pass
Well that was very disappointing. When I saw Google mocking Apple for removing their head phone jack i thought this would ensure the jack to stay in the pixel 2.   CONS: No head phone jack, added camera hump, thick bezels are my deal breakers. I'll stick to my Nexus 6P for another year.
Those wireless assistant buds are a shitty excuse to remove the jack. They could make a first iteration of wired g. Assistant earbuds using the phone's tech reducing weight on them. Also keeping the 3.5mm

You make it look so easy 😍

Rimmel London has SO many cool products out, just not available to us in the US. I wanna try so many things, the main one being the Contour Stick! I seriously have been thinking about saying fuck it & ordering it from Amazon bc I honestly don't think it will EVER be available in the US!
‘ just because we’re dead doesn’t mean we can’t highlight ‘ 😂😭💅
Just cause we dead doesn't mean we can't highlight 😂☠

Loved his video! Defo scary but glam at the same time
You're accent is fucking E V E R Y T H I N G. UGGGH MAWMA 😍😍
honestly when i die the highlighting trend is going to be something that people look back and cringe at (lookin at you overplucked brows) but im gonna demand in my will that they highlight me to the gods bc just because we dead doesnt mean we cant highlight
Celebrate death. Dumb people buy products to help the zionists
Love it!  Love everything about it!! 💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️
Thank you so much for simplifying this and making it actually seem doable! 😊
Such a cool look
Simple but absolutely incredible!! I'm doing this for Halloween!! loooooove!!!
This was amazing!!!! So good! You should do an actual day to night makeup look. Like how you'd fix up your foundation/concealer and everything too! That would be great to see!
You're gorgeous and have stunning eyes! Quite frankly, you make me sick! Lol! Kidding. You really are very beautiful, though. :)

Lol i always dipping my fries to chocolate sundae bruv , salty and sweet at same time
OMG. I went to Korea over the summer and stayed at a dorm at a university and the first morning I ate breakfast there I spent a good 5 minutes trying to get the lid open for the jam for my bread and theN I TURNED OUT I JUST NEEDED TO SQUUZE IT JUST LIKE THE CHOCOLATE AND I WAS SO MINDBLOWN. I love Korea.
Wendy's French fries with chocolate frosty are good.
어우 저건 좀 아닙니다
김치초콜릿있어요...
영상항상잘보고가요\n!!ㅋㅋㅋ\n저초코감튀맥날꺼궁금하네요...\n어제어떤푸드트럭에서저걸'악마의감자'인가?암튼고딴식으로팔길래사먹었는데진짜악마...초코가맛없긴처음..쏘덴졀
엄마가 먹는것갖고 장난치지말랬는데 이젠 식당에서 장난치네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
한국 빅맥케이스 좋아요.. 인도네시아는 몇년 전부터 빅맥케이스가 치킨너깃케이스랑 비슷해 졌는데 햄버거 집어들면 양상추가 후두둑하고 떨어져요.. 진짜 귀찮아.. 휴...
근데 김치 초콜렛 있어요!!! 다음 도전은 이걸로 해보시면 어떨까요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
미니언즈 바나나콘도 그렇고 와플 후라이도 그렇고 이것도 다 제 취향에는 안 맞네요.. 뭔가 맥도날드 신메뉴는 거르게 됩니다 ^^;
로이스 초콜릿에 감자칩+초콜릿 있는데 일본 맥도날드에서 그걸 보고 오 이거 해볼까? 한국 맥도날드에서 어 이거 우리도 해볼까? 한것같아요ㅋㅋㅋ 이건 아니야...ㅠㅠ 로이스 감자칩 드세요
일본에서 파는 로이스 초콜릿칩 엄청 맛있어요!!! 맥주 땡기는, 단짠의 조화!!!!
추석 잘보내셨나요? 좋은 일 있으시던데, 오늘 티비보다가 JTBC2에서 영국남자 1회 재방송하더라구요 올리 아버님오셔서 삼합드시고 청계산 올라가신거 두편 연속 나오더군요 깜짝 놀랐어요 유투브보고 있는줄 알고 순간 착각해네요ㅋㅋ\n성공하셨네요\n축하드려요

영국남자 JTBC2에서 방영하네요 방금보고 깜놀~
이제 방송에서도 보게되었네요? 유튜브서 인기있던 여러개 묶어서 방송될 거래요 ㅋㅋ 조엘 매운 꼬치 나오나요 ㅋㅋㅋ
오늘도 재미잇게 보고가요!\n아참 그리고 조쉬님 jtbc2에 영국남자하던데 \n이제 티비까지타시고..우와 축하드려요
오늘 tv를 봤는데 jtbc에서 영국 남자를 하고있네여!
JTBC2에서 영국남자 하던데 대~~박사건!!!
맥도날드에 초코 프라이 시키고 이거 봤는데.. 아직 배달안왔는ㄷ 어쩌면 좋나요..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
얼마전에 jtbc에서 영국남자 영상나오던데 어떻게 된건가요?!
I used to dip the fries in my mcflurries something about salty and sweet that just tasted good lol
Hey guys. There is Kimchi Chocolate on sale in Korea.\nin Lotte Department stores in Myungdon, there is kimchi chocolate.\nIt is for foreigners, basically. as you know, kimchi is somewhat symbol of korean food.\nso some peoples actually think kimchi chocolate makes sense.\nI didn't eat it. 'cause I am not such adventurous. If your imagination and curiosity makes wonder the combination kimchi and chocolate, I wish you good luck.
부먹이다다ㅏ다다다
맛있는데???
초코스소 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
벌칙인가요? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
딘 너무 귀여움 곰같애
영국남자님 jtbc 2에 영상 나온 거 축하드려요! TV 돌리다가 나오더라고요!
너겟하고 빅맥에도 섞어먹을줄몰랐닽ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
댄이랑 한국먹방투어 시리즈 끝났나요...????? 그거만기다리고있는데 ㅠㅠ
단:맛좋다 그치? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 너무 평온하잖아 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Dan is so cool ❤ cause hes always open to trying new things. Hes awesome every time you have him in your videos.
But sundae and chips are so good! A really good crispy fries, not the soggy one, is like the pastry of a pie. Have a try on it!
현 맥날 코리아 CEO 미쳤음..
입맛이 죄다 반대임
조엘 진짜 너무좋지않나요 내 이상형...진짜 너무 조하
Oh wow i think i just saw Joel coming out from my downstairs with bike 😮 unbelievable! 맞는지 모르겠지만 반갑네요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 와우
보통 일반적인 한국 사람들도 서양 음식인 감자튀김에 서양음식인 초콜렛을 섞는 끔찍한 상상은 안하지 저건 창의적인게 아니라 괴랄한거니까
초콜릿빅맥 흠...인터뢰스팅
초콜릿에 마약 들어있는듯
이거 완전맛있었는데..
조쉬 진짜 신나보여ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
작년 이맘때 일본가서 저 초콜릿 감자튀김을 먹었는데 그땐 할로윈 시즌이라 주황색초콜릿도 추가되었었어요 전 한입먹고 안먹었습니다
진심 맥도날드 대장균 버거는 먹지좀 말자...
단 진짜 맛있게 먹는거 같아요 ㅎㅎㅎ!!
I’ve been binging on your channel! Love it!! Can’t believe I haven’t found yous sooner (I’m from the UK too!!)
맛있을...것 같ㅇ...ㅏ.... 저게 바로 단짠단짠인가..
개맛있는데
감자튀김에 초콜릿은 아닌듯ㅠ
chocolate and waffle fries would probably be tasty
딘은 볼수록 한국남자
완전 웃김 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
조쉬 김치초콜렛 있어요...... 물론 한국인도 극혐하는 음식이지만;;;
I saw you guyz!!!저번 목요일 저녁에 연트랄파크에서 놀고있는 조엘이랑 단봤어요ㅋㅋㅋ조엘 웃음소리가 완전 존재감 쩔었네요 넘나 팬이라고 아는척하고 싶었는데 참았어요!!😆😆😆😆
레알루다가  단 특집 가요...ㅜㅜㅜ 넘 재미써영
일본 에서도 초콜릿 감자칩 유행하고 있어요^^♡♡♡
저.. 그 we do put kimchi in chocolate... 일본에 김치 초콜릿이 판매 된적이 있구요 의외로 괜찮다고 하네요 먹어본적은 없지만.. 그리고 청국장 초콜렛도 있는데 그건 맛있습니다. 색달라요
Death Wish: 이곳에선 순화해서 '죽음의 소망'이라고 했지만 원뜻은 '자살행위' 라는 뜻을 가지고 있습니다
호불호 확실하겠다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
저런소스포장이 없다니 뭔가 그게더 신기하다ㅋㅋㅋ
면도날드는 괴상한 상품을 개발했군... 맛이 이상할 듯..
진짜 이분은 영상하나하나가 거의 레전드임ㄷㄷ
ㅋㅋㅋ 갑자기 케찹에 밥 비벼먹거나 버터에 밥말아 먹거나 우유에 밥 말아 먹는 거 생각나네요. 영국남자는 우유에 밥 말아 먹는 거 못 할듯. 아는 사람들은 아는데 꿀맛이죠 ㅋㅋ
오 맞는말같아요 라이스푸딩같은거 생각도 못해봤는데!
먹어보지는 않았는데 그렇지 김치초콜릿 있는 거로 알고 있습니다. 김치 무슨 행사에서 나왔다고 하더라고요. 전 개인적으로 먹어보고 싶네요.
생각보단 맛있었는데 너무달아서 차라리 케찹이 더 나은것같아요 글구 초콜릿 너무 적은것 같아요! 초콜릿 묻은 곳을 다 먹고 나면 just 감자튀김을 먹어야되서 ㅠ
맛이 정말 별론가보네요; 옛날에 먹어본 초콜릿 돈까스는 맛있던데요!뜨거운 초콜릿소스가 위에 끼얹어져있었죠. 초코덕후라 취향이었을지도 모르지만요ㅋㅋ
난 와플감자는 좋아하고..\n초콜릿 뿌리는건 안좋아하는 편^^;\n\n영국남자팀.. 늘 즐겁게 촬영해줘서 고마워요!
사람마다 입맛이 다르잖아~ㅎㅎ
그렇게까지 깊게 생각하진않을 듯 그냥 단짠 좋아 !!!!!!! 단짠 대세!!!!!!!! 이러다가 오 감튀는 짜고 초콜릿은 다니깐 얘들 섞으면 대박일듯 하고 걍 한듯
프라이스는 시럽 조금 뿌리고 소프트아이스크림 얹어먹으면 환상입니다. 단짠의 끝판왕이에요. 보장!!\nJust pour little bit of syrup and soft ice cream. It’s marvelous. I guarantee!!
역시조엘ㅎㅎ웃음소리되게귀여워요!!취향이독특한가..??ㅋㅋ
조쉬님! 해리포터와 관련된 영국 도시나 그런 곳 가서 리뷰(?) 찍어주셨으면 좋겠어요😊 영국을 가지 못하기 때문에 대리만족이라도 정말 하고싶네요 !
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 로이스 초콜릿감자칩 맛있어요!
저거 진짜 맛없는데... 리뷰보고 드시지 ㅋㅋㅋ
조엘님의 리액션 충분히 공감이 갑니다. 한국사람이  김치에 초콜릿 소스를 뿌려서 먹는 느낌이었을 겁니다. 뇌에서 거부감이...
절대먹지말아야겟닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ도전한다고 수고하셨어요~!
영국사람들에게 찜닭 먹이기 하면 좋겠다
초코 소스 치킨 너겟 & 백 맥..ㅎㄷㄷ \n세 분 촬영하시고 나서 뱃속은 괜찮으셨나요?ㅋ
영국남자 맛있는 녀석들에 나와도 좋을듯
엥..먹을만하던데...근데 건강이 나빠지는 기분이 드는 맛이긴 함.  물론 맥날에서 건강해지는 맛이 있겠냐만은 초코감튀는 더욱 더.
홍어라던가 꼼장어라던가 해산물 편을 즐겨봤습니다! 슬슬 과메기에 도전해 보시는건 어떨까요?\n과메기...저는 못 먹는 과메기....대리만족하고 싶습니다ㅠ~ㅠ
한국 10대들의 유행어들을 배워보는 시간을 가져보는 것도 좋을 것 같아요! 줄임말 같은 경우도 한국은 ㅇㄱㄹㅇ, ㅂㅅ 처럼 자음만 적을 수도 있잖아요. 영어와 한국어의 유행어들을 비교해보는 시간을 가져봐도 좋을 것 같아요!
*Sponsored by Mcdonald’s
조쉬님 즐거운 추석 보내세요!
조쉬!! 한국에는 김치초콜렛이 있어요ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ!!!!!! 평소에는 잘 구할 수 없지만 인천공항에 있는 양반김 파는 매장에 김치초콜렛도 같이 팔아요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ!!! 사는사람이 거의 없어서 인지 구석에 잘 안보이는데 있긴해요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한번 영국으로 돌아갈때 먹어보세요 ㅋㅋ!
어우....진짜 싫다. 저런 조합은 너무 싫어 으으...
초코 후라이 진짜 맛있는데ㅠㅠ
아니에요..우리도 이상해요 ㅠㅠ 기껏 한정판 만들어서 저런러나 내놔...
영국남자님 영국시민들이 한국 불량식품을 먹는다면 올려주세요
어서와 한국은 처음이지 나왔으면 좋겠에용!!
둘이 왜저러삼 ㅜㅜ 맛나게 먹는 사람 생각도 좀 해주지 막 구역질까지야  ..참고로 전 먹어본적 없음 푸하하하
더 재미있는 먹방부탁드립니다
서대문 형무소 체험어떤가요??
Monopoly guy is great but what does that equifax CEO shine his head with?
This video missed the best part. When he wipes his brow with a stack of money.
Wonderful work.
I am so relieved he had a Monocle... I thought for a moment he would fail but HE DID NOT
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
quality troll
This is amazing.  \nAnd this man is fucking HERO.
How did I do guys?
Oh this makes my day.
That monocle though!!!
That person is a Female, get yo facts straight y’all
this dude is my spirit animal
hello there, fellow redditors
When the monocle came out .......dead
That's a woman btw
The hero we need
This dude's head is brighter than my future
Plot twist... that's actually a woman in that costume
Seem to be two kinds of people here, those remember him having a monocle and people tha think it is some sort of conspiracy! It is not an effect, you just never played the game!
And a new hero emerges.
This is world class trolling
Thanks for the Free Parking. -_o
The fact that the disguise didn't raise any alarms says it all. He fit right in. 😂😂
This is trending???
“Hello, my name is Mr. Snrub.”
Get that woman a tv show!
now that's how you fucking protest,  take notes people
This is the reason why I want to attend these meetings
Is there a black man behind the monopoly guy?
Hahahahahah this should be #1 on trending that's epic
The monocle puts this over the top.
And another thing we will not honor the flag it was not for black people because it's the same as the Confederate flag. It's just a raggedy piece of material. White people tell us all the time we're not American. So don't expect us to honor the flag with the racist song that go with it
fun fact!!!!\n*the monopoly guy doesn't wear a monocle*\n👀
i didn't not know wade wilson was here.
Thumbnail looks like a bald Ryan Reynolds
Modern Breaches, a why to say we sold your information to the highest bidder.
And YOU must be the Monopoly guy...thanks for the free parking.
But what if they hired her to distract you from the real issue??
Jews control America's Federal Reserve and foreign policy.
Just because they wear a top hat and cardboard mustache and wipe their brow with fake money doesn't mean they are trolling... 😃\nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I wish for a interruption. But anyway nice job !
Hilarious and original!! Love it.
He's practicing for Halloween x)
I have never laughed so hard at something in my life before. Hahaha, well done good sir. Well done.
This is how Trump got elected people dont know how to do their jobs and screen and check peoples identity properly hes probably a russian spy
It’s not just the freeze part.
These guys sell all their shares prior to making their WE BEEN HACKED announcement and yet no charges for fraud? This infuriates me.
Apparently the Mandela Effect suggests the Monopoly guy NEVER wore a monocle? What do YOU remember?
Baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors application has the particular fun and nonmedical objective. \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
He had a monocle in a different reality I'm 100% sure its the Mandela effect in action.
I guess everyone's doing a side show now too
Now this... this is nice.
if this is considered trolling then the women's march was a successful protest
Crazy part is thats no troll. Thats actually Sam Walton founder of Walmart reinvigorated and given a new body to live out immortality.
Best laughs I have in weeks :'D
This is why I joined the internet.
Wait the monopoly guy never had a monocle though
This is the best thing ever
It’s funny that this will be trending and plenty of people will write comments here but how many of you will actually call or write your representatives to protect your life and livelihood?\n\nTake 30 seconds to contact them: \nCopy and paste:\nPlease federally limit personal and small business liability for fraudulently used identifying information and replace the social security number system.\n\nThen sign it and mail it your representatives.\n\nAlternatively google your state for your senator/house representative and call them at the number on their website to say the same as the above message.\n\nIf legislation is properly implemented this could literally save your life, your child’s college saving, your family’s lives or your local small business for an investment of 30 seconds today.\n\n(Flagrantviolations.com)
so funny I forgot to laugh
I looooove him. Thank you dude!
Thats really funny
Oh and by the way black people. Notice how for 50 years they've been telling us where 13% of the population think about it they've been telling us that for 50-60 years don't you think we have grown by now
Mr pennybags doesn't wear a monocle
lmao
Lmao
lmfao
damn that, Pennybags! lol
you're doing great sweetie
wilford brimley's office please
Fucking NORMIES, REEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nothing will happen to Equifax.
so much win.
TOP KEK!
Shenanigans mah boy!! Shenanaigans I say!
yes!
Legend
Yeah, right flexing .
Iconic
IMPOSTER
at least it was a humorous protest 👏
This. Is. Youtube. Trending.
Savage 🤣
Uncle pennybags doesn't have a monocle.
Equifax trolled over 3 million people out of 160 million dollars, LUL.
:-)
Promoted by Youtube
That guy’s head is brighter than my future...
Hey YouTube black people will not be silent. You will not shut us up. We are God's chosen people from negroland no such thing as a white Jesus. Black people don't support banana Republic they want to try to tell people black people what to do with their hair
monopoly man don't wear a monicl
Why does YouTube say a woman  dresses as the Monopoly guy... That's a guy in the video

omg man i couldnt see these youtuber Having chances to Meet my CR7 😭😭 THAT SHOULD BE THE FAKIN ME !!! FUCK
It was fifa 18 mobile version
I deserve these boots because I been there when all dose haters be hating and I watched every single games and he is my espirition to become a professional soccer player and I love him and I love the boots plz
I really really would love those signed boots. I'm Cristiano Ronaldos BIGGEST fan he is all I talk about or think about. I know everything about him and it would be a dream come true to own those boots. I love football so having those boots would be amazing. I also love your channel and I'm so happy for you that you met him and that you were really selfless getting him to sign the boots to give away when you could've just kept it for yourself. I really hope you pick me!! SIIIUUUUUUUUUUU
I want to have these boots because i have a signed Show from Messi and a now the Boot from Ronaldo Is missing. I would be very happy If i could get these boots
You should've done a nutmeg match, plz do one with him 👍👍👍
I think I deserve it because I watch your channel a long time ago and was a dream get that boots, it was a dream see you one day \nBig UP bro !
Hi man go and pay Messi a visit please
I probably deserve these because they are just as beautiful as the game football
I deserve these boots because you are my YouTube Idol and Ronaldo is my football Idol (you wore the boot and Ronaldo signed it), also because i watch every of your videos in dutch although i'm german/english😅😅
GREAT WORK. If I win these cleats I wouldn’t just say I won cleats touched my Ronaldo and signed by him. I’ll say I also won cleats that were in the possession of touzani.
I don't care if I win the boots I just want to know what the song at the end is 😂😂
I want and deserve the shoes because I play football since I remember myself and cr7 is my favorite player
I wanna win this sneakers because what I learned in life is whatever you wanna do whatever your dream is you can always achieve it! By working hard , believing in yourself and being a good person! Because any one from any where can do ANYTHING ! Share love always ! en uiteraard omdat ik van voetbal hou en zeker van RONALDO !!
I deserve them because I needed a pair of football boots as to qualify for my team but don't have one... \nI need them because ronaldo is everything for me ..My life...My love ... Everything...He was the one who inspired me to play football ....
They look so good and i want to feel good when i put them on lol
Name of song please 🙏🙏
I want them because I want to impress my team and because I love Ronaldo.
Did anyone see Ronaldo JR in the video

Esse é o grande CR7⛹️
Siiiii
Je pense que je mérite les chaussures de football parce que je suis un fan de Cristiano Ronaldo depuis de nombreuses années, je l'ai vu quand il était au Sporting, Manchester United, et maintenant à Madrid! Il est mon idole et sera pour toujours, je le considère comme un joueur de football, mais aussi comme une personne, il m'a aidé à traverser des moments difficiles, c'est simplement mon héros.
Mon rêve est d'avoir cette espadrille\nya6034036@gmail.com/ Av Abi Houraira 63 Rue Panama Zohour 1 Fes/ Maroc
Tener los zapatos firmados de mi ídolo , todo un sueño. No hay otra explicación para tener esas botas que sin duda significarían mucho para mí. Espero ganar touzani 👌😉🙏
Kannst du die Telefonnummer von Ronaldo geben
Will die Schuhe weil ich richtig cool bin\n\n\n\n\nNicht._.
Que bueno porque no entiendo ni mierda jaja
Goed geregeld man👍🏻 ben jaloer

WOW
Oh oh turkiye

Lol

Des no ronaldo
Genietennnn Touzani!
song please
Ronaldo is mijn lievelings speler
Ronaldo !!!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Cómo estas con él por qué
Volgende keer misschien een vrouwelijke speelster ??
Omdat ik al zins me 4 de fan ben van Ronaldo en als ik hem maakt mij dat heel gelukkig
ik zo ze heel graag willen winnen maar ik weet geen goede reden
Ik zou ze graag willen hebben want ik hoop ooit dat ik zulke schoenen kan krijgen of kopen
Ik wil zo graag winnen! Ik kijk al jaren naar je serie en ook op YouTube, maar dit is denk wel de leukste samen met Nouri en van de beek
Omdat ik wil de schoenen  van Cristiano Ronaldo ik ben heele groote fan
Ik wil hem omdat ik echt super super super fan ben van cristiano ronaldo alsjeblieft daar zou ik echt\nBlij mee zij.
Die schoenties zijn van mij XD omdat ik er heel lekker mee aanvallers zou kunnen tackelen en touzani panna's geven
waarom ik die schoen wil ik ben groot fan van Cristiano Ronaldo en ik wacht al de hele tijd om die schoen en misschien goed om de voetballen en triks
Ik vind je de beste voetbaler en joutuber en ik vind de shoen ook  mooi
Touzani ik wil de schoenen winnen omdat ronaldo m'n nummer 1 voetballer is en door hem ben ik beter geworden en jij ook jij ben nummer 1 freestyler voor mijn. \nEn je ben ook de beste youtuber\nGroetjes jens

Attiva i sottotitoli tu che fai la prima media e non sai un'emerita minchia di inglese
Kenapa bahasa Indonesia yg dipilih tolong jawab?
والله تفرحنا بهاي مقاطعك استمر🌸
HAAHAHHAH KALM AAN KALM AAN Ronaldo ging stuk er om
moest ik u zijn Touzani ik ging overal mijn handtekening vragen en ik wil die schoenen want ik kan het niet geloven man
Ik vind dat ik de schoenen verdien omdat Ronaldo een grote superheld voor me is en mijn vrienden geloven niet dat ik schoenen van Cristiano kan hebben. Ik denk ook dat als je aan het voetballen bent en dat  je je dan beter voelt als je die schoenen aanhebt (Hoop het)
Ik wil ze hebben want ik zit op hockey 😂
ronaldo is gwn de beste even goe al u youtube kanaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal
Omdat ik veel verzamel met van alles wat te maken heeft met voetbal
Ik wil et winnen omdat u gaat mij niet goloven maar ik en echt fan Cr7 en ok ik wil later gaan voetballen aar ik heb geen voetbalschoenen en kben ook niet zo heel rijk

Ik zit net op voetbal en ik mag naar de selectie maar ik heb geen goede schonen
Ik wil die schoenen want ik schoot van afstand zoals Ronaldo en ze zijn mooi. Toen dacht ik, ik was C.Ronaldo Doei Touzani
Ik wil graag de schoenen omdat, Nike mijn favoriete merk is en Ronaldo ook mijn favoriete speler is.
Ik kan wel een paar schoenen  verbruiken
Gapp,\nIk moet die schoenen gewoon hebben man.\nLaatst zocht ik naar die schoen wat denk je.\nZe waren nep.\nEn nu kan ik ze gratis winnen met ronaldo's handtekening\n\nNee maar even serieus.\nIK WIL DIE SCHOENEN GEWOON OUWE!\n\nGr. Iza\n\nInstagram: izamulder_\n\nbeng beng

Voor mijn zieke broer
How much garbage did they throw in a single space walk???
Lmao. They are supposed to be 300 mile up. But it looks like they are 1000's of miles up.
Down voted. Don´t be like yanks and over dramatize videos with shit music.
i did not know a dangerously amount of people had mental retardation in these comments!
obvious fake.  they only come out with this using a 360 camera b/c it's totally distorting any normal view. Take a normal camera, HD, out on a space walk, and pan it all around slowly. Show us the millions of stars behind you, show us the curve, show us the moon, show us the thousands of satellites.  Oh yeah, it's all FAKE
They threw a satellite to launch it? LOL There goes the space station! BWAHAHAHA!!!!!! \n\nI absolutely love their stupidity with the giant glowing hot spot reflection of the sun on the fake globe image scrolling above the swimming pool. The sun can't do that if it's 93 million miles from earth you idiots. \n\nDamn Russians are terrible at this. Better let hollywood and NASA handle the fake space swimming pool stuff.
No amount of flat-Earth retardation could possibly take away from how badass this is. I'm jealous of these cosmonauts.
You cant argue with Flat Earthers because they only accept their opinions and everything else is a government lie. Flat Earthers are egotistical douchebags that do no science or even ATTEMPT to prove flat earth, because they think science was invented by the government. \n\nThese flat earthers see something, and accept it as fact. They see no curves from a mountain, so flat earth. You see curvature from a plane, its a lens. \n\nWith flat earthers, everything is a lie unless they make it up.
The only thing that flat earth retards have to fear is the sphere itself.
Bravo, Russia!!!
Bullshit where are all the satalits in space
Not gonna lie. I just cried my eyes out while watching this. That's a feeling and view so few people ever get to see for real. One of the most powerful things I've ever been a part of.
This is really cool. I didn't even realise that Youtube supported this kind of video.
You know it's a bad day for Flat Earthers when they can't blame NASA for being exposed as idiots.
I know that the Earth is round, but these videos can be seen as fake :P
First time in the Universe is a big call.
Oh yay! The earth is still round.... I can carry on my day without a care on this globe! Also despite the slight grain, amazing camera work!
If the earth was actually flat 1: why wouldn't North Korea or any number of countries that hate america expose the scheme to destabilise their country and 2: what do they have to gain from pretending that its flat and 3: what do they do with the thousands upon thousands of people who's jobs depend on knowing that the earth is round, are all those people in on it yet there's never been a single blown whistle in all of history?
Where's the sun?
*laughs at all the flat earthers*
Thanks for all the risk
Google Earth in VR scared the shit out of me and I was safely in my bedroom.\n\nThese guys are nuts.
It seems fltat earth moviment has gaining momentum all around the world.
Wow there a lot of people who need to go back to school in these comments
Where the sun and the stars?
Wow if RT show a clip from Gravity the morons would swallow it 😛
Dat Satellite Deployment....\n\nGuess the old joke is true. America would spend millions of dollars to figure out how to deploy a hand held Satellite.\nThe Russians? They would just throw it 'out a window'.
sapceFIGHTS? 5? I bet that the first ones will had a russian on it but already 5??!  jejejej
Earth is as flat as my man boobs.
This is really impressive, and the levels of salt and denial of the flat -earthers in the comments is hillarious.
Flat Earthers: If the Earth is flat, give us a 360 video instead of photos and static ones!\n\nRussians: Hold my fucking vodka comrade...\n\n*Russians and RT make first ever 360 space video*\n\nFlat Earthers: You actually did it? U-Uh, we-well...uh...FAKE, CGI, PHOTOSHOP, RUSSIAN/HOLLYWOOD LIES!\n\n*Russia and the rest of the planet's population who aren't living in the 3rd century and have developed common sense sigh in frustration*\n---\nPlease, can we just send one of these Flat Earthers up into space and broadcast it live so that when they remove their helmet the whole world can watch as the air is sucked from their lungs and they fucking implode?
Thanks a lot to the Russians people from spoutnik to today .\n     Cordialy Riad from Paris :-)
Give me a 24h version of this without the constant blabbering and some Atmospheric Music \nthats all i want and need
Obviously a Russian conspiracy to take over the space program from the US.
THE EARtH IS FLAT! EVERYONE AROUND THE GLOBE KNOWS THAT!
I'll give you this one Russia... ;) Seriously great
4K screen is great but what u really need are some VR goggles
Good evening. For the ignorant and the dubious: Take your camera outside in a beautiful night full of stars and take a picture. You will be disappointed because your camera hardly detects the dim light from most of the stars. Now try again with a flash light infront of your camera and you will see 0 stars. In my analogy the flash light is Earth. Thats why we see a black sky during most of the ISS feed. Fellow humans, stop dumbing the fuck out, we have dark days ahead and dumb cunts yelling that the Earth is flat is the last thing we need while we try to not suffocate in our own garbage. Have a good day.
Wtf am I look at exactly?
Got youtube set to HD but all i get is blurred shit \nFFS nasa send a proper camera up yah bunch of wankers
Awesome!
Fake !
Truly amazing in every sense of the word!
I call bullsheite on first time in the universe. I highly doubt that is accurate.

БУХАХА эпичный запуск нано коробки... но не по феншую, надо было с пендаля ее зарядить))
на этом шарике, прекраснейшем, такое гавно развели все подряд, не хочетя и приближаться, так бы и остался там... в космосе
Земля разве не плоской должна быть?
Maravilhosa vista do nosso planeta , TERRA ,e de fundo o Universo , seria incrível podermos acompanhar o espaço com uma câmera 360° ,daria para fazer um  google space view  kkk
Fake as hell as always. Took them a month to release it. Where's the 360 degree camera sweep done by the astro-not?
I didn't know that satellites are launched like this - just manually throwing them into the space old fashioned way  😁
It's me, (most intelligent ever born), who knows what was before singularity, what's outside our universe and more; but human is cruel, (especialy USA and its fasal-states); due to this i have ethical reasons not to share.
take this all you flatearthers ....
Lets say just for a minute the Earth WAS flat, so fucking what?  The only people that the physics of a flat Earth are even of importance to (pilots, engineers, astronauts etc) are the people who know it's not flat anyway.  Fucking lol.
Yea I don't believe on the flat earth but can it be more fake ? I mean com on guys if you can't see the fake on this video we are doomed lol
This is the crappiest attempt to debunk the flat earth I've ever seen, it's complete shit but the music is good I guess...
Is it just for me or does the video look blurry as heck? This is pretty cool and I hope they can put up more - but much higher quality 360 cameras in space.
Что за отсталые поставили дислайки?
Looks so flat. Case closed XD

Can you imagine? Wow!
Первый комментарий от представителя Российской Федерации, оставлен :D
а есть исходник без обрезания и наложения доп эффектов? он был бы лучше но работа космонавтов заснятая на 360 г камеру завораживающаяся
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS GARBAGE ????
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IfwaY-F4SM\n\nMaybe USA never went to the moon, but it is not transparent. I saw it block the sun in August.
THEY ALTERED THE VIDEO  SINCE YESTERDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   HOLY SHIT         ANYBODY HAVE THE ORIGINAL VIDEO STILL I HOPE?     HAHAHAHAH   THEY GOT CAUGHT SHOWING A RETARDEDLY FAST SPINNING EARTH  AND NOW THEY TRY TO ZOOM IN  SO ITS NOT AS NOTICEABLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fAKE
Ewidentnie widać że Ziemia jest płaska :P he he
Whats that at 3:04?
This is cgi
✖️ marks the spot 💀🌀🌞🤘🏼
круто
No femenazis or muslims up there. Heaven.
Question to flat earthers;\n If you were given the chance to prove the earth was flat but the evidene you gathered showed it to be a sphere, what would stop your fellow flat earthers from simply ignoring your evidence and claiming you're now part of the conspiracy?
They forgot the add in the stars again
This is incredible
FAKE\nCLOUDS DONT MOVE AT ALL! GO OUTSIDE, PUT YOUR IPHONE TO TIMELAPSE, POINT AT CLOUD, RECORD 1 MINUTE, THEN PLAY. U WILL SEE THE CLOUD MOVE *SO MUCH* ON TIMELAPSE THAT THIS VIDEO SHOULD HAVE SO MUCH MORE CLOUD MOVEMENT. IM SICK OF THESE VIDEOS.
Earth is flat\nBastards from russia started the modern brainwashing
That is just amazing footage.
Awesome
but what happens with the people water is your answer to the flat or spherical earth the water is always level and can not curve
The earth is flat this is not real it is done in studio .
This is nasa fakel...stúdió felvétel....hollywood movie...
Where are the stars?
Faker than Kim Kardashian's ASS
Not saying Earth is flat but this looks fake as fuck.
4:30 in   /watch?v=y5EierZiyrY     a diver in space lol :D from these same russian astronauts. All of it is fake /watchv=y5EierZiyrY\n\nIf you still think this is real after seeing a diver in space, then you need to have your head checked. Reality says it's a fucking LIE and done in the water pool. Thanks bye, the earth is flat, what else would they be hiding ;) It's not about money either, they have all the money they want. It's about control
aliasing suggests cgi edges. any video processor can handle processing smooth curved angles on film but cgi has tells. God hates liars, but i'm sure all the freemason or athiest astronauts know that already.
Fake.  The Earth is flat.  Fuck Roscosmos ! Fuck NASA !  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5ZN289jjDo
This looks so real I almost believe it to be real. HAHAHA  hehehehehe  stupid Americans, stay away from my kids
Super :-)
cgi team used the wrong altitude. this video is rendered at 1533km altitude.
inb4 flat-earthers: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This is not 360 degrees.
guys! omg f ree amazon gift cards from here ➜ lythu.com/giftcardsgiveaway?94226667
The video is fascinating 🙈
not a fan of the video or the song.
How can you exist?
I didn't think I could be genuinely let down by someone I've never met.
My girl is back! <3
This song is such a jam and I love this video and we don't deserve this goddess
i never saw a video so critically smart like that lately, CONGRATS GIRL!!!
this is Hot! love it!
Yep. Count me in. Equal parts catchy and weird. She's brilliant. Hopefully this album is just as great as the last St. Vincent. With her incredible talent, I'm not too worried.
i love it  xD
that hair is serving Charlie and the Chocolate Factory realness.
Watch at 1.25 speed
qotsa vibes
PRE ORDERED WITH NO REGRETS!!!
Does anybody know what kind of glasses is the girl wearing at 00:22?? Any ideas about the brand, stylist?
I just wish the video included the try to write youa love song, but it comes out a lament part :(
This is very much in the style of acceptable in the 80s video clip, but way better and meaningful.
Ignoring the haters. The subtext of this song is amazing. Once again another case of not being able to win over listeners who do not like the change in the sound. Keep it up Annie! :)
1:22 looks like a reference to Cassandra.
Annie’s so hot
Annie has inspired me since 2007 to make music. And now my first single is out. Hope you don't mind checking it out \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NswGc-Y8Zw
she's so pretty
She's really grown as an artist. I like her newer songs more than her older. I know that's just a matter of personal taste, but generally speaking, for most artists the opposite seems to be true, that what's generally regarded as their best or most influential work is some of their earliest. I think St. Vincent's going to do great things, on top of the great things she's already done.
I found you from a bobs burger video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iTcQ6-z2rw
I love that orange reference to Trump at 0:12
I saw her perform this song on stage in an evening gown, and really didn't like it.  But this is very good.
Reminds me of this as well\nhttps://www.instagram.com/toiletpapermagazineofficial/?hl=en
that beat really reminds me of Nine Inch Nails The Great Destroyer
★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★  ★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★\n*Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven! He died and arose from the dead to give us eternal life.*
This song is excellent and it is friday night....haha.
That is no fair being that beautiful and talented too. I love everything Annie does, she is a rare talent. She could skate by on her beauty, but she is a hard working woman. She has totally earned everything she's got.
This album is going to be immense. Can't wait
Such a sexy song and video. Amazing stuff!
I like the fact I'm sponsoring Annie by drinking redbull, thats a good deal !!
I miss the era of St vincent’s “Marry Me”. I ve alwwys wanted the dark humor yet poignant side of her. Witty and just haunting . Same with “Landmines”. Plsss stvincent!
The A E S T H E T I C on the video makes it even better. So ready for Masseduction
3:14 makes me to imagen the perfect sweet & nasty fantasy.  Yeahhhh!!!
What Goldfrapp should be sounding like today.
1:29 is that who I think it is?! OAO
this sounds so much like The Kills, so good
If I were more of a lesbian Annie would totally dig me.  I saw her last year, killer
if trent reznor had been born xx instead of xy.
Did any notice the Brazil (movie) reference in the video or is it just me?
her normal person costume is great
St. Vincent's songs Also music videos are pure art !!!! 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
A E S T H E T I C
at the very end, meeting David Byrne did not help out
Man, she's really serving on the aesthetics this era
kind of a chanel advert from terry gilliams brazil
She’s gunna wreck us so hard with this album omg
I can’t wait annie to win like 20 Grammys for this album
in partnership with my blue balls
It would be an honour for St Vincent to step over my face in those heels
How do you describe this unique guitar sound??
Oh no she dit-ent! 🍣
Interesting!
HINOOOOOOOOOOOOO
nice
REAL GOOD!

Ugh Annie is too fabulous! 💋
3:04 Live giraffe birth
her videos get weirder
Sexy Woman Marry me
Slick. Sexy. Cool.
Just great👏👏👏👏
bae
I'm SHOOK
She can punch me in the face and I'd thank her.
A silly video, for a silly song, with a silly name (as it doesn't apply to what she is singing about). Besides, if she was going to sing about Los Angeles, she'd have to do better than this unnecessary artistic offering. (rejected).
Love this song, to bad it only has 300'00
Annie has lost her soul. I new it was going to happend because she chose to become a celebrity. Now she's just like any new pop star out the big money music factory. I hope she finds herself again.
She'll end up eating her own words with this one. 35 years old is a wonderful age....anyone care to bet at what age she'll succumb to Botox ?...facelift ?.....nip and tuck ?.... increase in popularity = increase in vanity.
Sarkistic talent with taste. Such a mess)) but I feel in love ... I'm going to masturbate ...
She seems more focused on cultivating the St Vincent persona than writing great music\n\nGreat chorus though
This is very unhappy music
she sold out
Good thing she's hot or she'd be waiting tables.   Love how they use irony to get away with the fact that she has to prostitute herself in rubber bikinis to get anyone to watch this shit.  - I guess she's empowering herself by acting like a whore.  Oh, and make sure to cash in on the lesbian trend.  Find out where the crowd is moving then run in front and pretend like your leading it.  -  Offensively mediocre pretentious garbage for lemmings and teenagers.
Is LaVar Ball the worst sports parent ever?
Does Nancy Armour not realize some of the greatest athletes grew up without a mom/dad? Wouldn't bum dads who ditch their kids count as worse parents than an overbearing father? I'd rather have had a involved, slightly overbearing dad instead of not having one at all.
How a female gonna tell a grown man how to parent their kids. Look where they at dumb bitch he doing something good
Hold up let me finish the thought = Molly stfu
lol he made his kids rich as teenagers
5:47 molly, what are you doing...
fire all this scrubs and bring inside stuff , fuck this stupid show
I don't care about Lavar Ball, don't care about his sons. I personally wouldn't like being raised the way he is raising his sons and I don't like the way he goes about marketing his sons, but he does give his children certain opportunities that other parents can't give in this country. Are there other ways as a parent to give your child great opportunity's in life, sure. But how many kids are blessed with parents like that? I just hope his sons are happy, getting a lambo and being on tv shows don't make a man instantly happy, we've seen that time and time again with celebrities.
I really hate how Molly always tries to interject and cuts off the people we actually tune in to see
Lavar one of the greatest sports parents ever! Stay in yo lane and check the facts..
Is Lamelo fine with this? bitch this a black family you don't decide shit at 16! nobody needs your opinion unless they ask you.. there is no you're disrespecting my privacy type of shit. Lavar can turn Mayweather into Shakespeare, let the man do his thing.
As soon as joy starts talking they cut the video lol
So is the middle one like still around or we still treat him like meg?
Why is Molly always interrupting. He’s talking and just noisey her stupid ass thought into the convo
He is the best sports parent and he is in control of his own household. You people think that you can take control of others people's household and run your mentality game on Levar Ball but Levar is too strong of a Man for you to deal with mentally physically and emotionally.  These are his kids! Run your own  house!\n\nYou people want to see this Black man fail. Levar made a wise choice!
I'm a goat
I just want LiAngelo to take the NCAA by storm so that the media remembers he exists.
like most they be broke by the end~
Everyone forgets about liangelo
Nigga looks like Michael Keegan
Lebron's dad is the worst sport parent
If anybody wants a front row seat into Lavar’s parenting skills, watch Ball in The Family on Facebook or YouTube. He’s not what the makes him out to be.
LOL.. OMG White People worried about the education of Black Men.. LMAO I have seen it all now.
MOLLY, SHUT THE F UP!
6:08 - this chick just ask is lamelo okay with this?\nbruh, Lavar is his dad. Melo doesn't have to be okay with it but his trash ass has to accept that that parents have the last say lol stay in yo lane.
Wish I wasn't white
Lavar Ball is the G.O.A.T when it comes to sports dads.
When will Molly learn to let people talk and not speak over them? She does it all the time and it drives me absolutely crazy.
A beautiful wife he's been with for over 30 years two sons who are committed to UCLA and that are top recruits in the nation one son in the NBA all three of them won a state championship together Lonzo got his own Brand Lavar started I really wouldn't call that a bad parent
One would really have to question why that hatchet job of an article was even written by USA today. It's clear to me that someone is trying to put a target on this man's back.
Idk how yall feel, but i really like will cain on this show lol almost like the skip of the modern era.
So how is lavar the worst sport parent ever when lebrons Dad and other athletes parents weren’t even there growing up?
They cant say it so i will fuk that reporter and their opinion...done
He's not a bad dad, just an ANNOYING person.  Those are two different things.\nLavar is a legit dad... I just wouldn't hang out with him personally, lol.
Nancy better stay in her lane
The worst sports parents are the ones that chose not to be in their kids’ lives
One of your kids is an NBA PLAYER and you called the team that picked him. This man is the 🐐 leave him alone
he is the best parent imo
Nobody gives a fuck about your input Molly. Just wear something skimpy and shut the fuck up.
There should be a drone shot of Molly front and rear while the guys talk
LaVar a fool 😂, but no he’s done a lot for his family since they were kids let’s take a look. One is in the NBA already, Another one about to play for UCLA, the last one gots his own signature shoe!
Jealousy is apparent here and I would like to see these pundits children so we can compare and contrast.  Lavar is black and that's the problem period, non of the other stuff...ESPN reaching...Even Liberal whites secretly hate black people and wish for their demise...In a world gone mad are we really judging Lavar for being an outspoken parent and involved....Even liberal whites still want black men to check in with white authority before making a decision. Black men are not allowed to think independently, that's the real problem
This chick molly can never get a word in 😂😂
Fuck lavar ball. He ruins the image of basketball. His annoying ass just wants publicity. He's an egomaniac.
fuck nancy a woman cant say shit about a father
Worst sports parents that keep saying his son will never be good or things like that.
Let’s see hmmmm ....\n\n#1 Married to the same woman\n#2 All kids by the same woman\n#3 One son in the NBA and is a multi millionaire \n#4 One son attending UCLA\n#5 One son rank #7 best high school basketball player in America \n#6. None of his sons have a mug shot.\n#7. Started his own shoe and merchandise company \n#8 MAJOR AMERICAN ARTICLE NAMES THIS MAN THE WORST SPORTS PARENT IN HISTORY\n\nThey said the same thing about Venus and Serena Williams' dad and Tiger Woods' dad.... Do you see a pattern❓🤔 \n\n***
She's spot on.
NANCY NEEDS TO STAY IN HER LANE
Is it just me.. when this will cain guy starts to speak. I immediately turn this crap off..
Why does will Cain have a job
I don’t even think he’s obnoxious. I just think he’s a professional troll and knows how to take advantage of the media with his antics.
Wow just don't talk about LiAngelo
This is such BS. The kid is being home schooled for his last two years of high school. SO FUCKING WHAT? there are so many kids home schooled especially famous kids who go to school and it becomes a distraction because they are so famous. Y’all act like he’s not fuckin rich and they can get the best tutors and so on. People so busy worried about the wrong thing when they kids ain’t shit.. BBB
Well, it's funny limited resources but make it is classic white folk tales as they are extremely strict in the South especially if your a QB but whatever. Lavar is a marketing genius period!
I don’t hear these people complaining about the 1000’s of kids pulled from school to work in Hollywood etc. the problem is LaVar is a minority who happens to be outspoken, conservative, opinionated etc. hypocrites
Fuck them I wish lavar ball was my pops
LeMelo doesn't have a high basketball IQ compared to his brother. I don't think he will make it in NBA in the future. He just chucks bad threes and is awful on defense... It's probably best for him to be home schooled though considering how famous he is now.
lavar can do what he wants, its HIS kids ffs. wat business is it of the liberal sports media?
3:16 When you tell your girl you're not cheating yet she got screenshots of your Dms....
She better stay in her lane.
Him being there for his children automatically disqualifies what the fuck she's saying. There's plenty of deadbeat niggas who don't even know their child's name.
Molly u dumb bitch stfu with nobody gives a shit bout ur stupid point
Lamello is a celebrity now. He can't be at a regular high school. It's that simple. Too many distractions
Why are they talking about someone who isn’t even in the nba yet 😂 calm down and talk about actual professional sports players in the nba or nfl
Molly please stay in yo lane... And I aint apologizing like Cam Newton!
Whats wrong with creating your own brand? Should he have some other company exploit his son...i say marketing at it's finest
Max's hair got it's color back.
Why would First Take give this article so much TV exposure? Lavar is a genius and he know the new coach is on some BS. When you tell my son you want be shooting 50 times, instead of saying we going to have more ball movement and assist a game.
Ban will cain from first take
BULLSHIT....Lavar is a great Father look at the results
Imagine LaMelo attending Chino Hills H.S... rolling up in his red Ferrari... music blaring... television camera distracting the other students from properly graphing a parabola in Algebra 2 class? Not to mention the envy and jealousy of the other boys as he (Melo) attends prom with 300 gold digging vixens... This could all lead to some serious issue ESPN and Sports Illustrated dim wits. Now, go THINK ABOUT IT!
Molly needs to shut the fuck up and stop trying to insert herself into the conversation. Nobody cares what she has to say
School really isn’t that important
Hmm lets go to ESPN for parenting advice... said no one ever.
the worse or perfect? I swear we can never win... If were unsuccessful its because we have no dad , we have a dad & now hes the worst...smh
Get off Lavar dick and let yo bitch get on it
“A lot of people would kill to have a father” -whatever the female hosts name is
i want to hear Kristine Leahy's comments on this. I havent heard anythign from her since she got put in her lane
Why Molly always feel like she has to yell her way in? 😂😂
Stephen A. Knows it all
I'm on that big baller shit forreal
LeBron James had no dad I would put his dad on that list Ball is fucking the game up and yt ppl are pissed
I'm pretty sure Julian Newman's father is a lot worse...
Worst sports parent ever? Sounds like a bunch of ignorant jealous people voted this.
Who the fuck is the washed up bitch who made that statement anyway. No one cares about her.
This probably coming from people who have no fathers
Russell Westbrook - I'll Be Champion Soon\nhttps://youtu.be/7HjB3xPjN60
Lavar Ball is the greatest sports parent
max you did say the end justify the means you said lets see how it shapes up
White people always want to tell black people how to raise their kids. Now if all his kids had criminal records, and no father around they would love to use these kids in prison.
God damn Molly!
Anddd race comes in.... Gj comments
lamelo is the next Westbrook
MJ is worst
LaVar is a genius!!! Greatness attracts Haters.
She's jealous
Haters gona hate.
Simply put, this writer trolled everyone...

I lost it at the Gemma Collins part. 😂
the way you edited the aquariam part made me feel like a mermaid
U should put poppy in every vlog xx
I really hope this doesn't come across as patronising because I really don't mean it to but can I just say how fucking amazing it is to see you out the flat so much recently and especially getting out to see friends. As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression I know how hard it is to even leave the house, I struggle to even take my daughter to nursery most days without feeling sick at the thought. I'm proud of you for even your little trips to the beach to read or sit and think. Hope your doing well babes, you really seem to be getting there with things and I know it doesn't mean you are but I hope you are. Love you loads xxxx
The Aquarium looked like a date 😉😆. Poppy is hot! Best wishes gabs x (im probs misreading shit but ah well)
Omg one time I literally pushed my laptop off the table because there was a spider on the screen
I feel like there is sexual tension between poppy and gabbs ahaha
Whenever I'm out buying things for my home, I always come back to your videos for inspiration! I love all your home styling 😍😍👌🏼👌🏼
I wanted to see Hobs :( sad times

한글 자막이 생겨서 깜짝놀랐어요! 너무 감사합니다!! 그동안 영어를 몰라서 그냥 영상만 보고 있었는데 이제 자막으로 무슨말을 하는지 다 알수있어서 진짜 너무 좋아요👍😍
am I the only one that pronounces manga like man-ga, instead of mun-ga
yeesssss Death note PLS PLS watch the anime its soooo good as well!!! me and my house mate just finished it and it was a ride! haha love ya xxx
Jenn, do you even know how popular and well known Death Note is? It’s like an anime and manga legend 😂😂😂
Lol you're giving me such flashbacks... we're the same age and a lot of my friends were into deathnote in high school so the nostalgia is hitting hard
Love you Jenn ❤️ you’re so caring 💕😘
Hi Jen!! I know this is super late but you should totally check out the Death Note anime as well, in Japanese, it’s really well done and stays true to the manga! & whatever you do don’t watch the Netflix adaptation because it will make you angry that it’s even called “Death Note” - completely different story. Also, I have your striped top and I love it!! ❤️❤️❤️ Anyway, love you!
BEN'S BURP MADE ME LAUGH ONE WHOLE MINUTE
Lol. A hit of nostalgia with deathnote. It's one of the classics that got me hooked on mangas and animes.
I'm so glad you are starting to read manga! You should check out Monster since you enjoyed Deathnote so much!
Wonderful video! I just posted a similar video and would love your feedback!!
Jenn, I swear we are brain twins. We think so alike that it's borderline creepy and I mean that nicely lol.
im alone at home and my active imagination.. T^T
Where can i get a personal name plate necklace like yours?
What’s happen? I can see translated Japanese 👀
Jenn unnie your make up look is so pretty! And omg there are so so many captions available in different languages 😂 I've never seen this much tho
Yeeeeahh Death Note! You should watch the anime too, it's so good...
My twin and I have been watching your videos and we have really been enjoying them! We also post videos on our channel every week! We have really been struggling with the views so it would really mean A LOT if you checked them out! 😘😘
Love the headband!! Where is it from?
Death Note is one of my favourite anime! 😊
If you like the Death Note manga, you will love the anime. Literally one of the best animes out there, Jenn ! :D
I wish you had extended sizes for your clothing line :(
I’ve been into death note ever since I was in 7th grade back in 2007 I believe. Still love that anime til this day & Im glad you are digging it! You definitely should watch the anime but don’t bother watching the American live action of it on Netflix! Lol also love the eyeshadow color combo 😍 so cute!
I also love death note but I haven't had the chance to read the manga. I have watched the anime series and all of the movies even the netflix version (but I really don't recommend it haha) it's also fun to see a story that comes into life when watching it on film but I know reading the book is also a great exercise for the imagination <3 \n\nP.S. I have been wanting to watch IT but I am afraid of clowns but I think the by way you describe it I can handle IT as well! makes me want to watch it now haha wish me luck!
That burp at the end though lmao. Also i cant tell, but do you have red under your black nail polish? cause that is SO CUTE!
YouTube should pay for video transcription. Work like that should not be done for free by clueless teenagers who don't know they should earn money for their work.
There are so many Chinese people translated your video, we love you so much!😘
thanks to you I read Ready Player One !! it was such a great book ! can't wait to read your other recommendations !!
Girl ... go ahead and dive into the manga world, you'll love it !!
But does anyone really need to summarise death note
Tutorial on this look please!!!❤️❤️❤️
when she said butthole lips i had war flashbacks to every time safiya nygaard had said that in her videos
Jenn if they get to make a solution for the international shipping is there anyway we can separate the pieces we want, because i really want the fuzzy tee and with the cost of the shipping is imposible for me to get it
PLEASE DO A TUTORIAL FOR THIS MAKEUP LOOK！！！！！！！！
Death note is on Netflix!!
YAY YOU HAVE A DEATH NOTE MANGA. IM SO HAPPY. AND I LOVE YOU AND YOUR VIDEOS. HOPE YOU’RE ENJOYING DEATH NOTE. sorry I typed in all caps I got excited 😅
IM THE SAME WITH HORROR! I'm glad I'm not alone TT_TT. I'm still traumatised from horror.
I really love the way you put subtitle in each of video. English is not my mother language so I watch your video every single day to improve my English skills. Love you so much :***
I love that I can relate to you. For horror movies, I have an active imagination as well. If I see or read anything scary, I remember it forever. In addition, I LOVE LOVE LOVE subtitles as well 😂
The 'extra' at the end of this video though! LOL
Hey Jen! I was wondering if you could try to do your favorite nail styles! like just a video about what kind of nails matches specific oufits, preferred shape, colors, designs, etc! thank you!!
Hey Jenn😊 \nMay i know where can i buy your necklace, it looks gorgeous!!!
your eye makeup is beautiful !
THAT BURP. OMG haha it took me by surprise :P
Please do a tutorial for your eye makeup!!! IT'S AMAZING ❤❤❤
Your makeup is popping! I always love listening to you describe books or movies :)
Jenn! I really would like to transcribe your videos<3 Since I've got lots of things from you, I'd want to give you something back!! I tried to transcribe the last video you attached, but I couldn't find the 'add more language' button, why??
I really cannot wait you to read the entire Death Note!!! And watch anime ver and talk passionately about the finale of each ver ;)
did no one notice the burp at the ending?? lmao
Wild is also a movie starring Reese Witherspoon. One of my favorite adaptations. You should check it out!
I swear by Death Note! One of the best manga ever!!!! Your bro got good taste!!\nI love the movie and series too but as they extended it, I didn't watch it anymore.. usually sequels disappoint me but I might watch one day..
Cheryl Strayed (author of Wild ) has a podcast called Dear Sugar that I think you'd enjoy! Her and her cohost's voices are so soothing and I love listening to it when I'm getting ready
PLEASE do a makeup tutorial for this look!! Amazing!
Your eye makeup is always popping' love it Jenn! <3 Can you do a tutorial on this eye look? :)
Whoaaa, super happy that you've got a chance to read Death Note. It's a bit scary how a high-schoolar decide to kill people very easily, but I read it just because I like the unusual story-line. It's very old manga though, I read it like 8 years ago.
I've never commented a video, but I love your eyeshadow soooooo much ! \nLove from France, C. \n(Sorry for the bad English)
Watch the movie for Wild!!! So good
Hey Jenn! My fav right now is the Laura M. Tinted Moisturizer. The coverage is great and lightweight while I've been living in Spain! Also the app Blink gives great daily bits from self help books. Def look into it I think you'd love it.
If you're interested, Wild was adapted into a movie of the same name with Reese Witherspoon playing Cheryl, that's my favorite movie, you should watch it !!!!!
Omg whats with that last part?! The burping whilst having the dior lipstick up 😐
Hi Jenn!💎 I just submitted my Japanese translation of your confidence video for review 🇯🇵😀 That video is one of my favourites and you've been such an inspiration to me ever since I discovered your channel, so I wanted to give something back 💞 I hope more Japanese viewers discover your channel!!!
Jen... both death note and wild had a movie. U should check it out🤓
Jenn! Do you wear contacts? Your eyes are especially alluring in this video *.*
love this eye makeup so much!!!!!!
I've always heard really good reviews about DeathNote, but have yet to read it. Now I am VERY tempted. Also, your entire look today is so cute! Love it.
Ooooh Death Note! You should watch the Death Note movie! I'm not one for horror movies either but my friend dragged me to the theatre when it came out and it was actually not as scary.
Makeup tutorial please! 😍 love you! You're so beautiful!
There are a bunch of anime and manga with interesting storylines. Let's just say you'll hardly get bored of it and there are bunch of genres you can dip into.
Thanks for the book recommendation!
Can any body tell me how can I translate it and add the subtitle on?
You look so pretty. Your eye makeup is on point girl! And you are so damn hard working. How can you post so many videos in such a short time. I couldn't catch up with em all with my new college schedule. But I can never afford to miss your favorites video, can I? Love you sista!! Keep rocking!!
sooo weird, I just finished watching death note! loved it ofc! 💕 ily2 Jenn :)
I came here for the pretty face....I hate myself.
Love that little blooper at the end 😂

한글 자막❤❤❤❤
What song is he singing?
And then Jason Aldean went on SNL to cover Tom Petty's ripp of MY tune, WON'T BACK DOWN.  Hell NO, correct?\n\nWRONG TUNE, WRONG TIME, WRONG STAGE, Jason Aldean. \n\nSo you back the hell down and off that stinking stage, since you moved attacks back down off Ramadan, month 9 of hijrah, to ANY OLD TIME YOU KAFIR ASK FOR IT.\n\nTurns out, local CSGs tried a big load of rundowns at ME, Sept.26-27, over two days.\n\nSince I am where the current fatwa media is ignored, for two years, while you jerk around and ignore thousands of my posts, e-mails, and attempts, to report any of this, TO YOU OR ANY SHITTY, CATHOLIC PIGS, you go get that Pope of Rome, and LET'S TALK, PIGS INTO GAMBLING, without my dice.\n\nYou and SNL should take your moves like Jagger out for some air.\n\nDon't forget to breathe.
ANYONE NOTICE THEY SHUT ALL LIGHTS OF THEN TURNED ON THE BIG SPIT LIGHTS? Now they all are sitting ducks in a big pond!
they don't call it SIN CITY for nuthin
Why were the stage lights were turned off and then the flood lights came on, illuminating the audience.?
Jason,your fans deserved a heads up that something wasnt right.
Funny how the people that love guns arguing about the second amendment until they are shot with one.,ban all guns, mr daturday night special aint good for no one.
This is Pitiful ,sickening,Devasting an senseless.But i bwt anything this guy is a fall guy just like Lee Harvey Oswald was for JFK.. we cannot trust our government nor the FBI they are doing everything to depopulate our country through our Foods chemtrails cell phone towers..our water etc.. this world is no longer even fit to live in. My heart aches for these families and these people who experience this life changing ordeal. Life will never be the same for them.. my thoughts and prayers are for all of you.
Aldean runs off stage not warning people then goes on SNL and acts like he is some kind of hero. Sad!
Don't watch EVIL or glorify it's actions or magnify it's message \nhttps://youtu.be/y6SS6f3upHs
Would have been nice if Jason had at least hollered run
Continued Prayers for all effected by this horrible tradgedy 😓. And all the families and friends of those who lost their lives.
Nothing happened, youre full of shit just trying to make money on a hoaxed spectacle!
Disgusted that he just ran off! Didn't even have the decency to warn his fans
Turning those lights on didn't help no one.
What song was he singing
THIS IS NOT A GUN CONTROL ISSUE... GOOD PEOPLE WITH GUNS DON'T DO THINGS LIKE THIS.. ONLY EVIL PEOPLE DO! THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A BAD PERSON WITH A GUN IS A GOOD PERSON WITH A GUN.
Is it just me or does it seem since the terror attacks of September 11th that attacks have grown at a fast pace?\n\nEither way, we can't deny the fact that evil is in the jetstream and can land anywhere at anytime.
This world is becoming such a scary place to live in its disgusting. I hope whoever did this rots in hell, hoping everyone has a speedy recovery❤️ and rest in peace to all those innocent victims out there❤️ fly high
It was probably too loud.
Im repeating this because I didn't even get one reply.How could this Jason dude ever face anyone after deserting his fans in the way he did. He did not even say ONE WORD let me repeat myself not even ONE WORD to the bewildered crowd.How could he leave his fans for dead?How many paid good money to come and see him and look what they got in return.His fans needed him to say at least something,but got nothing.SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!
Everyone complaining about the performer running off stage, is he not allowed to protect himself? Shots were going off like crazy and he's in the damn spotlight! Was be supposed to stand there in order to warn fans about something he has absolutely no clue about or what was going on and pretty much ask to die in the process???\nWas he supposed to somehow save thousands of people from something he had no fucking control over?
This is the scariest thing I have ever heard, the concert goers are going to have severe trauma even if they were not physically injured.
Make the laws exactly like singapores and no crime eill happen ! Praying for victims and the families
Isn't this dude the shooter of the columbine school?  Woah, he looks so old now
The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” MLK \nJason “Bolt” Aldena wiithout so much as a word to the ~22,K fans standing there not knowing what is going on and being shot down. He had loudspeakers and the attention of the concertgoers, he could have and should have crew to kill the lights, we need first responders, stay calm and move to the exits, take cover, say something - say anything. He said nothing and ran. \n58 perished, 489 people injured. Prayers to the families who've lost loved ones'.
Every shot you hear is a life changed forever. Sickening to watch.
This video shows nothing, you can hear.
I can't help but wonder how much of a difference it would have made in the shooters' ability to aim at and hit the crowd if the stage lights were not shining upon the crowd during the second volley of fire. \n\nIn this video (https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c96_1507108754), they finally turned the lights off - several minutes after the shooting stopped. As the guy filming the video states, that just made it more difficult for the EMTs to find and help the wounded.
One thing I noticed right away when the videos started popping up.  Why did they decide to illuminate the entire crowd with the floodlights making them easier targets as the shooting started.  The crowd was pretty dark until that point.
Our world is so messed up
makes me not want to go to concerts.
What is so unsettling is this\n     These homeland attacks are going to keep happening. The media, certain politicians, and a select few branches of government are responsible for the poisoning of our minds, and the taking of our financial security are just two of the things that are pivitol in the breakdown of the shooters state of mental health. I am NOT WARRANTING what happened, however unless ALL OF US don't stop being hateful , and getting involved on a municipal level attacks like this are going to keep happening. To me this was just a small version of 9-11. ALL SECURITY MEASURES ON A PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL SHOULD BE TREATED AS IF THE PRESIDENT IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. ANY PLACE WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PRESENT , THERE SHOULD BE A PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL OF SECURITY..... IN 2004 when Dimebag Darrell Abbott was killed on stage in Columbus, Ohio during a concert should have prevented any security fails such as this
What a sick world we live in.😞

JASON IS A BITCH FOR THE COMPANY!!!!
Im glad i live in a gun-controlled country... Its so safe and peaceful here..
Very sad and unfortunate but I can't say I'm surprised about a culture, people, and society that worship guns and violence. There are probably hundreds of thousands of normal white guys just like him out there lurking. How many white guys named Joe Schmoo are in America? Yeah. Millions. How many of them have guns? Millions. Apparently he wasn't even one of the assholes. Suck on that for awhile. What did you expect? This is 'Merica. How ironic that it happened in SIN CITY as well. The sad reality is that the chickens came home to roost. This is the new normal. Get used to it or move to the middle of nowhere and live in a cave somewhere.
This is absolutely disgusting what happened, now if he was a Muslim the first thing would have been ‘terrorist’ but this guy is a ‘lonewolf’ and ‘disturbed’.
What song is that
So they turn on the floodlights so the shooters can see who to shoot! Wake up people ! there are three or more shooters!
Why would anyone like this video
Hey Guys! This Is Great! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 ℕ𝔼𝕋𝔽𝕃𝕀𝕏 $𝟝𝟘𝟘 𝔾𝕚𝕗𝕥 ℂ𝕒𝕣𝕕 Here – >  #Likefreecardsgetitnow
Johhny Cash on stage:  Shoot at me Devil! I'm the man in Black!
Not a terorist eh? I wonder why ?
Call it for what it is Terrorism
He runs off stage like a little bitch! He doesn't even warn the crowd! THEN they turn all the lights on the auduence! What? So the killerS can see their targets? WTF???????
I think Islam is behind this.
The sad thing is I didn't even feel shocked hearing the gunfire.
I hope that guy suffers for all eternity, to take a life is to sin.. to take that many lives.. fucking coward
This is what World War Three looks like.
Hmmm Are we already in Hell?
Time just ended a video of a mass shooting telling me to sub? Holy shit
Hotel high rises should have airport security type baggage scanners to screen whatever bags get taken upstairs and make people secure any firearms in the hotel arms room while they're guests especially in casinos where somebody might get a bit upset losing their money gambling.  That's the only thing I can see that could have possibly stopped this from happening.
Cant blame him for not stopping immediately, lot of people thought it was fireworks at first...
That ain't no Goddamn 'bump fire'. That is belt fed Army shit.
Im kind of mad at how the country singer on stage runs off to seek shelter like a scared child. Leaving fans thinking WTF. Just my opinion if anybody feels the same speak out.
This makes me want to cry I’m sad and devastated
It was at the Mandalay hotel not Whiskey
The gunshots sound remind me of the Paris nightclub.  You can hear the terror in the victims voices.
Nanny nanny boo boo!!!
*EVERYONE* who always shooting up places full of innocent people & have commited the biggest massacre in American History? \nA) Muslims\nB) Mexicans\nC) Blacks \nD) Whites\n*No.2 Pencil Only*
if live bullets after 1 min stampede. Crisis actors again.
HEY TIME !! YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT -- RIGHT ?? THE VIDEO OF THE 2ND SHOOTER ON THE 4TH FLOOR -- AS CONFIRMED BY THE LVPD DISPATCHER. DON'T EVEN TRY IT -- OK ??
How did you get 2000 ppl to like this when there's nothing here?
This is not part of the show.  People, seek shelter.  KILL the lights.   How long does it take to say that?
This is such bullshit
NOTICED!! His last words of the song was no show  and he ran off after stage.  #illuminati 🎰🏟🏰🎆🌃📺💵🔨🚷

Fucking scumbag
He was lip syncing
PLanned event such BS
God bless you
whats the name of the song
So fucking disgusting . These days people can't even go to concerts with their family. They went there for fun and then they get killed , That's so sickening
what song is this?
I don't know much about weaponry, but does that sound like a paintball gun?!
What was the song Jason started to sing ?
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for ya?
Body armor is gonna gonna be the new fashion
How could you even play his music now? You saw how his  beta ass ran off stage. I'll smack the shit outta him if I ever saw  that chicken Shit bastard
Hotel all over the world need medal detector so people cant bring gun in to a hotel. And we need tuffer gun laws.
Jason Aldean is a coward, knew what was going to happen and bolted. \n\nEnjoy the media and government lying to you. It was the fbi+cia+mossad that did this. Prepare to be subjugated by the jew world order.
what is the name of the song he was performing when the shooting began?
I've wanted this for so long and now it's just fueled my hunger and I only want more
how Blade Runner esk the music is.
What!!!!!????? It ends like that......but.....but...Tell next time Oats
wow so many questions answered from the first one but so many created in this one good stuff
So you are saying i can make this with unity!?!
Anyone else think that the black robot sounds like Hunhow?
This is why Hollywood has cancer, reboots!!!
Why isn’t this shit a full length film in a cinema
Hmm he said one felony conviction saves the lives of 10 citizens, only your brain is of no use I'm assuming there on some kind of food shortage and your body is harvested?! I must know what messed up stuff is happening in the Consortium!!
It's so good!
You guys need to make either a video game or a movie like holy fuck
PLEASE SOME BILLIONAIRE FUND THIS GUY!
Good job kojima i hope theres a new cooking with bill soon
I want a movie now
How did they record this
everything was good until that cliche female robot.
Would be a sick game
Lol let UE fanboys say Unity sucks and it's graphics are shit after watching this XD
ok, oats studios ......... you can not continue doing this to us...... you can not keep doing unbeliable good material like this and leaving it like that . we demand a long film... or better, a long series of something.
Why did i heard chinese
jesus,  please make a video game
Make this a game. Fucking come onnnnnnnnn. It's a masterpiece waiting to be realized
I will be very angry if you do not finish this. I honestly don't understand. No blockbuster movie has been able to hold my attention as much as this animation has. It's been such a long time since I felt intrigued by this kind of shit. Please keep going with this, you have created something amazing here.
I've always wanted this to continue
This would be an amazing video game.
For Gods shake publish the next episode quick!!!
is this a moive game or short moive
Finnaly it took a long while to get a new chapter it was totaly worthy of my frustration :3
Neil bloomkamp how did I fucking know, is this a game or a movie?? I need more
Has a lot of social-political parallels to China and the harvesting program of criminals.\nConsortium = China, the robot terrorist = Falun Gong; 1 conviction 10 citizens saved = organs harvested, brain useless\nThe Mirror states the crime - felony treason, terrorism, crimes against the Consortium, political dissident\nsound familiar?\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong\nReason why they may keep them alive is probably from human rights activists protesting of inhumane practices.\nSo they give them a chance to live w/ a wiped mind outside the consortium to start all over or die (exiled or becoming refugees of the wasteland)
It's all good but banding on this video is crazy
Ow my god they did a part 2.
Somebody call Sony distribution and get this fucking made!
would love to see this made into a game
Impressive work guys, keep it coming!
same fire in the background used twice
Is this going to be a game or a movie?
Wait, so THESE guys made the trailer for Unity 5!?
i need a game... ASAP
Please make it a movie
This is GOOD -- thank YOU.
Yo Im here again buuuuut when is some billionaire going to give this company a shit load of money to make an actual movie. Not this strip tease crap (I really love these too tho)
Cannot make these fast enough!
No way, it's been years
This is priceless!!! I want a movie!!! This could be a jump in time from chappie a sequel... The quality is wonderful!!! I love everything... The eyes of the mirror... Woooowwww....sick!!! Plz... Make more!!! Moooorrreeeee!!!! MORE!!!!
That was the most enjoyable blue balls I've ever experinced.
3:03 He sounded like Jigsaw.  I thought this is Toby in afterlife.
Can this please become a series! This looks amazing!
I know that the protagonists name is probably supposed to be Adam,but be cause of obvious reasons in my mind i call him Crack Head
I just hope I don't have to wait another year for the next clip
Woah, I remember watching that tech demo for the new unity engine with these characters in it.  So cool that Oats is taking it further.
So basically, instead of killing criminals, wich i assume is not allowed, they transfer their minds yo machines and then let them die, cause, they are , you know machines, and the bodies are used as a organ bank, but why go tru all that shit, why not kill them ..
I saw a preview for this on a unity advertisement
So what? This isn’t going to be a movie or a game, form now on ADAM will be a series of animated short films?
This one is amazing, guys make me a game or a film out of this, I would go see it on theaters no doubt. Such an interesting world.
That is art at one of its finest forms. Bravo. Can't wait to see what more Oats has in store with this...
a short experimental film - https://youtu.be/7XykvpPPUPU
MOVIE NOW I WANT IT. *GASP* u know what woudl be better than a movie A GAME
It's directed by Neill Blomkamp!
He is not letting my dog breathe please help the guy with gods magic
I want humans and more bots please make this a movie or even video game
I could so watch a full film of this. It's interesting and visually stunning
It's not my place to tell you what to do but can you please make longer videos like the Zygote episode
This is one of those moments i didn't think they would continue the story from the first one, which mind you I wanted SO much more after seeing it and it looks like we are getting just that.\n\nThank you Oat Studio and keep up the amazing work.
Thank you for this. When I first saw the original Adams chapter, I was wowed by the artistic direction, environmental design, premise and above all the animation and all the little details to bring it to life. I look forward to see the next chapter in his story and see where the journey takes us! :D
theres a video before this right? where can I find this because I had next to no idea what was going on here...
Watched the first chapter year ago, it was awesome\nman it would be great if it became a full movie or a game\n\nedit: The next chapter arrives soon. fuck Im loving this, subscribed!

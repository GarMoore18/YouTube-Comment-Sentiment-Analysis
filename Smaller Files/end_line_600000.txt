ohh and it has aliens again im so gonna watch this even though ill have nightmares
Been waiting 4 this for a long time...
The show has become so absurd and dreadful in a 'mad scientist slowly losing his mind' sort of way.
Looks like Krycek is the only person that's not returning from the dead this season.
where is the noire? :c
Oh no it looks bad
this season will be showed on tv in 1 year 1 is the first number number contains 6 letters 6 - 1 is 5. 5 + 5 is 10. 10 team 10 jake paul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx files jake paul confiermeeeeeeeeeuuued
There is a god above...
omg the trailer is on fleeeeeeekkkkkkk can't wait for season 11!!!!!!!
Is this real??? I hope so.
I only watched the first couple of seasons. I liked it more when each show was more of a one off.
Scully ages like a fine wine! What is she eating or drinking?? Lol
First off didn't the Morley man get blown the fuck up in a cave after being shown with a tracheotomy? Second off please no more honky tonk budonkadonk, ever.
PHEW .... can breathe again there is another series ..... thank you!
WTF
1:54 Statue of Morty's?

Didn't all the Lone Gunmen die? Well I guess so did the CSM so anything is possible. I'm super stoked.

Hopefully they run into Fringe Division.
People of earth and this must be connected.
Now just make season four of millennium
Every time someone says Agent Einstein' it sounds like sarcasm. Hope this season is better.
and rain pours down in vancouver, ha ha ha
Scully dies at the end of this season

I don't like this, Skinner meeting with CSM.
The trailer looks amazing! So looking forward to season 11!
I would give it an extra thumb up for using a cover of Zombie in the background, that song was definitely in my 90’s soundtrack, I would sing it over and over again back then. Also... do they want to tell us something with that song? It’s all in their heads?
No more of those younger agents PLEASE! They were annoying and charismaless af.
Awe man! It's on! Can't wait
I loved that they brought the series back but it's almost it's own parody with some episodes. It's not dark like it was in the past. The fish man episode with the fake sex scene with Agent Scully really turned me off too last season. I mean when have they ever done anything like that with her character???
They all look great! Wow
That theme song never gets old.
makes me wanna take a knee
the rabbit hole just got a lot deeper than expected
Don't these two people hate each other in real life?
The X-Files, guaranteed to have more facts than fox news.
I love everything I just saw....everything...even the fact that they showed the same cut of Mulder looking around a corner twice to fill out the trailer.....
Finally more x-files.. the wait was to long..
I’m the only one who’s watching this over and over again?
What cover of Zombie is that in the trailer? Should be a federal law to provide that lmao.
*HOLY SHIT THAT INTRO SENDS CHILL DOWN MY SPINE*
If Mulder and Scully were real people they would have gone insane by now from everything they've experienced in The X files but there not real people so who care's, they almost die in nearly every episode but they carry on 'Where are we going too this week Mulder?'
Love how both of you took a knee to support the NFL protest... JK you're dead to me now I destroyed my XFiles DVDs. I loved that show but seeing you two sell out like that.
0:47 stop right there I'm in \nI need friends
Uh huh, taking a knee, too, I almost don't want to watch. They don't realize how incredibly lucky they are to live in a country where you can get as stinking rich as these two, oh wait, she doesn't live here. Fuck off Anderson. Stick to movies. Besides, is she taking a knee against all the terror in Londonistan? I didn't think so.

Cigarette Smoking man turns out to be an alien in disguise who's been observing human activity!
Da truf is out der
I've been watching the original X-FILES SINCE 1993-2002. AND in the recent episodes over a year ago. I always loved the X-FILES. This new series should be awesome.

F Yeah!!!
I am so exited!!!
Trust no one
Too bad the actors knelt in support of athletes who publicly disrespected the Flag.    If I boycott the NFL for spitting on the graves and sacrifices of our service members, then I boycott a show that I have watched since day one.  Too bad, it literally was one of my favorite shows.  Since day one.  If you want to protest, do not do it supporting the desecration of our Flag and Anthem, especially when it is based on lies and you are protesting the wrong people.
Aliens are demons, outer space is fake and .......\nThe Earth is _______FLAT!_________
Does someone know the song? Or is it a new cover for the trailer?
How much was the fabric? p.s love your channel <3
I like your DIY better than the original tbh
LMAO What in the heck is up with asking?? how much coffee did she drink? Amber didn't drink no damn coffee she's just a fun person that is not boring she's always excited and thats a good thing (Coffee is a Shitty hot drink) that has caffeine in it that keeps you wide awake and you can die from it because you drinking too much it's not Soda or Pepsi caffeine is like a drug in your drink you drink that all the time you'll never get any sleep you'll be high as a kite and you'll start to have body failure meaning your body will start shaking on its own people it's not a joke thing with Coffee=caffeine your killing your self slowly.
Please please please don't change
How is your teeth so white?? I need to know! LOL
Wowwwy😍
I want those eyelashes 😍
OMGGGGGG I love the Red💄💄💄💄you look so beautiful😍😍\nI can't wait to have enough money to go to California so I can go to all the stores you go to for your DIY's😇😇I have faith I'll make it to Cali and when I do (in my head) we will shop for only the best sales and 💍💎💎💎😂😂

It's so cute how she is still saying broke bitch even though she is at 1mil
Hey Amber u like gloves too?? I love ur outfits and shoes 😍😍😍😍😍
I just want start by saying thank you Amber ❤️ Because of you I finally got the courage to start my very own YouTube channel! Honestly if it wasn’t for me coming across your channel and spending hours watching your videos, I don’t think I would’ve ever started my channel (which was only about two weeks ago!!) You are just so genuine to your followers and I love you for that! 💕 So keep doing you boo and keep up the amazing work! 💋
You don't pronounce the T in saint laurent...
Can you do Ariana Grande? <3 Love you! <3
Why does she have eyebrows on her lash line?
You should do something with the lashes. They don't look that pretty
I could be Bill Gates rich, and still wouldn't spend 10K on some boots.  DIY boots looked good.
I thought you were pregnant I’m confused I just started watching you
I hit the like button because i love you. The boots could've came out a little better,,, but you are my favorite still.
Are you ready for carli's launch!! Her shinny booties were made for you !! 😍✨

Can you do a shopping challenge at Walmart or target?
I luv rihanna and amber at the same time and when I saw this video I clicked so fast the end tho
Amber any ideas on how to bling up some old Uggs?
Amber can you please make a video on how you fixed and made those shorts that was to small to  fit you :)
a website called fashion nova has some like rihannas for $150
Omg Amber you should start your own clothing line ❤
Lady you did a amazing job on these boots WOW 😳. Tfs
do swatches and tests of your mauve lip liner
I bought exact glue because of your videos and I found it to be the most horrible I’ve ever used😫 I don’t get it
I just found your channel, safe to say you're my favorite YouTuber now
I just love you 😩😩😩😩
YES girl! Love this. So sweet so cool
We need a full story
I love your vids Amber and have been watching them for a long time but this wasn't your best tbh. Felt really rushed and the result wasn't that great. ;_; sorry
I wonder what Amber wore to prom and homecoming
Regular Human : *Gets cold at home - put on  warm fuzzy robe* ; Fabulous Amber *Gets cold at home - puts on fabulous blue fur coat* 😍😍😍😍 I'm cry 😭😭😭
The one you have look cute then riri's
Amber, I had A HORRIBLE day today, I literally hit a few lows today, but I have to say your video was one of the few things to make me genuinely laugh and smile throughout the day. Thank you for being you <3 I hope we cross paths one day xx from NYC :)
Your thumbnail (on my iPad), your price is covered with the length time of the video
Amber. How. Do. You. Do. It!
I seriously think you can make  a successful comedy actress or an animation artist.lol
you always have the best video ideas!!!
Please do the iconic Marilyn Monroe JFK dress.
Amber I wanna know where you got that black jacket😩
IM WATCHING THIS ON MY BIRTHDAY
Where is her black jacket from?
Very creative and very artistic. Wow you are really amazing! Keep it up! ❤🙏🏼😘
amber you are awesome, but those boots are not.....
PLEASE THE WHITE CORSET YOU HAVE ON IN THE OOTD WHATS IT CALLED ON THE WEBSITE I CANT FIND IT
She reminds me of a cartoon character
I have to set priorities.. So I closed my textbooks and watched Amber Scholl :P
Omg your so pretty and I love you're style and positive videos💖
They came out beautiful 😍✨✨
I’d rather fuck your brains out fuck Rihanna
Oh my goodnessss, you are perfect! If I could look half as good as you in all your outfits I do not have a clue what I'd do 😆 you just slayyyy 😩😻I love youuuu💖
So we just going to ignore the fact that we can see amber only wearing a bra & underwear through the mirror @ the background when she was showing us how the boots came out 😂😂  5:00-5:08
Windsor (a clothing line online) has a pair of shoes that are literally the exact same shoes Rihanna is wearing. They are $145 but still they’re cute
how does anyone give this video a thumbs down. she is such a ball of joy... common people, hating much
it looks prety than rihanna's shoes

Your eyelashes! 😻😻😻

Yes Amber is trending
Omg ur on trending
SLAY BITCH SLAY!!!!! 😍😍😍
I'm sad that I need to ask this, does every character need to be gay?
Props to Kate for not melting into a puddle
It seemed like Aidy broke character when Gal said tits. Maybe she wasn’t supposed to say that?
Why does there always have to be homosexuality in every damn movie, show, music video, and every god damn place else?

Kate probably did a happy dance as soon as she left the studio XD
Leslie... mmmmmmph let me have you in that outfit 😏😚
This makes my lesbian heart so happy
It's like we're in a porn...but the plumber is genuinely there to fix the pipes LMFAO!! I love Katy Bryant.
What The Fouk

Stupid
Hahahaha
I fucking love Gal
It's even funnier when you know the island of Lesbos is where the word Lesbian came from, because of the lesbian female poet Sappho. 😊
That was freaking hilarious..Gal was such a good sport. She looks like she is a fantastic kisser. Great actress and all around beautiful person. How can anyone not love her?
I can’t take my eyes off of aidy bryant’s reactions during the kiss scene. Priceless!!!
Omg! Last week was Ryan Gosling's ass and this week Gal Gadots kissing 😍✨✨✨Kate, You're living the dream girl 😳🙌🏼😅😅✨
This is porn action
Gal?? Her parents put a lot of thought into that one.
this was hot garbage. i clicked on this because of the number of views thinking i was finally going to see a good SNL skit and didn't laugh once, didn't get excited about the kiss, nothing. this shit is hot garbage. one of the best I've seen is this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG0wQRsXLi4
This is funny? How exactly?
THE KISS WAS SO CUTE
Well… I can’t say I’m not jealous…
I may have watched this 32 times
oh great! now i'm gonna have to replay this video and masturbate!!
Double thumbs down and goodbye me watching Wonder Woman or Justice League.
Is Gal really that tall?  Or is Kate really, really short?
Exactly, normal people don’t want any mentally ill faggots looking at the knowing the sick bastards would fuck you if they had the chance 🖕🏻🖕🏻
Women trying to be funny is not funny
How I'd wish to get a kiss from Kate...
I just came to laugh at the comments of triggered snowflakes.
damn im so jealous of Gal, she got to kiss Kate!!!
This shit was as funny as Saving Private Ryan...\n\nSorry, Saving Private Ryan was funnier.
This is such a realistic sketch its funny as hell
Dikes and Jew whores kissing!? SNL is going down hill
It would be funnier if the first guys to arrive were your typical 30 year old gamers who sit in their basement all day and play wow or dnd.
Man, I was grossed out through the whole thing. I guess this means I'm not gay!
Fan girls be like...
That kiss was longer than Gal Gadot's career to this point.
Fat Joe new hot smash single So Excited check it out https://youtu.be/AvmOC-SwnhU
Meh 😕 lame content
The comments on this are wild. Anyway perfect sketch, amazing show, hilarious women. Love it ❤
Did you guys find that they said their name wrong?  They all claim herself Megan, the other is Dre.
That kiss was hot 🔥🔥🔥
I just ... ... ... anyone who has seen me watch WW or the mew GB knows the inhuman noises I made ... which were really loud.
Notice this act did not come before her Wonder Woman movie. This is because they needed to have her idolized by young girls. Then they make their move with their agenda. Mothers and Fathers protect your sons and daughters. Do not support Gal Gadot or this flagrant propaganda against your children.
This isn’t crazy....THIS IS LESBOS!- Mr’s garrison.
YES!!!!!! I CAN NOW REST IN PEACE.
WONDER WOMAN IS BISEXUAL THOUGH
I relate to Kate on a spiritual level here..
Finally some action!
Gal Gadot is so damn stunning
Daaamn that kiss.... :O
Why is a kiss always their punchline lately?
that was hot
gal gadot really is beautiful id kiss her!!
I'd rather have Chris Pine #Hello
LMAO THIS IS EVERYTHING IVE EVER WANTED FROM SNL\nseriously, i love kate and she was so hilarious in this, i was dying when she kept saying alright. god, seeing kate and gal kiss was an experience :) to snl, all of us wlw thank you lol
You know that Kate was so fucking turned on
ok but why does gal seem to be looking offstage the entire time
I would frickin cry if Gal Gadot kissed me 😂
Gal gadot is the only person ive EVER seen in snl just blatantly stare at the teleprompter....i mean shit atleast TRY to make it subtle
... I felt something watching... Just saying.
As a male this did not give me a boner but My room did get hot. Perfectly normal
This is basically tumblr
Best day of Kate's life, no doubt.
I hate American humour
they aired THIS and cut the last fry song? are you kidding me?
thisis my proudest fap
Damn I wish I were Kate McKinnon.
DAMN GAL!
Oh, Kate..You lucky, lucky gal.
Water water everywhere 😂
Kate da man!
Gal Gadot! So hott
It's wrong to be gay.
wooooooooooooooooooooooooow
promise industrial similarly me frozen necessary abandon.
holy shit gal gadot looks like a phenominal kisser omfg
MADtv
Really? Ridiculous
Man, Gal Gadot just tasted fish.
SNL sucks now
Kate McKinnon fanfic come true.
We need more of this breaking down heteronormativity
LMFAO conservatives rubbing their man junk all over the place 24/7 and their porn and sexual desires and preach not being offended but this is gross LOLOLLLLLLLLLLLLL
That was so terrible I wish I could take my view back.
If Diana ain't a bit gay, how does she kiss so well? 🤔🤔
Im grateful for the x0.5 speed option
I've had bare wanks over this
Gal: Very well then.\nKate: Alright... alright... alright... alright
Ugh, dykes ruin everything.
Okay, so in order for women to be strong and independent they need to be more like men. Got it. Message received!
stupid fn show.\nMAKE AMERICA & TV \nGREAT AGAIN!!!
I'm old enough to remember when SNL was funny.
fucking sjw shit being forced down my fucking throat maaan i miss the old SNL the fuck was the purpose of the kiss anyway??
who are these people downvoting?
Gal gadot is not hot at all
So sick of homosexuality having to be in everything on TV nowadays.
It's time to rewatch gilmore girls))

Is there any one who ships to australia. YOU NEED TO OPEN UP IN AUSTRALIA. MY daughter loves your product. Suzanne
Hey I'm from New York and I would love love\nLove if your cosmetic line would be available in the US I'm so jealous of everyone who's able to get them! They look amazing. Love your vlogs so much congrats on your new line 💕
Their are 4 heavy guns
it should be illegal for kids to play lootbox games like this because its GAMBLING I DONT SEE KIDS GOING TO THE CASINO DO YOU???
There's a huge difference between this and Overwatch Loot Crates. Overwatch Loot Crates are purely cosmetic and otherwise don't affect playing the game in any way whatsoever. When crates start affecting the gameplay p2p, that's stupid. Didn't get BF1, won't get BF2.
60$toplay with pay to win model welcome to the end of gaming
Gaming just makes me sad now.
All of y'all are a bunch of idiots. Not gonna buy a game because you hate something that you have to buy. Wow you guys are fucking pathetic as shit
I don't want Dice doing this shit.
Thank you Joe, for you've saved my wallet a few bucks. \n\n\n/runcommand- Cancel > Preorder\n\nTime to play the old school AvP2 and crack open a cold one with the Xenomorphs.
This game is even worst because it's star wars. It's coming out with a new movie as well, it's going to sell like crazy. Industry finally figured out how to push it.
I could've come up with a better loot crate system.\n\nFor each match you play, online or offline, and for each kill you get, you earn credits. Credits can be used to BUY the GUNS. And Craft Points can be used to make upgrades and attachments. Accordingly, Craft Points are earned through the Loot Crates.\n\nNow, Loot Crates are in game purchases. Each crate gives you a Guaranteed Craft Points: 10-100, as well as a change to get some SKINS (not emotes or posses), Color Schemes to customize those skins, and a chance of getting a Legendary Weapon. And just to make the player feel rewarded, 1 Free Loot Crate, and 50 Craft Points, are rewarded to the player for Leveling Up.\n\nNow costs: .99¢ for 1 crate. $1.99 for 2 crates. $2.99 for 4 crates. $4.99 for 6 crates. $8.99 for 10 crates. $10.99 for 15 crates. And 12.99 for 20 crates.\n\nWhat do you all think?
lol i got 30 parts a 20 and 10 mate  so  totally worth the loot creates for that what a shame had such hopes for this game wish i had not pre ordered
Truth be told the loot boxes don't affect the gameplay as much as you'd think. For example, slightly quicker cooldown can be useful, but only in select situations.
This issue won't be resolved without a lawsuit against microtransaction based gambling mechanics.
Everyone seriously just DON’T buy this game! Why would you want to put money in these greedy ass developers pockets, you would just encourage other developers to do the same. Plus, the game won’t even be fun at all when you can literally buy an advantage! Throw skill down the toilet, hand them your money, and you win. Don’t buy this game at all and they won’t make any money, they will have lost hundreds of millions and learned their lesson and never try this shit again.
This sucks peepee. Yes, Joseph. It sure does.
this has gone too far, you buy the game but not really,
Thankfully, EA has responded to fix it.
This is why we should have stopped this at the mobile games. We let them get a toe-hold and now the disease is going to spread to all games! never ignore crap because eventually it will stink up the whole house.
I seriously am shocked at how bad this video is
I booted the beta, saw loot boxes, uninstalled. I had to deal with this shit in to many games already. No more.
this is probably why the rewards are the same no matter how well you do. It's because of how much of an advantage these star cards can give you in a match. So no matter how good you are, you'll get the same rewards. This will only make the game less fun for newer players picking up down the road.
I don't usually comment on game vid reviews or such but in the beta to be fair to dice those second weapons I believe could be obtained with class mastery achievements, because I didn't spend anything on weapons expect cooldown thing on heavy (super legit) but I got both the 2nd weapons for heavy/assault. Weapon wise for non-point spawn classes there is at least 4 if you pre-order you get a better version of the original 2. I do agree on the credits though I'm a middle level player ( at least 10 kills a match) but if someone can piggy back that's not cool cus there is always someone on scoreboard with 0/0 and that angers me. nice vid btw.
As gamers we vote with our money. This means, to win against this is to boycott, wait for worthy developers to create a proper single player/ multiplayer games and endure the drought of quality games. We can't lose hope as of yet, there are developers that still care for the gamers out there, like cd projekt red, Bethesda, Guerilla, and Naughty dogs. Now more than ever, we have to support their games and make them see, great games sell themselves, not microtransactions.
Hey Joe, don't usually comment. But this is exactly why EA thinks the consumer wants this. When you got sports games like FIFA which deal with FUT packs which is exactly the like the loot boxes in battlefront, all just for EA to make more money. It sets a dangerous trend but it's not gonna end anytime soon. Expect more of this!!!!!
Loot boxes are not gambling, its just plain straight a scam.
we have have to stand together and boycott these companies people it's now or never
Fucking stop giving your money to EA! They've been balls since Skate or Die 2... fuck...
Its pay to win now...
Even if many voices are against this loot crates system (supposing it stays the same upon release) people will still buy the game for the single player campaign.\nMaybe this was the whole plan.\n\nBut first and foremost, Battlefront is a multiplayer game and I wonder why this mechanic was in the Beta knowing too well it would get this reaction.\n\nProgression based on items, time, luck and money can be a fun factor but I prefer when all the options are available at the start an let the player choose or a bonus system\nwhich is based not on a player basis but on a match basis.\n\nYour only satisfaction should be the killing, team play/objectives and the Leaderboard.
Imagine a racing game, where you had to race 500 times to unlock a new engine, and then you could only unlock the second worst engine in the game, before you had to race another 1000 races to unlock the second best engine.  Then another 100 races for the ability to use wet tires.  and then another 100 to unlock adjustable downforce on your wings, so that you could actually control the car with the engine you got because you didn't have any way to know what it would be like using each upgrade, and what upgrades you should be looking for early on.
Guess I'll play campaign to death and online for shits n giggles.
Ea announced that they are going to change the loot system and that there was a fleshed out progression system that is in the full game, just didn't make it in the beta. I will quote dice on the fact that the most powerful star cards and weapons are obtained from in game achievements and stuff. You also get rewards and progression form each class you play. This game isn't fucked guys :)
EA have gone down hill for several years. And now they hit rock bottom. After BF4 I stopped buying their games.
Not going to be purchasing this garbage as much as I was looking forward to this...not unless the progression changes significantly
Joe you can also get crafting points from getting the same card again. For example if you had 25 out of 50 cards then you have a 50% chance to get the same card. This means you now have a 50% chance to get more crafting points. So if you had 50 out of 50 cards then your going to get crafting points no matter what.
Never bought ea games never will. Don't know why people buy their shit.
It's pay to win in a game where winning makes no tangible difference to your experience.\n\nIn essence it's pay to pay. Paying for paying's sake.
Reminder that farm animals in human form actually defend the cancerous  practice of lootboxes\n\nwhat has the world come to
more people should just stop buying stuff from EA or any other publisher till they get their shit together. Else it will get worse and worse.
This is a tough call. On one hand I love Star Wars. On the other I REALLY HATE micro transactions.
The moderns consumers inherit need to go out of their way to protect and defend companies astounds me. Do they think they are buddies? Do they think the company somehow cares about them or that they owe the company unquestioned loyalty?\nConsumers should care about consumers. Companies already do everything in their power for their own good. They will not go out of their way for your rights or to be nice to you. Regurgitating one liners you have heard before, like companies need to do this to surrvive, as some kind of sacred truth without questioning it only turns you into free product labour for the company. You should think better of yourself. And you should understand that any consumer standing up for consumers is also standing up for you. They are not your enemy and they deserve your support, not you blind defence of the company.\nCompanies already do all in their power to get as much out of consumers for as little effort as possible, fellow consumers should not help them in that endeavour.  Instead consumers should be equally focused on making sure consumers get as much as possible for as little as possible. Then consumers and companies have the opportunity to meet in some healthy place in the middle.
I'm not surprised. Fuck EA
This is so greedy. Why cant everyone just make Lootboxes for costumes and emotes? Fuck man.
Wonder if there's going to be a lot of afk players earning credits at the same rate as everyone else?
I understand you are correct about the progression and currency system. But you are also getting crafting shit or currency as rewards from completing challenges as startroopers or soldiers etc.
Free DLCs? I've heard that before.
Time to afk in lobbies and not play the game while getting the same currency as you lol
Ya know what you do? STOP BUYING THEIR SHIT! \nIf EVERYONE stops giving them money, they’ll STOP doing it.
true! i `ve played the beta to, can `t tell the difference from the older one, menus are different, new maps but.... :D good job Joe
I think these loot systems really suck becuz they are always paired with crappy credit distribution. It be like match completion 100 points, win bonus 50 points, there 150 credits :) uhhhm no can i get like credits worth my effort? I got mvp, i got top score, i got most kills, i got most objective push points. Wheres my bank?? Why is the guy who was AFK the whole game getting the same amount? I think thats what really burns me cuz damn if i got credits for performance id have all the damn cards in the beta platinum rank from all the boxes i earned😂
this is a shame the game looks so gorgeous and fun to play but looks like greed will win the battle for the galaxy.
This is why I don’t play new games anymore
Wow this has certainly opened my eyes with just how utterly fucked we are as the gaming industry has done this. And how we the consumer have ALLOWED this to happen. I'm telling you people we have the power to stop this shit! But knowing the fuckbois they're gonna spend they're money on these loot boxes!!! I mean c'mon I'm genuinely disappointed in this. And saddened to see Star Wars come to this seriously I'm giving up hope. FUCK YOU EA FUCK THESE MICROTRANSACTIONS AND FUCK ALL THOSE SHEEP WHO BUYS THESE IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!
I've pre-ordered Star Wars Battlefront II, but after playing the Beta I'll not be playing the multiplayer component. The loot crate system is, as you've said, completely pay to win.
Skill isn't rewarded anymore, get used to that because you only get rewarded if they get rewarded... With your money. I see how it fucking is EA.
lets say 500 ppl pre ordered battlefront for 60, and 200 bought origin for 79.99 they woould make aroun 45k with these micros add in, they would be able to make lets say a dollar a box. If this game was free, and you didnt have ro pay 60$ and up, the micros would be no problem, idiots like to by things they already paid for, so they started putting dlc in to test the waters, then cosmetics, then weapons, and now its at pay for progress. It was pretty obvs that this was the next move. To be honest i feel like this would be more acceptable if games were actually hard, nowaday games require no effort, and you get a pay to over power you option. I remeber when games required real thought with things like, Dead to rights PacmanSuper smashBleachNaruto the broken bondninja gaiden 1-2 when you guys started being satisfied with button mashing fake skill combat games like assasian creed and naruto ninja storm 1-4, you accepted all of this. If you don't  beleive me, play the roms, or find a copy for the old systems, the games required actual learning, not tap squre until u see a yellow triangle, and pretent it took skill to win the fight. If u accwpt crap gameplay, you accept crap transactions.
I wish more games were focused with co op than multiplayer. Like imagine a call of duty game with no multiplayer but instead a singleplayer based with up to 4-8 co op with these big maps in each level that has side missions that you can complete and progress to unlock weapons and perks in the game like an rpg. Wouldnt that be more fun than playing online with players that kill everyone because they spent money to get the best upgrades and no one can enjoy their experience because of a level 5 player that has the strongest upgrades you wouldnt get until your level 50. I wish game developers would go back to 2003 and make games like the first halo with fun co op and multiplayer as long as there isnt fucken microtransactions to speak of.
Simple, not buy this stupid game
Thats why i don't purchase the game until I've played it first I pirate the games and if they did a good job I will go in and buy a physical copy. I play league and I've spent 300 over this past year.... and I'm completely ok with that
I was sooooo hype for this, shadow of war, and ac origins but I just can't support this bullshit
This shit is why I've gone back to playing tabletop games like Warhammer.
I feel your sadness. After 40 years of gaming, I feel like we're hitting the end here. It'll be up to Indies to cater for the real gamers going forward and I'll be playing old games only.
Imagine in 10-20 years when we'll have to buy loot boxes to get the actual game.
Another game I won't be buying. Add this next to Shadow of Microtransactions.
Cancelled this pre ordered Dragon Ball FighterZ
Overwatch is trash
Sees loot crate then walks away.
Song at the end anyone?
Can we go back to the 2000-2010 era of gaming? This decade sucks.
i look forward to the full game review rant
Well I'm out and if this turns out to be the future of video games I'm out of gaming entirely.
SIMPLY BOYCOTT
You suck
EA worstttttt company in 2017
I only play Overwatch, ever. The only game in the world where the micro transactions are cosmetic only, and the game is fully unlocked right from the start. I don't have time for anything else. Maybe you kids do, but not me.
So you play to get currency to buy crates for a chance to get currency to get weapons
Welcome to gambling in every type of video game genre..... how is this even legal?
The new age kids, millennials, they want it now and they have the money to pay for it.\nSo give them,give them hard.\nBtw, Joe you have the money, just buy all the shit and you can review the game in no time.
People need to put their foot down and say no to games like star wars and Shadow of war lotr. I will not buy either.
hands up who's suprised. No-one? Thought so. Fuck this game
It's an EA game, the most absolute money greedy gaming publisher in the world next to KONAMI. Of course they will done fucked it up! EA always does this shit. Boycott is the only way to get rid of this poisonous shit system in the gaming industry.
I'm not defending the loot system at all, but hear me out. I believe you get specific loot crates catering to specific classee when you level it up and it comes with that classes specific gun. So if you play assault and level it up, you unlock a crate that comes with the next gun in the assault class so you don't need scrap to unlock the guns. I played the the Battlefront 2 beta and didn't spend any scrap to unlock a gun. The only time I spent scrap was to buy mods for my guns, but I can agree even that is pretty shady.
Well, they said they’d change it so lets see how they fix this.
I paid for this already. I liked the game. I'm sad about the boxes then I go to YouTube and find NO ONE TOLERATES THIS QUASI GAMBLING!\n\n\n\nDamn son
You done fucked up E A -A -A RON!!
The climax of pay to win in game methods is before us. Bet you never saw this coming.
buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuullllllllll shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
Fucking asshole with your random ass screaming into the goddamn mic waking me up and shit. On God I hope your dumbass videos never find their way into my feed ever again
EA after hearing the concerns of their players after the beta has decided to remove the high tier weapons and cards from loot boxes and lock them behind a lvl wall which is much better than locking all this shit behind a pay to win loot crate
I already know that I wont buy this game. Its rediculous how many games are including this these days... They should lose way more players with this.
I pre-ordered from greenmangaming............can't cancel order............fuck...
Campaign? If not Fuck you EA.
Still better than a $50 season pass.
Just don't buy the game at launch, that's all you need to do.
They are greedy this is going to spell the end of the gaming industry once again I've been gaming since 1985 and I'm tired of playing video games because of shit like this broken games loot crate's pay to win man I'm done goodbye gaming industry
The credit system will change its messed up for the beta
no one buy this shit pleas tell EA to go fuck themselves.
In pretty much every game beta version I have played before the income rates and prices for ingame objects were completely different from the final version. So I don't think we have to be too concerned about that just yet. Looking at the Battlefield games from DICE with a similar Battlepack system you get new attachments, camo and stuff at a decent rate.\nThe fact that there are only 2 (or 3) weapons per class in the Beta is also something I remember DICE doing since the BF Bad Company 2 Beta and the full games nerver fell short of weapons to play with. They probably don't want to spoil to much of the final game and keep the download size small. So also no need to worry in my opinion.
The Developers have said the progression will be faster in the full game
I preordered Battlefront 2 in 2005 for my birthday. When I got to the store they had sold my copy to someone else. My mom, brother, best friend and I drove 1 hr to several other stores before we found a copy- that store’s last copy. We drove home and my friend and I stayed up all night playing it on the PS2. It was one of my best birthday memories. So sad that EA has ruined this franchise. I preordered Battlefront (2015). Was so disappointing. I won’t be preordering or buying this.
Wow!❤️

This is an amazing video!
I've just seen the movie and i'm gonna say it was as awesome as the songs were. 10/10
The best video and music
Back again King Hasbro   I cant kept from Playing this song  . will be picking up sound  track  soon
Amazing video! Could you please make the lyrics video of the song Open Up Your Eyes? That would be 20% Cooler! :D
Hasbro you are not getting enough Sales due to the Bad Critics an there FAKE Reviews. You need to put out more Commercials. An advertise it more. No spoilers.Just advertise it more.
sia is the best
Good movie and some animations (well most of them) came from the movie I see.
When i see the cutie mark:\nIts the human souls from undertale\n(P.S im not a brony,i just love SIA's music)
Oh, it's really cool!

I like rainbow dash Bec she was loyal and cool! I also like twilight sparkle Bec she care about her friends!
I love Sia so much!!!
I love this song it is relaxing song
Hasbro,\nI know you probably get comments like this alot I apologize but I just want to say how fantastic the My Little Pony Movie was! The animation was spot on, and I loved that Tempest Shadow realized that accepting friendship is much better then being evil. I also liked the Hanazuki short film the theater I was at showed just before the movie. Nice job Hasbro!
But srsly i love this song, and I really don't like pop...
I love the animation in this

superhero is my fav!! monsuir big is alright dont think its worth the money plenty of better drugstore options. tartiest is awesome def my second fav.
Donate to me😣😣😣😣
Is it possible to create a list in the description box of what you keep for these kinds of videos, as a quick reference guide for when we next go to purchase a product.
You can buy Fiona stiles at their website
I love when you do these and go through everything, I bring a pen & paper to the table and write down things to maybe try. The only thing that kinda stinks is since you put the name of the products before you say whether you like it or not, I end up having to pause and rewind to catch the name again but that's okay <3 Thanks for a great video
I love you so much Tati ❣️❣️
That glittery lower lash eyeshadow...and the red lip we and James love! 😍
I would like to see some recent skin care routine
Tati, can we get a perfume haul....PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!
lol I love when Tati came across the T** Faced products
Wowa, you are so beautiful today!
HI Tati, question, do you use like visine or something else to make the white of your eyes soooooo white?
I like the revlon red lid formula but i didn't like the brush it was so scratchy.
Could you try catching it tho??? thanks \nI died!
You look stunning!! I love what you did with your eyes, and that red lip is perfect. <3
You’ve inspired me to get rid of things. Thank you
I would LOVE if you did this 'spring cleaning' with eyeliners! I'm Asian, so I monolid horribly, and really really need a budgeproof smudge free eyeliner for my oily lids. It always comes down and makes raccoon eyes, and I've tried at least 6 different drugstore liners and none of them have done it for me yet.
When you do these videos could you compile a pdf of all the products that you liked that worked for you, and ones that didn’t work for you, since In your description box you can’t list all of them. I would love to know all the ones you like, especially the affordable ones! Thanks love💕 keep slaying 💁🏻🔥
Tati you should do this with eyeliners. Need a good drugstore one that doesn't run.
Love to see more videos like this❤
We are so proud of you too, I need to do that with my makeup collection
Love that your just as equally excited about essence as you were about Marc jacobs
Great Video!! Love these makeup graveyard Videos 👍👍👍\n\nHey everyone I would love it if you check out my instagram page my.makeup.goods 😊 I would really appreciate your support😘
Please please please do a tutorial on your eye look!
I hope you saved your throw aways. I can't remember the organization but there's one out there that cleans and uses the brushes to help clean ocean wildlife (like penguins) when there is a spill.
Love your lips and face makeup, hate it your eye makeup look too powdery and chalky... BTW you should comment all the products mention and pin it
If your mascara wand is one that isn’t plastic, one that is fluffy, you can usually bend them to reach all of your lashes perfectly. Just bend the tip of the wand on the opening of the tube. It’s such a good little trick I’ve accidentally tried!
Love the eye look!!
Tati's makeup is especially bright in this vid. Love it ❤
Hey Tati, I know this is weird but talking about lashes. I'm struggling to find one that curls my lashes all the way through the lash line. I have slightly hooded eyes like you, every curler I've tried doesn't curl my outer corner lashes because it touches my eye bone and it doesn't reach them, it's so annoying! What eyelash curler do you use? Or do you know some good ones for hooded eyes? \n\nLove you! ❤️\nAnd thanks for the help in advance.
Oh, who’s the mystery helper??
What lighting do you use other than natural lighting
Loooooooove your earrings where did you get them??
Loling at the Too Face throw 😂
Loved the video! Always honest ❤️❤️❤️
your makeup is even better than usual in this video if that is even possible! so stunning!!
The description box actually made me crack up laughing! You know you have too much mascara when you can't even list all of them in the description box <3
HOLY! Loved this video, big thumbs up! Yes do this with your other makeup products! maybe palettes? snap family!
you should do a video using an actual aloe vera plant as a primer!
I like how composed her videos unlike some of the you tubers out there who’s just into leeching on brands
Idk why but i really want to highlight her collar bone
proud of you! you downsizing motivates all of us to do the same\n!
You always have the cutest clothes and accessories!!!!  Can you please put where you got them along with your daily make up 😘😍😘😍
Tati you need to try the dark blue version of the Catrice Glam&Doll, it's mind blowing
When you donate, where do you donate to? I lost all of my makeup collection in a house fire. I’m a MUA and it’s so upsetting. I love you Tati! I learn a lot from you!
Impressed by not keeping 101 and keeping 15, wow!
Can I have the mini's? :(
somewhere in the distance bella hadid is crying over tati hating dior pump n volume
Why did she not keep the Roller Lash ? She said she was but in the final basket she didn't say she kept it
Please upload more videos like this, its super informative for a makeup newbie...love u tati!
I think this is the prettiest makeup I've ever seen on you.
Why grandiose? 😱😭 i've never tried anything better on my lashes 😱
I always love when you do a big declutter haul. It would be great if you could go through your best black eyeliners (eyeliners in general, water line, etc), and winter skincare routine! xoxo
Will you be reviewing the new Charlotte tilbury palette?
It’s amazing that beauty gurus have an almost textbook memory for products they’ve tried. Like Tati just rattled off mini reviews almost for like 100 products! It’s kind of impressive she remembers specific experiences with all of those.
Omg i have just saw more mascaras than i used in my entire life!
Love your tutorials. Can you do a tutorial with zoeva products?
TATI!! I would love to see you test out Ciate London’s new glitter flip lip. It starts out as a matte lipstick but when you rub your lips together it turns into glitter!
Hey Tati, can you do a review on the Luxe Glitz Palette by Jolie Beauty??
Hi Tati. Can you please do one one primer and setting sprays together? Thanks Tati❤️
I love these videos!!
Tati? You don't have any Toofaced products? You should do a full face of Toofaced. 🙂
do it again, any product loved it Tati xoxo from Canada
I'm so poorly just watched 10 of your videos you're getting me through. I love you Tati 💕
Tati, we need a makeup set up tour!!!! I wanna know how your organize your makeup drawers/ how you sort and store them.
what are your opinions on merle norman?
Tati:  Where do you donate your items to?
who is taylor?
I only have one muscara from essence \nYour lucky to own all of that
But what about better than sex and Lights camera lashes :o
Okay this was very needed. Thank you so much.
You wanna love yo self, you gotta date yo self honey! Hahah GOLD!! Ps you're an adorable human and I love this video.
So I need that mug
“Go get some exercise” does walking to McDonald’s count lol
I had a bad day and this helped so thank you💕✨
Like,,,HOW is it possible i could love you more than I already do but THAT CLIP OF YOU SINGING NEXT TO NORMAL. DEAD.
I find the best thing I do to help my mental health is cut out all (most) self deprecating humor. If someone else talked to me in the same way that I thought of myself I would not be friends with that person. It pays to be your own best friend and not worst critic.
Even if the world is falling around you...there's always tea I need this on a mug
Cayleigh for real this is fucking brilliant advice, what a fab video x
I appreciate your Josie reference
We're not in the dark timeline, we're in *the darkest timeline*! D:
watch videos of baby sneezing and facing or just cats
First, your bathtub is incredible. Also this is much needed. Let's all be mad in this mad world.
I love how you balanced the seriousness of this video with humour, subscribed! :)
my love for you continues to grow, thank you so much for making this <3\n\nalso your bathtub looks amAZING OMFG

I loved this video❤️
ive had to have two days off work because of my mental health (aka this Monday and Tuesday) and I needed this. Thank you cayleigh x
You're amazing! Have an excellent day and have faith it will get better!
yay for mental health awareness!ヾ(๑l 7 l๑)ﾉ this video is helpful and hilarious haha!
find a pet store and just go hold baby animals \ndon’t buy animals from pet stores or think about puppy mills while ur there though
I give myself support even tho I feel like a freak for going to online uni because of social anxiety
you tell your self that your amazing and that you love you self even if you don't believe it you just say it and it helps i think i don't even know
Something that personally helps me is playing music/writing music but that’s a ~me~ thing. Also jamming to La La Land cause I’m a basic white girl
The little positive messages idea is such a good concept!! I’m definitely going to start leaving myself little reminders. Thanks babeeee
bee and puppycat! (p sure)
Um.... Oh.  Uh... The link is no working... How can support Cayleigh? Helps please?
ah man i wish wine still helped rather than making everything worse, those were the days lol
Your bathtub is yuuuuugeee
1:03 holy shit that reference. this is why you're my favourite
I SAW THE FLOWER BOY ALBUM COVER AND I SCREAMED
I need that Rick T-shirt for my mental health please where do I find?
Just buy some fucking straws, they make drinking more enjoyable
No one's freaking out about the bangs bit so I will omg I was so shocked for a second then I was like omg that looks so good on her then I was like ohhhhhh\nA true rollercoaster well trolled Cayleigh
Yas Fran bow! Something that helps me is to go on little day trips somewhere (it doesn't have to be far or expensive). I also like coloring books as well as baking.

Self-care suggestion: Watching Ron Swanson compilation videos while eating steak
This video is wonderful, thanks Simon. My mental health is bit of a dumpster fire at the moment and all these world mental health day discussions are catching me off guard, but I think are exactly what I need, if that makes sense. Midwinter was a book that destroyed me, and I didn't even have the personal connection you did - there's just something so vulnerable and beautiful about a book that expresses sadness that well. I read my favorite book (The Mill on the Floss) when I was going through a rough patch, and it just articulated things inside me that I'd never thought were important enough to be captured on paper. Anyway, going off on my own tangents now, thanks again for your thoughts
From a person who suffers with mental health issues I send you much love Simon. Thank you. 💚
Great video Simon and thank you for sharing your mental health story with us. I absolutely agree that books can help with some mental health symptoms/ situations. I suffer from anxiety and depression, with some periods of my life the depression was more intense and others the anxiety was more intense. I still get anxious about work related things or personal relationship where I feel that I didn't do something right or good enough and will go over it in my head. I have learned that I need to debrief at the end of the day by having time to escape into a book and have a cup of tea. This helps me to get away for a bit and not dwell on things that can be irrational. I think this was a helpful video and was great to hear how books assisted you through some of your mental health situations.
Simon thank you so much for this video and your honesty in it. Books have definitely helped my mental health in terms of self help books building up my self esteem and resilience, but also like you say getting lost in fiction. The times when my physical health has been really bad I don't know what I would have done without books - I so needed that escape. Thanks again for this video xx
Simon I love your wise words. I always look forward to watching you, and hearing about book selections. Great video.
Thanks for making this video, and being so open about your past experiences. This video has definitely helped me! :) xxx
Can I just say that hearing your wonderful voice always makes me feel better! I had a period of stress related mental illness in 2014 and sadly it affected my ability to concentrate on books. Nothing worked and only gradually has my concentration improved. It's still not back where it was, but is much better. Your video is excellent in that it shows people that bad things can happen to good people and we never know what someone else is going through. People do care though and book clubs are excellent places to find non judgemental friends!
Thank you for this video! You bring brightness in my life, I love to listen to you speak about books, or other things, it's always funny and/or interesting. \nI often feel lonely - even if I'm not alone -, but I love to be alone sometimes, which I thought was a bit weird of me. You speaking about it makes me realise I'm not the only one feeling like this, and it really helps! \nBooks have helped me through life, when I was lonely, when I felt rejected, when my parents divorced - I was too young and didn't understand, thought it was my fault in fact -, and they still do now, when I feel anxious, or unloved. I know I'll always be a bit weird, but it is a thing I must accept and live with, a part of me. \nThank you once more, it was great of you to make this video, really!
Fantastic video!  Thank you for sharing.
I think this was a good video. It is a personal thing indeed but I think that readers, or rather big readers are often people who have experienced mental health issues and have found solace in books. In 2005, there was a summer I would come home every day from work, go to bed curl up with a Jane Austen, I read all her books a couple of times that summer and Persuasion I read more than 10 times that August. I was in a very bad place and somehow Austen just got it. And then slowly I got better.
This video and your honesty with us was exactly what I needed right now, Simon! Thank you very much!
Thanks for this Simon, it's always reassuring to hear other people talk about going through the same/similar things as I have. Books are definitely a solace. When I feel in need of comfort I read Nancy Drew mysteries as they take me back to childhood!
Thank you for making this video! Reading and books have always been there for me when my depression is bad.
Thank you so so so much for posting this Simon! As someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety in the past I think its so important to us all to talk about it and know we are not alone. I think books of all kinds can not only be therapeutic for us when we are going through a difficult time mentally but also physically. I know myself when my physical health has been bad it then has had a knock on effect on my mental health-reading has helped me escape for a while when physically the only choice ive had is to rest, read and escape! :)  Thanks again -you're a gem! or a gem of a bear you might say! :) xoxx
Reading can make you escape in the darkest of times. I feel that's what's informed my reading from a young age and what let me find fantasy novels as an escape from reality since a young age. Thanks for making this video and opening up a discussion!
Ahh I love the video!
Thank you for sharing, Simon! As someone who is suffering a great deal from a debilitating  mix of depression, anxiety  and stress, I felt a lot better just to listen to another person who has been through it before. It made me feel less lonely and really hopeful about overcoming it all.
Thank you so much, Simon! It is really helps.\nI've just started to take meds for depression last week, finally gave in =D. Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, also fear of death, etc. have been with me from teen years, more than a decade already, and well, it is hard. At the moment I'm winning, because I've learnt how calm myself, even without meds (internal dialogue). Movies, TV shows and sleep are my other treatment. Unfortinately, I have this problem when I can't really concentrate if I feel sad or am caught in a loop of depressive thoughts, so I can't read. Hope that this tendency will pass with time.\nLots of love to you. Stay strong!
This was a wonderful video, Simon.  Thanks for your honesty in sharing your mental health experiences.  I often have suffered from hormonal depression, but never to the extent that is was an issue for me.  \nReading has been a lifeline for me when I have been through some pretty horrible experiences.  I don't have too many memories of before I was 11 when my parents split up.  Reading was my saviour then.  I was sexually abused for about 5 years in my early teen years, and later on my stepfather was a horribly abusive alcoholic.  Throughout all those years reading was my safe place - and it continues to the place where I feel least threatened by the world, where I feel the safest, where I feel I belong and where I don't have to do anything or be anyone but myself.  \nNowadays my own life is a lot less harrowing but my 31 year old son suffers from schizophrenia and my daughter has been diagnosed with clinical depression as well as fibromyalgia so mental health is very close and all around me.\nYou and I have vastly different tastes in reading - I am a popular fiction reader through and through, but your channel is such a welcome relief from all the noise noise noise that goes on in this world.  You are a lovely man and I always look forward to your name popping up in my subscription feed.  Thank you for your content and I wish you nothing but wellness and happiness.  Love from NZ
Lovely video Simon; I appreciate your honesty about mental health.  I needed this, as I am a bit shaky in the mental health department right now. I would like to hear your review of A Line Made by Walking.
Simon, thank you so much for this video! I've been going through a bad patch lately, and have been for pretty much this whole year, but I've found myself reading a ton lately and it has helped me so much. Books really can act as an escape and a way to not have to think about what's going on around you for a bit. I've truly found that books have helped me tons over the years I've been an avid reader.
Thank you so much for making this video and being so open. I work as a mental health therapist and I’m often talking to people about what they are reading and how it helps. It is definitely something people struggle with more than we know. I truly believe every time someone shares their story they make someone else feel more “normal”. Thank you for being brave.
Thanks so much for creating and sharing this video. I was completed sucked in, and enjoyed the bits you would have edited out - love seeing that stuff. On the topic of dealing with grief, have you read H is for Hawk? I own a copy, but haven't read it yet, but it generally comes up a lot on the topic of grief and processing change, etc. and comes highly recommended from the BookRiot gang. Anyway, I really appreciate this video, and generally, your videos are always a bright spot in my day no matter how things are going. Thank you!
So needed, great video.
This video is wonderful, I've been feeling down lately and your videos always cheer me up. It's wonderful to see more people talking about mental health.
Was having a terrible day today (just woke up like that) and this was great to see. Didn't even know i needed it until I clicked. Thanks x
I don't have a lot to contribute to the conversation, but I really loved this video.
Suffering from mood swings since going through menopause, I know exactly what you mean and you're right, reading helps!! Watching book tube videos helps. But I have phases when I can't read depressing stories or very suspenseful stories but there are a lot of other books I can read instead! Thank you for be so honest about your problems.
Thanks for sharing, I send you lots of love and hugs simon. xxxx
I wish I could 'love' this video. *massive virtual squeeze*
You are wonderful and life affirming and a joy! Thank you for all your vlogs but especially this one.  You said so much that i am going to ponder over. A couple of things about reading helping mental health in my experience: depression is exhausting and especially talking to people during depression is just too much effort. I crave silence at that time but as yiu say that can cut you off. But you can read, think, and in a way interact while being silent when yiu read. Also reading is like exercise or maintenance for the emotions and mind on a daily basis. We develop and hone our responses and capacity for imagination and empathy while we read and that pays off in hard times.
I recognized what I interpret as nerves near the end about sharing this, and I just wanted to say that I am glad you did.
That is such a touching story (I'm at the story of 10 year old Simon) and I'm sending you good thoughts.
Can I give this video like milion thumbs up...?
Wow, great video Simon. I loved reading A Line Made by Walking and Midwinter too and it's so moving hearing how you connected with them personally.
Thank you Simon for this video. I suppose it was really hard to talk about it, for that reason I even more appreciate you shared your experiences with us. Sure it will provide help/support to others. Thank you again :)\n\nPS. You are absolutely right, your channel  does bring happy moments :)))) (plus some serious added value as well)
A wonderful video thank you! I appreciate all you've done and said. Sending you love
Powerful. This is a video I shall return to again and again. ❤️
Thank you so much for your brave video. Really honest, vulnerable and important! Wanted to give you a big hug at the end :)
I am really glad you decided to upload this video. We do share some similar experiences, especially regarding grief, so, as you said, it‘s so helpful to know you‘re not alone.
This was a truly lovely video Simon. Thanks for sharing. Reading is generally speaking a source of stress relief for me, but as you said it can also be a balm in terms of finding others (whether fictional or not) that have had shared experiences. I have gone through one or two periods of intense anxiety and that actually makes it really hard to focus on reading. I've found that audio books are actually better when you have too much nervous energy so that you can take walks or run or whatnot and at the same time listen to a story. Stories can really help draw the mind away from negative loops and focus on something else.
Thanks so much for doing this video and for being so open. I can relate to what you were saying about reading being helpful for your mental health and comforting you through tough times. although it's only this year that I have returned to reading & found book tube and it has a been a real comfort and life saver for me. I have read 80 books since May when I started reading again and I can't believe that I stopped reading for 7 years!!! Thanks again for sharing 😍
Thank you so much for this video!! I live with a mental health condition and at its worst it makes me very socially isolated (nature of the beast innit?) but books have always kept me feeling connected to the world, at least in some small way and have proved invaluable. I've always loved the Jeanette Winterson quote Art is an air pocket in an upturned boat,  that's what books have been for me. Also - sometimes if I struggle to engage with the world and have to retreat for a while, when I start to feel ready to re-connect I find spending some time knitting (other crafty pursuits are available! ;) and watching a backlog of booktube videos enormously therapeutic. It allows me that 'halfway house' of feeling like I'm hanging out with lovely people while not having the immediate pressures that socialising entails. So, yes, thanks, loved your unedited honesty - wonderful video!
Thanks Simon you probably just helped a lot of people.
This is great. I have a mental health blog and agree, although I am not a doctor, just sharing what works for me does help people so thank you. And thank you for talking about MH too! I would love a goldsmiths video and or a line made by walking video. All of the videos. ALSO. Can you tell us when the dates for the costa are? Like longlist and shortlist and announcements? I can't find it anywhere but I might just be being silly. Xxx
Thanks so much Simon, I found that really helpful. I started reading again because of grief, my daughter died. I found comfort and understanding in books. It helped me comprehend what my family and I was going through. I still look out for good grief stories.
This is wonderful. I needed this video right now.  Thank you thank you thank you.
Fantastic video. I've also had issues in the past, and often still struggle with anxiety, it's great to hear people speaking openly about these things. I also think books definitely help. I'm a bit of an introvert (like a lot of bookish people I suppose) and have a tendency to isolate myself. I went to a talk last night and Ali Smith mentioned isolation and reading, how you can feel alone and go and sit by yourself in a room, but as soon as you open a book that room fills with people.
Thank you for sharing your own experiences Simon .Reading helps me escape. 👍sleeping helps too. XXX
There was one book I picked up after my brother died that helped me a lot.  The best part of this book was being told to acknowledge your feelings and allow them to be...for a bit.  It was also good to have an activity to do, something that made me feel like I was doing something to dig out of my pit because the book actually has tasks to work through.   I still grieve for him 12 years later but it doesn't take me into the pit of hell when it comes over me now.  The Grief Recovery Handbook  by  John W. James, Russell Friedman
This is one of my favourite videos of yours. Thank you for addressing this difficult topic that's also been/is very present in my life, and for being so vulnerable and honest! I'm going to try and get my hands on a copy of A Line Made By Walking asap. Thanks for doing so much good, Simon! x
Great video! And what an important topic!\n\nMy first major downward spiral was about 12 yrs ago. I had just discovered Audible and, wanting the biggest bang for my buck, I searched for the longest books with the best ratings. I stumbled onto Outlander by Diana Gabaldon and was instantly captivated by Davina Porter's narration and the main character of Claire. Davina's Claire became my best friend. She was smart and tough and I just fell into her story. Reading was definitely an escape from terrible things going on in my real life but also gave me a reason to hang in there through each day so I could listen to the next chapter at bedtime. That book is 40+ hours long so it lasted many many days. And there are a ton of sequels. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Claire saved my life. Eventually I made my way to therapy and a good doctor. But I'd never have made it that far if it weren't for that book that just hooked me. I hope everyone who struggles with depression finds a book, or many books, to fall into one day at a time.\n\nOn a side note, you are looking particularly handsome today Simon! (Swear I'm not a stalker. Just speaking the truth 😊)
Brave video Simon, and beautifully delivered.  I also like to be alone, but not lonely, and given my physical isolation, I feel like my Booktube family are my most important and easiest to access portal to a social life with like-minded people.  I'm in a beautiful place and mostly thrive on the isolation, but some days I'm so glad when you pop in for a chat.  You are funny and wise and self-deprecating, such good qualities in an imaginary friend.\n\nOddly enough, I've just begun reading a short story in bed at night before going to sleep and it helps enormously.  I'm currently reading 'The Day I Ate Whatever I Wanted'  by Elizabeth Berg and it's very good.\n\nIncidentally, I've also just finished Tin Man (recommended by you and others).  Absolute heartbreaker and I loved it.  Thanks for the chat.
Wonderful video, Simon. Hugs and more hugs.
You are such a good egg Simon, you really are. Talking about mental health needs to be continually kept relevant. I can't even talk about the things which have effected my mental health in the past ... you are very brave xx
Thank you so much Simon. This was a wonderful video! I truly appreciate your openness. My aunt introduced me to Will Schwalbe's beautiful book.  I've also read his more recent work, Books for Living.  He is a wonderful bookish companion. I cannot imagine a life without books. I find such solace in reading. Thank you again for sharing your own experience.
amen....to all the here's to's that you mentioned..and here's to sharing as best we can and here's to you simon for your generosity in creating this video.
Best video yet! Thank you for sharing your very personal story. I can relate. I’ve had anxiety for a long time and my depression spurts come and go as well. I agree that books can be a form of escapism. Reading them as well as just wandering around bookshops works for me. I also have a rather large dvd collection if I need a quick escape fix. I also think is true that every once in a while we find a book that speaks to us and leaves us all a little less lonely. All my best to you!
It is an amazing gift you've given us by sharing your journey - calmly, kindly, warmly. With regards to the grief, A Year of Magical Thinking, by Joan Didion, made me realize I wasn't alone.
Thank you for sharing. I think we put so much emphasis on being yourself and uniqueness in general that we forget how important and comforting it is to be reminded that, in the end, we're actually not so unique. I am not the only person in the world experiencing a problem. Someone else has been there. You are not alone. Someone else has felt that. Etc.
Thanks for such a wonderful video Simon! Mental health is exactly what you said, something that we need not be afraid to talk about! I'm so glad to hear that you liked A Line Made by Walking. I was recently able to pick it up for only a few dollars as an ebook. I'm really looking forward to getting to it!
I don't even know where to start with this comment - I have been binge watching BookTube today and thinking about starting my own and I come across your channel at 1:30am - firstly it's lovely to find a fellow Brit, secondly, it's lovely to see someone my age and thirdly, I think you are basically the male version of me!  (I should state I love ALL BookTubers, but meeting a Brit the same age as me has given me renewed hope that I can indeed give this a go!\n\nI smiled, I LOL'd and I teared up watching this.  I haven't ben through anything like what you have but so much of your journey sounds like mine - I loved it when you said I don't like feeling lonely but I quite like being alone. this is something I have struggled to get other people to understand so it is refreshing to hear someone else say it.  And I totally, TOTALLY have the paranoia thing too, in fact it's what caused me to lose a job 18 months ago .. well that an the panic attacks I was having almost daily (mostly due to the paranoia and anxiety I experienced in my role and at the place I worked,\n\nThank you so much for opening up so honestly and eloquently (tangents are fun). I shall stop here otherwise .. well it's nearly 2am now and I really should get to bed ..!\n\nPS - you have a new stalker ;)
Thank you for this heartfelt video. When my sin died I spent a lot of time with Jane Austen. I know those characters/people so well and they never let me down. I didn't want any surprises or mysteries just good writing and friends (well, Elizabeth Bennet is my friend!). Thanks again.
Excellent video, Simon. I'm sure that wasn't easy to share such personal moments but thank you for sharing your story with us. I think so many of us have suffered at one time in our lives with mental health, but it's so great to see so many people opening up about their struggles and breaking the stigma against mental illness. I can't think of any books in particular that have helped me through a particularly rough patch, but I definitely turn to books (and booktube!) as a source of comfort or distraction when life gets hard.
Thank you for sharing this video it really helped. I suffer with mental health and it's nice to hear that I'm not alone in how I'm feeling
thanks for sharing your experiences, Simon. I think videos like this always, always help! glad you decided to make it :)
Thank you for sharing! I think it’s hard to share something so personal. I have suffered with depression and anxiety for years. It’s been fine for awhile, but I lost my dad in December last year which triggered my depression. I have struggled all year. The reason I’ve said this is because I’ve tried to read for escape, but it is just not working for me. I’ve been in the biggest slumpiest slump of my life since he got sick in November of last year. I’ve read 30 books. I’ve probably started and put down 100. It’s just so frustrating because I want to read, but I just can’t. I’m hoping to pull out of it soon because I agree with you that it is good for depression.
Thanks for such a personal video Simon, it's actually really refreshing. I've never really thought of reading and how it relates or influences my mental health before, but I now realise that I am someone who, when lonely or depressed, either obsessively reads or gets in the biggest slump ever. There is no in between. \nThe specific books I read also tend to influence my mental health, as some books really give me a real 'high' (mostly because they're just really good books), whilst others really depress me. And I don't even always know specifically why a book has had a negative influence on my mental health, so that's a bit annoying.\nI can see how this video (and others) may feel like therapy, as just reflecting on such things in my mind sort of felt like therapy, haha.\nI'm really intrigued by A Line Made by Walking, but I feel like I may relate to it more if I read it in a couple of years, so I'm in doubt whether or not to buy it..
I have the same issue. Some days are wonderful and my excitement is off the charts and others days its like the world is upside down. I know you were hesistant to do this video but I appreciated hearing someone say they have the same issues I do. Makes ya feel not so alone.
Thank you so much for sharing this video. It's really helpful to hear about others' experiences and how different people get through the difficult moments in life, however long they last. Big hugs from me and my cat!
Yes Simon, I feel the same way as you.  I like being alone alot but I do not feel lonely when I’m reading because “books are my friends”.  Totally agree.  Thanks for sharing!
It's been really helpful to watch this semi-cuppa and a catch up/ reminisce with you Simon.
I suffer regularly with depression manifesting in self doubt, paranoia and manic spending.  Events over the last 2 years makes it hard for me to feel people truly like me for who I am or will hurt or leave me.  Recent health issues mean that more than ever my hobbies root me to reality and for this it is reading and art journalling.  I started Youtube last year and have done some book buddy reads and chatted with some lovely people.  I am so pleased you felt comfortable enough to be so open about something so personal xx
Thanks for this video. I work from home, which a lot of people think is the dream, and it is a really lonely 😔 I miss out on socialising out of office hours because I have fibromyalgia which makes it hard to sit in a hard chair for a long time and I need my rest. Your videos really help me feel less lonely. I do worry it’s a bit sad that I feel I know you but it always cheers me up to see a new video from you no matter the topic... well I would draw the line at Simon goes hunting or something 😂 I’m currently reading it’s all in your head. A guide to getting your shit together by Rae Earl at the moment which I think is meant for a slightly younger audience than me (I’m 40) but nonetheless is a good book on different facets of mental health and where to go or what to do to help yourself. Anyway thanks for the videos xx
Brilliant video - thanks for sharing :)
Brilliant, Simon.  Thank you.
Thank you, Simon. <3 <3
I completely agree that everything is spectrums, and that we should be open about our experiences when it is safe to do so.  Thanks for sharing, Simon.
My parents died in my 30s and i wasnt. ready.  I dont think anyone really is.  It wasnt books that got me though it was my Dads records the swing of Goodman and the jaxz of Coltrane and Miles. I wish i had Grief is a thing with feathers back then.
Thanks for this video Simon, and sorry to hear about the difficult times you’ve been through. I can definitely say that your videos - and those of some other lovely book tubers - have helped me an awful lot during some low times, so thank you! Also, books themselves have helped me to escape, take my mind off things and have sometimes reminded me that there are other people out there who have felt the same things as me, and have put it much more eloquently than I ever could. That’s the reason ’A Line made by Walking’ is one of my favourite books of the year too. That and the beautiful writing.
Party details in the description! Hope to see you there!\nAlso, the #MakeMusicEverywhere merch is only on sale for one more week! http://merch.andrewhuang.com
100%. This is the truth.
#820hydrate
I'm gonna make a video where I finish all my unfinished projects, and finally break the unfinished projects curse I have!\nAnd not a single word was heard about that video ever again.
Try to rap with noise cancelling headphones
Thank you so much for this advice - you are a constant inspiration! :)
We need to give Andrew a Masterclass.
Hm, I would have thought it was don't compare yourself to others
The song is so damn good I at the showing tonight and it was amazing!!!!!!!!
YOU MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY I ALMOST DROPPED MY BASS 2:56
It is SO true! Every time I start a project I find myself struggling to just finish it. I find that I fall in love with my ideas and it's so hard to create them without them being perfect, but the truth is... There is no perfect, only finished. I always have to remind myself of that but it's so true.\n\nOh, water is true too. #820hydrate
May 2009 was a month before you finished the extended NEVER (also the same month you put out BIRD SONG)
Of all times you host a meetup it's on my final exam :(
Damn I hate the new sound that plays when you upvote a comment
You are ridiculously productive.\nConsidering you put a music track and a video out in 3 days and considering the quality of the content this comes off as, well, insane.
What next I finished watching the video???
I found this to be really inspiring, so thank you so much for making this video!\nAlso, I was just wondering: how do you distribute your music? And if you do it personally: which website do you use (and why)?
That's true. I never finish anything!!
aw mannnn, I wish I could go to the 1 million subscriber party tomorrow because I'm like 3 hours away in Ontario but I don't drive and I have college :c
Once you see his eyebrows, you won’t be able to stop noticing them
These are some great tips! I've just started out with this whole music production thing, and I would highly appreciate it if you guys could give me feedback on my music: https://soundcloud.com/user-886261717  Keep making amazing stuff!
Can someone tell me what time the party is
I like how the title looks like click bait, but it isn't

There is no perfect, there is only finished.\n    -Andrew Huang 2017\n\nWords to live by.
I have a great voice
May 6th! That's my birthday! :D 3:02
Why Andrew? Why?! Why did you not emulsify your vinaigrette?
I am Finnish, thus I am complete.
Hey Andrew, you should try and make a song using different sounds from Doctor Who, just thought it would be cool.
that last song is quite beautiful. i agree with what you said about finishing projects. even though every work can be made better, at some point you want to share it with people. so you must decide what is more important to you, perfecting it, or getting it out there. i believe the whole point of creating something is to share ideas & connect with others.
*@ANDREW HUANG*\nGet a large and well isolated thermos and your ice water will last for hours and you don't need to go to the kitchen to refill it ;)
Help, I'm too good at starting!\nAll I ever do is start. I don't think I've finished anything..
So very true! Remember not to get caught up in the 'perfection' and move on to the next project.
How to make salad interesting
Hey Andrew, when will you finally visit Marti Fischer?
lmao i dont finish any of my art =(
Cannot love this video enough. I've been hearing this finish your shit message everywhere i look lately. Something tells me i should finish my shit
When you use the Push, how do you stay in key? Is it harder or easier than using a midi keyboard?
You hit one million
I didn't think I needed this but I did. Thank you.
Yessss - that was so GOOD brother, that last song had me in chills.
Song challenge: play Foreigner's cold as ice with ice cubes
Honestly, thanks so much for saying this. I'm not a musician but i do 3d animation and models and stuff and a good majority of all the time i put into it result in unfinished projects that i'm not happy with and continue to put off saying i'll finish or fix it later but I never do.I'm glad you said something about it. Thanks
you should collab with Sharpe he makes beats too
Finishing music is not easy to do
Is hard to see... 'cause it's glass.
There is no perfect, only finished. I'm taping this to my ceiling so I can stare at it when I go to bed and go to sleep.
Song Challenge: Elevator music. Make music with only the sounds from an elevator, either where you live or in a big city the next time you visit one. Bonus challenge: You can't make any of the sounds intentionally. Just ride an elevator a bunch of times recording all the sounds it makes, and the people inside. !!!
I mean I know you have 1+ mil subs but bro you deserve so many more
Did anyone actually win the million subs giveaway ? .. not me :( \n#ineverwinanything
That last song sounds so much like Coldplay I love it!!
it's hard to see because it's glass. i like this!
https://youtu.be/TkObLEgXnIU — that`s Andrew`s video from this february, that was recomended to me by youtube. Both this and that one are working both ways as prequel/sequel to each other being 9 mounths apart. Nice way to finish, keep it up.
i really like your setup! its so aesthetic
6:13 when it’ll get released?
This whole video is about the exact reason why I started my channel.
bro this video has a whole second sexual meaning
I just realized that I follow you because I envy you :l
This definitely isn't even restricted to art. It partially applies to the programming projects I do too, except finishing them takes more time.
Ive only realised this now after watching him for a year that has he ever had a voice drop?
How about a song like the intro to American Horror Story? Embrace the spooky season
And to find out what this one thing is, \n\nYou just have to buy my new book
Art is never finished, only abandoned.\n                                    Leonardo da Vinci
Thank-you for this video, Andrew. It's something I am trying to make myself understand as well as my friends too.  Keep up the inspirational videos!
Finishing is all about making decisions. And decisions are often hard.
Don't trust a perfect person, and don't trust a song that's flawless |-/
... You're everything i need XD Also, that last song was... So good.
The last track is the dreamest!!!
Inspiring as hell. 2 thumbs up from this guy
Andrew can you make music with a midi fighterlike Shawn Wasabi?
Like the Mona Lisa's eyebrows??????
I'm a new artist and I have like 25 different song ideas on my computer and not one of them is finished. It's just so hard!
Your tracks are really dope. Very unique
I wish I could have been there😭 all the best for your Friday the 13 celebration!!!!

Only English comment, a really good song, thanks YouTube for introducing me to it!
君に会いたい\n\nこれは会えてるのか？\nまた会えてないのか？？\nあえてないな笑笑
何故か訳もないのに   の部分、MVの米津玄師の口の動きと合ってないけど直前もしくは直後に歌詞変えたのかな？
曲名の「灰色と青」のように、字幕の色も「灰色と青」だ！！！！！
米津さんらしさも菅田くんらしさもどちらもあり、とても良い作品だと思います。
題名見た時「え！！菅田将暉！！」と思った\nほんとスゴイ
なんとなく開いたのに目が離せなくなってしまった…
すっ...って静かになって\n「今更悲しいと叫ぶには」\nって入るとこがなんか感動するすごい好き
本職じゃないししょうがないけど菅田将暉のピッチ補正(かな？)が慣れないと耳に少しさわるな\nもちろん曲はとてもいいし2人ともかっこいいとは思うけどもう少しナチュラルに仕上げても良かったのではとも思う
もう20回くらい聴いてしまった…\n今回もとてもいい曲でアルバムが届くのが更に楽しみになりました！
胸が痛くて のところのかすれ具合がとてつもなく好きです。
そろそろハロウィンだ〜\nハロウィンと言えばハチさんが作ったMrs Pumpkinの滑稽な夢\nってことでMrspumpkinの滑稽な夢を聴きこう🎃
なんともいえない切なさと力強さ中毒性があってクセになる
サビの盛り上がりが凄い\n米津さんやっぱイケヴォだな
菅田くんの『どれだけー』で鳥肌たった！上手すぎるね\n米津さんの曲ってのもまたいいね\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n言えば最高や
個人的には二人が同時に歌ったりハモったりする場面もほしかったな。\n青色と灰色とをはっきり区別するためにやらなかったんだと思うけど。
テンション上がりすぎて、『米津さんが電車乗ってる！！！』って変なとこで喜んじゃいました😅\n素敵なメロディに素敵な歌詞をのせて、米津さんと菅田くんの魅力的な歌声で歌い上げて…\n本当に素敵な歌です☺️
何回聴いたかわからないくらいいっぱい聴いた🎵
米津さんから菅田さんに画面が変わった瞬間に、お互いが座っていたブランコが揺れているのに気づいた…！！細かい！！！！！！
菅田っちの声米津さんの曲にピッタリ…\n凄く米津さんって感じの楽曲なのに菅田っち歌っても違和感ない
凄いな5日で300万越してる………！……米津凄いってはっきりわかんだね
総再生回数４億回突破～！！
管田くんすごくこの歌に合ってて引き込まれた
今も昔もただひたすらに好き\n曲調が変わっても、歌の雰囲気が変わっても、米津さんの歌う歌が好きなのには変わりない🤤
米津さん雰囲気と良い横顔といいめちゃくちゃかっこいいw\n菅田将暉も何してもイケメンだなww\nイケメンコンビで草
なんか色々考えさせられる曲。\n\n菅田くんも想像以上に上手くてびっくりした。\n\n控えめに言って最高
公園をこんなにかっこよくするなんてさすが米津さん
米津さんは歌う人、その人の状態を最高に活かせる人なんだね
なんだろなー\n数年前に転校して会えなくなった親友を思い出すなー
これに低評価つけるやつってどんな気持ちなの？
オタク文化がマイナーだった頃からニコニコ動画に投稿してたボカロPの曲を、今をときめく人気俳優が歌ってるのは改めてすごいことだと思う
イケメン俳優ってだけで拒否反応示す僕ですが最高です。
今回は菅田将暉に合わせた歌詞なのかな？いつもよりあたたかい気がする\n\n全部も好きです
米津さんの声もまた唯一無二が強いですよねえ
なんだろう、この曲は夜明けが似合う気がする
古米の人いいね👍
最＆高！かっけぇぇぇえ！
米津さん…ついにここまで…！(　ﾟдﾟ)\n凄い…
好き。
もう、名曲ですな
菅田将暉、一服が長い
菅田将暉の歌唱力は歌手レベル
あぁ、好き過ぎる！何回聴いたかなぁ。
米津玄師さんMステに出ておしいです
横に出る歌詞がよき

シンプルに好き
米津さんは神なんですか？
Title of this song...? Tnx
管田くん出ててびっくりしたけどうまかったからよき。
前からずっと思ってんだけど、米津さんって小学校の頃の担任にめっちゃ似てるんだよなぁ…
イケメン×イケメン＝視聴者の死\nちなみに私は死にました。 ブランコに乗ってるだけなのにイケメンは何やっても絵になるし米津玄師さんのイケボに発狂しました←
青春時代に歌とか\n2人でやってたのかな？\nそれで失敗に終わって解散して...的な？\n\n\n\n\nいい言葉が出てこないけどかっけー。
この二人似てるけど似てないような声で何か聞き入る。
どーれーだけー\nって良すぎてめっちゃ震える😭💕
菅田嫌いだったけどこの曲で好きになっちゃった
あー好きです…ここんとこ毎日聴いてます(´;ω;`)✨
菅田くんってたばこ吸うんだね！
2017  10/15
アルバム全部買うわ。
今日も好き
最高かよ
すきなんや
米津さんの歌い方本当すき
きゃああああああああああ(((
米津さんと菅田くんのコラボ最＆高！！
この曲が最高すぎてみんな語彙力なくなってるぞ。砂の惑星のときの語彙力はどこいった？？w
この曲で一緒に歌う意味ありますかね？菅田将暉に楽曲提供しておいて後にセルフカバーでアルバムに収録した方がいいのではないかと思いました。
Hi, Not sure if anyone has commented about this yet as there are a lot of comments but I'd like to ask some advice if anyone has any.\n\nSo I was on the usual combined pill for 4-5 years and I always had regular periods and if I ever missed a day I would immediately get my period. However, I recently found out that I was increasing my risk of stroke by using that pill and was immediately changed to the mini pill which immediately stopped my periods all together, I decided after 4 months of no period to stop taking it as it freaked me out a lot and I was very conscious that I was in a reasonably new relationship and the constant waiting for my period was causing anxiety so I've gone off the pill. Its been a month now though and no signs of my period have come back. I've read a lot about it online and a lot of people have said that it can take months and months for it to come back but I just wanted to hear from some other people on the topic? (My boyfriend and I used other forms of protection always at this time since stopping the pill, I've also had 3 pregnancy tests, two at home and one at the doctors because I'm so worried about it)
Lucy which is the ingredient in yasmin that should be prescribe as an acne treatment? To stop women taking accutane, i cant understand what you said 😞
LOVED this video - it's so important to talk about pill experiences! I've been on the pill since I was about 15 years old due to hurrendous pain which meant I wasn't able to do anything and on one occasion actually passed out. I started on Marvelon and it was a saving grace. Then when I moved to uni they told me they didn't have it so put me on Gederal 30/150. I tried that and started to have bad cramp again, not as intensely as before but still uncomfortable. They put me on another one (can't remember what it was called) and that caused migraines so they then put me on the POP. For 6 months I was bleeding unexpectedly and heavily. So I went back to the doctors and they instantly put me back on Gederal 30/150 because I said I would prefer to have a bit of pain over unexpected, heavy bleeding. I've been on that since April and all was well until three months ago three/four days before my period was due I began to have 'heart flutters' as though I was nervous about something. Then the day before my period I began to feel anxious and worried about everything, including being around customers at work. This has happened for three months consecutively now and the only thing I can put it down to is my pill.
Lucy! I made a video kind of talking about my expierence off the pill and mentioned you because this vlog completely turned my around mental health!!! Check it out if you wanna, I figure i'd put it out there (: \nXx
I was lucky that the first pill prescribed to me (gederel) worked well for me. I think I became way less emotionally stable, started bloating more and found my weight harder to control but I got a boyfriend and went to university at this time, so it’s hard to know whether this was actually the pill or just me changing as a person. I came off my pill about 3 weeks ago so we’ll see if anything changes with my emotions!
I never get mood swings during my period, but im not sure if thats because I run my pill packets together lol
GO ON THE MIRENA COIL! It's the best!
I can't handle yeasts either - including vinegars, fermented foods & drinks, sugar, refined carbohydrates & mushrooms. It can be connected to candida. Best of luck finding your root cause & thanks for the pretty vids.
I was in a similar boat to you, except Yasmin dried up my sex drive and gave me awful PMS. I’ve been on nuvaring for the last 3 years and it’s perfect. The hormones are released locally so a much lower dose. It’s made my mood great and I actually lost weight!
I was on microgynon and i felt horrible. I stopped hormonal contraception since 5 years, also went vegan and I have never felt better.
Does anyone have any post-coming-off-the-pill-acne advice? I've been off the pill for almost a year now and my skin just keeps getting worse and worse... I don't really want to get any medication because I know it's hormone-related so that wouldn´t really be effective. Also my hair has been getting SO greasy so quickly which is so annoying, I could literally wash it every 6 hours urgh any tips pleeeease
LUCY YOU STUNNER (also thank you for talking about the pill because youtubers like you, hannah and melanie are the only reason i know anything about sex/contraception/hormones because school teaches you nothing) xx
Also my rule I follow is to take what your doctor says with a pinch of salt. I know how wrong they can be lately. My mum almost died because of a doctor and she keeps letting them just fob her off.
I'm on the desogestrel contraceptive pill, which for me means that I don't have periods and it's completely fine and amazing! No mood swings and no physical annoyances. I've been on this for 6 years and haven't had a period since then. My doctor ensures me that this is completely fine and healthy. 10 out of 10, would recommend.
hey! my mom has celiac and she’s allergic to yeast just as much as gluten if not more, so you’re not alone
i’m so glad you decided to talk about contraceptives!! i was on the patch for a couple of months but it gave me a rash (yikes) so i went off that, and then in august i got an iud (mirena) and it’s the best/worst thing ever. my hormones haven’t regulated yet so i’ve been getting some of the worst cramps of my life, but my period is pretty much completely gone which was an issue because i have such a heavy blood flow. i’m hoping in another couple months my hormones will be a ok and i won’t have any more pain 👌
i feel like the luckiest girl in terms of periods , i get them about every 3 weeks and they are very light compared to the average from what i can see . the only side effects i get really are a few spots and being generally hungrier/a little more emotional . if i can give any advice to anyone who has horrible periods is excercise and balanced diets as that is something i practice as much as i can ! if i am eating worse and not taking care of myself my periods are noticeably heavier and my mood swings far more severe . \n(not in anyway saying that other periods are caused by a lack of excercise etc but this is just my experience ! 🦋)
“my womanhood just exploded out of me” this sounds like a line from a bad pornographic novel
I've had really irregular and extremely heavy periods with awful PMS ever since i started getting them. I thought they might even out as i got a bit older but i'm 18 now and went to see the doctor about them before i went to uni to ask if i could be put on a pill. Because I'm gay and not using the pill for contraceptive reasons as well she was really unwilling to give me anything hormonal and instead has put me on tranexamic acid to help with the bleeding. I'm yet to see if this helps but i think there's very little known about non-hormonal pills; if they work then i think they could be a great alternative for people like you who experience hormonal depression on some pills (at least if you don't need the pill for contraception).
Ive never gone on the pill, mostly because i have no abnormal or really bad symptoms (other than i have a pretty heave flow) .
I used to have pretty ridiculous mood swings and low points while menstruating, but since i've start the pill they've kind of evened out. I take Junel Fe and I haven't experienced ANY side effects aside from lighter flow! \nBefore I started the pill, I remember trying to cook an egg on the stove, the yolk proceeded to break while I was cooking it, and i fell to the floor a blubbering mess.
I struggled to take the pill daily so changed to the patch. There was next to no information on it and the doctors were clueless but I have had a good experience on it. My moods are pretty consistent and my PMS is no where near as bad as it was on the pill. Although you can see it in certain places I tend to wear it under my clothes. I would recommend it for someone who struggles to take pills daily as you change it weekly.
Why the fuck are feminists so obsessed with menstruation?
I'm allergic to concentrated yeast! It's a thing. Everything is fine except for marmite because of how concentrated it is. It broke me out in hives when I ate it for the first time.
Loved the video I find you so relaxing! I was hoping you could do a 'how cruel is my makeup bag' as you have a large following you can actually make a small difference even if it's just encouraging one person to stop using products tested on animals xx
I reacted so badly to microgynon , so i asked for yasmine and iv never looked back.  I love it and i feel so much more leveled out. This video was awesome thanks for ur honest pill journey story, i was getting really sick of youtubers banging on about how bad the pill is , theres been a huge amount of biased pill shaming , so this has been a welcomed breath of fresh air xxx
Thanks for talking about this topic. I, too, have had similar difficulties with the pill. I finally found the perfect one for me, but it's expensive, but I did find a coupon from the manufacturer that helps with the cost. I wish finding contraceptive wasn't so difficult.
For a while now I'm having a huge problem with PMS. Like  up to a week or so before my period, I start to feel really bad, emotionally. And by really bad, I'm talking suicidal. I do have depression and take anti-depressants for it, but I'm usually fine - unless it's getting close to my period. It's heartbreaking and really, really exhausting. So much so that I actually look forward to my period now because I start to feel better and more stable immediately. I'm not on any birth control, so I don't know if a pill could make this better...
There is quite a controversy growing about the pill in France lately. More and more women stop it because of side effects they don’t want to accept anymore. Consequently there is a controversy about gynecologists because they don’t listen properly to women, etc. I stopped my pill last March, after taking it for 11 years and I feel good. My libido is slowly coming back (which was the main side effect of the pill for me) and I feel less « upset and angry » all the time. I didn’t have any bad side effects. I like the fact that now my mood is way more fluctuant. I spent 10 years having a really « flat » and constant mood. Which could seem nice, but now that I actually experience emotions, I think I was like a robot in some way ^^
my contraception journey: at the age of 19 I went on the implant, I spent a year CONSTANTLY bleeding and I couldn't take it anymore. I then went to the doctors and for some reason (God knows why) the doctor decided to put me on the combination pill whilst I was still on the implant to see if it would stop the bleeding.\nAs someone who suffers with Epilepsy I have to be very careful with what medication I take because it can affect my epilepsy medication and my epilepsy in general. I started to suffer from Aura Migranes (basically if I was looking at anything my vision would flash from normal colour to all pink then all green - the only way I can describe it is like you have got pink and green christmas lights in front of your eyes and they are flashing so all you can see is the intensity of that colour). I went to see my epilepsy specialist and he got so angry at how the GP was so reckless with my condition. He told me to get the implant out and swap the combination pill to progesterone only as the progesterone doesn't affect my medication. so I did this then I spent the next year basically feeling numb, I had no feelings, it was completely flat like nothing mattered. I didn't enjoy anything, I didn't get passionate about anything, nothing affected me. Then I started experiencing pain and bleeding when having sex (obviously my immediate thought went to cervical cancer), so I went to see the doctor, had a smear then got sent to the hospital for a colposcopy. My smear came back normal but there was some abnormality but it was normal. I went to see my nurse (Ive had her for 17 years now) and she suggested coming off the pill altogether as my body might be rejecting all contraception as that can sometimes happen. I did that and the pain and bleeding stopped and it's taken a while but all my smears and colposcopys are coming back as normal. I am now 23, and even though Im relying solely on condoms (not the most effective contraception) I couldn't be happier. My advice to anyone having problems is keep going back, you will eventually get it sorted, don't suffer in silence.
I'm on rigevidon and I've have no problems with it at all. I have been on others in the past and have put weight on very quickly and struggled to shift it. But this hasn't happened with rigevidon and I have been on it for a couple of years
okay so i was in my health class and i was really annoyed and i had really bad cramps. So i like corrected my teacher when she said something wrong and she got really annoyed even though there were other people also making the comments. She then after class talks to me like why the 'fuck you actin' like that so then i'm just like i'm on my period. she then goes on about how periods don't change your mood and i almost slapped her or walked out but i just kinda had to sit there waiting to leave. it was actual hell.
I've never been sure if the awful feelings I had when I was 16/17 Was due to bad mental health, being on the pill, or being a relationship that was going down towards the end of it's run, or a mix of all three. What doesn't help is that after I broke up I decide to just give up taking it and started to feel better and was starting to finish exam stress SO WHO KNOWS MAN SO GLAD TO BE AT UNI WITH A COIL AND WITH A NEW PARTNER NOW
PMS is the worst. I'm currently trying to read up more on herbs to help normalize hormones as I've had some successes in the past (Rosemary Gladstar is a good resource for anyone curious).
What's the pill for ?
this video is so important. I went on the pill (sounds like jasmin from your description but I know it as estelle or brenda) and then roaccutane to deal with my cystic acne. once I finished the roaccutane, maybe a year later, mum suggested I go off the pill and doctor said why not so I did. within a few weeks I felt way more low than I normally do, and unfortunately that fed into my grades for the rest of semester (or was at least a factor). end of last year I went back on the same pill and felt more 'myself'. so weird that that's the case when i'm *on* medication though, and I agree with your dislike of having to depend on it.
I was in a similar situation as your friend where I completely lacked motivation. However I had a blood test done and found I was iron and vitamin D deficient so I'm taking supplements now. My mood has greatly improved thanks to it, so it's not necessarily due to the pill
Thank you for this video! Perfect timing because I have been having serious mood problems and I didn't know why. I did some research and found out it could be my pill... I'm changing brands soon and I really hope my mood will get BETTER! Love you and you look GORGEOUS!
i love this kind of video ! <3
hey thank you for making this video lucy ! it made me realise that i might be in a hormonal depression like you mentioned the pill caused for you, however i've been on depo provera / the injection for about 4 months now and my depression has been absolutely horrible. i got discharged from therapy earlier this year as i was feeling better about my depression but i had to go to back to therapy as i felt depressed again and it was also around the same time i started by birth control !!! so thank u :)
My doctor recommended me the Yasmin pill which I was on for about a year, and I found it cleared up my skin really nicely, however, I felt extremely hormonal and volatile in the off couple of days before my period. Because of this, I decided to go off of it and similarly, my skin became awful. It's taken me almost another year and a lot of skincare medication to get it back to the point of where it used to be, and I really wish someone had warned me about the consequences of going off of Yasmin.
I've tried \nCopper iud (rejected)\nEstrogen projesten combo pills (had awful hesr attack like symptoms)\nProjesten only pills two different strengths (gave me same side effects combo pills did) \nNuvaring (again same side effects)\nMy partner and I would prefer not to use condoms so we are looking into surgical options as I am in a hetero relationship and don't want kids
for what it's worth, i know someone who is allergic to yeast! so it could be that haha
Do you think your feeling of ‘craziness’ was because you had a break up, maybe you were dealing with that too?\nBut I 100% agree with the hormonal depression, I was on a pill once where I felt so low, I changed and it was so much better
I'm not sure if I just don't notice my period symptoms anymore or if they're just very mild. My periods are generally quite uneventful--I may be slightly more irritated a bit before, but nothing ever noteworthy. They typically only last three days and the only symptom I've ever noticed is some heavy cramping my first day.
Before you do 23andMe or anything of the sort I would highly recommend doing some research into the fact that they can sell your genetic data to third party companies etc!
I switched from the pill to the implant then finally to the copper coil/IUD and honestly having something hormone free has changed my life. No side affects at all apart from slightly heavier, more painful periods but generally better skin, mood, regular cycles etc. Copper coil all the way!
I'm on the pill which has helped with me getting depressed a week before the week during and the week after so basically i had one week of feeling like me and that sucked however i still have body dysmorphia and i get very emotional and everything is very sensitive which i hate and this period it was bad i hadn't seen my therapist for a week everything was building up and people were being right dick heads this week and what made things worse is that teachers at my school still don't know or even try to know about mental health issues and how to deal with someone having a panic attack non the less my period can do one :(
I'm also having an unusual series of periods. I still haven't got it, but I'm already bloated, I'm super hungry all the time, and I've been feeling depressed for a few weeks. And that's weird cause I never had mood changes before due to my period. I don't understand why this changed. Can your body just change like that even if you haven't done anything different in your lifestyle? As for the pill, I don't feel comfortable taking it, so I just don't :) To me it feels too artificial and I'm not a big fan of hormonal treatments (anyway, that's just what I do myself, of course, I think everyone should take their own decisions on that and that it's ok other people decide to take them).
I was recommended Yasminiq when I was 16 and still take it to this day. I took a pill break from october-november 2016 to february 2017 and I got the WORST CYSTIC ACNE. It just wouldn’t go away and I didn’t want to leave my house because it looked terrible and my face hurt.\nI know a girl in the UK whose doctor told her she should take breaks every three months? But my doctor said that I could just take my pill forever? I don’t know what to believe.
I've been recommended to double pack my pill by many doctors because of my horrendous period pains (endometrosis) never once been told its unsafe.
You'd be surprised by how many people are actually yeast intolerant instead of gluten. It also might be worth seeing if you're intolerant to Malt - as it's in beer, but only some breads and cereals. You could get an intolerance test done from a nutritionist outside of the NHS and it really helps! Saves time with all the trial and errors of eating certain foods each month! :)
Deep shades of lipstick look so good on you compared to just Dabbing on colour
About the food/diet thing, I'm suffering with IBS, which involves things such as bloating and feeling sick after eating. (Relatable to your symptoms)\nAt the moment I'm doing a diet called the Fodmap diet which is of course meant to help with the symptoms but the main goal is to find out what food triggers you by trying several categories of foods and keeping a diary. I've only started a couple of days ago, so I'm still very new at this but I thought of the diet immediately when you mentioned the foods that might or might not trigger you. It might not be useful for you at all but it is worth to google :)
I used to be on a combined pill that needed a 7 day break and it was horrible. The pain was unbearable (cramps) and I became depressed and also very angry. Kept lashing out at my family and then boyfriend. Changed over to the 30 day pill and I'll never look back. I don't have the same problems anymore, rarely any mood swings (my mood levelled out) and it helped calm me down and rarely any pain \nTrust your instincts on this stuff your body will tell you when it doesn't agree with something
I'm 23 and I've always had a really irregular period ever since I can remember. When it came, it wasn't too painful, it was ordinary length and everything, but there were months when it just didn't come. Once when I was maybe 16 or 17, there was an entire year when my period just disappeared, although I'm pretty sure that was due to the death of my brother which occured around that time. Now I finally did go to the doctor and I got a pill, I just started taking it, so I'm really hopeful that it will help me having regular, on-point periods again. If anything, it's really making me more focused and helps me feel a lot better, I've been down lately, but I've been much more balanced since taking it. Fingers crossed it'll work on the long run! :)
I feel like the pill is messing up my hormones or is it my mental health. I really don't know :/
I take Gedarel, as I was taken off Ridgevidon after my face broke out and I had lots of chest pain. It definitely cured the spots but the chest pain has got slightly better but hasn’t gone entirely. However, I’ve noticed that with this pill my mood is lower generally, and my libido/sex drive is non-existent which is very frustrating for my partner. I think I will be going back to the doctors soon to see what can be done.
I have been on Yasmin for 7 years without a break. I have no bad side effects and everything seems normal and manageable (3 day light periods, no pain, no acne, no bloating and minimal PMS). That said - I'm worried I could be hiding my true self! What if I came off the pill one day and no longer loved my husband?! Wondering if I should TRY another pill just to see... or, should I not kill a good thing?
Period day 3 still living just about
My implant is really messing with me, and I should go to the doctors, but I feel like male doctors don't really understand, which puts me off, annoying because my first implant was great
My brother has a yeast intolerance so it's very possible that you could be allergic to that. He also lives in London where yeast alternatives are a lot more available for things like yeast free soy sauce and suchlike :)
I can relate to so many of these pill problems. Taking the pill was just not the right thing for me. I used to get headaches that were out of this world, and it was every time during my pill break (so essentially my period) without fault. I knew that two days after going on a break I couldn't schedule anything with friends because I would be in bed with all the lights out and no sound whatsoever. Now since I am off the pill and using a non-hormonal way for birth control I am so much happier. I can't recommend it enough to try and go without hormonal birth-control for a while, it's so much better for your body and your mind (I used to be an emotional mess whilst on the pill, now I'm totally fine)!
See im on Microgynon and have been for over a year and it really agrees with me so far compared to the 3 others ive been on. But i really wanna come off and try the contraceptive app, but my partner doesnt like condoms. EH. LIFE OF A WOMAN.
every time i watch her videos i feel so peaceful inside <3
You do make me consider going to the doctors to try another pill... Even if its just to see what it would do to me Hahaha
I mean your aesthetic is just goals
The food thing may also be fermented foods? All GI doctors get you to do the FODMAP diet, I'm sure you've heard of it. Maybe talk to your doctor about giving that a go? Kombucha is also fermented fruits and stuff hence why I suggested the FODMAP diet. It helps narrow down which food group it is x
a book i read about nutrition told me to find out for myself what i'm intolerant to and how differents food affect my body (cutting stuff out, trying new foods, etc) it's a looong road but i'm willing to try it 🙌🏻
Also, I couldn't recommend enough picking up the book A Mind of your Own by Kelly Brogan. At least look her up on facebook or on her website
This video came at the right time! I have really heavy, really painful, super irregular period and I've been trying to research what kind of pill would help me. The thing is, my mom is against it. It's already been more than five years since my first period (it'll be six in April) and they've been getting progressively worse. This last period, I woke up twice at night because of the pain. And I was on a heating pad! I've been having to take two Aleve and an ibuprofen in the morning, then another ibuprofen at lunch or when I get home. I'm just tired of my super heavy periods and want some relief.
I'm having a very similar experience right now! I've been on rigevidon for about 8 months now, but starting in May, I began to have anxiety attacks about once every 2 weeks or so, normally in the evenings. Recently they've been happening way more often, and this period it's happened three days in a row. I know that rigevidon has caused similar anxiety symptoms in a lot of other women so I'm thinking of swapping to a lower oestrogen pill!
This was lovely to watch, especially as I'm on my period too! You're the only person I know of who has tried Cilest, it was the first pill I tried and I was on it for 3 years and the only reason I stopped was because it stopped effecting my periods and I just had irregular periods anytime instead of during my week break. I then went on Cerazette I think (mini pill) and I was on it for 2 weeks and it made me suicidal so I came off it and my GP was horrible about it but this was the same GP who didn't believe me when I came to her for help with anxiety and depression. I went on another combined pill for a while and then ended up back on Cilest and eventually on a cheaper version of it at the moment! I get awful PMS too I hate myself on my period. I get so forgetful, very irritable and impatient but also mega tired and I either want to eat everything or nothing. I can't believe some of the things doctors have said about the pill, taking two pills at once sounds mental! \nI take my pill 2 months at a time and then I have a week break because during the week break I get bad migraines and my mental health gets really bad so I try to avoid having a period every month and doctors have said it's okay to do it the way I'm doing it. I love watching videos about this stuff, I love talking about contraception and sexual health because it's a personal thing that I don't tend to discuss as most of my friends are on the implant and all tell me I should get it but no thank you 😂
I have a hormone imbalance. Probably have pcos due to most of the woman in my mums side having it. I started at 11. It was irregular, fairly light but very bad cramps. I have ibs so that interfered. After a year my period got heavier, began my descent into anxiety and depression, cramps got worse, acne EVERYWHERE other than my face lol. Gained an obscene amount of weight. I left my school and moved to a much better one. Two kinds of pills later I’m on sertraline and an anti acid with no pill. My periods are back and batter ish. I used to have them for 2weeks to 8weeks and now they’re exactly 7 days and only very very heavy for 2days. Zelest was great as it removed my periods completely but due to gaining weight I couldn’t take it. I went on the single hormone which really didn’t work. Bit babbly but you get the picture. Much happier now, still fighting my weight but I’ll get there. Ly girl - starting conversations from day one xxx
i read a historic book and suddenly started to cry...yeah hormons are great
I swear A LOT on my period and I'm so emotional
I love these type of videos.
I don’t understand why you put so much god damn emphasis??? on using cruelty free make up but you still but from shops like H&M? Like??? Why don’t you care about your clothes being cruelty free? I don’t... understand??
I’m on the pill Marvelon to help my skin and my period pain and my skin is incredible, I went from having acne to completely clear skin but my period pain is awful.. I accidentally doubled a pill this month when I was hungover (no idea why) and I’ve started my period early, usually I start on exactly the same day on my break week, but I am in agonyyyy, I need a pill that fixes my skin and my pain🤦🏼‍♀️ loved this video! X
I believe I have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. I also have really heavy, long and painful periods so that I cry from the pain and everything it is not a good time
I have REALLY bad cramps on my period, but I've just gone on the  rigevidon pill. I've just had my first period on the pill and I had NO CRAMPS!!!! I was the happiest person on the planet, so that's my story 😊
i’m on yasmin too!! i’ve been on a few different ones after suffering from intense cystic acne and yasmin with antibiotics has worked a treat but i’m so terrified of when i decide to come off it and get bombarded with it again!!
After 6 years on the pill, most recent being Desogestrel, I decided to come off it altogether. I feel liberated 👍👍 could not deal with the constant flat moods and not really giving a shit about anything - good or bad. Now I watch adverts and cry when i think theyre emotional looool SUCCESS
I've had the ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel pil since I was 14. As far as I know it's been working for the last 5 years.
I don't think the issue is lack of training, but due to lack of research. Obviously research is being done, but how much of it by men? How much of women's health issues have been dictated, researched, etc. by men? And how many medications given to men for certain ailments are also given to women even if no research was done on women? There's a book written on the topic and I have no idea what it's called. \nBut this video is making me want to go back into Biology.
I was on cilest, and it was awful for me! I was so angry and so hormonal and irritated. I changed to rigevidon, which has caused no side effects and I'm thrilled! Just goes to show, it is completely dependent on each and every body. Don't just listen to what has/hasn't worked on your friend. We're all unique!
Here in Norway many doctors give you Yasmin to start off with, so I got that. It made me really down. I am normally a very happy go lucky person but on Yasmin i was almost sad. It took me a while to realize it, but when I did - swithing it made all the difference. Now I'm using Loette and have no side-effects. Well, right now I'm not using any pill, because I'm pregnant :) But I have been really happy and feeling like myself after switching pills!
I used Yasmine for my acne for about 6months and it did clear up my acne but when I got off it...my ance was worse than ever and I felt really bad in my skin. Now I'm off the pill and I'm looking for a non-hormonal way to not get pregnant haha! Hopefully some day the man-pill will come out...
ugh, periods are awful. for the first years of my period i only got like 2 or 3 in a whole year. I tried birth control but I have severe anxiety and depression and it just fucked me up so I gave up on that totally. Then a weird thing happened where i just started CONSTANTLY bleeding. like 4 months on. straight. tried birth control again and again it completely fucked up my anxiety and depression so i decided id rather bleed FOREVER than go completely insane. Then they found a huge cyst on one of my ovaries, the size of a fucking melon. SO had surgery and my periods seemed to get a little better, until i started bleeding forever again. THIS TIME my doctor was like 'listen, let's just give you a birthcontrol bill with no estrogen that we give new mothers who are breast feeding, really low dose of hormones.' I agreed and now I HAVE A MONTHLY PERIOD.\n\nCelebratioooooon.\n\nOf course the down side is that now I have 'typical' period things. I get really really emotional and cry a lot, I want all the sweets, I get terrible cramps and just lay in bed moaning and ranting about how unjust life is. Who cares. It is magic. MAGIC I TELL YOU.\n\nNow I just need to make up all the iron I lost when I was bleeding CONSTANTLY. Apparently blood loss really fucks with a person.
I have never used a hormonal pill however I do take a herbal supplement which has been LIFE CHANGING! I used to get the most intense cramps, back and leg pain as well as severe nausea and fainting episodes, every month! I had tried anti nausea pills from the doctor but they weren't always effective and did nothing for my mood swings and menstrual cramps. I visited a homeopathic clinic and ended up starting on 'agnus castus', a herbal supplement which balances my hormones throughout the month. It basically stops the huge build up of hormones on the first day of my period which was causing my body to go a bit mental! This literally cured me and if I remember to take my supplements everyday I can have almost no symptoms whatsoever - even less painful symptoms like breast tenderness has almost diminished! I know it sounds hippie and alternative and unlikely to work, but I have found the natural way far more effective than anything I have ever been prescribed. Homeopathy treats the underlying condition whereas, in this case with my periods, conventional medicine was just trying to treat the symptoms. I am now in the position where the symptoms do not occur. The only down side is you do have to pay for it however my supplements are about £9 a bottle and I only use up about 3 per year so it's a small cost for the amazing benefits I receive. I really cannot recommend it enough!
you seem like helena bonham carter
Love ❤️ your videos!
Youre hair!' 😍
microgynon fked me up
Mmmm another GRWM? Feed me I need more Lucy
shit.
'Best' pill for hormonal acne?
It might be barley
girl theres gluten in beer
The first pill i was put on made me bleed constantly (which was ironic since it makes a lot of women's periods stop completely). I didn't realise for a while that it was also making me slightly depressed. Once i was changed onto a different pill i felt so much better, i can't even describe it. My periods are still a tad irregular but they're getting there

I am 60 and watch you both
OMG YESSS! I'm so sick of every youtube channel being targeted to children and everything being censored and bleeped or not spoken about. I'm 20 years old and i struggle so hard to find people I relate to. and often even when I watch youtubers my own age, they still target their videos to children and do 'back to school crap and how to make friends etc. I was overcome with joy when louise did that big video about changing her channel and I think more people need to!!
Why wasn't Louise invited to the Janya wedding, tho?
The day Louise made the video announcing the change in her channel I hit subscribe so fast! I was so excited! Love when youtubers are genuine!
Are his comments moderated? =\
I started watching YouTube when I was 16, and I’m now 23. I’d say I grew up with some of you.
Louise I honestly think your a great role model cause I'm 16 and you show people like me that life isn't all butterflies and sparkles and things happen and they might not all be ideal or what you have planned but that's just how it is and I really like that cause I'm definitely not perfect and I wouldn't idolise someone that is in my eyes I want someone like me. In my eyes someone that isn't perfect and that has relationship problems or that has mental health problems there perfect too me cause they are showing there real them and not hiding anything. Well that's my opinion anyways :-)
I completly agree with Louise about not deleting her pictures, my mom also died when I was a kid and I would have loved to have more pictures of her, good thing about social media, you may have very embarassing pictures but in the future either you or any other person would to anything to remember those moments
Enjoyed this video... you two are hilarious but insightful! Would love more of this...
I got divorced, met a man on tinder and got pregnant YES YES YES LOUISE I LOVE YOU
Considering what kids are watching on TV now, I hardly think a little bit of swearing in a YouTube video is damaging! 😂
I love you two so much, for what it's worth - you're both good role models x
On the topic of changing your content, i actually find that i'm more likely to stay subscribed to a channel if there content grows up purely because i've grown up too :)
the music is too loud
Okay, honestly, my favorite video of yours. Maybe ever? ❤️
I do RE at a catholic school and we are taught to believe that Genesis (Adam and Eve story) isn't actually true, and is just a metaphor for how powerful God is
I was not the one that lost it LOL
Jim gives me the fucking creeps he's like an overgrown 12 year old
Awe!! You all are so great!! Her hair is so pretty!!
I like to think of myself as a realistic christian Louise I don't think I've related to you more than when you were talking about religion.
it's like two work colleagues forced to work together
I’m 20. Should I ask my mom if I can watch this? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously kidding.
Ahhh I want a friendship like Louise and Jims :)
Im a Christian and I believe God created the Earth and everything in it, in all its sciency goodness. Im not the only one, theres tons of Christian scientists. Be open minded about it, you will be surprised by your own wrong misconceptions.
I am not a Christian, but if you don't take the 6 days of creation literally and assume a 'day' means a different length of time, the story is actually in the same order of creation as evolution.
Love both of your channels, Louise more so since her content changed. I've just turned 27 and always felt too old to watch some but you two have always been my favourites regardless. As you've both grown, I have too. Watching the two of you together is hilarious!
I started watching Louise more after the end of an era. I loved her more whilst she was being herself- i could sense she wasn't truly being herself in videos before that. Love you Louise!!!
Hi everyone,\nThis you tuber is trying to raise $50,000 for 10 Cancer Patients. Please donate if you can, thanks so much: https://www.gofundme.com/luckielifestyle\nHis Youtube Channel is: Luckie Lifestyle
Three Men and a Little Lady! Fave film 😍
What does 'lowering the tone' mean? I'm in the dark here...
omfg the background music is so distracting, its like fake laughter in tv shows pls stop
I love that the content changes because we can grow with you and watch the creator make the cc content they want to create. It feels more natural x
This video looked so awkward. Jim does not seem to be on the same page/feel comfortable throughout this entire video...
Jim, most Christians don't believe evolution and Christianity conflict...
Threw everyone I watch from Zoe all the way to Shane Dawson my mom has watched a least one video of ever YouTuber I watch. She has never complained about what they have been talking about especially how foul of a mouth Shane has. She realizes now they have all made me the person I am , she loves them all as well. She never once made me stop watching someone and it really helped our relationship and made it stronger with how much she trusted me. I just wish some parents would understand that , I'm not one myself...but it really helps the child trust me.
Aww I’ve missed these two together! 😁
Same thoughts re: evolution and Christianity.  Love Louise ❤️❤️
Irrelavant to the video but what lipstick does louise have on?
You look particularly handsome in this video Jim 😁
Was shookt when Louise said that Darcy was 6 years old!!! All I remember is itty bitty toddler Darcy 🙊
I THINK THAT the only reason why Loise wasnt invited to the wedding is bcos of Tanya...
Pretty woman? The film??
my name is Jim too HAHA
Oh😍 Jim you are so handsome!
i love the film louise was talking about Talladega nights : Ballad of Ricky Bobby <3
See, the two of you touching on religion has made me want to see a video purely talking about faith and religion. Especially as you have a degree on the same subject. Xx
I really enjoyed you talking to each other even more than answering the questions - especially the take on being a realistic Christian and mature content. Good stuff.
Dear louise, \n                             I think you are a great role model. You might of made some bad choices but you are still inspirational because you have managed to make a life out of your situations. You now have a beautiful daughter so keep bing louise\nXx
Honestly I cannot focus with the music in the background. Maybe it's just me but it drives me mad
The vast majority of Christians believe in evolution. Religious truth and scientific truth have the same source and therefore cannot contradict each other.
Is the thing Louise said at the start monsters Inc. Xx love you guys
I'm 12 and I watched the lost condom video lol
On the science/Christian thing - my brother is a ‘scientist’ (degree in science and science nerd) and he’s a devout Christian - preaches a lot etc. I think it’s all about being open minded and tolerant of everything. \n\nGreat video guys :-) you’re awesome!
I totally forgot I added a question and just for the fun of it I watched this video, finding out you answered my question! How cool is that! Thank you lots and lots for the answer and for turning it into a conversation about porn, hahaha. Ohh and Jim, you pronounced my name best! It's difficult, I know. Just say it as you read it! Much love again, Sjarlie!
I'm glad your content has matured. I started watching you when I was 16 and I'm 20 now so I've been able to grow up with your content.
Science was originally designed to prove christianity. Just because it has gone on to prove the theory of evolution it doesn't and shouldn't effect a persons belief in any religion.
Music is too loud and beat-ey
Jim 😂🙈😂 14:33 ahaja poor Louise \nmaybe subscribe. but if you don't want to don't omg
It’s so refreshing to see a Christian believe in something other than Adam and Eve, yet the way you explained it as thinking Adam and Eve is a metaphor is brilliant. It doesn’t belittle  the belief of Adam and Eve, but puts a reasonable sensible thought process to it.
You two are so funny together
Louise, I always thought you were younger than me, but we're the same age.
i don't think the adam and eve story was meant to be like a direct description haha. most ppl take the view that the seven day creation thing is a v brief description of millions/billions of years of evolution. and the adam and eve story is to serve a purpose of telling the story of original sin and it explains well why the world can be bad. most christians believe that a lot of the bible consists of stories/metaphors that tell us something abt God. my idea of science is that is doesn't contradict religion at all, science is the study of God's creation! ^*^
JIM What hairdryer do you use, do you use it everyday, what hair product/s do you use and do you style your hair everyday?
Eminem ripping Trump a new one isn't on the trending list, but this total garbage is......
the movie is Angus thongs and perfect snogging
That end bit about subscribing to Louise made me laugh so hard.
Louise and Jim are the best combination, neither of you beat around the bush with what you're saying and I love it!
Jim, you definitely have the gift of gab (a great asset for you).When are you and Tyler doing another collaboration?
What was the movie was Louise talking about?
I am proud for  my family to watch Jims channel.  He is a sweetheart and  very real, not like the others who put on airs and  fake
When Louise and Jim were trying to call people my phone started ringing 😂
Would watch Jim and Tan in anything xxx such good videos!!!❤
this is the best video
Is it bad , im 14 and i watch louises videos X
The ad on this video was your book on audible lol xx
I get my book tomorrow!!! So excited!
Louise has lost a good bit of weight go her
Subscribed to Louise after this. :)\nI looked at her channel AGES ago after a collab with Zoe or someone and didn't much like it but I guess that must have been towards the end of the old era. I like her stuff more now. Glad to have had her brought to my awareness again.
Right......... adult Q&A \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlet’s watch it anyway
I'm 14 you are both amazing role models! You make me happy! You make me less anxious! Your both great
the music was fucking annoying - clicked off
I haven't watched Jim in years. I found the desperate to be a children's tv presenter vibe just too much.  Happy Louise has made a  reintroduction happen.
HAHAH I want to hear Louise's story about losing the condom, anyone know which video that is??
I started my YouTube channel to get comfortable in front of a camera, I went to an acting school for tv and movies, and we were in front of cameras doing audition practice. So it was a way for me to get used to that. Now I love it!
Louise, my dad died when I was young. I think all the time about how in the future my kids will be able to watch my videos because I would have loved to have something like this of my dad. Im sorry about your mom, but I’m glad to know I’m not the only one who thinks about this
Love how real you both were in this, there should definitely not be more videos like this out there. X
Louise looks gorgeous! xx
Jim deserves more views.
When Harry met sally!!
Love Talladega Nights.
:))) lol
It's Madagascar 3!
PART 2 !!!!!
Beaches #9glitterpoints
Love Louise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Have you ever tried this adult dating site?

ha-OKyNiHNE,\nhttps://t.co/A5hfDGuBWx
i'm not going to leave one of those mediocre comments saying 'oh i wish that they were all close like they were a few years ago' because the reality is, they've all found their path in life now. some, successful authors and others working in the fashion industry. ultimately, i'm so proud of all of them. they're all doing their thing, and are smashing it. well done 'old crew' of youtube <3
I really think you should stop swearing
I am 10 years old and I watch both of them
comment who u think got man of the match i go for w2s
I thought there would be more skills... oh well
tekkers biggest mistake: having Gerrard on the team. they just put bad luck on themselves
If billy was playing they would have won
Gerrard is the man of the match
Good game lads...Robbie savage is sooo entertaining to watch, gotta love him. Best quote of the day regarding one of the keepers, he should be playing for Donald Trump coz he's a wall.   LOL
Who else remember the first ever Wembley cup😂😂😂😂
Why didn't Joe Waller play? Is he hurt too?
Weller didn't even play... Why did he take his top off?
I hope tekker town win
I was there
Hugh was seriously a let down
(._.)\n<,︻╦╤─ \n_/﹋\_███████ ]▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▃\n▂▄▅█████████▅▄▃▂  bbbooooommm
I t h o u g h t    T e k k e r z  to w n  w e r  e g o i n g   Win
For anybody saying they could NOT see Tekkers Towns defense then Liverpools defense doesnt exist.😂
Next year the legend is Theo Heiny
It is boring when spencer fc/hashtag united always win like if you agree😊😊😊
steven gerrard says next year??? mate this is not liverpool chasing the premier league lol
If billy wingrove played earlier he would have knocked in at least 4
The commentators just hate each other don’t they 😂😂😂
I think they should host one of the games here in Houston Texas
Stuart Pearce losing a game as a manager? Where have we seen this before...
What's the song called  when the commentary said that ksi intressed
Tekkers was so op but still got destroyed
If billy was on for Cutting, Tekkers prolly could have won or tied
Hope ksi don't make a disstrac about tekkers city
This is unfair: you take a team that has already play a lot of games togheter and that is really fit and then a team that has never played togheter and are really unfit and then play against each other. of course the fit team is going to win and if you think that legends will help then no ok some of them were fit still but many of them were not so the legends will also not really help. Plus you obviously need a professional coach and do some training because everyone got tackled who ever got the ball and when some one was open no one else opened up so it was very hard to pass it is just un fair it is the same as real madrid and tekkers town played togheter un fair also the others from hashtag who were off camera during the challenges were obviously training togheter
kieran brown really bad on the pitch should stay with his tricks and freestyle
Why does lynch never use his skill
Hashtag only won because billy was injured
commentary was on another level! hope you guys do it also next year! thanks for the laughs! oh, and the game was ok too
Anyone can tell me the score so I don’t have to watch the whole thing
Hi everyone can you check out my little boys football channel if you like subscribe thank you
Did joe Weller come on?
I mean gerrard
Crawford sucks
Gerrard never nasty...just stamped on Herrera that one time after being on the pitch for 1 min ;)
does anybody else get annoyed by geordie sometimes? something about him idek.
David James just isn't a legend, always been shot and still is now hahaha
Crappy defensive side for tekkers. Absolutely no chemistry and fitness for tekkers. This isn’t right 😡😡😡
why cant the amazing freestylers like daniel cutting and sian garnier and jezza just dribble through the whole team and score like they do in their videos
+F2Freestylers - Ultimate Soccer so funny when there was a pen for jezza and he was so serious when he scored but then he was like, this is just my job
Please do a Highlights video like last year.
david JAMES as they call him in spain lmao lawrence u dumbass lol haha funny mfkrs
Just finished highschool but already makes more money then you
If tekkers town had a single legend in defence this game would've been very different.
Geordie looking smart once a year for the wembley cup. 😊
without a doubt the commentary made this
Came and stayed for the commentary
I think Elliot let Team Tekkers down the whole game.
I went to the Match
As much as I'd like it to be true, William Gallas never won a World Cup.
country music these days is awful , I enjoy Billy currington  ,but I don't care about the others. our 1990s n 1980s music will not be played again unless there's a station that just plays the older music . it's too bad too, it took away a lot of good music!!!! if we have CDs of our favorites, then we can listen to them . but I think there should be a good amount of the older country played. the 1980s& 1990s really had a lot of good country. music worth listening to.!!.
Yo, I haven't exactly payed the attention i should've. Can anyone tell me why Billy ain't playing?
KSI and Joe Weller on the same team lol.
Don't know who I would prefer as a defence out of Liverpool's defence or tekkerz town's defence
is scott allowed to have that bottle......
They should make a tournament  with teams Facebook youtube twitter and istagarm
Geordie and Laurence's commentary was golden, had me laughing all game.
Seb is such a try hard haha and it doesn’t work.
Brain and Lawrence managed to make this game incredibly entertaining 😂
How much did Spencer pay the F2???
Hashtag united sucks
Heskey time
chrismd :/
My Bad 14.34
Yes hashtag
There both Sunday leeeeagueee
On the bench, Theo Barker! Not Baker, Barker. :D
Houst, Tx
I miss this!!!! Noo
Hashtag should sign jeremy lynch and billy wingrove
Wingrove?
Theo Barker hahehe lol
Did
They speld Baker wrong
Gerrard ❤
Man True Geordie and Lawrence are to much!!😂😂😂
Anyone know the song that was played when they scored
What's the goal song called?
Who saw Jimmy Conrad pointing where jeremy was going when he was taking the penalty
I love spencer fc like if you agree
I focking love how k.s.i is in the same team as husky long time fans will get it hilarious.
Linesman should go in the kitchen and make me a meal
F**k this game
Pollock is quality
Aids :/

Theo Barker??
Tekers guru
It’s always hashtag
Wingrove?
Announcers only ##################

Heskey time
6-1 are you mad mate
Who won
The commentator who you talking about when referring to KSI... omg!!! Had me crying!!! You can tell he is old and doesn't follow today's celebrity's. 😂😂😂😂😂
That was no dam full wolf, \nthat was a wolf dog a husky mix morons.\n\nThat poor animal obviously \nHe was lost.
It’s probably dead by now... just saying
GOD HELP ME! I'm so tired of ppl being so overly sensitive when it comes to animals. Some of the same ppl that treat each other like crap😒
That's not a wolf. Wolves have long legs.
It's not a pet.you are food.
That is not a wild wolf. A wild wolf will not get near people. That is a pet chasing his family. This is a screwed up video. I own a 95% Wolf Dog. He is my second wolf dog. I have had these animals for over 20 years and was raised in the country around wild wolves. I call total BS on this video!!! I hope this is not a pet being dumped. If the wolf dog was done this way to make a video then the owners should be ashamed of themselves. Also the wolf dog could have been hit by another car.
Did you ever get rid of him/her
It was probably a line wolf thinking it had a huge kill
Why didn't you let him catch the car to see what he would do?
You should have stopped. Not like it's going to rip the doors off the car. It might have been someone's pet, and just wanted a ride.
Oh you idiots. Thats rowly. He is a very well known wild but friendly wolf. I remember the area in the video. Its in canada. Me an some friends heard of rowly an we went to find him an meet him. He is a super kool wolfie. An he loves deer jerky.
That wolf was tryna listen to Beyoncé on the radio
It may have been a pet. Please stop and check on it.
Wolf:  *There's a killer in the backseat! I repeat, there is a killer in the backseat!*\n\nAww, he's chasing us
Why would you not give him some food?
I would probably have thought that it was a lost dog and in a effort to help him I'd be immediately devoured.  😂
Idk o dont think thats a wild animal and if it isn't thats kinda fucked up if it's been left out there
Yep they just totally failed to help someone's lost pet.
this is not a grey wolf this is someknes let dog bops!!! and she's desperately still looking for him
Probably has rabies it's a wolf people come down cold be mixed with coyote
Hes Hungry and someone has thrown food to him in the past from a car. Hes so hungry hes hoping for a handout.
How did a Wolf get in a car?
Beautiful animal.. he was probably hungry and trying to score some handouts from you.  Lone wolves don't have an easy time out there.
lol they listening to 'say my name'
They should've stoped. He may have been asking for help.
Aww that's cute but scary at the same time...
Awe! He looks like he wanted to play!
Whoa! That is cool, but one question: why was the wolf chasing the car?
Why wouldn't you stop for it? It clearly wasn't hostile, and as long as you kept your doors shut you would have been safe!
😓 It didn't occur to you to stop the car, crack the window, and give a quick whistle or pucker to check the reaction of the animal? If it came up to you car willingly with a friendly approach, it may have been someone's lost pet. This looks like a Malamute, without a doubt. Way too road friendly and even the way it runs is slightly more domesticated than the run of a wild wolf.
He looks so addorable, why dont you get off and pet him
I would have pulled over and pet him
That looks like a beautiful husky mix.  Must be lost.  I would have stopped to see if it came whimpering up to the window wagging it's tail like a lost dog before giving it that kind of chase, and on a desolate highway! How stupid. Could have caused a major accident
wtf is wrong with this family
Why are they not just driving off he could get hit by truck!
i think people have fed that before not the people making the video but someone who might have seen the wolf on the side of the road and thrown food out the window to him
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂that wolf almost got them😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh man....I'd have stopped and given him a ride. He acts like a tame wolf who's lost. I'd have him sleeping on my bed.
This is some Bull Sh**!! Those animals don't just follow you.
that wolf is sick of being in the wild. he wanted a home.
The Wolf wants a home 😢😭
That’s a Siberian Husky...Wolves are wayy bigger. Why would a wolf chase a car in the first place? That was someone’s pet for sure.
probably a pet you idiots. get out much?????
0:30 shows how smart they are and also I'm sure they wanted y'all to hop out and say hello and good bye sense you are just driving by there territory of I am correct and or they wanted a ride some were
Who seen the collar tag a 0:07 that's there dog and then listen to wat there are saying
Fuckers should of atleast threw some food out for making it run so far
That's a Husky, not a wolf.
he must have been fed by people in the past.  no other reason to keep following you .
Pissed on the floor one to many times.
I would let him in my car tbh..
That was crazy! Could have at least stopped and gave the poor dog water.....
Help the poor fella , he needs help
Can somebody take this video off of You tube.  This poor dog wanted these idiots to help him.  Take this video off.
That looks like my dog.
i hope this happens to me for some stupid reason....C:
This looks exactly like my sweet ranger who I got as a stray. It breaks me
If he's a dog where is his collar? Hope it wasn't a dog. 😢 i would hate to think it was lost
they dumped that dog. it was a mix wolf. it was chasing them down. it did not wabt to be lwft behind.
This is sad,he seems hungry.I would have thrown out my middle child.I wont part with my first born or the baby but the awkward middle one would make a good sacrifice.
something is not right about this video.... it made me sad for some reason
Hes warning about the future serial killers
Why wouldnt one stop? See what the wolf would of done. So few if any man and animal encounters like that in life.
I would  have  had to  stop  and see  what the issue was.
PLOT TWIST: Little Red Riding hood is in the car.
It was a Hybrid. Trying to get a ride home! Probably the Sadistic Family in the cars pet!
That's a tame wolfy wanting back in the car, someone dropped em off
😓 this is what happens when people feed wolves... Then they think the cars will always feed them and will eventually get hit. Happened to kujo! Can happen to these poor mutts
HE JUST WANTS TO PLAY
That looks like a tamed dog maybe he wanted help lol
These people sound like straight air heads
You can tell that this wolf has been raised by someone and it just wanted to connect with these people.
Click bait! Wolf is not in a car.
He's looking for a pack. Humans a compatible with Canines do to the fact we have the same hierarchy. He was ran out of a pack and left to fend for himself. that is the way of the wolf pack.
I live around 10 minutes away from radium bc,  Ive often seen wolves in the park. and on occasion they have been known to chase cars. people feed them on the highway. this is what happens. its unfortunate
He just wanted to rip her face off and eat the children.. Why did t they stop to take selfies o\nWith the wolfen
That was a Siberian Husky, not a wolf. He was well groomed and is more than likely someone's lost pet, looking for his owner.  He may have been dumped and your vehicle could be the same as his owner's.  What type of vehicle were you driving and around what area was this. We need to send  people to the area to try to locate this dog.
Its  a  pet,  not  a  wild wolf, frolicking,  perhaps  looking for a  human to  feed,  love
Probably hungry because of all the tweeker poachers...just sayin
Reincarnated lost relative
Agree it must have been someone's pet! Unrealistic demeanor for wild animal.
Bisdaka diay :)
Aww
Wow
What the actual fuck i wrong with the comment section? Idiots saying the family should have gotten eaten for some mangy animal that's worth a dime a dozen? Who really cares whether or not it's a wolf or an abandoned pet? And how do any of you know the family fed it? Deers run out into traffic becaue their stupid, if you think a dog is any different for chasing a large, moving vehicle then you have problems. It's probably covered in fleas, stinks and would rip your throat out without giving it a second thought. For everyone saying the family with the child should have stopped and petted the random, dangerous animal, do everyone a favor and go do this yourself. People like you don't need to breed.
Poor dog
heart breaking
Thats really sad
Bisaya di ay ka!lol
Oh My Goodness 😍🐺❤️
Such a majestic boy
So cute, wolves are awesome
Where this at
Mga bisaya
Fuckin asshole people
malamute
Oh damn
Filipinos
cooooooooool
You and your family do have my sympathy for having to deal with all these crude, evil and generally stupid people in your comment section. Anyone expecting any of you to exit the vehicle and approach a wild, potentially dangerous animal is frankly just insane. I, unlike everyone else it seems, read the full description of the video and know that there was no service in your area at the time to calling the park service or anyone else for that matter to try and aid the _possibly_ lost animal. There was nothing you could have done save for just driving away quickly. True, I suppose you could have tried to get the attention of a passing driver for help but honestly, what could they have done either? Not many people would be willing to drop everything they are doing to assist strangers who are trying to assist a wolf/dog without knowing what its intentions really are. And believe me when I say *nobody* knows what this animal really wanted. There are a dozen reasons why it could look happy, wagging its tail and chasing your car. Even if you put it in your car what assurance would you have had that it would not simply attack?
poor wolf dog it probably want some love and attention
It's crazy this made me really think and a lot of his issues weren't drugs, it was him handling the stresses of life. Grant it he didn't have a great start with drugs but if you listen closely you'll see. my college coaches taught me how to drink detox everyone thought i was a junkie, so i said eff it. It seems that was obviously his coping mechanism but no one helped this man, not even himself. To change you really gotta tear down the whole thing so you can rebuild. Everyone was giving him a quick fix, even himself. He looks great now and ability wise he's been a top tier talent. Hopefully he gets reinstated
hope he come back to the browns
let the man play!
blaming coaches .... he is blaming other ppl.. he will relapse soon
I hope he comes back and is better than he ever was. God Bless You Josh Gordon!
You got this Josh. YOU can make it! And we still want you in Cleveland. You have the fans behind you.
he had the shakes in the interviews from drinking and drugs the nerve damage --wow
The Browns need you.
Marijuana actually is probably rather helpful to NFL players.
The sane human inside me loves to see his growth. The Ravens fan however hates the fact he may be back on the field.
We love you here in CLE Josh
Go Browns!
At the end of the day he has no one to blame but himself, there are plenty of people who came from rough neighborhoods but decided that drugs were not for them, and that they wanted to make something of their life. It isn't like Josh Gordon did not have second, third and fourth chances, because he has had plenty of chances. I say he will never play for the Browns again and probably will never play in the NFL Again.  He made the Commissioner look like a fool when he reinstated him during the 2016 Training Camp, because ultimately Gordon chose drugs over the NFL.
I still cant believe a guy that smokes weed is being punished more than abusers and animal killers. Vick is on tv as an ANALST! A fucking analyst, that we look at and listen to in hope to gain some perspective. Think about that and look at Josh. I get what he is going through too. I can smoke weed once a month and never need anything else, but it stays in your system so long you get your fix through more harmful ways like alcohol to not get in trouble. With that said and we literally look at people around us, if he is such a drug addict how can he be so healthy? The NFL is wrong for doing this, the suspensions only make situations like this worse fir the individual. His legal problems are fixed faster than his NFL problems. Unless there is a performance enhancement issue/violence then the NFL should stay out of it and support it's own assests. ☝
Now all he needs is to get out of Cleveland
Him talking about his dad is so sad. He still loves him and hasn't even talked to him for 12 years.
Really proud of the work you have done big guy, can't play ping pong though!!
He’s a beast, the browns need him back and hope he can stay clean. At 26 he has a lot of good football left In him
Why do we have to listen to Steven A Smith coon ass before his interview? Did he intentionally want us to listen to the naysayers are what? Steven coon ass don’t have the right to be done with nobody but his own children if he have any?
And the Browns decided to draft that enabler piece of shit Manziel, who fed Josh more drugs. \n\nFucking dumbest franchise in all of sports.
arguably the most talented receiver I've seen not named randy moss
This man is a freak on the field. Hope he gets the chance to come back.
Let’s go falcons pick this man up just makes us that much better
Inspiring! Way to be a complete man, Josh. Time for you to put up over 200 back to back yards on your demons. You got this!
NFL time to give him another chance! Good luck JG
He must be broke now
This guy hasn't learned anything.  He doesn't need to be worried about football, he needs to be worried about his life and about his daughter that he has never met.  I guarantee that if he gets back on the football field and suffers a career ending injury, he will OD soon after if he doesn't get his head right.  Football is a privilege, not a right.
When life situations transcend sport and the game its related to ,... It reveals the most beautiful aspect of sports in general. Specifically in this all too common story of addiction. When a man is stripped of everything he loves and forced to confront his demons head on, its a defining moment that will break or rebuild his life, not just in his sport but his life as a whole. Josh Gordon speaks eloquently and direct about his experience so well thats it gives me hope that he can come back. I cheer for guys who can lose it all and fight their way back. Its a test of the human condition. Now that's a player and athlete i can root for.  -Eagles fan-
I’m rooting for you Flash! Keep working, get your life together and get back in the league!
Very powerful. A lot of these guys will lose their job and give up and give into the temptation that led them to lose everything in the first place. It’s good to see people make change from their past and give their all to right their wrongs. I hope I’ll see JG on the field soon.
Come back to Cleveland young man .
I have faith he'll stay clean. And once hes out, come to phi, the Eagles need you haha
What kind of camera does uninterrupted use ? Anyone know
This was awesome..See ya soon Flash..✌🏾
wish him the best i pray the brotha turns it around and heals himself football or not
Eli Manning needs you, the NY Giants need you #MakeItHappen 🙌🏾🏈
I failed this drug test because I was getting high... Thats a very mature answer, I like that.
Big Fan of Gordon!  Even more now listening to him and can see he trying whatever it take to change and step up to be a father. Hope Cleveland want to trade him. Jerry Jone need to watch this and trade a 1st round draft for him.   Best of luck to you J Gordon.
Hes from texas , of course he sippin lean 😂
Countdown waiting on you big dog stay on the path
The Bills need a receiver badly right now.  Hope he gets reinstated and they take a look at signing him.
trustingod
Dry told on baylor..
Give this guy a chance fuck wasting his potential
7:27  Anyone know who that is on the back of Gordon's hoodie?
Going through same things dui in 2014 and still going but this helps me maintain
Hope my Bengals call and give you a chance
Great job Josh! Awesome to see a positive story in today's world! Keep up what you're doing bro! My BEARS could DEFINITELY use you haha..
mannnnnn, i'll take him in New England in a heartbeat
they need to make a full documentary series of this guy
damn son, this more than weed
Still love you bro! Miner set back for a major come back
Wait so the schools help athletes violate ncaa policy? But I thought it was all about amateurism and education?
Carolina go get this guy🙏\n\n#Another chance\n#KeepPounding
ill believe it when I see it
So basically this is letting everyone know he’s going to the patriots next year
I failed the drug test because I was getting high. man this makes me change my opinion about him. hope he gets on the field soon. God knows the Browns need him
Good to see him working on him self ..
Bro holla at the giants we definitely need some help
Idk why but I get a Jon Jones vibe from this. I hope Josh leaves this behind and gets back to the league.
I'm praying for this young man to succeed. It should start with being a good person first.
I pray the Chicago bears get him 🐻
I believe in you bro, always have always will. You still have the chance to be the greatest ever. #JoshGordon
All the best to him, he seems like he's really taken some huge steps forward. I really hope it all works out for him, from people I know in my life this is incredibly tough to deal with.
His drug use never effected his performance from what I seen not encouraging it when your making millions of dollars but I am not worried about him not being the same at all he got help\nAt the right time never showed he was washed now all he has to do is stay clean.
Give him a couple million and he would f up again
I hope he can make it back in the league!
Somebody has to say it! - How long until he is traded to NE? ....
I believe in you J.G.\nI sincerely hope you can become a father. Be blessed.
I've have never seen a joint worth a million dollars
Can he play football next year?
He would’ve been on Julio, Odell, and Antonio’s level
Weed should just be cool with NFL. Since 90% of them have brain damage retiring
*i want my Bears to somehow get him* 🐻
Stay strong my brother we all make mistakes keep the grind up don't look back
Man he went around the streets, knocking on people’s door, asking random people where he could find weed. All he had to do was knock on my door. I would have directed him to Johnny Manziel’s Twitter page.

Prove em wrong!
ayeee shout out to Turbo Taylor
There is no detox drink that works as he described. Too bad this perennial failure has to try and attribute his mistakes to other people. I see no growth.
hope he gets a 2nd chance in the league.
Josh imma need the name of these detox drinks
Am I the only one who was sweating the guy might fail a drug test before I even finished the video?? Thats all nice talk, but dude only wants reinstated to make money. Hes never seen his baby but wants to be a father? I grew up with countless guys like him, buddies who would talk about getting their lives together but never would. Always excuses. He will never stay clean for long. It takes a certain kind of personalty to conquer substance abuse. He dont got it.
From a long time browns fan i truly believe Josh Gordon had all the god given talent to be a hall of fame wide receiver and in 2013 he had 1600+ receiving 9 td's and went to the pro bowl, this has to be the most talented person I have ever seen literally throw it away, in the future I wish him the best but I think he will regret the decisions he made later in life.
He had multiple chances but keep fucking up
Iv done all these drugs that he said he's done multiple times before and never got addicted , he doesn't have a problem he's just immature
He is an idiot. He has had so many chances already.
This is genius. I'm surprised I never thought of how good of a comparison this is. D.Va's my favorite overwatch hero and I love the Umaru-chan anime. Great video
That is SO CUTE! GG <3
Props to you. This is amazingly well done.
1:05 Mash those macros!
what's the outro song?\ngreat parody btw
GJ love it
Omg that just made my night, I'm super happy now ^_^ Like <3
Took a year... Not a very consistent year, shit was garbo
this is just everything <3 a combo of my favourite people <3
This is the best thing I've ever seen.\nI hope you do one for the second season now!
she's umaru chan but overwatch version of her
The best part is that Solider76 is Oni-chan. that alone got me SOLD!
Dude WOW it wasn't perfect but it was glorious hats off to you!
this is really good
I love it but the Doritos bag at 0:57 bothers me, lmao
This is the best thing I've ever seen thank you so much for making it!!!!!
U draw like a god, teach me masteeeeer '^'

Well, the cancer return
damn I need that umaru chan x dva images😍😍😍
Someone please give this man a medal
Thank you so much, I needed this in my life badly.
wow that as so well done! awesome work dude
This is why I live.
i've put off this anime for far too long. it's time to watch it
1 year spent well, ps if you didn't know this being put on Crunchyroll roll news, that's how I got here 👍
Holy shit. I almost feel like watching this anime just from this video
This is what actual perfection is. <3
this is awesome, really well done.
For some reason the lucio at 0:16 has me dying LOL
If pure perfection ever existed, this would be it
380 subs ?? man life is unfair ;__; i really love your work keep it up <3
So good, i love it
How did I end up here lol. Totally worth it tho.
THIS VIDEO SAVED ME. Great job!!!!! <3
They should hire you! :O
너무 사랑스러워😍😍
Ничего не понимаю,но это ОХУЕННО!!!
This is adorable
¡Genial! Love it!
FUCKIN AWESOME!!! Love it!!! =D
우마루 2기 재밌더라구요
Почему если автор считает если показать Dva няшной анимешной дурочкой то это будет  нормально? Этот опенинг же бессмысленный... Это может понравиться только гигнутым фанам ониме, но со взгляда нормального человека это такая срань...

0:18 Is that a zergling? :3
How about having Eddie Bravo on? He trains some top UFC/mma fighters and can promote EBI which is damn exciting for any bjj/mma fans. C'mon Ariel, show Edgy Brah some love.
Please make the into screen longer next time
MMA HOUR get Gegard Mousasi Fighting BELLATOR 185
Tony I went big bear Ferguson..
Tony just rambles on....lol....love that dude though!👊
Uncle Creepy spiraling...
Ariel is so cringe. Stop trying to psychoanalyse the fighters, you say the same thing about the fighters you interview being completely different people nearly every single time. You look for depth where it isn't there.
It is what it is
GooD To SeE HelwanI AnD CucuY BacK TogetheR <3
Ian McCall is such a garbage fighter. He should be happy that UFC let him stay this long.
When you get home from Taco Bell 2:56:54
Man Condit is such a good dude very under rated...that Maia fight was a disappointment but I feel Condit still causes problems for anyone would love to see Condit vs Cerrone Condit vs Woodley Condit vs Wonderboy\n\nHope he's well off, dude was doing medical stuff? Sounds like he hated it cant go from fighting in the UFC and being top 5 to work a regular day job. \n\nGet in the gym Carlos everyone knows grappling is your weakness work on it and destroy 170
Can we please not have Ian McCall on the show ever again. Would be great.
Ian mccall wants 100k to fight on the fight pass prelims lol Thats a Lil bit of a reach dawg
Show with sound begins @ 3:58
Tony's been writing a book? What's it called Cat? And then you open the book and there is a picture of a cat and an arrow with the word Cat in bold. Then you turn the page and its another type of cat with an arrow and the word Cat!.  Just 50 pages of that. I'd buy it.
Ian mccall is such a douche im gald he dont fight anymore
Ian McCall is transitioning into a woman.
Yes Ariel the pro Mcgreggor fans are very annoying. Good to hear I'm not the only one who can't stand them.
Tony the real champ
EL CUCUY!!!
Tony straight up Ferguson
NBK IS BACK!!!!
Ric: Who said it was the best sub?\nAriel: OHHHHHH MMYYYYY,,,\n\nHAHA favorite part is when Ariel and Ric just talk. Both actually understand and know what is happening.
every time a bigger name fighter has a bad weight cut.....OMG we need more weight classes.   because you know that will end bad weight cuts.   Forget all the factors that come into play.
theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee mixed martial arts hour back in. your llife.  same time same place same blababalal until then i say peace......im outta heeeeerre
The mighty wizz bar.. really?
Tony Absolutely Ferguson
Tony Ferguson rocks!
Caldwell breaking the record for most stoned guest of all time
lol @ ric thinking that push by GSP is real and that he's upset
Might need to re-upload this --- missing the sound first 4 minutes of Ariel talking :(
Was it muted in the first 4mim for everyone else too?
DJ and Max are class acts...
BOBBY GREEN. ON THE MMA HOUR ARIEL MAKE IT HAPPEN
Lol @020:28 StarTrek s***. - Demetrious Johnson. What a great analogy. Haha
Tony is the real champ, Conor is a paper champ !!! Lmao 😂
2:56:54 Excuse me!
slow day lets rattle conor fans... lol
too chinny for Conor
marissamal
Straight up
Too many politics in this episode. I get it though. But lets not make a habit of it!
Always good to hear from Frankie, also I agree Tony's demeanour seemed much more composed.
does Max have any idea how ridiculous he sounds when he speaks? Saying you know every 4 words makes you sound like a moron. I like Max, he's dope AF, just hard to listen to.
NY Ric better at pronouncing those names than Schaub is.
I thought it was supposed to be RICS PICS not Ariel criticizing every pick from Rick. Rics picks is all I watch cause Ariel is beginning to annoy me.
no audio for first 4 minutes???
Dis, is not a terapy session - Ian McCall's Skype connection.
Ian McCall wants loads of money to fight but can't actually fight cause his hand is jacked LOL
Tony needs to take a chill pill lol
i did that armbar in big bear
Carlos Condit is the man. My fav fighters : Diaz Bros,Condit, Rory, Gegard Mousasi, and for sure DJ, TJ and Rockhold have a very well rounded skillset and a high fight IQ.
wtf no time stamps who dropped the ball
I keep thinking that max holloway is a really cool guy
So Ariel thinks the ufc's bantemweight division is the sister division to bellators version ayyt ariel i see you
I like Tony but he can be full of himself sometimes when he talks about how exactly he likes the fight to go down after a win.  Give me a break Tony....nobody wants a war like the fight you had with RDA.  And definitely you did not want to be mounted by Kevin Lee (you weren't getting out of that if it wasn't for the bell).  Just say it like it is Tony.  With that being said, you're a great fighter.  \n\nHope you get that Mcgregor fight.
Sensei Seagull is a fraud! He got choked & pooped himself!
Saki vs. Roundtree is a dope ass fight.
2:56:54 Was that a cart from Tony?
Ian Mccall is ass
Tony might be weird and a genius at the same time.
Maybe in the 165lb division...AAAAAYYYYOOOOO!
LAS VEGAS WAS A FALSE FLAG
Was that a fart 2:56:54
Tony is gullible if he thinks Dana speaks the truth.
Wtf ian hasnt fought in years nd he wanna get paid more wtf he just need to retire he a nobody lost to dj he doent want it to fight no more he should quit cus he aint top 5 nd he wanna get paid like he a champ no way
Condit is one of my favorite fighters and one of the most entertaining fighters I've ever seen. He's had a rough last few fights (as he said, the Maia loss was so ugly for him, he decided to leave the sport), but I think he's still one of the pound-for-pound best. Over the last half of his career, he's only lost to the best-of-the-best and only by the narrowest of margins. He was injured during the Woodley fight, Lawler was a razor-thin split decision, he avenged his Kampmann loss, and St. Pierre is St. Pierre. One weakness that he has is he doesn't fight takedowns enough. He's so skilled & active off his back, that getting taken down is almost a comfortable position for him. The problem is, even if he's not taking damage on the ground, the judges see it & tend to score against him because of that. Plus, he tends to brawl too much. If he had gotten a few takedowns against Lawler (nobody ever tries to take Robbie down) he would've won that fight and might be the champ right now.
Artem Lobov vs DJ. UFC let's make it happen
Tony vs Conor....Let's go! Hey....hello....hello....Conor? Conor?? where u at? :)))
Conor's are exhibition fights , ha, ha , ha good one Max
greatest my arse.guy beats no named cans, gtfoh
Condit is and has always been a fighter's fighter. Gotta love the guy, hope he makes a run and gets another crack at Tyron. #NBK
Tony is great fighter but if he's that hittable in first 5 min against Conor he might get ko'd.
What? Flying Suplex Armbar?? The next finishing move on DJ's list will be Zangeifs 'Final Atomic Buster'. You read it here first.
so glad condits back. and so much respect to Alessio. awesome to hear from him and get some insight on how everything went from his perspective.
Tony Ferguson is so irritating and bodacious! Man, I can't wait to see someone knock this clown out.
Tony is so intense he made a Starbucks story intense
Caldwell did not win that fight that's all he did was hold and stall
So Ian McCall basically is saying he pulled a wanderlai??? Usada came over and....wtf???
Tonys mind is bullet proof !!
Holloway dating a hot model? His ex was just a couple of notches above that
Ferguson will desyroy mcgregor.
The earth is flat
2:56:55 ferguson farts
conor will destroy this guy
Ferguson vs khabib this fight make sens for us!!😂😂
LIST OF GUESTS PLEASE
Sometimes Ariels asks the dumbest questions ever
Buy #assignment #dissertation #essay #coursework #thesis with 75% Discount | writershelp.co.uk/
Stamp times, please? And how lazy that you couldn't even list the guest list initially - well, it's even in numerical order. And when they do the time they're usually erroneous. Ariel is the best MMA journalist and this is the best mma podcast. I do appreciate all the effort but just such significant things, but it's somewhat unprofessional. :)
DJ wants the easy route. Lame fighter. Retire already
Mousasi the real lb for lb best sorry DJ.
El Cucuy. love the work ethic and your fighting style... you are a really great fighter, a top 3 lightweight in the world, but your striking game and movement. i can't see anything but you getting KO'd in 1 vs conor...and vs khabib...if Lee took you down that many times my lord the difference.
Man, Ariel checks his laptop too much when his guests are talking.
Lol Tony, delusional. Conor gonna kill him within 2. Lando Vannata had you doing the chicken dance and you think you can handle a combo from Conor?
I wish Condit will go into acting, the guy has something about him, I wanna see him in some movies
Im a musician of 30yrs. \n I must say Everlast's performance was VERYimportant, he grasped that and wasted nothing, he took that moment did Xactly what was needed, healing. Big respect to the man. BIG RESPECT!
Max Holloway is so butt hurt.
Lol tony is so lucky he loses weight so easy. Should be at 170 cheating realy
How beautiful to see Sharon and Charles interacting.  Thank you for this intimate glimpse into her world.
Yes! Sharon and Charles together!  Miss them both.
Bosco and the team- Thanks for making and posting this, it's a beautiful tribute. I still can't re-watch the documentary yet, I just miss this woman and her energy. This made me cry like a baby... She will live forever in the music, thanks again, can't wait to hear her final album.
Rest In Power Sharon!
I miss her so much, everyday. Sharon and Charles have left indelible marks on all of us, and the music world. I know that they are jamming up in Heaven with Prince, Tom Petty, DB and so many other musical heroes we have lost. Thank you, Daptone for this incredible video, and for producing real, powerful soul music!
This moved me in so many ways. I'm sad that Sharon and Charles are no longer with us, but their art will outlive us all and for that I am so very grateful.
I'm also writing this message with tears streaming down my face.  Glad to have had the opportunity to see Sharon last September when Miss Sharon Jones was playing in Brooklyn.  I'll always cherish that moment.  So grateful we still have her music and movie!  Great video!
Nothing but Love & Respect for Charles & Sharon R.I.P x
Brought a tear to my eye, seeing Sharon and Charles living it up, having a good time, doing what they did best..... RIP Sharon and Charles.
The Queen is back... Forever!
Man, I miss her and Charles.
The best performer I've ever seen. Still can't believe she's gone. What a beautiful song.
Maravilhosa!❤😘 I love her!
A beautiful tribute!
I love this! What a great voice!
Sharon and Charles were taken from us much to early. Timeless soul music great performers.\nThey are missed
One of the most beautiful souls ever to grace a stage. Wherever you are Sharon, we love you; we miss you.
I'm feelin' this song
What an amazing tribute to Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. My heart breaks for the entire band-they lost a sister in soul, and quite frankly lost their livelihood. One only has to read about the trials and tribulations the band went through when Sharon fought cancer the first time to realize if they don't tour, they make no money. Thanks to everyone downloading music or using these free services, there is precious little money in recording music and selling it.\nDo the band a favor, do Daptones records a favor, and buy 10 copies of this CD for your friends and family. There will never be a band quite like SJDK again. Bosch/Gabe, thanks for making this all happen.
Beautiful, what an amazing energy!
I'm not scared to grow old now
Sharon forever you'll stay in our hearts !
This is a lovely tribute. Bravo, Daptone.
I loved her and the great band plays with Amy too. This clip it's a dream...
Only time I got a record signed and a kiss smack on the lips to go with it! Miss you Sharon, rest well.
Even in her last days, she still full of energy. Definitely one of the best that the world ever seen
Rip
more than music Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley .... Never Forget
Not one dislike. As it should be.
I miss her every day. Thank you Daptone!
Chilling to see both Sharon and Charles together.
Thanks, Daptone!  Love and miss you, Sharon and Charles.
Sounds great!  Can't wait for it to be released!  Wow...in seeing Charles Bradley in this video.  RIP to them both!!
True Gem!
Forever Legends RIP † @2:21
Miss her.
fabulous!!
Beautiful
Loved it!
💙
oh yeah! love and miss Sharon
I STILL get goosebumps every time I hear you guys sing Crazier Than You! <3
Oliver: *cheeky assgrab at 9:14 *\nMe: *chokes on air*
The chemistry between you and Oliver is insane. Whether you may be together or not, you're definitely friendship goals and I envy it so much
does anyone not have a crush on oliver
Hey Carrie! I love you and your videos sooo much, you're a huge inspiration! My middle school just finished the production of the Addams family young@part, in which I played the 50s ancestor. I love you sooooo much!
Just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the show this evening. My husband and I came to watch it in Glasgow. You were absolutely fantastic!! You're voice blew us away. Great job, I'll be recommending it to friends and family 😊
Can you do a video with mortitia I love your videos and it means a lot for you to make them I belive having a chanel has a big impact on your life i have just started a performing arts group and I would love some tips plus I just think you are amazing I hope you take this message into consideration because I guess you have a lot of people saying this stuff to you but I door belive it would mean so much to me thank you so much Joe xx
Watched Adams family last night at the kings thearter ! ,😀😍❤
Are her and Oliver dating???!!!
Wait. Carrie. Why did you change ure name. It was perfect
Saw you in belfast, you all were insanely good!!\nThank you for an amazing show 💙💙
Will they be realising a soundtrack for the Addams family, I would pay so much to get that
HEARING YOU SING ONE NORMAL NIGHT AGAIN MADE ME CRY
Carrie, I'm not commenting on this video to tell you how good it is or that you and Oliver would be an awesome couple. I'm commenting to tell you just how awesome you are as a person, please never change even if people tell you to. Xxx
There's a Catan app???
Heyy Carrie!! Please please could you and oliver record a version of 'crazier than you' im obssessed with the song but noone else sings it as well as you guys! Xxxxx
Olly, you need one of the Newt Hufflepuff scarves from Fantastic Beasts. They sell them and they are much more subtle.
MORE SCOTT!!! Miss seeing his beautiful face xxx!
Hi I'm coming to see the show in a few weeks time yay
Great video! Do you happen to have a business contact email?
Does anyone know if there are going to be any more tour dates after the Singapore trip? My sister and I wanna come see the show but we have to fly in from Holland so have to plan it because of school and vacations
My boyfriend and I had one of our first dates in that very Maggie Mays ❤️
I'll be so so sad when tour is over bc I love the Adams family vlogs :(
My sister did the same thing with my birthday present. I was planning to buy some shampoo/conditioner the week before (luckily i didn't) and she got me the EXACT TWO I wanted (I love Juicy and American Cream)... even though they weren't the same as the ones i just finished. Love it when that happens :)\n\nAlso, as ever, love your videos, always put a smile on my face!
Will you guys be doing a cast recording of the show? I just saw a play of it at my college and I loved the show! I would LOVE to have the soundtrack with you in it! 💜
I will be there this Saturday at the Kings Theatre Glasgow and taking my older sister, as a treat because she is an amazing sister.  I can not wait.  Been following you on here Carrie and the time has come to see the show.  Hope you enjoy your time in Glasgow x
Saw you in the opening night at the Grand Opera House, you (and everyone else!) were awesome!!! It was my friend's first ever time at the theatre and she really, really enjoyed it :) Had to dash for a train so couldn't wait and stage door to tell you how much I enjoyed it in person, but hopefully I'll see you again in the future and can tell you then!
OMG you and Scott’s rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow is beautiful😄
So weird seeing you in places that are so familiar to me! Loved meeting you Carrie, you were so sweet as always
I saw you perform last night at the Kings theatre it was amazing loved the show , you were all great 💖💖
CAN NOT WAIT!! UR COMING TO ME NEXT WEEK AND IM COMING TO WATCH!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COME TO STAGE DOOR!!
Ok. I know I'm probably way behind the times, but why/when did the channel change names? I could have sworn that there was a (relatively) recent video where she talked about how she WOULDN'T change it because of the significance of the phrase It's way past your bedtime to her life. DID I DREAM THAT? AM I CRAZY?
I get the feeling that u and Oliver are dating
Are Carrie and Oliver together
I seriously think Carrie has the perfect voice. That is to say, if I could be Ursula and steal anyone’s voice it would be hers!💜🖤
Oliver's monkey impression looked more like Zoidberg😂
I actually went to see that in Belfast because we're doing the addams family in november \nP.s. I'm the granny \nP.s.s. I was the guy with the stupid laugh
Absolutely loved seeing you perform! Kinda raging that I didn't bump into you at all seeing as my work is directly next the Opera house.
At the end of the tour, we need a full dance cover of crazier than you!! :D
So I watched this with my husband, and when the video ended his response was: Wait we have to wait for the Unicorn!?\nAnd now he is sad that there aren't anymore videos to watch till next week.
One Normal Night is one of my fav songs from the Musical and you totally sing it the best ! wish could hear recorded version.
Now we all just wanna know what happened to the unicorn
I've just realised that Oliver reminds me of John Barrowman and now I can't unsee it. 😫
Absolutely loved meeting you in Belfast! Hope you liked the summer night fruit tea 💕💕
I need to see the fully grown unicorn. This isn’t fair
Enjoyed this show so so much absolutely incredible!
The real question is, where on earth did that dragonfly necklace come from? it's gorgeous!
But what about the unicorn though? THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!!!
Can anybody find the jumper from Zara she is wearing and link it! Im in love with it! I see you on Friday night and I CANNOT wait!!! xx
why the youtube name change? I loved it :( xx
I saw you LIVE! I was skooked to the core. your voice is seriously amazing. well done!!!
It's the elevation is my new excuse! Hahaha
When she said end of the day ... is it ok if I sang “end of the day another day over” les mis
Hey I was just wondering, how long do these musicals usually run for?
My ticket arrived last week so I’m getting more and more excited now and even have a sticker in my planner for the day 8 come to see the show. Yeah I’m a nerd lol
didn't even think to look for a catan app for my phone! Love the game. might have to go look for it now.
I actually can't cope that you are in Maggie mays like 2 minutes from my flat 🙈 seen you while you were here, me and my best friend had the best night, amazing show
EXCUSE ME BUT I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT BUM SQUEEZE
Also your voice is a POWERHOUSE
you were amazing on saturday! love you xo
Ok I've always wanted to know the answer to this: HOW do actors in musicals not CONSTANTLY LOSE THEIR VOICES?!! That's so much constant stress on your voice omg
Anyone else find it hilarious that she was dressed as Wednesday talking about wanting a giant unicorn 😂😂
Scott has me wondering about his range. I had an oh snap moment when he took it up a free octaves.
But what happened with the unicorn??? 🦄🦄🦄
I saw you guys in that theatre Thursday and it was amazing! 10/10
whenever you film onstage and show all the seats it makes me so happy :) you're my inspiration, carrie ♥
I started SNORTING with laughter at 9:16 like OH MY GOD
What is the music for the signing clip?
Are her and Dan still friends??
Are.... are we sure they aren’t dating....?
Although they're in the same family, zebras make different barking sounds than horses do, so it stands to reason that unicorns would make different sounds as well.  Something more lyrical perhaps?
Forget Oliver, I want to see more of the woman with the purple headband @6:40  :D
Maybe it's just me but you seem a bit wicked dressed as Wednesday, the character takes over and nice Carrie is no more.
So nice seeing the inside of my favourite place to work in whilst I'm across the water in Liverpool for Uni.
You where wearing that necklace today as well, very cool!! Where did you get it? And whoop for the Stitch pj!!
Love “watch me, Wednesday” xx😀 now which shop did you get that beautiful green scarf from??
I must admit, after being introduced to the new cast on Sunday night at the London Poladium, I wasn't sure what to think, since watching these vlogs I've found it quite reassuring that you guys are doing a great job at taking the show on!
It's like we're inside a jewelry box! 😍 That is what it looks like!! I've always dreamed of being that little ballerina inside a music box... Carrie, you really were! 💕
so so excited for the addam's family in singapore!!!!
Oh carrie please do a full cover of somewhere over the rainbow that would be lovely
I'm loving the backstage dancing haha! So excited to see the show in Glasgow :D
I'm so upset I don't have the money to go to see The Adams Family \nI hope you have a really amazing and special time in Belfast! <3
Is the dear Evan Hansen cover (with you and Oliver) ever going to be uploaded? I NEED a full version in my life! 💕
I could watch HOURS of Carrie, Ollie, Scott, and the rest of the cast just having fun and singing their hearts out. I'm always so sad to see the vlogs end. I look forward to them every week and they always make me smile so much. Keep up the great work, Carrie! <3
That unicorn is the biggest cliffhanger...
oliver ormson doing the most casual pirouette ever is the reason I'm an emotional mess
Love the scarves! :) <3
TRENDINGGG
YOUARESOPRETTYBEAUTIFULFUNNTANDTALENTED AAAAAA
That riff at 5:56 ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So cute
Wonderful 😍
Your voice 😍😍😍
Can we please have a unicorn update? xx
All these comments are basically the same thing 😂 least Carrie has everyone's approval if she wants it 😂❤️
1:32 IM NOT IMPULSIVE (I'd never ask that of you)
I'm so upset that you were in Belfast just weeks after I moved away for uni! 💔💔
''its like we're inside a jewellery box!'' that was so adorable :3
anyone know the song at 0:25
I’ve never met someone else who knew that coaster (or beer mat as you said) flipping trick! So awesome 💕
All that guy could taste was regret...
I thought Rick and Morty fans were supposed to be of higher intelligence? They bee getting scammed
Where did this happen? Phoenix?
Is this the Krusty Krab?
LMAO. WHAT A SHAMEFULLY EATEN NUGGET, He looked so depressed with himself for just spending $10 on one dumbass nugget.  Then the regret kicked in when he realized he was being recorded.  😂😂😂😂
*_T O   B E   F A I R ,_*
What's so special about szechuan sauce?
Mc Donald's \nIs soo A typical that this is NOT even funny . this global company literally is making money off this . Quasie attitude you post regardless because they are so stable in the market. It would actually be funny if you just got an outfit an started working there. Ha
Mmm supply and demand working at its finest.....
his face says it all... it aint worth it
https://xn--g0haaaaaaaaaaaa.gq/r/?S8RGoh0KMu3rc=2vFo3i3TaO8ncJnMThxLOBU1zJLSdN76moJ
THAT FUCKIN NUMALE CUCK TAKING THE MONEY FROM HIS FATHER
If only the guy selling looked more jewish this would be perfect.
A sauce that has been nearly forgotten for 19 years, suddenly blows up in popularity because of one show
Why are People so stupid these days
Eat from a strangers hands for 10$. Did he wash his hands?
i fucking love how his face shows the worthiness
0:21 why is that the perfect representation of the rick and morty fanbase
0:05 you can see how the guy asked for his father to borrow the 10 bucks lmao
I had this sauce before. It was good, but not $10 a pop good. Particularly notable for the sesame sauce aftertaste that lasted hours.
I do not understand how can he sell something inside the macdonalds. Isnt it wrong to sell other things inside another shop
It's no scam, they got exactly what they paid for; what an inspirational merchant.
And people thought MLP & Steven Universe fans were cancer. R&M fans are super AIDs double cancer.
It's fake 4 guys set this up!
Dumb kid. \nThey were selling for 800 dollars on eBay. \n\nCongratulations on missing out on a fortune.
The idiots paying 10 bucks are stupid but that’s actually a good idea to get idiots to pay 10 bucks for it
i blame baby boomers for this shit
This shows the elites the true nature of people. They can watch this and justify there own actions since the first chance this dude got he started exploiting people, reassuring the elites that any of us they are causing suffering would have done just the same if we was in the same position the elites currently are. He had a chance to share valuable limited resources the sauce like people preach for the corrupt people to do but then we dont do it ourself at the first chance we get?
Somebody help me out, is this sauce expensive or rare or what?
This seshuan sauce has been blown way out of proportion
Half expecting Rick to walk in with 100 dollar bills in his hands.
Thank you Rick and Morty you proved our world is fat enough to pay $10 for a bit of sauce and nugget
It's my series arc Morty, 9 seasons morty
This sums up Americans in a chicken nugget.
How is he allowed to do this inside the place where it was sold
Capitalism has gotten out of hand
THE LOOK ON THE NERDS FACE JESUS MAKES ME LAUGH
Rick and Morty fans: we're smart cos we watch Rick and Morty, the rest of you guys are fucking retards cos you don't understand the show\n\nAlso Rick and Morty fans:
The most American thing ive ever watched
-pays 10 usd for a nugget\n-eats it in one go
Please help me I am in great pain.
The aspiring entrepreneur seems to touch the money and hold the nugget using the same hand. Not only the idiot will get the chance to taste the sauce for $10, he will also get E coli for free. Great deal!
It wasn’t worth it👎
That guy doesn’t seem impressed
That man is a genius.
What a fucking fool. The look on his face when he's asked if its worth it. Of course  its not fucking  worth it
Don't these guys know anything about hygiene?!
Its a scam a few people In on it and they buy and say its nice so other normal people buy like sheep
Is this in Canada
These rick and morty fans are so fucking cringe smh
you paid a man 10 dollars to dip a nugget in some shite sauce, if i was your dad ill slap the shit out of you and disown you for life.
Why did i watch this 😒
Is this a live action Ed, Edd and Eddy?
Capitalist at its best! 😂😂😂
you can buy szechuan sauce from the chinese down the road from me. they do it with seafood or meat
People in the comments will gladly hand over money for overpriced iPhones, celebrity endorsed makeup, cars, and sneakers etc but think it's dumb to buy a nugget dipped in sauce for ten bucks ......
The world is fucked.
Think for yourself, don't be sheep
Jimmy neutron in ten years
Stupid niggers. This is why you are poor.
Rick and Morty fans belong in concentration camps
That’s cheap as fuck!!!
Szechuan sauce? Tf??\nBruh that dude handles money and then your nugget and sauce. Good luck with all that faecal matter on the nugget, you probably got some other sauce too 😷
ARE THEY REALLY THAT GOOD???
He then sold them air for $20
Fair play to the guy hustling these idiots
Good for him. Just like people that pay $1,000 for a phone.
Well, time to stop watching rick and morty and associating myself with the horde of asshats that claim to be fans......
Lol the guy stuffs it in and crosses his arms like yes I'm a badass
Wtf why  is this trending for ?
:24 That is the face of defeated, beaten man.
What a stupid fucking video.
Rick and Morty is truly a show for intellectuals a fanboy shouts as he pays 10 dollars for a fucking chicken nugget...
Who came from WillNE vid?
biggest asshole
Wow much intelligent\n\n\nSuch intellects
Fucking retards
Fucking 10 bucks apiece for meme sauce

Mc Jewed
What is szechuan sauce lol
Please meme gods make 0:25 a meme
All these comments hating on Rick and Morty fans saying they can't be as clever as they think they are for spending $10 a nugget.....I argue the dude selling the nuggets is the biggest fan in the room and he's a fucking genius
So you criticize Alien: Covenant for its usage of the location establishing test effect but you completely ignore it in your review for this movie? Okay.
you have weird taste m8\nit was boring, derivative, and contrived
Your Bible does not have the holy name of the Son and the Father, Yasha Ahayah Bible Scriptures  https://www.amazon.com/Yasha-Ahayah-Bible-Scriptures-Study/dp/1771433264/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1495595262&sr=8-16
I can't fucking wait for the BluRay release so I can get it in 4K
Just saw it today, loved, loved this movie
the first sequel / reboot i was actually thrilled came out AND thoroughly enjoyed. also +1 to Jared Leto redemption
Movies like this is why I love cinema.
I'm glad everyone liked the movie :) Though I wasn't quite so entranced.\n\nMy main concern is that it's major plot points tended to be pretty well worn sci fi cliches.\nThe post apocalyptic miracle birth. \nThe rag tag rebellion army living on the outskirts of society. \nThe am I real am I not dilemma of the main character. \nA quasi religious evil genius. \nA high kicking female goon. \nA tough but fair police chief.\n\nSo while beautiful and we'll executed, every time the movie slowly revealed one of its major points, I was left with, Oh, really, is that all?
haha Just saw this with my mom. She fell dead asleep during the section where Jared Leto's character is introduced. She says, Needless to say, that film was still more exciting than the original!!
ADAM WHERE IS THE NEW SYNECDOCHE PART? :D
I think the movie was painstakingly slow, boring and badly written. It really was a chore to watch, I enjoyed the first one way more.
This film is financially bombing and that is tragic, please please support this wonderful movie!
1st screening at the local cinema. 4 people showed up. Fantastic movie, tho.
agree in everything you said, Great movie.
My only real complaint is that it was very slow paced, which is fine I guess, but it was like over 2 hours long and also slow. It kinda made me wanna fall asleep, but kept me just interested enough not to. I thought it was a good movie though
I just saw this film, and while i see the great aspects of audio-visual stimulation this film can provide, i have to say, that it's just plain f****** boring.\nAfter the first 3/4 hour, which was great, it just totally sucked ass. nothing happens, if something happens it's pretentious bulls***. The dialogue at the end is soooo, forcefully spread out, it just made me angry. a max 5/10
Reminded me too of Enter The Void... just totally out of this world. I hope we get another one.
my favorite scene was with Deckard's Partner, and when he folded the sheep, a cool reference to both the first movie and the book Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep?
Please God let his Dune project be successful
I disagree with just about everything you said in this video. It was in no way a masterpiece to give a 10/10 rating for this 6/10 movie is crazy
watch this movie you will love it         ¨Dave Maze¨\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzikIwPPle0&t=69s
Knew this would be good as soon as I saw who director was. Like I believe Adam has said before, you can tell more about wheter or not a movie will be good by the director, than anything else. A film can have a great cast, and be crap, if the director is crap. But take a great director like Dennis Villanueve, and there is a good chance you will get a great film. Not to say great directors can't make bad films, but a great director has a higher sucess rate than a great actor
Just watched this movie i am definitely going to watch it again
no one wants another jurassic anything at this point
10/10 for me. Go see this!!
Everything you just said was exactly my thoughts on the film after watching it for the first time last night.  I've seen Blade Runner more times than I can count or remember and when I read they were doing a sequel in a EW mag, I was extremely skeptical (even knowing Denis was slated as director and I already seen Prisoners and loved it) but then I go in and have one of the greatest fan and film experiences of my life.  Blade Runner 2049 is everything that any fan could ever hope to have in a sequel, even when that sequel comes out 30 years after the original.  It was a huge risk to make this kind of film in today's media and I say they pulled it off in a practically perfect way.
Damn, when Adum wants to give a movie a 10/10, for all that it's worth, it must be a near perfect movie!
Basically I feel that any movie that Adam likes. Is going to do bad in box office sales\nThanks for fucking shit up Adam
What was Wallace's motivation for being evil and why was it in conflict with Gosling's? Srsly didn't get that.
I cant understand for the life of me why people are praising this movie so much. Even people like YMS and cinema for cynics who normally are picky about movies. This movie had terrible pacing, convoluted story telling, and wooden under developed characters. The bad guys were soooo one dimensional and stupid. Doesn't hold a candle to the original.
Watched this the other day and loved it!  Literally my only complaint was there was a lot of moments i nearly lost my hearing ( obviously exaggerating ) but that was more the cinemas issue. 10/10
Vote with your wallets is the gist of this video, in my opinion. Please start supporting great movies like Blade Runner 2049, instead of shitty blockbusters, otherwise shitty blockbusters are all we're going to be getting from now on.
It's a Ghostbusters(2016) of sci-fi movies. You guys take too much drugs.
i think this is the best movie of the year lol 10/10
Well its bombing in the box office so we wont get more good movies anymore this is why we cant have good things good job everyone go give Marvel all your money to see a movie you've already seen ten times already but just with a characyer swap
So are we getting more pokemon vids?
This movie failing at the box office may be a great thing. Now there won't be a cinematic universe and unnecessary sequels
I know it’s really broad to say, but for me, this might be the greatest film of the decade
Kinda weird not hearing that split second earrape intro like with the rest of your videos
Just saw it myself and really enjoyed it. \nHowever, without spoiling anything, there was a scene that took me by surprise because it suddenly reminded me of a scene from the movie Ghost and I had to stifle a chuckle in the theater.
Apparently he's interested in making his own version of Dune\n*Claps then shoots arms up in excitement*
It avoided all of the traps of your usual sequel cash-grab.
It's is incredibly relieving to me that you enjoyed this film.  I felt the same way as you after my second viewing.
I need that Denis Dune movie in my life.
Looks like people voted to have more Jurassic worlds and Transformers. ☹
Do i have to watch all the 2048 blade runner movies?
Story was fucking awful. Littered with conveniences. Forgets a lot of the elements it brings up and doesn't do anything with it's themes. The ties to the original were pointless.
I kinda hated it honestly. I felt bored during the movie.
I've seen this movie 2 times already and I will be seeing it again can't get it out of my head.
It's such a shame that a visionary film like this under performs at the box office, while bullshit movies like the Transformers sequels still rake in enough cash to keep being made. WTF!?
Fake Reviews are propping this disaster up\n \nThis movie was just awful in so many ways. I had a very hard time\nstaying awake and an even harder time making sense out the extremely\nslow story line unfolding. I kept thinking the entire time I was\nwatching it that they were just filling time with empty, meaningless\nscenes. In the end I was convinced that the entire story could have\nbeen told in about thirty minutes, with some decent action, and it\nwould have been a lot better. \n\nThe main way to describe this movie is that, to be kind, the story line\ntook a backseat to meaningless but beautiful HD cinematography. The\nstory was difficult to follow and had an all over the place and\nmeaningless feeling to it. No one in the theater said a word when it\nwas over. They all just got up and walked out looking bored out of\ntheir minds. \n\nCharacter development was next to non existent with the exception of a\nfew scenes that pretended to develop the main character. \n\nSince I had to give it one star to rate it, I will say that star was\nfor the actors, who in my opinion did as good a job as possible with\nthe horrible, painstakingly slow script they were give. \n\nMy last complaint is that I have been duped into going and seeing a few\nmovies because the IMDb rating was initially very high, only to end up\nwasting my time and money. I am convinced that the good reviews are\nfake and most likely paid for. It is IMPOSSIBLE for people to be rating\nthis garbage a 9 or 10. Perhaps someone who is deaf and just loves\nlooking at HD scenery in movies would have loved it. Other than that it\nwould take a seriously unique kind of person to think this movie was\ndecent, much less good.
Will you please please please do a review on 'American Satan' when it comes out. I'm positive it's gunna suck but I'd like to hear your thoughts on it and if it's worth my time.
I'm so glad you loved this movie as much as I did, it's definitely my favourite movie of 2017
I loved the movie. The art and cinematography is amazing. But I do believe it's a bit stretched out. Lots of just waiting around, a bit too long to concentrate on (maybe because I saw it at 10pm and was tired.)
If this guy pulls off a successful DOOM movie I think my faith in this medium will be restored.
Funny I found the first one much more enjoyable and better paced than the new one. I actually had moments where I had to keep me awake in the cinema because I was nearly falling asleep because it was not only long but so slow paced like every scene. Even now that I am nearly complettly asleep I have trouble turning of the original but just one hour ago I ad real trouble not to fall asleep. Also the characters where much better. Especially this, whats his face? The guy who bought tyrell just sucked and I was happy when he was out of frame. He was okay but damn Tyrell was a genius this is just a Chickenhead of a rich dude.\n\nBut than that is how it is everyone expierence so I see YMS points and I consider them fair.
Harrison Ford was perfect in episode seven. For what it was supposed to be. It wasn't eh, it was Han. It's probably one of the reasons Ford really doesn't like that character, because he has to act somewhat cheesy and at times kind of stupid. His performance in Crystal Skull was eh.
From an audio/visual perspective this movie is the apex of what film has done so far.
Maybe the engineers from Prometheus / Alien Covenant are replicants that created the aliens so that replicants could kill off all humans.
I nearly didn't see this on the basis that I didn't like the original Blade Runner, but the overwhelmingly positive reviews I've read/heard from reviewers and publications I trust and close friends swayed my opinion. So glad I did. Sure, there WERE flaws, but they didn't massively detract from the film, and honestly, if it doesn't sweep all the techie awards (Oscars, BAFTAs, etc. etc.), I will slap a bitch.
ADAM IM UPSET BLADE RUNNER ISNT DOING GOOD AT THE BOX OFFICE IM GOING TO WATCH IT 3 MORE TIMES
Do a yms review of screenagers
I recently watched Arrival for the first time and I can say with absolute certainty that Denis Villeneuve is the best new filmmaker working today. I didn't think I'd be saying that but after watching Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario and now, Arrival, there's no doubt in my mind. Arrival was smart, emotional and spellbinding and did something that is rare in mainstream movies; It provoked my thoughts. I can't wait to see Blade Runner 2049.
I've never heard him say 10/10
Lets give this director more money plz!!! Villenueve deserves it. His worlk has been impecable on every single movie he has been directing. Personally one of my favorites this decade.
Thank you Adam, I was going to skip this one because I wasn't convinced Blade Runner needed a sequel or that Hollywood would do it justice but this quickie made me do a 180 on that decision.\nWas not disappointed in the least!
not a 10/10 I'm so fucking triggered reeeeee!
m8! do a review on IT pleez
Spoilers:\nI think the whole movie is about K finding his humanity. Throughout the movie, he constantly is belittled by everyone for being a replicant, he’s not real to anyone, not even to himself. But deep down, he knows there's something more, but because of his job and the world he lives in, he won't accept it. That’s why his girlfriend isn’t real either, he doesn't think he deserves a real one, and he See's himself in her. But as the story continues, and he begins to figure out that he may actually be this prophecy child, he begins to realize that maybe he is real. He starts breaking down, realizing that this whole time he was right, that what his girlfriend told him was right, that he is special. Because of this he begins acting human, he goes against what he's told, he lies, as he believes he really is real, that he has a soul. But after its revealed to him that he isn't this child, he loses hope. They tell him to kill deckard, and begins to act as he did at the beginning of the film, just following orders. But before he does, he See's his girlfriend advertising hologram, and then realizes something. He realizes this whole time, she was just as unreal as he was. But he loved her just the same. So it hits him, if I can believe she is real, why can't I believe I am real? He realizes that this whole time, he always had a soul, that everything he did while he thought he was this child the way he acted, that was just him. The memory of the horse was like placebo for him. You even hear the voice over say dying for a cause is the most human thing a person can do  which is exactly what he did. But this not only alludes to him, but to Joi too. She risked her life to help him, and died because of it. In this scene, he realizes that she was real. Him realizing she is real, is his miracle (like sapper said) that gives him a reason to believe he too is real. He then uses this freedom to go against what he is told, freeing deckard, reuniting him with his daughter, and then dying peacefully just like Roy. As he has now proven to himself. That he was always real. As he lets the snow land on him, just like the rain did on Joi when she discovered she was real. He is real. He is free.
huh. i watched this expecting you to rip it a new asshole not suck it off. I guess i need to see it.
I thought it was boring. Although I enjoyed when he choked that bitch out.
dune aside, I heard daniel craig absolutely wants villeneuve to direct his final 007 next year...
2049 is not a movie, seeing it in a theater is one of those experiences you describe to your grandchildren years later.
When i saw that you'd reviewed BR49 i was excited and a little worried because your reviews are usually spot on and you don't suffer fools gladly so i was pleasantly surprised with your very positive review. \nI watched BR as a 20yo and it really was my favourite movie for many years (not so much these days). It's so nice to see that the torch has been passed.
this movie costed $150m let's hope it'll surpass it's budget.
I knew I wanted to see this movie, but I so rarely see movies (just due to scheduling). This review was the kick in the ass I needed and holy shit, I loved it. Possibly one of my favorite movies of the past few years. Excellent.
Well I guess we gotta give Ridley Scott credit...
I completely agree. I loved this movie and do think it is an improvement over the original. I felt transported to another universe for 3 hours, and the story was decadent filled with characters that are well acted and that the audience grows to actually care about.
I love the theme of loneliness in the movie.
Oscar MUST consider this film during awards season. Reframed in that context I think it will finally attract the audience it was always meant to (i.e. people looking for long form art, not a blockbuster action film).
Oh my god, a movie that Chris Stuckmann and YMS agree on? Amazing. The only, ONLY reviewer or whatever that didn't like this movie was Cr1tikal and his opinion just comes from his lack of understanding of what Blade Runner is. His friend didn't even like the shining. Everyone else is in love. If even YMS is in love, then this really is one of the best sequels of all time. Alongside Aliens.
I saw this video the day it came out, watched the first five seconds, heard I thought it was phenominal and immediately closed the video to go watch the film. After finally getting a chance, I came back, watched the vid, and found myself in agreeance.  A lot of the things you said were things I happened to notice while watching the movie. You and other film critic channels (such as Ralphthemoviemaker) have really helped me learn about how cinematography works, and how to view films with a critical eye rather than that of the average movie goer. In many ways this has enhanced my experience watching films and I appreciate the lessons you've taught on the value of good film making.
I just saw this movie today. The theater was mostly empty unfortunately, but it's so good I decided I'm gonna have to see it at least two more times. I want more movies like this, please.
I really hope Villeneuve and Deakins squeeze in Bond 25 before Dune
wtf, this review was the most positive review ive ever heard from Adam. So much so that I thought he had to be kidding. I'll definitely check this movie out
Oh fuck I didn't know the person who directed Arrival.\nI'll watch this.
Instead of doing DOOM maybe the director who's name I will not butcher can explore a possible live action Cowboy Bebop?? =D
Blade Runner is a great film, as is the sequel, which is an extremely rare thing...   but alas, I'm heartbroken. It seems that the general public HAS voted with their wallets and Blade Runner 2049 is not the film they want. They don't want excellent pacing, cinematography, directing, acting, etc. Most want their Fast & Furious and Transformer schlock. If there is one thing I want to see happen (which probably won't) is that even if it's not the financial success we'd hoped it would be, I pray The Academy gets one thing right, and that's for 2049 to sweep all it's categories...          well, if it's even nominated, that is.
I'm gonna see it again over the weekend. It's an experience but I feel like I wanna explore the universe more. First watch,I'd say maybe a 9.1/10. 
Every time Ryan Gosling's wife rang, the Peter and the Wolf ringtone made me immediately paint a mental image of Kenny initiating a plan to beat Spenny at a competition.
love you adam
so fucking\n\n\nboring
You kinda sound like riley dennis
bullshit. director is talentless cockroach, eh.
ngl, didnt like it
Vote with your wallets, people
Adam this comment is kinda gay but I just wanted to say that I love this channel. Your reviews are hilarious and aside from just being funny these videos are pretty in depth and analytical all things considered. I just wanted to say this channel is fucking great and coming from someone who aspires to be a director  I really admire what you do. so keep up the good work and remember cool cat loves you.
This movie was so fucking boring...
This movie is so good!
I'm sorry, how was every scene necessary? There's legit a whole scene of him sticking his hand in a beehive for 10 mins. He just walks around doing nothing for most of the film.\n\nI actually thought you were being sarcastic at points. This movie was so long and the plot was so thin it should have been an hour long.\n\nThe story was really predictable and kind of disappointing. Compare this to an episode of black mirror and there's no contest. Blade Runner 2049 wasn't thrilling, it wasn't exciting. It was mildly interesting at best.\n\nThe type of movie is also done to death with Ghost In The Shell and every dystopian sci-fi franchise ever being already produced. \n\nIt has no suspense or drama and it had a typical mustache twirling villain that drove the plot of the film. I wouldn't even call it dystopian, the drive of the film had nothing to do with the world. The world wasn't oppressive and the protagonist wasn't fighting against human nature, he was fighting against some big baddy. \n\nI also had no reason to care about the characters. I just found myself thinking, oh so they're dead okay.\n\nAny other sci-fi film has explored the concepts in this film a million times better than this did.\n\nIdk, maybe I should watch it again but idk why people are praising this film so much.
Hello, my name is Jinny Anna. I am 14 years old and I want to ask everyone a question. How can a young ugly girl become a youtuber? 😭
Love this Georgia! Would love a style/ look book style video! Or history or your style, fashion tips x
Really good video and enjoyed watching it
Nice video thanks for sharing. please visit my channel for more videos like this.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6xNtP6pnfXXXXp7cvSTOw

Hi Georgia! Loving the videos!! 😍 I was just wondering if you could tell me where you got your big candle holder in the background please?! It’d be perfect in my living room!! 🙊😆👏🏻 xx
Would totally be racing back to primark to pick up those pj bottoms but I already did my primark haul for the month, I think my bank would hate me!
I absolutely love this!!! Specially when you realised you're wearing red hahaha you're great and so lovely!!
It would of been lovely if you tried the things on to show us what they look like and what you would pair them with xxx but still an amazing video ❤️❤️❤️
So glad to see Primark is in there I work for the company! Also so glad your s down to earth gal that always go for designer!! Well done Georgia on such a fabulous video , loving your bump xx
Lovely :)
Where is danny
😍😍😍😍😙😙😙😙 Great video
i loved that you went to all different stores and not just high end shops. as mums cant afford expensive things!! i lived in my over the bump leggings. soo comfy and kept bump warm as it always felt cold 💕
Think primark and h&m do super long cami tops...primark do ones that are almost dress length, they are amazing for under shorter top
This is great to see! My bump has just started to pop out so I've been picking up a few bits of maternity wear but great to see some non maternity that will also work for bump! I've found there is a lack of maternity jumpers about so thanks for showing those especially!
Haha, you won't want to give your maternity jeans up, I had to put mine in the bin so I'd stop wearing them... they're so comfy! Xx
Great video Georgia - I just got the same red / tan M&S jumper a few days ago - already worn it twice! 👌🏻
Most fashionable pregnant woman I've seen! 💕
No stalker Danny since the last sighting..
Lovely remember to always do 'try on' as well. We are all curious how you look wearing these ;)
I love Primark!There are always so many lovely things to buy for yourself or your home!M&S do lovely Danish pastries and cakes which I am rather partial to,have you tried them?I am loving all your vlogs!Love the top you are wearing too!
Honestly i think i would be confident as fuck if were to make it past 65
I am 12. Nothing interesting. 💩 I dont want to believe this. 😂
You feel most comfortable with your body between the age of 75 and 84? I would think that your feeling like shit because your back hurts your cranky, music sucks so your ears hurt, all this pain and anger is giving you a headache you can't pee normally anymore, like I see nothing good in all of this and it will transfer to your psychy which is the next thing saying you feel the best at 82, so with all this shit going on and the idea that your body is near its limits and you are probably gonna die soon how is my psychological well being at its highest? It's stressed as fuck
I haven't even finished and I know I'm going to feel down after this video D:
0-2 years old you can get away with ANYTHING
Why do they say that Math skills are highest at 50 years old but show Physics stuff instead -.-
Best at playing chess? Most people can’t even play
From the jump this video is dumb, the younger age learning languages better  thing is a myth.
Such videos need evidence. scientific evidence or at least mention a research because this world has a media that is full of mistakes
Ok I will wait to get 50 and then deal with mathematics
Cant wait to be 60 or over so I can say whatever the f I want lol
That's for middle class , what about the other humans?
Did anyone see Pogba in the last few seconds?
Im Was The Best At Skateboarding When I Was 10 Now Im 47 Still The Best At My True Sport
Women's peak strength is earlier than 25
i one year over least likely to die, *sigh*
Anyone know who the music is by?
Or just go smoke a blunt
Women make highest salary at 39 and met at 48 wtf are the feminists talking about
I actually felt the most alive, and my future felt the most promising at 23. By the time I turned 24 though, after a few failed job interviews and rejections later.. realized this life thing aint easy.
this is the most depressing video ever
i am least likely to die :/\n*W H Y*
I haven’t begun to peak
I just want to know when will be my peak dick size.
I'm 18. I guess this is my last year of not being retarded
Age 31, when your metabolism says “fuck you”.
Lol, so you are at peace with yourself and your body just before you die.....
Does anyone know the song?
75-84 most comfortable with your body???? Are you freaking kidding me????????????
It would make my day if someone could tell me what song this is.
When you dont fit any of the above 😂😂😂
This explains why i keep getting straight F's in my math class....cant wait to get 50 and boom....
Well ain't this video all BS
Some of these don't make sense.
Yeah...just can’t wait until I can play chess well.
Yeah I'm looking forward to having great math skills. You know, 30-40 years after school
Wait... so you're telling me I have to wait half a century in order to be decent at math... *sigh*
why at the end did it say there's always one thing to look forward to then they all die
Well this wasn't nearly as depressing as I thought it would be.
Even though this isn't full on fact (or fact at all) this video is uplifting to people who are scared of aging.
I call bullshit on most of them
What a load of crap.
Dnt watch this just experience ur own surprises In the things that make you, YOU ! (:
ATTENTION :\n\nThe Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. THE PATH IS NARROW AND VERY FEW PEOPLE FIND IT!THE STRONG DELUSION THAT GOD SENDS IS SUNDAY CHURCH SERVICE, AS WELL AS THE PRIDE OF LIFE.PEOPLE WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO THEIR PASTOR THEN LISTEN TO GOD. EVERLEARNING IN CHURCH INSTITUTIONS AND NEVER KNOWING JESUS. NEVER HEARING THE FATHER VOICE.Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons DIDNT WE ATTEND CHURCH but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven.REPENTANCE,OBEDIENCE AND LOVE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. THE CHURCH IS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THEY ARE NOT IN THE INSTITUTIONS. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!! ACTS 7:48\n\nBE YE SEPARATE FROM THE WORLD!! BE YE SEPERATE FROM THE LOVERS OF THIS WORLD!
Highest satisfaction in life 23? Well, the rest of life is going to suck haha.

Did the really do women are most attractive and not do men are most attractive?
What are you the best at RIGHT NOW? \n.... sleeping.
They forgot:\nThe age when you are best at popping a boner: 12 years old
So these are just averages, you can’t really take anything from this video, at all
Well, damn, I'm 24 so I guess it's all downhill now.
Highest satisfaction at 23? That was the lowest point of my life.
Age is just a number or you can  ask my mom, who against all odds , came to this country, learn a new language at 44, met the man of her dreams at 46, got an incredible job offer at 66, at 77 yrs old my mom is still going strong!!\nstill works her full time job ( by choice), and has More aspirations than ever.\nabove all she is very grateful woman for what she  has done for  her life  and ours .\nage is just a number.
lmao the happiest is 23 years old, usually when people graduate college
I thought at the end it was going to say No matter how old you are...we are all going to die
Jesus goddamn Christ! Can I go one day without worrying about my future?!
No matter how old you are... remember, that one day, you WILL die.  Have a nice life :)
Well this brought my self esteem down
What if I say, I don't believe this crap ....
Quality of life is highest at 23? I feel like there are so many social determinants and lifestyle dependency factors...
You Are Great - Motivation \nhttps://youtu.be/4R90ek4V7d8
This is fake I enjoyed life the most when I was 24
 I'm Proven this video Very Wrong !     🔮
23 is typically when most people are out of college with no job.  That doesn't sound like a satisfying life.

I'm 19, time to see how shitty the rest off my life will be :)
TIL that the average person, doesn't know what an average means...
so they looked at a bunch of statistics, calculated averages and then proceeded to make a shitty, useless video. bravo.

The dislikes are from Costa for being pocketed by Per in FA cup final
Wow his English is pure fluent better than Kane tbh
I feel proud that we have such a fantastic club captain!
If Arsenal FC was a man it would pretty much be Per 👏
you can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice that he cares. it's great that he cares.
Per Mertesacker, a true leader in many areas of life. A good example, strong but humble character. He is an example of what we lack in today's society, not just in football, for a man to stand up and be a leader and but remain true and humble. What a brilliant man.
More people need to be like that. Including me.
now i know why wenger chose him to be our club's captain
Per really looks like a young Arsene Wenger when he was young lol
Class act on and off the pitch 👊👊
Please don’t retire. Ever.
I honestly love Per Mertesacker. He will always be a legend whilst he retires.
I'll always love this guy. Always. What a legend. Humility builds great leaders.
Big _Friendly_ German awww
What a guy per mertesacker BFG⚽️. My G
Why not make him assistant coach for next season?
BFG is a leader and born motivator
The fans captain\nInspiring
What a genuine and lovely person respect per
Such a gentle giant. Per you beautiful soul. Keep up the good work!
All young players, from ALL clubs, watch & learn, BFG, top man,
I just love this club so much
The depth of character of this man...geez Louise.  It's an absolute honor to have him represent The Arsenal on and off the pitch.  I hope he remains with the Club in various capacities long after this final campaign.
Proud to be gooner fan and proud of him..coug
This man has went from hero-Legend-God
Big Friendly German!!! Top Guy I reckon.
What a great man! Let's keep him at the Arsenal.
Gary hurt Per's eye 😭
manutd fan here, have to admit I have always looked up at to him both on and off the pitch
Values of this club were always top , love you Per.
Mertesacker should be Arsenal Manager by 2030... Remember me...
What a great man.\nReally hope he can instill the same values he has on the younger lads (not saying that they don't have it) and raise them to be leaders, not just football players.
Proud to have him at arsenal
Remember who you are, what you are, and who you represent.
PER!!! What a GUY..!! 👏
Well done and nice video UP THE GUNNERS🖒
What a good day for me. Inspired
Respect! It's good of Arsenal to keep hold of him
I love this guy man.. what a legend.
people who dislike this have no heart
Mertesacker one of my all time favorites. This man's form in 14/15 damn!!
You cannot hate Per Mertesacker
Legend💪🏾
Love this guy
our captain! <3 :')
Big f****** German - Top guy. A really nice guy.
A gentle giant and a great man.
Well done sir!  Respect to you!
The man's so elegant and refined he's even starting to look like Arsene
You are a very good man Per. Big fan. A man who is really down to earth, loves the club and fans. A true leader and real captain. Thanks.
Can see this guy becoming manager of our great club one day 🔴⚪️❤️
He gives so much back to the community. Could do with a politician like him tbf
Hope Per always stays around the club, he's such a gentle, intelligent kind-hearted guy
We can have this great mentality.. and all the other great mentalities that Arsenal have AND buy top class players that might not meet the humble footballer and change them to be more humble once they're brought to Arsenal!!
my favorite player since he played his first few games at arsenal. what a guy
I hope Per stays in UK and with Arsenal for many years.
I don't even like football, what a great guy
What a great guy Per is.... really pleased he's staying on at Arsenal after he's finished playing. He has all the right values.
We're lucky to have this kind and thoughtful human being at our club, your a credit to your parents and country
Proud that he is our CAPTAIN :)
We Love You Per. You have opened my eyes. God Bless You
John Terry might have every single trophy for club out there and perhaps superior to the BFG but he ain't won a World Cup has he
A perfect club captain for us.
Per is a one of a kind.
I can't wait until he takes over the Arsenal academy. He is going to be such an important asset to youth development. Legend.
I'm a simple man, I hear Per Mertesacker giving his perspective  on something, I listen.
Hi  i love the guners please can play in your team  please 😢 🙏
Hopefully his last game with Arsenal is winning Europa League trophy! #Respect #Legend
Now that is how you really serve your people and country not a never ending war in the name of peace, so much respect for you Per
I just dont understand people these days how can there be 4 dislikes ,what is wrong with being honest and wanting to highlight a important condition in many peoples life's. even if your not an arsenal fan or admirer of per there shouldn't be dislikes
Wow. Such an amazing role model for Arsenal. So much respect for Per Mertesacker.
Fantastic!  Hope to see you on the pitch again soon.
Announce Thomas Lemar signing in January
4 dislikes WTF... Spuds troll ?
What a inspiration 👏👍
Thats why he is captian, always stay humble guys!
Nice video Per, good bloke
I appriciate this more than trophies.\nThis is per..this is Wenger..this is wenger's philosofy..this is arsenal!!!!!!!!!!
Mertesacker being a legend, as PER usual...
Proud to have him as our Captain! Also proud that he speaks better English than Harry Kane... What a man
does germany still have that kind of national service?\nwe seriously need it in england
He's such a great guy.
Per is somebody that you just can't hate.
BFG!
Much respect Per Mertesacker. Really touching example
WELL DONE MERTESACKER!!!!!
; ♥️ ;
BFG!!! “F” stands for fabulous, fantastic :) what an inspiring man.
An Arsenal Legend already!
Class pure class...thank you Per!
Craque.
Love mertesacker
Fantastic wall done to hem & Respect
Fair play per👏
Top lad
Man like BFG
Love, Per.
Love you Per
Per mertasacker blond hair
He truly stands tall among men.
cant wait for the EXPLORATION YESS YESSS YESSSS !!!!! Finaly
I remember a time when software companies would release a game, then not support it, then release a new system so that you would have to re-buy the game, AND the system.  We have it pretty damn good as Elite Dangerous gamers!  THANK YOU Frontier.
Did I hear that right? Did they say that all of the content mentioned from the 2018 roadmap was going to be _free for all Horizons players?_
So THAT'S how they made the thargoid noise....never would have guessed!
Space loach bobble head?
good to see them crack down on the core of the game finally, wish it happened sooner but hey.. better late than never. Also really excited to see this new generation of ship design we will be seeing!
Does all look very nice and shiny, just a shame we have to wait a year for it all.
I don’t care what everyone else says, I am looking forward to this and am VERY happy with the announcements.
So, Thargoids = shitty space flowers? I'm really disappointed. This devs have zero imagination.
Love the road map & where we are all heading CMDRS! Keep up the sterling work Frontier.
So...\nWhat about space legs.\nWhen are we going to see them or you know...\nBE ABLE TO WALK AROUND ON DOES FUCKING EXPENSIVE SHIPS THAT WE GRIND LIKE A MOTHERFUCKERS FOR. \nI'm just asking out of curiosity for a friend.
The main problem FD have here is the impatience of the general public. Give 'em a rest guys.
So if I find a thargoid base the location will be saved at the codex?
All promising content reveals. My hope for ED is that it continues to grow & is supported through the next couple generations. The foundation/the palate to paint-upon, is there. But like the 1st explorers of our galaxy, we must find a patience within us that keeps our desire for it all, at bay, as to not cloud what already is there.\n\nIf you can find that place, you'll enjoy ED for what it is currently, while having realistic dreams about what is to come. \n\nWhich looks like an Alliance fleet & more dynamic planets (Yay!).\n\nQuality of life improvements on the core gameplay, especially to and from distant destinations, will help immensely. Like Galnet Audio.\n\nSimply listening to an engaging story about the Guardians, Thargoids or the Human race would be quite enjoyable while frame shifting through the black. We've all experienced reading something hud-related, only to be interdicted or miss a signal. I think the audio concept will eliminate that possibility while simultaneously keeping the player engaged. Not to dissimilar from driving today-Keep the eyes on the (neutron) highway while filling the ears with information.\n\nAlthough not mentioned, any HUD customization options Frontier could make available to consoles, would be greatly appreciated. I enjoy the orange aesthetic! But once saw a PC commander with bronze colored shield rings...and it looked SO right. Just a thought/suggestion.\n\nThank you for creating Elite dangerous and continuing to support it. It truly is a journey.\n\nSincerely and Respectfully, \nCommander Voltron IV (xbox)
Wow, could you guys have more obviously stolen ship ideas from Star Citizen?  The Chieften?  Wow, looks like a cutlass to me with a CONSTELLATION cockpit...  I love this game, but don't start getting cheap and lazy now...
Thats gOOD! space legs can w8!
It's great to see continued support for this game,  great work guys.  Ps4 player
Sorry, expand what narrative? Maybe I missed it in my many hours of playing the game. I have yet to see any in game narrative. The player is dropped into the middle of nowhere with no direction given and if you never search the net you would have no clue as to what is going on in the game. So I ask again, what narrative are you planning on expanding?
Do you want to know why multicrew is not as successful. You can not have fully crewed ships and wing up that was what most of us was wanting. Friend wants to join your crew sorry I'm in a wing WTF? This is where Elite messed up from the beginning and why most big groups left at the beginning. No groups or guilds is what hurt the the game the most and should have been the focus for release not years down the line.
Why is the volume always so low on these videos?  Nothing else on YouTube requires me to turn the volume up to max on my PC!
It's a bit unexciting.
I think Elite Dangerous could be open to improvement almost indefinitely, rather like what we see with WoW (graphical updates would be easy to implement, likewise the UI).
tbh, i only want 2 things from ed atm; i want at least another 10 yr on the jump range of my python, and the ability to equip at least one fighter. of course, that would shift the python from, arguably the best ship in the game, to, undisputedly the best ship in the game.
Alliance has no rank so we wont be grinding ive already grinded for the cutter and corvette fully engineered i will grind no more but thats me im over grinding. And that was one hell of a grind to do all that. And i did it all legit.
Extremely pleased with the revival of the Krait. Chieftain looks like a beast too. Get a wriggle on Frontier, I need these two in my fleet.
Wow. Devs your doing a great job on a great game, can't wait for 2018. Keep it coming, the commanders are eager.
Will players be able to pilot the carriers or just set jumps to certain fixed locations? Will they be able to engage carriers in PvP like 2 capital ships deploying fighters against each other or just keep them as mobile bases for easier access to common effort goals?
i think we need more class m planets ,to boldly take on star citizen ,as there art work is amazing ,i think having more ships and planet art work is a drop in the ocean ,there is already software for that,but if elite can pull of landing on a class m planet ,and walk around finding materials ,etc,i would think they are cracking it,and taking challenges on.
I'm a bit concerned about what they classify as 'Narrative'..😒 Narrative is not a new gun or gadget for your ship, and 'narrative' is NOT seeing blocks coming out of the ground or dropping cargo and watching a ship change colour when it takes it on board. They reeally need to look up and re evaluate what theybare calling narrative here.. Lets face it, if any of the things i mentioned was the story in a game or movie, it would be absolutely ripped apart for its so called narrative. What they're calling a narrative here, makes the story in the first Destiny game look like Tolstoy in comparison lol
I remember a dev video when the game was about to release what most devs would love to see in the game... and 80% of them answered space legs, boarding, walking around stations etc... 3 years later we have nothing and not even planned for 4th year...  Another thing is where the hell are the atmospheric planets? The rocky planets you have shown... we already had beautiful planets in the game before you nerfed em to the bone (most likely coz of consoles) you know?\nAnd when comes to lifetime season pass honestly how should i feel? Paid much more for it than horizon cost, whole 2018 is gonna be free (ofc game fixing should be free) and who knows whats gonna come after that if there will be anything...\nBTW group missions should have been out with wings update long time ago...
Well so no major announcement... Still grinding in a huge empty nutshell...
2018 sounds like it is going to be more interesting than 2017!  Looking forward to it.
Another year and you still can not get out of your ship and walk around.
GalNet pictogram (star) is like as Thargoid interceptor :)\nAnd in general this star has 8 rays, but in animation only 7 rays.\nWhy?
Haha this skinhead guy is so genuine sweet as he laughs and smiles all the way throu :D I love it!
WTF ever happened to the idea of being able to land on planets with atmosphere?  That went out the window 2 years ago it seems.
At this rate, SC is going to have some serious competition.
A question on the future squadrons and fleet cariers.if squadrons are group based and and fleet cariers bought by groups . how will they resolve the problem of groups that have pc/mac, x-box, playstation members as they dont show up in in friendlists or private groups.
Do we know what size the Chieftain will be? I've already got two endgame ships, I feel like the game needs more super high lever stuff.
I'm no scientist, but doesn't fog and vapour require atmosphere? We are landing on barren rocks....where's the fog and vapour from?
Nothing new here then.. No landing on planets with atmosphere. No real market between players, just two critical things which come to mind.  \n\nI think the lead designer is a classic example of talking the talk by the way he looks but there is no walk the walk.  \n\nThe game was effectively dead when they decided to implement it via p2p instead of the way every other mmo type game does imho, I said it at the time, got shouted down by fanboys as I will now no doubt but hey its your money,, keep buying them bobbleheads..\n\n:)
I'm enjoying reading all the comments and can't believe how awesome the game is coming along.  My personal push and shove to actually play the game is that we finally have 'THE THARGOIDS.'  I searched black and blue in the original Elite.  Now if only I didn't feel so retarded trying to actually play this new Elite I'd probably play it more.  So far I've installed it, got scared off by the tutorial and my brother couldn't believe how incredibly bad I was at it.  Which is a real shame as I'd love to be able to play it and join in.  Was happy to back it at a high level on Kickstarter and I'm glad that many fellow space gamers are enjoying the result. Great presentation and I think it's fantastic that Elite is being updated and enhanced without destroying the things that make it great in the process.  Essentially you can take all this great new stuff in or leave it and continue playing the game the way you like to play it.  ROCK ON COMMANDERS!!!!! It looks like Elite Dangerous is not going to go the path of EVE Online which is a great aspect indeed.
They should merge The Sims with Elite Dangerous. Having crew members, associates, competitors and enemies that procedurally generate personal narratives. Something that isn't spelled out but rather interpreted by the player.\nI hate the galactic simulation and the voting by grinding on these narratives as they call them.
Would love to see the the amount of NPC encounters in the game increased - too often you find yourself scouring the galaxy for a good amount of combat opportunities / waiting around in mining sites for a 'Wanted' enemy to appear - i want to see squadrons of 20 pirate ships from same faction appear on your scanner gunning for loot.
Okay no space legs.... but hot damn I bloody like what I saw and heard here... good job Frontier 👏👏👏👍👍👍
Let the Python carry a single fighter.
This was done really well and very professionally... Wow. It's almost like a talk show.
and the enginieer RNG still remain... what a joke !
I think I would have been happier if Elite was only now being launched.  Having bought the game and the Horizons pass Elite is only now beginning to be a full game worth the money. Hopefully it can attract  some of the players that gave up long ago to give it another try.
Ah thanks 3303 but I've already died in my vulture a couple of times, I'm gonna take a break.
Get rid of the dam warping mini game what a huge waste if time!!!
I waited over 20 years to play Frontier again!  Teenage years spent playing Frontier Elite 2 in UK it was a great game.  The one reason I bought a PS4 Pro was to play Frontier Elite Dangerous (the wife was not keen on a crazy priced laptop for one game!).  Now a 36 year old in New Zealand and still loving the atmosphere the game produces.  I sneak in about 4-5 hours play a week = not much but it's time well spent!  Thank you Frontier for a quality product.
Who knew all this time that a thargoid sound was made from a bass clarinet
I'd like to see additional surface vehicles, and outfitting for them as well.
A Ship launched miner would be awesome with multicrew !
They are improving a bunch of core game mechanics such as better multiplayer interaction, improved exploration(I'm hoping this means they are adding more variety to procedurally generated nebulae and maybe even improving known nebulae) improved planetary exploration, better engineering, the type 10(what do you expect it to look like? Obviously it's gonna look like the type 9 it's a part of that series). They have gave you a reason to grind rank for the alliance, and obviously some bug fixes. So now they can work on either atmospheric planets or space legs. Or is there gonna be a problem that is just you and not the game? (Don't say I'm saying the game is perfect)
exploration carriers that can scan several light-years and give the probability of life in the systems it scans?
why are these expos always so cringe? why are they always so nervous? everyone is there for the same reason so relax and have some fun, especially the audience! The host had to work so hard to keep it intact... if your at the expo then maybe you should all be jumping out of your seats and be excited, it would put the developers at ease more and its a lot less awkward to keep telling the audience to settle with humor than having to encourage them to clap??? what is wrong with this world these days??? Why is everyone wound up so damn TIGHT? chill out, laugh, relax, its a game, not a un summit haha
I wonder if the planets I have already explored will appear in the codex. Also loving all the content. I think i'll drop a few £ in some cosmetics to make it clear. The way I see it my expansion pass is pretty much payed in full already.
Amazing narrative? You mean the bland blocks of text you call Galnet, amrite?
Why is it taking so long to overlay a simple optional wireframe grid on a planet surface, to help with navigation when it's dark (or for bad weather)? Even films as old as 'Alien' managed to portray that!
Thanks for that FD!
Cmon,i just need to know where the Monolith is and how can i see the You Win Screen at the End of the Grind(Game).
I'm only watching this because I like Sandy!
I really hope that the trade changes don't just come with stuff to make it easier, but also balance it out to make it more challenging with markets that respond to player action. So like, when some one or a group discovers something lucrative, there's a limited amount of farming they can do on that market before profits drop, so that a good trader will constantly be on the move looking for the best profits
The amount of RNG in engineer mods in the game right now. If those personal narrative guns are as unique as told, then they worry me a lot....
бла бла бла .. где бл... ноги ?  ноги где ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just give us atmospheric planets that we can land on and I’ll be happy... thanks bye
No Panther Clipper?
I really like the game and bought horizons today. What i really don't like is the fact that i have to pay for a simple jacket for my hologram and ship skins after i did pay €65  (77$) total for the game. I could understand that if it's a free game to play but this is just greedy.  Even the deluxe edition give some free skins and i did pay more cause i already bought the Mercenary Edition. Pay some respect to your customers and give them some skins and goodies for free.
Spess pinecones.
ALLIANCE SHIPS NICE!
YEAAA BOOiiiiii~~~~  *cringe*
Cool. Galnet audio (no sarcasm).
Branching mission tasks someday with decision nodes ?
Elite: Dangerous = heavily slept on game
Sandro likes trex jokes???
MAKE POWERPLAY FUN (AGAIN, NOT)
SPLENDID! <3
👌😊
I got the feeling that ED's roadmap presentation is like watching a Microsoft keynote.
I've got one thing to say to the Devs, grinding is not game play.
Personal narrative = massive grind
I can picture the q4 release already. It won´t come in q4 2018, but hey... they didn´t explicitly say that it´s not going to arrive in 2018... so... they are still on time... I really enjoyed how the game started. Especially the amount of insight FDev gave us into the dev-process. but now, their newsletters are basically galnet, new cosmetics and a picture of a child touching a hotas. I miss when they actually seemed to do something :-(
Very excited for Elite in 2018! Thanks FDev!
In other words, no need to come back to ED before Beyond update.
I really hope the exploration update improves jumping.  It's the exact same particle effect with the exact same sound, which you get to watch a hundred times during a gameplay session.  It needs something to spice it up, or it should take 1/4th the time.  I understand it's doing the Stellar Forge thing as well as finding sessions, but systems can be optimized.
Hopefully the Mamba, Moray and Boa find their way to ED too.
I would like Galnet Radio to have funny fake ads like GTA radio stations
Just popped back on after half a year away from the game. Took a passenger tourist mission worth 2.5mil for a few hundred ly. The last visitor beacon was 250kls from the main star, so I pulled up the Steam browser and Googled Elitge Dangerous Sucks while I waited. \n\nThis game just isn't for me. Too little challenge spread across too much time. It doesn't really sound like that's about to change.
Please guys in 2018 we need be able to...walk everywhere! PLEASE!
Hum... maybe this new lighting of theirs will allow the Mac version to have planetary landings?\nThe main thing holding back a Mac version of Horizons was, if I'm not mistaken, a shader incompatibility in the Mac's OpenGl library, correct?
I feel like Q4 2018 will be the day ED meets a lot of the expectations people had when it launched. Can't wait!
Coming Soon.... The  Narrative Expansion
everyones excited everyones passionate .. but none of them actually play the game ...
Chieftain requirements-aquire rank legend in alliance navy. mission grind incoming!
again BLA-BLA-BLA(( Where CONTENT???
If those new Thargoids aren't called 'Angels' then there is no justice in the universe.
Too little, too late. Star Citizen's still in alpha and has more to offer in v3.0 than the glorified puddle of a game you've put together.
I take it we are going to have to pay for all these somehow? Cant say I am massively impressed. Where's the atmospheric planetary landings? Until we get that it just feels like half a game.

Oooohh so Kawaii!!!! I was wondering if you can make a cake (or anything) relating to the new My Little pony: movie. It'll be so cool if you can do like a pirate ship cake with Rainbow Dash's RAINBOOM!!
What’s the name of the song?😜🤔
Tip: if you change the background music it won't be that distracting \nLove you
I imagine this conversation at my birthday part\nMe: Hi guys! Guess what we are going eat.\nPerson: cake? \nMe: guess again.\nPerson: more cake? \nMe: nope. \nPerson: I am out of guesses \nMe: WE ARE GOING TO EAT PUSHEEN!!!\nPerson: but I am a vegetarian .-. I am crying inside
Super cute! Pusheen is a girl though :)

Question\nIs Pusheen and Totoro related?Cause they look kinda same
Brownie pop cool😊😊😊😀
I stand behind what I said about this movie, which is that I hated it. You don’t have to like a movie to do a tutorial on a look from it, & being that it’s the most popular movie right now, it would be dumb of me to not do a tutorial. Get over it 🎈
He got dragged by 14 yr olds on Twitter lol. I love the losers club ❤
brother** but ok _ wyatt oleff 2017
CLICK ON THIS IF YOU DARE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWO3_1wwG3c
Does anyone know where the costume is from or what the costume is called lol
Slow the frigggg down Jesus Christ . Pronounce your words . BREATH
You’re the reasons Stanley killed him self 27 years after you came
You should make a Halloween intro
Do you want to get shit faced and pass out? Take a shot Everytime he closes his eyes when he talks at the end of the video :))
How does it feel getting dragged by 14 year olds on twitter???
*HiYa SiStErS* if you don’t calm your happy hypocritical ass down Finn Wyatt drag this hypocrite
poor you, dragged by a 14y/o? shame. lmao.
Used this For views  much\nIF YOU HATED THE MOVIE  WHY DO A TUTORIAL ON SOMETHING U HATE
Your voice is so annoying, do you ever shut up?
This looks a lot like Glam&Gores video.....
You hate the movie, and I’ll hate this tutorial. It’s a win-win, sis!
honestly wtf no stop, you were legit just hating on the movie and got dragged by a 14 year old because of it. Just stop. Let’s not do this.
why does he speak so fast
idkkk with all the drama going on this look is too good to hate on it ?? 😍😍
Get dragged by a 14 yr old
Would have been cool to see some effort put in, this a usual cut crease IG look with Pennywise's markings, no thing grey eyebrows and since when has penny wise had winged liner and false lashes? Also, credit the artist of the music you used maybe?
BF says Looks like he wants to float one into my ass
People need to chill and stop being butt hurt because he didn't like a movie lol. Smashed this look! I need that new morphe palette like last year. Can't seem to find it online anywhere?
yes, i love all of the losers club, but leave him alone. he can cosplay whatever the fuck he wants. hop off.
I`m not even kidding a Finn Wolfhard commercial came up in the middle of this video with him making a STRANGEWICH. Also JAMES CHARLES IS A FREAKIN HYPOCRITE (GET SOME HELP!)
i love how he got dragged by two of the movie's actors
hope u get dragged by more 14 year olds
careful.\n\nyou might hurt the feelings of little 13yr olds who can't handle criticism
so what if he hated the movie? WHO GIVES A FUCK? today EVERY single youtuber is filming videos for views thats about the same populer subject at the time , this time its the movie IT ,the only diffrent is that James said his opinion in public, thats it. just him give brake. btw that make up is sick AF
Could you pin this
1 word for you............. don't
He is *Like*  *Penis* -wyse
God, creating a look inspired from a movie you said you hate is so fucking desperate, hypocritical, and flat out rude.
The introduction is so freaking cringe**cringe warning**
i wouldn't have the patience to wash this off
Just gonna day you didn’t even need to make a god damn tutorial, you already look like penny wise so, you should be already floating bitch!
Soo whats with everyone saying *time* and its already awful. Stay tuned for updates or Attention whore isnt it Famewhore??
Pause at 0:11 -me when someone takes my pizza 😂
Ok people I get it. But if you don't like he's tutorial go away and let us enjoy he's talent.. btw. I hate the scary movie It but love your tutorial...
At least you’ve finally given credit to the artists who’ve work you had stolen👍🏻
i live for your makeup tutorials
People actually like this guy wow.\nHe hates the movie yet does a makeup tutorial of it because it's popular sounds like some money making scheme to me
Glam&Gore has a Glam Pennywise tutorial that is probably better than this
What did he say at 2:03? He talks really fast
Please swallow
please, just fucking stop. <3
He is gorgeous!!!
Hunty what you doin 😭
He talks so fast!!
I like it
what kind of buffoonery
Should have done flashback Mary lmao jk
Don’t ever disrespect pennywise again
Ok he doesn’t like the movie but is it really such a BIG problem that he’s doing a makeup tutorial? It’s really not that deep? If he doesn’t like the movie, he can do a makeup tutorial if he wants. He isn’t obligated to like a movie that everyone else does? So immature half of you lot 😂😂😂
Really nice vid ☺
HIYA SISTA
bicth
OMG BYE
Fix the microphone
okay y’all need to chill kk . james didn’t like the movie.... okay people what is the problem if he doesn’t like the fucking movie and makes a tutorial in honor of the new movie which so many people are going to be for Halloween . James is helping👏you ! He is providing an AMAZING makeup tutorial for you to enjoy , he obviously cares about his fans \nchill pls . How about other people who are making tutorials on pennywise and disliked the movie they can be desperate for money
I don’t understand why this is a problem? He is a makeup artist and if he likes a look from a popular movie that he knows many people will want to be for Halloween then why wouldn’t he do it? Yah he will be making money but that’s because YouTube is his freaking job!! These days people literally reach so hard for drama... chill
mmm but stop tho
its littttt!!!
What kind/colour of contacts are you wearing? They look amazing!
I N S A N E      WOW HOW DO YOU PULL OF SUCH A LOOK AND STILL LOOK SEXY?!!!!!
I love James Charles😂
IMAGINE, if this video got demonetised after all this shit on twitter 😂
You might as well turn the comments off cause everybody in here is roasting your hypocritical dumb ass😂😂
this was obviously requested so he did it, y'all are reaching and so extra
I'd rather float than like the video
5 minuets in and this tutorial is awful stay tuned for updates.
There was an ad with Finn Wolfhard right before this video 😂😂🤙🏼
How come before I watch James’ vid there was a cover girl commercial 😂🤷🏼‍♀️
is it supposed to be hot ????
one thing's been annoyin me 4 agesssSssSs! his eyes! get some natural contacts boy!
You fought with 14 year old online...you're an adult. You should just delete this video to resolve the conflict.
Good job James way to do the same tutorial as every other beauty YouTuber 😂
doing something that you dont like shows that you literally only do things for views
Well stop being a hypocrite
You are so pretty
annoying and irritating as fuck
pennywise meet georgie georgie meet penywise..............hi guys im samantharhose im 9 years old please like my comment beacause my birthday is tommorow
That's my babbyyy 😍❤
Beautiful!
You talk fast
flashback mary is shaking
SIS, IT DONT ADD UP!!!!????
Ew. You disgust me.
Your getting fatter 😫
kmn
I'm discussed
Those eyebrows tho 💞😭👌💙
disliked
omg u speak too fast
noooo. don't fucking ruin pennywise you fucking asshole
0:17 triggerd
I'm glad someone's saying something about how bad the film was because that is not an often stated opinion and it should be heard but why then do a makeup tutorial based off of the same film? If you hate it, why give it more publicity? Money purposes? That's pretty shallow if that's the reasoning behind this video (which it probably is). If not,  I still don't know why you'd spend time creating something that you hated. Great makeup and costume, though!
Worst pennywise tutorial i have ever seen😵
You talk to fast lmao breathe 😂💗
Y'all 13 year olds are fucking idiots. He's ONLY doing this for the money to come with the video. He doesn't give a single fuck about anything
It's really amusing that americans get offended by this, while europeans love it. This is pure rock 'n' roll. A drunk former rock star who lost his once great voice screaming like Johnny Rotten and forgetting the lyrics of a song by his own favorite band, then inviting a random girl up on stage to sing and then ending everything stage diving. This is pure punk rock. Not some americanized plastic crap like Green Day.
Legend has it liams still crowd surfing
Liam the last fuckin rock and roll star!
It's alright, he was just fuckin' drunk 😂 It could have been perfect if he was sober. But it's not THAT embarrassing. People act like it was a huge tragedy ... don't be too serious pals!
Liam didn't remember verse, chorus of the song, or He just don't give a F***? Legendary
Sucks up to the godsmack version tbh
not got 20 seconds in and I know this is this dogs anus......proper internal shit exploding everywhere.......NO NO NO NO NO NO
I love that Liam doesn't give a shit and holds up the lyrics. Artists eventually need this is, esp when you're not singing a song you wrote or are use to singing
Good ol' Liam kills his own songs n now butcher's others too! Legend Not!
Oh my god! Thanks Liam for that.
This is a real awesome fucking amazing shit!!!!!
The best rockers of the past 30 years.
This was completely improvised i guess and that's why Liam couldn't do the lyrics. It was interesting though.
Liam Gallagher should make this into an actual cover song. And record it with Foo Fighters and Joe Perry from Aerosmith.
All that talent onstage...\n\nOh & Liam
1+1+2=3
Great Britain kick them together
Jesus loads of people fuming in the comments, what a legend Liam is
Trow that damn mobile phones away can't see nothing....
His voice can't hit those power notes anymore.  Too bad...
Sorry to say it but Liam totally messed this song up.
Liam is a terrible singer
Who is the girl?
Didn't expect him not to know the lyrics tho.. no hate, it's just a fuckin jam who gives a shit but it did surprise me, he claimed to idolize lennon, I would barely call myself a Beatles fan and I know at least the first verse cos this is a banger
get a life liam you never have and never will write or sing a song as good as any beatles song... it's a shame but also a fact
Somehow this is still amazing even though liam fucked the words lol
Epic moment, The Legend Squad !!!
Weak out of tune wtfs happened to the voice of a generation just sounds tired shouty and naizily
reading the lyrics of his favorite band?going to a chorus at the start where it should be another verse?Getting the words wrong in the first verse?being out of key?And then resorting to pulling someone out of the audience to finish it for him, and as shit as she is shes still better than him?\nI wouldnt have my hood up, id have a bag over my head.Fucking joker.
Fucking rubbish. Useless cunt. He doesn't even know the arrangement of the song nor does he know the lyrics. Look em up before you stone island fans start spouting shite. The guys a fucking knob end no wonder Noel fucked off. At least the brains he had went to his head unlike his semi-retarded brother.
That’s not pure rock n roll - that’s pure embarrassing
Golden! Golden!... Liam knows what are the good things of life hahahaha
I think I just saw Liam Gallagher's ass crack.. \n-Dave Grohl
Foo at city stadium next year hope Liam comes that has to happen my home town will shit itself
Liam knows that FF concert is the only thing on the world you can do that. Biblical.
supposedly a big beatles fans... doesn't know lyrics to one of their biggest songs XD
Dave grohl went to the back because of embarrassment or rock n roll?
If he wasn't smashed out of his face and he had autoque on so he didn't forget the words and that irritating woman wasn't there this would have been even more amazing...even doing this half hearted his vocals are brilliant and it suits him even more than lennon
Super-great! But short pants are so passe
It would have been biblical if Joe Perry had knocked Liam out with his guitar.
O Liam é bom demaaais! É puro rock and roll, ele vive a música, quando eu o ouço eu sinto a força de um verdadeiro rockstar entrando pelos meus ouvidos
Wow Liam is Rock n Roll.
Shame that twat Laim is in it
If he just came out there and sang it properly and pretented to be a decent frontman, I would probably just watch it once and never again cos these guest performances are boring anyway. But I swear I have watched this like 50 times already and it's also so much fun reading comments of people complaining how pissed off they are with this. Why do people take music so seriously? It's just entertainment, nothing more. The dude was obviously having fun. And by the way, Lennon doesn't give a f**k what's going on here cos he's dead!
I was there... Liam is such a fuckin toolbag
So some douche bag comes up and talks in the mic ... doesn't sing.\nAnd this gets 1K+ thumbs up?\nLOL!\nFU
Nice video thanks for sharing. please visit my channel for more videos like this \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6xNtP6pnfXXXXp7cvSTOw
How any one can watch this and not realize how badly Liam butchered both the timing of the lyrics and the lyrics themselves is beyond me
Mic cupping like a pro, Liam really fucked this up
Shorts and a hoodie? How old does the twat think he is? And he can't reach the high notes. And I don't care how hard he tries, he will never be Joh Lennon.
Think what this needs is another guitar

Liam reminds me of a softer version of Phil Anselmo in this.
Totally awesome, the best of USA and uk united on one stage.
Liam can't sing like he used to. How voice sounds like an old man trying to do a Liam Gallagher impersonation from the 90's.
Best part is I was there and HOLY FUCK trust me when Joe Perry got on stage\nI punched my friend in the arm and said This is gonna be fuckin AWESOME!
Why is he reading the lyrics it's a beatles classic?
The funny thing is ppl here worried about he fucked up the lyrics. Hahaha.   LIAM.  A FUCKING LEGEND
When random crowd chick knows the song better than dude from one of England's greatest rock bands
Its a mash up but I liked it.   Not about getting it spot on exactly; having a good time is more important.
I love Liam but i'm seriously disappointed in him for fucking the lyrics up!!!
Oof how the mighty have fallen. He's too old to be doing the trainwreck dance. Be more like Noel. Classy, cocky, confident, delivers.
People taking Liam too serious are either Americans or boring.
It’s the 2nd coming....
this thing is a total nonsens haha
The video cut it off but right after this Grohl was laughing his ass off and just said into the mic yeah THAT was planned
Fuckin love it
This is fuckin awesome
Off guts ? Or just plain shite
Bem Loko!!!!
Holy shit
Over Dave. Over Joe. Over Taylor. Over Everyone!
Liam! The best
Liam is back... LEGEND
Liam is pure gold
crowdsurfing yeah!
Zero Fucks Liam
tan Liam <3
Liam fucking it up again.
gostosa
Jeesh look at all the sycophantic comments! Cringe.
Wrong lyrics!!!!
HOLY SHIT
Hahaha
Manc cock
Did Liam get back alive tho????😐
In Love
Iconic
Hi
This is my favourite Beatles song...\n\n\nShame Liam sung it
Für den Musikexpress ist es Fremdschämen,für uns ist es Rock n Roll...
Warum ist dieser Sänger so beliebt? Es ist eines der bekanntesten Songs der Beatles und er bekommt es nicht auf die Reihe sich den Text zu merken steht auf der Bühne als ob er ein Stock im A.... hat.
Dude he's obviously drunk probably just wanted to chill with the guys he's good friends with dave.  I've heard this song a hundred times and can't remember the lyrics.
Liam Gallagher: Claims to be a massive John Lennon fan, doesn't know the words of Come Together smh
Looking at some of the comments on here - I just sometimes think not all Americans 'get' Liam Gallagher - in Britain he's like a God (for my group of friends/family anyway growing up!) loads of people commenting calling him a douche-bag or whatever - I don't think they get it - it's just supposed to be abit of fun and the guy was probably tanked up and just having a laugh with the crowd-surfing etc - long live the greatness that is Oasis! X stay young, love forever and don't look back in anger ;-) X
THIS IS ROCK N ROLL, SHIT MORONS
Careful with the chicks Liam, you’ll get in trouble again.
Omg he doesn't even know the lyrics, he is supposed to be a big Beatles fan 😅
That was Koranic.
Liam ist ein riesen scheiß Idiot.
I'm allergic to most sunscreen 🙄 I only have a couple chemical ones that I can use otherwise I break out in bright red itchy bumps. It's obnoxious. I JUST WANT TO PROTECT MY SKIN
I never understood why my sons skin always turned purple when i applied sunscreen ...now i understand why ............my son is Tongan so does have slightly darker skin ..so now i just gotta find the right sunscreen for his skin tone
I need cover FX to get it together ASAP. I want to try but I refuse to spend my money on defective packaging. I needed this video on SPF.  Thanks Jackie!
I can really relate, that’s why I stopped using sunscreen. I bought the Sheshido spf and looked like a GHOST! Crazy thing was it was a  sister who recommended it to me BUT she’s really light skin.
Titanium oxide is used as a white pigment used in things like paint, so it's bound to turn you into a 👻
I use Mary Kay day solution and it’s spf 35. I mix it with my moisturizer and it’s AWESOME!!!
I was literally saying to myself, I wish Jackie had a tutorial on sunscreen for dark skin. Then this happened. #Queen
About a week ago! *dab*
Girl... What do you use to slay your edges?
I'm glad somebody is talking about products that ball up after and during application. I've gotten this with a lot of moisturizers.
how do you reapply sunscreen over a full face of makeup? i know you have to reapply every two hours and i bought a setting mist from supergoop with spf but it sUcked so there goes that. so yeah, any tips would be appreciated
Honestly these are so overpriced. I only use Korean SPF products at this point because it's so much cheaper and basically the same quality. They take their skin protection seriously!
jackie bitch you literally have me fucking crying oh my god
Do you use sunscreen on your body every day too? And if so, do you use it everywhere or just exposed areas?
Every sunscreen I use breaks me out so bad. I just gave up lol
LMFAO this video had me laughing so much. they just clock out early, you kill me, Jackie. 😂
Your head wrap is hella cute! Give us a Tutoria!!!  Please ☺️
My friend is really pale there's a big difference when she wears spf 30, 50 and 100.
Jackie's little intro song is the only one on youtube I enjoy lol
THANK YOU. my friend never uses sunscreen bc she said she’s black she doesn’t need it and I’m like girllll, it’s not just to prevent sun burn 😭
I have worn sunscreen everyday, non-negotiable since I was 12. The way my hyper pigmentation and acne scars are set up I can't take the chance of going without it. Currently swear by the Elta Md spf 46 which my latest dermatologist highly recommends.
i saw you mention the benefit dream screen sunscreen in a video like a year + i bought it like a week afterward + ive been wearing it ever since! u know that i always listen to aunt jackie lol
Hi Jackie. I’ve been using sunscreen since I was 16 and I’m now 28. You should try Supergoop “Refresh Setting Mist Broad Spectum SPF 50”. I’ve used it for a year now and love it. I use mine mid-day after my morning SPF degrades. It’s great because the sprayer prevents you from having to rub in pollutants and makeup when reapplying SPF AND the magnifying is THE TRUTH!!!!!!
When you said, Did you forget I was Black or I about FELL OUT 😂 You are amazing.
The coverfx packaging is TRASH!!! I’ve returned a few of them to Sephora!!!
the thick formula of sunscreen makes me breakout ;( so I only wear BB/CCcreams with spf
So happy you made this, but is it just me or is the link to the chemical ingredients of sunscreen not in the description box? I really wanna know which to avoid and such.
If you want inexpensive but AWESOME SPF options, order some Korean or Japanese ones from Amazon. A lot are clear/gel formulas so you won't have a white cast.
I never miss a Jackie Video, this is what I watch in the morning when I work out.
Needed this !!!! Thank you xx
Well just snatch my edges why don't you Jackie!!💗you're the best! I so 💘 you!!
I love you jackie😂😂😂 I've been telling my fellow melanin sister's to use sunscreen  for years and I always get the side eye. Look after your skin people coconut oil is not a viable sunscreen🙄
Thank you sooooo much for this video Jackie!!! The only sunscreen I’ve ever used that didn’t cause the chalkboard look is Hawaiian Tropic sheer touch.
Auntie Jackie please review the cats pajama's palette by Laura lee. It seems very suspicious to me that I haven't seen a single negative review on it. She also seems to have only sent the palette to her close friends and really small YouTube accounts that wouldn't dare give it a negative review since they  would probably like to get on other pr lists. Idk it just seems suspicious since the searches don't seem very good and even the looks don't seem that good but the people who have tried rave about it. I need a trustworthy person aka auntie Jackie to review it
I always find myself going back to murad invisiblur but good lordt it is pricey
Woowww let me take my notes while watching this vid. this was so helpful!
Aunty Jackie 😩😩😩why wasn’t this done before the summer started 😩😭sis this could’ve been SOO useful 😭
Please review E.L.F new products. There's so many I'm interested in but afraid to buy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for this video!!! My mom unfortunately passed away from skin cancer and she was always SO careful in the sun. You are absolutely right, cancer doesn't discriminate. I really appreciate the work you put into this! So much love! 😙
I like the missha suncreams since they have high spf levels, don’t break the bank, and are a combination of a physical and chemical suncream
She's a veteran but she's also not trying to break a nail - why I love Jackie 😍😂
This video was a gooodseeend thankyousomuch!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My favorite daily sunscreen + moisturizer is Formula 10.0.6 Picture Perfect Day! It's only SPF 15 but it smells good and feels great! It doesn't make me greasy either.
thanks for this helpful and important video! dark skin people don't need spf is the dumbest skin care myth ever and i still see people perpetuating that ignorance in 2017. just because our skin doesn't turn red & peel off from going outside to check the mailbox (like white ppl) doesn't mean we're immune from UV rays!!
also do you have lash extensions or are you just that blessed? i'm in love with your lashes ♥
As far as the cast tacha causes. I'm a medium light skin tone. And that type of SPF makes my skin look weird too. So I think that type does that to everyone...  except maybe porcelain skin lol
Tip to all: You might want to take a daily vitamin D supplement if you're wearing sunscreen everyday. It's easy to become deficient in this vitamin if you're minimizing all sun exposure, especially for darker skinned people. Sunscreen is so, so important for everybody though.\n\nThanks for this video Jackie, I need some of that bad and  bougie Murad sunscreen in my life now.
OMG my friends and I used to send each other the Big Miss Steak picture all the time when we were in high school 😭 I miss them aw
Thanks for doing this Jackie!
I loved this video!!!! So so so informative and I really learned a lot.
La roche posay are famous for their sunscreens in Europe. It is a French pharmacy brand. Maybe worth trying out for some drugtore sunscreens?
Jackie Jackie Jackieeeee Living for the outfit Jackie!
guys just bash your head on the keyboard and see what comes up:\n\n\njackiejackieeekaklciiijackiieeejackiieeep[0\nicfhiodfikdddpio
Have you tried the Anessa perfect UV sunscreen aqua booster? It's great at mattefying :)
So do you moisturize, and then use spf or do you skip moisturizer?
I just learned there was a difference the other day in esthetics school. I need physical SPF, or I'll have to visit the ER.
i fucking love you
Wtf I thought the glossier sunscreen was soo much bigger, it looks so tiny irl when u hold it
Loving the new intro 😭
when you're as white as that tatcha sunscreen but is still watching
I get rid of my Hyperpigmentation by using potatoes by 2 weeks my face was so clear of acne scars etc. and it helped with my face texture that I had going on and I know this is some random comment has nothing do with your video lol . P.s I love all your videos Jackie !!!❤️
I love how much I learn from Jackie Aina's channel! She's so smart, funny and makes learning fun!! Now I'm on the market for an SPF
A Chemical sunscreen for normal/dry skin is Aveeno protect and hydrate SPF 50. And it’s only $10. No cast, it’s beautiful 😍
Thank you so much for this video!!!
OMGGGG the Alba Mineral Sunscreen is AMAZING !!! Absorbs in completely 😊
AUNT JACKIE!! I found the Benefit Dream Screen as a mini in a skincare set on Macy's website!
This was really helpful! I was in need of a spf for my face!
I love you for being that Auntie! 💖 You've inspired me to invest in an spf outside of my foundation. I'm a pale little cave-dweller, though, so I rarely see the sun. 😂
You’re hilarious and so positive! Love your videos.
I'm a manager at ulta the most recent benefit cosmetics training they sent us to. They had us try different techniques with the dream screen. Mixing it with porefessional before applying to the face is a dream!!!!! You can also mix it in with their triple moisture cream if the matte sunscreen is too dry for you.
Can you recommend a sunscreen that does not leave your face looking chalky and works for those who are allergic to chemical sunscreens? I have been using the Coola Mineral Matte(?) and like it , but it does leave me a little casper looking
Jackie you have to store the colourfx bottles upside down.
Also for everyone, I want to recommend that the actual amount of sunscreen you should apply is anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 a  tbsp, yes, tablespoon.  If you apply anything less than that you are not reaching the claimed protection your sunscreen offers. This is scientifically proven, i am not  sure why  Western brands don't give that kind of  information :/ . Sorry I don't have the sources right now but you guys can google it if you want confirmation :)
Jackieee what did you use to lay those EDGES THOOOOO??
I use the La Roche-Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral with zinc oxide and and titanium dioxide. The feel on the skin is great, and there is minimal white cast if any on my MAC NW20 skin. It's $33 in the US, and feels silky and not overly greasy on my dehydrated skin.
I'm pregnant, so I can't use chemical sunscreens right now. I'm hating using physical sunscreens. I'll have to try one of these after the baby is born.
I click like every time I hear Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackiiiieee, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!!!!!
What would you recommend for the Body?
she's a veteran, she's army strong but she's still also not trying to break a nail LOL
I love this video it’s so informative. I need to look better at these ingredients, 😂
😂😂😂 What's good YouTube Square up👊 Get them notifications together. \nI need some SPF in my life. I never wear any smh. I'ma do better lol.
Awww, is that Eggy you're wearing?! Jenn Im's clothing line? Loved the video Jackie! As always girl, you keep me laughing and informed! 😊
Oh shit I love Evelyn too!
Beautiful video! Would love it if u would have a peak at my channel and maybe like or subscribe to it.  I will be posting videos weekly!!
You don’t understand how happy I get when you start singing “Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie”😂😭
there is no such thing higher than SPF 50 , they can say its higher eg. SPF70 but its a lie lol
I'm a sunscreen girl everyday since I was 14 no matter what. People ask how I'd get my makeup to last all day and I swear the spf helps it to stay all day. I call it the original primer.
big miss steak 💀💀
What about Banana Boat? Lol
Thank you
Came here from Bretmen Rocks snap😛😛
You are awesome!
**SKIN CANCER DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE**\n👏🏾👏🏾 yasss aunty Jackie!
Lmaoooooo beetlejuice 😂😂😂😂😂😂 dead
Thank you Auntie Jackie!! #blackgirlmagic✨
Jackie!! you have me rolling lmboo!
Lmao oops I thought adding spf products together actually worked.
From my own experience, if you have sensitive skin, extremely sensitive skin, maybe stay away from the chemical barriers. I've had even the best break me out. CeraVe and Cetaphil make decent oxide/physical barriers where I c an usually  get them to rub in mostly clear. If you  use a powder foundation you can actually tent it yourself as well. It's not usually that deep for me lol
Is it weird that I set my sunscreen? It just helps lower the oily look and makes it feel better on the skin
Orange suits you so well! Love your channel! :)
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH  I don't care Tim McGraw buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*

Another amazing song by these 2.
Why the dislikes? This is amazing!
What a song and video it just reminds me of my parents who would have been married for 59 years, I lost my mother this past august, 7, She was a 26 year breast canacer survior two years ago they removed a her left breast,  but nothing else, This past April it spread to her Brain and lungs, My parents used to dance in the living room, while they would listen to old country, and plus your music as well thank you for this beautiful video <3
This is the first time I heard this song so damn good sooths the soul calms the heart and mind my all time favorite country singer Tim McGraw. Love your music
They are such an amazing couple.... they are so sincere.... so loving...so compassionate when they look at each other. They are the best country music couple. I have all of their music and even the Barbie dolls. They are the best
How I love this song!
These two are so beautiful together:) After 17 years with my sweetheart, we still look at each other the same way as they do. We'll grow old together, and when one passes, the other probably will soon after from a broken heart. He is my best friend, my everything. My true love
4 and a half years ago, I wasn't sure about The rest of my life?? https://youtu.be/CodlS_NDKXA\nThank you for the song.\nGod bless
What's with these country singers ? Loving their wives too much... Tim McGraw , Thomas Rhett etc..is it all real ?
Faith's voice sounds way better in this song than in Speak to a Girl, but Tim sounds weird at the end. And can def. tell Ed Sheeran co wrote this
Such a beautiful song! Great video too! Excited for the album to come out! Can't go wrong with these two!
Such a beautiful video 😭😭 they are so beautiful together! Always have been.. does Faith even age?!  ❤️
Wow well I guess I know what song will be played at my wedding for our first dance! <3 this is an absolutely wonderful song!
Beautiful song and beautiful video😄😄😄.Lol
I love the song, the video.. I don't know why they have to be angry all the time..  <wink wink> But I love the song. I can't wait to hear the rest of the album. Thank you Faith and Tim!

Now THAT'S the kind of love I'd like to find!    ....maybe someday.....
Two beautiful people that makes good music 💕and I enjoy the passion that they have for each other.
Ok - I need to tell my husband to sing to me like that when he walks into a restaurant even with our screaming kids and embarrassed teenager. That was amazing.
I just love this couple....

Eeeeeee
Beautiful !!!
My fav couple....❤❤❤
Just beautiful
I'm getting sick just watching lol
Looks fun
I'd smash
Was it just me or I swear that guy with the rope was trying to choker her.
Melafunkën
That was friggen awesome.
I would be so dizzy anyways she did amazing
She was a pro, I am sure it was not her first time. She knew how to avoid all the hassles to get of the wheel. I love her!
What if that rope got tangled around their neck
*Damn*
Wouldn't want to be thrown into the Hunger Games with her LOL.
Dude its Octoberfestbruh
even got some refugees in the picture - thats heartwarming
Someone's going to get choked by that rope.
0:39 LOL THEY GOT HIT OMG I CANT STOP DYING xD
Amazing
This is one of the Oktoberfest attractions that I would love to see as part of the bavarian village at London's Winter Woderland .
I would own that thing. I'd dodge every rope, deflect every swing from that pendulum, and maintain perfect central position, commanding respect as a God of the Wheel. \n\nUntil three seconds pass--then the puke starts flying.
Someone hit that later, right?
What are the ropes for?  It looks like a good way to get hung or lose a limb if it gets twisted the wrong way
Did she get free beer?
They had this in a fun house at Lakeside in Denver back when I was a kid. They'd stop it, everyone would climb on, then they'd start it up and gradually increase the speed until everyone was thrown off, then stop it again. It was pretty fun!
looks like something out of one of those saw movies.
I would do that any day. Looks fun
I bet she has the best cordination when drunk
She definitely has skills! Btw Themepark Review, meant to ask you if you've ever ridden a coaster at night & a bug flies into your mouth or face? This happened to me a long time ago but luckily I spit it back out. lol
How long she stayed on the wheel??
Just discovered a new fetish.
I seriously wish i can join this😂😂😂
Looks like fun! Is there a time people have to beat to stay on?
I'd probably throw up, but I'd quickly get another beer
Id be sick for days.
Can you imagine this anywhere in the US?.. No, and they all take it in their stride,  and the bow at the end,  to the crowd just wouldn't happen here.  Health and safety would go crazy.
0:20 I come to save the day boys! ;)
HAX
Drunkness Everdeen
Wow, great fun
WoW
0:20 nice
That was amazeballz ,,, lol
Wow
I believe there was one at Coney Island about a half century ago.
Fun!
Upskirt! Hahaha yeaaaaaa legs!
That looks so fun
She was awesome
comment s'appel se jeux ? je n'ai jamais vue sa en france 😅 on peut y trouver ou ?
Das Mädel ist ja mal der Wahnsinn! ^o^
This ride was in Coney Island about 100 years ago. Looks like a lotta fun though.
Oktoberfest is coming.... so. I don't like jokes about German sausages.\n--------------\nThey are the wurst.
That girl's hat got pushed off her head at 0:42! 🤣
Looks fun and all but I can't wait till the rope wraps around someones neck and makes a makeshift noose.
Time for some german pron
Think the blonde was more worried about her hat thats all the wanted 😂 I wanna go !
Drunk white people scare me.
Nothankyou
Thats look like hell for girls
Wow!
Ok
She’s so hot and sexy I’ll also smash
Recently I've been feeling distant from SVT bc of other groups' cbs and school etc. But they'll always have a special place in my heart because they got me into kpop. I genuinely adore every single member and unit with every fiber in my body😂 k imma shut up now before I start getting all cheesy and emotional
I think chan's facial expressions have improved a lot...
My bias in seventeen is\n\n\n\nSeventeen.
Me, when Change Up appears : Hell yes I am a loyal Leader unit stan\nMe, when Trauma appears : HIP HOP ALL THE WAAAAAYYYY\nMe, when Lilili Yabbay appears : GODDAMMIT POPO TEAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, me : Again, how to be loyal in Seventeen?
Also a challenge- watchh this video four times and watch one person without getting distracted by the others.
This is not our maknae. This is not *A* maknae🙈🙈Innocence has left the building. But forealz the dance is amazing and our Performance team went above and beyond like they always do, putting 117% for us😁 Congrats to the population of Carat's that survived this (Aigoo Minghao this thug coming after my heart😳)
i'd do anything to be one of those people lying on the ground with svt
The cameraman is also dancing
0:39 THAT PIGEON IN THE BACK

I'm not a carat but I respect Seventeen n salute whoever came up with the choreo
Everytime I watch this, I'm impressed at how good they are
This mv is basically ''how to be biais wrecked 101
i literally don't have the ability to stop replaying this video at least 20x a day

Dino just ruined my bias list like boy slow down your suppose to be the baby
Seventeen's been killing it more lately 🔥
I showed my friend this and she thought an orgy was about to happen

Things that are delightful in my life, some good damn moves omg! 😍💎
Jun and Minghao look sick like their faces are so oddly pace like no. at least hoshi and dino look semi-normal
Their dancing skills are on point. SO BEAUTIFUL!!!
Kinda getting some Michael Jackson vibes on some of the moves, I wonder who's ideas it is 👀
I ain't even a carat and I can't stop listening...\nedit: I am becoming one but damn jun's visuals
People still sleeping on the perf team. They snooze they lose.
I really don't know who to watch they're all mesmerising \nI've been watching this video on repeat since it came out and I'm never going to get bored by it
I am so determined to find me a boyfriend that looks like these guys. Why can’t we have boys like this in America?? 😞

Perf Unit: *casually lying on the ground*\nRandom Passenger: Are you ok? Can I help you?\n\nThe must have been kinda awkward to film\nFrom the background I'd say it's not in Korea
Yo as a very casual Seventeen fan can someone match names to faces for me!? Thanks!
i've been replaying this and the behind scene video for idk how many times, and all i gotta say is dINO PLS HAVE MERCY ON ME
Was watching the behind the scenes on vlive and googled the cross street. Carats, they filmed this in NYC! https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6931649,-73.9907007,3a,75y,119.49h,89.71t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stle-LZCUGV9B9Liaqc9ybw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656
I remember a few months ago, I applied for an application to be in a Kpop music video in nyc because they were looking for extras. and all it said was for major Kpop boyband they wouldn't tell us what group it was, so I was like ah ok a surprise, I'll enter anyway. So I applied for the position to be girl talking to friend but I didn't get chosen. and what do you fucking know... THIS WAS THE MUSIC VIDEO. I could've had the chance to be in THIS video and meet my babies omfg I'm shook
WHOS THE GUY WITH BLACK/BLUEISH HAIR
what album is this or will it be one ??????
Great tribute to a legend.
I love Brandon for always paying homage to those that influenced him and came before him. I love all the music he always mentions and talks about. I guess I connect to him in that way. Great video and cover!
this made me so happy that they did this
One of my favorite songs sung by my favorite band. Awesome!
This made me cry...
Why I love music.....Petty was the best.
The Killers have always struck me as having Tom Petty and Heartbreakers' songwriting sensibilities (sure they may get a little more ornate sometimes, with Sam's Town seeming like an homage to Queen) and Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's energy. Flowers' voice forces you to focus on the heart before the head. He's got a gift.
don't really a fan, but they nailed it. #respect
Thank you for posting! Fantastic from a fan who is very fortunate to have see Tom and the Heartbreakers live many times in 3 decades. He would be blown away by this fantastic cover by such a talented band! Amazing...
And then segueing into Mr. Brightside. Perfect tribute
At least they're set will one good song
For a cover, it's pretty darn good! Huge respect to The Killers for this amazing tribute.
Watched this live! Great way to open to the show!!!! They should do this cover on their next Sawdust type album!!!
Such an amazing way to start a great set. So happy I made it out!!!
That was awesome, thanks so much! Beautifully done!
Respect TP, rest easy xx
I was there😊 they were amazing 🔥
Feels
They were absolutely amazing at ACL!!!!
Hi there,\n\nDid you shoot this video footage? If so, we would like to use it as part of an article on our website Radio X - http://www.radiox.co.uk and also  associated social media channels with a credit.  Could you please get back to me asap and let me know if this is ok? Many thanks!\n\nCrystal
The sentiment was lovely, but the result was awful. I've heard better bar bands---not that I expected the killers to live up to the musicianship of the Heartbreakers to begin with.
Free update and people are complaining.\n\nWow, please ignore them Frontier. A lot of us love the free content we are getting. Keep up the good work.
Where's the skyride
Looking forward to it, can’t wait! The devs do a wonderful job on this game, you’ll can be very proud of it. Thank you for showing my Pixel Island park in the community video, so cool! 😍🌎🎢
Would really like to see a water slide / pool dlc
PICNIC BENCHES!!!!
Unbeliveble what this Team fo us do. Thank you very much Frontier for your work and the next Update.
I love building theme parks thank you for this amazing game and congratulations for this first anniversary 👏🎢🎡
Picnic benches !! I want beach chairs ! LOL no this will be a cool update. Thanks frontier.
Thank you for continuing to bring us so much content for free! Fantastic team of devs!
In the future I hope there is a track drop coaster
That Adversary is going to be huge in my park wow the choices I have now lol.
My computer lagged the hell out when I opened Koali Beach.
Wow Yes! These updates are exactly what the game needed! But what is the 4th ride? Is it a coaster? Is it one of the best editions to the game?\n\nAnd when is this update coming out? ;D
Please make a bobsled coaster
You need to add planet coaster to console
i just have one more request can you awesome devs make another form of transportation like via water or ski lift(gandola) like Disney is currently building down in Florida
The only thing I need now is custom objects like on rct3 but you can make them from plantercoaster
I wanna see a condor type flat ride and spiral lift hill coaster
When they do waterparks... Imma buy that DLC right away. I love where this game is at already
Snakes? Did you say snakes?\n\nA standard. A symbol. Perhaps on a shield. Two snakes coming together... Facing each other! But they're one!
If you added a waterpark DLC, you could make a lot of money off of it.
Im exited for cascade, but a bobsled coaster is still something im waiting for fronteir
We need the infinity coaster sooo bad
Make a update that you can controle the age of the coasters and rides
I would love to see the Vekoma SLC, a Skyscraper Flat Ride, A natural Intamin Launch Coaster Like Kingda Ka, Stormrunner, and so on and a Coaster Train Like Intimidator 305
i really like the swastika ride
love it can't wait.. but will there ever be save path to blueprint ... that would be so awesome and would make it easier to snap an blueprint to the ground
Can't wait for the update, looks so freaking good:)
Can you please add a reguöar wild mouse, like the one at bakken in denmark
Thank you! I as just starting a greece area in my park and I was complaining all the time that there's no water coaster!
Am I the only one who noticed the Shroom ride arms being the shape of a Swastika?
id love to play this in VR
This update looks interesting. I think the updates to staff management may be a little too complex, but I'll give it some time to see. Tables are an awesome idea, now I can make a themed, sit down cafe. Some updates I would like; The ability to explore your park as a guest (could work with vr), Water transport rides and other transport rides, and maybe some way to incorporate a hotel.\nOne thing I like over RCT3 is that guests factor in the transport rides when navigating to a ride. One complaint I have is the fireworks placement and sequencing. I prefer the old RCT3 sequencer and being able to place generic launchers and just place the various elements in them.  \nThis game is still very addicting, so keep up the good work.
Just read the comments and I haven't played the game yet so obviously I can't relate to the complaints, but this is a pleasant surprise because I was considering buying it and this is a nice push into wanting to buy it even more, thank you Planet Coaster :D
I will cry when we see the day when they finally add motion simulators
Free stuff? I love free stuff! Thank you so much, Frontier, for continuing to develop the game! :) Still so much love being thrown into this game and your other big projects!
I'd love to see sit-down restaurants where you can customise the layouts of tables and stuff, and also picnic areas for parks (families sat down on grass and stuff) haha I know these are pretty menial requests, but it would add such a level of immersion
Wow, scenario editor. This. Just. Got. Real.
I don't get it, it's frontier's game, they do what they want to do with it, it's free and fantastic, thank you frontier for giving us free updates and we love your game,
Good progress, getting the management side of things up is needed .. I would love too see you  guys increase the AI interaction priorities, have guests stop and interact more with each other and staff in random ways .. more random AI animations like stopping to take photos ... also have them use benches more diversly, rather than just go to closest bench.  Everyone walking around in a giant heard like zombies feels a bit weird.
Awesome features! I'd love to see a weather system.
Very nice stuff, reminds me the Theme Park and Theme Hospital era.  The next game will be the Planet Hospital? xD
Looks great, not much content though which I'm hoping means they are working on a water park expansion behind the scenes ;)
I always love the free updates it seems like some cool content in this one! I will also pay to see WATER PARKs please!?
yo when it showed the gient robot Phix made i immediately went to the steam workshop to download it
When is the release
When is the update coming out
this should have been named the round of applause panel
What happened to showing us a roadmap for future DLC and updates? Overall, like most have been saying, I feel like this updates a bit lackluster. However, I appreciate the free updates, and hope they continue!
Just a quick thing, I find the white background behind the speakers distracting... it's far to bright... the best moment was transfereging from a video back to the stage with a nice black background.
It would be cool to see the addition of track drop sections & track switches. pretty damn cool so far though.
I hope the rode is going to be a intamin launch
Doesn't that Wise Horn Canopy ride normally have more Hills in the circle? It seems so flat here. I remember as a kid there being more hills.\nLooking forward to the ability to change cars on tracks.
Is that the Star Wars kid?
For the peeps upset about the content.. I'm sure theres more than they previewed here.  The 1 year mark for this game is a big deal considering what it started out as. I'm sure the PC Team have a lot more in store to mark it.  I'm really excited to see the adjustments to staff management.  I hope that trend continues and we get a much more in depth management system delivered over the next year.  In all honesty, the management aspect of the game needs a lot of love. There is so much potential there.  Lets hope the next 12 months see the game move forward even more.
WOW that water coaster so nice
Frontier is awesome! Best developer in years.
Planet Coaster, when will this Update be released to the Public?
I would PAY PAY PAY for much more content. I want DLCs, Addons, ... love this game :-)
I'd happily pay another $30 USD for Waterparks. Fewer assets than Animals and Safaris plus I'd go back to playing the game again.
Did I miss when they said a date for it? Since it's anniversary does that mean it's coming in November?
Does anybody know if - and if yes, how - you can change the map size in the scenario editor?
Planet coaster: I am a big fan of Carnival flat rides and I was just wondering why no one has yet created the Double Farris Wheel that is usually seen at fair grounds?
I'm so thrilled to see you guys have made it this far. Your game is great and you all should be very proud.
Who made planet coaster
REALEASE IT
Glass, Swimming Pools & lots of Scaffolding... That's what I want.
WATERPARK DLC
AW HEELL YEUUUS ❤\n\nSo excited :D
Scenario Editoooor!!!! 🍾🍾👏🏻👏🏻🎉🎉
S&S space shot next please!
Add swimming pools please
Audio?
OMG YES! Water Coaster! Side-Friction Wooden Coaster! Changeable trains!
Scenario editor!!! DAY MADE!
Frontier, well done!!
wann werden den echte Glasscheiben entdeckt,oder erfunden??
We need waterparks!! (I'm frensh)\n;)
go channel5gaming
I'd love to see functionality to make true racing coasters (synced-up parallel stations) or even functionality for track switches (taking cars off or adding cars to the track when rides get busy)
I first bought this game last year, and somehow didnt like it, and gave it back via steam refund. Bought it again this year, and fell in love with it.... was it me who changed, or did the game change that much?
Those interesting name of those rides! How do you guys come up with the names of them?
Okay, this would probably be a lot of work, but I had to get the idea out there before I forgot, anyway. \nMy idea is scripted live-action stunt shows, like the ones I've seen in every theme park ever. Wild-West shows, the pirate ship battle show, I've even seen a Batman one at Six Flags.\nThe base is a stage area, on which you can place scenery, and hired staff are actors in the show. You can create a script that the actors follow. Run here, shoot there, fall down onto airbag after being shot there... etc etc. I'm sure these guys could create amazing things with a tool like that in the game. \nAnd what park guest doesn't like to get off their feet and enjoy a show??\nI dunno, I think it would be awesome to see what people could create. The possibilities would be endless!!
I still hype this game its such a great game. I hope you expand it even more with more content such as country based stuff for example Japan themed content :D
I want the soaked DLC for Planet Coaster! ;P
Thank you so much Frontier for the staff management features! This is what I’ve been hoping for since I first heard about the game being developed!
With that matterhorn ride that is coming in the future, if I rode that in real life I would probably die from hyperventilation, because I would be worrying that I would run out of air.
I don't know if you guys will see this or not but I just want to say thank you so much for being, well honestly, the best dev team I have ever seen. You guys genuinely show concern about us players and that, to me, is the most important thing when dealing with consumers. Again, thank you for adding so much free content and showing the PC community how much you care!
That crowd is terrible! This people did all this work and people barely clapped! How dare they!
A couple of in game scenarios would've been nice.
You guys are doing such fantastic work after all this time. Thank you for bringing beauty and true creativity for tycoon games of this generation. :) I love this game so much and it has made me really get that enjoyment I use to have playing these games back in the day. Such talented and epic developers! THANK YOU!
Are We Finally Getting Dynamic Weather after the billionth ask?!
All I want is to be able to build on the train station grid!
Still waiting for a fully-fledged expansion pack like water parks, zoos, or even dark rides.
why can't they make planet coaster free?
Need more water park & zoo dlc like RCT 3.
First I want to make a shoutout to the people who are making amazing Planet coaster content but are really struggling to get heard. Usually these so called ''featured creators'' get the majority of the attention. Who came up with that? It only encourages elitism.\n\nOkay, 1 new flat ride, 2 new coasters, a staff management building, picnic tables, scenario's and the ability to place different cars on same tracks. \nI'm so glad this update is free because just like the spooky pack, wich wasn't free... this is basic game content.\n\n Take picnic table for example, Zoo Tycoon 1 already had this feature and that game is 16 years old...\n\nScenario's. About time... I know many park simulation games wich already had this feature at the launch of the game.\n\n1 new flat ride and 2 new coasters. The coasters are nice. But i've expected more in terms of flatrides and track rides.\n\nI like the staff building, adds more realism to the game.\n\nPlacing different cars on same track. Good, a feature which screamed to be added.\n\nIt doesn't harm to be critical and we should not applaud every nack they add to the game that isn't really new and innovative.
Can you guys down at Frontier make a feature where you can disable the ride lights or at least change the color? The lack of that option kinda limits the the themes you can apply to rides with permanent colored lights...
The coolest game ever \nBut I would like a PS4 version \nI don't know if it is possible but ...
This game has amazing art and graphics, but i get bored with it fast. I think RCT3 is still more fun than this boring gameplay. Also I think the theft and vandalism thing sucks and should be able to be turned off in the settings.
Daaaang. You can see Courtney Love really doesn't want Harvey there. She's just staying out of the conversation. She obviously know this man was trouble.
Ahh the paparazzi ... who said they were good for nothing? It's clips like this that keep on giving.
I just watched a minute of some one standing by a road
And the point here is?\nHere all there is is a Jessica Chastain starting her career, and a Harvey acting normally with his wife\nYou can interpret what you like but you will never know what really happened there
wow and based on her Twitter Jessica Chastain was supposed to hate Harvey... lol Jessica is so full of shit. I've gained so much respect for Courtenay for this
Courtney ist the one and unfortunately only woman who was self concious enough to say the truth about this motherfucker, while the whole american society was silent for years. Shame on all of you in Hollywood!!!
Lol... this video is actually getting more views now than when it was put out.
Notice how all the women who have been most vocal come from either Hollywood dynasties or almost aristocratic families. We have no idea how vulnerable someone like Chastain who seems relatively independent is in this world...
I'm curious how many new Weinstein's, Cosby's are out there and still doing their thing in Hollywood but people, for now, don't say anything
Chastain seems 1000% fine with Harvey and even hugs him here lmao
They're ALL animals.
Courtney love like,\nBye Felicia, Bye
Courtney doesnt look too thrilled.
Love you, C Love! Live Through This got me through puberty. Nice to know you were all about the sisterhood and weren't fake. Those actresses had to pretend to be interested in conversing with him for risk of losing work, Courtney didn't have anything to lose and has always been punk. Love this.
Are a list actresses prostitutes then?
theres a minute video thats 5 years old of someone standing by a road on 1. trending\n\ncome on youtube get your shit together
HONESTLY YOUTUBE WTF IS THIS ON NUMBER ONE TRENDING
Woah. A video on trending that has nothing to do with Anti Trump
Gross. Harvey may have raped some women, but think about the hundreds actresses who whored themselves out for movie roles and fame. Hollywood is so disgusting.
Two faced gold digging sluts Queens of hypocrisy.
Lmfao Courtney's side-eye at 0:12
What's the point in this? Like he's surrounded by women. Omg what a sinner
Why is this trending. Nothing happens, its just some people standing around...Fucking great!
Courtney Love is just like me, does not know how to disguise
Can someone do a Bad Lip Reading edit on this? Lol
Please tell me Chastain wasn't corrupted by the fat man??
0:22 when Harvey gets his cock out and starts waving it about - such a cunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou no you was looking for it though
Weinstein was the Poster-Child for the Clinton-Democrats.\nGotta help Bill keep on raping !
The video is from 2012, not recently.
How the fuck is this trending
Fake channel, that many subs + views, but only under 20 likes... get off of youtube if you cant be legit
Someone explain why this is trending? I know about that cunt and everything he’s done, but why exactly is THIS trending?
Yoo guys can someone explain to me what's happening?
Look at that one bitch auditioning for a role, the real position begins later that evening.
Why is this trending ? Also why had Jessica chastise got on the bandwagon
there is nothing shocking in this video, is there ?
Chastain is a shiksa whore, I'd bet good money she's willingly put Weinstein's dick in her mouth. Most of these hos slept with him willingly for parts, that's how jew run hollyweird operates.\n\nWeinstein isn't even the worst, there are scum like Bryan Singer who rape little boys.
WTF I see nothing!??
B
trending after 5 years?

Thats Amy Adams
https://m.youtube.com/my_videos
Obviously Weinstein is a pervert and a fuckin dickhead but I honestly can’t see anything wrong with this conversation. He gives a hug which is offered and puts his hand on Courtney loves back which is totally normal
#HarveyWeinsteinIsOverParty
https://youtu.be/RaTHjc0y3nM
Jessica Chest Stain
Harvey the goat
They all let it happen when they want awards/contracts and start crying when they don't need him anymore. Typical women. Doesn't change the fact that he's a weirdo and a pervert.
Breaking News: Women are whores - his wife was 30yrs younger FFS more @ 6
At this rate gynaecologist are going to accused of sexual harassment. I don’t know the guy or anything but hearing one of these victims say “he walked out of the bathroom naked but I still gave him a massage” raises my eyebrow. What your dumb ass doing in a rich mans hotel room. Wtf you expects going to happen. This world is getting out of hand.
We are coming for all you lefties. Your world is crumbling. :)
Chastain was wanting to be Harvey's star so bad. Such a lying hypocrite. Just like McGowan who says she was raped by Weinstein in 1997 but hugging him in 2007.
Looks live Courtney Love cuddles him there... i think thats sexual harassment and she should do 25 to life...scumbag
Harvey the Pig
He touched me
women are vindictive little cunts i hope harvey did rape them, hope thye suffer til the day tthey die!!
Would be a travesty if she didn’t win, she’s clearly the best by far.
“All my ladies you can do it. You can do it even better in broken heels” LOVE ALEXANDRA!!!!
Trending number one!! Slay
Wow #1 on trending
Good morning
By ccr not tina turner
Diva!!
Alex and gork, absolutely amazing, Sue 💞 🎶
great
https://youtu.be/6JYSrbqMUGg
She looks amazing !!
https://m.youtube.com/my_videos
Serious talent right there
This is everything 😚
The footwork is incredible
SHES GOING TO WIN!!!! 👑👑💕💯💯💯 trust me lol
I'm so glad Gorka got a good dancer this year
She’s an amazing dancer. But to pretend this is a 10 is misleading. She clearly has sickle feet. Aston (as much as I’m not a fan of his dancing, forcing as much hip hop moves in to the dance as possible), got railroaded for having pigeon toes. Not fair this was given a ten. But her energy was awesome and she is clearly the strongest dancer. Still a winner.
Sympathy vote...Dry eye cry wow, remember the same thing on xfactor years back.\nMy mum has passed away also, that would be my next move dancing on tv for money, in the spotlight.\n\nJoke how every tv programme has to have a celebrity part about it, pampered z list desperate for fame. Peoples lives that bad they have to watch this sort of stuff as entertainment. Much prefer the programmes if they had , nurses, plumbers, normal people on tv.
OMG I remember watching Alexandra win the X factor years ago when I was a kid! It's great to see her more!
THEY LOOK FAB! I'll be so upset if they don't win they are clearly the best
Do a good deed today and click the link to my video to help me reach 10,000 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO8EnOeMrRI
Song is by creedence clearwater revival...tina only covered it
John Fogerty was such a great songwriter.
She's so sexy 😍😍
Her legs were hypnotic! I honestly thought one of her shoes would fly off she was that slick and speedy!
That was amazing!! Perfect timing, excellent routine, choice of song brilliant - couldn't have been better!
Search reaction time and compare tal to gorka
Absolutely fantastic, said from the start Alexandra will go far, everything crossed she is in the final and wins it xx
Wow how fantastic was that well  done alexandra  and  gorka I loved it amazing
reminds e of Alesha and also Nathalie gummede    and all the fuss because shes ccouldnt t do her jive  to this song and she was the favourite at the time
Could she win strictly just like on x factor, WHO KNOWS LOL!
Great performance from Alexandra. I wish she’d return to music . I miss her amazing voice and music.
Alexandra deserves to win this series! That's only if people stop voting for Ken & Barby!
My Grandma is obssessed with strictly come dancing
It's impossible for me to watch this and not have the biggest smile on my face ❤️✨
How to get Spotify Premium for free on my channel thoooo
Who remembers the days when X Factor was better than Strictly ...
listen to my first song on my channel please🙏
Definitely Alexandra is my favourite - she dances like a professional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17W8y42oLzQ
good dance
Honestly, all these judges in the comments section are cracking me up!
Holy crap, she SLAYED that dance!! She looked like Gorka's pro dance partner instead of the Celeb. Favorite dance of the night ;)
For those complaining about the errors. Yes there were mistakes. But my god people dance is about artistry. This is a classic example of how performing with conviction can warrant top scores. Debbie is technically very good, but unless she works on her engagement skills will never be up there with the Astons and Alexandras this season.\n\nWell done Alex - one of my favourite Jives (of course Jay and Aliona's still hasn't been dethroned).
Not even in the USA version someone like her was found .. she's a star
Great dance. She is such a sexy girl.
Best dance of the season so far! Great to watch.
I think this takes the top spot for best ever jive on Strictly. Couldn't take my eyes off her, which is saying something considering that she's got Gorka at her side
wow \nshe looked like she was enjoying that \nchannelling Tina Turner with the legs!!!\nnot an ounce of wobble!😨\n#keepfitgoals
She's down with the swirl 😍😍😍
Absolute knockout....which i am glad Gorka hasn't been...he left too early last year,dancing with the wonderful Tamika!
Good but not a 10\n9's all round maybe.
NEW VID - We Should be Called Sideways FC Disgraceful Watford 2 -1 Arsenal youtu.be/Ry_5XiNnZ48 via @youtube #arsenal #ozil #coyg
😲😲😲😍😍😍😍 WOWWWW
Fantastic!!!!
This is bloody incredible!
Alexandra 2 win!!! 🏆🥇🙅🏾
Wowwww she smashed itttt !! She looks like a professional dancer.
This was epic!
i will sub anyone..who sub me..i wnt ur sprt..cmnt when u done...
Charlotte got kicked off , she was in a dance off with Davood
She's fab. At a slight advantage for being in musical theatre but people tend not to like hearing that
Is there a version of this clip that is better quality and NOT pixellated? You can't even make out the dancers, just shapes
Its a shame sumats going on backstage between Gemma and Alexandra all becous Gemma is sleeping with gorka noticed they are never at top with other celebs at same time sumts not right
Outstanding! I couldn't take my eyes off her xx
Wow!!!! what a dance,,, loved it...
42 persons are blind. Because this was absolutely amazing! It's impossible not to like this performance. She is phenomenal.
I watched this yesterday and my word what a danceeeeee FaB U lous  the fire the energy it took me back to when Alesha dixon was on the show...Alexandra is one to watch
Absolutely loved the dance, hated how people said she was crying crocodile tears.
Alexandra Burke fantastic work you did brilliant
I wasn’t ready for this, she honestly blew me away. I don’t even like this song but she made me enjoy it!
she's the ONE to beat! this performance was out of this world. and I wanna silence those who moan that she's had dance experience, she isn't a professional at ballroom. she's a singer and theatre star that doesn't equate to a ballroom experience, so shut your traps.
Amazing!!! Love that she's killing it..
First Class. A real treat to watch, thank you xx
Fantastic performance! Well done Alexandra Burke and Gorka Marquez!
Definitely the best dance of the night! Gorka did a great job with the choreography and Alex put so much effort into the dance! WELL DONE
I placed my bet on Anton, but I am ASTOUNDED at this phenomenon!!!!!!!!! I am in love with her personality
Alexandra needs to be in the final for sure
This was clearly the highlight of last night's show,  throughly deserved the first 10's of the series!
9 10 10 10 =39
OMG!
WOW!
yassss alex KILLS it!!!! i'm slayed
Better than ores, I thought those kicks and flicks were excellent and that whiplash was amazing, the energy came from nowhere, she might be the winner, that was outstanding, I said at home she was gonna be another Jay at the Jive and I was right (in my opinion) beautiful dance, your mum is proud of you in heaven, 10
Wow! So much energy. Alexandra's transforms when she is performing into a strong, sassy diva! Was so moved by her reaction afterwards. I really felt for her then. Your mum would have been so proud.
We found our selfs a winner
Brilliant but over-marked.
Am I the only one who's not a massive fan of this one? It was good but certainly not worthy of 3 10s.
I want her to win but strictly and dailymail have already decided to be Gemma. You can tell  by the way DM are trying to assassinate alexandra character and putting stories about her and gemma feuding over some guy.
Alex girl you absolutely killed this performance.\nWell done you!\nGiovanni what can I say choreography was on point as usual.\nPower house couple. \nOne of my favourite couples to win \nRouting for you both.\nKeep it up guys.😍😍😙😗😙👌👌👌👌👌
This was an ok performance but not worth the 10s given. Picking a winner at week four is both biased and a little premature.
She's been trained in dance before yet nobody's here moaning about that
Was her dress unzipped at the back?
I love how they don't tell her about  her footwork mistakes yet the millisecond Aston Aston foot is out of place they go nuts
Gorka's talent shines through the way Alexandra's dancing.
Here is your winner boys & girls and i tipped her from the very start.
I didn't like it...
She annoys me like hell. Just her face is hard to look at. She was acting stupid when she got the ten's, I wish my mum was here! and dramatically thrashing about like a lunatic. Yes, it's sad that she's lost her mum. I did sympathise at first. But someone normal who loses their mum wouldn't go on and on about it for attention on TV.  I was hoping she wouldn't be good, but there we go. She's won. The first couple to get a ten always wins. How sad.
I hate this show...it's so awkward and fake...
Luis Suarez scores late for a point! Griezmann to Barca in the summer for 100m € release clause? 🔥🔥
This match would be 3 - 1 if the referee had gived that 2 penalites

These commentators are so shit.
Great game from both teams
msi king of the king
The stadium is beautiful.
Atletico Madrid's new stadium is almost look alike Wembley Stadium lol
Didn't know Messi was such a little bitch... crying over every damn touch
Barcelona is the best ever!
Griezman e uma putinha loira no meio dos jogadores,td mundo quer comer ele kkk\nso faltou um vestidinho vermelho pra combinar \nainda usa tiara huuum boiola kkkkkk
Wow this is almost as great as pubgswag.com
Wonderful class of football all round
barca had 2 great opportunities to win the match. saurez tap in and his shot that he could have passed to messi in front of him
Suarez great player but what a cunt
Atletico Madrid vs Barcelona 1-1 - All Goals & Extended Highlights - La Liga
12:55 Really?  like come on!
Barca coach is a fuck.. He like bring in paulhoo very late in games .. It just  making Great messi effort use less.. He needs to get his ass right moving forward.. Well done World Best  Messi
1 point a piece... Good
Barca Should have won that but Oblak has to be there all the time. Why is he so good
/watch?v=yjgL5hVzq-o Goals \nvery nice video (Y)
It was an excellent job, congratulations team
this draw match feel angry to me viva Barca go forward
Pls coach Gomez's is 3rd player for our team Congrats to Suarez
The was he says Griezmann is annoying
I don't know what's wrong with our couch he has given 90 mins match play for Gomez and left on the bench the likes of Paulinho, roberto and gerard delafou
Barca should have won 4-2 because griezmen goal that he begged pique was suppose to be in 2-1 Messi freekick 2-2 Messi has a chance on the edge of the 3-2 and it went couple inches wide from the post and that was a easy chance Suarez had 2 chances I will only count the one that he tapped it but oblack dived to the left and saved the one on one and the other one he slide tackled it but he arrived to late one of those so 4-2 and then the two penaltys 6-2 and Messi first chance in the first min he almost scored but went hit the side netting and there were a shirt on of players surrounding him 7-2 but that was a hard chance and we don't know what will happen after those penaltys probably a goal but lets say 4-2 u can't disagree and don't say what about griezmens shot that he shot to the right and ter Stegen saved it and hit it out for a corner that's shot wasn't going in it's really rare seeing those goals so overall game should have ended 4-2 but if I count the other ones I said 7-2
This is why i hate la liga
today has taken your life. thank you for your sacrifice\nrest in peace....

Hope Griezmann stays at Atletico he's gone shit now
Thx barcelona real madrid is on 2nd
there are more barca fans in the comment section of real madrid vs Getafe than in this video. why???
9.19 holyshitt man  what are they doing??
8 times has Messi hited the post this season...
no one say: ''im fan ~~~ great play  for barca or atletico'' ??
Que zaga lixo do Barcelona.
Jesus this commentator really cannot say some of these names it's so cringey
we played against atletcio de madrid, one of the greatest clubs in the world, and tied to them in their new stadium. Real madrid played getafe, a small team that is barely coming back to la liga, and barely won 2-1. Real madrid fans sure are nervous when they see barca still isnt in second place lol.
No like Messi in this world
The guys commentating is annoying
6:32 how did Messi get between those guys
Oblak is a beast

Why always no moving Umtiti there?
Suarith and Greeyezman played pretty well.
en español
These commentators pissed me off, it’s like they tried TOO hard to pronounce the players names and it just sounded over the top. Would rather no pronunciation, just say Suarez instead of suaref
Andre gomes es un tronco
Fuera de esta pagina ingleses mercenarios y piratas
Por que tantos comentarios en ingles si son de estados unidos su liga no es tan buena pero la liga de inglaterra es la mejor del mundo por que ven esto?

Christmas and the Winter solstice; \nThe winter solstice is not about the rebirth of a god. Although the sun has been worshiped as God and many of these beliefs and traditions have been passed along to Christianity. The winter solstice is about our human history thousands of years before Jesus.\nOur ancestors built solar temples and observatories all over the world to measure this day. These observatories were built of rock and stone and while they are accurate they are affected by the effects of precession. In many cases if not most, the Sun strikes the mark on three days. The Sun-worshipers called it three days of death because the sun stops moving along the horizon to the south. The rebirth is when the sun begins to move back to the north.\n\n One of the older known solar observatory is found in Africa and has been dated to around 8500 BCE. Stonehenge is another example which has been studied extensively. While we don’t know what these ancient people believed, we know they were observing and celebrating the winter solstice. The discovery of the winter solstice is how man learned to measure a solar year and the observation of this day is beneficial in determining the proper time of year to plant crops among other things.\nThis discovery is in a sense the discovery of time. [The Dawn of Time.]\nOur modern world revolves around this discovery.\n\nFrom that first year forward, the winter solstice has been a day of celebration which marks a solar year.\n\nWe celebrate The Dawn of Time”.\n\nHave a very happy Winter Solstice.\nAnd may good fortune and happiness be yours.\n\n************************************************************************************************************************
it's about fucking time
Somewhere, Philip Glass is looking out of his window with a smug smile.
I DONT EVEN WATCH THIS SHOW AND IM HYPED OMW TO WATCH IT NOW
I don't understand why people like this..
The new monster is a Kyuubi.

It's 2:06am and I'm trying so hard not to scream but I'm balling tears of fucking joy!!
I'm going to binge watch the shit out of this!
Teacher: Why weren’t you at school yesterday.\nMe: Stranger Things season 2 just came out.\n\nThe next day\nMe: Where’s Mrs Sheehan.
ITS LESS THAN TWO WEEKS LIKE OMG
1:29 is that the thessalhydra😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Better not have to wait for ages for eleven
Winona Ryder, what a great piece of acting, she makes the show, and it’s full of irony, in the fact she was a child star.  Here we have Millie Bobbie who will undoubtably become a huge star, and Ryder to somewhat mentor her.  It’s great and it’s exactly why the show works.  We have nostalgia, and we have great young actors supporting Ryder.  It’s everything you could ask for in a TV show.  It’s what gives this show it’s cult vibe.  No one else on this planet was better suited for this role than Ryder.  Fantastic casting.
BRUH IM HYPED AF IM BEEN WAITING 4 MONTHS FOR THIS TRAILER. IM SKIPPING SCHOOL FOR THIS
Mike is in pain but will is in more pain
Anyone know where I can find the song? The soundtrack on this show is amazing

Can’t wait for this season. It’s gonna be epic! If you like the music, check out my guitar cover of the trailer’s music! I don’t mean to spam, just really looking forward to this one! Definitely one of my favourite netflix original’s.

This guy should be on Arsenal Fan TV, he'd fit right in 😂😂😂

Jonathan pie manages to vent everyone's thoughts and be fair. 😂
The Gordon Ramsay of politics.
I must order pallets! The power of advertising
Look into flat earth rail tracks never account curvature neither do planes or rivers sonars don’t or canals earths no sphere ships have navigated the Antarctic circle this guys faking
Interviewers should say to them answer yes or no or I'm terminating this interview. If politicians even say any other word that does not involve a yes or no full stop then interrupt them until they say that one word or terminate the interview. \nToo many interviewers just let politicans get away with not answering the question.
Teresa May will never win a UK election again. She's finished, she's completely lost public support. Fuck off Teresa!
She works for Goldman Sachs not us! Get with the program people.
I found myself referring to someone as a 'dithering moose' today.  Keep up the good work Jonathan Pie!
Isn’t this the “THAT’S THE FUCKING NEWS!” guy?
To be fair. Nobody has brexited before - so she has to make it up..
She should go but nothing would change if she was ousted out, we need to start kicking Islamic extremist and immigrants out of our country and that includes the London mayor lick arse Khan and all the scumbags who support these lowlife traitors to our British way of life.
Hey, isn’t this the guy that “told the real news”
hahahaha fucking beauty this, possibly my new favourite person
Can this dude put across an argument without shouting.
She has more responsibility now than you could possibly imagine, you twat.
...and now she wants us to all work together to make Brexit a success.  Sorry, but when you ask someone to help dig their own grave, it's traditional to have a gun pointing at their head, and she doesn't even have that.\n\nShe's useless.  She has shown massively poor judgement, both as Home Secretary (remember those vans?) and now as PM.  Brexit was always a poisoned chalice, an unwinnable game, a self-contradictory brief, but she took it on anyway, because ever since she was little girl she had always dreamed of being Prime Minister, and this was her chance.  She was always useless, and now, since her hubristic, misguidedly opportunistic and disastrous General Election fiasco, she has gambled away the little bit of authority she might have inherited.\n\nThe real tragedy is that the barrel has already been scraped and there's literally no one better in the Tory Party willing to take her place.
may is a quisling..\nwhy doesnt she and hammond f off and join the labour party..\nget leaders who like the british people,like davis or mogg
England had a history of doing immoral things to get what they want. Maybe it is time to get into the spirit of being an immoral British empire imperialist again.\n\nOf course UKIP didn't mention anything about EU citizens who are currently in the UK. That would imply they are competent enough to plan ahead.
Absolutely spot on what a brilliant guy. \nShe should fuck off, she can't even talk without making that fuckin stupid look on her face like someone has shoved something up her arse.
This video was brought to you by Palletways. Palletways. We Deliver.
We should all just become communists. Simple.
still better than labour. I'll have that on my tombstone
This guy should get promoted he tells the truth when all the other fucks lie to us to make them look good
the eu ref thay says close if you take out gibraltar who in my opinion should not have voted the vote was neerly 56% out, only the remainers say we did not vote for this moeners we as a democeracy voted out out out get over it  or move to france and join the eu
I know it was hyperbole, but don't even joke about letting Boris have a go. He'll get ideas and start doing the rounds for support. Hell, I'm not even British and that thought scares me.
Once upon you were funny....now just sad
Johnathan, stop sitting on the fence and say what you really think.
It's time for the whole Left-Right paradigm to fuck off!
Fucking brilliant I love it
Possibly the best one yet Jonathon.CHEERS !!
Jonathan is back baby
This bloke is great!
The palletways truck should read:\nIf we stay in the EU, they will give us £350 million to sack Boris and May!
This man is gonna assassinate Theresa 😂😂😂😂
Lol all the people in Europe looking to the English as a britcom. Lol
govement is an acourrupt    she dont care about the idots .   no one in britian answers basic qestion . also they cant lie
BBC BT what ya gonna do with the dumb and exploited ? ...Trigger them with your media give them some excitment
Is it better to get angry and shout and revel in your humiliating powerless like an incontinent dog with tourettes with an anti-bark shock collar around it's neck, or, smile and make conciliatory noises while you shake hands and break every bone in your iron clasp which refuses to open even after you have been shot and your hand cut off - to the extent it requires surgical removal of your flesh from theirs as your hand is still kept alive with your pure rage?... LOL like Trump, it'll make you turn orange rather than red.
I am I.T. I will expose Jonathan Pie for who he really is
I'm a Scottish busker who hates the sound of solo bagpipes.....and I can hear them playing very faintly all the way through this. The best way to listen to bagpipes is through binoculars.....and a gentleman is someone who can play the bagpipes....but doesn't.
Theresa May not be incredible but tbh the UK aren't exactly spoilt for choice ..Corbyns off with the Unicorns ...Lib Dems aren't anywhere near powerful enough to challenge  ..Labour are divided & trying to go against the will of the British public in terms of Brexit ..Theresa May might be the lesser of two twats
Is this the guy from the convention/summit video
Yes lets get rid on May !!   Then we can have Corbyn get into number 10 and make a bigger fuck up !  Makes perfect sense to do that.
Why do you want her to lie though?
you know it's a good rant when you actually have to catch your breath afterwards xD
I swear this guy just wants to get pissed off at everything
This guy should be prime minister
Back again to read the comments, very nice!
And I seriously agree.
Surprised you haven't been arrested for hate speech jonathan
Fair play at least you tell the fucking truth bro. There all lying cunts the lot of em. I would never vote for any of them. Cause all they do is chat shit tell the people what they want to here. It's all fucking bollocks. Guy fawlks was the fucking man he had the right fucking idea. Fuck these bastards I hate everything they stand for!!!
Time to Fuck off Jonathan Pie! Getting sick of armchair have-a-go politicians. How about you take the wheel of brexit if you know so much?
Theresa May is so embarrassing and uncomfortable but I feel bad for her tbh.
you need a woman in your life mate
I know this is acting but this looks so genuine.
She really does need to fuck off
No deal has always been the plan. How else will the WTO be the only reckoning force for the whole world to obey as if the WHO hasn't already been enough, under which enough deceptive policies have been created for Health, social care, welfare reform, aero space agriculture, climate change. So let the fing muppets who ever the f--k wants to be a liar and keep the truth hidden from us, hand our freedom and rights over on a plate.
This guy is great! She is a shit priminister
Palletways saves 20% on marketing costs this year
To be honest, fair enough Theresa didn't handle it well, but I'm surprised why people aren't more caught up in how irrelavent the question itself is. Whether she says yes, no, idk or idgaf- we're not having a second referendum. And for the people that say ooo but her hearts not in it, this is a representative democracy, it doesn't matter if her hearts not in it, she has to do what the people vote for, stop crying and move on.
this stopped being funny about 5 months ago. you're not edgy, you're just an idiot
Geezer looks like he needs a good wash
You’re not you when you’re hungry. Eat a snickers.
Who are you man, I'll vote for you 😅

She should've accepted that P45...
At the end of the day, May, Corbyn, that Lib Dem bloke whose name I can't remember are all in politics for themselves and not the people. As my late Grandad used to say, Same sh!t, different ar#ehole.
Politicians DON'T CARE about the country AT ALL the only thing that they give a FUCK about is their £ check
Sounds like an arsenal fan wanting Wenger Out
Virtue signalling but no solutions.
Don't want no Brexit

Please find Robbie Savage a new job.
Do football pundits don't think that other people can read the game better than them. Worse when it's a few minutes of highlights then pundit billowing crap talk for ten minutes afterwards.\nRobbie Savage was like Vinnie Jones a mouthy gobby hacker. \nHe`s a embarrassment for humanity with his face splattered over bookie windows to encourage people to gamble into the dark lower pits of life.
Arsenal is a failed state. They need aid and water and urgent  restructuring. But they are held captive by an evil dictator.  There's only one man who can save them.  Trump.
Big up to troy. Only if more footballers were like This!
Deeney just saying everything arsenal fans have known know for a while now
Can't even get mad it's true
Deeney a Watford player is finally the first player to say what all fans think about a modern day but mostly shitty arsenal back four
90% of the likes on this video i guarantee are from Gunners
I mean yeah they won but cmon acting like Watford beat arsenal all the time...1 win yet come end of season arsenal will be around the top Watford will be nowhere near it
I want a mouthful of egg fart
Since when do current players come on the show? This is great. Cojones
loool man scores a goal afta 14 matches and thinks his the best in da leahue fukin watford bencher
I swear Robbie Savage has been on the drink.
It’s true the players of that club care more about their hairstyles
This is humiliation for Arse'nal Training Centre. Nobody players are telling them how they bullied them during the game and how they will bully them in future games. The best run club in the world?
Arsenals problem isn't lacking physicality Barcelona dont have physicality arsenals problem is mental all of their players r mentally weak u look at barca similar types of players but mentally strong all r winners they even get dirty busquets for eg everyone talks about his passing understanding of the game nobody talks about his defensive skills or that hes got a nasty side as well he lets opposition players know whats what everytime u play him messi iniesta mindset of winners thats y they r so successful over such a long period
He is ranting coz he does not have the skills to play for big clubs,
Love the honesty of this session.
Still a better team than Watford though
Thick as two short planks is Troy Deeney glorified pub standard player he is stealing a living
Not sure why this on my recommendations, but this dude talks way to much. Not a good look.
1 lucky win and he gets so cockey
as an Arsenal fan i cant really disagree with what he said!
he backs his shit up in teh field and is hard working and honest fellow..I wish we had more players with mentality like that in Arsenal..The last goal just shows how pathetic our players are in terms of as a unit...fcukin disgrace
Deeney thinks he's it but he's right about the arse.
this swollen drake needs to pipe down
deeney will make a great manager ...or pundit
Deeney obviously loves his son more than anything, and I get the feeling that because his son loves Arsenal so much and is so sad when they lose, that he actually gets pissed off himself at the way Arsenal are, and the way they let the fans, including his son, down.
fantastic getting him into the studio. very insightful, really enjoyed it. from an arsenal fan :)
well played watford they out played in 2nd half we were absolute shocking
What a prick never won fuk all never will apart from that header against mertersacker lol 😂
I wonder what he thinks of the England squad haha
It was a dive and he should be banned end of argument
i'd like to see him fight kolasinac
So refreshing to hear an honest assessment from a footballer.
I'm an Arsenal fan but sign up deeney now
Yes all hail this monstrosity hard man Troy Deeney who gives it at em and loves a good scrap. Fine lot of good that's done the England team the last 60 years right? No worries carry on with your delusion.
He's just mad we didn't sign him a few years ago lol this phat sausage
Arsenal are fairies not fighters, that's the difference.
There's no line between nice and toughness when the Arsenal team are off the pitch and on it
I respect Deeney for this but he's acting like he's Lionel messi
Arsenal fans are happy. Troy doing us a favour. We been saying this for years.
The match is finished, yet Troy Deeney is still scoring against Arsenal!!
Sorry, but just watched the Wenger press conference & he did not blame the penalty for the loss. He did say he thought it wasn't a penalty, but they lost due to their drop in their level & lack of killer instinct infront of goal. Which is sadly the truth. Well done to Watford tho.
Go an buy Deeney wenger  to liven your girls up
no, they don't. he f@cking ate them all by the look of him!
Fuck shade, this nigga threw the whole tree!!!!
Deeney's actually coaching Arsenal better than Wenger right now
Arsenal need to step their game up! I'm a huge arsenal fan, arsenal wenger doesn't play out best striker in any games, it's disgraceful!
Someone had to say it.
Troy is running around trolling up the opposition but he's kind of right that Arsenal need to be a more ruthless team on the park. It will be a fight to make top 4 again for Arsenal I think
You know your bad when deeney scores against you 😂😂
Come on... Roast Arsenal, so they f***ing start playing to the best
Fuck off deeney you can't chat shit just cause you have won one game which is the first win in 3, years at your home ground Hahaha, 30 years at home embarrassing Watford football club
I'm an arsenal fan and I wholeheartedly concur with Troy's sentiments. yesterday's performance and result was dreadful. This current team are so mentally weak and have no sense of leadership.
This man speaks the truth 👏
I feel like Troy is low key an Arsenal fan inside kkkkkkk, u should have him on Arsenal fan Tv
Robbie savage talks utter crap I can't watch any match he's commentating  on his voice grates on my ears.
I'm fuckin luvit this you bunch of plastic cunts , the TRUE North London supporters support the true North London team , say what you like you bunch of plastic cunts !!ava look 😂
Why is this arsenal bullshit always on trending. It's always the same thing. We get it Arsenal isn't as good as it use to be. Tell me when something interesting comes up.
Well said Troy and I'm a Luton fan, born and bred
Makes me laugh how people are surprised how real and savage deeney Is... not many know or rememebr this but this guy went to prison for kicking someone in the head Lol he's a nutter
Straight talking Troy, Nice to see someone not being scared to say what he sees.
Fuck off Deeney ,what the fuck have you won,The penality was a dive, and the winning goal was was luck..
a new low being mugged off by troy Deeney. in fairness to ozil henry missed the most important one-on-one in arsenal's history vs barca
When has anybody seen a premiership referee every changed his decision, so what is the real point of getting booked arguing with the referee.
- Respect to deeney, we where pathetic yesterday and deserved the loss
Says it how it is. 🔥
As an arsenal fan I couldn't agree more. We are fucking garbage.
The only reason we lost is because Watford got the unfair penalty
I am an Arsenal fan thank you Troy Deeney that the truth and everybody sees through Wenger now
Brilliant interview, analysis. I'm a Deeney fan now.
As an arsenal fan this is so good to hear. Great insight. I hope the players watch this!
When an average player says Arsenal are shite, then you know Arsenal are average.
As a gooner myself I must admit that he is spot on, my club are mentally weak and for me that trickles down from Arsene Wenger.
Deeney talking big after a gifted penalty. If anything relying on the softest touch to gain a penalty is not having nuts!
WENGER.... GAZIDIS..... KRONKE.... ARE U LISTENING TO THIS?? of course your not. U fucking mugs absolutely ruined this club, the quality of football is shite the worst I have seen in 15 years. Get the fuck out of our club.
I think he is a Arsenal fan and doesn't like the down fall.
Although Watford are chavs, he does have a point.

SPONSORED BY Snickers

Troy Deeney very eloquent
Deeney dissing Arsenal FC hahaha \n\nYo DT Troopz back your team!
Troy Deeney Hey nigga come to emirates bitch...We will show whose have nuts\nWinning against Arsenal B team and acting like won the epl
The entire arsenal team has achieved more in one pre season than deeney has in his entire career. Let that sink in.
Congrats from a Benfica fun you are going up \o/
Diogo jota is incredible
You're team is far too good for the championship, definitely going up
I hope we can keep Jota...
As a portuguese is nice to see portuguese youngsters shinning on Wolves especially Jota..Wolves are going up for sure!
What a game, what a performance what a result! The wolves are going up! \n\n#COYW
Wolves aye we 🔶◾️🔶◾️
WOLVES AY WE🔶⚫️🐺
DIRTY SCUMBAG HUTTON KICKED CAVILEIRO ALL OVER THE PARK AND WE ALSO HAD A STONEWALL PENO SHOUT. WE GOIN UP ANYHOW, C'MON ME BABIES ;-)
It was a scintillating performance with technical ability that tore villa apart... a long way to go but that has to be a bench mark performance which if way sustain will see us promoted  !! WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS FOOTBALL CLUB  - pride of the black country  😚😚😚
Clicked like before the video began. Well done Wolves! Put these wannabees in their place.
Absolutely battered them! Could have been 4 or 5 ! COYW
Signing Jota on a permanent is the most important part of the January tranny window !

We will give City a run for their money
Calm down wolves you only beat aston villa, fans going on like you're gonna win the champions league
im a aston villa fan, well done wolves good game.
Good game, awful commentator, he barely even mentions any of the players names
For the first time in ages, I watched a Wolves game and couldn't help but smile. It was like watching Brazil at times.
champions league football... here we come...
The highest Molineux attendance since 1981...I was at that Middlesbrough Cup replay, but would give anything to have been there yesterday.
I knew it was 2-0 begore video probably because i went and watched it at the stadium #WolvesForever

As a Birmingham fan...thank you wolves KRO we will smash them at the end of the month

Just the best football I've seen in a long long time and that includes Premier league and Champions league. Diogo Jota and Ruben Neves are world class players and the whole team is superb. Fantastic football and a wonderful time for Wolverhampton Wanderers FC and I love it
Everyone has demons.
There are no Turtles folks…
No need for this movie
I was excited because I thought it was an X men film kmt 🙄
This is superheroes movie or horror movie?
DC ITS YOUR TIME TO SHINE
Gonna watch this only cuz Arya is in it
That's the guy from the Stranger Things
I can imagine the post credit scene where Wade is reading The New Mutants story while sitting next to Dopinder
Does not seem to be a good idea.
a marvel horror movie? interesting looks good
Games of thrones and stranger things 💛💛
I watched this trailer thinking it was some kind of extension of the X men series. And I was waiting for some one to unleash their powers.
Marvel trailer without a cringe cliche joke at the end?
First Sansa, now Arya. Boy those Stark girls love getting roles as x-men
It's weird seeing marvel with a horror movie...
Hope this is better than Inhumans, as that is lame!
From no one to new mutant
Deadpool and Logan would love this place they will kill it lol
I'll wait until after theaters
Is this the X-Men spin off
This trailer is awful. No originality
The thing coming through the wall automatically made me think of Stranger Things. Anyone else!?
I cringe everytime a movie trailer tries to do jump scares..
I thought this was XMen 😂 😂 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
JAMES WAN PRODUCED THIS MOVIE
Worst use of pink Floyds song EVER
Yea, spooky x men tv show, just in time for... Easter?
What the hell is this??
Also one last thing\nHow come these teens and kids are here.\nAlso the Graves of the kids/ numbers.
I thought we were going to catch up with the group from Logan, that escaped to Canada.
A girl has no name
YES YES YES BE SOMETHING MORE THAN A HEROES DEFEAT THAT VILLIAN MOVIE BE SOMETHING MORE
Not really liking the horror film vibe, but it's something new. I hope it's good.
My thoughts are x-men.. you know after that Logan movie and the fact that it's marvel.. but not typical marvel ?..
I have one of the first cable comics
So a X-Men horror movie. As Calvin Candy said in Django Unchained You had my curiosity. But now you have my attention.
after seeing Maisie, I can think of Game of Mutants coming to mind.
When I saw the title, I first thought of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
I don't like horror genre movie ( I'm a scaredy cat T^T) but for you X-men I'll embrace my fear
All I see here is pinkfloyd
Honestly, I did not expect this to be a horror film as well.
Gonna be a lotta people spanked on this one! LOL
People are starting to realize that “Superhero” doesn’t have to be its own genre, can’t wait to see more kinds of superhero films!
Sooo is this or is this not related to X-men?
all I can think is that Negasonic Teenage Warhead's yellow and black outfit established there already were New Mutants in the Deadpool universe.
that lady doctor reminds me of nurse ratched
Sandra is a funny kid
So is this....xmen? Or... nah??
How much you wanna bet Hugh Jackman will have a cameo in this  movie too.😂
Do a good deed today and click the link to my video to help me reach 10,000 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO8EnOeMrRI
My girl Arya and the guy from Stranger Things are here! I’m in!
the use of this iconic song in this trailer is amazing. i'm sold just bc of pink floyd.
Can we get Marvel zombies someday? As s show? The comic book was soooooo dope!!
They should make a batman Arkham Asylum horror movie
What part about this, besides the words new mutants, has anything to do with the actual new mutants? This is going to be so bad.
If this movie doesn't end with Colossus breaking stuff to save his sister, I will be disappointed.

The Pink Floyd song is so out of place in this video.
So is this a horror version of the X-Men..? Because they said they're done with the X-Men franchise after Logan was made... So are they rebooting it....
This seems more like a low budget teen horror movie then a sequel to logan or anything remotely to do with X-men...
Oh I thought it was the new Ninja Turtles
I thought this was gonna be an x-men thing....
Pink Floyd is always a win
The misuse of the pink Floyd song made me cringe
this looks like the kind of movie that would come out around the same time as The fury or Firestarter. I've been craving this kind of movie in modern day.
i know im getting ahead of my self but how is this going to work if they use the bear and then the kill the bear how will they do a sequal it wont be a horror movie anymore
Perfectly honest, that looked like trash!
Fattu mutants
American Horror Story: X-men
What? what?
Marvel makes scary movies?!
Where's X23???
Garbage! Wolfsbane? Cannonball? Sunspot? Mirage? Karma? Magma? Nope. Just a horror show.

Illyana Rasputant isn't creepy.. maybe.
nice. nice. 😄
Arya Stark, Jonathan Byers, Anna Montez... We might have something here...\n\nAlso Alice Braga, marry me please.
This is so stupid! I was really looking forward to this being and action packed X Men movie, and instead we get this spooky bullshit, I hope Marvel gets the rights back to the X Men soon cuz this is probably gonna get worse in the next year.
this better be pg-13
Now people can shut up about DC being darker than Marvel 😒
Ter stegen 👌👌
Damn both keepers did well
Una segunda parte muy buena del Barça lastima por los palos, pero este punto que se ha sacado es lo mejor de lo peor que se podia esperar.
Vaya miniatura elige La Liga para el vídeo. Un tío provocando a la grada. Y luego venimos con el fair play, el respeto y demás.
MATS is the best.\nMarc\nAndre\nTer\nStegen
Luis is back
Oblak, the greatest
Una vez másssssss  VAMOS BARÇA....LUCHO SUÁREZ VAMOSSS
Griezman deserved to score
Barçaaaaa
El Barça mereció ganar la verdad. El Atlético se salvó por una jugada individual de Saúl (otra vez).
LIKE SI MESSI ES EL MEJOR DEL MUNDO
Le grand barça
Partidazo
Velverde really trying to fuck up Gomes career placing him RM. C'mon man give him a first place as a CM. 2 shots.
Griezman was on a mission
The english comment u r looking for
Fuck yes Suarez... fuck yes
maldito caño le iso griezman ese si es un dios :X
Just an English comment passing through :P
Penaldo Tapinaldo Divenaldo is the worst player in the world
Барса без неймара даже лучше!
Good and fabulous match performances from every players of both the team.\nYet Stegen  - Awwwwww \nAf  a long time. Been an good match to watch.
Suarez mandando a callar al atletico k payaso
Yo sabia el barca no iba a dejar ganar . Toma cholo pensaste que ibas a ganar
Suarez is a hero
Gooool de Barcelona va mos 😘❤
https://youtu.be/_TP2XV6bioo
Pura mierda pique
Barca scum on the cover
Man city are buying Messi
Gabon
Abajo el barsa
Los dos equipos están masomenos al mismo nivel.. aunque al Barça le hacen más refuerzos..
Porque el Atlético no metio a alex hunter?
El gol del atlético es muy top👌
Buen video y buen partido 😊 sigue asi OMG me encanto like
Барса чёрты не смогли Атлетико ёбнуть
Resultado injusto, el Barca mereció ganar el partido :v
English?
Barca tooooop
bravo😱😱😱😱mm s
Visca Barsa ❤💙💪
atleti campeon
Intense game
messinin vuruşu direye deymeseydi 1-2 olucakdı
Grande Suarez, mandando a cayar al Wanda metropolitano entero
Espectacular
Este Barca tiene buena pinta eh...😏
Madridistas hijos de puta
Jogão
Terdggsgewrjd
A clear handball..😑
Ter khrigan hhhhhhh
Parece enfadado Bojack Horseman
amo el festejo de suarez jajaja NACIONAL TE ESPERA CRACK
Fue un buen partido y el resultado lo vi mas o menos justo por lo que se vió, en los últimos minutos si hubiéramos aprovechado varias ocasiones de gol probablemente hubiéramos ganado el encuentro.
Que pena el barca estuvo a nada d ganar
Yeaaaa
TODO EL MUNDO QUE ESTA VIENDO ESTE VIDEO SE TIENE QUE SUSCRIBIR AL CANAL, DAR A LA CAMPANITA I DAR LIKE / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrvuaofJ68Y
Solo ponen las ocasiones del Atleti o que? Y la primera de Messi en el minuto 1?...
Cuidado que pega como cotto\nNo sé cómo llegué aquí
Bien por Suarez callando a los españoles xd
https://youtu.be/_TP2XV6bioo

El Farza tan sortudo como siempre 😂😂😂
Vaya Criticas a la celebración\nA sido igual que Messi al bernabeu o Raúl al Camp nou\nCada uno celebra los goles como quiera
Miren a estos chavales jugar al fútbol https://youtu.be/nneL0I3l-dU
Cruz Azul y el barca están igual
Que grande Messi ♡
Vaya pallaso aprende de messi hijo puta bastardo
Que grande Suárez mandando callar para darse un poco más de importancia por que actualmente no está entre los 20 mejores delanteros
Bonito partido 👌\n\nMuy buena segunda mitad del Barsa :D
Suárez es dios
Aúpa atleti
Buen partido de Suarez, Andre Gomes y Sergi  al igual que Godin, Correa y Saul\nMessi estuve bien pero no tan acertado
Super griermann
Soy del Madrid y hubiera merecido que ganará  el barca  porque el Atleti es una mierda verlo jugar marca o algo y a la defensiva,eso no lo hace ni el Málaga xd
Puto vampiro de mierda que se vaya a comer pollas el jugador mas guarro de la historia de la liga y hasta que no acabe la mafia de la liga con sus presidentes corruptos siempre recibira ayudas este mierda club
VIVA ESPAÑA UNIDA!!! MUERTE A LOS SEPARATISTAS!!!\nY AUPA ATLETI!!!!!
*HALA*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MADRID*
Madridistas hijos de puta escoria perros si el Madrid ganó 1/2 hijo puta
Common play torres at the start not as a sub.. Torres is really ruining whatever career he has left by staying at athletico.\nThe playing style of athletico doesn't suit torres a bit and that is destroying torres
Hala Madrid!!
Messi el mago ,,desaparecida buahahaha 😝🖕🏽
Madre mía Griezmann...
Como siempre el atletico es griezman y el portero y 9 mas
Barsani hər halına sevirəm
AUPA ATLETI
*todas las madres cules LEs gusta chupar mi polla*
A quien ace callar el payaso ese de suares es un empate y lo ace ni que ubiesen ganado la liga le falta mucho para acer callar que payasos por favor esos cules que payasos an sido siempre y son por eso tienen 5 champions y nosotros 12
El hándicap es real
00:53 si eso entraba ... 😱
Hala Madrid cortando distancias 🖕🏽
Estos culerdos son un disco rallado,son tan aburridos que solo saben decir que Mezzi es el mejor de la historia,aunque empaten
Messi ya no juega como antes pero cuando esté en la selección argentina juega bien pero cuando está en la Barcelona no juega bien habrá que pasa a Messi con ganas Messi
Messi no sirve es mejor Cristiano Ronaldo que Messi 100 veces
Que bajuno es Suárez
Napoli and Lazio are the only teams i like in Italy. the rest are cunts

Forza Napoli!!!
Napoli Hamsik best!!!!
Vabbe il Napoli è illegale
Napoli!!!
grande Napoli
napoli champion
Forza Napule rint' o core
È troppo bravo insigne
Aspetto solo lo sfogo di Sick.
grande
Allegri top 11 ha ha funny guy.
La capolista se ne va
Cosa cazzo ha tolto Reina???
Godo
un tiro un gol, 10 infortunati, 2 pali
Partita meritata,complimenti al Napoli.
Di Francesco OUT!!!
LEGGETE IL MIO NOME E FATELO!!! CPSÍ VINCO 5 EURO
Wow
Grande Napoli💙
De Rossi che assist che ha fatto ad Insigne😍😂
Il Napoli sta dimostrando di essere la più forte. Attacca con 8 giocatori e si difende con 10. Squadra compatta e veloce, ermetica e pungente. Lo scudetto è in arrivo.
Hahahha ci sarà una bella partita col manchester!
Non condivido il risultato finale. Per un tempo ha giocato meglio il Napoli, per un tempo ha giocato meglio la Roma. Era da pareggio. Poi ovviamente c'è il fattore sfiga. Finchè saremo così sfigati non vinceremo mai niente. Senza dubbio la squadra più sfigata di sempre. Senza pali e altre puttanate varie avremmo vinto contro l' Inter e pareggiato contro il Napoli. Ma tanto è sempre la stessa storia. E Manolas salterà pure il Chelsea per infortunio
I pali e le traverse non mancano mai
Ma veramente avete detto che il napoli meritava ma dove?
Il napoli per me dovrebbe vincere lo scudetto
ROManisti Rom casamonica monnezzari, avete perso il secondo monnezza derby di fila? AHHAHA PERDERE DUE VOLTE DI FILA INCASA CON I NAPOLECANI COLEROSI, HHAHAHAHAH Il calcio minore mi appassiona sempre <3
per me il napoli quest'anno se lo cuce il tricolore.e se lo meriterebbe alla grande
Certo che sti romani o meglio rumeni so proprio merde soliti cori vergognosi.. ma pensate alla squadra scarsa che avete.. arriverete 5 dietro la lazio di ciruzzo.. forza napoli siamoo foortii
Si, si, pali, traverse, tutto giusto...Ma del chiarissimo rigore negato a Mertens nessuno dice nulla? E della più grande opportunità di segnare da parte di Mertens, in tutto il match, a tu per tu col portiere,  per il due a zero, di nuovo nessuna menzione? Queste occasioni mancate, più il goal segnato, nel computo della partita hanno molto più peso specifico dei palilli e paletti presi dalla Roma, la quale ha giocato bene si per soli venti minuti, ma a quell'ora doveva stare di già sotto di trè goals. Quindi smettetela di rosicare e siate più sportivi..in fin dei conti siete una grande squadra e sarete li fino alla fine, ma per i rosiconi, ammettete che almeno quest'anno il Napoli è superiore e che ha meritato di vincere. Punto.
De Rossi ieri sera pensava di giocare col Napoli, dai mi sembra evidente
Non mi sembra che stiamo facendo così schifo da farci insultare da tifosi di squadre sotto di noi (tifo Juve)
Se non lo vince Quest anno non lo vince più il Napoli...
Paratona di Reina! Spero che quest'anno lo vinca il Napoli lo scudetto...se lo merita!
Sono juventino e da sportivo e amante del bel gioco dico che il Napoli ora si merita tutti i punti che ha  posso solo dirvi bravi
Purgati da un Napoletano grazie all'errore di un romANO...che goduria..CIRO VIVE..INFAMI
Per chi parla di vittoria non meritata, il Napoli ha tirato più volte nello specchio (hamsik 9 volte su 10 la segna da quella posizione). Koulibaly ha stravinto a difesa, bene il centrocampo, forse un po meno efficace calleion. Tre punti strameritati..ah dimenticavo..mi dicono che c'era un rigore su mertens..va beh l'anno prossimo che mettono la VAR andrà meglio...
Lavali col fuoco dicevano\n\nGrazie per i tre punti e arrivederci \n\n\n\nP.s. avevo strakosha al fantacalcio e dybala contro
E fanno 6 legni colpiti dalla Roma finora
e evidente che questo è l anno del Napoli, senza nulla togliere ma quando si ci mette il destino per forza di cose deve andare cosi. Che la Juve perda 3 punti (potenzialmente 5 perche con la Lazio si poteva vincere tranquillamente) con 2 rigori al 93esimo e tutti, tutti e due sbagliati e il Napoli viceversa vince con la SPAL per il rotto della cuffia, con la Roma con l assist di De Rossi, e evidente come gli vada tutto a genio..cmq bene cosi.
i pali e le traverse?!... servono per delimitare lo spazio necessario per il gol.
sembriamo la roma di rudi garcia facciamo 8 su 8 e poi crolliamo con le squadrette speriamo che non vada cosi
Avanti ragazzi sempre con la forza  andiamo a vincere cazzo !!!
Il Napoli oggi e'piu squadra della Roma.L'errore di De Rossi a fatto la differenza.FORZA ROMA.
Roma e Juve: 4 pali presi, 2 tiri sbagliati davanti alla porta e un gol preso per assist di un tuo compagno (ho unito le sfighe di entrambe). Ora però parlo del Napoli: la fortuna c'è e passa da tutte le squadre, però il Napoli ovviamente sta meritando questo primo posto, da Juventino. Bellissimo campionato!
8 su 8\nContinuiamo così e vinceremo quello che ci aspetta da anni\nSempre e Comunque Forza Napoli  1926
Perché ovviamente insigne con la nazionale non poteva segnare,no troppo faticoso.
Ma che cazzo rosicate i pali fanno parte della porta...e i due rigori per il napoli? Andateli a vedere e poi parlate.8-2 i tiri nello specchio 56 a 44 il possesso palla .ma comm cazz e guardat sti partit.
Non gasatevi troppo idioti  che il Guardiola ve ne fa almeno 5 in coppa e poi state a piangere come è vostra abitudine
Ragazzi ora c'è la Champions League ci saranno infortuni ai giocatori e stanchezze varie ed il Napoli perde tutto il vantaggio . SCOMMESSE APERTE A TUTTI .DI SICURO finirà cosi😂👍profezia mia👍👍👍👍👍👍
Se il Napoli vince lo scudetto quest'anno, per i prossimi 20 anni il campionato può essere vinto dalle restanti squadre.
sul mio canale spiego come vedere il derbi di oggi milna inter venite
questa partita era da pareggio...è stato un episodio a farci vincere.A volte ci vuole fortuna nel calcio.stà volta ci è andata bene.
ALLORA, CHE IL NAPOLI L'ABBIA MERITATA O MENO 3 PUNTI HA PRESO,ORA NON CAMBIA SE VOI DITE <<NON L'HA MERITATA>> <<ABBIAMO PRESO SOLO PALI>> E CI TOLGONO I PUNTI.\nFORZA NAPOLI SEMPRE
Gran passaggio di de rossi complimentoni clap clap 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
il vesuvio ha gia in mano lo scudetto..lo ha predetto san gennaro
Grande Napoli! Ottima partita di Higuain.
allora, da tifoso napoletano, dico obbiettivamente che non è stato il solito calcio champagne del Napoli e se la Roma (pur non avendo fatto chissà cosa) avesse pareggiato, non avrebbe rubato nulla...ma non si puo' pretendere che il Napoli vada a giocare sul campo dei vicecampioni per asfaltarli, e che cazzo...ha avuto ragione Di Francesco, avrebbe vinto chi avesse fatto meno errori in difesa...er capitano ha fatto una cacata biblica ed ecco che han perso, semplice!!
Arriviamo a 100.000 iscritti prima dei 10 video
alisson ha fatto una cappellata sul gol,  è meglio che la roma a gennaio prende pinsoglio!
forza Napoli credici è l anno buono non spompatevi.
sono un'interista di napoli\nstasera l'inter vince e vincerà anche contro il napoli\nse non vince l'inter meglio la rube\nnon voglio sentire fuochi di capodanno a fine maggio
Quante schedine perse, solo 1 gol.. Io personalmente avrei messo over
AVANTI  LAZIO  .\nAs Roma  Merda !!
Ssi ggonfia la rete ,  Ssi ggonfia la rete\nCit. un pescatore anonimo
we ragazzi mica si può vincere tutte le partite  4-1 3-0 ecc  guardate la juve in 6 anni quante  partite vinte 1-0 immeritatamente FORZA NAPOLI o nonnnnnn  sta buon
Sempre e per sempre forza napoli!!!!
Poi fai anche bologna-spal eh
Quando perdi la schedina per colpa di Reina...
forza napoli tutta la vita
Ricordatevi sempre che pali e traverse sono tiri sbagliati,no sfortuna...
Napoli colera
Per chi dice che il pareggio era alla portata della roma,dico:per 70 minuti non avete toccato  palla...\nAndatevi a rivedere i tiri nello specchio...\nManca un rigore grande come una casa...\nÈ questa partita doveva finire in pareggio?\nFatevi una domanda,e se potete datevi una risposta😎
che culooo porco dio palo e traversa come contro l'Inter  sculati
quest'anno: Napoli (e sarebbe pure ora che la Juve si faccia da parte)
Grandeeeeeeeeeee forza Napoli siamo primiiiii, questo è ľanno buono, vinceremo lo scudettooooo
Forza napoli sempre Juve ha perso
Salutate la capolista

Don't the excuses come after the match? I must say Popeye is well prepared.
Adapt around your injury, wrap it up. Deal with it. Boxers throughout decades have carried on and trained for years with lengthy injuries. \n\nIt’s a shame you won’t get flagged up for steroids and cocain though.
Where do I get a rope?
I'm seeing both pink n white and green n grey. scared
You punch with with your hands, you signed up for it bro so for money 💰 sake get yourself fit wrap your knee up and get in there I'll deffo be going anyway
Used to like this guy, now.... Cancer.
I interviewed KSI and Joe Weller \nGo check it out!!!
Light blue and grey
That massive balled spot on his head  bro you probably fakeing that call lil bitch you stay using roofs like get a fucking life
guys were can I watch the fight live on TV?
You talk like the dumb kid that everyone laughs at
It’s 100% mint green and grey!!!
I see gray and blue with a patch of pink undertones on the toe.
Red and yellow wtf you guys talking about.
No Joe, you gonna get dropped like a bar of soap you scumbag...
Always thought Joe was a bit of a prat. Used to like KSI when he was actually funny and a dweeb. Now he thinks he's an alpha rapper, I don't know who i want to lose more. Ideally they both knock each other out at exactly the same time.
IF U DONT LIKE KSI then what about his brother deji (comedyshortsgamer)
The shoes are originally pink and white people say different because of the flash on the camera apparently
Green and grey like wtf it's bullshit
I see green / mint and grey 😬
what was the song at the end?
They are clearly pink and white
The trainers are green and grey
everything is fake now on YouTube, even these set up fake fights. It's all bout money, It's all scripted, trust me, worse then wrestling. ppl all bout C.R.E.A.M.
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaakkk and shut your big mouth you sucker
10,000 KSI fans are salty because Weller is gonna destroy him
To all the kids saying this will be his excuse if he loses, have you seen KSI box? Weller's not gonna lose.
In some pictures pink and white but in that one green and grey anyone else?
When he explained his knee injury, it reminded me of Mike Tyson explaining breaking his back 😂
His Mum thinks that he is the stronger component.  Surely she means opponent.
as long as you don't use it as a bullshit exuce when you get dropped
Hang yourself cunt

I FN love Pink. What an incredible voice.. You can just tell she sings from the heart. Truly amazing.
Thank you again, Pink for speaking out for us women. Your music has always been a great reflection of our lives. This is what makes your music, with your amazing voice, what really matters in this life. You are the whole package, Lady.  Love you, always.
Her voice. I'm in awe. Has it always been that strong? Good song. Better than the other one she did.
Literal goosebumps, she is beautiful and a beautiful voice
She just makes me want to be a better human being! What a powerhouse of talent! Concert tickets in my area got sold out in less than 10min and site crashed. Nope, couldn't get any!! Next time perhaps! 😀🙏
Now THAT'S how you sing a song live!!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Outstanding performance.
I love how people forget how spellbindingly deep, inspiring, emotional, and talented Pink is.. I hope she forgets that they forget that and keeps on doing the damn thing. When you watch her videos they're just a peek into this seriously underrated vocalist.\n\n\n\n\nBazinga!
One of the best live performances. Very powerful. As a black girl who grew up in South Africa, I've always had a soft spot for Pink. I always loved her and her music. She is a real artist.
What about us? What about everything we've been through?\n\nWhat about trust?! You know I never wanted to hurt you!
SHE FUCKING KILLED IT
Vocals 🙌🙌🙌🙌🎤🎤🎤
Absolute greatness
Perfection.
Amazing!
That was great!
She's awesome!!!!!
Such an amazing voice!
p!nk you're awesome.
I love that she has had the same band for years.
Please don't leave me, P!nk.
My god I love her. She has a powerhouse vocalistm she is a wonderful human being. She I'd bad ass. I am seeing her live in May and I fucking cant wait
She's always been great!
Her hair is effortlessly amazing all the time.
I like Pink because she can sing WITHOUT auto tune, meaning she has actual talent. As far as what ANY singer or actor has to say politically, economically, or socially, don't care and don't want to hear it in any manner shape or form, any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
*_PINK IS THE BOMB!_*
My dream is to sing on that stage one day....
didnt know she was a Somalian pirate.
I know this is random but her guitarist back there looks just like Kristen Wiig! Lol and of course Pink is amazing as usual. 💓
Love her so much❤
Do a good deed today and click the link to my video to help me reach 10,000 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO8EnOeMrRI
I will never thumbs down anything pink does she's so fucking dope and underrated support beautiful trauma 😊
god damn this song is annoying, they play it on the radio constantly
Can't believe this shit is popular, music and politics should stay separated
She kills it every time. She can't do any wrong in my book. She is amazing
Legit thought snl was about to make fun of pink and I was like how tf are u gon make fun of a great song
UMMMM... 😮 amazing performance...! I can't help but feel like there is a deeper meaning to her lyrics and she's talking about how we as global brothers and sisters have been lied to and deceived by the few elite who are actually in power... F U, ROTHSCHILD, ROCKEFELLER ZIONISTS BANKERS ETC!!
And I want that outfit!!!!
Pink is amazing all her songs are amazing LEGEND 💜💜💜
I don't like it when stars plagiarize the King MJ
I'm just back from holidays in Spain where I heard this for the first time and I'm obsessed with it by far my favorite pink song.
WHERE IS THE JAY-Z SNL PERFORMANCE? UPLOAD IT.
that was a fucking awesome visual switch at 3:45 where you see the drummer slam both sticks down on his cymbals right after a short cool solo by Pink
She is so cool.
She is AMAZING! Always have been
The pipes this woman has...
What an amazing talent. Like every song\nWas written in my world. Love you PINK. See you in March.
Damn, I been sleeping on Pink. She still dope!
she is such a talented singer. she is so bad ass and bold i love herrrr🖤
She is just so talented. Really love her.
It's a shame that people find P!nk boring.
❤
fukin love this so hard
Pink for president!
GETTT ITTT!!! Yasssss!!!!!
Looking for subscribers!
She sounded flawless
Ugh! Yes, Alecia!
Pink is SUPER butch
🌎 earth vs trump !
Great voice
Pure Love! pink!
I had no idea she was that good. Wow. Great band. Really great backup singers.
Love this amazing, freakishly talented lady. Saw her on tour in 2013 and hoping to see her again! I love the fact she sings LIVE, no auto tune BS!!!
P!nk is such a M!LF  #SNL43
You should sing opera, Pink.  Great band.
gawd almighty-- what a set of pipes.....does play an instrument?
A great singer and songwriter. Love her
Damn...I'm 33 and P!nk has been badass since I was in high school.
Is that her real voice ... Because wow.
Can't wait to see her in Abu Dhabi 2017 F1. X.
Beautiful song from a  beautiful lady,
Thats how you own the SNL stage. amazing
The way she interacted with her backing singers nearly brought a tear to my eye. What an authentic beautiful inspiring woman.
P!NK is the new black)))...breathtaking, amazing, real, timeless...just superb!!!
Incredible voice.
Speechless.
Real non fake pop star.
Where is her political song 'dear precident'
I love pink but I just can’t get into this song 😢
I LOVE YOU P!NK!
What are you wearing hon? 🤦‍♂️
Does anyone know what she's wearing? That coat she has looks amazing.
that's what i call music
Brittany Mariah and all the other fake ass singers this is how you sing live and not lip sync
A huge nod to our troops.
my idol 😭
Kristen Wiig rocking the bass
Why is Kristen Wiig playing bass? ;)
high school musical 2 ?
2:38 WOW.... just awesome combo ✌👏
👏👏👏👏
And I love that all but two members of her band are\n female.  Empowerment!  Women can rock!
Poor Floptina.
Jeseeezuz...it's the same progression as My Hands by Jewel which was great a week after 9/11 but what???!
Not a lyrically diverse song, especially when the title of song makes up 48% of the lyrics.
Bone Thugs already released What About Us a long time ago.
I thought Pink was gonna do Michael Jackson's earth song. Bummer.
#atheism
Whoa - Pink got beefy.

This is the first set of pundits I've seen make sense in a long time👍👍. Great analysis. Cheers
Let see what Pep does when he comes to Anfield im 99% sure his team wont be playing like that.  Imo United had enough quality to go to Anfield and get a win against a liverpool defence thats not great
Martial and young played like LB and RB and these pundits don't know shit about the game bias mfs
Al scared of Jose and not being on Christmas card list
please upload full show
Mourinho has now managed a Utd team twice at Anfield in 180mins of football they've had 2 shots on target tell me that's not parking the bus maybe you can't see it for your double chin
Name of the journo wearing a blazer?
Martin samuel looks like a fat george best
Custis sucking Jose dick as usual. How he can call himself a journalist is beyond me, absolutely clueless about the game and just parroting stats. United parked the bus just accept it and move on you clown
Please post the full episode
What a load of rubbish, morinhou parks the bus. Curtis stop talking bull, KLOP can’t get past a team that does not attack not many can
Who ate all the pies
This fake journalist with a tie is talking complete nonsense. We know he hates Guardiola and man city and never says anything good about man city.
No one cares about oliver holt anyway
They definitely paid for this to be on the trending tab
How is this trending 🤦🏾‍♂️. YouTube I.S deffo rigged
Why is this cancer shit Trending.
Stan conker
This fat cunt said “klop didn’t take the risk by taking one of the midfield players n playing one attacking”. Did Mourinho do ? Are you sucking Mourinhos dick you fat cunt? Young against smaller teams plays as left back. Where did he play yesterday? How this pundits are given the jobs they know nothing about football can’t even analyse simple facts
#Kronkeout
If we are really on the right frame of mind, we would agree that this guy is talking sense. What the heck Man Utd not do this and that? As a home team, Liverpool should be on the critism side, This Is Anfield, no 3 points, not even in the top 3 of the league table. Man Utd still not far off City. How many games alone Man Utd win with 4 goals, a lot this. The season is still long but the table read, Man Utd 8 games 6-2-0, GD 19, 20 pts, 2 pts off City, 2nd on the table. Liverpool 8 games 3-4-1, GD 1???? 13 pts???? 9 pts off Cify???  8th on the table???? ... Mourinho won't mind whatever the football experts wanted to say or think.
Neil is spot on....and I don't usually agree with him
finally someone who understands football, thank you.
what a great analysis after a long long time. its good to see there are still some journalist left who sees jurgen klopp beyond his passion and all those bullshits....
What is this fat cunt talking about lol,off course mourinho is killing football he’s done it everywhere he goes Man Utd vs Liverpool always biggest game in England he killed last few games,fair play he wins trophys at the end day that’s what it’s about but doesn’t mean anyone likes he boring style,specially when spends 200 m every year at every club with it,klopp didn’t take that massive risk that fat prick going on about because Liverpool couldn’t afford to lose pressure there under,
Finally I have found Pundits that know football 👏🏽 Those so call manager that play beautiful football, what have they even won last season= Fuck alll so to even have the gut to speak is Shameful. Mourinho will win the league n I guarantee this 🔥
Custis gets bigger n bigger every time he's on the show. Put all that weight back on after van gaal mocked him. Fat boy lool
Man United had 1 shot on target and 6 touches in the opposition box, Custis you clown ;  they have spent £300 million in one year, so scoring 4 against teams in the bottom half of the table should be easy. But whenever Mourinho plays against a top club,  ( who might have good players,  )  he simply  concentrates on just stopping them playing, despite the talent that   he has at his disposal-especially away from home.  United were boring and offensively clueless yesterday; you would expect more attacking intent from a top club.  That is not me saying that Custis; but Gary Neville
FSG OUT. Zero ambition.
Turns into Walter White at 4:10
Oh God, he is so damn good at telling stories!!
He didn't play Hal from Malcolm in the middle. He IS Hal from Malcolm in the middle!
OMG I love this guy sooo much  XD
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.
Hitman really let himself go
Who else read the title as Bryan Cranston Got Caught Having A Sex Tunnel In The Alps
Anyone else notice Colin Farrell has his Fantastic Beasts haircut? I hope he comes back, he was one of the best parts (Much better than Johnny Depp).
 Say no more 
He reverted back to the hilarious Hal from Malcolm in the Middle days
What a weird story to tell lol didn't think he'd go into details lol god damn it Hal! Lois must've been mad
Wow his story telling skills are great.
Colin's joke at the end LMAO
Graham is better than any American talk show host. Easily. Stupid scripted yanks.
Just how?
Colin Farrell: Hold my beer.
I'd love to see Bryan and Colin in a movie together
Best story teller ever! love him!
I could listen to Bryan tell this stories for ages!! XD
His laugh is getting even more artificial and annoying.
Recycled by Colbert interview.......
Formation test lab actress flesh continue readily occupation address.
Should of have had him on the red chair!
What I love about ‘The Graham Norton!” The guest combinations , I came to see the guy from breaking bad , also got Nardole (Matt Lucas)
Guys who play serious roles on TV are the most funniest people irl
I'll take 15 minutes with Colin anywhere under any conditions.
Thank God for Collin's reactions lol
Dont watch the video, just watch 1:50
So night shows can talk about sex but invidual creators will get punished for it?
He is a great story teller!
HELP! PLEASE HELP ME GET TO 10,000 VIEWS WITH NO SUBS!!!
What a legend celebrity of our times a one worthy of celebrity title
This story sounds like something that Hal and Louis will experience.
47s put on the beef

You know what would be funny, if we found out he had sex with an alp in a tunnel.
I would invite him to my party!
he told this story in a interview like a year ago
Tunnelling a tunnel in the tunnel.
Maybe the agent said 15 minutes, but he heard 50.
I Love You So Dam Much Graham Norton!
lol hes a natural...

He's a master story teller
Absolutely love the man!
god this man is funny
This is the most ridiculous awesome story everrr LMAO!
Bryan Cranston is just such a great guy! Comedic, theatrical and plain nice.
How can you not love Bryan Cranston
That was a really good train noise
I’m just seeing and hearing Hal
Robin??? His frank underwood's wife claire his real life wife?
His voice is amazing!!! A la morgan freeman
And then he took meth.
The description is legit.
Maybe the travel agent said 15 and hopeful Brian Cranston heard 50 xD
i like how he is pants in america but says trousers in the uk..
been watching Graham Norton since V Graham norton on channel 4 , who remeber when Big Brovaz came on
So you could say, he found a stranger in the alps..
Hahah he’s so good at story telling 😂👌🏾
I can't stop laughing at his impression of italians 😂 so on point expecially the gesture at 3:59
Mute the sound. Bryant's visual action is more interesting and easy to understand lol
Bryan really knows how to tell a story. He is brilliant!!! :D
SEE WHAT HAPPENS\nWHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS
I can see the memes
best story teller, him and Chris Pratt
Colin’s hair looks awesome! Very 90s. I love it.
Hot videos http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5uxdP9lmOrTlkmHjG8owmnnZ5ikZsmQ9
Amazing story teller. Lol
I love him
Say no more fam.. 😂😂😂
Say no more. -Bryan Cranston 2017
me lol
Crystal!  ;)
Colin Firth is HOOOOOT
I caught him 😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Great story. Xx
Amazing story :D
All hail Bryan Craston for this story XDXD
Awesome
He is the one who knocks.Makes sense 😂😂
Or did his wife say stay out of my territory!
Ukh that farrell such a hillbilly... doesn't know how to act in public... go dig up some potatoes 🥔....
Must say ., Brian's 📓 makes a great *read., \n\nSadly, no bits @ v% 🌹🎦 event., or London specifically., wit 'Malcolm [ the Middle 📺🎬'. \n\nGlorious last line by moi Total *mC2F by Colin. 💙😎
This would have been an awesome if they hadn't had Bryan Cranston on the show. He is intolerable.
What does Colin Farrel say at 4:38 ?
SATANIC HOLLYWOOD
The Heisenberg part of Bryan's brain kicked in when he said Get Off Me
From his gestures and that cross that he made I can totally belive Colin is gay
Bryan Cranston is a SOCIALIST LIBERAL QUACK who wants to DESECRATE places because he’s a LIBERAL and LIBERALS destroy everything and want to destroy a generation of proud Christian republicans like myself.\nNO TO SOCIALIST QUACKS\n\nTRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP
I love how he told this story word for word on Conan a couple months ago. Cranston you dirty dog
Argo w Ben
looool who else just found this btec arsenalfantv channel
This guy has some good points but he sounds like KSI and it's off-putting
This white man looks black
Willian is so dreadful it’s not the first game, he has done absolutely nothing this whole season. He best not start on Wednesday, either Pedro or musonda should be given a chance to start.
I don't get it. League title has to be going to someone else. We can't drop points to teams like CP. I don't care who's injured.
I'm going to arsenal TV to get a laugh
Stop interviewing this guy. He speaks anger and not football.
Anyone else think this guy seems like a massive nob?
Always crying like a baby back bitch, no shame in losing to the mighty eagles. Were due a win.
Doesn't a condom already have a hole in it?🤔
Where do these people get time to rant like this? Son, you're a Chelsea supporter. Not a board member.
No bus no party. Why does conte inisist on playing on the counter. Why not commit instead of comitiing after you go down. They are not man city. Less than 60 percent possession which is disgraceful. 70 percent easy and if you have the ball. You will score. You have the quality in hazard.\nTo stop chelsea is easy. STOP THE COUNTER ATTACK AND CONTE IS USELESS.\nWhy play with so many defensive players?
Shit team shit supporters and thats the sample of it
Lewis someone called in sick we need you to come in early
Fucking hell that chant at the start might be the worst chant in football history
Zappacosta should start now that Moses is out injured
It really feels like the team can't be bothered, rather than Conte being to blame. But then again, the team, and manager didn't show any passion. It feels like the Mourinho disaster is happening again, only with Conte at the centre of a shit storm.
Fab was the only starter who actually played, he wasn't excellent, but compared to the rest he was ok. Mosonda should be starting ahead of William until he fixes homes himself up
You was singing his name when he scored to win you the league 😂😂
Hahaha ... :D \nBatsuayi indeed is very mediocre.\nBut let's hope Chelsea could bounce back. Let's support our team instead of mocking them shall we?
Why do chelsea fans moan just because they've lost one game?You lot win trophies year in year out and your fans are cocky after you lose 1-0 or 2-1.you lot have a problem...
This guy is bigger than DT.
why do all these random cunts keep stopping by and thinking they can give their 2 cents whenever they feel like it? mad disrespectful.
I think Conte wants to leave
I hopw to god ancelotti replaces conte this summer
I don’t know why black and Asian people support chelsea are you guys deluded they’re deluded. A bunch of middle class snoby asians and blacks support them don’t know their roots uncle toms
he can't even make won successful dribble, the moment i saw willian on the line-up i knew we were going to struggle. charly came in and his first dribble had a better chance at goal then willian attemping 100 dribble and failing 99.
WE FUCKING LOVE BEATING YOU 😂😂😂
3:17 is what your looking for!!!!!
Old and past their prime: Pedro, Fabregas, Cahill, Willian\nAverage: Alonso, Bats, Moses\nDecent: Zappacosta Rudiger\nGood: Luiz Bakayoko Musonda, Christensen, Hazard , Morata, Azpi\nClass: Kante\nThe fact that our team is made up of old washed up players along with average players playing a system that they don't understand proves how we have no chance of top 4 let alone winning any games in the future. A change is what's needed, the board and players have to go and the coach has to change the system but because our team is so stubborn and refuses change of course we will stay like this for the next few years
Why conte thinks or believes he can go 2 seasons playing one formation still baffles me! This chelsea team is easily predictable because the manager has failed to keep opponents guessing.substituting a striker when u need one and Willian starting games ahead of Pedro!!!!!!
Ppl can't even handle  one bad result. This is the beauty of premier league. Last season conte was magical this & that now suddenly he is this & that. Give some time we don't have proper 11 now due to injuries. Keep calm & support. Dont b glory hunters like man utd , arsenal. We don't have history but we are making in the process. Keep calm. KTBFFH.
Conte is becoming a bitch because he is not like he was at juventus. And if he gets the passion, ruthlessness and desire from juventus we will win the efl cup because we are shit cahill that anus, willian that anus,bastuyai that anus, they don't know how to play willian and bastuyai went from Messi to a Sunday league player. We need to sell them and buy better players but we all know it will never happen because our board is also shit and the fucking owner doesn't take matters in his own hands and sack fire and kick them (board) out of the door.and the last one we need to stop trying to get fouls and man up and aim to get a goal.
what a shit from Willian everytime when he gets the ball he loses it freely why. Batshuayi is another fucked up player being overrated what a shit. every time we start batshuayi and captain its a lose Why. are they committed to the team or they are being paid to fix games. Willian, Cahill and Batshuayi should be benched no matter what those players are fucking useless. Rudiger and Christen are much better on the back than what this old guy is doing for us. \n\nYeah Batshuayi is like a broken condom
Title is over man. Summer transfer was underwhelming coupled with these type of performances. Best we aim for top 4, try to win one of the domestic cup n maybe a decent run in the ucl.
If we can’t beat Crystal Palace and Burnley, what’s the point.
These southern fans need to get a grip imagine if you supported a club that actually struggles.
Batshuayi should just get outta club asap...willian has really been shit of late though...cahill should just be like JT and admit its past his time and settle for a spot on the bench but he is probably selfish thinking of a spot in world cup...i have a feeling this season will be like the season after we won the league two years ago....
City are light years away from any team in the PL right now. The top 4 is the real competition
You spoke the thruth all the way we better fix up or else watford is gone win over us like Arsenal.  No joke start making a transfer list of players we need now NOW AND I MEAN PLAYERS NO BUY TO LOAN OUT FFS
we really need to calm down! these things happen
he talks like Moh from ArsenalFanTV. same talking style
Shades of Arsenal Fan Tv
Football is shit ... :D ... Why would you give a fuck about it...
Oh m god this was too funny
Ok so we will just have to go ahead and win the champs league ...again.\n Keep the faith ppl.
Imagine fans who think matic would have helped us through this patch.
Naw, tell us how you really feel.
Win: WE'RE BEST IN THE WORLD. WE WIN THE LEAGUE. WATCH OUT MANCHESTER. \n\nLose: WE'RE SHIT BYE BYE TITLE WHAT A SHIT CLUB. \n\nMove past it. We were the worse team today. We were against Man City. We don't have two first-team-worthy XIs like some other clubs do. I wonder what these people were like during the 15/16 season, and how many ditched their club only to watch them win the next season. \n\nYou win on some days, you lose on others. We can talk about the contributing factors to today's loss or we can act like they aren't there whilst dismissing them as excuses, either way, move on or get left behind.
Totally agree with Lewis we were poor today and I don’t know why. Honestly hope the board and Roman were watching cuz they need to go buy another quality back up 11 for us cuz players are gonna get injured a lot this season for us
Chelsea is as good as a condom with a hole in it 😂😂😂😂😂😭so fucking upset
Well of course he sucks the guy comes from Marseille
i hate these so called chelsea fans let's hope the money runs out we go down to the championship and get the fck rid of these glory hunter fans GET OUT OF HOW CLUB
lol forget the title its long gone now, do you honestly think we can even compete with city
talk up the things lewis
We won't win the league for sure bcoz our squad depth is just totally shit.For Man City even without Aguero they are thrashing teams left and right bcoz they have another proven striker Gabriel Jesus.For United if Lukaku gets injured they have Zlatan , Rashford and Martial.But we have useless Batshuay.When he plays we become so shit that we can't even beat fucking Palace!!!!!!
You completely made my day mate. These words are 100% Chelsea now 😡😡
Trending with 9.2k views, well then I guess that Russian tycoon even bribed YouTube mods then.
i love this guy
Every time Michy gets a chance he absolutely blows it and has a shocker.We need to move Luiz into midfield and play Christiensen while Kante is injured
Exactly mate that was the best thing you have ever said lol, batshuayi needs to fuck off he is worst player in our team and if we can't get another striker in January we atleast have recall Tammy Abraham cause he has been brilliant so far for Swansea.
That brown guy probably celebrated like made when batman scored the winner against athletico, Fucking plastic hypocrite!
My man is a London Carlton from fresh prince of bel air
Michy didn't have a good game but neither did the whole team, he didn't get any service. WILLIAN is useless he needs to fuck off.
The production value behind this channel is so mediocre like the history of Chelsea Football Club. 👀
just fuck off copying arsenalfantv, dead content
100percent chelsea and Chill
Gladly take Willian of your hands!
JUST A SHIT AFTV \nSHIT AFTV \nSHIT AFTTTTVVVVV\nJUST A SHIT A F T V

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Bats man dumb Asf.... Willian & Cahill all the way washed up
Biggest wasteman on d channel
Whats gonna happen against roma 🙄
Willian\n- First Game: Poor\n- Second Game: Poor.\n- Third Game: Poor\n- Forth Game: Poor\n- On Repeat.\n\nWalker currently has 3 assists. Davies currently has 2 assist and 2 goals. Azpi currently has 3 assists. Moses really needs to fuckoff from the team! He cant even make an ordinary cross! Hes played more than 8 matches this season and this idiot is yet to score a goal or even make an assist. Bloody waste of space! \n\nI bet Alonso will find it difficult to cripple my crippled grandma\n\nWhat a shitty team we have!\n80% of the blame is on Conte.\nI dont give a fuck if you think otherwise.\n\nThank You!
Why so blue guys
Tbh I think Conte is looking to get sacked. He wasn't backed in the transfer window and he misses Italy. We'll probably get Tuchel. Not a huge loss for me tbh, he has no plan b and is too defensive.
A black Chelsea fan? Must be a paid actor
Chelsea can forget about retaining their title, they’ll struggle to finish top 4.
He is trying to act like troops # AFTV IS BETTER
This is way more hilarious than arsenal fan tv
lewis talks sense
You'd think these plastic fans can't get anymore fake , but yet again they fail to disappoint.This guy is clearly faking his emotion. C'mon rentboy, stop it!
Hazard is about as consistent as pigeon shit on Trafalgar Square.
I think Antonio is doing bad selections to lose games, so he can prove his point to the board for not bringing his transfer targets. I wander does it mean , that CFC will lose every game when Alvaro or Kante are out? Common Antonio. You have enough players to cover. You could have played Luiz in midfield today and leave Christensen in defence. Why on earth play Willian again , after a disaster against MC?
Luke won. Hands down. Fuck his voice is amazing!
Usher wins. Hands down.
Wow! Me encuanto!!
I am stopping watching him since he sold out to Apple music !!
Usher’s voice so smooth he sounds like a recording!!
Seriously Ushers gonna act like he didn't knowingly fuck up multiple women's lives? Take that herpes ass home
Need pentatonix for the next round
all is see now is herpes
the filharmonic are extremely talented and i HATE that everyone compares them to Pentatonix and says they're a knock-off.. like i get that Pentatonix made a capella mainstream. i LOVE Pentatonix, but i love OTHER a capella groups. that's right. OTHER. A CAPELLA. GROUPS. EXIST. so let every a capella group do their thing. geez.
for non-pro singer like luke evans it is not so bad...n he is more lot sexier than two other..haaahh
I mean, a Bard was a poet and singer. Kinda makes sense that Luke can sing like that.
He got the voice, he got the moves, he got the beats, he got the looks. The King!
My GOD Luke is so FIT
Uhhhh\nWHERE THE HELL IS KHALID?!?!?
Luke Evans is so talented! And very aesthetically pleasing.... 🤤😍🤠
Idk what all these comments are arguing about, James is clearly the sexiest... 😍😍
I never heard of Luke Evans before. He is smooth. Usher is always smooth. I am blown away by James Corden <3
I need to take Luke an a date ASAP before someone takes him away from me. Lol
omg... love!!! This just made my cheeks hurt from smiling. You're all awesome!!
What are the title of the those songs? Please hit the comment, if you do know ;)
Usher would've just killed the competition if he sang Climax
Love them all . Can't choose...lol
LUKE EVANS MY LORD! He can sing holllaaayyyy
Oh my gosh Luke I want one!
Lord give me strength!! 😍😍 Luke is gorgeous!
No love in the comments for the young dudes singing?
Why the fuck is this in recomendations
I'm sorry. Luke Evans got the looks (he can sing well too - obviously!) but USHER is hands-down still the smoothest singer out there! Be making babies with that voice
😍😍Luke Evans won by a Long Mile!! And deff the sexist man on that stage...
i was drinking water and when James said I am the sexiest male vocalist alive' then I split it on the floor.. \n(sorryformyenglish)
Damn Luke Evans can sing & he's gorgeous. XD
Omg, luke can really sing. I mean, I knew it, but he is incredible. I was like WTH!!!!!
Luke's boyfriend is soooooooo lucky!!!  And too bad the Filharmonic got no acknowledgement in the video description.  Just sayin'.
And guess what? Luke's got notes. Holy Shit! 👍😎
I feel like there aren't male artists out there doing sensual songs, it's not sexy anymore I beg to differ. Listen to SoMo and Bruno Mars and rethink what you have said
I am slightly disturbed that I had to wait over 7 minutes until Luke Evans showed up
When he said “someone get this man a tic-tac” lol
So from being in the Fast and Furious to then singing Jesus Christ
Usher should've sang pop goes the weasel,cause the weasel got HERPES!
james corden trying to fit in with the cool set
Usher gave both of them Herpes that night!!!
Luke Evans : Hit it boys !\nMe: 🤤
Those background guy singers are actually more beautiful than the actual singers😵
Luke won the riff off and my heart
Yeah America you can defiantly keep this fat idiot especially after those disrespectful jokes he made about sexual assault victims
Usher sounds like his voice has already been edited. SO SMOOTH
Wow all three of you guys are sexy but Luke surprised me with the level of sexiness. Love this,made day 😋😀😀😀
I clicked the like button, when Luke came on the stage.
Luke- a fine specimen! I think i heard my ovaries explode! Lol! 🤣
What’s the last song called?
No way this guy is married to a woman
James is the best. Niceness wins for me.
Thank you for blessing my ears James
I wish he'd stop trying to sing. We can all see he fancies himself as a vocalist.
Added in my favourites as soon as luke started singing 😍😍😍😍😍😍
He said he’s bringing sexy back BAHahHahHa!!!
Did I dream this, or isn't it a well known secret in the gay community that Usher is gay?
Welp… Luke won 😍
Came for Luke 😍😍
usher the winner
James Corden ripping off pitch perfect again lol
They were cute... 😊💖

“No one sings like Gaston” AGGHHH NOOO your gonna wake up my obsession with BATB NOOOO, I will not go back. I’m talking about a deep obsession like I need to go to a therapist, no I will not
They should've got Brendon Urie with his beautiful angelic voice
U fat
Mou is so right. Our midfield was decimated with injuries. A draw was a more practical result. Easy for punters to say but Mou is so logical.
This man said they had total control....when? I think i was watching the wrong game i guess lop
^Reason why Mourinho has been sacked more times than he has beaten Guardiola.
I love all the rant the manager gets after just one bad match which is not even a loss.
i'm a man.utd fan, but man.utd have so many deluded idiots supporting the club. i remember seeing 0-4, 1-3 type of predictions all over the place.\n\nfor me, i'm pleased with the result, but not with the performance. united have created too little, but conceded quite a lot of chances. these kind of away games are ok. as long as you don't lose them.\n\nsometimes i wonder if there is any good team in europe that jose wouldn't park the buss against... :)\nthe truth is that have good results so far, but even when united win 4-0, we never look that convincing throughout all 90mins.\n\nagain, i'm pleased with the result, but we cannot win the pl performing against top team like this, we have to improve a lot... GGMU!
One shot on target and he control the game 😭😭😭
lol at all the pissed off loserpool fans. united dont give rats arse about this match!!!!!
He is smarter than u think he is intelligent he came here not to loose that’s what he did if u saw his tactics u would know
GGMU  many plastic fan's 😡😠 win lose or draw man united till i die. 20 times Champions!!!
i totally agree with mourinho. we couldn't compete with liverpool's fluid midfield, so a draw is a good result.
Mourinho is anti-football. Guardiola makes him look like a lower league manager.
u cunt.. I have been waiting for you.. u spineless cunt.. stuff some cock down ur throat before u puke bullshit through ur mouth.. never ever play a game like this for united.. don't ever destroy the identity upon which this club was built on..
Spends £300 mill and says no bench and parks the bus against a side struggling for form. He really is special
People moaning about mourinho going and getting a draw this is what he does he is a boss watch when Liverpool go to Old Trafford I promise you 100% they will lose
Fucking Wanker
The Portuguese Pulis
Jose your a cunt mate
shittiest game for jose so far, they never turned up \nYou can't trust on lukaku to win you the game with one chance, he simply won't\nwhat happened to miki he was diabolical, liverpool should of scored by 3 goals but because of their poor form united got lucky.
José Van Moyes crying because Capitan Hendo was destroying Matic and Herrera in midfield today. lol
Not even a good manager anymore.
Haha, with all the money in the world and still cannot beat LFC. Maureen is the most expensive bus driver. Manure is crap as always!
Attack wins you games, defence wins you titles, simple as that. Good defensive football, is still good football. Only criticism of United is that they gave up one too many chances. But City the same amount vs Stoke at home* (not away like United) as United have all season in the league. This is how you're supposed to set up in big away matches, deal with it.
if al salah was a better finisher and mane was not injured, you would moan now, mr moaninho.
pragmatic approach is gonna win us the league
Man City is better than manure united
haha what a completed mong, they can't even come to Anfield to win. What a joke
Best manger ever
Imagine playing as badly as United did and still not getting beat. I think Klopp has more to answer for than Jose
Liverpool sour because we got that  point despite injuries. Controlled the game from start to finish. Looked too easy tbh, totally fucked up Loserpools game! Booya!! GGMU!!
Herrera should pair with Mata, Young is decent in defend but not in creating a chance. Rashford and Martial should play wings while Mata on middle to feed the ball. Mikha not doing good after international match
Mourinho is a crap manager who's cowardly tactics are only to save face..  If United wanted a defensive manager why not bring in an expert named Tony Pulis, and English manager who could do a far better job than Mourinho if that's the way United wish to go..  MOURINHO has to GOOOOOO!!!! this football is a disgrace and its embarrassing to be associated with it and I would never want to win the PL this way..  He's given far to much money and then he comes up with this rubbish???
looking forward to the return of IBRA
united cunts u had 1 shot on target i did not even know if lukaku was playin
Bus parking specialist. His lame tactics ruined the game. I look into his eyes and all I see is fear, has always been afraid to go toe to toe with Klopp. He is a coward.
Jose this isn't 2005 - Man City steam rolling teams with United played for a draw. De Gea is world class.
Grow some balls you pussy ass bitch. Nobody wants to watch this utter shite.
Jose can park the bus all he wants but city will win this league and win it in style.
It wouldn't matter if Mourinho had every attacking player in the world bcoz he'd still park the bus. ( don't cry I'm not a Liverpool fan)
of course he wouldnt change the midfield you retard they were dominating
Our midfield kept United at bay and that's why we didn't make a change in the middle. I would've took the risk and put Sturridge on for Can a bit earlier but if we had've changed our shape that might've played into United's hands, making it easier for them to counter attack us. Even though we weren't the best up top to win the game, yet again United got off lucky
i have no bench? only two injured and you have no bench . how much have spent on players? you had  lingard n rashford, blind wtf.
ah the premier league the best league in the world? fuck off
we all know what united came for the draw like he said  him self he had no answer for the Liverpool  midfield  we all know this is so familiar with his sides when he comes to Liverpool . is saying we got what we came for  the right attitude really every body wants to win and believes there the best by winning  and when they know they cant win just go for the draw . but by setting up for the draw simply sends out a signal that we know  cant win so we will hold them get men behind the ball and hold on . we got what we came for is a excuess. every united  fan had this down as a united win .in fact what they got was Liverpool dominated  so they parked the bus as he said him self had no answer for Liverpool  midfield . so what you get is a climb down from a win to a draw is better than a loss from the fans so we got what we came for is there conclusion  .the manager knows different from the fans  he sets up for the draw know in he cant win . a manager knows more about his team than the fans do the way he sets up a team to play teams says it all .
As a neutral, that game was boring as fuck. Why the fuck did I wake up at 7 30 ffs
Liverpool fan here, Only the kitchen sink was missing in the man united team today. We played really well, but happy with a point considering the opponent.
if you listen closely you'll hear Gaga's poker face in the background.
He almost said i need fellaini..haha...jose love affair with felly...\nAm Happy with a point..fairplay.
So glad Sky didn't hype this one up to be banger of a match, oh wait...
at 66, I've been a Man U fan since the days when the 'Holy Trinity' were playing the game and we were at best a top ten side but let's face it guys Man Utd and Liverpool.....two GIANTS of English football.....respect to both clubs and may the rivalry continue !
i'm really excited to see what he'll do against pep guardiola
The way everyone is reacting.  It's like manU was beaten. Yet we chealsea are keeping cool.  You guys seem like you not grateful at all. ManU can't even win the league if that's how you criticize your coach.
MOU tell ur fans when ure parking the bus so they don't waste time watching the game.. looking the scoresheet will be enough.
I  think that was a good draw for united.
Jose you sound like a bi+ch
Why is he crying for? 😂😂😂
Ahhhh ...the floyd mayweather of football.\nFunny thing is, City win the title.\nJewse Mourinho
Dissapointing that this was our first chance to put a bigger team to the sword. A point at annfield isn'tanything to be sniffed at though. My only worry is if we can actually play better than this against other big teams, which remains to be seen. Game plan aside, our players were poor today.
Don't lose heart M.U..1 point better than a defeat..Long journey n more matches to go.. Coraggio!
A 0-0 draw with Liverpool means Mourinho has now gone ten straight games without a win at Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham or Saturday’s opponents. His sides have drawn five and lost five of those games, conceding 15 goals and scoring just four times. Just one of those away goals have come since he was appointed at Old Trafford.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a dickhead
United you are pathetic, barely made it alive out there 😂😭😂 im watching the City vs Stoke game as we speak. Its already 3-0 29min in. Top of the league baby (end result: 7-2)
is jose high? how the fuck were united in control?
Grey-haired fraud. Fraudinho
Big thumb up Jose..
I'm sorry but not matter what you say, man united were embarrassing. Is this what we have come to? United coming to Anfield for a draw, tell what other untied side would accept that? Sir Alex wouldn't, and even LVG didn't. Embarrassing.
Fuck u
What a prick.
boring boring manager
parked the bus again munich scumbags
We missed fellaini
What a total crap, Ur a looser José.
Bus parked again :)
Gobshite
Fucking clown
Fucking arrogant cum bucket
Boring Boring man Utd and Mourinho the bore
what a fucking tool
Jose Mourinho... the special Portuguese cunt
Piss poor! De gea saved us again!
yes jose
Clown ! Mata was in our bench and he did not use him. Instead kept Mikhy on for 60 mins. We made Liverpool look like a good team and it's Joses fault. He should go and retire in Portugal, I am sick of hearing his excuses.
Jose, this game is one of those we weren't going to win with pace alone. Liverpool were the quicker team. We needed to pass the ball around more elaborately and effectively in the final third. We needed to get more ball possession. A more italian, barcelona style. The tactics before the game weren't going to win this one. Liverpool knew how to block all our attacking transitions from the back to the front. This was one of those games where we needed more variety of repertoire to craft out an opportunity, we just didn't have the players and the football to play in that way this time. Herrera was ineffective and not good enough if compared to Modric, that's the kind of player we need to complement Pogba. Darmian offered no attacking threat in the left hand side. You mentioned Mkhitaryan that has no build up know how compared to Mata. Not enough tic-tac passing football. It's amazing we had a chance in the whole game. Fellaini would have been the only other way we would have won it.
United fans when Mou managed Chelsea - parking the bus with a £££ team, lol pathetic man\n\nUnited fans when Mou parks the bus now - great point, we had injuries and we only had £450m in the squad today, Mou is a genius
disgrace to football
It's Henderson not Anderson you fucking badger
You are full of shit you fucking cunt you had the game under control liverpool had chance after chance if it wasn't for the keeper and the ref you would have lost badly you parked the bus again as you always do when you play liverpool because you have not got the balls to attack you coward
Jose Mourinho killer of football, Fergus will be rolling in his whiskey filled grave. Pathetic that you manc fans accept that, this is all your club has to offer. Should have signed Allardyce or Pulis.
Fucking shit because he parked the bus even though he said he would play attacking football
park the bus format came when chelsea stop lfc for winning tittles. parl the bus is team who has no chance winning tittles or just avoiding losing. its midtable mentality and relegation team mentality.
*Mourinho played the exact kind of Football that can make you to want to stop watching the game altogether*\n*Disgraceful from Mourinho*\n-From an United fan from the last 12 years!!
United fan here and love Jose but there's no chance we're winning the title. No fucking chance.  We'll finish 2nd and City will probably win it by at least ten points. We just don't have their firepower going forward. We need another couple of players...
Mourinho just turned the biggest game of the season into the biggest bore.United play like Chelsea and that's sad.Such a let down.
We controlled the game? 😂😂😂 sorry but im a man united fan and by lookin at the game stats and the game itself im embarassed 😭😭 we played like a championship side lol
It’s crazy how mourinho is saying klopp didn’t go for the game, when he is the one that played this defensively. It’s laughable how he is trying to act so innocent. You the same man that spend 200 plus million to create a squad that goes to games to defend
You son of a bitch saying no one else on the bench
FUCKING NIGGA ASHLEY YOUNG SHOULD BE RAPED BY 27 BIG BLACK DICKS. THAT FUCKING USELESS BIRD POOP EATING WANKER
No bench? Mata?????
He says Liverpool are better and united don't have the players to compete.\n\nBoth sides had injuries, id say losing mane and lallana is worse than losing pogba and fellaini though. \n\nMourinho always has an excuse when he doesn't win and he'll never admit he played for the 0-0 from the off
So dull and boring. But then thats what u get when jose is your manager
Jose is spot on. I saw the same that Klopp was scared of taking off one of those midfield players cause we would have killed them after that. I think we could have still scored but the passing in our buildup was poor. Good point. We will put them to the sword when they come to the theater of dreams. GGMU
1st real test, 1st bus parked. You fucking pussy. I'd rather lose than watch that utter shite. Grow a pair
still undefeated for the season hehe
HAVE YOU SEEN CHELSEA LOSING TO CP ? OR ARSENAL TO WATFORD ? HELLO THIS IS REAL FOOTBALL NO ONE CAN CONTROL IT LIKE YOU DO WITH ALEX HUNTER'S JOURNY IN FIFA !
This man and Utd are afraid of big teams confirmed..\n\nOnly picking on small sides and hiding away from the big boys...\n\nLiverpool should have scored their chances.
was anyone seriously surprised? he is too scared to play against big teams away lol park the bus fc
Everyone is complaining about Jose parking the bus, yet here he explains brilliantly how Klopp is no different. Klopp basically matched Jose in substitutions and tactics, refusing to make the first move to actually threaten United's defence. Especially for someone at home, lying 7th in the table and 7 points adrift, you take out Salah, Coutinho and Firmino as soon as Lingard & Rashford come on? Is this what heavy metal football looks like? It doesn't matter though. Hugging your players on the pitch instantly makes you a better manager.
Soo... basically he regrets that he didn't have Schweinsteiger. :P
Jose has found the keys to his bus I see
The truth is this, Van Gaal would not have played difensive against Liverpool neither would SAF have. Liverpool defense was shit and Jose made them look like class. As a United fan if you are not disappointed with the display and the fact that Jose went for a draw even before the game then you need to be his assistant.
Tot you'd be happy with losing 2pts against a cheap team you are a real idiot and we don't need cowards.. No chance to go to France?
The English press talks too much. Sometimes it unnecessary. He (Jose) had a game plan and he did exactly that based on the way the opponents played. A draw is always better than losing
So he waited for Liverpool to give him a chance to attack? What kind of a game plan is that???
If Tony pulis, sam allardyce or sean dyche play like this and they are ridiculed and called out for ruining the game. Yet this horrible cunt mourinho does it and he is praised master tactician, genius bla bla. Get a fucking grip and pull your tongues out of his and man utd’s asses. He came for a draw that is it. Tell me any top team in the world goes out to a direct rival to get a point. I thought big bad man utd where running away with the league smashing teams? Oh ye thats right they have played nearly everybody in the bottom half of the table and the first good team they come up against and guess what they hardly got a kick of the ball. Fucking frauds
Jose the anti football bus parking cunt. Fucking embarrassing. He is just a glorified Tony pulis.
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Arsenal lost 2-1 to Watford.
This man is ruining what used to be the best fixture in the world, Liverpool vs United, he come in with a squad worth 250 million and parks the bus, its rlly depressing
am a man u fan he didnt park the bus he park a double decker bus
Klopp was the pussy if you can’t see that u have got problems
Jose had a good game plan, our players did not turn up for the game. Lukaku is a very good striker but is not that clinical for me at times. A game away if you get a single chance you must score twice. That could have changed the game completely. Liverpool could have broken up the mid 3 and played right into Jose's game plan. We were easily giving the ball away, I miss Pogba and Fellaini they dont lose the ball unnecessarily
Ryans Gigs criticised Moyes for being a 'respond to the other team' kind of coach, rather than being ManU and doing things their way. Jose does the same as Moyes, complains that the other coach doesn't let his side play, and he is some kind of super coach? Amazing.
lol these reporters are out to wind up Mouringyo
he sends andreas pereira on loan and moans for having no midfield playes on bench.....pereira would have been great value in this squad.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN U
ramicoo bro liverpoo fans are honestly living in the past. Wake the fuck up its not 70s anymore. They are just pissed off cause they were waiting for a battering and didnt get it so they thought utd are there for the taking and even then they managed a 1 proper chance on goal by their defender for crying out loud. Where is your 120 million super star that u now wish u sold him to messilona after his memorable performance yesterday especialy the cheap dive to get a pen. FUCK OFF SCOUSERS
Mkhtaryan was useless he had no effort in him! Overated and our worse buy in 4 years!!
This result proves the only reason man utd have been on form is because they have played bottom half teams. They will lose every game against top 10 cos they're fucking shit with an arrogant black stinky cunt for a striker
Jose Borinho complaining that he doesn't have enough players haha.....Give him another £300m to spend.  He hasn't spent enough yet lol
Valuable point, against a difficult opponent away from home. For me, as a fan, it wasn't an exciting game, but I'm happy that we got a point. I'm expecting a lot more dominance from United in the Old Trafford fixture though.
Chelshit fans ranting about United parked the bus again. Chelshit played good football and got 0 points. You coudlnt simply beat Zaha. Mourinho is one of the best managers in English football. Salute from an Arsenal fan.
Liverpool fan here, of course Jose didn't play attacking here, why would he? We press high an aim for the neck, he sheltered the neck. Sure it wasn't exciting but there is 22 players on the pitch that can change that, all the managers can do is set a base, United were not good but we could not score either, they left with a point. I would take a point at OT too. Next game, let's go YNWA
come on!!! why should he give you opportunity to counter attack????? you say they were very defensive??? come on!!! who was more defensive???
I'm all 'bout that bus, 'bout that bus, no treble
He definitely go for a draw.. i can feel jose had a lot of pressure after last season.. he could have been sacked if he didnt win europa league after all the money  he spend.. so now he tried the best to not losing by parking ke train and not sacked by the bus..
People complaining ?? Looks like draw but it's beautiful 1 points, kloop worked on defending I think
Man that's an ugly shirt.
scared of playing against Liverpool what will United do against European tops teams mid week? lmao
Jose Jose jose. Guardiola is playing de bryun and Silva both number 10 in midifield if Jose wants to really control the game he could have payed mata but he didn’t want to take risk. However as a Man U fan I think he did the rit thing by parking the bus. Fergi have done it, so why not Jose ?
Played for a point and can't even admit it
How is this on trending?!
LFC there for the taking and he bottled it
Fucking dickhead blaming his midfielders instead of his shite tactics. This man is a coward. Liverpool are shocking defensively, take the initiative and put them to the sword. This is cowardly. He played the same vs Southampton in the second half after going 1-0 up. Coward.
Man United manager doesn't care what fun say or think .\nThat what I like to morinho .
Everytime Arsenal depresses me, i always remember the mighty united spent 90m on a walking haircut to finish 6th and celebrate a EFL cup.
I'm a big fan of Jose but that performance today was irritating. For me he should've used a 3-5-2. Just no attacking threat today, our momentum has slowed down after the last few games.
One team wanted to win this game, embarrassing it’s hard to break down 11people behind the ball
Could be worse -- just look at Chelsea
İ am not Liverpool fan but Liverpool was better team
I don't think that Mourinho played for a point but I think he later tried to save a point
Mourinho does not allow big teams to beat his sides. Away from home, all big home teams shall attack, hence mourinho having to counter that. United were away, both teams have champions league in midweek- everybody content with 0-0. Liverpool have to make a show as they are home...
no midfielder ???? who’s fault is that???
really a villain, could do anything to support the cause.
How is 9k views in 6 hours ‘trending’
Man Utd fan here. I agree with what Mourinho was saying. Watching the game, Liverpool had more possession and pressed higher, but they could not unlock our defense. Both teams were trying to nullify each other's attacks. Liverpool tried to keep the ball and pressing high when they didn't so they get the ball back. Man Utd were defending in numbers to counter-attack Liverpool, which has been a weakness of theirs. Klopp didn't risk removing a midfielder to reinforce their attack, because it meant that a space would form in the middle which would help our devastating counter-attack. He knew if we countered it would be over, so he played it safe. Both teams were defensively strong but Liverpool were poor in attack and we were waiting to attack. \n\nI don't mid the defending in numbers. What frustrated me was the sloppy passes and possession loss when we did have the ball. Our midfielders gave the ball away too much. This is why Pogba is good in counter-attacking. He has the best range of passing arguably in the world and would've been better for possession when we had possession.\n\nNevertheless, coming to Anfield is tough so a point is enough. United will be happier with the point though, especially with Liverpool's shit form. 1 win in 8 games, are you okay?
mourinho is a liar
Mr. Parkinho!
Mou is classic.
manu lack creative mid fielders
1 point is still 1 point. no pobga no fellaini.
Jose fucking coward
Klopp has spent 34 Mio overall in 2 years , Mourinho 254 Mio 2 years
Good job Mourinho!
Haters - liverpool didnt win.... man utd didnt lose ==== what shit r u talking about
Calm down guys, Chelsea lost today......
Get a grip Jose!
Trending?
BORRRRRRRING GAME . WORST game this season
Terrible game
without retracts please !!
👿👿0/0:(
He's waiting for Klopp to make the first move. Such a counter attacking manager against top sides. Even with the absences he had more than enough talent to take the game to them.
Shark is waiting to gobble moron mourino.
Jose you are talking BS. I have followed United for 28 years, and this is what you give back to our tradition. Sir Alex would never have done that. He would have gone for it, in the best of traditions of United. This is typical Jose play...
this guys full of shit moaning about Jurgen klopp didn't let him win the match lool
Bus wanker.
DrawchesterUnited😂😂😂😂
blah,blah MU didn't win bcoz pogba is injured and klopp did not go out full attack! \nmou is a shit manager!
destroy football.....idiot mourinho play football we are mantsester united and you spent 300....what football is that;;;barca real united bayern play attacking fotball..histor...bastard you destroy the team we are not chelsea or inter.....
where was the 200 million buget team offensively? if he couldn't win this liverpool, in this form, in this period, he will never beat it.
GGMU  win lose or draw man united till i die, 20 times Champions!!! many plastic fan's (kids?) 😡😠 If you can't win, draw is good. J.M won more at Man Utd than J.K and P.G at loserpool and SHITY 😂
Jose should be ashamed of himself today, we played like wba. Second half he went so defensive it was utter crap football. Why not go for it with 20 mins left, is that what Utd are gonna do every time we play a top six away, it's not good enough for man Utd. Sorry but that was embarrassing
Garry Neville is full of shit.
Liverpool were all over you, \nU prick.
jose,jose, here ,over here, boring as fuck jose,man united charlatans again jose. here jose .millions spent and no joy jose. chelsea what jose, liverpool better .yes that is true. united found out again .
am so glad this bus parking man get out of my club.
Why didn't Mourinho envisage the possibility of the formation that Klopp chose and have a mid-field  player on the bench to deal with it. Isn't that what coaches do especially the Special One? Of course he didn't come for 3 points but just the 1.
Listen 1:15-1:55 He Said that he didn't have a lot of Midfielders cm/cmds Only Matic and herrera  thats why he went for a draw\nNext game Guarantee a win
Back in the days he did it at Chelsea it worked because he had Drogba, who would have finished that one ‘Lukaku’ chance. Fact is he still parked a double decker! If Salah had left that ball for Coutinho this story would be different.
Chicken-shit manager with chicken-shit scared defensive tactic. Nothing new from arrogant shit. Big game against big opponent and he goes defensive. His explanation is BS. He is a reactive manager. I hope City smashes them 5-0 like Barca did his Real M in 2010.
Did not do the job needed during the transfer market. He should have bought 2 or 3 midfielders and atleast 2 more strikers. He bought a holding mid, a defender and a striker. Terrible mismanagement for a “topmanager” at a big club as Manchester United is. \n\nManchester United will run into the same issues as they’ve had last year. When injuries and suspensions show up the club has no back up, which will cost points. I am pretty sure that we will see more of these kind of matches if they won’t do their job the next transferwindow.
When you play a quicker team. Start trying playing first more italian. Then play like Barca.
A 0-0 draw with Liverpool means Mourinho has now gone ten straight games without a win at Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham or Saturday’s opponents. His sides have drawn five and lost five of those games, conceding 15 goals and scoring just four times. Just one of those away goals have come since he was appointed at Old Trafford.
Meanwhile city keep bangin goals. Thats the diference between Pep and the bus driver.
KLOPP SPENT 120M SINCE OCTOBER 2015\n\n300M SPENT SINCE JULY 2016. HE'S A PATHETIC NEGATIVE FRAUD
Mourinho and utd..... SHIT!!!!!
Klop and jose are far to smart for so called journalists with their negative comments
Special one👏
What makes me mad is idiots that do not understand how deeply depleted the team is at this period of time, which Mourinho is trying to conceal as much as he can. Get it: no Bailly, no Rojo, no Carrick, no Pogba, no Fellaini and on top of that injured Rashford. Why Mouhrinho played defensively and Lukaku did not get service, because Mouhrinho is realistic, he got the maximum today and Lukaku had his chance to score. That is all Mkhitaryan's fault.
All this week José Bus Company was doing his job which was parking bus for a living and that's when he got his tactics from today game. Boring Boring Boring Wankchester United as allways.
This perfectly encapsulates my current apathy for Star Wars. I've been making all these points to my friends since Force Awakens but most of them are all aboard the hype train just because the new movies are better than the prequel films like that's actually praiseworthy.
I enjoy your comedic work, but I much prefer your serious/honest reviews of movies and trailers. So, of course, I loved this. Your intellectual and academic approach to what most people consider mindless entertainment is greatly appreciated in this age of fast food and the pill. Keep it up with your straight-forward, unflinching critiques and reactions. In Trump's America, we can really use some news that isn't fake or hashtag sad. You deliver the heart and the information that we need; no punches pulled and every square inch of those college film minor degrees being put to use. You're doing The Lord's work, and the people dig it. Smiley emoji.
8,ooo and something'th! That high huh?
What... the hell is Mike wearing...?
Watching these guys talk about and make fun of movies has become significantly more fun than watching movies. You just broke hollywood. Grats.
We are all individuals
I think this episode is when it went from being parody to being another trailer reaction video. All be it a funny one.
They annihilated Star Wars and comic book movies in general.
Rich Evans... in the houuuuuse.
I love the biting satire in these videos, but what they are making fun of is so unbearable I can barely make it through these.
I guess RLM doesn't just hate Star Wars fans, but they also hate Nerd Crew fans XD Stoklasa in the HAH-OUUUSE
When can we expect to see a porg standalone film?
My favorite part is that they nicely decorated the set with all those toys and then just plopped down a big pile of Gamorrean Guards. Nice touch.
This video was\n\nVEEERY cool. Gotta clap for that.
Perfectly captures the mentality that keeps tired franchises alive.  LOL!!  ;)
That trailer reaction segment was once of the bets things ever.
Worst reaction they keep speaking middle of the trailer 👎👎
I'm super hyped for STAR WARS!!!!!!!
DO YOU GET IT NOW PAUL FEIIIIIIIIIIIIIG!?
Mike's suit and glasses makes this worth the watch alone
Love all the toy nostalgia, reminds me of my childhood with all my He-Man and Star Wars toys :-D
I had to pause after 6:23. I was fucking dying
The Last Jedi looks like shit.
Oh my God. I thought my eyes were deceiving me for a second when I saw this image.\nhttp://cdn.movieweb.com/img.news/NEGZq54WihMlJO_1_1.jpg\nAs you can see the xwing is underwater which means Rey is going to copy Empires scene. The one where Yoda lifts it out of the water. Ohhhhh myyyy Godddddddd.
Inspire Your Imagination on that box during the final scene killed me.
I am glad they are satirizing trailer reaction videos because they are pointless.
Holy shit, the middle part was surreal
That list of stuff coming out...a bit like a jazz piece. :)
RedLetterMedia! Thank you guys for such a terrific content! I hope you all feel as appreciated as you truly are! Great work guys :)
I need that Rich Evans fast food review channel. I'm not depressed enough.
This is performance art.
saw this in my recommended viewing..... and I clapped !
The problem with dc is not aquaman and cyborg. It’s that they panicked and let committees decide on too many movie elements, ending up in extremely weird tonal shifts, plot holes and the editing of a crack addict. Now they are trying to let us have some fun with the characters which really feels out of place. And undeserved. And why the hell was Jesse Eisenberg trying to kill Batman and Superman?
The only thing this video is missing is a half goat man with a huge dick.
I laughed so hard at Mr. Piggys fast food review xD love you guys
Does this mean that I have to get a Porg as a face?
Oh the sarcasm \nIt makes me feel ashamed of myself for watching react videos
i love how the trailer actually shows everything in the movie.\n\nwhy pay money, amirite?
I watched a video in a T-shirt with a stormtrooper.\n\n\n\nWell. Shit.
It's so dense
That pile of 80s Gamorrean Guard figures on the right side of the desk...?  OK, that's pretty hilarious.
This world doesn’t deserve The Nerd Crew.
I think this would have worked better if it had been more subtle.  Some good lines,  but a bit exhausting.
It's weird you pronounced feels as chills
Mike's suit makes me physically ill
They absolutely nail it on their humor every video! 😂
Its got a good taste. The taste is...good. Okey thank you for watching. XD
Jesus fuck the first minute is.. my gawd gotta get religion involved
I'd subscribe to watch Rich eat things.
If you can't beat them, join them.
Jeremy, I wish you hadn't played that footage...
RLM is the meta Screen Junkies & Collider. I love it. xD
Find a good beatbox performer and transform those trailer reactions into YouTube quality rap videos.  However now my serious query, are those Porg mugs...so from Amazon or maybe Hot Topic? RLM keeps me (sort of) sane. Thanks.
Mike looks like John Rocha's gay brother.
I bet you'll watch this turd won't you? But you didn't give  a Transformers the last knight a review did you?
Does anyone else think that Rich Evans is cute? If it's just me, I'm okay with that.  Sharing was never my thing anyway.....
You taking a dig at my boy reviewbrah? You're gonna have to fight me first, my dudes. NO ONE fucks with the reviewbrah. NO ONE.
Gentlemen... I believe everyone here would agree you've unironically broken new ground. Dare I say, the name RedLetterMedia will one day be spoken of in the same breath as Monty Python, The Kids in the Hall, and the like. I shall forever brag that I knew of them before they were all mainstream. Keep up the genius.
Congrats on your new ranking guys🤓🤓🤓Your reactions were so original and thought provoking. I can't wait to watch you guys watch the new Yoda Rape Chronicles Snuff Film trailer🤗🤗🤗 Lots of love and hugs and kisses from the Nerd Crew's biggest fan ever. P.S. I have yet to receive the nude photos I requested of Rich taking a dump in the shower. I would appreciate it if you could send me those ASAP. You guys are the best😍😍😍
I remember 10 years ago, thanks to Youtube a lot of people were getting to see Japanese TV shows for the first time. A very common format for their variety talk shows was to have some crazy skit or gag and to always show the face of one of the hosts/guests in the corner to see their reactions. Back in the 00s, people asked what the hell was up with that, and it was explained it was like a laughtrack to them.\n\nNow here we are in 2017 and not only has this become the norm for Millennials, but the actual subject has been become secondary to some spaz reacting. And thanks to reaction videos, some Swedish clown can make millions doing nothing but screaming, I'm being raped! while playing video games.
I thought the purple space emperor was Thor's dick.\n\n\n\n\nWhat?
This genuinely creeps me out, I've never realised how lifeless and toxic nerd culture is. Fucked up if true
A POEM\n\nThere's a lot to be said about the imagery\n\nof a cyborg hurling a merman\n\ninto the sky\n\nso that that merman\n\ncan throw his trident\n\nat a space insect
The Collider crew in a nutshell.
I cant look at this as a parody. Its literally the screen junkies crew.
Just want more Star Wars movies so I can watch more of this stuff.
I just want to see each shot slowly has each of the toys in the back become more and more bloodied, throughout the video.
I bet Rich actually does have diabetes
Ooooh Salty! I heard a series of loud bangs over at the Collider offices, as the entire staff collectively shot themselves...
Fuck me, I usually get personal when I watch RLM, but holy fuck that was hilarious
So uh, The Last Jedi kind of looks boring.
Jesus Mike, that fucking suit. You look like such an asshole
VERY COOL, AGAIN!

OOOHHHHHH MYYY GODD ITZZ STARWAARRZZ!!!!!

Woooaahhh
You guys are truly perfecting your craft!  Amazingly spot on satire and hilarious as always!  Cheers!
Their commentary is so biting, I actually got a massive headache from watching this. Thanks NerdCoffin!
rich is so baked
I can smell double toasted fans out there. 😑
ha...ha... its funny how poorly this video was put together
I love red letter media, but think the nerd crew is played, relying on the same heavy handed jokes again and again. Often repetition can be funny, but not in this case.
Collider sucks
I object. I find the Marvel films to be much darker, more intense and serious than the DC  ones. Were you guys making a subtle joke trying to invert that? Not that I have anything against the DC ones in general. They're mindless and just there as mindless entertainment, mindless fun. Marvel movies are more deep and symbolic. Why do you rag on the Marvel franchise so much? Is it because you wish your own movies were more serious, and / or funny?
The fact that the world number one diver does cheap Halloween costumes while living in prime estate astounds me. I feel so blessed to be living at this age and time.
The sound he makes when he takes the box off is hilarious
Let me just say that, Lance has his hands full with you!  LOL, what a clever boy you are!
Tom Daley - the craft daddy we didn't know we needed
Were you worried Lego would sue you if you made it look any good?\nEmbarrassingly bad for an adult.

I am so in love omg you are so cute
new gaming channels subscribe to me I subscribe back lets help each other
is that my roblox character?
i thought it was a pair of boobs in the thumbnail so i thought this was a joke video
Great idea for a costume!
I just started my YouTube channel and recently uploaded some videos \nPlease make sure to check out my YouTube videos and also Like and Subscribe  \nThank you ❤️
When i was little i was scared of cutting myself with scissors bt i realize its a 1/10 chance you will
Just get a can of black shoe polish to paint your face and a sharp kitchen knife. You can be OJ Simpson and the costume only costs about $3.
Too much effort.  Tom really should have done something with a g-string and some body paint.
so cute i love it
In a more professional than it needs to be way, if anyone tries this in the future, grab a product called Gesco. It goes on before the paint and helps the paint stick on better and is generally a good underlying coat for any absorbing product (cardboard, paper, etc).
You could have a cutout eye and glue it or something on to yourself as a cloud to make the 'iCloud'
OH NO! HE CUT OFF HIS FLAPPY BITS! \n[faints] \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Ok I'm here for some reason lets make a joke...\n\n\n\nHis head kinda looks like its made from pizza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I get a BONELESS pizza
Tbh I thought the thumbnail was some retarded person making a Roblox avatar bullshit thing and it had tits
YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR VLOGS TOM DAILY
With your cuteness, you can't make a scary Halloween costume, I'm sorry!
How did you get the arm holes even?

This was so funny! Not very scary but a good idea 😂😍
You’re like 20 bro stop making costumes especially roblox people
Good and Terrible....
This is your most environmental friendly clip!! We do not need to buy everything, it is much more fun and environmental friendly to make our own costumes!
Dude!! that was impressed... I had fun with your video about HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN COSTUME.... lol\nGreetings from your fan from Paraguay!
He is too sweet. I wish there were more gay boys like him, dating is hard.
Tom, I met you on the London Underground Train in and took a picture with you and so did my sister! Sorry that I forgot to say thanks, but you are a great diver!
I enjoyed listening to the Thriller cover music in the background.  Good choice, Mr. Editor.
This is so cute and hillarious=)) i can't omg lololol
I have such a crush on Tom 😩
can i say tht u're so cute and not even scary sorry tom but the costume well done👍
He is so cute. Like lil brother :))

I'm exited cause im visiting london next days. Hope to see you soon
I watched it in a public place.. can you guess how people looked at me when this video was at 4:07 ?
Looks great!!\nYou could try and put some sort of see through netting on the mouth area so it's a little more difficult to see your face. Just a suggestion.
You make me laugh when i saw you used the costume 😂 but its great i dont have idea for my Halloween but now i have idea thanks a lot :)
You are very clever with your hands!!!
This inspired me! I'm going to try to make an actually good homemade costume this year, I do them every year but usually ten minutes before I need them so they always suck.
I can just hear Lance now Oh Tom:
You do the most diverse things in your videos.  That keeps it interesting and you are consistent in your posting too.  Watching you do things from cooking, working with children, exercising and more shows your diversity and shows different sides of you too. Thank you for your efforts.
nice, Tom! it looks really cool and original
Wait that circle cut was his head 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he couldn’t get out the box
Now you need to make one for LANCE! Two Lego pieces that stick together.  ;)  Although I'm not sure where the scary part would fit...it would only be cute, cute, cute!
The noises he makes when he's putting in the costume is adorable it is will to live
Very creative.Great job! :-)

And even with Harvey stealing headlines, Seth Meyers hasn't gone a show, or possibly even a segment without a Trump joke in over a year.  Count your days Seth, when Trump is gone your pathetic diatribe, and show, will be too.
Your lying... so many times! FEMA was already there before the storm hit...
Why are you forgetting Bill and Hillary Clinton?
Why do so many DRUMPFUKATEERS  like to comment on here, to continually prove and demonstrate their incredible amount of STUPIDITY that they possess ?
I think we hit a nerve folks! Just look at this comment section xD
If you listen, and believe this, you are a complete fucking idiot. Total leftist bullshit. What about Bill Clinton and Weinstein and Hillary covering for Bill? What's disgusting is that our country believes everything told to them over biased social media networks, making this country a worse place.
Yea, this guy (Seth), is horrible... You have to be completely out of touch with reality to actually sit and pollute your mind with his garbage. The character of people like Hillary and this complete hack is disturbing and disgusting. How about accountability? This to me, is so degrading to the innocent women who suffered. This is not a laughing matter or a punchline. Women were violated by a sick and perverted man but somehow Seth feels the need to falsely compare our president to this twisted man... For what purpose, to protect his own maybe? Absolutely disgusting, shame on you. When will you and your other late night counterparts stop and accept the fact that Hillary lost? It's a fact (thank God), grow up and move on. Try writing something original and stop with the nonsense, or don't and myself and millions of others will continue not watching and you will eventually fail in not only your career but most likely in life, generally speaking. Do decent, honest people actually find you pleasant as a person? It's hard to imagine they do. Seth, you stink! Try and do your job and be funny for a change. Maybe you're not qualified to be in your position? It seems to me you've run your course. Your shrinking audience is drowning in your fake activism... How many millions are you getting paid for your failing TV job, while distributing this hot air? You are so out of touch with the great American people. You forget that this great nation, that votes left or right, allows you to have your overpaid joke of a job. Sorry, your show is truly horrible. I personally don't know anyone that watches it. Remember, half of the country voted for Trump. You're not a very bright business man are you there kiddo... Boo!!
Except Weinstein has been connected with the Democrat Party for a long time. Also try to exclude Trump from everything okay? Not everything is Trump’s fault
I understand Seth does not like Donald Trump, but please be fair about this Weinstein scandal this time.  The event is so obvious to everyone that any attempt to use it against Donald Trump would look like a propaganda rather than a talk show.  I do not want my favorite talk show to become a total propaganda...
Wow. Seth you figured out how to still include Donald Trump. In the shaming of Weinstein how do you do it?
You scumbag trying to tie Trump to your GOD/Harvey Weinstein no wonder you late night P.C. Degenerates are knee deep in bodyguards it seems like Seth likes putting an X on his forehead!
Lets not forget the liberals beloved Bill got his dick sucked by women over the years.
liberal's, trump supporters, democrats, republicans, or not....\n\nall of you fucking fall into the shameless category.\n\nit's called amerifaggots. all of you are fucking jokes. you fucking, disgusting amerifaggots can't even thing for yourselves.....\n\nI cannot wait to leave amerifag. home of the fucking retards. have fun killing yourselves. you fucking amerifaggots.
Thank trump for giving you a job, irrelevant talk show host.
And he brings sex and race in it for no legitimate reason
Seth takes A Closer Look at the abuse of power to silence, bully or coerce.  Has The President used his power to silence, bully or coerce?
bottom line men run the earth and always will women are inferior period! not to mention gold diggers who cares what they want or say gold dig all day
The laughter is fake
Trump was promoting women in the 80's when no one else was! Don't lump Trump with Hollywood. As it turns out, our @potus and establishment/Hollywood are enemies for very good reasons. Don't fool yourselves: one talks, the other RAPES, and you leftists have raped America long enough! FU! #MAGA
Are these women retarded or something or do they only come out of the woodwork like cockroaches only when allegations surface or when possible profit is involved? It's like after Cosby and every other sexual assault allegation they still stay in hiding without realizing it only takes 1 to get them all going.
pathetic left propaganda, please remove this crap from my feed!
Stupid fuckin Jews trying to confuse people trump n raping Hollywood Ziont Jew Weinstein are the same, these Hollywood Jew fucks can all go to hell, #boycottzionists
Well, he did manage to get about 2.5 minutes of Weinstein bashing in there. It's a start I guess.  And flashing Hillary's picture up at the end, while saying you can't blame women for men's bad acts really is rich. Does this fuckign moron not remember that Hillary was the lead attack dog against Bill's victims? The only difference between Harvey and Bill is that Bill took part in this activity while POTUS in the oval office.
Anyone notice how the most entitled people are also the most incompetent and stupid?
Seeing people being fed up with this spoonfed journalism makes me feel better sometimes. Reminds me that there's still a good number of people (some are like me and aren't even Trump fans) who think and want to continue to think beyond the narratives of those who want to control thought. Orwell quotes get thrown around a lot lately, but they are definitely relevant.
if Trump is so terrible, then why do so many women defend him. plus they played a huge role, and got him in office. the ugly truth for the left, and there worst nightmare,,, is that Trump is doing an Amazing job as president.... democrats are jumping ship, and not just a few here and there. in mass numbers. some how that man comes out smelling like roses every time. he is showing Americans that we have a cult, that have taken over both sides of the gov. now, people are flocking to him. you watch....the other shoe will drop soon, and more Hollywood elites will be exposed. it will be the very actors that have had to bow and kiss the ring that will do it. once they fall, he can go after the mainstream.... Trump will be the Leader that brings these people that don't care about Americans Down.....you just watch....
I knew the paid trolls whose native language is not English & those who are American but barely literate would show up on this one😂
Trump like Weinstein?? Really? Seth you are not even slightly humorous anymore but become more and more distorted and almost come off as twisted you are so fucking butt-hurt. Try to get back you job on SNL
Funny thing is I bet Seth sexual assaulted and bullied his female coworkers.
Hillary Rotten Clinton and Huma Abedin received heaps of campaign money from Weinstein and they are BOTH married to sexual predators!
only a lowlife like seth would turn a predator like Harvey Weinstein, into an anti Trump rant. Good job in missing the point.
Let me guess Seth Meyers is a Jew.
Ok Harvey is a freak and these women that slept with Harvey should be arrested....These women are nothing but hookers...they slept with Harvey for monetary gain....so no I don't feel sorry for them.
Wasn't Weinstein a HUGE Killary/ Democratic supporter?!?!  Gives close to if not more money than the evil NRA in political donations?!?!?  Hasn't Killary disparaged rape victims after they came forward against her rapist husband?!
Any excuse to include Trump, this is just sad.
This POS is a joke
Seth Meyers is a asshole, wait, a asshole has a  purpose in life, not this jerk. WE LOVE OUR GREAT PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!! so shut UP dickhead
Hey -- You FORGOT PODESTA also.\nLOOK as Seth Meyers DISTRACTS You from the REAL ISSUE to Politicize Sex Abuse!! #SHAME   Listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPy7arsGAZs
No mention of Bill Clintons many many accusers of rape ?
You're a fucking hack, stick to comedy.
Trump is sexist because he said something about a woman's vagina a decade ago, to a man.  Something I'm sure pure Seth would never ever do.  Seth is on a lewd, crude sexually-charged TV show for years that supports sexism and all kinds of other garbage, but he's a fine gent.  HYPOCRITES.  Equating Trump's critique of PR leadership who happens to female, isn't sexism.  You might disagree with him, but just because it's a woman doesn't make it sexism... SMH.  You have poor reasoning skills.
Frankly, HIllary Clinton should shut about about this, because she has no leg to stand on.  She isn't responsible for the acts of the slimy, sexual predator who is her husband, but she is responsible for enabling him and trash-talking the women he used.  I don't want to hear her blather about sexual predators like I don't want to hear Melania Trump blather about bullying -- they both have a house to clean before preaching to others.\n\nFurthermore, this is a great chance to impress on the Democrats once again how much crap Big Money is in politics -- it gets you slimed by association when a big donor is shown to be an equally big arsehole. Get that money out of politics, and at least you only have to deal with the jackasses who're elected officials in your party.
CONGRATULATIONS SETH FOR CALLING IT AS IT IS!!
Hillary and Bill just kill them . Trump 100 times better than any democrat
We've stayed silent until now. We feared. We were threatened. We needed to rebuild our lives. But we can no longer sit back and let the monsters sexually assaulted women and raped girls roam free. Please check out Kate del Castillo movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOX3tjTVgQc
Your so full of propaganda you can't even report on something that puts you leftys in a bad light without trying to pull in Donald to DISTORT the whole WEINSTEIN fiasco. EVERYGUY ALIVE has talked about PU$$Y to his friends, MOST OF US MILLIONS OF TIMES. TWO FACED he/she OBAMA said DONALD IS SEXIST AND MADE HIM OUT TO BE SLIMY BECAUSE HE MADE A COMMENT ABOUT GRABBING PU$$Y which is LIGHT for what we guys usually have to say about it. So where am I going with this well he /she obama had rappers around her and her gay husband constantly. Gay hussein said over and over he had j-z on speed dial. HELLO!!!! j-z only talks about pu$$y and hoes and all that crap. But when a political opponent says something nowhere near what the people this two faced he/she hangs around then suddenly that he/she is indignant, WHAT A FKING JOKE!  This liberal show is trying to equate a man who has had every girl who said something derogatory proved a LIAR and most have admireing stories about there meeting Donald. My point is you twist the fact liberal shows cannot report on YOUR man being a fking PREDATOR you gotta try to slough it off by putting our hero president you keep bashing beside him. TV IS FOR DUMMIES. Its for people who got a light grasp on reality.  The reason this talk show host can act like he does not KNOW that ALL guys talk about pu$$y is because look at him he's a pole smoker 100% Because if he wasn't QUEER I'd have to call him a liar.
Fake news!! And fake likes read the comments
Harvey Weinstein On Why He's Supporting Hillary Clinton.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hrGEd7CUxO0
Seth, the problem is you are a big part of that 'system'. We are not.
If you’re talking about silencing women, preserving the viability of a serial sexual predator, Hillary Clinton is the GOAT! She is the Greatest of All Time. Hillary Clinton has led the most successful War on Women ever — and, in the process, she saved her husband’s name, his career, his presidency, and the Democrat Party! Tell me how Harvey could do any better. You think Harvey Weinstein was a bully? You ain’t seen nothing yet ’til you hire Hillary!
Can someone please tell Seth that when he's reading jokes that other people wrote, not to make it look so obvious. Now I know why people that come to see him live, don't have to pay to get in. Who would pay to see this Moron squinting.
Late night comedy use to be funny when David Letterman was the man.
And syphilis meyers is the poster child for systemic libatarism and moronicism brain dead stupidity.  The only reason he can still talk is because the free flow of diarrhea out of all of his orifices makes it possible to still breath.  Too bad...
Third way femenists are cancer and the fact that the news are sinking to their level is pathetic get triggered and grow some brain cells
This guy needs to watch Dr Shaym.
Talking about obama was racist so I guess it's anti white now against trump
I love how enlightened liberals keep calling us people of color. What a bunch of racists.
Bill Clinton, multiple rape charges and sexual harassment. Now people are outraged but then they simply attacked the women. Bill sent people to follow their kids and harassed them. How many people helped Weinstein, how many knew and helped him keep it quiet. 
HollyWEIRD is so annoying
Goth Trump :-)
@9:08 powerful
Seth on fire 🔥🔥🔥👌🏽
What about Bill Clinton????
Stay woke America
HIDE YER WIMMIN!  THE PATRIARCHY IS COMING!!!!!
7k dislikes? Really guys? Trumptards are seriously triggered. Pathetic little boys.
Trump tripped on the steps.

What about bill Clinton
Thank you Seth.  Very insightful and empowering.
B O R I N G  . . . .  zzzz
Trump 2020
6:00 it's cryonically, not cryogenically.
#FAKENEWS
This video is actually sexist towards males. I'm a male victim of sexual harassment, and I know this topic doesn't get much coverage but... It's really hard to speak out. Males are also abused and victimized. You're simply ignorant if you don't agree.\n\nSo, Seth, let's not be sexist towards an entire group of people that comprises half of the world's population. It's incredibly insensitive, and I wouldn't be surprised if YouTube demonetized your videos for this. You sick individual.
Seth Meyers is such an unbelievable loser he is suffering for the next eight years if Trump wasn't president he would have no show he is not talented not funny a miserable excuse of a man a freaking pipsqueak a shitstain in the world of life he has literally zero Talent he should be an accountant or something !  Low life !
Is this modern America now? Regressive left brainwashing with a new wave feminism and race obsessed tinge in the mainstream?\n\nAbsolute shithole of a country.
I saw a pic of Hillary touching Weinstein's chest with tenderness. Bill Clinton also took off his pants in front of many young girls.
Bill Clinton is a rapist
Can't believe I have to say this, but you should be able to be alone with a woman and not sexually assault her.\nCareful, folks, that's a bar so low you might trip on it.\nSeth absolutely killed it on this one.
This proves yet again how utterly crazy liberals are. DONALD TRUMP isn't a rapist. Harvey Weinstein and Bill Clinton ARE. And yet they are still bashing Trump like he's on the same level as these disgusting, perverted pigs. Pathetic.
Fake news Alert: Liberal attempt to link President Trump to a creepy dude like Weinstein. Liberals just refuse to hold themselves accountable without bringing President Trump into the mix..So pathetic.
1. This whole thing has no connection to Donald Trump\n\n2. Sexual assault in Hollywood isnt sexism or gendered as there's plenty of male victims, Terry Crews, Elijah Wood, Corey Feldmen, Corey Haim and others
Lets not forget when bill Clinton got his dick sucked in the white house then attempted to lie about it. Hollywood can all go burn in hell along with the rest of these old relic politicians
You had to couple this story with Trump to spin your narrative, didn't you? Weinstein is a serial rapist. For once man, tell the people the truth instead of saying Trump this Trump that.
Nothing about Bill and Hillary...Seth is a loser.
For the love of God ,lay off Trump already.He is our president.you fucking  sore losers.
Weak and obvious attempt to link Weinstein to Trump.  Nobody buys this political crap on a supposed late night comedy show - Seth Myers sold his soul for dumb Trump jokes.  You got ripped off (again) by your handlers Seth.  Might as well change that Christian name to Goat Boy, Satan, Beelzebub, or the like
Donald Trump est un cochon sans cervelle qui s'est faufilé dans le bureau. Lui et tout son entourage doivent être expulsés. Et il pense qu'il va avoir un deuxième mandat. Ha!
Boycott late night shows
nauseating leftist dogma
Make america orange again .
They just had to throw Trump in there to make libs feel better
Barff - Jews are the worst.
after reading the comments from the right wingers on this forum, it is apparent why there are no conservative late night comedy shows.  they lack a sense of humor.
you look behind the catchphrases and there's nothing there. spot on.
2000 views, clearly trending.
Peston never used to act like that, Where's he got this exaggerated persona from, he seems to have flanderized himself.
Trying to kick the can down the road.   Still face stark future post brexit.
Strange because Keir Starmer said on BBC's Daily Politics that if The Government chose to leave without a deal, The Labour Party would vote to keep us in The EU. The talks should have been trade based instead of firstly focusing on Citizens Rights, The ECJ and Divorce Bills. I, like many others, voted to leave and if this is stopped for any reason, then democracy is dead.
That was fascinating. Find it a real relief to listen to someone who has their head screwed on about this.
All political parties continue to sell the message that there are only 2 options,\n1. Get a good deal. \n2. Leave without a deal. \nBut there is clearly a third option, \n3. To stop Brexit now and then negotiate with the EU from inside the EU club backed by a strong leave mandate. \n\nThe precipitous lodging by the May government of the Article 40 notice was clearly aimed at solving internal party problems with no real consideration given to the interests of the UK or the EU.\nAt the same time the opposition parties allowed the Article 40 notice to proceed without a great deal of opposition or question for fear of losing support from Leave or Remain voters. \n\nThis was and is the state of the political process in our parliament, which has lead a government with no clear mandate to enter UK/EU negotiations in an unplanned, uncoordinated and unduly optimistic fashion. \n\nThe present state of the negotiation is now generally accepted to be unlikely to result in a beneficial outcome for anyone. At the same time our parliament is more divided than ever and the political parties continue to follow a path which could lead to the breakup of the UK and the destruction of our democracy.\n\nWe (the voters) need to save our country from our political parties and our political parties from themselves.\n\nTo this end we ask our Members of Parliament to put aside party loyalties and Pledge to serve all our people in a Unified Cross/Party National Government mandated to stop Brexit now.\nhttp://www.fvvra.org/the-fvvra-pledge\n\nGordon Middleton\nFVVRA.ORG
Nowhere in Article 50 does it say 'With a view to a future agreement'!
Establishment traitor.
Omg I was so scared I thought Byron was going at the start😅😂😂😂
Im with joe! Grey and mint all the way😂
People are just stupid. If people could tell the difference between real and fake they would see the photo has been edited.
Joe had his capo on upside down on his guitar
It's mint and grey! looks nothing like pink and white.
That mask is horrific omg haha 😂😂😂 All I can see is mint green and grey!
It's gray and mint. No matter how hard I try I just can not see pink and white...
It’s grey and blue
Wait isn't color spelled without a U?
I can switch mine from pink and white to grey and blue
It looked blue to me the other day but now I see pink
It's pink and white
YESS JOE MINT AND GREY ALL THE WAYYY😂😂
If you shine a torch in your eye you’ll see pink and whit if you see grey and mint (well now I can’t see)
*I see the shoe as black.* WTF????
What the heck is Alfie doing to his hair?!?! 7:50
This vlog was so random but I loved every second of it!!!!!!!!!
With the dress I saw white and gold and with the shoe I see blue/mint and grey
They are pink and white vans
I see grey and mint
i legit saw the dress as white and gold and the shoe as pink and white
one of your best vlogs
I think that the shoes are grey and mint
Halloweens on the 31st and this was posted on the 13th of October and  you said halloween is for another 3 days 😕 sorry for correcting you
Your face makes suicide look like the best option.
Grey and mint

I guess u have eyes problems
He's a ballchinian
I'm a simple man\nWhen I see a red arrow on the thumbnail\nI click\nI dislike \nI leave
It's pink and white
Why is this video trending?
I saw the dress white and gold  and  shoe mint and grey
It's pink and white
I TESTED IT AND IT'S GREEN
It's not a shoe. It's a trainer
Every time I look at it I see pink and white at first and then it turns grey and teal after looking at it for a while 😂
Blue and grey but the other pink and white
Type in 'P' if you think it's pink and white  💖☁️\nLike it if  you think it's blue and grey 💙🔩
This one fucked me up! I've seen both pink and white and blue and grey!
That pink and white shoe is not the original picture at all. The original picture and the shoe is actually grey and mint green. I had to call her out on her ballshit
i literally see white and mint
4 seconds in and ive already spat my coffee all over the screen
ALFIE SEES THE SANE COLOURS AS ME
i see both versions of the shoe
ıŋ ɬɧąɬ weird dress, do you see white and gold or black and blue? \n\n\nps: i always see white and golf
I can't see both
BTW The real van is pink and white, but because of the filter, it looks mint and grey like what I see! If you zoom in on the hand holding it, it has a bluey-green undertone (which isn't normal unless you're a frickin' alien)
I have noticed that only boys have said it is grey and mint and girls think it is pink and white
Nope I only see pink and white
JOE If Ur trying to grow a Venus fly trap u should know that they thrive in dry soil and can only live in dry soil (hence the reason they kill bugs-for it's water/juices) and adding water will ensure it dies
Okay when I saw the shoe on the thumbnail the other day it was white and green and now I see it and it’s pink and white
Its both combinations! (Grey and mint green and then pink and white)
I see pink and white
More importantly, is it color or colour
To me now it’s pink and mint
it's pink and white
I see mint and grey
the countdown music started playing, and i immediately opened my other tabs to see if i had left an '8out of 10 cats does countdown' on, and then realized after checking all 40 tabs, that it was part of the video.
AGHH I LOOKED AT THE THUMBNAIL ONCE: PINK AND WHITE. WATCHED THE VIDEO AGAIN AND LOOKED BACK AT THE THUMBNAIL: MINT AND GREY!! ??!!?!
Joe is right, its mint and grey
The shoes are black and gold what's wrong with everyone
Wow joe is great at the guitar!!!!
They make the lighting dark so then it looks like it is mint and white I think it looks mint and white but the actual picture is pink and white
If you see it as grey and turquoise/mint, and you want to see it as pink and white, screenshot the photo of the shoes on iPhone, download 'photo editor -' (the one with black background icon), go into the app, click on the photo, click adjust, click contrast, set it at -100. Try to see the photo as pink and white. Now gradually pull the contrast up to 0 and see if it is still pink and white.
its mint and grey
Joe plz do covers of songs from Ed Sheeran or whoever cuz u r really good at playing the piano and singing or do a duet with zoe. U playing a guitar and u both singing plz x

When I last went to Brighton early sept and was so windy along the beach I had wind swept hair. Also went to the pier I see u did so much better at the arcades than me as when I went only won 4 tickets but no prizes and as didn't spend long enough or have enough coins that could use in arcades I didn't win any prizes but now I'm saving all my pennies from 1p to 50p to have a big bag for when I next go back to Brighton hopefully next year now in about April time

DONT WORRY AYESHA, THATS NORMAL COMPARED TO TAMERA GIVING RASPBERRIES TO ADAM'S STOMACH
Idris for Loni. Common for Jeannie and now Ayesha for Tamera. All their crushes.
You've got a fetish for my feet, I push you out and you come right back.
He's going to kill me.... yes he is girl!! 🤣🤣🤣 do you know how bad the NBA & his teammates are going to make fun of him!? Lmaoooooo damnnn...no championship this year 💀
Ain't nothing wrong with a little foot fetish lmao
Loni all in her damn phone I know she was thinking back up bitch!
Makes me sad for my horrible looking feet
IDRIS ELBA HAS OPENED UP THE FLOOD GATES
I really don't get the foot thing.
Attention the real, keep Ayesha pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
she need to be part of the team
I love feet and Ayesha's a pretty girl but her feet r okay. She fucked up because now steph gone get hella Dms of IG girls feet. He won't be able to contain himself
Real niggas suck on toes
He gone get clowned in the locker room now..well done. You set your own husband up lol
Idris Elba out here making foot fetish okay 😩😩😩
I relate to him but, why she let them bait her lol
I have feet fetish as well. Girls with bad feet is a major turn off for me.
Thats really cute🙃
Y'ALL NEED TO KEEP AYESHA ON THE PANELLLLL
Welcome to the club Steph 😁
The ladies look stunning loving Loni's makeup and hair!!!!! Tamera all season has been slaying.
Send feet baby
Idris literally just said last week that feet gets him too!!!
KEEP AYESHA!! ADD her to the Cast!!
When you ask for nudes but she ain't even like you
Shows me that Curry is a faithful dude. Instead of looking for thots while on the road he asks his wife for nudes/feet pics.
There is no heterosexual explanation for this
Men who are turned on by feet are weird to me.
I fw Steph lightskin girls always got pretty feet and white girl
Women in their natural habitat. Cluck cluck clucking
I don't see what the problem is I mean they are married, and I love feet as well.
I bet Currys DM's full of feet. LMAO
I have foot fetish also
stephen should have killed ayesha by now
Lowkey not even a fetish, pretty feet be lookin raw as hell lmao
The ONLY way I'll watch the real again, after the shameful way they treated Tamar, is to bring her back. I'll also settle for Ayesha Curry cuz Tamar is booked!
I like that though very unusual but kind of cute too.
Eww.
Lmao Steph is a toe sucker. still I'd suck Ayesha's toes
Poor Curry put on blast lmao.
So Steph Curry has a foot fetish?  Maybe he likes to suck toes
He's going to kill her 😂😂😂

Black Fat bitches!!!!
Fucking normies infest everything and now they are heading for the fetishes 🙄
Y'all seen that video of a light skin sucking on that one girls feet? Must be lightskin thing to be into feet
Yeah that's nasty
bisbing is a brittish cunt i hope george does to bisbing what he did to koshcheck in there second fight.
Haha GSP having none of Bisping's fake shit tough guy act. Nailed it. No one's buying ur bs Michael The ducker Bisping.
I guess the kid at the end wasn't interested in a photo with GSP anymore! Lol!
Reminds me of that time Wanderlei went there with a camera to talk with Chael Sonnen
Bisping is pissed because GSP knocked the wind out of him with that sharp push to the gut (he admitted it on his podcast) and he felt GSP's strength.
Bisping is a fucking joke, worst champion in UFC history, talking shit to GSP... hope that one eyed fucker gets his face kicked in.
Love the new GSP........imbecile Brit has no chance against the GOAT
Bisping trying to be relevant even though he hasnt done a fkn thing in the ufc in his 13 year career besides win the belt 1nce then talk about retirement lol what a fkn loser
This shit is stupid! I'm a huge GSP fan and I'm pissed he's even coming back to fight Cyclops bisping....should have sailed off into the sunset with his millions and transitioned to action movies...no need to come back GSP has nothing to prove and this fake drama shit is so beneath him...i don't even want to see this fight
Old news, old pillow hands was always a cunt, but his moment has come. So he's enjoying it like he would. Either way it's almost over. If he does get by GSP i foresee whittaker retiring him, otherwise his next fight would be against yoel or jacare lol which would also retire him
Shut up Bisping!!! Enjoy the belt, you got a little less than 3 weeks with it!!
They're selling the fight.
These two assholes had a phone conversation all polite talking about how bad they want to fight each other
Bisping KO'd one guy and thinks he's a wrecking machine..
Bisping is such a fucking asshole, the less deserving champion. Ran with the belt after he won that pussy
Kid: i want to take a picture\nGSP: FUCK OFF KID! You think i am scared of you? Are you crazy in the head man?
Bisping said he wanted to finger the lizard tongue of GPS.. yes.. I said GPS, and lizard tongue
Bitchpig is a low life
Has Bisping taken too many blows to the head? He seems like he doesn't know what's going on. He's instigating, and then acting like he's not doing anything. Something is seriously wrong.
I don't think bisping has the slightest idea what's about to happen to him
Fuck gsp. I can't stand that fucking stupid mf Canadian jackass. He should've stayed retired . I hope bisping knocks his fucking ass out. Fuck Georgina st. Pierre
ROFLMAO Bisping said in an interview George is scared, he tried starting shit because he was intimidated, then this vid comes out showing Mike starting shit X'D
Come on Bisping. This is a sport. Where are your manners. Respect the pioneers of the game. Fighters these day, ain't got manners.
Bisping is trying so freakin hard to sell this 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ but the real fight was supposed to b against Romero
Love GSP haha the way he said fuck off and whys bisping telling him to not act like a tough guy? He approached him and started mouthing off.
GSP is going to make Bisping look so stupid.
It's staged to promote the fight
Hahahaha littleping is such an instigating bitch. George is right, he didn't touch littleping. Littleping is touching first and wants to talk shit
Bisping tells GSP don't act tough.  Then tries to act tough everywhere he goes.
I will break you - GSP
You lot are idiots man smh, bisping is only doing this market the fight and create some hatred and drama in order to boost ppv sales
Why isn't this pussy fighting Whiticker like a real champion? Did he get injured? What's going on with these joke fights. Watch gsp will probably just out wrestle this fucking idiot then give Whitaker a real fight.
Finally something real to get the fight hyped..the pressers were dull!/ I actually felt some real heat there. We might get a good fight after all.
Fuck off man. Love it. Classic Canadian. Go GSP! Bisping is getting dusted.
not good an angry GSP is a scary thing.....all the fights where he felt personally insulted he ran through the opponent!
Hype for the fight, don't be fooled.
Bisping you better ko him now talking all this shit  if not your a piece of shit cunt
Bisping, shut the fuck up you pussy. You’re the instigator and GSP won’t welcome you. You’re already done.
Lol look at all you mongs crying. Bisping is simply trying to sell the fight by making it look personal. He knows he touched gsp first and we know it but he's trying to bring out that fire in gsp to help promote the fight you fools
Wow I've never heard George's that pissed, dropping f bombs and scaring little kids!!  I've been waiting 10+ years for the pissed off I don't give a fuck GSP to fight again! Keep poking the bear Bisping cause sooner or later GSP's gonna rip your head off!! LOVE IT AND CANT WAIT!!!!!
is bisping dumb, he's touch gsp first on two different occasions
I would just like to point out the little kid that ran away in the end of this video. This a great example of why this kind of behavior displayed is bad for the sport... that is if this indeed is a sport
Fuck it George St. Pierre acted like this all the time I would be his fucking fan come on George be yourself stop trying to be the nice guy fuck off Bisping
Fuck Bisping he is talking to the 🐐
GSP should continually jab BIsping in his fucked up left eye, just as he did to Josh Koscheck ... that would be dirty but could trigger a TKO stoppage
Haven't we all learned this is for show and to make us buy the fights. They do all this shit talking and getting in each other's face then after the fight they hug and talk.
Why the fuck does people try to separate them!  I would be pushing there ass in to each other!
theres the George we wanna see!!!!
Its called Fight Marketing. Calm down people.
gsp is awesome lol trys to show the little boy its all good ..kid runs off what a hero one day that kid will knw who thay was and be inspired
Bisping is a F*cking Ash*le and bully  etc... Hope George gonna smash this bad Englishman
This English fucktard grabs someone and gets all emotional when he gets pushed back, like were you expecting him to give you a hug?
You already know they gonna kiss each other after the fight...now they just try to promoting and make people think they hate each other.
Better than the press conference. Yea....fukk u mannn
We finally got to hear GSP say Fuck!!...It was everything I hoped it would be!...Lmfao
GSP is extremely dsngerous. He is like McGregor but quiet and stealth. The 1 Huge advantage GSP has over Bis. Is brains. Bis doesnt have the vision like GSP. 1 wrong move and your either tapping out or knocked out.
Lay and pray for five rounds....and the new!
I hope GSP punches a hole in Bispings head..... but I am not confident he will..... GSP has been out of the game a long time..... He should have had a tune up fight to shake off the ring rust if you ask me, but GSP is stubborn so it is what it is..... Bisping has his hands full though, regardless.... I see this fight definitely going to a decision in favor of Bisping... but ONLY because GSP is a dinosaur..... Bisping is not a model champion by any means.... He has too many wins that were only wins because of poor judging in favor of a hometown favorite, etc.  rather than an actual win. He also has never really beaten a relative contender, aside from Rockhold, in my opinion..... (Anderson Silva and Dan Henderson do not count.... He lost to a 90 year old Anderson Silva and Hendo was 147 when they fought the second time)...... The guy didn't even beat a 100 year old Wanderlei for Christ sake..... Prime GPS would KILL prime Bisping on any given day..... but I fear GSP's age and ring rust will catch up with him on fight night and Bisping may prevail by decision...... Bisping (sorry UK fans) is the weakest champ in UFC history and has never beaten anyone who matters. He's also the most arrogant ever in UFC history with no fight resume to back it up.
Gsp got him with the dolph lungren line. I'll will break you man!!!
keep your hands to yourself? what are we in the fucking 1st grade or some shit
Touch me, I touch you man
I like this GSP. This video is entertaining af.
Does Bisping know it's GSP he's fighting?  Unlike McGregor's fights, trash talking isn't required to sell out the building and get at least 2 million PPV's.  Thats why the real ratings King is GSP who has always been called a boring interview and, to the uneducated MMA fan, a boring fight.  All the records Conor is breaking, according to his dad Dana, were originally set by GSP and Canada has always been the strongest UFC supporter and they are 100% behind GSP.  The numbers will be high based just on Canada alone which has a much higher population than Ireland so bring it on Conor fans, the King will reclaim his crown and Conor wont be saying a fooking ting about it.  If he does than thats when his daddy digs his career hole and signs a fight with GSP LMAO, than that fight dodging bitch gets berried once and for all.  GSP isn't Munchkin Aldo or The Pretender Alvarez and Conor sure as fuck isn't Nick Diaz or Jake Shields or practically anyone GSP ever fought.
I don't think Bisping realizes how crazy French Canadians are!
Yep. GSP is going to unleash his dark side upon Bisping
Conor disrespects everyone and y'all excuse is ''It's funny and he's selling a fight'' so shut the fuck up
GPS looked sad at the end when the kid ran away lol
Well that was amazing shit talk( sarcasm )don't touch me man I will break you  .. no you better not touch me man I will fuck you up I will break your jaw ... I'm not scared of you i will fuck you up  better not touch me ... wtf is this 5th grade I was waiting for the whole I'm not TOUCHING you to start. This is the shittiest way to hype a fight we get it you want to fight and there's no real anger behind it. Gsp smiles the whole time practically and it sounded like a brothers argument on which seat is his. This is why gsp isn't a big draw imo, that and the whole cheating thing with the Vaseline
Bisping want to be liked so bad by playing to be the alpha male like McGregor....but the difference is that McGregor IS the alpha male....amd bisping is not it doesn't matter how hard he tries....cant wait to see him loose!
Bisping is trying too hard to be McGregor.
that is why everyone hates michael bisping.
How does Bisping have the gall to tell a guy not to touch him when it is a direct response to Bisping putting his hand on GSP.  Is Bisping getting dementia from the head shots he has taken over the years.
Bad acting...
Busting is scared man!!
 Fuck off man  .... brilliant
Promo shit that's all.
bisping is a fuckin clown
Fawk awwf maan
Fuck you george-nick diaz
Fake ass shit. Wolf tickets.
Can't wait till gsp fucks him up!
Man Bisping is a fucking retard
not even diaz got gsp to swear
Selling the fight
Bisping felt GSP's ape strength and got scared.
Love GSP
Bisping is an asshole I hope gsp wins
Bisping scared AF
Bisping is shook
GSP is pissed
Bisping is a bully.
FUCKING LOVE HYDRATED GSP
Bisping is a nerd
Did I just hear GSP swear?  uh oh...
Bisbing totally lost his edge there hahaha
This was awesome lol
Control yourself you little fuckaaaiiin puusssaayyy
Bisping is such a whiney little Bitch
Fuck you Georges
Bisping ya genre 3 fans en angleterre, y va faire le sault quand y va entendre les québecois chanter durant le combat
To clarify, just because you can find an image on Google doesn't mean it's legal. This law is very loosly enforced but still is a law.
trump wall will also have copy right ,.........ya .straight from china
Uhh there are a lot lol...
Man I'm desperate just click it and I'll love you https://discord.gg/8V8bczA
And yet every android and ios app takes pictures of me and access my whole photo gallery without paying me a penny :(
This has to be the biggest load of BS I've heard in a long time.
The movie Monte Carlo has a scene of the Eiffel Tower at night
Right then how about vid
china made a replica of effiel tower why doesnt france sue china
So if someones work is copyrighted and the person died a while ago you can become rich by putting some lights around? I need to get lots of christmas lights this year...
That is so dumb
fuck france and fuck the EU , rule brittania
These are the kind of channels I love! Only a few videos and you're already climbing to the top, good job man. Make sure your channel stays the same with this interesting stuff
Best square space promotion so far
Next video:\nWhy taking pictures of the sun at night is illegal.
Rush Hour 3 mustve cost a shit load of cash then
cleveland steamer is far more specific than the listings I have seen here. A sexual act by nature (fetish) the cleveland steamer is when one person craps on another person's chest and (very important) then sits down and rocks back and forth like a steam roller
Copyright laws are really the only setback to the real progress, if we don't include the primitive system itself
My name is artistic creation too! Don’t use my name.
How if a thousand people taking video of eiffel tower at the same night?
THAT'S WHY THE DOLAN TWINS DELETED THE 4OU VIDEO
What an absolute load of fucking bollocks, and this is trending? Fuck me a large part of my brain just shut down watching this cus it wasn’t needed
liked the video just for the ad transition
Fuckign frenchs.... already fucked us with communism, smelly women and now this.
Extremely clickbait title.\nPhotos are not ILLEGAL, sharing night pictures are copyrighted. Wich is not the same AT ALL as illegal. It just means they can charge you for it or take it down otherwise
But you said it...like many times😐
What's good about a rusty tower anyway
😂😂😂 what a joke man why
Meanwhile China has already built a replica of the Eiffel Tower as a big fuck you to Western copyright laws. They also built a replica of London's Tower Bridge and made it twice the size with four turrets instead of London's two.
Hey at least I can take a photo of the Las Vegas Eiffle tower at night!
After the copyright of the lights is expired, they will get the bird poop on the tower copyrighted.
Don't let Reddit find out, they took the Shia Leboeouf shit to another level of amazing.
This has to be the Most retarded law I've ever heard of
what if someone posted a photo of it on instagram?
Wtf ? This is all about nonsense sh*t
Lol I'll just Google it smh
Nobody out in the general public is expected to know this shit, so who the fuck cares lol. You can probably just argue that you weren't given a little-known-things-that-are-illegal-but-noone-gives-a-shit-about class on court tbh
*Googles Eiffel Tower* *First image is at night* 10/10 law
I saw a video of the Eiffel tower with its lights on at night on a news. The news is about turning off the light of Eiffel Tower after a terrorist attack in France so,  I saw it for about 1 second on television before it turn off it's light.
So does that mean on the game 007 nightfire during the first mission when they show a replication of the Eiffel Tower at night, was that illegal?
If You look up Eiffel Tower At Night you won't be disappointed
I bet more than half off the people searched, Eiffel tower at night
The devil wears Prada. Eiffel Tower at night. Eat a dick.
I am a badass and I broke this law in Paris 😎
Squarespace sucks, I would not use them. They will shut you down for no reason after you've invested tons of time building your site.
Literally found a shit ton of night time Eiffel Tower pictures
Wait wait wait what about the movie smurfs 2 had a night Video of the Eiffel Tower???
going to jail? first of all they have to prove you used the photos for some kind of gain (monetary, advertisement...etc) then they have to prove that you did it whilst knowing the act is illegal. stop spouting nonsense if ur not a lawyer.
You can take a photo as long as it's not commercial You might got to jail for your holiday photo oh jeez
You managed to repeat It's the greatest spreadsheet in the world. multiple times. \n\nBut yet you didn't even manage to supply us more curious folks a link to the spreadsheet. I get it we can just go to their website and find it. But what the hell come on man, you were there and everything. You literally had to highlight, Ctrl C, and then Ctrl V into the damn video description. \n\nGreat video, but come on when ppl don't give the proper links to back up what there talking about in the video. It makes you look like your lying, and it makes our life's harder. Because we than have to go and find the damn page.\n\nAnd then figure out if you lied or if your telling the truth. Next time just put the damn link in the description. \n\nSo I won't have to keep copy and pasting this damn paragraph over and over.
Did anyone right as they saw the video immediately check Google for Eiffel Tower at night
It's quite literally the dumbest thing I ever heard. The building has lights so we can't take a picture of it? the fuck?
I don't think a bunch of lights should be copyrighted
French are full of baguette! Fuck that tower
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. (not your video, the copyright laws)
If a copyright is not enforced they can lose it in court if they try to sue anyone, because they didn't sue everyone
Is my face copyright?
lol the fukin lights are copyrighted, what a joke
The long animator comment. I've seen that before. Tabbes video? Is the animator Tabbes, or do they watch Tabbes?
Okay so I get how it's illegal to share in France (dumb as that is), but French law doesn't apply in the rest of the world. If you can film it for personal use there, then leave the country and share it with others who also aren't in France, then I would only assume (and hope for sanity's sake) that French law can't touch you.
Very informative. Copyright law is so extensive. Rightly so. I appreciate this explanation!
I'm sorry just because it's illegal for you to take pictures of the Eiffel tower at night. Doesn't mean it makes since. It actually makes no fucking since at all.... This is y pots illegal and niggers have the same rights as a white man
What about movies is that legal like even if its just animated like Ratatouille is it legal since its animated?
Your honor, I just took a picture. His building was standing on my way.
Who else looked up a picture of an Eiffel Tower at night.
I wonder why everyone hated French
Copyright should end the second a person dies.
This vid was on my birthday
I get it but don’t get it at the same time
Your not talking about eiffel tower! What kind of title is that?
Wait...i think i took its pic at night
just google eiffel tower at night....
Wait I still have a question. So I can go to France and take a picture of it but can’t post it to my Instagram page and share it to my 13 followers? Or I can do that?
Full of bullshit in France
You can’t take pics of the Eiffel Tower at night\nMe: Hold my croissant.
never heard of that, but great video!
If you showed us without blurring, how will the architects or owners know?
Stupid Europeans, no wonder that continent has gone to shit. What scares me most is that now they are migrating to America and bringing their stupid liberal values with them.
Lol just typed in e on google and Eiffel Tower at night was the top result
Why go to Paris? It smells of tobacco and sweat.
He has to blur out bits of a picture in order to comply with French laws...while living in the United States.\n\nMakes sense.
This is stupid. Copyright laws should exist, but most people take it to a ridiculous extreme. 
Probs should change my pic then...
Sigh. People are stupid.
Muhahahahah Muhahahahahah MUHAHAHAHA
Maybe real but nonsense!
He's joking you dummies.
Soooooo dummmmmb
Oops
Bs
Stupid laws
Fuck
Pussy
lol hold my beer #america
Stupid
This Mudafakar just advertised the Squarespace😑😑😑
Fake news
Fuck france.
Thats fuckin gay
France laws are going overboard

I visited my grandpa today and had to think about your honest and deep thoughts about old people and how they're feeling lonely and have nobody to talk to. \nI love helping other people and i hope to find a way to get involved here in Germany. \nI love how you always say what is on your mind, wether it's funny or sad, positive or negative. \nI find that very inspiring!

Alife to stop spiders coming in to your house you can either cut up lemon and put them by your window or get some peppermint oil and mix it with water and spray it around your windows and door by the way spiders tend to hide in the corner of rooms because they are the warmest

bruno mars the best performance 1:15:57 live puerto rico
Thanks U... Jlo, Arod, Ricky Martin, Marc and all alls thaT MAKE POSSIBBLE THIS EVENTS.. Good Bless
There are so many rumors of government officials withholding donated supplies. I HOPE the FBI is looking into these allegations.  We need General Buchanan to take over the distribution of these supplies and monetary funds and make sure it finds its way to where it is supposed to go. 👍🏻🙏🏼🇺🇸🇵🇷🇺🇸💐🇺🇸
VIVA PUERTO RICO! 🇵🇷🇵🇷 \nWe WILL get through this stronger than ever.
Arriba Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 🇵🇷  de está nos levantaremos vamos arriba y no apaguemos esa luz tan hermosa que tenemos todos los boricuas vamo’ arriba

JLo nailed it!
FREEDOM FOR PUERTO RICO NOW
Gwen Stefani looks 30, she doesn't age!
Dj khalid is only screeming 😣 I hear nothing no music....
It is so amazing to see everyone united and helping PR. I'm from Puerto Rico and It is not easy what where going trough. Thanks for donating.
Beautiful show💖 Puerto Rico, you are loved!! Prayers to everyone that was affected 🙏 god bless u all.
Bruno sounds good in any language but that's no surprise.
DJ khaled was really turnt up and loved his hype and performance 😍😍☝
😢❤❤❤ This was so BEAUTIFUL & POWERFUL. Love you all...
Where is everyone singing to big puns song....
I watched it on NBC last night and made a donation. Reminded a few friends to watch and they did in turn made donations as well.  This is a reminder to all latin people that we have to be united if we want respect from politicians and to make sure that our voice is heard in Congress and in the White House.
Wonder how I can get a cd/dvd
Man i love Bad Bunny so much
Bruno mars speaking Spanish was Everything he sounded sexy tbh!
Bruno Mars tho!!blew me away with that español te quero much mi Bruno Bello😘😍
what song is at 2:07:00
I had been living in here for 30 yrs and I haven’t seen this before. This was amazing I’m very proud of all of you. My heart was pounding of joy. Congratulations and thank you for all your efforts to help our island PR, Mexico, US Virgin Islands and other parts of the states. Goose bumps and proud to be Boricua!!! In special Marc, JLo and Alex thanks for join forces in this event!!! Also, all the American artists that came to help in this cause thanks for the bottom of our hearts!!!
Proud to be latina... Marc Anthony killed it .. .in his final song..
Hearing the start of Mi Gente and how the people scream as it starts gave me chills.
GOD BLESS PUERTO RICO. THANKS TO THE ARTISTS CORPORATIONS AND JUST REGULAR FOLKS WHO ARE HELPING. SUCH SHOW OF LOVE IS OVERWHELMING. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. SAME GOES FOR ALL THE PEOPLE SUFFERING THE DEVASTATION OF THESE HURRICANES AND FIRES. BEEN THERE AND KNOW HOW DEVASTATING IT IS TO LOSE ALL. STAY STRONG. LOVE!
Thanks to all who will and have donated to this great cause. We are strong and will go on! Te Amo Puerto Rico para siempre! God Bless to all xoxo
This is an incredible event for the world to love and care about the future of people
fucking jlo showing that ass like a puta and after talking about dead people dying lol 😂
Why didnt they did this for Mexico ? You all bunch of hypocrites!
I love u Puerto Rico ❤
Bruno mars my respect singing that version for your island
WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS EVENT?  IT WAS FOR PUERTO RICO, WTF????
AMAZING 💚💚💚💚💚 JOB WELL DONE MARK ANTHONY,  JENNIFER LOPEZ👏😃😃😃
For those questioning why this program was focused solely on Puerto Rico  and not so much on other places it's because this program was set up by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony.  Jennifer Lopez has lots of influence to bring Hollywood stars and American singers (than any other Latin star) together, and she called on them to help with the Island; and to televise this program, especially on NBC (beside Telemundo/Univision) to help Puerto Rico since Puerto Ricans are American citizens.  Jennifer got her friends in Hollywood and NBC to sponsor her to have this program televised.   Jennifer called out to the world, her fans, English and Spanish singers to help.  I don't see why other stars cannot to the same thing for their own countries.  Jennifer did say some money will be distributed to American Virgin Island and Mexico as well.
I love Puffy, soooooooo cute!!!!! So humble, the integrity,  I love it....
How does Ricky Martin look so good??? Like does he even age?

It would be nice if Mexican artists did something similar. These artists were mainly PuertoRicans... so they focussed more on representing Puerto Rico.\nFuera bueno que artistas Mexicanos hicieran algo similar para representar a Mexico...como\nHa-Ash, Lucero, Gloria Trevi, Pedro Aguilar, Pedro Fernandez, Talía, Alejandro Fernandez, Alejandra Guzman, Maite Perroni, Ramon Ayala, Gerardo Ortiz, Banda el Recodo, Duelo,...todas la bandas y grupos! \nay muchisimos artistas que pudieran hacerlo por Mexico! 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Y que viva la raza latina puñetaaaa
Y QUE VIVA LA RAZA LATINA

Yo soy de Pierto Rico y eso fue horrible yo estaba en el techo 12 o 13 horas con ráfagas y lluvia. Yo estaba con mi perra que es un bóxer y ella está enferma y estaba también con mi mamá y mi padrastro en el techo. Hacía mucho frío y el agua subía y subía cada vez más y los carros sonaban abajo del agua y algunas carros y guaguas flotaban y con gente machor,niños,adultos,adolescentes y con animales en los techos. En otros pueblos de Puerto Rico el agua subió 15 y 20 pies que la gente estaba en los postes. A mi me subió menos de 10 pies,pero fue súper horrible. Casa todas aplastadas y destruidas. Gente perdió todo yo tuve pérdida pero estoy viva y gracias a Dios tengo señal y Internet en casa de mi papá y por eso estoy escribiendo esto.\n\nQUE DIOS LOS CUIDE Y QUE NO LES PASE COMO A PUERTO RICO LE PASO Y A MI.
Where Kim !! I need to see kimk
1:44:54 Whats the name of the song?
As usual, I underestimated how long the podcast would take to upload, but it's already available at www.showmakers.fm, and will be on the youtube channel soon.\n\nPlease check out Brilliant too, it's a fantastic site and fits my channel perfectly: http://bit.ly/2xDcRNe

the LaWS is wayyyy coooler
Was that a nuke 1:17
Say don’t rail guns also work in space because no explosion is necessary?
I would consider the atomic Annie to be the most powerful gun to be honest.
Can you do an episode about different was to extract oil/gas from the ground? Feel like you would like learning about it, if you don't know much already
Anyone else notice the Canadian flag at 0:51
Wouldn't the acceleration at the moment of the shot destroy a satellite that was to be sent to orbit by it?
A Certain Scientific Railgun. Always comes to my mind whenever I hear, or think of Railguns.
False: Chuck Norris is most powerful gun
who the hell needs universal healthcare anyways?
Shoot Someone with it
Yes, I understand some of these words
Forget railguns. we already have the technology to finish operation: Star Wars
I have a rail gun on gta 5
Whether you love the US or hate the US we are the best chance Ally countries have at surviving war regardless of how crappy our leadership is at the moment. I'm so glad I live in the USA! Very interesting video btw!
Make it like the mini gun roataing barrles. In masseffect there guns use two barrles to help cool the gun before it overheated. So make our rail gun like a mini gun.
Imagine this going through your body *ROBLOX OOF*
Yes..... The perfect thing to wipe out humanity from the face of the earth.
I think all guns bombs and weapons *not knifes* should be thrown away crushed and then thrown into the ocean for a long away generation to find then blow up the planet and not us :) im **copyright cannot show** and i think the government are stupid in some ways
Their most powerful weapon is not confront strong countries. Only peasants in Afghanistan and Vietnam.

video on hypersonic rockets?
Savas cikti :( https://youtubem.video/r/?OqEZKyso1elHn=eFKC5nJib9i
They'd be amazing in space. No air friction. I'd be bad-ass. You could even destroy entire buildings on the surface with such a thing. The moon, mars, even the sun. Space forts. Rail-mail  People are strange.
I don't like railguns. Coilguns are better.
Alright stupid science question... To reduce the friction on the rails, could they not use magnets to levitate it slightly over the rails, similar to mag-lev trains?
would magnetizing the projectile and creating oscilation on the barrells improve or incapacitate this design
If the momentum of the asteroid coming towards earth is *A* then the momentum of the projectile fired at it would be close or equal to *A*\nGoing by Newton's 3rd law that means the satellite will be propelled towards earth with a momentum of *A* as well when firing the projectile. \nso basically it will be as if the asteroid itself hit earth. lol
Chorge !

Most powerful pfft my farts is the clear winner
Okay but when will we be running around in Power Armour carrying a small one of these at our waists and ripping through aliens and shit like in Halo
BAE systems is not from usa DUH
1:27 why did you use Angola as target example, that's very rude and offensive
Make a video about Gas propulsion Engine
Nice video.\nInteresting how you showed bombarding Angola during the range comparison
A railgun? Now all you need is a Metal Gear to carry it.
Effectively a rail gun is the Justice League Space Station that orbits earth. Using the Stations mega gun requires the entire stations energy, and once fired, shuts down the station of all electric power for the next hour. It only retains orbit via emergency backup generators. Wow.
*generic comment about the US military that makes me an expert
Subscribe to my channel CJ Collins
Trump is America's most powerful gun, because he destroys anything he gets near!
At least it's not 1.21 gigawatts.
No better catalyst for technological advances than war
I need this for protection
Knew it was a rail gun I'm so dumb
5:26 ACE COMBAT VIBES!!!
1:45 shooting Angola? Why Angola?
5:32 giant railguns in space? halo much...?
ALL HAIL SEA PYRAMID
One question... Why fired Angola???
They should attach it to a mech and call it metal gear 🤔
Guys I’ve got some contest I’ll be winning 75,000k if I can manage to get 200 subscribers in a week. Pls help me out guys! Love you so much 😌😌
BAE systems? Didn't know my gf worked on rail guns.
Oh wait, they don't have internet
This tech can be used for transportation. If it is more cintrolled
Wonder what happens if it misses target? I mean it keeps going for long way at mach6.
I don't imagine any single nation having a space railgun will sit well with any government, even if the intention is a peaceful one.
So the railgun is basically just a giant electro-slingshot!!
I thought it was plasma erupting from the rail, is it not?
Sending a railgun into space would never happen. It would be a diplomatic nightmare for obvious reasons.
My dad is in the military, he's gone right now
When are we just going to move into standardizing ATHENA
One of its huge problem is that it's not EMP proof
I’m waiting for when trump finally nukes North Korea
Its our kinetic scalar satalite, but you did not hear that from me.\n\nMajestic / Cosmic
I wish this guy is my physics teacher
Military if you somehow see this... USE REBAR METAL!!!!!
The US military's most powerful gun... built and designed by the British.
5:28 We'll also need them for the covenant.
Why does this remind me of that American fighter jet that cost a stupid amount of money and had so many design problems that it will never see live combat but it still cost multiple billion dollars.
This video is a lie.  The most powerful gun in the US Army's arsenal is Lada Gaga's cock and balls.
Relying on a round to complete the electrical circuit is a fatal flaw.  The rail gun will always have very severe barrel wear.   Now if only we could use a mass driver (linear motor)(ungoverned meglev track) or Gauss gun (coil gun) (Stacked stator rings) you could avoid friction with the barrel sides all together.  Both of these frictionless guns are far more complex to engineer and miniaturize.
5:07 where is this ship?
'gee whiz' weapons are fine. But without good intel they're (mostly) useless.
*War, War never changes.....*
BAE Systems\n\n\n\nBritish-Airspace-electronic Systems... Don't cum yourselves America, it's not even yours mate.
We still use railguns?  Don't they break after using a few times?
Could you make a video about naval lasers next? I heard they are too a recent technology being tested on ships.
1:43  why is the battleship shooting Angola XD
I love your Chanel, I really like the engineering begind all stuff. But engineering should be use to mankind imprubement. Engineering of killing peopple Is not. Please dont make any more videos on weapons
Still can't win the war in Iraq or Vietnam though and many others lol
It fires 100 dollar bills (USD) fashioned into ammunition.
I'm not sure I've ever commented on a YT vid before (even though I've been watching you for hundreds of years now) ...I just felt totally compelled to tell you that you look absolutely especially stunning here, just such a babe! X
was gutted when you didn't try the urban outfitters dress on :(
Do you ever shop in Pull & Bear? I just imagine a lot of the stuff being things you'd wear!
I LOVE your makeup! Minimal face makeup and eyes and a bolder lip. Very different than a lot of looks that you rock, but it's perfect and I want to try it!
You should ditch the extensions and cut your hair into a bob
Pray the rosary everyday and quit the vanities of the world, because the world is passing away and the life of the soul is what is everlasting
Loving the simpler make up on you ..so pretty
I've just found you through Megan and I'm SO CHUFFED! You're wonderful! New fan :)
I can’t find a good pair of jeans anywhere!! I’ve tired topshop Jamie jeans (last 6 months) tried new look (sizing is so bad), asos again sizing issues (always falling down) superdry jeans (too pricey & fake pockets) so any suggestions I’m open too XD.  #help!!!
I love your hair with that bow it looks soo cute!
Why didn't she try on the dress?  I wanted to see it :(
Hi Helen ! In what size did you buy the yellow jumper from Zara? Just asking for reference, I like my jumpers to be oversized but not too much 😅😊
Oh my gosh you are soooooooo beautiful ... I love the no makeup look and your hair are on point  🤘💗🎀
you look sooo beautiful! love the minimal makeup look on you!! 🤗💕
looooved your hair and makeup in this video helen! x
Where are your pants from ? The ones with the cow print ? 😊
I don’t know why Helen, but you are one of my favorite youtubers! You are always so happy.. I love your editing... the colors.. the music and ofcourse your style! You are just so cool :D
Primark have jumpers almost the exact same as the one around 5 mins, it's chenille! Th only difference is the neckline
Eeee I have that white jumper with the fluffy sleeves and I adoooree it!! It's so nice on and super comfy 🖤
You look so young and fresh in this video! Would love to see an updated skincare routine, your skin looks amazeballs.
I love the lipstick you're wearing in the cut away!!!!
OMG YOUR MAKE UP LOOKS STUNNING! love love love it!
You have the most beautiful facial bone structure! ❤️ kisses!
Can you consider signing up and selling on Depop please!? LOVE most pieces you wear.
You are literally the girl in me before you. You look and sound the exact same
I dont want to say that i like you way more without much eye makeup or in general makeup, but you LOOK SO GOOD and fresh without heavy makeup! It looks so natural and ..just great! :)
Crazy I never noticed your eye colour before! Must be your makeup today -  😍
You look AMAZING in everything 😍😍😍
That white jumper from Zara looks\namazing on you! Reminds me of Christmas!!!
LOVING LOVING LOVING you in minimal makeup you look so fresh and Parisian!
Makeup looking lovely! Few things will be seeking out this weekend. It's Prince of Wales check, rather than dogtooth or herringbone x
Omg you look so pretty with minimal makeup!!!! ❤
You are so beautiful Helen x
Loveing the makeup! You have beautifull skin and don't need foundation :D
I love the way you manage to make everyday or more casual outfits look really interesting and glam. You have the best style :)
everything about you is perffffff xx
You are so beautiful. Your lashes are just INCREDIBLE.
Just wanna say how much I love your videos and the effort you put into each of them. Got a little bummed when I didn’t seen “try on” in the title, but alas! You tried things on (I hate when hauls aren’t try ons, you don’t know what things look like!) You never disappoint.
OMG, babez, you look so cute today! What is that lipstick you're wearing in the try ons? It looks so beautiful on you! Pls let me know! xx
Always find it weird  I see stuff I already own in hauls
ahhhh I’m trying to save money😩😩😩😩😩
Where's the jumper ur wearing from? It's amazing
This could've potentially been a very expensive video for me to watch, if I didn't have to shop in the girls/teen section of every store! 😂😂😂
That top at the end went with everything you put on! Love it 😍
Actually loving the lighter makeup on you, looks so fresh! And that white jumper from Zara wowza! XX
@Helen if you want to revive your old face jeans you can buy some dylon dye that you put in the washer, worked a dream for me! hope this helps!!<3
i looove the lace up kinda jeans so much!!
As soon as you said that you’ll love this jumper I knew which one it was before it came up, saw it the other day and fell in love 😍😍😍
On the white boots, the right foot has a stud missing.. unsure if you noticed?! 💗💗
I love the fluffy sleeves from Zara - such a statement piece :) xx
I bought a mustard jumper just like that yesterday but in Primark, fucking LOVE it!! So warm and incredibly soft 😍 \nLove, love, love your sense of style! 💞 xx
The v neck on the rusty/mustardy jumper looked really flattering on you, Helen! Really lovely. Love your hauls :) x
Your pink coat YES I'M IN LOVE
You didn't show us you in the yellow dress!!
I absolutely love how mustard colored clothes look with your purple hair 😍
Love love love that you have your own style and that you aren't like all the other you tubers that are carbon copy's of each other. So refreshing 💕💕
Those bright pink trousers look so good on you! I'm loving everything you've gotten in this haul 😊 x
The slight rumbling makes me think of paranormal activity when the bass comes up when crazy shit is about to happen
They do the coat in grey as well - bought it a few weeks ago it's amazing!!
You look so lovely and fresh without lots of eye make up!
You look AMAZING in the cutaways!! I don't know if it's your make up or weight loss but your face just looks incredible, and obvs just love this video because what's not to love 🤙
Hel you look so cute and fresh faced in the cutaways where you’re trying the stuff on!
Love your style Helen- so fun which is what fashion should be !
looking so cute with this make up 😍😍 great video Helen 😊❤❤
On the white boots there is a big stud missing ( right side of the screen)
Helen, how do you like the UO top? I've been eyeing it forever and am on the fence about buying it because I'm plus size so I don't know how well it'd fit me.
Do a video with all your favourite new looks!
The fact that I can kinda hear the music but not really is making me crazy
I love white boots! I have a pair of white platform ankle boots with a three inch heel, the entire thing made me five inches taller! I wore them to death though and I think they only have about two wears left before they really fall apart!
I was watching this intro thinking what have u done different your makeup looks so good and fresh!! Then u said u had hearsay any on 😱 man I wish I looked fresh with no makeup lol
I love this makeup!!!! Like the minimal eye and brighter cheek makes you look like a beautiful doll!!!! Love u <3
Can we just talk about how everything fits her perfectly?
You just ooze beauty and are so stunning ☺️ I genuinely dig your whole aesthetic ❤️❤️
Miss Helen I think you need some Freddie's of Pinewood in your life and Vivian of Halloway
Helen looks like paloma faith in the video!
Not much on pink but that coat though. Love It!!
Really digging the minimal makeup and that you can see some of your beautiful freckles more! Love the vid as always Helen!
That's a Helen coat 🍉💜 Love the whole haul. Xoxo
Helen where is your jumper from?? I lurvvvv it xx
Just wanted to comment on how stunning you're looking in this video! xo

People watch videos about people buying clothes? Wow.
<------loves pinkelephantday
Prefer you makeup here
those trousers from miss selfridge are beautiful :o
You look great
That coat 😍😍
The jeans with the eyelets looking fricking amazing!!
The 'rusty mustard' jumper material is called chenille 😘
<3
The material is called cheneille I think ? So incredible in jumper form and doesn't get bobbly !
I love your videos especially the hauls.. I love hearing you describe items hahaha, rustardy mustardy :)
Haha love you girl your lipstick missing in the corner and mascara  all over your eyelid.  No fucks given
I love your style! ❤❤❤
I am seriously considering a full on genderbending dragqueen lifestyle when I see half the clothes you buy and wear. Like that floral mustard dress, good lord, I'd be living my Janis Joplin at Woodstock-dream 24/7!
OMG! Finally I found a liverpool youtuber! 👏👏👍
Loved this? Where’s the cute blue tie up top from? xoxo
Ok I'm going to say it as a female....Anna's boobs look great. As well as her hair.
Let me be your 400th dislike...
Anna, you’re so beautiful, I’ve been following you for 5yrs now and you get better with age x
Did she say: she has 3 and wants another.😭\n👧👴👶👶
Anna, you are just gorgeous, and so sweet and real--so happy for you and your sweet family!!  💕 Lisa
Anna, thanks for sharing your Q&A! I always enjoy your chats. The story about Emilia and Eduardo was so funny. 😃 Never a dull moment with kids! BTW, you look so beautiful, and I love your hair! 💖💖
You really looks stunning, looks so happy and amazing! 😍 I have never thought about this before but you look like Jennifer Lopez, love love love your hairstyle and the color 😍 keep up the good work Anna! ☺️💕 love from Sweden
What's this channel all about?? Kids?? 🤔😁
Anna and I are literally the same person 😊♥️
Tits
I'm half Italian and my siblings and I all have French names! So does my mum!
You start to look like JLO 😊
Your eye makeup is stunning !😍x
Going to show this video to my hairdresser cause I need this hair color!!! Its beautiful!
Who cares
Are this the person True geordie is talkin about
I love you so much Anna, you are incredible 💗so beautiful 💕✨🌸☁️💗xoxo
Your whole bit about how you deal w keeping a tidy home made me cry 😢 thank you! That is such a good way to look at/deal with it 💞💞💞💞 xoxo
A lovely video Anna I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):)
Wow u look so much like j lo there
Wait, Anna's only 29?!  Huh!
Girl, you look so gorgeous! Like a greek goddess! Is it creepy if I say your curves look fabulous?
I love the name Alessia :)
Seeing her childern with that pout I believe she has not done any lip job 😘😍
She has a bit of a irish accent am i right??
Hi Anna, thanks for sharing a little tidbit of yourself. I wonder what Emelia & Eduardo’s newest adventure code will be..lol.. Just wait till they get Alessia involved when she grows up..lolI don’t have Snapchat or Instagram so thanks for sharing this vlog. You&your family are lovely. Take care & see ya : )
Rumours?! Clearly I’ve been blind to everything...
Francesca is my middle name. Also a family name. ❤️
Does anyone know the song at the end?
Do you walk all the dogs at the same time? Id like to see that in a vlog :D
I love your hair in this video! You look stunning xx
U have a brother? Never saw him
You have Grown into Such a Wonderful Lady.. So many Changes Anna, in you Attitude and Really matured beautifully.,💖💖
Could you PLEASE share some insights on having a family in the spotlight, like especially because you are mainly social media based. How do you protect them? Do you get threats? Could you be real about your struggles? For all the moms thinking about blogging but torn about how much exposure to give their children? Any advise?
Would love you to do a skin care and/or hair care routine video!!
I’m i the only one who thinks she looks like Jennifer Lopez?
I think people think you have had plastic surgery because you look so different from when you guys first started vlogging. Your makeup is drastically different, the dark eye color and orange hair made you look older. People change, you can change your makeup and hair color and look completly different.
can anyone tell me how to open up description/info box on desktop with the new YT interface? :(
Aw Anna! You're such a lovely lady! I love watching your videos!!
I love that your doing 3 videos a week. Missed you Anna
Are you going to show your Fall/ Halloween decorations? I always like to see these.
Anna you are a RAY OF LIGHT! <3
Keep it up, Anna! I love your hair, you look beautiful!
Filled with so much gratitude that you are back to uploading AND blogging! <3
Your foundation looks amazing! What foundation is it?
I am glad you're back.  I've missed your vlogs!  You're one of my favorites.  :)
You know how people think that you have botox, in your face. should take it as a compliment.
Anna is so gorgeous! Her hair looks so nice ❤️
I think people forget that Anna is still only 29 and also is natural beautiful. Not every body needs or wants Botox!
Literally made me feel 100 times better today. I have two kids one is a month old and the other 3 and she has the worse cold. No washing done and no cleaning I feel so guilty but seeing this made me feel so much better
You're so sweet, Anna :-)
Halloween 🎃 House Tour?😍
Anna please bring back the baking videos !!
loved this! You look amazing! xxx
I love that alessia has my name as her middle name!
Thanks for this vlog was funny introduction and entertaining! You look great the way you are right now! Keep the healthy lifestyle!
lovely to have your videos again 😊💕
You should take it as a compliment that people think you had plastic surgery 😅
I wanted A name for someone to be on my team .....
You look so beautiful Anna xxx
Aww great chat 😁 emilia and eduardo are funny kids 😂 the code word haha truly creative children. Wish you all the best 💖
Oh pls stfup 😴
Love this video so much😍😍Well done Anna😘😘
Hi Anna so glad u came back and you don't have to explain yourself to us and love u see u guys in Glasgow
👍So happy your back Anna😗
When you're so pretty they think you've had plastic surgery.
That earring story was SO funny! My girls were 3 years apart and they used to scheme. But more often, my littler one would prank or mess with my older one.
You look so pretty Anna! I do think you look younger but I think it's from the kids being around you have so much more energy!
Anna, you look a little like JLO😊
Anna you are So beautiful❤️
I stepped on a pack of good lads too...lol
Yeeey excited for a new video! Your skin and your hair looks so amazing!! 😍\nBTW any small youtubers wanna support each other? 💪🤗💕
I agree when you have a little more weight on you it does make you look more youthful I also think you look so much better now a lot more healthier and also realistic to every women our there and being honest about juggling children , work  and workouts and something had to give we all do this as working mom's and I'm so glad your honest about this issue also .keep doing you and what's best for your family we are just mommy's trying to keep it real 😀
Anna is so beautiful!
U look beautiful
You're so stunning Anna!
Great chatty video 😊I was the same with wanting an organised and tidy house, when I had my oldest ( now 22) I stress so much about it all but when I had my other 2 ( now 8 & 10) I came to realise life is too short to worry xx
I just wanted to clarify that post partum depression doesn't necessarily happen a few months down the track. It can happen at any time. :)
I love how the kids interact with Alessia. I agree with just kind of embracing the madness that comes with three kids! Lol
I don't particularly think you look younger... ditching the bleach blonde and fake tan from the early days defo helped bit you've just grown in yourself.. like everyone does 😂😂
Great video x
The earrings trap story was the funniest!! 😂 looking gorgeous Anna 💕
love your video anna
You are stunning
Rock On !!!!!!!
Welcome backkkk :)
Your Hair 😍😍
really enjoyed this x
hair tutorial please
You look absolutely stunning Anna :)
You are amazing ❤️💯
So gorgeous Anna😘X
Cut your haïr short !!!! :-)
PPD isn't because you have time to sit around and be depressed....I had my 3rd child in December and let me tell you, I'm struggling with the worst PPD ever. So good for you who doesn't have time to be depressed because I don't either but it happened. I cannot control it.
How do u afford 3 kids while UK is so expensive and you want a fourth one hehehehehehe
No cos you said we only film a few bits a day. Your cheeks are huge . Liar
To be honest I never saw myself having kids in the future either, however I’m now 30 and I have a 13 yr old, 11 yr old, 2 yr old and am pregnant with my 4th but I have changed so much and I can’t remember what life was like without they are my life and I wouldn’t change them for the world. Anna you are a true inspiration and I look up to you so much xxxx
Had no idea Anna had a brother?!
Funny how when you talk about plastic surgery you say you didn't get your lips filled or Botox but you don't talk about the things you DID get done because that would be outright lying.  Anyone who used to know you (wink wink) knows you got your nose and your boobs done.
you look 40.
Where the heck is that elephant from?💜
Loved your acting in the Madea movie wish you made puns in the movie
HI LIZA IM A HUGE FAN BUT CAN YOU MAKE UR VIDS A LITTLE LESS INNAPROPRIATE  !! \ncuz 13 yr old liza FAN WANNA  STICK TO CLEAN CONTENT BOO  HOLLA!!!!!!!!!!

I hope you enjoy the video, if you did! Be sure to Subscribe to see more :)
your grandad is a joy to watch haha
Bent him over the machine and gave him the finger treatment cause he were paralysed and crying I honestly lost my shit 😂😂😂
Tom, your grandad got it the wrong way around.  If the royal standard (the flag that was above Buckingham palace in your vlog) is flown, the queen is in residence.  If the Union Jack is flown, the queen is NOT in residence.
Your grandad is Amazing! We Love GORDON! ❤️
I was in absolute hysterics from the phone call at the end. GORDON FOR PRIME MINISTER!
Had the time of his life :D
*Before watching this video.*\nAw hes so cute, so awesome. Keep it up Gordon!\n\n*After*\nYoo Gordon a savage! Bashing heads, finger treatment!
gordon is so adoreable! i love this vlog
You look a lot like your grandpa
@maxwellrodriguez_

The flag that was flying means that she is in. They fly the British standard if she isn’t in . Mainly she lives in Windsor palace

I have subscribed to your instagram and I am @aideen1970
Every Vlog from now on I am going to write this ♡ Day 196!
Oh you mean this carl😂😂 I laugh so hard😂
Gordon is a LEGEND!!!!
Hate to say it but Gordon is wrong! When the Union Flag 🇬🇧flys above the palace the queen is NOT home, when the Royal Standard flys  above the palace like in the video it shows the Queen is home
@lil_pidge_ Still tryin' for that controller!
Gordon is the best!!!
6 ads 40 minutes
So this video has barley 200k views and is in the trending section and has 8 ads in it... okay...\n\nThis guy also conned his fans.
Old people are the best
Man like Tom on trending and all that.
That guard defiantly watches the vlogs Hahahaha his grandad love loves to moan and Carl pissing his sides at the end was brilliant
Tom this vid is in the trending section on YouTube wow
Most entertaining Vlog of 2017.
The queen is in when the royal standard is flying like the one in the vlog, not the Union Jack
Tom you should take your granddad to la with you
Fairly certain Karl made a Pheonix night reference which went right over Toms head 😂
@___b.en__
That ending tho! 😂
Best grandad in the world!
*Britishness intensifies*
That ending just scared the bejesus out of me

I think you’ll find the queen and royal family bring in money too Tom. Lots and gives our country a identity and shows our tradition and history.
#10 on trending tom
Im suprised he hasnt punched you
Seen how many ads, skipped the video, wasteman.
That is exactly what is wrong with these kids nowadays.. look there is drake. Who drake the rapper?.. no.. Drake who saved us from the  armada. Even when you google drake its the rapper ffs.. wild.
And this is the place where I killed many police officers and royal guards in Assassins creed syndicate
My Daughter flicks my Dad's/her Grampy's earlobes the same you do to your lovely Grandad!  \nGordon is an Absolute Legend!  Sleep Well, I hope you don't ache too much xx
We havent left the European Union
The flag above the palace was the Royal Standard meaning the Queen was in residence. The union Jack is flown when she is not.
I HAVE THAT BATMAN V SUPERMAN POSTER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel so happy that I have something in common with tom (apart that we are both from Manchester)
I remember meeting tom at Euro gamer 2013 outside the building in front of the surgeon van I was wearing a Minecraft creeper t-shirt
Did tom just say why do we need a Queen... Does he not realise that all changes to the UK and all changes to the law in the UK she has to approve or disapprove even if the UK Prime Minister wants it or not. The queen out votes them all
Your grandad is the cutest!!! 😂😊
I didn't know Tom knew boulevard of broken dreams
Hate ta tell ya, but she's home when the Royal STANDARD is flying not the Union Jack. So the flag that you guys saw meant she was home
Your right tom about the pendolino or technically class 390 its max speed is 140mph but only goes 125mph
i think toms business syndicate original should sell a light grey jackets just like cordons. id buy that shit! gordon is a legend
What a beer pour!!! I'll show you how to pour a proper one
Your Grandad needs his own Insta!! Who cares about people's cats and dogs, I wanna see a page about Gordon!❤
Some of Russia is in Europe some of its in aisa it's weird
Should take em with ya to la show em round the sights
I NEED TO GO HERE IMMEDIATELY, such a beautiful vlog <3
Hands down nothing more attractive than a intelligent male/female. Aslan is the walking definition of why it is so important for our generation to READ books, gain on that general knowledge. You guys are hands down one of my favourite YouTube couples followed closely by Fleur & Mike Deforce xxx
Haha loved the shoit part! Good lookin’ couple 😍
beautiful..
Beautiful hotel, sadly out of our budget 🙁 but thanks for sharing
The audio quality is insane!! Huge thank you!
Ohhhh my goodness. It is my number 1 dream to go to santorini. 😭😍 Sooo lucky.
So lucky!!! Makes me want to drop everything and go somewhere
There's a shower gel by Korres called Santorini Vine and it genuinely smells like Greece, I really recommend it! It's amazing.
So beautiful. Thank you for sharing!!!!!
Oh the memories! We went there four and a half years ago on our honeymoon and also stayed in Imorovigli. We were like the fourth to last hotel, you would have walked right by it. Man it’s beautiful. We neeeeed to go back! We did the hike right when we got there and were NOT prepared. We just went out, only brought one bottle of water, and were wearing flip flops. Whoops! We did the sunset in Oia, our hotel, and Thira and it was so amazing. Thus makes me nostalgic... thanks for the video! Shout out from Red Deer, Alberta!
esteem I'm sorry i just need to say that you are a beautiful classy lady:)
Those views are what dreams are made of!
Estee, you should really try the Korres body lotion/ shower gel in Santorini Vine! It's my favourite scent out of the whole brand, which is greek and natural ingredient based! They're amazing!!
You picked the best time go. I will say until September Santorini is packed. Enjoy!
I love you guys! Couple holiday goals💖
If you loved the air in Santorini, I’d highly recommend going to iceland! You’ll love it, the air is so fresh
Aslan's crocs though. yasss bisshh slay all day. 9:47
omg Aslan's bouche pink velvet shirt is soooooo nice!
https://youtubem.video/r/?VMt4wsL4Twjv=db8Y7yd2ZUgPOEgsVkqK5KjM9CIY
Wow, Santorini is stunning!!! 💦💦💦
everything was lovely!
https://xn--g0haaaaaaaaaaaa.gq/r/?S8RGoh0KMu3rc=2vFo3i3TaO8ncJnMThxLOBU1zJLSdN76moJ
More Asland OOTD please! So sweet!
Omg looks beautiful😍💙💙💙
How.....do you know this?! Hahahhahaha
Beautiful!!
Best Santorini vlog ever!
amazing!!!
It is pronounced IA in greek. Weather in Greece is nice till almost Christmas time.\nBut July and August it is very hot.
I went to see how much money it would cost for me and my boyfriend to go to this hotel at the end of august next year. A week for 5.500€. So... That isn't happening. :D :D :D
In the name Oia, the O is silent so you pronounce it as if it was written Ia (capital i not l, lol)!! I am a big fan of your videos! Hope you enjoy your time in our country! Welcome! If you need any tips, feel free to contact me!
Awww, Santorini is my absolute favorite place. Love every piece of it. Have fun. xx Linda
The trail has a lot of wild oregano growing along side.
Why do you all watch these Fucktards!!! Get your own life.
I'm so glad you visited my country and had such a wonderful time. You should visit again and discover the unique beauty of many other islands as well! Lots of kisses!
You are such a cute couple.
The prices for the hotel are absolutely ridiculous!
I really really enjoyed this vlog! Now I want to go there too!!
this is majestic!!!
Santorini looks like the most beautiful place 😍 xo
what a beautiful video! this made me really happy <3
16:28 Estée has the most beautiful smile ever!
So happy you two visited my country!!!!
Estee, you are glowing. Love to see you and Aslan having such a wonderful time. Some of my favorite people ever, live it up in Santorini!
was thinking you guys both uploaded the same thing! I like the part 1/2 idea. Did you both edit the vlogs together?
I need to go right now, omg, so beautiful!
googled the hotel in case one day I go to Santorini - a little outta my price range 😳
This video is amazing , you guys are adorable
It looks AMAZING! Firmly on my Greece Trip list for June xx
Oia is pronounced Ia! Have fun in Santorini from a Greek in the UK :)
Honeymoon destination.....check!... No doubt about it Santorini it is!!
Estee,try the Korres Santorini vine line....I'm sure you are gonna love it!!!!First time I tried it ,I swear to God I felt I was there......also, Oia is pronounced Ia(not aia  but ea)....(oi in Greek is called difthongos, and is one of our 5 different Is)💖
I was in Santorini last month! It is so beaufitul place, thats true!! :-)
The fresh air they were talking about reminded me of when I visited Oregon...such clean fresh air!
Please break down your trip to Santorini on your blog! I do want to visit. The hotel room looked extremely claustrophobic though, so not sure I could stay there even though it looks beautiful. 😳
this trip of yours was amazing . One of the best vlogs!!!!!  loved it 😘😍
you guys are so damn perfect together UGH want.
The thumbnail is so so sweet especially you guys rarely kiss in front of the camera!
I can't stop smiling! So gorgeous.
Wow i wanna earn that much money via youtube so i plan this kind of trip as well
this video was so calming to watch... dreamy
Hey random person scrolling through the comments!\nI hope you have a great day! \nFrom a Danish singer who's dream is to hit 10k subs🍀
So glad you two had a great time in my homeland! Next time you are in Greece go to Chania. Aslan will love the history and you will absolutely love this adorable little town.
Ok, it's time for me to finally go to Greece! I've done a bit of research, since I watched your videos, and the end of September, beginning of October is a great time.
Hey Estee and Aslan! My fiancé and I visited Santorini last spring, watching your vlog made me wanna go back asap! Thinking about maybe getting married there... Who knows!
Glad you had a wonderful time, just amazing views. You just cannot beat beautiful Greece at dusk. Great video
Love all the extra information Aslan provides!!! Thank you
whoa i did the hike at the end of july and let me tell you i feel your pain! i pasted your hotel a bunch, i remember those chair with the blue cushin! ugh i want to go back
8:23-8:50 “how do you even know this?!” with your face expression haha! reminds me of my boyfriend. what a lovely paradise !
OMG what a hotel! Santorini is stunning.\nI really enjoy this video cause you two seem so happy... love both 😘
Also, your room is actually a cave. Most homes on the cliff are built inside caves which formed after the volcanic eruption thousands of years ago. It's practical because homes are sheltered from the strong winds which you probably felt at times!
the French Connection floral dress is cute! Like Aslan's pink corduroy shoyt too :0p. The Santorini sunset was so lovely. Gorgeous place!
I love you as a couple guys!!! You are the perfect match!
So glad you both enjoy this gorgeus trip, thanks for sharing.
That's one place my husband and I are dying to go soon!  I'm hoping it'll be one of our next getaways! My sister-in-law and her family (including her 3 year old and 10 month old) are in Greece for 5 weeks!! So Stunning there!
That French connection dress is divine!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 it looks like you had the best time! :) definitely need to get myself to Santorini <3 xxxxxxx
You guys do the BEST TOURS!! I am always relaxed after I watch them! THANK YOU!
I have developed a serious crush on you guys! Your vlogs are so pleasurable to watch, funny, interesting and beautiful. Are you returning to Norway anytime soon? Maybe Bergen? :D
I almost didn't watch this vlog because I want to go to Santorini sooo bad! IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
Honestly, this was one of the loveliest travel videos I've seen. Of course the views, sun, nighlitghs and the sea (and oh the food!) helped, but it was your chemistry that truly made it magical ♡ haha sorry I'm just a romantic
this was absolutely incredible! My boyfriend and I are now looking into planning a trip here! So gorgeous! Thanks for sharing estee :)
Thank you for this beautiful vlog, I would love to go there! And also, you look so gorgeous in that red dress, damn girl!!!
What a surreal looking place! So dreamy. A random question but, were there any bugs? You guys ate every meal outside and I didn’t see one insect. It truly does seem like paradise.
I’m so jealous ... stuck in my workbooks for school... seeing this thinking...FUCK maybe when i retire... anyone else? so beautiful.
for 800 dollars at least , the hotel has to be iconic hahaha
Looks like you had a lovely time! My husband and I went to Santorini for our honeymoon and it was just 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
This was such a pleasure to watch! So relaxing 😍
What a beautifully shot vlog, wanna go Santorini right now! I love you two so much and your chilled personalities are just so refreshing 💖
the colour correction(filter?) used in the editing really fits well with the whole Santorini vibe
I've been to Santorini!!! You just gave me major FOMO 😄 i would love to go back. I walked those same streets in Oia and snapped an epic sunset picture! It is just so gorgeous on that island 😍😍😍 can't wait to get back there!
Oia is actually the most beautiful place I've ever been to. Amazing.
Santorin si the mots beautiful Island I've ever visited
Stunning place,and an amazing vlog :))
Can't wait to see the boat trip it's so so beautiful I want to be there now! Xxx
Perfect travel vlog! Thank you for sharing.  Santorini is #1 on my dream destinations.
I am have greek and these video made me sooo happy! Such a beautiful video Estee! You are amazing! By the way, Oia is pronounced “ee-a” :)
Fat chinky and a flabby girl....fuck off
The colour is sooo off in this video it's a shame
She's gotten bigger
Thank you so much to Quidd for sponsoring us! Go get some Ryland, Drew, and Shane STICKERS here!!!!!! it's free!! http://bit.ly/2xs3Evj
I read the title like of course Shane would do that XD
How much do you get $$$ with a sponsership?
Do a video with those valet guys 😂👍
who else remembers Kyla Leon from =3 and being Harley Morenstein's girlfriend?
Excuse me but Drew got a TURTLE
Shane Dawson !! Lil miquela came out with a new song called ‘ON MY OWN’
Shane is such an amazing friend!!
10:58 did anyone else see that guy in the Window I thought he was going to jump
Oh my god I need diner benches in my house
Lol Shane, you're wearing under armour shoes, not sketchers.
I watched one of ur scary vids scrolls Down hey pizza
you need to clean your ears
I fucking love you , Shane. I swear, we are meant to be friends.
okay pizza is great and all but 4:28 DREW WHY IS THERE NO SPOT FOR YOUR TURTLE TO BASK? IT'S JUST ALL WATER? and i've never owned a turtle but like can't they get shell rot if they don't have a dry place with some sort of light?
Shane we need the valet guys in your next conspiracy video.
hear that? its the sound of my diet breaking
steven, adam and andrew sure have changed
I really want Liza and Shane should do a video, it’d be so cute and literally the funniest thing
Shane was being modest saying he couldn't afford the pizza right? Isn't he rich now?
you and Ryland are adorable, watching you guys be a cute and funny couple is just fun for me. PIZZA FACT!!
that's really good look shane eyes. 😂
Shane: I need to brush my teeth\nMe: You brush your teeth??? 🤔\n\n\n\n\n\nJk jk 😂😂😂 I love you Shane
seriously. how does he not have like 100 million subscribers yet. like he deserves so much more than he has. he is better than all of the youtubers out here. Like jake paul who? Pewdiepie who? Shane Dawson has everyone shook. he will cause an earthquake. i love you shane! 💖💖 (if you even see this)
Random fact: that Kyla Leon girl with the bill was Harley Morenstein's (epic meal time) ex lol such an unimportant fact but used to see her in vlogs/Insta pics all the time and now she's in Shanes vlog! She's gorgeous! ❤❤
the music was so annoying
Because it’s truffle I understand it be expensive, maybe not that expensive but *shrug.* \nMy problem is it didn’t even look that visually appealing. To me, it looked gross.
the staff at this restaurant holy hell... they're all amazing!!!!!
hope you see this Shane it would mean a lot I've been watching you  for a WHILE. I know you because of my mom actually so I wanted to tell you there's a guy at a after school program at my school named circle of sister we said you like Shane he said umm... That's a down grade then we said shoey (idk if I spelled it right you and Joey) the he said that's fine
I mean I don't like pizza but I'd eat it 👀👀
Hey Shane you should watch this video and see if it is accurate it would be great if you did a video of you watching it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvDR6EGeT-Y&t=184s
This video made me so happy omg 😂
y'all need to try some chicago pizza holy damn
Waiting for him to say “Bitch I’m shook”
7:44 Liza doesn't post on Wednesday 😂
My sister thinks you're unbearable \n\n\nbut it's ok ily
Or are together and the things you’ve seen in their videos
When Drew's pizza sign lights up it does the crust before the rest of the pizza and it looks like a penis. https://youtu.be/h_58pbU9udQ?t=2m52s
okay but 6:44 the editing was so goo
15:27 Ryland's pterodactyls screech or whatever it was scared me so much oml I was slowly falling asleep, then his loud screech woke me up
Shane: so how are we doing this? Are we closing our eyes? \nRyland: no I'm comfortable with my sexuality \nShane: *is confused*
If I could just meet you one time for one day and just go eat Taco Bell and meet your pets, life would be complete. 😂👍🏼
Imagine Shane watching the thunder music video 😂
Lol just re download quidd for the 10th time now just a while ago!
I was thinking about getting it but because of this sponsor I Will
Who else thought that the three slices of pizza was one piece. Am I okay?
Shane is my spirit animal
I feel out of place in a reasonable price pizzaria, but I would like the 1000$ pizza
La is so overrated that place wasn't even fancy AND THAT PIZZA WAS SO UGLY LIKE A REAL CHEF KNOWS HOW TO PRESENT IT bye Asf get over urself La
next video you should play with weird kids toys with drew
Love how they so honest howbot the pee in the cups
Im on the toilet having diarrhea, eating a gas station crispy kreme donut, while yall are eating a thousand dollar pizza
Across the way they make shorts.. channel name???
wile they are eating pizza im sitting on my bed eating chips.
Can you do more reactions to poppy music
I no ill never be seen but u changed I never see your life hack or fun things any more
Shane gets to spend a thousand dollars on pizza and my life is getting on ice early in the morning putting on heavy hockey pads and getting pelted with pucks lol
From here on out I’m only downloading #spons that #spon Shane .
OMG I HAVE THE SAME EXACT SHIRT AS DREW

I want Shane not that guy and I want posts every day like if you agree btw no shade to Shane at all I love his vids there amazing and funny I just wanted to state my thoughts !! Love your channel !!!!!💘
Hey shane whats the name of ur background music?
Does he mean gabbie at 7:43 cuz lets be honest, Liza *always* posts a day late on Thursday like jenna marbles
my fat self thought white truffles were white chocolate until i saw a comment that said they’re only found in Italy or something. so i wasn’t sure if it was chocolate or mushrooms so i had to look it up😂😭💀
I love love Shane so much because he is so humble. You know this guy makes so much money. But he acts like such a normal guy.
Drew was very quiet :(
WASN'T RYLAND ON BUZZFEED!?
DREW LOOKS SO HOT WTF
LMFAO THIS VIDEO HAHAHAA
Awwww the valet attendant

I DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE IT...oh shit wrong song
woman crush #1
What if that's just the way Jimmy Fallon laughs? 🤔
YOU'RE fat ! He cries because you're a bad celebrity.
Jimmy is so sweet!!!
Such a nice Person :)
pinks awesome. Jesus this guy is cringe to watch tho. So fake with his laughter. Are all american talk show hosts this bad?
Jimmy tries too hard to relate with his laughs and comments. Lots of guests just seem to smile and put up with him.
So, I've emailed Marshal...\nThats a different level xD
I think Jimmy has a little crush on Pink and who could blame him!!!   xox great interview
Go 'head, Big Sis. I just love P!nk. I love her personality and her will to not give in to trends.
Their pictures with them all bending the gender lines to push the filthy marxist luciferian hollywood agenda of post-genderism and ambiguity is digusting.
i have't seen a Pink Eminem... nah!
Pink suit to the VMAs is literally LIFE!!!
Love her!! This album is underwhelming but she is amazing!!
I like their song together on Recovery. I would have been shocked if Eminem said no to her after she’s been on one of his tracks.
She's an amazing woman!
Does she love Eminem after threatening to drop all his fans if they don’t drop Trump.  Thug...
Maybe coz her music has lost its edge? Just kidding but I really do miss the early 2000s
https://youtubem.video/r/?0Pr0v7FiTONNsiSNaCMwMGZ1mpdq9Ug=MxLkV5tRvjHDrB4srt
Гуф Умер!
Pink should do next super bowl halftime, cuz she's is awesome!!!
oh  so sweet !
Jimmy loves everything lol
I'd like to see Pink's bean.  I'd also love to play with her bean.
If she didn't look so damn stupid we might actually pay attention to her voice.
She's so great, god, I thank the universe for people like her.
I love to hear her lagth, I think I would tickle her for a long time just to hear it.
Ughhhhh STFU and let her speak
Pals rate Anyone  identify bigger  this case? laxghing
I would be honoured to have anal sex with PINK.
#get rid of jimmy fallon because he's not funny
Fire Starter,.....lol, priceless,....and actually, she does, lol, and that lip synch part, ha, amazeball's!!  Love her, and her new album is amazing :D
Love it!! Check me very fast bass player https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfjY1UtIWmDN4sDXtpt2hIg?sub_confirmation=1
The part where she talks about Revenge and how she was drinking wine and wanted a Rap Grammy and asked Eminem and whatnot-- she gave that interview on the radio here in New York VERBATIM like to the point I was just wondering if they edited out Jimmy and put in Elvis Duran's voice like every little joke she made and EVERYTHING. Until Jimmy interrupted her joking along about the email it was EXACT. Like, I get that they have to tell the same stories over and over and shit when they're doing promo for an album and especially for one specific single BUT usually their answers are slightly different seeing as they're talking to someone different etc... this literally like was weird and made me feel like she's a robot HAHA. Seriously google the interview if it's up and you'll see... so weird. Ver-bay-Tum. Lol\n\n  Incidentally, Revenge is my favorite song rn like I LOVE it hahahaha it's just different and cool and funny. Also I love Eminem so there's that. Two thumbs up. (That song, plus the interview, actually made me DL the entire album and so far I've listened to like half of it and it's great, I highly recommend it).
If you sub to me I will sub to you
I cry when she sings too and at my age I'm nearly deaf.
Time is a heartless bitch to me,,but Missy Pink is holding up really well.   Funny stuff.   Meatball and Firestarter,,Ha!,,,  Kids have a bright future,  so long as their mom has a good heart, which she does.   Good luck Mom!
who cares? this bitch is ugly
P!NK has been around forever, yet I notice she's only recently been really famous, I don't get it.
what a brave transgender pink is. and what an Adonis belt!
Too bad cant afford to see her live
March 1st is my birthday!!!!!!! I will be 18!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU PINK
He cry’s because he hates her voice.
Pink is cool. M&M is a douche-bag.
I cry whenever she sings
Pink: Hi\nJimmy: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Love
Pink stinks
yo pink is qeer! JUGALO FOR LIFE!
Stink
She is lovely.
She is so cool...
pink is not her real  name but she is good i love  her
I love pink
Me too, she's not very good
I see Eminem in the description I click.
P!NK went to school with my mom in highschool
Pink is ugly,  and her music is bad, and shes stupid.
Shes so genuine and beautiful..good on you ms lady!
have u guys thought of P!nk doing the Superbowl Halftime show?
She’s fucking awesome! \nCan’t wait to see you in New Zealand
why at 0.28 does he always do that fake laugh?
Yo is she the one, Simon said was trash??
Give leading please export potato offer site treatment identical category.
I died when she said Eminem
P!nk and Em? Never even imagined it but now I can't stop wondering!
I love this woman! So excited for the new album and hope she brings her tour to the UK!
I cry when she sings too. Because I miss the old Pink. Now all of her songs are practically all the same.
I was psyched until I heard little Marshall was belching out his stench on her album.
Fallon just doesn't seem to connect with his guests. He's like an over excited kid on Christmas morning. Is that from smoking pot?
What do you see in your mom's hair
Wow, she's really cool 😎
*There have never been a pink m&m*
beautiful trauma and wild hearts can't be broken are amazing songs. Good job p!nk 👌
Holy shit Jimmy. It's not that difficult to learn the name of your guest's children and spouses. I have seen him fumble this so many times. It's so awkward to see him ask about people he clearly has no clue what they're called. I'm sure he has a research team who can write this very basic information on a card for him.
She has balls too.
Fallon's ratings are tanking lol
More pc social justice warrior mentality.
Jimmy... as annoying as usual.
burn Hollywood burn \nhttps://youtu.be/N2O7b4FcoXI?t=245
Come to Poppa \nhttps://youtu.be/tuveMDIAbd8
She’s a legend 👌🏾
I want her to be my Mommy. :D
I thought this was going to be a really sweet story about how her son loves her voice so much he cries when she sings... oops XD
1 minute long ad before the video WHOA
She should be a teacher of celebrity's behaviour.
This lady is such full of shit.... Jesus appears when she sings too
I am going to go see her live in May. I am so excited, not only is it going to be my first concert, but it is also to see the person I have wanted to see live for like 6-7 years. I love her so much. I can't even describe how excited I am
Love me some P!nk. ❤ #Awesome
Ugh I love her dress. Ugh I love her.
That colour suits her
carey is so handsome
And now MOM... MOM.....show us your NIPPLE rings..... Your only REAL claim to fame.... ..good God....HOLLYWOOD NOTHING TRASH.
Everything is so beautiful!! And we have the same birthday :D
I wish you would've tried them on...
I'm OBSESSED with your hair!! I couldn't stop staring at it the whole video.. oh and that dress you were wearing too!! I love sparkly stuff & clothes 😍
Loving the collection just wish there was a try on selection 😭
There was not one piece of clothing that I didn’t like!! I’m so in love!!
I swear you are so stunning gorgeous love the clothing style
Are the silk pink trousers short?
I feel like a lot of these outfits u NEED BIG boobs and butt for them to look good & are prettt expensive 😒 but are very pretty
so sad i live in italy and the shipping is everytime a problem. 😭
Hi Carli! I'm a huge fan of yours! The jumpsuit you are wearing I absolutely need it! I am significantly taller than you though, will the jumpsuits be long enough for some 6'0? Thank you! I love you!!!!
All so cheap and trashy looking. Pretty disappointed.
Carli where is ur dress from the one ur  wearing in ur video!?
I’m actually shook, these pieces are absolutely stunning!
PLEASE tell me what your wearing is in the collection 😍 I need this for my bday!
Some of these comments are so annoying and negative!! NOBODY cares if you wouldn’t wear these items or if they’re not “practical” enough for y’all. FASHION ISN’T MEANT TO BE PRACTICAL. FASHION IS A WAY TO SHOW CREATIVITY AND REFLECT YOUR PERSONALITY. CARLI DID THAT. Stop hating. \n\nGreat job on this collection Carli!!! You’re literally an inspiration ♥️🌹 \n\n\nI will be purchasing some of these items! Wish I could have every piece but I’m a broke college student 😭😞💔
ALL of these pieces are amazing! Congratulations!!! :)
Love this!!!! Neutral colors are my favorite
Love all these!!!! Could u please try them on for the second drop, just a little easier to see what it looks like on. AMAZING JOB THO!!!!😍
Pray the rosary everyday and quit the vanities of the world, because the world is passing away and the life of the soul is what is everlasting
Any small YouTube channels that would like to help support each other?? 🙋🏻💖✨
its so crazy because I've been watching you since your first videos were out back in the day so its awesome seeing how far you've come!! so happy for you!!
Tutorial on this makeup look! Beautiful!
So proud of you Carli! I love how successful you have become and it keeps getting better!
Absolutely love your collection Carli ! You should have your own store.  I would seriously but every single piece if I could. With the exception of the biker shorts.  Everything else I absolutely LOVE!
so excited to buy so many of these clothes!!! btw just posted a video of me using your palette (and i never do makeup) and I'm so proud of how it came out & am obsessed with your palette!! love you <3
SAVING MY MONEY FOR THE SECOND DROP WAY MORE! I might just buy 1 item from this drop but that's it!
Is this a limited collection?
I wish you wear everything that way we had a better view of what we are going to buy
When does drop two come out? I'm eyeing that camo like 👀👀👀
Carly!! Everything good is coming to you! Maybe for Christmas Brett will propose to you!!  I can’t wait!! Where are you going next on your vacation with Brett? I love seeing where you go on your vacation!! This will be the YEAR that Brett would propose
Your collection is beautiful. Price is great. I unfortunately don't have the body type to feel comfortable in any of these. You seem tired or a little sad... you deserve a break girl!
who else muted her chatty ass and kept watching :P
I wish this was a try on haul:/
i wish i had the body to pull of some of these items 😫
Girl my head is spinning. I literally have no words.
congrats! it all looks amazing! xo from my channel to your’s <3
But how can you wear those tops without a bra 😱
Such beautiful outfits from a beautiful woman.
Carli😔only up to size 12?😑c'mon that excludes a huge portion of your fans because we're too big😔I hope this was MissGuided's doing and not yours...
the navy pants + silver rhinestone top would be life changinggggggg
They're so nice but so expensive!!!
I honestly do not like this line because its all to flashy and overpriced. the only thing i would wear is those sweat pants . She did not make this line based on real women sizes only her size im small but still don't agree with this line. there are size 12    and what not but most women are not comfortable in crop tops and high wasted pants .
I love how you added plus size :)
OMG this collection is LIT! It's insane! Love it! Hard work pays off and I'm sure most of the pieces will be sold out in a few hours after the launching! An amazing collection created by such an amazing person! Congratulation! \nXxx
Carli! You look so happy! :D I can not wait to get my hands on some of these outfits and shoes 💕 Everything was so gorgeous :D you especially looked beautiful
If only I wasn’t broke
I LOVE the collection. Love how you didn't just put a logo on a plain t-shirt and sell it as your 'clothing line' like some other people... lol
OMG! I want it ALL!!! 😂🖤😍
Carliiiiii. I love your style! Everything is dope. Im so excited for this 2nd colab! 💃🏽
I love that you showed us pics of you wearing the items also so that we could get an idea on how to wear it! ahhh so excited! TAKE ALL MY MONEY SIS!
You are so gorgeous and I love this video! These clothes are so adorable and I can't wait to order some!
The prices make no sense. Skirt 25 and the top 25 which has less material.  You do the math.
So beautiful every piece of your collection Carly!! Congrats!! 👌😘🎉
OKKKKKK I need it all!!!!!!!
😍😍😍😍so proud of you!!!
so cute, wish you tried them all on though)):
Does anyone know how much the jumpsuit is she's wearing and what size it goes up to?x
Personally, it's not my style and I won't be buying, but good on you, girl. You'll make the money, while the bitter little girls on here will complain and leave sad remarks.
Amazzzzzinnnnggg!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍 Is it also available on the German missguided website or only us? 😅
Why are there no picture of the outfits ... kind of important
Every piece is beautiful! I wish I could pull all of these outfits off, you look amazing hun!! I NEED to shop your collection 😍😍😍❤❤
i just got back from Carli's NYC pop-up shop and i want to make it known that in real life, Carli is the sweetest person I've ever met who's famous. She gave me 2 hugs, complimented me, wanted a selfie and made small-talk even tho there was a rlly long line of fans (a 2 hr wait!) I'm so proud of who she's become and her Misguided collection is beautiful!!
Love you! Congrats baby! You are amazing! Love all the pieces! Lots of love from Argentina! 💚😍
I would love to see a plus size woman model some of these pieces 😍😍😍
Yikes. I'm trying to imagine a situation where it would make sense to wear this clothing. Basically an extremely fit 22 year old dressing up to go to a sort of tacky but fun nightclub? The thing is you can spend a lot less to look this cheap. The collection is so tacky is almost interesting. Like-- she thought this was a good idea! That is fascinating!
Nothing special.
I’m sooo excited 😆
Yooo 😍😍
Why no plus sizes!!! 😐☹️
CONGRATS GORGE
Definitely not fall, definitely not wearable
I loveeee everything !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats!!!!! 🎊
The best missguided collab so far.... congrats xx
WTH really size 12. What about us 14 gals.
I want everything 😭😭😭

😍😍😍😍😍 dying!!! That stone colored dress tho!!!
omg literally I need everything 😍
They are all gorgeous!!
Oh my gosh I am legit so excited 😍😍🙌🏼🙌🏼
Do the cargo pants run large like the sweatpants???
thank you so much for including plus sizes in your collection this time! but i was really disappointed to find out there is only 12 items in the first launch that are available in plus size. i really couldn't believe out of 51 items shown, i could only get my size in 12. Plus size girls like nice clothes too.
Does your collection go away I want to buy it for Christmas
I love your style!! <3
Carli I need the black lace bodysuit in plus size pleaseeee 😩😍
Yessss I’m gonna be ordering some stuff! ❤️
Love love love 😍😍 So excited to wear some of these pieces for holiday parties
I cried when you showed the clip of your sister. Congratulations, Carli!
Gosh you're so beautiful! I loveeee these clothes, watching it made me want to touch all the fabrics!!
Why are the photos so freaking edited, i'm mad, u're already beautiful.
Did you and Brett break up?!
Can't wait to order some of the amazing collection but that jumpsuit is definitely the first thing on my list, by the way , that ring though?
Good luck 🎀🎀🎀
too expensive gurl
I love Missguided but since they've gotten more popular, they suck with shipping.
Attention who ever went to the pop up shop! Was Brett there?????
I love u please get more tottenham vids out!
One can understand why, the players like him.. He is a very normal and clever guy on football..
Keep ArseAnal under keep Wenkar IN!

Can you guys do an episode about human asexuality?

Id really like to know how school affects anxiety because lemme tell you,  its definitely one of the largest factors in my anxiety
i have extreme anxiety. did i spell anything wright!???!
Why do we get side affects and why do only some of us get them? 💖💕
to answer your question yes\nvery
I still click on these videos even if the title doesn't apply to me whatsoever/doesnt sound interesting just because asap science is life
oh, so that's why my heart hurt and I was shaking and sweating, nervous at that maths exam, I did really bad, I couldn't think proberlly.
Greg and Mitch are like the sciency and more intelligent versions of Mitch and Scott from Superfruit and Pentatonix
Because I suffer from a diease that makes me smell bad called tmau. 😢😥
Next episode should be titled: “Your brain on child Pornography”
this video makes me anxious
Really enjoyed this video! so many facts about anxiety
because of my teacher
Some of u people need to stop feeling sorry for yourselves and get on with it lol
We're all gonna die one day :(
i live with panic disorder. much like the chipotle kid...  Omg Anxiety is my life. lol
i felt like crap these couple of days back. Now i feel better. I stopped smoking I think this is from childhood.
I think my anxiety stems from never feeling like I've done good enough so I think about ways I messed up. And if something does go my way I feel like I just injected heroine and I'm a rock star. And then I crash again
I watched this video to try and understand my anxiety. Now I ish understand it but now I'm terrified of it. Fml
Was recently diagnosed with severe reoccurring Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I didn't even think I had anxiety to begin with. My day to day life is a lot better now since treatment.
So thats why white people make me nervous...
can you please do a video on hypothyroidism? I have that and i have no clue what it is or what to do
Science, that's why
Meditate every day. Meditate. After 30 years of trying everything...
I was hoping this would be a fun cartoon, its more of a drawing thang tho...
i was Anxious to click on the video to learn why i am Anxious
This video just gave me anxiety
I'm the nigga
I get anxiety when I'm in line and the cashier gives me coins.
Started meds after 1st and biggest anxiety attack. It stopped the constant anxiety the 1st attack triggered but i didnt want to be on meds my whole life so i weened off it after like 6 months and started probiotics and eating better which helped some but the biggest help so far has been magnesium spray. Ive only been using it a week but its helped a lot. Apparently magnesium deficiency is hard to diagnose in blood work so worth a shot.
I’m anxious to find the answer
does any one know how I could make a video with this similar kind of style? any free programs or tutorials any one knows of?
I honestly wish people treated mental illnesses the same as physical illnesses. Just because it may be invisible doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It can be just as debilitating or worse. \n\n- a girl trying to cope with GAD/MDD
Read turtles all the way down for a deeper look inside anxiety and the disorder itself
Excuse me but your brain picture with the hypothalamus and amygdala is totally wrong. Everyone knows that they're part of the limbic system and that the hypothalamus lies just below the thalamus duh. I feel offended that you would even allow this into your video hmmpf.
Anxiety is  basically just excitement with low self confidence. I don't have any science, but if you think about it it makes perfect sense. I would assume that it's different for people with disorders
Got lost in the comments and then heard them talking about rats and strawberries and was like, what does this have to do with anxiety?!
When you drew the muscle I thought it was an almond.
Could you guys do a video on Social Anxiety?
I eat weed to combat it
Can u make a video about why are you suicidal. My friend is and I want to know scientific ways to help.
My anxiety came back while watching this video.
You should make a video of your brain lean
I hate when people try to discredit my anxiety by saying, “It’s normal! I get super anxious all the time too!” 😐
Talk about how society started using the word triggered all of a sudden...
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
I have severe social anxiety and I can't take it anymore this is too painful I just want to be normal
Sir please make a video on intermittent fasting and its effects on hormones such as testosterone and growth hormone and such for bodybuilding as i have seen many people claim that testosterone levels boost on intermittent fasting. Thank You in advance
Why am I anxious?\n\nWell um, why am I NOT anxious?
Video suggestion: Why do I ALWAYS wake up early and with so much energy after a night of drinking?!?
3:30 say it louder for the people in the back
*insert all the self diagnosed people*
I will make it.
Why are you anxious? “Well it depends....”\nOh wait wrong channel...
This video gave me a panic attack
Why could I hear the ASAPscience background tune in the thumbnail?
Because we are a social species being raised in an individualistic society. CBT is total crap. This science is flawed.
_[Jesus said] But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. _*_Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you._*_ Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid._ \nJohn 14.26-27
They tortured a mouse in the name of science so bad that even it's descendents were born in fear.😠
2:03 Over five yeeaarss (voice crack) lol but for real love you guys
I hate test anxiety, I have D’s in two clases
This is my first vlog and It couldn't relate to me any better! Thank you for sharing this and I'll be doing the same on my Facebook page. \nAlso, new subscriber!
OCD is awful. It's not life destroying for me but still causes much anxiety and more so eats up time. Some people must have it real bad - I have actually heard of extreme cases and the effects.
I had my FIRST anxiety attack yesterday at my school dance when I told my friend who I wanted to ask to the dance and he told on of her friends. I don’t really want her to know I like her
Do a Chronic Pain video
Pretty simple. Capitalism screwing us over and reading social media and internet comments way too much.\nIf we got off social media and all had fulfilling jobs and could afford what we needed to survive, anxiety would pretty much disappear.
just relax..listen to music.. catch new vid monsters Ball https://youtu.be/UI6ReevSTtE
Could you do a whole video on the science of therapy?
Could you talk about ADHD in children and adults?
Why are you anxious?\nMe: Well...\n*Unravels scroll and watches it roll through the door like my hopes and dreams did*
I need help, I always get flusted talking to people, Why??? 😶😶🙁😖😷🤕🤒😝😩😳
I feel like you guys read my mind sometimes and your like, alright he is now Anxious, lets give him some tips.
Idk why but I feel like he is a pervert
I get anxious just by reading the word Anxiety
Cause the spider that I just put a cup over disappeared
Ahhh. You’re taking way too fast for a video about anxiety.
anxious ppl work my nerves\nWhy worry about something that hasn't happened...
I was just asking myself this.
Why do we have homesickness?
Do a vid on being drunk and on xanax at the same time
Im always... Always panic because of school , im always afraid of what im i going to do to build my future , by studying and such... For example if i put a long term goal of having a PhD , i get anxious of what im i going to do to reach it... The hours i have to put in it , its like i have to breath books and infos to reach there... , im afraid i can't get the percentage required to get into a good university....
School makes everything worse for kids like me. Most the time I'm pretty good at acting confident and like I know what I'm doing. But when it comes down to final exams or anything major it freaks me out. But since I know why I'm anxious I've been able to stay confident almost all the time.

Well, that's just great. You hear that, Ed? Bears.
man ur starting to miss stuff.  Paul's steely gaze didnt fix the car.  It was fine.  She was using her child psychology on him to make him feel needed and masculine,  then started the car,  proverbially farting in his face,  proverbially declaring I AM THE ALPHA,  BITCH.
Did we not point out the black dude who appears in the beginning a little bit and then disappears and never is killed or acknowledged ( He was one of the counselors and can be seen in the scene where Paul  is explaining everything to the counselors)

Yo I agree with this 100% love u Eminem forever bro
I think em is the president now
That ain't EM lol,this is 3rd different MF,I caught it but didn't wanna believe it,but a couple other people caught it too.
The rap was cool thats all i dont care about the politics behind it because what America does is beyond my control, im not an american and its not as if a single comment on a video can change what he might do. So if you guys can stop whining about whether trump is good or bad, and just realize that everyone has their own opinions and whining about it wont help, it would be great.
Am i the only one who thinks Eminem is getting old now.. dam bro shave the beard it doesn't fit you or maybe its just me..#
This is one of the gayest raps ever. Thanks for drawing that line in the sand marshflake
Barack Obama was pretty racist, all I heard during his 2 terms was white cops shot black guy over and over and over again.\n\nMeanwhile you find out far more white people are shot and killed by cops and black cops kill black guys as well.
He has done better
Yknow for all the people saying this was bad or crying about how Eminem could ever talk about politics(lol I dont even listen to Em that much and I know he speaks on politics a good amount) havent seen one actual argument against what he said.  Even other Republicans are disagreeing with him or flat out endorsing his impeachment. Plus like really how is Nazis marching in the streets( yknow the guys who the whole US Army fought during the 2nd World War and gassed millions of people to death) less bad than football players kneeling. Lol thats infinitely more disrespectful specifically to WW2 vets the few that are left, not to mention the many vets coming home. Thats basically one small point out of many Eminem speaks on.
All the troll over the world is alike.\nI love you, But this...\nYou sound like you troll is Robots, without any thought of your own. Made in Russia. Paid by Trump.
Man Eminem is really trash now it's kinda disappointing
I like you alot eminem. Your music is amazing. But i gotta say i disagree with you on this one.
The actual M & M M&M's Milk Chocolate Candies have more street cred than this old man does now
This is such a stupid, stupid video lol
I wear a hoodie cause it makes me look tough,,,,, but underneath I'm really skinny,,,, kinda frail,,,, hell,,   I think I'll freestyle now,,, holy cow,,,,  my X is a fat cow,,,, think I'll bow,,,, down to the man, ,,,who has a game plan, ,, his name is Trump and I'm jealous,,,, like a little bitch,,, I can't take this shit,,,,, I can't rhyme,,, way past my time,,, I'm done!!!! Later son!!!!
Your too old let go
If you're not familiar with Battle Rap, and you say this flow is wack without actually having any understanding of the presentation and the format of his material, then you're delusional. The flow was great, vernacular/vocabulary is still there, and immaculate rhyming as always; his internals are killer. He utilizes his literary devices very well, decent wordplay/metaphors/similies/assonance etc.,,, .\n\n Not to mention the ability to bend words with his annunciation to compose his rhymes as well. I think it's very dope to take two words that you couldn't think could rhyme and actually rhyme them without it sounding extremely forced. If you take closer notice as well, notice how he lines up the syllables as well. Execution still on point. Delivery was a little weak in the beginning, ok I admit, but he warmed up though and still not terribly bad. Another point as well, his ability to vary  his vocal pitch is something I've always admired about him as well. Still extremely technical. You cannot undermine his technicality. He is a beast.\n\nOverall,  Dude is still very skilled. Point Blank. Of course we've seen better. I personally think his Shady Cypher with Slaughterhouse is better, but he spoke his mind and still did a good job with  the composition and structure of his shit, and 90% of rappers today cannot do this and If they can do it, most likely they're a battle rapper and I can bet you on that as that is the very thread Eminem comes from. \n\nConclusion:  Shit ain't wack, Ya either hurt what he said, or ya don't know rap in it's entirety. \n\nGood Shit Shady, you facetious bastard..  #EverybodyHatesTrump #ImGrabbingIvankaByThePussy
Remember when the media was against eminem? Remember when the radio wouldn't play his songs? Remember when the media said eminem was the cause of school shootings? Remember when the media said eminem was the reason gang violence was so high? Remember when the media said eminem was the reason kids joined gangs? Remember when the media hated eminem? Remember when he proved the media are a bunch of liars?\n\nNow he jumps on the bandwagon with the media, the same media that hounded him and demonized him for decades. Pulling the same shit the media did to him. Pathetic.
y is this blowing up lol
M a legend forever
TRUE THAT. Love it.
ALICE IN WONDERLAND USA/ WORLD
Everyone including Eminem barking on the wrong tree!
Eminem acting like a fool
That might’ve been the most least informed string of sentences I’ve ever heard
I like Eminem, but politics aside, this was just bad. How passionate, angry and out of breath he gets with all the pauses. Almost so bad it's good.
im not rapper nor will ever be one i do know that this flow is shit and so are the rhymes everyone is in titled to there own opinions on trump and im not here to argue that im just saying anyone who said that this was good please stop lying to yourself just because you agree with what he is saying or you are a die hard fan. this was a horrible freestyle and you know it lol
This is the least Eminem thing I’ve ever seen, wtf, it was shit and since when has Eminem been a triggered bitch
31 million views, that just shows EM is the god of hip hop and rap
I'd pay to see Kid Rock try and debate Marshall.
where is the beat ?????
Nothing but love and respect!  He siad it all!   PEACE
look at all the STANs in the comments, get off his washed up dick
Should could Hood wood. Dope rope soap hope. Car star bar far
I was just up dated on this its a fake look alike Eminem, this guy in the video is a chump. and thats not Eminem.\nEminem- Not Afraid (Fake News Against Eminem)
Every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime to tell em what's on my mind
It sucks that he had to draw that line. Looks like he is a dumbf*ck just like so many others. It looks like the real slim shady just sat down for good. Good job Marshal
The rhyme was great but next time do it in a studio with no friends in the back ground .... there was no need to have them there .. it feels like you were giving them fame for no reason ...... keep it real and like i said the rhymes were deep and great .... I pray for America
This shit is like watching the illest rap battle on KOTD or Smack URL. New days are coming for hiphop. Big shouts to you EM. And  .you killminati's bastards better not kill him fuckers ,!
Underwhelming. I think it's the beard
Skinny Jean wearing little bitch. Jump on the trump train to get more attention.  Everyone of those black chaps have stuck there dongas in m&ms clam flesh
Eminem hasn't been a decent rapper since Devils Night. I literally listened to The Eminem Show once through and threw it in the trash.
Well I used to be a fan of you Em. Until I saw this. Now I realize you’re just a bum ass rapper complaining about the results of democracy.. You will NOT reverse democracy, and the fact that you are helping in an effort to do so is the most unamerican thing you’ve ever done. You’re a stain
this is what democracy looks like! ...derp
Slim what the hell is this crap ? you made yourself look like a fool with this bro !
No. Please stop, you’re just a washed up rapper that left a legacy. Stop trying to be relevant and step out of politics, some of your songs mention you raping women and getting into gang related shit. You’ve even been caught beating your own wife. You’re no one to speak about his policies, and btw, you’re a little late with pointing out his “tan” is orange.
So ..Em went from making his career off of music talking about how much he hates his baby mama, his own Mom, and the LGBT community but suddenly he's a leftist knight in armor? Lmao make up your mind my dude. I don't even support Trump but this rap was whack.
What a disaster, amazing I once thought this punk had some talent.
omg ... DIVIDE TO CONQUER, RIGHT? But this time there is the internet factor you washed up communists. And you are losing the cultural war. And you cant shoot for shit, so beware of a civil war you pussies.
Thank u for trying to split our country up even more then it already is
rap is crap.how this trash became actual music is beyond me.as long as the rapper shuts up the music would be decent without lyrics.
Yo dis for collin, ball up a fist, and keep that shit balled he looks like a child throwing a tantrum.
That was a slick songbird McCain shout out.
Time for Eminem, CNN, Hollywood and their elite globalists to move on or move to Mexico and take your illegals with you. Pack of morons.
It's pretty funny seeing people who don't listen to Eminem talk about his music like they know it. Also pretty funny how all the former fans of Eminem who support Trump are all butthurt.
Im just here to laugh at the offended trump supporters lol
I'm not sure if America likes being the world's laughing stock at this point, or if it's people are actually going to stand up against their horrid government.
Hope you guys are not that stupid because he probably HAD A BEAT GOING ON IN HIS HEAD but the real meaning of A CYPHER is you freestyle without out a beat and if you think it's easy try FREESTYLING about a TOPIC OF A DISS
this clown was very silent when Obama was in charge.. and lots of Africans were murdered by authorities..but nothing said
this is so cringey....haha im laughing so much. what an idiot. this seems like an SNL skit at first. man this dude sucks now.
Shut the hell up you dont know what your talking about your a dumb ass
You're one liners about Bill and Bush are 100 times better than this slam poetry set in a closed parking garage.\n\nFrom the voice of the working people to the mouth peace of the elites.\n\nLol dichotomies. So either you stand with us or you stand with the terrorists, got it.
Another white rapper using the emotions of slavery to make himself look good by fighting it,shit what about d12 hes got plaqs and they got shit,i guess im wrong whiles he's a king one got a hit.a shell...of the old him aka tired of the same bullspit.
SLIM ANUS IS TAKING FEMALE HORMONES HE LOOKS IDENTICAL TO RACHEL DRATCH AS DEBBIE DOWNER.
THIS SHIT IS WEAK AF. WHAT A DEGENERATE WIGGER
Eminem can't say shit about gun reform for Nevada because all he raps about is gun violence.
How is this cringy? He's coming up with it on the spot. I mean, yeah, politics is notoriously bad for publicity but this was actually some decent shit off the cuff.
I prefer the more technical raps of Eminem, this one isn't one of his greatest. This will lose Eminem a lot of his fans. You can see by the dislike button, Trump said what he wanted to do and people voted for it. The majority of people like him.
Over all Donald Trump is still president 😂
marshall is pissed. i feel you, brother.
Geez, women 15 years ago, when Em was relevant, weren't dick riding as hard as the fanboys here. Lmao
Only he can get away with this. \n\nHonestly don't know if he actually thinks this way, the way his older songs sound, you don't even know..
Wow 175k dislikes from Trump supporters lol 😂
cool hade Trumps
Check out Steven Crowder's parody everyone! https://youtu.be/NrdT1rEO54c
I Hope Trump gets murdered
Legalize marijuana !!

Trump Supporters listen..\n\nEminem has dissed Hillary too, listen to Role Model... he also dissed Bernie Sanders and calling him old and shit..
Da fuq is this?
Is this supposed to be art?
f u  i am done w u
out of breath af
Oh Marshall...Marshall buddy what happened to you? You were one of the greats, I remember listening to your music as a kid and grew to respect both your funny and serious work. You were once against the establishment, but now you are their machine. \n\n(I know he's not actually reading this and for the record, I don't care much for Trump or politics for that matter)
cheap heat corny shiiiiit
Trump supporters mad lol
2:57 😁😁😁👌👌👌
I so appreciate the more natural lighting, Nic.  I think many of us feel alienated when we watch videos where the person's skin texture is totally bleached out.  You still look absolutely gorgeous, but you look human.  Beautifully so. X
Pray the rosary everyday and quit the vanities of the world, because the world is passing away and the life of the soul is what is everlasting
love your take on makeup. told myself I wouldn't watch anymore fenty reviews but had to watch yours because I knew you would have a unique stance
Love you and your videos!! Would love to see you do a Bobbi Brown review xx
I love that she didn't just gush over Rihanna for being Rihanna. I'd like to try the matchsticks!!
I watched this feeling like I learnt so many new things!
I LOVE the lighting here!! I am so tired of overly bright videos that everyone else does. xx :)
Jesus Christ, that’s horrible 😂 She looks absolutely fine, but that over the top makeup is just too much. Sorry guys, but is it just me?
Really like the Brand reviews n seeing all the products used
You should do a review on Jeffree Star cosmetics! The brands Vegan I believe and available on Beauty Bay
Her hairline goes way back like the 1980's
The lighting was so much better in this video! :)\n\nAlso great review :) x
Best review of Fenty I've seen! Love the unique ways you used the products.
I'm obsessed with this look, stunning make up as always. ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
Hi Nic - I know you ladies tend to review/use more high end brands (not a criticism) but I was wondering if you would review the Primark range. X
Eeeeeeeeeeeek. So jealous jealous jealous. I ,over her products. U look absolutely stunning. I loooooooved the eye makeup.the stick blush kinda thing and  the lip gloss. But all too expensive. But absolutely amazing makeup . Absolutely love u nic. ❤️❤️💕💕💕💋💋💋💋🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Love the lipgloss and the eye colours, however am not a huge fan of the base xx
Nic could you do a Fall/Autumn makeup routine video 😙 Love your videos!!
I would love to see a review on Kjaer Weis or RMS Beauty! xx
please review the ordinary serum and coverage foundations!
You girls are beautiful inside & out.
To me the foundation matches your skin tho
I got the gloss and it just looks like clear gloss on me. The pretty color...disappears.😢
honoring the men in makeup too! Thanks Nic so much, this means so much to someone like me. much love from Orlando! xoxo
This is my favorite review of this brand!
one of the most adventurous full fenty beauty looks i've seen! i think the glowy, natural-looking look most people create with these products are lovely, but you really used her products in the versatile way that rihanna wanted. and you did it really well!
love
I have always loved you!!! Been a subscriber to your channel since your PixiCut hair days! But I love more how excited you get when you show in the products that would look great for darker skin. ❤️
I have to be honest, the contour looked very muddy! Maybe it was because of the lighting? Other than that, the cheeks and eyes looked gorgeous
its 2k 17 \ni cant recognize humans any more
Wasn't she menta shake the foundation first
I wanted to comment on how this has been the best review of the Fenty Beauty line, but everybody has already said it. This is why I've trusted Sam and Nic for years now. Their videos are so informative that they have helped me pick which MAC, Estee Lauder, and Clinique foundations would suit my skin type. Moreover, their reviews are so positive, it's always pleasing to watch them.
I wanted to love the foundation but it sank right into my pores with and without a primer. Good thing I only got a sample.
Would love a review on jefree star products. Thanks x
Out of all the Fenty Beauty reviews I have seen... I feel you were the most honest and transparent... but you guys always are.  💟  This was super informative... Thank u.  Well done!!
Love what you did here 🙌🏼❤️❤️ showing the versatile usage really helped me 😊
I think it's great that you did a full face using the highlighters as eyeshadow! Clever!
Love that you used Trophy Wife as an eyeshadow, and not a highlighter like other light skinned girls have done on Youtube.
Love this look so much!! 👌🏼
Would be great if you did an update skin care video. ☺
Any time you like something I just want to run out and buy it haha! I would love to see you review an affordable brand like Sleek or Nyx please, for those of us who need to rely on cheaper products most of the time...
What colour foundation did you go for Nic?
I love the look you did with it. I haven't seen anyone else use the highlighters as eyeshadow or lipstick
I like the way you do makeup - I don't understand contouring the forehead though.  It just looks like everyone has a dirty forehead.  You don't of course.
The foundation made me break out in little red spots (not pimples/active acne, almost like an allergic reaction as opposed to a breakout) but I really liked the way it looks when mixed with a luminous foundation for my dry skin - I used Koh Gen Do Aqua and the two seemed to play nicely together. If anyone's bought the foundation but has dry skin and finds it isn't working but also own a liquidy dewy foundation try mixing the two!
I have really dry skin and the formulas just did not work for me. I got the foundation as soon as it was released because of the color selection. I have a strong yellow undertone that is hard for me to match. The foundation and primer just made my skin look even dryer. I looked like I had more texture then I actually have.
Celebrity make up . I shall pass
Please review Le Mètier de Beautè. I am very curious on your feedback for a high end brand.
Thank you for always including us darker skin girls in your reviews and recommendations.
I'd like to see a tutorial on Pat McGrath's new eyeshadow palettes.
Fantastic review Nic! Always enjoy listening to your honest thoughts and loved the look💗
Looks great nic.  Would love your opinion on Glossier.
I love but please cut down on the Botox your eyebrows didn't move the whole video!
Could you do a nyx review/tutorial.  I have not used there stuff but have heard good things about it. Also I have extremely pale skin with really dark under eyes. What would you do with that as I have never found a concealer good enough? I love your video. I like how real you are. Keep it up.
This is by far the best review of Fenty Beauty that I have seen so far. 👏🏼
I wasn't sure when I saw it at Sephora last week, but now I want absolutely everything in this range! My poor, poor bank account! lol Thanks for the review, Nic!
Thanks for the review Nic, I love how you showed the versatility of the products unlike the rest of the video reviews.
You're 37 ?! Wow, that's goals aha x
Great review,\nCould you review the Claudia Schiffer’s ?\nThx
This video showed me how much lighting & editing make a difference in makeup videos....the line doesnt seem that great without heavy editing?
I would love to see a review of the new Pat McGrath Labs shadows and liners!
aw I love how you have Tanyas  Burr\ns book in the background
Just started watching you! You are lovely x I am 37 also. I really enjoyed this review. I learnt so much thank you 💕
Hi Nic, nice Fenty Beauty review!\nSince you asked, would you please consider reviewing Kjaer Weis products?\nThanks a lot and keep up the good work,\nEve from France
I really like the look of the blotting powder. can it be used as a setting powder?
absolutely love you so much!
Brilliant video. Would love you to review the new Bobbi Brown exclusive to selfridges sparkle palette. X
a glossier video would be amazing seeing as they just started shipping in the UK!!✨
You made these products look fantastic on dry skin. I’m returning the foundation. It settled into my fine lines and dry patches.
Glossier! I would love a review of that.
Such a pretty look!  Great tutorial!
I love how you used the shimmer sticks and powder highlighters on your eyes, the finished result is stunning! X
Very nice review, as usual! But I think the ones you called eyeshaddows are not eyeshaddows but highlighters.. obviously you can wear them as a eyesahddows as well but just saying :)
I would love to see the NARS Man Ray collection reviewed! :)
I love how even in low light you can see that Nic has really beautiful and well taken care of skin, not just throwing some moisturizer on like most gurus who sctually have awful skin without their 1000 watt, full coverage and filter trickery.
Do NYX!!!!!
https://xn--g0haaaaaaaaaaaa.gq/r/?S8RGoh0KMu3rc=2vFo3i3TaO8ncJnMThxLOBU1zJLSdN76moJ
I thought you said 'ginger minge' 😂😂
CT please!!
Best review so far
Do you still use Lilash?
https://youtubem.video/r/?81a5Hu5lwHMcBBZO0n4D=po3s5A6UHT4kTbTq6gDqUFT8EJjTpN66faO
Best tutorial of fenty beauty. Thanks Nic
that finishing powder.... wow!
NARS would be great! Please please!
Please review Milani
Love your makeup looks, but could you do more makeup looks on brown eyes please! Your eyes stand out a lot with makeup especially because they're light, it takes effort to choose a natural/ish look for brown eyes. Kim Kardashian does this beautifully at the moment, but I can't seem to create the look or pick the right shades. Would love a video on that. Thank you! <3
Love the lighting
What moisturiser did you use?
37??? you look great!
Your right side looks fantastic!
Please review Dolce & Gabbana makeup! Thank you!
while tension male wbrozx conviction seemingly fish touch start overall.
Omg this makeup is so gorgeous 😍
Full Tom Ford makeup tutorial?
Great lightning!
You knew you’d be applauded for making special mention of men and makeup. Nothing is stopping men from wearing makeup. I came here like most, to relax and watch a makeup tutorial. Instead it’s like everywhere else you turn- politically charged and obsessed with political correctness at every point where it can be mentioned.
Would love to know what you think about the new Nars Luminous weightless foundation and how best to apply it!
lighting is a little bit dark!
Please share your experiences/relationship with alcohol in the comments section below, we'll both be reading them all! xxx
thank you so much girls for talking about such a sensitive subject 💓x
I never had a drinking problem and the only few times I ever got tipsy was when I just wanted to see what it felt like or because I felt pressured to drink because of other people. But when I get tipsy I always get pretty down and tired. In Germany you can legally drink with 16 and you are able to buy stronger liquor with 18. But I have seen and heard of 12-13 year old kids drinking and I personally got tipsy for the first time with 14. I never thought of drinking in relation to culture, but since we have the Oktoberfest it probably seems to be rooted in our culture.
If I go out with the intent on drinking, I'll go for beer most of the time. I do enjoy vodka and rum too. Not together obviously lol. I have never been drunk in my life. My brother has a dependency on alcohol so after growing up seeing what being drunk did to him, it made me realize I never wanted to feel or be like that. We've tried several different ways to help him. None have worked. Guess you can't help someone if they don't wanna be helped.
First id like to say I love your videos! Im 22 and live in the US. I usually drink maybe one shot of chilled cinnamon whiskey or gold schlager a year maybe...usually around my birthday. My parents always were very open with alcohol around my sister and I. We learned about it early on and how to to be responsible while drinking. I tend to not drink though because when I have drank before my negative emotions came out worse. For example if I was sad the sadness just became more apparent after a little bit of alcohol.
Thanks so much for sharing your experiences! It was really interesting to me, as a teenager who gets a lot of these talks from school and has friends who I know are partying and drinking a lot.\n\nI'm 17 living in California. I'm from a family that discourages drinking, plus my mother and older sisters hate the taste of alcohol. Because of this, I've always been the goody-2-shoes who never drinks. I've mostly been okay with that, until now. I don't always want to be afraid of drinking and never try drinking at all because I'm afraid to get too drunk or binge drink or something. I think I have a healthy relationship with alcohol because I'm so aware of all of this stuff, and I have supportive people in my life. Also, I would never hide my alcohol usage. I would tell my parents, even if they weren't happy with it, and I think that's what matters. So now I want to allow myself to be free and have drinks with friends because I trust myself and the people around me to be aware of how I'm using alcohol and keep it safe and healthy.
I'm not a big drinker really and not bothered about the taste, but if I don't choose alcohol people sometimes get uncomfortable as if I'm therefore judging them.\n\nUK is the exact same. UK and Ireland are the binge drinking capitals of Europe I'm sure. I started drinking at 17.5 and that was LATE. My siblings have all started at about 14.
Us in Scotland have a massive drink  problem too. I am the same as Jess. I drank most at 17 to 18. Now 22 I rarely drink. Drunk stories are funny and scary but it's good to get it out of your system so then you can respect alcohol :).
Im from the uk where binge drinking is also a pretty big problem. I like to drink mainly socially but i know i also have a bad relationship with it where i'll drink on my own in my room because im depressed. So it fluctuates
Le me say this.. I enjoy watching beautiful creatures talking non-stop
I don't drink it makes me so sick straight away not tipsy just so poorly! So just don't bother but I would like to be able to enjoy a few! I think I got out of lots of drink between 16-20 from the sickness the morning after too I would throw up all day long! Xxx
This video came in the right time
I rarely drink now but when I was much younger (14-17) I would drink so much and I think that's why now I just would rather not get drunk. Sometimes I do but as I started drinking so young it's completely put me off 👌🏼
I actually basically don't drink much at all,  when I was younger sure there was a drinking culture when was a teenager in the 80's so its been in OZ for a very long time, I stopped most of my drinking when I had my Kids and Believe it or not lost the taste for alcohol.  I am also a Muso so drinking is pretty standard in my world, however i choose not to drink and don't care what anyone else think.  I also think our drink driving laws in QLD have made a difference to some people as well,  as far as their drinking habits, more people drink before they go out now.   alcohol is expensive and I rather spend my money on other stuff.
Jess your makeup is beautiful. Brings out your natural beauty
The one on the left = ♨️
I feel like binge drinking is a massive issue in UK university culture. In my first year at uni I drank far too much for my size to try and keep up with all the guys around me and to overcome shyness. What made that worse was that I never ate before I drank. \nAlcohol itself causes your blood sugar levels to drop, and as mine were already low I experienced symptoms of Hypoglycaemia - aggression, confusion, personality change, pale skin and I would have mornings where I would wake up with no memory of even leaving home and drinking at all...\nThe complete lack of memory is the scariest part. For that reason, I've given up drinking - because unfortunately I know that Im still not in the right mental state to have full control over it and maintain a level of moderation.
How much is a pint of beer in Ireland? Just out of curiosity because yous mention it's so expensive
This is amazing. Thank you so much for talking about this!!! Also, all I want is to be your friends!!!!
I'm currently in college and drinks are as cheap as €3 for a double vodka!
what do you think of changing he legal age to 16? do you think it would benefit irish teens in a way that they would be safer with it or do you think it would have the opposite effect?
Hi to both of you,\n\nI personally think that the reason countries in the northern hemisphere particularly in Europe drink more because going back a few hundreds years, I believe that we would drink to keep ourselves warm and with English pub history, men would go to work all day (wives at home), then go to the local public house to relax before going home for tea. It's how it was in those days.\n\nFrom my own experience of drinking in England and in a hot country, I could drink the same amount or more but feel in control of myself in a warm country whereas in England, I'd feel ready for home. I think this links between the different environments, haven't quite sussed out the reasoning behind it but there is my theory. \n\nHope this makes sense...\n\nHazel
I think Germany is almost the same (but I also think I don't even have to say that because Germany is pretty popular for their beer and the Oktoberfest and stuff haha) with the drinking, its starts at a really young age, you are allowed beer and wine at the age of 16 and harder drinks at 18 but to be honest loads and loads of young people already drink with 14 (one girl had to get picked up from a halloween party in school when we were like 13 because she had alcohol poisoning!) So yeah, it is pretty bad over here as well but I have to say I grew up in a small village and was never really interested, I never really went clubbing before (I am 19) because I feel uncomfortable around a bunch of strangers being drunk. The only thing I really enjoyed was back when I lived  in Ireland when you go out with a few friends and drink a few drinks, I tend to get sick quite easily but if I drink I LOVE baileys or cider (one of them is called orchard right) ! But else I don't really drink, even when it is very common here in Germany and a huge social thing, if you go out on a weekend you get massively drunk and tell your friends the monday after how fun it was to be that drink (or at least all my classmates do haha)
I'm from the north of England and I feel like the drinking culture here in the UK is pretty much the same as what you've described in Ireland. It here is also a part of the culture, it's a lot more rare to find people who don't drink in my opinion. :p
I'm of Irish heritage in the US (I'm a McD.). I remember as a kid seeing the stereotype of the drunk Irishman and how stupid he was. I went the opposite way. I only have drinks on my birthday (usually 2 margaritas) and none the rest of the year. It's actually really easy to do if you have the right friends. Great video, Melanie and Jessie!
I’m from Australia and there is a huge drinking culture down here. If you are aged between 15-25 and don’t centre your weekends around binge drinking “you aren’t having fun”. It’s even more prevalent in 18-25,  especially at uni. I don’t like who I turn into when I drink so I stopped at 22. Have felt so much better since.
my biological dad was an alcoholic and even though I havent lived with him since I was 2 I think it's still ingrained in my memory somehow. Ive never been one to drink, Ive gotten tipsy once (I was about 19 at the time). However I can't drink a lot as Ive got epilepsy and drinking too much can trigger them. there is not a lot of drinks I like/will drink but I have started to have a drink now and again, mainly if I go out for a meal or if we have a special occasion, so I feel I have quite a healthy relationship to alcohol in comparison to the majority of people my age (I'm 23)
i rarely drink but when i do it's small amounts with family around the holidays
I'm 15 in the suburbs near chicago in the U.S. I have never drank. my friends don't want to, and neither do I. some people at my school do have drinking parties and shit like that. It just depends on who you are and who you're friends with. There's 2,600 students at my school, so it makes sense why our culture is so varied.
I only drink to savor the flavors. I've never got drunk before. I love nicely brewed beer, tasty wine.... One of my favorites is umeshu (Japanese plum wine).
We definitely have issues with alcoholism here in America. think part of it is the up bringing. Here in the states you can't drink until you're 21 (legally) so most people do a lot of binge drinking when they're young because they aren't 'taught' to drink they're sneaking it. Then another part is maybe the attitude of work and play... Americans are still pretty concerned with 'the American dream most working crazy long stressful days. So to unwind they maybe have a few at the end of the day. So now you drink to relax and have fun. Happy? Drink. Sad? Drink. It's Tuesday? Bottoms up.
The Portuguese have a very similar culture of drinking. The stereotypes are old drunk farmers.\nIn Canada though, the legal age is 19 and places are STRICT about this. \nMy first drink was when I was 14 and from then on I would drink and get plastered at parties occasionally.\nI grew up in a house where my dad was an alcoholic and because of that, I don't have a very good relationship with alcohol. My mom has been afraid I'll be more inclined to that behaviour. I have a low tolerance and I try to stay away from alcohol when I'm sad or lonely because I don't want to indulge those feelings with something that can really harm me. My friends binge drink a lot and I actually had a discussion with a few of them and it's scary. \nWhat were you parents like about you both drinking?
1) U BOTH LOOK HOT\n2) NO REALLY SO HOT\n3) THIS IS IMPORTANT
I LOVE HOW YOUTUBE KEEP PUTTING YOU AND LUCY INTO TRENDING OMG YAS QUEENS YAS
Melanie, your hair is the epitome of Autumn. I love it!
i come from a family of alcoholics and can honestly say that this is so important and an excellent video- thank you guys for being honest about the effects alcohol dependence can have and these issues!
Why do you drink in the first place if you believe it harms you?
I am from Spain. We start drinking early, my first drink was when I was 13. I have drank a lot in my life, I am 30 now, but this year I have started to quit. I would have maybe two or three beers when I go out but that's it. I can't deal with the shame, the anxiety and the hungover anymore. But the pressure even from friends is huge.
I started drinking just before I was 16 and that was 100% my choice. Like a lot of people have said in Australia we have such a similar situation with alcohol where there are 15 year olds getting drunk and tbh it’s not right in a way but it all comes down to the person, if they want to get drunk at 15 they can have that choice to do it
Not even on my 21st birthday did I drink. I've never had alcohol and don't really plan to. I'm just not interested. What bothers me is how people react when you simply don't drink. Its like people need a reason as to why you don't. I remember going to a bonfire when I was 18 with my new college classmates. One of the girls I was hanging out with asked me if I wanted a drink. I told her no, I didnt drink. When she asked why, I told her, My uncle had liver failure when I was 15. It put me off alcohol. She said she respected that but proceeded to go on about how she thought people that don't drink for no reason are f***ing losers. My uncle did have liver failure but I hate that I feel compelled to use that to get people to leave me alone about alcohol. Alcohol is a personal choice. Drink if you want to, don't drink if you don't want to. Lets respect everyone's choice :) love this series. Love you Mel. Love you Jess 💚💚💚
I'm from Germany and I started drinking and binge drinking with 14. I don't know why, I think I just wanted to distract myself from my problems. I am 16 now and I actually don't drink that much anymore but I still can't control myself when it comes to drugs. I wish people would talk more openly about drug abuse instead of romanticizing it
I just saw this vid and its funny because i have been hanging all day because last night I went to a party and normally im not that bad drunk but i was sloppy and kissing people i shouldn't have and alcohol is such a depressant for me and raises anxiety so much that i was crying in a car park for over an hour... but i kind of know my limit but all my friends were drinking loads so i did and its so unhealthy :(
Both looks so good in this!! The natural makeup looks so amazing on Jess!😍
I rarely ever drink only on occasions. I like being in control of myself haha I get drunk so easily too 😂😂
Thank you for talking about this, my mom passed away this year due to an alcohol addiction so I've never really had a good relationship with alcohol. I've done all the things you've said; been out binge drinking then not remembering then things I'd done then next day. Moms addiction made me see alcohol in a different light, it went on for over ten years and destroyed her life. It can be so dangerous! I would never tell people not to drink as I still drink every now and then (not currently cos I'm pregnant!) but my eyes are so open to the dangers xoxo
I didn't start drinking until I was 19 due to both my parents having somewhat unhealthy relationships with alcohol as I was growing up, and I think I'm glad I waited. I'm from the US but studied at a uni in the UK for a year and also worked in a pub after and personally enjoyed the binge drinking culture. Not that I think it's positive overall, but for me I knew I didn't like the idea of drinking everyday and letting it become habitual, but having one night every couple of weeks when my friends and I would get kinda messy was actually really cathartic for me (I can be pretty anxious otherwise) and there were only a few times that I ever regretted it. Fortunately I'v never turned to alcohol as an escape, and I can see how those habits plus a heavy drinking culture can be a harmful combo. Now I'm back in the US I very rarely drink. I feel there's much more judgement around it here, like people are quick to hand you a beer but also quick to tell you that you're too drunk and should be ashamed a few hours later (not so much from personal experience as observations of others). Plus you have to drive everywhere, and I'm small enough that even one strong drink could put me over, which really limits options for social drinking.
Where is Jessie's top from? It is absolutely adorable !💛
The reason why these bad things happen when you drink alcohol, is because it's a warning, God doesn't want you to drink it! Well why did He create it then? To test you, what do you love more? Him or the demon drink?
I rarely drink, but I usually only have fun and am in control of myself at all times so I think I'm okay :-) However in my teens I think I really had a problem... In school, I remember all I could think of was the next party and the next time I would get to drink... It was bad, and also dangerous! I'm glad I met someone who hated drinking at the time. They distracted me away from it. I'm very thankful about that :-)
Tbh, I think in Spain we have a very close drinking culture and we definitely binge drink while being young. Like you said, alcohol here it's quite cheap and accesible and it's common for very young people to start drinking and even binge drinking. Also since we party until so late in the morning, i feel like we drink more to stay high all night and it can get pretty unhealthy easily. I feel like a lot of us can't party without drinking (or withouth getting drunk) and it's a bit dangerous.
I sort of disagree with what you were saying about spanish drinking culture, amongst teenagers at least, it's really bad. I am a teenager in southern spain. The alcohol is so cheap and basically everywhere will serve people who are very underage. I have been served since I was 13 years old in shops,pubs, clubs etc. I know lots of teenagers who have issues with drinking. Including myself, I had a terrible year when I was just 15 where I was binge drinking heavily and I wouldn't remember any of the stupid terrible things I had done. I have noticed though that it is mostly us foreign kids, British, Russian, American etc who have the issues and not the spanish which is interesting... People here as young as twelve go out drinking and when it gets to the age of about 14/15 everyone in the year group starts going out, it's ridiculous honestly.
I'm Dutch, 23 years old. I've never had a bad relationship with alcohol, but I know teenagers are still drinking up to a point that they get into a coma. Some real alcohol-poisoning...\nI myself rarely drink and when I drink, I don't drink a lot. I drink because I like the taste of some alcoholic drinks, not to get drunk or tipsy. I usually drink no more than about 4 glasses of alcohol on an evening and I like to mix it up with regular drinks in between.
I don't drink alcohol at all these days - less than one drink a week. I had to stop completely two years ago (back injury - painkillers that react badly with alcohol) - but even back at university, I tended not to drink much normally. There was the occasional night of heavy drinking, of course, and a night or two I regret now, but I don't think I'll ever drink that way again.
I'm 17 and from Greece, although I was born in England and have also lived in Ireland and in my opinion what contributes to all this binge drinking in the U.K. and Ireland is the taboo that surrounds alcohol and peoples attitudes towards it. Like, in Mediterranean countries alcohol really isn't a big deal and children are exposed to it from a young age, usually through their parents/grandparents. My parents always let me taste their drinks and we talked open.y about drinking and so now, most of my friends and cousins who come from similar backgrounds mainly just have a drink or two when we go out to bars and get maybe tipsy at parties, just bc they like the taste (I don't drink). Also where I live now, in Cyprus, he drinking age is 17 but anyone at any age can pretty much buy alcohol and be served at bars and it's not an issue and I think that's a good thing bc teenagers will drink anyway might as well do it responsibly and in a chill way
Jessica looks so much like Amanda Peet in Something's Gotta Give. If you look up that movie and see pics of Amanda Peet in it let me know if you agree lol
I’m from Slovakia, alcohol is very cheap around here and almost everybody drinks so so much. It’s just normal. Nobody thinks it’s unhealthy and I just don’t like it. We shouldn’t have this as a norm.\nSaying that I do/did have an unhealthy relationships with alcohol. I started very young around 11/12 and I was binge drinking cheap hard liquor few times a week to run away from depression than I thankfully got treated and got drunk only once in a while in parties and the I stopped all together for a while. Now I only drink wine most of the time, i’ll have a glass with dinner or get tipsy but that’s it. Saying that I know I’m lot more sociable person when drinking and that’s why I often drink when in uncomfortable situations. I get a lot more friendly, happy and communicative..
I drink but only occasionally and when I do it's in a chill environment at my house or with my friends eating a meal. The last time i drank was about 3 weeks ago and before then maybe a month. I'm also quite a lightweight so the most I'll ever drink is 2. Another reason I don't drink often is mostly because of price so when I buy myself alcohol it's easier to get whatever wine I like at the grocery store that's on discount. however, when I've traveled to other countries I drank more often because it was part of the culture and much more chill and normalized than here in the states.
From England (but Irish family) and my bad years were 15/16 maybe 18 but now I never drink. 21 and have not been drunk in years!
Thank you so much for this video Mel. Looking back, when I was 17/18 I had such an awful relationship with drink. I'm only after realizing that after watching this video. For me, it was because of a bad break up aswell. I just had it in my head that I needed to go out and get locked and have 'fun' to make it seem like I wasn't hurting. I didn't want to come across weak so I wouldn't miss a single party. I would drink a 70cl (nearly a liter) of Lidl vodka at house parties and I got alcohol poisoning a couple of times. I would also mix this with taking drugs/smoking weed. It was so unhealthy and like the girls, I put myself in some extremely dangerous situations. Today, I still love a drink but do it very rarely, once every couple months probably, and stay far away from drugs. I'll never go back to that place, it was an awful time and really enhanced the symptoms of depression and anxiety I was feeling at the time. If alcohol wasn't such a huge part of Irish culture, I would probably give it up all together.
i think the drinking culture in england is much the same--especially at university age. i basically don't drink at all, i don't like the taste of it and i rarely feel safe drinking it in a party situation. but i don't think i'd be wrong when i say the majority of university students have a drinking problem. i've watched people move in first year, acting like childish sixth formers, going out every. single. night. and come year three, they're still doing the exact same thing, and surviving on no sleep so they can still pass their classes. i genuinely think a lot of people our age feel like to have a good time you need to drink, not just drink, but do it to excess. it's literally all they talk about. and people are so cruel and pressurising about it--myself and my flatmates were having a game night where we played cards, had a small amount of alcohol each but not drunk, and had a laugh. a friend of theirs dropped by, and they introduced a debilitating drinking game which meant consuming an ungodly amount as quickly as possible, and i felt so uncomfortable. i remember saying 'i'm just gonna drink water' for the challenge of 'downing your whole glass if you lose this round' kinda deal. their response was 'no you HAVE to drink'.... of course i didn't cus fuck that, but see what i mean? it kinda destroyed the night for me and became quite depressing living in constant fear that i might intake too much. if the behaviour of young students in britain were seen in middle aged adults, it would no doubt be alcoholism, so why is it so passable when we're young when it negatively affects you just as much?
I live in Portugal and the drinking culture is quite different from Ireland. I would say most people drink, but few binge drink. Most adults have one or two glasses of wine or beer at dinner but no more than that, maybe a gin or whiskey in a speacial occasion. For us teens though, it's so easy to get alcoholic drinks, almost everyone from 14 up does it. Bars sell drinks to anyone, no IDs requested, no question asked. So a lot of us start drinking early and at 17/18, you're an exception if you haven't already been drunk/binge drink.
The legal drinking age where I live is 14 with parental supervision and 16 for everything expect liquors. I started drinking when I was 15 but that was just on some parties and I didn't drink much. I rarely drink at all now just when I go out with friends I'll have a few drinks but in my friend group it isn't common to drink a lot so we can also just go out and not drink anything. Also I feel it when I start getting tipsy and then I'll just stop drinking and drink some water...
I'm 26 and I moved to England three years ago. I'm from France and before moving here, I had never touched a drink, never. I started drinking here as I felt completely out of place when going out with people. Over time though, I didn't feel pressured anymore however I would keep binge drinking because I just can't face the idea of socialising sober. I got very drunk last night not because I enjoy it but because I'm way too anxious to be around people without it. I don't find it fun to poison myself but I have to if I don't want to stay isolated at home.
I'm an Irish 22 year old and I've never had a drop of alcohol and I don't plan to. I hate it when I meet people on a night out and they ask what I'm drinking and I say a coke or something they automatically assume that either A) I'm pregnant (which I'm not) or B) that I used to have a drinking problem (which I haven't). When I tell them that I've never had alcohol they all go Fair play to ya or they look at me like I've got ten heads! Last year I was out with my older brother and his friends at his birthday party in a pub/nightclub in Dublin and when I told when of his friends that I don't drink he literally started to question me for the next 45 MINUTES! He was in shock that I never had some cider down the park when I was younger. Also, as a student living away from home for the first time in a different city, I find that I'm not invited out with my friends from college because they automatically assume that I don't like pubs or clubbing. I'm half Irish, half English I LOVE going down to the pub and having the laugh with my friends! Just because I don't drink doesn't mean that I don't like going out with friends on a night out. I find it really sad that we have such a big alcohol problem in Ireland and no, neither of my parents are alcoholics. The reason why I choose not to drink is A) It's WAAAY to expensive! I'm a broke ass college student! B) I don't need it to have fun. Also I'd like to say that no, I don't shame my friends for drinking or anything like that. If they want to drink, let them drink! Rant over.
When I was younger I thought the German drinking culture was bad...then I spend some time at a British Uni and now I think differently. I know people who sometimes get quite drunk, but not too many. I rarely drink. When I do it is usually a drink or two at a bar with friends, very rarely I get a bit tipsy before going out. I like the taste of some alcoholic beverages, especially cocktails, but I also get a bit sick of the taste quite quickly, so drinking a lot wouldn't be easy for me anyway. I also never felt the need to. Most of my good friends don't drink that much and even if I am at a party where people are drinking, I just stop when I feel like I don't want to drink anymore. It is sad that you then sometimes have to justify yourself for not drinking. I also find it shocking when I hear people as young as 18 say that it would be a challenge for them to abstain from drinking for a month. I really have nothing against a bit of social drinking, but I find it disconcerting how something as harmful as alcohol plays such a big role in society.
I live in portugal (which is in the top 20 countries with the most alcohol consumption; legal drinking age - 18)  and I am 16. I can't even count how many times I've gotten  like really fucking drunk. Around my circles of friends it's pretty normal. I've bought alcohol as a 15 year old. It is not allowed but I did it in a self-service place and loads of more local/small shops sell you if you don't look too young, without carding ya. My father incourages me to drink (not the way I do), but since I was little he'd let me drink from his glass. I don't think that had to do with how I came to drink more heavily but idk just thought i'd share that. It´s not just drinking, I don't think I've gone to a party where there wasn't any weed and some other shit. Everytime we're going out it's always with the minset of like let's get fucked. BUT besides that I don't really drink by myself, I don't really feel the need to. And I've never got drunk to solve any problems, it's always been in good fun, I guess. Plus I somehow have never gotten a bad hangover and haven't had any too bad experiences with it, so it has never been a problem for me. the worst that's happened was not enjoying the party cause I was passed out. \n(We mostly drink vodka but anything will do really, also alcohol is really cheap  €6 for a bottle of vodka black for example.)
I'm 15 and have never had any alcohol (other than a glass of prosecco sometimes at family dinners), and have been in quite a few situations where most people are drinking but me. As I have a lot of friends who are older than me (around 18-20), I am generally one of the only ones who is sober. I don't mind not being drunk but I do feel a bit left out, although I've never really had the urge to drink.
in sweden binge drinking is also prevalent. like, we don't drink during the week but then on the weekends and holidays p much everyone drinks. the socialising culture is centered around drinking much, but at least it is a bit more restrictive in stores and like i started drinking at 16 and i think that's pretty common.
Great video by the way. Generally hearing about hangovers reminds me of shitty times but this video was spot on. Keep it up!
I am a 19 year old Irish person and I don't drink; I am the only person that I know of my age that doesn't  (except one friend for healthy reasons, she can't). Primarily because of the fear of it leading to alcoholism because that is such a strong feature in Irish culture and in my family in particular, so I have avoided it. I also have just never been that interested in it and have always seen only the bad from it and heard bad about it from people who continuously drink heavily. I feel I don't need it either though because I experience that feeling of a buzz just from the energy of others like ye were talking about, I get in the spirit of drunk but feel that I do not need alcohol to assist me to get there.
Its ridiculous the drinking culture in ireland, but im studying in denmark at the moment and its similar here!! But i do think its also a student thing, so much pressure to drink every week. Also id be the same, wouldnt see the point in having only one drink, just so used to just drinking to get drunk which i think is the same for a lot of people in ireland, the goal is to get so drunk
Theres no pressure to drink here in Cyprus but everyone 13+ does it anw because drinks are so easy to buy, no one asks for an ID, they just ask for your age SOMETIMES (and you can say the truth and even then not really care) and when you're out whether it be a normal weekend outing or a party everyone has a drink on them anw. Theres no reason why u cant is what im saying.
New Zealand has a similar issue with a v strong youth binge drinking problem, as well as social drinking being so common place. It's normal now to go out into town (in akl and wellington at least) and see teens absolutely smashed and staggering about. Also seeing how dependent people can be on it, has definitely made me aware of the dangers, and i make a concerted effort to not drink everytime i go out, like opting for a L/L/B instead! Solid video!! :))
New Zealand has a real bad binge drinking culture, there is also a lot of pressure to be drinking, especially in your teens and twenties
Here in Australia we have a pretty big drinking culture, its not uncommon for young people to go out a few times per week.  I used to go out all the time but I found that it doesn't make me feel good and I end up wasting a lot of money on a night out.  For a little while I did prioritize going out over university which is obviously not the smartest thing in the world.  So now I try not to go out as often and save it for birthdays and other celebrations which I find makes it more enjoyable rather than going out every weekend.
My dad was a serious alcoholic until the day he died, my brother is an alcoholic (but won't admit it) and my abusive ex was a heavy drinker. So I don't have a good relationship with it and have always hated how society and Australian culture portrays alcohol. I used to drink socially anyway cause I felt so pressured to (I started at 14! Stopped drinking very much after 22 though), but I have stopped drinking altogether for health reasons. It was the best decision for me. Although now I feel so left out, especially as a young queer person, all of the social things for queers surround drinking culture (clubbing, bars, pub nights, etc). I'd be interested to hear you talk about the drinking culture within the queer community, Melanie. Thanks for the great video ladies :)
I’m in Spain studying abroad right now and the coordinators of my program have been telling us that Spanish people frequently drink but you never see them drunk because binge drinking is seen as quite immature. It makes me kind of embarrassed seeing some of the other Americans in my group going out and getting wasted and looking forward to doing it again and again. But to each their own I guess
I was never interested in drinking during my teens. My friends drank, but I didn't like the idea of losing control of my own actions and potentially hurting someone. I also don't think I genuinely trusted them enough - they were so obsessed with the idea of getting the 'sober one' drunk, I wonder what they would've done if I had got drunk with them. I didn't really start drinking until first/second year of uni. I think that was because I finally trusted my friends. I knew that if I got smashed (which rarely happens tbh) they would keep me safe and take me home, and I would do the same for them. Even after that, I very rarely went out and hardly ever got smashed, but I did drink. Now I've just graduated uni and I'm training to teach, so I don't have the time to drink anymore :')
I never drank and I do go out. I see what alcohol does and I really don't want to experience it. What really really bothers me though is how pressing people can be for you to drink when you've been telling them for years that you don't drink. It's very annoying, disrespectful. If you're one of the Come on, you're no fun, have one little glass... Stop, really it feels very isolating
I'm 18 from Sabah which is part of Malaysia (it's a Muslim country) but in my hometown people don't rlly bother about that and usually start drinking around the age of 15-16 and they start going to clubs around that age too (at least for the people in my school which was a private school) I used to drink sooooooo much when I was younger and whenever I got drunk I did the weirdest things haha but one time I drank until I threw up and it was horrible so that put me off drinking like now whenever I even smell alcohol it makes me wanna vomit
I'm Irish and never drank untill I was 21, but even now I have never been drunk I just enjoy the occasional few 😊
I’m 16 and I’ve never drunk, not because I’m against it or never had the chance; just because I’ve just never felt like it. I feel an increasing amount of pressure from my peers to drink, I just don’t think I’m ready yet.
New Zealand 'apparently' has the worst drinking culture in the world.\n So over here drink is like $12 a glass of beer on a night out which is about half the price of a meal. Another reason is because pre mix drinks (that my English friends say taste like lolly water) are being made readily available by their parents. I don't drink a lot as i find it boring to do as i rather play Fifa 18 or chill with my mates.
When I started drinking I drank very little but when I got 16 it became really bad because I had problems and started binge drinking to forget about them and even if I still had a hangover I couldn`t wait till the next party. \nI did some really stupid and dangerous things while drunk because I didn´t care about anything anymore, like walking on the quay wall and jumping out of a window or stuff like that and I got drunk because I really desperately needed to talk to somebody about my problems but couldn´t do so sober. I always drank on an empty stomach like not haven eaten for 12 hours (I ate very little at that time because I was really down). One time at a party I got really really drunk to the point where I was nearly unconscious and they had to call my parents because it was so bad and I didn´t even recognise my own father. On the next day I didn´t even have a hangover because I puked everything out that was in my stomach. \nBut I had a total blackout and could only remember little bits from a certain point on. \nSince then I have been drunk a few times but I don´t drink as often anymore, mostly because I don´t want my friends to have to look after me when I get really depressed and do stupid shit or when I puke and stuff.  I hope I wont get that bad again but at the moment things aren´t really going too well, so I´ll see, but I´ve learned a few things since then.\nI also always get really depressed the day after.\n\nIn Switzerland you can buy beer etc. when you´re 16 and vodka etc. when you´re 18, but of course most people drink the heavier things before they´re 18.\nBinge drinking is also quite common here but it´s also common to just get a bit tipsy or not even that, it really depends on the occasion. In my city it´s also very common to smoke weed. There´s a quay where all the pubs and bars are and if you get there you can always smell the weed XD. It´s not that everyone smokes weed, but a lot of people do it and they don´t really hide it that much (even though it´s illegal). I know people who have an alcohol problem but I also know people who have a problem with weed (like 3 joints a day, which is just too much regularly).\nI think that most people here are generally quite tolerant if someone doesn´t drink but of course there´s still a lot of people who will make stupid comments etc.\n\nI forgot about fairs where after a certain time just everybody is completely smashed. (also about 40ish/50ish adults)
There's 13/12 year olds in my school getting drunk  at party's and drinking in school and I always get weird stares when I get offered a drink and I say no cause I don't want to drink yet X
I'm Spanish and people start drinking also at very young ages and without any control. But once you're an adult I'd say they usually just drink some beers or wine (or whatever) whenever you feel like it?\nI started drinking when I was almost 18 and that's really weird. I wouldn't really go to clubs or anything bc being there from 1 am to 8 am and sober wasn't ideal... At the beginning I just couldn't understand why anyone would drink, but I feel like in the end it was just to make me feel special. And nowadays I drink when I feel like having a beer or when my friends and I meet to have a coffee or so in the evening. I guess I'm just lucky I don't wanna spend my money in alcohol, I hate spirits and I don't enjoy clubs. \nI wouldn't say I've had a problem with alcohol, but when one of my exboyfriends broke up with me (without telling me a clear answer) and his grandma and father died of cancer I went a bit wild. Once I even went to the cemetery to drink and draw... But all I did was really sporadic and just my way to seek for attention and try to keep myself busy. \n\n\nAnd yeah, they say in the northern countries people drink so much more, and that in the south we have more prostitution... 🤷🏿‍♀️\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Beer's amazing. Especially Belgian beer.
Hi :) I'm from belfast,  started drinking at 13/14 a lot, but when I hit 18 I had no interest in it at all, now at 24 I don't drink, maybe the odd cocktail on holidays but that's it! Completely Agree the culture here is crazy!
So glad I can across this video. I've had a bad year with alcohol and it also kicked off with relationships ending. If I have a bad day or feel stressed I do turn to wine and often don't know when to stop. I'll have a glass of wine and then want another, and another and cannot tell what is too much. I also have the same bad relationship with pizza, on bad days I want to buy pizza and have wine but just because I think I will feel better. This video has made me so much more aware of my alcohol consumption and why I turn to drink. Loved this video and you guys are awesome
Watching this before a night out😂
never drank alcohol and don't plan to especially after seen my dad drunk
I'm German :) And we can buy beer with 16 and the hard stuff with 18. Now I know a lot of teens start with 14/15 when they are hanging out with their friends. Some just drink beer while they hang out, some choose like harder stuff. It really depends. For me, I HATED alcohol up until I was 17 I think and I've never really drank I guess. Now, 21, I do drink, a might get drunk here and there but in a moderate manner. But I am a lightweight so I do have to be really careful with the 'let's have a bottle of beer or a glass of wine while we talk'. But yeah. When we have social gatherings we usually pop a few bottles of beer :)
Legal drinking age in Germany starts at 14 for beer, champagne and wine with parental permission.\n16 and up: beer, champagne and wine without parental permission.\n18 and up: all other alcoholic beverages (without parental permission of course)\nOur laws are designed to teach kids and teenagers a healthy approach to alcohol and it works according to the statistics :)\nI started drinking when I was 14 and never had a bad relationship with alcohol. Coming from a small village, I drink quite frequently but alcohol abuse is very uncommon between my friends because we learned from the beginning what influences our body and mind in which way. xx
I find alcohol such a tricky one because I personally can always choose to stop or not drink so I would never say I'd had a problem with it, but, I just love drinking? 😂 especially at uni (I'm in 3rd year) there's just opportunities to binge drink with friends every other bloody night and obviously, it's so unhealthy, but just no one questions it because everyone's getting drunk 3/4 times a week
If you are interested on the differences between Northern European and Mediterranean drinking cultures, you should read 'Social and Cultural Aspects of Drinking' by the Social Issues Research Centre (1998). I wrote an essay on the topic and it is super interesting! Greetings from a Spaniard in England x
I did the bulk of my drinking when I was 15. I would have only a couple of drinks then I would turn into a completely different person. Violent. Angry. The worst part was I couldn’t remember anything I had done past the first few drinks. I made the decision aged 16 not to drink anymore. I’m now 24 and haven’t touched a drop since making that decision. I’m from Wiltshire in the UK.

I am hangover rightnow
In England it's also terrible!! I am 17 now and my friends at my school and even myself started heavily and I mean heavily drinking at 13, every single weekend. I know I'm my self have become very dependent on my self with alcohol, I don't wanna go out at all without it or did when growing up. It does take a massive hold on your life and I wish I wasn't addicted as I am now , but I don't fucking love it at the same time .
I bet Trump will tweet that rap thinking it is in support of him.

This is more entertaining than the real video
Americans are good people. They have no aggressions against us and they like us as we like them. They must know I don't hate them. I love them. I hear it is a complex society inside. Many Americans don't know about the outside world. The majority have no concern and no information about other people. They could not even find Africa on a map. I think Americans are good, but America will be taken over and destroyed from the inside by the Zionist lobby. The Americans do not see this. They are getting decadent. Zionists will use this to destroy them.\n\nAmericans are good people. They have no aggressions against us and they like us as we like them. They must know I don't hate them. I love them.

eminem is a closet fag..its obvious
Funniest thing on Late Show in a while
This new trendin' genre spoken word with a pre-recorded base that's harassin' us since the '90s is gone too far! Now it's even without pre-recorded base, it's just spoken word!
Sometimes I feel bad for Macklemore cause noone says his name right
I don’t know if I’ve enjoyed a literal minute more in the last year. Solid gold
Eminem thinking he's black.
What kind of coops we're those in the background? (to the right specifically)
I have deleted scenes on my channel too :D
You know your terrible when even Rappers feel comfortable mocking you
out of touch middle class, funny

Sorry, had to change it from 666 dislikes.
Aw man, I was expecting them to honk more and Eminem would tell them Fuck You! What a missed opportunity
Eminem being used by Hollywood to distract people from being disgraced by Harvey Weinstein.
All of these idiots saying Trump is unqualified because he hosted the apprentice and now they want an ex-addict washed-up rapper just because he agrees with them...has all logic been lost?
I forgot to do you as an impression. Damn
so now that em bashed Trump, the faggot left is cool with that. Back in the day I remember when Eminem ripped on homosexuals and was against exactly what's he's doing today. you cockroaches will never succeed in life and even after death. the joke is on you useless fucks.
will the real macklemore please stand up please stand up
Is this all YouTube is now, just a lefty, liberal diseased platform?\nThis crap and pointless women, make up video's. \nPlease to all libtards and lefty freaks; paper cut your eye's open ffs.
eminem broke? (((they))) are getting desperate...
Why are those Black gentlemen just staying there? DEAD! 😂😂😂😂
When did Slim become parody of himself!! Edgy stuff LOL
Watch Trump tweet  loser eminem is failing and he has low ratings.
Who's Macklemore? Never heard of him.
Im really glad that guy is working for Colbert. He was one of my favorites on Conan
I have no clue what I just watched.
I wanted the horn beep to be timed to censor some of the lines with cussing in them, that would've been fantastic. You missed your one shot, and that opportunity comes once in a lifetime
That's no Macklemore, that Vanilla Ice obviously! The nerve of some people...
True, Em is eerily quiet on Trump compared to Bush.
Come on now, that ain't Mackelmore... that's Dan Smith from BYU.
i get that it was scripted but what the fuck was this??
Subsribe me i will subscribe i back
Woah, woah, woah.... Slim shady, take a rest, old man. Catch your breath before you keel
Oh look Fake Fox News is not getting that covered !

Slim dickhead , fookin spotty little Herbert, slim anus fookin dick!!
Cringy.  What is this ? Snl
Idiot
Stephen Colbert has a little tiny penis
It's just not funny tho is it
What car company is *LS SC?*\n\n\n                 ⬇\n\n\n\n\n\n*Late Show* with *Stephen Colbert*
BRUH! This freestyle have Trump supporters, you knowcloset racist so mad. They calling him everything but a child of god. That goes to show you like Trump said QOUTE: I can shoot a man in broad daylight and not lose 1 supporter might even gain a few. Trump called men expressing there rights sons of bitches but has yet to condemn the Las Vegas mass murderer if PEOPLE TRUMP supporters is the problem they will not call Trump out on one of his lies! That my people is SCARY ASF? He even lost the VOTE but all you hear is he won? That's like the Patriots winning the Super Bowl but lose cause the NFL P.A. said no we're giving it to the Browns JUST CAUSE. This my folks is why we should not vote next election everyone in America cause obviously they gone pick the candidate who will distract the American's the most why they do there dirty work.
Eminem is cringe, he was best staying in hiding.
What about the scene where Eminem was still relevant? Or right that was 15 years ago.
He sounds right cunt on this
My apologies for the long post... had to get a few things off my chest.\n\nStill can't understand (for the life of me) how/why Black folks are quick to take knees; whine about Republicans/Conservatives/Trump/Police; how poorly (they think/feel) 'The White Man' is/has been treating them (while begging for their attention) and White Supremacy but quickly OVERLOOK ALL of THAT whenever they get the attention they CRAVE/BEG for from White People. \n\nThese fickle Black folks will show love to ANY/EVERYONE who panders to their feeble 'struggle/opression' Group Hive think and will IMMEDIATELY vilify/try to destroy anyone (other Black folks included) who break away from that fatuous mentality and/or chooses to think for themselves... Damn shame.\n\nOne last thing... These athletes/celebrities who constantly whine about the POTUS are weak. Whenever they're given an opportunity to meet him face-to-face to address their concerns, they act like BRATS, refuse to meet with him (runaway) and choose (INSTEAD) to name-call/disrespect him on social media. ALL because it's cool and will get them clicks; likes; retweets; reposts; followers and attention. They're NOT role models/revolutionaries/leaders, they're 'Hive Think' FOLLOWERS and COWARDS.\n\nThey're not looking for solutions to problems, they're looking to stay in the good graces of their 'Group Think' peers and fans. All they do is WHINE about 'stuff' (built upon emotions) but FAIL to BRING LOGICAL SOLUTIONS to ANY of it. \n\nKneeling about 'stuff' (WITHOUT ACTUAL LOGICAL SOLUTIONS) DOES NOT bring about solutions it just brings about attention to kneeling.\n\nHow about we focus on teaching our children to become doctors; lawyers; scientists; engineers; teachers; public officials; police officers; fire fighters; politicians; business owners; entrepreneurs and the like INSTEAD of Entertainers (i.e. Rappers; Actors; Athletes and the like)?\n\nHow about we teach and show the IMPORTANCE of education, ownership and growing LEGALIZED wealth in order to better one's self, family and/or community?\n\nHow about we WORK to improve our neighborhoods? How about we demonize/vilify the drug dealers, gang members and people (INSIDE) who are ACTIVELY/CONSTANTLY/DELIBERATELY DESTROYING our communities? How about we WORK/FIGHT to remove THEM?\n\nNAW... Let's keep kneeling and blaming EVERYONE ELSE INSTEAD. YEAH, that makes MORE sense; that's the solution.\n\n'Butthurt' Group/Hive Think individuals... Feel free to childishly insult me with You Bitch Ass Nigga; House Nigga; FuckBoy; Race Traitor; Coon; Token; Troll; Black Impersonator; White Boy; Agent and/or whatever insult I forgot in 3... 2... 1...
Eminem is cringe !! 😂
My comment was NOT edited
I was waiting for Stephen's reaction to this 😂
Embarrassing just totally embarrassing. \nNo flow, time to retire Em. I loved ya back in the day. But it's time to hang it up man.

Nothing against the Chainsmokers, but why are Cheat Codes so underrated? There is enough space in this industry

It wasn't bad, but I'm glad it was about youth/fun instead of just sex. Cheat Codes has so much time to get better and better and I think we will all see them top the charts soon and make incredible music.
This song describes my senior year not only because I was actually failing math but also because I miss being young and care free!

We should get rid of the current education system and instead replace them with a movie like experience, where all the students get like ridiculously comfy chairs, a big screen with everyone in front of it, popcorn or snacks of any kind with drinks, and just play minute earth and minute physics videos. Guarantee you this, whatever the official number is for the amount of students that succeed through their lives will skyrocket compared to how it has been. An 8 year old could watch this and learn without confusion. This world is very far behind where it could already be, people like the people here at minute earth are what we need.

Another absolute phenom vlog!  I literally cannot get through a Nile vlog without a giant grin on my face.  Him and his friends/family just bring so much joy to everyone.
Cracking comeback after the injury, mate. Was rooting for you and delighted to see you made the world championships. Looking forward to see much more of your journey, Nile.
I've been a fan for a long time and it makes me feel so good to see you succeed and be so proud of yourself!\n\nEdit: Wow, that was really cheesy

Amazing Nile! well done! ❤️❤️🎉
I'm weak and skinny so how do I get started???
Nile, where do you live? I went overseas recently and your accent suddenly came to my mind, not sure why xD
I always wondered what that thing is in his intro. Is it a computer mouse or something???
It's possible to start gymnastic at 16 years?
I won National for Taekwondo and I’m in Kang’s Taekwondo. Now I’m National champion,but I can’t go to world because I’m not old enough. I’m only 8 and I’m supposed to be 12!
Nile I’m state champion in gymnastics Australia,Queensland
Is it just me or do Nile and Max not get along?
Congrats Nile! Killing it and inspiring. I actually liked this time though cos of Purvis' freestyle.
Nile how did you like Canada? And did you like us Canadians?
May I ask, do you know Epke Zonderland? He's a gymnastic from the Nehterlands. I'm also from the Netherlands 😅😂🇳🇱🇳🇱

the quick if i had to get doesn't really fit but besides that its a fine track.
I'm not sure why Afrojack is releasing on Armanda. But considering the other songs he has released they wouldn't fit on armanda very well. But I'm just happy this song exists.
Amazing.
Tá show é a melhor vocalista do mundo ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That piano feels out of beat...
Nahh ....... Future House isn't Afrojack at all ....

Μπραβο VASSY πολυ ωραιο κομματι

Uwielbiam takie kawałki i ten głos.. Vassy
Vassy's voice is simply made for EDM 😍👌
VASSY, you should sing more, your voice is awesome! Youre doing really well.

This song has me missing people I haven't even met before 😳 Loving the new tune 🔥🔥🤘
Am I the only one who thinks that the vocals of Vassy started at a weird point  of the instrumental? It just seemed off to me :/\n\nEdit: Also her timing right before the drop hits is weird to me.\n\nCorrect me if im wrong :P

Best Hey Ya! cover to date
There was a time this group really had s chance.  Then they added Sarah and went in such s shit direction focusing more on 'cute YouTube videos then dope original music
I cant even lift my leg that high let alone have that much focus
one of the most creative, if not the most, music covers I have ever seen
This is amazing. Right on guys!!
Instant Happiness check list. \n1. Walk off the Earth\n2. \n3.  etc....
Been watching you guys for many years and you never disappoint and this was outstanding!!!
I love the energy that goes into these videos! stay awesome!
I seriously need to have a long hard think about my life, how did I get here? And why do I love this?.... Fuck...
You are great friends !! I really love you! And I think you're just getting better, and I like the way you're going. You're so good. Yes..!! Show the world what you can do best !!
I had a pretty shitty day up until seeing in my recommended that you covered this classic; then I almost cried smiling as I watched you perform it. Really, really uplifting guys, absolutely great content as always.
If nick disney or discovery dont offer you a tv show after this one they are collectivly stupid
It is possible that this is the best thing you've ever created. Which is really really saying something.
BEARD GUY SHAKING HIS TUSH....  ABSOLUTELY MADE MY NIGHT!!!  Not sure who was the 'other' beard guy but the dancing on the sofa with the Superman dive to the other room was AWESOME.
Dont play Cahill for Ffs i said in my line u play C.Ap A.c Rud \nPlay david in mid we were so rubbish its unbelievable honest why did we not keep the ball bats had his chance i would have played Ped from the starts instead of William our team needs to do some much hard core training we playes a team that have a game since the start . The 2nd goal wtf wtf wtf come on he runs past u and score . Please we need to play A.C Rud at the bk . We have serious need of players . Simple
think we should concentrate on europe, man city are looking on another level this year.....
Michy isn't a premiership player we are playing as a mid table side
Bakayoko was the best player. Michy was the worst. And there were some people who said they prefered that formation over the false 9...
Sophie here! Apologies I meant David Luiz back from suspension not injury! Besides this, I do feel our title hopes are unfortunately over. Our rivals are displaying much better performances. Thoughts??
Just a shit day. Big players like Hazard, Azpi who are consistently brilliant were completely out of it today. It's clear to see why Michy isn't rated by Conte. We've got Tammy banging them in for Swansea, infinitely better than Michy who imo plays better with a second striker. No Kante, no Drinkwater, no Morata, Moses goes off, just a shit day. Happens. Conte should rotate? With what?\n Hasn't got the players or quality to rotate. We move on and we put it right asap. COME ON CHELSEA!
Things that went wrong for me. Willan ,Alonso,michy. No quality in backup. Board didn't back Conte he was calling for it all summer. Probably a cup top 8 or top 4 in champions league and see pep take the league when we could have build on a winning season
Stunning Sophie would love to tie you to that bed and do torturous things to you~ \n\nOut title race is over, Hazard will leave for Madrid because of Willian's wankstain ability.\n\nCahil still starts, Christiensen dropped for no reason. \n\nConte still the stubborn old bag he is. Michi needs to fuck off the Twitter merchant cunt.
I want to be with you in your flat Sophie
Hazard is not a world class player..
Bakayoko and fabregas were the only players showing any real passion but weren't good enough like the rest of the squad. Cahill needs to be dropped completely we have 2 centre backs on the bench who are better and have passion. Willian isn't the same player he used to be which is a concern as he has been so good in the past. Zappacosta looked good when he came on. If we are that desperate for a striker then we should recall Abraham? He needs to work alongside people like Morata to show quality. Simply not good enough.
i don't think you can retain your title. top four/cup is the best for you, but even if conte is not at fault, he would get the sack if he doesn't do much this season. that said, he IS at fault for you lot, sicne he's got shit tactically wrong.
If we still have Costa and Matic in that match .............
Best performance was Cahill , worst was azpilicueta , all the rest were awful
Conte of late is making a habit picking the wrong squad....cahill,willian keep strolling into the team when they are clearly out of form.....rudiger,pedro,christinsen keep warming the bench...why??something is going on behind the scenes and conte needs to sort out the issue.
its about time tammy abraham next season should be first team regular next year man on form in swansea he should play with alvaro mrata week in week out charly musonda shold be given more time
As a city fan I was felling like this when we lost at Leicester and Everton so really Chelsea fans welcome to reality I'm enjoying heaven with city. Secondly best was fabregas and worst Mr invisible hazard
You  are better pundit than some at Sky sports, keep it up . Chelsea will come back
The Kante rumour was meant to trigger you guys. Kante wouldn't get in to that PSG midfield.
batshuay out. call Tammy Abraham, Even if he is not going to score but he has good movement than Batshuay. I hate Batshuay
Michy isn't as good as other strikers. He doesn't make runs or give defenders a hard time. It was his time to shine but he never. Now I understand why conte doesn't rate him. Just a shitty day but I hope we bounce back against Roma.
the problem with chelsea is your overconfident conte prick! you shouldnt change your winning comibination be it any sport! the guy let costa, matic leave who were key players for you the last time so it shouldnt be a shock to you!
Conte didn't even  commit long-term to Chelsea and he was allowed to get away with offloading Costa, our top goal scorer, one of the best in the PL. Now we're seeing the effect of that. Chelsea is done for now and the next 2 years, we won't win anything. Conte will not attract any top player with this attitude.
Conte needs to just fucking get over it. work with what u got. we still have enough in our squad to beat a shit side like Palace. He needs to get he head in it because he is obviously distracted by something.
Can someone tell this chick that its not about the selection its about the whole team... We needed reinforcements in the summer.. Maybe Cahil shouldn't start but having Willian and Alonso with no replacement... Michy aint a  footballer!! \nAnyone that thinks Michy is by any chance better than Arsenal's Yaya Sanogo then you're deluded!!!\nI don't know why i'm commenting here...fuck this shit hahaha!
I think Tammy Abraham is better than Michy. 4 Epl goals in 5 game is absolutely good talent.  We need to back him because off we need him.
we'll be okay against Roma
Unless Man City do an Arsenal and crumble spectacularly towards end of season, then the title is surely theirs.. This Chelsea squad isn't as good as last years. Sell Matic get Drinkwater?! Transfer window was a joke, Morata is good but he's just one player. We're gonna be fighting for a top four place for sure!\nStill early days, gonna reserve full judgement until around November. Echo other comments would like top four finish with stronger emphasis on Champs league.
Babe shows us some cleavage when Chelsea looses as it will at least help a bit
Oh Conte's a little bit rubbish now.. Just go do one Sophie ffs
Please popularise this comment to conte. Some improvements: buy aubameyang to play him up front with Morata. Also, get Sanchez. His skill works amazing with hazard and pedro and Willian. Imagine that. Sanchez. Aubameyang. We have the money! Cmon conte!!!!!
Yeah, concentrate on CL That'll help.......
Can u dress like u did in soccer am
Well firstly Rory never has a clue! Didn’t see the match today first one missed in ages , I do agree we won’t win the league. Man City will easily but we should try and at least push for 2nd or 3rd
We need Jamie Vardy pay the 40 or 50m
Got a phone number ?
It’s funny coz I was getting clothes for my holiday and there was a palace supporter severing me and I was like I think palace will win as a joke and he was like nah Chelsea will smash us and here we, I was right even though I didn’t want to be 😂
Drinking water,)\nToday in Liverpool vs man United\n one  player\n he looks like a big STARS on the making.. unbelievable \n.. 11..⏳👌👏
Batshuayi looses the ball so easily, he just can't hold up the ball. On top of that many players underperformed today ( don't want to pin point them ). Yes after this game the title hopes are realistically over, unless we pull off something great.
Not only were Chelsea the first team to concede to the one of the worst premier league teams ever (not scoring for 7 games straight, losing all) but they also lost to that team.\n\nWow....
I want to see only two things this season, and you know it...
Sophie is class,speaks a lot of sense. - Manchester Utd fan.
Fabregas was world class that match, it's a shame he was the only one who was half decent though. Even Bakayoko was average because, apart from his goal, his performance was sub par. I still have faith in Conte to bring us back into the title race however. COYB
really dislike michy as a player
4 min in and your analysis is....what is it exactly? You are not consistent and you are too emotional. I will chalk it up to thinking with you heart. \n\nGive credit to Palace and the position they were in. They don’t want to break the record for worst start to a season. Zaha has always given us problems and was running riot on Cahill and Alonso. Townsend and C are quality and the ball and luck was with them. \n\nChelsea was looking forward to midweek obviously. The analysis is quite easy for an educated footballer/supporter. I know you have it in you. \nI recommend writing up some outline notes and maybe watch highlights to refresh you memory. I support  you and your Channel and I love you as a fellow fan...and of course dem tig-o-bittties heheh 😏\n\n#COYB
Hellooo gorgeous, u look healthier than the previous video..I think baka n ces should not play together.. agree w/ u Rudi, Andreas n Azpi as the back three.. and why Willian Conte????
You just got beat by the *CRYSTAL PALACE* football club, formed in *1861* then founded in *1905*
This season is all about the Champions League. If we finished 4th, that would be fine considering our injuries and lack of depth for now. Roman is all about the CL and unless we take points from Roma, it's going to be ugly. If we don't make the round of 16, the season may be the Mourinho year we didn't think possible. Would back-to-back losses to Roma be the end of Conte? He looked pretty angry in the post-match press conference. Too bad there's not an October window.\n\nMitchy showed what no one is willing to say, and that is he doesn't actually create anything and he's scored his goals almost accidentally. Better as a sub when nothing else is working. I wasn't surprised to see Musonda. I expect to see him play v. Roma, even if Conte says Morata will play.
You are going to be very happy I suppose when Conte leaves !! Mitchy suuuuuucksssss
I hope you manage to decipher that I am a real Chelsea Fan amongst the idiots in this comments section, born and raised Chelsea Wharf and Worlds End.\n\n1.What's the big crisis? We lost to the current premiership leaders 1-0, and lets be honest they have been killing all the competition 4-0, 5-0, 7-0 etc.\n\n2. Palace away , who lets not forget are great going forward.\n\n3.A depleted squad with an own goal to boot.\n\n4.INTERNATIONAL duty meant players got injured and fatigued.\n\nCmon you Blues!!
Everyone was just bad, no one did any good.....
Embarrassing...nothing more to say.
Llorente didn't want to join Chelsea, prefered Tottenham anyway.
Highlights | Live Match Review?
😍😘😗😙😑
Best - Zappacosta Worst - Luiz
Bring back Tammy, play Christensen, Rudiger, Azpi! :(
Hazard was terrible
who's zara?
except bakayoko nobody was good without kante
You missed MATIC !
Fuck u guys
Poor game
Title hopes are gone :(
bring back tammy ffs
Ur so beautiful baby girl
Chelshit
can we play you every week......and didnt we beat you last season......get over it
Yes Sophie we had an arguement few days ago about  this game, as we all worried  about it, as we all can smell problems in our team. Palace is not an average team, they are loaded with some very good players and a very good coach. Zaha  is probably better than most of the Chelsea attackers, and Townshend is a better  winger than any Chelsea's wingers. Conte is very upset, very angry and probably will not sleep for a few nights. he knows he made mistakes, and he is a very good learner. Let's hope  he will do his homework well. Problem is not just a debt. We have now 4!!!! injured players and at least  2-3  completely  out of form. We do have Musonda and we do have Kennedy. maybe Conte should  give these two  a fair chance
We are missing a leader up front, which is Costa.
Now you see why Michi should not start.
Let's be honest.  Conte is going to leave. The board are clearly pissing him off and it's effecting the team.  Not contes fault.  Fuck the board
I fking called it.. if rorey stops doing those 5 reasons that we smash crystal palace and such bullshit and jinx the damn team always against these minnows it would be appreciated. lol
The Atletico was one of my favourite performances ever from us, we actually attacked. City was back to normal, just trying to sit back and defend, and a poor team choice from Conte, then this game was just embarrassing, we had players missing but still.
fuck off   chelsea
Exchange batshuayi for Zaha in January
I tried to troll Chelsea but then realize we have just lost 2-1 to  Watford
Truth. Conte is rigid. Christensen can play on the LCB.\nTruth. Trust a woman's intuition, Rory. Your positivity is on plastic levels.\n\nBest performance is Cesc. Worst is the whole team.\n\nNo chance of League. Don't dream of Cups (except Sophie's). Conte's record in cup competition is abysmal.
Wahey! Hahahaha fucking palace the Geordie's will show you's southern cunts how it's done next week!
The difference between us and the Manchester clubs are why we are not as good as them, our squad is just as good, if not better, but we mess up against teams like this, and when we do win we sit back and defend when the Manchester clubs go to destroy every team. We need to play like we did against Atletico every game, we need to stop this sitting back game plan now.
I only hope Christensen goes to a better team that will value him, why on earth are we not playing a class young CB who will be the best defender in the world.
Hazard is inconsistent for us but for Belgium he bangs in goals all day long
We will still win the league

what happens at the end of the book? im interested...
You really couldn't of got an actual British person to play moss?
aaaaand turned it off six minutes in. no thanks
Awesome review! Very well done. Loved that you acted out the whole thing!
The ending credits dialogue, did you use that from James and Mikes video about Movie Titles?
Also the movement and CG was supposed to show how inhuman and not of this world Pennywise is. You just seem like you don't get it
Halloween, 90's It and A Nightmare On Elm Street are good examples of creepy moody soundtracks
Your Bill S. IT impression was actually really good.
Now, I've been a fan since jr high, if I don't like this video it's over man
I hope you'll do a review of Cult of Chucky soon :3
...Actually, I remember people absolutely loving the review of the original It, saying it was the best review yet.
I first saw that Pennywise dancing clip as a gif on the internet and, to be honest, I thought it wasn't in the movie. I thought it was just a meme somebody made, and I ended up cracking up when I saw it in the movie.
I love the Batman animated series reference. One of the best episodes
Love the review (as always), but deep respect for the Batman TAS callback :D
shooting up a theater... too soon critic too soon... haha jk IDGAF
I'm too scared to watch the actual movie but I'm just gonna go ahead and state that this review is 10x better than the actual movie anyway so thank you nostalgia critic!
I think calling the boat a she is supposed to be foreshadowing for part 2. The line It's a she is kind of important in the book.
That headless ghost thing made me laugh mahbe a bit too much...
Spirit photography eh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIS THAT A JOJS REFERENCE
I swear I thought they were gonna tell 2017pennywise that everyone on Tumblr wants to bone him.
For me, I think it was better than the original, but nowhere near perfect. If I had to give it a rating (with 1 being awful, 5 being absolute average and 10 being perfect) it'd be a 6.5 or 7.
Hahahaha, this is one of your best reviews Critic, well done!\n\nHad me laughing non-stop!\n\nGreat work and effort on mimicking the CGI, effects, etc.!\n\nI was very pleased/impressed!\n\n*It* was a great video!
During my viewing with this movie a person next to me a friend explain some of the things left out from the book
Please Grow Your Hair Back Critic!
should i really be watching this if i haven't seen the movie yet? yea, f*ck it.
I honestly thought that the headless boy and painting lady were crummy effects and really laughable
Usually when someone walks in front of the curtains they tell you they will show something scary... I thought they were going to say moulin rouge.
Also IT is such a monster that IT does not comprehend Human concepts such as Being Funny. IT is so alien to us that concepts such as innocence are wasted upon it. IT only wants to feed, that is the only desire that IT feels. IT is the opposite of GOD.  IT does not understand what it is to be funny to us. IT does not understand what it is to be inviting to us, all it can do is watch everything we do and emulate it, and wait for the chance to strike. Like a Snake in the Grass.  All IT understands is fear. Fear is what it feeds from, fear is the whole reason for being within the behemoth of IT.
This whole gag of this Review being a reference to the Batman TAS episode called Almost Got'im kinda made mah day. Resubscribed. That, and the references to original IT.
That Who’s On First ending bit was magical.
Anybody know the song played during the rock scene?
This review 10/10 keep up the good work everyone
I'm just putting this out there: I thought the reason why Bev's entrance was slowed down the second time Bill sees her is because she came back - the first time she comes into the drugstore it was a coincidence; she just happened to walk in when the boys happened to be there. Then Bev makes the conscious decision to come back to the drug store and talk to the boys (when she didn't have to), which makes it special for Bill.
I'm perfectly fine with the true loves kiss cliché as long as it replaces the old cure for seeing the monsters true form\n\nA.k.a. RIDING ON A BIKE
Moss with a 'ruddy gun' is far scarier!
goddamn he fucking killed it in this review. first time in a long time i laughed that hard at one of his vids
the tommy wiseau part made me laugh way harder than it should’ve
Hey Channel Awesome Do a Review on The series called Wakfu you can watch it on Netflix.\nIts a series based on a game created both by Anthony Roux. Made in 2011 or sometime earlier(series) Its fun but sometimes very......Perverty and weird in an anime-ish way....(Forget that part but remember it at the same time,critic)cuz I mean it in A TV-Y7 adventure show some Perverty jokes come by.\n(Also this channel is funny :D)
I found that in the 2017, the new PW looked and sounded like a chipmunk.\nAlso, that sewer scene really just sounded like he was trying to act like the original, not trying to lure Georgie in.\nOf course, I speak of the real movie, not the version NC did.
Maybe because it subverted my expectation, but I laughed more in this movie than I think I ever had in a legitimate comedy. I hate that saying that gives most people the impression that I'm trying to be edgy, and for that I almost wish I found it scarier, but I could not stop laughing. Even for small design choices like bug-eyes or the voice they gave Pennywise had me giggling to myself and scenes like IT as Georgie getting their head blown by the sheep gun had me legitimately in tears. This doesn't lessen my opinion of the movie, as the first will always be in my heart as the childhood terror anyhow, so it's better to have this one settle in my mind as The hilariously goofy one.
if anyone feels triggered you can say hello to MY TRIGGER BIATCH!\n\nBest opener ever. Really set the pace for the review and I have to say it was very well put together and humorous.
God damn, I'm not even mad 😂
I love this. It's so self-aware and well produced. I think that with each episode, the quality increases!
Please do Happy death day! It’s stupid and a little scary but it’s amazing as hell!
I can not wait till you guys hit 1m subs😁
They didnt even go that heavy on the music in that hand scene...
This has been the best review in a long time.
There was supposed to be an American IT Crowd?
I've watched this 3 times already. Looks like this review is as good as the movie.
Also, what`s that talk about half-assed and stable realtionships at the end? They're 13 old kids in the 80's, how serious relationships even fit in this context? Also, whos ssaying the new It is a game changer? Popular, average internet opinion? Because it has a 70 on Metacritic, and despite you like the site or not (I don't) it hardly constitutes a Game Changing score, specially in a world where criticas give 9s and 10s like cheap candy. It's a decent and nostalgic, albeit flawed, horror movie, with very good actors and atmosphere, weak horror and some tone problesm  and that's something that should be no secret. The complaint about the effects is very valid, but compared to the original, the new one has far better effects, overall. Yes, Tim Curry is more memorable as Pennywise, doesn't make him actually better than the new one. The older movie may be more memorable to Doug, but for me, being clumsy and bad doesn't constitues as memmorable.  The new actors where very much so to me, for all the good reasons. while the old movie is just memmorably bad. I'll definitely watch It (2017) again, but I have no wish to revisit the old one anytime soon. And Doug just brushed over the real problems the new movie has, while making forced and unfunny jokes about things that he considered problems, but weren't really.
Tim Curry. The Legend. Every role he gave 100%, voice acting or live. A true artist.
He does know it only had a $35 million dollar budget right?
I didn't mind the creepy music that much but hey everyone has got their own opinions
But how do you tame a horse in minecraft
The entire video was a Batman reference. Beautiful
Was totally expecting to see Doug popping up as Heath Ledger's Joker at the end.
25:11 just in case anyone didn't know they have an orgy in the book
He didn't have a fucking nose, Doug
The dialogue at the end reminds me of the Lutece Twins.
I kinda like the slow motion when she showed up. He already saw her before but love at first sight isn't real. Before she was just some girl like all other girls, but when she walks out is slow motion she's the cool girl that will help you rob a store. I thought using slow motion the second time implied he liked he because she helped them with their plan and proved herself to be cool. Just my interpretation though.
I think my favorite part is the chart guys! It's fucking hilarious
God damn it.... Where is the love button YOUTUBE!!!
Enjoyed the review. I definitely loved the references to Batman:TAS Almost Got 'Em episode and Abbott & Costello's Who's on first skit.
9:29 haha, A Troll In Central Park reference.\n\nah Nostalgia Critic, never stop being meta.
They're not Jared Leto \n\nYou have my like
Malcolm breaking the fourth wall.\n\n“This feels self defeating”\n\nOfficially ded from laughter
24:12\nThat's cute ^w^
Best It Review EVER!!!
In my OPINION the old IT was better, it was actually kind of scary, whereas the new IT completely relied on jump scares, but I wasn't even jump scared, and you can always tell when the jump scares will going to happen.
In the book Beverly fucked all the boys
The reason she's in slo-mo the second time is because she cut her hair and it looked great.
I absolutely died of laughter at, MEME ME! XD
Good job on the review this is the 4th time I watched this and genies idea with BTAS idea of how you did this review like the episode of Almost Got em.
Every fucking guy with a brain would know that NO one would ever go near a clown that scary. So how exactly does he feed off fear when no one even goes near enough?
I think Doug might be going insane. Most of this review, he is talking to himself.
Gotta love how Doug has read the book but still points out the flaws in the movie which come from the book. Also I can't stand these reviews where he acts out the movie which demean the scenes so it makes it easier for him to shit talk movies. Not to mention that his skits and voices are all obnoxious and cringey.

Oh hi kids hahaha!
Wow, I didn’t know the nostalgia critic still existed...
Wait, so who was Malcom supposed to be?
I'm gonna have to agree about the music being over the top. In my theater it was so loud, second time it was a lot quieter and made it that much better. Also my husband and I laughed when we saw the burnt kid. Didn't find that scary or creepy at all. Still though this movie takes a second watch to really appreciate it. The first time I had nostalgia goggles on and its hard to not compare to the first.
It was just a prank, -Han- Woody!
With each Lazer Team movie, we slowly replace all the original cast with the Superstore cast
I really do hope it's better than the first one.
change the name to razor team and slit your wrists..
Gavin couldn't film because he was in Britain the whole time The Movie
Didn't they lose like $800,000 on the first Lazer Team? Hope you can pull it off with the sequel Rooster Teeth...
I legit just watched lazer team again before i saw this! We doing a fund for this one too?
Man did she get down in shameless 🤘
I'm a bit disappointed that it isn't La2er Team
So this is it, huh, we're some kind of Lazer Team?
How long before It's not a DeLorean! becomes a shirt?
I can see that the writing hasn't really improved much...\n(JK, I love you guys)
Oh God, does this mean every single RT video is going to start with the teaser This video brought to you by the new movie Laser Team 2. Coming November 22?
is that amanda from shameless?
I can't wait!
Can anyone please tell me the name of the song playing? It's so goofy I need it.
From the thumbnail I was worried they cast Lindsey as the scientist.  thank god it didn't happen.
I am really happy this is coming out soon! way to go RT, I'll see you in theaters next month
Lazer Team is slowly becoming SuperStore. Can't wait for Dina to be in Lazer Team 3.
aye they got emily from until dawn
im so happy right now!!!!
I bet it's actually a DeLorean.
Why is Gavin/Woody not in that thumbnail?
Is that Emily from Until Dawn?
This one looks wayyyyyyyy better then the first one
I'll be honest, I REALLY liked the first movie and I'm looking forward to this one. Maybe it's the fanboy in me talking, IDK.
I feel there going to scale back on the sequel. But I'm still excited. The dynamic between the team and the scientist might be interesting.
*when Gavin is taken* YOU BASTARDS
Jesus wait, I haven’t even seen the first one yet...I want to if you wanted to know
I have yet to see the first one, and you're already bringing out a second. Bravo, dudes and dudettes - bravo!
Anyone wander why this is on trending with 200k views and h3s video with 10mil in one day wasn't... YouTube there's other ways of advertising! Which are fairer too
Can't Wait!!!!!
Ew
I'm excited
ITS NOT A DELOREAN!
...I see the writing is still clever.
first one was meh, but I liked it just cause of burnie, michael, and gavin...this one looks meh, but I will watch it cause of burnie, michael, and gavin
Oh yes
*AND YOU DIDN'T BRING ANY EXTRA PLUTONIUM?*
I hope the dialog volume is a bit higher in the movie than in the trailer, some of the texts were hard to make out.
all aboard to the HYPE Train!
IS THIS ONE PLAYING AT TORONTO AFTER DARK TOO???
Reviews for the first one weren’t good, because people never watched roosterteeth, the jokes were great and I loved it, this looks even better
Is that emily from until dawn? if it is and you didn't make a joke aout the butterfly effect i will be disappointed.
They got that one girl from shameless.

This and the first Lazer Team are the main reasons why I have my YouTube Red account. I'm so hyped!
Really hope this is rated R...
End of lazer team 1: \n*Ice cube's voice*\nyall motherf*ckers is going to space
If there isn't a Delorean in this film, so help me....
THU CUT OFF HIS HEAD\nYOU KILLED HIM
Cant wait to see that sweet sweet Delorean
Amazing also I feel like Michael just plays himself in these movies
Lol Gavin is lost! That makes so much sense!
I think I'm more excited for this one because now I know what I'm getting myself into lol
sir they have locked lasers onto us
I watched the 1 now I am watching the second when it comes out
So there going into another dimension...ok\n(Silently hops they meet the reds and blues)
soooooooooooo....... no gavin for more than 65% of the movie???\n(Also I'm just guessing how much of the movie gavin won't be in )
Well... I'll be waiting for the Blu Ray
Okay but real truth here, when does the blu ray come out?
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going.
I can already tell it's gonna be hilarious.
I actually liked the first one for some reason.
Looks like Going up against a wendigo and surviving changed Emily for the better
THEY CUT OFF HIS HEAD!
Ow ffs I wanted to see Gavin through out the movie not at the end of the movie
I came on myself out of pure excitement
Is she from the game Until Dawn?.....Nvm
At least we know Woodrow won't starve to death
I feel bad about Gavin, he is poor when he got stuck across the galaxy, but I like the girl's hairstyle.\n👏🏻🖖🏻👌🏻👍🏻✌🏻️😃
I hate to say it, but i'm kind of surprised there doing another one after the last one did so poorly.
The first one was really bad, and this one looks worse from the trailer only.
It's not Delorian!
oh no
will dis be on da Netflix
Yayyyyyyyyyy
This looks good
Beutumis
Haha haha so funny
No. No. NOO. NOOOOOOOOOOO!

im kinda surprised since the first one bombed
The first one was meh at best and the ending was terrible was make a second one
Did this genuinely need a sequel though?
Reminds me of my husband on our wedding day, I cried too.
n'awww adorable
Should’ve disabled comments
This is so sweet :,)
The kid looks so confused.
Little boy going damm what a bitch, stahp this is embarassing.
he's crying because he knows that tonight he's gonna have to stick his dick in that hippo
Black people are so dramatic.
He's crying because he can't get a refund on that atrocious singer they hired.
What a fag!
*_THANK GOD, that Axl Rose isn't a douchebag Trump supporter._*
Agh 💕 much to love to axl rose 💕💕 saw there this past summer and never rock n rolled so hard in my life 💕💕
Dam, Axl has gotten a fat belly. Guess we all get a little older and thicker around the waistline. Lol
Omg. At least pink can still sing. Axle sounds like shit. Maybe thats why it took so long to get the balz to try again. Original GnR was the best.
at least PINK can sing--damn guns did you forget how to use the vocals??
It seems for her, was a dream come true ...
GnR was a great band. 20yrs ago. 💛
Shame.... I grew up with this band when they were the hottest thing going...Axl Rose looks like a tele tubby and should just sit down
Pink is the best female entertainer in nay genre\\\love that lady!
Duff looks good,  straight edge gets the ladies,  blow is so eighties
Axl n Pink....Lets get this party started !!!
Pink is a huge fan of GN'R. \m/
Please someone get a personal trainer for Axl
Even the god is smiling
G & R is a legendary rock band. Best time of my life was when they were at their peak in the 90's.
God .... Axl needs to drop about 30 pounds
pity she couldn't sing in time with the music
Never thought I'd see that happen. I like the new Axl.
Love Pink. Her voice is amazing.
A lot of cake has been eaten by these two...
Duff seems to still be sexy af...
he is losing weight
Ok, I knew Pink was cool, this helps prove it.
GnR are actually relevant again! ÀND KICKIN ASS! just stick to the hits though we don't need another spaghetti incident
in the old days they would have had  nothing to do with her  type, pink , man o man, what happen
Axel looks like any fatty seating in a white trash bar...pffff!!!!
The only person who takes it up the ass more than axl is pink...both        chubby and have hit the wall...slash and duff are still cool tho
I'm a huge pink fan but that sucked :(
My life has been restored.
Wish he would have done this song when i saw him at soldier field  this summer!
He's pregnant with a food baby. And he sounds awful.
I love axel but he could’ve done a better job hiding his fake whistling
Pink had to Fuck it Up
Two in the Pink, One in the stink.
Tão lindo ver o trio parada dura juntos❤
Ela canta muito, só não sabe o que é tempo e andamento.
pink sucks D!ck... Ohhhh people you know she does
They're STILL milking this thing?
glad guns and roses are still rocking..loving Pink
Just so glad to say i was there!
ok. am I the only one here who thinks this is an insult to rock and roll? THIS IS THE WORST VERSION IVE EVER HEARD!!!
Pink stinks, semen was definitely gargled on this day..
That is so cute! Pink just had another baby recently  and it looks like Axl is due any day now!
Seriously she does not give herself enough credit cuz she's amazing and I think it's a shame and a travesty that she is not as popular in the US as she is in other parts of the world - like especially Australia!!! I've seen so many interviews of other artists - I specifically remember Kelly Clarkson saying that too!!! P!NK can do anything, and the sky is the limit for her, and I LOVE how she keeps stretching that limit - pushing it higher and higher!?! Pink is totally setting the bar so high that she said this morning on an interview that she has no idea what she's going to do next and the interviewer suggested like her getting shot out of a cannon and she seriously said that someone actually mentioned that as a suggestion and I can't wait and see cuz she's so great I love how real she is with the kids and totally blunt and honest and speaks the truth of what's really going on in this world, and how she feels about it, and how it's affecting the world  Here and Now - and how she's terrified for the future for her kids and everyone else's kids as well!?! Such a great and meaningful mom comment that is so natural within her!?!💖
I used to love this guy but why do I get the impression that he's just going through the motions. \nOn the bright side Pink was good !
Nobody Does that end in As Good As axel
No need drum in this song...
Damn pink was trashhhhh :/ sad to see her like that
was great and then pink showed up
Even stars get star struck.. Good stuff thanks for posting.
She is amazing

This is more washed up than like everything ever.
They look alike. I don't know who that's worse for. Would you rather be a chick that looks like fucking Axl Rose or a dude that looks like Pink? lmao
When you turn into an elder and nothing matters
I CANT FUCKIN WAIT!!! IVE GOT TICKETS FOR GUNS AN ROSES ON OCT.23,2017 IN HARTFORD, CT. THIS CONCERT WILL BE LIT AS FUCK!!!!😎👍✌🔫🌹🎶🎵🎸🎤💯🔥🌠
Damn they have been touring non stop, I literally saw them over a year ago....how does Axl do this OVER and OVER and OVER for 3 hours every night....MAD RESPECT !!
That'll give you some real rock cred. Invite Pink onstage. That's why people diss Axl.
Axl needs to lay off the breakfast burritos.
Lucky cunt you got to sing with Mr Axl rose
No Izzy, no GnR.
Yes indeed...I'm getting older.

You and some mainstream rsppers are doing great wit dis emotional shit

Everyone go listen to 16 shots by vic mensa he not the only rapper that stay woke
Glad 21 released something like this.  Not glad that the hip hop fan shitheads make fun of (and talk down on) anyone who isn't woke since Kendrick's come up.
This song hit me deep hard omfg
21 Savage is saying he killed Drake's homie 🤝
I'm so sick and tired of this happening to the black community and no one shines light on it im white but I was never raised to dislike any color and I think its terrible what the world is doing putting this in the shadow just like how YouTube put xxxtentacions song in the shadows by not putting it on the trending session we will be herd no matter what they say or do this world will be changed eventually
This music touched me because i have been through stuff like this two.
Im saying maybe its natural to be racist it says this about gentiles and hebrews/blacks
I fuck with it.
The cashier part was too real every time you walk in a corner store they say take your hoodie off that happens every day💀
This song make my think about a lot of stuff happening in this world today👌🏽👌🏽
THIS IS STRAIGHT FACTS RESPECT
This shit go hard but i got to know what took him so long to make a song like this
any small you tubers want to support each other! sub and drop names below! @RiahB. TV
its all the mums fault
21 Savage the last nig*a I thought to rap about some real sh*t, rather then money and hoes guess he's just hopping on the bandwagon. At least rappers are realizing that they should use there music to have good influences rather than bad
You've got colon kaepernick who sounds whiter than anyone I know😂
I never would have thought 21 would have me in tears telling me childhood and every other black men story
Why the fuck do white people hate black people? Im white and have nothing wrong with blacks
fuck racism and stereotypes im white and vietnamese hung out with black people my whole life aint nothing wrong with black ppl  fuck the racist fucks
21 savage is the kind of guy to get sponsored by big tobacco
listen to the lyrics same thing I witness on the daily this video made me cry ... #queenNica
all because of amber rose
Got 2pac vibes out of 21 \nNever though i was gonna say this
Let Me drop some stats on you, before you try to argue that white people are the problem with society. When in reality its' the fault of the political system we were in for the past 20 years where political party's; promoted black fathers to leave their family's'. \n\n- African Americans represent 15% of the U.S. population, yet they commit 73% of all violent crimes in the U.S.\n- African Americans commit 59% of all murders in the U.S., with African Americans' largest killer being other blacks about 75% of all African Americans are killed by other African Americans' with less than 3% being killed by LEO's and the rate at which those are white LEO's is even lower (Still this is quite unacceptable in some circumstances)\n\n- That is just the tip of the iceberg as well as per the FBI crime statistics, If we want to fix this we have to start promoting African American family's' staying one and not branching out and committing crimes' as these hypocrite rap artists i.e. 21 savage, Future, etc. will tell us in one song how great being a gang-banger and murderer is, and now they have the moral high-ground to tell everyone else who is wrong? Wake up America we are being fooled right before our eyes' by the same people who are telling us to commit these wrongs.
Aight tbh I didn’t fuck with 21 savage at all but I fuck with this fosho 🔥
Lil dicky in the intro
R.i.P who ever is in that casket 🙏🏽
Did i see Hitler? 3:33

I love Seth.... Marry me.☺️😍💕
It's been an open secret for some time now.
So Seth McFarlane like most of Hollywood knew this was going on and instead of using his power and influence to do something instead  made a cheep in joke about it at a ceremony. What a fucking hack piece of shit douche bag
Weinstein is a victim of Jewish Hollywood infighting,he must of upset some powerful members of his Tribe and they are simply settling scores.
The Chosen People had to much Shekels
We've stayed silent until now. We feared. We were threatened. We needed to rebuild our lives. But we can no longer sit back and let the monsters who sexually assaulted women and raped girls to roam free. Please check out famous actress Kate del Castillo movie about her abuse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOX3tjTVgQc
Called him out; or knew and didnt say anything about it publicly -.-? Just saying.
The people on Hollywood know about all the sex and pedophilia and didn't do shit. Screw them all
There is something about Seth's expression at the end that is oddly reminiscent of Bill Burr.
Seth's look at the end says: Yeah, you guys laugh it up, but you know it's true.
He knew and kept his mouth shut
so basically this'll blow over in a few years and Weinstein gets the last giggity?
And Hollywood dares to take the moral high ground by protesting against Trump and preaching feminism, while knowingly turning a blind eye to this behaviour. They're femininsts and social justice warriors when it suits them and they have something to gain. Absolute hypocrites with no standards
And you people kept watching the shit that Hollywood makes and you call them “real movies”
Funny how everyone seems to think this Harvey thing will help put an end to the sickness that is Hollywood....ahhh no it won't,because you same people still buy and watch their garage....iam proud to say i don't....its all shit.Even if Harvey does properly go under theres just another sick pedo to take hos place and you can bet on that.Fuck Hollywood hey!!
She's so ugly
This harvey weinstein is your typical kike sheeny yid piece of shit!  He should be thrown in a concentration camp and be rapped in all holes until he dies from it!
I will fight sexual abuse with women every step of the way but women have to do their part as well. First start off by NOT wearing yoga pants 365 days a year everywhere - to hospitals, schools, stores, out and about. The crutch of freedom of expression and comfort has been broken, you cannot tell me you will walk out in public wearing white/grey/tan/green yoga pants with your cameltoe hanging in broad daylight and tell me you are doing it for comfort and NOT for attention. Start respecting yourself before expecting others to respect you. A grown fucking woman should know better!
All hilarys friends are rapists... And now we know why hollywood wanted her in the white house.
Fox news is full of rapists and sexual harassers, but no one said anything for years until the final lawsuit came out.\n\nThe president has been accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and rape, yet we reward him by giving him the highest appointment in the land.\n\n\nStop acting like this is some Hollywood oddity. This isn't a problem that is unique to one industry or country. Everyone has to face it and come to terms with it  to come up with a solution. At least the much maligned mainstream media is talking about it and not down playing it like every right wing news organisation does about the Trump, or Fox News stories. Accountability isn't only exclusive to the left.
Courtney Love called him out in 2003
They all knew yet they said nothing.
it's funny because he raped women.
Why all the fuss now the fucking creeps in Hollywood all new about him back then and did nothing
watch some more here http://yobuilder.com/AoHH
He gives no fucks what he said. 😂
Stewie during Family Guy Episode: This is like that time Seth Mcfarlane called out Harvey Weinstein back In 2013. then cuts to this clip.
Look at Emma stone face, trying her best to not smile, Incase he has a job for her later.
Why do people applaud this? It was common knowledge for people in Hollywood to know Harvey was a beast, everyone knew. Seth isn't calling Harvey out hes making fun of what Harvey does to woman. Does Seth look serious? No. He told a sick joke and expected everyone to laughed at it like they did. Everyone in the room knows about Harvey and they still laughed including Seth smh. Seth never reported Harvey to the authorities so i wouldn't say he called him out.
Everyone is laughing - even though it’s not really funny. Except maybe understood as very dark sarcasm. „Serial sexual harassment and rape - how HILARIOUS! 🤗“ LOL
Those laughs.\nUhahauhahahuhahuhuuhahauahhauaha (we're laughing but we're not).
Come on man, it was all just lock room talk.
But no one knew right meryl streep?
Seems more an acknowledgement that he knew it was happening and believed that these women were the types to give it up and is the reason they got their parts.\n\nHe almost seemed to shame the women instead of harvey lol
I had the best advert ever, 2 African kids wanting money for food,1 other African man with money says no,he drops the money,the kids steal the money and buy food,the rich man starves to death
Liking a place you live has something to do with how people in that society treats you. I am a taxi driver in Toronto, this person who got inside my taxi seems like a setup. It seems like someone already pin point my taxi cab number to verbally attack me. Someone backstabbing me using different people. He was swearing and insulting about different nationalities. Also, saying how he hates different nationalities. They were laughing loud inside my cab making me uncomfortable and finally one person started to verbally attack me. All three of them spoke Arabic language and they claim that they were from Kuwait.  I do not support any movements or individuals who are a threat to someone else freedom and existence. I came to this country to live in peace and without discrimination or harassment. After been unemployed for 6 years, this is what I am getting? I don't have the freedom to work without harassment nor freedom to live without others interference. How do you expect me to like the place I live? Lastly, I didn't come to this country to live a poor miserable life, I came to this country to live well so does everybody else. I am not a high school or university drop out nor a low street rowdy who speaks shit with the rotten personality.
Using the full range of MacFarlane expressions. Both of them. I mean, have you SEEN The Orville.
unbelievably sad that it's so normalized that they are joking and laughing about it. it's one coping mechanism to deal with the vile industry they are a part of.
He made a joke about it, then never mentioned it again, so you can tell he was serious about pursuing justice.
Alex Jones was right. What now bitches?

I mean 4 years ago we had YouTube. Yet this was never in news! Thanks to Wikileaks and people who are leaking hidden secrets.
I wanted to know who won bro
Weinstein been doing this kind of thing for years yet nobody, including and especially the women said shit because it might have affected their careers negatively, so they played the game. Hardly a position deserving of sympathy.
This proves that Weinstein's behavior was well-known in Hollywood. Nobody spoke up about rape because they're all profiting from keeping their mouths shut. They're all complicit.
And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  Matthew 5:30\nAnd if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  Matthew 18:9
Hollywood invented pornography.  Actors are just fucks for the paying director.  Advanced prostitutes.
Who even actually cares about this shit? Not a big deal
He's a fucking jew what do you expect
They all knew about it,i suppose with him taking the heat,all Hollywood producers will be ringing in favour s now
Holy sh*t. The worst part is the nervous laughter and Emma Stone's reaction. Seth has really really dark humour and is brutally honest at the same time
and they laughed? The problem was not only him! It was them all!
Hollywood is infested with sick and twisted satanic pedophiles! Do your research these hellyweird celebs are into some of the most sick things we can imagine. Wake up!
his facial expression says it all tbh
*TO THE 1% OF PEOPLE WHO SEE THIS*\nIf this gets 10 likes I will upload a person falling 200 metres and SURVIVING!!  COME CHECK IT OUT
Seth's face after.....that was not a joke
making a joke isnt calling out anyone. he knew weinstein was raping woman and he made a joke about it and never mentioned it again
fuck this harvey bitch lock him up and put him in gen pop
Insert Morgan Freeman 'he's right, you know' meme here
They laugh because they all knew, but since Seth is a creator he has the balls to say it. Other actors are worried about losing their jobs so they stay silent. They knew...
He Knew
Wow
Everybody knows it too.
So woman cant act either. Hmm i knew they gave blow jobs for walmart manager positions, but not this.\nI am shocked and apalled
That means he knew about that rape, and didn't do anything about it, except downplay it as just flirting with Harvey.

KCNvREKTnQc,

KCNvREKTnQc,He should be ousted like everyone else who knew and did nothing.
How is this calling him out? He made a stupid joke, calling him out would be to really confront him hollywood hero eh.
Be quick and grab these free Cat paw gloves! Purrrfect for the cold weather! \n\nhttps://iwanttogetthat.com/products/cute-cat-paw-fingerless-gloves
Like how everyone took it as a joke - sometimes the best jokes come from real life situations 🙈
I love the movie silver linings playbook because of jlawwww
Ohh Smack. That should be the end of his company, who colluded to the point of having a  bad behaviour clause in his contract, so he wouldn't cost them money.
Ooooooh
Ha, ha. ha. That's about as funny as making fun of date rape victims.  A really weak taking a stand against Weinstein.\nBuy hey, it's the 'Family Guy' guy.  A pretty ugly show where women are concerned so no big surprise there.
I don’t get it. Is this like a meme lol
So family guy is the new Simpsons in more ways than one.
It seems everybody knew about it but nobody would do anything about it and now that he's been called out on it everybody in their sister that's coming out with some kind of story where were they when all this was happening he has a piece of shit but that's besides the point.

oof
Eff
Harvey Weinstein’s latest victims! \nhttps://youtu.be/C_Fp_9V0pTA
Seth waited 4 years for that joke to flourish!
Back then we knew Trump was a rapist and a bad president ...
Its funny how impressionable people are that...they are now calling Mcfarlane a prophet, and oracle, our savior....chill people.
One of the creepiest aholes in the business, called out the soon to be retired, creepiest guy in the business. Sounds like someone wanted Harvey's spot.
_Who likes their own comment to start?_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI make piano covers mind checking em out? They are kinda shitty but I’m trying to improve. I’m self taught
Addicted to the song
They finally made a vid for this after how long ?
why is legend looking more like arthur with those glasses?
The bass sounds like a kimbra song
Love you and the song 😣💜💜💜💜

Most of us just want to be on the penthouse floor as equals, having a grand time together...this is beautiful!
I liked this song because it sounded groovy and smooth but now I get the meaning. I like it more.
What is the girl looking at 5:08... Cuz that ain't a mirror
This is so unapologetically relevant, kudos to Legend :)
If only it was that simple 😂
John Legend? More like\n*John The Legend*
I've been listening to this song for months and visualizing the scene based on the lyrics. NOW THERE'S A VIDEO. I'm hyped

Why didn't Chance the Rapper showed up in the video?
If You're An Upcoming Artist Check Out My Page For Free Beats!🔥💯🚨
soooo... there's acceptance for everyone if you're in a penthouse?
Beautiful Video and song. I wish the whole world could come together like this. We don’t need weapons when most humans should be able to work any conflict out with words. No reason for people to be dying 😔
Who here before 2 million???
I GOT CRAZY BY SEEING THE NAME JOHN LEGEND, WHEN I SAW CHANCE I MELTED
I wonder who this overrated douche-bag weinsteined to get a career?
It takes a special kind of stupid to think unity means end of white people.
When Chance can't make it to the music video
John Legend looking like a grown up Arthur
unfortunately eminem is release a cipher
Hello! My name is Malik Charles and im really just tryna get support for my music! I write music about Love,pain and life..please take a listen https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA

interesting visual piece. all in unity at the penthouse floor.
I never heard john legend curse on ah track
Gets a little tiring all the anti trump thats invading music... I mean I get it, he's an idiot but it just gets ridiculous, rather than hating trump couldn't we love each other without brining him into it?
where's the lyric man??
Way better than that All Of Me crap.
This song came out in like 2011-2013....nice
Hi I am a 17 year old R&b artist from Toronto. I am aware that people make these comments daily, but I truly do believe that I will be the one you'll be happy you actually heard. I currently have very little subs, but every great artist started from nothing. ALL I NEED IS 3 mins of your time. If I were to summarize wat my music is about in one sentence I'd say, my music is the voice for the people who do not know how to explain there feelings.  if u enjoyed listening to my music, I hope u also subscribe bc it would help a lot.
Let’s go to that pimphouse??
JL your tie ain't straight. Dope song though :p Follow me for straight tie music videos :p
Funny how the older music like 80s and 90s still gets played till this day even though we all heard it all before. But stuff like this, once is enough
Progress colonial content opposite conservative pure military medication right light straight ancient.
Who else from Poland?
Is this dope, are you agree??

Lg v30 review?
Can you please do Google pixel xl vs Google pixel 2 xl
Can you say lies, more companies just lie cheat and steal, it's rampant! Thanks for exposing them MKB
Wait so how much does the red cost and how much does the Pixel 2 cost? All that money for only 10 dxo marks higher? Mind blown
Wow! just awesome facts... great job brother... can't be more specific  and critic about tech news and ratings...
Don't you partner with smartphone manufactures for their reviews?
Which one do u love \nThe galaxy note 8 or Google pixel 2 xl ????
I HATE DxOMark! They are PAID! If a consulting company like this REALLY wants to make a mark (did you see what I did there) then they would do the testing for FREE and make it widely known that they are in no way PAID for doing their testing and reviews and have no affiliation with the manufacturer of ANY item that they test. The LAST place I would go for test results or rating is DxOMark!
Thank you for this Marques!
One of your best videos to date. Keep up the good work.
it is a known well known fact that any number greater than 100 is a violation of the laws of physics and should therefore not be taken seriously.
I need that Alltta song. I can't find it
This was very enlightening, great info and video
All hail MKBHD hitting me with the right knowledge.
Ok... So I'm in need of advice,opinions or about anything else you can throw at me! I'm looking for a all around good sounding earbud (earphone) for daily use. I've been debating between A) Shure se250s B) beyerdynamic iDX 200 C) ma750s D) sennhieser momentum E) 1more triple driver... I'm kinda a audiophile (honestly 😉) and so I want the best rounded headphone on all categories without totally busting the bank. If you share my love for music and wanna help me out, everything is appreciated! Y'all have a good day
it should make sense to most people when they see that a camera strapped to a phone(808) is getting a lower score than yet another iphone
dude really! respect nowadays people just flow whatever they hear ;) .... keep the great work
Please make a review about L16 *16-lens camera*
Apple has ad marketing that makes chocolate ice cream out of shit. Well maybe not shit but definely not the best product ever!
Getting clicks, marketing hmm....\nThat's how you call making money?
Can you review the lg stylo 3
DxOMark: “Why are you playing us like this MKBHD!? 😩”
The Dxomark site loads like absolute shit. I also don't see LG V30 in their list at all? I can't load the full list so who knows.
I don't know any popular  techtuber who would have the courage to actually make this  video...
DxOMark seems to have found a really sly way to cater the smartphone industry towards their ratings
savage level 100 fuck cnet lol
Dope👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Jinno plus done
Very informative 👍🏻👍🏻
well said, actually well explained...
Hahaha that was awesome 108/100
The king of tech review.
Thanks! This was definitely educational. Very much appreciated :)
Thank you for making this video!
This was a really good and well researched video. Keep it up!
hmm...google gets a score from dxomark before even the pixel2 is released...Now that i know they work as consultants too it more or less explains the high score for pixel2...Wow...Great video MBKHD...ur best one till now..
I hope you create a video for J7 pro and Niva 2i.
@MKBHD - how can a weighted average (photo score of 99) be more than all of the individual scores ? Looks like something else is being used.
Wow... Just wow.... Really good video... One of the cleanest no shit informative vids i have seen to date.... Keep up the awesome work
Some people won't be happy for this video!!! You just left them uncoverd!!
When is the red hydrogen coming out?
Thanks Marques!! This means the same for the DSLR. I guess you would look at Pentax 645Z with DXO mark of 101 but failed to be published by DXO.
I like this video. I still like the DXO mark. You could improve your device by doing the same kind of testing at your own phone manufacturing plant. Just because they consult doesn't mean their scientific evidence is flawed. If you know your score is based on a standard then meet the standard or exceed it. Don't need consulting for that.
Interesting. So the Pixel 2 is only “subjectively” better than other phones. Good to know! iPhone X here you come!
At last someone with balls to bring this rating rubbish to the masses
Marques Please review the Jaybirds Run when they come out !!!!
They haven't done the v30 yet
I would love to know who the dislikers are. I’m sure they are paid dislikers.
This video is so clear on my monitor. That's by the way. I have always wondered how they come up with those scores. Thanks for the video, Marques.
Stop it. Get some help - lol'd so hard
Am still waiting for your hands-on video of pixel 2 \nIts taking long
Watched your vids a couple times, this one got me clicking on the Subscribe button. Very well done.
E X C E L L E N T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome man!! One of your best videos:)
The Michael Jordan gif killed me 😂😂😂
I wouldn't be surprised if Google put fake dislikes on this video. Or do something stupid like that 😂😂
are the smartphone manufactures work with youtube reviewers to get a better review than to give the best to their consumers? there's a blurry line there ;-)
Sir \nIf u have an extra action cam \nCan you send it\nWant to start my youtube challenge
how much Apple pays you?
haha sounds like FAKE NEWS when they headline these DxO mark scores
That Come Fly With Me clip though! Hilarious!
And this is why I’m glad his reviews lack ratings. You actually have to listen to what he says
Well done MKBHD - not seen / heard anyone put it better than this. I like DXO software, in fact I use their filmpack as part of my workflow, but don't agree with their mobile ratings, especially when they never tested  or bother to test the Lumia 950/XL. All the best MKBHD.
Best video ever... By any tech reviewer ever(at least to me)... Loved it... Laughed so hard too(while watching a review video)... Keep em coming...👍
Marques, please review sony mdr1000x . How do they stack up against the Bose QC35?
dude you are one unique human being! good job
Hey man can you do a video on 'Light L16' that pocket camera with 16 seperate lenses !!!
This is really brave of you MKBHD. Thank you for bringing this to light!
Is there any credence to the upcoming Nokia phones on YouTube esp the Nokia 10 max because it sounds better than any phone at least in theory?!
Any chance of reviewing the new crop of airpod rivals, E8's, Sony 1000, JBL Free. Etc
That's why mkbHD is the best smartphone tech reviewer!
Marques Janu
THAT SHADE YOU THREW AHAHAHA xD
word
Technology idubbz
Excellent video
Lgv30 what is expected dxo score ?
A red helium costs around 50k whereas pixel 2 costs 1k max. I don't think the difference between both of them would be that low to have a difference of just 10 points on dxo scale.
This is clean clear and unbiased journalism..!
Can you make a video about waterproof rating? Ipx stuff?
one if the best videos made by you, damn u made this so informative and entertaining 👌👌
This is why you watch MKBHD..
journalists are the money dogs these days
Good detailed explanation. Great video appreciate it. Thank you MKBHD!
I’m not a prolific commenter but wanted to say, this is a great video and really helpful. Fits quite nicely alongside the phone camera comparison video you did a while back. Ultimately, the most important thing here is taste and knowing how to dig a little deeper into the DxOMark scores to better inform how to achieve this taste is really useful. Thanks.
But the phone is so UGLY... \nI'll save my money instead
Internet needed this video
LG V30 REVIEW
Preach!
Great video. Greets from Cuba.
Fantastic explanation Marques! Cudos to you

Great job Marques!
Best @MKBHD VIDEO till date.
I'm sure your story will help some other people☺. Peace to you.👍
What a coincidence, I missed these videos because I was on a cruise as well.🛳
Suí síos 😂😂😭I love how u teach them some Irish
Wish was as brave like you 😑🤐
Omg anna’s Bianca voice is so funny. “Oh she’s so stupid”😂
Doesn't Anna just seem so healthy and happy recently? 💙
how is it that I'm in second year and Emillia and Eduardo have better irish than me ...... lol
Jonathan I work in an EYFS class and reading a lot at home DEFINITELY helps kids in their school progress! Emilia and Eduardo are both very smart xx
Thanks for the official hand shake Jonathan. Lol😊🙂😄
This world is shit 😐
I'm so happy that at the start of the video they gave me an answer to my geography homework and we had to know what Budapest was the capital of 😂😂😂
Irish sounds like a language I can speak called Gaelic
Jonathan is such a good dad
Anna was so funny in this vlog, I just love her xxx
Jonathan is the best!
Anna I think you lost your bonkers hahahaha love you guys
I just love Anna
HAAA!! Anna's Bianca's voice is everything
I’m from Hungary 😊living in Uk 😊
Anna you are amazing with that voice!!!!....I love it~~~Is UK the only place you can buy the smoothies???????
How beautiful is Anna guys??!! And hilarious too!!
Love watching u guys! It brings a smile to my face!💖 alessia is so adorable, emilia is so kind and clever ,Eduardo is so cute and happy, Anna is so gorgeous and Jonathon is so bubbly and sweet! I'll always watch your lovely videos! Xxxxx
As soon as he said #nevercopyanother I Started to copy someone
if you go to bing type in yotube and search at the nside there is a little picture of you guys the saconyjolys
We are all here to support you Jonathan. You were very brave to post the video. Well done Jonathan
Anna’s Bianca voice is hilarious 😆
Don't ignore signs of this happening to your children.
Anna needs to do a whole video just in the dogs voices. I love it !!
The fAct that you told people what  happened is incredibly brave, inspiring...and shows a LOT of strength...i hope it helps others who have sadly been in your situation...even if they don't feel so alone 💚💚 my heart breaks thinking of how many people have been victim of sexual assault 😢💚
Eduardo's laugh is the best !
Hahaha I love Anna’s bianca voice they are sooooo funny
When Johnathan was talking about those muffins all I could think about was that scene from mean girls; would you like me to assign someone to butter your muffin? 😂
Love love love Anna doing that voice over for the dogs!! 😂😂
Alessia might be the happiest little human on earth 😂❤
Omg anna you kill me with the dog voices it's hilarious! Really looking forward to meeting you guys in Milton Keynes in a few weeks!
I love you guys so much! Such amazing parents ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a big inspiration Jonathan! Your story will help so many people. I love your family and have watched for over a year now 💗💗
Hahaha I love them their so Funny 😂 Jonathan is so brave also
I'm from Hungary 🇭🇺
That voice and clip though.... genius !!!!!
loving the photo in the background at the start, little squid.
So so proud of your bravery, Jonathan ❤❤❤
Anna is so funny, she had me dying in her Bianca voice
Jonathan you are so brave! Anyone who knows you is lucky to have you as a friend
Eduardo is THE sassiest little man and I am in love.
I love love love when Alessia flaps her arms and makes that joyful breathing noise! I just LOVE it and it makes me so happy. #precious
Anna, why don’t you just take an umbrella with you!!
You are such an amazing human Jonathon xxx
I want to see Eduardo take over the vlog for a day!
God Bless you,  Jonathan.  I can tell how hard that was for you to talk about. I was almost sexually assault when I was 6 by a close relative.  I ran away so nothing ever happened,  however it still haunts me every now and then.  It took me years to tell anyone about it. I'm not sure why,  because nothing happened.  I guess I was just ashamed and that it was my fault for trusting this person.  Just know,  that you're not alone.  I've told my husband and kids what happened and the loved me even more.  Im not sure how I would have felt if I hadn't ran away.
I freaking LOVE Bianca and her funny voice and EVERYTHING I can't with Bianca
Out you will feel better....
I like how that, despite the fact that you probably had a rough day when you released that video, you remained positive and happy for your kids. I know how hard that is. I have severe anxiety and it’s sooooo hard to be happy for anyone or anything. I don’t have kids but as hard as it is for me to remain happy during anxious times as a single adult with no kids I can only imagine how hard it must be to remain strong in front of your kids when you’re feeling crummy. I’m so sorry about what you went through Jonathan. I’m so happy that you have Anna and the kids to remind you that you’re a great person and Dad and to keep you on your toes and help you get this off your mind.
Alessia seems like such a happy well behaved baby all the time ❤❤
Anna is literally the funniest woman in the world! Love her to bits! I aspire to that woman!!! 💕
Anna couldn't look more beautiful 😍😍
I'm so proud of you for sharing your story. It's so important to open a dialogue for men to discuss their stories too.
Jonathon you helped me with that video you put up as a survivor myself... I admire you so much for speaking up ❤️ I’m coming to see you guys at the baby event at olympia next weekend 😀💙
Hahaha that was the best promotion for innocent 😂 Anna's bianca voice is my fave thing ahhaha amazing!!!
I'm glad you told your mom. I am very sure that the video you posted about your terrible experience helped so many people. You are brave And supported by so many.
Omg lmao Anna's accent for Bianca was everything lol so funny!!!
This video proves that some viewers jump to conclusions way too quick and it proves that no, we viewers don't really know anything because there's so much going on behind the scenes so who are we to speculate. I'm saying this because I was scrolling through the comments of yesterday's video and I saw people being mad about him not telling his mom before putting out the video. So this is for all of you. In your face.
Anna doing the dogs voices is the best. Dying for an episode of the dogs voiced by Anna.
I love when Anna voices the dogs 😂😂
OMGosh, I love that exasperated little breathy laugh that Alessia does when she's excited. Its much too cute!! 😍😍\nAwwww, ballet with Daddy!! How fun!! 💚💜💛\nI love the ending, haha!! When you talk for them its hilarious!! The little Bianca knit was so cute too.
It could be the newer food you’re feeding the pups, that’s causing the staining on their faces.
Jonathan  we can all\nappreciate your courage! Your a wonderful example of strength and character. Your family respects and adores you as do hundreds of viewers. So thank-you for your bravery and bringing another truth to the pitiful silence of sexual assault!
I say the darnn with what others think. It helped you and it will help others. The outcome will be way more good from your release. Well done.
First, thank you Jonathan for sharing your story. I’m sure that was incredibly difficult to do and I’m sorry you had to go through that and live with it. Second, my parents are on a cruise in Budapest as well! How funny!
The dogs voices kill me 😂
emilia at the end was soooooo funny!!!!!
Jonathan you are an amazing man, husband, father and friend to all of us. You are a brave brave man because not any man would have the guts to tell the world something like this. We love and support you. You are amazing because you didnt let this awful experiemce take over your beautiful peronsality, your ability to love and be happy. You are one of the few most amazing husbands a girl could ever want so loving and thoughtful to your wife, kids and friendlist friends !! WE LOVE YOU JONATHAN !!
Biancas voice
12 on trending!!! Xxx

4:20 That V8 🔥
Hi guys Alessia Emilia erdo
You guys make the cutest babies oml😩😍
How funnys the voice 😂
Anna doing bianca is absolutely hilarious 😂😂
Anna is so funny :)
Wow Anna...you look that this is such a struggle to get you child.  Whine...Whine...Whine...oh  my head hurts...  When are you going to be a nice person and parent?
This video is Clickbate
Boring unintelligent narcissist parents parade their children for YouTube views shocker
I don’t even know what the dislikes are thinking!!! This is so brave of you Jonathan 🌎
Well done for speaking out Johnathon, that can't have been easy to do. Anyone out there who sees this and has someone in their life making them do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell someone, a parent, a friend, a teacher, a sibling, a doctor, anyone and don't stop talking until someone helps you
I AM FROM GERMANY.PLEASE TALk SLOW.LOVE THIS FAMILY.KISSES
I was also sexually assaulted at the age of 6 I’m 13 now but I’m just wondering if I ever have kids wether I would tell them, so are you ever going to tell them?
Is mise ella!
Really good! Love his voice
Just what I needed on a Friday night! Does anybody hear this man singing? His voice is mesmerizing!
I don't need another Soulsavers album with Dave, I want new electro project with him !!! This song is simply perfect.
OmG💙 Gahan one of the most beautiful voices ever !
Great song. Love it!
Put Gore behind and you have the Depeche from 87-89-93. Sounds really great and very well produced!
What's the matter with all these morons commenting on Dave's demonic side because of the video??!!? Are you f..ing crazy?? 1) Dave has nothing to do with the concept of the video 2) his voice is a gift from God for all of us who have a soul 3) with what he's been through, no one - NO ONE - has any right to comment on his personal life 4) anyway, WHO CARES about moral implications??? Just listen and appreciate the music for what it is. Long Live Dave <3 And thax Kurt!
Best DM song in years!! Ops... :D
Holy shit, how fucking good was that.
Fucking amazing. Dave still got it.
DAVE GAHAN is a music god, a champion with no one else in his league! Just as good with his solo projects as with Depeche! He's the best!
The real DM sound. Thank U !  Great song,, I'm waiting to buy the whole CD
Great song!
Fantastic!
Perfecto love this song 🤙🏻👌🏻
Perfect! Thanks Kurt+Dave+Tim Team
Отлично, Дэйв!!!
Awesome!
Reminded to “Suffer Well”
matrix
Magnifique!!!
Love it
The best song of '17 until now
great  track, that  woman  is  really   Tall..  niice
Amazing! Dave should be the front. It’s different then Depeche Mode by tons. This is the future
Dave could sing the ABC Song with this soft voice and it would sound sexy to me...wonderful song...pure electronic 🎹
perfect description and personal evaluation...very successful,both the video,and the lyrics...❤️👑🖤
Oh Dave oH Dave   i 'll be waiting you
What the sound, what the powerful song was this. It will be becoming more popular  than i think.
just he voice dave it's so so nice
Dave could sing every song and make it famous and wonderful.. but his best is ONLY with Depeche Mode... from 1981 to 2017...
Your words were spoken Carefully chosen For me Each one a msg And insight To some degree   When I wake up My eyes are open I can see I can hear you All around me I feel free   There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through   Why am I nervous My hands they're shaking My heart it beats Your specter haunts me And taunts me I can't breathe   When I wake up My eyes are open I can see I can feel you All around me I can breathe   There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through   We're moving on We're moving on
I loved them a long time ago but fuck me! As pretentious and as same as an album full of DM songs as you are ever going to find.😴
Красота!
Excelente 😁
Incredible!
Sends chills down my spine
New songs​, eletro pop, synth pop.
Beautiful song
This sounds like a B side from the SOTU record that should've been the first single 😐😧😳SHEEEEEEZE that was good
The outro is perfect...great !!!
Sweet !
is it trevor or something
Electronic Music brought me here ✨
Masterpiece guys ! This is it !!!
wow amazing song with felling dark i love
Sounds like real synthy Depeche Mode, but here is very feeble non-catching refrain.
This Sound is very deep. \nThe Beat is very dark.  \nSometime we need dark and deep things in our Lifes.  \nBut if you sell yourself into the Darkness, you will never be the same Person anymore. It's your Choise, when you even sell your whole body and soul to the Darkness. Sorry Dave Gahan, but this is not my music and not my World. Satanic, Diobolic, whatever. Not every deep music is so dark like this Song, but l will only listen to the beauty of music itself. You have dissapointed me.
What a magical Song!! Kurt Uenala and Dave Gahan are a wunderful Team for pure electronic music
and THIS is what I expect DM music to sound like. perfect electronic stuff!
I have an absolute obsession with this song, I have no words  awesome
Great! I would like to be the deep underwater dancer for the next Dave Gahan video!!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coh2Pwj6H6k
I just love it!!!!!!
Absolut Perfect voice of Electronic music
gorgeous and very sexy melody to this! i just saw depeche mode at the hollywood bowl and this fulfils my post concert sadness lol great stuff :)
I really love this track. If I didn't know I could have sworn that this is a Depeche Mode single!! So good absolutely!!
Love it Dave Gahan  the master voice.
Pretty nice and peaceful song. Especially the voice of Dave Gahan too, makes this even better 🎶
I love Dave Gahan and the versatility of his deep dark Baritone 😍. However, i do not like the video at all (saved only by the shots of Dave himself) . Disturbing....but not in a good way. I shall just close my eyes and listen............
love at first sight. :)
why not in the spirit album?
Spectacular video, I love it, and well Dave, as always so flawless, is a pleasure to hear ... and watch it .... @ beautiful!
Excelente, la voz de Dave exquisita y sensual y la música oscura pero muy fresca. Me encantó más que los singles de spirit
Они не умеют делать плохую музыку и все тут! - They can't make a bad music and thats all! 
Fantastic Sounds !
wonderful

WOW Very nice sounds
the best (Y)
Bellissima la musica è la voce di dave sempre grandiosa e sensuale!! Questo pezzo è  travolgente! Lo adoro dal primo ascolto! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Not bad, but to be honest: The song doesn't really have a peak.
Słucham i słucham całkiem to dobre
I WANT THEM TO DO ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE SOUNDS OF THE UNIVERSE..  or another song like fragile tension or in symphony they really need to go back to that sound or speak and spell to bring the 80's sound back at least one song like dreaming of me that was a real good song
Klingt ein bischen wie And One. Geil aber nicht einzigartig. Da wird sich doch wohl der Meister nicht etwa was von einem seiner größten Fans etwas abgeschaut haben...?
LYRICS pleae. I love this song
worst song of 2017
Que video tan horrible !
Dave genual!!!!! Mais no me gusto la violencia del video!!primera vez en mil años.que no quedo contenta.
are you ppl all crazy? i think that if dave sing about raping your mother youll like it too bcs its dave...you are all sick, really! i loved dm, been fan 30 years but these is just weird...very weird...if you like what you see in this video then you must be very sick in your head or very evil...dave already sold his soul to devil...thats why hes still alive otherwise he wont be here ya know...get ur shit together ppl...and THINK!
1:06 perfect timing
Lol, I think you are the retardet person here xD
If they just learn to drive...
asuu lo a aplastado \n😱😱😱😨
Dear Russia your not exposed to have kids with your brother or sister cuz it sure seems like you guys do
@5:02 they steered into the crash. So dumb
Russian insurance must be at a premuim
they should just ban driving, there
Damn I would hate to live in Russia
I am just wondering from where do russians get their driving license
One schmuck is leading the green and the other is trimming the red--what did you THINK was going to happen?!
The drivers may be retardet (sic), but your spelling is retarded.
Russia love car crash.
2:28 got what he deserved BMW driver !!!
What idiots learn to drive
WTF😱😱😱😱
But yeah it’s true automatic cars cannot be controlled @ higher speeds when braked in emergency 🚨
wow... the fuck is wrong with these people?
Yay, Ryan's Cooking Show! 10/10!!
omg Ryan's Cooking Show pls make this a thing!! with cheesy music and everything!
I am REALLY impressed by that transition at 5:07 Grace, well done!\n(I genuinely love you guys' creativity and content in general, but this one just really stood out to me...)
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Big spider??  It's so spindly!  Just a cellar spider; totally harmless.
I see Ryan likes spices, garlic and basil. An handsome englishman who likes mediterrean ingredients?\nActually that nice pasta is some kind of Amatriciana, rather than Carbonara. They both have bacon inside but they are totally different; i adore them both anyway.
I think He is good at cooking. Great
Good day to you madam
Mmm, I want Ryan's cooking
Love you guys! Xx❤️\n\n\n\n\nAnd your vlogs! Xx❤️
Ur vlogs r so cool
4:00-4:08 vibes 😂 same
ryan's so funny :D
Fumbs up!
Wow!\nHow old is the building?\nLooks quite old.  Lots of work.
Yay, food! but what is 5:23?
What's that white paste he squirts out of a tube? He used it last time too. Mayo? Some UK thing?
How does this have less views than Eminems terrible freestyle?
This should be 1# on trending until the release of the film
HOLY COW I GOT GOOSEBUMPS LIKE IF YOU DID TOO!
we get it, you love intense trailers
The dislikers were like\n”Wow, dis i like”
I know what I'm doing when I get some money (booking them tickets 😂)
I have already seen the movie because my dad made it! And i also got 5 Million dollars!\n\n\n\n12 y/o’s now days.
Dec.15 is my birthday! This is like a birthday gift!
i need see that. movie
I get it, luke is the last jedi
I WONDER IF REY LOSSES HER HAND ON THIS INSTALLMENT.
*OH GOD I HOPE SHE IS EVIL*
I am hoping that after the words, the film starts with the attack on Luke's temple, and then jumps to Rey handing Luke the saber.  I have heard the film will have flashbacks, but I am really hoping we revisit that whole thing right at the beginning.
yeah ok but im still waiting for the new tim and eric movie
Hmm, I’m not sure about this one. Hopefully not as disappointing as 7.
Did disney make this?
Guess nobody is going to say anything about the scene where Finn is leading the First Order troops or when they show Snoke torturing Rey...
The trailers for TFA were *way* better than the movie.   Let's hope it's not the same for TLJ....
Kylo ren looks like patrick from it
ren gonna join the dark side from last image of the tralier the way she says i need someone to show me through this
It feels so unreal that we only have 2 months to go!!
I can't wait...\n\nUntil youtubers start ripping into this movie.
2015: the force awakens\n\n2017: the last Jedi\n\n2019: from his nap
First Han now Leia? Kylo needs to calm his crossguards
This looks amazing can't wait to see it
i need more cute wookiees  to join the fight...
OH SHOOT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST STAR WARS IM SUCH A BIG FAN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I CANT WAIT MUCH LONGER
Directed by Michael Bay
im calling the police on kyle ran
i cant wait for this movie to come out
I seen the force awakens trailer before it didn't scare me then, but when i watched the last jedi trailer and realized the trilogy is suddenly ending fast, it does now....
Trailer: This is not going to go the way you think\nMe: That's disappointing, the movie looked good...
OMGG IM SO EXCITED LIKE IF YOU ARE TOO XD
any one wanna talk about that the star wars logo has changed from yellow to red?
got crazy chills and goosebumps from this. well done!
Where are my Knights ?

Roses are red violets are flowers i saw raw untamed power
Everybody is shining in this trailer from the hero's to the Villains. An amazing trailer
This has to be one of the best trailers I've seen
literally the best movie trailer ever made. Music makes it all
It's every day bro with The Jedi knight flow Slaughtered all the younglings in the church never done before Passed all the competition by Killing all my friends And we got the Death Star too and We coming with the crew This is the 501st rebels what you Gonna do

The music in this trailer is one of the best arrangements for any Star Wars project and is really what makes this epic. Did John Williams arrange it?
They are ruining Star Wars...won't see it
IM SO NOT EXCITED star wars already got ruined with force awakened
Luke to be overpowered by Mary Rey Sue!
Don't know what to think of this. Probably going to be average. Possibly below.
This spoiled so much
What about b8
wait...how did kylo ren get his helmet back, because in the first trailer for this movie kylo ren's helmet was broken
Disney has killed star wars, why does Rey need jedi training? Shes already overpowered and can use her jedi skills without training, Kylo is like the worst villain ever, you dont get a sense that hes a powerful villain, hes an emotional little boy with daddy issues, star wars became too pc to enjoy! Too much cgi does the opposite effect its trying to display
God! what I wouldn't do for a remake for the prequels with these special effects and good acting .
This video is almost passed the first trailer of the last Jedi
I’ll pee my pants if I see this in the cinema
Anyone else notice where Chewie is sitting in the Falcon? Han was always on the other side, so was Lando and Rey when they were flying it, so the other seat must be main pilots seat which means Chewie is the co-pilot and not flying it and someone else is on the other side of the Porg flying the Falcon, might just be Rey again or maybe Lando is back? Who else could be flying it?
I wonder why Luke is scared of and is Kylo going kill Leia?
Wait carie Fisher is dead
Wait did disney buy starwars im confused
Love the way they faked out Kylo Ren extending his hand to her. We all know he's probably using a force grab on his lightsaber or something but they make it look pretty synced to her turning to the darkside ;)
im lost star trek has gotten very confusing
Hey look it's a copy of the empire strikes back just like force awakens was basically a new hope
Thanks for spoiling the hole movie
Wow. I really don’t like that look of Chewbacca there.
73 Questions with XXXTENTACION
That ass though
Listen, buddy, we need to establish some ground rules here..\nYou do NOT interrupt Daisy Ridley rapping Eminem..\nGood? Good..
She looks like she'd be the best to just hang out with honestly :) And props for mentioning Keeping Up Apperances, that's low key the best british comedy!\n\nDude should've asked how she looks so much like Keira Knightley lol
Oh God, I love her...she's so charming.
I see a white wall
Foul mouthed, no wonder. She supports the Arsenal
Rey is a grey Jedi confirmed
I love Daisy so much oh my gosh I CANT
She's gorgeous...rapping to Eminem's 8-Mile: Lose yourself
i just fell in love with her. She's now up there with Blake Lively and Emma Watson.
This is like a POV porno. I wish it was.
Except Mr Robot is not on Netflix.
I didn't know she has sex in Star Wars The Last Jedi!
2:19 well I Bite my finger nails and sometimes my toe nails.  Mostly forget to use toe nail clippers.
she has a broken screen. she's a normal person after all. :')
She got me when she sang Lose Yourself. Love her.
He should have asked where her tits went?
I feel like this is the interview for a casting couch lmao
I'm in love! We even prefer our tea the same. Find me Daisy!
Girl be sellin' sunshine,\n(Girl be sellin' sunshine...)\nLookin' so fine.\n(Lookin' so fine...)\nCan't believe my eyes, going out of my mind.\n(Be my girlfriend!)\nWanna ask you, lady, to forever be mine.\n(Hope she's single!)\nTry to keep it cool, Panda, just improvise.\n(You can do it!)\nShe's the kind of girl that makes a guy realize!\n(Can't be nervous!)\nWanna buy you flowers and spend $9.99!\n(She's so priceless!)\nGirl be sellin' sunshine,\n(Girl be sellin' sunshine...) (2x)
7:11 she is giving him the middle finger lol
Keeping Up Appearances is such a funny show.
Oh man what a fox!  Until the words Arsenal were spoken.  Class with ass is what she is!
Can you do Zendaya or Tom Holland next? Or both of them together!!!
Is it just me or does this seem like the intro to a porno?
This guy is so fucking creepy
Daisy: ooh!\nInterviewer: The date’s with you
Did he call her baby?
her voice is a lot like kiera knightley’s
this feels like a porno
Shes very down to earth and confident and elegant and beautiful.
That rapping was insaneeee!!!! She's so cool.😉
this is so practiced. and reminds me of a intro of porn video.
Today is my 21st wedding anniversary.  I'm afraid I have to tell my wife I am leaving her for Daisy Ridley.
Did he call her Baby after giving her the sunflower? Wtf? Creep.
I don’t know why I watch these.
Did he really say go jay z to an Eminem song
She is so fuckin white
Kylo Ren has obviously made 2,000 YouTube accounts to increase the number of dislikes this video has...
I was just hoping this was going to turn into a porn.
Yeah Daisy is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000 % the perfect girl.
Its confirmed we are made for each other.
gf material all the way
Wait a minute this was 74 questions
I want to put my mouth parts on her 😉
This looks like a porn intro
She is a woman I would respect
'People do nothing' is a must watch also
Only question I want to know.... Can we go on a snowboarding trip together?
The format of these interviews is incredibly awkward and cringey.
The real question is, does Vogue realize how much this feels like an intro to a porn video? They have to be aware of this.. right? Right?
Why do all these interviews make them seem they have adhd lol
Was she wearing a thong?
That ending spoiler troll was so funny!! I laugh every time!!!!
Do one with Miley
she would be a better lara croft though
I'd spunk on her forehead
Literally checked to see if Mr Robot was on Netflix and was disappointed to see it actually wasn’t there
This woman has enough charm to power an entire solar system ten times over. Even then, extra points for Mulan, Eminem, and Wicked in the song segment! And French and Japanese! Just stop. You're already too awesome!
So glad she corrected the soccer to football lol
It's more than a little weird how something so planned is made to appear so spontaneous and casual.
Dude, I would pay $$ just to see her as Lara Croft!!
This is reminiscent of a couch audition...who knows what im talking about? *wink wink*
This looks like a porno intro
This was all very  spontaneous.
Mom's spaghetti
She reminds me so much of Kiera Knightly.
porno intro vibe

how to fall in love within 73 questions...
Shocker, a tutorial using something new from Morphe.
Does anybody know what camera shes using? Thank you! ❤️❤️
When are you going to post the collab with @KathleenLights
Do you have any friends with hooded eyelids who would let you do their makeup on camera??? You're so good at the teaching part of your tutorials and I feel like I could really get it if you could show us what to do to create a crease for hooded eyes. Just wondering. Love you and your channel!
Jaclyn Hill What bottom mascara do you use?
Whaat! This is weird! I tuned in and you are wearing my necklace! So weird.... this has happened before with earrings, hair color??? Are we telepathically communicating? Ha!
Girl, you are an artist! Also, I just noticed, the winged eyeliner trend is gone. Finally! Every pretty eye make up done used to be covered up with the wing eyeliner.
Is morphe going to restock your favorites set?
I love every look you do. You could wipe dirt on your face and it would slay! I like the backdrop but I do prefer no backdrop. It just feels more natural, like we're just girlfriends talking doing makeup!
I would love to see a halo eye look from you...either with your beautiful palette or this new stunning 3502 palette(mine will hopefully be here this week 😉)
when is morphe going to restock your fav brush set!!
and this has honestly been my favorite video jaclyn has ever made! i love the no background music, her attitude, the look, everything about it is amazing. loved it so much
Your energy and joy is so contagious!! 😍 I'm sitting on the couch watching your video and my husband looks at me and asks what's so funny because your constantly making me LOL 😂\nAnd I've already accepted and talked myself out of getting this pallete because I have the original 35O and the matte and shimmer version. Do I really need another version? Lol I know in my head hell yes!! But my hubbys like no, you already have 3 of those lol
i can her the movie ....awesome haha
The foundation on her lips is making me cray! But that eye look 😍
I’m obsessed with your pallet I use it everyday!! It’d be so cool if you sent me your pallet for my [few] subscribers for a giveaway! I’d be like BITCHHHHHHHH😍😍✨💗💗💗💗
Question: do you spray your brush with fix plus before you get the shadow on the brush or after? I’ve always sprayed it first, but just wondering which way is “correct”
I love the background 😍 and the eye look
WHEN YOU COME HOME TO AN UPLOAD FROM BAE
This look would be bomb for Halloween  👻
Just saw on IG that your pallet is coming to Ulta. I just want to say Congratulations!!!!! Can't wait 😊
I'd love to see all your makeup all spread out on the floor, I just wanna see how much you have 😂 you're videos are ammmaazzzinngggg I've been watching them nonstop ALL WEEK. I just bought your palette and I cannot WAIT for it to come in the mail omgggg
Morphe is so affordable.  And they are pretty great for the price.  So.. I like this.
Not here to look at your back drop, I'm here to watch you slay your make up! Lol
Can you do a Green look for us???
this is everythingggg! xo from my channel to your’s <3
I feel bad that u always have to apologize for being yourself cause so many people have said such awful shit , I loved this tut and your eye makeup is so pretty thank u for sharing love you
Did jack ever say what foundation she's wearing in the video? It looks so good and foundations she uses regularly seem to work with me.
I want her pallette so badly but idk if I should lol is it so worth it guys?
I love your natural backgrounds, but the glitter ones are so pretty every now and then!
The color looks great
At last I can see your videos! It’s been a mouth that I don’t have power or phone signal but today I got some signal and got to see your video! Xoxo from Puerto Rico! ❤️
I love the black nails
Anyone know where that necklace is from?
Jaclyn, my girl can you do another look using your palette ? Please & thank you !!
I love when you tubers spend so much time building up colour only to cover it up with dark shadows
I'm not a fan of the backdrops
This look is so amazing you're a boss
Can anyone tell me why I can't find her on Instagram?!?! I'm so sad I love her.
Love your videos, not a fan of the backdrop x :)
So many rude comments. Some thoughts are better left in your head, people. Have the decency and self control to fuck off and not comment if you don't like someone, the way they look, how they dress, etc. Why waste your life watching someone you hate, just to leave a rude comment? Some growing up needs to happen on the internet. ☕️ y'all can't deny that. \n\nDo yo thang, Jaclyn. You're good as fuck at makeup and I don't give a fuck to judge what you do in your personal life because it's not mine. Be happy and don't let fucking losers play you. You the queen, honey girl.
Will morphe restock your 'Jaclyn hill's favourite brushes' kit? Please I need the set and it's sold out!!
I’m living for the bloopers lol 😆
This look is so incredible!! It’s absolutely beautiful!! 😍
THIS. LOOK. IS. PERFECT. I've been dying to dig into Royalty myself, but I just can't figure out what to do. Thank you!!!!!
What do you use to get your lips soooooo SMOOTH??
what foundation did she use?
I love this look! It is seriously creative. I really appreciate that you created this because it's quite different from the typical Youtube looks we see all the time..got me feeling inspired Jaclyn!
Does anyone know the brand of her translucid powder that she  put under eyes (the white one)
💜
Wow awesome yay..
More bloopers 😂😂😂 please
What lashes did u use
UNBLOCK ME
😍😍😍
good look
💜💜💜💜
I love you ❤️
Jaclyn, can recommend a good brand lipliner for me and also, what is a good universal color lipliner that goes with everything?
The background is so distracting I can't focus
Please tell me you won't ever stop selling you palette at morphe? I have so many presents to get for birthdays and Christmas and things but I have so many to get that I can't get them all now.
Bring back the red hair ya hot babe
Ok I get why the transition colors but didn't get why you put on a shimmery red on your lid and then cover it completely with the purple one, I didn't see a difference if you just apply the purple one and avoid the shimmer red shadow... Anyway it is a very beautiful look
This eye look is orgasmic.. like it's so fucking BEAUTIFULLLLLLL
I love watching your videos, I love the look but I honestly just like to feel like I'm hanging out with you hahaha.
You and Job at the end, so funny!  Now I am seriously wanting that morphe palette.   Jaclyn I think your tutorials are amazing.  Yours and Desi's have that vibe of really 'teaching' about what you are doing.
What palette is the first one? I don't remember her saying.
What is the setting spray that you used?
Such a pretty eye tutorial!!! So much gorgeous!
Love the purple background!!!
It's disgusting how it's acceptable for women to paint their faces
You’re so beautiful, please do outfit videos 💕 and I’m not quite a fan of the backdrop it’s too distracting (:
Girl I’m HERE for the glitter! Glitter it UP!
Go girl, love you
I’m so excited!! I’m receiving your palette in about two weeks and now I’m probably going to end up buying the 35O 2 and do this look!! You inspire me so much and I’m living for this look. 😍 Love you Jaclyn. 💓
I do like the glitter background but it’s making it hard to see the makeup bits like my eyes are being distracted by the glitter. LOL. IDK. Maybe it’s just me.
I love your real background or your lifestyle background sooooo much better!
This look is very on trend, very seasonal love it!
Love the video & you Jaclyn 💜💜💜
Absolutely LOVE that purple backdrop! I want it! lol
I'm jumpy too. You seemed like yourself in this video. Warm and loving. It's nice to see. XO
This eye look totally reminds me of Hocus pocus colors 😂😂😂
i swear you slay everything
Beautiful 💚
Love this look!
Lol the bloopers!! I love u Jacklyn
Am I the only one that has trouble blending after using fix plus + a shadow on the lid? It ends up kind of chalky-ish (can’t really describe it) maybe I’m using too much fix plus? What am I going wrong?! 🤦🏽‍♀️😫
Bloopers are amazing. I'll be a part of 1-2% that actually talk about the look cause girl that was a shit ton of layer that I can't get. Its like a cake, its a lot of work but so worth it
I love this necklace 😍
i just got your palette!!!! I would love to see maybe a serie with a lot of different looks :) xx\n\n(and when you have done a serie with your palette do it with another brand palette maybe :)
Hi jaclyn hopefully you can mention.dupes for this or any tutorial..the only morphe i have is ur first palette and the morphe.350. Sometimes the colors look different on the video then the actual shade.
I love this look!! I could never pull it off but you make it look so bomb!!! On the backdrops, I like the variety. The glitter backdrops are pretty to look at and don’t distract you from the actual video. And then the natural backgrounds are better for your more casual videos 😊😊😊😊 I also love how you describe every step you’re taking when applying eyeshadow. You’ve helped me learn how to properly blend my eyeshadows
I wouldn't of ever thought to do purple with this. Love it!!
Can you please show the names of the brushes you're using? Makes it so much easier for us beginners.
So talented!!
Such a gorgeous look!!
You always look greasy.
Biittccchhh! Obsessed with this look 💜

Colinfurze, I give you a challenge. How about for Halloween, you make a eye scanner so that kids can get candy. But if they try to do it again. The computer won't give them candy, so pretty much it's and eyes scanner candy dispenser. That is my challenge for you.

I had a problem with a neighbours cat, which used my garden as a toilet.  I made an almost identical box but put a PIR on it so that the cat got sprayed anytime it walked past.  I'm guessing the cat didn't like it very much, because he took his business elsewhere.

Make A Drift Lawnmower or Racing Lawnmower
Could totally use this in a similar fashion to the airsoft gun doorbell...
This one is bad. That's not a good circuit, electronics are in the same box as the hydraulic valve, without spacers and not only you messed up the relay NO/NC contacts, you didn't know why common needs to be connected. The reason is that this way, you can also use it to switch 230V mains if you want. Seems like a useless project, since the two 9V batteries likely won't last a week in NO configuration or even a day in NC configuration (those solenoid valves draw a lot of pixies and the relay box is just inefficient).
Happy B-day colt i read your book and i saw your b-day is now today surprisingly huh.. Jake and Erin are both on 14 wierd..

are we not going to talk about jubilee clips
shouldn't the black (ground) wire from the solenoid valve go to the common terminal on the circuit board?

Guys! Stop Commenting This is Boring He Did It For Himelf And Recorded it...
Why make one when you can just buy the parts and put them together for cheap? Oh he did...
I have always wondered where the name jubelee clip comes from( not sure about the spelling), could someone explain please?
Colin that Relais is a potential free one they are *ALL* Like that.
colinfurze!! i hate you dude!!! you are too damn good mann.. you just makes me ashamed of myself and my skills :P haha this is a really good idea i'm from Denmark and i don't know if its common other places but in denmark you can buy/rent a little garden too grow stuff or just enjoy and must people have a little house on them too, its nice for people living in apartments and not having a yard. but its fucking cold in Denmark so if the water is still open doing the winter, it will freeze and blow the pipes.. so this gave me and idea too be able too close of the water from home when its starts freezing in October ;P, guess i need a long range remote, my garden is about 2 km from my home but still! \nand a little obvious advice. when making holes in plastic... use heat. warm a knife or whatever.. take it from a guy who have build more bongs then Ron De Jeremy has appeared in porn :P\n-good day you bastard..
Wouldn't you connect the negative from the solenoid to the GRND, between the NC and NO? Since I was under the impression that ground is negative and there are these three position switches that have one lead in at the center and  a lead out to either side for the two differen on stages and the off in the middle.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, please! :)
I think it's possible you have misunderstood the way to wire up that board. Normally you don't have to connect anything from the PWR IN to the three relay connections. Your wiring of the relay connections is unusual and may be the root of your problem. So, one solenoid contact goes to battery ground, but the other goes just to N/O and NOT to N/C. When your signal reaches the unit, the contacts switch over and the solenoid gets power. You might want to try it
Bring back the old Collin
why are you shooting at 50fps?
You should make a mini bike (taco bike)
Relays for the most part will always need a common connection. Also you would wire using NO contact of the relay meaning no current flows to the valve under normal conditions. When you activate the relay (button) you close the circuit allowing current flow to the valve.
Beware that if you are using two or more lithium batteries, do not. I repeat DO NOT short them. They have to be wired properly or you will get hurt. Batteries may explode.
Time to build one for my aquarium. Remote controlled water changes hell yeah lol
8:40 That absolutely makes sense and makes the board more flexible.\nWhen you want to switch a 120V or 240V device you shouldn't power the receiver and the relais with that voltage. So you need two different power inputs.
Can u make a flying car
If the diameter of your hose is too small, dip the end in hot water for a while to make it pliable so you can force it onto/over the fitting.. Or as Colin might say, Pop the end of yer hose in a fresh hot cup of tea, and it will come out a little bit stretchy and you can bang it right on there.
Here in the states, we call those jublie clips hose clamps, but I like the British name better. 😁
Hey I got an idea for you to do I'm making a real school bus that looks like it can fly but it does hovers in there but a bus can I see in the government apartments in to the scenery glad you are where I live

This is the best Halloween tutorial I have seen yet!!!
Love you girl! I’ve been watching your videos for years! I personally never wear makeup and if I do it’s only eye liner and mascara but none the less i enjoy all of your videos!
I LOVE your Halloween videos so much!!! I think you're on the same level as special fx makeup artists cause idk how the hell you come up with this stuff on your own it's so creative and original!! I wish I had money to buy this stuff cause I wanna try this look! Can't wait for the next one!!!

Such a good Halloween idea!

You did such an amazing job!! 👍🏻
This was so scary looking, I live 🎃

Immediately liked it when I heard fuckity fuck fuck, penis
This was awesome, really enjoyed it.\nTotally unrelated, but can I say, I ordered your latest colab with Ciate and it came in last week and I have never owned or used Ciate before.  Girl, this palette is gorgeous and so versatile and honestly, I can't stop using it.  I used it yesterday, got SO many compliments on my makeup it was getting embarrasing but you know what really shook me?  I left my house at 8 am and did not return home till midnight and you know what, other than very mild smearing under my eyes, it was totally intact as if I just did it and I did NO touch ups and it was even a rainy day.  Worth every penny and great job so I just wanted to tell you that.
My god, i always like your videos but man, that is awesome! Wish aussies got into halloween!
This was fucking awesome, havnt seen anyone do a look like this one b4!    :) am loving the other channel Seba Y Chloe, So cool :)

LOVE THIS!!! been watching since the dawn of time chloe like seriously x
I love your personality! I was wondering if you've thought about doing the haul videos you use to do or even your vlogging! Those were some of my favorites to watch!
I teach high school English. We are doing childhood storybook characters for our department’s Halloween costumes. I’d love to see what character you’d choose. I want it to be scary but not too gory, and I also have to talk and move a lot in it. Any ideas from anyone are greatly appreciated!! Everyone is doing more traditional child stories like Mother Goose, you know? I was thinking Little Red Riding Hood, but I’m not sure. PS: I’m on a budget and school dress codes apply. Thank you!
This is one of my favourite Halloween makeup tutorials I've ever seen! You go girl
So much hard work! Love this ❤❤
This is totally awesome! Makes me want to go out and by some special effects stuff, because you made that look so good! I'd probably say fuck even more times though

You are freaking Awesome. Love these tutorials and You 💜
Here am I interacting
LOVE how creative this look is!!!! <3
I think this is my all time favourite Halloween look!!! 😻
I guess I’m the minority I don’t hear anything special or remarkable in this rendition.
With Trent and Atticus, of course it's brilliant.... ❤👌
What a shit show. This isn't even as good and powerful as the original theme and it's a nutless rendition that's bordering on elevator music. Hard fail, for fanboys only.
I KNEW when I saw Trent's name on it, it would be freaking amazing!!!
I heard good things. Will post my reaction after I watch
The most remarkable thing they captured was the dissonance of the original score.  I'm sure the low budget and technology at the time prevented Carpenter from editing the music properly, which created flawed, out of pitch notes which, coincidentally enough, added to the sense of unease that the movie imbued within the viewer.  To capture that essence of imperfection shows how much love and dedication they put into this rendition.
Ehhhhhhhhhh......... These guys ripped off that Lincoln Park song!
Did anyone else have sort of an ear shutter in the last few seconds? For me it seems to happen when music gets so chaotic, and then suddenly calm. It's so strange that music can trigger something physiological and involuntary.
How the fuck do they do THIS?!!
This must be what it's like inside Michael's head😶
wasn't sure at first but i dig
I need this on vinyl..Maxi 12 or 7
Halloween The Game: Sega Genesis
Secret Chiefs 3 does a fantastic rock version of this.
This is  as good as the outcast themes
I wonder what Profondo Rosso (the original) would sound like?
So much better than the original. The original was ok but this proves that adding a whole bunch of stuff could improve it. I like Halloween. Hopefully they'll remake the original movie and just add stuff to make it better. I like stuff that makes old stuff better.
Is this official for the new one ??
Not as good as the original :/ i don't see why so many people like this version better.
this is super Impressive it makes me wonder what Trent version of a Halloween remake would be since Rob Zombie is such a white trash hack and damaged Halloween to the point of no return....... 
There's a real David Lynch vibe in the sound mixing!
Pretty much what I expected. In a good way.
I just gotta say, all the nay-sayers and haters simply just don't fathom Trent's genius music. I feel sorry for them. But not too much, I'm too busy listening to this epic fucking song right here 😁🙌🏻
Don't fuck with originals.
Excellent rendition!! Truly captures the dread people get when Michael shows up.
Good.. pretty, pretty, pretty good. but.. Disasterpeace and the It Follows soundtrack, which was clearly influenced by the original Halloween theme a lot.. that's pretty damn awesome.
I guess you could say he nine inch nailed it.
Grammy! Love it. Like a grammy means anything anymore.
Is this for the 2018 film?
FUCK ME UP BITCH MY WIG IS ALL THE WAY IN HADDONFIELD
Anyone know if this will be in the next movie?
Was enjoying it till all that noise interrupted the mood, i'll have me some 78 please..
At 6:31 I can imagine Michael running to get his victim
Where you at John 5?
I can only imagine what Reznor and Ross could do with The Shape Stalks
I think i just came...
That hard shit at the end !
Fuggin awesome!! If you like this check this out https://youtu.be/5_9uBaRJ2eA\nA full thematic journey into darkness
This song is for the new film? I love it. Very creepy and oldfashioned. Cool final.
:49 to get to the start of the song #YoureWelcome
Thought I was playing METROID for a minute, there.
When does it start?
Fuuuuuuu... I wish i could hit Like more than just once
Halloween still works because the story is simple.  Michael Myers was a psychopath since birth and we don't know why.  One night he escapes and walks among us in suburbia picking us off one by one.  Simple yet brilliant.  Done by the right talent and filmmakers it can be and could always work.
Meh. \n\nI wanted to like this, but meh.
That bed sheet Michael would make an awesome wallpaper!
Sorry, but all I hear is a bunch of white noise with the vague sound of Carpenter's theme within it. Too bombastic.
This is brilliant,  just stunning.
http://www.soundincense.com/writings \nLoved the sound design. Here's my poetic interpretation of the track. All hail trent and atticus! \m/
In order to make the new Halloween film work, it has to be set in the 70s or early 80s. Serial killers like Myers worked better 30+ decades ago because they can exploit the limitations of technology back then. No cell/smart phones, no internet, different music, clothing, and creepier sense of danger.
I like to see this Halloween music by Trent reznor I love it
Is that the Kubrick sound underneath it all?
Cool. Gave it a thumbs up. Not as good as the original though.
I've never heard of Atticus Ross.
This is great for what it is. But I like the original best because the mood isnt exxagerated like most modern horrors which i think makes them more fun than scary to watch

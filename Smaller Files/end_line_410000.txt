Possible Strictly winner??!!
OMG love this girl. Amazing and only week 2. It's gonna be fantastic final. Betting on Alexandra, Aston and Debbie in final.
This dance!!! OH MY GOODNESS
Brilliant.
😍😍😍
On da floooorrrr
9
Honestly rewinded this dance more than 10 times last night. Parents got annoyed so I went to bed- secretly keeping watching on YouTube. You're my faves guys- literally was dreaming last night I was dancing with Gorka
Get um Alex!
My favourite couple on Strictly Come Dancing this year love them!
Watched this back so many times now. Mainly, because at least the first 10 times I couldn't take my eyes off of Gorka, he's sooo pretty!!! Alexandra, though absolutely smashed it! You go girl!
No she did no just slay my life
The best in years since Alesha and fit Gorka too! Loved this in ironic Spanish
I am now at the age where I have started to watching Strictly.. Where is my pipe and slippers?
My new single Two Sides To You is now available on Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, GooglePlay and more! \nHead over to my Facebook page to get the links! \nFacebook.com/SayshaWilliamsMusic. Xo
I love strictly come dancing
I Also Think Alexandra & Gorká Would Earn The 2017 Glitterball!
I'm so glad this _hopefully_ means Gorka will get to stay in for the long run this year. I'm still bitter that he and Tameka were voted out in week 3 last year. I hope this is his year!
Oh my god\nHow beautiful is the male dancer!!!!!
I normally hate the Paso but this was so good :)
British clapping annoys the crap out of me. And i'm British.
If only people were as passionate about spirituality and humanity as they are about dancing lol.
Wow what a performance  , never ever seen a pass like that . Alexandra  you can dance
This would have been amazing at any stage... but for week two?  Outstanding!
Alexandra is just beyond talented, she owned x-factor and now Strictly too. She’s a superstar.
Alexandra Burke wow she was once a singer...
Genuinely thought Alexandra was one of the professionals in this episode omdsss
She was so hot and fiery I couldn't take my eyes off her... and Gorka had his gorgeous chest out! =P It was a dance worthy of a 10 or two; and if it wasn't only week two, I think we might have seen it.
I used to love her on X Factor but damn. Her dancing is as good as her singing!
she is an amazing dancer... she is a bit smug but honestly this is an unbelievable performance by her for week 2 of the show and not much experience
Great dance for Week 2. 9/10
They are smoking hot….Thank hmmm Gorka has a partner that can dance so we can see him in full view! Yum Yum Yum!!!!! Can’t wait for next week
Can't believe what I'm watching considering it's only the second week. AMAZING!
AMAZING FIREY HOT PASSION SOMEONE HELP COOL DOWN THE FLAMES!
Blooming heck that was amazing!
Alexandra and Gorka are simply the best better than all the rest better than anyone who's ever been on the show before things can only get better by the strength and sheer excellence of this dance
Alexandra didn't came to play !
Naturally Get Rid of Pigmentation & Dark spots \nhttps://youtu.be/YEwsstcNSl0
I'm still amazed at this & it's only the 2nd week!! Thrilled for Gorka who went out too soon last year!!!
I'm probably the only one who didn't enjoy this dance. I like power and attack but she came across as psychotic. I liked her dance last week more.
Hmm, I was thinking before it started: this'll be ok... 0.12 BAM!!! Jump-spin and the fireworks exploded. Definitely worth the score and the standing ovation from CRAIG that it received!
Jls and the Saturdays face ...like WTF face lol hilarious
She's still a little sloppy and lacks fluidity, so let's not sugar coat her ability to dance too much.
She's incredibly flat footed it's painful to watch 😬 she did a good job and that but her technique is not good but then it's only week 2
Uno what gets me\n Aston has more views for his dance. And I'm sorry he is certainly not as good as this. I now know he will win the show just cous he has biggest fan base not cool
I adore this dance!
They remind me of Normani and val anyone else?
Omg she's absoulty stunning! Amazing dancer and so much passion! I hate all these talent shows but I'm a little bit tempted to start watching this one because of her but I won't
You strictly lot need to learn to dance this is how you do it http://youtu.be/uupZlTULD1w
I do get annoyed when Alexandra talks but she is such a talented singer and dancer! This definitely tho is the performance of the night! Possible one of the best paso doble performances I've ever seen actually! 😱💚
Just curious if any of you women out there have complained to BBC about Gorkas outfit....or lack of? I mean after all, it is a 'family show'. I mean... .Dont you all go crazy when the pro girls show too much leg or tits? Amazing how quiet you all are when there is a 6 pack on show! Pffft.
Used to admire Alexander when she won the Xfactor, she stated music was her life and all she wanted was to sing. Since her first album I've heard virtually nothing from her. As with most X factor winners they get one or two albums out and then give up and settle for doing adverts when their money runs out. She's still massively talented but I'm disappointed in her lack of commitment to what was her apparent dream.
Ohh shock shock another \nCompetitor that got a big applause .. for dancing well  ..\nOh I forgot they danced before??? it's a fair competion  ok let me see Aston ,Debbie ,Alexander ..I thought it was about stars that never danced before and see how they come on threw the weeks .. it's \nabit unfair as the dancers are a bit disadvantage .
Another one who has been taking dancing lessons way before the series started..pathetic..
Alexandra is also dance trained yet nobody seems to give her grief compared with Debbie
A great dance but you can’t compare her to the others. She has a lot of dance experience and shouldn’t be on an amateur dance comp against people with no dance experience at all
Since when did John fashanu join the strictly contestants?
Who is the most annoying person in the world?\n\nAlexandra Burke by a country mile.\n\nMy idea of hell would be to be stuck in a lift with her....
I don't get it, this just didn't have the paso feel that Debbie's had last week. Emperor's new clothes springs to mind...
Too fast and too aggressive needed more content. Thumbs down.
The comments on this vid are beyond retarded.
ha ha sucker, an act of god that was  🤣🤣🤣
So guns do kill people after all.
hope no one died XD
Who cares he's a fuckin freak
Looks like he got his Gunn
*FINISH* *HIM* 2:03
lmao Jesus is coming for your wig manson 😂😂
too funny. hope he is doing ok ;)
Could have been worse. He could have been at a gig in Las Vegas!
Crushed by a giant cross? Ohhh, so there IS a god AND he has a sense of humor
when it hit him he bend over so far he could lick his own ass lol
Who's the jerk fan who screams to finish the f****** song at minute 2:45?
Anne Lennox did it better, come on
Wow they weren't even playing the instruments.
I bet he broke a few ribs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh wait.
Couldn't have happened to a better 'man' 😂😂😂😂😂😂
it fell on the beat drop
I can't be fucked this crowd is boring.. Cut the strings and let the prop fall on me...
2:04 is what you came for
2:47 is when some guy shouted finish the fucking song
MOST LIKELY this happened because he has been ripping a bibles onstage...
I don't wish injury to anyone but honestly, I didn't know he was still performing.  I thought he retired.
Hes ok, remember kids he had his ribs removed so he can succ his own dicc. he simply folded in half until the prop was removed off him. no damage done. thank god.
Hes gotten so fat his gravitational pull was bound to fuck him up
Lol, a bit of a Spinal Tap moment. Act of God for being a degenerate !
People Cheering like it's part of the show
Rip pages out of the Word of God and you’ll get what you deserve.
did they pay to get in? to listen to covers?
I love you. Get well soon 🖤
he can't get enough horror this bloke....lol
I believe this was... Staged.
Let's just pray he crushed his vocals
They're jammin' out at hammerstein,\nHe climbed a ladder then got pinned,\nStupidest stunt in mankind,\nThe ballroom prop.
Was that paul from the wonder years?
He’s always brought the house down 😂
Am I the only one in the comment section who is concerned if he is actually alright???
Manson recuperate pronto! Master Lord Satan is with you!😆👍🎶
The guitar guys like 'that things fallen on him, shows over - yeah we're done'...

Life is short...but not short enough. Rest In Peace, gentlemen.
Both Now Gone Forever, Man Life is Short...RIP Tom & Gary...
Great footage! RIP both of you.
It scares me as a smoker myself to see how Tom chains those cancer rifles down.\nI'm so scared and heartbroken to hear how Tom died of a massive heart attack.  I gotta quit somehow.  I wish Tom did.  Maybe we'd all  have him with us today.😢
Garry passed last year at age 66.\nTom died at age 66 this year.\nThey are both gone without any warning. A blood clot to the lung and heart attack respectively.\n\nThere will never be a Tom Petty again.  Someone like Tom Petty only comes once.\n\nI've probably had 5 different copies of Damn the Torpedoes in my life. People kept stealing it from me. Mostly exwives and girlfriends. Pink Floyd the Wall and The Eagles greatest hits/Hotel California were the ones that disappeared most. My daughter has been singing Free Fallin' since she was 2 years old. I always put the cassette in for her to sing in the back seat. She's in College now and it's still her favorite song.
....that was outstanding , almost profound ...loved both of those guys .... life is short , but not short enough 
Two untimely deaths here! Brutally sad both of these talented men are gone.
Yep, just read an article too, where he basically said he'd never quit. He became vegetarian too, he said because of factory farming but I'd bet his Doc said something about it too. That said, Garry...a card carrying health fanatic who yet, was a stress-y dude. Nah...none of us know when...be good to yourself, stay cool and never forget to laugh and always, always watch re-runs of The Larry Sanders Show and listen to the GREAT Tom Petty.
wow that was really nice. Thanks for posting it.
what a great piece.  RIP Petty
FUCKING CIGARETTES.
Tom and Garry...together again.
Gary was a manic nutcase.  mellow Tom,  was just 'hosting him,  and trying to deal with him here.  this entire first meeting, until they get inside and get situated, made me very tense and unsettled.   all from Gary's 'shakey, manic, jitterbug demeanor.  ugh.....  Tom was probably thinking,  jesus...calm the fuck down dude?    god Speed to both of them.... still can't believe it....
Both died at 66 and the same way.
Love that they mentioned the Talk Soup line. It's one of my fave scenes of that brilliant show. This was fun to watch. Two creative masters just catchin up on life. We're losing all the greats :( Thanks for posting.
Hard to believe that both of these great men are gone.
Thanks for posting.  Two great guys, showing what friendship and life is all about...  And how short life is....  LA is really a small town sometimes... \n\nRIP Tom and Gary...
Tom was GREAT and one of the best song writers.
Both died at 66.....  RIP Friends.
Gary is the picture of health...tough to watch Tom being such a chimney.  Two lovely Souls.
Love this. Loved these guys.
They're continuing this conversation upstairs now.  RIP, gentlemen.
that was very cool
This is Brilliant!  I could watch this over and over. Thanks so much!
2 farmers on acid? lol What the hell was that??
Life is short. But not short enough. 20:30. RIP Gary and Tom you crazy artists!
Wow Tom smoked like  crazy  Not good
Was this the same house in Encino that he rebuilt after the original burnt down in 1987 from an arsonist?
Really enjoyed that. Thank you. RIP
Smoking killed Tom Petty. You think he would have learned from his friend George Harrison
I'd like to think they are together again, shootin' the shit and having a laugh. 💔
You're Tom Petty...\n...24 hours a day
I LOVE this! Just cried my eyes out having heard you have died today! Thank you peaky hat for our wonderful talks : you were so REAL & FUN . R.I.P you LEGEND 🌹💋❤️
So sad to see both of these legends to pass away; both at the age of 66.
Ironically both Tom and Garry died young and unexpectedly.
What a beautiful video to watch. I am so sad about Tom’s passing. May these buddies be resting in peace.
As these things go, in retrospect, this is a pretty poignant moment. Garry is gone and now Tom's gone. Great clip of two very good friends talking about what's important.
My oh my! He is and always will be.
These guys are funny together. I didn't know they were friends. God's Speed, Fellas, and Thank You.
When are people going to learn that smoking is dangerous to their health.
why isn´t this 20 hours long ?
I WONDER IF THAT SHOOT OUT IN VEGAS WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS HEART ATTACK.\nomfg, it wouldnt surprise me, poor old man:(
Sad both died at age 66. Still had so much more happiness to bring to people
What year is this filmed?
I wish Tom had quit the smokes. RIP to both of these guys. Life is short.
when was this filmed?
A couple of dead men.  RIP
I don't meditate that much anymore. Because you're not supposed to do it when you're stoned...... Lol
Shame on me, I didn't know Gary Passed away,  I just found out about Tom a few hours ago...........SO SAD, I'm being Selfish of Course who's to know when and why the GREAT ONE'S  go to Early in My opinion.  Never Got to see Tom LIVE,  I Thank GOD AND TOM For leaving us a PHENOMENAL BODY OF MUSIC BEHIND, Tom was such a GREAT ARTIST AS WELL AS A WONDERFUL HUMANITARIAN!!!  R.I.P. TOM,  YOU WILL BE SORELY MISSED...............................🎸❤💚❤
How many cigarettes does T.P. smoke in this 20 minute video?  Dang, he was a heavy smoker.
Both died, too young, of heart attacks, yes? Spooky coincidence. Life is brief. Tell people you love them.
Both died suddenly of  a heart attack at 66yrs old....
Gary would've stumbled onto podcasting if he had kept this up
Garry Shandling Was one year older than Tom. Gary passed way in 2016 at 66 years old. Tom passed away in 2017 at 66 years old Three weeks shy of his 67th birthday. RIP.
RIP both of you
They were both 66 when they died - crazy!  Both so talented!
Both passed away at 66
Both Gary and Tom died at 66 from heart problems . Do you think they planned this out ?
Wow, both these guys are gone now.. RIP fellas..
Both 66 When They Died
Wow, both gone at 66 years old.
Well, now they're neighbours again.
Gary was a gem too - 2 too cool guys !! : )
This is awesome
RIP Tom and Gary
Is this Heaven?
Both died at 66.
Saw this some months back, loved the the pair of them riffing on life, brilliant people, hilarious and so talented. Thanks Tom for the great tunes  RIP
natural
Tom now doggonit.
two of my all-time favs, so sorely missed...
Tom Petty was heavy smoker but now I really miss him. American sound music with southern accents, you know. R.I.P.
Two talented men.  They are both gone but we have the songs and the programs.  RIP Tom and Garry!
This is so great, it's like hanging out with them ourselves. Thanks so much for posting.  Was this for a TV show or something? When was it shot?\nHard to watch Tom slowly commit suicide chain smoking -- ouch.  Tobacco, it's a helluva drug.
Heavens having a beautiful reunion today <3  <3
WTF was the connection between these two ....... former or current neighbors?  Mutual admiration society? Friends from way back?  Both grew up in Gainesville .....NOT?  I don't get it; would never have imagined that Shandling hung out with Petty.  No disrespect intended.....pure curiosity.  How did these two get to know one another?
Dang gonna miss Tom.. I hope Gary called him. #TomPettyRIP
What a great candidate interview between to bros. Going to really miss Tom and I already do miss Gary.
Both are gone now...
rip guys
Tom's herion years.
Rip Gary and Tom
both die at 66
Smoking    Got Tom 😪
Tom is right about tubes.  I have had a tube pre-amp for the last 20 years.  When I was auditioning equipment in an audio store, I heard 2 or 3 solid state pre-amps and then when the guy hooked up the tube pre-amp, the difference in the warmth of the sound was immediately apparent.
8:03 flicks ash to the floor.  8:19 grabs ashtray.  15:52 Gary calls Tom Dan.
Smoking kills.
Pacing works for me too.
Love you Tom. Missing you deeply.
Heartbroken
Made me sincerely lol. RIP Tom Petty <3
That was awesome!!!
I WAS A BIG FAN AND LOVE THE GUY AND HIS MUSIC BUT WTF    HE IS SMOKING CIGARETTES AT HIS AGE ?  WHAT DID HE EXPECT TO HAPPEN ?  WOW THIS BLOWS MY MIND.  CIGARETTES KILL INDISCRIMINATELY !  SO SAD  TO SEE THIS CLIP !
I'm a smoker, did a patch a few times, helped my depression but, couldnt sleep, there's a connection w nicotine/mental Heath, all group homes r filled w smokers(condemned w abject disdain by obese, NPD's, etc) but, if u don't want to live & trying to avoid suicide, heck, why not? FDA blocks ketamine infusions &other stuff that could help us! I blame that greedy Grp!
It's amazing, Tom Petty was worth 100 million  and Gerry was 17 million when they passed on....It must be amazing to be that wealthy and that loved
Tom's cup looks really cool.
Both died suddenly from cardiac arrest. R.I.P. guys.
cant believe they both have passed away... we are blessed to have this video... old friends book ends...geniuses and also guys you would love to talk to
Now both of them are back together again and rekindling their friendship ... RIP!
I could watch these two all day! They are like an old married couple. I am so sad they are both gone!!
May God be with the victims and their families😢😢😢
Thanks Amy what a beautiful prayer full of the Holy Spirit
My heart hurts for all !! God bless them all!
God Bless their souls and families.... No words.. Lord hear our prayers for ALL!!
If this video can get to trending with 8.5k views, then anyone can. #PrayForVegas
At 24:41 right before the 3rd verse of Bridge Over Troubled Water you can hear Keith Urban play a quick snippet of Free Fallin' as a subtle tribute to Tom Petty who also passed away yesterday.
😢😭😢 thanks for sharing. God Bless those victims in Las Vegas😢😢
Alison Krauss is so breathtaking. I get chills every time I hear her sing. She has the voice of an angel. My god be with all the victims from the vegas shooting. 🙏🏻
Such a senseless tragedy in Las Vegas. Many thanks to Keith Urban, Vince Gill, Amy Grant and Alison Krauss who all used their incredible gift of voice to help try and console.
God bless these families,I pray for you all. God be with you.
God bless the Las Vegas victims, Puerto Rico,San Juan,Barbuda,Dominica,\nHatti,Texas,Syria,\nYemen,Samolia and the Black men who have been shot and killed by the police. Black Lives Matter. God bless the USA in the era of Trump.
These are the kind of idiits killing america. Ignorant filthy god cult psychos. Shut up !!
See people if you just would have prayed harder at the last mass shooting, we wouldn't be dealing with this now.
Looks shady to me. Nobody talking about Trump investigation anymore? This seems like a Russian conspiracy to distract from Trump's investigation.
See this, Hollywood?  This is how you conduct a vigil without turning it into your own political soapbox.
Don't believe everything you see on TV.
This is a beautiful tribute to alll we have lost! My heart goes with the victims familes!!
Prayers don't do shit.  Time for action.  Your God helps those who help themselves.
Wow that was powerful. I love the amazing grace song.
Thanks for sharing this
Couldn't hardly listen to go rest high on that mountain. Played that at my grandfather and great grandmothers funerals. God bless the victims of this terrible act of evil, and god bless this great nation and assist us in condemnation of acts of terror such as what we experienced.
Fake
We keep praying, but somehow we keep having mass shootings? Maybe we should try something else?
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔

How horrible , sad
I don't cry. I never cry. But tonight. I cried.
It's time we deported 300 million guns and banned the 11+ illegals for purchase.
what you can do is STOP WHITE SUPPREMISIT HATE CRIMES!
Love you all even god is the best😢😢😢😢 this is for hurricane,shooting,\nKilling I hope you all come back to life 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Leave this on every video to spread love. #PrayforVegas
God should've stopped this
Middle aged white guy murders 50. Time to put Nevada in the TRAVEL BAN, Donnie. NRA spent $60 million on GOP during election. BLOOD MONEY.
Praying... so kind.\n\n_Sigh._ Why the fuck don't we take some action instead of talking to our invisible friends?
The ones who died before the age of 41, the age of responsibility, they are in Heaven and having fun and laughing at us, while we are suffering over here. So worry about your own neck. The Almighty Creator made a covenant with us long time ago that If we DO NOT pray and thank our Creator every day for the roof over our head, for our jobs in order to get His provisions, for our health and protections, and if we do not pay 10% of our earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then we Should NOT expect any protection from our Creator, yet He has given us enough respites. And now we have the scientifically proven scripture based on mathematics, the exact sceince to prove that. But, media and illiterate preachers have been raping our hearts and souls for just a few $ and they turned us to a Godless nation, and bunch of idol worshipers. That is why we have been bringing disaster after disasters upon ourselves with our own wrong doings.

Lucky was always one of my favorite characters in the show. Practically everyone was an asshole at some point, except for Lucky, Connie, and of course, Ladybird. I always loved the episodes with Lucky. Today, Tom Petty died, the man who played Elroy Lucky Kleinschmidt. He had some good music too. This is my little tribute to him. He was a good voice actor, a good musician, and a damn good man. He will always be one of my favorite voice actors. May he have a restfull grave.
My favorite character in KotH, due in part to the fact that the great Tom Petty voiced him... R.I.P
One of those baby ironing boards? \n You'll be missed, Tom, God bless you for the joy you brought us.
Rip lucky
RIP
Rest in Peace Tom Petty.
Rest In Peace Tom Petty.\nLucky and Luanne are together again
I am looking for a clip that has the next like in it.  that son of a bitch will never have to work another day his entire life
Rip Tom ☹
I always looked at Lucky and thought that he was some sort of cartoon Tom Petty, today, I looked it up an sure enough he's voiced by Tom Petty! I guess I finally figured it out after a Tom Petty music phase recently, highly recommended.
RIP Tom Petty
R.I.P. Tom Petty
RIP Tom Petty
R.I.P. #TomPetty #Lucky
💝
RIP Tom Petty.
Goodbye, Lucky!
RIP Tom Petty
RIP TOM PETTY
thats tom petty as lucky
R.I.P. Tom, so crazy that him and Brittany Murphy are both gone.
Rest in peace Tom (Lucky) Petty.
RIP Lucky Petty
So long Lucky...At least you and Luanne are in a better place...
I still feel like Lucky got the raw end of the deal
Worst character in King of the Hill. Ruined the show for me.
it's crazy that the singer Tom Petty is the voice of Lucky
I done slipped on pee pee.... best line ever
Lucky's a great character
In another episode, they actually showed it as a flashback.
slipped on the pee pee. best day of my life.
lol iz tom petty

Did you just call Yoshi Luigi?
Does Bunny still have her cat? I haven't seen him since they moved
I do believe in jack-o-lanterns 🎃
I live in Las Vegas and unfortunately my Friends, my gf, and I were involved in the tragedy that occurred on Sunday. I have been glued to the news , I've been proactive and trying to help serve my community and be there for other victims and today I hit an extreme low. Everything began to sit in and I finally broke down making it only the second time I have cried. I hurt for my friends , I hurt for my community and I just hurt all over. YouTube , and your videos have always been a place of solace and today it has brought me comfort and an occasional smile and laugh. There were many heroes that night, my gf included and today you are my hero for putting a smile on my face. Thank you bunny from the bottom of my heart.
I do believe in Jack-O-Lanterns!
for the Mario costume, that is Yoshi not Luigi
Anybody see that guy posing for the camera
Did you get a Tesla?
Love the Halloween store <3 you have guts to be able to act that wacky in public!
I love both the big cats. I found a dragon at Wal-Mart that blows smoke out of his nose lol he is 10 feet tall. Yeah I know not big enough lol. I love when you take the Swamp family shopping so much fun.

Il ont oublier le Logo Pegi 18
Rho le but de Draxler 😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👏
KING NEYMAR!
Supporter du psg je tire mon chapeau au FCGB qui ont proposés du jeu et respectés le football. ..donc quand je vois des gens se moquer je trouve ça ridicule quand on sait que leur équipe se met à 11 dans les cages en attendant que ça siffle . Donc 6-2 oui mais une opposition digne de ce nom.
Bon ok on s'est fait démonté la gueule, mais je suis content d'avoir vu mon équipe jouer, proposer quelque chose, et pas garer le bus comme on fait et feront certains. Après forcément avec des lacunes defensives telles, contre un Paris efficace et impitoyable comme celui de samedi on prend une branlée, mais merde on finit avec 17 tirs, 6 de plus que Paris, qu'on vienne pas a me dire que ce match annonce un saison catastrophique, au contraire.
Neymar, Mbapé e Cavani, melhor ataque atualmente ❤\nPSG futuro campeão da liga dos campeões.
#TeamPaname 🔴🔵
I from Brazil and I can say , Neymar is the best player of the world at the moment , when Neymar guy played  Santos team  by Pelé  , I always watched , so i wanna say Neymar I love you bye
Pour une fois qu'une équipe ne gare pas le bus pour essayer de prendre 1 point. Merci au Girondin d'avoir joué normalement et d'avoir rien lâcher même avec 6 but pris.
Brésil mon amour!
costil :(
En tant que marseillais je ne peut qu' être objectif. Je trouve cette équipe de Paris impressionnante. l'attaque est juste monstrueuse. Franchement ça fait peur. Cette année en ligue des champions vous pouvez faire quelques choses de propres.
On attend les chèvre maintenant c'est petite pute marseillaise vont prendre chère 😂👍💍
The True Meaning Of (WAKING UP😪👉 https://youtu.be/00wYHWg1c7s
Au klm moi je dis
Check this update on barca leaving la Liga to possibly join the French league if the catalan independence win:\n\n https://youtu.be/ns5hcCFgxtc
That's why you don't play giroud in goal
Quand on regarde les stats 6-2 c'est un peu violent  ; mais bon face à un psg comme ca en confiance après le 3 - 0 au bayern , sans faire le bus comme montepellier , à l'éxtérieur et en ayant au final plus d'occasions que le psg ( assez grosse domination bordelaise en fin des deux mi temps ! ) le contenu proposé était franchement sympoa et même si on se prend 6-2 le match était beau à regarder après la défense et le gardien bordelais ont un peu raté leur match un manque d'engagement ( comme l'a dit rabiot ) car les bordelais partaient un peu vaincus alors qu'ils auraient peut etre pu faire mieux , mais si on regarde la match en soit et pas uniquement le score , moi je trouve que ca présage du bon surtout que l'équipe est encore en rodage ! moi je suis content de ce match même si symboliquement parlant se prendre 6 buts dans la gueule ca fait mal , et en différence de buts cest que un de plus que le bayern donc moi je dis , allez bordeaux !
The goalkeeper is terrible
Check very funny 😄 😁 animation of President TRUMP reacting to NEYMAR's move to PSG, some hilarious 😂 🤣 responses:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tRzR7l7Tpw
o que essa desgraça ta falando

Costil est pas ouf comme gardien  ...
Le but de Draxler 👏
PSG 2017-2018 campeão da Champions , 🇧🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🗼
La MCN ☺☺
Neymar a tiré le pénalty \nOK
Costil les cheuveux ... 0
Mdr bordeaux c prit une rafale
Haha
Allez Paris !!
Allez paris
Encore un viol 🤤
Bien ce geste Mbappé 🙏🏻
Notez que c'est Neymar qui tire de penalty😂
La MCN ? Ça n'a aucun sens, arrêtez de dire ça
Et dire que Bordeaux à lâcher Carrasso, je comprend pas. Costil fait un match dégueulasse. Une belle passoire
C'est pas score de foot mais un score de tennis
les gens préfère trappe rien mdr  et maintenant il préfère   areola  juste pasque il a fait un match de fou face au bayarn  arêtes  un peux      \nil faut choisir  un gardien  numéro 1 pour moi c'est pas les 2
DIEUX MERCI QU ON  A PAS MIS CRISTIANO RONALDO DANS L ÉQUIPE AVEC NEYMAR SINON ÇA AURAI ÉTÉ GRAVE
Paris sont impressionnants et monstrueux...Je redoute le 22...allez l'OM ⚪🔵🔵⚪⚪🔵🔵⚪
Pour une fois que Marseille fait un bon match de son côté... tout le monde s'en fout vu que le vrai régal était (encore) au Parc.
J habite a bordeaux et.on.c fais baiser
Ce PSG va faire mal cette saison.
On a vu que le gardien de but bordelais était décourager au 5eme but du PSG
Tout les Français dois avoir Fiers de Marseille unique à gagné LDC
paris aussi. un  équipe mdr
J'aime voir les fan du PSG qui aime leur idole neymar, mais sachez que vous avez une équipe , et que c'est pas seulement grâce q lui que vois gagnerD'autant plus que Draxler ou encore Mbappe se donne encore plus que neymar sur la pelouse ! L'argent a eu raison de la ligue 1 , GG ^^
va t'informer sur les statistique de messi et cr7 a 25 et puis revient Parler, donner juste quelque mois a mbappe et vs allez voir quil Sera la start du psg
quelque'un peut dire à Neymar qu'il a oublié d'enlever ses bigoudis
Super le PSG et trop fort
On est pas chaud nous
Verrati à quand même pris du sale 😂😂😂😂
Alai on atten les petite fiote de marseillais
Ceux qui pensent que c le psg qui remporte la ligue 1 likez moi ça
Le PSG marche sur la France a pas de géant!
les lyonnaise qui essaient d’exister a travers le PSG c'est pathétique mdr on a tiré sur la barre  ^^
Réactions des supporters sur PSGfanTV en direct du Parc des Princes 🔵🔴🔥\nhttps://youtu.be/e_G_yi9vEp0
serieux ont pas l'impression qu'ils ne font pas le meme metier....
La reprise de draxler et le coup franc de neymar 😍
En plus je gagne au ping pong 6-2☺☺
Vous voyez les Parisiens faire ça contre la Juve, le Réal, le Barça, Manchester United ou Manchester City?
c'est moi ou di maria devient roulier il perd des duels il fait de  mauvaise passe.
En attendant Bordeaux en mettent quand même 2 face au PSG
Se prendre que des buts en contre, par le psg, au parc... C'est quand même un comble. A vouloir jouer son jeu Gourvennec a juste offert le match. \nCa n'a aucun sens.
Messi The best
👀.
Toute façon paris cest bien beau de faire les beaux en championnat mais on attend toujours quelque chose de votre part en europe car a part collectionner les 8eme et les quarts de final ca monte pas plus haut et tout les ans on entend objectifs champions league. Mais quand il sagit du barca ou du real bah ca fait plus grand chose pour moi paris est juste une equipe europeene on va dire moyen haut car a part une coupe intertoto cest tout ce que vous avez\nMais vu les quelques matchs que jai vu cette année vous pouvez la tentez elle est large a votre porter \nBon courage a vous pour leurope \nUn supporter bordelais
Ligue 1 Conforama ? Ils sont serieux avec la pub là c'est honteux
Mbappe c'est le seul travailleur franchement j'le kiff ce gamin j'aime trop quand il marque
Sa prend deux but a la maison contre bordeaux parcontre contre la juve ou le real ce sera pas 2 but
C'est normal que le psg gagne c'est tous des braisilien
Quand Meunier marque c toujours un bon match mdr
Bonne nouvelle kurzawa s est blessé en EDF
Au moins Bordeaux joue au foot et pas au casino
je suis fanne de  lom est je reconnait que le psg sont monstrueux . mais il faut reconnaitre que l'om a fait un match de foues contre nice
AUCUNE GLOIRE NI FIERTÉ A AVOIR lorsque tu joue dans un championnat ultra faible niveau ligue 2 et que les médias essayer de nous vendre ça comme un somment de ligue 1 ; XPTDR.. Surtout lorsqu'en plus tu a des joueuses bordelaises qui se couchent de suite et qui attendent la fin du match pour faire des selfies avec NEYMAR !! Pitoyable.. Une seule chose positif, très beau but de Neymar et celui de Draxler par contre..
la ligue 1 est faible pour le psg
Sans déconner cassez vous au Qatar les parigots, vous pourrissez la ligue 1.
4-2 POUR MARSEILLE POLOPOPOOOPO AH merde c pas ce match excusez moi ...
En league 1 il n'y a que le psg qui m'intéresse le reste des équipes pas intéressant
Draxler ptn je l'aime trop \nBerchiche je le trouve bon
Que c'est beau le pouvoir de l'argent sur un championnat sans but
Le PSG est une très belle équipe, toujours agréable à voir jouer. Vous devriez être content s'avoir une telle team en France. Mais non, vous faites les chauvins simplement car ils ont de l'argent.
Ligue 1 is shit only one good team no challenge or competition must be boring in that leauge u will hardly see a 4-6 nil in a leauge like  bpl
Ptn mais qui va battre cette équipe 😂 c'est plus possible la mdr ils ont même pas pitié de leurs adversaires avec leur score de tennis 😂 je pense que nous on a soufrir le 30 octobre Garcia bon nous caser un petit 451 comme il le fait quand on affronte des équipes du top 10 x)
Et ce con d'Unai préfère Motta a Draxler... Quand on voit son match on se pose des questions
Super match de basket
go steve, great pickin
Rupret on banjo
Dana carvey on violin
shredding.
Love Martin
Snarky puppy!
So that the moron can play. ROFL so hard. Did not expect that punch line.
He  plays so well and so effortlessly. Truly  a master of many talents. The whole band is good as well.
I remember the arrow through the head hat he used to wear
Read the title and insta liked this is amazing ty NPR!!!
Why's there only seven? I heard they're CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN!!
What is this? What am I feeling?
This just made my day. Thank you, NPR!
Whether you like bluegrass music or not, you have to respect all of the talent, finesse, and timing that these musicians  master.
That's a lot of talent for one person to have. I seriously dig this music.
He used a banjo to get his start.  He did a comedic stand-up act with his banjo, and appeared on the Sonny and Cher show - that's how he first got wide exposure.  He would put a fake arrow on his head and play his banjo.  It might be on youtube somewhere.
Somebody give Josh Rogosin a raise!
Gotta love that Collins guitar
Beautiful music!! ❤️❤️❤️
NPR Music please invite Łąki Łan!
Fantastic, Loved it👍🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
Steve Martin is brilliant, funny and an incredible musician. Of course he surrounds himself with other master musicians!❤️❤️❤️
He should do  a song with Punch Brothers
Thank you. Great stuff.
Dana Carvey sure plays a mean fiddle...🤣
banjo master
Bruce Willis on banjo #2 ;)
Awesome banjo.
He hates those cans!
Love it!!!!
GET FRANK OCEAN ON THIS NPR PLEASW
Steve Martin reminds me of my talented funny uncle I loved! 😄 till my uncle fingered my bum in my sleep😕
Steve Martin lookin like Pappy O'danielYa dad blamed idjit
Surprenante découverte... Bravo Mister Martin!...
Dad music 100%
check it out \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI-cdgLl6Ek&t=2s
Um YEEEEEESSS
Steve martins gangsta as f#%*
很好
STEVE CAN SHRED!!!!!
True american bad ass
So cool
Polished as feck.
Gavin Volure
Top notch musicians, as always. Made it 6 minutes listening to banjos. Along with most accordions, banjos are always out of tune. ALLLLLwaaays outta tune. A single banjo note is out of tune with itself. Is like all the nails and all the chalkboards in the world...
Just 1 reason so many people love Steve Martin plus all his hilarious antics. I read somewhere, he has been playing a banjo since before he joyfully entertained us on TV.
Bruce Willis and Chris Martin's love child playing the other banjo?
He is considered #5 best banjo player in the WORLD. Love the SCR Band. Long time from SNL host and the Smothers Brothers writer.
I love my dad, but also wish that Steve Martin was my dad.
I'm wondering if Mr. Martin planned this to be the be white-boy brigade or, as I'm praying, it's just a sad irony that all these instruments collected from various cultures around the world are now the sad reminders of the beautiful friends we lost so long ago.  Or have we lost them when they live so vibrantly within us...I don't know...I guess I am just wishing I had a bada**  fro and an Aztec tan...but I guess I'm just be the blond haired, blue eyed joke of blending of all of {US}.   I like to think that there are blond-haired, blue-eyed Native Americans...I feel like a Native American, can't I just proclaim it.....I'd like to think I could some kind of redemption to all those have lost their favorite version of America(I hope America is read as North America, South America, and Central America.)   .
When you realize this is actually STEVE MARTIN! WOW 💚
Wow always loved Steve Martin and never knew he was a musican!! 🙌
The first doesn't really sound like So familiar. Is it really? Or did they make a mistake, cause i would really like to find it. Would the kind folk of youtube comment's section be so kind tell me? Please?
I see a show-off french speaking guy, I upvote
This is so cool
steve martin plays the banjo???!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Huh... TIL
Sounds good.
Doc Watson .... would be smilin' ... Nice stuff boys! Mr. Martin Bravo!
He is Soooo talented.  They sound great. Thanks for sharing this with us.
I feel like this music would fit perfectly in the Firefly universe
Love Steve Martin, and loved this NPR Tiny Desk Concert!!! Now when can I see this live??!
Dam Steve I had no idea
So much happening, I can barely catch up! The beautiful instruments, the mellow singing, the amazing audio engineering, perfect jokes, impressive musicians. Loved everything about it!
Lol after listen to this i want to marry my sister
His face seems unnaturally smooth. Did he got plastic surgery at some point?
Wow Steve is a natural👍👏🎶🎸 btw the whole group flows so well together. I love when people have more than one creative ability, keeps you out of other peoples business! 😆😁
Damn this is so cool!
This band is so amazing, they even have a turtle singing for them
No idea Steve was such an awesome musician. So pleasantly surprised!
Planes trains and banjos
Steve Martin, I started on a five-string banjo like yours, but I have changed to a 10-string banjo. Much better sound. Why don't you give it a try?
Didn't know Bruce Willis played the Banjo as well!
They are doing a meet and greet where I live...  but I'm gonna be camping in the Mississippi River delta
I need this video on loop for when I have a rough day.  It's just so great and it helps my mood tremendously.
Steve Martin is writing, playing, and singing his Ass off!
Steve Martin... the Van Halen of the banjo!
I so love Steve more for being a killer musician then just an OK comedian.
I love this!  Way to represent Asheville, SCR!
Dammit Steve!  Stop being so talented; you're making the rest of us look bad.
Another brilliant Tiny Desk! Loved it. Thank you.
John C. Reilly and friends was awesome too
Beautiful claw hammer style
Its amazing enough that the fiddle player didn't knock Steve's glasses off his head.
It's almost like he'd dedicated his life to the Banjo, and yet he has accomplished so much more than that.\n\nAwesome stuff.
steve be doing the most in this life
Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers are pretty snazzy
I am glad he finally did something with his life! 😉
Finally, a platform for this little known musician.
The third song was amazing!!
Can we get Dave Matthews on vocals to join in on a few songs?
Man he's funny. DO some movies!!
I love it how famous actors like Steve Martin and John C Reilly have these secret talents for being bluegrass musicians. That artistic gene must manifest itself in all kinds of forms.
I was born a poor black child..
I watched this with the stupidest smile on my face all the way through, Thank you!
It's he the actors from the movie with 12 kids?
Go to google and type: *gexxguides* You get the only real 100% Working clash of clans working method in 2017
NPR is normally state-propaganda, so this was refreshing!   I do love bluegrass.   \n\nThe lack of hill-melancholy and marcato give it away as city-playing; but refreshing nonetheless.   Thank you SCR band.
I just started a channel could you guys subscribe and view my video 😀
What does NPR mean?
Which of these 5 designs is your favorite?! 💅
The dry marble looks very bad
You should do Poppy inspired nail art!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm Poppy.

These are all really pretty..........
Hannah do u really bend your pinky finger while doing the nailart??? Bc it’s never visible 😂

At 66 years... too soon. Sad to hear,  R.I.P.
I NEED TO KNOW.... :(
RIP
Another great musician leaves us...:(
you were a class act Mr. Petty u will be remembered forever
To Tom, I love you man, thanks! Signed, an Indiana girl, from an Indiana town.........
Hi Brian,\n\nDo you mind if I use a part of this video for a tribute I am working on? Happy to credit you on the channel, comments and description and even list you down as a collaborator.\n\nLet me know if you are OK with this.\n\nThanks & have a good day
rip tom. thinking of the fam. this one is for you peter. i know he was one of your music heros.  rip.
Was this the final song of his final public appearance? Either way so sad to learn of his death. RIP TP. Everybody watch his old SNL appearances tonight.
RIP Tom. So glad I took the trip to London to see you this summer. Thanks for all the music.
I was at this very show and it was my first (and now only) live performance from TPTH.  I am truly fortunate watching such a magical event with a good friend, good wine, good food and great entertainment.  You will be greatly missed by all of us for such an amazing career and iconic music.  Thoughts and prayers for you and your family.
Wish you,'d come around here again. RIP
Don't even know who this guy is but, RIP.
Love you Tom, Why must God take all the best, RIP, forever missed
RIP Tom Petty - thank you for the memories!!
Precious Tom...Heartbreaking.
(y) <3
Not Wildflowers...Yer So Bad.
R.I.P.!
Say hi to Glenn . . .
RIP Tom
One hell of a concert in heaven now. Too many, too soon.
Seen TP and Heartbreakers 7x between '85 and '93. Last night at Hollywood Bowl was my 8th time. In the past he was good. One of the best. Now? Don't know if aliens cloned him and left us the shitty version? But he sucked!! He's like Wayne Newton in Vegas. On autopilot. Same songs in same exact order with same exact talking in between songs. Same same same. SUCKED!! Bet he even  puts the condom on with his mouth for you, he's such a pro. Sucked!!
Best way to end the day😊
I wish I could borrow Nala for the day😂love your vlogs alfie💗

Heyaaaa
99th comment
hi alfie
earlyyyyyyy y y y
Hiiii
❤❤❤❤
I ordered three Birthday Cake Balm Dot Coms as well as a Stretch Concealer and can't wait for them to arrive! X
Haven't had any luck with Zoeva brushes, I bought two eyeshadow brushes (cant remember which ones) and they both give me an awful red rash.... :(
Love the Dr Jart.  I finished one tube and agree about the packaging.  I took off the pump and turned it upside down for several days into a smaller pot.  Then I knocked the pot on the floor.  Splattered up into the air and landed on the carpet, the dog and places I probably still haven't found.  Still love the product.  So does my dog.
Love that a previous season item of clothing is back in rotation in your favourites! You have such great ethics Anna
I love parks and rec too!!! So amazing that you met rashida!! \nBtw you should totally watch brooklyn 99 if you haven’t yet. It reminded me of parks and rec and i abolutely love it!!
great faves girl!
Oh my worddd 😜 Loved this vid
You're so cute❤️
You‘re so hilarious 😂
That DemyLee sweater looks SO cosy!
That Rashida Jones story though 🤣... amazing!
What an amazing story!!
That whole Rashida Jones suitcase story 👌👌👌
And the lovable, adorkable award goes too... awww Anna!
The Rashida Jones story!!! 😱😱
Great video Anna! 👍🏻😄
Great Rashida Jones story time!
Hi
really liked your rashida jones story! lol
Hilarious 😆 lounge incident!!!
Rashida frickin Jones! 🤘🏼🎉😱
#luggagegoals I guess!
💕💕💕
You are too cute lol !
ca you please tell what size you are in zara jeans ... i want to buy these top shop ones but i'm not sure about size
This Rashida Jones story is the best thing this week ☺️💚
Hahaha u crack me up haha amazing, i can so imagine how chuffed u felt, whats the chance! Go g♥️rl😘👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I loving your vids when I get a chance, I've said it before so cool and effortless chic. Love the video : )\n\nNatoya
You are SO adorable with that luggage story!!! 🤗😂
Hi Anna! I love your videos. Is there anyway I can get a nomakeupday jumper in xl?
Dr. Jart is pronounced with the J sound, not the Y sound :)
I love you. Period. You make me smile and giggle.\nThank you! :)
Great video! Thinking of getting the jeans but not sure what length - how tall are you? :) Thanks! xx
There's a light version of the dr jart B.B. Sometimes I mix it up. 🤗
That suitcase is so cute! Def planning to get one!
Hey Anna! Do the straight leg jeans give when you wear them or do they stay nice and snug? Xx
Just ordered 2 pairs of MOTO jeans 😎 Been on the hunt for a great everyday non-skinny style, hope these fit the bill!!!
Now all I can hear is Chris Traeger saying Anne Perkins. Great video, as always!
I love your accent!!xx
The Rashida Jones Luggage link doesn't work! It just leads to their main page :(  Are they sold out or unavailable now?
I'm also a serial luggage purchaser and the Away ones look like they could end my habit! Amazing - thank you :)
I love your hair!!
I thought it was Moto as in Motorbike as in Moto Jacket? Not Motto? Have i been pronouncing it wrong for like 12 years?
what is that brush you always use to put on your foundation? i need it!
you watch Parks n Rec! have you seen Brooklyn 99 as well?? it's by the same writers <3
Great video, Anna. I love the framing of this shot. I'm definitely tempted by that pretty suitcase (but don't think I travel enough to justify it - bummer!) xx
Love the story about the luggage :) The leopard print boots are so pretty. I will have to check out the jeans too.
You are the cutest! Such a cool moment!! :) and the luggage looks awesome too!!
I love september favourites because I am do not like necessarily researching new trends so I found your videos very helpful and I really like your energy. Great video x
I found out about Parks and Rec through you, and just streamed all the seasons. But it seems like the Rashida Jones collection is not on Away anymore?
That story time was so hilarious 😭😂😂
You're just adorable! Loved the Rashida Jones moment - looks like now I'll need some new luggage as well....
you walking past rashida jones would be me walking past you tbh
Rashida Jones is SUCH a badass, how did you resist asking her to go to coffee so you could pick her brain? (Please, I say that as if I would do that - I'd be as awkward as you were in that moment, because holy crap it's Rashida Jones!)
Love your videos! I feel like we are friends haha
So, you have a book signed by Aziz Ansari, and you've met Rashida Jones.... I am so jealous!!!
Rashida Jones just gave thumbs up on this video.
Anna, can you find a slightly enhanced version of Glossier Like? Been searching!
Oh Anna, now I've got the giggles; that was suitcase story gold. Thanks for sharing! See you next time!
I can't find the pink on their website. Don't tell me it's gone 😭😭😭
such a fun story! lol
The booties are sold out in every size. Can you suggest a dupe? Thanks.
I love Rashida Jones as well. This was a really cute post. I'm a luggage W_ore as well and now I must explore your suggestions. Have a great October.
Any tips on how to wash raw hem denim? I throw mine in the machine but the hem gets very frayed which is not the look I like. Thanks!
Loved this video! The Rashida Jones story was hilarious 😂! I always look forward to your videos and they never disappoint
Love your attitude and energy!!!
The Neutrogena Body Oil feels and smells amazing. Definitely an affordable alternative to the Clarins. http://www.neutrogena.com/skin/skin-bath/body-oil/6811101XX.html?cgid=skin-bath#start=7
OMG your face as you tell Rashida Jones anecdote!! So funny! Exactly the face me and my girlfriends make when having a natter over a glass of wine 🍷
Literally got so excited for you when you were telling your rashida jones story 😂 my heart is like pounding lol. Love the video!
How would you compare the Dr Jart versus the IT cosmetics?
You Rashida Jones story is so entertaining, and the fact that you are so excited made me smile. Love the suitcase, shame I just bought a new hard case :(
Rashida is the sweetest! She came into my old job with some friends and hung out for a while. She was so lovely and we both made awkward jokes at each other. Now I just want to be friends with her!
I can't believe that you met rashida!! Parks and Rec is my fave as well! I truly believe you and I are the same Anna, love love all your content <3
Ahaha aww love the rashida jones story, I probably would've been the same as well 😝 So cool though that you met her, loved her on parks and rec!
Please so a workout video with your current routine <3
Your fan girl moment was both funny and sweet! 🤗And I LOVE my Away luggage!
You are so adorable. Especially about the Rashida Jones/luggage thing. Thanks for making me smile and well done on your charity... so much to smile about!
Liking the video before even watching it <3
Would love to see your YouTuber faves too!! I love finding new people and fellow YouTubers to watch xx
Anna, you totally made my evening. Laughed hard on your story about meeting Rashida Jones 😂 Fun fact (not related to luggage though) - Dr. Jart ‘s beauty balm formula is not the same in Korea (South, that is), the country where the brand is originally from, despite having exactly the same packaging. I live in Korea, and I am a big fan of Dr. Jart skincare range (btw if you can get your hands on their Cicapair serum I HIGHLY recommend it). I also purchased their bb beauty balm in high hopes to look like a sun-kissed beach goddess. I think I looked like my nanna’s pearls or her polished china instead. It gave me tonns of glow, but none of that bronze goodness, rather a whitish/pinkish tint 😔 which is not necessarily a bad thing, just not the look I’m going for. On a bright side- it does get better after it sits on my skin for an hour or so.
thank God! i thought you are going to take a break too!
Love your  Sunday videos Anna! The leopard print boots are still so beaut 😍
SUCCESS!!! ANN PERKINS APPROVED YOUR (her) LUGGAGE!!! <3 <3 loved the story!!  *high five*
where is the beautiful cupboard from?
Love a good story time! #LuggageTale 😂
Loved the story with the suitcases =)
The september newsletter rocked my world. Your style of writing is thoroughly enjoyable!
Love the suitcase, but the link doesn't work... I'm in Portugal, maybe that's the reason...
Thank you for telling us the jean size you are in those Topshop jeans Anna, I’m the same height as you (been to your meet ups ^^), and was sure whether to get 32 or 34. Definitely ordering the 32 now! 😊🙌🏻
Hi Anna! Do you use any kind of dust bag to protect your suitcase while traveling? Sometimes airlines are a bit rough with luggage and they get scratched
What is the colour of suitcase???
I love that I'm not the only one that turns to mush when they meet their idols. X
Anna, have you tried the Zoeva Luxe PETITE Crease brush?! OMG, it's definitely my favorite brush. It's obviously smaller than the regular one you mention here, but I find it so helpful for putting precise amounts of color in my crease or outer corner and then blending with the bigger brush.
I couldn't find the Rashida luggage on the Away website. I'm afraid it's gone 😭
OMG so in love with that CHANEL toiletries bag, where did you get that and can I still buy it? <3 <3 <3
dr Jart! not dr yart please!
You ramble more than you should.
Anna, you're lovely and I love you to bits but PLEASE... Could you stop saying 'I feel like...' quite so much?! As a listener, once you pick up on it, you hear it every single time and trust me, it's a LOT of times...! 🙉
That Rashida Jones story - I genuinely almost cried out of excitement for you. Can't believe you met Ann Perkins.
you always look amazing anna but can i say you look extra fab in this video? WOW! i’m screenshoting all the products you’re wearing to add to shopping list 😘😂
Share this video with someone who needs to improve their vlogs!\nRemember to _`Like'_ the video if you learnt some great vlogging tips! 👍
F*ck it i'll use stock footage *leaves like* <3
SO That's were the whole, 'and think of something ridiclous' in last week comes from,\n\n*IT MAKES SENSE NOW!*
Can't wait to see your star wars cameo :^)
Awesome video! Could you please take me to Hogwarts, too...? 😉🙏
THE QUEEN CAME BACK
Now this is a great vlog!!
I love how toms face and name changes EVERYTIME!\n( favourite is beep beep XD )
*phone answers, guns shots and violence heard* yup that's TomSka alright.
I'm taking notes!
Ami, as always love your sense of humor! Your videos are bright bits in this sometimes crazy dark world. FYI: I hope it isn't too unoriginal or derivative but with the my new channel branding I took inspiration from your motto with my updated channel upload schedule. :) Be well and safe!
How have I just only now found this channel?
I see Spiderman, really let himself go!
the drone part  HAHAHA omg I'm dying its so funny !!!! ben video so far
You are so beautiful.
Hilarious video!\nCool Gatchaman shirt by the way.
Lol dat train ride tho, you were cool as ice with those sunglasses
But... she said a swear! My heart is fucking shattered
I think we're all waiting for that mopping vlog.
One of my favorite videos~ tho all of your videos are great!
Not gonna lie- this made me giggle. Giggle away a little mischievous schoolboy.
Aw man that was great!  So funny!
I love how the Profile thing and name keeps changing
Are you friends with Barbie?
Ami, the queen of trolling and satire <3 loved the video!!! :D
3:05 that's a good touch giving the phone a delay. A lot of people don't notice that when on the phone.
1:30    Wow.... That pretty much sums up my channel..... #MyChannelSucks   :(
The only thing I see exciting at weddings is the grooms fainting in fear. I don't blame them. Check it out on Youtube.
That was one glamorous train ride.
Holy shit this video is perfect
This video is gold. I loved it so much oh my gosh
you were the original lil miquela queen
3:22 Time for some self examination lol
That drone part made me burst out a loud ha!
Must've been a shotgun wedding.\nSorry.
You said that you'd use stock footage, so it comes as no surprise that the video of Westminster Bridge is indeed stock footage. Riddle for you: Could we have known that it is stock footage, even if you had not mentioned it? If yes, how?
Who else has sawn the rabbit guitar dude at 3:45 in Xiao's video? 😂😂
Is a McDonald's hamburger in England any different from one in Japan?\n\nWas going to ask if TomSka was an inter-dimensional nexus of chaos, death and general destruction, but then he went off and ruined it by being normal towards the end.
I'm not good in front of cameras:\/
That feeling when for a second you thought she used stock footage for the drone shot... -_-
Toms name kept changing\nAnd I was like\nDamn toms car\nCan’t you get anything right
Tom's face keeps changing XD\nAnd name.
When you post I think a part of my soul has been chipped away and given to you. I love it
Looking forward to the next video, Ami! Just uhh... 2 months? Maybe 1 and a half?
New videos every someday. Just like Natalie Tran\n\noh wait, that would imply Natalie uploads videos
Glad to see that you're work is as spectacular as ever!! Keep it up!!
Been missing you!!!  My wife & I really enjoy you.  :)
Pretty much me if I ever decided to vlog.\nDid a few things, ate some snacks, same old, same old
Oh look she has a drone then pops ups word I realise it was google earth lol I'm dumb.XD
I'm not playing video games, *I'm at a wedding* \n \n\nI'm dead 😵
I'm laughing so hard
He was talking about Casey neistait .I LOVE it .
Did you get to meet Rey?
Bomb bomb that was Tom
One thing you could do is upload more regularly. Come on, other vlog channels upload daily, yet at your pace it almost seems like you're a YouTube animator.
This was a wonderful surprise in an otherwise gloomy day.  Thanks Ami 🤗
I ALMOST SPIT OUT MY FOOD THIS WAS SO FUNNY
There are so many thing to point out in this video, but I like how Tom's name kept changing on your screen haha
But I don’t have a drone! bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
This is so meta. I like it!
I like these videos
I love Tom's Car. He's my favorite YouTuber.
Awesome! You are so Creative **0** <3
HAHA
Ami: AH f*** this is taking forever
stop veljan
I love it

The funniest vlog ever 😂
10/10 Would vlog with you anyday !!
So glad to see you again on my birthday (oct. 3)!  i'm in asia, so it's a day in advance. \ncome see me so we can have fries (lol even tho u can't)
What model drone was that?
Hey I really want a video of how you animate Ami! I think it would be really cool.
It's my first time in your channel.\nI love it! \nI hope to see more of your videos.\n\nSomeday..
Applause.\nThat was worth the time HAHAHA <3
Devil: You have 24 hour to coll-\nCuphead: Done
This guy made this game his bitch
Holy hell you put the Run in run and gun.
There youtube, now I clicked on it. You happy?\n\nAlso: 9:34 Reminds me of the boss on level 3 in Disposable Hero (1993)\nMaybe it's the face, tongue thing, general shape and the color scheme.. and the fact that the level is a side-scrolling flying shooter too.
Wow! And you even know tricks to make this game broken! Lol
What a patient guy
Nice. I need to learn the tech for a race down the line.
lost some valuable seconds on minor errors :P but good run anyways
Question, why is the time stopped during each black loading screen?
So the game is 37 minutes long? Thats a short game lol
I like to watch this because there's so much attention to detail in the graphies
lol im still stuck on that roller coaster boss, its hard as hell
what...did everybody on that town sold their souls to the devil?...wow....
I have a PS4...\n\nWelp, *Buries hopes and dreams*
Dang charge shot is op, the bosses die too fast from it lol. Also in my playthrough I got a 4min 20 second kill on diceman haha (my only kill on him), definitely some time for you to save on him by good dice rolls but also on stages like the monkey/card flipper you get to see the cards before they are flipped.
why isn't this game on PS4?
Why is everyone in this pissed off?
26:28 dunno if is cringe or savage killing a person in front of a audience and pretending that cardboard lighting is hurting you LOL
Are the pathways being cliffs/trees secrets, or are they glitches?
The games art work is just amazing!
I feel like im on drugs
I think the flower got high and thought he had him captured in his hand things
Take Mickey mouse and replace the head with a cup, add eyes, and that's basically cup head
still room for improvement, if it weren't for the death on the dragon and not being able to parry dice correctly in the casino this would probably be cut by a few minutes actually. there are some casino bosses that take less time to kill because of their vulnerability (5 and 8), and doing 9 is probably the worst boss for a speedrun. still impressive, there were a couple bugs i didn't know about that were illustrated here. i believe you can crush this record 👍🏼
what's that? kill all of the people that owe you things? be back in 30
1:37 fuck off its take me like 30 intents to finish the first level, damn!  great speedrun btw
10:45 I had no clue you could break the boss like that..... speed run strats are AMAZING
Did you nreak the flower?
Oh boy, this will possible get ruined by the Bendy and the ink machine, undertale, fnaf, and minecraft fandoms and probably gonna have a cringy crossover
8:19 This is completely from *CONTRA HARD CORPS* boss that also changes to astrological signs.
I feel that he's using TAS for the overworld not in-game. Because he's movement patterns are very spastic and inhuman a bit but that's just imo.
You can beat Queen Bee before she transforms? Damn
here before the fans ruin it
Oh I know how you got through it so fast! You skipped the tutorial! That part is borderline impossible
Devil : you have 24 hours to collect the contr-\n*cuphead is out the door already*\n_within an hour cuphead is back_\nDevil : what the f u c k ?\n*devil is murdered in cold blood*
There's a way to kill the claw machine monkey early, it happened to me, he glitched to the side and died.   When I faced him again though I couldn't kill him and the game softlocked.
someone will probably beat this (mainly because of Grim Matchstick),\nbut for time being it is pretty damn good.
Doctor: you have 45 minutes to live\nMe:*watches video*
speed 2.0. more like cup the fuck? head
Did anyone else notice the sound glitch in 10:36? It sounded like that damn flower was continuously farting!!!
Friend: I bet you can't do a speedrun on that.\nMe: Hold my Cuphead.
mEANWhILE IM HeRE TAkING 26 MIn TO COMpLETE THE TUToRIAl
When in doubt use our brand-safe Roundabout®
BUT HOW DID YOU GET PAST THE TUTORIALLLLLL
never seen this game before, the retro art style is adorable.
First I thought it took him 37h -.-
steam says the game is 3+,well explain how kids will resist how scary those bosses are
60fps + this animation style = the most jarring thing on the planet.
I dont want to say that finale was cheap but.... that is one cheap exploit x3o
37:37 When u try your best but dont suceed.
What's with the timer pausing on retries?
This reminds me good old Commander Keen game!
i could watch someone play this game for hours
How long is this game out? 3 days?
For a second i thought he completed in 37 hours, I'm such a dumbass
When the big flower dies in Floral Fury, it looks like Monty Burns.
26:30 that FF IV reference tho.She pulled the Kefka.
Oh no. It begins.
whata cool game love the art style
wow fk
Fucking nerd
cool :D
20:38 :(
You cheated the DEVIL?! NOICE!!!
Another great video
Nice exploit 10:44
Lol jk
That was fast

Marry me.

So Megaman is taking LSD now?.....
Already
Sicc
lol look at all the little fucking idiots that say it will be ruined by a fanbase\n\nwhat humongous idiots these shits are\ndont join the fanbase then, dumbasses
You forgot the most important boss of this game....\nThe Dash Tutorial...
Well done. The run's pretty meh to watch until ~Djinni. The theme kept me interested long enough for the gameplay to get interesting.
It’s so depressing seeing you breeze through all the levels which took me hours to complete 😩
A game in the old 50s- style of animation???\nWHAAAAAAT?!?!?\nno wonder this has been haunting my reccomended!! \nWow!
Me: Awesome, I got a game that's going to get extremely popular very early, maybe I can be one of the top guys and really try to speedrun it!\n\nReality: There are fucking people that can already beat it without getting hit and I'm stuck in Isle II
So... this is basically the child of mario and dark souls?
Wow, I'd like to see your first run. To know how much difference there is between us other than experience.

this looks boring af tbh
I ship captain brineybeard and Dr Kahl
Y'know what, I don't give a flying fuck if they're making porn of this. I mean, if a select group of people want to sexualize some characters from a video game without affecting anyone's life,  I don't see anything wrong with it.
This needs to be redone correctly, especially since you somehow bugged out the flower taking more time off your actual time. If you can achieve anywhere near your completion time for this video then I think that should be the official time. Impressive nonetheless.
43:45 what is he facing? what if he jumps down?
Wow, not even one hour of gameplay. Terrible game!
Absolutely awful. Constant mistakes, never uses specials optimally for bosses and never parries when needed. Hilarious that you opt to reduce your damage output just to have one more hit - a good speedrunner almost never gets hit.
No offense but the game looks really clunky
He died at Grim Matchstick so does this speedrun count anyways?
guys! omg f ree amazon gift cards from here ➜ lythu.com/giftcardsgiveaway?307689663

no hookups *is already pregnant or has kids* \nno fuckbois \n#singlemommylife\nmy children are my world/my son/daughter has my heart\nI love the office\nI love parks and rec
The amount of girls who's bio are I only swiped right because you have a dog is staggering
I wouldn't know, I never get any matches.
You forgot  if I super liked you, it was probably by accident
yeah tinder doesn't work for me
Oh dear!!!! Makes me glad that I like dating the old fashion way
I want somebody who challenges me. And somebody I can challenge.
It's always the fat one.
Every female tinder ever: DTF?. Every. Single. Guy. We all have needs. Every. Single. Time.
Tinder likes my dog more than I do
Hi I'm Kaitlyn I love Disney going on adventures and going to the beach
A guy who's been trying to find a partner for the last few months on Tinder, I can confirm this is 90% of what I see.
Lol I just had a tinder ad played before this.
Guys subscribe me i will subscribe you back.\nYess i successfully add my comments into 80k videos😊
Got a Tinder ad before the video.
I also like netflix... and chill too! Hahahaha
mfw I got a tinder ad on this video.
Quick tip; most people you swipe won't even see you on their feed. If they add a Snapchat or Instagram account, follow that instead if you are serious
Looks at incorrect spelling for possible child name...
When you match but no reply
Lmao where's the male version of this thats exactly the same but with pictures of fish
Hahahaaa I can only relate to the only have an account for a joke bit.  I used to have a tinder and I actually had a normal profile, except I had vinn diesel paintings as my profile pictures.  And yet I still managed to meet my boyfriend/soulmate, so hey, Tinder ain't all bad
Hiking, adventures, pictures of them being alcoholic thots, rugby, 420 friendly, dog person, trucks, has a kid, overused quotes, shitty pop music. Why are women so... Indescribably predictable and one dimensional?
I'm sarcastic. Also be sure to check out the picture of me and the drugged tiger. No hookups!
Don't forget I love to laugh
Looking to have fun really means they're  going through  there hoe phase and the just want to hookup
Now do one about black women.
Bears, Beets BattleStar Galactica. Best line in the office.
Tinder thought me girls boring as fuck but they want you to be funny and ect...
I'm disturbed that this is incredibly accurate
Females don't need to put work into tinder
Touch my butt and buy me Pizza 😖😖
I am a microwave
I don't know what this tinder thing is precisely but I use it to start a fire. Sounds like our cultures are similar but we thumbs up instead of swipe right.
Congratulations on making trending and getting so many views so fast!
Hopefully not the fat one
What's Tinder? Just kidding. It's like that old site called \nHot or Not right?
Upload on Sam O'Nella Academy more often please, I would appreciate it.
So Tinder is a dating app? Can I join if I'm only interested in getting my dick sucked for as little money as possible?
Always up for an adventure.... Yah, like spending our money.
Why do girls have to specify that they're not into hookups? The fact that they do makes me think that its reverse psychology haha
Don't forget the bitches who don't respond, or act super interested at first but then suddenly stop responding
That's my profile.  But you have to understand tinder is a mess and I've had to move to match. Basically you go on tinder as a woman and you can essentially date anyone of your race between the ages of 18-40. The guys there seem just as basic. Compared to on match where you actually see people based on your interests.
They're all obsessed with Gin
Most women go on tinder purely for ego boosting, they don't wanna meet up with strange men (what women does). They only wanna see how much matches they get
I swiped right and nothing happened... duped again..
Can't way to the next millennia when you post another vid
By far the best argument I've heard against online dating is, You don't go to a junkyard to find a nice, new car.
Good music for studying and more! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCra6VD5wenzUL-6E_92m4gQ
Oh also forgot. Must be 6'4 or taller
You forgot the part where they all say they're 420 friendly
ok, now do one for men on tinder.
Girlfriend does make up on Boyfriend!!😱😍 Video on my channel👍🏻
I'm so lonely. I have nobody to call my own.

almighty Sam, thanks for not making shit videos and can you bless me papa with your awesomeness? SAM bless plz.
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

R.I.P. Tom Petty ~
Das könnte auch Ich im Auto sein. CD von Petty im Kasten und dann: Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Falling......:-)
Freaking midget
Tom Cruise singing before it was cool. Makes me wonder if the people behind Rock of Ages saw this and thought, Let's have him play Stacee Jaxx! Love both movies btw.
My LOVE!
free fallin'💔
One of all time favourite scenes ever since I was a kid! Great film, and one of Tom's finest performances. 
one of the best actors everrrrrrrrrr... and so kind to his fans... I admire him very much
Cameron Crowe knows how to put together a great soundtrack...
This song is 'free falling' of the Tom Petty!
Absolutely amazing scene!!! I love you Tom ;)
he is still the best lookin guy ever
Love you Tom!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Can anybody tell me who's song is this?\n
I´ve seen girls driving the car screaming at the top of their voices ... isn´t it a bit of a paradox??
Omg❤️❤️❤️❤️
okay I'm really shocked that tom cruise can sing

I kinda like the idea of a smiley face on the bottom of my toe.

Can this be the start of their love story ? Please please please :D
Harrison Ford is lucky that his training in his previous profession has prepared him for the style of acting he aspires too, he was a carpenter wasn't he?
Reese Witherspoon look like she boutta take out a knife and stab Margot in the neck
Graham looks like he taped his suit with black duct tape
whats his name the old guy
Reese is a buzz kill :/
That IT smile in the thumbnail's just creepy
Don’t get tattooed by someone who calls it a “gun”😂
Harrison Ford is done with this world
Margot is so cool and a bit weird
is that woman sitting by Margot,  the girl from clueless ?
She could tattoo me all day !!! Love u Margot !!!
Now cut it and sell that toe on eBay. Lol.
She is so cute :)
Margot robbie can tattoo me any second of my life
The new Marilyn Monroe. Sexiest white girl living
Two in the pink and one in the stink
Am I the only one who loves Graham Nortons Suit? It looks really good tbh 😅🤷🏻‍♀️
If acting doesnt work out anymore...\nShe can make a living doing that... no problem :D\nLove it btw.... Humans are crazy, and this is the crazy i love! :)
Graham Norton needs some good anti aging skin care 👴

Leviticus 19:28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the Lord.
Who's that older guy I've seen him before but I can't quite figure out who he is
he wasn't considering if he wanted the tattoo. he was thinking how do I get out of this...
What a hot prod staff guy
would kill to let margot robbie touch my feet 😍
I bet that guy had a full-blown stiffy by the end of that..... i know I did😓😓😓
I'd get that tattoo no problem by Margo!
Get a tattoo from Margot Robbie on a popular TV show sitting next to Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Gosling, and Harrison Ford. Check.
Please know that JESUS LOVES YOU, JESUS IS LORD, AND JESUS FORGIVES. We are all sinners. We are all on our way to hell, forever. God does NOT want us to end up in hell, a place of eternal, conscious torment and suffering (Not parties). We can all live in eternal paradise with no pain and no suffering forever. It’s one place or the other. Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ Jesus took our punishment for our sins. This is a FREE gift. Many will never know how wonderful a relationship with Jesus is because they are afraid to ask. Try asking. What do you have to lose? Just ask Jesus into your heart and to forgive your sins. It literally costs you nothing, but will give you everything. God Bless.
Yoooo that thumb nail looked like she had no arm
Wouldn't be surprised if that got infected. She didn't wipe down or sanitize the area before tattooing
The look of sheer terror on Harrison Ford's face when he KNEW he was going to be singled out.
I'm a simple man, I see Margo Robbie, I click
Have I seen that Adam somewhere before???
Id let her tattoo my toe just so she can touch me. ID ask if i could put my big toe in her mouth as well
I'm willing to get a tattoo from her, even though i hate tattoos...\nThat's how much i love her! 😍
I'd pay alot of money to get a toe tat by that sexy beautiful creation of the gods, Harrison Ford!
Low class, tacky, sure signs of lowlife losers. I wouldn't get a tattoo if my life depended on it. And if a girlfriend of mine came home with one she can leave and try to be a girlfriend of someone who's equally as skanky.
This is cringy to watch XD
I love Harley but not this women. I think I'm in love with a character 😭😭😭😭
That should have been me
Harrison ford just wants to go smoke weed
THIS IS WHY GRAHAM NORTON IS MY FAVOURITE TALK SHOWWWWW
Are you alright?\n\nJust good.\n\nGives a big smile. I swear in his mind, he's chanting that he can't believe Margot is doing to this... Doing a tattoo on his foot. It's like his dreams just came true.
Harrison’s face when he was offered the tattoo 😂... I wish he had done it
Lol Harrison Ford and all of them are awesome
Hey Graham, did you know Kit Harrington was selling his car? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-MHoIyW4E0&t=1s

THIS IS DOPEEE 🔥😂
Adam is lucky af
Margot Robbie=yummy!!
I liked Reese Witherspoon until I watched this...
Go watch my vids :)
He was pretty cute .
Khali vs hornswoggle..
That made me happy
The second spear looks hurt
Liberals think this is child abuse.... Your going to jail now!
No kids were hurt at the making of this video.
Good way to get the kids tired and off to bed early. RKO into a pillow, nighty night lol.
I hope WWE sees this and gives y’all free tickets or something!!!! 😊
I was waiting for your video, and it was AWESOME\n\nSee you next year =D
When u know cuteness trends on YouTube
Hey you know all those disclaimers in WWE that say Please, Do NOT Try This At Home? They'll be the reason you get to pay out of your own pocket for your child's medical care for the rest of his life once he is paralyzed from the neck down cause his dumbass dad thought it was cool to encourage him to imitate pro wrestling moves even to the extent of jumping off a ladder. Great parenting. Remember these videos when you try to sue WWE for your heartache and medical bills.
Some quality father and son bonding right there !
I wanna to see a Swanntom bomb off the ladder.
We had pile drivers in our day. Now we have pick up wheel chair basketball games on the weekends if anyone is interested.
When the kid was shaking his hands, priceless.
Cant believe there is no perfect parent comments about how this is abuse etc
That little boy looks so happy!! Ohh wait... that's the dad!
Bless you dad!!   I thought that was absolutely darling!!  \n0:08  When he made the sign of the cross ..........Awwwwww!!   Really made my day!!
So, this is once a year..
Lmao this guys such a good dad
As a parent this really angers me you should be ashamed of yourself......... it's no way in the world I would've let him hit me with the leg drop from the latter I would've jumped up into a rko
508 people clearly don't have kids
G.O.A.T. video, end of story, get out.
A 20 second video #20 on trending🤦‍♀️
Nice mate you really cracked me up
When mom goes to the store
I knew he had it in him, the older guy had no chance.
This is gonna be my brother and his son 😂😂😂 OR EVEN DAUGHTER
When i was a kid ..I used to do this with my younger brother every day after dinner ....🤣🤣
Did... the kid hail mary before he jumped off the ladder??
Why is this called annoying? He looks like he's just having fun with his son
Admit it wrestling fan, you did wrestling some moves to your son more than once.
“I’ll set up the camera, son. You get the ladder”
Best part was that last slap one
Hopefully you monetized the video. Put the money in his college fun
To be continued: September, 2018
haha this is so cute\ni like the hair flip at the beginning 😉
The kid in the thumbnail is about to get a football head.
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS AND BE THE CHURCH!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH SYSTEM AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!\n\n\nRevelation 18:4\n\n4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues\n\nHowever, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:\n\nProverbs 7....
I once did this with my dad and it was awesome until I punched him in the balls.
See you next year guys!
This time plz don’t wait so long to make a new one
Dad of the year award goes to THIS GUY!

Thank you for doing this
Im glad and proud that you made this video because it brings invisible disabilities to attention. Everytime I go to a Doctor that doesn't specialize in joints or arthritis, they don't even know what it is. I'm glad this has been brought to attention more. I'm nervous for the future of EDS, but you make it seem like I can fight it.\nThank you.
There are black KT tapes you can find on Wish (the app)\nfor like $4 USD :D save more with strong tape and different colors\nMartina you are amazing FIGHT ON
Thank you Martina. When I experience anxiety I try to be thankful with what I have. #Buildaladder
We love you so much Martina! Stay strong
The overwhelming feeling of being alone in my struggle is what hurts most about my chronic pain. I'm undiagnosed at the moment. I love you and Simon so much for sharing your journey with us. It helps to remember that I'm not alone and I can do it because someone knows how I feel. ❤
Thank you so much for sharing this Martina! I have chronic back pain and I definitely have days like this. This really helped me. 🙂
I couldn't help it tearing up from the very start of the video. Thank you for showing this side of your life. You are beautiful, strong and inspirational. Simon is a blessing. Please stay strong. Hope new developments in medical will soon help keep the pain more bearable if not cure the disease completely. 💪💪👏👏
Martina it's absolutely incredible seeing you pull yourself out of these bad days. I am really thankful that you had the courage to make and share this video with us. ILY!!!
Thank you for sharing such a personal aspect to your life! ❤ Today was a really hard college day for me; I'm going to use #buildaladder to help me stay positive when school and life gets too overwhelming.
Martina, you have such strength. You have given me inspiration to pull myself out of the dark when things are wrong.
I get that athletic tape for my back and it helps a little. Having back issues at sixteen isnt cool. You're extremely strong! Don't forget that!
Martina, you are so strong and such an inspiration to me!  I also have chronic pain and depression, and you inspire me to build my ladder and just take life one step at a time.  Think of all the people who are still going because they were uplifted by your kindness.  My husband and I love you and Simon, and we have really changed our outlook on life thanks to your videos.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you guys!  <3
I can't write much because of pain, but thank you for everything. This video and the one about depression have changed my whole perspective about life. Stay strong and keep fighting. Much love <3
I really admire you Martina, your strength and joy in life make me so happy to be a part of this channel. Keep building that ladder!
ohhhhh my martina QAQ this is the first time I leave a message down here.All I wanna say is, MARTINA you're soooo great girl, you gave me so much power pulling me through my hard time that you can't even imagine, and you encouraged me so much not afraid being  different at school. THANK YOU MARTINA AND BE TOUGH GIRL! LOVE YOU
Hello -- I don't know if I've ever left a comment on one of your videos, but I've been watching them since the beginning. Thank you *so* much Martina for sharing this. <3 You are amazing and strong and I'm sure this took a lot of courage and vulnerability. \nI don't have chronic pain but I do suffer from moderate to severe anxiety and very frequent panic attacks. Your ladder metaphor resonates a lot with me, as does your suggestion of looking outward instead of inward on the worst days. This can be different with panic, but it really helps with anxiety and depression at least for me. When I have another day when my mind is trying to prevent me from leaving my bed, I think I will watch this video again.\nAlso, you've inspired me to leave my house for the first time today, to go to the gym no less!!
Wow, you are one amazingly strong Lady.
I like to crochet, and watch Netflix  when my Prosthetics bother me. Getting a coffee and going to the library if my legs aren't really bad is great too.  I like to surround myself with things that make me feel beautiful or are just fun. I love cheesey 80s music especially when I feel like this.
This has helped me so much!
I have dysautonomia. On most days I'm perfectly fine like any average person but with an extreme heat sensitivity. On days when its bad I have chronic pain, dizziness, bouts of fainting and collapsing, my knees give out, I have a constant fog on my mind making it hard to work, and it aggrivates my depression and anxiety. It makes it hard to get out of bed because I fear fainting, but what kills me most is that it is so hard to do basic tasks and makes me feel useless. This video made me feel warm inside. I recently was in a hospital because I collapsed on bricks and had to be given fluids to build up my blood volume. You inspire me. Thank you so much
Thanks for posting this.  It really did help me.  I'm still trying to switch doctors right now because the one I have right now is so frustrating and never takes me seriously.  For two things that were nothing to her were actually endometriosis and a tail bone that didnt fuse properly.  I'm beyond frustrated and feel like I need better care from my doctor.  My gynecologist after surgery had the nerve to say to me So it wasn't in your head after all.   I can understand your pain when trying to get out of bed in the morning though.  I can barely leave the house some days because I don't want people looking at me weird, but I keep trying on the sort of good days to get out.
Thank you so much for this. Love from Argentina
You're such a strong and beautiful woman Martina! Thank you so much for making this video, it means a lot to not only me but everyone else who has watched it. I know it must not have been easy to talk about it and just get through the day. But we're here for you! (and you always have Simon, too) :D Sending lots of love and hugs to you!
I absolutely love this video. It applies to everyday life. You're such an inspiration for sharing this, being vulnerable, and spreading the idea of building a ladder. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I could go on all day long till the sun comes up on what your problem is go take a few pain killers you be ok bc i know for a fact the painkillers is both your problem and your solution \nIf you do tomorrow what you did today youll get tomorrow what you got today go ahead and add that step to your imaginary ladder
This moves me more than any other of your videos.  Happiness is easy.  Pain and torment are tortuous.  As a member of the 2nd, I thank you!  Life must  be balanced.  Nothing I can write can help you.  But I'm glad to know that you're not alone.
I hope this doesn't offend you guys but have you tried marijuana to help with the pain? I know the leaves and flowers are illegal in japan but cbd should be allowed. I watched a buzzfeed vid where Kelsey [who has trigeminal neuralgia] found relief using Charlotte's Web which you should be able to import or have someone send you since its technically cbd. :( it makes me sad seeing you in pain Martina i hope you can find relief soon
Sorry for your pain .. hope it will get better soon .. you're so strong.. I had an accident in the gym 2 years ago and hurt my knee since then I stopped going there and gain 10 kgs and just lost hope as every time I pull myself to the gym my knee hurts and burning even the physio therapy I stopped it after 2 months as it hurts and nothing changed .. I'm well aware that I will lose myself this way but it's so hard to go to the doctor and do the therapy again with all that pain and sleepless nights it needs a lot of strength.. I'm trying to get back and start the treatment again but I'm still in tye avoiding phase
My english is very bad, but i love u martina!!! Keep figthing!!!
I love George Michael ! You're both great, so many smiles watching your videos 😊💕
Thank you so much for sharing. I wish I knew how to sew cause then I'd make you an arm brace that was cute
Martina and Simond I follow you two since the begining of your videos and when I saw you like that it breaks my heart but I know you have a great person next to you and millions of people who wishgood thing pray for you so you can have better days and we can have more happy videos  God bless the two of you guys
I just wanted to let you guys know that your videos helped me get through a hella tough time in my life. My father was suddenly diagnosed with brain cancer over 5 years ago now, and after a truly terrible 14 months of him transforming into a person that I did not nor cared to know, and suffering from something that took away his ability to live life, he passed away and I was momentarily relieved. Then 6 months later I became so depressed that I rarely went to school and my GPA dropped from a 3.9 to 2.8 by the end of the year. If it had not been for your videos and the people I still had around me, I honestly don't think I would still be here. I had some scary thoughts that to this day occasionally come back to haunt me as I have struggled to transition into adulthood and face my issues head-on. When I get depressed, I watch your videos and you guys never fail to make me laugh. I can't tell you how thankful I am to be able to watch the content you produce despite the issues you have had to face in your own lives. Thank you so, so much guys. I'll make sure to #buildaladder next time I start thinking those thoughts. Much love and support from the US. <3
Get out of your head and get out of your house, two of my biggest rungs!  I color, I drink tea, I watch funny videos, I listen to kPop, I go for a walk. I wear a favorite pair of earrings. I spend time with a friend or family if I can't get out of my head on my own. I shop for little gifts I can give my nieces and nephews. Every little bit helps.  I love you both, thank you for sharing this!
as someone with chronic pain you've always been such an inspiration. but sometimes seeing all the things that you do and all the energy that you had made me feel bad abt myself, that i couldnt push my self that far. thank you so much for showing us all what your bad days look like. just like everyone else w/chronic pain we try so hard to hide bad days, but hiding them makes you even more isolated. knowing im not the only one added a rung to my ladder
I've just recently subscribed after a friend sent me the Chinese gas station food video, and I am so glad I did so I got to see this. I'm in the process of recovering from ED-NOS and all of its accompanying mental and physical damages. I have chronic full body pain, which might be vitamin deficiencies but might be something more serious that we need to address next, no one is sure yet. There are so many days when making it to the couch is the great accomplishment of my day. \n\nThis is the first time I've seen the idea of building a ladder laid out like this. Sure, psychologists have talked about small steps, but it never seemed useful. What good is making it out of the house when all I'm doing it hurting? By showing this, you've inspired me to take those steps. It means more coming from someone who knows the pit personally, you know? I want to make sure every little victory means more to me now, and you've given me that. Thank you.
Martina did you try medical marjiuana? I read alot of articels and saw videos of people having chronic pain try going to a doctor to get medical marjiuana and said it was helpful more than anything they tried so hope it helps.. love you 😙❤
Thank you so much for sharing this. Really, I'm in tears. Not necessarily because I'm sad, I think I'm feeling good?\nI struggle too (most people do in some way or another right?) with chronic pain, mental health and more. Today, even tho I'm not in much pain as the meds are working, is a relax day. I was out a lot yesterday, I had a very productive day. Today my only chore was doing the laundry, and it was tiring enough. Tomorrow I'm going out again to exercise my knee because it's bad, also I'll be getting groceries. Friday, dentist. Weekend? Relaxing. I can't do a lot within a short time and I need a lot of breaks. Because of this I tend to be jealous of other that seem to have it much better (I know that may not be the truth, but it feels like that) and end up in a dark place and not getting out of bed until 4pm. I did not know of this #buildalatter but I'm very glad I found it and this video. I will remember what you said and tomorrow when I go out, after exercising I'm walking to a cafe with a smile on my face, get myself a latte and enjoy myself. That's the plan I hope to achieve. It's tough but I will get through it. Small steps for some, big steps for one. Thank you again for sharing this, it means a lot to me. Hope you got some nice things in the fanmail, something that made you smile.
My little things, besides of course relaxing & reading/tv/phone are: writing - journals, research, etc.\nMy love for Ghibli movies has allowed me to walk around with an imagination and appreciation for taking in my surroundings.\nTalking about ideas, supernatural, God, life- the extra-ordinary.\nMusic such as Foster the People, Phoenix, Kendrick Lamar, and many more.\nThe atmosphere- candles & scents, and if I can get myself to clean really good, enjoying that.\nSitting outside with my doggy and some coffee.\nPlaying guitar.\nI hope to actually enjoy art again someday or work on story ideas, I am just so critical of myself!! But I wont force myself to do something for fun if it isn't!\nIf I have money- movies, bakery, eating out, zoo, Shop Kawaii, Pet stores, conventions of any sort, road trip.\nDoing small things to care for other people or animals (like feeding the fish we breed an extra meal or bringing snakes new water, or going out to pick up some litter!)\n\nIt means a lot getting your advice because of what you overcome. I don't have physical pain anywhere close to what you or others must deal with, so I am glad you did this video to give me more insight into others who do. Mental and emotional pain can definitely contribute to a) lack of exercise b) lack of self care & c) stress causes physical issues of course. So to see you using the ladder concept to overcome such an obstacle actually makes me believe that the small things WILL help everything! ♡ Also Simon reminds me to appreciate my husband, he is a very patient person where I know many people would lash out at me for my mental and emotional struggles. I try to be there for other people when they are down too. Everyone has their own story and with our own personalities, we all cope differently but should all be taken seriously.\nI will never just 100% give up, I am here for the ride of life so I may as well stay hopeful and be kind to others even if some dont think kindly of me.
smoke medical weed it helps with the pain
You're an inspiration. Thank you for making this.
I needed this today. I have trigeminal neuralgia, and today is a really, really bad pain day. Thank you for sharing your pain. Thank you for helping me get out of bed today. You reminded me to look outside myself, and outside my pain. I went for a walk and caught some Pokemon at the park across the street. Thank you for helping me do that.
Thank you so much for this video!
We could totally pretty up your braces, Martina!  I am an artist and seamstress, and it's totally doable to reface those with a cute stretchy fabric/bedazzle them, or draw on them to make them feel more your own!  I would be more than happy to help, but I bet you also have artistic friends who would do it.
Thank you for sharing these moments in your life with us and shedding light on how to handle it as the person going through it, but also as the person helping someone through it. Both of you are an inspiration to me, I will be changing my life to help someone build a ladder and it lifts my spirits knowing we won't be alone so thank you for that <3
Shit thought had it bad in the head
You gave me great advice for me to help cope with my anxiety and depressed moods. Thank you for making a video like this. You are so strong and I am rooting for you to be mentally healthy even through the pain.
I think you are so sweet and down-to-earth Martina. I hope you can find someone to help you with your chronic pain. You are blessed to have a faithful, fun and supportive husband in Simon!! Just a thought, have you tried oriental medicine doctor? In the meantime, I would like to share https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhGI0X6jhSQ this link with you. God bless you!!
mARTINAA.. PLEASE GET WELL <3
❤️❤️❤️
Lol bruh I would just kill myself honestly fr
Thanks Martina
Thank you...
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
<3!!!!! Wonderful, insightful video. Thank you for sharing! <3
Thank You.
I feel so bad for her😭😭
Love and support to you💖
have you guys reached out to Annika Victoria for a DIY session? she lives with chronic illness and is a genius on super cute patterns and designs (including her health/mobility aids). I think you guys would get along great and it would make a great video =) she lives in Australia and she loves to go thrifting and craft shopping in Tokyo. plus, have you guys looked into dog cooling pads to put on top of your mattress? I think that might make mornings easier for you. also, did you know that there are knee, elbow and shoulder braces with cooling gel in them? but really, you guys should contact Annika, she's awesome! stay awesome yourself and live life as fully as you can.
Just wanted to say that you two are two of the most inspirational people I've ever seen. The way you both deal with any hardship thrown at you and still manage to stay overall so positive and just exude happiness is absolutely amazing. Martina you are such an incredibly strong person and the joy to experience in every small detail of life should be an inspiration to all of us. And Simon, your obvious devotion and love for your wife and how you support her and are always by her side no matter what is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.  I wish you both all the happiness in the world - you deserve it.
This hits me hard because I have immediate family with this condition (except they have the vascular kind, which generally doesn't involve chronic pain). It's truly heartbreaking watching them go through the bad days, the scares and the sudden trips to the hospital. I'm so sorry you have to experience this, Martina, but thank you so much for being such a strong, positive person who inspires all of us. We love you ❤️
Sorry to hear you have chronic pain - know the feeling. I have trigeminal neuralgia (also called the suicide disease - no cure & treatments for pain are hit or miss. Called so bc its one of the worst pain conditions known & the suicide rates for those with it historically have been over 20%). A popular story among communities is the spoon theory bc a woman described chronic pain to a friend as having a certain amount of spoons in a day & spending them on everyday tasks. Some days better than others, but once youre out of spoons you dont get them back & have to choose what you use them on wisely. It communicates how drastically chronic pain can kinda take over your life & influence every decision you make (ie: bad day & already used half the spoons just getting up & ready for the day = its not going to be a very productive day & you have to accept that limitation). Similar to building a ladder i guess. Do what you can & make peace with what you cant on any given day. A lot of people without chronic pain dont understand it, though, so i think bringing awareness to the experience of it - not just the clinical understanding of the words - is important. Im glad you shared this. Stay strong!
I have EDS as well, I suffer from constant infections in my cartilage, my SI joints, hips, knees and shoulders sublex. Some days I want to sleep forever. Stay strong
You're beautiful and give people strength. I hope that there are people out there who see that, and thank you for it,  and in turn are beautiful and strong for you (Besides the lovely Simon!). Been watching your videos since Korea, and love your positive vibes. Sending random love from a random stranger. Xoxo
You are an inspiration. Depression sucks, and it sucks even more when it's coupled with other illnesses. You are brave, strong, and just such a sweet person. You really make me happy that I found Eat Your Kimchi all those years ago... it's kept me happy and smiling daily. Thanks Simon and Martina. <3
Simon and Martina; I am 17 year old girl who has MPD. There's days that I don't have physical obstacles, but I have huge mental obstacles. It can be very challenging and I often find myself getting lost in dark places within myself with no place to go and voices that sometimes do not stop with their negative inputs and with family that spew negative words of it as well and such. I have found that the things you are saying to help with these and actually and seriously are true. Your videos help get me through so many things and there's no need to hide or be ashamed of the less positive side of you. Not at all. It shows that you are human, much like the rest of us and those emotions are something you feel comfortable sharing with your internet followers and family.  I envy you so much for taking what you're feeling and trying your best to overcome it. I really appreciate that you uploaded this video to express to us how much you actually trust us to expose yourself in your worst times and to let us know that you trust us to understand. I'm sure that everyone can agree that we love you and we hope you get better and that this family will continue to grow with the utmost love and support. You WILL get through this, girl. You are very strong, you have proved it just from the explanation of this video and seeing the other content you bring forth that doesn't show us that side. We all love you so, so much; Simon, Martina. <3 You will get through this with Simon and your interweb family!!!
Thank you for making yourself so vulnerable in front of us! Also this is probably one of the best videos I've seen that actually show people what it's like but is still positive. Wish you all the best! It is also encouraging to see the both of you interact and supporting each other. Actual relationship goals. I also suffer from Lupus and I have very similar days. To me, talking with God and having a dream to chase are the two things that keep me going even on the bad days. Sending blessings your way!
I am so sorry you are having to go through this pain!!! I will pray that God will give you healing and no pain!
How can somebody not like this video?! Then don't watch it! It is a serious subject who needs to be told.. I have a hidden disease too, but I'm just lucky that I don't feel it yet. Sorry! Just needed to vent...
today was a very bad day for me, my anxiety started acting up again. i was tembling and sweating alot , my heart feels like it's about to burst.. watching this video makes me feel more...grateful of the position of I'm in.. i think I'm not shaking as bad now. thanks Martina rly appreciate it.
Awww martina! I want to just give you a hug😢😢
Just watching this made me feel better I don't suffer from Chronic pain but I do have a very bad depression issue. From being sexually asulted, losing my house etc all the things that would keep me in bed all day or calling out of work constantly because my anxiety is over running me. I'm going to try this today and see if I can use this as a every day thing. Thank you thank you thank you. And hopefully one of these days I can send you another pig to make you feel better when days get rough.
Thank you for posting this
I am going through a lot of stuff right now with my own chronic diseases and seeing this video has really made it less lonely. I think at times chronic diseases can feel very isolating but the advice to build a ladder and get out to live life to connect with other things as best you can is such good advice. I think there is pressure to either stay home and act like a sick person or pretend it isn't happening and force yourself to do everything you normally would even if it is too much. For the most part the issues many of us deal with are not visible so they are hard to understand when we can't function at the level we are expected to. I had to reconcile that with myself that they way I live is going to be different and I can't get mad at myself for not being able to do things like a normal person because sometimes getting out of bed or the house is what you can do. I still struggle with the fact that I can't always do everything I expect of myself and that I should celebrate what I did get done. Sometimes the small feats are the biggest ones. \n\nSending good health vibes to everyone out there!
big big empathie hug for you sharing this.  thats awesome that you can make your babysteps towards little bit light in your dark days!
Must have been a really difficult task to film this. Cause even I wanted to hug her and say everything is gonna be alright, let me help you.
Thank You for sharing! Even tho we have different conditions.. I really appreciate that you show your strength. 👍
I developed some pretty severe tendonitis in my knees a couple years ago. I had never heard of #buildaladder before watching this video, and now I'm so glad that I have. Spoon theory has helped me a lot in energy management, but not in initiative. This video has helped me so much, and I don't think it was a downer at all. This video is full of hope.
Your videos are so inspiring and I will be forever grateful that you make them. I just wanted to let you know that you help many people without realizing. Let’s keep on building that latter ! ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for posting this this has helped me in more ways you can possibly imagine. I deal with a lot of health issues and severe depression. I just want to say thank you so much .
<3 loving the pig hat! This video helps me to understand my friend better, she has fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis (aka chronic fatigue syndrome) thank you so much for sharing :) please keep these video's coming :)
Martina, thank you so much for posting this. I struggle with depression and severe anxiety so I can relate. It makes me feel less alone to see you and so many people in the comments working to get by as well. One thing I like to do in addition to the things you mentioned is writing a few things I am grateful for each day. On really hard days, I open that up and try to remind myself of the good in my life. Getting outside even for 5 minutes to walk (or Uber) and see the world helps a lot too. Sending so much love!!!
Thank you very much for sharing, Martina. Not gonna lie, I had to cry to see you in such pain. But also you inspired me very much today. I suffer from depression and sometimes it's very hard to get out of bed and function through the day. Next time I have such a day I will build my ladder, thinking of you, my fighting female superhero. \nAnd Simon, you are the male superhero, I hope you know that. \nLove you guys. <3
I don’t usually comment on videos. But I literally cried throughout the video. I felt happy I smiled, had tears of joy. This hit home, I mean I have chronic neck pain from a injury. So I understand, I hope this video inspires others that we all need a ladder. #buildaladder
I love you Martina! You are so strong. What you said really inspired me. Thank you so much for the love that you share even when you're not feeling your best <3
I love you so much. When I was diagnosed I was terrified of how it would progress for me, but you give me this hope that even as it progressively gets worse for me I will be able to handle it. Thank you.
Martina u r great! it's sohard to share ur health problems with people. even tho i have another health disease the video was inspiring for me.for now the only thing helps me is thought that i am not ill i am just different. thank u for sharing.
I have pots, it sucks. FYI. It's connected to eds. Have you been tested for it? I know it wouldn't fix everything, but it might alleviate some pain and fatigue. Test is simple. Resting heart rate sitting vs resting heart rate standing. If standing heart rate is 20 bmp more, then you probably have it. If you do, you can ask me, I've been diagnosed for 2 years.
It's amazing how good Youtubers, watched over the years, end up feeling like old friends. I have so much love for you both and I am so thankful for all of the wisdom and laughter you have shared in the last 3 years I have been following your videos. Martina, you are a beautiful example of a woman embracing her struggles, embracing her femininity, embracing her badass and doing a really awesome job of living a life of gratefulness which shines into the lives of so many others. Thank you for sharing so much of yourself online, in such an honest and beautiful way. Keep fighting, building ladders and being the absolute best of the international community in East Asia 정말 감사해여, 정말 사랑해여~
try cannabis oil for your pain
My heart just shattered into trillion pieces.  Martina is actually one of my favorite people on YouTube.  When she smiles and laughs, it just plain makes me happy!  It's hard enough watching her lose challenges!  ;)  But to see/know her pain is like seeing it in a family member.  You wish you could take it on yourself so she can be free.  I'm grateful you made this video, though.  I think it's _really_ important for people to see real life on YouTube and not just fun and games.  I'm not a fan of everything being sexualized on this channel but I stay subscribed because Martina (very honestly) *_always_* inspires me and makes my day better.  \n\nAnd this _really_ ups my respect and admiration for Simon.  In a world where marriage is treated so lightly, Simon steps up and shows, in every way, what it is to love and be committed.  He's more of a man than most in this respect.  Martina, if love alone could cure, you would never even sneeze again because it's *_clear_* that you are loved greatly!
I’m in tears. I haven’t been out of my room in days, I haven’t eaten, I’ve been crying and getting so angry everyday. I had never watched your videos but this was recommended to me. You’re what I needed to watch. It makes me happy to see someone doing what you’re doing.
Thank you for sharing Martina! I struggle with chronic mental and physical illnesses and it's really inspiring and helpful to see others in a similar situation making the best of things. I know it's hard, especially to talk about let alone show others! So thank you thank you thank you! This video has inspired me to start building my own ladder! xoxoxo 💕
Dear Martina,\n\nI hope you are doing well. I've been watching you and Simon for just over 3 years now and I can honestly say, with my hand to my heart that you have gotten me and my friends out of some real dark, tough spots. I hope that we can do the same for you. Remember that we are always there for you. :D. p.S GIVE MEEMERS AND SPUDGY AND SIMON A BIG HUG!
Martina: Good morning Ducky\nSimon:Good morning my love\nMe OW MY HEEEEEEART 😭😭😭😭
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
When all else fails try cannabis.
Thank you Martina
You're amazing, Martina!
You are a liar and this is fake propaganda; here is why.\n\n1) The People's Republic of North Korea... think about that... North Korea calls itself a People's Republic and claims to be democratic. So... that's about as accurate as Antifa, who actively try to police what others say and try and implement a single party state where in said state has complete control over the society, declaring themselves Anti-Fascist.\n\n2) The SPLC declared Pepe, a cartoon frog, a hate symbol alongside many other groups which have nothing to do with hate.\n\n3) Muslim is not a race, it's a religion. You can no more be racist against Muslims than you can against Catholics. If you see brown skin and think Muslim then you my sad little friend are the racist for making such an assumption. Oh and there are a lot of white Muslims too, just fyi. \n\n4) The guy who attacked the Muslim woman was a Bernie Bro... you going to lump all of them in with him too?\n\n5) The extreme leftists are attacking people over words... yet it's a false narrative that the extreme left is violent... uh huh... \n\n6) Those who are on the side of free speech call these Nazis you showed, the legit Nazis not the 99% of people you call Nazi (like myself, a left leaning Radical Centrist,) idiots and constantly say they want nothing to do with them. Why don't they punch the Nazis you might ask? Because they don't believe that violence is an appropriate reaction to Nazis plus they're, I should say we're, smarter than you and know that if you punch Nazis, they get stronger. \n\n7) The left started the violence which is why free speech rallies and Trump rallies and what have you now have an infestation of Nazis, because it's hard to tell who is who when you have a mass of black clad Terrorists, legitimate terrorists as declared by the Department of Defense back in 2016, are hurling shit at you, screaming that you're *ALL* Nazis and trying to beat the shit out of you. Simple fact is it's hard to tell who is and isn't a Nazi as dishonest intellectual midgets like you use that term as a catch all; it's gotten so bad that I, somebody who abhors Nazism and see it as second only to Communism in wickedness, actually have to stop and think hey, maybe I should see what that guy is about when I hear somebody called a Nazi because people like you have turned the word Nazi from what it was to meaning anybody who isn't left-wing and isn't afraid to say so. \n\n8) It's not just that Antifa is violent, it's why they are violent that makes them totalitarian. They want to control speech, they want to keep people from expressing their views, they want to tell you what you can and can't hear, what you can and can't think. They are violent in opposition to words that offend them and believe they have, or should have, the right to shut down said words. \n\n9) Antifa has been a recognized terrorist group since early 2016, and before were simply unrecognized. They spent a whole year being completely *IGNORED* by the Media and the President (Obama at the time) who was briefed on their violence and told they were a Terrorist organization who then, when confronted with a petition to acknowledge them as such, said with a straight face (or a smile rather) that the White House does not declare what is and isn't a Terrorist organizations and dismissed any notion that Antifa were violent thugs. During the election Antifa was still ignored and when they would attack people at Trump rallies it was reported as Violence erupts at Trump Rally or other such headlines and would often paint the Trump supporters, who were outright the victim in the majority of such cases, as the violent ones. They continued to enjoy this level of media coddling all through the campaign and even into Trumps presidency when they rioted in DC and then continued to attack people. It was only when it came out that they were declared a terrorist organization damn near two years ago that the Media *FINALLY* said even a half unkind word to them and yet still there are more mainstream outlets *SUPPORTING* them than there are those calling them out on their violence. \n\n10) The Neo-Nazis weren't attack people before Antifa started up, you can go back to Yvette Go-Fuck-Herself attacking a person who was merely holding up a sign way back in something like 2015. This is not a defense of Neo-Nazis, on the contrary, they are fucking scum... as scummy as Antifa. However, they were a particular brand of scum that had been rendered damn near irrelevent until you scum cropped up and gave them a legitimate grievance by making yourselves momentarily even worse. Yes, the Nazis have now caught up to you and are being violent again but there is a reason they call the current right wing reactionary as it is all a reaction to your lot. \n\n11) That study didn't differentiate between mainstream media op-eds and more obscure ones. To compare CNN to JoesOpinionBlog.Tumblr.Nobodycares.Com is quite intellectually dishonest.\n\nAt this point if you don't see why this guy is a propagandist... you're too stupid to educate. Goodnight.
This is the only journalism worth a damn right now. This episode deserves a Pulitzer.
Many, many times, when someone, in the crowd, threw a bottle or rock, eliciting a police crackdown... the persons who initially threw said bottle(s) or rock(s) are undercover police. Who have been attending protests undercover for... decades.
Hahahaha!!  What?!!!!  The media is too hard on Antifa?  Yeah, that's the problem.  And too easy on those who Antifa is calling Nazis?  You are the best... NOT!!!!
Yeah, pretty much this entire video is biased, cherry-picked propaganda bullshit. Damn Cracked, you guys used to be good too. Sad!
many young men died in wars to prevent communism from spreading. I mean, now it's just stupid looking back on it now, it would never had reached the US. Until now
Aaaaaaaaannnnnndddd I will never watch another cracked video again. To actually try to justify the actions of Antifa is insane. And YES THAT IS  WHAT HE IS DOING. He literally said We have to keep countering their protests. But what about Antifa at the Ben Shapiro Speech? Where were the nazis then? Ben is an Orthodox Jew, so I'm pretty sure he's not a nazi or white supremacist. \n\nLet's be honest here - Antifa is a bunch on misinformed, stupid, violent thugs who want to silence those opposed to their insane ideology. \nNot unlike...\n\nNazis.\n\nThe difference is that I don't see many people defending nazis, like this asshole defends Antifa.
It's good to kill nazis..
Believing in the value of a Nazis life is Nazi sympathesizing.
Sartre is actually the embodiment of the horseshoe theory. He held that information about Gulags should be suppressed to keep the French Communist party unified. His quote is entirely accurate, of course. But it's worth remembering that the Horseshoe theory is useful.
Excellent video! A lot of work and patience, really well put together.\n\nI don't really feel the need to criticise violent protestors. They're punching Nazis, and that's OK. You can argue it's bad for publicity, but I've never seen a news headline that said\n\nNo violence at this protest, I guess antifa are correct and the Nazis are actually bad!\n\nYou can't win against a rigged media just by being passive enough. If it's not sensational, it'll just be ignored. So keep punching Nazis, and don't worry about the news.
I'm not able to fully convey my existing disappointment with you because text lacks the necessary capability to express both sarcasm and distain.\nYou're an asshole.  Fuck you.  \nNow that the expletives are out of the way, why are you so invested in defending black-clad masked rioters?
It's always funny to me how I always hear Americans talk about other countries with less freedom as if we're better than them. Yet our freedom is slowly being chipped away a little more each day and only a few people seem to notice. And when you point it out, people verbally attack you instead of seeing the truth.
James alex field jr. did get arrested and put in jail you liar
As this video got longer, I expected the piling on to get old.  Instead it got more and more incisive and profound.  Great work Cody, particularly for exposing the fraudulence of the right wing's alleged quest for free speech.
Alt right alt left... Fuck em both think for yourself  be a decent human being and take care of your family.... Dumbasses
Preach! They know exactly what they are saying, it's all about the rhetoric baby...
God bless you, Cody. You're doing the Lord's work. :)
I just finished an argument of Antifa being the good guys...cause the other side is full of crazy nazis. \n\nI'm starting to like this homeless looking guy. 👍🏻👍🏻
AntiFa is a terrorist organisation. Please don't try to paint it as something else.
LOTS of bullshit in this video. The guy who attacked Muslim girls in Portland was a radical leftist. He was an anarchist who was apart of the homeless community. He was a HUGE Bernie supporter and was one of the guys smashing cars with baseball bats during the riots after the election. The reason he attacked the women on the train was part of a dispute between factions over money. The homeless/anarchist faction vs the muslim refugees. It was a message to the Portland authorities, the Democrats, who control public housing and resources. During the midterm election the democrats even let the homeless army take over the sidewalks and parks. It got so bad the city was covered in a constant haze from out of control fires from homeless camps. Murders, rapes, and kidnappings have become the norm in Portland. And this guy was just a piece in the puzzle. Don't try to peddle your lies Cracked, Anonymous is watching.
Anti-Trump protesters facing 80 year in prison??? Is the US a communist state???
i really wanted to give this to you -- the rest of your think-piece had excellent points which i will abide by -- but still, you had four major failures:\n1) you kept confusing the various parts of these two fringes, alt-left and alt-right: antifa and neo-nazis are the violent elements of these groups, sjws and white supremacists are the ideologues, and communists and fascists are the inevitable successors of these movements; the violators, the ideology-obsessed, and the probable future generation are very much not mutually inclusive: so stop saying that antifa may have fair points, because they are defined as the criminal subset of the crusade that you think may be justifiable.\n2) speaking of clandestine groups, you also conflated hoover's fbi with the modern fbi. had you bothered to look more deeply into the classification of antifa as a domestic terrorist group by the fbi and dhs, you would have found out that this event occurred during the late obama administration, and that it is only the news of this that occurred under trump: the change is not recent. do your f*cking research, cody.\n3) everything sartre's quote and your additions said about anti-semites perfectly describes black-bloc antifa, such as being able to remove their costumes to rejoin society, yet you declined to mention that in any way whatsoever, besides a fairly general statement that broadly it's about hate and where it comes from and interacting with its purveyors.\n4) of these applicable statements, the matter of civility-sans-context news particularly needs to be pointed out: you mainly contended that the news has a fixed prejudice that historically has specifically chastised left-wing fringe violence while overlooking or moderating equivalent/worse violence from the political right. however up until extremely recently e.g. even as late as charlottesville, antifa had some mainstream support in america: previously journalists were writing editorials to justify the left's violent extremism, claiming it was the only effective deterrent to nazis, with a few even voicing their allegiance to antifa in their twitter bios. the news obviously just has a wandering neutrality bias, whose equivocating tide has simply turned now, and while you did touch on this slanted impartiality, it defeats your main argument.
A hypocritical video from hypocritical people.
It’s a bit clumsy (and wildly offensive) to still identify with blood soaked Nazi rags when it comes to the Right’s quickly growing ex-liberal base with the ex-liberal, now Populist Trump as the head of that beast.
I attempt to provoke a violent responce, you hit me, I'm in the wrong. Thanks Southern Poverty Law Center, you intellectually dishonest, disgusting, fucking leftists.
I really hate this dudes tone.. always.. so hard to make it through a video. Also sources would be nice for some of these things.
They are technically fascist. As they tend to attack people who disagree with them.
While I agree with the wrong headed slant that these journalists take, I feel like this video tries to hard at being antifa apologies . You could have done exactly what you want the newspapers to do; report on, don't pick sides on. I get the knee-jerk reaction to hate the 'evil right-wing-diet-nazis'. Antifa are no better. Anyone who can't settle differences with words during rallies or protests just shouldn't be there. Period. And you, reading this, are free to disagree. That's cool! Everyone is entitled to any opinion, so no hate. I just feel all sides should be judged pretty harshly.
I know this video is not to suppose to be pro antifa but you have to admit that it's feels like that. Neo Nazis are shit but antifa is shit that doesn't smell as bad. The lesser of 2 evils is still evil.
So, basically, violence in the political process is okay, as long as it's liberal violence... got it.
I really like Some News. The extent most media go to try to balanced and fair in a clearly unfair scenario is infuriating.
Brilliant and well informed as usual! Keep it up please!
Well done in describing a 16 year old kid as a scum bag, for trying to use pepper spray to protect his farther (who was the old man being attacked by Antifa).  also during the beginning of the year all the news media was praising groups like Antifa for protecting peaceful protesters from the EVIL Alt right, what this actually meant Antifa rioting to prevent one person Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking for being a Nazi (even though he is a gay Jew who loves black dick).  im not trying to say the right has done nothing wrong, but in recent moths and years the left has been violent, strawmaning, Cry-bulling, A-holes, the type of people who crys to the techer that your bulling them and then beats you up everyday cos the techers beleve them to be the victim of you. and i know your leftist comidens, but please the least you can do is take the piss out of both sides, after all everyone to the right of me is a Nazi and everyone to the left of me is a Communist.
dude your entire arguement gets lost in all your derailings.
If you know what fascism is then you would know that antifa is more fascist than anyone or anything they fight against. \nThey are also terrorists by definition as they are clearly and openly willing to use violence or threats of violence to pursue political agendas.\nThey are also racist because basically everything they say is blaming everything on white people and declaring white people to be evil based on nothing beyond the color of their skin.
I've been scared to watch this show (fearing it would be all sides are bad - ish) even though I've always liked Cody & his views but this is really good.
Is this your best attempt at comedy fake comedians
So... the way to cover stories about antifa is to... not cover antifa?
Thank you for the life hack at the end - useful litmus test! :-)
Antifa does counter protests, so they are way more violent. They are the aggressors. You cant just assume that white nationalists are evil and violent.
God damn, sometimes this guy is just right on point 👌🔥
antifa are evil and nazi,s are evil as well
Hi, I'm a commenter who thinks this video is about defending Antifa. I'm also a far right/alt-right/Nazi sympathizer who likes making poor counter argument. The point of this video flew over my head because I was thinking about how I love to suck on big furry animal balls \nThats all I see in the comments
More info about FBI letter to King. Not as simple as you think.  \n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/what-an-uncensored-letter-to-mlk-reveals.html
didn't the SPLC call Pepe a hate group?\n\nAlso, The other guys were pieces of shit too is not a very good defence of Antifa
Cracked, keep your political views to yourself and just be funny.Oh and all the people in those groups should be put to death.
Diet Nazis are P R O U D E B O Y E S
Teacher asks a class a question.   Many children get the answer wrong.  The teacher corrects them and the class gets upset.  The children point at each other and yelled at the teacher,  Jenny is the smart one, teacher,  are you trying to say she was as wrong as Jeff the dumb guy?\nThe teacher responded, Children, wrong is wrong. 
Antifa initiated violence for months before anyone retaliated. Neo nazis and conservatives took care of it. The end.
Some valid points were made but also some biased points were made. The biggest bias was Fascism is bad. You may agree or you may not agree. (I personally do agree). But it does undermine video as a whole because it isn't purely informative anymore. Violence protest is never the solution. Your type of government is still a democracy so use your voice and voting right to express your opinion. South Africa is tearing down statues of colonists and slave owners and putting them in musea. And as a Dutch person, I applaud that action. Artifacts like statues are part of the culture and therefore changed when the culture does. But history should not be forgotten so we can learn from it and never make the same mistakes again.
Uh.. So this whole video is a tu quoque fallacy argument?\nWe know that alt-right use violence. It is well established. Now you said that Antifa is less violent than the white supremacist, so we gotta give them pass?
People who are so eager to say that we have to let Nazis and fascists have a platform and speak should probably look into the Paradox of Tolerance. A society that wishes to remain tolerant *can't* tolerate intolerance -- otherwise, their ability to be tolerant will be seized and destroyed by the intolerant. It is essential that we do all that's permissible within the bounds of free speech to *not* let Nazis and fascists have a voice. Even if you don't think this should extend to violence, no-platforming is essential. That's one reason fascists and their allies so consistently demonize it as anti-free-speech.
Wow!  Best reporting on this issue I have ever seen.  And that is really sad. :(  \nI mean you did a great job.  But you are a comedy show, real news outlets should be doing this stuff.
Watch Vee's video he made on this vid.
Excellent video. I like it a lot. Keep up the good work, Cracked.
White supremacists:  Wants to ethically cleanse the United States through genocide or forceful deportation in order to create a white ethno state.\nAntifa:  Wants to beat white supremacist asses.\nI oppose all forms of extremism but in no universe are these two sides equal.
Cracked, how to defend a terrorist organisation. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I--9IHfM_Xs
So well done!
Fuck WaPo.
Fuck your whore mother for raising a spineless faggot.\nKill yourself you bitch!\nAntifa are terrorists
Smug fart sniffing going on here
BRING BACK EXCESSIVE POP CULTURAL DISCUSSION!!
This is so much nonsense. Important to remember who started this violence: Antifa back at the February Milo event in Berkeley.
So because one group wanted a fight, it was okay to fight them. Also it's just as easy to say the right wing group may be armed because antifa keeps showing up and attacking them...
This trash just reminds me why I unsubscribed a while ago. lmao
I never expected the best journalism to come from Cracked.
Holy crap this is on point, this needs to be shared on every platform
So the Berkeley protests was Antifa being provoked to smash windows and destroy school property and attack anyone (not just Nazis and white Supremes but ANYONE) that even slightly disagreed with them? \n\n This is bullshit. \nThe driver that ran those people over in Charlottesville got arrested and charged with murder.\n\n I listen to the news everyday. Antifa's names is almost never mentioned, the only time they are is when they are made to be the good guys or victims. Everytime its white supremes or nazis that start the violence.\n\nYeah, white Supremes and Nazis are bad but that does not make Antifa good guys. Nor is it okay down play what they do by saying the Nazis started it, Cracked.
I wonder if white supremacists were actually dressed as ANTIFA people (their faces not seen) in that incident of vandalism? That kind of tactic is not unheard of.
Been watching u for a while, this isnt funny, its some of the best jornalism in the states
To be honest both groups are compete and utter scum. Fuck the Neo Nazis and Fuck Antifa. Both groups show just how far humanity can fall. We need more people to be able to just meet in the middle on shit.
There's a video by ContraPoints that deals with the subject of whether violence has to be the answer to some alt right happenings (specifically that dude who punch the nazi that time) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEyL1rDe60w
This was both funny and very informative. Thank you for posting.
If you wear a mask or bring weapons to a protest rally, you are a bad person. Period. \nThat said, the Alt-right is a bigger problem.
I'll save you 23 minutes of your life you won't get back watching this love-letter of apologist drivel for domestic terrorism, here's the abbreviated version:\n\nCody thinks that Antifa's domestic terrorism and violence is ok because other hate groups commit violence too...
Both sides are violent HATE GROUPS AND USE FASCIST TACTICS
Fuck this country. Honestly im sick and tired of pretending this country is so great with nazis walking about inciting genocidal terrorism
Cracked: Antifa is not as bad BECAUSE!\nAntifa apologism...geez, Cracked, how far you've fallen.\n\nSeriously, this the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  One side wants to be violent to people based on class, the other wants to be violent to people based on race.  How the fuck is one better?  You think the people inside the building that the Milo protesters set on fire heaved a sigh of relief upon learning that Antifa wasn't doing it for racial reasons?  They're both two sides of the same collectivist coin.  Actually, if your metric relies solely on racializing then, yes, Antifa are racists too, just toward a different group because they do explicitly advance this notion that only one race is truly evil, only one race is responsible for all the world's ills, and that the world will be a better place once _those people_ don't exist as majorities anywhere.  100 million dead from Communism, but, hey, they're not Nazis so special treatment is in order.  Certain types of hatreds and violence are less bad.  This idiot is even citing the damned Southern Poverty Law Center to make his point.  That should tell you what point he wants to make.  Even when there are no counter-protesters or white nationalists to be found Antifa still manages to show up, beat people, and destroy property, but for some mental gymnastic reason it's less immoral than Alt-Right violence.  Why?  Because someone was killed by the other side in Charlotesville?  It's not by design that Antifa hasn't killed anyone yet but by luck, so Cracked is only slightly uncool with Antifa throwing bricks and explosives into crowds of their opponent, with them spitting heads open with blunt objects, or with them setting fires and trying to stifle free speech, but they're not as bad because...reasons...fuck you, Cracked.
How can anyone possibly walk through life with the impression that the KKK and Neo-Nazis are anything but reviled? If you could produce even ONE person who would be even the SLIGHTEST bit surprised to find that everyone else finds these groups sickening, then I will eat a car and set my face on fire. The idea that these hate groups are just given a pass or whatever is fucking absurd.
oh wow, american media sucks at their jobbs, well nothing new. Still does not change the fact that antifa are fascists. Causes stopping people from expresing their views, with violence, is fascism. True the ones they were going against were fascists/racists/biggots/generalskum, but still does not change the fact that Antifa uses terror attacks to try and stop people who voices views they are not okay with. This includes people who just thinks that they should stop burning their car, or people that are just trying to talk about the issues that are around. But hey, they are totaly not terrorists. (hamburg anyone?) Now sure America is a fuck bucket, still Antifa is just another problem, sure one thats 1 step away from the IRA.\nBut to be honest if you ask me, let people have their protests, and ignore them. If they break the law, well arrest them, if not ignore them. If people don't even pay attention to a cause, that cause dies there.
Everyone should watch this show
On unrelated note how has everyone here say antifa I've been saying it as anti-fa some people say ant-e-fa is there a proper way of saying it.
This video still has less views than Steven Crowder's undercover video of antifa https://youtu.be/fFvH1Njg2rM. Funny considering this channel has more subscribers. The people have spoken with their views, and Cracked is losing.
Antifa did vegas.
What a dishonest video.\n\nFake News.\n\nCracked defends terrorism.
Thank you.
Doing good work Cody
http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/crackedcom-and-their-poor-coverage-antifa
Antifa apologists need to just hang themselves.
Hahaha deandre harris started that fight cuck
Keep it up Cody.
Cracked is leftist bullshit
River particular chop aklll weigh next laugh gray speaker news.

Nazis are nationalist socialist. If you aren't socialist, you aren't a Nazi.
Okay im only 3 minutes in but im just gonna get this out of the way: Antifa isnt a group. We are anyone who is against Fascism. Fuck, Captain America, by definition, is antifa. Anyone claiming to be a leader of antifa is a lie.
Canada need to arm itself with nuclear weapons, America has been taken over by the Alt-Right. We need to use the same strategy that France uses which is to have just enough weapons that no nation will attack.
excellent piece, but why is it that journalistic rigor and integrity has to be upheld by the comedians and pop culture creators these days?
This guy is an idiot!

SZA SHOULD HAVE FEATURED THIS TRACKKK 🔥🔥
AB will propose to the water cooler next game
Big Ben on the decline
He was wide open & Big Ben didn’t see him. & all of the sudden maybe that’s why he’s mad
This better be talked about on all the sports shows since they always do with O'Dell
Don't turn into Odell please AB.
can't blame Antonio. Wide opened and Ben throws an incomplete pass
Don't worry. Nobody was watching.
Todd Haley almost got stole on lol
Sorry guys.
Antonio Brown having hoe problems. 😂
Is throwing a temper tantrum really necessary?
Get that man the ball!! #tonytoetap #GOAT #callGod
Jimmy smith had him on lockdown
The cooler kept its cool though\n(Thank you, I'll see myself out, etc)
I did the same thing because I got ab on my fantasy team lol
I understand he was upset but to pull away from the coach and throw a cooler is not exceptable
I don’t blame him, Ben could have gotten 6..
I love it. Big Ben is terrible thus far.
I don't see this big deal here. He lost his temper, so many players do the same thing, they just throw their helmets instead.
me me me me me me me me me me me me me I's the best me me me me me me me I's want Mangini and Kapernick with me here with the Steelers so all us showboats along with  A Bell can be on same team together.  Me me me me me me I's the best, team play not important to me as I's the best, i's the best i's the best!
Ben is just not using Bryant and brown well...his got big time players...but not using them to the full potential . ..i hope he retires ...his done man
Would you be mad if you were wide open on the other side of the field? Just curious
When AB gettin' nothing, you know Rothlisberger is on the decline.
keep the rich super slaves under control,....right?
Roids do that
Anger management
Looks like he's mad at the police and military to me.
What a baby
Lol shut tf up brown cuz he didn't even see your stupid ass
Ben and the other 2 Amigos from his draft class or trash now.
He better apologize to that cooler if he scores a TD next week... 😂✊️
I wouldnt want Haley touching me either.
This was just too funny, but All I can say is it's AFC north football. I mean things are gonna get heated what do you expect. And AB is a competitor and he probably knew how much that TD could've helped us since typically when we vs the Ravens those games are usually decided by 7 points or less
It was just the black coming out of him, nothing new.
I've watched Mike Tomlin teams look progressively less imposing, year after year. Even Ben said last year, regarding the Patriots What rivalry? We're the little brother
Take a knee for that kooler.
What a jerk its not like that caused them a loss. Get well soon Cooler.
Antonio is a competitor he wants to be the best he can be he trains hard and studies hard to do his job and when you do your and your wide open for could have been a touchdown it's heartbreaking.
Well, if you can not make a play on the field (get on TV).  (Get on TV) Make one on the sideline. :)
I think his teammates were clownin' him the whole game for some reason. Watch the full game, they all did the signature AB first down drop
Its Enough Clear out this coaching staff.
shouldve been a TD watched the whole game , Handle that better Ab go to yo QB and say yo bro im open take yo time dont snap on yo team and yo OC . disappointed in u from that .
Man this is gonna look bad for him and the steelers organization. First not showing up for the anthem now you're best player is acting like a fool. C'mon now guys this isn't steeler like
I guess Antonio never dropped a pass that could have been a first down or touchdown.
He just mad he didn't get to twerk in the endzone like he usually does.
Ben on the decline FAST.
What was Ben looking at!
If this was Odell everybody would be like he a crybaby
Did everyone already forget about how the falcons blew a 25 point lead.
when will he propose to the cooler?
Now he needs to fight Josh Norman to be the new Odell Beckham
The cooler was wide open as well
This is what happens when you devote your entire life to a game that elementary school aged kids play in the backyard.
Pathetic. The dude is being paid millions and yet he acts like a little kid
The moment you realize your offense is more dysfunctional than the Browns offense. Life as a Ravens fan. 😞😒
Maybe he should take a knee to bring this attention to ben
Just another self-centered monkey.
Under control haha that's the opposite of the nfl
Come on Brown, don't stoop to Obj's level.
I wouldn't blame him. He was wide open and close to possibly scoring a Touchdown
Rumor has it AB apologised afterwards and asked the cooler to marry him.Prenub ofcourse.
So nobody cares that an NFL qb didn't see a wide open AB??
Some People Take a Knee. Some People Throw a Cooler. \nThe Struggle is Real!
He's mad cause his barber canceled last minute :/ AB didn't look as fresh as he always does
Its ok when Brown does it but when Odell does it, hes a baby, and he complains too much!!! Makes sense.
Tbh, I'd be angry too. He woulda scored if Ben saw him.
They're called the Pittsburgh Steelers, not the Antonio Brown's.
that wrong man he did nothing to you... that cooler had a family
Sit that p.o.s. !!
I LOVE IT.
better him than Odell
Thank god for Julio
Hes such a baby
Like that before
Soft
Were all boy cotting baby
Cooler lives matter. Petulant child.
Spoiled brat
spoiled
DUDE Dont become ODell Crybaby ..... Keep the skills loose the Tantrums ..
That's the first time I have ever seen brown get mad
Jesus Christ is Lord and is the only way to Heaven
antonio brown needed to cool down but he keeps on knocking over coolers. #coolerlivesmatter
Not the Antonio brown ik and love
Showing this tantrum to the masses is why Terrell Owens is not in the hall of fame a few morbid these and Antonio might get this label.   Hopefully T.O. makes it in next year
Man ppl are dumb this is part of the competitive fire that gives AB an edge. He cares about winning. It was a huge missed opportunity and those moments are super frustrating for any athlete that wants to win. There’s a reason he’s the best in the business #businessisbooming
Brown is prima-donna just like Odell Beckham.
Just another overpaid child throwing a tantrum for not getting his way. Poor big baby
Every right to be angry.  You are the best wide receiver on the team.  You should always be the first option.  Big Ben is declining.
If Odell is immature then Antonio Brown is what.......?
“Ab is better than obj because ab doesn’t throw tantrums”
He is too expensive to have on your line up and not consistent.
I'm taking a knee for water cooler oppression and Steeler brutality.
Meanwhile the score 26 - 9 was the BIGGEST margin of victory that Big Ben has ever had against the Ravens, w/ the Stillers winning 10 out of the last 22 games in Baltimore. AB can't rejoice over a W? #smh
What's the NFL?
I would have made sure he wasn’t open
Steelers are crybabies
Not supried it's the Pittsburgh Kneeleers
Ben is stupid and about as good as Jay Cutler right now? Give Jay all of Ben's weapons and all the sudden Jay isn't as terrible any more. Antonio will have to be patient with Ben. Ben doesn't have the vision of an elite quarterback and is losing his physical skills rapidly. Ben has mentally retired and will not be able to lead this very talented team to another SB victory.
I already know no ones gonna talk about this, BUT if Odell gets mad no no that’s mainstream news all over social media
While I’m at work in my dry office some people are actually living life out there 😔🚶🏾‍♀️

I can't understand he puts all his words together talks so fast lol

He’s got the Kylie Jenner effect where his hand and his face are two different colors
i bought an amazing beauty blender off of amazon for like $1. ive been using it for years and ive replaced it twice
You should go on your to Minneapolis Minnesota to the moa
is it just me or does the knockoff look better than the originals??
ummm not when ya poor bitch of course you wouldnt know anything about that tho >->
I thought you left YouTube
both sides of his face literally look the same
Both sides look exactly the same
dude you talk so fast, it’s hard to understand what you’re saying.
actually thought the right side was the real products side lol
I have to watch his videos on 0.75 speed 'cause otherwise I feel like rushed and anxious. Just me?
You look good with makeup on but you look Amazingggggg without it and if I had your teeth I would never stop smiling and your intro is the best ilysm😍🤧🤤💕💕
The thumb nail looks like his about to burst into tears.
Omg! Does anyone else just look at james' beautiful eyes? I'm not creepy or anything I just live for the color of his eyes!
i got a beauty blender from tj maxx for $5 and it blends so well. y’all wasting money.
I couldn't stop looking at his lips when he was talking after coloring half and half😂

Your eyes r cute
Your eyes tho🌟🌟🌟🌟
ilysm
YAY I LOVEVTHISVNHRYNBRGEFEF
I absolutely love your makeup tutorial videos, you are an amazing makeup artist James!! <3 but, the real makeup products look WAY better than the fake products. You still made them both work, so slayyyyy James!!
Your foundation is too dark for you boo
i always think i know a little bit about makeup until i go back online and watch james and manny.. :__:
i love this series omg i want more!!!! but i have to be honest, this music annoyed me the entire time watching it
Kim posted about the KKW fakes on her snapchat calling the fakes out
Why is his audio shit?
HILARIOUS!! Dat KKW lip is killin it!😂😂 thank you for this video! I hope & pray to the fuckin gods that your face/ lips are okay! Love you, James!!
Slightly more fat James what are you trying to say jk jk ilysm 😂😂
What's the background music called at 2:19?
Are you part of the Illuminati because those three moles on your neck make a triangle!!!
The real version looks better.
you forgot to blend your nose contour inbetween your nostrils 👃 but you're looking beautiful as always sister 💖
THIS GUY IS A GOURGOUS PRINCESS OMFG Like if u agree

Anyone know which videos he sings in
Wow that was a huge difference.
What are you beating your face with?😉 I'm super dirty minded
Video bothers me\n\n\nWhy I wonder?\n\n\nOh yeah\n\n\nCoz I have no money for the “real” stuff
I love your hair now James!😘 it looks so good sista!
I'm so glad you give the disclaimer in here that it's dangerous to buy knock off makeup. You are so awesome
“And now I’m in-shook” I’m ded😂😂😂
This kid is pretty cute!
How does he pull a darker foundation shade then his neck so well I am confusion.
James, a question!! Would you ever consider vlogging? I find you so intriguing. Thank you for sharing your talent and life with us. <333
omg the real versions look so much better, if i actually had money and was good at makeup i would buy it XD
when he said musty crusty in my mind i was like DUSTY GRANDMA ASS BITCH TRYNA POISON ME WITH AN APPLE

I love James but his foundation looks a little to dark for him
He got mad about his eyebrow looking bad but he's the one that messed up the brow and he said the tip isnt defined but he broke the tip of the brow liner
Uhm it looks exactly the same?
does anyone else see the contour line on the underside of his nose throughout the majority of the video.... did he forget to blend it out? lol
Omg why is James so freaking pretty and cute ?😫🌹
take a shot every time he says in the slightest
I’m getting so sick of the word “shook” and all. But anyway. LOVED this video ❤️
You talk a little bit too fast for me😂🙏🏼

Wtf is it with beauty gurus and long intros like hurry the f up
Please zoom in more when you are doing shadows? I hear what you are saying, but can't see very well. Love ya, as always.
Take a shot every time he says pigmented
FUCK BITCH!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN YOU NOTICE SOMETHING THEN YOU FOCUS ON THAT THING FOR THE REST OF THE VIDEO!!! BLEND YOUR FUCKING CONTOUR BITCH
only for me his eyes looks like goats eyes????
This video told us a thing that a good looking makeup not depends on products but his skill of applying makeup 🙄
He has lipstick on his nose 😂😄
Is he married?
Mine are sculpted & sexy
Both eyes look like crap! Wtf who wears those colors!! Gag

I love you so much, you are so much like me in so many ways. I look up to you so much, keep doing what your doing and don’t let haters turn you down! I am basically you as a 13 year old, but thank you for doing your YouTube channel, it gives me so much advice and just makes me feel happy watching your videos.
I love how she moves the camera she's like a cartoon character 💖😂
What video were you girls all filming for? Link?
Kandee Johnson #2 \nI really envy you tubers, it isn't stressful work.\nMeanwhile my job is 13 hour stressful job days,  get home at 6 or 7, come home shovel food in my mouth watch some tv with my family and go to bed for another day. Thank god for the weekend. Reality. I know millions can relate because I've had this conversation before with average folk.

My god Amber really suits that blonde wig !!
Aww my dream !!!!!!! Swimming in diamonds....a girls best fantasy everrrrr !!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖💎💎💎💎💎 Loving the BLONDE wig lady!!!!! 😄
@Amber Scholl I think that Amber should pierce her nose with and get a little looking like diamond earing I know she won't pierce it just because I want, but I think she would look cute and show off her diamond style and always have that little diamond in her nose or even a pierced belly button! Love you Amber! So just like it up little glamies so she could see my comment and think about it.💋💖💗💅Btw this is just an idea so no need to do...
my mouth was like O because I'm shocked that amber still looks so great in blonde
I have a great idea for one of your videos, you should read all your fansss messages on instagram. 💖 like if you agree 💖
ASIA JACKSON!!!

That smile at the end was so forced lol but I still love him.
WOW literally sounds just like his music video, not a lot of singers are that good.. mad props to Sam smith
It is impossible for me to watch him without smiling.
Not to take away from Sam, because he is super awesome (writer & vocalist), but I can hear this being a Beyonce song... Imagine a Beyonce song written by Sam Smith 😱
Too Good at Goodbyes in the Live Lounge
His transformation is outstanding 💛
The fact that he sounds exactly like the track and even better is amazing .. we love you Sam Smith 😩❤️
I made a parody of this!

Sam Smith voice is perfection! ❤️
He just makes it look soooo effortless!! Amazing vocals!
Gays rule the world with talent, thanks sam 😍

one word to describe sam smith: perfection ♡
the satisfaction i expierenced when i heard the same voice ......SAM SMITH THANK YOU FOR SOUNDING THE SAME FROM YOUR STUDIO VERSION TO A LIVE STAGE DURING THAT AMAZING PERFORMANCE
I can't wait for his new album. He's an angel

Voice so breakable yet so strong. One on a million
He looks so different but a good different.
😍 I love this song
I get chicken skin with his voice
He sounds so good on every song!!
That smile 😌😌 he looks hot af😍😍😍  ♥♥♀
i love how he effortlessly sounds exactly the same live as in the studio version

ca c'est de la voix !!! hein justin? ;-)
suaranya bagus banget kapan gua bisa kayak gitu
Hey guys! There's a little corolla easter egg somewhere in here, so hopefully I didn't make it too obvious! Also like I stated in the video, I live in Texas and I personally know people who have been affected by Hurricane Harvey. This means a lot to me, so if you want to help out with relief efforts here, in Puerto Rico or in Florida (or anywhere else) consider downloading Tab For a Cause completely for free; http://tab.gladly.io/r/reallifelore. You guys are always amazing :)
I laughed so hard at the title lmao
Delete this. Do not give trump the idea
Why is this channel obsessed with toyota corollas
That’s dumb as hell. Whoever proposed that should loose their degree wtf
This proves that Sharknado is a lie
Useless video! You can't absorb energy by adding more to it, So obvious. Why do we even have a video for this.
In tHE EYe of A hURRIcane TheERE IS qUIet
It makes a super duper mega nuclear reacting hurricane shooting miniature black holes into space destroying Satan so his tungsten scale triangle collection could implode into a 5 mile long ice cream sundae also destroying Poland for some reason while the hurricane goes to the sun to make green peppers not a thing anymore still keeping Timothy the sad clown alive intell 109 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and sea cucumbers mutate and take over the world at the year of 2464.
There are acts of god you cant fight, you see a hurricane you have to get out of the way. But suddenly when  your in a Jager, you can fight the hurricane and you can win- Riley Becket.
Hopefully our potus doest decide to test this out.
This guy talking about bullshit. So what happen. If u drop eye of storm? . There has no energy. And core of hurricane. Im not the scientist but. Wonder even if it is strong. Eye is the core. Would it work?
I was just wondering if there is billions of damage what about the jobs created with the clean up & rebuilding of the damage? There's always a silver lining to storms it may not be the best thing about this topic but it's still a way of looking at a tragic catastrophe!
Nice biased opinion. ..Puerto Rico's humanitarian disaster..the facts are really out there that they had supplies there even before the storm hit and their truck drivers were busy taking care of their own problems at home and neighborhood to even show up to deliver goods..just sounds like you're trying to make it to be trump's fault like the fake media does
What if you dropped a nuclear bomb into a sink hole? Or volcanoe?
You should make a video where a united Asia or uniting the americas and compare them
does the extenstion use your computer to mine bitcoin?
As a kid, I always thought that we should stop a Hurricane/ Tornado by tossing a giant boulder on top of it with a catapult
what if a hurricane's energy was somehow harvested to power stuff?
Nah bruh. We all need to do the “Kami Kami blast” facing the hurricane to push it back
Is there a way to harvest energy from a hurricane?
Weilrd therory... Putting energy, heat, into a hurricane shall weaken it... Putting a Tsar bomba into it, would boost the Hurricane, by rising a lot mor superheated air, the pressure will drop immediately. Yes cooler air replaces - but its warmed up by the ocean: the more wind, the more effective.\nYou'd just feed the beast.
Here is a viewer from puerto rico, love the video :)
I think you’re brilliant! It is so nice that you’re finding ways to help support charities. You’re my favourite YouTuber ever!
238 bombs in the excat spot wouldnt destroy the ENTIRE CIVILIZTION AS WE KNOW IT u fuking dumbshitt. it would jsut make a explosion in the area NOT SOMEHOW KILL EVRYONE AROUND THE WORLD so fuk u stop with these videos that you pull out your ass everytime you want to make millions.
Clean bomb doesn't mean radiation free , it means radiation won't last long. You're still gonna die right now.
it wouldn't work cause  the hurricane would evolve into teenage mutant ninja hurricane.
Build a wal around the hurricane
Why don’t we just take the hurricane, and push it somewhere else!
my nigga out here in texas :') tears to my eyes..so when's the meetup??
Hey!\nDon’t give North Korea any ideas!
0:50 let me stop you right there. The most outlandish theory is dropping Toyota Corolla's into them. LOL.
why can't we just make a non nuclear bomb that is just full of air then boom done.
I got hit by Irma almost a month ago, and it was quite fun going into the storm Lol
Before i watch video if the tornado keeps going we just fucked up more from all the radiation in the bomb so we just made it worse if it wirks like how i think\n*Hurricane not tornado
im sure it would of destroyed the hurricane\nive watched real nuke films and they took away the clouds durring the explosion and clears the sky .
Hey RLL, I was wondering, since you've done a video on whether a volcano can destroy the world, can you maybe do if a hurricane can destroy a world?
The country Trinidad and Tobago are lucky with all the recent hurricanes, they nearly got that country
You'd get nuclear winds.
Jim Kong Un will be able to do this
Thanks for making this video.  It truly would be a lunatic idea!
I live in Texas
XD when America like shit there's a hurricane that's going to wipe all of America what are we going to do Mr . President \nTrump: Bomb the shit out of it...
This is my favorite channel to watch while doing homework
*Nukes a hurricane*\n*Creates a giant tsunami and an even bigger hurricane*
Let’s Try It!! RIGHT NOW!!!!
I live in Florida,and it is VERY hectic...trees are down, Roofs are down too
lol  there's one problem with this video; ITS COMPLETELY WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!
soooo the moral of the story is... bad idea. reeeeaaaalllllyyyyy bad ideaaaa....
why would you do that \nget some h e l p
wouldn't it just spray radioactive material into the hurricane? so it will just give the whole US cancer if it goes through it. errrr not particularly sure that would solve many problems
but what if there is a way to destroy a hurricane before it could actually make landfall and cause any damage? \nme: and then make fallout which is way worse than a hurricane
its so funny how our standard answer to everything is just like.... Nuke it!
So... It turns into a radioactive Mega-Hurricane...\nCool.
a tip when thinki g abkut the tzar bomb. it was suplosed to be and desighned to be 100. not 50 megatons. they only tested her at half power. just saying
I like his intro music
It will rain gold.
Your man sounds like a dick
We should take the hurricane and push it somewhere else
150 kilotons max? you could just use a little boy (hiroshima) or fat man (nagasaki) easy. those nukes are under 30 kilotons
i bet it was an American that thought to nuke a hurricane.
hmmm why we not use a tsar bomb because the radiation in the water...
Nuking a hurricane? reference to sharknado 2.. but they used a special bomb to destroy the sharknado
Why dont we all  just pray to god..how about having a little bit of faith and hope..
I'm interested in downloading the extension, but I also wonder what they do for money? Do they track the websites you go to or something?
I'm really curious about Puerto Rico since the hurricane.\nIt seems like America isn't helping them enough and I think it could go three ways:\nPR does nothing.\nPR becomes a state so crises like these in the future will be treated equally as any other state.\nPR secedes the United States, or at least has a _very_strong separatist movement.
*Climate change isn't real*\nSays a dumb woman with a half muted voice due to stuffed nose.
my name is Maria and why would a hurricane be called Maria ;-;plus I was born in 2009....
This is America right here! HAHA Somethings causing trouble? Blow that shit up!
I always read it as REAL LIFE WHORE😭😭
Trump told Puerto Ricans that what they just had was not a real disaster, just a large storm. Then he explained them what an island was.
what if an hurricane somehow gets into the mediterranium sea?
is costliest even a word
This is the most American video title ever.
What would happen if you dropped a nuclear bomb into a black hole??
what if idid anal with a hurricane
You get a Catalina Wine Mixer
Some ppl should never have been born.
hook hurricanes up to hillarys email server and watch it just get deleted.
Just stop living where hurricanes happen all the time.
And so an atomic bomb is not the most powerful thing on earth.\nBut by taking away a small amount of energy could cause a dominow effect dont know how to spell deal with it so it would be a good idea to heat up the air under the hurricane and making the displacment not there with simple earth heat batteries adding heat then taking heat thus solthing global warming and devistating desasters...
i was in the area where the hurricane hit texas right before it did. so glad i left when i did.
Have the Flash run around in the opposite direction
north korea will do that
Trump most def watched this
What about hydrogen bombs?
Use duct tape!
Hydrogen bombs
Ask them politely to go away
Your voice sounds totally fake
#nukeharvey
0:57  MY IDEA !\n\nAW
Possibility 1 NUCLEAR HURICANE\nPossibility 2 huricane flings nuke some where else\nPossibility 3 huricane on weed
But.... Why!?
You came for 3:28
LOL he said Hiroshima wrong
1:14  Jack R. Weed would fit better
would probly sling radioactive moisture every where
kablewy
Drop Toyota corollas
Thank you for this. This glimpse into the reality that exists in the BVI right now does not exist, and people need to see this to understand. Thanks Sam.
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Wonderful documentary showing the resilience of these beautiful people and the strength of community in the face of such devastation. Thank you Sam Branson ! Shared to several groups...
Amazing story. Keep up the good work!
Thank you so much Sam for your big heart. This is a very moving video. Be blessed for reaching out to your community. The people also seem to genuinely love you. Thank you for reaching out and for sharing this with the world. #bvistrong
My home ❤️😭
Small stone houses can solve these problems. I know it's expensive for that part of the world, but can't someone powerful collect some money. Get stones/bricks and build proper houses.
It's scary to see what nature can do. Wishing luck to everyone out there as it will take time to recover from such a disaster. Nice Documentary
@Sambranson #helphopehurricanes Thanks for sharing this moving, yet uplifting, video.  However, the American in the video said the island of Antigua was “bad”.  It is NOT.  Tourism in the Caribbean is more important than ever (accuracy is important for other's livelihoods).  Aid-tourism is a viable concept which I’ve already started work on, but needs support!   (Btw, I hope those children evacuated without mothers didn’t get transported straight into subsequent mess in PR).  Thanks again.
Many thanks for this Sam. Tears! Spent a lot of time in the BVI now barely recognize it. Thanks for helping those warm wonderful people. Have a friend in Tortola and she was wiped out then just after getting out of her place got bit by a pit bull! Please do a follow-up on this in a few months so we can keep abreast of their survival and progress.
Thank you Sam for this and to show us this part of the world, those destiny and those situations. It's touching to see those communities and humanity. Thanks.
you're good people you branson's. good luck to you.
Seeing Nick tearing up like that was brutal.  The people of the BVIs are resilient, but they have a long, long road ahead of them.  I hope help is pouring in (as it needs to be).
You truly are Amazing Brother, God Bless you and your Family. #OneLove🙌🙌
British Virgin Islands has the hart to rebuild better than before. A truly shocking insight into the devastation.\nIf this was to happen in my street, it would soon get very violent and selfish.
Thank you for this. Amazing community. Shared!!!
This had to be filmed didn’t, to show everyone the sheer state and spread the message . No. Everyone knows that people live in awful conditions and when you seem to be doing this to look like a ‘hero’ is appalling
Oh my goodness!  I knew it was bad but not this bad.  Thank you so much Sam for sharing this and giving an insight into how devastating the situation is.  God Bless you for your efforts to help these people.
This is just amazing
Is this guy related to Richard Branson?
One thing that bugs me.... at this age, why weren't these people evacuated BEFORE the storm hit? o.O
These people care about one thing, Living.\nMeanwhile, arrogant Americans in the USA fighting over everything from skin color to kneeling to a slave song (National Anthem)\nPeople in the USA mind is fucked up. Most, not all
This area is my favorite place on Earth. I hate that these wonderful ppl are going through this. Thank you for telling the world their story. God bless you!
Thank you for this film Sam, heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time.
thanks so much  as this film makes it so real, I hope they get lots of help.
Good stuff Sam. Thankfully Antigua was spared and is trying to help our neighbors. All the best.
And you have people in the UK moan over a bit of rain, people take life for granted.
Great video Sam - love to all the guys in the BVI!
I was not aware of the totality of devastation to this area. It's tragic but the spirit of the people in the midst of such difficulty shows their strength. They are stronger than I might be... not complaining, but truthful in certain situations and grateful when they see someone there to help. Thank you!
Thanks for posting this Sam. People have no idea how destructive these storms can be. I've been through quite a few in Bermuda, but nothing like this. So far this year we have been very fortunate to stay out of the path. Right now we sit between two storms for the second time this season.
The spirit and attitude of the people of Virgin Gorda is truly amazing.
Sharing Sam. Wish I could be there to help and hug. <3
Thank you from Singapore! Is internet connectivity restored +Sambranson  ?
Thankyou for documenting this.Gives good insight on whats happening in BVI.Am grateful there hopeful and grateful to be alive.It will get better with time.
Thanks so much for supporting this beautiful people in  need , thanks a million Sam.
I'm so appreciate for your good works. Keep going Sam.
Keep up the positive work Sam! Proud of you taking care of other and yourself. Stay safe and continue to have high spirits! Help is on the way! If you need a Master Electrician I'm always around! Don't look back and continue to build for a better future!
Sad to see such devastation but amazing job Sam going in to help! The world needs more people like yourself! Keep safe and positive. Hard times can have an effect on the brain too so take care of each other and you! Heads high and help is coming soon!
Help's coming.  Great job keeping hope alive Sam.
Thank you for this video. My niece is in St John living it & volunteering. Pictures can't show what they're experiencing but this gives us an idea.  God Bless you!
For a greener,stronger and more positive Virgin Islands! Amazing people! Stay safe Caribbean!
Love this..Thanks for sharing your good work!
😥
<3
Bless you all 🌈🌞
❤️
How can I physically get involved and help in person, for an open amount of time, not a vacation? I am strong, multi-talented, and can do so many things, like help rebuild, with many carpentry skills, as well as cook, teach the children., an artist that can beautify the current environment they have.  Do you know of anyone who would be organizing volunteers?  Love to all on BVI.\nThank you for your honest and touching video.
Hi Sam. Great video. I’m devastated by what has happened. I want to know what I can do to help. My friends run sunchaser scuba and I was over there just in May / June. The pictures I’m seeing are horrifying and bring me to tears each time. 😢 how are the animals in the sanctuary on Necker doing and on VG?
David Irwin, Doubled D Charters shared your video out. I lived in St Maarten 10 years, visited VG. After watching hundreds of videos about islands destroyed, yours, reveals more realistic depth of Help, Hope, & Hurricanes, and Love bigger than any hurricane. Thank you. Love & respect.
Brilliant video, Sam Branson - Robin Pinfold and family  are having a fundraising in Cornwall, can we use this video?
What I don't understand is why there has been no preparation for this? For an island that regularly experiences hurricanes why are the buildings not being built with concrete and bricks? Why are the roofs not strapped? Why are the boats not pulled into dry docks? There is usually 10+ years between big hurricanes but it seems very little preparation if any has been done.
HELLO FRIENDS!!! hope u guys enjoy this deep dive into a different side of the ~mannequin challenge~ (jk it's nothing like that). hope u guys enjoy! would u wear any of this? xo, saf
We are all going to look like colorful sheep - Saf 2017
Try the clear thigh high boots!!!!
Its amazing how good she looked in everything.... legit every random clothing item fit her so well
Your one ensemble, which included the white circular shades (I think outfit #4), looks like a female granny version of WALDO on ACID!!!🤣😂
You should buy what ever ad pops up on youtube videos
The one from Urban Outfitters reminds me of Dua Lipa, I like it. Though, from behind looks weird xD. I liked the one from Hollister, it was the most normal one, but, those types of black sandals are a no no. The outfit from H&M was the worst, boring. And the black thing didn't help at all, looks horrible XD
I NEED to know where the floral booties from the Francesca's outfit are from! Love them!!
All of the things she bought were cute separately
I loved this so much! Now I have the sudden urge to go shopping and up my fashion game. Can you do this for every season? This was such a fun video!
I would wear any outfit on a mannequin from Hollister anytime
You should a pregnancy belly for a week please !!!!!!!!!!!!🙏
Omg dress like the ppl from the just dance game for a week !
You sound and look like Robin from HIMYM. Like, it's a little creepy.
I love that Francesca’s outfit. I want that now! I actually am kinda digging that Top shop outfit on you
NO ONE'S MAKING YOU DANCE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the SNL reference. lol
Everything she wore is something that a lot of kpop stars wear..
Girl you were walking like you were in a fashion commercial wearing the furry-yellow-cuff denim jacket outfit! Yeeees!... And walk walk walk walk, spin, walk, turn, walk lol
Oooh do I see ocean city, md??
You always have the most creative video ideas!
Where are those boots from ???? (the super cute floral ones from the francescas outfit)
such a creative video idea! i love this <3
what these outfits said to me:\nfirst outfit: def lizzie mcguire / jennifer aniston\nsecond: actually kinda cute, super  90's  pastel grunge\nthird: wtf... lol looked like a an art student who thinks they are WACKY & Unique\nfourth: actually cute & adorable\nfifth: a model who takes themselves too seriously \nSixth: 90's trendy girl .... dislike it idk why lol\nseventh: 70's  chic
I want to be a youtuber so I have an excuse to buy new clothes
Please buy a mystery box!!!
I love the rainbow beanie from the Zara place
Yooo some of these outfits are super nice
How does she come up with these thing?
I love this video, you are amazing. I haven't seen you off buzz feed before but your bf (i hope he is) so cute xx ELMO ON EXTICY LOLZ
Is the person controlling the camera Mithzan o.0
I loved the second outfit !
I have a pair of silk pink pants I thrifted, a black and white flannel from two years ago and a brawler in my closet. I could do that one weird outfit. lol. nice video.
I love the first outfit minus the clutch
Im just here sitting in Germany, where we don’t even have forever 21 or / and topshop
*CLEAR BOOTS BITCH*\n\n_i love you_
Did someone search for the hollister jacket fuzzy thing ? I cant find it :(
This was so fun to watch! You should do another one of these videos when this winter's season trends come out.
You should of gone to Hot Topic
Have you heard of the LED face mask? Please try that for a month!
Its crazy. Sooo it looks like high fashion
the content is still buzzfeed
The top shop look, looked so good on Safiya!!! Her long legs definitely made those pants look so good !
Please check out Dangerfield! It's an Australian vintage/retro store and I'd be interested to hear your thoughts :)
Living for all of this original content omg. 🖤🖤🖤
Tyler looks great in the pink sweater
I love your videos
I love your boots in your Francesca's outfit! Where'd you get them?
you deserve every view you have. what an amazing, creative channel. You have the most amazing video ideas. xx
I really like the holister one. I would get the jacket in the cream color though not pink
I love how she's so creative with her video ideas. You tubers always make the same content but I'm always pleasantly surprised videos!!
Were the Zara bottoms comfy? They look super nice!
SAF HAS THE MOST ORIGINAL IDEAS I LOVE HER AND HER CONTENT SO MUCH AHHH
my favourites were the Zara and Topshop ones
I have an idea for a video, you should do one of Colourpop! If you go on the website there is a quiz called Lips Don't Lie and it asks you what colors you like to wear and your skin tone, once you take the quiz it will show you some lipsticks that they recommend. Hope you use this for an idea!
I am soo interested in how much money this cost you LOL. I feel like probably a whole lot!
She have amazing height and voice
I love watching your videos! I get to see all the places I used to hang out when I lived in LA and it's just so fun to recognize where you are!
The pants from Zara looks like literal rubber lol
The first hat suits you
Do you ever get self-conscious? I would never be able to do these challenges! Loved this vid <3
That was a lot of fun! Thank you for this video. The guy helping with the camera work is very cool and supportive. Love him!
i really love how you and your (assuming) boyfriend talks.. idk you both sound so well educated
Omg I've always wanted to do this 😂
I thought she was going to act like a mannequin in the store and scare people or something 😅
Make a wish video where you buy evening gowns/ wedding dresses!
Not BAD actually A Good outfit For the day
Safiya OMG you look SO good in all of the outfits!
topshop's mannequins looked like ghosts to me
You should do this every season to see what the trends are 😂
DO WEARING YOUTUBERS MERCH FOR A WEEK!!!!!
her voice sounds like winona’s rider’s!
please do a video wearing the balenciaga crocks! :'D
I think the holistic outfit was so cute on you😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💓💓💓💓💓
yuppie morticia
the guys at 5:40
OMG I NEED THOSE SILK PINK PANTS XGJCBKDJ
I feel fluffy. Oh so fluffy!
buy an ebay mystery box!!
Georgeous
DO THIS AGAIN!!!!
sANTA ANITA MALL?
More like theses!!!
0:33 MILA I SEE YOUUUUUUUUU
You must try ebay mistery boxes !
Omg u look so cute
You misspelled Like Shit
Saf and Tyler together are so damn cute together agh
God Saf, don't make your thumbanil so creepy.
Hollister - selling clothes through naked models
should have tried a UNIQLO  mannequin~~~
DO A TOPHATTER HAUL!!!!
love the hollister outfit
Turning heads at the crosswalk at 5:38
taylor swift belly xD xD xD xD
Those topshop pants look terrifying.
Outfit two is just 'Walmart chic'.
I love you!
0:32 camilizers
The 2nd outfit reminds me of Dua Lipa
TAYLOR SWIFT BELLY HAHAHHSJSHAHAJAJAJA IM SO USING THAT
You forgot the Kibble or Watt balance which has been proposed as a replacement for the international prototype kilogram...
minutephysics = 280 seconds.  yep, definitions are going to work out perfectly.
Come to the part of Earth with good cheese so we can show you our shiny lump of metal. That sounds like Douglas Adams wrote every word of it.
Problem is that we still need a language to communicate this in and even though electrons and protons and so on are all scientifically defined, they were defined by humans and are all still language made by humans. What we call protons may be called schwifty particles by them or maybe it hasn't been discovered yet
each message would take 4.3 years to arrive, and also how do you explain the concept of numbers to a species that probably doesn't use our numbers?\n\nHow do you explain language? Could you translate Put this here into a language nobody on earth speaks?
can you please make a Video about zero point vacuum energy? because I've heard of it somewhere and wanted to find out more about it, but there are no good videos about it explaining, what the idea behind this is. I don't want to have a 1 hour video, where you don't understand anything in the first place, just a quik minute physiks video to understand the concept. :)
Could you not just take a fraction of something both of you can see, like a star?
But the 1st thing they need to know is language. Without language we can't communicate with each other. \nAlso, it may be possible to do this the other way round. Maybe aliens try to explain how their units are and tell us the instructions to build the thing used to transport.
I think you're wrong on the '' how to tell them about mass'' part...\nIf you can transmit what a meter is you can transmit our understanding of space. If you have transmit space you can transmit our conception of the volume. \nIf you can tell them what is water you can tell them to put water in a tank of 1 cubic meter. \n1 cubic meter is the definition of 1000kg so they'll have to do a bit of conversion but it's Maths so it ok. \nCqfd.
What if they have a diffrent number system and they have named neutron proton and electron with something else like other names .
What if the aliens don't know English???
Instead, we can learn their language.
well we would probably need first to describe our base 10 numbers so they understans what 21234442438 is :)
Or easier: if we know how to build a wormhole (aka we can exceed the light speed limit however we wish)  we just teleport/jump to aliens and _show_ them all those things.
You speak too fast..... Slow down !
Completely confused at how we would send all of this/translate but very interesting
I highly doubt we have anything we could Tell Aliens. Its more like they would be teaching us.
the mass is a huge roadblock, but easily overcome like this derp
I dig the whole method of making units universal.  Do you think there's a way to make a one-way teleportation device?  Like a ship that can teleport itself to a distant galaxy, and then to another location?
How do we understand and them
Would it be our units or their units?
With the thumbnail I thought this was going to be all about the high concept behind Altered Carbon.
The way we science, we are the aliens
But what is a proton and neutron to them and us.
It would take so long to communicate
And, how do you tell that what is a proton, electron and neutron?
Hey henry, make a video that shows the easiest (and cheapest) ways for humans to fly.
You really crunched the numbers on this one. ;-)
Happy birthday, Henry! :)\n(Being 30 is no big deal, don't worry...)
You assume that they count in Base 10.....
1:25 Literally? Did you just literally misuse literally? Come on man.
sir please make a video on ferminon condensate and thankyou for your great cooperation sir my best wishes to you
Waste of time, knew it from the Title... IDK why i opened, Trust on channel may be... which is just gone.
Australia also has good cheese...and wine. It's not all the French ya know.
But first of all how do you teach them numbers.lol.this video makes no sense
I was always told that one mole is equal to the number of atoms of carbon-12 in 12 grams of carbon-12. With this relationship, wouldn't it already be possible to define the kilogram in terms of Carbon-12 atoms, which is the same idea as the silicon-28 sphere? Is there any benefit to choosing silicon-28 as opposed to the traditional carbon-12?
An EBE wouldn't contact us anytime soon were far too premitive...😏
According to Islam, Angels travel through wormholes.
Was good that vid. Gonna sub 👍✌️
Chock full of assumptions, a better assumption would be that the aliens would have to educate us on how to build a teleporter.\n\nAlso mass can be expressed in terms of energy and energy comes in a discrete, quantized form, such as photons.
I thought we were going to use a Watt balance?
#AskMinutePhysics Please please please... I want to understand how does ac current flows from the power station to my house... I mean that ac always reverses its polarity so what does it actually means... Does that mean if frequency is 50 Hz in India then in 1 sec 25 times ac current moves form station to my home and from my home to station... I want to understand the flow in a conducting wire which we practically see outside our house... It is easy to understand the reversal of polarity around and particular resistor in any theoretical diagram in a notebook but i can't imagine how it happens in wires outside our house...  How is ac current transmitted to our house with changing polarity at the same time...
If we are already making assumptions on communications, in this example why can't we describe mass in the way we do with equations? You know... the whole volume density shtick.
Why should the aliens know our number system in the first place?
The aliens might think we are a waste of their time if 9,192,631,770 oscillations was used as a measurement
Are you playing the bass line in your videos? I mean it's simple but sooooooooo amusing lol
NUMBERS ARE A FIGMENT OF THE HUMAN IMAGINATION
6.022... *10^23 is Avogadro's number, and like a dozen is 12 of whatever you count —eggs, papers, atoms, or asteroids —so is this number of anything a mole of that thing, particularly atoms or molecules. Once you agree on a mole, mass, density, and even pressure can be determined. You can do a lot of basic chemical and physical chemistry communication this way once a mole helps you determine weights and measures.
This ignores the fact that radio waves would take decades to reach Alpha Centari and light communication would takes years for each message and response. So it would be decades before we were able to understand each other and lifetimes before we even started building this teleporter
So, do we have solutions for matter vs antimatter?  Or Chirality?
Surprised he did not mention the time taken for signals to go back and forth.
But do they understand our language? Do they communicate the same as us? Do they understand our concept of time? There are so many more things to consider
1 kilogram is equal to the mass of 1 liter of water, and 1 liter is 0.001 cubic meters.  So if they know what water is, and they know what a meter is, they can figure out what a kilogram is.
Why is every science youtube channel so excited about this kg development? It's so pedestrian and semantic.
What the heck is a proton? And does oscillating mean twerking? I thought water was a fluid - what, we can go smaller? said in alien vernacular
Hi, your channel is pretty good and my students enjoy it. One question, in your proposed definition of mass you state that f of photon is of magnitude 10^48 Hz. Wouldn't that require a  period below the Planck time?  Can that work?
Sounds like a good plan to me. When do we get started? xD
We can't even say protons or electrons they don't understand what we mean😂
The part of the earth with good cheese\nGood thing that we don't have to worry about which language to use with aliens, Emy Adams figured that one out for us
So aliens know what decimal numbers are?
so this was how to talk with aliens
There is a specific weight of mass, measured in Carbon Atoms.
Antimatter is not allowed near the prototype Kg
Impossible, the Aliens know Pabllo Vittar. They refuse do some work together us.
but ..but what is a proton? *vsauce music kicks in*
Just learned how to fix my fridge, now its time to learn how to build a device to communicate with aliens. \nI love youtube.
Just a random thought, but couldn't we redefine our standard units and work backwards?\n\nSo the second is based on the frequency of light radiated when a Cs atom makes a specific transition, and a meter is based on the distance light travels.\n\nWhat if we define a joule as the amount of energy in 2.7551688167e18 photons of that same frequency of light? Then a newton is defined as the the amount of force you need to exert to give an object 1 Joule of kinetic energy after pushing it 1 meter. Then you can define the kilogram as the amount of mass you have if pushing with 1 newton provides 1 m/s^2 of acceleration.\n\nYou could also define the joule in terms of the amount of energy released when a certain number of (~6.7e9) are annihilated with anti-protons, and follow the same logic. Or once you have the definition of the joule you can base the kilogram on the amount of mass that would need to be annihilated to get ~1.8e10 J of energy (1 kg matter, 1 kg antimatter, or 1 total kg of matter and antimatter if the energy is ~9e9).\n\nNo need for a new physical standard for mass, unless I'm missing something.
Thats good n all but aliens dont even know what numbers are. They would have their own way of describing it
How will they understand our numbers? 😂 How will they know what are we talking about when we say protons and electrons? How will they do our math? They won't have a lot of similarities with us and first we gotta find aliens, finding a smart species is very improbable anyway
How are you sure that their scientific theory is the same, thus not having the concept of proton? \nAnd how do you communicate numbers?
1 minute ad on a 3 minute video. dont like that ratio.
Love the Zoolander quote at 0:27!
Aliens： what are numbers？ a finger is one？ no we wont have fingers sorry
So this is where I say we humans think we are at the pinnacle of intelligence. \n\nHow do we know our constructs of neutrons, protons and electrons i.e. concept of matter is the same as theirs? How do we begin scientific talk after we've established communication? There is literally no base for that, is there?
@minutephysics what if the aliens have a different number system, or don't even use numbers at all?
Why did you stop drawing??? Your drawings were awesome.......
Did no one catch that Zoolander reference at 0:26? xD
What is this a school for ants?
We could use Planck's constant or even use Carbon
You're assuming our alien friends paid attention in their high school math classes; a potentially catastrophic assumption
What if they named proton and neutrons and other subatomic particles differently from us (obviously)\nIt'll be atom but they may see atom as named something else, then how do we explain them that by 'atom' we mean atom (in their language)\n\n**Brainstorming started**
If we don't want immigrants in our countries then why would we wanna communicate with aliens and invite them to earth.
1st how do you say proton
I'm pretty sure we can already communicate pretty well with them, if we arrived at the point where both planets know that they want to build the device
I didn’t understand a word of that.
Who else shares a birthday with YouTube?
Yeah because they are going to understand English more than what a kilogram is...
To be fair, even now you could use one of the draft standards for the kg, they're pretty damn close to each other.
How do you explain them what a proton/neutron/electron is?
Ryan versus Dorkman was the first video I saw on You Tube
Assuming their number system is same as ours 😜
Jesus, dude... how are we gonna measure TEA to make a proper batch of CHAI?

f*ck track amazing song! and pls this video brings Beyocé not @Nytha sh*t\n http://apps.wcre8tive.com
GarageStudio don't try to talk about things you know anything about. Beyoncé had an original song with Alejandro Fernandez, in which she sung completely in Spanish, called Amor Gitano about 10 years ago. It is one of the biggest songs ever in the history of Spain's music charts. Plus, Beyonce did Irreplaceable & Beautiful Liar completely in Spanish. She had Shakira on the original Beautiful Liar. Beyoncé doesn't follow trends,  she sets them. J Balvin asked Beyoncé to be on this song & she did it because her daughter liked the song. Plus, Beyonce wanted to help out with hurricane disaster relief.

Is that actual corralline algae growing on the second frogfish? or is it a natural growth on the skin?
Why do you always get your right arm biten and stung
Roxy 7yr old. Name the big frog fish BIGGIE
The pirahnas don't discriminate they love fish all the same especially mutated ones
Coyote should do a video with those eels that make the super thick mucus (I can't remember their names, though).
Can you plz make more under water videos
Do you mean Freddy Fazbear from Five Nights at Freddy's?
I seriously hope one day they do something with a Moray Eel, it's one of my favorite sea creatures ^^\nOr maybe something with an iguana or dolphin ^^
Can we get more of the mighty tiabkcilc?
the should be a TV show
I know a lot about fish but I don't know if you can catch a stargazer
at curacao where I live we have a lot of turtles or fish
Who's watching this RIGHT NOW!?
Go to the island of oahu
love the music makes it more suspensefull
Kauai leanord
E
Looks like a chicken nugget
Nice fish
WOOOSH!!!
So cool
Fousey tube looks good in that hat.
8:08 dis niggu can giv some ppl blow jobs man
My name is Freddy 😂
Can you do a video on stonefish
This would be the winner of water hide and seek
please brave wilderness, come visit nepal and do a video on red pandas
You guys have always said you keep the epi pen in case coyote has a negative reaction. Has that ever happened? Has he ever had an allergic reaction to any poison or venom or anything? Also, is his name really coyote? That's like a name guaranteeing a future animal expert! XD who goes with you guys? Camera men and coyote but are there ever medics or family members or anything? I want to know more about him. You guys should do like a 20 questions video with the whole crew, where we can ask questions and stuff.
Is it just me or is coyote really cheesy
To be honest it looks poisones
I don’t know why I can touch and lift non-venomous snakes and venomous snakes safely ....but I can’t touch those scary creepy spiders I mean that spiders is nightmare but I’m brave for those snakes....don’t hate me pls I’m a kid
Ugly but cool
You are sooo brave that you are my fav YouTuber!!!!!!!!!
Go find a baby shark 🦈 you are going to get more subs and more viewers
Like for brave wilderness with wild kratts
Gross! 😨😱🐸and🐟🤔😞
Let it bit you
Your should have licked it
Awesome vlog
Don't touch my finpads senpai!
I challenge you to have aids
why don´t you talk about stonefish? I know they can kill you but i´m not asking you to get stung. Would be interesting to get some insight about them
The mum kind of ‘told’ her daughter  in the beginning if you look at her eyes
The mom sees the kid taking someones food. And smiles and does nothing ?! Great parenting. Letting a kid take something that isn't hers .
That is one savage child
We recruit you to the next spy of England
Maybe the mom should teach her some manners. But shes white and blonde so its ok
am i the only one who watches this video more then 10 times and still love it?
Who’s prince harry? Is he a famous person?
Two them are a credit  to the memory of the PRINCESS DIANA
Prince Harry was like: No, don't put your dirty hands on my popcorn! Here, let me give you 1 piece. That should be enough for your size you little snot. You're lucky this isnt the medieval time or i could've sentenced you to death along with your parents. \nIs this your child commoner?\n\nFather of the child: Yes your majesty. We are sorry for what she did, If there is anything we could do to exempt our daughter for punishment, we as parents will take responsibility for her action.\n\nPrince Harry: leave your wife, come with me after the event!
First your popcorn then your crown
Usually I like the Royal Family but this is just fucking stupid.
Harry seems like a great guy. But, most Europeans are awesome anyway. ❤️ that little girl😍 thank you 🇬🇧
Stupid ass mom thinks it's cute. Go but your baby some popcorn.
But the woman holding her didn’t even apologize and make her stop, really?
You can't get angry at a child doing that, but the mom. Maybe she should've  said something?? Like, do not steal.
How to get 16 mil views on YouTube
My only words: how can I relate to this so much
Hey everyone, I'm an aspiring Youtube rapper who wants to gain some support ♥️ it would be very much appreciated if you checked out my channel and left a comment ‼️ I rap about spreading love and positivity ✔️ thank you all
While the little girl is adorable and Harry's reaction is sweet, I'm still not finding how this is cute. Cool they're friends or whatever, but tell the child no, stop them, and teach them manners. You can tell the mom knew it was wrong by her expression. Discipline your child if they're doing bad things. Excusing bad behavior for the sake of cuteness..
I asked my daughter for a newspaper she replied that nobody reads the paper anymore and it's all on the internet she handed me her tablet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat fly didn't stand a chance
I’d hit it\n\nBitch that’s my food
Prince Harry is so kind and that baby girl is so cute. Thanks for showing the clip. :)
0:30 tf he doing with his mouth
I still love this moment... super cute...
soooo cute,so is the little girl
can I get dislikes on my new video?
Mom be like, i dont know this baby 😂
This made my unhappy day a happy day, Thanks!!!
toddler 15 years later: storytime: the day I stole Prince Harry's popcorn
That is so cute. What a good guy.
Who the fuck is harry
Cute how she's stealing from royal scum that has been responsible for murdering countless civilians and colonising and destroying nations for centuries...so cute!
Suscribanse a mi canal y me suscribo al de bosotros
D O N T  L E W D  T H E  L O L I
look at the mother’s face at the beginning she was like”Go get the popcorn”
This video is trending in South Africa
Remember when charlie.but my finger was trending and not this shit?
those are Harry's real friends not some random stranger
nice can I have some
off with her head!!
What a fucking gay channel
Haha the baby just steal over and over again 😂😂 and Harry dont even notice
OMG!! you dont put your dirty hand in someone elses food, i dont care if your prince or homeless.. you tell your child..thats a no no! wtf! you can tell he wasnt having it! but kept it cool.
He has a nephew​ and a niece so that probably not the first time that's happened. \n\nMy little cousins do this at Christmas dinner. The older kids are 21-16 and the youngest are 8-6. So we're talking about life or school and you just see little hands grabbing at your plate..... It's hilarious 😂
She should be charged with theft and being to cute.
If this was the 13th century... God bless their mercy on that young, dumb and innocent soul
He seems like a pretty chill for a inbred red head

Don't trust them with your children.
He looked more German than English.
This would've been a great teaching moment for the mother and learning moment for the daughter about manners. Saying no to your children when appropriate  is how you instill home training. She saw the little girl digging  her grubby germy fingers in someone's food and she said nothing. This is why kids today grow up not knowing how to say simple things like please and thank you smh. \n\nJust like the other day some man's child coughed in someone's face at the grocery store and the Dad didn't even tell the child to cover her mouth. So now it's okay for virus carrying humans to go around coughing on people. Smh
he's so chill?? he's probably my fav royal tbh
Dat dam toddler will look back on this when they are grown up and be like\n\n\n\n\n\n*Shit boiiii I stole his dammm popcornnnn*
You can tell prince harry has his mother’s heart ❤️ .... his mom was a very nice lady
I’d slap the kid don’t take my food without my permission

Happy to see the working-class fight against the -fascists- Royal Family and get their rightfully-deserved popcorn.\n\nThe Communist Flag Shall Rise.
Not surprised since the royals are all pediphile's.
The Queens family is so over rated lol.. but maybe that's because I'm Irish idk

Who else have a choice that keeps on changing after every month.i mean like seriously every month how much would he spend.
Your room is amazing
how about video of your current gundam collection? :D
my only complaint about the Macbook hub is that it wont fit/work if you have a case on it ... you have to remove the case to put the hub on
That scooter looks ugly as hell
Yay another video of things I will never be able to afford
We humans are nothing but material. There is nothing more to life but material products. We work for them until we die. Rinse and repeat
Everytime he says actually, take a drink and see if you can ACTUALLY make it to the end of this video?
Who the fuck is holding the camera

Man, that was a lot of time on that laptop😒
where does this guy gets the money for all this?
This guy has 1.4m subs. Has a paradise in name of house and buys literally everything tech related. Are you seriously saving some money? :P
Could you review them new Sony xb 30 and 40 speakers. You the only one i know who will do it right.

Did he break into someone's house 😎
You can tell that Im obsessed because i only clicked on this video is because i see  the Dolan twins in the thumbnail.😂😂😂
SAME PRINTER OMG\nOk I overreacted \nHappy though😂
High-key pissed because Shane didn't win the award
i can just imagine her going through her bag of peelies and being nostalgic about all the nail designs like oh this was that time that I put youtubers on my nails this was the time i put a cheeto with a poof of hair on top on my nails
Omg, I just saw what's her last name
you can just print marble nails and put it on your nails
Um the Dolan twins are real ??!? I though they were made up by that episode game my sister plays
I'm shook that Shane didn't win?! 😳😱💔
if i see the dolans i click
You should do aquarium nails?!? \nIf you haven't already
how is there not a awarded for the best nails
Please please please please do a polish mountain out of spray on nail polish
I stared at Menchie the entire time. He was definitely on drugs 😂
Ok so did anyone else freak out when they saw the dolan twins of was it just me
Its Dolan twins that is bae😍😍😍
I’m a simple girl \nI see The Dolan Twins \nI click fast
It’s all the holo tho with the glossy taco flow \nGot millions of nail polish, on my shelves, hope it don’t fall tho \nPassed all the nail competition and no one is better, \nMan I’m popping all these colours, got the brand new holo\nAnd I got a new taco and it came with some blue \nThis is queen Christine of the holo world.....
That beginning. I ship it now. Cristine x Jenna

Why did you make fun of our president with your nails when your prime minister is just as much an asshole? Everybody who runs the country can be an asshole and usually are. Obama was the biggest butthole we ever had. I want to put my cat George on my nails but I don't know if my manicurist will do it. I can't do my own Nails due to nerve damage.
I remember seeing Ethan and Greyson on your nails on Snapchat😂
I dare u to cut your nails
cristine is a bad  influence to menchie
There is a holographic highlighter
I miss her old videos, the ones with actual nail art tutorials. I’m not a hater, I just miss the old Christine!

Instructions not clear, ended up with a hole in my penis.
Difference between a life hack and a tutorial, no percise measurements.
call this a food hack in front of ramsay,i dare you...
Hell no, the skin of an apple is riddled with toxins.
So, why not just hollow out the first apples?

Next on davehax : how to make a gallium apple crumble fidget spinner life hack
For stewed apples, you don’t need to boil the apples.\n\nI just cut apple into quarters (using apple cutter which takes the core away)\nPut in MICROWAVE for around 5-8 mins (depending on amount of apples. 4 apples = around 8 mins.) \n\nWallah!
This man sounds like a robot
I try it home
Lol ain't nobody got time to bake apple!!
and they taste great
Apple grumble xD it rimes :3
dave hax has glasses on his face and a beard
You add to much sugar atleast i think so
I'm so sick of that bg music
I'm just here to respond to your title...no I would not eat an apple like that. Is it easier than holding an apple and biting it, no. So...no I would not eat an apple like that
This is so cool and I love fall! Thank you for showing us this
Yawn

Dude that's a pot!! Not pan my god...
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming! \nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus!\n\nHe LOVES you! Believe it! \n\nPlease do not believe the lies of the enemy. Jesus is NOT angry at you. He is waiting for you to call upon Him! \n\nHe will deliver you and save you from what is swiftly coming! Look around you in this world, every thing is becoming chaotic. Jesus warned us about these signs in Matthew 24. \n\nPlease, if you do not know The Lord, make Him Lord of your life TODAY. You may not get another chance to do so, and to die without The Lord Jesus is extremely DANGEROUS. \n\nThe Lord promised to never turn a person away when they come to Him, so come as you are and let Him make you new. \n\nShalom, friends!

Why waste the insides of the container apples?  Better to spoon the apple out and cook that instead? No?
Too many apples , also very sweet.

Lol, is this supposed to be the opposite of Demi Lovato's 'For You'?! XD
From my story and dont waste me time hard trap music to freak of the week and this shite song
No point calling them  sell outs  Music has been heading towards this sound for years especially for these type of artists it's development and it won't ever stop you gotta roll with what's hot, everyone fucks with this sound now, big up good tune 👌

Have a listen to the recent song on my channel, any support means loads.\n\nAlso big up Krept&Konan
Krept's verse is immaculate! I couldn't compose myself in my reaction 😅😅
I like this Krept and Konan more than the old, this is what we call versatile
AYEE KREPT IS THAT HOW YOU MAN ARE GOING ON NOW YH ?!!!! 😳🔌🎤🌊🌊🌊
Solid. But that melodic Popcaan ting he did on Come Closer remix. Triggered me!

Krept should've sat this one out
I'm here for Sophia Ray thats it.
This has Drake written all over it.
Not feeling this one
Song is wavey... But the guitar sound is so wack
The only reason I sat through this was the women tbh
I pressed the like button on the very first second I hear the first verse lol 👏👏🙌
Banger but they literally stole the drums and vibe from Drake - Controlla
This is the same guy who did Last night in LA 😂😂😂🤔
Did Krept and Konan make a deal with the mermaids?
Fav song of the year 🙌🏾 love krept sounding like kartel ❤️
My new single Two Sides To You is now available on Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, GooglePlay and more! \nHead over to my Facebook page to get the links! Facebook.com/SayshaWilliamsMusic. Xo

Nice song but not for me
Krept and konan livin life out of the hood respect for that but they're music has just been weak tbh
Rah these man need to allow the dead singing they sound like a b tec kc n jojo smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Look at how he has to give a lecturing speech to a bunch of grown men and women. It just goes to show you how childish racism is...you literally have to speak to a racist like a child.
Who the heck downvotes this?
Well said, Lt. General. Much respect!
SJW's are getting a hard-on for the first time in awhile, after seeing a dominant male in a position of authority giving a hint of altruism. The cuckhold grip has loosened just enough so that all the pent up Estrogen can finally be released, breathing a sigh of relief, knowing even the hardiest of Jarheads can fall for their crazy liberal propaganda's.
Great! We need more like this man.
for a 3 stars general to say this in 2017 that proves his  leadership has just failed. words wont fix this mess. should have enforced better codes and resolved this problem without  hanging his dirty laundry to the public. this general needs long term vacation. let all the world know and see his lack of sight and management and thus may underestimate all.   A low rankling officer in a police station would have handled this situation better. maybe that is why there is a position called a speaker to address and answer the public  professionally if requested by the higher leadership in-charge.
Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria.......you restored my HOPE today!
Owned the issue. Unambiguous response. Championed moral courage. Lt. Gen. Silveria is presidential!
Maybe you could give Trump a speech on how to treat people. My God what he's doing to the Puerto Ricans. Today, his visit was completely condenscending while accomplishing nothing except embarrassing them, us and himself.
Blah, blah, blah...All you do is talk-talk! Why is an element of divisiveness allowed to leave or stay on their own? As long as no action is taken against these haters--They will always victimize.
Wow! Thank you for your service and for standing up for the simple principle of respect for one another! People like you are why I love this Country!!! Best to you!\n\n#Class #Respect #Leadership
The irony in this guys words is just too much. His job is to kill people. For money. To kill foreign people in a foreign land. For money!!! My chest hurts
why doesn’t this man run for presidency ? He needs to. he would be a great leader
This is what real leadership looks like, not what that idiot in the white house is doing.
Excellent, thank you for speaking up.
Well done that man! Just when you think that there is no hope for the human race, when you think  that despair is the only possible response to the world around you, along comes   a man like this who makes you proud to be a human, makes you think that maybe just maybe there is hope. Such an eloquent and heart-felt speech.If it doesn't move you, you aren't fit to be called human.
JFK  wanted a black astronaght to be part of the original 7 of Project Mercury but there weren't any black test pilots
I don't understand the dislikes I just don't understand.
Wow, a grandstanding, blow-hard G.O., imagine that!  Hardly ever see those.  Especially ones that spout off before finding out the facts.
That was an excellent speech!!! Trump should get some training from this man.
Excuse, shit head, Iam 63yrs. old.. Where I went to school, we was tought  that to GET RESPECT you had to GIVE RESPECT!!! NOW, what I want to know is,, we're to RESPECT PEOPLE WHO DON'T RESPECT US.. IS THIS WHAT YOU'R SAYING..
...racism is spreads like fire from the bottom, from the single source of ignorance, from the single individual expressing his dissatisfaction, disgust and hate of things around him...then becomes a wildfire and consumes even the strongest of institutions...
Now that's what a military talk sounds like
This guy should be the fucking president of the united states
19,000 likes Versus 764 racists. Racists, there's your ratio.
Its a shame there aren't more Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria's in this world!
Let the witch hunt begin!
thanks again for your support in this case I thought you might want to get the boys together and have a good weekend and I'll be back in town tomorrow
Next United States president
know that just like the Jew lead blacks into wanting to gangbang sell drugs and kill' through paying some big money to shuck and juvie' like NWA 2pac chef keef JayZ and many others' who chose to lead there people into the dark' for a life of riches' based on lies and destruction of there own people'..yup he would know that the honest pro whites are exposing the mass control the Jew has in media Hollywood and collage university's .. and he would know that the Jews are using the blacks to try to choke out the white mans truth because he is trying to wake everyone up to the false reality' that  is being drilled into your mind-all day everyday..
Well said sir. Racism and intolerance have no place in the modern world.
Heroes like this. Heroes like this are the real reason I wake up in the morning, the real reason I can sleep at night. The ideas they have, the love they bring. \n\nI have a good idea:\n\nWith all the horrible people spreading hatred out there, threatening to nuke us, our allies and with people on our side threatening to nuke people we don't like, we need to spread the idea of love and respect.

Say a joke\nThe United States has no racial discrimination~
They were Trump Supporters. I bet
Thank you for being human.
Why is it that some people in the comments are *more upset* about him condemning racism, than the actual act of racism, smdh 😒
The world need more leaders like Gen. Silveria...
I can't believe this has had only one million views. This man just virtually  declared himself running for office!
Those words shook me those words remind me of what the military felt like 10 years ago
trump is a grate president  yall just don't notice what he doing good cuse yall lesson to fox news and cnn they dont tell truth he bringing jobs to america he putting liberal in there place
JRLM you are a complete keyboard pussy because you refuse to use your real name nor a real photo of yourself. You and your words are without merit. LtGen Silveria's words are complete politically correct showboating which is destroying our military. Have you noticed, MORON, that the so-called racist words have not been published?
I do wish the so called President, the #45 would understand what this General speaks about....
Subscribe to my channel!\nReward: watch me give all racist 10 kicks up his ass!
Never was a patriot but after watching this, I feel proud to be an American.
ITS ONLY RACIST IF YOUR WHITE. FUCK THEM LIBTARDS.  I FUCKIN HATE THE RACE SHIT!!!!  I AM 75% CHEROKEE FUCK ALL LIBERALS AND AND WHITE GUILT. FUCK THE LEFT . I WANT ALL LEFTIST TO LEAVE MY FUCKIN LAND.
I'm not American but this guy makes me wanna be one ASAP. Fuck stupid ideologies.
Agree with what he said. All groups have good and bad people with good and bad qualities. No one is perfect, and I don't think anyone is 100% evil. My question thou is: Do they know exactly who did it, and why? Was it truly someone evil showing there views? Was it an idiot just doing a protest to be like all the others protester? Like he said, protest but no options to make things better. Was it someone just flame baiting to get things going? One final option, was it some one of the offended group doing it to themselves to make the issue blow up? This has happened in a few cases. Regardless, we do have to live with one another, and if we work together, we can make this a better world.
Diversity really has nothing to do with racism.  You could have a perfectly equal amount of all races represented and still have racism.
I knew I should've joined the AirForce.
My better idea, stop promoting garbage like Charlottesville and Ferguson.  \nHad people let the White Supremacists have their little rally in Charlottesville it would have been small, not on TV and quickly forgotten.  The problem was that the counter protesters honestly believe that the white supremacists don't have the right to free speech.  \nThe Ferguson protest was about a cop who justifiably killed a man for robbing a convenience store and then resisting arrest and trying to harm the cop.  \nCan we please just promote the truth....can the leaders in the military, like Lt. Gen Jay Silveria, please just promote the truth.\nRacism in the US is lower than anywhere else in the world and the more we keep beating this drum of racism the more people are going to resent each other AND THAT CREATES MORE RACISM!!!  For the love of God, PLEASE, stop this insanity.\nNigger is a horrible word, it is a dehumanizing word, much like the words that the military tells our soldiers to use when we go to war with another country.  Chinks, Japs, Krauts, Ruskies, Commies, camel jockeys, all used to dehumanize the enemy so the soldiers can sleep at night after killing another human being.\nBTW, I refuse to say the n word instead of nigger.  I will never call someone a nigger, but I refuse to act like a 3 year old, cover my mouth and say the n word when speaking to adults.  If you are offended, I don't care.
We need a people like this man he represent how is this nation and how directed these democracy  Not like the clown we have in the White House.
Give this man a fourth star for that collar!
Okay Lt.Gen. Silveria, who was the culprit?  What was their racial identity?  WHY did they do it?  We understand there was a racial epitaph but that same word you can hear 30 times a minute on any rap radio station.  What if it were another black person who wrote it?  What if it were one of the occupants of the room looking to start a false narrative because they were on the verge of failing the prep school?  Lots of questions and you have not provided any answers.  I understand the Air Force is not really a branch of the military but sheesh, quit being a PC lump.  Get some facts before you express your outrage that may not be what you think it is.  Duh.
Thank you for posting such good videos! It is always great to see there's still good people out there!
is 3 star GN3 or is it GE ?
Are you prepared to join the ranks of the worlds created Air Force? Aim high, fly, fight, win
This will stay as one of the greatest speeches of the century.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Wonderful talk!  Admirable leadership that should be an example for all, particularly our current President!  I served two years in the military, and this makes me very proud.
OMG, he makes me feel so proud of our military and our people.
This is the type of Man is need it to be our President. Not the piece of shit of a so call president that we have now.
What's about 700+ dislike?
I can't watch the entire thing. I get too upset thinking how our own president can't do nor say such intelligent things like this... these smart leaders like this guy must get so upset thinking we have an idiot running our country and he's this guys boss
I’m confused, where are the offended black people, all I see is white people shaming other white people for being racist. Like wtf is going on, first pewdiepie says the n word and a bunch of white people are offended, like are white people secretly black?
Silveria for President!
wow!  love, love, love!!!!  awesome!!!!!
Excellent
fuck racism and racist people
Brilliant!
Thank you Lt Gen Jay Silveria!
GOOSEBUMPS
Get out!!!
What leadership looks like.
Well said Sir.\nWell said...
😭
Usausausausausausa
Yep
O
Bad ass mother fucker right there!!!!!!
Whooo fuckn raaaaa!
Trump's America
Machiavelli at its best.
Thats your answer https://youtu.be/jn2x_qs2V6A Idiots!!!!
From a US Army combat vet: well said Lt. Gen, cut fence and sort those racist bastards out....
Yeah when America was founded by whites it should be for whites this is why I'd never join a army that allows nigger and Muslims and faggots
Lt General Silveria: Don't you have something more important to do? Perhaps preparing the students to handle the next war?
You know what made Hitler dangerous?? He spoke the truth ....
Racists are insecure moronic imbeciles
And people wonder why they kneel
Propaganda to the max
racism is childish and children don't even do it
Its good to know people in those branches Care as a black man i fucking salute you Sargent
774 racists out of 20,000? Good job you guys, we're makin Youtube great again!
You'll never get this speech from 45 because divisiveness and intolerance were key to his success.
Most likely, it was a fake hate crime as usual. Wont hear anything after its exposed as a hoaxed as with previous incidents.
finally a white person speaks up
Rumor is the  black cadets wrote it on there own boards..... maybe the Airforce needs to investigate before  jumping on the racism band wagon !!!!
737 trump supporters watched this video.
seems pointless and democratic to those kids who said what they said obviously know everything hes talking about this guy record this ?? your fired
“The power of diversity, comes together and makes us that much more powerful.” – Diversity is what makes our military and our nation great – “If you can’t treat someone with dignity and respect, then get out.” \n\nI have never been prouder to be a veteran of the USAF. Amazing, bold, decisive.
Definitely ONE of the most OP characters in comics. He's an ideal. He is whatever you think makes something or someone so super.
He’s the original superhero. No, he’s not.
His greatest weakness is a rock so is he overpowered?
Superman is a mary sue
Yes and not too smart.
you can't say Superman is too over powered when people like The Sentry and Galactus exist
Yes just like how your love your Batman is disturbing
NO. HE ISN'T.
Hello everyone, do you have a personal relationship with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ? The Son of The One and Only Living God. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9
You people are some confused individuals. How is Superman overpowered, but the hulk isn't!?!??? Are you freaking kidding me?? No cap on hulk's strength, bs healing factor that he never had when he was first created, vaporized to a pile of bones and regenerated in a matter of moments, immune to almost every magic and mind control, can all of a sudden break worlds just by walking, and here's the most ridiculous thing that they've made up: can develop gills to breath underwater if he's drowning....GILLS?? And yes he's a Marvel character, but it's the same fanboys on here that complain about Superman that go and worship the hulk and throw him in every DC conversation. Superman isn't overpowered. If anything, he needs plenty of buffs.
A subjective question obviously, but honestly they all are when talking about fiction, especially comics.\n\nI say no, not just because he's my favorite superhero, but because the threats/challenges he faces match his powers. It's actually designed that way. He doesn't just fight bank robbers and guys with knives. He faces down galactic conquerors, armies, god-like beings, and cosmic phenomena. Of course he wins, but he's the hero. What character are you rooting for to lose?\n\nHonestly what I find less believable and more eye-rolling is (and disclaimer I do love this character too...but...) is the idea of a singular, simple, regular man being consistently able to stand up against any level of super-powered, galactic, or omnipotent threat. Batman is somehow always the winner no matter how impossible the odds because he's Batman or because he plans for everything. Really? That's more believable than Superman being able to beat Darkseid in a fist fight. A tough one by the way; it's never one punch and done. Superman still REGULARLY is shown to struggle against his threats. He may still win, but rarely just because he needed to land a single punch or something.\n\nThe simple answer is always that the writers of any given book, comic, movie, TV show, etc. will always, ALWAYS, write the stakes however high or extreme as they want. Thus raising the abilities or circumstances surrounding the heroes so that they can win. Examine any movie, show, book or whatever and see if you can't dissect it to find the way that it EASILY could have been more or less impossible for the hero. A good writer makes this happen without sacrificing too much to serve the plot, but that's still basically how it happens.
I guess superman was doing earth weightlifting in a air conditioned room ? That's why he didn't sweat ..... cuz I call that 5day earth lifting bs...
You should do a video on  the red x
Martain man Hunter is never shown using his full potential making him seem more realistic unlike super man who never seems to be shown struggling or overwhelmed even though man Hunter has equal strength and even more powers he is rarely shown using the full force or even all of his powers at once unlike super man who is presented as a good like hero
watching the latest VariantComics video, is my happy place.
The gifted episode 1 review please
Agree with every point you mentioned, which is always my response to anyone with a who would win Superman or.... For those reasons you just mentioned, he is a character who can never be compared in that way because he is meant TO never loose.. And for all those Sup haters about being boring, read America Alien.. Bet you will never see the character the same again .
I love Superman. He's my 2nd most favourite superhero of all time. After Batman, of course.
Where did you get that Superman shirt?  I got to get one.
Superman isn't meant to be relatable= Lazy writing
Thank you for this.
Please do a History of Lucifer episode.
Doesn't matter if he is overpowered, if he was underpowered he would still always survive and win at the end of the story since superhero movies are biased and the good guy always comes out on top in the end. Maybe if superheroes would die in movies he would be considered overpowered since he wouldn't die due to his power but that's not the case so it doesn't matter if he is overpowered however awesome video :)
Why hasnt anyone asked for the History of Arris Quinones yet? :P
Human kind? Superman is far from human
Personally I like my characters more human. Characters like Batman, Spider-man, Flash, or Daredevil is because I enjoy relatable   characters. I can relate to the high school troubles of Peter Parker and understand the Flash's dilemma of not being fast enough. I get what Superman stands for and that's great but it's just not always as interesting. (to me at least)
I dont like how random his powers are.
I draw hope and inspiration from Superman :)
U should do a history on super boy prime
for me superman is the poison of justice league, is to overpo....
he is but his arrogant use with that power makes up for it.
No, no he is not.
If the main point of a hero is to encourage hope and optimism,  that hero needs flaws, limits, and obstacles. Heros that represent tenacity, hope, resilience, and perseverance must be more human in quality like Batman, Spider Man,  for example. Superman, for me, doesn't fit this bill. A hero needs to sacrifice something and at this point in comics, superman can give it all and then give it all again (which he has). Can a guy like that really sacrifice anything?
Seen the title no doubt yes
Is the sky blue, do bears shit in the woods? we have another question to add to the list.
He is supposed to fight dr. manhattan and in his current state he is too under powered
recent overuse of the word super has made the term Superman seem VERY SHIT.
Haha yes but that's why he is the boss!
The flash is more overpowered than him
yeeeeeeeas he is OP AS FUCK. FUCK SUPERMAN. BATMAN AND DOCTOR FATE CANON.
The answer is fuck yes
No, cause his penis  is small.
cant be that OP if he lost to batman whos powerless......js
If justice League didn't have superman they would still have another op charecter Captain atom or Shazam or Martian Manhunter.
They dont call him super for nothing faggot
THIS IS NOT A VIDEO GAME. There is no overpowered. THIS IS NOT A GAME YOU CAN NERF
Can you be truly overpower if you have a weakness?? He has all these powers but all I have to do is have a piece of Kryptonite in my pocket and I could kick his ass all day!!! IJS lol
I'm just here to read comments 🕵
So you never answered the question....
Really supergirl is stronger the superman
Mon-el is way more overpowered. The treatment for his lead poisoning allows him to have his powers under a red sun, he has all the same abilities as superman, plus he's had a green lantern ring.
well he wouldnt be very super if he wasnt
Which Superman are we talking about here? if you look at all versions of Superman, there are more overpowered versions like Cosmic Armor, Superman One Million, Superboy Prime, Superman Prime, Pre-Crisis Superman, Kal Kent, etc. They de-powered him then sometimes they create another version that is more powerful than the previous one. It's like the  writers can't make up their minds.
Rick from rick and morty can kill him
Would it be possible to make a History of Alex Mercer?
Definetly not, since he can get spanked by allot of people. Heck, Batman with prep can spank him. The same with Luther, plus almost everyone in his rouges gallery is pretty tough.
Lol no, Popeye would beat his ass like a small child
Is the sky blue?
Pffftt, if you guys think regular Superman is overpowered you need to get glasses. Go check out Superman Prime or One Punch Man if you want overpowered.
My man Goku can take him out
So you needed a 5 and a half minute video to explain if the most OP comic book character ever is OP?
Donald Trump is America's President now.  😝
Please do a more in depth teen titans video
The real question is How does Wonder Woman manage to use all that toilet paper in one sitting?
No, but Saitama is.
Bruce Timm reduced his power and still told the best Superman stories ever. It's lazy boring writers that make him OP because they don't want to think and let Superman plow through his problems instead of find real ways to fix them. So yes, he is overpowered, it doesn't take much effort of talent to draw a man lifting a planet.
he's not as Overpowered as one punch man XD
I thought saitama san is overpowered.
Subscribe to my channel at jayanti Demps-Howell and watch my first video
If you're going to name a character super man, he has to be overpowered
That's the point. It's the story of a god trying to live among man. Not a generic anime character trying to fight everyone just for fun. If he was a bad character than he wouldn't have lasted 80 years.
Who carries isn't that point to be overpowered to win people this Days saying everything is to overpowered like that really gets me pissed off
Who else hates when doing somthing about superhero’s but don’t know nothing about the superhero’s then you just want to roast them like when a person watches Wonder Woman the movie then your in the movies then person always like wow I didn’t know that a scream when did this happen  am I only like this is every superhero fan like this also
Oh Yea he's way to overpowered but the solar powered S-Man is not with out his flaws. He can be easily killed 😲 by a green rock, magic, psychic attacks or mine possession or getting really sick by alien gas or poison, being beaten to death by someone just as powerful as him like Doomsday or Darkseid or a 5th Dimensional Being that can do anything, also being under a red sun or taking our sun away then use via Batman weakness, a bullet thru the head! Why hasn't anyone blew his head off yet!? #Batmanshouldbedead!
😂 He just needs a lil liquor-Then he’ll come strollin in to Lois’s apartment drunk and be like, “Lois, girls are gonna have bigger eyes than yours, and, and, they’ll see through lead too.” He crashes and breaks her tv. He’s embarrassed and melts it with his laser eyes. “Oh crap, Lois, what, what happened to your tv? It’s melted?” She turns on her bedroom light, and he flies the eff out and away as fast as he can. 😂
Thor still kicks his ass
Is batman overrated? \nAns: 10000^e999% True
Great points!!!! #myecomics
Gold experience requiem *cough*
Yes
thank you!
Nerf Superman!
No, because Batman.
Yes. He is IMBA!
#26 on trending.
Just ask Batman.
Agent X?
Superoverpowered!!!
Yes
No
one word saitama
Yes
yes op as fuck
Having super farts is really overpowering :))))
yes
History of Superboy
Yes superman is to over powered.  When nothing can hurt you, it doesn't take courage to fight bad guys.  I have always looked at Superman as a bully.\nIt is more courageous to fight and overcome a problem when you are out matched or the under dog.\n\nThey need to put a cap on his power and make him use them more wisely.\n\nI am dredding to see the threat that will need Superman, Wonder Woman and Auqaman to stop.\n\nAs good as the Wonder Woman movie was, they just made another mistake.  They increased her power limit to that of a major God.  So since she could do something not even Zeus could do (kill the god of war), what chance do any human.  Have against her, now when she fights humans she will be just like Superman a bully that can't be hurt.
He destroyed a fucking solar system with a sneeze. YEAH HE'S OVERPOWERED!?!?!
His a russian collaborator based on Liberals.
Dislike. I don't need to hear your political opinions on a comic book video. Fuck you.
Funny shit 😁 but why the fuck would u cut the video just as shit was getting good?
What did he expect? What a fud
Man he is just getting mobbed by fans with their phones everywhere
Conor is playing around with something way deeper than fighting. He better hope the hooligans to come at him; they don't give one fuck.
Next time throw a big one on him he desrve it
Shitebag rangers fans as per waiting till he walks away to throw the drink FUCKING PUSSY
Why do all these people commenting I work for newspapers can I use this footage, it's fuckin shit all his doing is singing then the camera cuts just before we think his going to do something.
Thats what u get fucking wee mug
Hey guys, we just sent you an email - Please get back to us when you can. Thanks!
I wish he sang better lol
Rangers fan.. god damn.  Rangers fans are fucking retards
That's what u get ya wee cocky prick 😂🇬🇧
Hi mate, hope you're good. I work for The Sun, can we please use this video? We can credit you and link back to your page
Hiya, I work for the Trinity Mirror - would you be ok for us to publish this video with full credit to you? Cheers
Hi, could Express Newspapers use your video with full credit to yourself? Thanks!
Should have glassed the pape
Hi mate, is this your video? I work for SPORTbible and would love to post the video to our page.
What did conor do after that did he retaliate???????
My dog who I hand raised from  just a few weeks old (he was in bad shape then and needed to be kept warm and bottle fed) was diagnosed with congenital kidney disease 8 months ago when he was just 6 months old. It's really hard hearing you're going to lose what's essentially been your baby maybe before they even grow up. For now he's doing well, you'd never know he's sick other than him being a little skinny, but this video really helped me cope with it and not just avoid the topic. I think I do want to do a home euthanasia and to spend a little time with him. I never really had a moment with the animals I've had to put down before, fearing their lifeless bodies. This helped me realize it shouldn't be something I'm so afraid of.
I bawled watching this. She reminded me of my car tennant. She beautiful (the meow) in life and in death.
When my dog died I was really overly concerned about her going into the dirt and getting dirty. As weird as it sounds it was my grief making me feel irrationally about it. But I didn't want dirt on her or another animal to eat her so my dad made a coffin for her. We buried her in it with all of her favorite toys, her blankie, a few pics, and a letter I wrote her. She was buried under her favorite tree where she spent most of her time. The following spring, a bunch of red tulips came up right where she was buried. I didn't plant them and I have no idea where they came from. But every spring they come up. And I remember her and her friendship.
Thank you for posting this video.. Sept. 11, 2017 I lost my male Siamese, Thai after having him for 12 years. He was my first pet and my best friend. He just stopped eating one day, he passed in my arms a few day later.. Where he was comfortable, warm and calm. I held him and we talked about all of his great adventures and the new ones he would now have, how much he was loved and that it was okay. He took is last breath and it felt like I couldn't let out mine.  I also have a dog Siggy.  When Thai passed Siggy came into the room, said his goodbyes and grieved with me when Thai passed. They both remind me how lucky and loved I am. I am sorry for The Meow, may she rest in peace.
I watched this with my cat son. Made me cry. I will do this for him when he passes. We rescued him and I always feel like he has PTSD so I always knew I’d do home euthanasia if I had the option. He deserves it. I want his last memory to be happily purring with me instead of scared shitless listening to other animals in fear.
Awww she looked like a little vampurr with her little fangs sticking out. It made me hug my cat, Mister Meow Meowz and my kitten, Midnite. I know I'll have to say goodbye someday, hopefully in the next decade. Love to all meowz. This is my new favorite channel.
How do you stop being afraid of death
Thank you for this video. Today when I got home from work my mom gave me terrible news, my 2 month old kitten Elphaba had died. I live on a farm, and we've had countless cats, most times they just disappear and never come home and you just assume. But I feel like her death was more bitter to me, I had taken her inside so she could grow up in a safer environment, and so she wouldn't get killed off by various critters. Unfortunately she had found her way under a recliner to hide from my 5 year old sister, who loves cats but isn't the most gentle with them so I can understand why she fled; my sister, thinking little Elphie had gotten trapped, pulled the lever to raise the recliners feet, and crushed my little baby kitty. My mother said that it was an instant kill, and that she probably didn't feel a thing, she didn't even have time to meow in pain; for that I'm grateful she didn't suffer. I do not blame my sister, she is young and had no clue what she was doing, and this is probably just as rough on her as it is me. By the time I got home they had already disposed of Elphie's body, so I didn't even get a chance to hold her one last time. I hope in the future I'll have an opportunity to have a wake for any cats I may have. \n\nBut just watching this video has helped me a bit, and validated my feelings of loss when many others would say it was only a cat, get over it. Thank you, I love your channel and how helpful you are, may the Meow rest in peace.
Have you talked about dying with dignity yet? Those who are suffering a seek the good death for themselves before their issues take their biggest tolls. I’d love to hear your opinion.
Thanks for that. My cat is 10 now and though I hope she has plenty of years left I've been thinking about her inevitable death. Totally going to look into at home euthanasia. We had to rush our 12yo pit bull to the vet when he had a heart attack and it was a 20 minute drive, he was pretty much gone by the time we got there. Definitely wish it could have been done at home.
I had to put my kitten down a few months ago on the worse weekend of my life so far. I never had an animal that I was so close to besides my horse, I live on a farm so animals come and go here like no tomorrow, but I had to take her to the vet in town which is where I work now. I still can't think or talk about it without choking up or crying like I am typing this comment. I feel for you in this video so much. I know I'm a few years late but hey lol i'm new here.
My amazing15 year old cat named Angel has been diagnosed with lymphoma. I'm bawling my eyes out at how beautiful this video is. Thank you for putting this up.
Full on cried watching this. My kitty Ginger died in February 2014 and I still really miss her, especially as her two adopted brothers are starting to get very old. She died at home, and my mom took her to the animal shelter where she was cremated and had her ashes spread in the ocean. My 15-year-old and 13-year-old cats are both completely healthy (as was Ginger up until the last few days), but I will fully plan to have a home euthanasia for them when it's necessary. \n\nYour perspective on dying and death is very helpful for me, at least, since it seems like it frees up a lot of the bad feelings around death. The Meow's wake made me smile through my tears because it was so sweet. Thank you, Caitlin, for allowing us this little look into your private life. Thank you for sharing The Meow with us and giving us some closure and permission to feel no shame in mourning. I'll carry a little piece of her in my heart (figuratively, of course :D) that will make me feel better when I'm down.
I had 3 dogs pass away over the last 2 years. The first was of old age, the second was a tumor, and the third was a car accident. I wish I knew any of this was an option for the dogs I had grown up with. I miss them.
Meow.... beautiful video. Thanks for the education of what to do in a case like this.
I lost my siamese two years ago to lung cancer. We were told he had an asthma and found out about the cancer when another vet examined his x-ray pictures after he had passed away. He had his euthanasia appointment around 12 o'clock but he got a flu a night before and suffocated an hour before the appointment. I felt so horrible that I couldn't offer him a better death, I was petting him on the sofa that morning and all of the sudden he went to his carrying cage and despite my efforts to give him asthma medicine, he died there. I couldn't hold him, I wish I had at least pet him before we sent him to be cremated. His ashes are still on top of our bookshelf, I'm thinking of spreading him together with his brother once his time comes.
I organized a little wake for one of my cats so that my other cats could see that he was dead and wouldn't start looking for him everywhere.
Oh no. I have a female Siamese... I hope she stays healthy.
Mg cat of 18 years dies last month and we had a nice little ceremony on the backyard with the family. I miss her everyday. Love the video and I Love your channel! Subscribed!!!
Couldn't imagine how hard t was to make this video. Rip the meow
This made me cry. When I had to euthanize my 18 year old cat with Cancer, I chose to get her cremated at this really fancy place. While it was more expensive than the other options, they held a little wake there for her where she looked BEAUTIFUL. I will never forget how peaceful she looked, I recommend it.
This made me smile and howl in tears. Thank you for sharing xxx
God, idk. I think American people have such a strange spiritual attachment to death. This all seems so... over the top.  I hope when I die, people just move on with their lives. I don't care what happens to my corpse, at all. A necrophile can have it for all I care.
I know this is an older video, but thank you. I lost my wolfhound a year ago today in the same hospice circumstances, at home in my arms. Thank you for helping me know I'm not strange for spending the time with her at home that I did. I don't regret it and I'd do it again. I love your channel.
don't say it like it's weird. These are our family
I recently found your channel and have been binge-watching every night for the past few nights. I got to this one and immediately thought Oh no. because dealing with the death of pets has been a difficult and near-constant aspect of my life. This is because my family rescues, fosters, and adopts cats, and our house usually has anywhere between 5 to 16 cats at any given time. Right now, we have 12. (all spayed, neutered, healthy, and safe, by the way)\nHaving this many cats puts us in the position of having at least one cat from every stage of pet life possible at all times. We've got one cat now who's only 2 years old, and we just recently euthanized a cat that was nearly 20. Plus all the ages in between.\nAnyway I digress. My point is, I've always had to deal with a lot of pet death, and it's always there, coming towards our older kitties, or the ones unfortunate enough to wind up with cancer. Just last winter, my girl Poocat grew a mass on her liver, and it ultimately led to my needing to euthanize her. I chose to do this at home, even though all our other pets have been euthanized at the vet. She was just too weak and sick, and I didn't want her last moments to be spent afraid, in a loud, smelly, strange place. I wanted her to be comfortable and as happy as possible. To be honest... Yeah, the vet bill was kind of painful. But home euthanasia was such a better option, for her AND for me. She was in my arms until the end. She looked up at me one more time before her injections, and at that moment it was the most difficult to say goodbye, but so good to know that she was safe and comfortable, not looking to me because she was scared and stressed from a trip to the vet. \nIf I could, home euthanasia would be my choice for EVERY cat we have to let go of, because it makes the process of death... not better, but definitely easier to some degree. Everyone is more comfortable, the environment is one that's safe and familiar. You don't have to walk through a waiting room full of strangers while bawling your eyes out.\n\nI had thoughts on topic of a pet wake, as well, but I kind of rambled a lot here. But I think that, even with as many pet deaths as I've dealt with in my life, this video still gave me a lot of comfort and insight into how better to handle things, the next time I have to say goodbye.\nI'm here in bed with my sweet girl, Coco, thinking about cats I've lost, appreciating the cats I still have, and hoping that in the future I can remember this video and make the process of a pet's death a little easier all around. (But hopefully not any time soon)\n\np.s. the wake you held for the Meow looked very beautiful, and I cried a lot.
My childhood dog passed away in November last year. I held her head and as she went limp I let out a audible squeek. I'm crying even now after watching this. We took her to my grandpa's house and buried her in the woods. My first dog was buried there as well as my dad's childhood dogs. I made a grave marker for her and carved bronze leaves to attach to it.
I'm sitting here weeping but this is such a great video. Thank you.
This made me cry!! Omg I miss my fur babies!!
3 years and The Meow is still causing heart ache
i’m not crying and cradling my 40 pound dog, you are
my cat died last month. kitty headstones were pricy so i ordered her a memorial steak. I miss my little marshmellow so much. I'm still crying
This video was literally painful to watch even though you delivered it with such professionalism and humor. Any subject about a human corpse is fine and im like, nah, but animals..
I'm so sorry for your loss, but thank you so much for sharing this. My boy is getting up there in years and now I have some sort of idea of how I'll want to grieve and honour him. <3
I had to put down my Sharpei dog- she was always terrified of the vet. Especially when she had to get anything done to her feet. Unfortunately, the shots had to go into her ankles. Surprising though, she looked really peaceful when she went. The vet listen to her heart beat and informed us when she was gone. We spent the whole afternoon digging a deep grave for the girl. It was nice. I was only 7 and i guess thats when I learned what it meant to lose something. Random, but i think thats what prepared me for my best friends death back when I was 15.
Man I'm crying I get sick thinking about losing one of my cats I think I will die with them
So sorry i have a yorkie and he is my baby
My cat knew it was her time and so she went to the forest to die there. We never saw her again.
Her name was so epic. Rest In Peace little lady ❤️❤️❤️.
We had our beloved black cat Peepaw put to sleep after he experienced somewhat of a stroke in the early morning without our knowledge. I so wish we lived in a rural area so we could've buried my Tessie dog and Peepaw in our backyard, but alas we sent them to the city to be cremated. Thank you fo sharing your story.
I appreciate all of your videos so far but I really need to thank you for this one. I didn't even realize home euthanasia was an option. One of my cats is getting up there in years and I need to start thinking about these things, and he gets so anxious about everything to do with the vet, I'd hate for that to be his last experience.
I don't like cats very much but this made me tear up. Goodbye The Meow, though this is an older video. Also your channel and videos have changed my outlook on both life and death and I am actually no longer suicidal. My views on suicide have changed so much because of these videos that I'm actually much less apt to feel that way now. Thank you so much for that. This may possibly be my only life. This may be my only experience as an existing being. Do I really want to throw that chance away? Can I really not stand the pain or is it that I'm too existentially near sighted to see the interconnecting possibilities of my life? To see that it will eventually get better? This may sound off the wall but I currently have ants in my house. They don't bite me usually so I don't mind. Sometimes they crawl on me or I'll find them crawling along my bed post with a giant piece of food that looks way too large for them in their mouths. I try to help them, I try to steer them towards food, or away from danger, I try to keep them from getting crushed underneath me. But, often times they end up just getting frightened, dropping the food, and scurrying away. Even with my best attempts I've never been able to successfully help one of these ants. Cosmically speaking I am an ant. Who's to say there isn't some higher being that's just simply trying to help me, but like me with these ants, just can't? Even if there's nothing out there I am still a tiny little ant, trying my best to carry the weight of existence to it's final destination. I cannot see beyond my perceived reality, I cannot see what waits for me 10 years from now, and is that something I'm willing to give up, out of fear that living another day will hurt? No, it's not.\nTL;DR Don't kill yourself, it's not worth it, we're all just tiny ants.
My beautiful rat died while I was away. I came back to a horrible smell. I was crying, not because I was morning her death (it hadn't quite hit me properly yet) but the fact that she was kinda far gone (a full night and day) she wasn't the cute little nervous baby she once was any more. She was a corpse that looked in pain and scared. I was crying because I didn't get to spend her last moments with her and that I couldn't hold her for hours after she died. \nI will forever miss her and I plan on doing something with the bones in about 20 days when I'm sure she's had time to decompose properly so I can give her the proper send off she deserved. \nRest easy my beautiful Ducky.
this is nice and everything but that bit at the end where she yanks her cat up looks a bit harsh and the cat looks uncomfortable :/
I wish i had a chance to something so honorable for my best pet friend who is no longer with
I have a 16 year old cat names Meeka. It won't be long before she's gone and I'm greatful for this video. Now I know exactly what I want to do with her ♡
I wish I had known about all these memorial options that vets may offer when my kitty passed a few years ago. It would have been nice to have a lock of hair or a clay paw print. I was a mess at the time and not thinking clearly but I greatly regret not looking into it.
This was a roller coaster of emotions. Thank you for sharing!
I started the video unsure what to expect, then sad as your story of The Meow's condition reminded me of my own Siamese cat from childhood who unfortunately also had cancer, then laughing at the part about blow drying your dead cat at 2 in the morning, then crying at the end... this video was an emotional rollercoaster and it has helped put into perspective my options for when my own pets pass. Thank you, you are an amazing person.
I should not be sobbing because of this.
My Lil kitty Tia died in my arms and I cried like a little baby.
I'M CRYING SO HARD A KITTY DIED
did anyone else go and grab their cat
Crying in the club rn
R.I.P. Meow =(\nI don't know if you have seen the show American Pickers. It is a show about antique hunters. Frank Fritz in the show he loves cats. And when his cat (Arby) died . The funeral was at a real Human Funeral home. And it was so touching and happy at the same time. It was kinda like a New Orleans type Human funeral for a cat with people dancing load music playing. But my cat funerals are a lot more like in this video. (AND I CRIED HARD) But I wrap my cat in a cloth before burial. Not to preserve. But to help the cat body go into the earth and not be disturbed by other scrounging animals. I learned the hard way one time.
The bit talking about your emotions afterwards, unfortunately, made me laugh.\n\n'You are so warm, yet so limp and dead. Biology. Curious.'
I was  watching this  with my cat laying on the bed a few feet away from me and when I started to cry he got up, laid against my back and cuddled my head (with his paws hugging my neck). Cats are amazing.
Aww..I  wasn't planing on crying today..God dammit..fucking cats making me feel
cats make me so emotional. I was completely calm and then I saw that picture of you holding Meow and I started crying.
My lil kimi cat had cancer and was put to sleep also purring wrapped in a warm fleece...we had her cremated at a pet crematorium,when they sent her ashes back they had enclosed some of her fur which was a lovely touch.i miss her.
We did home euthanasia with our cat Benjamin who had cancer. He was happy on our bed while we held him. So glad our vet did this for us. He cried with us, and didn't charge us!
I remember when we had to put our dog of a few years down. It was a sudden health problem that was stopped too late. The meds weren't working that he was prescribed. My mom said it was okay for me to stay in the waiting room. It was sad. Just to see him starting to lose strength. He was cremated and now in a nice little wooden box with his name on it. I'm glad he's doing better now❤
Wow, I don't even know what I'm gonna do when my dogs die. This video made me think about it and it was very helpful
Death isn't an emergency- it's a permanent condition. You can't mess anything up. This gave me a lot of comfort, thank you <3 x
I put my Blu Blu down in my backyard, in the sun on a blanket with friends. I was devastated but it was the best choice, the vet let us have time with her after she was gone and then took her in a woven basket to be cremated. She brought her back in a sealed wooden box with her name on it. It was seriously the best thing I could have done and I never had to leave my house to take her to a vet or pick up her remains.
Totally beautiful. <3 We have two Ragdoll cats, and our oldest, blue bi-colour Magnus (nicknamed Noot-Noot), is actually a therapy cat for me as I have Crohn's disease (can imagine a coroner wouldn't be bored having to run what's left of my bowel :P ) and general anxiety disorder. I also hold a BSc in Human Anatomy (Hons), and I LOVE the way you present death, especially as demonstrated in this video with The Meow. Before we got the two Raggie boys, Magnus and Merlin, that we have now, I had another Ragdoll, inherited from a family friend, called Frankie. At age 15 she went into kidney failure after developing a dental infection, and during the remainder of her life (which included two trips to the after hours vet for pain relief and high fevers, and antibiotics) we had to refuse the options given to us by vets, such as removing her infected teeth, a portion of her gum tissue and possibly jaw, and even a form of chemotherapy (though I can't think of anything worse for kidney failure than pumping more junk into the body for the poor organs to try and deal with). My husband and I kept her with us for three months, with her sleeping on the bed with us, increasingly more so between us under the covers when she was sore and/or cold, before one Tuesday when she deteriorated suddenly, as happens with kidney failure in cats, and I immediately knew I couldn't put her through anymore, as this was the worse she'd been. Jumped in the car, phoning the vet down the road to get them to stay open for us as we brought her in and said goodbye. I held her as she drifted away, but I did feel very pressured by the vet to let go of her body, and let them take it away out of sight, so you can have the good memories now. Ideally I would have loved to have held her for longer than the half an hour we did (I was also doing what you did, alternating between sobbing, and also being stunned at how pliable and yet warm she was in death, surprised my husband didn't divorce me after that weirdness), and when the time comes for other two boys to pop their clogs - seriously, if anyone says Rainbow Bridge, I will punch, it's just a kind of unnatural, overly and unrealistic heaven-esque ideal - we'll be opting for home euthanasia, and probably having them at home with us for a day, a day or two, before cremation. Thank you so much for this video, and all the others you've made. <3
It feels strange to cry over a cat I have never met
I only cried a little bit until I starting think about my 4 cats. I can't imagine having to put them down... Also, was that Laganja?
why am i crying in the club rn?
This video has me sobbing hysterically :-( so sorry
i begged my parents to do everything at home but they refused and it still hurts me that i couldn't be with my dog
I think I'll have to do this with my chihuahua. Luckily I have 10+ years with her yet I never wanna lose her 🖤🖤🖤
Anyone else going to grab their cat now?
Awww...I get it. I cried for months when I buried my min pin. Watching your baby suffer is painful.  When they die, a part of you dies as well. My baby passed in my hands after her shots.
I don't know why I found your channel or why I started watching the content but I was listening to these in the background while I worked. Unfortunately, I am crying now thinking of my deceased dog. Unfortunately, I had her put down last year after 15 long year, enjoyable years of love and companionship. She was a fiery red Pomeranian and we went through a lot together. I knew she was getting old.. her hearing worsened.. she was pretty much blind, but she knew me and she stayed with me always. I found her on my floor one day with blood spots around her. I checked her over and still do not know where the blood came from, but I called my mom (who was away at the time) and was sobbing that I thought it was time and I felt bad trying to keep her alive any longer. I made the appointment with the vet for in a week's time. \n\nI tried so hard to get the days to go by slowly.. I even contemplated canceling the appointment out of sheer grief over the whole thing. I called my school at the time and told them I would not be coming in for a few days.. maybe a week. That Friday came.. the big day. I picked her up and swaddled her in a blanket.. got a taxi to the vet and went through the paperwork and process for a cremation. I actually started crying and shaking so much during the paperwork that most of it was unreadable.. they still accepted it.. I don't think they wanted to make me do it again. She was euthanized in the vet office, swaddled in a blanket I made for her when she was 5. \n\nI stayed with her the whole time. I watched the light disappear from her eyes and her body go lax. I kept telling her she was a good girl.. such a good girl and that I loved her. They asked me if I wanted to take the blanket with me.. it caused an anxiety attack. I told them I didn't want to disturb her.. i didn't want her to be cold... I wanted her to know she was safe and I was sorry for everything. For not taking her down sooner, for trying to believe she would get better. I walked home that day.. opting instead to be alone in my thoughts.. it rained on the way home. I sat there on the curb.. not bothering with an umbrella and I cried in the rain. I was so heartbroken from the experience.. I felt so alone despite having a younger dog. I felt like I had let her down and that the vet trip was preemptive. I didn't go back to school for a while and when I did I was nothing more than dead emotionally. \n\nIt has been a little over a year and I still miss her. Every year since.. I'm not sure when.. but every year we buy a tiny pumpkin for our pets. We bought 2.. one for our 3 cremated ones including my Pom and one for our current pet. It'll rot and petrify slowly, but part of me feels better knowing (now) that she didn't suffer. I'm not sure I would opt for a burial like you did or a home euthenization (ever) but I find comfort in knowing that the handlers of death understand that our pets are precious to us even in some do not agree. \n\nCrying on Oct 1st wasn't in my plans but thank you for everything. I know this video is old and you may never see this comment but thank you for this. Thank you for recognizing that death isn't always just a human event and that it can affect their animal companions.
I am so glad to see I was not the only one who burst into tears as I watched this video.
I had a beautiful siamese named Oscar who died of kidney failure. He passed while I was at work (12hrs factory)... He was sleeping stretched out when I left and was in the same position when I returned home and in rigamortise. I had no choice in positioning him curled up. It was nite time so I couldn't bury him right away. Luckily I had a deep freezer that I never used and put sweet Oscar in a box inside 2 ziploc bags and laid him inside. Side note: I was feeding him with a syringe for a few days before death and he had dried bits around his mouth. I cleaned him up before I but him in the freezer, also he had a crooked tail that laid literally in half and he could move the whole tail or just the tip. He never let me touch it while alive so I couldn't help myself and petted his tail while I was cleaning him up. Oscar laid in the freezer for two days until I could bury him. I'm glad you touched on the real things that may happen when your pet dies and I hope I served my kitty well in life and in death.
I was genuinely crying until you mentioned blow-drying your dead cat and then I lost it 😂
Luckily my dog, Charlie, has agreed to never die.
I will grieve my pets just as much as any person I love. \nI called over my kitties to hug them after watching this.\nMy oldest cat is showing signs of early aging and it eats at me when I let myself think about it.\n\nI know it's been a view years but I'm still sorry for your loss. But I'm also glad she got to die without stress. Any cat lover knows how upset cats get when they are stressed. You did the best thing you could do for her. <3
people thought i was twisted i took photos of my animals sat with them and saved a few feathers and my bunny fur i'm glad to see it's ok to deeply mouran a pet like you would a family member and yes rigger is very real 😳
About 3 weeks ago my cat Mae died and I'm still having a hard time getting over it she got sick and her liver started failing. I took her to the emergency room because I didn't know what was happening, and expensive bill and I didn't think she would die that morning and couldn't get to her in time but got to hold her dead body afterwards with one of my best friends there with me. I live in an apartment but my friends mom let me bury my baby in their backyard, they had to prepare the hole and so they told me to ask if they could keep the body till the next day, which they did. I wish however that I took her home and laid her out like you did, because they did not place her in a pretty position, I opened the box and was startled to see a zombie cat looking at me, it also made burying her a little awkward and I'm still really sad and watching this video did make me cry a little cause I miss her dearly, she was only a year and a half old and I had her since she was an itty bitty kitten. :/
So I feel weird bc when family or friends died I was eh . But when my pets have died I was a bawling nut job.
I cry whenever I hear/read stories about pets being euthanized. I am seventeen and have had my two older dogs since I was four. I have no idea how I'm going to get through their passing as I've never had to deal with something like that before. I'm scared :(
I began crying when you said she was purring when she died.
This made me cry
After losing his battle with kidney failure, my GusMonster was laid to rest under a very old walnut tree in a friend's yard. Though I didn't have a wake, I held him during the euthanasia, and after he was gone. He did get a natural burial.
Btw. I love your channel. It's very eye opening without being boring.
I wish I'd seen this video sooner! My cat died unexpectedly (he had a long-standing heart condition but he was doing pretty well around the time of his death) last month and we were so unprepared that we didn't really know what to do or how to process it. For any future (hopefully very distant future!) kitty deaths I shall be sure to take your lovely advice into account and spend more time really processing the situation instead of largely avoiding it which is what I ended up doing.
Animal death is the worst, I can handle a dead human with no emotion but when an animal dies, I'm ugly sobbing.
My cat was put down a couple years ago and my mom chose to have her cremated and to have the vet clinic keep them so they could scatter her ashes in a pet memorial but we have no clue were and it still angers me she did it ngl
I literally cried when you said she was purring when she died 😭😿
This was beautiful
Aww this is very sad
I'm literally crying.
Rip the meow
I'm actually crying
Meow had such beautiful eyes!
This was beautiful
...so sad,,,
¿Porque entrenan con público?
Todos estos paletos no suman ni dos neuronas
ERES GRANDE PIQUE
LAMENTABLES, VAYA AFICIONADOS DE MIERDA
Vaya subnormales
No se como han aguantado tanto Cataluña como Pique en España, hay que ser muy mala persona para chiflar a alguien que llora después de ver como golpean a su gente por vota, increíble. Y se creen de primer mundo que es lo peor. La vergüenza de Europa como titulo la BBC
vaya panda de orangutanes
Que vergüenza me dan algunos españoles
Putas espanoles kieren governar el mundo a precio de nada gratis hpts vividores
Españoles (no todos), me dan asco
Esquq vaya gente haceis hasta un video para los pitidos de piqué, envez de apoyarle...
Putos fachas de mierda hijos de Franco.
pinches simios castrosos, yo ya les hubiera mentado su madre
malagradecidos.
Animo pique no estas solo
Porqué pitais al mejor defensa que  teneis, vaya neardentales.
Ay si ay si... mi mamá dice jajajaja españoles son graciosos
Visca Cataluna , Macht aus Deutschland
vergüenza Vergüenza
Putos
Cabrones mal agradecidos que pena dan
Como dicen ustedes GILIPOLLAS!
Gente mediocre
Que grande Pique! Muchísimos huevos tenés.
Q gente tan analfabeta y estúpida!
Olé tus huevos Pique 👏👏👏
Que vergüenza de personas
vaya afición mas chaquetera somos hahaha
estaría aduriz partidendose la polla .
Malditos patriotas de mierda
Biba hezpaña!!
VAYA GENTUZA QUE TIENE QUE AGUANTAR PIQUE.
Tan sencillo como hacerle una peineta a todos. Putos.
Gracias independencia de Cataluña, porque contigo empezó todo Jajaja
Guuuaaaooo...y despues a los sudamericanos nos llaman tercer mundistas...
Este país esta lleno de gañanes, no se que educación le dieron sus padres de pequeños
Simplemente inaceptable... No lo merece después de dejarse todo por la selección española, en lugar de pitarlo deberían reconocer de una vez que siempre a estado a disposición de esta selección...!
Españoles nacionalistas... lo mas asqueroso que puede existir.
Da igual del equipo que seas Pique tiene que quedarse en la seleccion
Que se independicen y ya está! No sean antaños! Viva Mexico y su corrupicion jaja
Veo mal que se tome a Piqué como blanco para descargar el odio que el NAZIonalismo Catalán ha creado. He de reconocer que visto en muchas ocasiones a Piqúe sangrando y dejarse la vida por la selección. Por lo tanto tiene mi respeto. Y como ciudadano Español que hasta el día de hoy es, (le guste o no hoy es Español, mañana no se) es libre de pensar como quiera siempre que lo haga desde el respeto. \nPienso que hay otros responsables directos que si se merecen esos silbidos como Puigdemont, Rufian, Oriol Junqueras o Pablo Iglesias el mamporrero del NAZIonalismo. Y también se lo merece el mismo Rajoy y su penosa idea de enviar a la guardia civil a aporrear a la gente. Si el referéndum era ilegal.... ¿que mas da que voten? Nadie iba a dar credibilidad a un referéndum en el que votan 2 millones de habitantes y todos votan si....  No es creíble, no es valido, que hagan el paripé si quieren. Y después de dejarles votar, si declaran la independencia se aplica el 155 y se encarcela a los responsables por sedición y malversación. Ese era el Camino, y no el de aporrear a la gente y generar mas odio del que de por si hay.  El PP ha usado como primer recurso, el que debería ser el ultimo en utilizarse, la violencia. Y la violencia genera mas violencia que será respondida con mas violencia todavía, y como sigamos así vamos a acabar muy mal. Y me duele que acabemos a tiros entre hermanos, por que quiero a Cataluña como cualquier parte mas de mi pais, tengo apellido Catalán por lo que debo descender de alguno de ellos. Cataluña es parte de mi, y también lo es España y que no me la toquen. \nY ahora me llamáis facha si queréis, me la suda.
Estos son cuatro catetos, pero a todos los que dicen toda España es fascista por los porrazos de unos pocos policías o cuatro catetos gritando a Piqué yo les pregunto (sobre todo a los latinoamericanos) que harían si un estadio entero de una región de vuestro país pitara vuestro himno nacional. Les aplaudiríais?
A esta gente no les duele ser tan tontos?
-Pique cabrón España es tu nación\n-Pique vete a tu país\nMuy lógico todo\nSe tenía que ir, pero para dejar de soportar a esta panda de borregos. Mucho aguantas Piqué, eres un grande.
Una basura de gente
Que grande y profesional Pique \nEntrenar bajo las ordenes de tu tecnico a pesar de tantos insultos que profesionalismo señores
No se como hay q decirle q no le queremos
Después marca gol o  hace un buen partido y todos a aplaudirle como buenos hipócritas
Si yo hubiese estado tambien le pitaria.
Este personaje lleva años riéndose de españa y encima tenemos que aplaudirle?
Si eres independentista, por que quieres jugar con la seleccion española?
No soporto a piqué en general nunca  pero creo que le honra ir a la selección después de lo que ha pasado,  y los pitos no ayudan nada. Sólo incitan a más odio y más separación por las dos partes
El dia que Piqué se vaya...ya verán como lo hecharán de menos ya...y a llorar luego
Lárgate llorón no se que coño haces en la selección española...cabron
Pitar pitar, siempre habrá españoles como yo que quieran a pique en su equipo y se desmarquen de otros españoles como vosotros
Poco de ratas malagradecidas y irrespetuosas. Ya deciria tener una clase de jugador como Pique en mi seleccion, que importa lo que el quiera politicamente, esto es futbol!
Que pena con esa gente
Hablan de unidad y van a pitar y gritar a alguien que ha expresado su opinión de forma respetuosa. Que vergüenza de gente.
pique debe tener coherencia e irse de una seleccion que el mismo ha dicho no pertenecer
en vez de alentar a su selección van a silbar a los jugadores que vergüenza dan y se ven que están al pedo..
No se a quién quieren engañar, pitan a piqué porque es del Barca, así de simple..... (Madridistas)
odio Los españoles...creo que asi son todos aya! puros estupidos!
se va ir a Colombia... ya veran. :3 :V
Que vergüenza que El día después, un canal de Youtube que tiene muchos seguidores sé preste para esto, he disfrutado mucho de este canal a lo largo de sus años, pero esto realmente me parece una vergüenza... porque no mostrar al público de Cataluña que apoya la iniciativa?, Realmente aspectos sociales, políticos y sobre todo monetarios no deberían influir en un canal tan bueno como este, realmente que pena.
Que paso? No soy de españa
Pena con esa gente
Me parece lamentable que parte de un pueblo le grite e insulte a su propio compatriota, seguramente los mismos que gritaban eran los de casco con las letras en la espalda de POLICIA que golpeaban a la gente en Cataluña,  opresores.... nunca se sabe a quien tendrán delante, Dios quiera le toque tener en frente a sus propios hijos y esposas haber que hacen estos POLICIA.
Fuera de lo retrógradas y fascistas que son muchos españoles; ahora entiendo a Pepe cuando se fue a Besiktas y dijo que en España la gente es fría y no sabe alentar a los jugadores. Siempre con sus mismas cantaletas de niños de preescolar, su patético lolololo de mierda y cánticos idiotas que no calientan ni a sus madres. Son afición sin sangre ni huevos, espejo de la sociedad  retrasada que tienen ahora.
Todos los que apoyan a pique soys hipócritas como el porque no tenéis argumentos namas decís  malagradecidos.
Y cuando gane con la selección o defienda un tirazo que podría hacer perder a la selección no quiero que estén ahí diciendo Que bueno Piqué; y luego se preguntan por qué el odio hacia España.
Que mal españoles, supongo no todos piensas asi, seguro que gritaron algún gol
ridicules de gente, si catalunya quiere independizarse q le dejen q problema sera de ellos el problema
Que asco la gente tío
Que gente más patética
hijos de su puta madre malagradecidos de mierda, el Barcelona les dio un mundial y dos uefas, sin los jugadores del barça seguirían sin nada malditos muertos
Libertad de expression.  esa cosita que Franco les ha arrebatado.
Hay que ser una basura de persona para burlarse de las lagrimas de Pique por ver su pueblo ser golpeado
Qué mal agradecidos ni que España fuera el mejor país del mundo jajajaja
Se nota que son aficionados del Madrid. Los aficionados más hipócritas y mal agradecidos. Si pitan a su bicho no digamos a Pique.
y acá podemos ver lo infantil de algunos españoles..., esto solo se ve en españa.
Su campeonato mundial en gran parte fue a el nivel que mostraban jugadores como Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets y Puyol.. sin esos jugadores jamás hubiesen ganado aquel partido.
Pues que se ande a Cataluña y deje a España, y de igual forma que Barça y Espanyol se vayan a otra liga. ¿Quieren independencia? Pues que sea parejo y se haga todo bien.
Que asco en serio las ideologías en España, intolerantes por eso tienen el Gobierno que tienen por eso les va como les va.
Ninguno de los que el pita a pique sabe lo que es ansiar libertad.
Se parece a Argentina \n
Pena de País, una vergüenza europea.
vaya gente por eso el mundo esta como esta -.-
Puto país de mierda. Somos la puta verguenza del mundo, los más paletos, los más retrógrados y los más rancios.\nEspaña no merece un jugador como Piqué, ni lo merecerá jamás. A chuparla carcamales.
¿No tienen una mejor nota qué hacer? ¿Qué clase de porquería es ésta? Provocando odio no se llega a ningún lado.
USTEDES PRENSA ESPAÑOLA PROVOCAN ESTO! FELICES?
Seguro que Diego Costa, Marcos Senna o cualquier otro nacionalizado se sienten muy españoles, pensad un poco.
Pique vete ya no queremos a gente que no sienta a la selección y este por segundo plato. Si fuese lopetegui no me lo llevaba más pero le faltan cojones al seleccionador
La voluntad del pueblo
Qué raro que no se hayan puesto a cantar su otra canción de cabecera...el cara al sol. Esos serán los mismos que se ponían a pitar a la Marsellesa y demás himnos de los rivales...pero si pitaban el español se ponían a llorar. Menos mal, que afortunadamente, no reflejan a la mayoría de la afición española.
Que vergüenza, dan pena la verdad😒😒
Banco a piqué a muerte pero ya debería dejar la selección,  por su bien.
entiendo porqué los catalanes quieren separarse de esta escoria fascista
A este hombre lo que realmente no se le perdona es que se riera del Real Madrid. Está muy feo esconderlo detrás de una bandera.
Alguien me puede explicar cuál fue el motivo?
A mi no me parece bn que pique apoye un referendum ilegal pero es un jugadorazo que aporta mucho a la seleccion y que merece respeto
Thanks for upload!
love the signing guy!!
A Sign Language interpreter, how awesome, beautiful, smart & accessible. ty
I love the trending page on YouTube, because it ALWAYS has some good, quality, content.                   Seriously tho, why is this trending?
I didn't think Weed guy could be beat, then kiss my ass on white house steps came in and proved me wrong.
10/10 - Needle Drop

Is that Casey neistat in the thumbnail?
I just love these! Just like Summerjam 1 and 2 :D
Mark looks more like Milo with that wig on.
Thank you for the inspiration
wow this was actually awesome??? idk why i'm surprised
I thought that second girl said jake Paul
Now see, this is only tourists,  except for that woman saying Kiss my house on the white house steps.\n\nIf this was real NY, you'd see Italian people smoking weed and stuck up women making some smart ass comments towards you, and too many white kids trying to act black.
A song about card games -- slow jam
shout out to the girl who said J.Cole
Lady Liberty turns into dragon fly orange' (she emerges from out of her caccoon) and the Spider turns into a dragon(that breathes fire)
Why did that guy look so much like Alexander Ovechkin?
This summer jam is missing Paige.
Song about cats and dogs then a giant dogcat thing comes and eats everyone the end.\nidk

Trying to get through the last months of my PhD and the only thing I keep hearing (and, thus, want to write down) is...sleazly! Nice work, earworm!
Do more like this
New Yorker (tourists) help you write a song.
Thumbnail lady could pass off as casey neistats sister...
I'm gonna add Sleazly and  You can kiss my ass on the white house steps to my vocabulary
I thought the person on the thumbnail was Casey Neistat for some reason
Anyone else think the thumbnail looks like casey neistat
They're in Times Square... 0 chance any of these people are new yorkers
I love you guys you're so amazing tbh
Americans are wierd. And not funny at all!
An I terrible for thinking the lady in the thumbnail looked like Casey Neistat for a split second?
My friend is getting me a t-shirt with that train quote on it for my birthday so thanks evan and mark for giving my friends a way to blackmail me
Mark you need the MDNA eye mask http://www.mdnaskin.com/global/product07.html  \nOtherwise this video ( and the song ) is excellent. It is... upbeat, and inspiring, despite the whack lyrics ofc
Mark I will kiss your ass on the white house steps
Hey DICK HEADS, ya'll are in time square a major tourist district. Everyone there are NOT NEW YORKERS!!!!!!!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
When this song was actually weirdly inspiring in a totally non ironic way. Long time fan! Thanks Mark and Co
That was fun. Thank you
i support out new president
* takes deep breath * *s l e a s l y*
*i pour milk in my bowl and then my cereal*
Yeah let's look for real New Yorkers on Time Square....

Lmfaoo that lady coming out nowhere killed me!!!
Omaigoddd this is this this is stupidly awesome

Aren't you guys like 90 years old?  Why don't you retire and hire some fresh faces.  You're literally killing this channel with your antique views and jokes.
Love this! Some great crowd responses. Sloths are my spirit animal, so the chick who mentioned them is like a kindred sister! As always, amazing job!
can of tuna yeah
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE parody real songs
this is the actual hardest game of all time and if any of you say otherwise, you are lying.\n\nsee ya later bye guys press a like
Life was a really shitty game, the tuturial ended when you got to just level 18, you didnt even get to customize your character and all the other players were really toxic \ni rate only one star
That was so hard to watch
Do more like this!!!!
This must have been so tough to shoot!
I missed these kinds of videos.
Hey look mom they made a video game about me.

I would keep on dying of awkward silence.
Youtubers are actually amazing actors and don’t get enough credit
This game has sick graphics
This was the best game. Everybody plays it often 😂😄
Fucking casual! The rest of us our playing with only one life and zero retrys.
Promise me you’ll do food battle 2017 2018 and 2019
OMG this should be a real game!
As an edgy basic teen I totally relate
i want more real life the game episodes lol this is awesome
lack of like level max
was he playing in a god damn nintendo 64???
This is one hella creative idea
Pleeeeeeaaaase guys make a real game out of this, that would be awesome 😂
I wish Anthony that you were still a part of Smosh but you aren't and by doing that you've actually ruined two channels for me, yours of course and Smosh because now that you aren't a part of smosh anymore I don't wanna watch that but also at your channel Ian isn't with you so I don't wanna watch your videos too, well I can't-do anything about it , I wish I could.
3:15 to 3:44 was so deep

Guess what. No wonder the video is great. The director is Joseph Kahn, it's the same one from Blank Space TS.
You hear it: melody from NAIKED-Sexual
Now they gonna be a naruto.
Made my day 😊❤ Love it🎶🎵
that elephant won that race, he was on lap 90.
her hair is so glorious
When you don't know the words but like the sound
This song is lit...but Fire though
Wish sza was more prominent on this track
This song reminds me of my childhood :v
Are we too grown for change, are we too grown to mess around
I saw the talking deer and I said oh, ok this is normal now...
Please watch it nd review it https://youtu.be/VtBfSKafpYU
The video is dope af
I saw a different one on mtv?
How does this not have over 10 million views already?
Hate to be that guy, but Adam is an A-list puppet. Huge stars and artists like him, the big bosses behind everything use to subliminally show us what's going to happen to our worlds future. World domination, government and military taking over. It's even in almost all action movies nowadays. It even predicted the vegas shooting and I don't think it was a coincidence. Sorry but I had to. #staywoke nice song tho
this music video is so cute and creative. love it!
Swear I thought this was dreezy on this song💯💃💃🙌
0:45 Let me sh!t for you
Beginning of the song sounds exactly like Why Dont We's song something different
I LOVE THIS SONG!
1:27 when they thirsty for that booty
It won't surprise me if people decide that this is offensive because of the Las Vegas scene and what happened two days ago in Las Vegas
Yo I never thought about this Collabo..hummm I like it!!❤
i love this song so much
Two of my fav artists together. love this one!
This song and video is getting better each time I listen to it!!,😀😀😀😃😃
Very good song!!!I love maroon5!!!❤💗❤💗

Why do they consistently try to keep calling this Maroon 5? It's been just Adam Levine for quite a while now so and he's turned purely pop soo......
Great job Joseph Kahn
Ok, let me see....\nFirst douchebag Tammuz and Ishtar running like 2 idiots. She can go up the tree of life and reach heaven while, Tammuz is kicked out by Zeus, the bee hive that looks like the planet JUPITER. Uummm...Very clever.\nGod only likes her, he doesn't like him.I am saying this forever, but many refuse to accept the truth.\nThen many years later she returns to the underworld and douchebag Tammuz that was awaiting for her, starts to run after her...Pfffff...Nope, that bastard is still  missing and not running after anyone.\nThen she have a fuschia pink swimming suite.( I am starting to hate  the color fuschia, you know...)\nLater she appears with gloves written power. Again very clever, Sekhmet name means  the powerful one. Then she beats him on his own game, which is also correct.\nLater he gets so mad that he turns the table.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHA.  In your dreams!\nThen he is put to DEATH by the police forces. LOL, hilarious, but You cant kill who is already DEAD, you know???\nAnd yes, the bull will gladly shred him into pieces, if Ishtar do not put her hands on him first.\nOn the end, she is there HEALING him. Again, you guys are delusional.There is not coming healing, only judgement. You should have showed the guy floating over a lake of fire. That yes would be the correct description of his coming fate.\n\nAstraea
look I love this video but the song gets pretty annoying
adam maybe older but he's still handsome
💞
They predicted 2017 tragedies! Hurricanes at beginning & ending with Las Vegas shoot out ! 👀 #illuminati

This is not hate but I'm worried because she looks really thin in this video. I hope she's okay...
This is so beautiful 😥😥
This was so fucking beautiful, Dodie you are so fucking beautiful. You're songs have gotten me through so many hard time and are still helping me through the hard times. Thank you so much dodie. For giving me the courage and happiness I desperately needed.
HOW DID I ONLY SEE THIS NOW, I LOVE YOU
I am definitely not laying on my bed bawling like a baby... I don't know what you're talking about.
This made me cry :(( \nI'm so proud of her
Wow, I'm speechless. A beautiful video to match a beautiful song x
this is such a beautiful song WOW ;;;;uuu;;;;;\nbut what do all the hand and arm gestures mean?
2:06 Guys am I crazy or is that Stevie
i can't actually help myself but cry. this video is so relatable, especially at the end.
Perfect representation of how I feel. My heart goes out to those who are also struggling. I love you so much Dodie. 💛
This is beautiful. you portrayed everything so well.
Girl you are a 10/10
I'm not crying I'm crafting.\n \n*_Hard._*
I DROPPED A PCIKLE FOR THIS AND IM STILL LATE
i have no words
lets start a chain-\nI feel like a 6 out of 10
Your need to get more viewers this is great❤️
I love the colors! Beautiful ♥
This was so beautifully shot and you expressed it with such powerful emotions, that I could feel it through the screen.. sending my love to you Dodie and creating these films for yourself and others to relate to
i’m not crying you’re crying
Awe honey! You deserve to be happy ❤
This made me cry so hard, love u anyway dodie
beautiful beautiful beautiful! Enjoyed this so much. I interpreted it as a peek into what it's like dealing with anxiety/depression and you captured that beautifully whether you meant to or not! <3
And now I just want to give you a hug and tell you that everything will be OK.
I love how this video can be interpreted in so many ways. When I read the comments I see a lot of people saying that they think she is taking hits with the movements, that it's a physical representation of the anxiety and I can totally see that, but initially I interpreted the dancing in the way that she had an urge to dance or express herself but felt like she wasn't allowed to because I know that you don't want me here and because she felt like, as a plain girl, it's not her place to shine, which is something I often felt as a kid :) just thought I'd share that way of interpreting the dance since I hadn't seen it here before. (also I think it's really remarkable, because I was dancing to this song the day before the video came out and I was basically making the exact same dance moves as in the song!)
I started crying about two mins in, then began making weird groaning noises because I related so hard and didn't know what to do.\n\nThis song, as sad as it is, reflects a lot of people's lives. It opens the doorway for good by highlighting the bad.\n\nDODIE THANK YOU - 11/10
I don't get it
this. is. absolutely. amazing.
you're a beautiful person, dodie <3
I love this song so much but I don't understand what's wrong with their shoulders
I freaking love this song so much!!! When ever there are days when I feel low, I grab a pen and write a small 6/10 on my wrist. That way, I can unconsciously listen to the song in my mind to help me feel a little better. It's what gets me through the day :)
dis ash bootiful video but i didn't get the hand motions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsowwy
OMG HER VOICE IS SO AMAZING I'M SO FED, I am a bit confused tho, what is she doing with he hands and stuff, it's really cool😂  (edit) oooo wait a sec OMG that make so much sense, it just hit me
I am absolutely in love with this
dodies comment section is the most wholesome nice place for anyone with insecurities as everyone understands each other and dodie brought us all together x
It’s just hay fever!!
WHY TF IS THIS SO SADDDD
If she's a 6/10 im like 3 smh
Hey dodie I love u, but spilling drinks on customers and looking miserable ain't gonna make that dollar
First line of the song, and I was hooked
ya did it again didn't ya
your lyrics are just so beautiful and poetic. blew me away.
dodie where is the rest of the videos? I’m waiting
I give it a 6/10
Today I auditioned for my school musical, Mary Poppins. It was originally going to be something else but 2 weeks ago it was changed. I've always wanted to be in a school play, but I'd been too nervous to try out. This year I'd gotten it in my head that I was going to be in the school musical, it was my dream and I wasn't going to let my insecurities put it off any longer. So about a month ago I went up to my school's drama teacher and told her that while I can't really sing, I'd really like to get a minor role with minimal singing and she seemed happy to accommodate me. \n\nBut then the musical was switched to Mary Poppins, a movie I'd watched many many times as a child. Now I still thought I couldn't sing, but I really wanted to try so for two weeks I practiced Chim chim Cher-ee I didn't actually think I could land such a huge role as Bert, more realistically I wanted one of the chimney sweeps for Step in Time but I thought why not, I'll practice both and just choose one on the day of the audition. \n\nSo today was the day and I got it in my head that I would sing Chim chim Cher-ee. They called my name and I went into the classroom, away from the buzzing noise of my far more talented classmates. The drama teacher said she knew I didn't want to sing and to just read these lines as best I could. I wanted to say that I'd been practicing a song and I wanted to sing but with 3 teachers glaring at me I was too nervous so I just butchered the lines and left as fast as possible. The second I left, I regretted it. I wanted to sing, I wanted it so much so I decided I would just wait until everyone else had auditioned (so that I didn't interrupt) and go back in to ask if I could sing. And so I waited for about an hour, and at some point my mom had texted me asking how much longer would I be, but I didn't answer because I was worried she would think I was dumb for waiting around. Then my mom walks up to me in the hallway and start asking me why I didn't answer her text and how much longer would it be. I took her off to the side and explained what happened, but it took so long to explain by the time I was done auditions were over. So my mom goes straight into the room where they held auditions and tells the drama teacher but I really wanted to sing embarrassing the crap out of me. The teacher was so sweet about the misunderstanding and gave me a chance, but by this point I was so embarrassed and nervous that I was crying. I try to pull myself together as quickly as possible because I really wanted this. I started singing but because I just been crying I got choked up after the chorus and couldn't (I was really disappointed in myself because my favorite part of that song is the ending). The teachers were really supportive of me singing and had already cast me as a couple minor roles. \n\nI just feel so worthless and dumb because I couldn't to get the part of that song that I thought I was actually kind of good at. As soon as I got home I saw this video had been released, and I have never seen or heard a piece of art that so perfectly reflected how I was currently feeling. Even if the teachers weren't the ones to make me feel like I wasn't good enough, I I feel so dumb that I screwed up not once but twice and I just wish that someone could hear me sing for real.
this was amazing
I ADORE YOU.
so so lovely
This is beautiful.
Beautiful
OMG DODIE IM SOO FREAKING PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!! ITS SO BEAUTIFUL
BLESS JESUS FOR THIS
<3
I honestly wasn't expecting this to be super good, even though I love Dodie's content.\n\nBut man, I got serious goosebumps before the music even started. That movement, man. Wow.\nAnd it carried all the way through, that quality. What a complicated and fantastically controlled feeling you've given me. Wonderful job. Heavy stuff.
Not trying to rain on anyone's parade but I kind of just don't get this video... I found it quite overacted and the exposition of the protagonist was (imo) far too long in comparison to the about 20 seconds of Oh look, every beautiful girl in the world feels super insecure that I guess where the message of the video?
God I love this.  And I feel like everyone out in the world feels this at one point.  Your all beautiful 😘
No, I'm not hurt. You are. Shut up, these aren't tears either.
Dodie is so amazing and talented 💛💛💛💛
Holy wow this is so beautiful
I rate this song a 10/10.
I'm confused but intrigued
No this is too sad
This was so beautiful
It's okay. I didn't need my heart anyways
Omg. My favorite one by her.. somehow it just got even more beautiful
Damn Dodie...

Give it a like if you love Tanya!!xxx
Aww I love this video! Keen for a bath now. Also I just loooooooove Tanya's style !
Love your videos, they always make my day!! You're my fav!
I've been using the neutregena hydra boost moisturizer for the last year and I'm hooked. Almost done my 2nd jar (costco size). I have normal to dry skin and I find this actually plumps up and hydrates my skin. First ever moisturizer than actually made a difference for my skin! ☺️ Love it!
such a calming video to watch!
For anyone who sees this comment I would absolutely love if you could leave any thoughts on my cover of my Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion. Sorry for the self promo but I would love to have some advice!! Love u Tan xx
YAY notification squad!! :) Wow Ian mcshane is in american gods, he's one of my face actors lol!! I really want to try the neutrogena hydro boost I've heard it's really good :) yay love the zoella soap opera, mine has just run out so i'm using scooper dooper now :) x

THIS IS SO RELAXING! 😴😍
This is gonna sound so creepy but your feet are so nice
This was so relaxing and inspiring! Candles really set the mood and I love that you and Jim take time to yourselves at the end of the day. That's so important especially when you live with your S.O.
i spent a lot of money at sephora\ndescription says video is sponsored by Cotton\n\nlmao
Your hair made me want ramen 😩
Are you wearing contacts in this video your eyes look green maybe just me😍
All of the light colors and I still can't find mine.
i subscribed because i didn't want your hair to judge me \ni can't deal with that
who did you sell your soul to to get such nice teeth and can i get their number
Loved this tutorial. I am gonna check out some Milk make up.
Ummm, yeah, not a fan of the milk line. I totally understand this tutorial. Ummm no thanks👎
I just found your channel and I instantly subscribed oh my gosh, you’re absolutely gorgeous and I love how honest you are! \n\nMilk can come out with 500 pale shades but only a couple of dark shades? No thanks!! I’ll be taking my money somewhere else that will support all of us!
I think you put too much makeup on, for what there trying to advertise to their customers, I think that's why the foundation didnt dry mate. overall i'm loving the Christmas vibe im getting from the whole look. I gotta check out those lippies and highlighters
Lawd, that stuff was so greasy, you were sliding across my screen honey. Not here for the MILK
Yeah for the foundation the lighter shades are ridiculously more focused on than the darker shades it's almost comical. Especially bc it's already easier to match shades for light skinned people in the long run with concealer and contour.
4:45 wtf we white people need one called white and this gets me so mad to see we got 8 and black people get 4? Like that's not fair cuz black people a most likely to be mix with something so they should have more then us OK I'm done 😂
Makeup companies NEED TO WORK ON THEIR COLORSSS! like SERIOUSLY!! light skinned girls and dark skinned girls need to have equal representation!!!!
Milk you need some milk
I feel so bad for the people who don't know Jackie Aina <3 cuz they've missed a lot!! like literallyyy....u know wa I'm talking bout'
Maybe that's why they aren't talking about it *inserts Jackie's face* 😩😂😂😂😂
The reason Milk is 'less is more' and sheer is becuse it was originally a Korean brand
I feel like Milk makeup is meant for women that already have flawless, perfectly shaped brows, and sculptured faces.
Jackie hitting us with that utterly flawless skin♥️
SIMONEZIA U NEED SOME MILK !!! lmao i LOST my shit 😭😭😂😂😭😂
The beginning was so fun because my name is Jackie too and hearing her say my name all the time is funny lmao
I'm one of the dedicated ones :P
I feel like Milk Makeup is aimed for light skinned people with dry skin.
Love the Jackie song. You just can’t do that with the name Sue. Sue Sue Sue...Lol!
the only reason I'm interested in  MILK as a brand is bc AESTHETICS :(
I had to rewatch this because the screen shot icon thingy is COMEDY !!
$1,000! Giiirl! ...ok I can’t judge I’ve done worse 😳
Never had of MILK makeup before this and I'm here for it!! The packaging, the colours, the minimalist vibe of it. The only part I ain't here for it the price!!
ok but i just hope you know i spent $1,000 on milk was really weird out of context
She doesn`t know how to put on makeup.
I... can't believe I love the glossy eye
read the caption of the video and said “Jackie what the hell did you do?” 😂
YOOOO this is the funniest review ever!!! I'm rolling LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO. When you applied the bronzer smh.
But mom where is your top from?
Milk is something I've been wanting to play in... but I'm super not impressed. I might do the bronzer but only for lazy days. And you still look so mono- colored with concealer and bronzer... no bueno. You're gorge as always... just not a fan of the product.
you should make a video on how it lasts... love your review btw
This video is so fun 😂😩
Does anyone know what foundation brush that is 😭😭😭
So all in all, MILK Makeup is nothing I absolutely need and honestly after this review, nothing I want either lol.
Milk products aren't meant to be used for an Instagram like full face thing. Also, they will specialise in whatever skin tone they want.
That lip tho!!! I died it is so pretty screams fall winter any season loooove it
It would've been cooler if you spend 1,000 on actual milk.
Jackie says to click the next video but I already watched all of them! 👐👐
Do you keep all of the makeup you get?
The very name Milk makes me think of a light skin brand. I honestly heard the name, assumed it was some Korean brand, and didn't even consider that they might have any darker shades so I ignored it.
i don't like feeling judged so o subscribed .
That eye look is  amazing!!!!! <3
Hell yeah. Im a until the ender! Ha! Love you girl!
Oh god no girl.  That foundation just makes your skin look wet.  Not even oily just wet.  Granted I have spent 42 dollars (excuse me while I cry) on a foundation BUT my holy grail foundation, my it-does-not-get-any-better-than-this foundation is the Urban Decay All Nighter foundation.  It's full coverage, doesn't have an odd fragrance (my skin is really sensitive to any scent whatsoever so I HAVE to be picky), doesn't make my skin breakout, and doesn't have that odd cakey/clay like consistency compared to the other foundations I have tried.  I will keep buying it because it's so good for my skin.\n\nBut after seeing that ish?  Oh no gurl.
Great video, as usual.  FYI, Shea Moisture has started making their great contour powder again.  It's now called Illuminating Mineral Powder - Dusk.   I just ordered it from Shea Moisture's website. Yeah!
You are very real
Milk you need some milk  😂😂
girl im so glad i found you you're hilarious
I love that even though Jackie has over a million followers she still uploads an appropriate amount of videos. Some youtubers get to a certain amount of followers and post once a month
I sat here supposed to be getting ready for work but instead watched two of your videos 😂❤️❤️ your so honest xx
Where you from Jackie?
Thank you I  live for your reviews 😍😘
i literally just found your channel and i'm in love. i'm honestly asking why i didn't find you sooner.
I love you!😂❤️you are amazing and hilarious!
What brush does she use for the bronzer??
Btw you have a nice smile💕
I just discovered u and now I already love u
I’ve never laughed so much in any of ur videos 😂😂😂
I AM LIVING FOR THIS GLOSSY EYE!!!!!!
Another thing the product was literally running down her face
This is definitely for the minimalistic look
Lmaooooooooo I just died lmaooooooooo that's it no more milk for me for a wkl lollllll
Omg you are absolutely beautiful and funny I'm do glad I found you❤️
Girl, before you added powder, your under eyes looked so shiny and oily. I would never buy this brand’s foundation! The foundation range is LAUGHABLE. That bronzer stick would probably work on my skin but it’s all so greasy looking!
I'm kind of a lot 😂😂😂\nYes you are and I love ya for it!
“I’m not going to try to pronounce these” pronounces like 4 ingredients
MY NAME IS JACKIE. OMG IM CRYING. WE HAVE THE SAME NAME. I LOVE YOU SO SO SO SO MUCHHH. 💜💜
My hating ass keeps tryna be like “SHES BEING TOO PICKY” but then I’m like ... damn she bringing up some important shit
Damn, everyone has 1m now and days
You are a delightfully adorable human being
Finally a good real true honest and genuine review lmao! Hard to find that on YouTube
this look would be bombb at a fun holiday party
Does anyone not see that’s she’s fucking yellow??
Hi Jackie, came across your this vlog i love your personality and ive never heard of Milk products
The foundation is coming across as a little too yellow for you.
I literally love her so much 😭❤️
Miss the Bible verses 😔. God bless ✝️
Forgive me, Jackie, for I have sinned. I'm so ashamed....I've been watching you literally all year (yes just one year...I don't get on youtube much) and I haven't subscribed. I corrected my mistake but you let me know how must repent. Love you girl!!!
I use the mascara everyday for the past year and I’ve never had any flakes. Love it.
Thanks for sharing. Whew. The oily tendencies almost messed up your makeup, Jackie! But the final look is super cute. \n\nHmm, I may just try that blur stick. The chunky stick design for the concealer won't work for me at all, abeg. \n\nNaya\nIG: NayaRhythm
I clicked on this video and I said “ Her face says it all”😂
Randomly stumbled onto your channel and I am glad I did ! Awesome vids =]
BRONZER, BAKED, BRONZER, BAKED! LOL
Give me your lashes, JACKIE!!!!
Your natural lashes are everything 🙌🏾
Such an angel 💕
THROW THE WHOLE PRODUCTS AWAY. Gosh, they stay disrespecting us sis lmao
You are hilarious omg
I love her videosss
Do you REALLY think I want full coverage?? *smacks lips* Noooo, duhhh! 😂😂😂
Inlove

Why is this. In my suggestions
Just mere curiosity: who the hell can be that 198 people, who disliked these videos?!
Hey..Simon's Cat..Why are you allowing people to advertise porn on your channel? Little kids watch your cartoons and read the comments.
Priceless possession :D

Loll too funny!
Priceless possessions = testicles. HahahahahaHahaha
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe he just threw out all that good meat. Haven't seen the cat's reaction yet, but I don't blame the cat. Seriously, all that would be sandwiches for the next few days for me. x)
My long haired floof kitty is a shoulder kitty.\nUnfortunately, she's 10 pounds soaking wet with needle claws.\nBut she's a  love.\nEven if she makes it look like I'm wearing a weirdly lumpy all black fur collar.
I feel bad for this guy :(
I chuckled all the way through this!!! SO funny... my cat has pee'd in my flower pot while trying to dig it out before! 😂🌼\n~Mow~

How To Take Care Of Cats
1:51 see, this doesn't happen if your a girl. well, it doesnt hurt as much
So true, and so adorable, I love your channel :D
Also its hard to keep them with smaller pets because they will constantly try to eat the small pet.
my childhood cat clawed my mom in the butt once. He tried to jump from counter to counter. She was in the middle digging for pans under the sink. He realized he wasn't going to make it. My mom's butt was his landing spot, she ripped him off her, and threw him across the kitchen into the family room. I couldn't  stop laughing. Poor little guy. I made sure he was ok, and cuddled him.
I’ll fuckin tie ya to a bed post with ya ass cheeks spread out an shit an put a hanger on the fire an let it sit there for a while then take it out an stick in in ya asshole like sssssssssssssssss

Still waiting for Trips to the vet. Love your videos
Your Videos are the best!
So true, no wonder we love them...Does that mean we are crazy?
Lesson learned. Replace all table lamps with LED so they can't be used by cats to get a tan.
Go to my channels leslie Singh and Ghetto Mama Mukbang and check out my pets. Thanks Subscribe
I remeber this and still watch it
My mom said she watched this in college
This is a lot like Wallis and Grommet\n\n\n\n\nI love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have a cat and a dog. They are my family. Love them to bits
Yeah my cats have systematically destroyed chairs ..vases..carpets....but I still love them.
these make me miss my cat even more as she lives at my mum's
this is what makes these so funny cos it so true what they do mine are just as bad  but i wouldnt be without them i bet the dislikes are dog lovers and hate cats lol omfg i loved the bit were it pooped in the hole and blamed the gnome lol but if a cat sees a hole he will use it lol
As a gal with moderately long hair, need an episode with a cat accidentally pulling one's hair by stepping on it... Mine as of late has been doing this. She jumps up on the back of my chair and wants to lay down and purr away but inevitably she steps on my hair. Plus, she seems to never be able to make up her mind as to which side of the chair she wants to face either.
My cat is fat and fluffy like a cloud also it weighs 20 pounds...

Great stuff, but I wish you had broken them into separate videos.
*W A R N I N G*\n\n*Owning a cat may get you broke, countless trip to the hospital, get detention by teachers and adorabetes that may lead to death,make sure you treat them well and avoid getting into their wild side and stay alert.*\n\n*YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*\n\n(but srsly it's all worth it)
i read that as cats can be a real pain in the ass
Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\n\nRomans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, \nand shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the \ndead, thou shalt be saved.\n\nRomans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall \nbe saved.\n\nActs 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one \nof you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye \nshall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Imagine buying a new TV and your cat knocks it over. I had a cat once he bit me because he got hungry. I put him out never saw him again.
That exhale at the end was priceless
we are team that should be fighting for that 7-8 position and we strugling to get out of relegation zone
Didn't celebrate the goal? Because you don't like Sakho? If west ham are as shit as you say they are then who can blame him for wanting to leave. Fucking idiot.

I agree with Dom for once Bilic has to go
Dom always looks like he’s got a bit of shit under his nose.
Looks like the biggest problem at West Ham at the moment are the fans. Get behind the team and stop moaning.
That lads about 15 but he acts about 42 get a grip of yourself mate give yourself an aneurism before you turn 30
You blame sakhos shit attitude, but he’s going to have that for as long as the fans will give him their shit attitude
It’s the same every week with Dom win or lose you get doom and gloom dom
Why have Dom on here such a miserable c##t
I wouldnt mind giving Dom a go as manager if im honest
He is not a fan, who gives a fuck we are a team with 4pts from 6 games, would you rather we lost?
damn.. and i thought Real Madrid fans are suspect as fuck.
COYI. Love how this has made #33 on trending too lmao 😂
West ham must do a roaring trade at the burger van......
Massive sigh at the end said it all. There were some positives at the very end and hopefully we can start with those players in the next game.
Until West Ham spend the big money and get better players managed by a world class manager we'll be stuck on this hamster wheel forever.same old shit casual play but the goal gets the whole team out of jail.
Why so many Pikeys follow West Ham?
Spot on, don't like the man. His attitude is piss poor.
I agree. Can't feel as excited as usual after a win because Bilic is still there and I feel he cannot take us any further. We were awful again but same as usual Bilic had no clue how to set up the team. No style of play. We have about 5 players up top waiting for it to be launched forward and we are fucking around with it at the back. Bilic clearly doesn't have instruction or game plan for the team. We need someone who will actually set the team up with some discipline and structure.
More performance art from Dom. it's all an act.
Sakho did celebrate he took his shirt off lol! he went mad! why take your shirt off , he got a yellow card!
I hate Sakho's attitude but I love west ham so I celebrated the fuck out of the goal.\nDom is right about the win papering over the cracks though. We may have been better off in the long run getting the draw if it meant Slav got the boot because as it stands he is just going to continue with his awful tactics and we are going to struggle like we have for the last year and a half.
We have a decent aquad but billic dont know how to get the best out of them...thats was a piss poor performance...even antonio played shit and ive never seen him play crap
If Bilic did go who would West Ham get I mean no managers about who will take that job... And him saying Swansea not a good side and West Ham are behave both shit teams.....
When will people relise that the deal was in place for sakho to leave the club had arranged it but then decided to stab sakho in back as they couldnt sign another striker then decide to blame sakho
I'd try an Hope get Ancelloti in quick time
Dom is such a twat. It's 3 points well deserved as we dominated the game by creating more chances and shots than Swansea who are didn't have a clue. Stop being negative bilic in.
Bilic just won the game you muppet. So fucking negative every week
A goal scored by West Ham is a goal celebrated by me even if Harold shipman was playing upfront
I'm not being funny, we messed up big time early doors this season. But we're still only 3 points off 7th.\nUnless we can get Benitez or Ancelotti, what's the point of changing manager?\n\nSo let's back the team if not him until we get a better manager.
Andy Carroll goals per game ratio is 0.28 goals per game. How is he allowed to play ?
This video was missing a 'chin up' at the end of it Nicky haha Dom looks like we've just been relegated out the championship to Millwall
Met Nicky after the game today, brilliant lad, even got a picture with him 🙂
Well that was depressing, he has a point about Bilic though.
Mate ATM it doesn't matter how we get the 3 points as long as we do
Anyone else spot Ethan / bazinga from sidemen
Such a important win ffs , don't matter how they come when your struggling at the bottom, and I hear a lot of fans today at the match including this fat mug Dom saying he would rather us lose so Bilic goes ........ one word and that is CUNT
Bilic gotta go
Dom cracks me up haha
Diddums you Stratford Pikeys LOL.
He's a morbid cunt
Youre fucking kidding you lot are in a relegation battle and need all the 3 points you can get, Sahko fuxking saved you
down. fuck we all hope so you PICKEY SCUM....................................................
Win papers over the cracks bilic out we will not get top 10 with this man in charge
Spot on from Dom, as for not celebrating the goal thas just petty mate last minute goals are the cream of goal celebrations lol
I see hear what you saying Dom\nBut we all know if it was a cup final against with the  drinks flowing n Sakho scores 95th min  winner ...  You would be going mental 😂
Dom just shut the fuck up, call yourself a West Ham fan , always fucking moaning . We won the game don't need your negativity. It weren't pretty but we are struggling. Not cheering your team ffs Just go away
caravan scum.
Completely agree with Dom
Why so many ugly fat West Ham fans. Fat ugly bastards LOL. Vocabulary of the East End sewer rats. Feck this and Feck that and nothing Feck all else LOL. West Ham hop picking holidays are what these fat bastards need.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS #1 ON TRENDING EITHER OKAY I DIDN'T EVEN PAY ANYONE YET but subscribe so you know when to come give a big thumbs down cuz! Good luck watching this! lol thanks babes.

Hey Liza my name is Sam and I’m from Gilmer, Texas and being a fellow Texan I have to say u are funny and a true Texan girl at heart and I was hoping u could do more videos about stuff u did when u were here in  Texas or visit Texas in one of ur many future videos \nThanks for making me and my little sister laugh at all the crazy things u do and I hope to meet u one day
Did anyone notice what she was watching on TV at 0:12 ?

Sound so good
I don't see her enjoying herself singing this it just seems like she's focusing so hard on each note it almost feels like straining her voice when it's lower. But I could be wrong it's a good song not quite my taste but I'd just like it more if I felt some more life in it.
I really love those versions <3

This reminds me of second grade. There were class jobs for when we left the class like line leader, caboose, and door holder. I was the door holder and always the last one out
Does anyone else think that Anwar looks like Portugal Man
oh my gosh this video gave me anxiety for some reason but I still loved it lol
Things happen like this in THE TWILIGHT ZONE!!! *music*

Who asked that bitch if she had a boyfriend?

This exact thing happened to me when I was graduating 8th grade XD I held the door for my family and then everyone rushed in someone even thought that that was my job XD good times.
Where the fuck you get those ideas 💡
Do you work in agents of shild because yo see exacly like  honter
This always happens to me, mostly at church, people don't ask me to hold the door, but I just always feel like I should hold the door for people

i have a family lol
I miss Gary Thorne doing national broadcasts especially for ESPN/ABC's National Hockey Night.
Amazing
I'd have absolutely no problem if baseball was called like this ordinarily
0:30 number nazi? The anouncer in the stadium
Why are they doing the PA announcements?
Jones will whack that son of a gun to center field 😂😂😂
is this the same gray how dose hockey game's?
Not gonna lie. These players likely played great with the silence versus the loud crowd.
gary thorne is amazing
1:03 I think you can hear Gary's voice echo. That's amazing
Takes me back to my days of baseball practice as a little guy.
He whacks that son of a gun.... lol greatness there
Can we please get Gary Thorne in the World Series?
Jones  waked  that sun on a gun to centerfield because Greg Gibson the home-plate umpire motioned to both players
I don't see what so weird about this. This looks like any ordinary home game for the Tampa Bay Rays.
Jones will whack that son of a gun to center field. 😂
delivery lmao
I bet every ball that was hit sounded like an explosion. I love the sound of a wooden bat hitting the ball
I love how when he yells free baseball for everybody you can actually hear him on the field mics.
Well I guess the White Sox are used to playing with no fans...
I remember watching this game. I remember hearing about this game with the events outside and made a note to watch it. Very different feel but kind of cool. Even though I'm a Cubs fan, it was fun to watch.
If only the person calling the balls and strikes was Greg Gibson, the Home Plate Umpire.
The average attendance in Baltimore this season isn't much better than this game.
If only there were an argument between a manager and an ump.
They should do that more often. The sweet sound of a wood bat making great contact is like an angel singing
Jones will whack this son of a gun…
Hilarious, but also really eerie. Love the crack of the bat.
Hilarious, he's my favorite broadcaster.
wow this is actually awesome.  no more fans from now on please! lol
Green jacket within reach... Nice one! 
Im pretty sure the Free baseball for everyone echoed through the whole stadium lol
Yo lol this announcer is a comedian
man, i love Gary Thorne :)
If it was only the Cleveland Indians...
Worst commentators ever: Kirk Gibson, Joe Buck, George Blaha, Ken The Hawk Harrelson, Fred McLeod, Austin Carr, Marv Albert, Brent Musburger, and Mike Doc Emerick. Best commentators ever: Ken Daniels, Mickey Redmond, Mario Impemba, Rod Allen, Neil Funk, Stacey King, Gary Thorne, Bill Clement, Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth, Frank Beckmann, Jim Brandstattter, Dan Dierdorf, Chick Hearn, Joel Meyers, and Stu Lantz.
BRING HIM BACK TO HOCKEY!
I need to make an anmiation for this.
As a Sox fan, this is so funny.
Sounds like golf right?
One of the best voices in sports history. Along with Dave Strader, Ken Daniels, Mickey Redmond and Bob Cole. Easily top 5 listing right there.
I hope this makes professional athletes appreciate the fans that use their hard earned money to attend games.  It's not the same is it?
I wish all the games were like this all the time I hate going to a game where it's all crowded 
LOL!!!! Ha!!! Ha!!!! Good stuff. Sense a humor is a must in life.
He is the funniest
The Orioles are are undefeated in games played with no crowd a .1000 win record for that stat
Its like a game of professional golf
Would it be funny if they had the attendance up on the board like they usually do. Or the noise meter
He crushed that ball though...
Looks like the Marlins game. 
Some say that it's not ok to make light of a bad situation, but this was pretty amusing in my opinion
BEST BASEBALL GAME EVER
They have some rowdy fans, eh?
this sounds like golf
This should be an asmr video
Still more people than a Florida Panthers game
Gary Thorne has always been one of my favorites. He takes a game exactly as seriously as it needs to be taken. He used to kill playoff hockey, and he is great with baseball as well.\n\nThat said, this is all about the crack of the bat. This is what it sounds like when you crush one in practice. Chris Davis' foul ball sounds as good as Adam Jones cranking a double to deep center. Just a beautiful sound.
why is this not viral? classic.
LMFAO
I just noticed something, when Gary Thorne used FREE BASEBALL FOR EVERYBODY!, the 2nd base umpire looked towards the press box.
anyone know were i can watch the full game at.
could somebody tell me why Gary was the MLB 2K announcer,no hate by the way.
Love the real sound of a baseball game
This happens in European soccer all the time.
And the crowd goes wild! Oh...wait. 
cause of the riot happen on monday and it a punish for the people that cause a very huge riot now the riot is slowing down and getting better also the final report will be release on friday about gray and the washington post got there report that it was a self inflection wounds now the lesson has been learn and it a huge roits cause this that means they will miss there toys
The crowd seems quiet today\n😮😰😁😂😀😕😒😮😁😒😂
I guess you could say that the White Sox took the crowd out of it
With the lack of crowd noise, I think now is the perfect time to add a laugh track. :)
It was a weird game.  I think it might have been one of the fastest this year too.
This is hilarious! Love Gary!\n
Gary thorne is a beast
Might be the cleanest sound of a ball hitting a bat I've ever heard. Beautiful. 
Where can I watch this full game, cuz hearing a baseball getting hit by a wooden bat awesome 
I fell out laughing when I first heard this!!
If you listen closely, you can hear the echo when he says Free baseball for everybody!
Those Oriole fans look exactly like Marlin fans.
That was hilarious!
It sounds like it echoed in the stadium when he yelled, Free baseballs for everybody!
Sup pac man!
I certainly don't miss the fake clap sound effect or any of the other fan enhancement rubbish that you're barraged with to make baseball more appealing to the masses. \n\nCall me old, but you can give me a Wurlitzer organ and a plain old scoreboard, and put the other stuff away.
ASMR
A small funny bit, but this is history.  Love it!
Wow every ball hit is so loud!! You don't realize how loud of a crack a ball being hit makes when a stadium is full of people...
2 Questions:\n\n1 Did the Orioles Win that particular game?\n2 Are they going to the playoffs this year?
AWWWW I missed the Hong Kong kitchen!
Dear Bubz, I've been watching you since 2008 and you have made me smile on days when I didn't want to. You have me a reason to be passionate about what I love and now I want you to know that you are a lovely and wonderful person! You have a beautiful family! On top of that, your added weight isn't a problem at all! You've got two adorable children and a husband who loves you so much! You are really beautiful outside and in. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
Bubz........Don't put titles like that on you vlogz with a thumbnail of you apparently crying, please....YOU SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME!!!!!!!! xD
It's so nostalgic to see you filming in your old apartment in Hong Kong ♥️ I remember when you and Tim were newly weds living there! I love when you guys go to Hong Kong and vlog there, those are my favorite ones
Tim cleaning up after that experience is sign of true love and devotion.
Because life happens\nBecause *shit* happens... I'll see myself out. X'D
My Uncle's wife said i've gotten fatter when we visited HK few years ago - she said it in front of about 10-12 of us including her husband and son in a Dim Sum restaurant. I could see the blood drain from their face when she tried to shame me when all she did was embarrass herself. Fuck her. She could suck a fat one. As if it is her business what size or weight I am.
In granny language, gaining weight means you're much healthier than usual! My grandma yells at my mom for not giving my brother enough to eat because he's so stick like. In reality, he eats 4+ full bowls of rice every day. The food just goes straight through him or magically disappears...
Happened to me with bad food. It's always bad food. I was shivering too, sweating rivers, trying to not release. I made it to the restroom, almost didn't though. As I pulled my pants  after closing the door, I felt it come out. Thankfully I made it in time to the bowl.
This happen to me when I was 14....and I had to walk home from school -_-. I don't even know how I got home without anyone noticing
Can totally imagine how ayla will be able to control and wrap issac ard her little finger when she grows up. Haha. Issac is the sweetest older brother.
Because life happens you tell them girl thank you for keeping it real!
Dude the struggle of being asian is they are sooo forward. At first you're taken back almost and sooo close to being offended but at the same time you're like ehh💁🏻 that's just super normal and you can't do anything about it haha
My husband is biracial. The first time I met some of his older Chinese family, they started giving me dieting and exercise tips almost as soon as I introduced myself. I just sat there smiling like 😅\nMy hubby saved me though, by changing the subject haha
I also show my mom your vlogs, she smiles every time she sees the kids and kept laughing at your story of meeting tims grandma! Bubz grandmas nickname is grandma bubz so what is tims grandmas nickname? Grandma hubz?😃.
if you guys really rent the house, i just might go to HK to purposely rent there LOL
Girl you are beautiful, don't let the remarks about your weight get to you. Just focus on being healthy and happy.
Thank you Bubz for these “little doses of happiness.” Even when I’m in a dark place I can click your videos and immediately smile and laugh. So grateful to have been here through the years 💕☺️
I was drinking hot chocolate at 5:24 😐
I've been watching your beauty & vlog channels for years and something I've always been fascinated with is your beautiful skin!! please give me your skin!
Filipinos are super direct, as well... It's a blessing and a curse. You're beautiful, Bubz. <3
Is... is Ayla's head actually as big as Isaac's??
Not just a Chinese thing, its an Asian thing xD My aunt kept calling me fat when when it's time to eat she always gives me a large amount of rice and sides.
lindy. I did have period incidents which was awfully sad and bad. I understand you might have felt bad but it already happened you can't go back to past. It'll be alright. Take care.
Bubz you are such a cool mum... !
Wow I never realized how much I missed your hong kong apartment and stuff. It's so nostalgic xD
oh god i was eating my meal when i start hearing bubz talking about her 'accident' i had to stop eating LOL! my brain was just visualizing what happened >.< LOL!
Don't feel bad Bubz. I did it today when I sneezed. At least I was at home but, I had to throw away my favorite under wear. I knew you wouldn't like that because you used to hoard your underwear. lol So don't feel bad. Your hubby can get the car detailed. No worries.
Haha Cubans are direct too! The first thing they say is, Omg you're so fat! Or You're too skinny, you need to eat!
I wished the directness of Asian families were limited to directing comments to family members only. I cannot even try to count the amount of times I wanted to dig a hole and bury myself in the ground when my grandmother called my friends fat or not pretty. Thank you for sharing that with the world I makes me feel a little better that my grandmas not the only one who does it.
THE HONG KONG KITCHEN GIVES ME FEELS
Isaac is such a lovely boy
Bubz!! You guys seem so much happier in Hong Kong! I hope you guys are able to stay for a while! 💗
Awk tim is so sweet😩 get you a man like tim ;)
I guess you can call it a crappy situation XD Sorry I'll let myself out lol I'm sorry you had to go thru that  that's so embarrassing. Hope you feel better <3
Had a moment looking back of seeing baby Isaac having a bath , but quickly remembered it's really Alya instead 👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻
I'm sorry bubz but I choked with laughter. I can just imagine the scene. The car must've smelt real bad.... 🙂
It's okay,  we've all been there. I hope you feel better.
I love how bubz went from introducing make-up sponges to baby shower sponges hahaha
Bubz! Dont you worry about your weight! You are perfect the way you are! ♥️
Awww Bubz! \nThings happen! I also have pooped myself twice, which is super embarrassing! >.<
LOL it's not embarrassing but it is funny!\nWe all get sick, it happens.
I had one of those accidents in a mall once... it was terrible
my boyfriend broke up with me ( we were together for almost 4 years) and i'm so broken. thanks for the smile through my tears :,)
No shame bubz! It happened to me once when I had the stomach flu at a friends house, one of the worst days eveeeer!
Lmfao!!! Lindy good luck next time with the toilet 😂😂😂😂
hey! I’m a new youtuber Just released a new video on my channel - would love if anyone could check out and subscribe and I’ll do the same back! Xx
Relationship goals, crapping your pants and your s.o not giving a shit. What a cuties you all are! <3
That happened to me after having my son!!! Don't feel bad! I was mortified at first but now I laugh. It's can be a part of having a baby. Don't be embarrassed!! You'll laugh about it later.
Aww loved Isaac's shirt My mummy is MAGIC <3 <3 <3
Bubz, little question : where did you bought that cover (when you were breastfeeding Ayla in restaurant)? Thank you for answer in advance :)
What are those sponges called? I need to get them for my niece. She's chubby like Ayla. Haha
When a chinese granny say u get bigger, it's usually a compliment. My granny used to say that's weight u gain was fortune (褔氣）
Isaac is the sweetest! Asking you if you're not well 😭 what a sweetheart!
I kinda knew she was going to say sge pooed herself before I even watched the video. 😂😂
How you know you're an adult = When you accidentally poo yourself.\n\nSeriously, everyone does it. Don't worry Bubz.
YOU GOT SO BIG\nMe: but she's so thin....
Also, you may not be the same size you were but you look beautiful and healthy!
Doesnt matter, she's magic. According to Issac's shirt that is ;P
Girl you're perfectly fine!! Things happen all the time, this will be a hilarious story in a few months or years
The relief I felt when it wasn't something serious but at the same time the trauma I can't deal
Bubz there's no such thing as TMI on here we know nearly everything 😂
Just tell everybody that if you lose your baby weight too fast you re going to have suuuuper loose skin so you have to lose it slowly,plus you only gave birth two months ago so they should just let it go !
Its okay lindy xD you gave birth, I heard it weakens everything down below!\n\nAlso I wont tried to force a far to disgust my boyfriend and I sharted.. he just died of laughter
Those near misses seem to always happen to you in Hong Kong. It must be something you eat there that causes such an extreme reaction. Investigate and don't worry too much :*
It happens to the best of us. Haha i miss HK...
Issac is so cute. I died <3<3<3
This is why i love bubz😂 and its not just Chinese relatives even Indian relatives do that a lot.
I am so glad you are okay...I was in an accident once, wasn't even hurt, and I cried...
And people went off at Tim for not being willing to oil your perineum.... but this was true love!!! No longer can YouTube comments say he doesn't love you and isn't a great husband!!
so excited for this channel to reach 1 million <3
You're so real I love it 😂 x
i read isaac's shirt wrong :) i thought it said 'my mummy is chaotic' but it says 'my mummy is magic'
Your fine the way you are!! Your beautiful. Dont let others get you down
Does anyone know whether there is an issue with the weight of Ayla? She seems hugely puffy. Is that normal or was that addressed in a prior vlog?
17 KILOS?! THAT'S SO MUCH!! She should've be like 'that's so much weight....that you LOST' because it is!!
Awe, I was just in Hong Kong! But now I'm back in the US. Isaac is so cute so is Ayla 😊😊😊 I hope to meet you all someday!
wow get you a guy who would pick up your soiled underwear for you and still love you
oh man i had stomach flu while oregnant with twins and i felt so awful , i bent over to pick up my sons toy and i had a long tunic on and long story short it rained hot lava down on an innocent village of legos...and one smurf...thank god i was at home
Isaac Has Such Good Manners 😭😭❤️ You And Tim Are Doing An Amazing Job With Him
Asian people are just really into everyone being skinny, if your on a chubby side they think something is wrong with you, and that you're the ugliest person in the world...I gained 20lbs and my entire family never fail to remind me how fat I am and they will mention it whenever they get a chance and think it's ok that it's normal, mind you I'm 140lbs right now I'm not even that big, but it makes me feel horrible about my self that's why I sometimes avoid to see them...
😭😭😭 i can relate, girl. Unfortunately.
That baby is so big! I want to pinch her cheeks so badly!!!!!!
Isaac is so polite and the cutest child I have ever seen in my life. God bless your wonderful family bubz. I love you guys
No worries in 32 and pooped in my sleep luckily I was home
I once was at a theme park and went to the bathroom and then proceeded to walk around for 20 minutes with a seat cover Stu k in my pants lol it's okay girl embarrassing things happen all the time, it just makes a good story for later!
Don't worry, it happened to me... And my bf also, had a good laugh.
Korean culture is that direct too.
Isaac <3
Oh my gosh Isaac is so well mannered! So cute!
OMG, BUBZ!
Awwwe I miss that apartment
you meant Japanese bbq, right?
Awwwh :( it happens i guess! :( bless you jahahaha
I never laughed so much looool
Tim is so cute haha 😀😊
What bathtub do u use for Ayla bubz?
Bubz, I guess you could say shit happens.
The situation that happened in the car.. I think it’s normal hahaha. How do u control diarrhoea....... it’s maximised urgency. I can understand!! Hahaha
i hope i can pop up with you in Hong Kong before you go away :) \nLast time I saw you was few years ago <3
This is so cool!
What a cheap way to release a game full of bugs.
Wow. This is quite a brilliant idea for its time! But, this also has its downside; if I see no legitimate way to enter the level select other than crashing the game, then it would invite confusion and also cause damage to SEGA Genesis itself because of the hitting the cartridge solution.\n\nThis is in the past though, yet I can't help some poor souls who had their game / console broken xD
I read about this on the Cutting Room Floor. It's very fascinating stuff that makes me wonder why more games don't do stuff like this to handle errors.
Wow, you coded this game? You coded my childhood, man. Kudos!
for some reason I thought this said Spinball and I was like 'oh, it's like tilting a pinball machine!'
Dang. I watched this when you first uploaded but it sparked so many news stories on popular sites like mashable and ign
i found this out back when the game came out. i was playing it on my SEGA nomad when it happened. found out after that just tapping the back would do it. i never hit it tho.  \nbut this is cool that it is why it works. instead of just crashing.
I found out about this level select when I got pissed off...
This reminds me of something that was added to version 5.0 of Smash TV in arcades.\nWhen you start a game (as in, actually press start and begin playing) a flag is set in CMOS, which is then cleared when the game is either won or lost. If the game hangs for more than a few seconds, a watchdog timer resets the hardware. Since power isn't removed when a reset happens, CMOS and RAM are preserved.\nThe CMOS flag is still up while the reboot occurs as a result, which the bootcode sees and responds to by skipping all the self-testing. The game scans the ram (score, lives, # of players...) and takes you to a screen informing you that you found WARP #3.\nNote that this is the only time the game so much as mentions a level warp.

Yeah couple years ago when i got my first sega genisis from a flea market, it came with sonic 3D blast. I had 3 controllers and plugging them into player 1 slot it wouldnt operate correctly, the jumping worked but the D pad controls were funky (i dont remember exactly.) On 3D blast i slammed my console  (because when a console or TV is not working correctly and you're so frustrated what do you do?) And it took me to that stage select screen boy was i suprised XD.
I find all these details about SEGA QA processes very interesting. Please keep them coming! Thanks!
Hahaha, we still do shit like this today to get through TRCs on Playstation and Xbox. Funny that it's been going on since forever.
I had this happen once in a special stage. 10 seconds running through an empty track and just as I clicked something weird was going on, level select out of nowhere. Pretty funny in hindsight, since I know that part of the game wasn't even made by TT.
Can't beat a Sonic 3D Blast level? PUNCH IT!
I discovered this level select screen when I accidentally pulled my Genesis console off the shelf it was on.  I'm sure we all have stories about it.
So your lazy in the best possible way. Aint even mad, just genuinely impressed with your solution to deadlines. Also, the Saturn 3D Blast is also great and more people should check it out! DO IT NOW!
That's super crazy and I love the creativeness to it. Just Eh instead of an error it's now a cheat!
Wow, so this explains the level select.  I recall accidentally stumbling across this as a kid after attempting to turn the console off but didn't quite hit the power button down far enough, causing a bit of switch bounce, and the level select screen came up.\n\nAfter that, I was able to replicate this exactly, tapping the power button fast enough so as not to fully turn the console off and it would trigger the level select screen every time.
This was so interesting!
Wait, wait, wait. You tried to divide a number by zero?!\n\nAre you mad, man? You're going to get us all killed!
Watching this makes me proud to be a programmer :)
Disney games were among my first, so as a young kid I thought every 3-D (and pseudo-3D) game had the Traveler's Tale logo.\n\nAwesome video!   It would be cool to see one explaining the mysterious unused tracks on the Toy Story PC CD-ROM.  (At   least I think they're unused..  Pop that CD into a CD-Player and you'll hear some freaky wierd stuff)
Wait a second...you're Jon Burton! From Traveller's Tales! I've seen your name in end credits of games played years ago.\nAwesome! Every Traveller's Tales game I own I have enjoyed! Thanks for so many fun memories!
Wing Commander 1 did something similar, writing thank you for playing wing commander in the place of error message when exiting the game.
Wow!...\nI have a vivid memory of myself and a few friends all sitting around the TV playing 3D Blast back in the 90s. We were farther than we'd ever progressed in the game yet when my younger brother, who was probably around 3 yrs old at the time, walked in front of the TV and tripped over the Genesis. We all shouted noooo! in fear of losing all that progress until we noticed this secret menu had appeared on screen, at which point our fear and frustration turned into joy as we applauded my little bro for his accomplishment. From then on, whenever we played 3D Blast, we would tell my little bro to trip over the console again so we could access that secret menu.\n\nIn recent years I started to think that maybe this whole memory was actually a dream as I had never heard of others experiencing this. Thanks to this video, I now know it was indeed real and why it happened. \nThanks for sharing this info.
Is this one of the earliest examples of It's not a bug, it's a feature!? ;)
I found this out by accident when I was 5 and accidentally dropped the console and it booted into the level select mode, crazy to hear about this now.
But I can imagine that, at that time with no protected mode / no really safe OS, there aren't that many crashes that can be trapped, no? Divides by zero, sure, but things like integer overflows wouldn't be trapped since they aren't bugs by themselves. I can also imagine things like random jumps in code freezing immediately, what would the console do/know about that?\nPlus I can imagine things like character frozen in a specific state because of unpredicted user interaction, and all the broken but not crashed problems can't really be trapped either.
Ha, that's really cool.
That is some damn clever coding.
Speaking of Mickey Mania and crashes and stuff, maybe you could shed some light on something. I noticed the game is region locked, and the Japanese version will display a This game is only for a JP NTSC Mega Drive system or something like that. But if you region switch, it'll display Oh, the console has suddenly become a Japanese mega drive. Why did you (or one of your colleagues) decide to program this in, when the chances of actually encountering a region switching mega drive were (especially at the time) slim to impossible?
fun fact if your knuckles or wolverine punching it might break it
Incredible. I've learned something completely new.
holy shit i discovered this when i was 5 years old! got angry at one of the levels and punched my megadrive and bam! level select didn't even know others knew about this!
*Why does BREAKING Sonic 3D cause my game to break?*
it’s so rare to get to hear an explanation of something this specific from the actual person responsible for it 20 years later!! i love this video
Very cool to hear the explanation (And Source Code Snippets) Direct from the Developer
Hey, just discovered your channel and I LOVE it. You offer some really great insights for aspiring programmers. Keep making these awesome videos coming
Other developers have done the so called bug room ever since.
These videos are excellent; thanks for producing them!\n\n One bit of feedback I'd add, however, is that the music can sometimes make it difficult to understand the vocals.
My Genesis is so sensitive that just stomping on the ground hard enough or knocking into my desk will bring up this screen
This is something I found with my friends accidentally as a child playing Sonic 3D, and now I know why. Thank you for making this video. Brought back some nostalgia!
It happened to me when we were childs. We started to fight to see who could play the game. So while we were fighting one of us pulled the pad out  enough to pull the console out too from the place it was standing.\nThe crash was strong enough that the screen went black... we stopped fighting, we thought that it was the end for the mega drive... But suddenly the bonus screen appeared, and the song started to play. We were so scared at the moment that we screamed a little. But man, how satisfiying to know not only that the console weren't broke, but selecting levels was so amazing that we spent one of our best gaming evenings ever, because of the two reasons. Smashing the cartgride was a new amusement for us too, haha. That's how I discovered it, and you know, it will be always on my mind, thanks for doing this video and thanks for doing such those great games, you guys made me so happy with Sonic 3d, and Toy Story back then, and still now. Greetings from Spain :)
Is this why hitting the VCR would make it work again? XD XD Seriously though it's pretty ingenius, it's like doing the age old turn it off and on again in a way that the user doesn't notice, and compensates them with a reward. I'd hate to be the person at school to have claimed to unlock a level select to my friends, and have no-one believe me because I couldn't replicate the bug ;)
I wish more cool stuff would happen if I punched other games\n\nIt's Both a stress reliever AND a fun secret
Meanwhile the otherwise awesome Sonic Mania, on Switch at least, sometimes just throws you back to the system menu with a generic The program was closed due to an error message.
Loved this. I discovered this with my brother when one of us stumbled into the cord and the megadrive fell and then the magic happened. We were less careful than the hand moving the cartridge. We thought our game was special or something.\n\nYou made my day remembering those days!
THAT'S the ultimate it's not a bug, it's a feature type answer!
Wait. *YOU* worked on Mickey Mania? My daawwg! I played the shit out of that when I was little! Thanks for the game, man!
This is amazing, fantastic channel and wonderful insight!
MICKEY MANIA, holy shit I miss that game.
I think i did this in Contra 4: Hard Corps. I did something similar to jiggling the cartridge and it gave me 99 lives. I still remember exactly what i used to do to replicate the cheat
Woah who are you and what else did you work on?
Thank you so much for explaining my childhood
I was 7 or 8, turned the game on and somehow the level select screen came on. This was long before I knew about cheat codes. When I learned the level select code in early middle school days I wondered about that time back then I somehow accessed level select. I guess this video 18 years later solved the mystery. I must've unknowingly hit my Genesis...
Or like the gamr if xmen were u have to push the reset button to continue
I Thought This Was A Joke But This Is Actually Really Cool
I thought this was well known in 1994. Not the technical explanation, thank you for that, but the general “cheat.”
My reaction to learning how and why did this happen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWxh9lGOeqQ
Did you heard about Secret Command for the Master System?\nAs a kid, I found out that if I wiggle the cardridge a bit and turn on the console, the third level loads instead of the first and completely without enemies.  ^^
I figured it was a crash handler when it activated on me while loading an invalid save state.
Sonic 3D Blast was way underrated, I loved that shit even though it wasnt that great in retrospect. At the time it seemed like such a cool step forward. I'd honestly love to just hear more about it, how it came to be etc
Can't get Level Select to work? Punch the cart!
Would it be possible to share what's it like to port this over to Sega Saturn? If my memory serves me right, Sonic Xtreme was cancelled very late into development and Sonic 3D was chosen to replace it. Is there any personal experiences you could share?
Is there a reason the level select code is BARACUDA, though? I need to know the context of this before I die.
Hey quick question for you.\n\nI always thought TT started as an amiga demo band. I specifically remember a platformer demo, in a forest with some kind of mage with a hat? Am i correct? I thought TT were in a couple of megademos too. Bizzarely I cannot find anything on the Internet about this, so If I didn't mix up anything, prototypes from the early days would be cool.
I find it interesting that people thought it was on purpose and Funny enough that it was on purpose yet not expected by the creator himself. It literally just people manipulating the bug handler.
Fantastic video. Can't wait to see more stuff like this, it's so interesting to me to get a behind the scenes look at these games! I loved Sonic 3D as a kid, but had no idea about this trick.
Wait, you worked on both Sonic 3D AND Mickey Mania!? That alone warrants a subscribe.
Holy shit! I thought this was the only person this had happened to! It worked every time as well!
You wrote some Sega Genesis games? That's awesome! Have you heard of the SGDK project(Sega Genesis DevKit)? I'd like to see what you could do with it.
Is the SEGA approval process also the reason why Mickey Mania handles the case of the hardware switching regions? https://tcrf.net/Mickey_Mania:_The_Timeless_Adventures_of_Mickey_Mouse_(Genesis)#Japanese_Lockout
Punching the Sonic 3D cart lets you access a level select
lol i never attempted that back then. i just didn't want my games to break
This guy... programmed Mickey Mania? Holy shit, I played that a ton as a kid on my SNES. Great game!
Wait... YOU programmed Mickey Mania?  That's awesome.  I'm wondering, can you answer a question that's always bugged me about that game?  If ROM cartridges are so fast at transporting data, why did the SNES mickey mania game have loading screens?  I didn't think the SNES even had enough memory to store enough data to necessitate loading.  Is it just actively decompressing the sprite data at that time?
I know that Sonic 3 (& Knuckles) has something sort if like that. It happened when I was using the debug.\nAfter doing many bugs with the debug, I can say that when a error happens in Sonic 3&K, the game would automatically Soft Reset back to the SEGA logo and title screen.\nIt doesnt give a message of why it crashed, but the game has a anti-crash/lockup system to it.
Any way to activate this in the Sonic Mega Collection version?
That's so cool, and it's awesome to watch a video made by an actual developer!  Thank you for your work, it was my first introduction to Sonic as a kid and is the first game that pops to mind when I think of the series.
I've found a new favorite channel.  I love learning about how games were developed!
This is like wrapping your entire code in a try catch block. OMG>
Interesting to see this channel pop up almost out of nowhere with some personal insight on the design of these older genesis games.\n\nHello Jon, I'd recently tried to get a crowdfund going for my own game based on the technical roots of that generation of gaming, a railshooter called StereoRem; but couldn't find enough interest from people to develop it further. Programmed in java, it was likely more complex than anything a console from that era could handle given my 800mhz PC could barely handle it. It breaks my heart to see selective nostalgia for these older games, but maybe your channel could more fully explore these earlier works from your history to educate budding game developers and encourage a more broad retro appreciation that could see more games like the old still developed into the future.
Brilliant
Genius absolute genius

Accessing the Sonic 3D level select crashes Paper Mario.
Try:\n      Everything\nExcept:\n      Levelselect()
What's the music ? Wicked indeed maestro programmer =}
What is the music used in this video? Thanks!
Okay, you know what? Story time. I just hope that Jon sees this.\n\nBack when I was a kid with my Mega Drive, I had S3DB rented and I was playing on a birthday night with some friends. I think I stopped to get cake or something? When I got back, we couldn't unpause the game. So we wobbled the cartridge and lo and behold, that was the first secret I ever found in a game.\n\nBut the level select never worked that way for me, only through the BARACUDA code. I only got the message, and from that point on, had to restart the game. I was always proud of that, honestly.\n\nFinally figuring out why it happened feels amazing. Kudos to you, this is a very intelligent trick! And thank you so much for developing this and Sonic R. They filled my childhood with memories that I'll never forget, especially this one. <3
I do vaguely remember falling down a pit in the ghost level in Mickey Mania and getting that WILD message. Now I feel bad for all those Gaming magazines telling the kids on the secret level warps in Mickey Mania but chances are they just didn't work for them.   Speaking of this game... I saw something about decompression in the error codes listed, is that the reason there is a loading screen in Mickey Mania? I always wondered that...
I'm unclear- were you a developer on this game? It sounds like you worked on Mickey Mania and Toy Story. If so, cool!
Really great look. Thank you. Looking forward to the Sandler blush blog.

hello Im new to your channel. How come your eye is so white? I think that helps with your make up. My eye is really red. Probs from the computer I use at work. But what do you use that they are so white?
When my 20 yr marriage dissolved at age 40.. per him, it was so hard, dating was the last thing on my mind.  I would hear ppl express that you will know when the time comes.  It's so true, at 47 I met a beautiful man.  Now at age 50, my  3 young girls are young adults now and I am having fun.  Marriage is not a priority, just enjoying life.  Best wishes on your journey
I am always amazed at how easily some people apply their mascara.  It takes me ages and it's the bit about make up I hate doing most (besides my right eye brow!).
You look stunning. I have been watching your videos for like 5 years. I wish I could have a make up lesson with you
Just lovely! Really looking forward to that watercolor blush video!
This is super gorgeous sam! And pls start dating again.. You are so hot! 😻 much love frm malaysia  ❤️
You're gorgeous and funny! Go get some dates!!!
Gorgeous .... Lovely make up !!! Good love on your dating 💕💕💕
You are the best! And yeah, Ryan Gosling is sweet 😉
Any man should be privileged to have the opportunity to date you! Best wishes and hope you find the One who appreciates you!
Your hair is amazing as well. Awesome overall look!
I loved this makeup!!! It's just wonderful for the day. Love it❤️
That blush is beautiful
Oh can you pretty please do a Rachel from Blade Runner make-up/hair look?  I'm so  obsessed with Sean Young! 😍
Such a pretty look!!! :) I bought that Nars eyeshadow a couple of months ago and I love it so much, I've been wearing it all summer!!!\np.s: what nail polish are you wearing? It looks like the perfect rosy nude.
Personally I really like dating, just getting to know new people is so interesting. Just have a good time with it en enjoy it. And I like the make up ;)
My God Sam, how are you not a supermodel???? You have the most amazing face!!
Those eyes...soooooo sexy. Damn hot, go on a date, just have some fun 😘
Lol at thinking about men 24/7!
Please do a video to share your skin care routine. Also share a tutorial specific for real techniques brushes for newbies. :)
Help me out guys I am a new fan of Sam and I was under the impression that she had a husband as mentioned in a video she posted in August. In this video she's talking about dating again. What's the story there? Has she shared that story in another video? Just a bit confused.
Gorgeous! Sorry to hear about your separation from your partner..or maybe not..you seem happy.. fierce woman!!
Have you tried Hourglass Hyalauronic Foundation? It’s expensive but took a few years off my face bc it’s sort of skincare too...
Gorgeous as usual. So beautiful. It would be a tremendous, wonderful thing for you to be seeing a guy or two, or three! If you want to, I say GO FOR IT, SAM! You certainly deserve all that life is about, again, if you're interested. God knows, there will be an army of men calling around, for you are strikingly attractive, intelligent, interesting, and fun! ❤️❤️❤️
how you talk is so cute hhaha
Well done! Turning 40 soon and I’ve been feeling a tad old lately. Any advice for people with freckles and reddish skin? I can never seem to wear blush (too red) and contouring coupled with the bronzer makes me look dirty...
Date girl! Get your life!
Yes please! A video of all the blush colors ! You look amazing 😉
KiKo is awesome ... love it\nAmazing fast look ... 👍🏻
I'm guessing there's now a humungas queue of men outside your house. Take your pick Mrs, stunning!!!
beautiful! I wouldn't have guessed you're 40 at all :)
You are gorgeous & deserve an awesome guy so get out there!
Like ur nail color maybe u can add info in description box just in case someone likes it 👍🏻
Where do you get your Botox done?
I am sure you’ll find someone to date soon, because you are so gorgeous 😊
I love this look!
Could you or have you done a video on Primers?
Love the Kevyn Aucoin eye gloss! Saw it in one of the previous video's and wondered what is was that you put on your eyelid :)
I really like your personality
You look so gorgeous. And i think you should try dating again 😊
Would really Love to see the Daniel Sandler blush video!!
ARGH!!  I have that one eye lash that grows straight out too...  Boooooo.   It blows!   Beautiful look btw!
Do you use sun protection? I'm wondering because you said about your skin tone changing with the seasons. You always look great and love your makeup looks btw
Definitely do get back to dating Sam! I got out of horrible long term relationship 4 months ago and it left me in pieces. Been dating someone lovely for a month now and I'm over the moon even though I didn't even consider getting involved with a new person for at least a year 😄 good luck to you, gorgeous ☺️😘
Naturally stunningly gorgeous!!!! Love how elegant you ladies are💚💚
You are stunning and funny. Get dating lady ⚘
gonna shoot myself as I will never look that beautiful ever.. :(
Makeup is so lovely. Love natural makeup. On another note your hair colour is amazing. Do you know what colours your hair dresser uses? 🙄 would love a hair change and yours is very natural looking, gorgeous.
Please make that Daniel sampler liquid blush video!!! Thank you xx
Absolutely gorgeous! You are a natural, stunning beauty and I learn so much from watching your techniques! Love me some Pixiwoo!
You look gorgeous however you do your makeup. This one is particularly pretty, though. The UD primer you mentioned...has it been discontinued?
omg please where'd you get your earrings and the necklace??
You have such pretty eyes! I love how dark hair brings out light eyes. I wish mine were lighter.
Good lawdy, I'm only 20 and my foundation ages my skin so much, making me look 80. My dream is to have my skin glow like yours even though I'm half your age :( Dry skin problems
Aaaaah you are sooo beautyful! I love this makeup and I will have to try it!
Hard to believe you are forty. Start dating again and have fun.
Easy piecey...all you need is her gorgeous mug or at the very least her piercing blue eyes...that's all and a bit of lip balm of course. #UghThoseEyes
I just share this every opportunity I get:\nChris Pratt = Crisp Rat.\nAnyhow, love your videos! I also love the sisterhood between you two.
The way you talked about Chris Pratt was so cute...you are gorgeous :)
I love this look. Simple and yet beautiful. Thank you. ❤️
My goodness you look so stunning, young, glowy and gorgeous!😍💕
That gloss in the last makes you just FUCKING GORGEOUS.
That is amazing. Just amazing. Thank you! I'm trying that look ASAP!
Hey guys, I was wondering if you could help. I have to take daily medication that can make me sweat a lot when I'm out and about and I find it really hard to do a face of make up that will then sit nicely, do you have any suggestions? Thank you! Xxx
I wanted to say thank you for your youtube channel.  I suffer from mental illnesses and this channel makes me feel beautiful without having to do anything. Nik and Sam, you two make me feel like I've known you for years.  It makes my day when I get to watch a videos.  Thank you two again, Nikki
When I look at you I see so much Bella Hadid!
*So gorgeous!! NEED all of those products, ASAP. BTW~ Isn't Chris Pratt single now??* 😜 𝕏𝕆.💕💋
Hope you went out and about after doing this look-sure to meet a man and get asked for a date! By all means, start dating-you are young, smart and beautiful-go for it!
Gorgeous Sam and good for you and dating😀👍xx
Sam do you recommend the CT Light Wonder Foundation for mature combination skin over 50? Thanks 😘
Go get your man girl!!!!!!
I know you are beautiful, but this is the prettiest I've ever seen you!! Amazing look, loved it!!
Good God is that a gorgeous look! I can't wait to try it out (once I get my acne cleared up...sob!) :)
Gorgeous look! Let the dating fun begin! :)
Very nice. Classic. Grace. Beautiful. Royalty glow.
Lovely!!
ok this is HEAVENLY! :o <3
Lovely 🤗
Wow! Amazing as always!

Gorgeous look!
Kate Moss??
Ooh ooh! Chris Pratt is getting divorced! 😙
You r sooooo beautiful
Beautiful
Burnt twigs...
Beautiful look, Sam!  Did you use your Miracle Complexion Sponge wet or dry?
Might you recall (and be able) to share the name of the shade of the Kevyn Aucoin Diamond Eye Gloss you used in this video, please?  Was it Moonlight, or Cosmic?  This look is breathtakingly beautiful on your exquisite face.
I've been hearing more of this Youtube affectation on Sam recently. Is the Youtube accent in speech an acquired thing? It's not a bad thing though I just noticed
*YAH! NEW PINK MUSIC! Pink never fails to make amazing music and this song is amazing. I'm literally counting down the* *days til her new album on October 13th. Pink is such a raw and talented artist and it would be a dream come true to sing* *with her one day. Hope you like my music. Pink is back and better than ever!*
Raise ur glass cause this song is fuckin perfect ❤
It looks like a sequel from Just like a Pill !!!
P!NK please honey, come to 🇵🇱 Poland!
This is much better than What About Us. I hope this will be number 1 all around the world.
Theres a similarity of sound from minzy's song superwoman. You should listen guys
She is a role model She sings what She wants She does not follow tendencies like most artists to keep in the charts\nShe is a diva my diva
This is so emotional, I can't feel my legs
Oh wow!! My girl P!nk is back better then EVER:) I am so happy and yes today is a great day:)
I love pink. Hate the color
Dear Pink I want you on my Dink!😰
5K of views is mine. 😑
Guys can someone pls reply to my comments 😕\n\n\n\nPls pls pls pls pls I’m begging  you no one ever dies
Pity about the weak lyrics, hope Willow Heart isn’t listening
If You're An Upcoming Artist Check Out My Page For Free Beats!🔥💯🚨
Beautiful trauma ...never thought of it this way.now it feels better.my beautiful is rock bottom
Girl you deserve the Grammy
The best heard it on the radio
Just like wine your music keeps getting better with time
I have got to say you are the best!\nYou are my favourite singer\nPlus this song is the best
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BEAAUTIFUL- I love it so much and have done a cover on ma page check it out it you liiike :P
Can’t wait for the new album😍🙏🏾💯
Let's take in mind, my birthday is this Wednesday (11), my father had said that one of my will be late and I'll get it after my birthday \nThis album comes out 13th, but it's probably different for Australia (where I live), so its after my birthday \nDad knows this is coming out\n*Hint Hint* 
Love this! I can't wait for this album.
her and eminem thank you :)
I was disappointed with What about us because it just felt safe and not edgy enough for Pink...Then I heard this and am confident the cd will be great! This is a cracker!
Q U A L I D A D E
Im so sad that her punk rock style has gone..
This demo is not too bad Ke$ha :)
Her music keeps me going. It's real, this one next to The Great Escape is my favorite.
Who else heard my humps when she sings my love???
Omgggg this is amazing love ya Pink
PInk, I love you!!!! You are beautiful and elegant!!!💋👍
i love this song
pink never changed.. great songs... am i right guys
I really don’t know why i’m crying right now :( this is so beautiful ❤️
Song needs more views!! Love this song and you Pink!! Ur my fav
This song really blows me away. Luv u forever P!NK
Germany 🇩🇪 \nI love this song ❤
She really can do no wrong <3
great song <3 I'm in love with P!nk! :)
I have a feeling Beautiful Trauma is just going to shit all over Funhouse's record breakingness... in Australia at least. And Melbourne is totally going to have to figure out a way to fit more people into an arena to see this talented bitch melt out faces off. Though considering the content so far, I think there is probably nothing more relevant or needed in America right now.
Another reason for us to love Pink.
I LOVE HER!!!! SHE'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL INSIDE & OUT!!!
this is so beautiful
I Love you P!nk😘
Mz Pink!!! You can never go wrong with Pink....NEVER!!  ❤💋
LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH!💖
I have a dream.. that one day I will be a successful musician, Some people don’t believe in me, but maybe you will <3\nI'm an 20 year old singer/songwriter, i would be honored if you stop by my channel and give me a listen :) thumbs up so others can see? you won't be disappointed  ;)
P!nk is my love, my drug, oh!!!
Her music just keeps getting better............
This song is a drug, and I'm addicted to it ♥
I'm addicted to this song right now. Can't get it out of my head. Reminds me of my shitty ex. Love him. Yes. But a fucked-up fucker? Yes as well.
Would of been better without the F WORD
Cool. Thx for this hit!
Love you Pink 💖 💖 💖 💖 💖. Thank you for Beautyfull Musik 🎶

If you are her DAD. Then that would make you a DOG. Are you a dog. \n\nThat would explain. The Behavioral problems. That you have.  So you are a  DOG fucker. And the so called DOG is a mix of your D.N.A. & that of a dog. \nWOW you are one sick dude. \n\nNOW is none of that is true then you are not her DAD. Then you just need to learn. What the words you are saying mean. \nI hope you figure it out. Good luck with it. Poor poor DOG. It need a Master with a brain that's not so dumb. HAY MAYBE the dog can teach you. It seem to have a higher IQ! LOL

Ahh so bummed you missed out on event finals. High bar was so close!! Good luck in the all around!
The world championships are here in Montreal and I haven't heard of it anywhere! Man!
Hey Nile! My father is a competative golf pro and is constantly talking about the importance of hydration (for obvious reasons lol). Could you tell me a bit about the machine you guys use to check your hydration levels, as well as the tablets you take to help (how do they work)? I think he would be very interested! Thanks, and as always love the videos!
you're staying right across the street from where i used to live omfg
Such a nice lad I mean really nice, genuine, warm, funny and caring. I wish Nile and the team all the luck in the world
I saw you on Sunday (because I'm a volunteer) but I want to actually meet you so bad!! I hope I'll get the opportunity! Love you xx
I'm from Trinidad and didn't know we have a gymnastic team until seeing this video. #GoTNT
Thank you for the playlists :D
Im so excited for the world championship! Hope to see you preform when i come!
What tablet do you put in your water?

Hey I’m an American medical student from SXM and I’m now living in Preston,UK. Good luck at worlds and maybe run into you on the streets! Cheers!
Looking fit Nile mate, best of luck!
You are Amazing you have inspired my in gymnastics to never give up and dream what you beleive 😁😁
Welcome to Canada! I love Montreal! Ahaha ha showing off our Canadian Monopoly money!
Lol Imagine if they found out!\nBTW Don't Read My Name
Good to see u buddy.  I missed you.  Man, you are amped up.  Were you drinking Red Bull.  Best of luck at the competition.👍👍
Why aren't you verified yet?
Nile u were staying in the same room I did in Montreal
Please show us a competition, a majority of TV channels will not show. At least in Brazil they will only show the finals and in closed channels (paid)... Nile, continue your incredible work, I'm supporting you here
Damn I love when you dance man
I want to fly and handstand with you...
How's Montreal? \nDid you learn some french words?
This was actually a quite entertaining and well produced vlog. Great job
Your personality is awesome❤I hope I can get to meet you one day and get to talk with you! I have a GREAT IDEA to tell you, my twitter is @peque2111 in case you want to contact me!
Nile Wilson is such a great, beautiful, and inspirational human being ever!
I knew you'd vlog, been so excited for it ;)
I want to learn Japanese just so I can have a conversation with kohei and kenzo
Handstand on a plane. How do you top that? Love the comradery!! 😘
Holy yeaaaaaaaaah, I'm coming to see you guys on the 8th! I'm so excited! Get that podium Nile!
I'm in Montreal for the championships. I wish I could meet you
OMG you are to Montreal 😍
So exciting!  Can't wait to see you Monday!
Welcome to my home town. Hope you're having a great time.
Need a T shirt bad, in white...help help I've injured my back but don't give a fuck..yes I'm very limited at the mo but ..the back support I use is very helpful
I'm going to upload my own video 'Taking a shit at 40,000 feet' :)
Gymnasts are the best, cutest, funniest, most athletic, and beautiful people in the world.\nNile's videos just bring joy, and brighten your day!  That's why everyone loves him!
Shirai is freaking monster on the floor! :O
I wish I could meet a world champion gymnast...... (nile Wilson)
Good luck for World Championships Nile. Love your channel and your positivity.
Oooooo did a hand stand on a air plane What a bad ass lol YouTube is broken XD
When you get home do a gymnastics challenge with the women where you guys try eachother's apparatuses!!!!
Do a meet up in montreal !!!!!
ah i love the japs, uchimura, what a boy. love that you guys are still friendly with your competitors even in sport where you could potentially isolate yourself from the world and just train individually.
The gravity gets weaker as you move further away from the earth's core. So you're effectively cheating. And people liking your cheating video.
omg I live in Montreal!! I wanted to come see you perform but I can't because of school... would have loved to meet you though!
good luck!! hope you absolutely smash the comp!
Omggggg MONTREAL?!!?? How did I not knowww?!??? I live in mtl!!
I'm from Montreal! It would be so cool to meet you.But I can't come to the championships because of school🙁
To Montreal.......nice.  I wanna move to Canada lol.....if Mexico didn't have the cartels I'd move there and live like a king on American dollar.  Same thing....if Macedonia wasn't so expensive to fly to and on the verge of Civil wars and shit all the time I'd go live there for a Summer like a king because I still got relatives there.  Good luck with the world championships dude!  Hope u smash it!
It might sound weird but you're my idol!
You know if anyone In space does a frontflip or turn upside down. You would be beatin
I'm so happy that you're in my city right now! I hope you enjoy your stay! :D
Good luck !
Banter on point
Cool vlog!

Do you know Marios Georgiou from Cyprus?
2:05 I died, hahahahah
This was a SWEEEET vlog lad but you know what I want? Ima need more of that UCHI footage!!!!
What kind of gimnastics you are training?cuz i really wanna start gimnastics the kind of u
i assume there's a set list of moves or routines that you have to hit for most/all your competitions, is there any freedom in terms of creating new moves or doing something people don't usually see within competitions(everything that can done can't have been done already, right?!) , or is this marked down. I see you challenging each other in gym/training setting, just wondering if gymnastics as a whole tends to be traditional...\n\nI am looking forward to the next 'nile vs....' video...ice skating? rock climbing? :-)
Where can I watch the championchips in Internet?
Nile, congrats! And good luck in the finals! // hey, there is something  I dont quite understand, how come some gymnasts perform in only one or two disciplines and bot all? I would be thankful if somebody explained this ... : ))
where to buy these headphones? :D
What kind of English do you speak man I can barely get you!!
Well done  Nile on making the squad good luck in the world championships. My daughter is recovering from a fractured elbow from a fall off the beam. She has been following you since you visited her gym for their 1st aniversary and you have inspired her to keep going thankyou xx
Why did you take off your shirt to do a handstand?
hi Nile! I'm so sad, I wanted to come and watch the world championchips but I injured myself and I have to get surgery... I broke my right knee and 3 ligaments and my leg at a trampoline park, I'm gonna keep a cast on my whole leg until january... I'm so sad I can't do gymnatics this year, only conditioning, it sucks... I love you so much thank you for sharing your Journey with us!
Hey Nile, when do you find out if you are in the com games team? or are you already in it?
Who is this guy ?
The  gymnast who is in Nile's vlogs that fell into the judges was in this video at the end. Haha\nThe Most Awkward Moments in Sports On Live Tv | Funny TV Bloppers
My 12th birthday was 10 days ago
Do the girls gymnastics while wearing a girls leotard (like if you agree)
Are the world championships shown on TV??
You're a cool guy, Nile. But you're not going to defeat Epke Zzonderland.
Hey up Nile, How r u doing, all right ? What do u think about calisthenics skills ? Cuz looks like gymnastics some times
what is the Bane Mask that you wear when you are warming up sometimes?
IS ASH A COUCH NOW

Try dgVoodoo 2 ...they started cooperation with GoG ...maybe games like Dungeon Keeper 2 will finally look how it supposed to...
This is looking great for 1997. :) I love to see that you used Amiga for modeling (real 3D if I am not mistaken).\nEnvironment layout looks great, and so the textures. Very good atmosphere, overall. \nWith fixed camera, and character animations, good story, good quests, this could be a real classic from late '90.\nGreetings from Serbia. :)

Amazing interview. Shame these guys never worked in gamedev again.
I wanna play it.
Alone in the Dark. :)
The poles have the best games and the best country
И для 1997 года вполне себе неплохая графика!

Ну ок. Почти всё понял. Интересное, годное видео. Было бы интересно увидеть в действии.
PCGamer o was napisał <3
Wedmak na minimalkah, yoba.
Выглядит очень хорошо, для 97 года игра мне кажется была бы прорывом, портировать ее на PS1 думаю вышло б. Даже если игра в основном брала б текстом... эт такую игру потеряли(
4:11 maciek z klanu się odpalił
Gulman: Geralt Edition \n:D
Привет с 4PDA :3
Это Же Гульмэн !
English comment passing by...
Damn, you're ugly
Polska......
Amigaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Stary Wiedźmin wygląda jak Gulman
Gameplay pochodzi z prawatnych archiw... - chyba ARCHIWÓW :F :F :F :F
Ale se kurwa dramke narobałeś
Kiedy System Error? ^^ (bait)
Za to kochamy Arnh.eu
Ta gra byłaby zajebista!
Ale kamera była totalnie zwalona
Ten wiedźmin wyglada jak Mariusz Drężek
Cudna robota! Szacunek na zawsze!
o kurcze blade
Kto nigdy nie gral w wiedzmina, lapka w gore :)
szacun
Zagrałabym w to demo
nagyon komoly :D kar hogy nem adtak ki :(
Piszą o Tobie w radio (jak to zabrzmiało :P ) http://www.antyradio.pl/Technologia/Gry/Tak-20-lat-temu-mial-wygladac-Wiedzmin-17566
Totalnie zaskakujace archiwa nawet nie zdawalem sobie sprawy z tego ze byly realizowany w tych latach juz tak powazne projekty :D
ale bym sobie kod zrodlowy tego cuda poprzegladal :-(
Ktoś powinien dokończyć ten projekt i wydać.
Archon, a nie myslales zeby postarac sie zebrac tych ludzi i doknczyc tego pierwszego Wieśka? Pieniazki na patronite pozbierac zeby ludziom zapłacic, pomysl jaki teraz ten wiesiek mogłby zrobic szum wokol siebie w gronie takich retro freakow jak Ty!! :D
ten material    jest przecietny i troche za krotki    ale to moze takie wraznie tylko dlatego ze   tamten  byl mega wypasiony :/
Ale z was archeolodzy. Wczoraj Gothic Sequel, dziś demo Wiedźmina, jutro odnalezienie Half-Life 3, a pojutrze Archon odkryje sens życia! Czapki z głow Panowie
Ojej, Panowie nie mieli na czym tego odpalić, a u mnie od lat zalega dubel w kolekcji pod postacią VooDoo 1. Resztę sprzętu bym dorzucił gratis ;)
Naprawdę dobry film. Jeszcze lepszy silnik, oświetlenie wygląda imponująco, a system kamer mógłby być nawet niezgorszy
Nawet PC Gamer o tobie pisze! <3
Mam działające VooDoo i 3Dfx :P gdzieś jest zakopane w piwnicy razem z celeronem na Slot1
Wow Real 3d na Amidze :D He he chłopaki a pamiętacie korekcję perspektywiczną tekstury na kwadracie złożonym z 2 trójkątów, czy już za Was to robiła biblioteka 3d. :D
Możne na tej podstawie zrobi ktoś remake
Co to są prywatnych archiw? Kto dodał ten opis, autor wywiadu?
Jestem w szoku. Tak wyglądająca gra w  tamtym roku, jakby do tego dodać super fabułę to odniosłaby myśle, że duży sukces. Pozdrawiam i szanuję. :D
Na moich oczach tworzy się piękna Historia, dziękuję Panowie!
Żeby takie cudo przetrwało jeszcze długo to proponowałbym dodać kody na jakąś stronkę gdzie wszyscy mogliby nacieszyć oko jak została zbudowana ta gra :D (jakiś Github czy coś w tym stylu.).
arhn.eu - teraz tylko znajdźcie działającego Polybiusa i możemy zamykać
Archon pewnie pod dupą trzymał to demo tak jak dodatek do Gothica
To jest odpalane pod eulatorem 3dfx na Amidze?
Nieco mi ten Wiedźmin przypomina Dark Earth z 1997
MOŻE MOŻNA KUPIĆ AKCELERATOR VOODOO NA ALLEGRO \nAkcelerator DIAMOND MONSTER 3D 4MB (3dfx VooDoo) CENA NA ALLEGRO PL 24,00 zł
Pełen szacunek za odkopnie dema, a także zaproszenie świetnych gości. Jestem pod wrażeniem :-)
Czy ja dobrze widzę, że modele 3D były robione na Amidze w Real3D ?
Łohoohooo! Arhn, Archonie i wszyscy, którzy przyczyniliście się do odnalezienia i powstania tego materiału - chwała Wam za dokonane odkrycia. Świetny materiał. Tego dłuższego nie miałem jeszcze, niestety, czasu obejrzeć w całości, ale już wkrótce dokończę. Brawa!
To się pojawiło w okolicach pierwszego wiedźmina.
To uczucie kiedy grasz w Wiedźmina III na najmniejszych ustawieniach graficznych
Takie materiały (mimo, że opierają się jedynie na rozmowie), mógłbym oglądać godzinami :) Poproszę więcej, chociażby na drugim kanale arhn.eu!
Wieki szacunek za ten materiał =D
Masz najlepsze wywiady ever! propsy
mega materiał! oby więcej takich
Odkąd w jednym z komentarzy pod dokumentem na temat pierwszego Wiedźmina pojawiła się informacja, że istnieje grywalna wersja tego legendarnego Wiedźmina od studia Metropolis, a na dodatek jest jeszcze z niego film na YT, czekałem na ten materiał. :D Dzięki za wywiad, świetna sprawa i idealnie dopełnia opublikowany niedawno film dokumentalny. :)
Dlaczego Arek Kamiński jest dubbingowany? :)
Jest może szansa na opublikowanie scenariusza? Bardzo mnie ciekawi jak ówczesny zespół zapatrywał się na fabułę  :)
Hej. Zdaję  mi się że w 10:21 Pan Jarek nie mówi przeżuło a przeżyło (lekki błąd w napisach). Taka drobna dygresja :)
A dlaczego projekty powstawały na Amidze? :)
Jestem światkiem growej ARHeologii ! Brawo ! Zupełnie się nie spodziewałem, że kiedykolwiek zobaczę jak wyglądał pierwszy Wiedźmin. Niesamowite znalezisko.
Chmielarz,żeby się teraz nie spocił od tego sapania..
Baaardzo fajny follow up po filmie o historii W1. Gratulacje dla Arhn.eu i dla twórców z tamtych czasów.
nie no, za dużo wiedźminów teraz XD juz nie wiem jaki demo technologiczne oglądam , czekam na film pt. odnaleziony brudnopis Sapkowskiego ze szkicem swiata wiedzmina
ZMIAŻDŻYLIŚCIE! Rozwialiście wszelkie wątpliwości. Żaden Damian Zielarz ain't got shit on you!
Pamiętam, że szkice do tej gry były dla mnie impulsem do zapisania się na Wiedźmińską listę dyskusyjną. Ktoś jeszcze pamięta co to były listy dyskusyjne?
Przydało by się solidne wyjaśnienie jaką rolę w tym co właśnie widzieliśmy odegrała Amiga. Co to za emulatory, które dzisiaj pozwalają uruchamiać te odnalezione materiały produkcyjne?
Kurcze, oni mają gierkę, ale nie mają sprzętu z tamtych lat, żeby ją odpalić na pełnoprawnym Voodoo, ja za to mam sporo takiego sprzętu, m. in. akcelerator Voodoo 1  oraz kartę graficzną Voodoo Banshee. Ciekawe czy daleko ode mnie mieszkają.
Hej. Uwielbiam Cie słuchać masz rewelacyjny głos i płynnie się wysławiasz.\nCiekawe materiały ze świata gier i konsol, naprawdę cieszy mnie, że mój znajomy mi Cie  polecił. Pozdrawiam
Wygląda fajnie to mogła być naprawdę fajna gra
Poljaki! Spasibo vam za etu prekrasnuju igru!!!! Luchaja na svjete!!!!!
Archonie kiedy Time Warp: PlayStation 3?
Ladne ta gra wyglonda ale 20 lat temu na tostesze z kartom vodo ps. Dacie link do dema bo chcialem sprawdzic czy dziala na prawdiwym pc
OPUBLIKUJECIE TO DEMO?!
Jarek ma bródkę na Arka, chyba zapalony widz arhn.eu :D
Pietrek kogucik <3
Czyli Chmielarz miał rację a tak się kłóciłeś z nim :) Kamera jest 3D! Fajnie że to się odkopało.
Нихуя не понятно! Че по русски не умеете говорить, пшеки ебаные? Специально слова пшикаете?
czy możecie udostępnić exe tego dema abyśmy mogli doświatczyć tego dema technologicznego
Dobrze, że to wtedy nie wyszło. Jakby to miało wyjść zamiast znanej nam jedynki to by był koszmar XD
Dzięki bogu to gówno nigdy nie ujrzało światła dziennego...
Ci goście to prawdziwe legendy polskiego gaming'u 👍
Dlaczego prowadzący mówi w tak dziwny sposób?
guys! been getting f ree gift cards everyday from here ➜ lythu.com/giftcardsgiveaway?476302034
Finally something to look forward to!
This could have been filmed by Oats Studio
Is this the covenant we deserved?
That didn't tell us crap!
Some powerful force is wiping out humanity while terraforming the world, essentially fixing what we fucked up..........I don't know who to root for.
Looks like a continuation of The Arrival which I thought was a great movie...its even got most of the same cast
Tzeentch hopes that you enjoyed your stay and gives you going away presents! Come back soon for HIS WILL IS CHAOS!
Musical formula for suspenseful trailers: monotone x repeat + rising eerie sound which peaks at climax..... getting sick of it.
So Poe and Padmè are married in this movie? XD
Um, did they film them all together? Some of this is not from Annihilation
Boring!!
nice
Ex machina was one of the best movies i've ever watched, so i'll give this a shot.
My balls are getting tripped on from watching this.
So it's extra terrestrial grey goo or something?
The book is amazing. The trilogy doesn't disappoint, either. I am impressed that someone was able to translate the off-ness of the material onto the screen, but this looks right.
Alright, stop right here. I am adequately intrigued. This is the only piece marketing you need. We don't need to know anything more about the plot. Just keep showing this over and over and asses will be in theater.
Pale destruction library necessarily scientific complain inner challenge shake inside.
Making movies about what liberals want for the earth. Nice.....
Looking forward to this one for sure as good job paramount pictures and it may not a original idea but it's also not another pointless sequel or reboot.
I don't know what the public opinion is but I really like BenTen Cucumberwong
This looks ok going full screen
I hope it's better than the book.  A bunch of build up to a big nothing burger.
Search in google: WUMO SEO. It is the best Seo firm throughout the world. They'll either rank your site or give your cash back. I support this company.
She went to a goa party and ended up in detox lol.
Liked the book. Don't like the director.
The book is so good! Really looking forward to this.
Seriously, what's so mysterious/dangerous about this? Just nuke it from orbit.
I have seen something like that blue stuff in a dream.
I am already excited for this movie!!! Sorry for the spoilers, but for people who read the book, what you do think the monster is at the 1:28-1:29 mark? I am very interested in people's opinion.
I’m a simple man. I see Natalie Portman and I watch.
there always has sex  part
writer and director of Ex machina👎👎\n\nI predict this will be a boring movie
I'm getting 'Black Swan' flashbacks with her eyebrows
0:50 and 01:15 reminds me of those fungus zombies from The Last of Us.
She's looking so old!
The older Natalie Portman gets....the more I love her.
I love Alex Garland but I prefer Emily Blunt for this movie.
Idk why i just really don't like Natalie Portman in like any movie shes in lol. I feel like shes always the same character. I'll give her props for Black Swan but thats like it fam.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
give me that video.. 'the _ that wasn't me I don't have a car
i wonder if she can see a glimpse of her future daughter
Choice title, February 2018? Unfortunately, the way the world seems to be going, none of us will be around to watch it.
Couldn't they find a least authentic actress than Natalie Portman for this role?
Looks like live action ( Origin: Spirits of the Past )
Why is it that the most beautiful things tend to be the most deadliest???    Can anyone answer me this?
Oh my gosh so excited I read this series it was amazing 3 books total can't wait to see the similarities to the book. Highly recommend reading this series it's a trip!
So they're walking into area X in this film they seem to know where theyre coming from and there are 5 people this time instead of four. I wonder if those slight changes meant anything, can't wait! :D
I think I know what happens based on the title *ANNIHILATION*!
no offense but oscar isaac is very handsome
Your weapons are obsolete, humans!
Too thin a teaser to get me interested
In the book, the linguist didn't make it through the border so there should be only 4 FEMALES in this expidetion. I'm starting to doubt this movie.
Get out of here STALKER.
Wow...we are going to have a lot of fun #Paramount ^_^
Great trailer, and probably and even greater movie. I.can't.wait.
Some kind of alien life form trying to replicate or alter earth-based life? Maybe?
This looks good, hope it doesn't be bad like other book adaptions
Padme?  What system are you in?  Why did your husband (Anakin) go first?
she was so hot. now she is a milf not very hot.
Running front latter horn arise director rest destruction average honor.
I read the book this summer, and while I have no idea how they're gonna convert it into film format I hope they do well because that shit was fire
I was hoping that being the fifth commenter on this video would accomplish something before it went viral. Oh well.

What a boring trailer
Ba-horing...

Echos of Sphere.
The kike lead is disgusting
Looks like Black Ops 3 campaign.
Sigh...
Arrival meets Avatar
I'm in..!
BWAAAAAAAAM
Its another pretentious jerkfest.
Gurl power.\nInstant dislike.
I see click, I Natalie
Pants
Alicia Vikander = Natalie Portman
looks like someone dropped paint in dish soap. Ok that's a wrap folks. We have a movie.
Yet another ridiculously nonsensical piece of fiction about the spiritual aliens... I ... just can't. I can't anymore. The creativity of the movie industry is definitely annihilated. Once movies were art, now they barely deserve the a of it, and that too only those indie movies that flop horrifically at the box office \n*sighs louder than the video's audio*
another feminist bs, this time a zionist feminist
icon Loader for: Annihilation (2018) - Teaser Trailer - Paramount Pictures https://youtu.be/W1DbI_Sk6VQ
As a huge sci go fan I'm ashamed to admit that despite reading the book twice I still found it confusing.   Good luck to the director and screenplay writers.
Third-wave feminism is cancer
I live in misawa,Japan and no one here actually cares about Kim Jon unn
0:53\n\nwhat exactly Iraq was developing? The world is on edge cause of geopolitics, not cause of a small ass country in a middle of nowhere. The only reason you even heard of it in news is because it's located on China's border and it's a great excuse to put interception missiles surrounding China - a country that actually holds US's balls.\nNa-h who am I kidding. Omerica - good, commies - bad. That's for your level.
What do you do when a blonde throws a hand grenade?  You pull the pin and throw it back. Now what do you do when Kim fires a missile? Nothing they don't work.   :þ
Nobody cares about North Korea.  Stop buying into what the media sells you.   I know people in seoul (actually have been there, as well as North Korea), NOBODY THERE CARES.
we can't predict the future btw...
Damn those first few seconds of video don't like YouTube's compression algorithm.
In a real attack an incoming ICBM will be countered with a nuclear missile. A nuclear missile detonated in the proximity of an ICBM will render it useless. The neutrons of the explosion will cause the incoming missile to Pre-detonate. Basically a small explosion that just blows the nuclear fissionable material apart.
What a lame ass cgi presentation. No one on Earth has technology to send nukes in space then reenter .  Almost all you learned and have been told on tv by NASA and gov  it's all fake B's.. I think the truth is that the usa is going to blow Hawaii or Cali up . Then we going say it came from North Korea   just like we did on 911 . Same for sadam and bin laden .
Here's why china doesn't want thaad in south korea. although the firing range cannot reach china, the radar can literally watch china and Russia's every movement. the US still wants and eye watching china and Russia, despite South Korean people don't like thaad in their country, and the new south korean president is against the deployment. well even the Japanese air space is 100% controlled by the US...... Well what a shame.
just wondering, does a kinecting impact not detonate the nuclear warhead mid air?
if north korea were stupid enough to fire, the world would annihilate them...it wont happen
Are we still talking? No one has the balls to push the button.
It's simple, just throw a rock at it.
Limited Capability Threat\nRekt
U earned a sub
The real question is..... How do we stop 20 or 30 of them.
I don't know. Gotta nuke something.
Why Is US allowed to have nuclear weapons and North Korea not?
Wouldn't even arrive to the us
Free downloads for a moderate fee ^_^
I think you're wrong here. The reason why the move was made to submarine launched weapons was its too darn easy to shoot down a missile on launch. It's really really easy to track where these missile launchers are. They are huge big slow wheeled vehicles. The us warships are in the area because they want to launch their ship born interceptors . It's takes an age for the North Korean  launcher to get ready and to prepare, so you just blow it up before it launches. Or if it does launch its trajectory is up, and it's very very easy to work out and predict where it will be 2 mins in flight , by which time you've shot it down.
Do u like to make a video how a ecm jammer work
Why would u wanna stop it?
100% inaccurate.
Trump take notes
The thought of an all out wwiii is a scary as hell thought. I don't think anyone could come out as a winner. We all lose. Most if not all would die. The planet would be destroyed. It's unnerving how far technology has come in such a short time.
they cant even track domestic plane which is missing and yet claim that can stop missile that can reach up to 13000mph.. hahaha
Please could you do a video on SpaceX's BFR? (like if you agree).
Nobody nuke Canada :(
relevant clickbait. the best kind.
My dad worked on icbm's and nukes. I know most of this :P
All these sensors, US ships couldn't even dodge a freight ship or fishing vessel.
Im in china rn, studying abroad. Right now im on holiday break in Panjin and north korea is literally a 4 hour drive from where i am right now. Hella weird
Have you forwarded this video to the U.S. military?
We can fucking kill North Korea with a launch of like the Hiroshima bomb.
No need to stop something that won't hit
How to stop it? Just use a laserpointer on it. Period.
Step 1, stop letting America sell them to North Korea
Option 1 do nothing their missiles are crap. Option 2 topple north korea sooner than laterOption 3 actual missile defenceOption 4 prick waving contest
3:07 yeah, german navy (Sachsen-class) :D
Awesome intro
Could a railgun shoot down icbm?
BMDS more like BDSM
Can some one steal it.
Aegis is no means of defense.\nIt is meant to be a means of escape from RETALIATION.
They might be more of a threat from the EMP, rather than a direct hit. Set the bomb off when it's still above the atmosphere and fry everything electronic below. Also means you don't need to bother coming up with a re-entry system.
Just because the U.S. signed something with Russia doesn't mean that both country's didn't make something. There's no way we would leave our country underfunded. Plus the U.S. doesn't listen to anyone. We do things we shouldn't but do them anyways
Intercepting a nuclear head is still extremely dangerous. A nuclear blast is harmful at any altitude, anywhere.
I don’t understand why humans can’t just shut the fuck up and leave everyone else alone. Do your own thing. Humans are gonna make humans go extinct. We are the only life that we know of. We need to keep ourselves alive and spread across the galaxy and do great things!
Can you do a video of Elon's new BFR, Thanks love your videos! Keep up the great work!
How to make people even more pointlessly afraid of something that is not going to happen.
North Korean doesnt have nuclear weapons. Your next video should about stopping western progaganda and the tyrany  of the US instead of contributing to it. \nUNSUBSCRIBED...
Blah blah blah... stfu
4:19 WTF?????..... OMG.... Heavy breathing.....
There's always tech that you don't know about. If North Korea tries to bomb it will be recorded stopped and returned to sender. I guarantee that no nuclear bomb will ever go off unless both sides agree on it
Why is there a arrow in the thumbnail man\nWhy?
https://youtu.be/m6MOaECL6FM
I am Only young,I feel bad for people like me having to worry the hell out of this thing Because I live In UK if they start Russia battling then we’re dead ;(
What happened to the star wars program were a satalite would fire a beam of energy at a missile in its silo
does anyone else remember when the US Navy destroyed that old US satellite falling back to earth in 2008? We did that with an SM(Standard Missile)from an Aegis Class destroyer. The satellite was 130 miles high and moving at thousands of miles per hour. Not only did the SM hit the target successfully the actual impact point was point on perfect. That was OVER EIGHT YEARS AGO! What we are capable of now has indeed advanced since then....we will have to wait and see
If it worked, how did NK recently fire a rocket over Japan?
Just give some thought as to what happens to a nuclear warhead after kinetic impact assuming that the missile defense shield is not just another load of American marketing bollocks. Where do you think the fallout will end up?
How to stop American nuclear missile ?? They have 6000+ warheads !!
Spray xylene on it-- will rot the rubber bands.   🐸🐸
why don´t they just load a nuke on board a long range super stealth diesel sub and sail it to the port of a major city?
this fat kid needs a spanking
Being worried about North Korea, is like being afraid of the boogie man. What you should really be afraid of is Russia. That's like having herpes, except this herpes can actually kill you.
Are we just ignoring the fact that Democrats derailed the missile defense shield just because they hated Ronald Reagan and America? Reagan and every Republican since wanted to fully fund and push for a missile defense shield, but the Democrats just didn't like him and were traitors to America, so they derailed and defunded the missile shield. Obama was  the latest Democrat to do so. Now North Korea wants to launch missiles at us, and we don't have a full scale missile shield.
The way to stop North Korea is to get the loud mouth loser Chump trump to STFU and for the USA to mind its own crappy problems at home and stop trying to tell the DPRK what to do ! \n The USA government is the problem not North Korea or Iran or Syria !
When the warheads are deployed in space you have basically no chance. when they are coming than with 4km/s or 14400km/h. Also It's very unlikely that a nation only fires 1 ICBM. each ICBM can have up to multiple warheads.
heres how you stop NK missile\n\n\n*Read more*
Next up\nHow to stop the imperialism and warmongering of America
noway to stop. all those for show selling story selling arms. try flying.
I want the plan to go wrong so they can't nuke
The fact that this video has been made tells us something about the state of the world right now. Though it's to be expected that when two insane retarded children have a catfight, someone will suffer.
How to stop Stop north korea nudes \n1. Suck your own dick
wow, storyblock is amazing!
4:25.....WTF was that?   was that just floating around on micro rocket bursts?
NK starting a nuclear war with the US is like a guy with one snow ball starting a snowball fight vs someone with a few thousand snowballs.
I thought we just look at it
How can we stop this USrAel terrorism!\nThe world do not need this Rockefeller rothschild capitalism warfare
We are Russia we have superior technology!!!
What if a North Korean sub sneaks through Mexican waters and fires a Missile there? Then What?\nWe got San Diego the Pacific Fleet in danger.
Thaad cannot intercept an ICBM and be useless for protecting mainland USA
It would be suicide for NK to engage in nuclear warfare with the US. Kim Jong Un might not care about his citizens but he still would want to keep his country.
You know shits gonna get ugly when you get these kinds of videos recommended
Let them have their nukes.\nThey are not stupid enough to use them.

If NK launched a real nuke, whether it hits its target or not, NK would have been turned to a smoldering wasteland before their missile even reached the terminal stage.

The Israeli Arrow-3 is way better than THAAD and was developed with a fraction of the cost.
North Korea uses their Nuclear Stockpile to sustain their stability in the world stage. The Nuclear weapons are to keep the US at bey, as well as giving off a possible threat of 'nuking' South Korea or Japan to keep their stance on Global Power. North Korea wouldn't dare to launch a 'ICBM' or Nuclear Weapon at the US. However, the US fear of North Korean nuclear usage would keep the US from directly conflicting NK. As well as keeping the Kim Regime standing.
North Korea doesn't want to nuke, or fight, with the US.  \nNorth Korea only wants to frighten the US enough so that they, North Korea, can retake South Korea.  If the US gets involved in such a war, North Korea will lose but if North Korea can scare off the US (or at least delay it) it could win. Will the US be willing to possibly get Seattle or L.A. nuked to save South Korea?  North Korea doesn't think so.

In all seriousness what are you and Oliver gonna do when addams is over 😔 yous still need to see eachother 😩🙏🏼
Just back from your show in Belfast and I just wanted to say you guys were phenomenal and your voice is outstanding thanks for an amazing experience, you truly brought the Addams family to life!! X
Love this so much! 😍
This was amazing to watch!!! Love it!! Also, BAKE OFF <3
What foundation do you use? And your contour? I'm seeing the show in London next Wednesday. I'm dressing up as morticia. <3
Are u and olly dating? It would be ao lovely if you did!!
It was so lovely to meet you yesterday
do you think watch me wednesdays AND shadow me sundays would be too hard to do??? It would literally make me 2x happier every week xx love you carrie!
Hey Carrie, as a musical theatre student i am really intrigued  to know what your health regime is to keep your voice at its full potential every day of the tour. Any tips would be great! xx
i'm so curious as to what oliver said now
Looks like you're having so much fun with this tour! I'm so glad for you!\nAlso would you maybe be able to slip into your next Watch Me Wednesday how you tie your LUSH knot wrap? I've seen a few different ways but it looks gorgeous on you xx\nHope you're keeping well xx
Carrie you should try micellar water to get your makeup off. works wonders!
Your vlogs are the absolute favorite part of my week!!!
Watch me Wednesday are my favorite videos!
These videos are always such a joy!
still wishing i can watch you in singapore!! if only time allowed it.
Carrie, where is that War Of The World's statue!??!
Bake off is legit the best way to end the night of shows. My husband and I do the same thing! Mary and Paul all day.
Your attitude and stance is just so great because I feel you are making unbelievably so much efforts so that everyone can understand what you feel :) it's impossible to do that without massive love to everyone. I always respect you girl! I really hope someday I can come to see you performing from Japan!! Love xxxx
since when did carrie rebranded, i don't really watch her that much but i was scrolling through my subscriptions and i was like wOAH when did this happen?
Hi Carrie, my girlfriend is a really big fan of yours and Ive tried to send you a letter but it got returned to me as the addressee wasn't there, is therr a time you will definitely be there to receive mail? Love the video btw!
Hi Carrie I saw you in chitty chitty bang bang  last year and the Adams family this year in sheffield. When I saw the the ads nd family Scott was playing uncle fester. After the show I went to stage door to  meet you but you didn't come out but I met Oliver and Samantha if was amazing,. I love your video you make me cry with laughter love you loads love from Grace xxxxx ❤❤❤
Where is 'It'swaypastmybedtime' she changed the name.
Oliver reminds me of Jack Harris a little bit
We are doing Addams Family for our school music. I’m trying out for puglsy, do you have any tips?
I love your videos! You're wonderful! xxx
The guy you were singing with on the stairs has taught me at my drama school loads!
I would love to see Scott as Fester but I'm a bit worried about Les! He has been off for ages. Hope he is doing okay. I'm seeing the show in Glasgow! Can't wait to see a vlog there if you do one ☻
I use to sing the song they were singing at the beginning with my choir, and I loved it :)
I love watching these... I literally watch these for the costumes so I can design costumes based off them for my production of Addams. Everything is so amazing here, thank you for showing us these Carrie. I know all of us in my production of Addams love your videos
Can't wait to see you perform in the Grand in October! I went to see the English Youth Ballet today and it was brilliant, then I bought tickets to see The Addams Family and I realised at half time that you were performing!! It was a great surprise
Hi Carrie. I saw you at the stage door today. I was the one that probably looked very nervous. (I was wearing a pink dress)\nI loved your performance. You were amazing!
I watched it today and it was amazing!! So glad I saw it!
All small YouTube's let's all help eachother out.sub to me and comment done. Then ill sub to you
I saw your show in Sheffield for my 7 year anniversary, you were amazing! I heard every word right from the back, and I thought you were the best singer by far.
My school's doing Addams Family this year, and I love watching these videos and hearing about your experience with the show. It's one of the reasons why I'm so excited to do it!
I'm so sad cause I was meant to be seeing it tonight but it turns out I can't come, and I really wanted to come see it cause the last time I saw you perform was in les mis and you're my favourite west end actress :(❤️❤️
I'm guessing you never know when you're going to stage door because I'll be seeing Addams family on Wednesday (oohhh) and I would love to see you at stage door but of course I get it if you aren't there
The warmup is always my favourite part of these vlogs
I came to the wednesday show in working with my school and you were absolutely incredible!!!!
ok im shocked by how long your hair has grown. i got used to seeing you with a wig or in a bun
I get so excited when a new video comes up! How many more Watch Me Wednesday's are there?
Awww I LOVE this video Carrie. I love watching the behind the scenes of all the work it takes to put on a touring theatre show omg xxx
i KNEW my hair was growing super slow compared to usually. You confirmed it coz I cut my hair about the same length shortly after you did. And I've been thinking that my hair has grown SO slowly than usual, and now I've been confirmed.
Hey guys please subscribe to my channel ❤️❤️
Awww Carrie watching you meet all the people at stage door made my heart so happy, one of my travel goals in life is to see one of your shows and hopefully meet you one day but WELL DONE THIS WAS A GOOD EPISODE ❤
I sat in the same seat that Oliver is in last time I went to the Sovereigns. Huh.. Oooh!. I went to see the show at 5 on Friday (29th) at Woking. You were amazing, Oliver was amazing, Scott was amazing. 'Full Disclosure', I loved it.
Your video is the 7 most trending video on YouTube atm!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
You & Oliver are actual friendship goals <3
Anyone else REALLY want to hear the inappropriate things that Oliver said? 😂
Why dafuq is this trending 6th, it has 56k views?????!!!!
Hahah I love the ending :'D
Aaah! I went to see the first show on Friday! I was like, middle, top in the audience. My mind is blown that you were filming somewhere I walk past several times a week. The sovereigns is a great pub - opposite the cycle shop on the corner and a walking distance from the station. I recognise the party shop because it's the shop which opens at weird times and is almost always empty. It's so weird! The chips \nin the sovereign are good tho! Anyway, the show was aammaazing!! If you guys haven't watched it, I suggest you do. It's amazing. My fave bit is whenever you pulled the creepy eyebrow slanty face thingy. Anyway, thank you again!! 😃😃
I am dying to fly to Singapore for the show!! But I live in Hong Kong (which is not that far if you consider Europe) and I have school :/ Will you be in the Singaporean tour? love you!  (also, will try to watch this ten times more to figure out what Oliver was saying) cheers x
I CANT WAIT for you guys to come to singapore :'')
I love that everyone has beer and then there's Carrie's wine glass hahahh that's absolutely me
I saw you in Cardiff Carrie and I'm seeing you again tonight, can't wait!! Break a leg to all!!
I would hope Captain America would be a bit more sure of himself 😂😂😂
Oliver trying an American accent sounds so much like Captain Jack Harkness omg
I love your friendship with everyone!! It’s so great to watch <3
I understand why but sometimes I'm so sad your channel is PG because I need to know what Oliver said in the pub
Carrie! Don't use wipes to get your makeup off. Use the Camomile Cleansing Butter from The Body Shop. It's not harsh on your skin at all and it gets rid off your make up very easily. It's also cruelty free and so much better for the environment than those wipes! x
Are you the only one from the original U.K. Cast going to Singapore? 🙃
Hunnyyy you’re hairs getting so long it’s gorgeous!!
Ah you went to my local! Good old Sovs.
❤Great video 😁 Please check out our small YouTube channel and subscribe if you like the content ❤
can't wait to watch you in Singapore!\nhope i can see you as well! I dont remember Mediacorp Theatre having a stage dooor
Are you actively trying to grow your hair out again or is it because too busy to get a hair cut? Also, loved seeing the after hours!
I’m really going to miss the Carrie and Oliver show when Addams Family is over. You guys make me giggle. 💕
Hi Carrie! Just a quick question for you and your cast mates. My school is starting our own production of the Addams family and I was thinking if any of you had any advice for playing your characters or tips for making things more fun/enjoyable in these cooky and spooky roles. If you do, I'm sure we'd love to hear from you amazing actors! Thank you and have a lovely day <3
CRAZY FOR YOU I FREAKED OUT WHEN I HEARD IT my friend was just in the musical
So many media interviews will leave you PRESSED for time!
Watching you Scott and Oliver just makes me happy 😊 ❤️ xx
Carrie, did Oliver share the After Eights I gave him for you all on Thursday night at stage door? :D
UK stage doors are so chill I expected ear drum bursting screams but overall it was quite quiet
I'm sure you've already tried it but coconut oil is amazing at getting make up off. :)
Ooh are you going on tour to Singapore too? That's exciting! :D\nSo looking forward to seeing the show in Glasgow!
I have to say it's weird to watch you be at my home town! Also sovereigns is definitely one of the nicer pubs in woking! Watched the show on Tuesday so didn't see you at stage door
You are so sweet at the stage door! A true inspiration. I would love to meet you one day!
I'm two subs away from 425 PLEASE help me reach it, I ONLY NEED 2 MORE SUBS!!\n\nCHEERS GUYS!
She's like our own little celebrity! Lol xoxo
My mum came up to Bristol last weekend to see the show with me on Sat evening, it was bloody amazing! Thank you so much to you and the rest of the cast for putting on an awesome show!! Big love <3
Omg I love the ending 😂❤
Did anyone else notice the kissing-sound around 6.58 or was that just me????
Carrie are you growing your hair long again (i was just wandering)\nP.s you were in the first les mis show my mum wached
Ollie is just the most precious gem ❤❤ i adore you both
I'm going to be subscribing to anyone who likes this comment and subscribes to my channel! Comment when done (legit)
Your hair is lovely!!!
I know Steven lol.
Bake off traitors 😛😉
Is Samantha womwick eg Ronnie Mitchell eastenders the mum
Oliver's dance omg
oh gosh, your poor skin! :D
What your funniest moment on stage
lol love it :)
Wonderful 🤗😘
but wheres pete
It's so strange to me how stage door works for the west end. In almost any venue on broadway in New York,or on a tour,there's a barrier and the actor walks down the line and says hey to everybody.
Did anyone else hear a kiss noise when there was the shot of fried eggs?
Oliver does a pretty good American accent. Speaking of, could you do a video where you talk with one, at least the parts where it's just you talking to the camera? I'm curious what that sounds like lol.
Nice to see he wants to stay thank god
A good manager, making positive steps..\nI hope Kane continues as he is too. For England and Spurs!
Western populations should shed their illusions. Our governments are committing war crimes and imposing an overseas holocaust on non-belligerent countries. The West and its allies are terrorizing and destroying countries and they are falsely projecting their own high crimes onto their victims.
I know that to produce these documentaries cost a lot of money. But seriously, all people on earth should see these documentaries, together with Planet Earth from bbc as well... because it is filled with such beauty, and makes me love even more what’s my house, and makes me more knowledgeable of with what I share my home with, our home, the only home we have ever known, and will ever know for a long time, planet earth
Please God never take this man away.
Proof that the earth is perfect
If that music doesn't scream for God, I don't know what does.
My favorite channel is BBC earth
what are the minimum requirements?
I've watched this 6 times already back to back because it's so aestheticly pleasing and I love documentaries.
Hanz zimmer nailing it as usual. Great accompany to the worlds greatest voice.
Hans Zimmer does it again! What a brilliant man
03:58 looks like marine army ready for battle
every time i watch these i'm floored by the beauty of earth...and then just as easily floored by the fact that literally everything you are watching is in the process of being rapidly eradicated by the way we all live...the ugliest thing on the planet by FAR is the human race...
always amazing how everyone agrees that this beautiful diverse life has to bee protected and then goes to eat cheap takeaway-sushi and throws the package in the next river.
Absolutely stunning! Can't wait to watch.. had tears in my eyes. <3
But why prequel?  I mean it's not like it's about marine reptiles or ancient whales
3:57 thought it was March of the Poozers lol
So sick... can't wait
It's a funny world we live in\n-The Joker.
This is so amazing....
So excited I loved the others so know I will love this one .God is good all the time and this beautiful earth proves that  Jehovah first and then every thing else lasts
Words can't describe how happy this made me
I'M SOOOOOO DOWN CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS....
David Attenborough makes every documentary awesome 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧👏🐹🐙🐒🌲\nLike if u agree 👍\nBtw don't read my profile name
Absolutely beautiful BBC, This Is Crazy Of what is in the ocean.
please tell me there is going to be an actual documentary and this wasn't it. I want more
Protect the Earth, is the only planet with a Thom Yorke.
Thank you BBC Natural History Unit
Sir David Attenborough, still speaking to us since we were children!  He is 91
Blue Planet III won't be the same without David Attenborough so this will be the last
who are the heartless people behind those 305 negative votes?
For all of us who love the BIG BLUE - this is just PERFECT - just SO perfect!
I can't even imagine taking those clips making it in a video nd presenting us .... That hard work.. salute u guys... U r best <3
I hope this goes to cinemas!
OMG this was unexpected. I can't wait to buy this one and add or to my collection. Much respect sir David Attenborough and BBC earth
I can't explain how beautiful this...  😍😭
Amazing!!! Now PLEASE tell me you will deliver this to people outside UK, for godsake
Where can I watch it? Or rent it if there is no free legal version
Please tell me there will be a segment on ruins of ancient cities submerged under that beautiful oceans!
Why no 4k? Youtube's compression makes the shots look fuzzy
The irony is I’m about to buy a new super tv to watch this on, and throw my old tv in the ocean.
Looks a lot like Blue Planet 1 to me.
Looks amazing....and it's incredible just how many species exist and how varied they are!
awsooooooooome footages,can't believe in my eyes 😮,amazing just speechless
Thanks for the hard work, sweat and tears from the BBC team to bring us the amazing life and beauty of our Planet Earth. The voice of Sir David Attenborough is always be iconic. we human being should treasure what we have and put full effort to protect it or our next, next or next generation will never see it again. Big thanks!
When?
Thumbs down, was expecting Johnny Depp

Why is it named the prequel? For some reason i thought it would be like cgi of the sea life millions of years ago.
And were ruining everything. Wherever you are, take mother nature into consideration the next time you step to the ballot box.
Lord you are amazing! Your creativity knows no bounds! Thank you for this amazing earth You have given us.
Thankyou for making it...so beautiful.. GOD IS GREAT
its looks amazing in every way its my dream to see\n the world
Cannot wait for this
Making a number two of a movie is nothing but if it's a documentary it is something
Yet another epic soundtrack from Hans Zimmer
I don't understand how anyone could dislike this, let alone 292 people.
Amazing ❤
WOW! amazing!
So beautiful. So amazing.
crying...
unatrualy beautiful
Thank you BBC earth
Show us BLUE WHALES!
too beautiful
Yesssssssssssssssssss yes yes yes
We need 4K!
Man, humans are disgusting. I watch this and wonder how long we've got left on this planet. Far too beautiful for some of the twisted Homo sapiens roaming around on it.
Wow, some of these shots seem to be fake so good they are. I even had tears in my eyes watching this from the emotion, can't wait! Praise and love mother earth.
The first blue planet was basically my childhood. I am so hyped for this, especially after how amazing planet earth 2 was
Still coming down from Planet Earth II and now this is coming out. \nIf BBC earth were a woman I'd propose.
What a captivating achievement; I'm so excited!
Every screen shot is a wallpaper
Life is so incredible! The photography in this is truly awesome. A magnificent spectacle. So extremely beautiful. We better enjoy it while we can, because nuclear waste is invading this priceless creation. Thanks to mankind the planets virus! Soon to be the universe's virus. Way to go! Shame... Shame.....Shame!
I'm excited for the series, but what about that fat pilot whale!
I'm so amazed at all of BBC's Earth documentaries. The kind of work that must go into getting this kind of footage is mind boggling.
The fact that this video isn't in 4K is disappointing. Planet Earth 2 is one of the best looking documentaries on 4K UHD. I'm sure this will be equally good if not better.
Blue planet, the stuff we're allowed to show you. Lol
Didn’t need the awful singing
Great soundtrack
Gotta love his voice!
So much vast
David Attenborough.  Enough said.
Next level quality.
Wow
so beautifull

Soy muy fan de Xtina y me encanta desde siempre, pero no entiendo esos labios, no le quedan nada bien , y no entiendo como se ha dejado hacer semejante cosa, no le hacía falta, siempre ha sido muy guapa y sigue siendo joven
Does anyone know where to buy that coat she’s wearing??
number 1 celebrity brand according to who 👀🤣😂😂😂😂
This is sum weird scary shit but, Why is it you either upload or i instantly get a recommended video of you when I'm absolutely starving? it's honestly like YouTube knows something!
As much as I like watching Matt's videos, I hate seeing people not enjoying food like you are supposed to (not taking in the flavour).
How much you can eat without time limit?
Matt, do you think you'd win against that Molly chick?
How long would it take you to eat the Seward's folly
The ad was in spanish, so I bought a couple gigas gratsieses.  I'm not sure what they are or when they arrive, help?
That isn't a mouth. That is a machine... Food grinding machine.
If you be a zombie eat the All humanity
I just watched a video of you doing a fire hot noodle Challenge and you said you would hate to a 1 million of anything and you said it was impossible I think you can do 1 million pop rock Challenge
Can you have an eat off with furious Pete that would be awesome
I watched an ad to watch an ad. This is disappointing.
How are you skinny if I eat one slice of pizza I literally gain like 20 pounds 🤦‍♀️
I always get afraid that he's just gonna chomp down on his fingers.
How is he so skinny ?
And then he eating his dinner simple, to taste it
do the fire noodle challenge in 60 sec
EAT! EAT YOU FUCKING PIG! EAAAAT! SHOVE THAT SHIT DOWN YOUR GULLET, MAKE US PROUD THAT YOU CAN STRETCH YOU ORGANS MORE THAN OTHERS AND EAAAAAAAAAAAAAT! Pretty cool though.
You missed censoring the name of the company on the side of the box (at least that's what I assume you were trying to do with the tap on the top).
Took me 13 minutes and I threw up all of it
Love the Heavy Metal Music in the back ground 🤘🏼
Serious question, what do you take to keep your digestive system so robust? I refuse to believe you take nothing. I really need some. My system can barely handle an apple, and I'm under 30 :(
Do jack in a box jalapeno poppers
Draft kings\nReality king
Looks delicious
Nuclear fire noodle challenge plz
matt stonie do 10 pounds of fries under 15 min
I’m so surprised that you eat all this food and your still really skinny
Mat you need to do Subway challenge 5 foot-long Subs of your choice 16 cookies and two bags of chips with two drinks

Lilly is SUCH a great human and we had so much fun filming together! Who do you want me to challenge next? :)
I am new. Is she fully blind
It's so intriguing to me that Molly can look around and focus her eyes even though she's blind.
Wait, is she blind?! I can't tell.
Is Molly blind? Not to be disrespectful.
what is wrong with Molly's eyes? they keep moving ! like even when she is staring at something they move like for example 3:45
I cant believe im seeing this .. lilly is soo down to earth ... molly you got the big guns with casey and lilly .. i cant deal
Sorry but what's that white spot on lily's sleeve
Died when they took so long with jenna and julien !💔
At around 8:27..that did not sound like jenna at all..lol..i recognized Julians voice when Molly said Julian..but that really did not sound like Jenna..lol. It must have been her morning voice or something..lol. Her laugh is pretty distinctive tho.
You're so lucky to collab with Lilly!!!!! are you friends even before this? :D
The stuff on Lily's shirt bothered me so much
Maybe you could do Tommy Edison's thing where he tries to guess what famous Youtubers look like.
David Dobrik was so obvious to me, and I've recently watched some of his videos
LOL lilly has a deodorant stain from Molly's hugs 😂
Does anyone else notices molly's eyes moving side to side like in an strange way?
She's blind? Omg she's so pretty💕
💕Ryan and Lilly sitting in a tree...💕
Lilly is hard to watch. Her personality isn't nearly as funy as she thinks it is.
3:20 I am offended. I am a real person!  :)
That’s cool bc my blind brother goes to Perkins school for the blind
Oh my God. You got superwoman to film with YOU! That's amazing! Good job!
It just came to me that she doesn't know what Lilly looks like...and then I was like well she probably just describes herself like well I'm Indian and then it's like I don't know what that looks like... So I'm dumb
I got them all right !!!!! Oh wait that’s kinda depressing....
Trying to workout the physiology of the fact that after watching this ive realised i only watch women on youtube, hmm weird anyone else have any idea?
I like just found you and you seem awesome
I was thinking about Alissa Violet and Here she is❤️
Wait, hold on not to be rude or anything if she's blind how can she see the videos
When she said Danielle, I felt that was a shoutout for me
Have Logan paul on your channel. He is amazing💜\nP.s I love your videos. You are inspiration to alot of people. We as a human get depressed over small things. But looking at you motivates me to keep going. We all have flaws but its our choice if we control them or let them control us.
I joined coz I thot The girl was ssSniperwolfss
When you said things were coming in one of your recent videos I was thinking of this collab! So nice to see you two in one video, you both inspire me in different ways! Hope you'll get more recognition (really sorry if I spelled that wrong oops) from this because you deserve it! Much love from The Netherlands <3 :)
I didn't know she was blind!!
I'm so sorry if I offend you are you blind I'm new to your channel

Wait she's blind can someone please explain to me cause i just found out about her
I just subbed to channel and found your videos very interesting and fun
Bruh I knew it was David the second I heard his voice.
0:52\n\nBlind what? Gurl.. Where?\n\nI honeslty couldn't have guessed that because her eyes are perfectly focused on either the camera or on Lilly 😂
Lilly and Liza yes i ship it
How do you watch the makeup videos if you're blind. No shade just curious
Is she really blind ?
If voices of youtube stars were the only voices played it will be easier then putting youtubers that are growing or not as known. Cool anyways.
I know only Jenna n safiya n lily not even Molly🙈\nI have seen Liza's 1 vdo a couple of days back n once with lily, n seen Yousef also in lily vdo n heard of link ups. I think m addicted n spend most time on YouTube but still don't know anybody 🙄
Can she stop talking over the clips wth
I love lily's thinking face

How do you get all these amazing people on your 'channel'\n\n\nEdit: Well I suppose it's cuz ur amazing too
I got like 90% in the first second loool
I wanted to watch this video again cuz I liked it so I went on YouTube to look it up but it was already suggested and I was like: HOW DID IT KNOW? 😂😂
The way Lilly talked and guess Ryan higa would be the same for me or probably even worse , cause I love love Ryan higa, love his channel and all. 😍😍😍 and also both of you of course 😍😍
Molly play the game fare and square with Lilly

I forget that you weren't deaf. I've been watching a lot of the deaf girl with the light brown hair and low voice (sorry I don't know what her name is. Well I know her first name ends with ikki and the last name is like poynter). I was super confused but this was an amazing collab
I'm new to her channel so just out of curiosity, is she completely blind? :)
@asapscience Off topic question: can you explain how an itchgasm works and why it feels good to scratch a mosquito bite?
Can you do a video on why people think they can sing when they sound awful?
Can you make a video about what will happen to our body if we didn’t eat something sweet or salty?
You don’t, you just struggle for 12 years
One thing i do naturally ....\nI never study still the topper 😂😂😂😂😈😈😈\n\n\n\nHey seriously its better not ask from me ,cuz everybody works different way, I am lucky I don't need to study much cuz I have IQ of 130+ ,it means what u can learn in an hour I can just in 5-10 mins by finding patterns and breaking things into simpler more logical meanings....\nOne thing , never study when u don't want to ,it will do no better\nIt really pays me off ...
What position is the safest for women to give birth? Squating? Or laying down on the hospital bed legs open? And do any of the position have links to life saving benefits?
I can't keep up with profs if I were to write everything by hand, I would miss a lot of information. Better to write it out on my own time later.

The combination between badminton and tennis isn’t really accurate. Badminton is very different and doesn’t even come close to tennis in any kind of way, except it’s both played with a racket. Further nice video!

One of the greater channels on YouTube in my opinion
That's right, sleep is really underrated. Schools need to learn that people don't learn better by having to cram more information. They need to be sane to absorb and understand information. Also, pay your interns.
I know your cousin, Mark.
I just automatically learn things when I'm interested in it...For instance, BTS.\n\nI KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM without studying

Got a question!! What makes somebody more or less bully, vengative and, more broadly bad?

Well actually it depends on wether you learn by repetition or by concept.

You should do a video about how to grow your hair longer!
These are mostly ways to memorize faster, not necessarily learn.
I learn this faster by watching with a doubled speed
i've got a question.\nwhy do siblings hate each other?

I've never seen before a beverage like this, I think is genial and amazing! Thanks for sharing Laura!
Looks perfect for chilly nights!! Yum!
Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe, Laura.
Nice video, got to try this
Hey Laura! I absolutely love you and your channel, every recipe looks amazing! Would you consider doing something with blueberries? I know they're going to probably be out of season with winter coming up, but maybe a dessert like cheesecake or muffins? Thanks!
So...we don't get the recipe for this?
i can't find the recipe for this?
Oh yeah how many months is you daughter now ?
I live in NY and don't appreciate 84 this time of year either
@laurainthekitchen can this be served over ice?
How dare you, now everyone will know my favorite Starbucks drink! :P
Can you have this drink cold?
When i dealt with prisoners of war. We would give them starbucks just like you made. They would losen up and be more cooperative. They were star*ucked!!!
It don't look very nice or tasty
What kinda booze would taste the best with this if I wanted to serve it spiked??
Your life, you do you~ YAS!!
Do you think this would work with regular chocolate chips?
I LOVE your make up in this Laura. You look gorgeous :) \n\nThis looks so delicious! I'm not too crazy about white chocolate but milk chocolate is kinda yucky with pumpkin :)
Made this today. Came out amazing! I skipped the extra sugar --- the white chocolate is sweet enough.
my 8 year old sister requests some pumpkin seed recipes thankss love from toronto
Sounds about white to me
is there any thing then  Pumpkin you can use I have a  allergy to Pumpkin
Dem eyez of laura’s are🤦🏿‍♂️❤️❤️
Ofcourse i will make this! Yummmmmy:) thank you Laura!!!
Sounds delicious.  I have pumpkin pie torani so I might use it.
Girl your makeup. Give us sources or techniques. So hot
Definitely looks yummy and just in time for the cool nights we’re starting to have,  a recipe that I’m going to try tfs and just a side note you look beautiful in this video love the makeup 😊💕
Hi i guys I am Laura Vitale andonthisepisodeoflaurainthekitchen LOVE IT!!!
Can you please do a regular easy homemade hot chocolate recipe?
If it's too sweet, add just a touch of sea salt to it.
White chocolate is a misnomer.  There is no chocolate in that white goop
Will try this to my girl's night get together next week 😋
thank you for giving us a real recipe. I've looked at several beverage recipe so far and they included ingredients like instant coffee and other processed ingredients. thank you for being real
The recipe is still not on the website😢
People who make fun of people who like pumpkin anything this time of year are jerks stop shamming people for what they like
I've been ordering this at Starbucks for years!!!!! Yummmmm! Now I can make my own!
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!
It’s hot out here too in California! Maybe pouring it over ice! Sounds delish to me!
Definitely need to make this because every time I order it at Tim Hortons they give me black coffee :/
what are the measurements of each ingredients?
Laura I have something you need to try. Egg nog hazelnut cappuccino. It's amazing. I was craving a cappuccino and noticed I didn't have milk. So I added some egg nog and it was amazing!! Someone probably already done it but I love it haha. Mm with whip cream on top and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
This looks great! Makeup is gorgeous
This looks incredible 😍 love love love your make up in this video too - wish you still filmed make up tutorials and make up videos xx
Thank you, thank you, thank YOU for this! I can't wait to try it!
Laura, on behalf of all ladies PLEASE resume your makeup/lifestyle channel again and show us how you created your eye look, it looks unreal!!! I know you are still a new mom and you have commitments but I would love you even more if you could show up occasionally for a good girls chat! Love you
Can't seem to find the recipe
That looks soooo delicious😋😋\nAnd your make up looks amazing 😍\nPlease show us this beautiful make up look in a tutorial 😍
I cant wait to try this with my fam
Laura , this looks wonderful and you look absolutely beautiful . My wife did the same after our first daughter and everyone thereafter .... we (my wife and I) wish you were our granddaughter
WOW i just made this.........it is SOOOO AWESOME!!!   the 2nd cup i have I'm going to add bit of nutmeg to the top    YUM YUM!!!!
I love pumpkin pie! However, most of the things to come from the pumpkin pie spice craze don't have any actual pumpkin. That kinda diminishes the experience for me. I'm so glad to see that yours has pumpkin in it! :)
Yeeeeesssssss! I've been dying for a PSL for years, but have been avoiding caffeine due to past and current pregnancy. Now this preggo can enjoy a holiday drink and make it whenever I want!
Just wandering...\nIF its hot outside AND we really need to try this, can't we refrigerate it for couple of hours and enjoy as a cold drink... 🤗
You just meshed my two favorite drinks together. God bless your soul!  I have to try this.
This looks so good! 😍 I live in Texas and it's still in the high 80's here - can't wait until it gets cold so I can make this for my family and I!
What type of alcohol would be good with it?
Looks lush burn in not too sure off the flavour with pumpkin as we don't use it for desserts in England
I couldn’t find the recipe :(
@Laurainthekitchen where did you buy these mugs
Omg your so nice and sweet and your foods/drinks look AMAZING
Looks so good!! I can't wait to make this
Can't get any whiter than this
This looks so good
Could this be made with lower fat milk and still be good?
I’ll make it with one espresso shot 😍
I can’t wait to make this around Christmas time during the cold nights.
Yes!!! It's fall!!!!🍁🍂🍁🍂
I have got to make this for my autumn family gatherings🌿🍁😋Looks so good!

This looks delicious omg
Very nice Laura.\n..i love ur recipes
Vorrei provare a fare questa ottima cioccolata calda, ma da noi manca pumpkin pie spice. Laura, qualche suggerimento, please?
What is the spice she is adding? I feel that is a very important ingredient and I have never heard about it. I live in Singapore and I see this Latte on and off the Starbucks menu, but I am unaware of this spice.
For the past three videos shez wearing the same clothes
What booze could you add to it?
I can no longer resist the pizza. I open the box and unzip my pants, allowing my pulsating member to eagerly burst free. As I penetrate the steaming, gooey cheese, a shuddering moan of ecstasy breaks through my drooling lips. The mushrooms and Italian sausage are delightfully rough, and the warm sauce feels like heaven. I blow my load in mere seconds, just in time to slip out the front door as you step out of the bathroom. You never discover why that pizza tasted so much better than all the others.
Every white girl's dream. You have done it again Laura.👌🏼🙌🏼
anyone else wanting to drink this off her breasts? or just me
Closing in on 1 MILLION subscribers!  Thanks for watching!!\nSupport this weeks charity - https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/mexico-earthquake-relief-fund/\n\nStart Halloween right, come see Nostalgia Critic's new review of IT (2017) on the big screen with cast and crew!\nOct 4th It Review Screening - https://theawesomestore.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=29998\nOct 5th It Review Screening - https://theawesomestore.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=29999
With the deadpool skit I thought he was saying deadpool wasn't funny and I was kinda angry
18:17 Did I just see the Nostalgia Critic disappear and get replaced with a completely different person? How did he do that?
Theres still Green Lantern Corp or they can redue the 1st with Emerald Dawn.
I still hate how awkward and stilted the new intro is.
The deadpool stuff wasnt funny. Now of course, thats the point, but saing it isnt funny doesnt solve the fact that it isnt funny and makes this a very annoying review that is hard to watch.
This film doesn't deserve Mark Strong's efforts.
Cosplay Deadpool is Comic-con's It's just a prank, bro guy.
I love Hyper Fangirl and Devil Boner, and I also love how protective Critic got of Hyper
To be honest, I thought Deadpool was ok. Not great, just ok. I barely remember the plot, what was it about again? I know that metal X-Man was in it and some other X-Men I can't remember right now but I cannot remember the plot for the life of me.
At least Reynolds is hot.
When i first saw him, i thought: Sunburnt Vulcun
I liked the jab at the hipsters who love Deadpool, but have no idea what the character is supposed to be.
I like Ryan Reynolds as deadpool better.
I ship hyper fan girl and devil boner
The only 2 things I had remembered from the intro were black willy wonka and NC with his gun
The only thing that would make these reviews better is to NOT include the cringy none funny skits in between sit you say. It isn't funny and I seriously can't believe people enjoy that part..its pure cringe.  You're way more funny  not scripted
Well critic she could of not get a good look at Hal at the party so if you think about it learning te identity during the second encounter is a record for superhero movies
Usually tv shows and the movie will show the meme version of deadpool, while the comics show he cares for actual people and give development and make better jokes. He doesn't just swear and then laugh track. The movie showed the character a little bit better. The cartoons of him suck. Also in the comics it's revealed he doesn't like chimichangas, and just likes saying it. Sorry for grammar mistakes.
Fun fact:  Director of 20th century Fox hated the mere mention of a Deadpool movie.   Good thing he got replaced.
Is this game really that bad? I'm going to try it for myself when it comes to PSone Classics. I'm sure its no Crash Bandicoot but the graphics look about as good as Croc: Legend of the Gobbos at least.
What time are you releasing the IT review
God...how did your channel take such a fucking nosedive in terms of quality? How did this happen? Your friends showing up only makes them even WORSE, and those God awful crossovers you do? I can see they only exist to cover up for a faulty video. These incredibly noticeable pauses you take after 'JOKES' is cringe inducing, have you turned in to a fucking SITCOM or somrthing? YOu suck, NC...you just suck... \n\nYou have been incredibly disappointing for the past couple years, Doug...I'm sorry to say...your content and humor has gone off the deep end. And really? Nobody cares to get your autograph, you are not some legend, okay? At least...not anymore...\n\nI like your Sibling Rivalry though...
Shatner and Malkovich in one character. Wow, that's actually quite perfect.
so this is why you don,t make the super suit green or animated
I'd get MacDonald's with Supes...Or Lois.
it's almost like quality comedy writing requires talent...
Maybe it's just me but the last three or four reviews seem terribly boring. Maybe it's because they are focusing all their efforts on the IT review or because the movies are just so bland. Oh well. At least Devilboner and Hyper are happy.
Am I the only one who said Ding like cinema sins when he said Guardians of the Universe
What is the name of that apple jacks song
Why would I pay 20 dollars to see Doug's review of IT when I can pay (about) 15 dollars to see IT?
I feel kind of bad for Malcolm...
Wait is that... TAIKA WAITITI??!?! DIRECTOR OF THOR RAGNAROK?!?! DAMMIT! Missed oppunrtunity for a taking notes on how not to direct a superhero movie joke.
I'm not sure why they didn't think the comic design of Parallax would work on film. Or maybe the head in a cloud was just cheaper to animate. Hammond seem pointlessly forced into the film. I don't think his transformation has anything to do with Parallax in the comics.
Even w/o this movie the lanterns always seemed useless to me, and far too reliant on Earths green lantern. Kinda ironic considering how powerful they are supposed to be
That lovely over used dead parent(s) DC background story. :^)\n\nAlso I heard the new Green Lantern film will have Ice Cube as John Stewart. What a time to be alive!!
Oh god. Blake lively. I can watch this..
18:04 Honestly, it is a funny line. They should have saved it for a different superhero movie.
Have you ever considered doing the barbie movies? Maybe make it a month or something? I'd really love to see yall making fun of them lol i grew up with them but i gotta admit their quality is shit
you should review the land before time series
Seriously Critic, you should've gotten AnimatedJames to be Deadpool in this. He was practically Deadpool' twin when he did a live reaction of EG: Legend of Everfree.
Wait, is the professor played by Stan from the original IT?
I havent seen this film but it was pretty strange to listen to you critisise the CGI when it actually looks pretty high-budget and realistic.
I think Nostalgia Critic hit on why Deadpool can only ever be on the sideshow
Man, it would be awesome to see it. but you know,  Brazil to LA is a big distance ):
I like how they make fun of the dead pool movie.
Green lantern and use your willpower\n\n\nor black lantern and bring back dead Batman
Green Lantern movie is a pile of shit! 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
I wonder if you guys will ever make a 1987 transformers movie vid I would love it but I doubt it will happen
HEy NOSTALGIA CRITIC. WHY do the parodist Deadpool say the same jokes as Deadpool, but they look like a stupit gyes? why? WHY? WHY? Because Deadpool's film is bad and stupid.
That feel when you think of a movie as somewhat recent, then it comes on a Nostalgia channel.
Do a wrong turn review
18:18 who the hell was that?
A friend of mine is a huge fan of Green Lantern so when he heard this movie was coming out he wouldn't stop taking about, after he saw it he never talked about it again. Also congrats Devil Boner and Hyper Fan Girl.
try Green Lantern: Emerald Knights is bettter that this movie
Hopefully they will reboot green lantern and do it better.
Gosh I love the Back to The Future joke
It's weird hearing my name said so much while watching a video.
Malcolm makes even THAT costume sexy as hell!\n\nI 3 you, Malcolm!
If there's a movie I can forgive, then it would be this. Ryan saved it. I wish he'd reprise his role.
Go to google and type: *gexxguides* You'll get the only real working clash of clans working method in 2017
Go to google and simply type: *gexxguides* You'll get the only working clash of clans working tool in 2017
Hey Nostalgia critic after you review IT you should review Scott pilgrim
Official. I'm shipping Devil Boner and Hyper, WHO ELSE?!
If i lived in usa i would go, im sad now
When is the it review going to be released on youtube?
PLEEEAAAASE DO MARMADUKE CAUSE THAT SHIT WAS SO BAD!!!!!
The green lantern movie was not half bad
So....are those tickets gonna be physical or emailed? Cause I'm still waiting either way
2011 called and said it wants it's easy target back.
God this guy is awful. Trying so hard to be funny but coming off obnoxious instead.
It would've been hilarious if that was actually Ryan Reynolds
I don't know who has the biggest forehead, The New Pennywise or The Main Villain of this movie?
Channel Awesome please  do a review on the new IT movie i have watched IT and I think it would make for some great fun on the channel and is a big step up from the last movie incarnatian we got please do IT on the channel\n\nlike if you agree please and thank you
Please do Looney Tunes: Back In Action.\nA film that had positive reviews but was a box office flop
Nostalgia Critic, wanna crossover on a review of Scooby Doo And The Ghoul School
GEOFFREY RUSH IS IN THIS MOVIE?!?!
Congrats on trending
The IT crowd reference!
That ending with devil boner and hyper fan girl was strangely cute.\nI loved it.
Every comic/anime con rendition of deadpool
I liked green lantern.
To quote Nash How do you screw up a concept as simple as Green Lantern? That's like screwing up digesting Jell-o!
review the new power rangers movie
Allison shits on Phelan's chest.
Megatrons schlong mMmMMmmMMmMMmM

Green lantern >>> mcu
Taika Waititi deserved better than this
Dat IT clown dance
3:18 Holy crap. Obi Wan Kenobi???
Do emoji movie
Dude, why is it that the NC feels like he needs to include something anoying in every review lately? Deadpool not being funny? guess what, IT'S NOT FUCKING FUNNY! IT'S CRINGY AS FUCK
Ugggh. Why is a movie based on character who uses BRIGHT AND COLORFUL LIGHT CONSTRUCTS TO FIGHT so goddamn dark and murky?? \n\nGL deserves way better.
Once a wildcat, always a wildcat

zacalicious! i can't even !! why does he have to be so handsome ....
He's so damn beautiful
This might be the fakest corniest most obvious google ad combined with obvious script and unnatural cool acting ive ever seen someone seriously put out into public. who is the interviewer suppost to be a robot in some parallel universe where zac efron is king of the world and the coolest person to ever exist. Hes an actor and exceptionally attractive but damn dude youre not God calm down. why are you so obsessed with how cool you come across that you cant just act natural. And vogue why cant you have a real interview without scripting and choreographing every single action. And google why do you suck at coming up with product placement ideas. I feel so embarrassed for every employed adult that thought this was a good idea for their business.
Loved!... It was the most relaxed and so real...
ZACKALISHOUS!!!\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS\n#ZACKALISHOUS

I used to copy this guy so much. I even share the same birthday as his lol. Now I'm in my mid 20s and have my own personality but being his fan was pretty good for me and helped me do things that i didn't have motivation for like working out. But I'm amazed by how he's still got his cool, time for me to take another advice from him patience.

I wanted to see more! I wish this interview was longer!
I have no issues with anybody other than the devil. That's the only person I'm fighting with every day.
This was a refreshing interview!!!.....Tamar has grown for the better and Wendy genuinely likes her....this was nice to watch!!....Good job ladies
Love these two together
THAT'S SO SAD TONI BRAXTON IS WITH A WELL KNOW HOMOSEXUAL AND LUMINADI DEVIL WORSHIPPER.
sisters supporting each other :) i'm here for it
I aint got no issues.. But with the devil.. Thats my new saying
I love her, you can't hide or damage a personality like that, on the real if you disagree and feel different about a topic it's a person right to speak on it, I only watch you tube clips of the real barely that 3out of the 4 women are shady shame on them and production company
I get a vibe these two are f!ckin something is always happening to Vince damn,dude has how many lives left ... She looks good here.... her personality is too much for me maybe if I drank and throw shade 24/7 we could be besties......
TayTay might be the only person on Earth that Wendell ain't shading 24/7!!!!😘😘
Tamar has really grown! I'm super proud of her she stayed true to herself but she definitely has evolved!
Dang I miss Tamar
Tamar
She is so full of life and looking super cute!!
At 6:00 mark when she talked about Monica. I died laughing when she said Monica blocked her. Tamar faces and voice be having me dying. She is so entertaining. She should have her own show. If The Real was smart they would hire her back. She’s so good for TV.... Tamar should be a part housewife on RHOA. Now that would be good 🙌🏽
You can really see she and Wendy's friendship shine through the interview. Love it!
I would have fainted if I saw Tamar!! Love,love,love her!!!!! Tamartian for life!!!!!
Make $$$ LEGIT EXTRA income ABSOLUTELY NO 🚫 start up cost .\n                        VISIT:\nhttp://ThePayz.com/?refer=23022
Wendy is looking good  here
IS everybody going blonde?!! Let me break out my blonde afro wig!
She looks like she had fillers in her face and lip injections
What show is she talking about is she talking about the real
We love you Tamar...you're a wonderful person
Tamar needs her own show she just needs to find a team who’ll be able to deal with her big personality
IM HERE FOR IT
She give me life, but why did my queen went and got botox on her cheeks though?
She's a pretty lady, of course, but why does she look like she wrapped in aluminum foil?
See the difference when you're genuine friends. I can see that between those two. Tamar's talk show will definitely give Wendy a run for her money.
Tamar may be extra, but I can definitely relate to her on her quest for happiness and doing what's right for her and her family. Also, there is no denying her talent, Tamar is amazing.
I don't care what anyone says about her that woman is funny & real af! I love her. And I love ppl who speak their minds which is probably why I love Cardi B as well. 😂
Tamar has grown!! Proud of her
😍😍😍
It's a nice video. But you can refer to the secret How To Fix a Marriage and Make Your Spouse Adore You Again in this link: http://bit.ly/2vNBJSw
Look at My Tay 😁 Love her!!!
She really just motivated me 🙌🏾
This interview was magnificent!!
Tamar I love your outfit! I can see you have matured a lot.
Social media is so messy!\n\nAlso, I didn't  understand Tamar's response when Wendy asked if what she had on her album cover was a body suit. Did Tamar say yes
She's doing that lil kim proud by looking more modified every time she appears
i luv tay , i feel like i havent seeb her n so long tho because the show got cut off n the new season hasnt been on youtube 😤 i can tell wendy genuinely likes tamar n its gd, because we can c it .
I love interviews where the guest can ACTUALLY TALK!
Tamar!!! I love her! She seems so genuine and down to earth!!
I absolutely love this interview. I love to see black women talking about their vulnerability and issues of depression. Yes, we're strong like most women. But I hate the rhetoric of that's all we are. Believe it or not we often find ourselves feeling weak, vulnerable, sad, sensitive, calm, and so much more. These emotions are not relegated to a few. We all go through so much and seeing someone that looks like me reaffirming these emotions, that I too find myself going through, makes me feel that I'm not alone. Thx Tamar.
Tamar is my spirit angel
Lord bless you and your family Tamar B.
Ugly as fuk...both of these dykes
Why is Tamar not one of the judges on American Idol?She should be getting the 25 million dollars and not katie
Tamar gave the BEST interview so far this season and we're just getting started, Wendy!!! Thumbs up for Tamar getting her own show!!! 👍🏾
Tamar is a true Pisces!
Love her!! What a great personality and Skin ahaha <3 Love you tay tay
I see a lot of growth and change in her and it's for the better. You can tell she's following god. I will say you can tell she had some work done.
She’s such a real person! Go Tamar!
Wendy looks good here hair and makeup
She seems like a lot of fun
LOVE HER!
Tamar's such a real sweetheart, I admire her humor and attitude towards life and family.
So its okay for Tamar to play childish games ? Aint nobody pressed for Tamar but Tamar. Real talk she can sing but she will neva be a superstar; #FACTS                 i
Please Tamar bring your tv show back
Two of my favourite personalities..... I love these women
The real isn't the same without Tamar
yuk on birdman though and i mean YUK!!!!
She seems so genuine. A lot of times celebs beat around the bush when interviewed. She came 100% ready and real. Love her and her family
Can anyone tell me the brand of Wendy Williams’ shirt?!
i do NOT believe Tamar about the tapping spirit giiiirl really? Vince did it?...Mkay tay tay
She looks so cute,love this interview so different from other😚😍
Every time she talks about Toni and Birdman it's funny
This was a great interview! I love this new Tamar...happy for her!
Tamar looks so good without make up
Yass, some banging singles will do well!! Good choice TAY-TAY!!!
Wendy genuinely likes Tamar she's respectful to her... unlike her unusual disrespectful self
she said Brrrrrr Man😂😂\nI love you TayTay
I like this Tamar Braxton better than the over the top get your life Tamar.
My breasts are still mine so lets embrace them... for now. She's pregnant.
She would be a great motivational speaker. Just need to focus.
7:30 The nostalgia hit hard. I love the Muppets!
Tamar is so beautiful

I love Tamar! She's always kept it real, one hun! I'm so glad I watched her to derived my own opinions about her!
My god I just want to hang out with her!

Wow she looks amazing!!!!😘😘😘💕
Tamar need to understand that unfollowing and unfriending others on social media speaks volumes nowadays. Totally understand why Monica decided to one-up her and block her.
Not their real hairs not their real noses! LOL
Its funny how it perfectly fits on his trunk
So they are using kids now...
I like how he drove by the first time casually to scope the place out.
Cops later pepper sprayed and tazed this kid.
That did fit so perfectly in the back of his car, i would forgive because of that reason alone.
not cool.
Hilarious!

to be honest i'd be happier that my neighbour is holding my package for me than having it left out like that!\nwhere i live it'd be gone within minutes!\n\nif i saw a package abandoned on my neighbours driveway i'd probably take it in too, \nand post something through their letter box letting em know i have it :P
the parents probably told him to do it , goes on alot .
It annoys me more that the kid is driving all through the neighborhood yards. Wtf is up with this kids parents?

Funny... if we are to believe that's the neighbor's kid.  I think it's your kid and he's just driving it over to the garage and bringing it inside.
well if the glove fits
I hope this kid has been slapped!\nEvery kid can do stupid things, that's not the problem, but parents should make it very clear that he CAN'T do it again!

If you want a good show with hot boys in leather BBC The Musketeers.
It really showed you both would be awesome if you had an indie film. Road trip film for the summer maybe? Everything you do is GOLD... at least... & Platinum.
Hey I'm new to your channel this is my first Video I've ever watched. Keep up the entertainment. By the way is two trans?
Who else thought of the kpop groups when they said one piece and two piece
I was waiting for Mitch to say and my name is Two Piece and A Biscuit.
I love Mitch's Freddie Mercury look!!
Omg\n Mitch's favourite song is the same as mine!!!
Hi! I'm from Poland.
Mitch watching True Blood is all I need.
Lol she said my name. 😂
THE GOOD PLACE  THATS WHERE I KNEW HER FROM
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
i'll never be over you two. y'all are so incredible :)
Now do you have a BEARD Mitch?!! Oh and BTW there's this app called Flipagram and I believe you shall get a account of flipagram!
Im really confused. Are these the same guys as asapscience?
i was hoping for Deny U music video this friday
Mitch. Bring the septum piercing back and throw the porn stach out! 😂
Mitch looks different everytime I see him 😂😍
4:18-4:33 what every scomiche shipper thinks. She knows what's good!!
Mitch what the fuck is up w ur hair and facial hair.
at first I didn't like Mitch's mustache, but then I started watching Parks and Rec
She is HILARIOUS in The Good Place.
I love the most is they always put their weekly obsession and also their week songs they love ! I mean I wish all YouTubers would do that !
I just watched their first videos and I'm literally crying I'm so proud of y'all ❤️
It feels like forever since the last time you’s sat in front of the camera 😂❤️
when Hoying said One Piece i literally thought he meant the anime
I laughed so hard through all of this
Aaaaaa congrats guys! You guys are killing it, keep up the amazing work!
Why do they both look so sexy rn
Every time I come back to this channel, Matts image is always different
THE 'STACHE IS TOTALLY WORKING
I'm such a fucking weeb, when Scott said one piece I immediately thought Mitch was gonna reply with a one piece character goodness me
If y'all don't make a Guy.exe video that's basically a Weird Science parody, it's going to be a real missed opportunity.
Post Malone wrote I Fall Apart because Mitch forgot about him.
Is it just me or is Mitch copying Scotts facial hair? Either way, keep it up Queens! ❤️👑👑❤️
How ironic is this, I missed a superfruit notification, because I was doing a superfruit binge 😭😂😂😂❤️❤️
The album is amazing! Congratulations ❤️
i was hoping the names would be like \n“my name is horse”\n“my name is cowboy and i’m gonna ride you”
You're trending on YT and Im a proud momma!
DOES SCOTT GOT A NEW TATTOO?????
React to In a heartbeat!!! (Short film) I’ve been watching videos like crazy and I came to see if y’all did one.
i would like to just watch you guys kiss\n\nWOULDNT WE ALL
It is so strange to watch Mitch reaching high notes with this mustache
Pentatonix are makeking a breaking up Super Fruit? I dont know I writed right, because I am brasilian. Sorry. :(. I love uuuuu
4:18 If that isn't me..
That awkward moment when you realize that you're watching this on a Tuesday
Hurry up and make an album with Mars Argo
What are you gonna do with all this ass😂😂

here is a link to my interview with Jason Andrade of West Coast Sustainables: https://youtu.be/UosRyvIO5b0
Great informative video!
Awesome job brother
great ryobi advert
really nice workshop!!
Gorgeous!
Nice job
Awesome!
Are you partnered with Ryobi
$$
Sweet!!!
Step 1: be overpaid
amazing
where you buy chickens?
any project is cheap when a great deal of the contents are sponsored give-outs
how much total cost
Nice work!
That was dope
Awesome work...
Very cool bro, nice work 🤐
*Awesome build!*
Incredible!! Great job!!
Great job 👍
Love it
White toolchests are for posers.
Not insulated?
👍
cool!
good job
Awesome
Awesome build!
Great presentation,
Bloody awesome
So-- when is your next book coming out?
Pretty cool, but making an all white shed is going to be a nightmare to keep clean looking.
cool idea especially because I'm ordering a 10x12 tuff shed for my new house... but it was kind of annoying after I realized this was actually just one big commercial for all the tools and appliances... 1k for the solar set up? I'm sure you could find quality components for half as much.. other than that, good ideas!
This was a great video! Most entertaining I've watched in a while. Great design, and love that Husky was cool enough to let you paint thier product white. It was a nice touch
Where did you get that white pendant light shade?
That's one small band saw.
I want to pay this guy to make my dream workshop
Why have an earth rod if the mains isn't technically referenced to earth at all?
Love your chickens how they are so interested in what your doing, guessing you had to put them up. When I was smoothing out the ground to lay a floor for a dog kennel, mine would help undo everything I did.
Amazing Build! I have been looking for the solar idea. Thank you!
I'll take two please
Great video ... but is this sponsored by Ryobi or you're just a fan?
Pretty cool. I think the rattle can business won't hold up too long, but it's an easy way (in white) to create a seemingly large open space. I'm uneducated in using solar as a stand alone electrical source, but what struck me as REALLY odd was the forktruck? batteries sealed up in the power source configuration.
Do you actually plan to use that shed or just admire it?
Nice work. You should pour concrete ramps. Takes about 2-3 60lb bags and will last forever. Just don't let the wood of the shed touch the concrete or you may have rot. Either way very nice shop shed.
Nice job and good tips, thanks!
This is Awesome! Great Job 👍
what battery type you use?
What was the overall cost of the workshop?
Have you ever build an art office outside and can endure winter weather.
Everybody is complaining that it's sponsored...but you have an intro card that says it is...Thanks for the video I'm going to look into that slat wall for my garage looks pretty cool.
Just remember it'll never be that clean again
No isolation.   I built one 12x16 but I insulated it with r13
Amazing! Now you just have to convince my wife to let me do this... and get chickens.
This is really cool ^.^
*grumbles* should've blasted some spray foam all over the inside
Damn everything is white. That would suck to get dirty or greasy
Testing the bench tools without any load is not a valid test. They will draw more current when a load is applied, as in when you try to use them.
How much did this cost?
The inside of that is as white as woahvicky
Its amazing congratulations. i wonder if i can build exactly the same project here in chile
I'd love to see it at night!
You talk so slow, but the video is so fast, it makes me feel wired
This was so cool! I love the clean, and very open looking finish! 💖
Looks like you had it assembled in a shady spot........
Didn't like how the gardening tools was left hanging outside, otherwise great video!
Oh, I am LOVING this setup! it's just the kind of thing I want to do when I get my house next year. \n\nQuestion: how difficult would it be to duplicate the solar aspect for the garage? I would want to run an electric air compressor, the garage door opener(s), LED lighting, an electric power washer and rechargers for automotive power tools. Thanks, love the channel!
NiCe enough to be a room haha I'd sleep there
Super cool project! Wish you were my best friend and could show me how to do this! Thanks for sharing via video!!
Add a grid tie if possible as most of the day time solar is wasted. Lead acid battles are great in the shed but really bad for night time home use because they are not designed to be left overnight in a discharged state.
However if you want to do some milling you would need a more powerful array and foundation
How much money cost for all that work ?
I would like to see some discussion (and possible modifications in the future) regarding Winter-proofing or alternative heat sources. Traditionally folks used to just shove in 'ye ol space heater' in their work shops, but not only is the demand on electricity high, but the efficiency is very low. I would like to see (or at least discuss) a clever heating/winter-proofing solution. Thank you.
this looks awesome, if only tuff sheds ship to Australia
Your friend is HOT!
Very good idea and good video. I like it.
what was the total cost for this project?
cost of entire project?  Without a sponsor?
Great video ! Really gave me more umph to finish my work shop with the solar I started with!
Wow that was great
Looks really nice! But too much white for my likings :/
No isolation for the cold Days ?!?
Perhaps it's my extreme climate, but why would you not use any insulation?
I want one as a little private area
Super Job!!! I don't know where you live, but maybe the only change is adding  some type of insulation to the walls and ceilings.  \nAlso, if you haven't call Ryobi you should.  They would love to feature your build(s) with their tools and maybe throw some dollars your way as and advertiser.  Mark in Florida.
How many advertisements can you fit in one video?
Looks like you won‘t ever build sth dirty in there 🤔
did anyone else cringe when he spray painted the tool boxes?
Excellent-what homeless people should be doing.
Wondering how much the total project cost?
This is truly incredible
This thing is amazing!  Loved hearing the progress on the Modern Maker Podcast...this really makes me want to get into solar!
Very nicely done while I don't have much experience with you choice if brand names (probably sponser) the concept is completely cool to make it off grid and great use of space.
great build! I'm impressed. I love the solar powered system and how easy you explained the build. excellent video!
I'd say a line at the bottom of your video description saying the video is sponsored is really shitty. That stuff should be mentioned at the start of the video. Good video apart from the scripted parts home depot sent you.
what does Ryobi's dick taste like?
The circuit breakers you used between the charge controller and the battery look a lot like AC breakers, are these in fact DC breakers and if so what brand are they and where did you source them?
An early lesson in expectations.
Woah did she just assume the gender of that unborn baby?
*British crying*
but there are 76 genders, how do you know its a boy
Sexist bitch
Comment section these days is cancer! Such negativity on a little girl? see how cute and innocent she is. 💕
Talk about a perfect accidental commentary on modern day society.
I thought this was very cute until I realized that his is her typical behavior she has adapted to, in order to earn blue sweeties. =(
1:12\n\npragmatism at it's best LOL 😆😆
Don't feed her too many candies.
Cuteness overload! God bless you all!
dont tell her the gender!\nbabies, girls and boys, all look the same!\nthe sex doesnt begin to matter until way after 2 when boys start playing rough.
I can't believe how people can be so nasty. She's just a toddler, stop attacking the child. This says much more about how disgusting being you all are.
Fuck, people dumb enough to still film vertically squeezing more out.
Different but I remember acting the same way. lol

Well all I'm gonna say is this isn't really that cute at all. Any child of this age that I know who's found out the sex of their baby siblings never cried over wanting a sibling of the same gender. I never did either. Looks to me this girl seems quite spoilt. Of course she's just a kid at the end of the day though, and I'm pretty certain she'll love her little brother once he arrives.
Waaaay tooo many disgusting people here in the coments. You should feel ashamed!
No offense but she is rude I love my baby sister to bits yes I was expecting a brother but so what about gender she is cute no matter what that girl is spoilt mum needs tell her that her brother will be sad if she dont love him! Rude child. Idc if shes 3 she should know
so funny when grownup neo-feminists act like exactly the same way sometimes
I agree with this little girl 100%.   It is a completely valid opinion.
lol stupid children
my little too when she he a him.
Fake tears, the parents have taught her to be this way through poor reinforcement. She cries, then gets rewarded with candy. Unsurprisingly, her tears end immediately.
He\n He\n  He\nShe's funny.
Siobhan, turn off the comments. They're saying awful things about your children. Just turn them off!
Start saving and you can pay for his surgery, little girl.
This wouldn't happen in China. It would be more like Good news! We're having a boy so we don't have to infanticide your new sibling like we almost did with you.
you know what this video really means. the boys are her school are not very nice to her
So sweet! saw her on the Wendy Williams Show!Adorableness
That boy is going to be tortured for at least the first 10 years of his life.
I had a british older sister, she was mean and didn't want me either lmao
It boggles my mind why parents like this are so eager to share their shitty parenting with the rest of the world.
I wouldn't leave her alone in the room with the new baby, just sayin
Hi Siobhan I work for @DailyBlasLive! We would love to use this adorable video please email me at alexie.pincus@dailyblastlive.com
Hopefully her brother realizes he is a she and gets HRT therapy before she can walk.
hehe
Good luck with all that, little guy.
Adorable!
Spoiled!
that is one ugly kid
Guuuuul

Rémes ez a gyerek még szerencse,hogy a következő fiú talán az nem lesz ilyen hisztis...
Feminism already corrupting the youth smh tbh fam
My parents did the same thing when my sister was going to be born. I still wish she was a boy...
Tell her the baby boy is trans and can dress her up like a girl.
She needs to step away from the Pop Tarts from time to time, methinks.
Your kid is dumb
Brat
I know this is British, but can any of you Brits tell me what area this accent is attributed to?
I came for the comments and I am not disappointed.
get rid of the little cunt, i mean the alive one BTW
making the sex of an unborn crucial\nvertical video\nboy's and girl's color\nbribing with sweets
I'd grab that little fucker and shake her violently. Then sell her to my friend Jeremy Epstein. John Posestda will pay top dollar too
Cheer up, little one! These days, newborns get to choose their gender! So, they just might end up being a girl after all!\nHopefully your tax funded public school administration will get the gender situation sorted out early on by Pre-K! Good luck!
Beggars can’t be choosers
What a brat. You can tell the kid uses crying to get what she wants. And these parents videotape as if it's amusing. Just wait 10 years.
just cut off his penis
dumb cunt dont sideways film u dumb whore and beat ur ugly ass kid. dont ever let them talk back like its nothing dumb whore
fucking annoying little kid
www.reddit.com sent me here and oh my god im glad i dont have a fuckin annoying girl like that as my kid the parents are obviously pussy liberals for letting this happen my sister would have never acted like that because my parents believed in spanking not being a pussy parent who gives trophys for everything
THAT LITTLE GIRL IS JUST LIKE THE REDDIT COMMUNITY, CRYING OVER SOME STUPID SHIT, AND UPSET THAT THEY CANT GET THEIR WAY. POOR BABIES
I really felt her pain; that was so sad :(  Saddest thing ever.  never watching this type of stuff again its horrible.
You gotta show this on her wedding day..

I specialize in making and showing how to lay wigs down to look natural. You shouldn’t have to pull any of your natural hair out while wearing Freedom wigs. And also make sure there is a elastic band sewn in so it for snug to the head. Lastly do two braids to the back of your head and pin them. And if you use stocking cap pull it back away from hairline so you don’t see it in the front. Hope this helps ladies. Also here is my video 😉 https://youtu.be/8BzfjSc1RNs
Didn't know white women wore lacefront wigs

You need wig glue :)
That was Horrible! ! Hahaha
you guys should collab more

Pia looks like jhene aiko here
chloe you are sooooooo pretty

Yes I'm so happy, I love pia!!!!! :)

Chloe is so beautiful omg💓
As a black woman who occasionally wears lace front wigs, I agree - when I watched tutorials as a beginner, I realized there are SO MANY STEPS MISSING!! And omg she really used double-sided tape lmbooo poor thing, I'm dying!! lol I recommend getting some wig glue or toupee tape instead of regular double-sided tape (which will shine through). Also, for people with fair skin the lace should be bleached, so it's transparent. The lace on these wigs was like, light brown/tan lol tooo visible for their skin tone... hope it works out better next time :)
😂😂😂😂 and they  1500 each
This is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
Really helpful!!!! https://youtu.be/dNR6Aj9O_ks
You didn’t put it on right but u did u just missed it a bit
Chloeeeee you look like Kendall jennerrrrr
OMG I can't believe you paid that much without properly trimming the mesh!  You need a different tutorial ladies.
You look like Kendall Jenner
Use Bobby pins for the sides but other then that looks good keep on trying 😄
hahah... you should trim first! much easier :)  you guys look great!
Makeup is on point Chloe!!! Tutorial pleaseeee ❤️❤️❤️
It's better brown on pia
It takes practice just like everything else in life. I think you both look awesome and can master the wigs.
I love how you just casually got freedom couture wigs, I'd give an arm for one, losing all my hair :(
I cant believe they wasted 1500 dollars just to fuck it up.
Chloe -- do a video using only products that don't test on animals please.  It would be such a great boost for these companies and you don't have to put down any other company -- just highlight the ones that don't test. Thanks! <3
Chloe check out this youtuber's tutorial on wig application\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDLCu-8DXsE
I've been married 16 years. I have a pretty good wife though we've had our problems. Here's why I don't recommend marriage for unmarried men now:\nFirst, the stakes are incredibly high. The risk of failure is too high, unacceptably high. The odds of finding a suitable partner who can and will actually be in it for the long haul are too low.\n\nSecond, marriage for a man means mostly taking on duties and obligations. The offer was sweetened because in exchange for his taking on those obligations, the prospective husband was traditionally promised one real, valuable benefit: Good, regular sex at reasonable intervals with a reasonably attractive women, all with a minimum of effort. But even that's not guaranteed now because many wives do not consider they have any obligation to have sex with their husbands and feel justified in withholding sex for the flimsiest of reasons or no reason at all. And besides, a man who wants sex in this time need not marry to get it. All he needs is either (1) minimal game competence; or (2) money for prostitutes.\n\nSo, if he can't even get some minimal guarantee of the one benefit he's supposed to get out of the deal, why should he even try to make the deal in the first place?\n\nSorry this betrays some of my Christian beliefs. I'm just stating realities on the ground.\n\nWhile women certainly do have feelings, and they sometimes use the word 'love' to describe it- It depends on how we define love.... is it a passionate moment of powerful feeling... or is it a lifetime of commitment and sacrifice?
Oh Chloe! Jackie Aina has a wonderful video on this: https://youtu.be/uDLCu-8DXsE
the pieces near your ears that you were struggling with, i've seen people use double sided tape on their face and like stick it down and it works and also gives you a nice little face lift
ur supposed to cut the lace around wig
I've seen great tutorials from black women who basically wear wigs 24/7 and they glue the lace to their own hairline and it looks flawless.
She looks like the chick from Glee.  Santana.
those wigs would look so good if u knew how to properly wear then 😭😭
The girl with the blonde hair looks like jhene aiko. The other one looks like Kendall Jenner.
There are so insanely amazing wigs out there! Look up Diniwigs online or insta!
Tip! If you plan on wearing the wig with the cap try picking up a dark coloured wig cap so it doesn't show through the wig! Light coloured caps work better with light coloured wigs so it doesn't look like weird patches :) also netted caps are a lot more comfy than stocking caps!
You are so funny
Holy shit, you spent $3000 on wigs she will never wear. Crazy!
you also have to put make underneath the lace in order to make it more like scalp jajaja its also called bleaching the knots or hiding the knotsss
From far away and on their Instagram account they made it look so easy and so pretty and natural af but in real life you can see everything
How you cut and apply a wig depends on what you’re wearing it for. For everyday kind of use, you just trim back the lace as close to the baby hairs as you can. You secure the wig down by having a wig cap on, and using bobby pins to secure it in place. Under the wig cap you can do multiple things. You can do a wrap, you can do pin curls, you can do anything that holds the hair flat and gives your natural hair some shape or texture for the pins you put through the wig to grip on to. For stage, you’d leave the lace long (with repeated use the lace gets shitty and you have to trim it back. Eventually you run out of lace and you have to get it replaced) and use adhesive to stick the lace down around the face. Never put adhesive in the hair because that just ruins it. Sometimes the wigs natural hairline doesn’t match your own so you just kind of have to fiddle with it and find a way to disguise any lace that stands out. You can use makeup to cover it too
I can spend 20 on a lace front and it would look 10x better , why are they so expensive ?
You should try the schwarzkopf got2b glued blasting freeze spray it will hold the lace in place and make it look natural
Those wigs honestly look janky for $1500... I have seen $500 wigs that looked much better... As someone who is pretty comfortable with wigs I am literally dying watching this video, the two of you are adorable.
they struggling
Please do another one PLZZZ
Want a wig now lol 😂💞
https://youtu.be/dNR6Aj9O_ks
You look like belle with the wig clipped back
can you please give it to me
Did anyone else get distracted by Pia's biceps?! GURL you are my inspo!!
You can get the same wigs on SassySecret.com for a 1/3 of the price
To ware a wig you should shave you head smooth to ware a wig .Otherwise if got hair leave a loan.say no to wigs .
It actually looks terrible I think these are the worst wigs I've seen 😮
This was so entertaining 😂\nJust use clip extensions. Haha
It's cute that you guys don't know about wigs. Tip: please don't use that tape. It will pull your hairline out. Put the wig slightly behind your hairline and bobby pin the sides.
as a every day wig user this is a huge fail to me but it totally shows that just buying an expensive wig doesn't mean it will look bomb (which is a common mistake ) so thanks
To get rid of the spotty look you have to put powder foundation under the lace to help cancel out the dark lace roots. Try it next time, that should help. Also, you can cut the part around your ear to contour to the natural curve of your head. So don't be afraid to cut some lace and hair around your ears.
What does an Australian accent sound like to an English woman vice versa?
I'm so picky with wigs like I can't stand fake looking ones but the ones I want like these are too expensive
Hey Chloe look up freedom couture hair on YouTube she has heaps of tips and tricks! X
Omggg you turn the wig inside out and put your own power foundation on the lace parts
Check out Blondielocks here on you tube.  She is the best at explaining wigs from what to buy, styling a wig and how to make it look less 'wiggy' looking!!
Pia's arms are ripped !!! I wish mine looked like that.
The struggle is real! :) I totally understand the confusion. I was clueless when I started wearing wigs years ago. I am still trying to master the lace game! :)
What do I do about that?\nYeah, see, idk... \nMMMMMMEEEEE giving advice
Gross waste of money. Why people support this company I'll never know.
Girl just chop all that lace off!!! God I just wanted to jump thru the screen and help!😂 watch Nikita Draguns video on how she applies her wigs! It's bomb 🔥
It is quite dissapointing how noticable the lace is on a freedom couture wig.  I was going to save up money for one but the mesh is very spaced out and seems thick, and for that expensive of a wig, you expect to look more natural and seamless. Ive bought 300 dollar wigs with better up close lace than that.  There are ways around it.  I would look up videos to try and cover the mesh.. some people use got2b glue on the inside of the cap and let it dry to cover it up.  Personally I am a silk top girl and if I dont like the lace on the wig that is touching my scalp I put the wig a bit father back to almost see my hairline and I color it with brown eyeshadow powder.  Hard to explain but it looks a lot more natural.   You should also put Freedom Couture in your title so more people can see it.  I know I am glad to have found your video before purchasing.  Thank you for the honest review.  Your wig is workable though so don't worry!
This is a travesty and money wasted. Way too much spent on wigs you not even wearing.
This is all wrong
ladies if you buy a wig that expensive you need to get one with bleached knots so you cant tell its lace.
You can sew the lace under so you don't have to cut it :)
Lol.. I bought a $1700 wig from freedom couture and didn't even get a wig cap with it. Beauty bloggers getting more treatment? Hm yeah
I ordered one and it didn't fit on my head!! It was so small and they told me it was a large! The company are really vague with details.
If you don't want that wig , I'll take it
Also there are usually clips on the inside to help keep the side down.. but look up  got 2 be glued method
I’m surprised no blow torch was brought out 😂
Chloe, If u hate them, I have alopecia and can only leave my house with a wig on. I will gladly take them off your hands 😬🙏🏻
hey everyone! I just wrote a simple blog post on how to eat organically to lose weight and stay healthy. Please support <3 \nhttps://thehealthynewyorker.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/delicious-organic-healthy-breakfast-ideas/
You guys are both beautiful!!!!
You guys need to join Wig Skaters group on Facebook. $1500 is way to much for a wig
You get your foundation then flip the wigs and place it on the lace. Braid you real hair to lay flat then use gots to be glued to keep the wig Down or you can sew the wig on
I'm a black woman and those wigs looks so natural but 1500 dollars might as well should of tried clip in extensions would of saved some money!!!
I'm a guy and even i found this funny to watch.
Am I the only one that thinks that at some angels Pia looks like Jennifer Lawrence?
بحبك كتير وبعشق فديوهاتك im from syria
Dumb white girls
I think the girl with brown hair could bear me a fine son.
Hahaha loved this! Some people do glue it down :) and makeup would help but cut it where you can still see it! Xx
he's actually like actually singing in his videos, amazing.
Eden....back at it again with the feels. Amazing song!!!
He sounds American when he sings.
oMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!! honestly EDEN is the only band that I can listen to on repeat. I'm in love with this band more then anything and the vocals are amazing. like how can he sing that good?!?!?!\n\nedit: OKAY SO I'M LISTENING TO THIS AGAIN AND IT GOT TO THE ACTUAL SONG AND I'M CRYING OMG OKAY\n\nedit #2: THE BEAT I'M SHOOK.  SOMEONE HELP ME I'M ABOUT TO FLIP RN!!!!!!\n\nedit #3: THIS IS THE LAST ONE, BUT THE LYRICS ARE SO GOOD. THE MUSIC VIDEO IS SO GOOD. AHHHHHHHHHHH. THOSE HIGH NOTES I'M SHOCKED RN
Phenomenal work as always <3 my Hero, EDEN. I’m always excited for what else is to come.
I didn't like it at first but then I watched the video n now I'm legit in love. He's so hot yo
Why can't the entire song be 4:39 to 4:49 and not just a bunch of buildup. Songs like this and pixel empire by madeon would be good if they weren't just buildup. This is relatively disappointing coming from EDEN, a great artist I listen to often. This is sadly going to be his most popular song now even though it is not even that good. And, rock + roll, and end credits are all much better and should be more popular.
It gets even better after 4:20
This song should have been called Depression because he kept saying I tryed to stop it but it won't stop killing you or something like that.
Gorgeous as always.\nYour music always makes my day worth living
always messes with my feels\nbut i like it :)
Great music EDEN! I'm a huge fan and have been for the last three years. Keep up the great work!
This is such a grass-roots EDEN song!
Still waiting for EDEN and Stephen to collab
Fucking love this song so much now.
jon u deserve the world.
i will miss the old type of songs
Hi. Ily. Love me? No? Ok, still love you. Bye.
i ,, hope he's okay, 'cause goddamn, this song almost reads like a suicide note. hope it's just in my head
Somewhere between 50 and 65k views a day man,  I can't wait for a new project from you
I know the good old days that The Eden Project changed his name to EDEN like we all know him for. We were scared that EDEN will change his music style, atleast that's what he said. I was afraid, but also hyped cus eden = eden. Thank god he still makes this kind of music, actually he only does this type of music. And I am grateful, thankful for that. EDEN always knows how to impress us. He'll be huge one day, people will find his music really soon. So damn good, so so so damn good. So good.
IF EDEN AND BLACKBEAR, OR EDEN AND JEREMY ZUCKER  COLLAB I WILL SCREAM
feeling nostalgic as hell and this song made me wanna go climb on my roof in the early morning or go on a hike with my friends
i swear he's so perfect
When are we gonna get a new album!?!
This man is the love of my life dude.  his music gives the feels.
may i just say, jon is gorgeous
Ur A Golden 🌟
I've noticed a certain beautiful thing about the ending which might or might not have been deliberate. There is a certain bird in the sky which keeps on circling around his head while he is waking into the ocean, and the moment the bird goes out of the screen... the song ends. Like....wow.
I'm waiting for this man to be on the radio.
cunt\n\n\n1    :someone who doesn't like EDEN's songs\n2    :someone who doesn't think EDEN is amazing\n3    :ESPECIALLY someone who hates EDEN\n4    :a really annoying person... who doesn't like EDEN
damn jon I thought you were dead
Been here for a while and im proud
His dancing always kills me. It's adorable. Love this song and video ♥️
EDEN Brazil loves you! and me too
these lyrics fuckin hurt a lot 💔 I'm just speechless..
waiting for wake up video
Let's get that 6 figures up in here
Makes me ask so many questions about my past. Feels nice...
I've waited so long for a new song, and I'm glad I did. Cos it's great, i can't even find a good word for it. I just love listening to this song again and again. In the car, when I'm going to bed... Thanks again for this new release Eden ❤
I love it. Like I love every song he makes.
every eden song makes feel like I'm don't even know what love is
Your voice is amazing !!!!!
Something about this music video felt so real, I was mesmerized.
I have waited so long
The beginning is Vertigo I believe. That is pretty cool.
please stay our little secret
143 people obviously have never herd good music before🤷🏻‍♀️
Hey EDEN I'm a huge fan and I was wondering if I could rock+roll or circles in my monthly montage for my overwatch gameplay that I'm gonna launch tomorrow so I'm just checking now If it's ok and I love this song it was worth the wait 😀😀😀
I love all EDEN songs because they're so real and raw with emotion but literally this song with the video made me cry like a little kid. This is fucking next level shit. Beautiful.
Please put everything you've ever done on itunes so I can give you my all money!
You dont even know how much i relate to this, it calmed me so so much
Who's cutting onions in here?
I always love eden song I only know everything he talks about it the stuff I'm going though and he inspires me to write my own song that are as good as he's I song one of my song 4 my mom so she knows I'm the same person as I was lil
why am i crying in class
1.42 💝 this whole song is a miracle. so is EDEN. thank you for changing my life.
There is something bad about this song....it ends....
What camera is used? It’s great for filming

As all of your other songs, I: A; will become obsessed and listen to it daily, or b; at first I dont like them than I morph into letter A😂. Really good shit keep it up
I cried for the first time since my breakup today and it was because of this song. It's been almost a month
Jonathon is the only artist I can listen to all day on repeat. I just want to say thank you. Your sound has helped my friends and I get past the rough patches in our lives. It has also helped one of my friends pursue he dreams in music. No other artist can or will ever do what your sound does for us. That You EDEN

Ich bin zwar eingefleischter ❤️Bayern❤️ Fan aber das Ritual und Video ist echt Mega... ist mir auch noch nie aufgefallen und macht Bürki gleich viel sympathischer. Daher gerne ein Daumen hoch für Bürki und das Video... 👍🏼 Geil auch, wie Spieler und Schiris ihm dem Ball teilweise schon völlig selbstverständlich zukommen lassen, nach dem Motto. Gebt ihm den Ball...⚽️
He just wants to get some camera time...BVB really should look into upgrading in his position though.
Hahahahaha❤
Mais pra q q ele faz isso? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ach ja schön anzusehen !! #lachkick !! Ist ein guter Torwart ! BVB Meister 2017/18 ??
Name of the song, please?
Don't put funny in the title
next time for referee, just give the ball to him instead he get the ball by himself xD
It is a mental game, he is getting in the head of the other team

Da werde ich in Zukunft mal drauf achten.\nAm besten finde ich das bei 0:30 :D
Neuer macht das vor jedem Spiel genau wie Fährmann es auch vorher so gemacht hat bevor er Kapitän wurde.
ICH SAG NUR KURZE ECKE
Der soll mal lieber seine kurze Ecke zu machen
Ist alle schüsse am kurzen eck reinlassen auch ein ritual von ihm?
Bürki ist Top und passt perfekt zu BvB

es un completo crack jajaja
das beste fand ich als er wie eine katzte durchdie beine von schiri sich den ball holt .. 😂😂😂😂😂
Ich sehs schon in den komentaren das ich so gehatet werde aber ich bin bayern fan und ein wenig schalke fan😁😁 ,#fcbforever
Ein Ritual hat doch jeder. Ich kratze mir morgens erstmal die Eier.
Richtig lustig. Habe mich vor lachen weg geschmissen.
Bin zwar Bayern Fan,aber finde das Bürki ein guter,erfahrender und Sympathischer Typ ist 😂💪🏼
Ach man der roman
Eigentlich macht er genau das, was Manuel neuer schon immer macht. Sollte vlt lieber stattdessen mal aufs kurze Eck achten, anstatt andere zu imitieren.
Bin ich der einzigste der das gerade zum erstenmal mitbekommt ? 😂
Can someone follow me JUST FOR LUCK BEFORE MY DATE with gf
Hi Samantha!  I just wanted to say, I watch your videos regularly, and really enjoy them!  You are so engaging with your audience, and you are just really fun to watch!  I admire all you do, being a Mom, wife, work, etc...  Keep it up!  The world needs more of your laughter and smiles!!
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS👍🏻 BUT WHAT  I LOVE THE MOST IS YOUR PERSONALITY, JUST SO HUMBLE AND SO SWEET. MANY BLESSINGS TO YOU AND YOUR LITTLE FAMILY😘🌹😇
i've also tested these lipsticks, ive done a video on it. theyre pretty good, just wish they had more nude shades.
WHERE ARE THOSE BLACK PATENT BOOTS FROM, ultimate boss bitch right there 😍😍
love the mango check blazer but can't find it online, anyone know?
Amazing video Sam, phrase do more or these, enjoyed it so much since i can relate to your lifestyle being a new mom myself, indie is just a month older than my little one :)
the laugh at 10:50!!😂😂 great video love youuu❤️
I'm sorry who disliked this?! Baffled
Where are your boots from? ☺️
In love with those earrings!
Don't mind me, just screaming at my computer, GET THE BOSS BITCH COAT!!!!
I loved this video!
Your haircolor best of ever!!
Sucks that coat is alpaca fur and wool... Not cool, so much cruelty goes into that.
My goal for this winter is to have a good quality coat I have never had one 😂 and I’m going to turn 23 years old this November so I think it’s time to have a coat 💓 love you so much Sam ❤️
Hey Sam! I have never, ever commented on someone's video before but... there is a first time fore everything right!? Well, I've been watching your videos for years and I love how candid your channel is. Anyway, I have a statement red jumper from H&M. It's in their pricier range, but fits soooo good! The sleeves are baggy and the fit but maintains it's structure and good quality similar to the one you tried on. You should check it out: http://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.0530178002.html
I went thrifting for the check jacket like you mentioned in your autumn looks video. I scored one for cheap, so I'm happy.
I loved this video!! I'm am vicariously living through your daily shopping lol love the jacket !
What foundation are you wearing?\nYour skin looks flawless :)
I want the coat in blue 💙💙
That blue coat😍 it's from other stories too?
omg that drummer man looked like someone soo much.. who the heck did he look like!!
Love this type of videos ☺️💕💕
Think the more 🍅 jumper looks like Velma from Scooby-Doo xd, definitely the boss bitch coat!! The name says it all. I liked the first red jumper and the 2nd :)
I don't mind the AD you put in any video, keep them videos coming Sam, it's awesome! 😄
You looked really good in that first red jumper ! You look amazing in everything though! Lol love the coat on you 💕👑
what store was she in with the boss btch coat ?
Looved the blue coat,but I would definitely go for the one you ended up picking up! I wanna go coat shopping too hahah I have a coat but I want a longer one :P Also liked both the second and the last sweater you tried on you. Looks like didnt end up with either of them though. Loved coming along shopping love that kind of vlog x
Hey guys!!! I've been following Samantha Maria for about ten years, and she's inspired me to start vlogging! If you have time, please check it out... I just started grad school, so I'm vlogging about my PhD experience. Sam, if you see this, I hope you'll check it out, too! (I posted this comment on one other video, but I'll stop now because I don't want to spam :o )
The blue coat was looking super good on you.
Isn't her foundation a little bit orange in this video? Especially in the beginning..?or is it just me maybe 🤔😂
You always look so so beautiful and i love you as a brunette, it is so natural and fresh on you 😘
I NEED that coat.
Samantha you're a sweetheart !! Really enjoyed watching this video, this coat looks great on you :-)
LOVED THIS!! please do more, shopping is my favourite thing xD
Love the lip colour on you! Do you think it'd be good for someone who struggles with applying lipstick?
Loved come shopping with me vlogs, would be interesting to see where you go for coffee/food/drinks when you're in london! I always love trying new places and would be interesting to see where you enjoy going!
Feus de Bois candle is the most beautiful candle at diptique I burn it summer winter spring dont care love it. goes well with the lavender. I burn both when putting my babaa to bed. very soothing.
the Tomato colored jumper was amazing on you! It maked you pop!
You look so good and this was a great vlog!!
I've seen other british youtubers do the Bourjois lipstick test, and their video was marked as an AD. Isn't this one an AD as well?
I love the coat.
love the 2nd jumper and the boss bitch coat lol! :)
Love to watch your videos Sam. You look amazing wearing that lipstick and your hair looks so so nice too. You seem so happy and I'm glad for you 🤗 Love the coat and I'm in love with that blue ruffle dress 😍😍😍 Lots of love from Holland
i'm going to head up to london i thought she would be living in london. Anyone can help me here?
I live in Amsterdam and tried the same coat in & other stories! Loved it! So soft. But was a bit worried about all the rain in fall and winter. What do you think? Will it ruin the coat..?
Just watched about 8 of your vlogs 😂😂 #sammicatchup but seriously loved every single one!
❤ your vids so much . You have great understated style
Love the video I need to go shopping with u lol 🙌🏼✨
You didn't really pick the best colour to be testing out because it's so similar to your lip colour. Just a suggestion to try a darker or bolder colour next time
I loooooove the first red sweater
God this channel is shit..
I loveeee ❤️ the black boots. Does anyone know the brand of the boots?
I am OBSESSED with the coat!! I need something like it in my life!
Which red jumper did you choose? My favourite was the second one
If I were to visit London, I would ask you to go shopping with me! love your blogs sam!
Absolutely LOVE the coat 😍
The coat looks so good on you! I definitely think you made the right choice - stylish and classy 😍 xoxo
yaaay I love this blog. where are the high shine pointed boots you were wearing from? x
<3 You pull of so many looks. Love your style. You inspire me to create my own style and experiment out of my comfort zone.
I'd love to see more of these videos 🙌🏼
😍 Oh I love love the black coat! It looks so great on you. I'm from Florida so of corse we don't get the weather to wear a coat like that. Also the earrings are beautiful!
It's interesting to see you debate investing on a winter coat since those are the things I find myself willingly splurging on. About 5 years ago I bought a €150 coat and a €50 and while the first one is still going strong, the second has been replaced after a year of wear because it was wrecked. I would rather invest in such a staple than in trendier pieces such as jackets and shirts.
You look so happy! Love seeing you this way 😊❤
Loved this video!! I really love how we get to see  the thought process behind what you choose to buy and not just the haul portion of the video. By the way what foundation are you wearing because your makeup looks amazing in this video :)
Loved it:) def would enjoy if you do those more :) xx love the coat, suits you so well
I love this video! Here in Denmark we have a coat/Blazer that reminds you very much of the one you looked at in Mango. It's called 'neo noir wales coat', and it's really good quality, and it fits so well!! <3
YES PLEASE, do more videos like this if you can, seriously it makes me feel like I'm with you, going around shopping :D and also its obviously so awesome to be able to see what kind of staple pieces you choose to buy!
I haven't watched you before but this was fun!
I really enjoy come shopping with me videos (:
Yes more videos like this please! Love your coat btw! 👏
That blue coat on you was EVERYTHING 😍😍
The lipsticks look great. And the color you chose looks great. I just feel like they will be so drying. All the long lasting ones are. I might try one. Love the coat you bought.
Love these type of videoes! Definitely do more please! xx
Yeah made my day as usual
I loved the blue one as well :) You looked very nice with it too. Probably I'm telling you because I love blue color.
where are your boots from?
This hair color and texture reminds me of Mariah Carey in the 90s
Loved following you round! Also, as a longtime subscriber it was cool because I knew which pieces were more Sam haha. 😘\n\nI think I will wait a while before getting the bourjois lipsticks.. whenever a brand does a big campaign and sponsors a lot of Youtubers etc, it makes me suspicious. Lol. I want a product that sells itself.
Love your haircolor right now\n ☺️
Lovely vlog! Your style is always amazing :)
Bourjois didnt overpower your vlog. Love you!
Great buys Sammi!
Sam! Your eyebrows looks amazing 😍
I forgot, Zara has amazing red sweaters
❤️
Love your darker hair!
Bourjois lipsticks are amazing :)
Love your outfit!
love that coat !
Love watching your shop.
Love your shopping vlogs keep them coming
Loved this video!
Thank you Sammi!! Love your vlogs :) <3
love that coat!
Love your style :D
Love the vlog, Sam 💕
One word - Lint Roller.  Beautiful coat. x
❤️💜🖤💛💙💚
What was the name of your Jo Malone perfume?  You're gorgeous!
When Mbappe is more matured than Neymar/Cavani/Alves combined.
Bayern are trying to finish 3rd so they can face Arsenal in the Europa League  knockout stages and beat them again.
Mbappe destroyed Bayern what a performance
Where's Arsenal in the programme
5:33 is messed up listen to the audio
United need to start playing some passes back rather than just shooting, because they had players in much better positions. This could've easily been 7-1
It's looking good for the English teams
A English team is definitely going far in this tournament
Lol RIO is such a Londoner I love it it's illegal 😂👏🏾
Steven Gerrard is honestly one of the worst pundits. He talks nonsense every week. He talks about Atletico never being torn apart like that yet Real Madrid beat them 3-0 twice last season
Gerrard always salty about Rashford and Man Utd in general
Even Celtic have won more than Looserpool lmao, currently the worst British CL team and the embarrassment of English Football (Apart from Arsene Wenger FC).\nChelsea, City, United and Spurs are class 👌
Lukaku too powerful
Martial FC
How does Costa feel now?
As a Man Utd fan I'm really glad Chelsea won. It's good to see English teams putting up a good fight in Europe right now compared to the horrendous few seasons we've had before in Europe!
No surprise from Stevie g to make comment like that about a Manchester united player saying mbpappe is world class and not rashford
All UK teams \n\nMatch Day 1\nCeltic - Lose \nMan City -Win \nMan Utd - win \nSpurs - Win\nChealsea - Win (sorry if i spelled wrong )\nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\nMatch Day 2 \nCeltic - Win \nChealsea - Win \nMan Utd - Win \nSpurs - Win \nMan City - Win \nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\n This shows that liver pool are the best team in the champions league
Its illegal what he's doing, not allowed, get out of the stadium
Neymar>Mbappe<Lukaku>Martial<Morata<
Wrong commentary at 5:30
English Teams 👏👏👏👏 But Liverpool🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Bt sport are great this year but they need to get rid of Owen
Come catch up with whether my door is locked
What's with the music?
Boom CHELSEA CHELSEA ARE THE BEST ARSENAL FANS DONT MESS WITH US
stevie, micheal owen was world class at 18, he won a ballon d'or and everything!
Neymar right now is on his own at the top, best player in the world.
Check out the full fight video of England cricketer Ben Stokes on my page
I would love to see an English team in the CL finals
The music for Juve made me think Dybala hit the post haha
BT's pundits are the worst. They do remember Madrid tearing them apart last season 3 times right?
Mbappe is so LIT 💥 its almost illegal what he's doing in the pitch ⚽️
Now what happened to the commentary at 5:33
got the commentary wrong at like 5:50 with lewandowski
Never thought the team id be happy to get in the last 16 would be Barca
Manchester United best team in England ❤️
The commentary at 5:43 does not refer to what is being shown on screen. Its hilarious. Bayern are on the attack but listening to the commentator you'd think PSH had had the shot.
Lukaku is the definition of a overrated tap-in merchant.
Martial >>> Mbappe
Look whoever keeps saying Rashford is better then Mbappe is on crack he has potential to be better then neymar rahsford will be lucky if he reaches rooneys potential lets be honest he has great players around him where mbappe didn’t come from the bottom and worked hard
Psg got lucky
Fantastic coverage
Lukaku more like Donkeykaku lolz
5:33 doesnt make sense
BT Sport > Sky Sport > BBC Sport
Wheres arsenal... oh wait
Chelsea make their Mark
Roma only beat Qarabag 2-1? Very weak score
Fair play chelsea
5:32 audio mixed up???
Higuine
Common chels!!!
Loved Bayern getting raped by Paris
5:33 ...
Haha costa
mBappe 😁😁😁
umtiti and semedo >>
5:40 I'm confused
5:30 lol
Anyone know the song name and artist for the song played during the PSG vs Munich Highlights?
liverpool will be the first English team knocked out ...
Shouldn't the title say 27th instead of 28th? :D
Wow Benfica are truly awful
Anyone notice Liverpool's game was not shown. 😂
I love seeing Athletico lose for some reason. Shaping up to be a stacked knockout round this year.
david luiz.. what a liability
The English teams are improving, so far so good!!!!!!
1:54 Conte's cunting the floor lol
Benfica are nothing without Ederson in goal
Just saying but Lukakus goals were both VERY lucky. Moratas goal was seriously a gem
get rid of Chris Sutton
Jan Oblak??????
Carlo Ancelotti has been Sacked
if mbappe is world class then what does that make gabriel jesus
september 27th - not 26th ------- terrible mistake
Great to see English teams doing well! I'm envious Arsenal aren't a part of it. What a win by Chelsea, just superb, United looked clinical and City will be tough for anyone to defend against. Good for Spurs too, it's about time their fans enjoyed watching a decent side. Hopefully Liverpool will improve to make it 5/5 in the last 16, Anfield needs more big nights. As for my team, well I'm off to Belarus, should be fun. Would love to see us win the whole thing.
FOREVER King of pop

Can someone tell me how to edit a picture like the one in the thumbnail
When I got the song I thought Michael Jackson was alive
I love the remix sounds great.......

😍😍😍👏👏👏👏
Little Monsters Presente Aqui! Love Michael Jackson! 👑❤💀❤💀❤👑
¡¡Esto está muy lejos de lo que pudo haber hecho Michael Jackson!! Prefiero mil veces la original y con esa me quedo hasta el día de mi sepultura. Fucking Sony ¬¬
por que a el, podias llevarte a maluma, ozuna, pero por que a el? :,v
Mj woulda hated this crap. How do people like this?
I love Steve Aoki, but this is just not a good remix. The original is much better. This remix adds noting.
I will love MJ forever. I’m sure you worked hard on this. It’s not for me sorry, prefer without all the remixing don’t mess with perfection.
I think the beat should have dropped at I'm going to thrill you tonight. The beat should have been bass from there, not continuing the same beats. I felt Calvin Harris would have done a way better job than vanilla Steve Aoki -probably the worst DJ from EDM era. I think Marilyn Manson would've been an interesting collab with this song to make it freaking scarier.  I like the idea of remixing his songs, for a fresh revamp of his music even though it's fine the way it is, but mofos do it right!
Is he still alive
SI JE MOURRAIS J'IRAIS AU PARADIS AVEC MICHEAL JACKSON !!! ( Prend son toutou Micheal Jackson et son disque de sa mami ) 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍( ﾟдﾟ)(・o・)(゜o゜)＼(◎o◎)
This is an island. Surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water.\n-the leader of the free world
Dark, dark times. From Obama to this? Incredible, yet there he is!
This is an island, surrounded by water\n\nJust in case you confused it with an island not surrounded by water.
Can a fucking meteor just end us already...
There is also fish in the water. Big fish. Fish that swim type of fish. Fish.
Puerto Rico is not just surrounded by water--it's surrounded by bigly water!
This shit can't be happening! WHY????
He is an embarrassment to the American people. And a dangerous man to the world
I heard this on the radio and thought it was a joke, but WOW like that is what an island is,  An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water.  define it for me you 3rd grader...
An island surrounded by water  no fucking shit Sherlock I bet there were major face palms back stage
Painful to listen to and to watch. No need to go into the words he's saying. That's self explanatory. But someone also needs to just put one teleprompter in the front. Trump looks like a fool reading when they're at the sides. He doesn't have the skill to make it look natural.
We are bringing in trucks. Big trucks. Full of gas. On tires.
Heard smarter responses from beauty pageants
This tops people die when they are killed.\nThanks Trump, thanks.
The use of 'totally', TWICE in less than 2 minutes. It burns my ears!!!
Trump can barely speak coherent English. This isn't having a New York accent, this is ridiculous.
I thought puerto rico was surrounded by dasani water, boy was I mistaken
Just painful to watch.....PR is surrounded by big water says POTUS 45th. Disgraceful!
New meme?
Hello, my name is Robert Lopez and I come from a Beautiful Island of Beautiful People in the middle of the ocean. Surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water. And Sea water too. Oh, and we are Americans. Yes, American Citizens. And we speak Spanish, and English as well. And we have served in America's Armed Forces since 1917...yeah, really. Our little island surrounded by big water contributes more service members per capita than any other state in the union. We have  astronaut, scientists, a Supreme Court Justice, Medal of Honor receipients and many, many more distinguished Citizens who call our little beautiful island their Mother and Father Land. We are a GORGEOUS and interesting mix of Taino, Spaniard and African blood that gives us an incredible drive to survive.
And I'm from an island surrounded by land, it's called mainland. 😂😂😂
He is really ill
LMAO... PUTIN MUST HAVE HIT LIL DONNIES BRAIN WHILE HE SUCKED HIS CK.... BIG WATER??? WHAT A FKN MORON...LIKE MOST REPUBS.
Did Trump just find out the definition of a island?
I want to know how the two women controlled their faces.  I would have laughed so hard and fallen out of chair.
Piece of shit prick fuck Donald Trump ur a fucking joke
Water is wet, really wet, and blue
Anyone that voted for trump is responsible for this idiot . You are going to hell for being a racist.
Obama would have had aid to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 8 days ago.😏
We paid for this Dumbass to fly to Puerto Rico to give this speech! I want my money back!
Island surround by water - oh yeah Donnie that's the definition of an island - land surround by water.  Fool, moron, dummy, jackass, bat-shit crazy, bastard.
Funny how there are no trolls in this comment section. This shit is so crazy that even the trolls are sitting this one out lol.
He has 2 explain its a island because most americans are dumb as fuck and dont know
Where are the Trumptards
What a complete FUCKING IDIOT!!!!
What an idot....surrounded by no intelligence....little intelligence....big stupidity ~~~
Puerto Rico (7.8) -IGN too much water, big water, ocean water.
So all the dark times you pansies are talking about happened in the months that Trump has been in office? It couldn't have come from the 8 years of batshit crazy policies by Dems and Obama? Hmmmm
He's a nobfaced arse twat ! Waste of seamon and a utter utter bastard!
😐
Puerto Rico is an island surrounded by water big water ocean water 😂 what a idiot he couldn't even articulate himself verbally.
This American were saying weeks ago Yankee go , Now they are saying help us.
The 🤡 said what? Mental. Incapable.
I get exhausted just listening to this fuckn idiot
I'm surprised he didn't say, Surrounded by wet water. Nothing is too insane for Trump.
I don't even call this FOOL my President. The guy never makes any since when he does a speech. Got damn it.. Can he just hire a Writer that will make it easier for him to say something smart?  He always exaggerate . We never seen a situation like this  Really?  WTF is wrong with him?  lol
This incredible amount of education and knowledge is truly refreshing. GOOD JOB! Incredible! Each and every six-year-old will be proud of you. Make islands wet again! Repeal and replace the tides! Drain the irritating oceans! :-)
This dude acts like a 4th grade kid who is doing a book report who does not have his notes
US intelligence steals electric cables and sends them to Florida
Wow just wow. George W Bush was more intelligent.
It just 1,033 miles from Florida to Puerto Rico.
I don't know  if should laugh, cry, get mad or...????  He's Donald trump people
I think this sums it all up. And I mean all of it.
Americans better pray and hope that Donald Trump is only pretending to be stupid. The point of no return is when Trump starts believing in the things he is saying.
So this is what a high IQ sounds like? Fuck, I hope I don't have one.
Dump actually does the impossible -  makes Bush 2 look like a Rhodes Scholar.
Somebody tell Fish Lips to sit down and shut the hell up.
lol he made it clear to us that the island is not attached to the mainland
Im going to go freeze myself for 4 years. Wake me up when we have a new president.
Fucking idiot. Just read from the fucking teleprompter and stop improvising.
What a complete demented (literally) fool.  Are you embarrassed yet??  Just stick to the teleprompter, I doubt it SAID THAT.
OBAMA HAD CLASS AS A PRESIDENT. BUT NOT EVERONE CAN BE AS NOBLE AS A BLACKMAN. some people are simple minded moron racist pigs sort of like police in amerikkka. This dreadful bloody history of this Cuntry that was built by Slaves For Free and now there made I wanna rest and take a Knee.
I’m not sure whether or not to like or dislike this video 😂
Trump is Puerto Rico's Killer. BOOGIE MAN.
only if they are white and his voters like tx and fl.
The usa in 2017 is surrounded by trump redneck supporters bigger ignorance and wider americas foolishness
that chin vagina is getting worse
This fucktard inspires me that I can achieve anything!
Without food or water, people die. Not alive anymore. Forever.\n\nDon't make absurd excuses. Help them live and not die. Oh and thanks. I would not have understood what island meant without your articulate explanation. *rolls eyes*
oh my fuckin god   what a fuckin  RETARD!!! AND EVRYONE THAT VOTED FOR HIM.....BIG RETARDS..AN ISLAND WITH BROWN PEOPLE ON IT...YOU MOTHER FUCKIN BIGOT!!!!! COME ON AMERICA LETS PITCH IN AND HELP PEURTO RICO OURSELVES!!! go to Ricky Martins YourCaring website....just a dollar each of us.....people are fuckin dying and Trump dont even care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I swear to God in heaven this is the dumbest human being ever!
What an embarrassment Trainwreck Trump is to our country. I'm only glad my kids are too young to know.
Trumps speech on the situation is loaded with condescending signals. He repeatedly states how totally useless the Puerto Rican government is and kind of says we have to do everything for them not in a good way but as if he is complaining. It's terrible how rascist this official is. He can't even mask his internal rascism and emotions on the issue for a simple speech.
Someone needs to make a YouTube poop out of this.
Sowas ist President geworden!! OMG!
Tillerson's right
Lmao water so much water 😭😂
Captain obvious john madden jr
lmao
F-tard
ESTUPIDO PRESIDENTE...
What a dumbass.
ｂｉｇ　ｗａｔｅｒ
Hehe oh right
aahhhhh ha haahahahhah lol ... 8 yrs of Obama traitor, now you get your 8 years ! looooooove TTTTRUmps Haaaate.. remember! : D
gotta love trump
LOL xD
Dear DOTARD Drumpf! New Orleans!
Jesus he's a dumb fuck!!  Elitist, pompous, racist bastard.
Basket case.
If you take out the duplicated phrases, this clip is 10 seconds MAX. However, the dictionary description of what an island is can be very helpful to all the 5 year olds out there. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss DubbaYaa's press conferences more and more every day!
He's a big dumb buffoon, isn't he folks? Save your breath. It must get tiring constantly defending this orange idiot...
Seriously people!. You must know by now that Trump speaks to his voters, and it is clear to him that he must explain that an island is surrounded by water but not by any water but ocean water.
Fake news nobody not that stupid in real life lol
Donald Trump has a lot of money. I guess that disproves the old adage that a fool and his money are soon parted.
Does anyone even care he wants to help the port of gold? I get its funny, but chill out guys. He's done great things so far.
But Puerto Ricans sucked US balls to be US State
Soo, it's a peninsula? - Trump Supporter
President Trump needs to explain what an island is so libtards will understand, .... and yet libtards still don't get it.
Is it just me, or is everybody plugging their ears for the first few sentences. You people seem to have become animals as of late.  Specifically, sheep . And when you keep ignorantly focussing on these petty topics (Listen to how he speaks blah blah blah What an idiot etc etc) You are just creating more hate and division in your country when really, He is actually doing a fair job at being your President ( I am Canadian). It's a real shame to see and I fear that it is this which will be the ultimate demise of your country,  and not your current President.  I used to be Anti-Trump, until I stopped looking at what the fast growing masses were reporting on, and then actually did some research myself. You know when people are trying to convince you of something? But then they seem to be trying to convince you so hard, so very badly that you start to wonder Why do you want me to believe this so creepily bad? At all costs? To the point where they are twisting facts, and even making up stories to convince people of their views. There is a very strong smell of desperation in the air. And that was a bad tell for me. I am not saying Trump is perfect. But he is NOT what he is being made out to be by Mainstream news, Hollywood, and the elite. The Emmys were just a bunch of celebrities patting themselves on the back and then circle jerking over Trump jokes the whole night. That is not political discourse. Thats not calmly and amicably solving issues. Thats Grade school stuff. The O'Doyle Rules mentality.
I actually can't believe she's 32 she looks more like 23😧😂
LOVE THIS. sortedfood got in too 👌👌👌
Are Gigi Hadildo and Anthony Padildo related?
WE HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY YOURE LITERALLY TWICE MY AGE I JUST TURNED 16
Damn your really 32, that's crazy way to beautiful

You whole YouTube accounts is a satire
My birthday is on the 28
Hope everyone is safe and well after the socking events yesterday.
I can’t believe you’re 32. I feel like since I started watching your videos I thought you were in your mid to late twenties and I still think that!
I don't know why I could wait to get home and watch this
I'm the type of person that would be friends with a lying kiniving lesbian and not even realize for years and years until I am being hunted down by our friends that we've made and still not ever even real side that we were supposed to be more than best friends until I run away from home only to awake to more friend requests from angry lesbians wanting me to explain my previous relationship with my good friend that just happens to be black and all of a sudden there are fascists at my door begging for answers. but I'm def straight. as I've said and argued a million times befor e
Your hair looks at it's best!
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY GRACE! YOU MAKE ME SMILE, and I LIKE YOU A LOT.
I like your new hair, thought I don't know if it's new but it's new to me and I like it so there. Compliment achieved.

Happy birthday!! I hope that I look as good as you when I'm 32... Except that I'm 39... and a boy... Damn you're hot!!!
4:25 Why was blonde Michelle Wie in this video? Makes no sense.
32 things you've learnt this year = 32 reasons why I love this channel 🔥❤
Thank you once again !! I really wish more people could laugh at themselves more. It just makes sense to want to laugh!!
Everything I learnt this year came from this video.

Haven't heard from Margaret Cho or Clidoris Trembles in sooo long!
I hope she'll make couple of videos with her mother and brother during the Christmas season :)
Great video! Happy Birthday Grace, you make my day better whenever I watch you. Thank you for that.\nAlso, the final expression in the video is precious.
Happy birthday! And also you should totally be a drag queen.
I think I want that sweater. Where'd you get it Grace?
eyeliner is on POINT you go birthday girl
whats the video at 3.38 ?
Ok 1. She looks fantastic for 32. She's always looked fantastic. 2. When she shotguns the beer or gives the handcuff secret away...what was up with her voice there?
If the blue night loses... I'll just die. me talking about any of my celebrity crushes
I feel like you already didn't know.
You and my son have the same birthday!
Your videos always make me happy, Grace!!
You should react to Daniel bregolis new songs !!!!!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRACE
Happy birthday you lovely weirdo.
Gracesss get your friends into your car... Echosmith :)
I actually love your douchebag cousin.
You gotta love Grace
1:30 FUCK
32? Fuck, I wish she was still in her 20's so she'd still be young and fuckable. Middle aged women aren't attractive.
Shouldve kepts #3 to yourself. It's disgusting to have a stank pussy and then you admit to have stink pussy. At 32 your pussy still stinks???? Thats DISGUSTING
The irony. This narcissist, misogynistic douchebag who celebrates macho gun culture is part of the problem. He's glorifying gun violence in his vile social media output. He's a hypocrite.
Lol fucking douche. Trying to be a hero naah don’t think so
Hey I’m gonna run towards a mass murderer, where’s my camera?
I would have given him n unloaded one n been like go get him!
id give the cookie to the camera man though..
Damn everyone is overreacting to this. At least he was trying to help take the shooter out. Everyone else got online and started a gofundme to lobby for stricter gun laws
Curved so hard by the police lmao! What a dumbass
Dans methods certainly won't be in any police manuals - You don't say...........! 😜👍🏻
Wow look at all the real hero's on here. At least he had a good intention. Albeit misplaced.
A man runs straight towards a shooter. It doesn’t fucking matter if there is someone filming him. He is running straight towards someone who is shooting down from a hotel room to try and do something about it. I don’t know what he could have done, but for fuck sake, why are you all getting pissed at him?
Living in Vegas, you do think this is a set up designed for some self publicity stupidity. I was a cop and now work armed around the strip and downtown (protection/security). You would think if there is any training involved, he would note to FR's that he was there and was going to help the wounded, wait for instruction and follow said instruction. Metro are highly trained and it is their job, using tactics, training, and SWAT to locate and take out the threat. What is an internet star going to do? I mean, good on the guy for using his wealthy background to become every juvenile male's dream  action man hero on the net, but really! No radio, no comms, no training with your brothers and sisters in uniform so you are in sync, no back up, and a civilian with no policing or military history. I don't get the the action man generation lol.
This must've been before he went to strap on his guns like Commando
Who the fuck is this?
A bit fcked up he does his personal promotion on the back of this tragedy
He didn't know where it was coming from, also, is he a jew?
50 people died and 200 injured and this dick thinks he is in an action movie
People ripping on Dan but he was a lot more calm than the cop... and cops are supposed to be the collected ones in these situations.
“I dont know who you are” .... my thoughts exactly
This guy got another guy to film him at a time like this? What the fuck is wrong with him? He was getting in the way.
Who is this guy
Worst Thing about the Vegas Shooting: This Cunt didn't get shot in the face
In defense of Dan, he is currently a police officer and was a Navy seal, he's also a fire arms expert. Was a bit stupid asking a cop for a gun in the get of the commotion. But I can't see what he's doing wrong. As for filming it etc, I'm glad he filmed it, the more footage of this incident documented the better.
capitalising on such a tragedy suggests he has no respect whatsoever. a society that looks upto assholes like this is bound to lose itself to darkness.
To join the army, age 16, COD, age 18
That cop cussed him the fuck out
can anyone notice how it sounds like theres two guns firing? the rounds going off have completely different pitches and rate of fire.
from hero to zero
This is an embarrassment to the people who put their lives at risk at the concert like Matthew Cobos. This is clearly on the other side of the building/away from the risk. How this dude has any moral dignity is awful. I hope this dude gets caught out & the actual heroes get recognition. They deserve it. True heroes.
This guy is fucking funny he's running and crouching like COD
EVIL MURDERER IF HE WAS MUSLIM THIS NEVER WOULD OF HAPPENED HE NEEDED ALLAH IN HIS LIFE!!! ALLAHU AKBAR
sounds like more than one shooter
Lol what is he planning on doing without a rifle?  This seems silly.
Does Dan Bilzerian suffer with Hero Syndrome or something similar?
some ppl forgot that he was an navy seal...
dans probably in on this shit as some weird seal guy
Dan is the man. He's a man of action. We need more men like him. Thank you Dan. Forget the losers, it's lonely at the top.
Im not usually the kind of person to support dan bilzerian's behavior but I think he just wanted to do what he could. His heart was in the right place but his head wasn't
0:40 is he telling them he's a cop?
What he did was pretty idiotic. The cop was trying to take cover and Dan blocked him and got in the way to Show him his creds. He should be charged because he put that cops life in danger by delaying him getting cover for a few secs. Can you imagine if that cop would of gotten shot because of that????
I get what hes trying to do. He has training with guns of all kinds. However WTF are you doing Dan!!!?? These people are cops that are doing their job. There not going to give any random their gun even if they were a Navy Seal lol. Really stupid question to ask.
Hey, At least he tried to help.
Dan was the Shooter.
It's like a scene out of tropic thunder
LOL...This video makes him look even worse!!
The fuck is this guy gonna do ?
these attention whores are always ready to step on murdered innocent people,just to pose,keep supporting them you plebeians xD
This guy is so dumb I cant even  get mad about the fact he was intervening an officer during a shootout.
quality cringe, maybe he should have told the cop where his daddy hid the money
I mean the cop was running in the opposite direction....dan was interfering though.
simply asking a gun from a cop? do he think this is in a movie? why dont he just ran into the building..
😂😂he was in the john Rambo mood
Who is this idiot? Why is this on trending
In England we have a cool word for peoole like Dan........CUNT.
If he actually wanted to help he could have used those big muscles and help drag or carry one of 500 FUCKING PEOPLE WHO GOT SHOT. retard instead tries to kill a man on a 32nd floor of a locked down building trying to get a gun from a cop. Retard
I would kill myself if I was Dan bilzerian, there is no coming back now. EVERYONE knows he is a fraud, coward, pussy and a bitch. Asking police for guns jeeesus fucking chriiist
What a fucking moron. It's only made worse by the fact he chose to record it, some 'Hero'.
This has to be a fucking joke lol what the fuck did he actually thing he was gonna do
this guy is the biggest fucking faggot on the planet, the biggest tragedy of this whole event is this dude didn't get killed
Listen i have millions of followers on instagram and i love guns n tits, let me help man.  Come on look at my beard , its huge!
Die Hard steroids.....\n\n\ncoming this December to a theatre near you
dude! WTF?! why is he dressed like that? nobody's gotten a handjob in cargo shorts since nam
He saw that everyone was calling him a pussy when he was running away so he decided to go back LOL.  This guy is willing to put his life on the line for his social media reputation.
This is so embarrassing lol.
Oh dear
Bozo
Failed....dismally
Jesus, what a fucking moron. Instagram dickwad poseur.
what a fucking douchebag
pathetic shit
Total prick. Fucking little creature.
What a fucking idiot

What a cunt.
Lol fuckin redneck retard
Cunt, desperate for recognition.\n\nSad fucking cunt.
Dan GI-JOE Bilzerian over here...
What’s with the hates..
LOL! the comments down here are priceless
All the people in the comments attacking Dan, he went through seal training twice, he's far more qualified with a gun than that ticket cop. Also at least he was trying to fight back instead of hiding like a coward.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PNT5BiaDPhw subscribe me plx
u hero
Dan was there. You pud knockers weren't. Either was that suck ass Dakota Meyer. Easy to talk smack when you've done heroic deeds wearing full body armor, carrying multiple weapons, know where the shooter is and also Dakota had help. \nSo STFU already.
An absolute stone cold great human being, such a nice guy & deserves everything he's gained
Why does most guys smell the dirty dicks wings 😂
Terry was epic in White Chicks
i never seen teeth that white lmao
Dana White went on a diet and changed career
Such a lovely person.
why is this in no.1 trending though?
I just saw an old spice ad with Terry Crews
Sean Evans gonna be getting invited to all the celebrity parties
HOT ONES!!!.... PLEASE PLEASE... GET SNOOP DOGG I would love to see him TAKE ON THE HOT ONES  if ya'll got A$AP FERG get the O.G DOGG
I love this man
I feel like Steve Jobs in the 70's fucking terry crews
why is this man not doomfist
Just had a Terry Crew's Old Spice ad before watching this.....EPIC.
Lol to hot or na 😂😂✅
I just giggle when I see Crews...then I laugh!
I don't believe I'm capable of loving anyone after this!!!!!
I had an old spice ad before this lol
Sean is a beast. He's run this gauntlet more than anyone.
Terry is a legend. Always good when someone you thought was cool but didn't really know much about turns out to be such an interesting guy
Yeah Terry Crews...you could really hear the passion in his voice when talking about his son he's really giving it his all to be part of that kids life....what a damn great guy.
anyone else get a terry crews old spice commercial before this?
easily one of the best episodes EVER. incredible, just amazing and beautiful
What the fuck is the music
I can't be the only person that got an old spice ad on this video
Literally an old spice ad with Terry crews before this video.
It was only a matter of time before they got Terry Crews on here since it is sponsored by old spice
The whole idea of these interviews is genius, you can tell the actors are actually having a lot of fun, they talk about things they care about. I just love this show so much because it's so different and creative and it shows the true colors of these actors that we don't get from watching other interviews.
Seems like such a cool guy!
Of course I get an old spice ad.
I fucking love this guy!
Best interview of all time
Has to be one of the best episodes ever!
Loved Terry before absolutely admire the dude now, such a genuine guy.\n\nEuro Training!
I love Terry but those were some fucking baby bites.
terry is the bomb!
Terry is one of my fav actors.. when he played Julius was a big part in my growing up
Who else got a old spice commercial before this?
Hot Ones To Do List:\n-Steve O-\n-Adam Richman-\n-Terry Crews-\nBill Burr\nGordon Ramsay\nAnthony Fantano\nKendrick Lamar\nTyler, The Creator
You finally got Terry Cruz! Mad man!
best episode no doubt. make this shit viral please
This episode was as entertaining as Eric Andre but nowhere near as stupid (props to Eric but he's so damn ridiculous lol). 11/10 would watch again.
Wow Terry Crews fast who would of knew
Terry crews is such a great guy sooo nice everytime i seen interviews but he looks like an absolute beast !! Big scarey terry the nicest guy ever!!
They had a woman make the recipe..I'm reporting this video for sexism....
How can 1k dislike this? MINDBLOWN! Terry is like an energy drink for the soul! How can you not like him
sorry to comment twice but\n\nYou can honestly SEE HOW genuine of a dude Terry is through this interview If you ever read this man, you are a serious inspiration!
Capsicum is essentially a poison & you can tell it really hit him hard because he lives such a healthy life. One of the best yet!!! You can tell when cigarette and pot smokers are on the show because they've desensitized their tastebuds. Terry set the bar high for entertainment value.
Isn't 2,000,000+ Scoville close to pepper spray territory? Can someone who knows more about this explain to me how that's possible? I've read a lot of Scoville levels are just guesses/bullshit.
Did anyone else get an old spice ad
Love this guy, strongest most inspirational, 'real' person I know.
Best one so far
He should of been the actual voice for doomfist but nope
please have idubbbz on this PLEASE!!!
Definitely a top ten episode. This man is just inspiring as hell. Never felt so motivated and felt so positive in my life until I saw this. And this is coming from a very optimistic person. Love Terry
I fast just like terry crews, I'm glad he's making it more mainstream.
Please do a 10 wing with each of the super troopers crew lol
Who else fast forwarded to the end?(If Terry's watching this, I'm asking for a friend)
This video alone is gone start giving Terry many more movie options GUARANTEED
He got me a little emotional when he started speaking about his abusive father. Terry,  you are a gem.
You think I'm playin?
Could Terry be any more of a badass human being? Love this episode
Favorite interview yet!\n\n\n\n\nAnd I've seen every one. They're great. Your channel is destined for big things, my guy.
Terry Crews is the dark skinned Dwayne Johnson
Surprised his head didn't really explode :P
I got an oldspice ad before this.
what a great man.
If you have been watching this guy for awhile and not subbed do it now!

The media was all for her and the conservatives now the are all for Corbin. Bunch of jokers the media
Another classic stunt by lee nelson cant wait to how he prepared for this 1 🤣😂🤣😂
Looks like Stephen Hawking in his prime
I'm confused what's a p45 and wtf is this vid on about
*Got no clap*\n*Cough cough* you may not have heard me...\n*Forced clap*
I love a good prank! lol
what that the the guy from Lee Nelson's well good show
It's a shame that comedian, doesn't have anything intelligent or useful to add. But instead resorts to the easy millennial route of just trying to make a name for yourself with cheap social media stunts.
Plot twist.....it was a real P45
ISIS claimed responsibility for the p45
Looks like grant from college humour!
His name is Simon Brodkin, he’s pranked things like Britain’s Got Talent and even Trump! \n\nHonestly such a funny guy.
He deserves to face a firing squad.
They should've been sus anyway\nTorry conferences are almost entirely older people
If only they both had a bare knuckle fight, really wish corbyn gave her some👊🏻
I'm a American and I learned that a p45 is like a pink slip and I thought that if the corbyn guy isn't in office this lady can't give it to him.
Wow, real clever the way she flipped that joke around onto Corbyn amirite
Man should have a real job.
Shame it wasn't a gun. And shame he didn't take that gun, and shoot her in her ugly face.
Omg Lee Nelson where have you been xD
Was that Lee Nelson?
That looks a lot like Simon Brodkin lad 😂
In 1 hour it went down to 3 in trending. :(
That's exactly how my boss gave me my P45.. shaking
I’m pretty sure that P45 was intended was that stuck up good for nothing “Boris Johnson” dumbass 😂😂😂
It's lee nelson (Simon brodkin or something like that)
He should've handed Theresa a Kitkat - She could do with a break :)
may out..\nbojo in..he`ll become a laffing stock..\npaving the way for corbyn...\nCIVIL WAR.......
you're all so harsh, May is alright really...
That's Lee nelson
Maybe go to that guys job and wave paper in his face while he is trying to do his job? This would piss me off. The last thing you need while your at work is some little clown whore coming in and taking the piss imo.
Pardon my ignorance, but what is P45?
the bigger question....how on earth did he manage to get in?????!!! Ninja Prankster XD
At least May has one thing going for her; she's funnier than Lee Nelson or whatever his real name is. Unfunny bellend.
Well I thought I may get some educational comment in here, but all there is is idiot remarks about an in-funny and dangerous twit.
I don't get it, what happened?
Wow that was really clever and totally worth getting arrested over. That dude is savage... *heavy sarcasm*
He is probably telling her that it's time for you to get P45.  Such an Epic scene of British politics.
An incompetent politician  -  the nation cringes everytime she speaks. The whole country is embarrassed to have such a non-entity as PM.
Could someone explain what a P45 is? Or is it just a gun? Thanks.
All politicians are the same May Corbyn Trump Merkel wake up all of you
The fat women standing up just shows who are the conservative fans.
Best part of the speech
She's the lowest of the low
Wish this old witch would just get on with Brexit already
So this.. this is the power of the left? I am scared.
You ran your own party into the ground. If you just didnt do anything you couldve cruised right through the election. Now youre just a joke. You disappoint me theresa may
Even inanimate objects are telling theresa what to do with the F off
She talks about Corbyn a lot though. Wow. 😕
You people gotta get rid of this loser
Can someone tell me what a P45 is?
Buy that man a pint
What she doing out the kitchen?
I would pay to see that comedian
Content Cop should be here instead
Why is this number 1 on trending wtf where is idubbbztv
Lee Nelson, back at it again...
Is that simon brodkin aka (lee nelson)
If anyone was wondering who it was, it was Simon Brodkin
I was going to say she handled it well but then she turned it into a snarky attack on Jeremy Corbyn when duriing election time she was scared to debate him, or the other party leaders.
Anyone else wondering why the prankster was walking like Golem LOL?
She is weak and wobbly struggles to win a election begs a northern Irish party founded by terrorists to keep he in a job and it looks like she will be at the dole office soon 😁
Shame it wasn't an OBE 👂🏼💥🔫😂
your past as home secretary was bad with the only thing of note being your term as home secretary which was the longest
And here we observe a wild Simon Brodkin in his natural habitat
Please follow my instagram: animal_addicted1 \n\nI have some important news about my YouTube channel
Whoever that guy was make that guy our prime minister
Why does he look like Russell Howard in disguise 😂
Dude, this is the Prime Minister. Where the hell is her Security?! If this was Trump he would be dead in a few seconds
Nobody realises this is Lee Nelson... Haha
Long live the tories
He just looks stupid...

GAH
There would be grave consequences for doing something like this in North Korea or China.
The guy who pranked her is a comedian who's had his own tv show few years back. He did the sketch Jason bent premiership footballer should check it out if not seen its hilarious.

This is the most pain in the ass work ever seen in this planet.
Am I the only one who is wondering how they dont get electrocuted
Where is the grass?
This is what people be doing to their car before they tell you well taken care of
Where are the bikini girls?
could this be the world fastest hottub?
Taking the Initial D cup of water to the next level
Those brake vacuum pumps are usually meant to be hooked up to a reserve vacuum tank so there is enough vacuum when the brakes are applied, hooking it straight up would not work great, as they apparently found out...
I was having a rough night but your laugh cheered me right up 😂
Why does he look like he can be gordan ranseys son
You have to go 60 then just stop emergency brake whatever then all the water will go everywhere
I would like to know how well the water heating system worked.\n\nDid it get the water to a comfortable temperature?How long did it take?
Can u build a plane
Wow that was a Cool Video
This was a idea off a old terrible cartoon network show called dude what would happen they were called
Meanwhile people ride 3 days on a camel through the desert to get water for survival. The contrasts of life...
Love your work Colin. I love the e36 unfortunately the misses wanted an e46 coupe with a fancy steptronic gearbox that is now shagged. My 1989 Audi 90 quattro is my preferred sports car and still going strong.
Kids are awesome\nIs the steering wheel going to get damp
Ive always wondered about your assistant rick, is he like your unemployed mate who pops round to help?
Please do a feature on your beemer, i know it isnt a car channel but would be cool to see
The problem isn't that the car is full of water, it's that the steering wheel is on the wrong side
1950: in 2017 there will be flying cars \n2017: ( this video)
why do u do that
Damn i love this video 💗
Would be been entertaining if they drove it on the actual street with traffic. This was just boring.
How do you get insurance to drive that on the road and imagine if you got pulled by plod lol
Excuse me.. I’m a 25 year old mechanic and if I chose to watch a kids show I will. And I’ll keep my manliness
Ideal car for hot weather:)
COLIN! IS THAT YOUR BAND?! AND IS THAT YOUR SON??? your the coolest guy the world has ever known
The most anoying laugh ever fucking stop it omg
'It's like driving a boat but there's no sea' 🙄🤔🙄
Hey furz, I'm Kaleb and I am also an e30 lover I'm 16 and got a 323i 1984 e30 when I was 15 for $600 and it's my project :), hope to get a reply, long time fan!
3:00 When you forget to put the convertible top up 😂👌 \n\n4:54 and turn on heat 😁
I guess the engine... \n*Puts on sunglasses*\nGot a bit flooded. \nYEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
Yeah, this is why I watch your channel and subscribed ages ago.
Hey colin if you see this. Can you make another doorbell imitation gun video but with 2 of the ak 47s
Taking a bath while you drive😄😄😄😄
That would be a really good prank having the water come out the air vents
I have youtube red...and I have to say that the regular Colin Furze shows are so much better. The youtube red shows are over produced. They have too much exposition and fill.
Now fill it with beer.
now the question is can Fujiwara Takumi drift that car just as good as he does with his 86
The only reason I like it is because it's stick
How was the water temperature?
great video. shows that even furze has complications on his shit during the progress, he sure enjoys it after he finishes it.
I hope they wiped good after taking a shit, that water was mighty brown
ask TAKUMI FUJIWARA on how to drive without spilling water inside a car
can you make a souller powered rail gun with things found around your house
Now make a spa car that actually has a roof so the water doesnt escape
Best Idea Ever. One day I´ll be just like colin :)
7:44 when i try to mimic an elephant
Please never use the stick shift as a hand rest
Image that going down da road lol
You should make a whole car, with the roof, that only have 1 hole for the straw for you to breath :)
Better than the official video IMO, loved it!
Hello my dear friend I already subscribed to your channel. Now you want your consent for my channel. Please do not forget me.
That's one way to water injection.
2:06 one way to clean the street right y'all?
looks like he's seen the criticism of the Red series then.
I'd love to be this guys neighbor
Colin would be really good at car restoration.
Your Accent!? I can't ..... never again ...
psshht...it needs to fart bubbles out the tail pipe to really be cool
I appreciate you addressing the youtube red series so maturely Colin
That final google ad was actually a pretty good ad
What happens when you drive that through a car wash?
I loathe googles involvement in this guy's handiwork. Google has become evil.
It’s like he washed his car but forgot to cover the top
What the hell am I watching? Ha
i had the same issue with water coming in to the combustion chamber with my E30 but the difference is, my problem is because of the age of the car (crack in the head of engine block) but colinfurze got his issue because pouring water inside of his car.. i'm crying while watching this video but at the same time i feel the joy that come from his face :')

That gorilla ripping his stomach open D:
I love the little scuttly noise the microbes make •w•
if only they tought shit in school like that i would pay attention
I've noticed c.diff can also be counteracted by bacteria supplements, including yogurt.
What type of Microbes do humans have on their brains
Ohhhhhh. This explains why healthy people who eat healthy foods are generally happier.
Rick was really on to something with that Doo doo in my butt song
The best video animation up till now 2000000000000claps and prases for your team
Bodies are just controlled semi-autonomous environments for microbes.
isnt it kinda crazy how we are the fucking king of billions of bacteria.
Does sperm contain bacteria?  Cuz that would be interesting...... 🤔
People themselves are made of evolved bacteria.
But why don't we feel to eat more vegetables like pizza? Don't the veggie-loving bacteria love them?
Can you cite any of the studies used to draw these conclusions?
I looked at my hand and said hi.\n\nThen I licked it and drank water
Wow! I didn't know bacteria had some control over our br- ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
Imagine that, using other peoples shit as a cure by shoving their shit up your asshole.
Fast food bacteria? Poop transplantation? I've heard it all now

HOLY SHIT THIS CHANNEL IS AMAZING
Fuck Bill Gates he's a scary individual.
For anyone interested in the topic, I recommend to read I Contain Multitudes by Ed Yong.
Re meep. you need to get out more and maybe get laid .
I think there's a mistake in the video. He says that fecal transplants from thinner people to obese people reduced their sensitivity to insulin, but this is actually how type 2 diabetes is caused if I'm not mistaken. Healthier individuals with less body fat should generally have higher insulin sensitivity. Am I missing something, or is this just a mistake in the video? Perhaps he meant to say lowered insulin resistance. I always disliked the interchangeability of those two terms. (Great video by the way; very enjoyable and interesting to me)
0:09 remember kids a penis shaped microbe is always on your hands
Tell us something about funtioning of a robot
6:22 the moment I regret watching this before breakfast
0:31 I see what you did there!!!
Now my body feels like a videogame...
directly injecting poop in gut....😟😟 maybe.. giving live bacteria orally  also works.... aahh. live bacteria in such case like thing by which they can be protected from stomach environment and reach the gut...????? ...\nmaybe I will be a docter 5-6 year later.... then I will work in this field
Man I love these videos !
What makes fast food bacteria inherently bad, though? If they contribute with their own messengers (seratonin, immune support, etc.), then literally the only problem you would have with them is increased caloric intake due to food preference. Simply breed a fast food bacteria with a higher metabolism, and BAM, you can eat absolute garbage, get all the benefits of good bacteria, and get to actually taste food instead of fibrous cardboard.
I honestly need some sources on this one.
Well I'm going to go brush my teeth, don't want no bacteria shitting in my mouth
Hands down best science youtube channel
I've heard before about poop transplats but I didn't know they were totally real and ongoing! :o
and also what does our cellphone to us
The problem with poop transplants is if the bacteria on it will be accepted into the gut, and if there is even enough to counter it
Your foreskin has a microbiome too.
Show a germaphobe this video
If these bacteria are so helpful then why don't we breed them on large scale and five the patients a diet of these bacterias
This is the reason i'm chubby, period.
you should introduce a video about quasar and nebula
Something about that ape ripping up its stomach and starts fighting some amoeba made me uneasy
I enjoy how every video they make gets on trending. Like one of the only channels with views that are consistent with their subscribers.
suppose our body is Game of Thrones' universe, then bacterias in our gut is Littlefinger
what if bad bacteria is not bad at all, its just misplaced but still doing it's job that may cause worst. like bringing a clown to do police works...
In conclusion, the human body is fucking crazy
We are the intruders and the environment is earth's immune system. I cant see us winning this war
Bring the birds back, won't get my like until you do!
time to eat healthy i guess
Those bastards! Keep me alive longer gut damned! You will die as well if I die. Quit pro quo - I feed you the fatty foods you desire and you keep me healthy. Deal?
This just game an idea for my Masters dissertation :D
CAN WE ALL AGREE...\n\nI LOVE LICKIN THE FEMALE ANUS\n\nHIT ME UP LADIES
What will happen if my immune system can't recognize which microbiome that good or bad for my body ?
C-section birthers may have an increased chance of asthma and leukemia, but at least we can kill MacBeth.
I wonder if, when the artificial womb is perfected for use in humans, it will be possible to selectively expose the children to only beneficial microbes to avoid the negatives associated with being born via C-Section while also avoiding letting in specifically harmful microbes. Since our state of mind and health is apparently the result of bacteria essentially voting with their chemicals could we also use a microbial inoculate to produce happier more intelligent children, or to treat depression through formulated probiotics? I would be far more comfortable taking a targeted probiotic than a poop transplant.
Awesome video!
Amazing kurzgesagt
Healthy POOP transplant!
Grabbing my skinniest friend and sending their poop up my chute pronto.
Very interesting topic.
*Calls extremely fit friend*\nGimme your poop\nExcuse me?

It's not that I have no self control, it's my microbiome telling me to eat ice cream and brownies every day
I cringed watching this video so I had to hide in this comments section.
Wow, a poop transplant? I learned something new!
great work! your production team is amazing!
Individualism is overrated anyway, let's share our pain
So mad max didn't get enough mothers milk!
it's like a whole civilization in your body
O like your voice
*where are the birds?*
Maybe we are but vessels for our microbiome, and we have though that is real, that is us are our microbiome telling us to do it... Your irracional fear of the dark? Nope, your microbiome. Your fond memories of your grandma? Nope, is microbiome
Good video, but autism isn't a disease.
New series ? Pimp my microbiome?
So, what you're saying is that eating ass could possibly be healthy for you.😛😙🍑...just kidding.

I woke up one morning to find my cat making himself some marmite on crumpets.
The scream is so twisted that if you play the video from the beginning, you will not hear it.  Bit then if you skip to within 2 seconds of it, you hear it.  WTF?  I literally thought everyone commenting about Dat scream at da end, tho were trolling 😂
Have you been watching my cat? 😅
Its 3am and I can confirm this is true
THIS IS MY CAT FACTZ!!!
it is currently 3:15am rn....it won't be long before my cat does his nightly ritual of chasing his tail and running up the stairs at 500mph
To be fair, to them, its more like 9am. So... they are full of energy. Prime hunting time for the predator. Oh am I ruining the joke? Am I just supposed to go yeah lol cats r so dumb lol wut is wrong wit dem omg
Hi my name is Jack 😺 I’m A cat\n1 like 1 year old \nComment how old I am \nplease don’t kill me
That's why you throw your cat out of the house over night.
One day someone will find this comment and say hello
I hate when they cry, scream or fight scares the shit out of me
Yep. My cat definitely wakes up at 3AM, although he's not as loud as my sister's cat who rattles doors and meows loudly.
Should have fucked up your blind and bend the ends all out shape.... Other than that..... Pretty spot on............ Lol. :).
0:29 Shoulda seen that coming. I didn't. Now I'm spooked.

You're my new favorite YouTuber congrats I just watched about 60 of your videos 10/10 very entertaining great time waster
My cat does this. Im like are you hungry? You wanna go outside? Wtf do you want?????
You forgot the most important part, the stupid human (me) wakes up from the cats 3am rager so naturally the stupid human (me) goes to use the bathroom In the pitch black darkness. All while the cat hides in the shadows using its built in night vision goggles waiting for the night blind stupid human (me) to walk by barefoot so the cat can ninja attack the stupid human's (me) big toe with its freshly sharpened razor claws. Thus causing the stupid human (me) to damn near trip hitting whatever wall, table, chair, and or hard object with the stupid human's (me) boney shins or knee caps .
Dude that scream made me laugh so hard. You got another sub
Is Gus a furry or simply LARPing as a cat?

Now I need to see this through bc a stupid long peruvian add. I'm happy and sad at the same time. Such life.
I died at 12:02💀💀
Julien is such a gay ally, showing us his midriff and shit. Beautiful 😍
Must be nice to be Julia Roberts .... 😪
The fact that they did Steel Magnolias and Mystic Pizza made me so happy 😭
She´s still and always will be a PRETTY WOMAN. JULIA, I LOVE YOU
holy fuck she's done a lot of films
I Absolutely Love~ Love Julia Roberts.! I miss her.. I'm so happy to see her again.! ☺️♥️😊
I am still thinking about that giant stack of pancakes
Her film career died when she started doing drama no one remembers
I remember when eat pray love was my first like- non child movie and like my mom loves Julia Roberts and omfgg it was so good- I appreciate it now but I can't rewatch it no more
They forgot the best one... I Love Trouble!!!
still a smoke show
I love James Corden, always makes me laugh 😍😂
Julia Roberts it's a goddess! Bless her and her career!
WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW \nI never realized that I've seen pretty much all of her movies. Lol \nI saw 19 of these (yes, I counted haha)
I’ve been waiting for Wonder to be a movie for  ever
The nespresso and twin babies - I'm being George Clooney. 😂😂😂
When you realize you've watched pretty much every movie Julia Roberts has ever made!
I love Julia with my whole heart!! Thank you for so many wonderful movies!! ❤️
No The normal heart ? =(
U can keep that fat fuck , we don't want him bk
She has had such a prolific film career!  I love her.
This was exhausting watching this, I can't imagine performing all of these scenes. They didn't great job.
Ok but that stepmom scene made me cry all over again 😢😢😢
Whenever i want to watch a movie i put one of hers on. I loved this so much! Julia is queen
This NEEDS to be done with Leo Dicaprio
why have i not seen or heard of most of these movies.
Wow an actress like her comes once in a lifetime... Much like Audrey Hepburn, respectfully..
What a waste of good pancakes and spaghetti lol
Her Teeth are Amazing I could see my future in them, How can teeth be soo white the sun is jealous of them.
she has no good movies.
i love that woman
I've never heard of most of these movies except Pretty Woman.
I giggled like a schoolgirl when they almost kissed!
Hold up! Where's Dying Young???
I just realized apart from Pretty Woman & Erin Brockovich the rest of her movies haven't been big hits or that memorable, sorry.
I know they were just running through them but when she said Peter Pan my child hood just hit them feels. She was my first celebrity crush.
LOL when you actually start crying at the Stepmom part
Oh that transition into Flatliners just nailed it.
I love James Corden, but if he keeps gaining weight he'll be acting in a new movie called Heart Attack City. Everytime I blink, he's gained 20 pounds. Be careful James!
This was great she's amazing I love Julia Roberts
Loved that! Thank you! Just missing Osage County with Meryl. She has so many!! ❤️
Julia Roberts, definitely the BEST ACTRESS in my lifetime. Pretty Woman I can watch this and Erin Brockovich anytime X
They forgot a few movies. Satisfaction is one that I love.
I need this to be a series
Wow I didn't realize how many julia roberts movies I've seen
please like this video for win the competition https://youtu.be/VOfkATP7Z8M

Dog with a blog hates his race.
Lots of people whining and (somehow) unironically using the word cuck, but can any of those people refute the points made in the video? The point is t that white people suck or that they should feel bad. That's ridiculous. The point is to make people aware of the reality of our country's socioeconomic divide so that we can hopefully do something to change it. You can complain all you want, but this video simply used hard facts. Also, to clarify, in not a liberal. I just don't see wanting all Americans to have a chance as a partisan issue.
When will College Humor do a Adam Ruins Black Lives matter to expose their BULLSHIT  or maybe an Adam Ruins Antifa ???  to expose their completely hypocritical beliefs vs behavior.    COLLEGE  HUMOR has stopped being funny and become a political RANT.  I come to this channel to escape, if only for 5 minutes, the completely politicized BULLSHIT media overload to just have a laugh.... I don't come here to get your BULLSHIT political opinions or be told what to think.
Plot twist: it wasn’t a game at all but actually a recreation of true history
Kill all white people. Take those houses they stole from us!
Why do you use so much Sims 3 music???
Props to my mom then, she's mexican, we lived in west side(yes the poor ghetto side) and still managed to get me an my brother an two sister's out the hood to the suburbs.(my dad left when I was 1) \nSorry I just love sharing how my mom beat the statistics, lol
And to think white privilege is considered take. People seem to think it's a giant leap ahead of people of color when in reality it's much more subtle. In little ways here and there white people or even light skinned people benefit from white privilege.
Yeah my mother is a woman of color and she owns property in the suburbs and she worked two jobs to put me through private schools and college, so it's all about rolling up your sleeves and working hard. My mother is the true definition of a hardworking American.
Schools now are more segregated? I don't think so.
Guys, stop being so defensive. Adam isn't attacking anyone or calling all white people racist. He's just pointing out how the system has treated a certain group unfairly for years. The fact that this system is so messed up, affects us all. It's something to think about !
I missed the part on what the solution is. The only message I got was don't pretend this isn't happening and be aware. Okay, it's nice to be aware, but wtf is that gonna do?
I wish I could dislike this more than once
I love reading comments of small dicked white assholes deeply triggered by indisputable facts :))))) makes my darn day
You know that shit is f-ed up when even foreigners know that there are so called black schools in the US
Most suburbs are mostly white, did you stop to consider that maybe its because most of the population is fucking white dumbass?
God damn with this racial shit yet again.
Predominantly white schools have more funding my ass. Google the PPS school district. We have led in our water, falling apart buildings and no school funding. We are a predominantly white school, race has nothing to do with it. Shitty superintendents and school districts that can't manage money are the real problem. Not everything is a fucking race issue.
Be honest, would you want to live in a diverse neighborhood
The new deal was a plan to get America out of the depression.\nThe problem with the depression? No money\nSolution? LOANS!!!!!\n\nBut there's a catch.\nIf people can't pay off said loans, the depression gets worse. \nSo, the government HAS TO make sure the loans go to the right people.\n\nGuess which group of people, by statistical majority, has a higher chance of paying their loans and helping america get out of the depression?\nWhite people. \nAlso Jews and Asians, but at the time, were too insignificant of a population to matter really.\n\nThe government giving loans to ghetto gangsters to spend on stupid things is NOT worth saving the few blacks with the capability to pay off their debts fast enough to get over the depression. \n\nWhen the government Needs to, it will break out the racial differences and use those to solve problems.\nOtherwise, it will pretend race doesn't exist. Which is why liberals are always buttmad about the government not helping minorities. Because when push comes to shove, helping minorities doesn't help the country.
And they call liberals the snowflakes
Listen college humor I enjoy politics just as much as the next guy but seriously, this channel has nothing to do with humor or comedy anymore
The loan approval statistics are not good at all but wasn't the US over 90% white during the early 1900's?
Wow college humor used to be funny, this is just propoghanda trash. Adam DOES ruin everything
There's equal parts Asian and white in my the suburbs I live in.
All the white guys in the comments.. let me explain why this is racist against white people...
These anti-white lies spreaded through the marxist media must be stopped
Usually these videos aren't too bad, but I'm gonna call be on this this one. \nYou already mentioned that minorities are able to move to the white suburbs. Of course, like expected, they lack the money. But here's the issue, 98% of those that aren't able to move due to money are those who work minimum wage and do nothing more. So them not doing anything is just essentially giving their children a worse future. \nWhat people need to do is either get a degree in a field that on average pays either 70k+ a year or build and a business and franchise to grow their profits. Other options are self educate on investing in the stock market, real estate, or something similar. \nIts all up the people to decide whether they want to put the work in to move on up in the world.\n\nAnd no one can argue about oh I don't have thousands to build a business, people willing to work their ass off start to build their business with less than $1,000
Can someone please tell me where Adam said that all white people are racist?
this video is nothing but left wing propaganda... im not saying life is fair but come on.... im white but i didnt have some fancy school or house? in fact my school had mushrooms growing out of holes in the ceiling tiles... and on top of all that my parents (also white) did not make very much money i never had many clothes or excessive amounts of food but im doing just fine in life because i work for what i want not just sit back and complain about how life was unfair and how all the other kids had nice shit... life is what you make of it and if all you do is sit back and complain about it not being fair you wont get anything...
Thumbs up for the Sims 3 theme music :D
Can you do one on cars tail gating other cars to make them go faster?
The sims music is making me uncomfortable
Adam, you offered no suggestion to your acquaintance whom you were patronisingly lecturing to make him feel guilty when he'd done no wrong.
aren't Asians the richest race in USA? and did they get a white advantage?  or is it their culture that pushed them? hmm,m,
So how do we fix this?
Damn nigros,self-education is the only important part of education so do not blame that shit on bad teachers and I would love to see legit data about black people being discriminated in banks because It is not legal. I'd bet it is same bullshit like wage-gab between men and women where many facts are ignored to fit the narrative. Yes white male CEO of bank earns more than black female MC Donald chef... Imagine the surprise when the CEO can borrow more.\n\n2017,internet is free at most fast foods,old thinkpads cost $20-$50,if you can not get education with internet,you are just not worthy of knowledge.\n\nI agree redlining was real tho. There is still something similiar but for voters.
What a lot of you idiots don't seem to realize is you don't feel racism because you're white. Unless if you're a minority then you quite honestly don't know what you're talking about. Would you tell a professionally trained chef how to properly make a Soufflé? No? Because you have no experience in this type of shit. Just like how you probably have no experience in being treated like shit cause you're black.
Thank you for informing us... Now what :0
White people = bad \nHate this white shaming culture
Ok i just don't get why you are still guilt tripping us white folks. Yes its embaressing our past and disgusting but why are you continuing to blame us. I know this isn't the same but you don't continue to hate the people in a country that bombed us, years ago. You learn to move past it or at least don't hold a grudge on the future generations. Yes the past is disturbing but it was the past and we all are trying our best with what we have. I'm not saying its fair but instead of just making everyone feel bad as if it is still our personal faults, give us something that can help this issue and make it more fair. ya know? Also I do acknowledge poc have disadvantages but im just saying this video is making it out that we should all feel personally resposible for all suburbs being mainly white.
Crackers pulling other crackers down.  Times like these are when Im glad im not anglo.
Insufferably white? Lol fucking anti white propaganda disguised as failed comedy. \n\nI wonder how diverse adams neighbourhood is and if he'd be willing to live in a hood for 6 months... thought not.
That guy is real life Jerry Smith
History of the Suburbs
I wonder if any of these policies are mirrored in Canada...
Fix the school systems. Focus on education. Make sure your kids don't drop out. Minorities have significantly higher drop out rates and even though the school systems are the in the lowest tier, not attending at all is not going to solve the problem. Martin Luther king pushed education, don't let that die with him.
So what happened to the Asians? Why are they fine? Also the 2008 economic collapse was caused by banks issuing a lot of loans that never got paid back. If you are curious which demographic those bad loans where issued to i'd urge you to do some googling.
This is straight up propaganda and nothing else. Sad
Nice little racket. Hold Black people back for generations, them blame them for being behind. White Supremacy is a cancer.
yea i really don't care about this. sucks to be you
This should be called Adam Ruins the Democratic Party. Suburbs are not a problem per se, however the DNC has a long history of racism all the way up to LBJ, and even after. It is accurate and not an accident to point out that this policy was good ole FDRs policy that great hero of the people. Not so much.
So you're telling me a country that's more than 60% white has a neighborhood that's almost exclusively white!?!? What are the odds!!!
The Disturbing History of the Suburbs
This is so sad
I find it funny when white and Asians get scared of me out in public because I'm the most nerdy looking guy ever.
Also please don't push people to go into STEM... There is too many biology majors already. Just stop.
all the more reason for smaller government
Hey Adam... I was watching your mcdonalds coffee case and that got me thinking... Aren't you the biggest hypocrite(or something like that)? I'm not trying to be a jerk it's just a logical thing. Like lets say your boss is McDonald's. It would look like they're paying you to make this video. You exposed how cruel McDonalds have done and yeah its bad but REALISTICALLY does the earth at the moment as a whole really care? Would we all unite and try to stop it? Even you said this was one of the rare cases where a low class challenges a high class and wins. We would all just learn a fact, casually-ish tell it to our friends and go on with our lives. And it sucks because even if you're doing this out of the kindness in your heart, it's too late people are already stuck in a cycle if you think about the average life. (If i die within the next couple of day it was them)
Doesn't this segregation comment go along with the black lives matter thing? Let me just say that i see everybody as a person, i don't care what race you are, we are all just people in my eyes, your skin color has no sway one way or the other, but what most people don't understand about both segregation problems is that minorities are STATISTICALLY  bad investments and the cause of a lot of crime. Its an actual fact anyone can look up, Stereotypes normally are created based off at least some semblance of a true story and this is no exception. Mind you there are many minorities who are good investments and stay above the law, HOWEVER when a large part, if not a major majority of minorities don't stay above the law and do things like mooch off the government that creates a reputation associated with the color of their skins or their heritage. Basically if a group of people start breaking the law and a few don't wish t take part in it, they will all get punished by association with that group, regardless if they are guilty or not.
hahahaha what a funny video. love the part that when she said black people, white people
He was nice about it and didn't literally call all white people racist... unlike the last 50 people I've heard from.\n\nIt's definitely a step in the right direction.
I ACTUALLY JUST WROTE AN ESSAY ON THIS AHH
he can't buy property cause he's behind on electric bill... sounds like a personal issue not a racism issue
Yay more leftist propaganda. Yes the areas have wealth and all the other things are partially true, segregation is over and anyone can go to any school, just that they and their families don't arrange it. Whites still don't have a privilege, get off your high horses.
Don't forget Asian privilege.  Asians are doing better than honkeys.
Cool, now I feel like shit for something I didn't do. And your solution is to not close our eyes... That's great and all but how does white guilt solve anything? At least propose a solution or something that doesn't involve trashing my current life because of some leg-up that I never asked for. I get that white people are evil and all but don't just point out problems without some way to make it better without tearing people down.
Brought up a good point, ruined it with the stupid feel guilty ending
The comments are ridiculous....I don't think this was meant to be offensive guys...just to inform us on a topic we don't really know about
A lot of butt hurt white people in the comments. Get your head out of your ass and check your privilege. 🙄
Im tired of hearing abt this white privilege bullshit and btw racism for the most part is over
When I was a kid I wanted to live in the suburbs so bad. My family could never afford that though
So that's why all my neighbors are white...
My experience growing up in the burbs was nothing like this
Adam needs to lay off the twinkies.
why are they trying to make him feel guilty about it?!
poor black people have more privilege and opportunity than poor white people based on the color of their skin (fact)  but the black community wouldn't even need the advantage if we could just keep the fathers in the home and out the prison🙊
Well here's the thing, the government didn't redline it BECAUSE they were black. Probably had many people with no jobs who couldn't pay it back. Could be high crime rate. I don't think FDR did it because of their race lol
hey leftists keep making excuses for lazy kangz the rest of us will keep working hard to better our lives
To say that the suburbs are too white is like saying China is too Chinese.
Dad from dog with a blog
This video is literally wrong on so many levels...
Adam ruins youtube
Fire
What a beta cuck.
Adam should ruin YouTube.
You just got BTFO by AltHype, holy shit.
*Adam Ruins Humor*
bless this show
Great job!!!
Adam ruins Adam
jeez. i didnt realize college humur fans were so racist. thats funny.
well dam : (
Slit-eyes debunk your entire white privilege narrative. Asians outperform whites in the US...\n\nHow exactly does one of the tiniest minority groups circumvent the evil and oppressive system of privilege and discrimination? \n\nYou delusional anti-whites will just keep pretending Asians don't exist in order to fallaciously explain away racial disparities, caused in reality by the underlying biological failures of certain populations.
If you are behind on your electricity bill, then owning a house or other property is not for you. Owning home does not make you rich or hard working, but working hard and saving money makes you own a house :)
Normally the comments in these videos are fairly OK, but I guess race crossed a line. Don't read the comments. Just read about read line districts, etc. I just wish that at some point people are less ideologically driven, so they can stop attacking the work of actual researchers, facts, and reporters. It is not some left-wing conspiracy.
So, I guess the Inner City is insufferably Black, right?
This is why i only sell drugs to white folks. Im coming to neighborhood near YOU.👅
ONLY in America!
Jeez this video is getting a lot of hate but it seems to be true but hard to accept you know 😬
নতুন ভিডিও  নতুন https://www.fiverr.com/s2/63593ccb02
Have you watched chewing gum? You have the same personality as Tracy the main character and sound like her 😂😂 I love it and I love Tracy she is so funny. ❤️
😂😂-u say no unsavoury jokes then u say come through mask 😂😂-I'm 13
I’m a Christian !!! 😂 .\nI died laughing at that comment 😂 \nI’m tripophobic as well. I had to go forward a little.\nYou literally went to one of the best Sephoras in town because loads of them are way too big and you can’t find a thing when in a rush! \nFrom a Parisian living in London. Paris should be where you get your country house 🏠 😉 \nAmazing vid as per usual
Sephora is a French brand but we have almost NOTHING compared to US stores which is a shame :(
i don't want to laugh at your phobia but wtf lmao

I like your hair❤️❤️
You're accent is just magnifique
Your skin and makeup is stunning!
MY TWO FAVORITE PEOPLE IN ONE VIDEO.
I have the same fear when i see bubbles i don't know what happens to my tummy. I just thing of Freddy Krueger in that one scene when he lifts up his t shirt and those bubbles was on his tummy with all the people he killed. Crazy i know...
But Pat where did you get the top from when you're shopping in sephora!? Pleaaaaaseee 💕✨ xx
My daughter and I loveeee your videos! She's only 3 months old and she just tunes out and watches, sometimes she even tries talking to you xD
Sweetie, please read up on the mess behind the Black up brand. A black man,  a Nigerian,  had his company stolen from him from a bunch of Investors. Please don't support this company
Sephora is French but almost all of the Sephora stores are in the US :( We almost don't have any stores here in Europe.
So Patricia trending is now the norm👏🏾❤
I've had an awful week but your videos have brighten up my morning already! Thanks Patricia 💕
some of you guys have those heads that are extra large looool
i love your video, but all that screaming and faces ... please look you earlier videos. Last past videos are screaming, terrible breathing ....
I just love your videos 😍
Do you have oily skin hun? How'd the foundation wear on your skin? <3
I have that same fear !! Bees in honeycomb is the absolute worst !! Or rice grains stains in the bottom of the pot 😫😩😫
I love the look!! You've just found a perfect makeup 💄 combo!! Love love love it 😍
Patricia... no, BLack up is not french but stolen from a African man
I can't do holes either ! 😭😭
Wowah (patricia voice) lol I loved this look especially the brown lip! I also cannot get enough of this short hair on you! so inspiring !!
Patricia, would you say Zoeva brushes are worth the splurge in comparison to brands like Real Techniques or Ecotools?
I'm 31 and I also thought it looked like spooge on your face 😂
I wish you could send me that black up palette😭 😭
22 in less than a month !
Your make-up looks👌👌👌 love the lip color
I legitimately have misophonia, which is an aversion to certain sounds. I love watching your videos so much, but the sound of your camera focusing and refocusing, drives me crazy!! I’m still here though 💕
I love you!!!! You brighten up my day and i cherish all you videos. Keep doing what your good at ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Don't say it!!!!. I immediately thought what I'm sure you thought when you put the cream on😁😁😁😁😁😁
i literally have the same thing with the holes hahaha i can't handle it like, if i see a lot of small holes together i will throw up
I simply love you ❤❤❤🍉
Pat has a coin💱💱💱😂
I like before I even start the video now😂❤️❤️❤️
You are such a delight
I was hoping that setting spray didn't fk up like the one that left those white spots on your face. That was the funniest videos ever.
Love this look on you.. everything on your skin was perfect before you put the powder on but you Saved urself  after all and it suits you so well
Liked the video before I even started watching
Girl crack all the jokes you want! I'm 22 I'm ready 😂
Heyy Girl! I'm a new subscriber and I love love your channel. I laugh so hard every time I see your videos

You are hilarious!! I crack up on you from beginning to end! 😆😆😆 However you're looking flawless Tricia!!
I have trypophobia lol i get what u mean...other than that- absolitly love the look you created, u look stunning even more!
Sis, what’s the lippie that you’re wearing?
Beautiful!! I’m living for your lip combo. Made them look nice and full. Love Love Love!! 😍
Lmaoooo before you even made a comment about the mask, I was thinking about the joke 😂😂😂
Yasss all of your videos recently are hitting the trending page!

I love it when u say 'im not mad at that'
That beat and that hair...here for all of it. 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾\n\nAnd girl I’m 36 and I was like “don’t you say it Patty”!
As soon as you put on that song in the beginning the commercial came on my tv I was scared idk why
I saw you on Lydia's vlog and you were looking flawless
Patricia you looked like Santa when you put the first half of the mask on! 🎅🏾
I KNOW OTHERS HAVE PROBABLY SAID THIS ALREADY BUT I PERSONALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASUM !!!

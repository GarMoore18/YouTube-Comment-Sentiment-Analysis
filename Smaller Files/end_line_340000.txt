This is adorable Zoe and the little mermaid and seahorse are so cute. Beautiful cake. Tfs 🤗👍🏻😊👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Everything you do is so original Zoe. That's what I love most about your channel. Keep going. Counting down to your shop opening. So excited for you. Wish you infinite success. Love ya.
Thanks for the idea. It's lovely, quite easy to follow and I'm sure will take me ages 😄 x
So pretty! ❤️
Can you do a corset cake? This is amazing..
That’s brilliant Zoe! You always make it look so much more simple than it is. How many coffee slices would this cake serve?
How beautiful, just love it! How would you transport this three tiered cake to the venue?
Beautiful as always!
Maravilhoso
Just loved it
Awesome! Can you make an anime inspired cake pls? Like Inuyasha or Ichigo?
Awesome job again Zoe! Thanks for sharing. x
Would love to see you make a shark cake!
Can you plz make a slugterra cake topper because your method is very clear and I love your videos and I wanted to make a slugterra themed cake for my little brothers birthday cake! Thank you so much
wow cake sweet
Wow amazing as always you made it look so easy your so talented 😀💁🏻
Such a cute cake! I love your tutorials! Thanks for taking the time to teach us!
So so pretty 😍😍 .. Thanks for sharing
Amazing, this is such a cute cake,x
Beautiful  job!
Beautiful as always
Awesome video
can u plz do a wolfcake
perfeito
This cake is beautiful as are all of your works. If you take requests or ideas could you do characters from a cartoon called Kate and Mim-mim? There are 6 main characters, Kate, Mim-mim, Tac, Gobble, Lily, and Boomer. I think they are adorable and the colors of the land they live in, Mimaloo, are so vibrant. I think you could do an amazing job with these characters.
Y are the best cake designer .. love you from Iraqi ❤
Nicely done, Zoe! I like the textured sides made to look like waves. Those little details (and the overall artistic ability) really separates a grocery store cake vs your creations.
much puppy
Fantastic!!!!
Молодец!
Che amore !!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Awesome tutorial Zoe! This is so cute! 😋
Love your work!!
Can you make a boss baby cake ?? 😊
Now, I know it takes you more than 5 minutes to pull these things together, but you make it look so easy!  I love your designs, and this one is no exception!  <3
You are Awesome!
As always, it looks soooo amazing.
Truly amazing!
WOW! perfect cake!
We want real mermaid cake like areil
Lovely
Wow  beutifull wow exelente
Hi, Zoe. Your mermaid cake looks beautiful, just like you. Thanks again for another lovely cake.
Amazing as usual and I love that you cater for all levels of skills
That seahorse is so adorable! Zoey I've been with you for a long time now and yet you continue to amaze me with your talent, keep it up! 🙂
Yeh I'm the first
The lighting on this video is a dream. You look gorgeous, pregnancy suits you. <3
Love you Fleur! It was you that I started watching YouTube because of. Hope you're feeling well xxx
Ooh what nail polish are you wearing??
Totally impressive. ^.^
thumbs up hun 🤗 x
Love this! Would totally recommend the new Clarins cushion foundation too! The perfect finish, buildable coverage (big deal for something with problem skin like me!) and just feels beautiful on the skin! x
I enjoy your videos SO MUCH😍
<3
❤️❤️❤️
That brown eyeliner really makes your green eyes stand out. So gorgeous!
I love your makeup look it's so simple and your eyes go really well with that lip colourrrr
Great products! I'm definitely going to try the concealer and the hair spray. Thanks a lot :)P. S. You look absolutely amazing as always.
Will you ever come to Slovenia? 😊
Perfect timing for the train journey home! That Estee BB cushion is on my list!! Xx
What about your sweater? 😊
What shampoo and conditioner do you usually use on your hair?xx
So kind of disappointed because I love French Grey from Elizabeth and Jame, and I don't think you really gave it a chance. The scent smells different when you first spray it, it's a bit harsh, but 30 minutes into it it smells so much better, and delicious. But love your videos, and enjoy seeing your videos.
Fleur you're so gorgeous in every video 💕
You look lovely Fleur❤️
Nice nails
That perfume bottle was cute
Some great favs! xxx
Yay! I love favourites videos <3 :)
Hi.   Love, love love your video’s, and pregnancy updates, can u tell me what u use to curl your hair.   Thanks.  😘😘
Tell me, please, what firm and where did you buy your earrings? look very nice) Thank you for the video!))
Thanks for the reviews!  Love your nail color!  What is it?  PS, if you haven't tried Burberry Brit Rhythm fragrance, please do!  It is beautiful...im on my 3rd bottle and get compliments all the time.  😊
What nail polish are you wearing? It's beautiful! 😍
Please YouTube. Is there any way in heaven or hell that Fleur de Force does not appear on my trending list. I cannot stand her.
Having a Fleur binge tonight and the pregnancy videos are actually making me broody!! Love you so much Fleur!!😍😘
I love your channel it’s been my absolute favourite for years 😍 have you tried any of the Zoeva eye shadow pallets, I always hear so many good things about the brushes but nothing about their makeup and I would love to know!
I just saw your episode on all4 where you are cooking lasagna 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
I really enjoy how Fleur talks about products, it's very honest and light :)
Amazing! love the video!!
Hi Fleur!  Can you tell me which are the two scents you dont love as much from Elizabeth & James?  I've only ever tried the white one and love it, so curious about the rest..
Loved the video Fleur! Your makeup looked beautiful! What color is the By Terry lipstick? Was number 28 pecan nude the correct color? I just wanted to double check because it looked a lot darker on the website and not mauve (but it could be the online pictures). Thanks!
Which of the Elizabeth & James fragrances do you not like? Besides the French Grey....I find that you and I have similar taste in fragrance.... I haven't tried the amethyst one yet.... but I LOVE Bourbon
I love the packaging on the Sam McKnight hair care, very expensive and elegent looking.
I'm fairly new to your videos and am absolutely loving them! You mentioned that you usually have some go-to drugstore concealers ...and chance of a video about your fave drugstore products? ❤️💋💞
the lighting in this video is superb and it only augments your beauty, mademoiselle.
Are all the Estée Lauder eyeliners that good or just the Victoria Beckham ones???
Oooo I wanna try the new Elizabeth and James Perfume , I have two but I can't get it anywhere near me :-(
7 favs and I want to buy 4 of them now...Well 5 but I am not paying for the VB eyeliner as I think that range is overpriced, but everyone is saying how nice the eyeliner is.... Evo is an Australian brand so nice to see that mentioned!
Loving your nail polish, what is it?? ☺️
Love this video Fleur! Does anyone happen to know when the Estée Lauder BB Cushion will be available in Canada? Or if it's called something else here?
thyanks for thoughts on the new Elizabeth and James launches.  Nirvana Rose is still my firm favorite, but the whole line is incredible.  It was nice to hear your thoughts on the new ones.
I need to know what this lip color is!
Your nail polish ! 🙌🏼 what is it???
I'm surprised you liked the Estée Lauder Double Wear BB Cushion: I'm opposite on the skin- type spectrum to you- I am very oily. I've never liked the EL Double Wear, because it tends to look heavy. I find the same with the BB Cushion. Maybe I'm using it wrong. It's difficult to spread and feels drying even though I'm oily....although Instill get oily. I really want to like it. The shade range irritates me: in the UK, the lightest warm shade that can be purchased (or that seems to be in stock) is W2W. Which is like an NC25 at least; so I had to purchase from the US and have the shade lighter W1W, sent over....which is still a hair too dark for my NC15 skin tone.
You looks so pretty as always thanks babe
Love this. So excited for mini de force! Thank you for inspiring me to upload my first video X
Estee Lauder is always wonderful! I love their products ❤️✨
Hello Fleur, your reviews are immensely helpful for the beauty/youtube world. You are gorgeous and I've loved your channel for a while. xo
❤️❤️❤️ you're so sweet and so pretty!   I'm obsessed with creamy smooth eyeliners. It's so much easier to glide on
Need to check some of these out
I knew the cushion foundation would make it in your favourites, I really want to try it xx
By Terry has been on my list for ages but I can never justify the purchase when there are less expensive items I like...Though, I'm sure I'd love whatever I got and never look back!
Fleur, what Shadow are you wearing here? Also, could you share your thoughts on the new Charlotte Tillbury pallet? It looks gorgeous but I'm undecided if it's worth the cost.... thanks!
Please do a video about your ear piercings!  They are so pretty!  What jewelry brands to you love?  Thanks!
love that elizabeth & james perfume! great video! xo from my channel to your’s <3
I also love elizabeth and james perfume but it winds up trending too sweet on me.  That eyeliner looks like a dream <3
You should try some of the Korean cushion foundations (Laneige, Hera, Missha). They have medium to high coverage and still gives out a very natural finish and feeling on your skin. And color range wise, they are seriously fair/pale! Thanks for the recommendations, hopefully I'll be able to find this styling spray in Switzerland! We have Batiste, it's already a good thing!\nI legit cannot wait for the little princess to come! 😍 Sending lots of love to you and your lovely family!
You are so lovely and down-to-earth 😍 Pregnancy really suits you. Love from Finland 🇫🇮
You're so beautiful Fleur! x
Short and sweet are my ❤️
Keep well.  Thanks for the video.
I love your earrings Fleur! Where did you get them? Can I find them online? I would really appreciate it if you could answer me :)
Yours are the only favourites video I watch, love them! What are you wearing through your brows? They look more defined yet softer if that even makes sense ..?
I'm just excited for the new in October video:DD
Hi Fleur! What lip color are you wearing??
Hi fleur love your monthly favourites videos.would love to try the purfume.as always you look fab.xx😀
Literally cannot remember the last time I filmed a faves. You look great Fleur xxx
Your makeup always looks incredible!!! 😍👌🏻 As do your nails! You always have the prettiest colors on!!
I really really love this British accent, I want to speak like this, but I caaan't it's don't matching with my mouth 😂😩
Love that scent! Smells a lot like another favorite of mine, Aerin's Amber Musk (which I think I pick up after you recommended it in a video??)
Also obsessed with the new Perfume from E&J it is smokey perfection
I went to purchase the concealer but confused by the colours. Have you seen the other 2 lighter colours Fleur? I usually have the lightest shade in concealers, as I'm very fair but on Really Rees review the swatches came up looking really pink for 1, and really orange for 2. Your one at no 3 looks really light and more natural looking, is it at all orangey? Kate x
You look absolutely beautiful dahhhling!
Evo do the best blonde toning conditioner - I find that most purple/silver shampoos are a bit drying, but the conditioner is amazing and tones more than any shampoo I've tried!
I love your sweater! =)
Perfect lip color 🔥
Hi Fleur, will you be going vlogtober or vlogmas at all this year? Just curious I love your videos 😊
The sultry eye look suits you so well, beautiful ❤
your make up is beautiful :)
I'm seriously thinking about trying that cushion if they make a shade light enough for me. Hope you are feeling well. Hugs, Summer xo
No matter where I am, I always feel at home when watching Fleur's videos 💕
I found E&J fragrances in Fenwick as well.
I absolutely love these videos! Although I'm sure I say that about all videos you make😂 love you lots Fleur xxx❤️❤️❤️
👍❤️good favourites & I loved it a lot
EVO styling products are amazing! The salon I work at was one of the first to carry the Australian based line, and they knock it out of the park with styling and masks!
Aww Fleur you are absolutely beaming , thanks for another great monthly vid. I can't wait till your little one comes along sooooo exciting & there is a real baby boom on YouTube 😘💜✨😘
Can anyone explain to me what the point of the cushion in the foundation is? Is it just a gimmick or what. I got the L'Oréal one and it's useless.
Who was here before 500views
Need daily vlog...fluer...missing everyone 😍😘😁
What's the point in making the elizabeth and james perfumes exclusive to harrods? So you can only get it if you live in london or visit london? And the only way you can sample them to find out if you even like the scent is to visit the store. That's just bullshit. Who do they think they are? Do they think their product is so special and exclusive that only certain people deserve it? No way I'm buying their perfume now. We're talking about mary kate and ashley here, they need to get their heads out of their arses.
Hi Fleur would you consider doing  a video on your eyebrow routine?  They always good. Thanks.
Whats on ur nails? Have been seeing this a lot on ur videos! Thanks!
The by Terri blush looks lovely, but I can get over the fact that it looks like a nipple in the compact 🤦🏼‍♀️
Just now commenting. But as always STOP WHATEVER YOUR DOING AND WATCH. My most intrigued item on this video is the new Elizabeth and James scent. I definitely didn't care for it too much when I first smelt it but I guess I should give it another try since Fleur recommends it. Love you always.
My YouTube unsubscribed from your channel 🙁🙁🙁 not good YouTube
In general I like your videos, but I really do not like the way you use affiliate links and not marking them as affiliate links. And I find it quite strange that you link to two Estee Lauder products to two different websites instead of just linking to Estee Lauders page, its obvious that its because of rstyle.me. Its so sad, because you do this in every video and it almost feel like youre not being candid to your viewers. I hope you change the way you do the info bar in the future :)
Who else thinks it's the best song on the album?
tbh whenever i sing the partdid you see my bag in school or in public my friends always say your bag is in your back why do you keep on searching for it HAHAHA

Enjoyed watching every minute.
crazy trails.reminds me of runs in Ocho Rios ,Jamaica
We love this! Shared: https://www.imbikemag.com/mountain-bike-news/2017/09/course-preview-round-8-ews-finale-ligure-ita-2017/
Sam Hill for the WIN!!!
I have such a hard on for racing, cus its viable to the industry, and thats all that maters
Riders gonna go reaall fast on these trails. Lotsa rocks and flow.
Doing an EWS course preview on an e-bike..that's just wrong on so many levels\n\nGreat trails tho
he rode the e bike like he nicked it.some right views all the best to racers
trails look amazing ! just a thought but is the bike industry investing in advancing the wrong technology ? carbon fibre frames ,electronic controled suspension etc etc  .championships won and lost with punctures FFS  \nthe pneumatic tyre was invented in 1843 in scotland using bitumen and sail cloth near dundee .  Its mental that 170 years later \n championships in motor sport and  bike sport are won and lost by loosing air from a tyre !    Thomson was only 23 years old when he patented his pneumatic tyre. He was granted a patent in France in 1846 and in the US in 1847.[2] His tyre consisted of a hollow belt of India-rubber inflated with air so that the wheels presented a cushion of air to the ground, rail or track on which they run. This elastic belt of rubberised canvas was enclosed within a strong outer casing of leather which was bolted to the wheel. Thomson's Aerial Wheels were demonstrated in London's Regent's Park in March 1847 and were fitted to several horse-drawn carriages, greatly improving the comfort of travel and reducing noise. One set ran for 1200 miles without sign of deterioration.
great! thank you!
awesome.
Awesome, can't wait.
sick!
Enduro has it's own Claudio...
The Italian guy's awesome!
looks a lot like the local trails we have here in Hong Kong ... COOL !!
I don't get it why do you upload some here and others in the EWS channel? Such a mess this year.
E bike........gross
Oh shush I would totally watch you and mark talk about tea and builders, or like what socks you prefer or which glass you like to drink water out of and why. I AM HERE FOR THE ORDINARY BULLSHIT.
happy belated bday xoxo
Sooo flattered that my name was dropped 🙈🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 luv ya girl

Oh, and obviously happy birthday from a fellow Virgo :)
You look a bit like Emma Stone 😍
There is a Maybelline colour tattoo called 102 Fantasy that I have that looks to be the exact same colour as that Charlotte tilbury eyeshadow worth a look maybe!
Happy belated birthday so excited to see you're putting out really personable content this year 😇& a good shout out to Jackie aina is always nice 😂
I use the L'Oreal Eye Paint in Keep on Khaki as a really nice khaki green colour, I'd really recommend it, and it is nice and cheap!
Oh my gosh, TO EVERYONE WHO IS CHECKING THE COMMENT BOX BEFORE WATCHING THIS VIDEO: WATCH IT UNTIL THE END!!!!!!!!!!! 😂\nHappy birthday Anna, it has been such a relaxing chatty vlog, I adored it. X Chiara
Omg! We have the same birthday! I turned 22. I've been meeting so many people with the same birthday lately. Loved watching this. Happy Birthday, Anna! Love what you do.
Wow you're eyelashes look insane! Love the darker eyeshade too. Happy birthday Anna!! x
Virgos unite!   Was there a newsletter for September?  I am dying to see your newsletter!!
Happy birthday love! That eye shadow looks amazing on you, and Mark is right! you two chatting is quality content!
i liked those boots when you showed them the first time, but I absolutely LOVED them!!
Happy Birthday Anna, the ten spot from grammy made my day!
This vlog made me so happy x
Hey Anna! Happy Birthdaaay! A good dup of the eyeshadow i think is a Sephora eyeshadow in brown diamonds 😁 xxx
You are the loveliest and sweetest people on Earth! Without knowing you I love you you are the best 💖👌😘😉🎁👍
Happy birthday Anna!!!! 💐🎂lovely video, you and Mark are so sweet! 😍hugs from Italy🇮🇪💚
Anna try sumptuous olive from mac as a dupe and tell me what you thing
Anna! I'm curious why you never put eyeshadow on your bottom lash line? Love the eye look though! x
I'm glad you had a happy birthday 🤗
Happy Birthday Anna! I love Mark's face plant at the end 🤣
Happy Birthday, the eyeshadow looks very similar to greensmoke from mac
Literally I'm the same with birthdays! More chilled the better!
Aw, loved this vlog Anna!! And happy birthday too! xx
A youtuber you need to watch is Karima Mckimie! She's so nice and funny
So glad I stayed till the last second!
Happy Birthday! Great blog, thank you. Can't wait for the next newsletter to drop!
We share a birthday! If it was the 27th? I turned 29.... I can't come to terms with that tbh haha
Happy belated birthday Anna hope you had a lovely day
Sleek palette had a dupe! maybe the storm one? &Happy Birthday!
Belated Happy Birthday! Maybe have a look at Clinique Willow Pop as a dupe, it's also in the golden khaki colour range :-)
Anna, I love your positivity!
Happy Birthday Anna! \nI was listening to your 'At home with.. Zoella' podcast and could relate to your chat about viewers not making themselves known... I've been watching your videos for years and love your content but have never commented... So I thought would take the plunge and say Hi! (And I am totally envious of your brows!).. Rose x
Happy Birthday!!!!! I think Olive from MAC might be a nice dupe? Love your channel as well as most of the other blogger’s you mentioned!
Happy belated to a lovely lady...
Nice! And lóve the eye shadow! As for a tip for a dupe for the colour! Urban Decay Liquid Moondust (what a name 😂), shade: Zodiac!
just purchased a pair of Dear Frances boots... #annamademedoit
Happy belated birthday Anna! \nThank you for the recipes!!!! Amazing brownies!! The moment you showed them... I was like OMG I need to make this!
Happy belated birthday, Anna. Looks like you had a lovely day. You certainly seemed very cheerful and positive. I enjoyed the vlog!
happy b day! \np.s. you are so sexy with wet hair, have u ever considered trying to go darker or black?
Glad you had a lovely birthday Anna.
Ha ha ... Mark falling at the end was the best ..
24:50 is the best part
You should check out Jamie Lee from mademoiselle, she has a fashionbased blod and youtube \nand who I lately discoverd is Karenbritchick , she is amazing!! :)
Maybe Sumptuous Olive or Greensmoke from Mac is a good dupe? Great video! 👍 Happy Birthday!
a rather good egg \n\ni had quite the laugh reading your blog post today, happy birthday anna!
Happy birthday Anna! I really love how that eyeshadow colour suits you! Have you had a look at the Marc Jacobs Twinkle Pop stick eyeshadows? I saw a video yesterday and the color seems similar (they used Stardust which looks slightly more on the greyish side). I have yet to test it in real life, I will do as soon as I get to a Sephora. In the meantime, if you do test it, let me (well, everybody) know if it's any good. xx
Happy bday Anna. You are so sweet. And my present to you is Daria Androniescou's channel. She's the queen of wardrobe capsules that have loats of personality. You're welcome ;)
I hope you had lovley birthday Anna love your videos and their content. I get that warm feeling whem I get a notification of an upload 😊
Hey Anna! I'd say try MAC Sumptuous Olive or Greensmoke; they're both quite similar to the Charlotte Tilbury shade!
Happy Birthday! You're such a sweet person, I'm glad you had a fabulous birthday! Yes, we need to clone your husband!! What a super cute couple you two are!
Happy Birthday week!! You are too cute! That homemade card though:) ❤️
Brilliant video Anna, I'm so glad you had such a lovely birthday.
Happy Belated Birthday! This was a very cute vlog. I told my husband I was hanging with my friend Anna 😜 a girl can dream.
You’re such a humble person to watch and listen to. Love your content.
Happy Birthday!🎈Love your channel and your new newsletter! You deserve all the happiness you can handle.
Are those earrings from & other stories?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANNA! Lol i had a dishwasher, but my mom was always so old fashioned so we still had to hand wash dishes! oh how i hated it!
Many happy returns Anna! Loved that eyeshadow on you! I look forward to the next year of great videos! 😃🎂🍾
Happy birthday Anna!!! Very entertaining video 👍🏾
Happy Birthday dear girl❣️💐🎂🍾🥂🎁 love that eyeshadow on you !!

Happy birthday Anna! Try mac club as a dupe .. Maybe similar xxx
Happy Birthday Anna! All the best wishes! The cakes looked amazing! <3 :)
Glad you had a lovely birthday..happy belated birthday to you xx
Happy belated birthday Anna! the one from Jouer looks similar. If you want a single shade then I would go to Urban Decay in Lounge or Solstice
Bless her heart from the sweet peach palette is a khaki green. I love it. X
It's my birthday today (woohoo 27!) and I loved watching this, as I love consuming any and all of your content (fangirl, much? yes. MUCH.) But I have to say the bit in this where you mimic your dad around the baby...so freaking cute, reminded me of my parents being around babies, I just had to leave a little love note. <3 <3
Pure happiness is what this evokes :) thank you!
Best song off Painted Ruins, though there's not a bad song on the record
Love grizzly bear version of The Bachelorette starring Aunt Freckle
this is great but also what
OMG. Freckle looks amaizing!
Busy is stunning
FRECKLE!!! OMG!! YES PLEASE! ❤❤❤❤
come to Chile <3
Is David Lynch directing Grizzly Bear's music videos?
F R E C K L E
Como não gostar?\n♡\nBrazil here \○/
Is that Busy Phillips?
Love the band, love Busy Phillips, love Aunt Freckle!
YAAAAS, FRECKLE!!! 😍
Conceited comment: I prefer the strange vague (almost genderless) sexuality of Knife and Ready, Able to the new music videos. I thought the gender themes on Mourning Sound and (to a lesser extent) on this video were a bit overt, and not particularly insightful. That being said, I did enjoy this video's visual twists, and I'm pretty happy that Grizzly Bear are still in the absurd music-video game.
I adore freckle more than anyone could believe
Freckle is the gayest of all gays ever in the history or future of all gays.
Kim where's Daniel
Wish you guys would come to Lollapalooza Brazil
Crazy video, Freckle's underwater look is hilarious
YES FRECKLE YES
Freckle is a goddess
MY BEAUTIFUL DEAR AUNT FRECKLE
YAAAAAS FRECKLE! SLAAAAAAAAY
Ojalá vengan a Colombia 🇨🇴 !!
Are they all trans women ??? Yes beautiful yes
Freckle has hit the big time
God I love Busy Phillips
Beautiful !!! <3 <3 <3 Getting blue velvet vibes during piano scene. So lovely and great song.
Twenty-nine people don't have fucking ears and just watched a video with no context. To them. Just them.\nThank you, Ed, Chris T, Chris B, and Daniel!
is that David Blaine?
kim will always be a bad banana.
You guys see Ed Droste in this video?
What.\n\n\nI need context.
Come through, Freckle! You're a pizza/star! <3
Ed + Frecks. <3 And the girl from White Chicks who is throwing up while that girl holds her hair.
this is My Kind Of Content
Love love Busy Phillips, confused by vid but still ❤️

Amazing, I really Love this album and the videos 😍😍😍😍💙

I love Aunt Freckle in this
Best song on the album and catchiest tune since Two Weeks. Good Job fellas!
Wow! Great song and video! Is the blonde girl as same as the girl from Yet Again's video?
I believe vídeos are so important and grizzly bear are great on it. This is fucking art!!
Emotive...\nI feel this music. Great album
Who came here because of typing 'bear'?
Video compliments the song very VERY well! Also one of my favorites of the album. Can we get a Glass Hillside video?
How not to love their songs?
Ahhh, Freckle, my queen!

Wait what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what
O. M. G. FRECKLE!
First off please no one attack me because I am one of the biggest Grizzly Bear fans you could ever meet. \n....\nI don't understand these videos. They used to be psychedelic. I always considered grizzly bear to be psychedelic. Ready,Able is the coolest video I have ever watched whilst under the influences \n  This feels pushy. Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely in no way against anything gay. I'm starting to feel like this whole album is about accepting people for what they are. And I do! But damn I miss the Veckatimist feels.
Such a Beatlesque sound
Why am I crying in the club right now
It sounds so much like a Father John Misty song that it could be a Father John Misty song
Couldn't understand a thing, it's freaking amazing!
Is this video related to the death of hugh hefner? Both are a symbol of redefining the role of women into society. It would be nice!
Holy shit.
This album is a modern classic.
TFW you realise the singer in the clip is a guy 🤔
que mierda hace esto en tendencias
Como si el chambón fuera hermoso jajj
Gringos putos
From the bed sheets I'm guessing you're in her house... You should not be filming someone passed out in their own house and posting it to the internet.
This guy is no beauty queen himself
They both look like total shit.\n\nI dont see the problem.  They're a cute couple
Based upon his looks, his dad made the same mistake...
bet if a 9/10 female made this vid, y'alls comments would be the complete opposite
He has both the pillows and still complains.
This guy's a shitbag. He can regret his one night stand all he wants, but filming her like this isn't cool.
He's no model so im sure she regretted it too.
The geezer doesn't realise he's actually punching at his weight class. Tosser.
What an asshole.
Man the harpoons!
Such a cunt but she's ugly af
beauty is only a light switch away
Alto trauma haber estado en la cama con anto, alto calor habia
She is too Much for you
He and she are ugly. he is an ass uploading  this.  Also he is so damn stupid, he wants to be famous in YouTube because this xD
plot twist: is his wife
what that fuck is this? hahaha xd
Im so sad for her sleep with him....the guy like puppy
That smile in the end said all..
Ok last time; N O B O D Y  C A R E S. Any questions?
Dude, you can regret all you want but filming the other person while isn't awake isn't cool at all. Even if it was a girl that was filming
So is this what people refer to as the dark side of YouTube?
que paso j balvin
Tremendo tanque se cogio
shit bro xd
claaaro brad pitt
WTFFFFFF!!!!!

Ayy este j Balvin 😂😂😂

So? What is he expecting from us? A party with whores and beer? A congratulations? A  don't cry. Everything is ok? Pffft! Fucking cry baby.
If I am that girl I would regret have ugly guy next me..lol
I think people missed the point of him making fun of the pics and vids girls do of this same thing.
The guy is ugly!
but u an ugly MF
That's mostly how the population grows.
Yo no se Japones alguien me dice que dice el titulo del video y que hace esto en tendencia \nPd: Mario sube el camino
y con esa cara de pete se hace el fachero?
ni que fuera lindo
jajajajajaja no vuelve a tomar mas
a quien no le ha pasado
Could be his boss with soft skin that works at the desk all day.
I hope this guy loses his job and his life is ruined by this post.
That's why I don't drink excessively
Why is there no sheet on the mattress, and what is in his hand at the end of the vid?
He not handsome too. What he think he are top Model?! No ways 😡😡😡
Regret MY ASS! You are BRAGGING! otherwise you would _NEVER PUT THIS OUT ON YOUTUBE!_

Que mierda hace esto en tendencias
Jajaja que se hacen todos los que son buena gente a cualquiera que le pase se sentiría igual (?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA XD
He looks like a trashy hipster anyway.
Leave Britney ALONE!!!
What a horrible fuckin cunt. Shaming that poor girl while she's sleeping and posting it online is borderline subhuman in my opinion. I hope that one day you get bummed by a massive 48 inch cock and it rips your arsehole to pieces.
Noob!!!!!!
Lol
You're lucky you even got laid, Capt. Dipshit.
I don't get it? Dude your lucky to have anything in your bed when your that ugly. Your not even a 1/10.
I hope she sue you asshole.
Just say she raped you.
Si también es feo... Que drama se hace
No entendi
Is she or he?
Hahaha from the downvotes I can see a majority of salty fat girls saw this video :)
O geras čia gi Irma XDDD
two things to say here.\n1. This dude is ugly as fuck as well\n2. Someone who's ashamed of this wouldn't video tape and post it to social media
, I thought his 'date' looked like a fella either way, he has to buy breakfast.
i can't believe this mostly stupid comments. instead of ranting here, just report the damn thing to take it down. this is part of mobbing and shouldn't be here in the first place.
Pobre tipo,  mi sentidos pésame :v
Noo Jaja😂😂 Que hijo de puta
Alguien que hablé español que me explique 😂
_Eso pasa porque_ *mario no sube el camino*
Ah pero qué vivo que sos, pelotudo.
Alguien que me explique?
Our hearts go out to Mexico right now. We have some great friends in Mexico and absolutely love it there and with all of the Earthquakes we truly hope that everyone is safe and banding together. Please consider finding a place to donate or send supplies to as I know that together we can all help.
Absolutely love that you guys are making more plant-based dishes on Brothers Green! The vegans and animals are thanking you both 😄
I can see why you married her she's like the female version of you great chemistry
Daiya cheese is un-naturally flavored 59% saturated fat garbage, the manufacturing facility everyone has to wear hazmat like jumpers, boots, nets, full face respirators. Not for sanitary but for the toxic fumes mixing those flavors. Why and how? Because I live near it, I went to culinary school, I have worked in organic and natural food manufacturing of way to many foods and companies using even organic flavors, Oh man, don't believe any of that crap. You'll never find out, the bosses will even tell you not to sample flavored items that are vegan, teas, to foods or what have you. Sorry but Daiya doesn't sit right in my body or any of my vegan friends in Vancouver. Stick to nutritional cheese or Chao cheese. Ethics and manipulation is a flaw in natural foods. I see foods in stores that are expired and were once moldy and are passed as organic. Even in multi-national or International franchises, to amazon to major grocery chains.\n\nI have yet to meet one ethical and transparent organic company In the west coast of Canada. They are slave owners and like to say everything is organic and have paid off health inspector informants. Shall I retrieve my emails after great concerns and complaints of many employees I have worked with. Never trust any food manufacturer. Unless you see how it is made, we are blind to this yes. But stay as natural as possible, open kitchen restaurants and farm markets. I rather spend more and help smaller folks out then greedy corrupt families or elitist companies only for corrupt greed. The stories I could tell you folks over the last 5 years working with making natural and organic foods.
The construction of your pile of nachos was euphoric to watch
I like your recipies, i´d love to try the vegan nacho cheese, on the other hand, i would like you to know some things becuase those are not mexican dishes, those are TEXMEX. We dont use yellow cheese, we dont even eat nachos (as a mexican dish), for us nachos are an American thing, adding beans is also a Mexican stereotype. Pico de Gallo uses Serrano pepper, not Jalapeño, but thats ok. \n\nThe way we eat tortilla chips is just with smashed beans with queso fresco, or in a soup.\n\nMost of the time our quesadillas uses Oaxaca cheese or quesillo, that is white. \n\nThats all, hehe... thanks for posting this video, and being aware of the last eartquake, we apreciate it.
I am not vegan, but I eat a lot of Vegan food, and those Nachos were the truth. Would eat those without worrying about meat any day.
Best. Compilation. Video. EVER. 😍
Looks great my brother 👍 me as a Mexican that looks amazing
Where do you buy your squeeze bottles? This was fantastic!
Jackie seems like so much fun!! I'm not vegan but I want to try some of these recipes! They remind me of the recipes on Hot For Food's channel
Totally awesome video guys! Thank you for making a vegan video! Rock on
Hope you're enjoying marriagehood!! I adore you guys!\nI'm excited to use my face to press some homemade tortillas tonight! Lol!
Why do you put gluten free and vegan together?\nIt's not by choice that we don't eat gluten, we're just super sick when we do.
VEGAN REVOLUTION
Looked amazing!!! Yum
Fuggggggg. YES!
She's awesome
Nachos aren't Mexican god damn it
an amazing wife = an amazing life
YESSSSSSSS
I love it when youtubers bring their partners on!!
😮😋
Yaaaay vegan stuff !! Big up for that ! <3
Damn, thanks!
How about showing some recipes that use garlic confit?\n\nI could take it or leave it with the vegan thing, but I'm sure you can come up with a lot of stuff that uses a great (vegan) source of savory flavor in a creamy package.
Yay! More vegan videos ❤️🌹
Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!
Josh is going SUPER SAYAN!!!
Everything looks so fresh and delicious, you guys did a great job! I can't wait to try all of these recipes this weekend :)
This video is amazing, really inspired me to give some effort to make a dinner like this some point in the future when the moment arrives. Love it!
I have had a can of jack fruit for a year, but none of the bbq recipes look good to me.  This one you did looks amazing, it's got the look of what I love.  Thanks!! I subscribed to your new channel nut you are not on my feed, weird.
This channel is starting to tap into the vegan hell on youtube. It's been an hour and I already see comments lecturing people on why eating meat is morally wrong and that you should be ashamed. Next we will have vegan gains community coming over.
where I live, Nacho chips are way cheaper than make your own with tortillas
The Perfect Complement...so delicious...I would love to see an ingredient list? I don't know what I have on hand and what I would need? can I gather it all in 1 week? I think first and foremost I will try NACHOS! Gonna be S.O. G.O.O.D! Great Ideas!!! ; )
My father taught me about Hanuman when I was a small child, Namaste to the two of you.
More vegan videos! Great content <3
Your wife is really cool, you guys are great together on camera :)
Love ur cooking
Love you guys (:
great vlog
Very nice
It's funny to hear people say jajaja with the J when it's hahaha in Spanish lol idk I think it's cute I went there with my boyfriend(I'm vegan he isn't) he and I loved it so much I love mexcain food. The machos were the best.
i would love to know how you make eating work in the home, is there twi meals going around, or do you just eat vegan at home? epic recipe!
can't believe how big your channel has grown!!
Not vegan, but am excited to try the crema and the chips!
Amazing! THANK you for posting this! :) Looks absolutely amazing!
Why does that Jackfruit look like shredded chicken though!!!
why would anyone eat gluten free if you dont have to? I mean vegan or vegeterian does makes sense but gluten free?
Crazy how the cheese sauce still manages to get that bright yellow queso colour
Wtf is wrong with your hair cut?
My kind of video! I am always making Indian and Asian foods. Been needing to open up my arsenal
I love that you reach out to vegan audience with this kind of videos. this shows how much the channel has grown and yeah if you always stick to the same thing it will be boring, right? also I don't have access to daiya here so please make a video on how to make vegan cheese!
I don't know man, I love Juanita chips.
The Mexican corn is actually  put into the grill with the leaves. When the leaves burn turn black you remove them. When you peel them they will be July and a tiny bit burned. Lmk if you try it this way
I also really like your wife, she's just like you it's awesome, love the video too might try a few
Wait... if he's gay, what's with the wife? Lol
she is the female version of him. its amazing to watch them 👀
You two compliment each other in the most lovely way. Great Friday video!
It’s so sad that corn tortillas are so expensive around here
PARMESAN CHEESE DOES NOT GO ON A STREET CORN
As someone with renal problem, this recipes are very helpful. Subscribed to your new channel.
very interesting and unique ideas ! thank you :)
I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT JACKIE BACK! I commented on another video asking you to bring her back because she is just so fun and relatable!  Thanks! I really enjoy watching you guys! Brothers Green plus 1! :)
can you put the ingredients in the comments please?
If there ain’t meat it ain’t Mexican
They're plenty of authentic mexican dishes that happen to be vegan also- Check it out.
Thank you so much for including more recipes. I remember when you guys asked me on Twitter if I'd like to see more WFPB or Vegan recipes, this was back when I first transitioned into the Vegan lifestyle. September 2016 I made the switch. Everything has been amazing. Thank you for still providing many amazing recipes. Have a lovely weekend!
great video!!!  ( as always)
LOVE YOU MAN LIKE IF U DO TO!!
they're too gonna make some babies soon
This is so awesome that you released this today!!! Im releasing my Brothers Green BGBQ vegetarian tacos video today!! YES!!
Bless
Also you guys should try just getting tomatoes and cucumbers, quick chop salt, lime, cilantro. Man it's amazing with anything!!
What happened with meat
YASSSSSSS <3
Ugh a video with this woman again! Her constant hand talking and awful use of words, cringe of the worst kind! Where is the other brother 🤷🏽‍♀️
Love it guys!
Married ?
Thanks for checking out this video! You can click here to check out our new channel, all plant based recipes that give you all that glorious taste, minus the meat.
I don't know what others think, but seeing the cook actually eating and reacting to what they have prepared is 50% of what I wait for. That tells and sells it all for me! Thanks for another great video, but please, no more censoring the eating! :)
I live for your slo-mo shots!
Thank you for this! Jackie is awesome sauce and I can't wait to make some of this.
Fantastic! Thank you
When I see Jackfruit in the grocery store I'm intimidated by the size of it. I'm single/live by myself, so I don't usually buy stuff like that unless I really like it and will eat it right away or can preserve it by freezing it. Can someone make the Jackfruit meat in this video and store (by freezing) for later use? I saw another video on the munchies YouTube channel where a guy made a BBQ vegan sandwich out of smoked trumpet or king oyster mushrooms. I'm highly intrigued by it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWMIpdhlVZY&t=75s
Awsome!
dude YES
This is a crime against mexican gastronomy
Wow.. Ruining food 101....
Absolutely love this video! Just wanted to add in that Diaya while it is vegan they just switched over and sold out to a company that tests on animals! Just wanted to let you guys know because I know it bothered me when I found out, I didn't know if Jackie is aware of this! But there's so many other vegan cheeses which are even better than Diaya in my opinion like Follow Your Heart and Chao!
I'm mexican and I aprove 100%, I love it when people from other countries try to recreate our food. It was also very nice to see you make your own corn tortillas, keep it going guys👍
how long do you think it is safe to keep the cashew sauce in the fridge ? if I make it I will not eat it all in once I think
I really do not like Vegan food and straight plant based recipes but, I respect other people's choices! Rad video, as per uge! You guys are awesome together. 😊
Hey where do you guys get permission to use those songs from sound cloud? I'm really tired of the YouTube royalty free tunes. Thanks!
How long does the vegan cheese and sour cream last in the fridge? Can I freeze either? Would love to make in large batches so I can save time/money
Making my MMA debut next Saturday. My dream is to become world champion. Follow my journey much love
OMG that all looks amazing. Especially the Jackfruit tacos. I am extremely allergic to poultry, eggs, feathers.....the whole nine yards. we are fortunate to live on a farm, so mainly everything comes straight from the Animal or the ground here (with a few exceptions, lol). My husband says we do not do vegan but I so could. I am going to try to trick him with this. Yumm
Super spicy sauce you'd die if you tried my moms.. let's say if you add about 8-10 habaneros not deseaded, 2/3 tomatoes roast them, add garlic onion and salt.. That's it lol won $100 from my uncle to eat 3 spoonfuls I had a swollen tongue but worth it lol
Mates if science and world history has taught me anything is that just because you can doesn't mean you should. Do not mess with perfection, y'all went too far with this one.
I remember the times when the food recipes included some meat. Nothing against vegans, but I didn't think this channel would turn towards vegan foods as often as it does.
Dear Everyone, apologies for the volume of the music. You're right, it IS too loud. That's my bad! I hope you can cope and it doesn't put you off too much because I can't lower it without removing the video and losing all of your lovely comments. So I promise to not do it again next time if you promise to forgive me and watch this video anyway! Xxx
So funny recipe :D and so funny name...flumps! Thanks for sharing this incredible recipe :)
damn that background music is loud, it's really too bad, i can barely hear you
my new favourite non swear that sounds like swear word.\nwhat the flump is that??? i dont give a flump!!!  get the flump out of here!!! haha love it already
Great video,  but I think I'll just stick with buying them ready made ;)
Plz can you do a lemon sherbet recipe
You should totally do merch!!!!!! Imagen it!
I used to get called Flump at work because my hair was pastel blue, pink and yellow and it looked like a Flump when I braided it! :)
You look like Grace vanderwaal all grown up
Nice editing and a really nice recipe! You guys are awesome! X
Great to see how they’re made but there ain’t no way that I’d go through all THAT palaver for some flumps!!!
Flumps is a fun word to say. Flumps lol. Also, I don't really like marshmallow but I kind of want a flump now lol.
Nice Maddie Style top!!👚
Omg it's soooo pretty
Tuck Shops ya! 😊
Jaffa cakes ❤️
I love British accent
Yummy yummy yummy.
Hi
I MISSED C&D HQ!!!!
can u make slutty brownies? but like reeeaaalllyy full on ones with like pretzels and honey combs and marshmallows and sprinkles???!!! Xxxxxxxxx
like it
so 24 grams of gelatine.
These look amazing on gingerbread houses.
Flumps look so fun!
ja ja jemma pretty nice recipe
Please do a kinder bueno cupcake emma 😍😍😍
Yor background makes me jealous 😢.
They're 60p in home-bargains.
Sprinkles!
Rum and raisin fudge 😍
MashAllah
Malteases
Love the commes des garçon top
Can you please do a milk chocolate ganache recipe
Think I'm gonna go hungry even after lunch 😅
Are there vegetarian options? Can I use AgarAgar instead?
Where to store the marshmallows to rest for 24 hours ? In the refrigerator or room temperature
i love it! do you run a store? you have so many candies behind you
Hey Jemma! Could you PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a Biscotten Torte? It's a great cake that tastes amazing
Please make cakes based on Indian theme,green tea & red wine please
Love your videos Gemma, u are the best
What type of powdered gelatin is used?
hard candy ribbons like the kind granny had in the glass jar around christmas time
Really pretty, but I don't really understand why you'd want to eat that.  Lol. :)
I just want to make regular marshmallows, can I skip the glucose since I'll melt them?
Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers!  :D I've made your marshmallows so many times (including for my sweetie table at me wedding) and they've always turned out great.
I like flumps but that’s a lot of work and I’m lazy😝 cya I’m off to Tesco
Why would you not just buy flumps? Sm better and cost like 5p
Yeah Gemma, the music is a distraction and a bit annoying.  When I watch your videos I want to relax. Your choice of music on this one is a bit fast, perhaps more appropriate for a work out. Love you anyway xx
which company do you get your sprinkles from in the background? or could you recommend somewhere please! thank you :) and loved the video
Jemma you're the best!! These are absolutely adorable <3
if you don't have friends lmao
Where i come from we call them wiggles, aaaannd they’re covered in chocolate!
That marshmallow u ate was so from today or the batch u just made.
I remember twisted coloured marshmallows but never called them flumps...then again I’m from Australia so probz different name
Not as easy as it looks
Hey jemma! I really loooove your videos , I'd like  to know wich Brand are your spatulas and bowls? Please let me know 😊....
This must be a British thing, haha
I loved dots when I was a child. Colorful and so much fun to tear off the paper and eat
that background music is too loud
Loved the vid but the music too loud over your voice.
If your going to learn one candy recipe this is the one to learn. So nice and yummy. Nice video, Love all your videos
And where do I store them, in a paper bag or a plastic one?
@CupcakeJemma I use to have nougat with jube pieces in it. Maybe you can make that for one of your episodes. 😊😊
Cupcake jemma a very very important qns \nIs it possible to over whip butter? And make it spoil or something by making too pale?
Your phone case so pretty 😍
What's your star sign
i love it so much
Can you swap the gelatine for vege - gel?
we call these spekkies in my country!
Love it so much😱❤\nPlease you can do video on mirror cake?
you are so quick bae
I absolutely love your videos. You give me such inspiration for me to get in the kitchen and make some of your recipes. Thank You so much.😀💜
These look so delicious except I can't find powered gelatin anywhere!!! Pls help!
I missed Cadburys Spiral bars. Made great straws to drink chocolate milk with
I use to eat those when I was 2 years old and I don't see them any more and they taste so good they are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait to see what you're going to do for halloween this year!
Highkey can't wait for all the halloween masterpieces this year😭😭😭😍
I love how the entire table ends up pure white from the icing sugar/corn flour mixture. That's definitely a liberal application! (And makes complete sense, marshmallows just get so sticky.)\n\nAlso, yes, we should all take tea breaks while baking!
In the netherlands that’s called “spekjes “
Sick video can you do a recipe on a classic millionare shortbread thingy😂... Please\nAlso are they worth all the effort
you hsould do a video on popular childhood sweets- maybe fruit winders? i know they could be quite simple but i am really interested to find out
HI JEMMA❤❤ I love your videos so so much!! Lots of love from Mexico 🇲🇽✨🎉 btw can you make some macarons please!😄😍😘
Love your video's but I have one complaint.  Please either remove the back ground music or at least lower the volume.  It interferes with your talking. Again, I love your video's!
Any one else notice how perfect and equal Jemmas were compared to the other girls (5:19) lol you can tell she's a master!!!
Looks so difficult but fun to do lol \nThanks for your video
Will it work the same with vegan gelatine? X
The music is really off-putting :(
Is that merchandise jemma?!?
My gran used to make pralines they were so rich and creamy! She would make vanilla ice cream also, every summer 💕
Please make something eggless!!
Yeah cos we've all got a 6ft long work counter..
Hi jemma. I tried this reciepe and the smell and taste of gelatin was really overpowering.. it smelt plastic-y and was just strong.  i added heaps of vanilla but that didnt help. Any tips to change that?
Great recipe but the background music was a terrible idea
I have always loved flumps but this is a hard recipe for my hands (I have rheumatoid arthritis) maybe I could find someone to give these a try for me. I had some shop bought ones not too long ago and they were nasty I couldn't eat them they weren't proper flumps.
Where did you get your cell skin?
Ok, first there was the kitchen towel (mega cool) and now the cell phone case 😍 !!! Looks like Johnny cupcakes designed it (correct?). Was this designed specially for you, or is it available in his shops? Love your videos :) all the best from Germany
Or just go to Tesco's and buy one for 10p

lmao let's feed them to the neighbors
All of the food you have cut with the laser (looks like) it taste disgusting because everything just turns out burnt. So that made me think, what foods actually taste good burnt? Marshmallows.
Make bacon with a laser next please
I just spent more time watching a Shaw unlimited data plan ad than I did watching the video
The real question is can the laser do ASMR
It kinda looked like styrofoam

Do you want a bag? I like potatoes
Hey William, i have suggestion. Coming from your Wallace and Gromit video you did with Binging with Babish. You should make a handheld gun/launcher out of a toaster, that will fire toast. Doesn't have to necessarily toast the toast before it's shot, but you do you.
MAKE A HAND HELD LASER CUTTER
I think it would be cool to see you make a plasma popper!
Can it heat up a cup of tea...
You should try and cook a laser breakfast. Try and cook the eggs and bacon. Also try and toast a slice of bread

Why is your house only like one room
Hey will you send me nothing in the mail
Farming is STILL in early access, ugh!
You forgot to mention the real solution - vertical farming...
why you stop making paper plane tutorial ? start them again
Since doing this would also take up way more space, and we would run out of land to feed our increasing population, the only way to solve this would be mass genocide 90% of all humans, leaving plenty of room to feed us :)
You Stupid woman, we are recycling the crops already. We make seed of the harvestet crop.
I love the pokemon references in almost  every video.
Just realized Alex, Henry, and Peter were siblings
shit like this will never work in china and india or africa, they are starved and poor as shit (most of the farmers are at least) the people who are involved with farming in poor and overpopulated areas simply will not care. they need money and socioeconomic status, they will do anything to get it
More likely we will move away from plant and animal farming altogether in the latter part of this century and start to manufacture all the plant and or animal proteins and nutrients we need directly via molecular manufacturing. I know enormous vats of artificial meat or plant matter sounds gross and dystopian, but climate change is going to start hitting agriculture really hard in a decade or so
I'm probably gonna get attacked saying this but, vegetarians stop being pussies and eat a steak, there just animals and they'll reproduce. If one cow dies another one will take its place.
farming is not broken it's the population sustainability.
In a few hundred years, humanity will be dead from climate change, so who gives a shit about fucking farming. \nSo pig out motherfuckers and burn this fucking planet into the ground, fucking filthy bastards.
Did you try restarting farm ?
Omoshiroi
And how about combine harvesters having to harvest 1 type of plant at a time when more plants are in the same square foot?
Farmers used to leave 1/3 of the farmland fallow so that it could replenish the nutrients. Perennials would just sap all of those nutrient! Genetic engineering isn't going to erase the average plant's need for essential nutrients and minerals.
There is a basic arithmetic issue that nobody will address because it hurts feelings. Perenial grains and such are cool and all but permaculture simply cannot sustain the current population, their is a basic limit to the rates of the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles. Resources are being depleted simply because the current population is not sustainable and we require maximum production per acre. The earth has about 5 billion people more than can be maintained at the current first world standard of living, we only get away with this level in the short term by using up our long term savings.\nOn top of that there are major process engineering issues around mixed crops. Hand labor is not compatible with improved living conditions. The ability to batch process provides a major means of controlling diseases and pests in a field. \nMaybe when it finally becomes acceptable to acknowledge that not all opinions are valid or deserving of respect society can make some progress. It will likely be a day late and a dollar short however. Simply put not all people should have the right to have kids, and being anti-birth control is logically equal to advocating for children to starve to death in a few generations. Now there are fools that think they will end resource scarcity via various methods, yet even at that fanciful extreme end(and ignoring the limit of light speed) it would only be 8000 years at the current pop growth rate before every particle in the current observable universe is part of a human body.
MinuteEarth i would love to know how you get your info
Never before? Okay, maybe not on a large scale like you said, but I can't be the only one whose elementary school taught them about Native farming techniques that replenished nutrients in the soil. The Three Sisters was a proven farming technique that Europeans destroyed when they came to America.
PERMACULTURE, guys, why aren't you talking about that? I don't get it.
If we eat less meat we'll have to grow less soy/grain to feed farm animals. No-one wants to give up burgers though :(
Next 10,000 years !?  It would be a miracle to get another 1000.
While this is a legitimate concern and possible problem, I don't see that it's an urgent problem, as long as we let the market help us decide which farming and food production systems are more valuable and worthwhile to us.  \n\nI see some commenters saying big Agricultural businesses won't allow more sustainable processes to be used.  But this is why we need to allow the market to work and not let government intervention limit competition.  Ultimately, it's the consumers who decide what is most produced and with more competition, consumers have more say in the production process.  \n\nFor example, you don't like GMO crops?  Fine.  Let's label them, and then we'll see quantifiable evidence that tells us how much the public is actually concerned about GMO's, instead of listening to special interest groups making political statements. Who knows, the results might surprise me as well as you.
Wait, this doesn't feel right...\n\nOf course! It's MinuteEarth.\nI thought it was a MinutePhysics video.
We'd just have to slash and burn every remaining forest and replace them with our own balanced ecosystem to feed half the world
The problem is with human and not Earth or farming. South Asia and Africa will add 3 billion people by 2050
Your voice is putting me on edge
Harvesting would be made incredibly difficult, thus lowering yields and raising costs. Its nice to be idyllic but we need the money in order to achieve that. Another thing we need to worry about is that those lower yields would impact the poorest the most. In the end we would simply need more land, more effort, and higher costs for the same result. We just aren't forward thinking enough as a species to pull that off.
Farms are not working out well in recent years because we stopped puting animal shit in them. And that breaks the cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/user/MinutoDaTerra  this channel translates your videos\nhelp them
what about fogponics?\nThe idea is that you mist nutrient water into plant roots, which is way more efficient than hydroponics.
Hippy BS
So vegans are bad for the planet and I should keep eating meat? Got it.
1:05 starv3
Easy, get a replicator, or just go down to Quarks.
That space will not be a good ecosystem. Let's farm stuff underground by pumping sucrose into genetically engineered plants  and use the above ground space for mostly nature and humans.
The invention of agriculture was a mistake.
none of this is true I live in the farming capital of america if youve eaten lettuce in america it came from Yuma az. farming is ahead of the game, this is all horse shit. Stupid propaganda,
Food forests 👍🏻\nFruit is the best thing to eat anyway ;)   Good fruit :)
Hi minute earth, this reminded me of a farming technique called aquaponics, which uses 95% less water than conventional farming. It would be really cool I'd you guys did a video on that
Earth is still on beta test so give Jesus some break.
The key to more efficient and environmentally-friendly farming is (and always has been) technology.\nThere is a misconception among non-farmers that 'organic' farming has less of an environmental impact, when the opposite is true. The ability to get amazing yields using less land, less equipment, and less diesel is why technology is so important to agriculture, especially sustainable agriculture.\nWhen people rally against safe and proven agricultural technology such as GMO's, they aren't just trying to make agriculture less efficient; they are inadvertently making it harder to feed the world and save the environment.
Let's just become hunter-gatherers again
uhh..ok
Jesse Agar from This Place was the guest artist!
why is moon white?why do cat say meow?why are we called humans?why am i asking stupid questions?\nok im done bye
Well, I'll finally achieve my weight loss goal :D .. And die
Hey, look at that, a millennial way of pushing GMO's. Profiteers broke farming.
I was hoping that this video was going to discuss aquaponics. I see a sustainable future there.
all of this has been tried and failed and many died of stavation. what a load of crap. all wishful thinking and no science.
Drug suppliers are pioneers of these techniques
If you do that mixing of natural habitats with plantations some species will begin to take advantage of the huge amount of protein and energy in the human crops and pesticides and other undesirable methods will have to be used. I think it is a stupid idea. The only possible approach to all these problems is to reduce the global human population to acceptable levels, especially in China, India and Africa.
To keep up to date with agriculture technology. I recommend this podcast, Talking Biotech.\nhttp://www.talkingbiotechpodcast.com/
How TF are we losing dirt?! If it blows away then wont it just fly into another field?
Ok but doesn't that make harvesting 100 times more difficult?
...Always has been? Historically, farming founded the entire history of mankind lol. Your suggestion that the whole (farming) world simply give up their trade and move on...is about as condescending as my suggesting you take a deep breath and consider the livelihood of billions of people across, erm, planet Earth. A (very well researched!) scientific approach to global issues is indeed brilliant but the way you point it out suggests a this is fact, therefore you change approach. Your ideas work in theory, just as farmers own realities work for them, in practicality. Try analysing wealth distribution - if you really want to rock the world :)
Bugs, im calling it right here, the answer is bugs. Eat lots and lots of bugs.
farming is broken because not enough modified plants are being grown?\n\nseriously?\n\nmy bullshit detector is going off....
I have been hearing about perennial grains for a long time. Where are they? What is stopping you? You can splice the DNA of anything into anything else. Do it! Stop procrastinating! \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
We wouldn't have to farm so intensively if the grind to get to old age wasn't so bad. Have you seen how many calorxps you need to get to level/age 80?
Lazy farmers 500 years ago..: Lets delay this like ppl will do with Half-life !
This is why veganism is bad.
Permaculture
For all the people mentioning hydroponics as a solution: It doesn't solve the problem that nutrients aren't being recycled.
This self sustaining system dose not exist on a large scale. Or world wide scale
Ok, so stop breeding in excess of two children per two adults
It's not easy to switch crops it will consume a lot of land and give a small harvest it will also attract more pest to the land so I don't think farmers will adopt it very quickly specially in India
So when we mow the grass, we harvest off wheat ears?  Makes sense to me.
Trump 2020.  Make America great again, again!
2:16 I want a fruit vac
Better idea: Use gene editing to grow meat on trees. And no, I am not joking.
Yep, vegans are destroying the planet.  That's what happens when a bunch of people force themselves into an unnatural diet.  Honestly, though, if people would stop freaking out so much about synthetic foods, we would not have problems like this at all.
Oh shit Interstellar is coming closer and closer to us
Piss off hippies. I will run my big ass truck all I want
Holy shit, someone better tell the thousands of generations of farmers since antiquity that a science YouTube channel has it all figured out.
The name for what this video is about is permaculture.
Well I'll be dead who cares
This is going to fail spectacularly if anyone tries to adapt this to a larger scale than what would be required to sustain a small township. Not saying it isn't a great idea, just saying it ain't feasible at this point. Not sure if they've noticed but creating thriving self-replenishing eco-systems is really, really hard and keeping a precise balance that maximizes our food output against competition from the symbiotic flora and fauna, as well as pest species, would be a whole new kind of complicated and labor intensive on a large scale. Upside is it would probably create a lot of unskilled jobs in the agricultural sector as it would make the high volume use of pesticides and herbicides nigh impossible due to the risk of harming the species that you want to keep around, meaning you will need people out there targeting specific problem areas until we can replace them with drones. Unfortunately that means your already inflated grocery bill is gonna grow a lot bigger.\n\nThis is going to look great on paper and in small scale experiments, it's definitely going to have its partisans.
One day we may have to switch to genetically engineered algae with all of the essential proteins and nutrients in it grown in large vats and shape to look like normal food kind of like what they do with tofu. That's just an idea
Current farming techniques are seriously damaging to the environment, sure. But the problem we face is that any proposed replacement technique will need to produce an equal or greater amount of food within the same time-frame, or huge numbers of people will starve to death. I've seen lots of neat, eco-friendly ideas talked about, but many of them just can't guarantee that they'll be worth the investment of time and resources they would require. We can't afford the death-toll that would result if we changed the systems we know will keep us fed, only for the new idea to fall short. Unfortunately this is a problem that is likely to remain with us for a long time. Looking to nature for ideas is great, but the environment doesn't produce the amount of food we need naturally. The real issue is that Humanity seems to have grown beyond nature's capacity.
Hi, I am a farmer and I just wanted to say that farmers are working on this. There are some farmers that are not changing but many, especially young farmers, are coming up with ways to solve many of these problems. I do not think perennial crops for grain production is the answer. I do believe cover crops and inter seeded cover crop in between annual cash crops like corn and sunflowers are the future. Thanks for the interest in this. I suggest watching any of Gabe Brown's videos on his system if you are interested in what is currently being done.  Thanks
As a farmer (of course I watch YouTube while on my self driving tractor), I can confirm this is an accurate video. \nLots of people working on applying new and old solutions to some huge problems. \nI'm making improvements as fast as I can justify the expense of crop failure when trying new things.
Farming is as broken as Donald Trump's mind
Never take more than you can give back.
But growing use-plants alongside other plants makes these others weed, which are bad for when it's harvested and needs to be sorted through.
The world won't be here in 10000 years dumb bitch.
Have to fix the anti-gmo folks first.
Permaculture. Problem fixed.
go ahead, MinuteBollocks, recycle your resources - EAT SHIT!\n*eating this shit video doesnt count.
minecraft already knew this
Go Vegan :-)
MOAR GENE EDITING
less babies = less mouths to feed = less agricultural degradation/deterioration
MAKE FARMING GREAT AGAIN
America alone produces enough grain to feed 10 billion people, but most of it is fed to farm animals instead and nearly half of the remaining food is wasted in other ways. People are starving to death right now because you choose to eat meat, wasting all that grain
Idea,kill the weak and dumb,if you are  the weak or dumb, get killed and your bodily nutrients get recycled for the farm that the strong control.over time there will be two kinds of humans that are not allowed to mix,the strong build cities and farm,the smart control goverment and money,the strong and smart are the top people that do complex working tasks such as build rockets for the colonies to other planets.the strong will be able to vote and be paid the same as the smart,they will just have the labor intensive jobs.this is my ideal goverment and world.
This is the first comment I've made on youtube. I thought more of the videos coming from this channel but i have to say, this is pure ideological conjecture. I work with the public in a town heavily saturated with agriculture and farmers, and I take offense to the broad strokes being painted here. I have learned enough with my own eyes and my love for the history of agriculture to easily argue just about every point made here.

I love cooking for friends and fam. But not when I’m by myself... Please do a video (or two) about recipes for one. Not too many ingredients and leftover food would be great too! #happysingle :)
Man, I was right there with you guys until you went to #PruneTown. 😂😂😂
I seriously think that Ben's idea of quick and easy means you don't have to grind your own wheat for the flour.
Who the hell thinks destoning apricots is difficult? 😅
OK, random challenge idea. The normal people cook and the chefs judge, but the chef's do not know what the secret ingredient/inspiration is.  This way the normies have to come up with (probably with viewer help) an inspired recipe that they make and the chefs have to figure out what the inspiration was based off the dishes. A  challenge all around.
I love the look on Jamie's face when he gets to do the This is our........sorted!. That's the joy of cooking right there.
Jaimie did the thing Jaimie did the thing!!
I knew it. I knew no matter what, Ben wouldn't have given a 10/10. That look on his face though, was priceless.
Now that's brilliant!
This looks really good! I'm going to make it next week, and might add some barley in there somewhere. :)
WHERE IS hello, and welcome to fridgecam...?!
6:13 Is it really a technical word or did ben just make that up 😂😂😂😂
Ben is like the professor I had last semester. You do everything perfectly to the standard they requested, and yet ... A-
**englishly and sadly** you could miss out on double cream altogether
A lot of fucking effort for an effortless meal.
I'm so proud
He didn't salt/pepper both sides I think D:
You guys should make poulet-frites. Basically rotisserie chicken with a bed of potato/fries underneath to catch the fat drippings and other deliciousness from the chicken
Don't worry Ben, I can give you the other half an inch.\n\n*sorry, it was sitting out there*
what would be a good substitute for prunes?
Can not believe the amount of 'je ne sais quoi' you shoved in there...
guys if you want to eat healthy and save money delete Food app from your phone
Could we do a student meal week please? like quick and easy meals for one that are also healthy-ish and cheap? :)
Do a segment of different kinds if food from ancient times please!!!
This is great, definitely going to try this out. Would love to see more!
This was great. Can we have more like this? I don't like sweets very much and I feel like there's been sooooo many desserts on this channel lately haha.
Are prunes needed to Chef all over the place?
They are so attractive!!! Single?
How is Jamie still so useless 😂
Make a series called mid-week meals! Seriously need more of such recipes for my own mid-week meals
I still watch most of the videos on this channel, even though I am a very picky eater and find a good 85% of the recipes disgusting. The boys are so entertaining, and even if I don't like a recipe (eg, fruit paired with meat.. NOPE!), I still get ideas from recipes and incorporate them into my own cooking. <3 you guys!
Ben was on fire today!
Amazing, thanks! But can get a super fight with a lot of beautiful men, please. Like have Tom Daley again and his hubby Lance Black and form two teams, like for Halloween!!!!? Because that will be Epic!!!! Please!!!!
need more of these types of vids :D\nnice and easy meals but still gorgeous
I love recipes like this! Is it possible to see some more autumnal recipes that can be slow-cooked? I work most of the day, so I'd love to come home and have something ready and waiting for me!
The missing half a point for full marks was obviously a sprig of mint
Dämn that music, anyone know what the tracks are on this one? <3
Watching these kind of videos remind me what a good teacher Ben is. If I was in his place I'd get frustrated and do everything myself haha
Jamie - did you find out why you lost 0.5 marks?
Made this tonight with some alterations and it was a huge hit with the boyfriend. Subbed green beans for the spinach (not a fan) and normal white beans for the butterbeans. Took the 'pear' suggestion from Ben to sub the apricots as well, that was great :)
Dear sorted food gents, what is the best recipes for a person who is sick?
HAHAHAHA Did anyone else rewind the beginning with Ben waving behind Jamie because I did a lot.. totally worth it!
I wish Ben wouldn't appear in every video. He's getting annoying.
Please do more like this and do slow cooker stuff too!
You're cheffin' all over the place! *literary 15 seconds later*  you can see how it all just 'mleau' (pronunciation?? XD) back, technical word for wilted xD yeah Ben, you do you xD
Hey guys x love the recipe but do pork medallions cost a lot? I recently started university, could you do some cheap, quick and easy meals for students? One problem I find when cooking is the portion size x I always make too much for one meal! Could you guys help? Love the vids =) Thank you!
I think I'm likely not alone in this: but I love you guys. For real!! Glad to be part of the Kickstarter campaign xo
You don’t need to eat meat it’s ruining the environment and our bodies
Always looking for midweek meals. Midweek is when I work late so these are always appreciated
More of this! Loving it :)
Leviticus 11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.\n\n8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.\n\n9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.\n\n10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:\n\n11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.\n\n12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.
I just got an idea. What if you make a battle in which James and Ben ‘supervise’ the boys where they cook a somewhat complicated meal? You can make pairings like James & Barry and Ben & Jamie or whatever. That’ll be fun to watch!
Lol I've been vegetarian my whole life but surely pig and fruit don't go well together? 😂😂😂
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
look like to much work. Delivery much easier 😃
Hahhaha is the last line + Sorted the chef's right? :P good work boys
Jamie is cute. 😀 he's my fave
4:36 Thank you, Ben. I now know the easiest way to get stoned.
Do more of these!
still can't get behind the whole 'meat+fruit' thing.
I'm allergic to a lot of fruits, many which are stone fruits. What other alternatives could I use? (Apples and pears are not an options either!)
Haha The zooming in on the food reminds me of Gordon Ramsey!!\n\n\n\n\nWHERE'S THE LAMB SAAAAAAUAUUAUUAUACE
So easy thumb in the middle Stoned.. Yeahhhhhhhhhhh
This reminded me I've got lamb cutlets in the freezer, excellent.\nWell done Jamie.
3:55 Jamie had the tongs in his left hand but he still used his other hand to put the pork into the pan...\n\n\nI love it XD!
Is anyone going to tell Ben that apples don’t have stones?
You guys should do more mid week meals, love this!
Love the one pan recipes! I'm gonna try this one next week
He looked so happy to be able to say the 'sorted' line, awww! <3 lmao
dried apricots have a different flavor to fresh ones though . . .
Jamie lost some weight, looking good bro 😎👌
More of these, please!! 😘
This is so encouraging to see and holy heck it looks delicious!
James looks so proud at the end 😂😂
More videos like this!! Please:D This looks sooooo good and easy <3
Thanks for the recipe, very interesting you guys!
I'm a vegetarian why am I watching this?
Jamie should have put a sprig of mint on it to get a 10/10
TREAT YO SELF!
That's pork loin not fillet!
That looks AMAZING!
wher frome you hawe guys that big pork filet or that was pork loin
Porking? Was that a Freudian slip, Ben? Lol!
Stoned! 😍
Reminds me of medieval cuisine!
Whoa, that looks and sounds amazing!
Amazing!!!
he said simplicity...
Bens vocabulary: Amazing, hot, gentle, succulent, British
More one pot recipes
Do you guys do any vegetarian meals?
I just bought a slow cooker - can you do a week of slow cooker meals please guys? Thanks so much!! :D
Could I substitute the pork with those big mushrooms and chicken stock with veggie stock to make it vegan?
Why is it chicken stock is always paired with pork when we normally use matching meat/stocks (ie chicken with chicken stock, beef with beef stock). Is pork stock just not a thing?
Running out of inspiration ...??? I don't understand what you're saying. You make thousands of meals in your lifetime. Why would it being the middle of the week make any kind of difference to anything??? I don't understand. ???
Unfortunately I can't eat pork (religious reasons). Is there a protein I can substitute in for this meal? I really like the flavors used in here. Beans and fruits etc.
How do you get the smell of garlic out of ur hands
I was having a mild panic attack when I thought they were not going to add back the accumulated juices form them resting pork.
Hey sorted food names Noah and I am a second year uni student at UWE and my cooking skills are pretty bad.Do you have any student recipies they are easy enough but time effective that anyone could cook them as a tea.Great video wish I could cook this
Why are there bits of dead animal in your dish 😕?
This was so autumnal I love it😍😍
Nothing better than a cosy bubble bath, a hot chocolate and a 40 minute Autumnal Zoe vlog!
can I just say, your hair and makeup are ON POINT girl! flawless!
When they were both in the ball together lmao!
I’m so proud of zoe for trying to zorb ball a few years ago she wouldn’t have even tried ❤️
I love Jim and Zoe's friendship it's like a really caring casual friendship and I'm in love x
I love these long vlogs, nice to see jim and tanya, there so nice,and joe of course x i think you,d suit an arran cardigan zoe x

Zoe could you please do a wardrobe tour 😩😩
Terry's orange chocolate is my absolute fave 😍
Imagine going to a party with all your colleges and do a quiz about the private life of your boss. That would be crazy!!!
Time spent with good friends is the best! Zoe, you were so brave going in the Zorb? ball
I've been using Clue for about a year now and it is honestly so useful!

I love a good 40 minute vlog!!!!!!!!
Just in case you read this, I know a trick that can help you stop having headaches. It's a piercing you out or your ears called Deith. It reaaaally works. Maybe you could try?

your eyerbrows are really nice recentley
Who else knew she was going to say the clue app before she said it ! X

In Alfie’s vlog the other day I actually thought the outfit that Tanya picked was soooo nice!! Xx

Does the app have the birth control reminder?
Clue is so good. highly recommend.
Love me a good title alliteration :) ;)
That Liverpool badge looks strange
When he said: Sturridge, when he's fit 😂
His English is great 👍
Van Dijk may be the only player that gets fifa ratings
He should have a better rating
Sturridge wen his fit JUST COME TO LIVERPOOL VIRGIL VAN DIJK
Seems like a nice guy
much better than alli and so much humble
wonder why he said Sturridge
Im surprised how good his english is
I would personally like to see you allow the player to write his own stats before he sees what EA gave him. Spice things up a bit.
Haha he had to say Sturridge
VVD knows. Fit Studge 🔥🔥
If he went liverpool he would have been a 85 for sure
His rating next year will skyrocket once he joins LFC
Keep the footballers reacting to stats videos coming
he looks like offset from migos LOL
You should give ask them for their predictions first ffs
What a legend Rio Ferdinand is, top man
I think Virgil's rating for himself is more deserving than his current rating. Don you think?
Van Dijk come to Liverpool in January pleaseee 😭😭😭
He wants to go to either Liverpool or city
Lol why does it look like Van Dijk is wearing a Van Dijk mask in the thumbnail 😂
The thing is they need it to be a little balanced like 68 shooting wtf
He said sturigge and Aguero because he wants to move to LFC and MC
He’s smoking, I’ll burn him
Sturridge when he's fit... He wants Liverpool so bad... And we want him likewise
welcome to LFC in January.
He's got to come to Liverpool and save our defense
Just get to Liverpool
83 is a joke hes at least 87
His card he wrote in would be worth 500k plus
What a tank in video game and real life
I think there's a mistake on the title he plays for Liverpool not Southampton c'mon get your act together
Big up the fs&hg tune
They don't give high pace to CB's to avoid them from being overpowered, annoying but whatever. Also, Dutch people have excellent English.
He's happy except from the badge on the card
They got the wrong team
Would be the most used defender in the game
Should they put they're ratings in before you show them?
The stats are perfect but the passing is meant to be 72 or73
Lower the passing by 10 and pace by 5 he deserves an 84. Quality CB
Very good defender. Sturridge and Aguero do pull defenders away because they're always running at a different velocity. And of course VVD wants a move to either club so can't knock the brotha for saying that.
I'd love to play a game against rio he seems like a sound guy and easy to get past
Rio tell him he will nothing if he moves to liverpook
Looks a little bit like Alli when he's laughing…
Wait those stats are wrong... it says 69 dribbling but he actually has 70 on Fifa 18
What are those cards made of always wondered
He wouldn't have those stats at Liverpool after conceding 50+ goals a year
Van dijk and Keita for us next TW I hope.. Although Keita already signed for 2018 season
His english is better than rooney\n\n\n\n\nClassic😂
Actually seems like a sound guy tbf
2 big beasts
With lukaku
85 passing hahaha his funny
Did he say sturridge
Everybody thinks they're better.
Free van dijk
85 passing cmon mate
❤❤❤
Please join liverpool
Do one with Benjamin mendy
Sube el camino hijueputa
Plz upload these daily
Do one with kolasinic
Greatest athlete YouTuber
Este canal ya chafeo, solamente hablan del FIFA... ¿cuanto te pagaron los de EA, Rio?
Van dijk is the only CB that can save Liverpool tbh \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen again I love to see Liverpool suffer 😂
He be a Liverpool player in January
Ferdinand son van dijk is gonna be great
Van Dijk Come to Liverpool
Van dijk should be higher in everything 😂
first
How the hell does he have the same physique as Akinfenwa?...dont get me wrong, he is very strong but compared to Akinfenwa? No way..
I think Sturridge is better than Firmino when he isnt injured. Sturridge is actually great at football. But he really never gets play time either. Firmino was good like 1-2 seasons ago. But he havent rly done anything yet.
U didn't show him his bloody FIFA 18 card rio
Wow Rio interviewing a Liverpool player now..oh wait..
Do it with man utd players
What the... when did he ever face off against Studge?
The man, still miss him up in Glasgow one of the best players I've ever seen wear the hoops 🍀
Would be a good fit at United but put off with this whole liverpool link. Hope he shows a desire for united n something can happen. Always saw him as a perfect rio replacememt and an upgrade on smalling.
Guys I am from Holland van dijk Will never go to Liverpool he wants to go to Arsenal because of dutch players they had denis bergkamp,Marc overmars,Glenn helder
When is fifa 18 coming out
How can this man say sturridge is one of the hardest he has played against he literally had him in his pocket the hole match in the league cup
Rio wants to be having a little chat with VVD about a cheeky switch to Old Trafford.
why ebro trynna make 50 doing well into some bullshit about race. ffs man, you can tell 50 knows being a black dude doesn't make shit cos he's balling.
Jay-Z ruined NY hiphop when he was president of DefJam...He promoted Rick Ross and Jeezy but shelfed all the NY artists.
50 only dude who can go from nicest guy in hip hop to ready to fuck a guy up in the same interview and I believe he would do it.
I take it that 50 doesn't care for Puffy.
Rules for the NFL     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXK6MVbC-SE&feature=youtu.be
Ebro knows exactly what 50 was implying. It doesn’t matter how you personally gauge a hit a record. The question was simple “Who’s playing it now?” I liked the project but 50 is right this is a youth driven culture and the youth who is the main consumer is not consuming that project.
Like a flashback to 03/04 😂
So many underestimate 50s intelligence, he's so aware of everything around him. Just listen to the way he break everything down. Respect bruh
New York as a whole fucking let everybody takeover not fifty
50 is the REALIST nigga in the industry
50 is one of the smartest dude I'm still surprised he isn't head of a label or some kind of boss.   But he do whatever he want
He had to get them then he gave us a classic on The Massacre: PIGGY BANK
When is someone gonna slap this shit out of ebro!
50 one of the GOATs
Prodigy and Tupac were very similar. They really art students that took on the theme thugging
50 I'm next good one
thanks 50 for REALLY PULLING Ebro coat! YOU ARE THE BEST!
If you disliked this you a cunt!
I'm fuck them up hhahahahhaha
Ole ebro keep 50 ass on course let's  say that
50 Cent is the man. He gives the best interviews no matter what.
50 Cent always been hating on Jay Z and Diddy and always sounding like a Fox News reporter trying to explain himself.
Fiddy is the definition of cool
first time listening to this radio show damn its entertaining , gracias.
Ebro just shut the fuck up ..keep blaiming 50 for shit he never did.. It was you Radio DJ,s who stop playing real HIPHop and NY artist music.  50 Just a real Soldier and if its wartime  then ist wartime..but stop blaiming others u Prick.. I see now why Breackfastclub is wining over u suckerz.
Hot 97 is garbage and I'm only here for 50.
Don't really care to watch this whole thing, but I will gleam the comments to get a summary ;)
So because the business people felt it was messy in NY yall refuse to play the other artist music in NY who had hot songs & was not involving in the 50/ja rule mess. So u went to so call break outter state records that was already hot 🔥 in 47 to 30 states. AND blame 50cent. Your the program director you know who's hot in the streets of new york. You could have push state property bleek fab etc... Insteed of fat joe lox & ja rule.
“ There really art students that took on the theme thuggin “. Love watching interviews of 50.
See what he had to say about 50 and if Hip Hop is done with him? Listen to An Honest Conversation About Hip Hop Episode 10 by An Honest Conversation About Hip Hop Podcast #np on #SoundCloud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ahcahhpodcast/an-honest-conversation-about-hip-hop-episode-10
Trump switched it up on people, people never knew he was That guy until he got in office. I on the other hand always suspected it.
I'm tired of this osama bin laden looking motherfucker Ebro using the word nigga. \n\nNigga you ain't black, don't try fit in where you don't belong...... \n\nbitch ass nigga
50 is one of the smartest niggas out in the industry .. Don't judge a book by its cover. No one can touch this man
Rosenberg is such a dick rider....... tell him how you really feel about 50 central and how you said he has no talent
i think Fif likes Ebro coz hes the only one of these radio guys that aint afraid of him
I bumped the massacre so many winters... its very under rated
50 wearin the same shit he just bunched two interviews back to back what a boss
50 do big business gotta luv the strategy!!!! He said he wanted to do film now top show in the land!!! Melaninated  business moves!!
This is the first time i see 50 cent crying. RIP Prodigy
50 cent the drug dealer from queens turn down 500,000$ for a walk through from trump..... That's Morals
fuck 50 for this interview
50 cent starts a sentence and stops to in the middle and changes route just to fuck with your head. He never says things direct, has to make one simple line complicated as fuck. Funny dude.
THIS is why 50 doesn't DO or should not RELEASE new music. He's out of touch on making music today, shit even then. Music was always a HUSTLE to him. Never appreciated music as a ART.
50 said truth Ebro  had a major play at the time in destroying NY hip hop . . Big time he turned to playing  pop artist instead  of NY  hip hop  or quality  rap and hot 97 to this day , they rather play the  pop not the quality  emcees or singers and Ebro  did screw it up .. he deserves  that L

I only clicked this video because I thought 50 punks ebro
Fif Been Always a Real One.
lol it looks like ALL Hot 97 fans hate ebro
People only want 50 cent in there show to take shot at jay-z and puff because those 2 niggas is the only niggas on 50 mind
Eboro and Hot 97 ruined the New York sean
I been saying the same thing about trump. I really think he was trying to rebuild his brand and he ended up winning. Now he's trying anything to get impeached that wouldn't put him in prison.
There is something  always so inspiring about 50!
50 Cent and Master P interviews nothing but motivation
50 is the undisputed king of spin!
Ebro and 50 need a show together. They back and fourths be funny.
50 cent is a great interview....anybody that can have a decent conversation with Ebo won...and since when do the program director not control the play of music🤔 Ebro trash
STACK BUNDLES was on his WAY! R.I.P. Ray Ray, I love ya my nigga and CHINX Drugz. SQ,SQ,SQ,SQ  SQQUUUAAAADDDDD UP!
HANDS DOWN One of the best people in the world.. This negro I dont kno how to not respond to someone trying to hurt me ....So ima start hurting people. Lmao thinking like my uncle ass nigha
what does 50 mean when he says hiphop is a youth culture?
tom ford is my subscribtion
This nigga be saying a whole lot of nothing
Fifty I love you no homo but you always hating on Hov...
he drops gems. one of the best interviewees anyone can watch.
Fif wearing beats
Ebro is a fuckin bitch
GEMS.
50 dropped serious knowledge on the rap game entertainment business and Ebro/Rosenberg tried to shit on it
Fif is ALMOST as good a troll as Trump. Lol Fif definitely is a lot funnier.
Did Fif really end NY rap?
Rosenberg iced out now?
Legend
Nervous laughter all around lol
70 IQ people gathering...
26:00 fif gives the coldest looks ever
we need time stamps
It's 50!
Lmao he is dumb. How do you not get the future line. He's saying he could've  ended up like that very easily and glad it didn't. That Ciara shit is a trash situation for a dude.
fuck ebro
I love fif!!!!
Much respect 50
Ebro cracks me up hahaha
Only watchn the shit cuz of 50. Idc bout these niggas
50!
Fif 👏👏
50 is dope...
4:44 @ 22:44\nIlluminati Confirmed.
I think if Hov and Puff pulled their dicks out 50 would think about sucking it he loves them niggas
Ebro hella cool
https://soundcloud.com/shillasound/problems
@15:00 50 hits em..It hurt ya boy 15:10...HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!
Dude is smart.  Dropping jewels as always
@ 27:09 shit had me crying
Great interview. 👌
Ebro is so fucking annoying
‘Hoe Culture ‘ I luv it lol
Fuc Ebro bih azz
50 dont dislike trump.
Well howabout dat'...
50 loves Trump. The host of this is a jackass and probably thinks Trump is racist. Amazing how 40yrs in the face of the public and he wasn't a racist until he ran for President. LOL \n\nDont get your political leanings from these tools.
Salute 2 ebro for acknowledging stack bundles, squuuuuad up!
mmm I was drawn by the title. Thought it'd be a fashion video but it is more about makeup. Anyhow your outfit is cute!
What didn't you put an AD disclaimer in the title? You're required to do that.
If you were on a TV commercial literally doing the same video I doubt anyone would hate on it. Honestly what's the difference between that and this? Silly folks. Cool video, loved the outfits. Tried to recreate the grungy eye...total YouTube fail for me, (I'm a Pinterest fail professional) but I'll keep trying. :) Cheers from Detroit.
I love that mascara, it’s a tubing one, and is better than the blinc one.
Really nice outfit and you suit the skirt!
The eye makeup on you looks gorgeous!!!! I am so ready for fall as well!! My favorite season!!!
I loved your outfit! I absolutely love Weekday atm so many great bits plus it’s sold on ASOS 🙌🏻
Your legs look amazing in those boots!! Xx
Love the outfit!!
You look happier lily, hope you are well!
You forgot to use the green on your waterline while doing the second eye 🙈 loved the look anyway 😊
Outfit on point !
Loved the eye look 🌹 Your outfit was great too 👌
great video, Lily...love the fall styles! Can you start posting dupes to all of your purchases though? Not all of us can afford $400+ skirts and blouses.... :(
That skirt is gorgeous 😍
Love this look!
Thanks for a great beauty vlog Lily - so many bloggers have moved to fashion and forgotten the importance of beauty tutorials and reviews x
Your hair looks amazing at the moment, would love to know if you have changed your routine/products. 😍
Love everything about this look! And I also always forget how much I love wearing green eyeliner. Can't wait to pick one up again.
I really loved this video! It would be so interesting for curly and frizzy hair girls like me to see a hair routine of yours...what products you use, how you straighten your hair, how you manage it, etc. That would be just brilliant.
love this whole look!!! your hair always looks amaze & I want to try that mascara!!!
I love how we could tell you are actually excited about everything you showed in this video, you were smiling so much specially in the outfit part :) btw your nails are so cool!
Love the outfit! I've been looking to get a similar skirt!
Such a wonderful video!  Love the makeup, outfit and hair :):)
You look stunning 💕 love you with this hair length, perhaps even more so with it even longer! 💇🏻
Wish there was a far away view of the whole outfit!
Lily I just love your base, it's flawless....how did you do it? You've probably spoken about it a lot of times but I just watch all your vids and Except for the NY get ready with Anna I haven't seen a make up tutorial in a while! so I was wondering if you can tell us what you've used (foundation, concealer....) you looked gorgeous btw, I love the grungy look 😊
I love everything about this.  I totally forgot all about green eyeliner, it's the only eyeliner I actually feel good in as black can be a bit harsh on me.  Your hair is so lovely, I really wish I could pull off the middle parting as good as you do, and the outfit is very different for you.  I feel like we have a similiar sense of style so I am going to have to check out that mint jumper.  Really great video Lily,  really enjoyed watching. Hope you are keeping well :)
I really enjoyed this video!! The make up look was a bit different but without being too wacky and anyone could wear it x
Great video!
Wth! You look like Rebecca from Eastenders but with a different voice
I loved the outfit! the mascara looks great too. xx
You're twisting it towards your face 🙈😂
I loved your make up and the skirt! I'm not sure about the jumper though! I really liked its colour, but I think a more fitted jumper would look better!
I love the outfit Lily. Also, you've inspired me to try to do a version of this eye look. Thanks!
I loved the outfit! Definitely recreating 😍😍
Loved the eye look!
which color is your nailpolish???
I looooved the outfit! Especially the boots. So chic and a little sexy 👌🏼
I think You look Amazing in that look😍👌🏼💖💖💖👋🏼
Great video Lily! I loved the makeup+hair+outfit combo. Just missed an outdoors shot of you modeling the outfit, I think that would have tied up the video nicely.
loving the autumn look Lily x
That brown eyeshadow work perfectly with your roots! This is perfect!
You look amazing in the autumnal colours....and you have great legs. Loving the green eyeliner, too x
Amazing outfit and I really love your hair colour right now 🙌🏻💕
Love this look Lily ! It looks great on you
Wow, I love this look and the make up is 👌🏻 I read alotttt of YouTube comments and I swear people are TOUGH on you. I loved this video and whatever if it's an ad. It didn't feel like product placement...plus it's your job. Keep producing great, approachable looks. Your videos have been stellar lately 👍🏻
The smoked out green feline flick was such a nice idea 😍
Outfit is the bomb! A little  bit sexy at the same time.I love it.xxx
love the outfit very much!!! love from Belgium
Your hair is so beautiful 😍 love the outfit
Loved this video Lily! Definitely think I'll be trying green eyeliner now x
This outfit is amazing! I love how unique the colours and materials were and how it doesn't look like every other autumn outfit on social media. Can't wait to try that eye look too! Amazing video xx
Love the outfit, you look fab!
As you started to put on green eyeliner I was worried it won't look good, but girl, it looks amazing!
I love the outfit! You've really become one of the people I look to for style inspiration :)
Such a lovely video ❤ and Lily you ROCK this look👌
I Ike how you added the green! Such a nice touch and your autumn outfit look was so cute!:)
Love the green eyeliner, it really is so beautiful on brown eyes! Ah I almost forgot about the Matte Balms, I used to be so obsessed with them!
You are awesome 😍. Lots of love from Mexico 🇲🇽❤️
Really loving your hair Lily, it looks great. Also that skirt 😍
Love this outfit, you look really pretty on skirts and dresses. \n\nLove your videos! ❤
I loved this lily!! such a great video idea and love your style so much! :) also: I hope you are feeling a bit better! <3
I actually loved the makeup look, it suited you so well! Will definitely try on myself even though where I live it's spring time now.
I looove this makeup look on you. The green liner looks amazing.
Love love love this on you❤️
I loved this video! :) the outfit looks so nice on you..very flattering :) Can't wait for the autumn weather to get here ...\nI really enjoy your videos more and more lately ... especially your vlogs 😊💕
from watching this i've decided that I need that eye look in my life, also your hair looks SOOO nice!! just loved this video!!
You look beautiful! Wear more skirts and boots! Very nice Lily!!
The outfit is aces!! I’m inspired by it x
Omg this outfit is amazing!!! Definitely feel inspired!!!! 😍😍 the eye look is gorgeous as well - nice to see an autumnal look that isn't red and orange 💕
Great video Lily, love the way you did your makeup, hair and styling. The whole video was put together amazing 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😀
Really need to get my hands on a green liner, there’s a sentence I never thought I’d say. Well write anyway lol. Loving your whole outfit Lily x
i really like the green eyeliner, you look very sexy!
Really liked the outfit on you!!
Love all of this! I'm going to try that mascara, I love a tubing mascara.
I LOVE this outfit! That skirt is so cute, my friend was wearing a very similar one today and she looked stunning
love the boots and your make up is perfect Lily!
ooooh I LOOOVE the outfit it's different for you but so nice! Love it love it love it
Hi Lily, loved the format of this video and your outfit though different for you still reflected your own personal style. I remember watching the vlog when you were on your boot hunt last year and they look lovely on you! ❤️
You're making me want over the knee boots! I keep trying to convince myself I don't need any.
Your look is so simple but also very sophisticated. Big like for this new autumn combination in your wardrobe and in your makeup👌💗💗💗
The outfit looks bomb! Those colours are so flattering on you, love the mint/light brown combo
You look so good Lily! I love the eye look
I've been loving your videos lately, Lily. Your YouTube style is really evolving. X
LOVE that jumper!!!
i loooved the outfit!
Love this look!!!
You look beautiful!!!!
Those boots!!!!  Love them!
Love this look xx
Another inspiring video! TFS!
Wow! You look fabulous!
That green liner!! love love love
Your make-up looks lovely! Xxxx
I saw Lily Pebbles wearing green liner and gold shadow, so I bought green liner and gold shadow (and army pants and flip flops).
The green eyeliner looks so good on you! Love your autumn style ❤️🍂
Just wanna see you do a contoured highlight full American insta girl glam makeover video would be fun x
Youtube has become very unoriginal these days. Everyone looks the same and wears the same trend- or statement pieces. The Gucci belt, the Gucci Bag, the same cashmere knits...I mean, I like your video, but it won't inspire me. Sorry, I am not trying to be mean, I love youtube and watching you and others doing what you do. But its become so predictable. Autumn Makeup, GRWM, Ads, Fall Faves, WIMB ...
Liked the makeup but only three mins of the video is about style? Maybe change the title x

*I love this song, the lyrics are relatable and FLETCHER sounds really good, honestly this song is better than most of the songs on billboard hot 100. THIS IS A BOP AND I WANT TO SEE IT ON THE BILLBOARD HOT 100!*
What one person disliked this??!? Reveal yourself!
Fletcher is amazing and leaves me SHOOK ONCE AGAIN! What makes me happy is that there aren't any dislikes and that's what she deserves. Likes to express our love to Fletcher and to this amazing song. I love it :D
Am I the only one that gets a HUGE Shannon/Cammie breakup vibe from this song?
HONESTLY CARI.. I just  wanna thank you for writing such a beautiful, honest and open song! 💕🌈 Much love from the Netherlands 🇳🇱😘
WOHOO!I'M SHOOK\nTHIS IS SOOO GOOD!🤘👌👏
I really love all of ur songs,swear dwnloadd those tracks

THIS IS SO GOODDD !! I CAN’T EVEN 😩😩👌🏽👌🏽
Someone should hook me up with some guitar tabs to match the vocal track. (Hope that makes sense)  I'm new at playing and can't play by ear yet so making my own tabs is a little difficult. Especially for something without traditional guitar.
I'm in love🙌🏼❤️💯

If that Annie doesn't date Hayden, this Annie will (Annie is my nickname) I mean I'm almost 15 but still I'd date him anytime
This show is too cheesy but i don't know why i keep watching it 😂😂
I thought they would actually kiss

Hayden just wanna kiss\nAnnie at the end
THEY DIDNT KISSSSSS, oh my lord😤 please kiss next episode

This show is soo amazing! I think that i might be enjoying this a bit too much... I know you guys are busy but could try posting twice a week? You guys are amazing
Hope they kiss int he next one
At 3:34 was she doing that for Henry? Or does she just love those chips/popcorn. It says smart food and it is in a white bag which I know is kettle corn.

I want the episodes to be longer longer
Women now have bigger balls than men. lol what a time to be alive!
Oklahoma needs a team !!! We’ll take 2 !!!!  Best hits this century!!
The NFL can go rot. I won't watch it again until I see official apologies from every player, coach and owner....and Goodell had to apologize in a press conference and then resign
LFL about to get popular, fuck the NFL
Finally, some football players with balls!
I guess I WILL be watching football...  Just not thr NFL.
They act more like men than the pussy NFL players with their fe fees.  Thx LFL.  Subscribed.
Thank you ladies. I left the nfl, coming to you. The Flag and National Anthem should never be disrespected. Thank you!!!!
Looks like I just became a fan!! Great job lady's. Support you all the way!
As of this posting 228 communist pigs have watched this video.\nPatriots, give this video a thumbs-up!!!
How come this is the first I've heard of this League?????   When do they play !  Now this is football !  Patriots, each an everyone !
I think it would be nice to see the LFL go more mainstream in place of the NFL. They deserve it!
RIP NFL
You summed it up perfectly. Honestly, I never heard of LFL before seeing this video.\nYou ladies just gained a new fan.
America !  haters gona hate...
Well I'm switching to the LFL...and good for them. The women play a better, harder hitting game too !
It's unnessary to undermine the real fight against police brutality.
hey NFL take a look at your replacements! Ironic that these ladies have more cojones than the so called men of the NFL (No Fans Left)
PEAK IDEOLOGY
😮, 🙄, 😁😃😄😍🇺🇸🇺🇸🎆🗽
Man, sometimes it sucks to be gay.
To be honest I must be living in a bubble because I have never watched this football league here but I respect them so much more then I do the NFL players now. Thank you ladies for being tougher and more patriotic then these coward NFL players and owners.
You guys are great! If you ever have a game in Tennessee I'll be there or better yet maybe start a team in Tennessee!
Thank you LFL! Sure wish the National Felons League had your guts.
You know what's more disrespectful to or American flag? The confederate flag.
Can I identify as a woman and play in this league?
Hell yeah!
Ahh Football without the protests!!! I'm in!!
I guess the only league game I will watch from now on. Salute you all.
The greatest country, huh!? Without own history.
It's just comical that this was all started by a one season wonder qb who was raised by a white couple in Wisconsin.
They should replace the  NFL with the LFL, Why would you rather watch men tackling each other when you can watch women tackle each other in their underwear.
If we disrespect the flag and our institutions we open the door for Communism and loss of our freedoms, we must never let that happen. Cultural Marxists are working patiently and steadily at destroying our institutions, most are not as obvious or as well publicized as the kneeling issue but they are just as important. To understand what is happening here see YouTube videos on The Frankfurt School and Cultural Marxism this will let you see the grand plan to destroy our country and way of life.
Get a team in philly and I will get season tix! Good for you ladies, I stand with you
Why doesn't the LFL not have their own superbowl yet?
Women aren't equal either,  they should be protesting as well.
Subbed.
Thank you! I greatly appreciate the respect that you show for our flag, and those who have fought to defend it. You are now my football league of choice.
The people have the balls to stand for their own country, oh wait they don't have balls.
When the LFL is more legit then the NFL.
Thank You LFL.
Good job ladies!
ok! i'm in, what channel?
TRUE PAYTREEUTS
and yet somehow the dislikes are super high . I do not believe people actually dislike this stance the LFl is taking and trolls have infected the dislikes on this channel post .  People who support the flag of this country make sure to hit like to stop the losers who think it is cool to disrespect our nation and its symbols!  LFL football sounds like a gimmick but watch a game and you'll see more than just sexy women in pads ! This is really football and it's a pretty good football game  to watch and the women are beautiful on top of that .  They hope to reorganize my Green Bay Chill and I hope we get that team back on the field soon because with the NFL screwing us over Wisconsin is looking for another football team to back !
MLAR
I'd watch it!
This is the best timeline
You just improved your stock market value by double digits!  A CLASS ACT, for sure!
lfl should be come America sport
Please!!! Have games at the same times as the NFL!!
I'm more of a rugby guy, but I wouldn't mind watching this. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Any LFL player, no matter how good or sexy, who refuses to salute the flag or national anthem should be banned.
LFL Rocks - The men from the NFL should be humbled by your patriotism and honor you give your nation.  Thank you!
I live in Scottsdale Arizona and would definitely support an AZ team if they eventually have one.
Now this is a league I could support & games I could watch.
They got bigger balls than the NFL pussies
I Stand with the Lovely/Athletic Ladies of the LFL....Yeah Buddy!!!
I support you even more for this, but unfortunately their are a lot of Anti-American people, who think protesting the Flag that give's them the right to protest, will do something good, it won't, it will just destroy the county that gave them that right in the first place, and then they'll have nothing.
So these ladies have bigger balls than all those kneeling NFL boys.
🚀
FOR AMERICA
yeah fuck the nfl this is the brilliant
Are the 220 thumbs down by the NFL Snowflakes who kneeled? #BoycottNFL #BoycottNFLSponsors
This is great news least these woman show love for this country unlike those fuckers in the NFL. Much love to you lady's and thank you.
I'd rather watch these girls play anyway.
LOVE this! Very well done LFL.
God Bless you all!!!!!
LFL is better than the panzies of the kneelFL
It's amazing how everyone is an American until they bare their right to freedom of speech then all of a sudden they are not Americans anymore. Nice.
Thank you, ladies!
much love you ladies from a man who was never interested in sports to begin with. i hope you become bigger than the NFL. us patriots are behind you
So we've finally gotten to the point where the women of this country are more of a man then the men are. Congratulations you bunch of fucking cry baby snowflakes
Yup fight for your rights when the only way females get noticed playing football is when you're half naked and looked at as sex symbols.
Awesome thank you!
 >when women have bigger balls then men\nwhat a world we live in right now. 
THIS IS FUCKIN AWESOME.\nFuck the NFL, bunch of cry babies who made millions, some of them get 1 mill per game - , mostly blacks who can't stand the fact that Donald Trump is white and he's a Patriotic President. They  are used by Zionists, Liberals and all this is Pushed by mass media owned by Zionist Jews - CNN, ABC, NBC or ESPN.
LFL rocks!!! I'm buying tickets to watch the LFL!
We are not protesting the flag you morons. just tell the cops to stop killing inocent black dudes and we'll stop kneeling.
But yet people didnt have a problem with Kid Rock cutting a hole in the american flag and wearing it as a poncho.....even though that is against the Code of the flag.....This is a free country. They have the right to kneel and you have the right to be mad and not watch.  All you people are so against dictators but yet you want to force your ideals on to other people.
The anthem says One nation under God with liberty and justice for all. Its a good idea that America never applied into unbias action. You stand and place your right hand over your heart quickly for a peice of cloth, on a song about war. When was the last time you stood up and placed your hand there for God? THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THAT ALL DO NOT GET LIBERTY AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT JUSTICE!!!\nIf you love your country, drop to one knee. Tell her I love you baby, but your wrong and work on getting her right. If you love America stop feeling love for a damn peice of cloth and feel the pain of AMERICANS around you!!!! The athletes are doing it for AMERICANS, and GOD! Would you place your hand over your heart for a LIE?
Screw the N F Hell, I respect those who show respect. LFL > NFL
These ladies are true patriots.
Bless you LFL!
What kind of butthurt liberal snowflakes downvote this vidya?
Only asshole democrats think the American flag only represents only white Americans. America is a country where any race can be successful because every race is a American. So many rich black men yet they think they are oppressed. Screw you anti American pro criminals democrats....
Well looks like I found my NFL replacement
Bravo!!!
I cant begin to describe how proud of the LFL for standing up FOR the Flag of this great Nation. Thank you so much!
Good 4 the women's league..a new fan !
I am NOW officially a fan of the LFL!!
Subbed. NO MORE NFL.
Statement of LFL supporting the protesting of the National anthem\nhttps://youtu.be/7AhJsVTgnq0
There's a time and place for protest, your workplace is not a great choice!
Why was i not told this exists !
The only ones that agree with this obvious racist I Stand bullshit are the ones proud of the murdeous heritage. If you took a second to read about the history of how America came to me, you’d understand how the flag doesnt mean the same for everyone. \nI find the flag completely offensive because I had to learn the history that was denied to me. So fuck you Trump, LFL, and any other stupid incompetent dumb piece of shit who refuses to acknowledge that white supremacy is the root of all things evil and why this country has flourished. WE built this country so YOU get the fuck out.
this divide is getting out of hand.once again,people are kneeling not to protest against our troops but protesting b/c we are not upholding WHAT THEY FOUGHT AND DIED FOR!!!!!😧 How can we fight for nations to have democracy when EQUALITY and JUSTICE for all is clearly still a problem in our OWN nation.i will kneel because this is not what they died for when a cop can stop a 10 year old boy and shoot him in cold blood and get away with it.THINK. AMERICA.THINK.
DOD has paid all professional sports teams to have players stand for national anthem to get recurits and manipulate the people into supporting it's jesuit Zionist Global war on Terror .  Supposedly Senate did not agree with this spending but happened anyway
Lol... what a joke.\n\nOf course they're standing... they're 97% White.\n\nDuh.
WOW!!! A league of hot ass bitches more American, more Patriotic, and more Respectful than the pathetic, over-paid, premadona,  useless asshole NFL'rs. AWESOME.
Well, I'd start interviewing hair salon owners first...
take a knee NFL
BLM. Then act like it. Pathetic
These cunts should've crashed and died, honestly the world's better off without vermin like this adding to the gene pool.
man one of the most ignorant retarted videos i have ever seen..hopefully these two assholes go to prison
If cops shot  them, a big BLM protest will be done for this idiots
What a bunch of dumb asses. Wait till cops find this video and identify you fucktards!
straight up,ebk alllday psycho perfeckt killasssssssssssss drrrrrrrrrrrr
People.. yeah sure.  And lets ignore their race. From what I've seen, theirs a consistent trend amongst their race for violence and crime. But im the racist for saying that. Fuck this world.
she shot upwards, he shot straight into the houses. come to mexico and sicarios will deal with your ass in less than 24Hrs. Police cant beat that shit.
They are not wearing seatbelts!!
NIGGERS.  It's ALWAYS the NIGGERS isn't it?
Hey guys, I tried uploading this a few days ago, but had a technical fault - so had to remove it! If you're wondering why you've seen it before - you were in the lucky 1000 views previously! X
The fact that she drops everything just freaks me out 😂 no offense, love you em 💓
I thought this would be a fail for sure. Pretty cool. Definitely would be hard to get even I think
Cara delevingne brows right there
Love your vids. This one is super quiet though :/ no hate! Just didn't know if you were aware. :)
Keep this background pls
I just love how clumsy you are and so jumpy. So cute! Love your chanell btw!
I love the fact that now she smiles alot in the videos 😍😍\n. Yes.. that brow stamp .. nailed it 😍
These brows look SO good on you!! No one has perfectly matching brows so no one would give yours a second look. We are our own worst critics - but this looks really, really good. Like, I want to try it now!!!
could u do a full face of elf i know that you done a full face of drugstore with some elf products in but could you do a full face if that possible? btw i luv ur channel :)
Wow I think you actually look good with the thicker brow! AND I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT TO WORK THAT WELL. Thanks for another awesome video, Em! 💖
looking forward for u to review some stuff from makeup revolution....
```    ```
you are the cutest person I have _ever_ seen, watching your videos makes me gay - never thought this would happen to me.
This actually looks surprisingly good! I mean, if you stamp them on in 3 seconds, you can touch them up quite a bit and still save time. Cool! 💕
wanna reach 500 subs can u help a sis out ^_^ have a good day:-)
your videos make me so happy ♡♡♡
That eyebrow is going to be walking 2 paces ahead of the rest of my body! HAHAHA! You are amazing and hilarious! <3
U need to spend 3 weeks on them  brows lol
Hi have you tried the foundation from dermacol ?
Plzzz change ur name from my pale skin to beautiful me coz u look so beautiful
Try the EgoEra facial mask maker. It looks interesting.
Actually this is intriguing! I'm missing half an eyebrow from a dog attack if this would work then it would save me so much time everyday having to completely draw on my brow from scratch and having to match it to the other. Does anybody know how pigmented the powder is on just plain skin???
Your reactions was so funny! I tried it on my mother but oh no, it wasn't so pretty lol
You're always dropping things 😂 \nLove your videos ♥️
your mazing and make my day your so funny! ENERGY. BUT can we get fall makeup LOOK?! OR NO..AND look idk stamp hmm how make eyebrows perf lmaooo did , OTHER HACKS instgram hype lol no missed video so new! TROOPER MOTIVATION GREAT . what foundation using?!
I love this!  I'm going to have to try it.  I would love to see a tutorial on your makeup look in this video!
You're the only person I've seen who didn't completely miss their brow when using this product!!
Yes I‘ve seen this video a few days ago😂
Brow stamp pretty cool....what eye shadow are you wearing it's lovely!!!
Love the video! So happy you finally uploaded this video!
I feel like you already did this before! Dejavue. Just like the video where you tested the Derma-high-coverage foundation! :D
I thought that only i have got one easy-brow and one hard-brow x)
I really like the thicker brow on the left.
Hey !! Just one suggestion- start giving marks out of 10 to the products u review. That would be good. Love your videos. :*
I CANT BELIEVE YOUR GOING TO HELLOWORLD ARGH I AM SO EXCITED
I think this could actually work for me!? Still better than doing it all with my clumsy hand! LOL :D
The product is pretty good may try it myself 😊
What foundation are you wearing here. Your skin looks great
Not lucky one... Wish I could 😨😞
I literally just watched reaction time react to your pale skin video about how you are ugly your such an inspiration and continue to do what you are doing 🙂
I Need that! 😳

It looked great on you!! Wow! 👌🏼
First comment!!!!! Love your videos they are so inspiring!
Try rolling the stamp so it get the whole brow
I am pleasantly surprised at the results. Good job!
I am genuinly so surprised at how they came out! Brow game on point!
I'm such a fannnn 💕
why don't you just fill in your brows like a normal person... this would probably make my brows really uneven! lol (if i do it)
#WilDasovich I just want to tell you that I haven't been really active in youtube other than watching videos of cooking and camera reviews, yet after I heard about the news with your medical condition, I got so inspired by you that I immediately subbed and made sure that I get notified each time you upload a video. \n\nI wanna know how you are doing and how you are staying strong fighting against cancer. You have such a great family and you have such a great heart. You're happiness and positive energy is contagious, it manifests a lot in you.\n\nBy the way, when I heard about the RAWR Awards? I made sure to look for you and told my friends about it. You deserve so much more than just an award. \n\nKeep fighting Wil! We love you. 😘
Together we fight. We have our respective battles in life. I really hope you'll have victory over your cancer and I recently took my licensure examination for Mechanical Engineering awhile ago. And I really hope I'll pass too. Thank you for inspiring me to be positive. I also started vlogging because of you. Thank you for being one of my inspiration in life. Get well soon!
These videos you upload is like an eye opener to people. Thanks to you Wil! I think people's opinion of having cancer is now changing because of you.
I think a lot of people need to watch more of your vlogs because if they don't watch or even know about it, they're missing something out. They won't be able to see how great this channel is; That there is a simple guy who give smiles and laughter in any way he can, spreading positivity especially to those (sick people) who are experiencing the same thing, sharing the love he's getting from people who loves him and letting us audience feel it (in some way), a good brother and son, has a cool & loving family and most of all an amazing person who has been an inspiration to a lot of people. \n\nWil: Why Filipino?\nPudra: Because they are good in everything.\nWil: Hehe! True, true.\n\nJust like Pudra said, Filipinos are good in everything.\n\nFor example:\nYou Wil. You have been very good in fighting this cancer, seeing a cancer patient so active and so full of life is just amusing. Keep up the good work sir and that 1M subscribers will soon appear on the home page plus that—\nCONGRATULATIONS for Surpassing ONE MILLION SUBSCRIBERS Wil Dasovich, I mean The Golden Play Button will be yours, I'm looking forward to that.\n\nP.S \nYou're mom is soooo lovely, the same as my mom. 😁😁😁
Effects of dexamethasone running in ur body its a steroid;thats why you feel hyperactive and restless,though u need to sleep well,keep proper precautions cause ur still immunocompromised
GET WELL SOON KUYA WIL!!!
That Landslide song 💗
WILL BE D
Use cannabis man
Sub to my channel plss
glhf dude
i wish you all the luck in the world wil, you and your family is really a role model to everyone. keep it up and keep safe. be healthy!
Love all vlogs kuya will.. i can watch it over and over again 😂
I was reading some comments and read that mudraks has Ychannel? I just subbed to mudra and haley too. Love this family
Wil found your channel by accident.  Sending you prayers, light and strength. God bless you and your family. Keep up your incredible energy and positivity!!!!!
The extra boost of energy might be from the dexamethasone which is a steroid. \n\nLove your videos!
I'm so impressed that you'll keep your hands off the bike! Bike skills on fleek.
I love those words of wisdom about making the most of your energy when you still have it. Such source of positivity.
fight will, fight!  love your attitude. it's hard to be as peppy as you have been when you have cancer, but that's why i really love the way you've been dealing with this. attitude definitely helps. rest when you have to, but keep going at it will. fight!
They add steroids that wear off after a day.  I am in round 6.  Bit of drama.  The steroids are there to help you get through the first few days.   Not sure of all the exercise. You may want to check with the docs on alot of exercise.  The chemo eats protein.  Guess you will find that out.  I have managed to maintain my weight for 12 weeks.  Your immune system is dropping so watch any injury or infections.
im gonna use the thumbnail as a meme for future purposes sjsksjsj
You are so inspiring and so positive! My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer (gleoblastoma) He had surgery in February, but sadly his tumor came back in the same spot a few months later (another surgery is not possible) Radiation, Chemo, and immunotherapy and his tumor has been shrinking! :) We have all been staying positive for my dad and getting him out of the house, and I think that has been helping so much. Praying for you and a fast recovery.
Energetic, happiness can kill your cancer Wil ;D
Fight!
Praying for you
U know what i create 3 google acc to subscribe to ur channel

maybe it's because of your healthy habits, kaya active mo pa rin after chemo, i know you can get through this easily 💕
Hey Wil, \nDavid here from The World n Us.  I'm a long time viewer, first time commenter.  We've just got back from camping for a few weeks to see what you've been going through.  Just wanted to send you some love from me and the whole family.  You are one person who has inspired me to start a channel and vlogging our family's travel experiences.  We just can't believe this is happening to you and want nothing more than for you to get through this.  Stay strong.  Take care of your body.  Get plenty of sleep.  We're here with you all the way!

Here is a viral video I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRdSWtUdawU Marianne
Make sure you're not gonna sweat a lot. Make your dressing dry and intact all the time to prevent infection. God bless you and you family!
Been following your battle.\nWas diagnosed last night with kidney cancer.\nHad no symptoms. Caught because I had a growth in my nostril which was thought to be inflamed scar tissue from a previous septi plast.\nSince the granulima was negative before surgery to remove it.They dbl checked ,Thank God.\nCat scan revealed whole body clear except a baseball sized tumor in my left kidney.\nRadical nephrectomy and chemo to follow.\nKeep posting your journey.\nGlad your Dad is a survivor.\nI pray you will be as well.\nGoid luck.\nPeace and health to you.
You mean chemo ADVERSE effects not working!! That title scared the shit out of me
hey! you're almost at 1M! Congrats! #oakland
For Wil the most Anti Cancer foods in the world are Garlic, Broccoli sprouts and Black beans

Will. why don't you try the Cryosurgery in Guangzhou, China. i have watched it at The Correspondents in ABS CBN few years ago. try to watch this https://youtu.be/A47uGZ15nC8
You are such a sweet son Wil. I love how you and your Dad are super close. And the way your Mom looked at you in the end, that was pure love. Stay strong Wil! A lot of people love you 🙂
Hi Wil,apparently you seem strong and composed on the outside,but given the situation you have many questions and apprehensions/doubts about life here and beyond.If you only turn to JESUS,HE IS our Healer and HE loves you and HE gave HIS own life to prove/show this, to remove the curse(which includes sickness) .JESUS is as close to you as your own breath in your lungs,if you ask HIM in prayer to heal you I GUARANTEE you HE wil .Because there is no record in the Holy Bible of JESUS turning down anybody who asked HIM for healing, and HE IS the same today,yesterday and forever(Hebrews 13:8).Ever a Loving,Merciful GOD/Healer.GOD BLESS Tremendously in JESUS name Amen!
Alodia in the end of the vid 😍

👑Princess Alodia Almira Latest Vlog Comments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iAQaxok_O8\n\nEvery vlog that you uploaded makes me smile @alodiaalmira it reminds me everytime that you are still what you are as being the Princess that your Dad wants to see! the spirit of #Princess Alodia Almira 👑 is still there everytime you #Cosplay.  Well you begin to dream as a Cosplayer and at the very end you'll also and always be a Cosplayer whatever happens in the future.. You know i dreamed also to become like you @alodiaalmira if only those opportunity and those destiny that has given to me went to success? Baka kasama na kita nuon pa last 7 yrs since year 2010 but things went smoother.. Because i made a wrong turn, or wrong decision in every time line, in every opportunity that comes along the way for 7 yrs or early than that we say 14 yrs since 2003. But that was all in the past.. So enough of excuses for me. The important is i am still alive and still fighting to make my dreams come true. Well I've heard this promise over many times by different people out there Action Speaks Louder Than Words I agree it is true. If other successful people apply this #principles to fulfill their dreams and their destiny. Why not me? I have waiting to make my Technology fruitful for 27 yrs since 1990 why not try to take risk and give all my best shot this year 2017? If the phoenix of #HarryPotter power is real, then if i have that similarities of Destiny why do try? And work hard to show to everyone that i am Useful and Helpful to the people especially the #poorpeople around the World? Then why not? Guys and @AlodiaAlmira. I've realize that there's no more time to hide i think it's for me to shine~! So please don't cursed me on past comments that I've post, peoples change so i am also can change! Help me don't take me down. 👽🙏\n\nBtw. I've made a Prayer for you all~ \n\nOur Father - God Almighty is an eternally creative and active recycling entity in a realm that extends from nothingness to all things whatsoever without exception. In short he is everything there is that Man can perceive and all those beyond his imagination forever. \n\nThis being the case, It becomes our duty to discover in this seemingly chaotic environment - the realities which are beneficial to us, Our Father provides his own body and soul with all things needed for survival - being a part of him we only have to find what we need. They are there for the taking, the bees know this from the flowers; the cattle from the grasses; the apes from the fruits; the rest from the nutrients of others and the soil to which they return.\n\nEventually, our physical constituency disperse to be part of others Ad-Infinitum. The soul is an enigma, it is consciousness of one's ego held together by Spiritual Energy, Man will never understand. But our Father gave man the ability to invent through Science Engineering, Technology and Philosophy.\n\nIn the meantime, that we do not understand what a soul is, let us record our constituency and consciousness in our Computers, to be stored, preserved and reconstituted back into our own selves, at some future time at our discretion, let us create our own Heaven where we can Live For All Eternity. ✨\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/g-buoy-frigillana/creating-our-own-heaven-/400811423614621/

Hugh, went str8 to hell..
dead. good. should have died along time ago. a disgrace to us men & manhood who respect women.  he was a piece of rubbish. good riddance.
Died with his dick in some underage girl. Nasty prick.
He died doing what he loved...looking at and fucking women
At least Hell has one less vacancy
I'm sorry but I cannot mourn the death of a man who spent most of his life objectifying women... he was a nasty nasty man...
Ya sex sells for whores not for decent women  who work hard and are pillar of this society so fuck him
Should you HATE Hugh Heffner? THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DEATH.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESrCFrStey4
Its all well and good talking mostly about the ILLUSION of 'women's choices' back then but the topic to me should have been W---H---Y HEFNER 'EMPOWERED' WOMEN (if you think that) or WHY HEFNER OBJECTIFIED WOMEN (if you think that). It appears the answer is the same - HEFNER 'USED' WOMEN FOR WEALTH and 'USED' WOMEN FOR HIS OWN SELF/SEXUAL GRATIFICATION! True no one forced any of those women but If a young woman you know CHOSE to sell her body in any way, would you 'empower' her by encourageing her to go ahead or would you 'empower' her with other options? EMPOWERMENT IS NOT EMPOWERMENT WITHOUT CHOICE. You are only 'empowered' according to your options and BAD CHOICES dont quate to being 'EMPOWERED'. Understand the definitions people. Are they telling me women had NO OTHER options back then? If there were no choices back then, how were they being empowered? More like sold the idea of it! (Talk about piss on my leg then tell me its raining). If Hefner empowered women, why was HE the one who had the most power overall? HE benefitted the MOST according to his assets! I wonder how many women he DISSUADED from prostitution regardless it was thier choice? How many non sexual women's issues did he give charity or support to? How many instances did he lend his support to that did not include sexual revelations to men or women? \nA black or latino or asian man would never get kudos with the same legacy as they would be called a PIMP or in a woman's case in the same position- a MADAM! Yet another example of America's double standards and blind existence of WHITE MALE priviledge! It was called Playboy Mansion because the owner was white and a male who knocked champagne glasses with the likes of. It would have been called a brothel if it were owned by a female or brothel if the owner was non white period. I love Whoopy but on this occasion, a woman taking 'her destiny in her own hands' should benefit her. Sure they chose to be bunnies ect but they were NOT empowered. A suicide victim does not 'empower' themselves when they CHOOSE to kill themselves nor do they benefit for the sake of taking 'thier desitiny in thier own hands'. In the same vein, STOP excusing Hugh Hefner's prolonged sexual deviance as EMPOWERMENT towards women. His empire was called PLAY'BOY' - the empowerment of boys and men NOT WOMEN. STOP with the praising of this man
RIP Mr.Playboy! old man sucks by the way, i am really happy about his death, ugly skinny cunt he was i believe! RIP Mr. playboy! take care, bye bye XD Playboy sucks! I'm sitting here at home all day, playing video games.this playboy dude was a muppet innit?

Rest In Peace Hugh he having good time with Satan or Heaven party like a legend.

RIP Hef the King of Playboy
And life goes on.............
Rip! A Playboy bunny tattoo now for me 😎
All these feminist in the comment section lol 😂
Huh well that sucks for the people that loved him. But since I never knew him well you went down as you lived as a playboy.
He was a degenerate
All you Christian feminazis need to shut your fucking mouth and show some respect to someone that just died you immoral scum.
whats with the sad music in the background.........
rest in peace hugh hefner your playboy products and tv show will continue to live on thanks for all the wonderful things you did for us men and woman bout makeing woman all over the world look more beautiful with their skin as well as thier clothing go in peace my friend my heart goes out to the hefner family and i hope hefner  legacy will continue to live on
The excess Viagra moved beyond his penis and throughout his body causing one big stiffy.
Back in the summer2016  went highland I saw a girl  wearing playboy playmate she had big boobs and my November trip to Las Vegas I saw hot womens strip clubs and wow rest in peace Hugh Hefner
Wow, the hell wait for hugh, burn forever.
THE GUY WAS A WALKING AND TALKING CORPSE BEFORE HE EVEN DIED.....I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD SPEAK FOR ITS SELF BUT YOU PEOPLE LIKE TO DEFEND WALKING AND TALKING GHOSTS.
Christian warns Hugh Hefner before his death to repent and believe the gospel...NOW HE IS IN HELLFIRE ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=40&v=6vKw7kp-vIg
In honor of Hugh, everybody give their wife or girlfriend a nut shot in the face tonight  !
at least they no longer have to suck his old dry dick
He got all that pussy back then!!
if you die a millionaire...youre probably going to...oh hell no! where you have to eat second rate pussy! and the women have semi non semetrical breasts! an alternate universe where donald trump is fred durst and fred durst is ted nugent...and where athletics are forced upon all people..even jumping jacks....and none of the women have blonde hair! none! but thanks to technology that world is made of plastic...the sex toy industry has officially secured hell...so he probably went to italy.
his penis will be missed
Has any of his women died?
Well he is finally stiff again
About the only thing worse than this perverted bastard is the moral-less, classless, clueless, nasty ass bunch of tramps who sold their soul right along with Hugh.. For broad is the path and wide is the gate that leads to destruction, and many will enter in..
HE is burning in HELL for his wickedness!!!!! He was a key figure in the moral decline of our society he was a filthy wretch!!!!!
He made the world worse made it disgusting
I actually hate cringey feminists but everyone knows God doesn’t want him
Straight to hell where he deserves to be :(
This man is *not* living in a better place. Where do you go from here? He hit his peak after 91 years
1926? dang I bet he kicked it with Charlie Chaplin
I just got a commercial for the movie Happy Death Day like way to go YouTube! Great timing!
People some loved him and some people hated him. That is the Hugh Hefner legacy. I'm sorry for his family loss. His name will live on.
Everyone saying R.I.P,  no he's not resting lol
Rip legend 😭😇
and busting hell wide ass open.
Died from massive erection
Helped bring porn mainstream. RIP
HILLARY 4 PRISON
From these comments I can see why women are becoming more feminist.

😿☠️
LARRY KKING TWEETED\nHE WAS A SEXY ICON
R.I.P. HEF

Why are there 30 dislikes?
For all y'all religious ppl saying he will burn in hell are ridiculous y'all act like y'all know what this man did in his entire life to help the world in any way he probably did way more than you fake ass christians ever did have any of yall donated before? What about help someone through college, the poor and homeless??? All y'all do is point y'all figures I pray y'all religious beliefs become y'all reality after death just like the Bible sayhe who cast the first stone shall be judged first so  I pray y'all be judged for every rock thrown yall toxic judgemental human beings clean your own shit first then worry about others Ike your preachers who's molesting children and stealing money which in my eye  is much worst than Hugh Hefner 🤷🏽‍♂️
#RIP Big Man! 😭🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😭😭😭💋💋💋💋💋 #HughHefner
Dirty old man!

now burn in hell
Rest in hell
Hugh Marston Hefner WAS NOTHING but a pimp.
Good riddance freak. Burn Hefner Burn
So many Feminists and Christanists in this comment section celebrating. \nNo wonder why your hero Hillary Lost!\n(Not a Trumpeter, I don't like him either).
Mixed feelings rest in peace
No way you can say he’s going to a better place because he was in a better place at the playboy mansion.
The world is better off without him.
Wonder if he went to hell. He was a womanizer. I went to his old high school in Chicago graduated in 2009. The principal swore he donated a million to the high school she must of spent the cash on herself because nothing was updated at the school.
It's about time, women are better off without him. He will now answer to God for his continued sinful ways.
Nobody can say he's in a better place
Rest easy brother ill take over from here ;)
Jesus he sexualize women and other women believe they had to be perfect. Because of Playboy many women got plastic surgery porn got more and more popular it was just ridiculous. He's a pervert
Pornography can lower the sense of self-esteem and self-worth of the wife because she may compare herself to the women that her husband is viewing on the screen.  She sees it as a slippery slope to addiction. It may also lead to an increase in the progression of rougher or more deviant sex. This contributes to the husband becoming more focused on his needs and not those of his wife.\n\nAll of the experts agree that a detachment of emotion during sex, and detachment from the relationship as a whole, is very dangerous to the viability of the marriage. Pornography is a poor substitute for the bonding version of sex.
This man enjoy every day of his life!!! My condolences to relatives....
*REST IN PUSSY*
RIP, Hef. You will\nbe sorely missed.
His soul will not be resting. Hope he repented.
A great man died
Any libshit on here who praises this man and condemns Trump for equivalent behavior is the biggest hypocrite on the planet. Further proof that liberals are animals.
Rest In Peace you lucky bastard! You will be missed!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel.

And are we sad about this
R.I.P Hugh \n\n\n\n\n\nHe will never be forgotten.
So heartbreaking
Finally old fart
Yuck
FUCK HIM\nBLOODY PERVERT
R.i.p
This comment section is full of a bunch of cucks, and fat ugly bitches who get no sex. I have nothing but respect for the man he achieved his dreams despite criticism and controversy. He made a fortune and slept with beautiful young women. RIP Hugh.
I need someone to formally educate me cause I see a lot of negative comments. Did Hugh abuse the women he worked with, or something bad? Because to say he deserves to rot in hell just because he's the founder of playboy is not reasonable at all.
Team Jonathan and steve get together
OMG !!!! Yes, please !!! Jonathan and Nancy are perfect together !!! Netflix itself ships it !!! There is STILL HOPE !!!! Please get together this season !!!

Damn excited for Season 2 ... can’t it come quickly.??!!! Plzz share a new trailer!!
Since this footage was shot on red, I think the footage was ran through a vhs cassette to make it look more 80s and 90s style with the music.
This reminds me of one of those cheesy romantic comedies made in the early 2000's.
I love this's but pls more season 2 trailers?
Roses are red \nviolets are blue\n let's get Justice for Barb \nand fuck Nancy's problems

What day does it release?
I miss mileven give me some mileven \n\n\nI’ll pay you
I love this kinda throwback trailers with this 80s vibe. Good job Netflix, you really put me in your 80s STRANGER vibe.
That triangle tho and rip best friend
So is Jancy happening or what..... PLEASE
wow netflix is really coming though with the ships
Honestly - Bless you for making this. Can't wait to see their relationship blossom in season two!
They should do the entire second season with these VHS effects
When does season 2 come out?
imagine thinking this is true. Jancy 4 life.
Okay this video is great but wtf is the thumbnail? 😂😂
i just hope they don't make nancy and jonathan a thing. 😕\ni was so glad this show didn't follow that girl-dates-a-popular-guy-but-suddenly-she-fallsinlove-with-that-weird-guy overused plot.
???????? What the hell is this shit??????
I am so weak for this <3 Netflix ships it!!
Why did this make me cry
Steve and Nancy are a beautiful couple!  And he even helped them in the end against the monster..
27 days to go.......
looks gay.
Wait, did Netflix just make a fan video of their own show???
Can we please get a version of the show in this filter!??? Make it happen Netflix.
This came out 1year ago and I still haven't watched it.
Let's face it, what we all really wanna focus on is eleven and mike's romance in this season/show.
If nancy and johnathon get together il kill myself cya
I ship Nancy and Eleven 😊
Is it just me or the one that Elle Mills made was so much better
Like So 80s Man. Can we call it Strange Love???\nAny way the trailer Rocks and one more month left for Season 2!!!
These characters are my favorite part of Stranger Things. Just set this to some 80's music - Tears for Fears or something. :)
Come on October 27th. I can't wait to watch one of my favorite Netflix shows
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE A HINT THAT THE LOVE TRIANGLE GETS REAL NEXT SEASON. Because Hopper and Joyce is where the real action is. damn.
*Beginning: He was a jerk.* \n*Ending: He was my favorite supporting cast.*
Lmaoo at 0:12 who thought that was Barbra?
i think the fuck not
Why this doesnt even have new footage!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is probably Netflix's best series of all time. All time!
JANCY JUST GOT A NEW SHOW. AWESOME
I'm a smidge a creep and a perv, and he even freaks me out; but, I am the goofy lovable perv.
so ready to see barb back on the stream :)
Mike: What was your test on? Human anatomy?\n\nMe: SHOTS FIRED OHHHH CRAP DANG OHMAGAWD FIRE ALARMS GO OFF
This was so so so so cute!!!! Loved it!❤️❤️❤️
NANCY AND JOHN SHOULD OF GOT TOGETHER! STILL PISSED 😡 😤
Netflix when is the 13 reasons why season 2 coming??!😅😅😅
Feels like a John Hughes movie.
>-< I thought this was another trailer XD
Nancy belongs with Johnathan not Steve, bottom line cut and fucking dry
The funny thing is, of this was an actual trailer, I would never watch it. But I love it in Stranger Things. I think it's because the rest of the show provides enough that I can avoid thinking about the romance when I need to.
Anyone who hasn't seen Stranger things and you don't like spoilers please don't watch this, it's not a trailer. It shows basically all of the scenes haha
Johnathans my fav i love him so much
JANCY IS MY FAVE! And can't wait to see them in S2
The power of editing lol
why did I watch Barb asking Nancy a question and think this was a season 2 trailer when I know that barb is dead?
omg me too
This is so cheesy
EDITING IS EVERYTHING
I'm so hyped that I'm rewatching the series for the 7th time 😂👌
I'M A JANCY SHIPER!

Voting is almost over ya Beautiful Bastards! Then we can all go back to doing... whatever it is we all do. lolololol. AGH. I'm gonna regret this Hooking Up thing, huh?
Instead of giving the NFL another dime, do what I did and Support a disabled veteran business by getting an awesome NFL =no Fans Left shirt at https://boycott-the-swamp.myshopify.com Hope the ENTIRE COUNTRY gets one and wears it!
NFL sucks now, love politics but just want to watch football............stopped watching my niners last year for one Kapernick's crap and come on people he REALLY REALLY sucks!!
NFL is a workplace.  Legally you can say whatever or protest, but you can get fired too.  Seems to me owners are being weak on this issue because of the nature of the business.  Stategically may not be able to fire players because another team could pick them up.  These pro athletes live in a bubble.  What a surprise it started in California.  Should give them same status as Puerto Rico.
SPORTS! Personally, I love them!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
The most problematic thing I find with the NFL/Trump thing is that he's calling to fire these athletes when they are expressing freedom of speech/expression. The President is going against freedom of expression by wanting to remove these players from their platform and that's very troublesome.
im curious, if someone gets fired because they kneeled, would that be considered wrongful termination?
Personally, it's all bs.this ain't news worthy when it comes to the NFL. You know, the NFL, that huge Cash cow that pays no taxes and has grossly overpaid players. It's going to bring the NFL views up and make more distractions for us to worry about.
I’ve given this a decent amount of thought. My social media feeds have been a slew of varying opinions on this topic. To denounce kneeling during the National Anthem is disrespectful to Veterans I think is an over generalization of what a Veteran is. We come from different backgrounds, socially, economically, and racially. “Veterans” isn’t a blanket statement that covers some autonomous thinking entity. Some Vets support the kneeling, some don’t. Please stop using all Veterans to bolster your argument, no matter the side.\n\nAs for my opinion on the matter. A protest needs to be uncomfortable and inconvenient. If it’s not one of these two things it can be ignored and a protest that can be ignored isn’t effective. \n\nFor decades Pro Athletes have been role models for kids. It’s not the same as another job. Someone working as a Pipe Fitter doesn’t have the same social impact on youth as someone who is on TV every week. That’s just the way it is. The NFL has awards for outreach into communities, this is something they want. To say that Athlete’s shouldn’t be political is to complete ignore their social importance to society.\n\nThe flag means more than just a representation of the military. The flag represents everything about this country, it’s history, the wars it’s fought, the economic depressions we’ve overcome, the scientific advancements we’ve achieved, and the social and economic adversities we still face today. To sum the flag up into just one of these causes is to ignore everything else about the country. I feel that goes for both sides of this argument.
The original player that refused to stand said why. But when i read it. All i heard was him sayin fuck this country in a nice way. He was deliberately disrespecting the country. For the other players to join them and now say thats not what they meant. Bullshit
14:40 freedom of speech, is freedom from legal punishment, not from social or fiscal consequences. You have a right to speak but not a right to be paid or empowered because of that speech. \n\nAdditionally if they were doing this for Christian or pro-American reasons we know they would pushed aside for less controversial players as those players have existed have been pushed aside in the past. \n\nNFL is under no legal obligation to play the national anthem. If they are not going to be patriotic about it, then don't bring it up at all.
Well... If you have a name like Weiner, this is what you should expect.
Someday this is gonna be a pretty high budget NFL movie.
I’m banned!  No more USA I guess.  ;)
White people acted like they care about black nfl players but calls Blm a satan spawns how hypocritical
I stopped following the NFL because there was way too many commercials and bullshit like national anthem and ceremonies to honor the troops killing people around the world. That's too bad because I really loved the sport.
Lol shut up Nascar, few years ago you were trying secede from America.
so tired of waking up to see what new dumb stuff that traitor president is doing..can't wait for the day I wake up to the news he is dead
The whispered message of whatever kneeling was to convey was overshadowed by the shout of disrespect.  It is the one communicating that bears the burden of making the message clear.  I would suggest a better way of communicating:  this may be an important message but it was lost in how it was communicated.
Why the fuck is the government interfering with private companies? this is big government at its finest
NASCAR suit on Donald trump, wow that's different
Dude Philip, why are you the clearest voice out there? We need more of you.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
The facts are out there that up until 2009 it wasnt mandatory that the players be on the field at all for the anthem. In 2009 the government paid the NFL to have the players on the field during the anthem to help boost recruitment numbers. NFL didn't go political politics came to them. Passed that how many time have you been at a bar or a party at house and seen ppl talking and not removing hat's during the anthem and nothing get said to them so because these athletes make millions of dollars they get treated differently. I for one have always stood and removed my hat even wen driving I'll remove my hat, but when ppl don't do so in public I understand that that's their right to do so and I can't take that from them.
Still a racist travel ban. Agree on N. Korea, but you need to allow N. Korean refugees though
What boycott?  Week 3 was 3% UP over 2016.  The alt-right, sycophantic Trump drones are either lying about boycotting or lying about being fans in the first place.
You can't run for office with that last name lmao
North Korea was definitely added so they could say it's not a Muslim ban. North Korean citizens can't normally travel abroad anyways. If trump knew that, I wouldn't hate him so much.
Tony Romo has 2 playoff wins and Tim Tebow has 1. Come on! You hire people to check stuff like this.
I think america's obsession with their flag is kinda weird and unsettling. But of course in my experience, nationalism only ends up being a double edged sword
Not in handcuffs , but out work lol..
With all the shit going on right now we are wasting the power of the government arguing about glorified games a flag is only as meaningful as the people willing to die for it but those people gave there lifes to allow you the right to shit on it part of freedom of speech is that everyone has it  i disapprove of what you say, but i will defend to the death your right to say it there is more important things then worring what a bunch of over payed athletes are doing when we fix all the other horse shit thats happening then we can focus on this problem if we haft to
I don't know, at this point the NFL should just stop the national anthem from being played during games temporarily just to simmer down the conflict,  and just get to the game.
this is ridiculous, not standing is a right. Its the same as not standing during the pledge of allegiance, whether that be in school or in a sport.
I think the NFL situation is ludicrous. The same people who spout how everything that is negative about Trump is fake news but they pass around the fake NFL rule talking about how players /should/ stand at attention when the anthem is played when this is not even mentioned at all. Let alone the page that the rule is apparently on even existing. I think people should calm the hell down and maybe get angry at the cause of them kneeling and not them kneeling during the anthem.
About the NFL, don't be mad, they were kneeling to pray to Jesus that they would win the game. And they were kneeling so they could worship the flag.
Holy crap. I feel so bad for Weiner's (ex) wife. Poor woman doesn't deserve that.
I live in Canada and I am in the Canadian navy and I just don’t think this would never happen here, but as an active member in the navy I would feel sad too see Canadians ever doing this but everyone one does have the right to free of speech and protest. I would have tired a different less harsh approach to the situation the trump did.
I don't stand for the pledge or the flag. I hate Trump thats one reason. Two, I respect soldiers that have died, and I show my respect in many different way. I just refuse to stand for the pledge because I'm an atheist and I dislike the under God part.
Obama was the one who divided us more then any other, it'd sad they can't see that
Saying NFL players are protesting the flag is like saying Rosa Parks was protesting public transportation.
Phil, im not from the US i dont live in the US either but viewing your videos and coming across this one i wanted  ask... the entire drama with the kneeling and standing form something someone in your country believes in , is freedom and it should be respected, right? but where im lost is that if people have issue with someone expressing themselves how they want and get called names of worse why dont those same people stand against BIG companies that make money from selling clothing reflecting the US flag?...  isnt this also consider a form of disrespectful regardless on whether or not some believe is a form of carrying the love for country with in clothing? just trying to get a grip on the reality we in right now... since the entire world is watching :)
how many times has trump disrespected our country and no one calls him out on it and when they do its called fake news its sad that he is allowed to get someone fired because he wants to show how big he is? wow America i hope he demands others to get fired for his ego maybe then people will open there eyes
TYT are great!  Congratulations!  I still dig Philip DeFranco, however.
Blind nationalism and blind following of political party are the sole reasons Trump is in office.
The Young Turks is not news
Multiple veterans and active duty members of our military have spoken out in defense of kneeling during the anthem, so now we see a political organization whom is ignoring the people it's claiming to defend in order to stir up it's base.
You all realize that he dose this every time that there are more important this happening in the world. I understand that the protest by the players is important, but it has been going on for so long that it is back burner news. Trump used this to cover up his failure to get aid to those in Puerto Rico properly and on time as well it's a bigger distraction from him trying to start war with North Korea. There is a bigger picture here. Why are you falling for his shit Phil. Don't be part of the masses! Please! It's one of the things I love about u and ur show
If you’re a PROfessional, you should act like one. Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech outside of their line of work. IF you’re getting paid millions to play a sport that’s not so difficult, you should be thankful for that opportunity the your flag is giving you. It’s funny because most people taking a knee were poor no bodies in life and now that they make millions they think they still matter.
When a citizen while occupying the highest office of the land calls other citizens Son of Bitches he is not only being disgraceful to the Presidency but to the Constitution and not worthy of a salute!
My brother is Army. Brother in law, Airforce. Husband... my entire world... Navy...\nStanding for the anthem, respecting the flag, is for those lost in the fight for freedom. Just because you CAN do something, doesnt mean you SHOULD. My husband hates what is happening. He thinks it is absolutely disgusting. He said he doesnt want your respect, but the fallen MORE than deserve it. \nKneeling is a slap in the face to those lost. And a slap in the face to the families of those lost.\nThey are multi millionaires. Their fanbases are enormous. There are soooo many different ways they could make their point known, without disrespecting the fallen.\nMy husband isnt an NFL fan, but i WAS. i refuse to give them anymore of my time or money, because they arent deserving of it.\nThese celebrities forget that the only value they hold to the vast majority of people ends the second they no longer entertain us. Or rather, the second them entertaining us comes at too great of a cost, or too big of an inconvenience.\nTrump likes to take things way too far, every chance he gets. This situation is no exception. I can say though that i agree with the call for a boycott.\nJust as they have the right to be disrespectful little shits to the men and woman who died for that right... we have the right to stand against their disgusting disrespect, and take away the one thing that matters most to them, their money.\nIf you continue to watch nfl, that is your decision and your right. But i certainly wont be. And neither will MANY of my friends.
Bullsh!t, Phil. Thats a crappy right in the middle of the road opinion you got, trying not to offend anybody and be 50/50 its everybody's fault BS. \nDid anybody (anybody) asked Kaepernick when he planned to stop protesting? What was his criterias? When zero minority is oppressed in this country? Was he planning to protest the National Anthem until the end of his f*cking career? \nPhil, enough. \nA f*cking football game isnt the place to protest the flag and the National Anthem because you're not happy about something. \nYou can protest before the game, after the game, publicly, privately, online, whatever. \nBut the football fans, who are held hostages and are forced to watch you also have the right to walk away. \nAnd thats what they're doing. \nThe players didn't understand that its not the NFL that pays their huge salaries. \nIts the fans. \nIts the eyeballs in front of the screens. \nThese players didn't think this thing through.
Real men stand up for what they believe in; they don't kneel 🇺🇸
On the whole standing for the national anthem thing, I feel like Trump is really driving a hyper-nationalist narrative.  You respect the flag or you're fired.  It is divisive, and I think Phil hit on a great point, the kneeling was in protest of social issues originally (specifically around policing).  I'm of the same mindset as a certain German scientist who once said, Nationalism is an infantile disease, it's the measles of humanity.  It seems the president is using his Nationalist rhetoric to create in-groups and out-groups, those who agree with or support the players, and those who do not.  Sad.
There's a time and place for everything. When you're at work that's not the time...
This comment might be long and probably won't be featured on the Friday show, but this has been dawning on my mind and needed to get it out. Hopefully y'all who do read it keep it civil and give your input.\n\nThis is my opinion when it comes to the whole flag debate. Personally I will stand for the anthem because it shows some kind of respect for the country, even though I'm not that patriotic, but I won't condemn people who kneel during the anthem because one it's their right to just like it's mine to stand. Also because from what I heard and seen it doesn't look like they're doing this to disrespect the flag, anthem or vets but more for social injustice. Do I think it got the message out? Most likely not because everyone is shouting at everyone about what's right and what's wrong and not having a civil conversation. It's just I'm right and you're wrong mentality with most of the people debating this. Could it have been done at a better time instead of during the national anthem? Probably. Because the players and the NFL are getting really bad publicity for it, but like they bad publicity is good publicity because it shined light on them, just probably not the way they wanted. But on the flip side it seems like people of color whenever they do protest peacefully it doesn't get attention or there are more complaints about why are they protesting? There's nothing to protest about so I can see why the NFL players may have protested like this. Also to add another opinion here, I don't think the national anthem should be played at sporting events. It kinda feels like forced patriotism. There are plenty of other days in the year where I can be patriotic if I feel like it. When I go to a game I'm not there to be patriotic. I'm there to watch players play the game and have fun. Though the exception to that is if the game calls on one of those patriotic day then that's fine to be patriotic. But that's my two cents.
Nothing says freedom like mandatory patriotism. It's like we're trying to be more North Korean than North Korea.
To be honest, I don't agree with kneeling during he anthem. I was raised the way that when the anthem comes on, I stand and put my hand over my heart (yes even in my house). However, I do believe police brutality is an incredible problem and should be protested. Do it like the Cowboys did it. Kneel before the anthem. But during show some respect.
I will always stand and respect our flag and anthem, but I I respect the right of other not to. However, what many are forgetting is that the players are employees. It would be well within the rights of a business owner to fire them as they were hired to play a game, not make a political statement.
I know this is going to sound very sour but Trump defiantly has his freedom of speech as well. I think its good that people aren't just in the background of these situations. Its good to flex the responses of people when freedom of speech gets put on the line. Its kind of wiping away the dust on our reasons to support our country in any sort of way. The challenge is good, annoying, but good.
I'm fine with the protesting, i know there's a lot of crap in this country, where i live i don't see it though, but i don't support it during the national anthem. It symbolizes a lot for any American who's lost a loved one or a friend in the military. So i say yes, do your protest, but leave it to a time not on a huge part of our countries culture, it's like throwing away maple syrup in canada. it's just not right.
the young turks won? ughh they have no class, no brains and no integrity. thats the only award they should win...that of sleeze bags
I believe people should have choice. But it really upsets me and I'm not even American. All those who died before us to allow us our luxuries now it's shameful to me. I don't think people should be fired outright but I think more people should be supporting their country and those fighting or who died for it instead of disripcting it from their comfy chairs heir expensive shoes stood on the football field. Shameful
Part of what has made the United States great is the fact that people are allowed to floss their ass with the flag in protest: They're allowed to demean our symbols. I thought it a tacit statement that the principles of our nation, the culture of our nation, and the people of our nation are so strong and resolute that we cannot be offended by such actions: We'll let you have your say. And we'll judge you, not for the act of protesting, but for your reason for protesting. If you're protestations are deemed legitimate you'll be praised, if not you'll be condemned. But evidently I was wrong. No one even seems to care about what's being protested, but rather how they're protesting. If you disagree with what they're protesting -- I know I do: Police malfeasance is a national issue, not a racial one -- then criticize their reason for protesting. The anthem is just a song and the flag is just a piece of fabric; no matter how they're robbed of their beauty it can't (or at least shouldn't) affect who we are as a country.
Kneeling for the flag=ok.Staying in locker room=not ok.imo
I don't know about y'all, but sports is supposed to be something we can watch to get away from politics. I think that the players should either stand or stay in the locker room but at the same time, Trump is ORDERING people to fire players! Sounds like dictatorship to me!
Being critical of your country isn't disrespectful, seems like a lot of the south has forgotten that.
They have a right to be free of arrest for grossly disrespecting the ideals of the country.  Everyone has a right to deny their hard earned money to them and to their employers.  Boycott until fired!
If you’re upset about people protesting during the national anthem of the football, you’re unpatriotic and you don’t believe in the principles and values of America. Yes that means you too Trump.
The American flag is often portrayed as a symbol of freedom, equality, and other goals that people fight and have fought to make a reality. In that sense the flag represent the country we want to become. I don't believe the people refuse to stand because they want to disrespect those goals and hopes for the US. They are trying to make a point that who we are and what most of us will say that flag represents are two very different things, that the flag as a symbol does not yet represent this country as a whole and we have to keep fighting to work toward that ideal.
As someone who has marched with the fucking flag across Safeco Field in Seattle, as a soldier in the US Army who has served in some form since I was in fucking high school, and as as a fucking Eagle Scout  - I need to say that Kaepernick not only has the right to kneel, but he was spot-on.\nDonald Trump is using this excuse of the knee to further divide the fabric of American society. If he is successful at dividing Americans in the arena of what is probably America's greatest religion - sports - than we are one step closer to loosing this nation.\nI don't know who Trump is doing this for - whether he is trying to bring back the glory of the Confederacy and have it finally secede from the Union, or if he is a secret Nazi, or if he is a Russian puppet - but every single thing he does is one step closer to the end of this fucking country.
You say you accept the players right to kneel but you don't like it. What don't you like? Do you not like peaceful protest? Do you not believe there is in justice? I don't understand.
The Flag means so much more than what you agree or disagree with. Men and women have sacrificed their LIVES so you can have the freedom to be a football player and make millions. No matter what you're political beliefs are, or if you like or dislike the current president, the flag needs to be respected. Regardless of our right of freedom of speech, I think it is and should be one of those  unwritten rules that the flag is not disrespected. What it stands for is far greater than what people are trying to protest by disrespecting it.
Man Anthony Weiner showing he didn't have a grip on his D-Brand.
Only 3 days old and boy o boy didn't the NFL do the opposite of your comments. Lol
Who would have thought I would ever defend a sport team even crazier a whole association for lack of better words, here's the annoying orange trying to separate the country once again. I thought we had freedoms in this country but I see their slowly fading away and being replaced with one sided patriotism and none sense SAD. I will never deny that people died defending this country it would be stupid to do so, but last time I checked they died defending our freedom to choose because that's what the United States is about. I was thought as an outsider to have respect the flag which I agree, but most of the time some of those people showed little to no respect towards who I am. Yes I am an immigrant but I have nothing but love and respect towards my country of origin and the United states and I side with Kaepernick this time. Until we fix all the inequality in this country I wouldn't stand for the anthem either because I don't feel free and sometimes even represented well with current government.
L on both sides its very clear nfl shot at its target audience and trump shot at nfl its stupid on both sides
NFL = No Fans Left   Fans could protest at nfl parking lot choke points, perhaps  w/ rental cars or LARGE trucks that run out of fuel. What if people did this and lock the doors and walk away ! Imagine DOZENS of cars blocking the parking lot PRE GAME w/ HUNDREDS of cars behind them. It will take HOURS to clear up the mess and the nfl AND THE CRY BABY DISRESPECTFUL TEAMS would loose MILLION$ of dollars. Anti-PROTEST = ON!
People might be more inclined to support the players if they werent such HUGE hypocrits! For decades police turned a blind eye to crimes committed by NFL players. Crimes like sexual abuse, rape, DWI, beating their wives (OJ is a good example here) and they, the players, didnt seem to have a problem with the police then! NFL players are dispropotionately arrested on domestic abuse, rape, sexual abuse, and a plethora of other charges, than the rest of the population. Shouldnt they clean their own house before critisizing others dirty houses?They are protesting what is also a false narrative as the stats just dont support what they claim to be protesting. Instead of protesting the problem 672 steps down the line how about protesting the fact that 6% of the population commits over 50% of violent crimes? How about prostesting the black on black violence and murder rate? How about the black abortion rate? Where are all the youth centers and mentor programs their millions of dollars could build and fund? How many black youths do they work with, and i dont just mean throwing money at the problem.Sure, they have a right to protest but protesting the National Anthem/Flag because of police brutality is like protesting God and the faithful because a bunch of priests are pedophiles.Also, I have the right to protest too but if I did it at my job I would be FIRED! There is a time and a place and while you are being paid millions to play a game is not the time or place to stick your middle finger up to people paying you to PLAY! If this really means that much to them they should address the problems directly, to the people being affected, not just tar every single police officer in the country.I get why they dont do that....because only having a few cases here or there doesnt get them near the attention that doing it during a nationally televised game does.They are presenting it like every police force has every other officer only targeting black people and that is as far from the truth and as false/misleading as the Hands up, dont shoot false, made up narrative that was spun by MSM.
Yay NASCAR
Being patriotic is a great way to become a racist. The flag is a piece of cloth. We don't need these things.\n\nBut someone who'd disrespect their own country in the way the NFL did don't sound to me like they have anyone's best interests at heart. It's those who appreciate America who can do the most good making it better. Anti-American actions like taking a knee only give support to those who want to see America toppled. Stand with America, and see it heal instead. You have to care about your country to mend it.\n\nI say this as an Englishman who can see what a fucked up place America is. But damn guys, respect the place you owe so much of you success to! If you wanna join a Black Lives Matter protest do that on your free time.
ja
Sucks
affect our AGENDA yeah exactly fucker !
Retarded americans..incredible!
What disease does weener have?
Mickey mantle doesn't pay my rent
Stop commenting.
Just gotta say lebron james- SHOTS FUCKIN FIRED xD that burn was beautiful
There is no confusion. Everyone knows why theyre doing. Either for the mistreatment of black people by police or to say FU Trump. We all know. The problem is youre using our National anthem that has nothing to do with police or Trump to protest. It pisses us off. It is disrespectful. Your intent doesn't matter. You dont use our flag and you dont use our National anthem. They stand for our great country that gave you the chance to be the privileged men you are. The anthem is to remember the men and women who have died for this country, for you! Its to respect the men and women that are in the military right now. They have their right to protest however they want it doesnt mean theyre not aholes for doing it.
The problem here is trump. There are bigger problems in the u.s. He should worry about those problems. They're expressing in a nonviolent way. Good for them. It blows my mind the way the leader, the president, expresses himself. He does not act like a professional.
In regards to standing for the national anthem or not, I think the most important part of this argument is being glossed over. What's important is to ask yourself will this action bring the results I want? If you're going to put your million dollar career on the line and risk offending millions of people, including those who cheer for you and pay your bills, at least make sure your results will be worth the risk!\nDid refusing to stand end racism? Did it call attention to the issue in a way that didn't ruin your career (like Beyonce's half time performance for example)?  Did it make African Americans look good? Did it soften people's hears toward African Americans? Did it stop police killing African American kids? That's what really matters. So should you really continue doing this? They say the definition of insanity is doing the SAME thing over and over, expecting DIFFERENT results...
You forgot to mention that Colin Kapernick wore socks that depicted police officers as pigs on the field and the NFL had no problem with that..  If he has a problem with the police as he used to say, instead of the flag, why not turn your backs on all police officers that are all around the field and stadium as security to protect the players and keep the peace??? Hmmm
I'm with NFL. It's a beautiful protests for a good cause and Trump should just stop making shit big. These players are acknowledging that there are these flaws in America and until they are fixed, they do not want to proudly stand to the anthem and I get it. Especially for the minority background or race players, this is important. If I came to America, I would be a minority. If there were enough lithuanians to be mistreated and heard about, I would dp the same
You guys over on that side of the pond need to chill, no need to be triggered when someone doesn't stand for the anthem/flag xD
Trump is condeming people for expressing their freedom of speech peacefully and rexpectfully, when it takes two days for him to make a small comment on teh KKK saying extremely racist and terrible things, and immediately goes on a rant about people peacefully protesting about social injustice, this reveals him as truly unamerican at heart.
*BOYCOTT THE NFL*
As stated in our declaration of independence, whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.  Regardless of what the protesting is about these people are kneeling because there is a problem and they want to make change which is their god given right as American citizens. The first step to solving a problem is admitting that there is one which is exactly what these role models of society are doing while they exercise their first amendement rights.
I dont get how people are saying “ Those players are at work. They shouldn’t do/ say anything that could cause division just bc they have a certain view and they should have consequences for doing so.“ and are siding with Trump, yet Trump is at all times the president or “on the job”, but he can say incredible bullshit that could easily cause division, yet he goes unpunished ? How hypocritical is that ? Do not pick and choose certain principles to apply just because they line up with your OWN. On another note every player has their own reason to kneel, how are you to assume they are doing so to show blatant disrespect for our fallen women/men. I highly doubt any of them are kneeling for that reason.
wow is that alex hunter?
20 v 20 shit again.. Bring back 32 vs 32 like it used to be in the real Battlefront 2.
Still wish you could just get into vehicles and the class was a spinny wheel. Looks better but I said that about the last one I'll wait to play till I rate
This is FUCKING CRAZY\nI want to buy it
Now, don't fuck it up!
I hope at the start of maps there probably be cut sence
I can’t wait
Being a gamer that grew up with Adventure on the Atari, i'm perfectly happy with this based on graphics alone. It's a reason I still find the first EA battlefront enjoyable.
It will be nostalgic AF i can't wait
Game of the year
It feels like an ad I'm looking for the skip whoops
EA may you please for all the OG childhood fans since the original BattleFront 1&2! Put in Galactic Conquest in single player and online! PLEASE EA!
Holy shit, my computer crying behind me, cause he know, he’ll burn from this😂
This is the game we deserve !!!! not battlefront one!!!! Don't fuck me like how u did in 1
Star Wars: Battle Royale.\nJesus EA you are sitting on a goldmine.
Looks great , will still be shit
I came a little...
I want to see a republic gun ship in this. I loved the ps2 version when i could pick up storm troopers or a friend and take them to the other side of the map or action
They should have idin versio have a camio in last jedi
These 14 locations don't mean shit if you are just going to tack em in behind an fps shooter. Get us some mmo games where we can explore these environments at our leisure.
Same as  bf huge pretty maps with poor gameplay not addictive and getting tired of it in 3 days?
I hope there are no in game things you need to buy
Yup I'm getting this...\n\n\n\n\nfinds out its ripoff
But the real question is...\n\n\n\n\n\n*W H E R E I S J A R J A R*
This could be fake
Will there be dlcs for battlefront 2?
I have a good feeling about this!
I'm curious if they're going to add Galactic Conquest in at some point in the future. That mode was super fun in the original Battlefront​ 2. Imagine if it was added, it would be a never-ending fight lol.
No it’s not.
More and more baby, I love this 👏👏👏👏👏👏🤘
I can already Imagen Starwars Battlefront 3 with the probability to travel across systems and control and conquer dreadnought class fleets and large fleets...
EA pls give us also more maps game modes and weapons
Hope it's 2 player online
And why Isnt finn in the game?
I don’t know much about Star Wars but wasn’t the first one 3rd person and is this first person?
The hype is real right now
Who has this on loop while they do there homework
So will there be a free season pass
Guys, this trailer reminds me of the old starwars battlefront 1 and 2...
I don't think I have ever been more excited for a game before
Make a next gen kotor already.
This is a HUGE upgrade from the first Battlefront. I don't know why people are so upset about it, as i've heard that the loot boxes are easy to get, which only requires credits. Plus, ALL DLC is for FREE. Please do research before coming to conclusions. This game is going to bring us a much better experience than the last Battlefront game. I'm looking forward to it :)
If EA made a transformers game it would so fucking kick ass.
I just wanna play this game im sick of waiting
I hope it’s not impossible to kill people like in the first game that’s fucking uncool
It's disgusting how many likes this video is getting... Sure it looks kool. But that's it... Heck... In many ways it doesn't look so kool... Hear me out.\n\nThe micro transactions for one thing. GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\n\nIt's from EA and Dice... They fuck up way more than they succeed. Also EA is one of the worst companies to ever show up in gaming. Lets not forget how many franchises they ruined... Command and conquer... Medal of honor... Sim city... Mass effect... Pretty much every sports game lol.\n\nThis actor should be ashamed of himself. Helping to advertise this game that's the demon of all video games... Corporate shilling shit bag... Just act in the movie and shut the fuck up about this horrible game please... Actually... You're character sucks ass anyways fin. Please die in the movies and stop acting entirely lol.
Owwww yeah that is so good
Fix the first game
5 multiplayer modes? That's it?
i expect the final game looks like the trailer...
But of course, it’s still on EA servers so don’t expect to much gameplay
Omg EA you’re releasing a good game!
I bet they paid John SOOO much fucking money to be part of this trailer and getting him to back the game considering he called EA out for lack of content in the last game and caused  issues for them.\nGood on him.
You lost me at 2:29 and it was going so well too.
I pre ordered it on the xbox because I believed the hype of the xbox1x but now I want it on my pc lol rip.
oh lit a remastered Battlefront 2? cause classes are not new...space battles...bnot new....etc...just because you failed to add it into your other one doesn't make this one new
HELL YEAH THIS GAME IS AMAZYING, I'M GONNA BE PLAYIN 24/7 WITH MY BROTHERS YOOOO
40 vs 40 Please, Maps feel to empty
If the game is free i will buy it!!!!
I want to believe... I want to hope that this will be as good as the PS2-era games...
Even the the fuking hand models on the First Order is bootiful
I would not buy this unless they changed their anticheat from Fairfight.
Please fix the arcade I want to have galactic assault as a game mode not just some boring survival style of gamemode
But... the vehicles can be used by more than one player?
Do you need playstation plus to play this or not
Why can't they just remaster the old battlefront games and call it a day I miss galactic conquest
They should add cad bane as a hero
This game has everything and anything a game should have, also, how did he get rid of his accent for the movie?
Please cut the bullshit and just give us some campaign gameplay. Funny how we have only seen about 20 seconds of actual gameplay of the campaign, and that includes leaks too.
I just realised it's John Boyega (Finn) speaking
Really excited for this, free dlc, actual campaign, 20 v 20 galactic conquest, space battles, what more could a person ask for?
*SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY*
This is a ripoff of Roblox because it has everything.
What is this?
Only 5 multi player modes???? Weakkkk
RIP Xbox
No micro transactions please!!!
Freaking awesome
IT LOOKS SO AWESOME!!
20 vs 20 LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

DLC 1\n\nUtapau\n-> General Grievous, Obi-Wan Kenobi\n\n\nDLC 2\n\nGeonosis\n-> Count Dooku, Mace Windu
No obi wan, no anakin, no mace windu, no count dooku, no geonosis, no mustafar, no utapau, no coruscant = no purchase.
Man, this looks so great, yet the two letters EA slapped on the title makes me very cautious. \n\nI'm hoping this doesn't devolve into a pay-to-win crate system, and endless DLC that makes it necessary to keep playing the game 6 months after launch.
I have no doubt this game is going to be amazing but I am afraid that most of these new contents will be locked through micro-transactions and expansion packs. It's a pity that there are so many brilliant games being ruined by unethical business practice from their publishers.
But did you make any changes to Vader? His force choke sucked in the first game since it could only target one person. Meanwhile, Luke could kill 6 people with his force push as long as they were close together.
Nice, but where are the 32 v 32 battles, and why do the microtransactions have to make it up to win, instead of being cosmetic?
looks good but i am little bit too scared of those creates hope it's not gonna end up like some p2w
They only have five multiplayer modes cause only five of the old bf modes got actually played
Hi, players this is John Boyega.\nAnd there goes any hope of buying this game. The fact that they put a recent Star Wars actor to explain the game should be a dead give away that something bad is coming with it. And then you have him announce the stupid loot crate system. What the heck to happen to skill in FPS games? Everyone has to get a participation medal (loot crate upgrade) or buy their way to get one faster. \n\nMom, I keep getting killed mom! Fix it Mom! Make EA fix it Mom! I want to be on top of the leader board mom! I Give me your credit card mom! I want to beat that guy who told me to get good mom!\n\nI'm sure the star wars and EA fanboys will justify this stupid system who
Thank you Sony! Best usage of money I've seen spent in 2017. You could easily fund a season or feature length anime and it would print money. I can't wait to see the new movie in October!
Weyland, Yutani, Tyrell and Wallace.
Genialer Film, geniales Universum & sehr guter Tie-In. Freue mich riesig auf 2049!
This was superb! As I'd expect from the creator of COWBOY BEBOP. I love the cyberpunk theme. Can't wait for BR2049 and Cyberpunk 2077 from CD Projekt.
Excellent, they should do a full movie!
LOVE THIS! WE NEED A FULL ON MOVIE.
15 minutes..............I want more!!!! Superb!!!
How to get subtitles in English?
3:30 David Bautista
This was really good :-)
Now this is pretty cool!
There's some nice call backs to the original film, like the noodle bar at 11:48 with the neon dragon sign where Deckard was eating at the beginning of the movie.
Fanfkntastic !!! ....... I'd love to see THIS on the 'big screen' !!!
This is a masterpiece
What a tasty morsel!\n\nCross your fingers! My hope is that the anime master is up for The Animatrix Chronology and a story arc that spans nearly a thousand years.. that lead up to the 4th coming Matrix sequel that it draws from.
they should make this into a movie or a series
I expect nothing less from the director of cowboy bebop
our lord, the savior,deckard will save the world.
Good one)All praise to Denis and Co.
Beautiful!!!
capto la esencia de  Blade Runner.
Really awesome

Meh.
superb....keep this going!!!!
Brilliant work.
Wonderful 👏
... Bravo!...
thank you
That was awesome!! More more more!!
meh
Amazing
Epico!!!!!!!!!
Better 3d effects in a anime than the new berserker
So, why not just do the 9th Star Wars film like this?
I don't like the song of the credits, too much pop.
Great drawings but I feels like too pathetic for that girl fellow. Her poor acting made me uncomfortable to watch this movie.
if the new movie is even half as good as this, we're gonna be in for something breathtaking
that's shit. Disliked.
LOL - So Blade Runner is doing exactly the same thing that the Matrix did with the Animatrix - small vignette animation to fill in the timeline - and they end up pretty much the same plot point. Thank you for destroying my hopes for 2049 with the dated supremacist vibes.. and the jihadi nexus doesn't get blown up by the explosion?
very good game
😀😀😀😀🙌👍👍👏👏👏

You guys can't attack properly I can 3 star that with ground attack😖😱😱😱😧😨😨
I like it thank for supercell
I just 3 starred a base with dragons. The dragons were only 4K elixir because of the event, same for the lighting spell. The base that I 3 starred had 1,100,000 elixir!\nThat’s what I call a “Positive elixir Trade”  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Clash of clans is my favourite game.Supercell can you give to me the Mega knight in clash royale
So is a Klaus a real life idiot? I think so. Makes it hard to listen when he talks. He makes himself sound like a retard child next to Galadon.

the game did not load after the last update \nwhat is wrong with that ?
When were you in Poland? Are there any vids from that trip?
Nice timing 11:11 when you ended the video
Great way to eat animals.. nothing wasted!!
I'm going to have to place a try when I go next year.
Mike, try South African cuisine!!
I think you should collab with First We Feast. Eat spicy chicken wings.
Love beets ever since does mike know that the Beet is a vegetable?
My favorite video by far!!!
DOES NO ONE NOTICE THAT THING BEHIND MIKE THIS SHOULD BE DEMONITISED
And then I realised I had some pizza left in my fridge. I feel so cheap xD
I can't eat thin stuff with a fork. I can only do it with chopsticks
Spanish restaurant, really ? Ok but with a lot of french cuisine influence.
Is the pig skin pasta not on the menu?
Damn it Mike. Lol, you expression just says it all.
Man that chick in the painting is kicking em out wide
Wow. Quality and Presentation written all over this restaurant.
I would have been the on customer to lick the plates
I think I lost weight from my mouth watering for 11 minutes... Hmmm
do you have to pay these restaurants any money to film inside?
This was really difficult to watch because of the painting behind you, the chef's accent,  and the house music that was playing in the background.  And for me, personally, the combinations of flavors and ingredients did not really look that appetizing.
A little too primal for me... but I would be lying if I said my mouth wasn't watering the entire time.
so who was holding the second fork ???
Your video's are always the best mike❤❤
How can he eat so much without getting full!
I have been to Dehesa. It is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Every dish the chef serves is a flavour bomb.
I'm just gona come right out and say it, Mr. Chen, you are really a great critic, in the sence that you cut the hypocritical BS upper class swines love to impregnate humble and high end kitchens alike. \n\nWe commend you, aqui do Brasil.
Good marketing when a restaurant reached out to a food channel.  Costs a miniscule amount in product to reach out to over 100k-400k people.
I live in Singapore
Glad you liked Singapore I am from Singapore BTW
Sad to say this looks terribly pretentious and is presented with alot of intentional smokescreens. When he brought the ice-cream with no sugar then proceed to stab it with caramel..and kept saying, no sugar, that really took the cake with that kind of comment.
Oh, using all the cuts of pork. I thought it's about actually eating the whole pig.
Look out, you are getting fat
Loved how the chef explained each and every dish in detail. Thanks for uploading. 😊
i love your background music choices haha.
Wow. I love that food 😍
2:57 He has three arms?
I enjoy your videos as they are interesting, informative, and I get to travel with you to so many places.  All I can say about this meal is Better You Than Me, LOL, because I wouldn't have been willing to try any of it, except for maybe the dessert.  But I'm so happy that it was an amazing meal for you!  : D
the picture behind you at 2:10 ...why!!!!!!!!!!! lol
I NEED to be there!
My eyes 👀 went directly to the painting 😱
Come to newfoundland, we have the best seafood in the world. From cod fish to lobster.
What is the name of that instrumental you're using???
You make my food taste crap while watching this video. Thank you
i love mike so much but the auto focus drives me insane!
From the rooter to the tooter. Well done!
This looks incredible! That beef cheek, and the pigs head dish omg...drooling lol
I love how he puts everything On the bread, the cheeks the fat the bone marrow and walnut. I love eating like that. All in one big bite.
An Chinese guy at a restaurant in Singapore ran by a French chef listening to American Rock and Roll
Love the painting in the back ground lol
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
I love how happy food makes you
The food looks good
Who was the second fork XD?
that chef is AMAZING
Aww! You didn't show the hot pepper reaction!
Great food!! Can you do some tofu dishes in your future videos?
the dessert presentation was beautiful. the food overall looked amazing
Is this meal ok to eat if you are vegan?
4:44 am i the only one who kept noticing the background
Nice girlfriend in the background
Cats?? Do you have any cats??
i was amazed at what that chef can do his a food genius
The chef is french ?
TURN DOWN FOR WHAT
I sweat to god i am going there one day! I NEED THAT FOOD IN MY LIFE!!
I always wanted to go singapore, i will have to plan a visit there very soon.  What an amazing food
I'd do anything to taste those cheeks...I mean anything....I'm talking butt stuff idec
Hey Mike.... Turn down for what? Lol
Since no one mentioned.... Who's the girl next to you Mike? :)
Honestly, one of the best food adventure channels on Youtube. Keep up the great work Mikey!!!
Am I the only one who keeps salivating? 😂
Why can we not taste the food yet!? I mean c'mon [insert  company here] it's 2017!
So the cannibal version of this restaurant would be called head to toe.
Ice cream like a 65%
Anyone else notice that his video ends at 11:11 😂
Why does he have the pepper up his nose on the link to click the video. Fail
I've eaten a whole animal before!\n\n\n\n\nI'm not even a teen yet...
Ha ha from asshole to appetite.  Love the background music.  Have you tried oxtail stew or rocky mountian oysters. Maybe fish cheek and tongue...the cheeks taste like scallops.  Fish eggs/spon.?  My husband likes odd dishes. Real odd. He even eats groundhogs. YUK.  I have had raw clams.
The painting behind tho😶😂... You know he did that on purpose lol
Does mikey use gimbal?? 🤔🤔
😋😋😋😋😍
yucks!
This was a delicious video as always but they were just using the nose to tail concept as opposed to actually featuring it.
another great vid
Just added this restaurant to my bucket list!!!!!!
britney spears is mentally ill
🐷💕
lemi guess.. $300?
Wow! All the food looks delicious! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love bone marrow
That looked soooooo awesome.
Absolutely incredible video!
Dying to try that spicy sauce!
2:56 Mike has 3 hands ????
Absolutely sadistic

Hey so in your room tour you were petting your dog. I have never had so many tingles in my life so an entire video petting roscoe would be awesome
Weird hearing her voice not whispered, sounds different
OMG THE ONE TIME IM NOT AT DISNEYLAND SHES THERE IM SO UNLUCKY\n\n\nEDIT: Wait is it bad I've watched her for a day and I do her intro with her?
Ayyyyyyyy  I was at LA in summer watching these vids. Welp I went there cuz I live in San Francisco.

I feel like it’s with Shane Dawson
Girl you’re not in LA you’re in Anaheim, Orange County.
She went to LA to find Jake Paul
I love you
I live in California! And I've been to Disneyland 3 or 4 times
Please. I know you're a tourist in socal but please realize Disneyland is NOT in L.A. It's in Orange County.
I miss California. I lived there. But my step dad is a marine. So for now I'm in Massachusetts

You are so beautifullllll.. I just can't handle it. So happy it's finally fall time, and we can do vampy lips!!

HI CHRISTEN !!! ♥️ I recently seen your snaps and how your eyes been twitching, also how you said you had Bell’s palsy when you were 16, My mom she’s 31 yrs old and she had gotten Bell’s palsy when she was 10 and In January she came home from work and she felt numbness on the right side of her face and she went to the E.R. And found out she had Bell’s palsy. To treat her Bell’s palsy she went to acupuncture and physical therapy, and did facial exercises. Hopefully you don’t have it because you are the best person on YouTube I’ve seen doing makeup💕♥️ I hope I could help💯💕🤞🏼🙏🏼
Am only 11 and I have watched all of your videos. I love your channel so much
love love love! love the intensity of the look, the deep purple kind fall colors and that lipstick! gah! the gold eyeliner is perfect with it and even your outfit *cries* so beautiful! <3
Probably one of my favourites of your looks! Thanks for giving us short and sweet tutorials 😋
I love you christen i am from lebanon and i liked all your videos befor watching it cz i know you are  perfect 😍😘😘❤
i like how you always cut yourself off in the middle of talking like you wanna tell yourself: shut up, Christen.
Love everything about this look! Fabulous! 😍😍😍
I'm stuck at home watching these vids...
Wow no highlighter? 😱 love you so much Christen!!! ❤️
You are so lucky. Meaning your god-given  features of very big eyes and huge lid space make application of make up ideal.  Also you quite smartly play up their size. It’s a gorgeous look and thank you for sharing it with us.
What's her foundation shade in that foundation 😭😭
In need of a new basic drugstore fall look!
In love with this look #flawless 😍😍😍😍😩

Chance- Rap, Poetry, Soul, Hip-Hop, R&B.\nA real beautiful musician that will be here for the long run, this just reassured that once again.
How to not love Chance?
one of his best and it's unreleased damn
this is the best
Chance + Daniel Caesar = Everything that's right about music right now
this is so powerful
Its only downhill from here i could teach snowboards? Thats why hes my favorite rapper
my heart's so full.
Think I'm officially a fan. I've been sleeping in him
I hear God in this song
Joe budden is a duck head
Exactly why I fell in love with Chance
HE DID THIS AT FOREST HILLS ON WEDNESDAY AND THAT LINE ON HIS KID NOT RECOGNIZING HIM WITHOUT THE HAT HIT SO HARD MAN, HIT SO FUCKING HARD
this is too happy
Damn chano you surprised me with this one. Thought you were were getting complacent with your music but this is growth
I go to church they wanna flick I wanna flip the table. \nGenius
So good how can you not like this?
How could Joe Budden honestly laugh at this? At times, he can be really narcissistic. He will cry about how mental health isn't addressed enough, but will laugh when Chance the Rapper expresses many millennial angsts. 🙄
Good stuff. The song title and the spoken-word style is in the tradition of Gil-Scott Heron, although Chance is a bit more on the r&b side of things than the jazz side.\n\nBut it's nice to see a new generation of rap and music fans (re)discover this type of music.\n\nIs the ready or not refrain a borrow from the hit song by the Fugees back in the 90's?
watch joe budden reaction to this on everyday struggle it will make your year
Wow.  reminds me of Marvin Gay--What's Going On.
I got chills when he said Ard... the spirit's moving now
some spoken word shit
#D.O.P.E
chance + daniel =  perfection
Wow
lord help me
Joe Budden be buggin
This fucking collab though.
Absolute fire
pretty decent song
That was beautiful
3rd Verse 🙏
but Joe Budden ...smh
Damn
thirdstory woooooooppp wooooppp
Joe budden brought me here
So nostalgic
🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝
This is insane
Damn Chance,,
Soulja Boy >>>>>>>> Chance The Rapper
Chano better release this shit for real
He will always be my favorite artist fuck dem haters, chance is gonna keep making it to the top 1 of the artists making it big  rn. Whenever I listen to chance he make me feel like all my problems are gone and that everything is gonna be OK in the long run 😇
Fuck Joe Budden, to anyone who knows what I mean more power to you.
By the end it seems that Chance re did the performance, this was perfect
What’s the name of this song?!?? And when will it be officially released?!?
Swear chance makes some of the realest stuff 👌🏾
Daniel and chance... Damn so refreshing n leaves u thinking.. M
Hadnt felt chance in a while but he really killed it in this one
Only problem is the beats to soft
Have never followed Rap. Thanks to David Brooks of NYTimes and his column about authentic truth, I have played this multiple times and am grateful to Chance the Rapper and his group for an incredibly fine performance and distillation of his Truth and open Honesty. So deeply moved. Thank You,  May your daughter know you without your hat, the Day Comes for each of us, First World or Third, and for our suffering citizens in Puerto Rico. May they too have a morning of peace. The day is gonna come --- here it is.
fuck joe this song is good evil ass niga
This is next level chance
I laugh because of joe budden
I get sad when I look at the stars\nThey so pretty you can't tell them apart\nYou think they close but really we far\nAnd really they ain't even that much closer to god\n\nIt's much harder to sin naked\nI walk past apple trees and didn't take it\nThought about stone mattresses, thin blankets\nReally long winter spent in a windbreaker\nI'm a temptation door knocker\nDiming on lower walker\n\nI'm a rich excuse for a father\nYou just can't tour a toddler\nShe turning 2, she don't need diapers she just need a papa\nI really need a a break, could you really use nap\nMy daughter barely recognize me when I loose the hat\nYou go so far you hit a point where you can't Uber back\nThe other day I told a hummingbird he too relaxed\n\nI did my worst I did the work I had to skip the label\nI go to church they want a flick I wanna flip the table\nYou knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable\nAnd now its just a fable, and its just as fatal\n\nFirst world problems that niggas make up\nHave a dream and then never wake up\nWhen so much turns to too much have a dream and then never wake up\n\nThe day is on its way it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes (here it comes) ready or not (ready or not)\nThe day is on its way it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes (here it comes), ready or not, here it comes\n\nI think my little cousins want they cousin back\nThe automatic quarterback that doesn't rap\nThey know I used to drive the hammond for the roman candles\nLied about coming back\nThe last straw hat that broke the camel\nIt ain't really fun to hang with me no more\nWe can't go to River East or hang at the beach nomore\nIts messed up I made it this way and my feet so sore\nBut it's all downhill from here\nI could teach snowboards\n\nI miss my mom I miss my time\nI missed my prime in high school\nI missed my prom I ditched my date\nI missed my beat\nKissed my teeth\nKicked my feet\nHooped and Hollered\nNow I just sip my tea\nSit my ass on my ass\nSend my tweet\nFold my arms twist my weed\nI If I had heard the news I would have known what he say\nBut the recliner on my chair is like an emergency break\nYou know\n\nFirst world problems that niggas make up\nHave a dream and then never wake up\nWhen so much turns to too much have a dream and then never wake up\n\nThe day is on its way it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes(here it comes), ready or not (ready or not)\nThe day is on its way it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes, ready or not, here it comes\n\nThree verses hell yes\nI still ain't get my grammies in the mail yet\nI just want my momma happy like a toy sale\nAnd to stay connected to the world like a long ass voicemail\nI hear the seams snapping\nAnd I'm the team captain\nNo more knee slapping or shoe shining or shoe signing till the dream happens\nI'm just gonna keep rapping\nAnd y'all just keep clapping and keep happening\nLike Flint got clean water\nAnd y'all don't got teen daughters and black friends and\nGay cousins, Y'all just don't say nothing\nKnow that the day coming\nKnees bowed, tongues confessing\nThe last one getting first dibs on blessings\n\nNow these first world problems that niggas make up\nKeep on playing we gonna shake this shit up\nKeep on telling us we're making it up\nThe American dream may you never wake up\n\nThe day is on its way it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes, ready or not, ready or not (ready or not), here it comes\nThe day on his way in wished my way another day, so more\nThe day is on his way I cannot wait, here is to stay, no more\n(tell 'em one more time)\nThe day is on its way it couldn't wait no more\nThere it is
I wish I could get paid for just speaking lyrics.
There's something so fucken magical with Chance's music!! Love him and loved this performance. :)
I'm glad Daniel Caesar is getting the exposure he deserves. I have Freudian on loop!
I swear, I love the joy Chance gets from his music! Daniel Caesar is a remarkable talent as well. Everything just fit together so perfectly. It certainly had life! LOVE IT 🙌🏾
Is this song on Apple Music yet ?
I think the song (going off of what he was rapping should be called either First World Problems or The Day
FUCKING CHANCE AND DANIEL CAESAR YESSSSS
damn daniel
😭
Overrated
Art
fuck joe budden
Anyone got the guitar tabs?
so good!
I love Joe lmao hes Funny AF
God damn
3rd verse gave me chills!
Beautiful 🙏
Wow... wow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow
Fire 10/10
y dey censor dis niggas mouth
Music
Chance is such a sincere music artist unlike all the other artists who only care about their brand and name for themselves... CHANCE CARES ABOUT HIS SOUL.
honestly brought a tear to my eye..... no words for how great this was.
Holy shit at the you can really hear how good their voices are together\nShit maybe rather want a Daniel & Chance album than Childish & Chance
fwkin beautiful
Fuck joe budden
chance the poet
So good
So beautiful, soulful, mind clearing.. simply amazing
3 verses , hell yes!!!!
The other day I told a humming bird he too relaxed.  \n\nChance' s work ethic is insane.
I'm a... Rich excuse for a father. Ouch... my soul
Third story is there I'm crying literally chance and Daniel and them my life is complete
Man, chance is super talented. Chicago is really a special place for black people. Obama, Oprah, Kanye, Chance and many more..
“Have a dream and then never wake up” now that’s an Instagram caption
I'm low key feeling like this was a freestyle..so much passion😭😭😭😭
CHICAGO STAND UP!!
Chills
The honesty
Breathtaking!
Yo fuck Joe Budden, this is poetic
Lol they censored his mouth
Yessssss!
OMG they are so good
Thank so much  for  wonderful song Bolbbalgan4

볼빨간사춘기 목소리 너무 좋아
볼빨간 요즘들어 자꾸눈에가고 비슷한사람이 눈에가는데 이거 초록불빛입니까?
노래 진짜 좋아ㅜㅜㅜ 만약 노래가 이상하더라도 목소리가 다 살릴듯
옛날에는 교포발음이렇게 심하지않았는데 이걸로 컨셉잡은듯 못알아듣겠음

목소리 분위기 살릴려고 금발 계속 하는 전략은 알겠는데 계속 보니 질리고 살짝 혐스럽다 귀여운척 졸라 하는것도.... 얼굴은 배두나 느낌나는데... 옆에 기타치는 현실 얼굴이 보기엔 훨 좋구만 뭘
Estaba esperando su regreso. Hacen la combinacion perfecta. La voz mas dulce que he escuchado hasta ahora 😍😍😍💕💕💕👍

Awesome channel. #2 on Youtube. I hope to be like you some day!!
우지윤인가 쟤는 토템이냐??솔직히 없어도 티도 안날듯
The worst meal I ever prepared was the one I made the night I proposed to my wife...  Nerves I guess...  Still married 25 years later though.
This a fantastic example of video sponsorship done right! Awesome job YSAC & Hello Fresh
What's the name of the sad song you play all the time?
Cucumbers are a fruit, specifically a false berry because they grow from an inferior ovary;( this means that the flower has more than one ovary for growing seeds real berry flowers have one), just like blueberries and cranberries  you should have added them to the ice cream.
I FUCKING LOVE YOU
I can't tell you how much I envy your knife skills. I try to emulate them, but...well, the doc said they couldn't reattach one finger, but did the other, so I should be back at it soo...in a while, few months, year or so. But, I'll keep watching, so I can learn more!!
*E A R  S Y R U P*
This is legitimately sad help
i think YSAC went through a bad breakup, it's ok just subtly tell us with cucumber slices
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
What ever happened  to Dennis (the egg)?
Pant stainer, is that your nickname at school?
pan stainer HA! \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Oh my fucking God. Your videos are soooo good.
I love how your videos are instructional and also entertaining enough to distract me from the reality of my life that I'm the kind of person that doesn't even get dates with mannequins in wigs not really romantically but just to eat some food I made. But I do eat tasty food so that counts for something maybe kind of like.
Fuck man, I feel like the ending will happen to me
YSAC, sorry your dates dont work out. Invite me over, I'll read all your subliminal messages and even stay for ice cream.
This was deep, who hurt you
I'll make some for me and...\n\n\n\n\n\nme..?😓
Hey! How do you feel about tapenade? I think you could make a great tapenade video.
I just made this and it was honestly so good
Dude. You could have cooked ramen with raw fish on top, burned the water, let all the steam escape, your personality is what would have made it happen.
Fek. That hit me hard in the feel dangit.
I am a very tall midget
Do it. Or dont do it. It's your life. \n\n*a second later*\n\nSubscribe or die
Hello Fresh is the culinary equivalent of Tinder: Looks great on paper, but it's going to be a let-down once you try it out.
That moment when your name is Shannon
What is this ‘toss’? I thought it was wangjangling
I love you r channel. Great job! Great editing!
Would this be good with shrimp?
You sound like Mr nightmare
i cant have tomato skin in my spaghetti. its disgusting. you have to peel them.
Jesus fucking Christ you must drink a lot of water I can see all of your veins popping out
I'm holding back tears, this video is so powerful.
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE COOL, him making a video about how to wash dishes...
There are SO MANY ways to spice up cheap ramen noodles! You should do a vid on some of them. **This idea is trademarked. You will owe me $608.00 if you use it. Cutting you some slack 'cause good content.**
Question! Why did you put the 0 under your finger?
Made this for my parents without the cucumbers
The steps taken to sabotage yourself is the best.
but she went on date with me after to taco Bell to me proposing... ;)
I had no idea that water could get hotter than boiling and I work for a public water supplier.
Dude my wife's name is Shannan.. and guess what my name is. Shits fucked up yo...
Dude, you are better than that pasty bitch!
Wow, pretty dark video on this one, eh?
I literal lol at all these videos.  Usually,  I just giggle or think Oh that's funny. But this guy gets belly laughs every time
When did this channel get so dark? Also, no song at the end? :(

Always live the WangJangel but no Pepper Pepper Pepper this time😥
That trash thing might actually be a good idea
lol... actually you suck at cooking, i mean i guess its nutritious... but in no way do i think it tasted very good...
Watch as a young YouTuber slowly slips into insanity....
I had a genuine wave of despondency when the mannequin walked out on you.
Your channel is the sole reason I decided to give Hello Fresh a try..  no regrets o.o
Get some olive oil in the pan\n*empty's the whole bottle*\nBut be careful! Do not pour too much..

I'm just living for your nails!
I wish Charles would accept his beautiful brown eyes more instead of hiding them with his contacts..
He's so amazing ❤
If your relying on clickbait that means your not entertaining 👀
That was absolutely beautiful.
Let your wings cut those bitches up james
THIS LOOK IS SO SO SOOOOO BOMB
When he talks he looks half asleep😂😂 I love how real you are❤️❤️
Damn. Got my hopes up for nothing.
James Charles I thought I ordered some sisters merch, but I haven't received it but when I was ordering it it said it went through and that I would be getting an email, but I haven't received one
Cutting straight to the point *14: 41 to find out it was freaking clickbait*
Who else watches James Charles on 0.75 speed since he talks so fast?! 😂
I think you are so chill.you are pretty and handsome at the same time! Can u do more cover girl products?
I was looking for a lip liner that would work with all my different lipsticks. I didn't know covergirl offered a product like that.
I only clicked on this because it said he was leaving YouTube... I'm a victim of clickbait
Okay we get it, you think he speaks fast, Whatever. Jeez! 😂
when he says to get ready with him i really dont cuz i dont have makeup i just eat and wait if my future comes on a bottom of a bowl of cereal
By the title I thought you were leaving forever! Omg if you ever permanently left YouTube I'm gonna be upset but I understand why you needed a break.
the eyes are absolutely beautiful omg
You are such a beautiful human and you honestly my icon and honestly you should never listen to any of those negative people because all of your fans love you so much ❤️❤️❤️
You are so  talented I've learned so much from you and you are amazing don't listen to anyone. Your hands are gold and you deserve everything that you've achieved. Love you❤️❤️
THIS MAKEUP IS EVERYTHING! 😍
You're talking so dang fast in this video woooooh!!  Lol but I agree
Awww James it's all okay . We don't think you're complaining at all . We love you more than anything . Also sisters stay sisters for life . Stick like glue ♥️
you should do a deep/dark green look! i think it will bring out your eyes
you'd make a great auctioneer damn
I thought it was funny how james would be talking about something serious and then he would stop and be like im gonna take my clean morphe m brush... ps i love you so much
I actually love him, but why does he sound like his nose is always stuffed?
I loooove everything about you    😍❤i watch you'r video's every single dayyyy, thinking omg omg you do this makeup sooo perfect, can i do this? In my head: so,i go downstairs into my bathroom preparing my make up, and the  i can't do this I litterly looked like friking frankenstain😂😂              (i'm 14 btw)

James u r a amazing person,you deserve the world ❤️
You make me want to puke.
Clickbait is real
Click bait asf🙄

That eye look 😍😍
This was so clickbait
maybe lick your lips once in a while....i'm tired of seeing that dried up crust line on the corner of your mouth 😂
You're absolutely amazing and gorgeous, not just your face but your personality. Don't let the hate get to you because there's so many people that look up to you and love you. Keep being you and keep being a fantastic role model❤️ love you sister😘❤️
i just started watching your videos and IM IN LOVE WITH YOU AND ALL THAT YOU STAND FOR 💖💖 and ur so beautiful inside and out keep doing you boo!

Omg you are such a beautiful human.I remember when I first started watching you and I wanted all my friends to watch you too.But they didn't like that you were a guy doing makeup. So I said the hell with them because you are such a positive person who gives me life.Love You Sister Forever❤❤
i want to go to college not to do my makeup on camera lol. sorry if people get butt hurt but yeah. i don’t think he isn’t grateful or anything so anyways.. yeah i forgot my point. omg i am so dumb lol.

Hey sisters any small youtubers wanna support each other? :)
I was just about to say.. It was about time, finally 😂
YOU HAVE FUCKING HORSE TEETH GO EAT SOME FUCKING GRAIN AND SWEET FEED GO RUN OFF INTO A FUCKING MEADOW YOU SWEET BOOTY BITCH
Thank you for always being so honest and transparent.  You have a gift, and are insanely talented.  I'm glad I watched this video though, because based on the title alone, I almost unsubscribed, thinking you were going to stop doing YouTube......
Loved this video so much. Thanks for being so open with us, I agree being internet famous seems great but even I know I couldn't imagine how much hate you guys receive and money cannot buy happiness and y'all need a social media break sometime! You guys are all watched under a microscope and yes it's what you signed up for but doesn't mean it can't get exhausting! You're human and we all need to realize that we're all human we all fuck up and we all should be able to move on and LIVE!
I liked the eye look before you cut the crease. You could've left it like that. It was beautiful
Omg! i didn't know that was that much negativity! and i been warching you for a while and i didn' t think that i should say, because i think that you weren't that affected about all that, but keep going on what you do! and keeo smiling!💕
Love your makeup but why would you make your title such clickbait.. lol I don't understand why you wouldn't just title it addressing the hate or something like that.
you should be flashback mary for halloween
Why doesn't James ever blend his foundation into his neck properly? You can clearly see how tan his foundation is next to his neck...
Not being horrible but how crusty are his lips , no hate i love him <3
This look was so fucking pretty 😩😍🔥
Can you Do the power of make up video?❤️
Love you James, your amazing and I love you so so much<3 your amazing and deserve so much better <333 I love you 💕 @jamescharles

O M actual G, holy shitballs how is this trending
Did anyone actually design the trending tab?

Thank you Ipswich! Brightened up my day!
TOWN 4 THE CROWN 👑
We had enough highlights last night to fill a 90 minute video. Only 2 minutes? We were on fire last night. COYB! 🚜🚜🚜🚜
Let's all take a second to laugh at Sunderland
This is 15th on trending
Goals are like potato chips. One is never enough.
What was Steele doing for that 5th goal 😂😂😂 can't believe I got 66/1 on this pile of crap being relegated & 12/1 bottom half finish
Shouldn't have left blackburn🤣
Waghorn doing it again against his team
Its trending cuz Sunderland were at the top and now lost 5-2 wow
Sunderland is a joke of a club. Goodbye Sunderland , being in the premiere league is history for you guys. You guys will never make it back. Oh and BTW, I'm a man u fan and I miss the guaranteed 6points every season. Anyway seems like crystal palace will be more than happy to hand out this service.
wat happend to sunderland

How on earth to Millwall have higher odds on promotion than Ipswich
Sunderland fans 10, Ipswich fans 1. SAFC were thrashed 5-2 but the away end sang for 90 minutes. Never experienced such a lame home crowd. It's like they're in the waiting room at the doctors – until they score the fifth! Aldershot would make more noise away at Carlisle.

He should do more covers with Madison 😁 They sound so good together ❤️❤️❤️

Marques is so composed it would be amazing watching him getting torn down by those wings.

I think once Apple adds fingerprint readers in the display FaceID will stay and it will be optional to have it scan your face and a finger to be place on the screen at the same time for even greater security. What do you think?
Iphone is the best \n1. Much faster \n2. The best camera  \n3. Better hardware and software integration \n4. iOS updates when you want them \n6. The best apps first \n7. No bloatware\n8. Works beautifully with macs \n9. Apple pay \n10. Family sharing \n11. Best support and help\n12 . iMessage

*Looks at guy watching movie on iPhone X*\n\nHey, um, dude, you're, um...you're MISSING PART OF THE SCREEN!
Reachability is possible with Assistive touch on iOS, so there's your home button to use it. Also getting quick access to control center and the new lock screen (notifications) and you can set it up with the quick access YOU want/need + since they now made Double tap, and long press settings possible on it with latest iOS 11 update beside it has 3D Touch on it also, it should be the same on the iPhone X. So one hand use should not be a problem, because Assistive touch is like a home button. Make it your own! 👈😎
Well time to by the Iphone 3
at first i was like why is he saying porsche like that but now i realize i've been saying it wrong the whole time lol
MOST likely skipped the gold because it's a stainless steel body instead of aluminum.
Iphone X-pensive!
MKBHD PUBG with PEWDIEPIE ... imagine damn
Why are you not using a over on your iPhone 8 Plus? 😱
wait, how do you pronounce Porsche again?
I don't thin the sensor works in low light meaning you will spend half the day using your password to get in your phone...

Respected sir I like your video and your expression in that video really sir but I use someone's phone not my own because of my poverty and my unwillingness I don't have my own smartphone but I I am your big fan and domain as your big fan always and I always wish you grow more and more and prayer to God you grow more and more thank you sir.
love your videos. But hoping you can put the English subtitles into the video. That can make easy for me to easy understand clearly what you said. This is because i still bad in English but also i want to see every video you make. Thanks
Give me some tips to start a tech channel!!
Not a big fan of the facial recognition stuff so far. My friend has the Note 8 and I just grab it, point it at her face, it unlocks, and I run away with her phone. Is this what better security is?
Could you please make a video on Fuscia OS. Could it replace Android.
What do you think will be the next body part you use to unlock your phone?

Hmmm buy a 50 4k TV and a Galaxy S7 or buy an IPhone X🤔🤔🤔
One single iPhone X that will crack in a few weeks you use it $999\n200 long-lasting copies of The Bee Movie for about $999\nMake smart choices people..
Back to an Apple watch?
I saw the tweet of you converting the F to C and seeing it here for myself,  yas Marques yas <3
I don't care what anyone wants to say, but I always call it the iPhone X. 🍎😤😤😤🍎
apple the brand for people who live an illusion and think their human while their SHEEP BeeeeeeeeEeeeeEeeEe
your voice is so soothing and smooth damn
the gpu behind you is ....
Or go buy a chinesse phone, phones which got really good lately, for a fraction of the price, get all the features you actually need, and tell these corporations to eat your fatty.

Can someone explain what happened to the iPhone 9?
i'm legit happy for your success man. been watching for a while now. keep up the amazing work!
Should I get the 9 inch or the 12 inch dildo??????
Is it worth buying the iPhone se in 2017. And if Apple will bring the A11 chip in the se, then I guess it would be worth buying. Please guide. I don't have much to invest
I don't care who corrects me. Saying iPhone x sounds better than saying iPhone 10.
Heyyy Marques , Which is ur  all time # Favorite # phone..
first time watching.  This has to be the most HD video I have ever seen on YT.  lol
No shameless D Brand plug for this video Brownlee?
Bro play store is not working/opening at all can you solve this please let me know ASAP
Why not a live Q&A?
lmao came here for the video title and he answered it right in the beginning . well looks like im done now so see you guys !
Do u think iPhone X can survive atleast half day with such a powerful display and 2167 mAh battery power.
Ellen said X instead of ten
Why are all of your videos so *Lit AF*
I love how ginourmous phones seem normal sized in your hands but feel every video should include you handling something smaller, that people recognize. I miss my S3.
Is it me or is the video and sound a bit off sync? Especially for the lipsyn part.  Hmm anyway, great video once more
Why you are not reviewing iPhone 8 only 8 is it not worth buying or reviewing. Not Plus not X only 8
People actually care about electric cars??
Hey do you think the price on the iPhone x is too much because if you think that I’ll change your mind
Dear criminals! Do not use IPhone X and you know why.
MKBHD know of anyone working on utilizing NFC tech for wearables so one can for example, have credit/debit cards, train passes, ID, etc in a smartwatch?
One of the best series in tech utubers
How iphone X face id would work in totally dark room?

Still waiting on the X vs 8...
Can a fingerprint scanner work with a toe print?
Great video man. Been watching for years. You've helped me a lot.

Why don't they embed the touch id in the apple logo

I would love to see you experiment with purple and deep navy blue!!
I love you Carli😍 I always love the way you do make up😊
Hey Carli my Favourite Acne spot treatment is from Dermalogica ! It's their over night clearing Gel and there Sebum Masque! The over night clearing gel really helps to try and prevent bacteria from spreading and calming the pimple down ! If I feel like my pimple is being stubborn I'll take my dermalogica sebum masque and leave it on the spot overnight and that usually dries it's and flatens the pimple especially if I squeezed it the day before and damaged the skin I find this helps a lot. Both of these products shouldn't burn your skin dermalogica is amazing but gentle! Give it a go and see if that helps. Love this look Btw so beautiful.
I think its dumb that people are like Just do a nose-job Keep calm and Contour on!
My go to skin care is Paula's Choice. She has a wonderful acne cream and a BHA acid that is great at preventing blackheads 
omg your eyes are so big and pretty!!!!
Try homemade vegan black charcoal for your acne. It's all natural and detoxifies your pores!
Omg im in loveee with this looks and the eye looks was my most fav one.. 😍😍😍😘
Great video Carli!!  I have learned so much from you about beauty over the past three years!  Keep up the great work!
love you energy in this video. you seem so happy
Carli what brush did you use to apply powder to set your concealer?? You are so beautiful 😩😍
Where do people wear lashes like that when it’s not for a video?
I would love to see you do a hot pink look
I thought Huda beauty wasn't considered cruelty free because they have mink lashes?
You're so beautiful☺✨
>\nI know I'm late but an orange/cranberry look with your holy grails!!
You look so pretty!! That color is definitely your color ❤️
for the next colorful eye can you please do a yellow one!!
She looks like a Kardashian but, she's more beautiful. I love you Carli 😙😙😙😙
Witch hazel is the best toner and acne treatment I have ever used! It's all natural too!!
get tea tree oil as a spot treatment!!
Rodan and Fields is what I use Unblemish,  I love it... and it's cruelty free!
Oh my, Carli! Always and forever my fave makeup artist!!
Do purple please! ❤️
Beautifulllllllll 💙😩😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Welcome back gorgeous 💙💙💙
Dr Murad blemish spot treatment
Lol
hi miss bybel
doooo purple ????
do the clarifying mask by murad. I love it!
I think it is time you did a closet tour! 😁
Missed u soo much...😍😘😘😇😇😇welcome back..
I cannot wait for your new clothing range!!! x
Your skin looks so beautiful in this video! 😍😍
Tea tree oil as a spot treatment, and Kypris Clearing Serum every night. My skin has changed.
A great acne product is coconut oil!
I use stridex pads for my pimples , it's gentle on your skin but tough on acne. It's inexpensive and does wonders , it removed the dirt ,oils,and bacteria that cause pimple .
Nothing goes to waste at the slaughterhouse.
For acne and skincare, I highly recommend Differin. You can get it at most drugstores and Amazon. I have very oily acne prone skin and it is the only thing that has helped me. I've gone to dermatologists and the products are like holy grail.
there is nothing wrong with your nose. your nose is perfect. there is no need to contour it
I'm interested in getting juvaderm! Is there a reason why you got them removed? I dont mean to be rude i just trust your opinion and feed back. Xoxox fron texas
Can always watch her videos they r amazing and she is so pretty
Do a Wonder Woman makeup tutorial and can u do a look with the Natasha denona palette
Holy cow after wiping the setting powder your skin was flawless!!!
i'd love to see a cranberry/ deep red/ dark magenta look using a palette like Modern Renaissance! :) love you!!
You are always so elegant love 😍.  Always love your tutorials ♥️♥️
Do a bright purple or cranberry look!
You are so naturally beautiful 😍 I've always loved your makeup tutorials xoxo
I'd love to see a rich pink and gold look, or a beautiful bold red!! Or even a navy blue metallic 😁
For breakouts try the Bahi Cosmetics Sunflower Sweets Serum!! It’s super moisturizing and great for sensitive skin. As someone who struggles with cystic acne, I can not recommend it enough!!! It’s gentle but super effective
Can you recommend some eyeshadow brushes for a first timer? Like what would they NEED in a set for various looks?
Ugh I love how you do you're makeup :)!
Carli can you please do a beauty room/closet tour soon????????
i  think you should do purple eyeshadow look
U discontinued using the tatcha one Carli because u were breaking out. I remember.
i love this look !!!!!!!!
IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF YOU COULD DO A SUNSET EYE<3 !!!
Hey Carli can you do some weeding things... My sister is getting married in january and we just have no idea on what to do!! BTW love you and your videos... You're awesome girl keep doing it😘😘
Hey Carli, maybe some dark berry tones for autumn ... lysm and your videos 😍❤
its always so refreshing to come and watch Carli's videos she's so down to earth I love her !
believe me you're the only one who gonna make me buy the subculture palette and i have never thought that i'm gonna like the green colour but girl you made it <3 love you
absolutely love you been watching you for 4 years such an inspiration ty for all you do xoxo big hugs 😘😘😘
Am I the only one wondering about her perfume?
Your eyebrows are soo pretty😩😍😍 love you❤️
Where do you get your nails done!!
I really wish she would work with a brand that caters more pieces to plus sized women. Her last collection went up to a size 12, which isn't even the average woman's size in America. I would love to support her, but how can I if theres no pieces catered to my size?
How about red or burgundy eyeshadow?
I tried the UFO oil by Sunday Riley and I loved it since  it was an oil it didn't dry  my skin out!
Does anyone else think Carli and Brett broke up? I can totally see a shift in mood in previous videos, if you see this Carli, I really feel for you. Losing someone you love sucks
Aaaand back to heavy drag queen make up 👎👎👎👎
Haven't seen the bf in a while...what's happening?
Oh yeah! Because it's so popular , they never stop and tell people that the Tatcha Dewy Mist has 20 different botanical oils in it. It's all part of moisture for dryness. We played with it at work and I like it , but i'm oily. It's for if your make up is all done and you want the look of a highlight and a DEWY finish ! lol learned looking like a needed 5 packs of oil blotting sheets!! it's lovely on bare skin though! I looove Tatcha Enzyme Rice!!
why is she wearing two blouses at the same time? i see the green blouse under
I still feel that the subculture pallete is patchy 🤷🏾‍♀️
So gorgeous!!! You're the only person I trust when you talk about products you love/ don't love. You've helped me so much with not wasting my time on products that don't work!!! Xox
Had I tried doing this makeup look, I would have failed... miserably. She makes it look so easy lol 😭
Ugh I wish u were dropping the clothing line sooner! My birthday is coming up oct. 15th and I know I'll want something to wear from the line:((
Omg I thought I was the only person on the planet that HATES the Tatcha spray!!! It makes me look like a bucket of grease and I don't even have oily skin at all
Can you do more looks with your pallete please
Can you do a burgundy color?
This makeup looks really nice and for some reason makes you look a bit older. Can you do a super sensitive skin care routine?
Two ships passing in the night
Clean and clear persagel dries up my acne over night! It’s awesome
I just bought your palette from Ulta! I was so excited to see it there! Can you please make videos specifically using your palette only? I normally never wear eyeshadow. So I'm trying something new and would love to see more looks with your palette. :) Thank you and love your videos! They inspre me to try new looks and play around with make-up more. haha

they should download drivers first and put them on a thumb drive so they can install them easily
There's no question about it, consciousness comes from the brain. Don't insert pseudoscience into this.
A very informative video about a very bad idea.
This is just in time for Halloween season.
I have a prediction,  by the end of this operation there will be two dead people.
The real question is. when the patient survives. will his offspring be his body's or his owns? :O
When exactly is the operation scheduled?
Why... why why why why whyyyyyy wouldn’t they practice by putting accidentally severed heads back on their own bodies before doing this?
Which is the body where it will be transplanted his name???
This type of stuff sounds like what my biology teacher would do.
Soap opras  have been doing it for years hahaha
bbc earth labs i would love to know how you get your info
X Files did it first.
This is going to go horribly wrong...
The patients body isn't dying.  He has a horrible way of life because he has some disease that his body doesn't work right so no walking and his arms don't work well.  I guess he's got to a point that he's ready to die if he doesn't get s good body.  I'm curious if the procedure half works like he can't move like a quadriplegic the patient was ready to day because his body was so bad but at least he could move a little.  Are they going to allow him to do an assisted suicide if he wants since he will be worse off.
The healthy brain, if the surgery is successful, will still need to relearn how to control a body, given the fact that the person has been paralyzed all his life. So, even if everything goes fine, he will need tons of physical and neurological rehabilitation.
wouldn't it be quite a surprise if the transplant was successful but the guy claims to be and acts like the guy who went brain dead.
PEG was used as a carrier fluid for electronic cigarette fluid early on, it wasn’t very popular due to its taste.
During kidney transplant the faulty kidney is not removed thus thw patient has 3 kidneys...
It’s alive! ALIVE!!!!!!!!!
The fact this sotry actually turned out to be true and not some elaborate marketing for Metal Gear Solid V blows my mind honestly...
Is this a Jojo reference?
How are we meant to know if it works without trying?
I'm just gonna wait until they create prostethic bodies Ghost in the Shell style, thanks.
I believe there will be one big fail :/
I will pray to my God to make this procedure fail and for the doctors involved to burn forever in their own personal Hell.
Lucky for me I don't need transplants. But I hope to have robot body when I'm very old and live forever YEAH!
Is it possible to transplant a head of a girl to a head of a man or vice versa?
I have a feeling that some people with high power within the medical industry would undermine this.
I really hope the surgeons play Eminems 'Lose Yourself' during the operation.\n😆
its technically.. a body transplant
This will be an amazing experiment - even if it fails. If it works - we gain a major insight into the connection between the body and the brain in addition to getting a step closer to having a synthetically grown body replacement for spinal cord injuries, lost limbs and various other conditions potentially including death! Or, if it turns out growing a body is too hard or expensive, we can just wire the head into a robotic body able to keep the head alive until a replacement body can be safely grown.\n\nThere is a first time for everything. This body transplant was bound to happen sooner or later. Even a failure here will push us towards the first success. This will be a great leap in medical science one way or the other.
just thinking about it makes me cringe
Guys, don't get ahead of our selves. ;)
What if its the head's last hope of surviving and the body donor is already clinically dead?  why does the video only explores the controversial side but at least no a single different approach
Is this some sort of European April Fool's day that I'm not aware of?
Lots of your facts are incorrect. Do you fact check at all?
Not for me thanks, but I am a registered diner.
In the name of SCIENCE!!
I imagine we'll have better luck in the future if we manage to make trainable wetware interfaces - you'd grow a network of connections into the base of the patient's brain, then attach a signal processor. Do the same to the top of the spine of the donor body. Train computers to interpret each body's signalling, then connect the computers. This way, you could correct for differences between the two nervous systems with software. Much more precise than just hoping for the best in case nerve behavior doesn't match up between bodies.\n\nOf course, we'd need to figure out how to grow those artificial nerve taps first, and then how to probe the connections without causing brain damage
The dog head being kept alive is probably the most disturbing thing I have ever seen.
It would help if ur a dullahan
Oh, idk maybe you should do this successfully on an animal first.... All those dogs and monkeys died minutes later.
You are transplanting a body, not the head!
sounds weird but I would choose to change my body with one from the other gender. I don't think this will make it harder? Or take the body of a chimpanzee!
I understand how exciting it is from a scientific technical viewpoint.... and do we really need that? Who is important enough  to revive this $$$ endeavour. It would be interesting to see what this would be fotr the new combined human.. there are memories by the body beside the brain... and for example the gut brain connection... i would rather have us figure out how we can make life  good for us and all living beings on this planet first... solving urging now problems... but humans curiosity of its ability to figure out nature seems non unstoppable
Do NOT search the video of the bodyless dog. Don't do it. Just Don't.
There are thousands of nerves in the spinal chord, are they going to just glue them all together as a clump or are they going to try and connect each nerve individually and how would they know which individual nerve is which? If they glue it as a single clump, how will the nerves know what to do? it's not like the nerves themselves can seek out and find the correct corresponding nerve to connect to. If they try to do it individually, the time it would take would probably leave the brain with irreparable damage. Morality aside, this is a fascinating and exciting prospect for medical science, although I doubt very much that there is any chance of success. Respect to the person volunteering to have their head transplanted though, even if I was a quadriplegic and dying, I wouldn't be brave enough to volunteer for this operation.
there's no way it's going to be successful
What's the moral questions about, if the donor wants to donate his life to science?
I've been reading about this for a while. I'm soo curious of the outcome.
Will the person have 2 different dna s. Or will the head adapt to the body or is it the other way around?
I'm hoping such a procedure does occur, and even more so for it to be successful.
If I was terminally ill I would definitely take the procedure, even on the experimental stage. I would also consider it if I was immobilized by an accident or a disease (if it was already perfected).\n\nIf they manage to do the thing safely, I suppose this will be a gateway for ~rich~ people who would like to gender swap with fully functioning organs
sound just like instructions on how to put a phone back together
How many spinal nerve 'glue joints' will there be?
i have heard of the news where sergio gonna do it and i cant believe that a month later i think, we are gonna see the first head/body transplant
Just transplant the guys balls there problem solved (if we can do that)
So, the important question, will this be televised if it goes ahead (sorry, had to)\n\nI mean i'm not a medical expert but i would be curious to see it happen, something that has never been done before
Not so bold prediction: the procedure will fail
...just asking for a friend
Well this surgery will most definitely be a huge failure.
I feel empathetic for the person that is so desperate to be the head to be transplanted. At least you get to fade out in a medically induced sleep knowing you will probably never wake up. The person that is willing to do this is obviously doomed to an inevitable end and the person that is brain dead is in much the same situation. Neither person has much to lose here. Also this is probably going to be someone younger and capable of handling the stress and potential recovery. There's really no reason to make this political. If the doctors are willing to try it, more power to them. Think about this as if it is you facing eminent death, early in life, and you might have a chance to live longer.
Poor donor. Gotta live the rest of his days without a body.
if i was disabled or some other life threatening issue. then yes i would have it done.
Drain the head of blood, seems like a problem recovering from that alone.
skip tp 3:00 if you are not a moron.
Wonder how messed up the persons life/body currently is, who is getting the new body transplant, with quite a big of a risk that it might fail.
Wasn’t this just a publicity stunt for metal gear solid 5?????
i think you missed probably one of the biggest questions: where is the donor body coming from?!
Maybe this is body transplant
Just thinking about this is giving me the shakes, I do not like this at all 😵😳🤦
Wait..whose _body_ are they taking it from? That guy consented?!
Does he get to keep both passports? Portrait from one and fingerprints from the other.
I cut the nerve bundle in my index finger. The surgeon stitched it back together, but after 20 years I still have poorly localized feeling in that finger because the nerves are all cross wired and shorted together. Imagine a whole spine...
imagine the possibilities if this works
That's so freaky when you think about it.
IMMORTALITY HERE I COME
Fish head curry anyone?
Mengele would be proud!
DOUBT
Dope.
Erw
MGS STUN
You get a like for the holding back of the pun.\n\nBut it was a good one! \n\nHave a nice weekend, Greg. Don't get ahead of yourself. :D
Is this video directed at children? because wow this is said so childlike
Wait so whats stopping thr donor body from being drained of its blood when the original head is decapitated from it? \nSurely the exposed boood vessels will result in the heart pumping the blood out of the neck.... Its not like they can cauterise the wounds since they need the blood vessels to be intact
if the body  gets injured, lets say a cut, would his brain be able to communicate with his body to heal the wound if the dna wouldn't be the same?
Just to clarify, doctors do not remove the failed kidneys of the transplant recipient unless the patient is too small to carry 3 kidneys (like children) or they have a disease called Polycystic Kidney disease or PKD, which covers your kidneys with cysts and enlarges them to the size of a football. I had a kidney transplant a year and a half ago and I have 3 kidneys, my two diseased kidneys still sit in their natural position and the transplanted kidney in the front, right above the bladder.
Thats a real headscratcher... ok ill see myself out now :P
Can we stop calling it head transplant and inventing silly excuses for why we do so, and instead be adults and call it body transplant?
I just want a cybernetic body...
when we shake a pen or pencil it seems like a wave.why?
A question that’s prob been asked a hundred times but what are the little numbers that pop up throughout the video? What do they mean? \n\nThanks
I dont know if this aught to be done
polyethylene glycol is a laxative...
What if is successful, then i can transplant my head to a young teenager body to live longer.
The real question is, who the heck volunteered to be a body donor...
I am not a doctor but, how are they planing that the brain will survive minutes without blood? I thought that is pretty much the definition of being dead.
how can the donor body be revived if it's dead?
Love the intro hello everyone i'm in a field 😂😂 YAY BANDS BACK TOGETHER\n\np.s. check out my channel if you wish x
YouTube boy band please

I'm fairly sure the campervan in HTR wasn't left hand drive. It also had the newer style white/yellow registration whereas this one had the pre-1973 style black back with white print. \n\nCool vlog.

3rd comment
Does this mean Marcus is finally being normal again?? (I unwatched him after the break up and acting like a shit.) :/
IS TOM DALEY THE ONE AT 5.01?????
I don't get how Jim acts like he and Louise are awesome friends when him and Tanya didn't invite her to their wedding but htey invited Hannah Hart. Jim did a radio show with Louise so you think that they would be better friends than Hannah.
Has anyone else noticed that naomi has just disappeared from the group
Your makeup looks beautiful today ..
Hey Laura! I was wondering if you could show more crockpot recipes. I use to love to cook but unfortunately I'm now suffering from a chronic illness and I be in a lot of pain. So standing and stirring for long periods are hard. But I love your channel! I've been watching for years and I have your cookbook😂.
First pumpkin spice drink of the season watched on YouTube, done 🍁🍁🍁🍂🍂🍂🍵🍵✔️✔️😋😋!!  Gracias querida Laura!
Am I the only one who doesn't cook but yet I still love watching her 😩💗
Yes!!!!!! Thanks Laura!
@Laurainthekitchen where did you buy these mugs
Sounds about white to me
is there any thing then  Pumpkin you can use I have a  allergy to Pumpkin
They don't sell pumpkin purée in England tho 😭😭❤️
Dem eyez of laura’s are🤦🏿‍♂️❤️❤️
I can no longer resist the pizza. I open the box and unzip my pants, allowing my pulsating member to eagerly burst free. As I penetrate the steaming, gooey cheese, a shuddering moan of ecstasy breaks through my drooling lips. The mushrooms and Italian sausage are delightfully rough, and the warm sauce feels like heaven. I blow my load in mere seconds, just in time to slip out the front door as you step out of the bathroom. You never discover why that pizza tasted so much better than all the others.
Ofcourse i will make this! Yummmmmy:) thank you Laura!!!
Every white girl's dream. You have done it again Laura.👌🏼🙌🏼
Sounds delicious.  I have pumpkin pie torani so I might use it.
Omg your so nice and sweet and your foods/drinks look AMAZING
Girl your makeup. Give us sources or techniques. So hot
Definitely looks yummy and just in time for the cool nights we’re starting to have,  a recipe that I’m going to try tfs and just a side note you look beautiful in this video love the makeup 😊💕
Hi i guys I am Laura Vitale andonthisepisodeoflaurainthekitchen LOVE IT!!!
Can you please do a regular easy homemade hot chocolate recipe?
If it's too sweet, add just a touch of sea salt to it.
White chocolate is a misnomer.  There is no chocolate in that white goop
Will try this to my girl's night get together next week 😋
Looks so good!! I can't wait to make this
thank you for giving us a real recipe. I've looked at several beverage recipe so far and they included ingredients like instant coffee and other processed ingredients. thank you for being real
Liked even before watching it cuz whatever it is, it's gonna be AMAZING
I would love to try that😍
Can you make a bacon ice cream? It is hot after all xD
IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR\n\nPUMPKIN SPICE SEASON!
3:29 thats what she said
Nice!
Can you make Oreo eclairs
this looks amazing
gibby dat
💞Your eye makeup is poppin! 💞
please please please make a frappuccino
Yummy.
DAMN woman! You look good
People who make fun of people who like pumpkin anything this time of year are jerks stop shamming people for what they like
I've been ordering this at Starbucks for years!!!!! Yummmmm! Now I can make my own!
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!
It’s hot out here too in California! Maybe pouring it over ice! Sounds delish to me!
Definitely need to make this because every time I order it at Tim Hortons they give me black coffee :/
Laura I have something you need to try. Egg nog hazelnut cappuccino. It's amazing. I was craving a cappuccino and noticed I didn't have milk. So I added some egg nog and it was amazing!! Someone probably already done it but I love it haha. Mm with whip cream on top and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
This looks so good
This looks great! Makeup is gorgeous
This looks incredible 😍 love love love your make up in this video too - wish you still filmed make up tutorials and make up videos xx
Could this be made with lower fat milk and still be good?
Thank you, thank you, thank YOU for this! I can't wait to try it!
Laura, on behalf of all ladies PLEASE resume your makeup/lifestyle channel again and show us how you created your eye look, it looks unreal!!! I know you are still a new mom and you have commitments but I would love you even more if you could show up occasionally for a good girls chat! Love you
That looks soooo delicious😋😋\nAnd your make up looks amazing 😍\nPlease show us this beautiful make up look in a tutorial 😍
I’ll make it with one espresso shot 😍
I cant wait to try this with my fam
Laura , this looks wonderful and you look absolutely beautiful . My wife did the same after our first daughter and everyone thereafter .... we (my wife and I) wish you were our granddaughter
WOW i just made this.........it is SOOOO AWESOME!!!   the 2nd cup i have I'm going to add bit of nutmeg to the top    YUM YUM!!!!
I love pumpkin pie! However, most of the things to come from the pumpkin pie spice craze don't have any actual pumpkin. That kinda diminishes the experience for me. I'm so glad to see that yours has pumpkin in it! :)
Yeeeeesssssss! I've been dying for a PSL for years, but have been avoiding caffeine due to past and current pregnancy. Now this preggo can enjoy a holiday drink and make it whenever I want!
Just wandering...\nIF its hot outside AND we really need to try this, can't we refrigerate it for couple of hours and enjoy as a cold drink... 🤗
You just meshed my two favorite drinks together. God bless your soul!  I have to try this.
This looks so good! 😍 I live in Texas and it's still in the high 80's here - can't wait until it gets cold so I can make this for my family and I!
I can’t wait to make this around Christmas time during the cold nights.
Yes!!! It's fall!!!!🍁🍂🍁🍂
What type of alcohol would be good with it?
Looks lush burn in not too sure off the flavour with pumpkin as we don't use it for desserts in England
Thank you Laura! I need to try this ASAP!
Can someone bring me this Hot drink to my bed NOW!😂😂
I saw 1 of your videos and subscribed instantly + notifications
I have already made your pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. I plan on making the cream cheese pumpkin muffins. Now I'm gonna have to make this hot chocolate..  Once the weather cools. Too hot
What is body language👍👍
This would be perfect for me right now because I have a sinus infection. This drink would definitely cure my sickness as well as my needs for sweet fall flavors 💜💜😂
I SAW U ON CHOPPED AND I WAS FREAKING OUTTT
Seems amazing! I just can't find canned pumpkin puree in dutch supermarkets and I don't want to buy a whole pumpkin lol
good morning my name is meek
Love all ur recipes,ur so beautiful n so r ur dishes!!! :* lots of love..I'm valiya from India
I love your videos God bless your family
That looks delicious and Laura, you look especially beautiful.😊
Can't wait for the weather to get a tiny cooler! Here in Texas still like 110°F 😂😭
“It’s hot and I don’t appreciate it” SAME LAURA SAME
Can't get any whiter than this
I have got to make this for my autumn family gatherings🌿🍁😋Looks so good!
Laura, I'm jealous of Mia, she's going to have the best food growing up 😆
I've never seen before a beverage like this, I think is genial and amazing! Thanks for sharing Laura!
Can I substitute whole milk with almond milk?
Looks so good!!
Yummy!
How is this TRENDING
Yummm
You always cheer me up. Thanks, Czechia Praha.

Wtf is your problem with the witnesses?
Can't wait!Love you Katy!
No I won't
I love Taylor Swift and katy Perry 😍🎼moreover a swiftie😍
I'm a new katycat because of witness
Love you Mom,  Katy cats will support you always❤
Katy I have a bad immune system and I was supposed to see you on October 11th but I can’t cause I can get really sick. And I’m really upset. I saw you for your Prismatic World Tour and now I can probably not see you in concert. I have an auto immune disease that I’m always at doctors and I don’t have a normal life. I’m 14 and most of my life I’ve been sick or at doctors. And getting blood taking and getting infusions and shots every week. And I’m struggling to stay caught up in school and keep friends and deal with my auto immune disease that me and my brother and Mom have. Every time I’m upset I listen to your music cause it makes me happy and forget what I’m going through. And because I’m a DJ I always play your music. And I have trouble talking to people about what I go through and when I listen to your music when I’m upset or happy or at doctors or getting my infusions or just at a random time it always makes me happy. You are my role model and my favorite person in the whole world. I know you probably won’t see this but I hope you do and respond cause it would mean a lot to me. Thank you
Her career ended so early so bad
she said my name during the live :((((((((
I dont understand why she's puting this out at the same time as Gaga's Documentary
Should i have to mention that in the album there's 3 katy, and then, if you will count her eyes, it will be 6, and 3 katys × 6 eyes = 666??!!\nYOU SHOULD WAKE UP
This is what you called evolution of a star.
IM SO EXCITED 😭😭❤️❤️ I remember the livestream, when it ended , I WAS SO SAD !!!
Just wanna see you with Taylor be close again because fans are full of hatred they always comparing you for nothing they are the one makes you two worst. Btw i'm swifties and at the same time im also a katy cats
Hepl me please , enter and like\n https://youtu.be/cDe56LORm6Y
Saw her in Boston last night, She was a goddess for sure
Nah Taylor swift concert is much better 😍😏🐸\nKaty can't dance while singing hahahaha n her voice oh my God it's really awful 😑 admit it katy fans  haha😏
please someone answer  me it's very important. It's just on YouTube red or I can watch it on normal YouTube too?
What I really want to witness is..your imminent death Ms. Perry, you're a very disgusting, crack woman that you are. You need to be stopped from spreading abominations in this world!
Katy Perry: Will You Be My Witness? - Official Trailer\nhttps://youtu.be/Kz-3PgnD1vM

Katy I'm so excited to go to ur concert
Wait...........It comes out on October 4th?! That's Ali Brustofski's birthday! It's pretty interesting because that cover singer is a huge fan of Katy Perry! 😍💕❤️
This is what happens when Taylor ends your career lmao
I am from Russia and I very love you!
OMG A YOUTUBE RED MOVIE! <3 but the money T^T
Finally people will realise that she didn't go insane or turned into Miley Cyrus. She was and still is a normal person, her hair didn't take her sanity away neither her voice.
GARBAGE
I cant wait for that😀
It doesn't matter what u think of Katy or her music, what's important is that she's happy and in a better place now 💖💖💖
What's the song on the end? Plzz
I don't want to look like Katy Perry anymore\nThat broke my heart\nBut if she's a human being and she deserves everything she believes. I love you, dont care what critics say I will  buy your CDs even in 2070

Another potential winner by the voters..
I just was thinking a few weeks ago they should go on this or Americas got tallent I'm so happy and Dave and Clair need to go on Americas got tallent
What a voice. Precious daughter. Beautiful family. Love how the Voice celebrates real people and their dreams. Hat's off to management.
Dave Crosby: I Will Follow You into the Dark
I AM IN TEARS
Finally !!!!!! good luck dave !!!  :DDDDDDDD
Now he should sing a David Crosby's song to close the circle :)
Hey I hate to be that guy but his dang singing made me cry because this song makes me think of exr\nAlso from his amazing voice\nBut primarily exr
that little angel is a future artist way to go.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Why??? Why is Miley there? She is so bad!
What is the name of the song at 6:27?
Whats The Song Called @ 6:28
*LOVE YOU Claire and the Crosbys*
Claire is delightful but Dave....what a wonderful voice and such honestly.  It was beautiful!  Go, go, go!
Check out me and my bro.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9YDQyKzEPA
The Voice would’t be the same without Adam and Blake
Who's here from Claire and the Crosbys? 😂
nice . love of mine... i will follow u into the dark
His daughter will be a diva. You guys have my word and check this comment 10 years later.
sounds like nevershoutnever
So adorable!!! Hope he wins.
I cried
Omg! Sooooo excited that Dave Crosby is going to be on The Voice!! Love the Crosby Family!! Claire is such a sweetheart! Omg!!!! So excited!!
props to jennifer for that question, or else we wouldn't be able to hear claire sing (moms account )
j hudson is a stuck up boring coach
Carson gets so excited for everyone getting a chair turned around. It deflates and waters down the excitement.
OMG I just realised she is Miley Cyrus
Is this The Voice ?\nHe's whispering ! 😱
Death Cab For Cutie's Ben is repping my city how crazy!
Ugh I'm so happy for this!! I missed out on his audition on Tv D:
And miley is the queen any way😍😍
Great voice control but it's kinda weak. Idk maybe he was saving it for that song, I just hope he has more
His daughter's reaction is priceless :)
I'm so obsessed! He's amazing
this lil love is the sweetest and purest soul i ever heard so far! OMG!
the whole family is so cute omg
He has a beautiful voice he has  fans already around the world he has a chance to win
At 1:44 Jennifer Hudson be like: Darn he's cute!
You've got a FAN in me!\n\n#Goosebumps!
I am so happy he chose Adam. Adam chose Dave first even before knowing that he is a famous YouTuber!
THEY COPIED THE VOICE PHILIPPINES!
OMG! I love this kind of music and his voice. By the way their moana cover was uber cute. ❤
Isn’t that the little girl from the care.com commercial? 😂
Congrats, Dave so happy you are going for your dreams too!
His daughter should help her father to decide who he gonna pick
Countinho
wow dave congratssss my idol and ur cutiiieeee pie baby

Every time I see this family on video singing or just being who they are in their vlogs, I tear up. They are such a really sweet family. Ever since I saw the video of them singing see the light from the Tangled movie, I fell in love with them. Dad has an AMAZING voice and Clair does as well. And what a little cutie. Love this family'
Ahhhh....  yesssss...  I'm crying happy tears for Dave.  I've been following their channel since I first saw Claire sing the song from the Little Mermaid.  Their family always brightens my day!  Congrats Dave!  <3
The winner.. I hope!! :D
You take good care of the Crosbys!
I always love J Hudson’s reactions.
that song and this is cute and she is good
What I always say is If u lose The Voice, then u can try for X Factor and Agt, Bgt and etc.
Why are successful vocalists always attractive? Can unattractive vocalists have a long, lasting career in the music business?
If he gets to live playoffs where America votes then he automatically wins.  He is already so popular and has won the hearts of millions.  All Adam has to do if he wants to win this is not mess up and not make the wrong choice (like he has so many times in the past...).
Yes! Go Claire and the Crosbys . Awesome. Congrat. Hello from Washington State
What a boring and cheesy song.
Why is Miley still judge? Is she mentally stable now?
so is this guy gonna win the voice cause of his daughter?
Dave, is going on the voice going to interfere with you going to the planet Kolob, where god lives????
dave's voice is good❤️
I watched this in music class
For so long says Miley.
Thank you for  subtitles...
Hope Dave wins
Woah!! Perfection.
YAAAAS A MORMON!
MY FAMILY 👏👏👏
folk❤️
Claire got their attention
I was thinking of 'Hey hey, it's Ty Ty' then I realized this is a different show. And that little girl is amazing! God bless this family! 😘
Omggg GO DADDEH
Yeayyy, team Adam!! :) ;)
I LOVE THERE CHANEL
I’m cryin
Love you claire 😍😍😍
God bless the Crosbys!! Beautiful family!! 😍😍😍
The Crosbys!!!!
Soooo cute!
Anybody from Seattle Wa here?🙋🏻
3:40 , Jennifer ruined the moment! no offence!
YEAH!!!! DAVE YOURE AN AMAZING SINGER AND FATHER
CONGRATS AND BEST OF LUCK DAVE!!! so happy for you and your beautiful family ❤️😍
Sue me but I don't have any idea that the Voice is up again if not of their vlog. they are so awesome!
So happy for all of you!
That's so cute I'm crying 😭😭💕
Soo happy for you & your family. Your such a blessing to me 💕
OMG I recognize them now! Claire and the Crosbys! That's incredible!
Brilliant x
😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚
That is awesome!
OMFG CLAIRE AND THE CROSBYS!! Dave totally deserved those 3 chairs. So proud! ❤️
Meh, crap
enzo is one hell of a seller holy sh-
3:07 I think he dead
Stop stop stop. I'm so dizzy, I can't see nothing
Am I the only one that noticed that Braun ripped his shirt off for the first time
Gulak might have stolen the show on this one.
Can anyone else hear enzo saying stop it at 2:26
Didnt have to put in the fake cheers guys
Braun is the senior😅😅
All u want to Kill him...
Hey Enzo. How you doin?
Enzo deserved it ...... but that was too much!
Les not act like they didn't use v trigger and young bucks super kick
Braun and Zo are friends in real life tho.
Look at the face of enzo on 3:08
Who are the heels and faces here
This was a terrible segment and I'm not even a Enzo fan. Why put the belt on him just to look weak ?
big cass must be laughing his A off from that hospital bed
Good
Jack Gallagher looks like he is on the verge of turning heel
0:45 - did... did his rib cage just cave in?
Stop he's already dead.
Enzo = 💩
The way Cedric Alexander slammed enzo I thought he broke his neck
This has no commentators, so am i right in thinking this was just for the crowd and not on Raw itself?
I like how the ring sounds
This is what happens when you bad mouth Cena Enzo.... Golden Shovel.
Hey dude if i give you the money can you go pick up the new Fallout game for me?\n\n\nYeah sure\n\nSorry dude i used the money to get drunk with my friends and i trashed you're car 3:08
Man  that  got  to  be  criminal offense
Make the cruiserweights a dominant faction with Braun Strowman and Neville as their leader
stop. stop! he's already dead.
I hate that Enzo is champion! He deserved that beating! Best 205 Live segment ever!
That punkass deserves it!
if I was enzo I will fight back just be friends with enzo fine if you guys don't lisen to me when I'm big I'm gonna kick all of and put your teeth down your throts you guys are mean people because you don't respect enzo amore
And yet, everybody still thinks Big Cass was being a douche. He was just the first to think little enzo speaks too much and it won't be the last time. The only guy to have a worst timing than enzo was when Bo Dallas came to the ring to tell Brock Lesnar to Bolieve after the big guy lost a match (against Taker I think)
it would be cool if all the (non Enzo) cruiserweights did something similar to the nexus, but not just on 205 live to enzo, to bigger guys too!
I think his punishment for being a douche is over now.
3:16 Is that all you can do?
that was really sweat
why this happened to enzo??
Every single cruiserweight will always be a face to me after this because they looked like they were all getting along and they got the crowd involved attacked Enzo
Let me throw some punches and kicks in too 👊👊👊👊
There was nothing fake about that knee @ 3:00
He could running powerslam all of the at the same time if he wanted to
Hey!!!!!! Why whit Enzo so Enzo is good and crushwaight shmash Enzo why it s his first champ !!!! Why good why 😯😯😯😯😯 so whit enzo! It's fair braun and crusiwaight hate enzo why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😣😣😣😣😣😔😔😔😔😔😓😓😓☹😟😤 but next week I say good look for enzo!
This reminds me when the Nexus assaulted Cena back in 2010 without tearing the ring up.
Enzo Amore runs his mouth too much that's why the Cruiser weight don't like him.
Damn Eric. You just got buried for being you.
Who's theme was at the end
I love you john cena
2:29\n Stop it! I can't see nothing.
Hahahaha savage Enzo amore got what he deserved no one will save him Enzo look who's tough now buddy
U guys hating on this segment are totally marking out. It’s working. This should’ve been on tv. Enzo is a hell of a seller I’ll say that.
I thought cedrik Alexander,rich swann and taxes are good
Enzo is a joke now
It seems nearly 3M viewers loved to see Enzo destroyed.
Question.  What's Braun Strowman got to do on the Cruiserweight division scene?  Just your resident madman in the house?
Wow I never knew Braun celebrated the holiday of giving
The best moment on Raw.
Well enzo as much as i like u never piss of the divison by mocking them like how u did with gallagher rich swan gran mataliek etc and no wonder they wanted to beat u up also it wasn't rlly a suprise that nevile wanted to kick your butt after no mercy
The cruiserweights are literally dwarves next to braun
I don't think the cruiser weights don't like Enzo a more at all
It would've been more entertaining to watch Braun Strowman just destroy a bunch of Cruiserweights.
What happened to BA*
3:14: Enzo think of himself what's the reason to live
This was scripted. At 2:50 while they was dragging Enzo into the corner, Enzo lifted his knee up to get into the corner. The WWE are doing this to promote the cruiserweight divison. They are using Enzo as a way to bring the entertainment back into the cruiserweight division. That is probably why they had all the cruiserweights came into the ring to put on a show. Is it true that the WWE is really getting rid of the cruiserweight division?
At least WWE was listening to the comments when we said “send Braun Strowman to 205 Live” 😂
Whose #1 contender now? All the cruiserweights hit him
Very bad all are beating to enzo
I wish Carmella saves to manage Enzo & have Cass  return  save Enzo 2nd reform it.
poor enzo :''(
This is bullying
all them punches was fake asf
ANTI BULLYING CAMPAIGN
2:39 jump \nJump
Wait Cedric betrayed Enzo
TJP didn't give anything
Be a ⭐
Feeling bad for enzo amore
Poor
sabne milke akele ki le li
Why are they beating Enzo??
U DESERVED IT !!!
The knew 205 champion... brauuuuuun
My turn
Why???????????????
This is so satisfying.
Mampus
Who got what he deserved
There gonna kill him..
I want to kill Braden stromen
way they attack Enzo Amore?!
Why strowman Though?
I like it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He deserve it..
For the Watch
Braun Strowman is such a gentleman. Letting the whole crusiserweight divison beat Enzo Amore. Lol
poor enzo
4:20 \nRef: you good Enzo?\nEnzo: yep
The Cruiserweight Nexus
amazing thats what i always want to happen with enzo
Nice interview. Gracious of him to take the time.
Lifelong Liverpool fan and have always liked Gary Neville ... he hated us and we hated him ...a born winner he was a top quality player and very solid guy
Do you hate scousers.. erm... haha I love the hesitation.
No uploads in a year and then you drop this gem.
that moment when you leave Gary Neville hanging
I like Gary but he's wrong about Suarez, if United ever signed suarez it'd be a disgrace to the legend of Uncle Pat.
Lol how'd you manage this, nice one.
The intro made me skip to another video.
1 minute long intro
Great interview, Gary could talk the hind legs off a donkey, awesome fella.
Football punditry has taken a huge leap towards the Simon Cowell end of criticism. It's immediate and tabloid but it works. Most pundits have taken on a contrived media persona now and are almost certainly delighted to be the talking point in the days after a game. Not saying that's a negative thing, I just find it interesting to see this generation of ex-pros going into a television studio and not continuing their careers through management. They suffer from the same ego issues we all do.
Love listening to him
Well done Gary - always talking sense as usual
Best football pundit at the moment
The hairdryer question...I swear I could see Gary's fear coming back onto his face.
Confused when seeing the thumbnail; thought it was prankster EdBassmaster pulling one of those funny faces.
lFC  you'll never win the league  ha ha ha come back when youve  won 18 ha
Amazing work. Been awhile since you uploaded anything, that was definitely worth waiting for! Happy to have one video a year if that video ends up being a sit down with a United legend.
Can not believe neville has actually just said he would love suarez at united might be a really good player but after what he did to evra i would never want him anywhere near man united
Yip, Jose has never hung around that long at clubs. \nBut he's never been manager at a club like this and all that we encompass ❤️
Thank fuck you're back. Also quality interview.
Vid starts at 1:02
Legend
Really enjoyed this, cheers.
Great Interview!
Cranium Giganticus
Absolutely
Great interview
Brilliant vid
amazing interview
Gary being interviewed by the British Seth Rogan!!!
This guy fufilled every manc kids dream. \nFair play to him, always stayed humble and loyal. Respect
Peroni   lovely  lager
I don't hate scousers now says Gary and cue selena's bad liar playing in the background 🤣🤣
Manchester is being destroyed by savage immigration.
Man Utd have always appointed british managers? Tell that to Frank O'Farrell Gary. Man Utd have traditionally had non-English managers, because, in the football world, there is no 'british'.
city winnin the CL is a bigger deal than LFC winnin the PL. im a man utd fan by the way
Gary Neville is a true United legend, bless him!
I am a Everton fan and a Scouser Gary would have been a great central defender he was to short though but Rio was quality .
Intro song??
that table though
Quality interview
Don't want Suarez. Thanks.
Corona is Mexican Mr Neville ;-)
E V E R Y  T I M E
What's that game called?
I actually wanted to kill myself when that happened to me.
MaiMai? No one? Just me? Fine.
TFW a song on Rock Band adds an extra chord/drum fill at the end of a song that originally faded out and you miss.
HAHAHHAHAHA my god. That was perfect. Again, the ending is always what makes me burst out laughing.
i swear to fucking god this is me everytime
As a Project Diva & Rhythm Heaven player, I feel this on a physical, spiritual, & dimensional level. And all the other levels too. Fucking Safes.
That's some cytus shit right there
This is so true. Btw what is worse, these games or Parrapa the Rappa?

Rhythm heaven fever remix 10 in a nutshell
mountain was renamed in honour of Barack Obama.\nMount Obamas height is 1318 feet.\nNot 1317 or 1319 but 1318 feet.\n\nRevelation 13:18\n \nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\n\nMount Obama sits opposite Christian valley or you could say it opposes it.\n\nThe Lord obviously wants believers aware Obama is the Antichrist, combined with the word of God id say this is rock solid proof\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z1jzO_cYb_U\n\n\nRevelation 13:18\n \nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\n\nRevelation 7:4\n\nAnd I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.\n\nWhilst doing some research on #antichristobama i was amazed to find the following calculation.\n\nWe know Obama was born on August the 4th which is the 216th day of the year.\n\nIf we take the 144000 witnesses who will be Obamas worst enemies on the earth besides the 2 witnesses and divide the 144000 by  216 it works out at\n666.666666666\nSo thats FOUR sets of 666 if ever there was a doubt.\nOr\nDivide 144000 by 666 which works out at 216.216216216\n\nSo many pointers to Obama being Mr Lightning from Heaven.\n\n\nBARACK BUSTED IN REVELATION 13:18\n[url]https://youtu.be/8fNSR7yAIvo[/url]

Cant relate with the game choice, but its happen to me in guitar hero
One of the best things about osu mania, the score system isn't some combo-based stupidity.
Honestly, I love all your video's. There is never a bad video that I can ever recall, no matter the joke, Excellent work man.
God this is too real it's scary
Better luck next time, Dennis.\n-King Dragon, That One RPG That Turned Into a Rhythm Game with a Plot
How is this guy always on trending😑😑😑
I don't understand...
I hate this short vines from this guy but he is damn good. Fucker
I used to do full combos on love live without any problems when I first played it, when I redownloaded it I realized that I can no longer do a full combo on any songs anymore. ;__;
Is this chonny/ like I honestly can't see any difference
Why are this guys videos always trending?
this isn't vine \nit's YouTube
what did I just watch.....
Any DDR players remember the end to Paranoia REVOLUTION where it all sounds over as the song fades out, Then 50 more notes in 5 seconds come at you?
Watching third time. Good luck man :'(
I used to be so obsessed with that game, but I'm not as bad as my roomies. They spent over $3,000 collectively on that game.\nIt's a good game tho
People visit the support channel offline, happy everyone happy day
god i hate that so much
I don't care that you broke your elbow.

Hey Estee, I’m a 27 YO guy (probably not your usual demographic) and I randomly discovered one of your vlogs maybe 5 years ago during a break up. It was a rough patch for me, it really sucked. Your videos helped and they were a great distraction. When the pain of the break up finally passed, the love of your videos remained! You, Aslan and Reggie became a part of my morning routine. I feel like I’ve seen you and your channels grow, and I’ve grown up with you too. I’ve travelled so much the last few years and I think your travelling videos are to thank for it, keeping me motivated to see as much of the world as I can. I even introduced my new girlfriend to your videos and we watch them together as often as you upload haha! I’ve just listened to your first podcast and I love this new direction. I wish you all the best and good luck. Anyway, just wanted to pass on some love!
sooo proud of you estee!!! can't wait to see you grow even more!
So awesome! you look so happy!
No! You weren't lucky to win! You won because you were the best. Girls! Don't be afraid of your own success!
Hi Estée this is great!!!!! Also I'm drunk and I love yooooooUUU
what a gang! incredible team and job! cant wait to listen to it all! xx
Thank you for using your platform in a meaningful way, Estee! It's been incredible to watch you evolve from makeup tutorial and clothing haul videos to this beautiful podcast!  Although I still love your beauty/style content, I LOVE the political/social videos you do witih Aslan, as well as this podcast!  Congrats!!
Absolutely love your podcast, so great that you have an all-women team, the quality is top notch!
Your collar was misbehaving. That sounds cute! It bothers me a lot when I get pictures taken and later I see the collar was all messed up! :D
So cool!! Wishing you the absolute best :)) Looking forward to be listening to all of your future podcast haha x
Loved the first two podcasts! Can't wait for the rest!! Congrats and keep the awesome stuff coming!
Esteeeee your podcast is fantastic. I just listened to episode one. :) I'm a naassssty woman too. So proud chic.
I love how in your element your are at the studio!! So proud of you girl, I hope I can be as confident and successful as you are one day :')
Already listened to your podcast and I'm loving it! Can't wait to hear more soon. :)
I loved seeing the behind the scenes of your production, and seeing you feature and talk about the team that you work with.
Definitely going to take a listen :) And thought I should also tell you, that I think, you are such a genuine and unique influencer on YouTube!
All women sound studio? Sooooo cool, congrats, estee, good choice!
So nice to see how your content and confidence has grown with your channel/career, I find myself unsubbing from a lot of youtubers I watched say 5/6 years ago as I feel like the content just hasn't progressed and i'm not interested in the same things I was when I was 18/19. Glad that I'm still loving your stuff though estee keep doin what you're doin x
Gosh i didnt know you had Rosario Dawson on your podcast team ;)
Already listened to your podcasts LOVED IT!

Yay!!! I loved the pilot episode and I'm so happy there will finally be more!
Yayyy!! Absolutely loved the Pilot & first episode ☺️💕
I've just listened to your podcast Tattoos and I loved it! It was a real joy to listen to and I learned a lot and made me want to get another tattoo but one with a special meaning for me. Looking forward to more podcasts! Well done!
As a woman in sound, seeing women in sound gives me so much life 💕💕💕
you're glowing! you can be so proud
I love podcasts so much so when I heard estee was getting aboard the podcast train I was like YESSS!
Kudos to the entire team! Loving all the episodes so far!!! Keep on doing what you love estee! <3

Love your podcast so much. It's fantastic.
I had no idea what podcasts are. But yours is amazing!!! And you are amazing as always. Very well made and so calming to listen to your voice. Congrats!!!!
It was so interesting to hear about the different roles the Wolfgang team played in producing this podcast! Never thought about working in creating podcasts, but I'm totally inspired!!
Congratulations on the new podcast! I already love what you and Aslan are doing with the current affairs videos, so I'm really looking forward to diving into this. It's very exciting to see how you and your content are evolving. I've been watching you and other lifestyle YouTubers for years and honestly, these days, my subscription list is looking stale/repetitive (not another PR unboxing!). Thank you for being so brave and pushing yourself to create new kinds of content as you and your viewers mature. Sending my love from Singapore!
I have so much respect for you Estee. You are a modern day maven - you work so hard, but it's your warmth and authenticity that is at the core of everything you do. Brava x
I absolutely love how you shoot and edit your videos Estee ♥️ The art of craft and quality!
I've been checking my podcast-app regularly, because I absolutely love the pilot of your podcast! The sound effects and the whole concept is exactly what I want from a podcast. xx
I love you! I can't wait to start on the Podcasts. Your Vlogs got me through the hardest time of my life 3 years ago and I've been a dedicated viewer ever since. Please do a meet up sometime in Hamburg!
The protest podcast - I really really enjoyed this! Today I'm going to listen next episode.
LOOOOVE!!! Congratss!! So will this be a weekly podcast? Just finished tattoos and can't wait for the next.
You are so interesting ❤️it
Love all of it Estee
Congratulations! I just subscribed and can't wait to listen 😊😊
Honestly when you first announced your podcast I wasn't interested but after watching this behind the scenes I'm sold! love the insight you provided. Can't wait to see what content you have coming up!
I have been obsessed since the pilot!!!! I absolutely love it estee!!
I already subscribed to your podcast last week and listened to the intro:protest, it was seriously amazing! I can't wait to listen to the first episode! So happy and excited for you on this new business venture! 🤗
I love your podcast. I sat on the train smiling the biggest smile earlier today listening to both episodes. Can’t wait to hear the rest. ❤️
Oh Estée, I am so happy for you!! I can Image how much work it has been to create something so special. I cant wait to hear the new episode on my lunchbreak tomorrow (: love from Hamburg! xxx
you are amazing.  I'm so happy to have seen you grow so much throughout these years . . I've watched your videos for 5 years now ! I really appreciate the topics you are talking about more and more. congrats :)
This makes me so proud of you. Watching you over the years has been nothing but rewarding. I'm super interested in media and radio and this video gave me so much career inspiration. Love you!!
Hi ! Just listened to the first podcast and really enjoyed it ! I have to say Estee i liked your personnality from the day i discovered your channel but you definitely found your thing i mean beauty is great but this (and the talks with Aslan) is so inspirational i am amazed you are a rock'n roll girl just like your mom ;)
The team looks amazing and you've definitely done really good job with the first two episodes. I really enjoyed listening to the podcast, both topics were interesting and the guests are really remarkable people. I really like the new things that you try and that you are not afraid to make changes and do what you enjoy. Good luck!
I can't wait!!!!!! I love everything Estee does.\nAlso: please, please, please could you just quickly tell the camera that was used to shoot this? Thank you!!
That Ghost World reference
Ben sounds so soft, almost soothing haha you guys are totally made for each other :)
So beautiful♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
So beautiful loveeee this!!
Ben is such an amazing husband, you really were blessed with him, Jenn! God bless y'all!! :)
Ben is a good husband 👍🏻👍🏻
You guys are such a beautiful family. Aria is gorgeous. Can't wait to see her grow :)\nAnd I love 냉면 ㅋㅋㅋ
❤️
Cutest babyyyy evaaaa
Who disliked this!!!????
Just Beautiful, thank you!
Such a gorgeous video!
Beautiful video. Wow.
Aww little Oreo snoozing in the background!
Cuties baby girl 💕
I gave birth about 8 months ago and watching this made me reminisce my entire pregnancy and I couldn't help but cry. Ben was so understanding and considerate about everything. It was nice to hear the fathers side of the story.
Congratulations!  I felt great after watching three of you guys.  Wishing you all the best of best in your every step of new life.
I don't often say this but... you two are totally couple goals! What a beautiful relationship. And Aria is so cute!
I can't get over how much Aria has grown. Like, time just seems to fly and every time she's featured in a video. I'm just blown away. \n\nThank you for these type of videos btw....tbh I have tokophobia so pregnancy and the prospects of getting pregnant scare the living daylights out of me but I recognize that in itself, it's quite beautiful and it's such a joy to see the child after the birth and watching it grow. My 3 year old cousins has basically been living with my family since her birth and I'm in awe of how she's growing. Much like Ben said, it's so fun to take a kid somewhere and see them seeing something for the first time.\n\n\n Also, tbh.. I've got a little anxiety when it comes to relationships too ...When it comes to the men in my life, I haven't really had a good example as what it means to be a good husband but Ben gives me hope. It's very easy for me to forget that there are guys out there who are such decent fellows. So, thank you for that as well.
You made so many great points about how new dads can struggle too. I don't have kids but if my husband and I ever do I will be sure to remember this video and thank him for all the sacrifices he is making. Thank you Jen and Ben for sharing such a personal story with all of us. You guys are incredibly brave and inspiring.
This is the sweetest thing ever! I love hearing the two of you talk and how calm and sweet you both are. And oh my goooooodness Aria is adorable! You should invite Ben in more videos in the future. :)
You look perfect together :D
BEAUTIFUL!!!
i love you both sooo sooo sooo mutch!!!!! <333
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Aria is soooo cute😘😘
ben is such a sweetheart, you guys are a perfect pair and family!
One of the best vlogs of Jen :) God bless your little family!!
You guys are beautiful! thanks for sharing a real story. I was tearing up hearing how Ben was anxious about what was happening to Jen. my husband and I are definitely the same type of couple, but we don't have kids yet. I think I am not ready for our lives to change. Thanks for sharing your story and congratulations on beautiful Aria!
Man - this girl must've had the world's most difficult pregnancy. I always felt bad for my husband because he didn't get to experience the amazing miracle of having his child grow inside of him and all the special moments that come with that. \n\nIt wasn't always comfortable but it was special and something only half the world's population is capable of. \n\nAlso - you can go to the movies when you are pregnant haha 😜
Thank you for being so honest ,because a lot of women are a shame to say what really happens and one one person is honest then a makes way for other women to feel okay to be honest 😊
do more videos of aria please! shes so cute
This is my favorite video of yours so far
Thank you Ben for sharing your side and your experience!
this made my heart feel soooo warm and hopeful! what a beautiful couple inside and out, pure love for y'all
U guys r so cute and so supportive
It's funny that my 2 favourite beauty YouTubers are named Jen (Jenn Im) and coincidentally their husband/fiancé are both named Ben 🙂😮❤️🇨🇦
Such a beautiful family:)
I remember when ben would never be in front of the camera 😅
Thank you so, so much for making this precious video! My son is about to turn 8 months, and your video helped bring back a lot of memories along with a big reminder to remember and appreciate my husband's struggle as well. Thanks again!!
You are a beautifully loving family. How lucky you are to have each other and how blessed your little one is to have such devoted parents.
WOW this was amazing to watch. I'm nowhere near a baby but I love watching your pregnancy videos
As soon as Aria came into shot I could hardly focus on anything else Jen and Ben were saying. She's too cute. xx
So great idea to also share the dad story ❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ God bless your fam! 😭
This is so sweet!! Thank you for posting this video and sharing both sides of your experiences with pregnancy, birth, and life after baby. :D Congratulations on your family and I hope you all have a blessed life! Sending love and hugs!
Every single time we see Aria, she just looks so happy! It must be because she knows she has the most loving, positive parents ever! What a beautiful family! Seriously Aria is the CUTEST HAPPIEST baby I've ever seen!
she's such a lovely creature
such an emotional video. I think we all cried :') \nit's so cute that Aria already knows how to always smile to the camera in this video
I've always loved seeing Ben on his Snapchat stories while he was playing with little Aria! Also how incredibly she resembles him :) \nI've loved momtember. It's a pleasure seeing your videos!
Thank you for sharing your beautiful story. I love that you mentioned how the sacrifices increased your love for each other. I have a nine month old daughter and we can totally relate to you both!! So comforting to share the struggles. It's so worth the hardship to be a parent!
Oh that's the best video! I was in tears! We just had our first baby daughter 3 month ago. It was so great to see dads prospective even though we discussed it with my husband!! Thank you very much for that! Brilliant video!!
This is such a great video. Thank you both for being so honest and vulnerable about an intense time in your lives. It is so greatly appreciated. You two are fantastic parents!
This was so so emotional to watch Ive never even had a baby but it made me feel so many emotions.  This was super insightful and beautiful to listen to!
i loooove this video so much, thanks guys- youre going to be great parents :) Jen, can you make a video about things you would and wouldn't to for your next pregnancy that you did for your time with Aria? In terms of mentally (i.e relaxation, prayers etc), physically (i.e practice breathing, exersize, massages etc) and so forth? :D
I wish my husband was like Ben.. When I had my first baby, he wasn't all the time with me, I had to be strong for my baby. I didn't sleep at all, I felt sad all the time, i cried alone.. He was more interested in his cars then us :'( \nNow my baby is two years old, and I have a 4 month old, but he is almost the same. But now he's priority is sex, he is always thinking in sex! :( I don't know what to do.. I'm sorry to tell my life here, i feel like expressing my self, to get out all my stress..  Jen and Ben, I wish you the best!! God bless you guys!
She has ben’s hair lol. This video makes me jealous that you guys have such a wonderful healthy relationship and family. Thank you for sharing your journey.
What a wonderful husband you have. You can tell how much love and respect you both have for each other. I wish more men were like Ben, the world would benefit.
my throat was really tight the whole time watching this video :')
Can echo what you guys mentioned.  I had a hard pregnancy myself, but because it was so hard, I loved my baby and my husband so much more.  Thanks so much for sharing!  It's so important for the husband to also express his emotions and all too!!!
It is so cute that Aria seems to give response to Jen & Ben's conversion! She seems to understand what you two meant !
So honest, I love it!
!!! love love love this video Jen! my boyfriend and i also have this clingy but very strong relationship and I cannot wait to show him this video when the time comes(couple years from now lol) i feel like this video is so honest and helpful and I am so grateful you decided to film this! i wish your family the best :)
Where can I get myself one of these bens
Thankyou for sharing you story. I love this momtember series ❤️❤️❤️
Most beautiful video! You are amazing parents, Aria is so precious! Gob bless you!!!
Wow!! so great to see the both of you
Such a beautiful family!!! 😭❤
I cried so much 😭 you guys are so sweet
You made me feel better. :)
What an adorable family! Thank you Ben and Jen for sharing your story.  Aria is so precious!!!
Such a beautiful story!!! You guys are amazing parents!!!!
She's seriously the cutest baby I've seen
Ah, it's so hard! And we are about to do this again...
You are so, so blessed, Jen 😭❤
Jen and Ben, you guys have a wonderful and beautiful family ❤
This is so beautiful! Y'all remind me of me and my husband, May God bless you and your family!
Beautiful, Just so beautiful :) Have 21 month old and 5 months pregnant :) New journey has begun ❤️❤️
Moms, you guys are ridiculous -Ben 😩 it's one of the Best Compliments any mom could ever get. Thank you Ben for recognizing how ridiculously hard being a mom is. God bless your beautiful family!Aria is one blessed baby to have you two and soooo cute & adorable
You're such a beautiful family 💖💖💖 and Ben is such an amazing father. Hope my future husband will also be so supportive and nice! :P And you can totally see how you're so in love with each other!\nThank you so much for sharing!!
Aria is a twin of Ben!! Even the hair style 😂
Oh im sorry Ben and Jen. Toward the end of the video, I only listen but my eyes is watching Aria 😂
I have to say, I rarely leave comments on YouTube videos (been watching this channel for forever though) but, I've loved this series so much. Both your experiences have mirrored so much of what my husband and I have experienced as new parents (our LO is almost 8 months now). It's so validating and comforting to hear you both speak so candidly about your journey. Thank you for sharing and for the unexpected support :).
Also, can you two please counsel my husband and I? 😂 you two are amazing and so sweet to each other.
Great video. I can relate a lot in that my husband is also my best friend. We do everything together and dont have boys/girls night out. What Ben shared is very similar to my husband's experience too, except he was too nervous to cut the cord. Aria is amazingly adorable! What a blessed family :)
I love this series!!keep it coming please.
Did not expect to cry this much watching this video, but it is really awesome to also hearing the father's side of everything, which is definitely not talked about as much. Thank you for doing this. This makes me look forward to having a family in the future.
This is one of my favorite video.  So touched and cried too :(  I am definitely going to ask my husband to watch this video when we will be pregnant.. ❤️
So nice to hear from Ben,  he should be in videos more 💁🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🙋🏼‍♂️
Such a sweet couple. Congratulations!
Awwww seeing little Aria was so cute! Thank you Jen & Ben for sharing your story! I think I cried like a baby 😭 so sweet how you both recognized each other's sacrifices and love each other even more than you thought before!💕
Such a wonderful family you have. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
The way Aria admires her papa 19:48 is SO precious!! <3
This made me tear up a little. I appreciate your honesty telling your story 💓
Oh gosh I cried. I love you guys so much! Great job Ben!! ❤️
I had a very easy recovery after the birth body wise, but I had PPD and with the changes going on when my baby was born..I hated her newborn phase. I enjoyed her, I love her dearly, caring for her was wonderful, but at the same time I was depressed and I hated my life at times. So many things changed and it traumatized me. My furbabies are gone and I became THAT parent who had to rehome them for their benefit. My husband and I vented to each other, and we got closer,  but we also fought. My two month maternity leave was hell, and she came six weeks early so I was not fully prepared. I can't imagine life without her, and she is now almost 11 months, but I am so traumatized I blocked out those few months. It's not all rainbows when a baby comes into the world, so thank you for being honest with these videos to show people the truth.
After Aria entered the screen, she was all my eyes stated at hahaha. Sorry Jen and Ben, I ignored you both for the last part of the video 😌 She looks like a little elf with those pointy ears, so adorable!!
Ben is such a sweet considerate husband😭😍 Its so true! you always hear the moms side of the story but truthfully its hard for both side. Im currently pregnant with my 2nd child and this time around i could feel how heavy my husband's shoulders are trying to take of the family in every aspects. Big thumbs up to dads out there too! They got alot of responsibility too! I also heard dads can grt post-partum depression too. love your  mommyhood videos!! ♥️
Its nice to hear the father's side, you don't get to hear it often. For those of us who were first time moms and had to learn alone about newborn babies and Google was your only back up lol well I understand you but believe when I tell you that you'll appreciate your baby so much more because you were both getting to know each other.   I can only say from personal experience, in those times of frustration and tiredness I held on to God and he helped me through it all. Now my baby is almost 4 months and I'm so excited to see what the future has instore for us. The key to being a good mother and a good partner is patience and wisdom and above all be open to suggestions from people who have been through it.
Hi Jen, you and Ben mention that you're almost always doing everything together. Sometimes I feel guilty for seeming to be so clingy or being seen together too often. Would LOVE to hear / see more often about your relationship with Ben, how you two built such relationship, and also was there any initial challenges that you two met, given that you're in a relationship with someone from a different race. \nLove, Linda
Omg you have the cutest family! I love how relatable you two are! It's so refreshing!
HE IS SO PERFECT WTF DONT LEAVE HIM EVER
Try https://www.audible.com/numberphile and check out The Mathematics of Love by Hannah Fry\n\nEnvy free cake cutting (the paper mentioned): https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03655 --- A clarifying note from Hannah: n^n^n^n^n^n is the *maximum* number of cuts in the n person case.
I thought they would take the hexagon route.
This is overly complicated. Also why the cuckold metaphor?
It's impossible since you can't divide by three...You can only approximate.
Or you could cut the cake in to 6 equal pieces and everybody get's 2 pieces.
or you could just cut the cake into three uneven slices and just fight to the death like we normally do
This is helping me sleep
Hannah can pour anything in my ear...
make the cake in to sixes. quite easy first cut half (very easy) then cut over the center so that it makes sixes then person #1 gets biggest and smallest #2 gets next largest and next smallest an the 3rd person gets two pieces almost equally as big. the rank is decided democratically
So confused, explanation should have been better.
We've got three people;\nAlice,\nBob, and\nCharlie\n\n....bob...*cracks up laughing*
The only way to fairly split a piece of cake with several others is to ask the waitress to bring extra forks and everyone eats from it in the center of the table.
If you are obsessed with slicing a cake then use an angle mesure.
I have a question\n10 * 0^1 = 0 is correct.\nA = 10\nB = 0^1\nC = 0\n\nA * B = C is still correct.\nLets transpose.\nA * B = C\n---------\n      B\nA = C\n       -\n       B\nSo 10 = 0\n               -\n               0^1\n???
I would pick the one that had been touched the least.
What if Bob unfairly trims the piece and makes it really small , with the second choice he can always get one of the two slightly larger pieces and Alice will be screwed
I'll take the smallest piece to not have to go through this exercise.
Aka how to divvy up weed without  scales.
You simply make enough cake, so there is still some left when all people have eaten what they want. If you need to be this exact with cutting what you have, then you have not made enough cake, and you are a terrible host.
Why do I feel that this is very pointless? Why not just cut into 3 equal pieces??
I think my family will use this for cutting camembert equally. We fight about it a lot
But who is going to cut the cake first? :/
Cut it in 12 pieces, 4 every person.\n\nDone.
Just buy a $10 scale off of amazon if your friends are this weird.
just get a gram scale
just cut the cake in half then in x then each take 2 pieces like a medium pizza
Dr. Hannah Fry is my favourite red head.
There is a major error in your calculations; \nyou don't share a cake with friends. you eat the cake, then share the photos of the cake with friends.
I'm vegan so I don't eat regular cake anyway but how much each person gets, depends on each individuals tolerance and how high/stoned each one of the 3 persons wants to get.
I would cut in half, then into quarters. Each person takes a quarter, and then you cut the remaining quarter into 3 slices.
Just have the person who cuts the cake eat last.
This is insane - one will just end up with a little pile of crumbs when cutting the trimming. Easier to use a protractor than this!
Could this solution work?\nPerson 1 cuts the cake pieces.\nPerson 2 assigns a cake piece to each person.\nPerson 3 switches any two pieces of cake.
Dividing circles into thirds is a very annoying task, because there is no simple on-the-spot mathematical way of cutting it like so. Sure, a compass would help, but who has a compass around when cutting pizza? I sure don't, hah.
If only you were as attentive to words as you are to fractions. You don't share a cake between three people; you share it among three (or more) people. Between is for two and only two.
I remember how I once applied the 2 person version of this to candies when I was 8 Years old:\nWe got 12 small candies and 1 big candy with a friend that we had to share. We both wanted to big candy so I proposed that I would make two piles of candy and he could choose then.\nI put the big candy alone on one pile, and all the small candies on the other.\nAfter he saw this, he just replied with: that's unfair!
Too many people with their hands on the cake.
There is another way to do this\nPerson A cuts a piece of cake and gives it to person B. Person B can choose to cut it or leave it. Then person C can choose to cut it or leave it. The last person who cuts gets the cake. Therefore, if A cuts more than a third, person B or C will cut off a miniscule bit and eat the big piece. If A cuts off less than a third, B and C don't cut it so A must eat the small piece. Therefore, if A, B and C all know this, A will try to cut as close to one third as he can.\nAfter this there will be two people and two third of the cake left. Those people will just use the cut or choose method.
I'd just blend it, and divide by weight....
Why not just give the trimming to the person with the smallest slice?
Charlie seems to risk getting shafted here. If by chance, when he first choses his major portion, he feels all pieces are equal, his choice is arbitrary, and he gets a fair main portion. He then cuts the trimming pieces fairly, and gets a fair trimming portion. Since alice and bob each end up with slightly ABOVE what they feel is fair, Charlie has a relatively smaller value, since he's getting only what he thinks is fair, not fair plus extra\n\nthe same problem seems to arise when bob agrees with the portions decided by alice and charlie in their respective steps, i.e. when Choosing first doesnt confer an actual advantage. rare but possible :)
this gotta be the dumbest thing on numberphile
Or, you know, you could just cut the cake into 6 pieces with precision and each person gets 2 pieces of their choosing. The smaller the pieces the easier it is to make them the same size.
Just get a parent and a protractor
but can you have chocolate milk ?
wtf was the point of this.
So excited there's finally a Selfridge-Conway video on YouTube! I was thinking about making one myself, haha.\nThe first discrete and finite four-person procedure was just discovered last year (Aziz-Mackenzie), which requires 203 steps and 584 cuts! They don't know if it is optimal, though.
easy!!!!!!!!!!! weigh the cake pieces before you share.............................
I think after this no one will eat the cake 🙁
Interesting technique - the generalization to ethics is obvious - the solution tries to satisfy their preferences in a fair way in some sense. There is a problem though - an envy free solution is not necessarily optimal. Counterexample - person 1 loves frosting, person 2 hates frosting, person 3 likes a mixture of cake and frosting. If person 3 chooses the first set of slices then they could make three slices with frosting and cake in every slice without regard to other people's preference. The end result in obviously suboptimal  - the best would be one slice with only frosting, one slice with only cake and one slice with a mixture.
Problem. First person cuts completely even lets say. The second person can then cut one slice completely in half. The third person goes and picks between the two pieces that didn't get cut in half. Then the second person does not choose the piece he cut in half. First person gets the half piece and then the the other half piece gets split to both second and third persons enjoyment and first persons saddness.\n\nThe second person would have to be forced to take one of the pieces he chose to compare/cut. While maybe in the rules of the cutting method it was never stated in the video
giving makes you happy, to some point
Only problem is: IF people were indeed happy with what some authority figure tells them they have to be happy with, there would be an even simpler solution. But as they are not, this solution will only work for mathematicians who accept the proof.
If I put n=2 in the formular presented I get about 6.03*10^19727, but there is only 1 cut needed.\nIf I put n=1 in the formular presented I get 1, but there is no cut needed.\nIf I put n=3 in the formular presented I get a number which is too big to be ever written down, but there are only 5 cuts needed.\nThis formular doesn't seem to work.
There is a flaw in the way you described that.\n\nIf Charlie chooses the _trimmed_ piece, Bob needs to cut the trimming.  Simply put, if Charlie takes the trimmed piece, cuts the trimming into pieces and Bob chooses his trimming piece first, Alice could be unhappy because Bob got more trimming.
whats with the drawings
Cut it into 6 equal pieces  (pretty easy it's like slicing a pizza) and each of the 3 people gets 2 pieces
warm mucus-y milk... Just gonna leave that comment there...
well that wasn't boring at all
1. I would listen to 50 hours of Hannah's mouth clicks.\n2. The pie shall be cut in two, and each man shall receive...Death. I'll eat the pie.
If you made the cake, you would of probably used scales to measure the ingredients. Just weigh the whole cake and divide the cake in to 3 equal weights.\n\nOr if you don't have a scale, give the smallest piece to the fattest friend and the biggest piece to the skinniest one. Fatties don't need extra cake.
from my practical insights it's awkward to cut a circle into 3 pieces but it is easier to cut it into 6, like they cut pizza, and then everyone gets 2 pieces each. But yeah nah if its cake we are talking about it should be divided by mass not by top view area, cause it never gonna be perfect all around, if its apple pie then one piece is gonna have more apples in it and so forth
stop pushing your commie propaganda on me youtube
why not just chop it into crumbs and give each person a spoon.
Simplified version, person 1 cuts into 3. Person 2 picks favorite two, makes them equal. Person 3 gets choice. Person 2 second choice. Person 1 remainder + trimming. No need to cut the trimming into three, waste of time plus everyone is already happy. Person 1 probably didn't cut perfectly and the trimming should make up for that.
I think we can skip dividing the trimmings.   Bob has selected his two favorite pieces, X and Y.  Bob is then required to trim off part of one, and ADD it to the other.  So let's say Bob trims off T from piece X.  That trimming is added to Y.  So now we have X-T and Y+T.  Bob does this such that he would be equally happy with getting either X-T or Y+T.  Charlie then chooses between those two. Bob gets the other of those two, and Alice gets the one that Bob left alone.
Or just use a protractor.
there is really easier way to do it as well ... just buy 3 cakes :D
just cut it in 12 equal pieces and give 4 of them to each one
Hannah Fry is an absolute marvel of a person.
and that's what happens when a mathematician tries to be a psychologist... Ridiculously bad.
1. Place the cake on a lazy Susan.\n2. Cut the cake into 3 pieces.\n3. Spin!! Spin it like you're playing a game of Wheel of Fortune..\nHmm.. Now how to decide who goes first?
The animation was so necessary.
Disappointing
Whats so unfathomable about thirds?
Cut into 6 pieces . Done!
Who gets all those crumbs?
Piece of cake
Eat everything, run fast
or rock paper scissors
That animation is terrifying
just get a scale ffs
Or just cut it in half 3 times and everyone gets 2
Why not cut into radial thirds
This is awesome!
Alice, bob and Charlie huh, Charlie... yeah right.
I have a better idea: Cut it quarters since this is much more accurate, they each choose one, then cut the quarter in quarters (again more accurate than thirds), repart until the remainder is too small to matter.
Or just use a protractor at 120 degrees ?
This is overly complicated. Cut the cake in half, cut the halves into halves, and cut two of those halves in half. Five cuts in total.\n\nFor three people. The model doesn't work for anything but three people.
Or you could just cut it with three lines, done.
Just cut the cake into sixtfhs and have two slices each? XD
person 1. cuts three pieces\nperson 2. pick top two pieces and trims one to make two equal pieces (trim is added to other piece - not separated)\nperson 3. 1st pick\nperson 2. 2nd pick\nperson 1. 3rd pick.
Can't you just split it in 6 and give each 2 pieces
Why don't you just slice a cake by 4 pieces and slice one of them in 3 which is easier than slicing the whole cake?
The smallest piece is for the dog, duh. 🙄
Or just get out your protractor
360:3 = 120, what s hard about that ? Every piece is gotta be 120 degrees wide
What's wrong with cutting the cake as for four and then halving the remaining quater? Or cutting it into sixths?
and this is why socialism doesn't work
This BS they use in Israel  to torture Terrorists (i am talking a bout the video)\nSuch a BS video (yes its some what solves the problem but its a problem in it self annoying and long process)
Charlemagne pretends like he is okay with gay people but you can tell he is uncomfortable.
No dude, you're not educating people...you're glorifying wickedness.   We are not interested in all things gay....go sit down.  Is Yaz still getting 30K per episode?
I think we all think this interview was weird because the sexual tension between Charlemagne and Lee Daniels is undeniable
I'm sure Hakeem is NOT gay!!! Y'all need to stop with all that. He is young and shy. Give him a chance guys!!!!
Did Charlemagne say he did not know where to nut 🤔 47:57
@charlamagne is not willing to talk shit to a person that he can receive opportunities from in the future... he is simply a PUPPET!
What in all the entire hell is going on in this interview? I feel weird for them...i have  this over whelming feeling to just turn but I can't stop watching lol.
Why do they have their arms folded?
First time ever seeing Yazz like this . Idk what happened
Interview started off with a slow vibe. Everyone got comfortable as it went along. It was good overall. Hakim kind of threw the energy off with his Batman Dark knight voice. Lee Daniels deserves his respect
I dunno it's like the vibe from this interview was slightly weird it's like   there's a lot of shame and regret in his eyes behind those glasses, it's like lee said I'm a give you a shot but first...... (champagne cork popping sound)
10mins left in the video and I just realized that Envy isn't there 😂😂😂
Lee sound like he still on drugs... He loud sweating and seem confused
Why did that Yazz nigga or whatever his name is keep whispering the whole damn interview??? That shit was irritating the hell outta me
What does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul and booty hole.
Their energy together is strange.
what medicine are you on that cause you to whisper?  lmao!
That lil dude made it weird. He acts like he trying not to say yes sleeping with lee.
DID HE GIVE DAME HIS MONEY LOL
Why is Yaz acting so weird damn is he tired,high or somethin this interview is really awkward af but Charlemagne is hilarious as usual 😂😂😂😂
Bryshere really looks a little off for some reason..especially around the gay subject convos..I've never seen him so solemn in an interview..
Lee Daniels fuckin the shit out of Hakeem. 😂😂😂 allegedly
Why is Bryshere acting so stank? Uncross your arms and talk into the damn mic lol
What is going on in this interview???????? 25 mins in and I'm done.
say what you want about lee but he likes to give his people work! more than some people here can ever do
That old head is annoying
Im not even an advocate weed smoker and Bryshere is DEF HIGH AF. He got all the symptoms and its super obvious.
This was a dope interview I don't think either of them are used to doing interviews which may be why it was a little awkward in the beginning but they found their flow. 👍🏽 loved it
Lee is funny - and bayard  rustin - very crucial
This kid's fade is flawless
Why Lee Daniels put his whole mouth over his water bottle when he drinks lmao smfh
This must be the most dryest interview..... Is there something Ihave missed?
I respect ✊🏽 that Lee doesn’t want gay men to infect straight black women. I wish more gay men felt this way and would only sleep with men. HIV IS so bad for black women duped by bi men these days. Respect Lee
lol charlamagne is not letting bryshere live lmao!! it is peculiar that he talks in such a low tone though
CTG is way to interested in Lee's sexuality. The brother is gay, move on.
The stench of ass all in the air.
Yall complain when a black director makes movies about slavery.. yall complain about white directors making movies about slavery.. yall complain that theres TOO MUCH movies about slavery and yall complain when theres not enough movies about slavery... CAN WE CHOOSE ONE THING TO BE UPSET ABOUT DAMN! \nAnd I felt like Bryshere had the loop of the teacup being stirred playing in his head this whole interview.. anyway much success to Lee
Something is off about this interview,, I'm catching gay vibes from Bryshers
lee stay strong and leave the haters in the dust
empire better have ratings through the fckin ROOF with all these commercials\non here today. 😩😩😩
Is this shit old bruh? Niggas acting like this season 1
Bryshere look like the donkey from shrek when i was looking at his teeth.
Oooh, Bayard Rustin! I remember there was a documentary on him called, The Other Brother. It was on cable LONG ago. He definitely deserves a widely released film. Yeees 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I love Lee Daniels, but this was the one of the hardest to watch interviews I've ever seen on the BC.  Lee's interview on the Marc Maron Podcast is really good.  Lord Bryshere should have been left at home.  I couldn't get through this mess, way too much effort to get through..
breakfast club, y'all FAKE... why you ain't tell Lee to stop cursing? 😂😂😂
I am I the only one that thinks both Lee and Bryshere were high off something
That was a really, really great interview 🙌
Nothing about this interview was awkward 😂😂 y’all are weird.
did Lee Daniels wipe his sweat as if he has a wig on.... watch it..
Lee Daniels is smashing that dude on the low
It's 2 minutes in and i feel like this video was going to be boring... I'm out
Why did Lee Daniel laugh like that when Charlemagne asked brishe what don't you do.. @11:39 this interview hella suspect
Man this a dry ass interview
People need to stop acting like homosexuality isn't wrong, just because its become more accepted in society today doesn't make it right. And America has turned into a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah and Babylon and I believe GOD is not happy with America today and we wonder why so much destruction is happening in America today because America has turned her back on GOD and made the devil her GOD. So as long as she continues to serve the devil instead of GOD America will always be a country of confusion and destruction. America needs to stop saying that she's one nation under GOD and say she's one nation under the devil.
The interview is always going to be awkward if Angela Yee has to start off the questions
Why Hakeem act like he don't wanna talk? 😂
With all due respect and keep in mind I’m saying with all due respect Lee Daniels look how my mom used to like when she was going through meta-pause at the beginning of this interview.
I love my kids He sound like Michael
I Pray someone is not using their hollywood powers to sexually extort and control this young man,,shame on you if so,, the vibe was very uncomfortable to watch!! Something is very wrong with this pair. Love you Bry
This interview was cringeworthy.  @ 22:48 bryshere caught hisself tho, he almost slipped up So the Miami trip where we fell.......  Both these niggas suspect af.
dope ass interview. Lee was cool to me
Lee is a classic narcissistic. And he's fucking the shit outta Hakeem
Charlamagne had me dying laughing at 47:56.  He's a straight up fool for real. lmao
What's up with the folding of the arms between the both of them 👀
Y u make those comments about black women being aids patients
The scene at 7:27 has me dying. Especially when he sips the water at the end. Idk, but something seems off with this interview.
Not watching empire no more that show going be like the show . the game
I Enjoyed the interview I was not fond of Lee based on What Monique was saying bout him. But He seem Mad cool. But Ummm Yaaaaaz seem still young and impressionable..He hasnt truly found his voice as a Man alot of still kid like ways lacks confidence. Or maybe cuz Lee was there he felt he didnt matter. But I would hope Lee aint bothering that boy like some comments been saying. But Lord in this World who knows. SMDH.
Being gay is mental illness...it was listed in med journals
DAMN. Did Bry not want to be there or something? It is so weird and offfff to watch lol..
Lol So I'm convinced that if I see that gay flag in any other vids niggas sweeter then C&H suger!!!
The black community is everything but civilized, educated, or industrious people but yet they're a bunch of hard-working drug dealers, whining booty twerking ass thugs, who will never amount to anything but government assistance an mooching off of the next person, looking for handouts.The only thing that matters to blacks is guns, money, cars, and rap music
is Byshare high or he just woke up ?
This nigga super gay I'm out
Lee Daniels has an awful personality. You can see that he has many unresolved issues.
Lee has the most dangerous and scary energy I’ve ever seen on a person. He’s or whatever that being is, is not good.
Lee Daniels did hakeem hair b4 the interview
We watched this on a flat screen I look around and everybody in the living was frowning like they was about to throw up shit ain't natural
Very weird. .. I'm out !
🏳️‍🌈
he been skipping chest day.....
Charamagne is ignorant 😂😂😂😂
That cocaine got them draining lol... 👑
THEY ARE DATING 🤐
Awkward.
45:37 Charla's laugh floored me LOL
I apologize...good interview
I bet the shades are covering his water filled eyes,his whole self looks sad like he just wants to cry. hopefully he didn't give his body up for this fame ,he really looks depressed.
Natural interaction ....good interview
Bryshere just high y’all lol
i like freaking Charlemagne....lolo
Ackward AF
He got a potty mouth lol
The ending tho 😂😂😂
lee fuckn that lil boy!
https://youtu.be/qKXmawcTQbo

I am fucking shooketh
SO FRESH!!!! I'm so glad she's finally doing her own thing, suits her best! \nI already covered Havana, would you guys mind checking it out? ♥️♥️
But i think she look like “Selena Gomez”
I like to come Ila better when she was in fifth harmony that's my opinion so don't hate
WHY IS THAT GUY BEHIND THE BACK IS SO ANNOYING!!?!
Don't like it 😐
That trump guy is going hard
literally only paying attention to the trumpet player the whole time 😂 love it
You took my ♥ girl

Cant stop myself, I watch this everyday
this is my 20 th time in oneday....omfg
The guy in the background 😂😂
Lip syncing.
Yall hyping her up waaaay to much. Just another generic pop girl with basic vocals and simple step to step choreography. and the song sounds exactly like 'same old love'. a mess
i love u camz
Excellent performance with 0% nudity (unlike they say u need nudity to advertise in music industry)
All I know is HYPE
Does anyone else think that Millie Bobby Brown looks like a young Julie Andrews?
Looks like an optic nerve.
The show comes out on my birthday!!!
The Upside-Down will be the Down-Upside this season
I hope the “Shadow Monster” is called the Teslahydra like it was teased at the end of season one.
I liked the buzzcut tho
My theory is it's all gonna tie back to the flea and the trapeze artist analogy. We've seen the trapeze artist in Eleven and the season 1 monster.  Will is the flea, he doesn't need a door to get to the Upside Down.
LESS THAN ONE MONTH TO GO
5 bucks says will is actually dead, and\nThe monster is a manifestation of his dimensional, unintentional, link to the “normal” reality. \n\nHis death/life presence is an inter dimensional  gateway to then upside down realm.\n\nIts all one big game of\nD&D
You should just rename the channel to Spoiler Warning. I think Jessica's getting sick of saying it. lol
I want that coffee mug. Will you sign it for me Jessica Chobot? Please :)
This is Us spoilers at 1:28! Maybe, I don't watch the show. I don't know. But maybe!
When she said spoiler alert i dipped
It's Amygdala from Bloodborne. Look it up.
I just want a glimpse of Kai Greene :(
To their DOOM! that made me laugh. Anyway, I definitely think Will is some sort of bridge between the two places. I think he was exposed to the Upside Down and can now see it.
The thing in the sky is like the Jabberwocky from Alice in Wonderland. A big bad takes the shape of something in the person's mind and ramps it to 11.
Cannot believe it’s a month away!!! I don’t know if it’s coincidence but I asked for that week off at work haha the upside down is calling me
can't wait for this season...!!! XD
wear more boots Jess that you can fall
the shadow monster looks like darkrai in pokken tournament whn he uses his special
Less than a month away? October 27th is practically the entire new month 😫
Hmm if someday there are guided tours to the Nerdist's office 🤔... PLEASE include the kitchen!! 😏...
When's the reveal that dustin is actually ash ketchum??
Now we need to know the hidden details that we missed about jessica chobot when she was talking about the hidden details about the strangers things shadow monster! Asap!
Nerdist Please Please when you use a footage of movie/show while anyone is talking in the background (especially Jessica) put a small screen of him/her talking down in corner of the screen
If that theory were to hold, about the Demi-gorgon being a manifestation from Eleven then how does that explain her return? Also, at the end of Season 1 Hopper was bringing waffles to her, so she defeats the Demi-Gorgon which she created, just to re materialize in a completely different part of Hawkins that Hopper had a theory about?\n\nI personally think she has a Charles Xavier like complex. I think she's unknowingly WAY stronger as a telapath.  I think she's psychically linked to people when she wants to, or if she thinks about them they begin to communicate. I think this is how she's reached out to Hopper. I think she'll reach out to Mike and gang in a similar way. I do think Will is a villain, and it'll be a showdown between the Demi-gorgon (which is physically the different dimension version of Eleven) and Will's shadow creature that is his different dimension version.
I think that Will may not be an accidental agent exactly, in the sense that he might end up possessed or controlled by the upside-down.  But I think that maybe the part of the upside-down that stayed with him (the 'slugs' in his belly) might create a physical connection between the upside-down and our reality, a connection which would allow the two to cross over between one another.  Kind of like the doorway created by that government agency.
Hey jessica do you think the original cast from MMPR was in the new power rangers movie back in march? #NerdistNews #TheRedRangerIsInStrangerThingsSeason2
Man! People have to write the most confusing complicated story to even excite the audience these days.
Will Is The Avatar.  Bridge Between Worlds.
The Shadow monster is called Thessalhydra.
The misuse of the word theory truly astounds me.
how is that script chobat?
I CANT FUCKING WAITTTT
Nice!
Hypeeeee
Early
Sean Aston is a turd
I had another Christina Hendricks dream, lube tastes funny
Grasping at straws
Love the hair, Jess!
Cthulhu..........
God cant wait\n\n\n\n\n\nMore stranger things
I still think the Duffer brothers should have stuck to their original plan and made Stranger Things as an anthology series.
Could the shadow monster be a Evangelion Leliel kind of deal
Chobot is so damn Beautiful!!! 😍
With so much of this show inspired by Stephen King or more particularly It, does that mean we're going to get a kiddie gangbang in this season?
I have a theory, The boys meet Max and then find a gate to the upside down and do not find eleven. So then they try to find their way out and make it out, then then in about an hour Eleven makes it back from the upside down and then that's when the episode finishes. Episode two, Will starts to see things again and gets trapped in his mind for a while and sees the thessalhydra then stops seeing the upside down and then Will goes to see a doctor. That's what I think of the first 2 episodes.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the upsidedown is just a metaphor for crack?
The giant arachnid thing isn't Lovcraftian at all. It's more Kingian. Remember _The Mist_ ?
hey nerdist news my name is SAM kyereh addo i am 25 years old and i am from Toronto Ontario Canada\nover the last couple of days i been posting some comments about the nerdist news tv show pilot \ndid your show got picked up to go to series \nlet me know talk to you soon \nand once again i like your show
I'm sick of people being so obnoxious when it comes to spoilers. Just say Spoilers! and move on. I'm just being picky i guess...
4th
5th
1st
YEEEESSSSS!!!
I'm glad what's her face is back, alien ressurection, scissor hands, shoplifting
First
Tbh I didn't adore the first season, but I am excited for the second one.
You dumbo's ruined westworld and the finale for me cause of your theories coming true. And i know people will say well then dont watch it especially when the spoiler alert comes along...and to that i say...how many of their videos are theories and spoilers? might as well unsubscribe immediatelly.
Jajajaj Just after your video was published, a stranger things trailer was uploaded
Ima keep it real, this song didnt need a video lol. We need Say I Didnt, Memories on 47th, Down For Some Ignorance, We Could Be Free, etc if I forgot any (not all of them but at least ONE instead of this song)
I feel like I'm the only one who actually fucked with this song.
Here come the Akademiks dick riders.
Vic really don't deserve the hate he underrated asf as a lyricist 🔥 imma need that We Could be Free or Down for Some Ignorance vid next
Dope Vic dope
I must be the only one who actually likes this song
fan of Vic but this is awful, vid is embarrassingly bad. Song trash. I am disappoint.
Give travis scott his style back
I want a music video for Coffe and Cigarettes  that song is so beautiful I need a visual of it!!!!!
Best song I've heard from Vic in a while! Sounds so good/ Please do a remix with Travis and Ye.
what kind of sweatshirt\n  on 2:53?????????????
Stop sleepin on bro \n\n#DreamOrDie
This shit is all kinds of fire,you bum ass niggas in the comments hella confused
This Illuminati ass shit turnt doe
THEY SAY “VIC ARE YOU OKAY?!” DUDE NO WAY, I DONT EVEN KNOW NO MORE!
PLEASE make a video for homewrecker or down for some ignorance
One of my fav songs since the album dropped. I wish I wrote it. Equally beautiful video to compliment it. 2:42 onwards always fucks me up!! Shheeeesh the melodies. I like how Vic has grown and if you're a true fan you'd notice the growth too
Would've preferred a Liquor Locker video!
Nigga why you sell your soul man
this mans a real G he has my respect 100% anyone hating on him is a bitch behind a computer.. BIG UPS I feel like he's in his own lane, he got bars for days, one of the best underrated rappers for sure. I wanna see more freestyles my dude.
i bet this song will go off in festival live stages
The whole video plus the song reminds me of a skit from key & Peele.. lol
I swear this dude looks like D'Angelo Russell
its a yes for me💥💥
Love to vic but video deserved a better narrative. Could’ve benefited from that passage he wrote at the end of memories on 47th for the beginning of this video. Hopefully more visuals come soon cause this was a wasted opportunity for helping this song gain more attraction 😶
Already loved this song but loved it even more after going to his show in LA. Honestly one of the best songs to see live.
Good shit, now for that homewrecker music video
Can't believe so many people hating on this.  The Autobiography was one of the best albums I've heard in a long time, this song is straight heat.  Vic is a legend.
People actually don't like this song,dumbasses.I'm really feeling this song (video is okay I guess ).So proud of Vic
Operator: 911 what's ur emergency? \nMe: AAsEJWJWKBSKWBSKSHAJWJWJWIWWJJWWIW VIC MENSA JUST SET MY HOUSE ON FIRE HELPP HOLY ShTtttttt🔥 🔥 🔥
shout out to fake hair !
Most of the songs on his album is not catchy. Whatever happened on Homewrecker he needs to do that again. This is a big fail for Vic, don’t give me wrong I generally love what he does but not that shit
I fuck with it
Don't really know to match about this dude even though the song is simple for a guy like this cuz what I have heard homies got bars he's on that line where he's about to Blow word up
I fuck with this song
Rollin like a stoner, one of the more hyper.party-type songs, fitted with a wacky mellow type of video. \nGotta say, I'm a little disappointed..
Awful music video 😂 but the song alright
this should of been the first single
Saw a Hot97  interview with Vic a few weeks back and he seemed to have a good head on his shoulders. It inspired me to check this video when it came across my radar. But neither video or song are doing him any favors. We've seen and heard this all before. This video is a waste of money and this song is forgettable. How disappointing.
this video reminds me of the weeknd, I feel it coming / party monster
So glad this music video finally came out
ALL YALL STUPID ASS FANS TWEAKIN HARD AS FUCK THIS MUSIC VIDEO IS DOPE AND SO IS THE SONG SO YALL PUSSY NIGGAS NEED TO GET OUT YOUR FEELINGS 😤
2:44 reminds me of a beatle song it definitely has a beatles influence on the melody
Why tf Vic only got 20k in a day ??! He too nice
bruh am i the only that thinks this nigga Vic looks like “Ozuna’s” twin brother
As much as I wanted to see a video to Didn’t I, but this great.
Y'all don't feel it cuz you not rolling like a stoner mah nigs, not for you lol , you gotta jam to this one
I PRAY U GET OUT OF THAT DARK PLACE
Can't believe how much I didn't fuck with Autobiography
Best song on the album
much love from your native home. GHANA
OMG is better :/

What the hell is this shit???
who directed this... it's horrible!
He used to be so good man..... what the hell happened
Haha your a Mensa!!!  Haha!!!  Your name means. Stupid woman in spanish!  Ah ha ha!
People are saying this song is trash yet if u listen to the lyrics it's nice. The end part is also nice. Also if u didn't like it go blast ur Lil Pump shit! \n\nP.S. I get Vic fans who couldn't feel the vibe to it. It really takes a different level of understanding on this one.
Vroom Vroom: Check\n\nSauce (not ketchup): Check \n\nLyrics that make you sound like a neckbeard but are ok since you have a bit of money: Check\n\nReally this covers the  list of requirements for a shitty rap song.
Lmao this the worst shit i seen all day
cant tell if hip hop or pop
I can't help but think he sould his soul.
Vic dope af and his music sick but videos need some work
This shit is fucking trash
Thanks Vic for using my car in the shoot!  Looks great and I love the video and subject. Mr. Vintage Machine Movie Cars
trash
COOL
I didn't know J Cole had a son
Thoroughly enjoyed that
this is fucken terrible....
Chance at :48 😂
I wonder what's the significance of the scene with the old white lady and the boy? Besides Vic and his mom obviously
This is the worst music I've heard in 2017.
Y
Vic keep doing your thing
sigh... this isn't down for some ignorance..??? why...

Louis you're my fucking hero! I spilled a full glas of red vine over my 1 week old macbook pro (late 2013 bought it 2nd hand). i was frustrating and hated myself. you gave me confidence so i decided to open it up and repair it on my own. it was completly dead (even no light on the charger). i renew all damaged connections... some pins even vaporized when i heated them up because of the acid from the vine. i was lucky that i didn't need to buy any new components. i want to thank you for motivating people to do those repairs on their own, and you do well in showing that your skills are not special, actually everyone can do it with some practice. the microscope aswell the ultra sonic cleaner on my working place helped a lot of course... keep moving on - your repair videos are just fucking hilarious, i had to laugh a lot while i was realising i potentially lost 1000$. lots greetings from germany :)))) this message has been written on a water damaged macbook pro
It's New York, who cares. Everything is trashy and dirty there.
man... gotta love the city
This is a joke right Louis? He put that hose in there just to get parts to fix it correctly correct?
There's no way ANY self respecting HVAC tech would do that. You must of hired someone from Backpage or Craigslist. If you were looking for a quick fix,  they sell plastic clip on fittings for the bottoms of some brands of window AC's to redirect the condensate. Worst case scenario, I would of threaded in a brass male threaded adapter to 1/2 inch pex fitting (depending on the diameter of the hole the water is dripping from. Then slide some vinyl tubing over it, securing the tubing in a corner with a few 3/8 inch tubing clamps. $95
What kind of (insert politically correct word for retard here) would cone up with this, then try and charge money for it?  I'd do better than that for free!
I think the tubes too short!   Let's call it 'Art'?  or how to read a Mans Mind!
Take that tube thing and shove it real hard in that contractor's poop shooter. It needs to be wrecked like what I just saw of his doing to your letters. No consideration whatsoever. You walk pass your store door and condensation better not drop on your balls instead go balls deep up his. I hired contractor and he started wrecking the neighbors stuff and here I am finding out he's fixing this wreck on my watch and taking over two hours to do it.
It just lacked someone to inspect or did the quality check on the workmanship.  If the contractor did not provide the QA person then the client should do the inspecting for a sign off.
You know... this is the second time (by my count) that you've made the front of Digg?  That's rather impressive I think!
Hello,\n\nWe’d love to feature your video on our Facebook page - VT (https://www.facebook.com/vtdotco). We have over 18million followers and we'd link all the credit back to this video on YouTube!\n\nLet me know if this is OK and feel free to email me on permissions@junglecreations.com
How much did you pay?
Sounds like you need an appliance repair person. Not a contractor......
Looks like something a Mexican would have done,you know those brilliant border jumpers we must have here because of their talents
Well you cheap bastard , shouldn't gone with a licensed contractor!
I would of attatched a tray to the bottom of the unit, with a pvc connector funneling the water to a pipe running down the wall to the sidewalk. Itd work and look much better!
Well, I guess those claims that Trump didn't pay contractors might be for crap like that then
holy shit\ni should move over there if contractors over there are so shit lol\ni couod do good just by being able to do a normal job lol
please, save your money next time and buy yourself a better camera
You're telling me you don't have a spare iPhone to record this with, Louis? Yeesh...
This guy sounds like he should be eating a calzone and grabbing his vick
That's highly unacceptable.
Did the video quality go from ok to potato for anyone else? Looks like minecraft
Didn't they show you the repair before they left ? Not all contractors are the same. Just do your homework next time on the guy you decide to hire. Be responsible and you will have better results.
How did an unedited video make it on trending?
Who was the worker? I have work for him
Why would you call a contractor for a window unit ??
I guess you don't take Uber then.
The unit isn't exactly leaking per se, its just hot and humid outside so water is accumulating on the evaporator coil. Looks like that is a packaged window AC which are intentionally slanted to the outside for drainage, rather than running a condensate drain line. Looks like whoever you hired, installed a piece of shit condensate line. The condensate drain can be done cheaply with soldered copper.  I guess the point is, you are still going to need to install a drain which directs water away from the entrance. Maybe hire a plumber to hang a condensate line, i'm in Canada, budget price for that (non-union), $400. Also, get a quote with a scope of work you both can sign off on, that way you can hold them to a copper line for instance, rather than taped tubes or whatever this guy used. Be specific on the route you want him to run.
What are you talking about? That's exactly how I'd do it.
Did you get an AC repair guy? Because at that point, you're better off buying a new one
I love Donald J Trump!!!
Ah so that's why trump did pay his contractors
Please buy a new camera
I know my father is a contractor... works under a millionaire... and heck I know he would probably bitch slap that other contractor...
Be a man, and fix the damn thing yourself! Jesus, do you also pay a mechanic to put washer fluid in your car too?
That's why I hate the city.
You would have to pay if it was duck tape.
This is why Trump wanted mexicans to build the wall
New York, America's shit hole :)
The reason i dont pay contractors is because im broke
Best I can do is 25¢
Looks like fake. However anything can be spected. That work deserves a big facepalm( and to look for the 4chan's cams).
So how come you didn't fix it yourself
Something tells me this guy did not call an actual contractor. He probably called an unlicensed handyman because he didn't want to pay for an actual tradesman to come out and do the work. At least I hope that's the case.
Congrats on getting on Trending. I’ve been watching you since you were at around 25000 subscribers. Keep up the good work!
I would hand them the traditional payments of my people. A banana shoved into a pile of my own shit. There is nothing more sacred than this as payment for good deeds.
Probably be easier to just get waterproof duct tape and tape the leak
cheap, fast, and good. Can't have all three .
Russian Hack, we call it in Germany =)
Contractor was dumb ass you can't fix that.
Oh yes...this only happens in NYC.
Put your contractor on blast!!!
You New Yorkers have the coolest accent in America.
I'm from PA and see this in the warehouse I work in... lol
Correction, that is not duct tape. It is a high tech polymer film used by NASA to control the international space station's water leaks. So it should be good enough for New Yorkers 👽
You should pray more often Louis!!
WTF?! ROFLMFAO!!😂 THOES guys wouldn't get paid shit unless they actually did the job right if they did my shop! Then they try to charge extra I'll just go nope you get what you asked the first time that last job wasn't worth shit!
hahahaha... Louis, that was so funny!
Wow, just wow no other words.
Looks fixed to me.  I love NY
As a contractor from washington, this makes me sad...
That was pretty creative not going to lie.
From the A.C....to the wall...till the ac drips down my ballz..ooo these contractors foul.
Crazy. They couldn’t even bother to use duct tape!! 😂
That ac is in a shitty location and a window unit to boot. Cant place a condensation line cuz it located above the entrance. Someone will sue you for slipping on the water on sidewalk.
who puts an air conditioner above a door? that's my question. looks like a safety hazard without angle brackets.\nplus it has to drip somewhere.. on customers? guess that's the city for ya!
Lol, in my country we would not pay that asshole and I'm from the former soviet block.
No way a contractor did that, first of all you needed to call an HVAC contractor, not a low bid handyman. But it was still a funny video.
Jokes on him, the AC is supposed to leak from there.
I'm not sure what else could be done. AC pulls moisture out of the air, and this particular type of unit releases the moisture out of the back. Some allow you to hook a hose, but that water does have to go somewhere. Many have no connection port as the water is condensed onto the coils and just drops out of the back.
You look like you need some fucking sleep bro
Why in the hell would you put a condensing unit above the front door of your establishment? It's called a Condensing Unit for a reason....it produces water from the heat and humidity in the air! OMG!!! Spoiled city slickers!
Nobody cares if your a real New Yorker
No FUCKING way!!! Jesus.. CHRIST!
eeeh, foget abooouut it!
Nuke New York
Truth
Seems legit
25 cents for trying
Wtf😂
Trending?
Sue those assholes
bra
AC's drip water. That's how they work. Your car AC does the same. What is your proposed solution for this? The guy could have routed a pipe along the glass hidden in some material but then you'd be paying a helluvalot and still complaining. Given the location of the AC, what's your solution?
If you want to pay 15 dollars for a fix. This is what you deserve.
Well Louis being that this is window Air Conditioner unit \nCause 1: Clogged Condensate Drain Line\nCause 2: Damaged/Rusted Drain Pan\nCause 3: Broken Condensate pump\nCause 4: Dirty Air Filter\nCause 5: Low Refrigerant\nCause 6: Excessive Pressure (Dirty Condenser/Evaporator Fins) \nCause 7: Frozen Evaporator Coil\nWhen was it last full maintenance cleaning schedule done 10 years age? LoL
fugetaboutit!
Which contractor? Expose him/her!
BUT It WORKS !!!
Unions
it works tho
Lol XD
Fake surely (I would hope)
Louis you're trending :D
I've been in the HVAC industry since 2002.  This was a hack job.  But in their defense it's a window unit, they don't make an after market drain pan for these units.  What did they charge ?    I would have installed a auxiliary condensate pump below it then ran the vinyl tubing to a downspout or corner to drain.  The purpose of an air conditioner is to remove humidity from a location.  The moisture leaves the evaporator coil and sent in this case to the condenser then flung into the condenser dropping head pressure and discharge temps.  Increasing efficiency whatever is left drips out.
Well, this is what happens when you go cheap. Rather pay an actual contractor or some guy who says he'll fix the issue? You're just a bigot blaming contractors, reminds me of someone who blames a whole group of people for something committed by an individual.
license and unlicense contractors. Don't hire a unlicensed contractor and bash real license contractor.
That's quite a liability having something THAT heavy sitting above a doorway
Awesome Lady, very creative of her !!!
I have no idea who that girl is but I really want to be her friend.
what a lovely video!! I'm sure you also made their day, thanks for spreading the cheer <3
Great idea, Great movie, Great song, you dance just great, your smile is great, you make ma and lot more smile and happy, so you are - great !
in Russia people would start to fight
is she single?  :) love from israel
Bravo! This video shows how much Iranians are into peace,, love and... Dance! Much respect for you Mahshid.
I was just in Charlotte. What really jumped out at me was how nice everyone was. Like weirdly friendly. This video validates it. I don't think there are many places where you would have success making this.
Yes! Can we be friends? I need someone like you as my travel partner... :D
damn that moonwalk was on point :D
Love this! And shout out to everyone for being a good sport
Wow!!! that's the spirit!!! can we be friends too please!? hehehe!!! :)
Haha, this made me smile. Thank you for that!
Another reason to like the CLT airport!  Besides the rocking chairs and Body Shop, apparently their employees have great rhythm.
isnt she afraid she might get stoned for this ?
I was just there!! CLT airport employees are super sweet and kind!  How fun and how cool is this girl?  You're a super-star Mashid Mazooji!  :)
You are so beautiful!

Btw you're blowing up on Facebook and Twitter

Why did u remove it ?? 😑😒
The thing I envy the most about your sister is the  ability to approach several strangers and ask them to do something fun with her. I feel like if I tried this it would go something like Hey, so I'm doing... a thing... nevermind. followed by running.
Home airport! Love this
Why is the video not available?
Best moves ever! Love it!
She is one attractive young lady..damn
Just awesome.
You can't not like this. Fabulous.
You had way more fun than I had the last time I was in Charlotte.
An entire crew of people need to do this that get cancelled for weather(airlines don't pay hotel  for weather)
I wanna do that...
This is GREAT!!! Love it.-j
love love love!!!  Thanks for making us smile in Charlotte!!
great way to pass time and make friends at the airport!
Hey, mad props! I often see fun dancing videos and think to myself it would be even more fun if they could actually dance. You definitely pass that test.
Wonderful! You and your new friends are great dancers
I love this girl's spirit!
Well done for such an entertaining vid  @0:49 Do like mummy and daddy version of joining in - even if didn't get out of their seat!  Betcha slept well when you did finally board your plane after all that dancing!
That was glorious!!!!  Well done!!!
And you can dance girl! Great bunch of worker/dancers too.
I enjoyed this video and OMG, you are also HOT!
amazing that's what I would do :)
this is such a fun video ahaha

This made me so happy! Next time I am faced with a challenging situation, I'm going to try and channel your energy!
Made my day. Awesome people - wish everyone loved each other like in this video.

You're so graceful, and what a cute video!!! Now I want to go to the airport and dance. ;-)
You are THE BEST.  Can't tell you how much this cheered me when I needed it - AND you are a great dancer!
The Quality of Our Lives Is Determined In The Quality of The Questions We Ask Ourselves and Others... Our Choices! ~ Choose Well My Friends! ~ It's NOT About What Happens To Us That Matters As Much As It Is What We DO About What Happens To Us That Counts! ~ Let's DANCE!
Hi.. what app did u use to create the video?
I was at an airport once for 24 hours - on Christmas Day - on the other side of the world - the person who was supposed to pick me up - didn't - was unreachable - glad you had a good time (seriously, this was awesome) I did not.
Great job taking a bad situation and making it fun that's soo cool 😊👍🏼👍🏼
That's awesome! Way to make the best of a bad situation :-D
hit that moon walk love the choice of deodorant lol
Great work Mahshid.  May I suggest changing the title to 'An Iranian Girl All Night at the Airport'? That may change the wrong negative image of Iranians around the world!!!!!
The moonwalk at 2:01
Dat Moonwalk though.
go to hell you foking bitch

Can't watch in Germany #warum?!?
iranian?
Although I don't believe the circumstances are true, this is a cool video.
WHO IS THIS IDIOT?  I’m sure she’s drunk and high on drugs
Yeah, the younger generation...\nHow about making dead sure you do NOT miss your flight instead? )))\nThey usually come to the airport a couple of HOURS before the flight, you know...\nОТВЕТИТЬ
What shoes are those? The nikes
looks like afrika...
Can Tom Cruise stay married?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure these aren't the Internet's most searched questions about Tom Cruise. These were handpicked and heavily filtered. This used to feature funny questions about the actors. Now its a borefest.
So let me just say what everyone's thinking; where's the question on Scientology?
Tom Cruise can do everything.
Nine can sound like Five on the radio especially if someone speaks fast or releases the mic key sooner than ideal.
how could  tom cruise fall in love twisted limbs airhead dumb boring , dull , no personality , no talent katie holmes what was he drinking like .  like i don,t get it he was paying her 3 million a years contract make no sense. they would have nothing in common what would talk about nothing . he actual fell in love obsessed fan airhead dumb failed actress  like holmes . what are the chances of him falling love with intelligent woman nil i,ll say , tom katie is dull boring no personality i don,t get what he saw her i really don,t make huge fuss over failed actress who is dull as ditch water. yeah the people he crazy stupid
There is not way people didn’t google “why is Tom cruise tooth in the middle of his face?” Or “why is Tom cruise so mess up?”
I didn't think the Scientologists let him out of his cryofreeze chamber
Is Tom Cruise full of himself?
OMG tom cruise, you guys should do an interview with keanu reeves, brad pitt, johnny depp, and RDJ too
can tom crui--\nyes.  the answer is yes.
I THINK THAT IM TOM CRUISE
What can Tom cruise not do is my question
The question should be Is there anything tom cruise cant do?
I can fly, ok. I can fly. Shut up.
Tom cruise can use an sd card for an iPhone ...
Well, he can't get out of a cult.
Who the hell is that guy on the right?
Did Tom Cruise punch Trump in the face?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes
Was wondering if they will ever get a director on Wierd.
He can do everything
Can Tom Cruise age?
Can Tom Cruise fly?\nYes
Love Tom Cruise!
we love you TOM
what can't he not do?
Someone just had some Botox. Maybe a facelift
Fuck you Tom Cruise. Go die in a Flaming fire. Scientology is a cult!
WTH! This guy can do anything!!! What can't he do should have been a question!
The most boring auto complete episode ever!
So nothing about him being trapped in the closet or his cult? Hmm🤔
say what u will but him. Tom Cruise is special!
Just my imagination or does Doug kind of look like a younger bill nye?
Can Tom Cruise stop scientology?\n\nHope he can do that too :)
It should be\n- Can Tom Cruise? \n-Yes
Is there anything tom cruise can't do? 😂😂😂😂
I mean, what can't he do? Tom is a legend.
Can Tom Cruise hold his breath for 6 minutes? No, he can't, because it's impossible... What a liar.
Can Tom Cruise ... ?\nYes, Yes he can do whatever u wanna ask.
This is a classic example of Tom Cruise controlling his own ridiculous and dying brand. None of the questions were complex in the least and basically pandered to his over-inflated ego. Yes , Tom Cruise, you're great at everything and you obviously need people to know all of your skills and need to flaunt them in a grotesque way like this. You are a faded, insignificant human whose sad need for self-gratification while seeming human is on display here. You're not Deadpool, man. nobody cares anymore and you verge on the immoral and illegal by being a deadbeat father Scientologist. The one thing you could do to impress me is leave that cult.
Numbers are pronounced slightly differently over radio in order to make sure there is no miscommunication of what is being said. Wun, too, tree, fow-er, fife, sev-en, ait, niner, ze-ro. \nSix sounds the same.
WAIT WHAT!  SO THAT WASNT HIM RIDING A FAKE PLANE IN TOPGUN!?!? Dam Cruise can do it all
What the fuck?\nTom does every thing :-(
Finally after all this years, Tom really look alittle bit old
Wow!
Can Tom Cruise fly dragons?\nTom Cruise: Yes. I actually own the three dragons you see in Game of Thrones
How is it possible that he gets more and more handsome!?! Geez!
Is there anything Tom Cruise can't do?? 😅
okay okay What Tom cuise can't do?  it would be better question LOL
Can Tom Cruise _show me da money?_\n..Get it?? ..You see, Tom did this movie (back in the day) called Jerry Mag - fuck it nevermind.
Tom can fly planes, helicopters-hang outside them, rock climb without gear, hold breath for 6min...\n*_IS THERE A THING THAT TOM CRUISE CAN'T DO!?_*
What the hell is wrong with Tom Cruise's face. People keep saying how young he looks, but it's not that...he looks artificial. Good looking Tom Cruise is gone forever!!!
These two definitely having sex. Often.
I bet they filtered out all the Scientology questions
niner world war ii was what i was told because you know german
Why is Doug Liman there lol. The poor guy didn't get a single personal question.
God, Tom still looks so hot..
The real question.....\n\nCan tom cruise, tom cruise?
Over the years I've come to hate Tom Cruise's face.
Tom cruise can do everything...
It's apparent His Scientology team made those questions for him.
What doesn't tom cruise do Jesus Christ
Tom Cruise can do anything I guess 😂
What a crock this is. You know scientologists and the freak that cruise is set up those questions: i want to be able to say Yes to everything thats asked.
One and nine can be confused I guess？
Why wasn’t there a question about Scientology??😂😂
Holy crap, what hasn't Cruise done/can't do? More respect to him.
What can't this man do???
These were softballs, half of them were Scientology related. Haha
Action isn't anything unless you have story and character. Amen, Mr Cruise
The one he threw away was about his scientology beliefs.
NO HUMAN CAN HOLD THEIR BREATH FOR 6 MINUTES!!!!!!
Yes but can you fly drones Tom that is the question\n\nalso why does Tom Cruise never talk to his daughter Suri? (scientology blah blah suppressive person)
Sooo do we still hate the guy or what?
Is Tom Cruise the leader of an evil cult called Scientology? Yes, yes he is.
How cool that he said YES to every freaking question!!! Love him ❤️
Pilots say niner to avoid confusion with the German for No.
Tom is always the top gun of Hollywood coz there is rarely anything he can't do.
Forget the Scientology stuff, Tom Cruise seems like one of the coolest people alive
I love the scientology-less version of Tom Cruise.
Jesus Christ, What can't Tom Cruise do?
i was like i bet he's gonna say yes to all the can tom cruise questions and he did! he's amazing
Dam what an interesting person
TOM CRUISE IS THE MAN!!
 Is Tom Cruise... PERFECT? \nYES HE IS
I mean, is there something this guy can´t do??!
This should be renamed Tom Cruise does it all
What?? Tom Cruise can do anything wtfff
Tom Cruise isn't human!
Superman !
No Scientology questions? Lol ok
Tom Cruise is Batman
Is that Data?
Tom cruise is a fuckin nut
S.C.I.E.N.T.O.L.O.G.Y.?
Tom cruise isn't human
Tom cruise: YES
I love Tom Cruise
tom cruise is dangerously charismatic

IM REWATCHING RIVERDALE
You are only *just now* making an effort to keep people from using Velcro as a generic word? Probably a little too late.
yeah good luck with that.  talk to Xerox
Hook and loop - 3 syllables\nVelcro - 2 syllables\n\nSorry, sticking with what's easier to say.
Funny video but I'm still gonna call it velcro lmfao
This video is clearly meant to be humorous and tongue-in-cheek. Nobody at Velcro thinks this video is going to change people's vocabulary.
I didn't even know Velcro was an actual brand till now.
It's funny I haven't seen Hoover make sarcastic youtube videos.
I'm still going to call it Velcro. And if that makes you cry, grab a Kleenex.\n\nNow where did I put my Vaseline...?
This is hilarious. I had to check to be sure, but I'll tell my customers we sell Velcro brand hook & loop. Or just Velcro for short.
The sneaker heads will be like\nAhhh he got the hook and loop\n\nSorry guys. Doesn't work.
velcro sounds better
lol this marketing is actually pretty good, it's just a hit or miss thing, next time just get a few bots to get that initial positive reaction so the community follows. or u know, hire me.\nanyway, peace.

How to backfire, John Oliver Style.
I love VELCRO® Brand hook and loop.
Not sure why everyone is so butt hurt. This is a clever and creative video with a hilarious message. I dig it.
Get better at marketing then??
Apparently people on YouTube are very bad at recognizing joke videos and picking up on when messages are tongue-in-cheek. How can you watch this and think Velcro is doing it in earnest?!
I wanna work there
My Velcro didn't hold up now I have to get some Kleenex and Clorox to clean the spill and probably use some Germ X after.
That's just glorious. Thanks for the link, Reddit.
Not only will I continue to call it velcro, but this song has further persuaded me to purchase non Velcro branded velcro.
It's too late. Velcro is already common parlance for that type of fastener. Just like band-aid, and kleenex are common parlance now. Give it up. And no one cares if your trademark goes away.
this was actually fun
I'm calling it velcro anyway just out of spite. That way, your trademark with dissipate as it becomes common name. Just like  all band aids are band aids, so now the brand has to call it band aid brand.
No worries guys, nobody even heard of you in Poland, there won't be any infringement.
Brilliant song, very catchy, well made point, very funny, and yet... it's still fucking velcro. The difference between Velcro (R) and velcro is the logo and the (R). If you didn't like it you shouldn't have waited 60 years to address the problem.
This is like trying to tell me Plato isn't a planet.
I actually love this! and the song is so catchy!
Comments are full of idiots who don't understand satire.
Guts, it's obviously a joke, calm down
This is one of the best things I have seen all week. I will try very hard not to call it &*^!@# and share this to anyone who will watch it on ... that social media site.
should call it ssrrcccctttccchhhh one word and its the sound it makes
Hook and loop? Nah, velcro.
overly expensive - generic velcro far more economical.
I suppose they want us to stop calling shirts with collars polos, referring to mopeds as vespas, and assuming all pregnancy pills are plan B also.
Can you guys just become a company that manufacturers music videos of interacial lawyers singing.
Inb4 video is deleted.  \n\nThis company that makes velcro has goofed up.
What if lawyers from companies all over just tried to get trademark laws changed to reflect the way that information spreads and adapts in a society with social media?\nThink it was bad before the internet?
Internet and people's mind 101: I don't tell people what you don't want them to do. Cause it's gonna be worst
Do people actually call bleach products Clorox? I've not heard it personally as common for bleach. The others? Sure
Velcro shoes is using it as an adjective, not a noun or verb. Editorial my friends, editorial.
Honestly you should called yourselves Hook and Loop so that you won't have to worry about that stuff
Saying, velcro shoes places the word velcro as an adjective. It describes the type of shoes as a noun modifier.
I'm going to find some off-brand velcro, and just stick it to things. I may the Hoover up the mess, when that fails, i'll go Google the way to do it properly. We don't get to decide how the world uses words, stop being a cuck about it.
It is and always will be velcro, no one would even know what I'm talking about if I said hook and loop get outta here.
Whatever the hell they were trying to do with this video, they failed.  Also, this message is at least 30 years too late to change how people talk.  Probably more.
I think I've just been velcroed...
from the same people who brought you the yo yo and the slinky
Ok so wtf is up with this INSANE 90s NOSTALGIA CRAZE and NO ONE has brought back blading or even talked about it? MAKE AMERICA SKATE AGAIN
Ok i got go now lemme get my velcro shoes and my velcro wallet and my velcro socks and my velcro car and my velcro jacket
Tell that to Hoover. :-)
Working as an aircraft mechanic, EVERYONE in the industry will call it Velcro, so it a WAY to late to change the naming
Okay okay I won't say it anymore!
Sorry, no one is ever going to call it hook and loop. Thats just reality
ok i wont, do I get a cookie
I found this hilarious lol\nUnsuccessful.... but still very funny
It is like Band-Aid too
0% chance of hook and loop taking off, but a damn catchy song nonetheless.
ok this was hilarious well done, from now on if i see it i'm saying  that fucking hook and loop
They are my velcro to the other velcro part....
Redditor and legal enthusiast here (I once beat Phoenix Wright Ace Attourney). These lawyers are right, it's wrong to use VELCRO® as if it were a common word. Social Justice has taught me that cultural appropriation is very real and harms creators of that culture. Therefore, we are appropriating the company culture of Velcro Brand Companies when we use VELCRO® outside of its intended legal context. Please refrain from velcroing this video with your ignorance.\n~Bertie Gallagher, moderator of r/legaladvice and r/INTELLECTUALPROPERTY, IQ of 172
lol why are so many people getting butthurt about this video. yall a bunch of virgins. thumbs up for pissin off reddit nerds.
kys
Velcro.
Self-qualified lawyer here. I absolutely *adore* this video, for it reinforces the belief that we should protect the very best of our society, including multi-billion dollar corporations. It's sickening knowing that people are appropriating VELCRO®, knowing fully they are diminishing the real brand. As an upstanding Redditor, I'll upboat this video for visibility, so reap karma VELCRO®, you deserve it.
omg ha
Velcro\n\nTrademark (TM) 2017 Velcro R company.
velcro
Velcro right?
Velcro for president
Dang. Velcro Lawyers harmonizing something fierce at 1:44
*Velcro.*
I'll stick to velcro..
Velcro.
VELCRO!
Maybe it would be cheaper to just give up the trademark.
No.
no
this is bad
If you own or work for Velcro you are making bank. This is how corporations control you. Slowly and surely.
justin mercado wasted the first comment, then edited it, then wasted second comment and edited that one too, then ten minutes later he came back and wasted third comment. Now I'm sitting here getting 5th when I should have 3rd.
And if you make a mess using Hook and loop remember to hoover it all up.
Marketing: We make bags, straps and bookends now. TIME FOR A REBRAND!
I just took time out from hoovering the inside of my JCB to google that. I was so distracted I walked straight into a dumpster, and  now I need a band-aid for the cut on my arm. I wiped some of it with a kleenex, and smeared some vaseline over it.
Hook and loop? Maybe if you had a shorter, catchier name for it we wouldn't have been calling it velcro to begin with. I'm not going to call it hook and loop.
I didn't waste my time watching the whole vid , or reading all the comments, but didn't you 'lawyers' steal this song?
sorry but your annoying bleep filled song isnt going to work. Its Velcro. Deal with it.
I don't care. It's called velcro no matter who makes it, just like band aids, roller blades, kleenex and myriads of other things.\n\nI will not let some corporate stooge tell me what nouns I should be using.
for doing this dumb video,  I will always call it velcro and I hope you lose your trademark
This video straight up made me cry for some reason. Like this is a hook and loop kicked in and I sobbed.
This video gives exactly the reason why to call it velcro in the first place. Trademarks are stupid. Nobody wants to make lawyers richer. As soon as you have an idea and share it, it should belong to the people. Making money off of an idea is wrong
Generocide is a thing layers.
Velcro
Can I replaced all my nouns with VELCRO®?
This is amazing! More name brands need to be like this!
I was with you until the censored swearing.  I would have shown my kids, so they could learn the right way, but you had to make it dirty.
I can't tell if this is supposed to be funny. But with so much going on in the world, and the local all-news station deeming this important enough to mention, all I can say is: Boo-Hoo! What problems we rich folks have to contend with.
Thanks for bringing him on great guest. I loved Home Improvement!
your 'god' is dead & no one cares
This week on norm MacDonald live. . . . O.J. Simpson!
I hate that mother fucker.  Biggest piece of shit who depended on funny people around him to carry all the weight while he sits and contemplates which cock to suck next.  Tim Allen and Norm were a great watch though.
all you assholesstop lying.  this was the worst ep ever because tim allan wouldn't shut the fuck up.  Norm was put in shackles by this fuck
The jokes are so bad ... did sjw write them. They are not sensical nor funny.
i love em both as comics, but when they started talking atheism, they had no idea what they were saying
Phony. He used the Lord's name in vain twice in the first 15 minutes.
good to see you both
These guys believe in God wholeheartedly, I want that faith like that
S A R A H S I L V E R M A N
I want to see Norm and Dave Chappelle. I want to see Norm and Bill Burr.
My parents are trying to give me cancer.
T-Shirt : Stalin was just as bad
I thought Tim Allen was dead. Is he still doing those santa films?
norm dropping the ball, it made me really sad.
Dawkins believes in no deity. Don't just read facebook memes. There are enough youtube videos of him speaking.
Tim's nice but just not that funny.
Why did we learn today? Tim Allen is a comedian.
When is Dennis Miller going to be on?
Hey Norm....keep carrying on the ''good works''.........
Tim sounded pretty intelligent until he said the whole there has to be a god in order for you not to believe in one... doh!
Tim Allen is awesome he accepts and laughs off his time in prison unlike Robert Downy Jr. who throws a hissy fit and walks out of the interview lol. The world knows you did the crime and spent the time. Might as well share your experience and bring to light the positives that happened from it to change your life for the better. In other interviews , Tim mentions how he found hope in his belief in god again to get him through time in prison and then persevere when he was out. I also loved Last Man Standing it was basically the conservative version of modern family except  the family in the latter was way more relatable to most middle class families then the former which seemed to embrace a lot of mainstream stereotypes. I can't believe Netflix would revive arrested development but not pick up LMS. And Tim is right Hollywood is so going rogue on openly conservative actors - his show which had great ratings and a loyal fan base gets nixed. Patricia Heaton's The Middle is now doing its final season. Jon Voight - who unlike Tim Allen openly campaigned for Trump looks like he's seeing his fantastic show Ray Donovan where he plays one of the main characters being steered towards its final season. If Liberals get rid of Ray Donovan, The Middle and LMS - then maybe Allen is right and Hollywood is trying to impose a Genocide of Conservative talent.
what a fuckin crybaby, partially redeemed by the blow talk at the end
i can see all of tim allens face\n\nwhat sorcery is this
so basically this guy is a dick
3:35 the look Kathy Griffin gives you when she says Im wet
I fucking love norm, just pure awesome and real
It bothers me what Adam doesn’t know about Chaplin’s mustache and movies in general
Nothing like watching aged white men bellyache about being chastised for harmful & obsolete views
I know that philosophy major.
Who's the fat douchebag? I'd like to punch him right in the fucking face .
Get Alex Jones on
Holy lord, this Tim Allen guy has a mighty high opinion of himself!
This was why I love this show. Another classic.
Who is Adam Eget? Every time this happens on the show I actually feel for the guy a little more.
I have yet to hear an Atheist say It's all an accident \nMagic man done it!
I think Norm's A bird's not covered till 26 was lost on a lot of ppl xD LOL
Egret would like to sing Blue Velvet
Profound.
Congratulations to Adam Eget for improving. I actually laughed a few times at stuff he's said. It all seemed not on purpose, but maybe it was, I'll give it to him. Tim Allen was an ok guest. Absolutely love Steve O'Donnell. Did they ever explain what he was doing in front of the cameras though?
Last man standing is a good show & it's a shame it was cancelled!!!
58:50 oh man
Where can I buy Adam's Blue Velvet shirt!?
There has to be a Russell's teapot for Tim Allen to not believe in.
Hey Norm using union labor for your set? That table bouncing around is so annoying and I am not even sitting at it.
I wish Randy Savage had lived long enough to be on this show.  Would have been fascinating.
This interview gives the impression that Tim Allen might be a little dim, at least in certain areas.  Not focused or rational.  Not a truly deep thinker.  I'm neither fan nor detractor.  I like GALAXY QUEST and TOY STORY.  But Mr. Allen seems either bored or limited during much of this episode.
For info, last man standing discussion starts at 34:45 :-)
I'm wondering what the hell happened before the last break. Seems like they pointed out the yawning thing and things got tense. Seemed like he really wanted to leave and Norm attacked him for it. Then the Candy Man stuff. Then Tim Allen retaliates with the small cameras comment.
Has anyone explained why I'm sitting here? Steve O'Donnell looking a bit befuddled 56:52
plz c if u can get dick van dyke ! He is a forefather.  Maybe not a stand-up,But a comedian nunthaless. If u can give us bruce jenner barf ! U owe us that. 🎥
Norm's still got it.
tim allen's a bit of a dick
Had no idea Tim Allen was this funny and witty
I've been a Norm MacDonald fan for many years. Had the pleasure of seeing him live in the Tempe Improv. I suppose Adam Egret was working there back then.\n\nTim Allen has never once made me laugh.
What an enormously and profoundly stupid fellow (Tim Allen, that is)
Another fantastic show. The joke section is back and it's great!
One of your worst interviews Norm.
SHE WAS A HOOKAH!!
Bring back Otto and George.
Amy Schumer steals her jokes and gets rich is that FAIR?
34:15 THE santa clause holy shit what a blast from the past
Too much joke analysis, brother. Just read em, like everyone else. Trust us...we get Norms humor.
Staring at 1:00:13 Adam Eget makes a joke that was three years in the making
Tim Allen looks like a 50 year old Dave Faustino
six-hundred and fifty grams of ideas
Once in a while I catch Norm burping on the podcasts. Cracks me the fuck up! https://youtu.be/WYkil1tblt8?t=2780
man i love every episode but the best are when jokes is the guest actually having fun.  or norm having fun.  this time was both.  great discussion and awesome end.\n\nalso laughed my ass off that tim answered where do you get your ideas and they skipped like 2 or 3 break attempts
Tim Allen:  Who is Adam Egert?  -  haha, truer words were never spoken
All great comedy hosts have the laughing jack ass side kick \nAlthough they all don’t jerk off punks underneath the bridge like eget
LOL, there's not a chance in hell Tim Allen was ever paying a 50% overall tax rate as a nightclub comic. He's funny but also a goddamn moron.
finally a good one
Aw man, what happened to the super zoom independent French cinematographer?
this dude said ppl dont like trump cuz of how he looks lolllllll
Constant yawning.
Great show,Norm.
Dat blue velvet t-shirt.Nice adam.
Red Wings hat? Seriously? You douchebag, traitor, wet-back mutha fuker! lmao\nGreat show fellla!
Holy Shit
who's Adam Eget?
Tim is an unfunny hacky comedian
Buuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrp[
Please get Martin Short.
H3 Podcast unintentionally brought me here
Hey Mr. Candyman.... my nose is empty!\n\nLOL!!!!
Caulk not Chaulk.
Go Wings!
Allen was/is an underrated standup
Does Norm like Hitler, or does he find him to be a bit of a jerk?
Lost me on the religious BS
Norm has had a lot of great guests since he started this, but none better than Adam Eget. Actually, Gilbert Gottfried  and Tim Allen about the best. Gottfried was totally unexpected and Tim Allen was to be expected. As I write this, I can think of about 5-6 more great guests he's had. However, it all comes back to Adam Eget. Love the guy.
The longer I watch this show, the more I realize Norm and Adam are way funnier than any guest
I never thought Tim Allen was dumb. Guess I was wrong. He said what has government done for me?! 😮
Gods will is an invitation each day to do the right thing.  He doesnt intervene in the affairs of men. YOU have to enjoy and fill your own self with the benefits of Gods will.  Going to bed at night with nothing of drama waiting for you in the morning.  Wow.  Feel that.
Norm's silly little internet talk show is providing yet another shining example of why mainstream network television doesn't get it, sucks ass and needs to die. This was brilliant. Good guest, great laughs as usual. Norm is a natural in this setting. Interesting topics. Why isn't this on a network? Glad it's on Youtube for free anyhow. Buy some flowers yah fuckin' cunts.
A few years back, an accretion of calcium formed in one of my kidneys and eventually made it's way through my urethra and out the end of my knob. That experience was not as painful as these 2 guys playing mental ping-pong over atheism, a subject they clearly do not understand.
I used to hate Tim Allen, cause his comedy was blain, but now he looks better as he ages and he stopped giving a fuck what the public thinks of you. which is the best comedy
Thank you, Norm, for having the great Tim Allen on your show. Very refreshing that you took a break from the progressive fruitcakes, transgender queens and bull dyke lesbians.
Gotta remember these guys like Tim Allen needed a lotta cash to keep up his homes, cars (and a hell-ova lot of em!) I mean who that was born say in the 1990's ever really heard of Tim?Example: In 25 whos ever going to really remember Sandler? And thats fuckin sad! Robin-Will, dying the way he did and a perfect example of what I'm tryin to say! Prob. couldn't perform or even go on stage without the drugs?? Don't really know but my fav of all time comedy/drama/ or dramedy; the f-in best out there in my opinion!

Clicked on this faster than I blinked
I was singing Christmas carols in the school lunch line today 👍👍🤶🎅
SUCH AUTUMN VIBES 😍😍😍
You're right to worry Zoe, I've had fleece sheets before... never again! That being said, I'd still use the main sheet from the set as a minimalist duvet in the thick of winter! It looks good with a fur throw, but has to has cooler sheets underneath...!
You're actually the bestest
I wish the video was longer!
Quante cose belle!! A D O R O 😍😍😍
Awww Gabriella has the same peach bedding ❤️😘
yip another good show they have so much material they can use trump is just brilliant for SNL
This SNL woman in red is much more attractive then the REAL fat-ugly Sarah Huckster!! She's so damn DISGUSTING!
I enjoy Baldwin's Trump but this one kinda fell flat.  Better luck next week.
Garbage! Like everything Hollywood does lately. I'm sick of the crap politics! Grow up libturds!
The WORSE part is that this is ACTUALLY HAPPENING  !!!
Alec Baldwin is such a cuck. What a son of a bitch mocking the greatest president in USA 🇺🇸 history.
This is not funny
This would be funny 10 years from now. They're losing the integrity it takes to be funny... I've loved SNL my entire life , but what am I suppose to think when they open last year with Kate playing piano crying about H losing in a serious way, and then joking now about lost life in Puerto Rico or anywhere else right before them.  Comedy IS funny because it's true, but only if it's over...
Hello everybody want to get free stuff download Verydice and start rolling use my code 1177158
Im done with SNL! I'm worn out by AB and rest of the crew..
You FEAR the tweets don't you !
Sub to me and I'll sub to u just comment done swear I will
I think it's great that this video is #1 on trending. Trump must be feeling shit hahahah
THIS VIDEO IS LIT *FAM*
when will people get tired of this trump shit its really repetitive
What's happening in Puerto Rico
This is an amazing impersonation
Check out DJ Zach Kuhn and DJ Quamise Carter doing a dubstep dance to the Cash Me Ousside Remix \nYou Don't Want To Miss It!
Maybe that fat girl should lose about 60lbs before trying to impersonate the press sec..... or she can just roll her ass to Canada for all I care
Alec, you are the man!  Keep up the hilarious Trump impersonations.  That imbecile is going to give you plenty of material over the next few years!
Jews want to kill all white people and the remaining brown people will be their slaves
SNL is misogynist for exaggerating Sarah's weight. Not funny dudes.
I LOVE HOW DONALD TRUMP COMES OFF LOOKING SELF-RIGHTEOUS ABOUT RACISM WHEN HE ATTACKS NFL BLACK PLAYERS.
With fishies and bubbles and turtles that bite 😂😂😂😂😂
Alec Baldwin is such a jerk off..
Was about to vote Hillary for 2020 but I went to San Francisco, nice geography, stupid people, ridiculously overpriced due to high population, muslims (and I know not all muslims want to stay in Islam), and white people who will cus me out for saying nigger even though all the black people just ignore me. Also fook Cali, I'ma live off on ramen in Texas in a nice house for cheap price in normal US standards.
As a matter of fact I am getting tired!!!  But I  have not lost my faculties . Trump is not the answer..
While you ass holes watch this ass hole.. there is a active shooter at a concert in vagas.. \n\nIt's time for the division to stop.. so that adults can make this country a less violent and more prosperous place to live.
Trump is jesuit agent  he's just a puppet
once every once in a blue moon snl makes a good skit
OMFG.. who's doing the subs for these?  They're WAAAY off!!  Thema?!  Don't you mean FEMA?  Or Docks?  Don't you mean DACA?  Do you guys even know what' was in the script?
Baldwin can suck my dick like the cute fag he is. Open wide Alec!\nThere's a choochoo coming in... lol look at that big smile.
God is good and loves us all please people don't let CNN MSNBC SNL and crazy demon crap libtards brain wash you!
ha ha the only time I enjoy watching stupid Donald Trump great job Alec Baldwin😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jeff Sessions is half human, half Dobby the elf.
Too many women on SNL. You need more male actors. It's not funny anymore when women play as men.
It's funny and sad at the same time.  Should I laugh or cry?
Sad is that SNL show, dig the Trump show!!!!
Market up length cancer tuck dream may never reach locate.
Baldwin's impression is the only good thing to come from Trump being president.
I support Trump and I don't find this offensive I just don't find it very funny. Don't burn me at the stake for this I just thought the singing Trump from agt was a much better Trump parody
I'm surprised this video doesn't disable comments and ratings, as most new age liberal videos seem to do. At least they (SNL) leave room for all opinions and trumptards. Most would just disable ratings and comments due to hate speech and other things of the like.\n\n\nRegardless of political affiliation, do you think this kinds of thing would have been acceptable during the Obama presidency? (On this large a scale of course. Like, every week on the same show type of scale.) I dunno. I have a feeling they'd be either told to stop or widely condemned by mainstream media, regardless of content. It's interesting to see how things truly don't work both ways.\n\n\nAlso the comments...yeebus...\nNot only is it people just posting things like fuk trump bruh for likes and not to start an actual discussion. (Obviously this isn't a political forum and it isn't trying to be, nor do I even expect it here.) But, I find it interesting that not even a year into his presidency people say things like He's the worst president of all time. When they can name about 5 presidents total (Obama, GW Bush, Reagan, Nixon and JFK) and they only know what they've been told from biased sources. Off the top of my head, U.S. Grant was shit, Taft was shit, Eisenhower really wasn't great, W Wilson really was kinda shit....\n\nAh, who am I kidding. Nobody will actually read all of this comment, they'll just read the first paragraph and leave a reply like Stfu Nazi or such gems as You're some kind of Russian spam bot, comrade as if I'm even coming to the man's defence. Plot twist, I'm actually not. I'm just saying you should at least give the poor fucker a chance regardless of what you hear from your university teachers and friends/social media about the current administration. Do research. Formulate your own opinion. Don't just blindly follow media outlets, regardless of their affiliation. \n\nYou're actually comparing someone who hasn't had a chance to really do anything yet to someone who failed to intervene in a timely fashion on WW1 and cost the world millions of lives that didn't need to be lost, or that tried to suppress women's rights protestors for the sake of their own beliefs and a backwards nation's belief. I mean, until he really, really, really fucks up, why are people acting like he's already been the worst president ever? Well, probably because it's what they saw on MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, read on twitter or saw on SNL.\n\n\n\nFor those who got the the end, good on you. You actually read what I have to say and realize I'm advocating for political awareness, and am trying to deconstruct the mob mentality and way that these new age liberals handle politics.\n\nI'd pour you a drink, but sadly the Internet has only come so far at this point.
Before all said and is done the evil will be destroyed and anyone who joins them will go to hell just the same.. know that just like the Jew lead blacks into wanting to gangbang sell drugs and kill' through paying some big money to shuck and juvie' like NWA 2pac chef keef JayZ and many others' who chose to lead there people into the dark' for a life of riches' based on lies and destruction of there own people'..yup he would know that the honest pro whites are exposing the mass control the Jew has in media Hollywood and collage university's .. and he would know that the Jews are using the blacks to try to choke out the white mans truth because he is trying to wake everyone up to the false reality' that  is being drilled into your mind-all day everyday..
This is why The Alt-Right exists. Remember when SNL was funny?
Btw if your seeing all these comments talking about the “triggered trump supporters,” go look in the comments that reply to the people bashing trump
Donald trumps face is never that pink
THIS OFFENDS ME. TAKE IT DOWN. Respect our president!
TRUMP 2020!!! It was so good to see you babies crying back in NOV and are still crying like babies still.
Cannot stand this Baldwin......he is stuck on himself....
I support trump, and I don't find the skit offensive at all...I wish it is funnier though.
This has been washed up useless no talent actor Mr Baldwin is a BIG piece of shit for disrespecting our president Donald Trump fuck you Mr Baldwin I hope you die of prostrate  cancer cuz it's just like you a disgusting  disease like all liberals you should ALL DIE !!FUCK ALL LIBERALS  !!!

Pretty sure some dislikes are going to be ommited like Hillary's whuuaat hhaaappened???? Book reveiws.
8k people need to lighten up and grow a sense of humor.
I would find this hilarious if there was actually a conservative tv show or conservative talk show.

This shit is really getting old.
These fucking late night TV show preppy, rich, liberal assholes should understand that half of America is sick of your snobby, stuck up, condescending bullshit fake news. He sent 1million of his own money for aid and IS helping Puerto Rico despite what this fake news tells you and your Golden girl Hillary hasn’t done shit
SNL hasn't been funny since the 70's
SNL needs to do their homework. The mayor and the unions are blocking fema from  entering the ports
Why is the actress who plays Sarah so fat? She’s curvy but Definitely not a complete fatass like this Ugly bitch! Hahahaha
Apparently everyone like to be abused.
I hope he's okay.
Daym, he got triggered
Gods way of saying you haven't been relevant in 20 years.
It is first on trending but youtube says 2nd on trending. WTF
Let's just pray he crushed his vocals
They're jammin' out at hammerstein,\nHe climbed a ladder then got pinned,\nStupidest stunt in mankind,\nThe ballroom prop.
Was that paul from the wonder years?
Horrible what happened. But honestly who would want to watch that overweight, drunk guy stumble around the stage and lip sync his songs?
They always told me guns can kill, but this is ridiculous!!!!
i feel bad for laughing but then again, i don’t.
Which I could be some small 60 subs channel with #2 in tending....
As if that is finishing the contract with him from below and comes to ask his soul.\nPoor man, may God have mercy on his soul.
Tbh the way it falls over - him falling over first and that the thing is so light it wouldn't surprise me if this was set up, especially given his reputation.
Marilyn Manson finally learns the awesome potential of heavy metal.
he pulled it down on himself on purpose.
Well justin beiber did say he would make him relevent again.
Duct tape didn't work this time
Hammerstein... it is kinda in the name!
Only like a couple of his songs , and a lot of people say he’s weird , what is weird ? He’s not doing anyone any harm
This version of the song sounds very depressing
The prop couldn't take anymore of his dreary vocals
the one who did not mount that prop so stiff would like to be fired
Just watched another video and he was pulling on it.... his own fault
Shame it didn't kill him.....
Some of them just fall on you...?
See America... Guns hurt people
Gun stage props are dangerous.......we should ban gun stage props in America........
Maybe it  happen for a good reason. FUCK TRUMP!!! FUCK EVIL SPIRIT!! GADAM DEVIL!!
Ahem.. play this and look the video again with no sound. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i0TnNI6U-w

I hope he will die

A publicity stunt to promote new album. Guns made of styrofoam
The guy shouting pussy seems like a twat
Fat occultist bastard pmsl
guns are dangerous....
DT is right - Same shit different season
When are arsenal fans going to understand that arsenal is a mid table team glory days are over
Why interview a moron? Couldn't give a toss what he thinks. Whinging bloke can't even speak English, I'm embarrasssed for him.
Am i the only one who cracks up when i see the view count that aftv have when arsenal wins and then compare it to when arsenal loses? Lol
C'mon DT just chill man. Every team has problems. I know Arsenal have been playing some shocking football, but can't blame the defence all the time. Look at Real Madrid today. They won 2-0 but Espanyol had 2-3 really good chances. I know that you had enough of poor Arsenal, but start supporting the team rather than critizising their every mistake.
They could have had this they could have had that... could have and should have are two different things!! Are you forgetting that arsenal also hit the bar and had more chances in this game?? Think you need to stop being a pessimist and support your club.
well said DT. today's game was just too slow and not scoring the needed goals
DT is right on the money... except for the contradiction regarding the squad making progress. If we have the potential to compete for top 3 then that's clearly progress compared to previous analysis stating we probably won't make top 4. \nI'm Still #WO (since '08)
Alexis is the number one arsenal
Didnt know why iwobi was in the background.
Sorry but arsenal fan tv would not be the same if you won the league and cups because DT n Troopz wouldnt be mad. Love there reactions 💯👊🏼
Ramsey and Giroud totally overrated! There is more goals in Wilshire and Walcott at the moment!
While the Manchester clubs and Spurs are banging 4 against so called lesser teams, we are just about scoring 2 and riding our luck. Bigly. \n\nWe need to sort this defence and also get Sanchez, Laca and Ozil playing together. That front three could do wonders for us this season and when Jack gets in (if he can keep this form), our midfield can be way more creative than the staleness we are witnessing now. \n\nBut much of this wont matter if we dont sort this defending out. Wenger should try 4 at the back and see how we play. Its been a while but I think we'd be more solid.
Riding our luck Our xg was 2.9, Brighton's was 0.4. DT is a complete moron
I never even knew Alexis had haters he holds are team on his back he is Arsenal.
Give Aresnal team some credits pls... as for DT .. I dun know who u are... but seems like you are nothing but a very negative person.
I think Alexis, maybe because they both speak spanish, has a better understanding with Monreal than with Kolasinac, on that left side. Hopefully with more matches Alexis and Kolasinac can get a better undrstanding and improve each other performances , because Kolasinac is a beast, and Monreal is having a amazing season in his new position so i wouldn't change there positions.
Why is this even a topic. Laca should have played sanchez in for a tap in !!
This is actually trending. DT one of the best personality on AFTV
Arsenal should of won 5,6-0
People forget Alexis had some very rough international games where he lost the confederations cup and then lost 2 games (qualifiers). He´s got a lot in his head at this point, not only Arsenal, and this is not to make any excuses, but come on, those fans giving him shit... they should be bothering the board to get rid of Wenger and the lazy players, instead of bothering the only guy that gave everything for his team last season.
Robbies just thinking about how he's getting to Ibiza next week, by his private yacht or his private jet?
i like you DT but do you ever say anything positive
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
DT is definitely the realest amongst all the other AFTV regulars. He may be biased towards some players but he lenient towards them when they’re shit. I like him better now than when he was all “Wenger Out”.\n\nNot saying that Wenger should stay beyond the 2 years though. ;)
Always in with a chance when it’s 11 v 11, so keep Ozil out and get him out ASAP. Alexis is a done deal- he will sign for another club in January and then maybe people who are fooling themselves that he might stay will see.
These arsenal fans are never happy
Why has Dt got his ears tucked in his hat🤔😱
this is shit we want Arsenal loose so they can bitch wenger out
does anyone else think that robbie looks like a teletubby?
ArsenalFanTV is boring at the moment
DT is the man!
Fans are fully entitled to boo people who don't want to be at the club
What’s iwobi doing in the back
What's David Alaba doing there?
how was it shit. we weren't just clinical but we won anyway. stop putting these retarded fans and put fans who actually know about the game. brigton form has been great too. they aren't just some small team who you can beat 6-0 or 4-0.

DT is spot on, it's all pampering cracks until we play City and Spurs.
Dt out poster at home any one 😂
I wanna talk about the game\nAlright tell me about the game\nIt was shit.
I was at the game today. Let's face it, we've won and that's it. Maybe we shouldn't complain when the boys have obviously done enough to succeed.
The chap dead centre is sturridge and oxdales love child
If Alexis plays 2 bad game then DT will lash out at him &  Troopz will call him a Ham roll. Arsenal fans 😕🙍
We want 3 point not Good to Play
Is that ox Chamberlain with a tan in between Robbie and Dt lol
Another good result today.  Lacazette should have been kept on though.
Watford 0-5 Arsenal\nDT: we should have beaten them 6-0!\nHe's always negative😂
”We dont win the games we should be winning”\n\n”Its only games we should be winning”\n\nNever happy.
Think your having a bad day. DT is always having a worse day.
Please like this so Robbie sees!! The fans today were f***** embarrassing. With such a huge audience now arsenal fan TV Should try and help with this in any way possible or at least address the issue. Please this club needs some passion at home. We blame the players for putting in performances that lack passion and fight but the fans have no passion at all. RANT OVER
Iwobi played and came out to watch arsenalfantv interviews....respect
Chill DT. If we're just pampering over the cracks playing the lower teams, then what state is ManU in?? They're top of the league when they only played the weaker teams. Yea they're killing games off but they'll be shell shocked when they play a top 6 side like Liverpool next week
Level with Chelsea. Liverpool are shit so 4th spot could be yours...or not
DT is spot on, we've been shit for 85% of our games this season. As he said we'll see after our next 3 games, but for me, I don't think we look any better than last season.
Give it a f..g rest. Where did this bloke come from all of a sudden. A bloody no one and no brain to match.\nThrow a penny in his dumb hat and walk on.......he's enough to give anyone the DT's.
He has a point
Mr attention seeker. I didn't see it
I will always belong to this family
I hope you're dream comes true my dream is to get 100 subscribers by the end of the month can you please help me with my dream?!!
Once we  start playing the ball sideways it is Xhaka's role to collect the ball and spread the ball to the right forward. When the game gets boring we should blame him, he is our engine at the same time passing the ball sideways can be a way to rest after running so much and try to pull the opponents. #wearethearsenalfc
Btw.. I heard that Carlo A. Wants the arsenal job !! \nAnd cante wants to leave Chelsea after this season !!\nAny thoughts ????
Again DT is absolutely right! Arsenal progress with frail teams but crumble ever so easily against big and technically strong premier league clubs. If Arsenal beat Any of the top 6 teams away the same way we beat lowly rated clubs in the premiership, then the world can take our title credentials very serious, as it is there's no amount of points you can amass from smaller clubs that can justify winning the premier league trophy.
Arsenal is shit end off.
hey robbie id like to know if you will be going to the world cup next year, i think it would be cool if you go along with the aftv boys(troopz, dt etc.) like if you agree
Did anyone else notice the Brighton fan in the background? 😂
Big up to DT, always tell the truth
Lacazette: Unlucky to hit the post\nGiroud: He's shit, he shoulda scored\n\nAlexis: World class assist\nRamsey: Decent assist
Love winning games when we are poor! We kept the clean sheet!
Channel built on negativity. Wins = No views
These football fans are so retarded it's like your team has earned hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds and they were paid £100,000 but you're going to sit there or stand there like an absolute little b**** I moan about it
dt is spot on
Alexis is just getting back to full sharpness. Liking the use of two teams, should be putting everyone into good form.. hopefully
We won but we need to punished these small teams like the other big teams other wise go gunners back again big up DT an troopz
Schanez want to play but can't be bothered. Should have celebrate with iwobi
I'm sure this DT guy, is convinced he could be the manager of Arsenal.
Look over DT's left shoulder at the red head.. What's that hooped earring about😂 looks like captain hook
I honestly don’t understand when this man says we were passing the ball side ways wdf it’s football you’re not always gonna attack it’s called build up play 😕
Theese man suck off Alexis, him & Ozil top players but becoming a problem.
Get well soon to your son DT
I would rate DT 4 out of 10
I am a Manchester United fan, but you just gotta love ArsenalFanTv. Troopz, DT, Kelechi and company. These are really passionate fans and they make this channel such a pleasure to watch. Funny guys who give you the perfect balance of pessimism, optimism and realism. Arsenal is a top team but team selection is always going to hinder progression because naturally gifted players like Wilshere are unused. Arsenal is a passing team and the combine this with great pace and good combination play. If Wenger played Wilshere, Ramsey, Özil, Sanchez and Lacazette in one team, I think we will the true Arsenal. There will be smart enough players who pass well, can keep possession and are creative enough to dismantle any defense... Luckily for me as a Manchester United fan, Wenger is going to play Xhaka and Elneny... Hahahahahahahahaha!
Vibes
Treatment for whitpatches
FELLANI > LACAZETTE
DT is very childish!
Anyone? Did anyone forget that Arsene wenger should sacked?
This wannabe fat gangster is never happy
What is Iwobi doing at AFTV ?
DT is clueless.
et-e-ad
Best speaker on AFCTV @DT
DT is never happy
Yo
ARSENAL!!!!!!!
Facts.
My name is Alexis, loooooooooool
UNITED IS GONNA WIN THE LEAGUE!!!!!
I used to be a Spurs fan and been a Gooner since 2015. I have to admit our Fantv is boring when we win games.
I swear DT jinxed Arsenal when we start winning games and go on a run he gets negative and we tremble it's like the players watch arsenal fans tv or something
alexis: great player but open your eyes DT alexis anit finding lacca
Adam's cute 😏
Not a tattoo gun its a machine
Leviticus 19:28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the Lord.
Who's that older guy I've seen him before but I can't quite figure out who he is
he wasn't considering if he wanted the tattoo. he was thinking how do I get out of this...
What a hot prod staff guy
What if his foot was smelly?
would kill to let margot robbie touch my feet 😍
I bet that guy had a full-blown stiffy by the end of that..... i know I did😓😓😓
I'd get that tattoo no problem by Margo!
Get a tattoo from Margot Robbie on a popular TV show sitting next to Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Gosling, and Harrison Ford. Check.
Please know that JESUS LOVES YOU, JESUS IS LORD, AND JESUS FORGIVES. We are all sinners. We are all on our way to hell, forever. God does NOT want us to end up in hell, a place of eternal, conscious torment and suffering (Not parties). We can all live in eternal paradise with no pain and no suffering forever. It’s one place or the other. Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ Jesus took our punishment for our sins. This is a FREE gift. Many will never know how wonderful a relationship with Jesus is because they are afraid to ask. Try asking. What do you have to lose? Just ask Jesus into your heart and to forgive your sins. It literally costs you nothing, but will give you everything. God Bless.
Yoooo that thumb nail looked like she had no arm
Wouldn't be surprised if that got infected. She didn't wipe down or sanitize the area before tattooing
The look of sheer terror on Harrison Ford's face when he KNEW he was going to be singled out.
I'm a simple man, I see Margo Robbie, I click
Have I seen that Adam somewhere before???
Id let her tattoo my toe just so she can touch me. ID ask if i could put my big toe in her mouth as well
I'm willing to get a tattoo from her, even though i hate tattoos...\nThat's how much i love her! 😍
I'd pay alot of money to get a toe tat by that sexy beautiful creation of the gods, Harrison Ford!
Low class, tacky, sure signs of lowlife losers. I wouldn't get a tattoo if my life depended on it. And if a girlfriend of mine came home with one she can leave and try to be a girlfriend of someone who's equally as skanky.
This is cringy to watch XD
https://youtu.be/uc6eI3GqNpQ     🔥EGO🔥 is the NEW 2018 HIT !!
As a tattooer, I want to die watching this
She's the megan fox of this era :3
Is this a toetoo or a tattoe?
Lol check out my latest Pokémon go video would really appreciate it lol thanks so much
so many cringey brain dead people will copy this now.

Ryan Gosling is wearing the exact same thing he wore during his SNL monologue yesterday...wtf?
They’re still talking about suicide squad??!?
Imagine telling the story at the pub about the time margot robbie tattooed my toe

Witherspoon is cranky because she's Margot outshines her.
Tobias Menzies
Stupid
Damn that made for some awesome ASMR\n\n:(
Margot Robbie is so adorable.
THIS IS DOPEEE 🔥😂
Adam is lucky af
Margot Robbie=yummy!!

satan  show the cross on the hear... the devil it's inside.
Welcome to our new channel \nGive us some advice,thx
4:17 Harrison's arm and hand just came out of nowhere
I've never wanted a tattoo, but I would let Margot Robbie tattoo me anytime she wants.
Kurt cobain should get all the credit...
Look at Reese Witherspoon ( the lady beside Margot Robbie) at 1:12😂😂
God I love her 😍
I'm so in love with this woman it's not even describable by words...
The best set of guests love it great amazing entertaining
I would do this but only so I could say I was tattooed by Margot Robbie
''hang on, that's acting.''
Check out our new fashion store\nlliparkes.myshopify.com
Margot Robbie is just so unbelievably sexy. What a woman. Cute beyond belief.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
Suicide squad was a mistake
Awful jacket right there, looks like he's been hosed down 😂
Margot is one of the most gorgeous women I have ever seen!
Margot and Gal Gadot are in a heated battle for my 'Hottest Actress in the World' spot.
I would get that in my toe
So professional, she calls it a gun, and not a machine.
She is so fine!!
Reese’s RBF??!! 😩😡🙄
Reese Witherspoon looks like a concerned mum
This was hilarious
MARGOT ROBBIE IS BAE😍😍 OMG JUST TAKE ME
2:58 jealous Reese Witherspoon
she's soooo FINE.
I let her suck my 👣
Margot Robbie 😍
OMFG FEET ARE DISGUSTING, but mine are beautiful 😚
It's a tattoo machine not a gun. I would not consider myself to be lucky to be tattooed by her. I am a professional tattoo artist for 13 years now. I have 2 small beginner tattoos and that's it. If your artist says they are shaky but love doing them......Find another artist!!!! I don't care how hot they are or their celberty status.
greg was really hard to beat, I got my older brother to do the level for me
I LOOOVE YOU OH MY GOD
you posted again?????? are you feeling okay????
That is both hilarious and brilliant at the same time! Bravo! 😂
I really wish there was a full version of the final boss theme
your face is accurate to how we feel for these... I LOVE IT  like a budget agent 47
is that start sound from dino crisis 2 ?
Watching your videos at 2 am makes them 10,000x funnier
Just to be clear im here b4 he blew up
I love the one frame that's basically just a don't sue me frame with reggies face
Please,,, clean your house up I’m bbEGGING YOU\nYou’ve been there for a month
gimme a full version of the fire level prease i need it
Hahah, I remembered all at once: Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana...etc types :) - Nice One!
honestly? I'd play this game.
Which game is he makin a parody of this time??
You all may think this is a joke but little did you know he’s releasing the soundtrack for a future game in development (jk I don’t have a fucking clue)
The boss phase music is pure art.. I love it ...
Okay, so, I thought for a while that his 64 was sitting on the ground, and couldn't get over the immense size of that console. I was wrong.
_how is this an improvement from the last one?? The last one was perfection but somehow this is even better??? I love you???_
This is my kind of quality content. Especially the crying. That one really got me.\n\n\n\n\n...cause I can relate. ;u;
Your interpretations are so good, that it makes actual video game music seem fake.
Yessss some quality music and editing
Two videos in a month?!
Can u make a full version of all ur game music for itunes pls?
Great job with the Closed Captions.. too funny
The racing one reminded me of Sonic Riders so much for some reason
Can someone loop the racing mini game part?
i watched this for the beautiful face
So who else is destroying their space bar and/or mouse trying to pause and read all the text AND the subtitles?
Seth is already in 3017.
*SECRET TIP* : You complete the game by winning
Took me a while to realize that his sweater didn't say anus
You're wearing the same damn sweatshirt that you wore in the first one....\n\n\n\n+1 for continuity
i thought his shirt said anus
This video is a whole different experience if you only watch Seth's eyes and brow movement.
I need the full version of the fire level song
The tutorial theme is actually really nice
air level reminds me of something like yoshi village
I'm a straight male and I want to marry you.
These videos you make, they give me life dude.
You are my god
I wish this video never had to end and the player keeps dying, keeping us in this endless limbo of dope ass game music with some loveable jackass who keeps staring in to our soul.
Id totally buy the fire level theme
What's the music at the very end??
This man is my spirit animal.
I love the water level song on the final boss song.
This sounds like something that would be in a Legend of Zelda video game.
I wonder how long he'll be able to keep up this insane video a month thing
Still wish he would do a full version of the water level from his first vid of this
someone should make an avatar amv to this
although video game 2 had pretty graphics, video game had a better soundtrack
Love the the end music callback
What song in the end?
The 'Final Boss' part would have been better if you played just the 'fire theme' as background.
If I become a game dev, I hope we can get your music on the game!
I've awaited this moment for so long
ok but Air Level is where it's at....
are you ok, just checking on you <3 you only seem slightly dead inside
literally all i could hear was Legend of Zelda
you should do a collab with Kmac2021 pls
Air level is lit
not any youtube video will ever be this relatable\n\nfelt the same emotions as if I was actually playing, such masterpiece
Too good. Stop it.
turn on subtitles and thank me later
What sample was used for *YOU PRESSED START* ?
The passion he expresses, the emotion in his eyes as he slaps the keyboard...
Such A Serious Face 😂
But i like water levels
Why is this not over a million views yet??
That final boss theme though ! It's so amazing especially how you added all the other elemental songs into one while making it flow.
This guy reminds me of Snart from The flash
i would play this game

Anyone else think his hoodie said anus?
i love you
*ANUS*\n*1921*
This made me smile so\n much. This is the first video I ever watched from you. My cousin showed it to me first in 2009 I didn't know who you were. We were just watching random YouTube videos and he showed it to me. Then we moved on to scary pop ups and the scary maze game reactions. Those were the days:) Then 2-3 years later, I made a YT account and found you again. I binge watched your videos and subscribed. Probably watched everything within a few days lol

Bruce and Bryan rocked the show. What a great video. Thanks for sharing.
Fantastic that these two greats came for the Invictus finale!   Brilliant games, great speeches by Prince Harry, and inspirational performances by the athletes.  Here's to Australia in 2018!
Bryan is doing a really god job here. Like, he nails the high notes like a master!
Broooooce! Bryan was great, too! thanks for sharing!
Thank you so much for this!
woww !!!!  what a rocking night !! Great Brian .....and... Bruuuuuuuce when are you coming back in  Italy ????
“Treading”
Legends 👍👍

👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
thanks for this!!
YES!!! PERFECT FOR MY BIRTHDAY!!!
I'm not familiar with Bryan but... is he as good as Bruce?
Too bad you cut out Cuts like a knife preceeding Badlands. Thanks for sharing, though.
Springsteen's voice is all gone. He should retire on his millions
I happen to watch this show on the telly by chance and wow I was blown away by their performance. I have never seen Strictly ever but I might start to watch it now because this pair's chemistry is unbelievable. Absolutely marvellous performance! Alexandra's stage presence is amazing. She's a lioness!
Don't mind me, just watching this for the millionth time.
Alexandra owned that dance!! Nice to see the judges give it so much love too ;)
This was *LIT* - cannot wait to see how firey their Argentine Tango is gonna be (whenever they get it)
I just LOVE it when the pros get a celeb who can really DANCE so they can go nuts with the choreo. Love this!!!!! This might be Gorka's year. Alexandra is a beast!! It might come down to Alexandra vs Debbie for the Glitterball, and I'm here for all of it!! Go Team Alorka!!
Their chemistry was on fire 🔥
Alexandra as good as as pro - in 2 weeks !! Paso Doble and Alexandra made for each other
Amazing xxxx
Fantastique
Cough cough decency please Man!
Possible Strictly winner??!!
😍😍😍
i sincerely hope that alexandra and gorka don't get the same treatment that natalie gumede and artem got a few years back. in my opinion, natalie has been the very best dancer to appear on strictly (with, or, without previous experience argument). alexandra could well equal the achievements of natalie. absolute pleasure to watch over and over again.
If they are shagging \nI definitely don't blame her 😂
Brilliant.
WOW!!! ........and only week 2!! Gorka.......you really hit the jack-pot when you were partnered with this girl!!!!
This is one of the best dances I have seen on strictly. The song was just perfect too.. I like that they did the Spanish version. But I agree with what Darcy says, the way Alexandra expresses herself to the music is amazing to watch.
No she did no just slay my life
Genuinely thought Alexandra was one of the professionals in this episode omdsss
The best in years since Alesha and fit Gorka too! Loved this in ironic Spanish
Sad none of her music has ever trend on Youtube
I am now at the age where I have started to watching Strictly.. Where is my pipe and slippers?
This would have been amazing at any stage... but for week two?  Outstanding!
SLAYYYY
Alexandra is just beyond talented, she owned x-factor and now Strictly too. She’s a superstar.
Alexandra Burke wow she was once a singer...
This felt like the first moment of the series.And in a frankly not too deep field this year,barring accidents, she's a finalist.I have to say I haven't quite warmed to her yet,but that's more about me with driven people.This was a delight by the way.Also I felt she was strangely undermarked last week.
She was so hot and fiery I couldn't take my eyes off her... and Gorka had his gorgeous chest out! =P It was a dance worthy of a 10 or two; and if it wasn't only week two, I think we might have seen it.
A jaw dropping performance !! Her musicality and her movement were absolutely sensational. Drama, Spanish lines thorough the body, flamenco arms, intricate choreography - this dance had it all. The one thing that was missing for me was the tilted hips - but other then that it was truly amazing. A 9.
Do this dance in 2/3 weeks time (same with Astons Salsa) They would have got much higher marks.
I know she has experience but that was Amazing she is great at Spanish lines, spins, footwork, posture, cape, attack and chemistry, 9
A-MA-ZING\nGiving this a 9 may be underrated \nAlexandra is amazing
On da floooorrrr
Great British people, I am calling for you to vote for this amazing couple! As I can not do it myself from Czech republic, please keep amazing Gorka and fabulous Alexandra until the finals! And I am going to watch this ten more times.
I used to love her on X Factor but damn. Her dancing is as good as her singing!
she is an amazing dancer... she is a bit smug but honestly this is an unbelievable performance by her for week 2 of the show and not much experience
Great dance for Week 2. 9/10
If thats how she preforms the Paso, I CANNOT Wait for her Tango and Argentinian Tango
Where the 40 at?
I genuinely can't believe the intensity she attacked this with and the difficult technique that she nailed - amazing.
Wow wow wow.
OMG love this girl. Amazing and only week 2. It's gonna be fantastic final. Betting on Alexandra, Aston and Debbie in final.
My new single Two Sides To You is now available on Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, GooglePlay and more! \nHead over to my Facebook page to get the links! \nFacebook.com/SayshaWilliamsMusic. Xo
I love strictly come dancing
I think that is a very good example of somebody who understands ballroom dancing and the little details of flamenco (paso doble). Very well executed by both.
They definitely saved the best till last. Fab-u-lous as Craig would say. Alexandra danced like a pro, and Gorka looks hot. Not my overall favourites, but one of them (I think it's hard to have a fave this early). It's a 10 from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the new Alesha Dixon!
9
Honestly rewinded this dance more than 10 times last night. Parents got annoyed so I went to bed- secretly keeping watching on YouTube. You're my faves guys- literally was dreaming last night I was dancing with Gorka
Incredible! I usually lose interest during some of the dances, but this was such a dramatic and intense performance, perfectly executed, that I had to come and watch it on here again!
they deserve to win it for sure!
That was INCREDIBLE. Oh my Goodness... they were on FIRE!! The dislikes are obviously wrong. Go team Alorka!!
They are smoking hot….Thank hmmm Gorka has a partner that can dance so we can see him in full view! Yum Yum Yum!!!!! Can’t wait for next week
One of the best dances ive seen on strictly, loved it! They've got such amazing chemistry together and Gorka, be still my beating heart!! 😍 I thought no one could replace Aljaz as my number 1 strictly crush but Gorka's giving it a good go lol
Watch the lady in the white shirt behind the pair at 00.30 seconds. She can’t believe what she’s seeing 😂 That was my face.
I Also Think Alexandra & Gorká Would Earn The 2017 Glitterball!
Get um Alex!
SSSLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
I'm still amazed at this & it's only the 2nd week!! Thrilled for Gorka who went out too soon last year!!!
Hmm, I was thinking before it started: this'll be ok... 0.12 BAM!!! Jump-spin and the fireworks exploded. Definitely worth the score and the standing ovation from CRAIG that it received!
Can't believe what I'm watching considering it's only the second week. AMAZING!
Absolutely sensational 👏👏👏
Amazing!!!
1:30 She was very restrained to not have gone for his lips!
Gorka eres el mejor! Además de gran bailarín, gran profesor. Besos desde España :D
Who knew she could be this intense? I thought I would pass out after watching this dance
Alexandra and Gorka are simply the best better than all the rest better than anyone who's ever been on the show before things can only get better by the strength and sheer excellence of this dance
Jls and the Saturdays face ...like WTF face lol hilarious
AMAZING FIREY HOT PASSION SOMEONE HELP COOL DOWN THE FLAMES!
I think it was a bit to fast and it was very flashy but if thats what they were going for than let me say WOW WOW WOW or should I say POW POW POW she's got it and my favourite song of the night
Alexandra channeling Jlo, woohoo! It was hot! And she and Gorka killed it!!!
Alexandra didn't came to play !
Hard not to focus on Gorka but, Alexandra was amazing here. Not only did she dance to near perfection but, she put everything into it and the acting side was epic.
Oh my goodness!! That was sheer adrenalin. Super explosive!! Can't wait to see what else Alexandra & Gorka have up their sleeves for next week. That was absolutely outstanding.
Gorka is gorgeous, I can't take my eyes off him when watching them dance.
Absolutely Amazing, Alexandra owns this dance, her lines, her timing and attitude, perfect, Gorka and Alexandra will go far, if not all the way to the final.
I had tears in my eyes watching this ,my hubbie a London Taxi Driver said to me a psychiatrist in the cab once told him  they were genius tears ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and thats what it was
Amazing dance! But I didn't like the song. 9.0
My FAVOURITE couple!! I love you both so much❤️alex you are amazing😱
Lovely footwork, lovely Spanish lines and just an amazing performance in general - especially for week 2! Only improvement could be more shaping of the free arm in some places and she looked down at one point (but this is really nitpicking!).\n\n8/10
Im seeing the final 3 being Alexandra, Debbie & Aston
Just curious if any of you women out there have complained to BBC about Gorkas outfit....or lack of? I mean after all, it is a 'family show'. I mean... .Dont you all go crazy when the pro girls show too much leg or tits? Amazing how quiet you all are when there is a 6 pack on show! Pffft.
Who is the most annoying person in the world?\n\nAlexandra Burke by a country mile.\n\nMy idea of hell would be to be stuck in a lift with her....
Blooming heck that was amazing!
Omg she's absoulty stunning! Amazing dancer and so much passion! I hate all these talent shows but I'm a little bit tempted to start watching this one because of her but I won't
They remind me of Normani and val anyone else?
I adore this dance!
WHY DID NO ONE GIVE THIS A 10!!!
Ohh shock shock another \nCompetitor that got a big applause .. for dancing well  ..\nOh I forgot they danced before??? it's a fair competion  ok let me see Aston ,Debbie ,Alexander ..I thought it was about stars that never danced before and see how they come on threw the weeks .. it's \nabit unfair as the dancers are a bit disadvantage .
My favourite couple on Strictly Come Dancing this year love them!
Uno what gets me\n Aston has more views for his dance. And I'm sorry he is certainly not as good as this. I now know he will win the show just cous he has biggest fan base not cool
One of the best dances in Strictly history. Would have been 10s a few weeks down the line.
I do get annoyed when Alexandra talks but she is such a talented singer and dancer! This definitely tho is the performance of the night! Possible one of the best paso doble performances I've ever seen actually! 😱💚
Since when did John fashanu join the strictly contestants?
I cannot stand this woman she is so Incredibly up herself and way over the top. Her facial expressions in this looked like she was constipated. Bore off
Another one who has been taking dancing lessons way before the series started..pathetic..
Too fast and too aggressive needed more content. Thumbs down.
Alexandra is also dance trained yet nobody seems to give her grief compared with Debbie
A great dance but you can’t compare her to the others. She has a lot of dance experience and shouldn’t be on an amateur dance comp against people with no dance experience at all
I don't get it, this just didn't have the paso feel that Debbie's had last week. Emperor's new clothes springs to mind...
My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anything. I scoffed at him. Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line. Well...you see professor I say as the teacher prepares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. I watch Rick and Morty. The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. ...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety. Well you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB! One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who this fellow genius is. It's none other than Albert Einstein.
14:27 - 14:31, he talks about evil morty but in the whole episode nothing happened relating to evil morty
He lied about evil morty in the finale...
Dan Harmon.... you lying sack of SHIT!!!\n\n\n\n\nI’m joking but still... way to lead us on
WHERE IS MY EVIL MORTY DAN HARMON. YOU HINTED AT AN EVIL MORTY APPEARANCE, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING!!
No evil Morty in the season finale. rip
Dan harmon has lied to us WHYYYYY
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
Hello everybody want to get free stuff download Verydice and start rolling use my code 1177158
Am I the only one who has no clue what there saying? 🤣🤣
Matpat I'm disappointed, Rick's tongue isn't an electrode, there are no h+ gated neurons in the neocortex, therefore the acidic compounds wouldn't be able to cause impulses, the presence of sodium is completely irrelevant, the extracellular space is already saturated with sodium, the tongue wouldn't be able to stimulate neurons in the neocortex, which are largely ligand gated with glutamate and GABA for inhibitory neurons.\n\nIn fact, the presence of more extracellular sodium would prevent the conduction of action potentials, the electrostatic gradient would be fucked, and potassium would be unable to leave the neuron(like charges repel one another, potassium and sodium are positively charged, the excess of sodium would erase the electrostatic gradient necessary to for ionic conductances).\n\n Therefore, even if Rick's tongue managed to drive an action potential in the recently killed roaches neocortex, that would be it; he would get one action potential to fire and the cell would be unable to continue into the falling phase of the AP, leaving it depolarized; as you're no doubt aware, there is no known neuron that can cause a post synaptic action potential with just one spike, the highest they go up to is a post synaptic depolarization of 10 millivolts; which is still about 15 away from threshold potential in a typical neocortical neuron.\n\nThe only way a cell would be able to get back to polarized and hyperpolarized would be via passive leak conductances and the sodium potassium pump, which enters a dysfunctional state when there hypernatremia is taking place.\n\nSo no, pickle Rick would never get the roach to move like they can move in laboratories with electrodes directly feeding current into the cells.\n\nAnd of course there's the issue of how few cells in the neocortex the tongue would even be able to effect, I doubt it would even have effects on layer 3-6.\n\nAll in all, sloppy work.
OMG I laughed soo hard in the end :D
Hey film theorist! I suggest u to do a video on Tamil film Shut up vaaya moodi pesavum do your analysis on a bizzaire fictional disease out there that makes us mute. & can kill u too. Please analyse whether such disease is possible in real world.
Nice try, but when pickle Rick transforms into regular Rick, he GROWS from just a pickle. This is thermodynamically impossible. Therefore, this series must take place in a universe with different physical laws than our own. Therefore, discussion of the plausibility of becoming a pickle in that universe is meaningless. Anthyding Can Hadplen\nwah waaaaahhh
are you gonna do a grave encounters theory?\nplease do one
How would everyone miss this episode? It’s what brought more toxic kids to the show.
Really. Next he's going to try to prove Sharknado\n\n\n\n\n\nWait!!!
Why does it seem no one else is talking about the fucking bomb shell Harmon dropped at the end? He confirmed the season 3 finale is gonna have Evil Morty!
No evil morty in that episode...
I've never seen rick and morty should I watch it and is it on Netflix ?
14:33 YO WHAT THE FUCK THERE WAS 0 MENTION OF EVIL MORTY
Maybe the pickle had a compact artificial processor inside of it that could house his memories and intellect instead of his brain.
I still don't get how this guy gets views. Legit all his theories are bullshit, his humor is shit, like it's passed the point of getting angry at it and straight to disappointed that people find this entertaining
Rick and Morty season 3 ep 10 is finally here baby!\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\n\n\n\n 14:28 it had nothing to do with evil Morty. I hate that episode because Jerry and Beth is back together and that Morty is kinda not on Rick’s side anymore.
Hey MatPat, whats your favorite episode of rick and morty?
The roach control and human to human control was done on the White Rabbit Project on Netflix
Where on earth is evil morty!!!!!! I didn't see evil morty >.<
I MEAN 2:33 MY GOD CAN I TYPE TODAY
13:06 I see what you did there Mat Pat
The problem with this whole electric pickle is totally plausible idea is that Pickle Rick has only the energy of a pickle (~1 calorie) and would almost instantly run out of calories to run the nervous system of both him and a cockroach, and the muscles in his pickle tongue at the same time.
This video was quite stretched out way to long.
What if after season 6 of rick and morty. Theres a movie?
Horribly disappointed by the last episode of the season... analyse the hell out of this episode and everything that led up to it to find something that that'll get rid of this blue baller that is the 3rd season finale. Even the dino stripper isn't gonna be enough to help!
Can you talk more on evil morty? Well just watch the end of this season watches end of season, pleased, but still unsatisfied there was no evil morty. Dan harmons a LIAR!!! Unless, a secret extra episode or something?? #BethIsAClone
you nerds are reading into this cartoon way too much! this is way beyond Cringe!!
It was a lie after all
Surely rick could've altered his  molecular parameters to allow  for high levels of sodium prior to becoming a pickle
Whoever comes to our channel will have their spiritual work cut out for them. We ask , you answer
One problem. The brain of a cockroach is spread throughout its body.
That's right...the finale was yesterday...FUCK YEA!
Have you ever thought of the fact that he can turn back to human with a syringe?\nExplain the science of dat

Did you guys actually go out to lunch?
This is not possible because nerves conduct what mucles do and we cant lead that from complexity so impossible
Thanks! I hate it!
no i dont need anger management DAMN      boy you need to stop PISSING ME OF !
Are you actually going to lunch with him? if so you better vlog it
If rick used a rat brain to control his limbs, shouldn't he have been able to understand rat language
Doin the bell thing
Lol
At least theres someone giving solid debunking facts
Holy shet Ma name is Rick
Fuck that shit season finale

This video sucks.
14:27 thanks for lying about evil morty DAN NO evil morty was there tonight
Where is the evil morty I was promised?\nGreat now I can't kms until I get answers...
Harmon you bastard!\nYou lied to us.\n...\nYes, the Episode was awesome, but still!
You jackass, it had nothing with evil morty.
He never said Evil Morty would be in the episode. He just said wait 'til the end of the season to know. Now we know he's not in the episode. You got duped, get over it.
You reminded me, value of Schmeckles theory
But how did pickle rick create the bug suit or the mechanism to make the rat suit
THIS IS IT, BOYS! WE'VE BROKEN PAST THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL! WE'RE GOING INTO THE GROUND! WE'RE GONNA DIG ALL THEY WAY TO FUCKING CHINA!
Well,Last Episode Was bad.See you in 182 years
I just love how everyone that watches Rick&Morty think they are smart, just because they 'get' the show.
DAN U SAID EVIL MORTY!!! I JUST WATCHED THE LAST EPISODE OF THE SEASON AND NO EVIL MORTY!!!
EVIL MORTY WASN'T IN THE THE FINALY YOU BOOB!
I feel betrayed!!! Evil Morty was not in the finale. Why did u like to us Dan
DIE! DIE! YOU DIDN'T GIVE US EVIL MORTY DAN HARMON!
There's no evil morty in the season finally (maybe there was one and I'm just blind)
THAT WAS BY FAR THE BEST EPISODE EVER. HAVE THE CREATOR OF RICK AND MORTY ON MORE! 😁
I'M PICKLE RIIIICK!!
I'M AVOCADO RIIIIICK
This was wonderful
Well dan lied about evil morty shamelessly
Yo Dan Harmon you lied.
I love you
congrats being 39 on trending (I guess?)
This show is Fucking terrible and should be killed off thank you for reading this\n\n\n\nFaggot
Can someone please just fucking nuke whatever YouTube server this video is being hosted on?
what was the point of this video? you put in the title that pickle rick would work, but in the end proved that rick was an avocado, and not a pickle. so this video was pointless and stupid. why did dan harmon agree to this?
When did this channel become so cringey and shit?
3:20 see this is a great example of mat bringing up some inane bullshit just to pad the runtime but like is it really neccesary to tell us oh pickle is actually fruit not vegetable and that dan harmon cameo is really pointless why do you need to go off on some tangent about oh the science is real oh no it isnt like really 3:20-5:13 is filler skip it guys you can thank me later
Your channel as turned into a shit nest, please go back to your old videos instead of being a trashcan.

Suppose you wanted to destroy a nation. How might you go about it?\nWell, for starters, you could flood their lands with millions of people of another race. \nThen you could encourage people to assimilate and mix together until there were no more people of the original race left.\nThen you could call anyone racist who objected to any of this, and get them fired from their jobs.\nHave you noticed something? This is exactly what is happening to White people in White countries right now.\nDiversity is a codeword for White genocide.\nAnti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.

Why do people use Tinder? Can't they just date someone they know or go meet someone nearby?
Dating apps are another way for girls to make money doing cam shows to become an IG celebrity! Plain and simple. we guys who are dying of the single lonely bullshit are usually tricked into paying monthly fee's just to follow hundreds of girls on IG which is a waste. just look at how Mia Khalifa got famous doing PornHub which is a home based porn industry!
Buy me pizza and I will let you touch my butt.
AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAH TRUTH. my goodness. I havent had it sine last year but I can imagine nothing has changed. Ohhh please do the coupes profiles!!!
HAHAHA. I will pay you 30$ to do a Hearts of Iron 4 videos
Trending, and not even on the main channel. RIP
You sound salty af lol but yeah I would never resort to tinder so this is probably still accurate
This is why i dont use tinder. Huge waste of time if you're trying to get girls.
Holy shit this is on point lol
Sara is spanish for sarah
OMG the comment section is so true😄. Lets be honest from a guys side of ANY internet dating. Is near impossible. Yet a girls side would get more than enough swipes. And that's not just for tinder.
Everyone's basic on tinder because, guess what!!? They basic in real life🙄
When you get on trending
I don't even have a tinder and I feel personally attacked right now
This feels like its based on a true story
Do you like music?\nYES! *proceeds to list off a list of artists, albums, songs, genres, etc.* I JUST ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT, do you like music?\nYeah *talks about the ed sheerman song in their bio*
Chips and queso are the way to my heart.
You gotta add my name spelling into that basic white girl names list 😉
What is even funnier, there isn’t single girl on the comment section trying to argue otherwise.
And I cant get a text back.....
*see you next year papa*
is this an ad for venmo?
What if I make one as a meme?
Also “I love pizza” and over used Snapchat filters
Jim millions of families suffer from identity theft every year.........
You missed the yoga obsession, wine, cheese and the fact that they’re always “down for an adventure”

So Tinder is full of basic bitches? Got it. Glad I deleted it. Hasn't changed much.
I like to go on adventures
Holy shit on trending love you sam
Was that a sponsored app at the end? Couldn't even tell want it was 10/10
did i wake up in hell? how did sam's second channel's video get to #10 tendency
If there's a far girl in the profile it's her
Tinder is the reason I hate women.
why the fuck is it full of desperate  people, im so turned off fk this shit xD
loved that office reference
This is frighteningly true
Don't forget the bots that try to trick you.
IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE, JIM.
Humans are literally the simplest creatures \nAlso remember to swipe right for me to ignore you
Just here to make friends \n\nEveryone knows this is bullshit
So short but so great
Oh. My. Fucking. God. The accuracy.
this is 50 on trending in my country
You forgot the I sometimes model thing
Oh my fucking god I haven't check my tinder since I opened\nI wonder what's happening with it??
I made a Tinder account last week and saw everything in this video. Especially the shit about dogs lol. The women on there have no personality and their idea of telling a joke is reusing some dog joke or some joke about liking to eat, even when they weigh like 80 lbs and don't eat shit haha. I deleted the account yesterday.\n\nHere is what my Bio said.I'm a good man, looking for a single mom with a couple of Chad's thugspawns for me to help raise and support financially. Chad's thugspawn need a real man in their life to teach them how to be a responsible, respectful, loyal, courteous and civil human being. I look forward to being cucked when Chad gets out of jail. My dream girl is a single mom who spent years chasing bad boys and having their kids, only for the bad boys to jump ship and abandon them, leaving me to swoop in and take care of his kids, while my dream girl still has sex with him behind my back. I look forward to being cucked by a single mom :)\n\nNow that's a joke.
alot of basic bitches are gonna be butthurt after watching this lol
This is so brutally true🤦‍♂️😂
The amount of girls that genuinely think they're unique and oblivious to the fact they're so basic is laughable. #Travel #Coffee #Livelovelaugh #basic #unoriginal
I thought this was smoosh
SARA IS NOT AN INCORRECT SPELLING.
spot on. Check out me swiping tinder girls on my channel.
Tinder is still a thing????
Wow....pathetic, for both.....glad I’m not a millennial....u all have shems to deal with.

hi alfie
earlyyyyyyy y y y
❤❤❤❤
Never been so early xxxx
HAHAHAHAH!
When my kids annoy me I just send them to hang out with the grandparents at Resthaven Cemetery.
I just noticed that this guy only posts at the ending of each September with his kid and this is his fourth year. Can't wait to see his 2031 September video when his kid is 18 years old 😊
That dad is horrible, he should have stomped the kid being 5 times his size.
Is the bed okay?
If i was a dad id be that guy
That's great reminded me of when my son was young, great times. Thanks for posting it, that made me smile.
Uhhhh.....yeah.....why is this on trending?
I loved the jumps!  And the soundtrack!  The last jump looked like it hurt though lol!
soundcloud.com/crazyiqgenius show love so i can show some back!!!
This is just perfect !
Mmm the father has beautiful looking soles
“I’ll set up the camera, son. You get the ladder”
Best part was that last slap one
Hopefully you monetized the video. Put the money in his college fun
That arm flip was the most accurate thing ever
To be continued: September, 2018
I'm calling child services.
haha this is so cute\ni like the hair flip at the beginning 😉
What part of do not try this at home do u not understand
The kid in the thumbnail is about to get a football head.
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS AND BE THE CHURCH!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH SYSTEM AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!\n\n\nRevelation 18:4\n\n4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues\n\nHowever, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:\n\nProverbs 7....
I once did this with my dad and it was awesome until I punched him in the balls.
This is good parenting
Where are the SJWs at. Shouldn't A bunch of bovine faced People complaining about teaching violence or something?
*At **0:18** That must've Hurt*
These need to be more than once a year. Awesome.
That 2nd spear looked a little strong 😂.
My dad use to do that to me and my brother 😂 ah the good ole days
That's parenting done the right way. 💯
This video makes me want a son 👍
Welp, It’s been real. See y’all in September 2018.✌️
I wish I had a dad
This was so fake... clearly staged.
What the fuck did I just watch
Ill fucking slam that shut child on to the hard ass pavement
Two WWE related videos on trending.\n\nWe did it Reddit.
This reminded me playing with my brothers in my childhood..
Just seems kinda odd to allow the kid to do these things. He will probably kill a family member
K wosent what I was expecting to watch today
This is something some 7 year old would make
Why is this on trending
These need to keep coming!
8 years ago my dad said he went too Wal-Mart \n\n\n\n\nYup still waiting he'll be back
This isn't trending. It isn't funny,  it's too long,  and YouTube needs to stop pushing their bullshit family friendly agenda
yo my mom told me when I was 5 I was playing around and I pushed my dad. My dad got so tight that he took a belt and whooped my ass till I pissed myself and I was only fucking five lowkey tho my dad still great
no his neck doesnt look like its about to snap....does it?
Almost as fake as real wrestling.
There goes your kid in 15 years time
The thumbnail looks like the kid is going for a phenomenal forearm with the belt. I hope he grows to be a styles fan.
At 0:20 my phone fell over my face hurting my lip
My friend said he will give me a shout out if I get 1000 subs plzz get to 1000subs
I need a husband like that
Perfect chokeslam reversal with that RKO OUT OF NOWHERE!
EVERONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!a lot of kids die doing the same shit in this video. Have fun watching it now assholes
Dad of the year award goes to THIS GUY!
This is next gen parenting. I have a 5 year old son and 1.5 year old daughter. I need to step my game up.
when you wife takes him and half of your money...you will need more than 915 subs and 1 trending video.
I remember my dad used to do this with me instead of the usual tuck in before bedtime. He'd send me flying John Cena style and I'd land safely on the bed.
Gotta teach them that toxic masculine violence early. ✔️
BAH GAWD KANG, THAT WAS A SLOBBERKNOCKER!
That RKO is awesome
*DAD*\n*GOALS*
GOOD DAD  nice job bro 👍🏽 but\nYou got knocked d fuk outttttttt!!!! Lol
Like https://youtu.be/_xDIa6WPbWw

You look amazing and you deserve to be there!!!! #blessings
Not sure if you listen to podcasts, but one of the hosts of “the read”, Kidfury, mentioned you on one of the recent episodes. He talked about loving your fenty Beauty video. They have a huge huge following. If they recommend something/someone, people flock.

Well on your way to 2 million subs Pat 👏🏾
Hi Patricia. I am a newer subscriber, and I think I found you through a suggested video while watching Safiya Nygaard. I love your videos, particularly one of your older videos where you discussed how you developed your business. Love your personality and content!
the thumbnail is signature patricia face!! 😂
Who is that brunette next to Patricia at 23:59?
I honestly want/need you to make a Patricianary: like a Patricia dictionary. Your expressions are just so good and funny, you should publish them. \n\nAnd! Your theme song should be Gold, you honestly sing it every other video. But I love it!
Could you do a skin care routine video cuz your skin is looking amazing!!!!
What does Patricia do for a living?
I'm a new subscriber and I love your personality so much!! 💖💕💝
I love when you feature your home decor! You have great taste
Grace backing the milk though 😭😭😂😂
Newish subscriber from Australia and honestly love you and your videos. You are a crack up! Keep up the videos, i especially love your online purchase videos.
Isn't Grace beautiful?!  Love when you have her in the vlog for a bit.  You really looked good Patricia in all of your out on the town looks.
That Charlton shopping park. I work next door from there in matalan. You should come in matalan one morning in the week day and get something's for your home. We have a lot of Christmas decorations too
Who was the fashion designer in the video?
Patricia's life has gotten so glam. Like wow. You were at like a level 6 glam this time last year, and you've sky-rocketed to a full on level 10 glam. Good for you, you work hard. Get yours, bb!
May I know which mascara you are using currently Cz I'm getting obsessed with your lashes
New subscribers = more blessings.  You're blessed.  Give thanks and keep doing your thing.  Don't be worried.  You got this!
Some are from NZ :)
U are very beautiful!! Would love for u to come to the states!!
Maureen is your mum's twin!!
What are those pants called from misguided? And top?
The haphazardness is part of the draw. I stumbled upon your videos a couple weeks ago, and you just seem so sweet, so genuine and so comfortable with yourself. I appreciated it, so hit subscribe!! <3
I see that he's wearing his NEW shirt!!!!
I think I’m the only one who thinks Grace looks more like Mike
New sub here! YouTube randomly suggested a video of yours
Really nice vlog and very warm personality
I L O V E D this vlog Patricia and you looked Gorgeous luv! You SOOOOOooooooo fit in! NEVER doubt it! You just DO and I thank you for sharing your insecurities with me (us of course but I feel that you do your vlogs for me so there! <3) because it's refreshing to know that a regular, cool yet Lux, Glam girl like you is just really down to earth like most of us out here in these streets. (lol) Xoxo
Loved the vlog, keep making them!\n\nDon't be self-conscious, rock what you're working with- it's the confidence that shines through!!💯💯💯
Omg yes Patricia! Why are geese so aggressive? I was chased by one, and you know they can't do much harm but it's still low key terrifying.
I am so happy I found your channel Patricia! You are so high energy and hilarious, you brighten my day 😊💕
Pat! I love your humble personality 😘
I am i a new subscriber and I love your craziness :) I would not have subscribed love ur channel:)
I love your vlogs, girl. You're living, Girl!
to me you remind me of naomi campbell except younger, prettier and more down to earth plus that dress at 24:46 was incredible you look drop dead gorgeous in it
The romwe dress looked bomb on you! Your body is ridiculous, you go girl!
Do you still work a 9-5 job?
love how you always ask how we’re all doing ‘ 😊😊
I thought her husband, was her boyfriend and I had no idea she has a daughter. Can you tell I’m new here? 😂 Beautiful family!
Omgg I didn’t know that she have a daughter ❤️❤️❤️
All I have to say as a long time viewer (since late 2011 or early 2012) GRACE is absolutely the sweetest lil pumpkin! How she was  watching you in the car was priceless! hee hee. Also congrats Patricia your life has changed significantly, you can't deny that as that would also deny your hard work. So congratulations. #PatriciaBright
Honestly ever since she's had the baby she looks bettter and beeeetter everyday.
You're awesome! It's amazing to see someone grow and be able to hang with high fashion.
New subscriber!!! Love your amazing personality :)
Patricia you're just sooooo goood!! Your videos are funny, we enjoy watching them! I liked seeing how much your channel has grown! Cheers to you girl! 🌸💗💗😁
I love your channel! You actually inspired me to focus more on fashion where I shine!

It's cause you look good, blokes will listen to any old shit (I mean stuff they ain't interested in) when a hot girl talks and does stuff and has brains !
Gosh Grace is the cutest and that Romwe dress is banging on you!!!
The Lord BLESSED you, sis! Just receive His blessings!! Because of Him, we get what we DON’T deserve. Just praise Him and thank Him, girl! #loveyou

OMG COLLAB WITH LYDIA!!!!
AAAAH I shop in that homesense tooo!
Grace is soooo cute x
I was one of your new subscribers... I subscribed because I like your energy ... until today when you said all your new subscribers- was weird .... then you said you were grateful...(which didn't sound sincere at all)... I thought the idea was to welcome new people who subscribe and tune in to your channel and not alienate us by calling us weird for subscribing... there are just too many other channels  facilitated by people who actually like new subscribers. I can't be bothered with one who is clearly UN-grateful... You just lost one subscriber... Girl Bye....
Somebody - send that girl some free bitcoins :P
But if the baby wasn't white we all know how the comment section would go
I am sure he was sitting next to his friends and not commoners
The 6k peoeple who disliked this video should burn in hell
Henrey's so down to earth, he's a testament to his mother, a person of the people.
Fuck him, i don't care
He probably ate the little girl afterwards lol
Lol they knew each other, seriously misleading title
This is going to be one of the best when she was a baby stories :D
So cute but I would never let my kids do something like that. Very disrespectful, it will allow the daughter to think it is perfectly normal to behave like this in public
Always a good idea to actually feed your kids now and then, so they don't have to steal popcorn to survive. Cute though.
Whats up can you guys please help me get my name out there i post videos weekly and i promise i will have 1 mill subs one day so join medotv now and help me hit 50 subs for now lol

What a horrible parent letting her daughter steel from a fucking Prince that's just shameful.
and what ? omg she steals PRINCE HARRY POPCORN, wow omg omg wow no way she steals it
In america this kid was put in jail
The Queen is always dressed to impress. ❤️
Isn't the Royal Family German?
Steals is that meaning of word steal in english? I'm not native english speaker so I'm confused.\n\nIn my language when you EAT something without taking it away then it cannot be called stealing or theft, even if you entered eg. orchard illegaly, as long as you don't take anything away with you and you just eat you aren't stealing.
🔥🔥New York's Back 🔥🔥Watch Hurricane Wayne- New York's Back on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/zi9MIYkviS4
The mother wanted to tell the toddler to stop but then she realized that the monarchy has been stealing from them for years.
POPCORN companies in the UK now has a Model
I hate her mom pretending she doesn't know
So,why does the royal family still exist?
0:29 Prince harry is a lizard person
hey this popcorn is all mine prince ginger!!
This is so cute and sweet. Wish I could marry Prince Harry. Kidding! 😁🤞🏻🤞🏻
Harry's a cutie!!!
for English press one or just stay on the line
I luv what happend to the king of france.
British people why do you guys pay for these people?
She’s gonna grow up to realise that she met the prince and stole his POPCORN
omg, this is cuteness overload. I love how sweet and playful he is with the little girl.
That's fine, nothing compared to what his family from the rest of the world.
Why have so many views?
Hey guys I started a new YouTube channel and it would mean the world to me if you would go check it out :)
Everyone is saying how adorable this is, but in my opinion it’s extremely disrespectful. It was Prince Harry for goodness sakes! I know the little girl didn’t know any better, but the mother did. The mother should have really stoped the child in respect towards the Prince...
But, why was this trending?
I like how he pulled away lol
Ok miss you can suck my dick later
Her parents should not have allowed that. It seems that when he realizes what was about to happen,he moved his bag to the side and gave her one. Disgusting and not cute at all,who knows where toddlers' hands have been.
So some family a long time ago said we the royal family. So all you sheep just go a long with it. How did that family get so much power has anyone looked into it. I bet there is a dark evil past with this royal family. I would never bow to any other man.
He should have had her executed for that
how. how? HOOOOOOW?? how can 6K people dislike this video???? lol.
can he marry me😭
Reptilian tongue at 0:30 ..idc what anybody says. If you guys aren't aware of reptilians by now then you need to wake up.
thats not a prince thats just a normal person.
Toddler used *sneak* it's super effective!
The mom didn't care what so ever
He has his mom's mannerisms :)
Kings and queens and all this bullshit not relevant
Long live the popcorn and can unite all nations
anyone who subs to me i will sub you you'll a youutber!
why babys are gonna rule the world if you watched this than youll know
So that's why he was at my school...
They now each other Bdw so its not stealing but playing..
the mothers sees her doing it and just let's her... omg...
That Toddler was Prince Harry's daughter
He is a cool as fucking Prince he don't even act like a prince he act like a regular awesome dude you rock Prince Harry 💖💖💖💖💖💖

I am NOT an autist
I have developed the skills to make traditional visual art... but I struggle with self motivation, schedules, personal drive and getting things done 😭
You sure seem like a creative to me.  That's why I #thumbedit.
ok i relate to this so hard oh my god, like all my friends are either super creative and artsy or they're super athletic or they're both and i'm none of those things lol. but i totallyvget what you're saying
I read it as im not an autist. Lol
hannah witton queen of getting shit done!!! loved this video so much
Actually, studies show that most of 'creativity' is in fact, hard work.  So, there you go.  https://source.wustl.edu/2006/02/you-too-can-be-creative-it-just-takes-hard-work/
Wacom tablets are hard it ain't just u
“Maybe I’m not creative, and maybe I don’t need to be to create. I work hard and I’m driven, and perhaps that’s enough.” Brilliant
You have used your skills to give voice to important information and shine light on diverse and interesting topics. that is just as commendable as people who put feelings into songs or paint beautiful scenes with their words. everyone contributes something to this world, and what you contribute is amazing.
One can be creative outside the field of art. Taxes, for example.
>Enjoys maths and logic>Believes the wage gap is a real thing
'organisation v creativity' brings up some interesting thoughts, and I recently read a good quote that I think fits here: Hard work will always beat talent, if talent doesn't also work hard.\nI know talent and creativity aren't the same, but I still think the quote is close enough.\nAnyway, not feeling creative doesn't seem to have held you back, look at the life you're living in a very creative industry.\n\nI love the video, and your channel overall! You're simply fantastic!
Hi Hannah. my name is Luis, I'm from Lima, capital of Peru but I live in Italy. you are so nice and pretty. :)
Not gonna lie, thumbnail looked like it said ‘I’m not an autist’
You have no idea how relatable this video is!! Love you. Thank you for this.
Hannah you rock. Maybe not the next Van Gogh but you're good all the same
same though? my job isn't creative but my hobbies are- i still play with my college's alumni marching band sometimes, and i sew and cosplay. but i'm not creating my own music, just reading what someone else wrote for my instrument. you don't need to be creative to learn how to read music. and cosplaying is creative but it's more about figuring out how to take an outfit from a screen or a page and make it work in real life. it's just copying a design someone else came up with. same with the crazy makeup for one of the characters. it's not exactly creative when you're just copying someone else's.
I don't think that creative and artistic have to be the same thing. Also, I really loved your little Ummm chorus.
I freaked out when you showed the doodle you always do because I always do the exact same one!!!
I DO THAT DOODLE, that's the only one that I do and I relate to this video a lot. I'm an academic and not creative at all, but that's ok :) great video
Agh thank you! I'm the same all my friends are so incredible at art or music or writing but I just can't do those things however much effort I put into them and I've kinda been struggling with that lately so thank you for making this bc actually I'm a really hard worker and I'm sure if they tried to do politics or sociology they wouldn't be as good as they are at art either :) xx
My dream was always to be an artist. Be it a musician, painter, writer or an actor. That's why I'll never be happy, I think. My creativity is minus 1 thousand. I still play guitar and other instruments because playing and singing gives me a little of joy, but I think I gave up on being a musician. I'm trying photography now, cause it seems it can be an art form, but doesn't need as much creativity as say writing. Oh, and I'm not a people person. I suck at communicating. I can be organised but that doesn't come easily as well. Might as well shoot myself in the head.
I definitely resonate with this. I am also very organised. I feel like being creative is a process that I have to practice and hone. It does not come naturally to me, but I enjoy the satisfaction of seeing small improvements in my work.
I'm not creative either I suck at all things arts n craftsie luckily my job doesn't require me to be artistic but I do feel your pain as most of the ladies I know are good at creative things and I think it would be nice to have a little bit of skill with a paintbrush or sewing machine x
I’m creative and I’m organised, I put everything in my life into a routine
I'm the opposite. I am a creative person, I can dream up stuff and draw and create but I am surrounded by people who think this is magic. But I am insanely jealous of people who are seamlesy self disciplined and work hard because I am lazy and dream a lot. \nNot everyone has to be creative, not everyone has to be good with numbers, not everyone has to be organized (at least not heavy organized :D ) but we can all work together and learn from each other a bit.
love this!!!! :) such a great video as always xoxoxo
Honestly Hannah, I swear we are the same person! My boyfriend is incredibly creative, its what calms him down, and he can't understand how I can't doodle or write a story or write a song! Thank you for this
Funny thing for ne is that I actually love all the arts. I love music, poetry, photography. I'm just not good at that. But that's ok, I'm graduating from med school and that's where my being driven and organized really helped. In my free time I enjoy arts or I bake cake, for fun not because I feel obligated to do it!
I think creativity is more of a spectrum than discrete categories. Maybe it’s not that you’re not creative, it’s just that it takes a bit longer to come up with ideas and stuff, compared to more creative spirits. But when it comes to putting those into practice, girl you got this! Much love for your vids 💛
Creativity isn't necessarily talent to make beautiful stuff. For me it is about taking your way of looking at the world and applying it to solving problems in a way that no one else can. For me, the ability to 'get stuff done' is creative. \n\nIn her book 'Big Magic', Elizabeth Gilbert says ...the central question upon which all creative living hinges: Do you have the courage to bring forth the treasures that are hidden within you?. And I think you're extremely courageous.
Another one into the club! Welcome hannah
This is me!!! Well, minus the math. But still.
not everybody has to be creative! I'd love to be organized and get my homeworks ready before the deadline for once, but nope... that's just not how I role.
you look like dodie on the thumbnail!
Communicating and dealing with numbers all involve creativity! :)
what extension are you using for your chrome dash?
the not-artistic bit is SO TRUE for me! unfortunately, the organisation bit is not lol. so i am uncreative and disorganised and it's really bloody hard to make stuff
You and me both, Hannah, you and me both!
I'm a creative person and, trust me, it doesn't always come naturally. I haven't made anything since June because of a lack of inspiration
OH MY GOD THIS IS MEEE. I'm a musician, study music, and I'm in a band. I've always persued creative subjects, but I'm academic and organised rather than creative because I don't 'make stuff' - I 'work with stuff'. I'm also like Hannah in the sense that I am so good at organising my time/work that I can enjoy time off after my part-time job, band rehearsals, uni work and researching job placements. I can't compose for shit, but I sure as hell can organise a good music event. Fuck yeah to the people in creative industries that aren't creative.
This video is really really interesting because I'm the complete opposite- my entire family are artists, and I've never ever struggled with art, writing, singing, poetry, and I play several instruments. But I'm an engineering student, and I love science more than anything, even though i struggle immensely with maths, organisation, and everything that makes an engineer, so I have to work twice as hard as everyone else. I'm very jealous of you but I also relate to this video!! Hard work is always worth it if you're doing what you love. Thank you for making this video. 💛
I relate to this so much! I'm great at math and analytics, I can find the answer if there is an answer there,  but it's frustrating when I realize I don't care as much about that stuff than I do about creative arts. In uni, I've pushed myself into more humanities classes and it's so damn HARD and so much more time consuming than my stats class, but I love them. I'm finding ways to incorporate how I work, for example my discipline and analyitical skills works great when keeping up on readings and analyzing texts, and I can use my friends stats and math in policy/social jobs. Different skills can come together to make great content even if you're not a natural drawer/musician/creator. It's easy to wish for what you don't have.
Enjoyed this one at Buffer!
You're hired!\n\nWait a minute... this wasn't an interview for job(!)
Even though this video was entirely about you speaking from your perspective, somehow it was exactly what I needed to hear about myself.
I am a singer. I am not creative. It gets very frustrating at times.
I do that DOODLE! I’m a linguist not a creative person and I’m so organized I can relate to this so much. Another amazing video ❤️
Aww great. Now I just want to see wait you were drawing at the end.
I am a good self taught artist... but still find struggles with being natural creative and inspired\nbut I do the things I love and that's why I enjoy doing it..
Keep working hard! I think you're really amazing!
This video was so thought provoking! I've always been a more creative person but in recent years since I went to university I've found that I really struggle to kind of get any creativity out of my brain and into physical form if that makes sense. I feel like I have so many ideas but when it comes to actually doing them my brain just goes nope. I wish I could be organised
This is so me! Loved the video!
I saw that cheeky quadratic formula in there ;-)
THAT DOODLE IS ALL I CAN DO
Well at least she has no self illusions
This is me!! The end part reminded me of my mum in her medical career ‘you don’t need to be clever to do medicine you just have to be able to work incredibly hard’
thanks for making this
You're insanely good at articulating your opinion and thoughts though and you could consider that an art in and of itself.
OH MY GOD I LITERALLY DO THE SAME DOODLE! I am not a creative person either! What are the chances of that?!
ahh this is so interesting\nI am so completely unorganised i stress my friends out every hour as i wonder where on earth i left my phone/wallet/any other thing that i may have used within the last few minutes. \nbut i am creative\nand because of the total disorganisation that is my life i find it hard to be consistently the same type of creative.\nI've dabbled in almost every creative endeavour there is and gained a lot of joy and passion from every one. but my guitar now sitting in the corner, i haven't made a video in months and my paint brushes are covered in dried paint. \nI wish that i had the drive and the focus to just keep going. to not get distracted and move on before i've even finished the last thing.
Love it so much
2:57 HAHAHA <3\nThis was a GREAT video.\nI'm not creative nor organized. I'm just a mess that happens to have something done from time to time. That's a bad life and i can't change T_T
This video was kind of like spoken word poetry so you are already doing creative things! \nDon't sweat not being creative tho, as a creative person I struggle with organisation, my life is a mess and I'm constantly over thinking my work. I don't get stuff done... and I'm an artist.
Creativity is not merely making art, poetry or music. creativity is all in how you approach problem solving. Creative people find novel ways of solving problems and in fact see problems where other less creative people think a procedure or way of doing something is just fine. The creative people see ways of doing it differently to make it better. This is how many of the worlds greatest creators/inventors thought! I think that you are a content creator with unique ideas, so I think you are more creative than you give yourself credit for.
I love this video so much!
You are different to your creative friends but you know what? You teach us stuff, you help me understand the world around me. You’ve helped me sort my life out a little and for that, I thank you!\nYou’re a brill person Hannah, thank you so much for everything xx
I loved this! Sam Saffold did an awesome job editing. You guys are a great team!
John Cleese claims that if being creative was some natural talent people were born with, he would not have done well. He says it's more like a state of mind that is harder and harder to get into because we get so distracted by all sorts of stuff these days. Something like that. It comforted me a lot when I felt down because I am not a creative person.
what does a woman and dog shit have in common? the older they get the easier they are to pick up
You have no idea how much I relate to this. And believe I know it hurts, specially because I love art but I'm just terrible at creating it. It's really refreshing to know that such an admirable person like you feels the same way :) what a relief haha, and anyway, your content and just everything you say is so interesting and educational, and education is what opens people's minds, it creates new thoughts, the ability of thinking is art... okay I might be going too far; but to me, Hannah Witton you are an artist because you make people  think
I wish I could do maths.. I've got to re-do my gcse next month, praying for a miracle😂
It seems to me that maybe you're more logically creative than artistic. I am quite similar, and I also have a lot of artistic friends. I feel you, Hannah. Cool video :)
This is so cool! I totally can relate with this, thank you
It's okay Hannah, giving birth doesn't come naturally to me either
Is that Tracey Emin in disguise?
yes i love this! i'm pretty much the opposite and it's taken me a long time to realize that in order to be good at something, i don't have to be good at everything. each person can find their own niche and it's the diverse array of skill sets and talents that allows things to get done.
There 're many ways to be creative. It doesn't have to be technical. For Christ's sake, you wrote a book!
Honestly, this means so much to me! I struggle a lot with just... well, not being creative and not really having a creative outlet and just... It means so much to see that someone like you struggles with it as well. So, thanks for speaking out about it! Makes me feel a little less alone in being the uncreative person I am.
omg I can so relate to this, love your videos :D
This video is such an eye opener! 😍😍
I was thinking that hand looked like sam's
Hannah Witton That's not a problem, I sometimes feel like a river of creative ideas and at other times I don't know what to think.\nHard work gets you there so count on it till you figure out how to stimulate your creativity to comes out whenever you need it.
I'm neither creative nor organized or a people person 😅\nThat's why I'm not a YouTuber (and don't have any other job or passion either)
Jesse welling is the king of creation \nAn you can't say your not creative the way you talk about serious stuff an makes people want to watch it again and again because you have an inviting an happy vibe in all you videos
I can relate so much to this. I am surrounded by creative people and I can't even make pretty doddles.
I've come to think over the course of my life that the major difference between creative and non creative people is that creative people enjoy practicing their craft. And so they seem innately better but in fact all they're is well practiced. I think what separates people is not necessarily their ability to perform certain tasks but by their desire. For example. I'm not very musical, I leant the violin when I was younger but I barely practiced because I didn't like practicing so I never got very good. However I've been drawing for as long as I can remember and I enjoy practicing so I've slowly got better over time. So now my drawings are pretty alright, (*cough follow my Instagram: @Kameel_sm *) but for most of my life they were just shit. So my point is arty people aren't special they just practice all the time so they seem effortless but if you look back they've done some pretty shitty work.
You might not see yourself as creative,but your videos are always so inivitive and original and breaking the taboos of talking about sex or periods or both together and that's why your my favourite youtuber as I find those things so much more important to discuss. I'd love to hear more spoken poetry from you though :)
Hi Hannah, \nI think being creative is not about just 'being able to draw' but rather a way of life and understanding things. I really believe that everyone is innately creative, however society has kept telling us that only certain 'arts' fir into that category. \nYou should read Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert, she talks about and redefines, in my view, what a creative life is!\nXxxx
Love this, so witty :)
Brilliant!
Amazing!!!
THIS IS ME !!
That was... creative
love that necklace hannah!
Hi
so good!
I completely changed my mind about creativity when I read Elizabeth Gilbert's book Big Magic where she essentially says every person is creative. You might not be creative in your editing, but you are creative in coming up with content. Creativity is often pigeon-holed as just art, music, painting, and poetry but writing is also creative and you wrote a whole bloody book!  Also don't believe organisation opposes or limits creativity. Loved the video!
P.S.\n\nI'm actually both organized and creative. If I don't get something done in a timely manner, it's because I'm not passionate about it (the reason why I don't upload political videos often. They give me  a literal headache.) For example, my most recent upload called life advice from a life coach was scripted, filmed, edited, and had the added pixel art rendered for the thumbnail in one day. I drew this image of a Hipporat within minutes of having a trippy moment of hearing a sound and automatically thinking that a hipporat made it because it sounded like a blend between a rat's squeak and a hippo's hollar: https://imgur.com/a/6M6N7 recently, I rendered this depiction of Skynet 7K, a merged form of Skynet from Terminator and Atom 7K from the Scandroid songs: https://imgur.com/a/cm5yQ again, within minutes of imaging it. I'm also able to come up with fully formed plans in my head very, very quickly. The creative process works with the artistic process to improvised step-by-steps that are plain genius and actually work when put to practice (but this is due to the fact that I'm an experienced and educated person. I used to have to revise these plans often after finding out they didn't work in practice when I was a kid and tween.)
These people care about one thing, Living.\nMeanwhile, arrogant Americans in the USA fighting over everything from skin color to kneeling to a slave song (National Anthem)\nPeople in the USA mind is fucked up. Most, not all
Wonderful documentary showing the resilience of these beautiful people and the strength of community in the face of such devastation. Thank you Sam Branson ! Shared to several groups...
Amazing story. Keep up the good work!
Thank you so much Sam for your big heart. This is a very moving video. Be blessed for reaching out to your community. The people also seem to genuinely love you. Thank you for reaching out and for sharing this with the world. #bvistrong
Thank you for this. This glimpse into the reality that exists in the BVI right now does not exist, and people need to see this to understand. Thanks Sam.
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Great video Sam - love to all the guys in the BVI!
I was not aware of the totality of devastation to this area. It's tragic but the spirit of the people in the midst of such difficulty shows their strength. They are stronger than I might be... not complaining, but truthful in certain situations and grateful when they see someone there to help. Thank you!
thanks so much  as this film makes it so real, I hope they get lots of help.
Good stuff Sam. Thankfully Antigua was spared and is trying to help our neighbors. All the best.
Thank you from Singapore! Is internet connectivity restored +Sambranson  ?
Thanks for posting this Sam. People have no idea how destructive these storms can be. I've been through quite a few in Bermuda, but nothing like this. So far this year we have been very fortunate to stay out of the path. Right now we sit between two storms for the second time this season.
The spirit and attitude of the people of Virgin Gorda is truly amazing.
Sharing Sam. Wish I could be there to help and hug. <3
Thankyou for documenting this.Gives good insight on whats happening in BVI.Am grateful there hopeful and grateful to be alive.It will get better with time.
Thanks so much for supporting this beautiful people in  need , thanks a million Sam.
I'm so appreciate for your good works. Keep going Sam.
Hi Sam. Great video. I’m devastated by what has happened. I want to know what I can do to help. My friends run sunchaser scuba and I was over there just in May / June. The pictures I’m seeing are horrifying and bring me to tears each time. 😢 how are the animals in the sanctuary on Necker doing and on VG?
Keep up the positive work Sam! Proud of you taking care of other and yourself. Stay safe and continue to have high spirits! Help is on the way! If you need a Master Electrician I'm always around! Don't look back and continue to build for a better future!
Sad to see such devastation but amazing job Sam going in to help! The world needs more people like yourself! Keep safe and positive. Hard times can have an effect on the brain too so take care of each other and you! Heads high and help is coming soon!
Help's coming.  Great job keeping hope alive Sam.
❤️
Thank you for this video. My niece is in St John living it & volunteering. Pictures can't show what they're experiencing but this gives us an idea.  God Bless you!
For a greener,stronger and more positive Virgin Islands! Amazing people! Stay safe Caribbean!
Love this..Thanks for sharing your good work!
My home ❤️😭
Oh my goodness!  I knew it was bad but not this bad.  Thank you so much Sam for sharing this and giving an insight into how devastating the situation is.  God Bless you for your efforts to help these people.
How can I physically get involved and help in person, for an open amount of time, not a vacation? I am strong, multi-talented, and can do so many things, like help rebuild, with many carpentry skills, as well as cook, teach the children., an artist that can beautify the current environment they have.  Do you know of anyone who would be organizing volunteers?  Love to all on BVI.\nThank you for your honest and touching video.
Brilliant video, Sam Branson - Robin Pinfold and family  are having a fundraising in Cornwall, can we use this video?
David Irwin, Doubled D Charters shared your video out. I lived in St Maarten 10 years, visited VG. After watching hundreds of videos about islands destroyed, yours, reveals more realistic depth of Help, Hope, & Hurricanes, and Love bigger than any hurricane. Thank you. Love & respect.
What I don't understand is why there has been no preparation for this? For an island that regularly experiences hurricanes why are the buildings not being built with concrete and bricks? Why are the roofs not strapped? Why are the boats not pulled into dry docks? There is usually 10+ years between big hurricanes but it seems very little preparation if any has been done.

aw i feel like you could of allowed more of your charm and asked more about him regarding anything to link with korea, or even korean gentlemen culture etc.
I don't know did I get here lol
Maybe now he can give you tips on how to dress like an Italian gentleman.
Is kingsman really popular in korea?
wish he or his PR team agreed to do it 영국남자 way, but seriously such a calm and professional interview tho :) cheers to ya!

Josh, you did a great job interviewing Colin Firth! Great video!
A gentleman would unbutton his suit when sitting.
They were proper English gentlemen. Except that Taron is Welsh haha
I don't know what anyone is saying but good interview.
*Just an English comment passing by*
I've not watched the Kingsmen yet,   but I'd the sense that that previous 치맥 interview was a bit of a big deal..then I saw this one with Colin Firth and my eyebrows disappeared into my hairline. I've been a longtime fan of this channel, so to see it have grown to a platform of such cultural significance is meaningful. Josh is such a natural! Korean Englishman 화이팅 :)
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
OMG I'm so jealous, you interviewed Colin Firth!! So lucky
Where am I

You lucky lad!!! 😱😍
콜린퍼스 반의반이라도 닮았으면 나도 저렇게 늙고 싶다
진짜 내가 딱 정리한다 2편이 1편의 0.8배라고 생각하면된다 재밌다
영상보고 왜 콜린퍼스한테 실망하게 됐지...... 킹스맨은 그냥 1편에 둘걸 그랬어..
콜린퍼스 많이 피곤해보이는데도 정성껏 답변해주네요. 웃는 얼굴이 멋진데 많이 못봐서 아쉽지만 영화에서 보면 되겠죠~ 조쉬 수고했어요!
콜린 퍼스랑 오늘은 여기까지 하는거 기대했는데.. \n아쉽군요 ㅇㅅㅇ..
너무 통제되고 평범한 느낌의 인터뷰네요.. 콜린보다 조쉬 떨려하는거 보는게 더 재밌었음
우와~ 같은 영국인이라서 그런지 몰라도 인터뷰가 굉장히 편안하셨는지 답변을 엄청 길게 해주셨네요~ 우리나라 연예방송 인터뷰와는 넘 차이나서 놀랐어요~ 조쉬님 이제 셀럽 다 되셨네요~^^ 덕분에 잘 봤어요~ 감사합니다(__)
JTBC와 영국남자 콜라보 축하해용 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ이제 TV에서도 볼수 있겠네요
어딘가모르게.. 자꾸.. 저번에 무한도전에서봤던 잭블랙이랑 겹쳐보여..;;ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
너무나 감사합니다~ 그리고 자랑스럽습니다. 수트에 대한 질문과 답변이 특히 좋았어요. 영화랑 상관없는 질문인데, 사람들이 궁금해하는 걸 잘 집어주신 것 같아요. 그리고 자연스럽고 예의바르게 응답해주시는 콜린퍼스님을 보니까 배우라는 사실을 떠나 그냥 어른으로서 참 배울 것이 많은 분이라는 생각이 드네요.
와 진짜 .... 갤러하트 사랑해요 존재해주셔서 감사합니다 ♡ ◟̊◞̊ ♡
콜린퍼스진짜 멋있음....브릿지존슨의일기에서 반했는데 ...중후하니 넘 멋져!!
좀 더 편안한 대화가 오갔으면 좋았을텐데, 여러가지 통제가 있었나봐요~ 이번 영화 관련된 이야기와 특히 수트에 대한 이야기가 너무 길어져서 ㅋㅋ 다른 이야기를 더 못한 것 같아 아쉽지만.... 조쉬 정말 고생했어요!!
한국 사람이라면 대부분 좋아하는 영국남자 요즘들어 먹방만 하는듯 한국의 문화도 즐겨 주세요 한국 민속촌 용인에 유명한 곳 있는데 맞나? 용인
이거 영상 뉴스기사도 떳어요!!ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
와 콜린퍼스... 킹스맨 영화의 연장선같다.. 진짜 젠틀 그자체
조쉬가 더 10존잘인데 확실히 유명인이니까 영국인들도 떠네
나도 자연스럽게 양복이 잘어울리게 나이들고싶다
영화 모습 그 자체시네요!!! 정말!! ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 영화 재미있게 보고 왔어요 ㅎㅎ 치킨 유머가 뭔지도 찾아보고 그랬어요 ㅋㅋ
킹스맨 보러갈때 버커킹 와퍼 하나씩 사들고 가시는거 추천드립니다
제대로 된 인터뷰를 본것 같네요.\n괜히 한국왔다고. 두유 노우 싸이.. 강남스타일? 두유 라이크 김치, 불고기..?같은 이상한 질문보다\n질문이나 답변도 편하게 자연스러운 분위기..^^\n추석 연휴에 킹스맨 골든서클 보러 갈 계획인데 더 기대가 됩니다.
콜린퍼스에게 듣는 진솔한 이야기 같은 느낌의 인터뷰인거 같아요\n그런 인터뷰를 이끌어 내준 조시에게 감사할 따름이에요!😶
아.. 콜린퍼스.. 내 평생에 꼭 한번 만나보고싶은 배우.. ㅠㅠ 대신 가주셔서 감사해요. 진짜 좋아하는 배운데..흑흑.. 완댜님 다음에 또 한국와요.. 흑흑
나는 아직도 이 아저씨를 보면 15년전에 러브 액추얼리( 아직도 내가 제일 좋아하는 영화, 50번도 더 본것 같다는..) 에서 약혼녀에게 차이고 포르투칼어 배워서 웨이트리스랑 연결되던 그 모습이 기억난다.. 그때는 영화대본이 원하면 저수지에도 뛰어들고 했는데.. 지금은 너무 거물이 되어버린.. ㅎㅎ
청소년이라 못봐 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
그 애니메이션 up 에나오는 할아버지 닮으셧어용
방금 보고왔는데 너무 재밌어요 ㅋㅋ 킹스맨 짱 영국남자 짱!!

Are you sure this is Beyoncé singing in Spanish and not some robot?
This gonna hit 1 on billboard
This is the new decpasito
beyonce music is cool, but this version of mi gente is lame, the original version with only j balvin and willy william is fire
The original is way better she’s just trying to do what Justin did with Despacito. And I think She trashed this song. Just my opinion but I know a lot of people will still like it unfortunately
How can this not be the most annoying music ever.
https://youtu.be/_0XdjBv_XtA check out my friend's new single booty his mixtape is October 13th which will have some good REAL music so Please support a artist that's spreading positivity and fun thanks in advance
The song is waaayyyy better without Beyoncé

Wish i could speak Spanish
Beyonce sang in THREE languages in this one song. Queen Bey is legend
J balvin please tell me there is a official video coming up
i don't understand it\n\nBut Beyonce singing, me likeing
Somebody please show this remix to Justin bieber😒 ......\n this is what it's suppose to sound like when an artist takes the time to learn a foreign language to interject themselves into an already hit song

HELLO FRIENDS!!! hope u guys enjoy this deep dive into a different side of the ~mannequin challenge~ (jk it's nothing like that). hope u guys enjoy! would u wear any of this? xo, saf
Love your videos Safiya <3 PLEASE wear these HIGH HEEL FLIPPERS for a day as one of your next videos!!! http://www.virtualshoemuseum.com/paul-schietekat/high-tide-heels-pro
Do a I wore only white for a week pleaseeee
They were all pretty cute except for the Zara and H&M one, in my opinion, at least. (Top Shop was a bit odd too though) :P
Where are the original people in the world. Bunch of fucking sheep that'll wear whatever the next person wears. You are all sheep and insecure as Fuck.
do a mystery box
Everything was sooo cute like she rocked them except Zara was a lil wack
This might sound weird, but those Francesca jeans make your butt look really nice! They look good on in general, but I sorta noticed the butt more.
Safiya rocked every outfit! That H&M top is life. Can anyone link me to it?
she looks so cute in that hat 😭😂
I smashed the like button \nMy screen broke \n\n\n\nHahha just kidding.
DO ANOTHER VIDEO LIKE THIS PLEASE !!!!
5:23, super stylin guy in the background!
WOAH GIRL WAIT THAT WAS MY GYM!!!!!! FIGHT ACADEMY OMG
honestly i liked all of them accept the urban outfitters one 👏🏻
I love those leather boots!!
im too fat to do that
first -  I'd say lose the jacket and hat and it'd be cute AF\nsecond - I hate the flannel with it... everything else is so cute on you, though!\nthird - what. the actual fuck. why?\nfourth - I love everything about this outfit. yes, yes, yes!\nfifth - the shirt screams 9-5 but also stripper...\nsixth - I love the dress, but the jacket is a little Elmo textured, overall, don't hate it\nseventh - I was skeptical, but I kind of love the 70s vibes!
First time I ever saw a person wear Zara's clothing in public... ( The weird clothes)
In the last outfit safiya reminds me of my old English teacher who had never been married and had about 6 cats
The Hollister outfit was surprisingly so cute! I'd wear that.
ill love to see what mannequin she would hsve choose on charlotte russe!
How does she come up with such unique n out of the box ideas...the other fashion and lifestyle youtubers have got to really take notes from her...Great work Safiya!!!
The Zara outfit is what I hope my final evolution will be when I'm in my 70s-80s.
Loooooved it!!!!!! You should do the same for winter2017 and then every season 2018 jajajaja rocked everything!
As a former SM at forever 21 -  denim, 70's and jewel tones have been the trend for 6 years and yes, spot on Safiya, that is exactly why they dress the mannequins that way - shocking outfits actually help bring customers in - in case you were curious :-)
She made a good decision to start her own YouTube channel.
they even have the h&m mannequin in germany 😂
this is a good idea!! i want to do this!!
You looked so good in all the outfits!!
My husband said the only thing your look from Urban Outfitters needs is a couple dozen cats.
Obsessed with the Zara fit!! You look so cool in all of them!
Requested video: getting things done at the mall like waxing, eyebrow threading, mani/pedi, and your experience going through it compared to outside the mall at the same price range! And also, maybe the conversations we have while getting these things done? Hopefully they allow you to film them lol\n\nBtw, at the time of watching this, you're #27 on trending :D <3
You should do a haul of all of your HP merch
a giant lsd taking friend of a muppet 😂😂😂
Can someone link the 7th day shoes from top shop please ❤️
OMG I love that shot of her walking across the street in those heels... and the way she looked back was so fierce !! I love her !!
I inspire to have ur creativity!
I think if la was not that warm f21 did make an outfit of on the mannequin.\nThe usual black n blue was really nice
I feel like all these style are korea 2015
The black top is giving me life!
You should do a 'Buying slime off wish' video
I actaully loved all the outfits except for the day 5 one
When i was little my mom would take me to justice and i would try to buy all the stuff on the mannequins and then my mom wouldnt let me get any of it and then we would just go home with some ugly shirt that i didnt want
11:40 daria from MTV all grown up
Holy fuck this chick has like a 90% subscriber to view count conversion rate, how in the hell??
That theory you have at the beginning where you guess that stores don't put stuff together to make them outfits for ppl to wear out is dead on. We just want ppl to see a thing they like and come in. You have to make it ~somewhat~ put together but we currently have a mannequin with a cheerleader-like skirt, very bright patterned leggings that have some red to match, and a long sleeve white shirt with a bunch of logos all over it. Anyone that wears that will look like a 40 year old mom thats trying to relive her high school cheerleader days.
Is anyone else starting to notice all the wish ads?
LOVE YOU SAF! 🖤 seriously you rocked all these outfits! Work it girl!
I didnt masturbate for a week...\nWhere's my 2.6m views.
Could you do a challenge that for one week you wear each day just one colour outfit for example: one day you wear an orange shirt with an orange bottom and also oranges shoes and some orange accessories if you want to. And you the same for the others but you picked an other colour? Idk if it makes sens but anyways. I’m sorry I don’t speak English and it’s terrible 😂
I love your videos, you're so funny and you do your research! I value your opinion Saf
The last outfit was very Hillary Clinton circa 1970s
The day 2 outfit looks like youre in a music video
Can you do a review on ROMWE please
do a guys and girls version of this with Tyler
Does anybody know where her black bag pack is from when she was doing the Hollister outfit ?
i'd wear any of those outfits 😂😂
fuk that zara fit is so good
This video should just be called wearing clothes for a week
Is there gonna be some merch dropping soon lol. I’d love me some Saf merch 💕💕
I would wear the hollister outfit cuz im basic 💖😂
You got some balls waring those outfits in public :-)
I worked at a retail store. And our branding manager once told me she just puts up some of the least bought stuff (uglier stuff) on the Mannequin to catch shoppers attention.
Damn I wish I had the money to do this 🤦🏽‍♀️
Okay the topshop outfit was ADORABLE! I actually loved it
I loved those outfits omg I'm going to start using mannequins for fashion inspo
I love the top shop outfit on you
You look good in everything lol
The Francesca's look was the most minimal and elegant by far. But there's something about the Zara outfit I really enjoyed haha
I got a Wish ad before this video...
Typical woman 14 minute video talk for 7 & a half minutes not very interesting.
Forever 21: Always changing and always in style`just screams FAST FASHION, which has a horrible impact on the earth. Not to mention their horrible sweatshops...
I need the shirt from top shop omg
All the outfits look so good on you !!
You should do I bought all my groceries at the dollar store
The free wish phone case that came with the  water proof bag was meant for moments like when you dropped your purse in the water 7:12 😹
Did anyone notice she was right outside of l00se change pop shop!?
I cannot find the holo beanie and I need it!
I chose this outfit from urban outfitters because it was literally the only manikin in the store\n\n3:25
I can't believe you got AmazingPhil to wear that big brown fluffy coat! AND THEY WATCH YOUR CHANNEL
2:28 Safiya looks really cute and reminds me of Bernard the elf from the Santa Clause movies
Am I the only person that loved the look from Zara? Guess so
I bet she returned most of those clothes😂
DO ANOTHER ONE
wish vs primark?
I skinned elmo 😅😂😂
shopping
cutest couple ever!
I'd wear that holo beanie for forever21. Holllooooooo
shes got that kpop hat from forever 21

The topshop outfit was beautiful.
Francescas outfit was defiently my favorite!
Yay trending yay
H&M, easy to find, easy to buy Bish.
The Hollister look was very Charli XCX
Awesome concept😍
It looks like a sponge :)
Nice. It comes pre-fried.
Coyote I got your book!Please respond on one of your videosAlso please give me a shout out please I love you
what i would give to have his job
I'm not happy that the frog fish were disrupted from their natural environment. Abducting animals from their homes seem cruel.
Wow man. Bad bad bad. Please never ever take fish out of our waters! I know you're trying to do good, but this time it was bad. You could have easily killed these delicate fish. We dive here all the time. I was wondering why the frog-fish got so scarce. We didn't see these two for many weeks after you removed them from the water.\n\nAgain, I mostly like what you do, but this time you crossed the line. Please assure me that you won't do this again!\nr
Anyone else see him in Christine's video
You should get hit by a mantis shrimp, probably get lots of views
The dialogue about the environment and species is really impressive. Coyote should become a writer.\n*Oh wait...*
you said the frog fish breaths through its gills but the gills are coverd by skin  and doesnt look like they have normal gills?\ni saw this immediatly when i saw the fish and your an animal expert??? after a simple check up i found the WATER JETS  are exactly what i thought ,they arnt water jets they are gill openings as the normal gill slots are actually coverd,if the water goes in it has to come out . \nheres a nice simple image you can rember ten mins before you do a show!\nhttps://goo.gl/images/c5V5xf
Coyote try to catch a parrot fish
this guy is the most savage person in the world
I realized this earth is the only beautiful thing in the world and it inhabits beautiful animals and we must treat the world with respect 😃😇
Not cool man leave it  alone just video it up close.  no need to mess his or her life up
Does anyone else keep forgetting Coyote had no hair? I mean he's good looking anyways. \n\nI just adore how he treats the animals with such a careful air. Gentle and all despite how dangerous that animal is.
I'm Coyote Peterson, And I'm about to enter the strike zone, With My parents after seeing my grades
In 5:44 you can see his eye do a weird thing but it is funny
Try stroking it on the back
I'm coyote Peterson, and I'm about to enter the drink zone...  with the Gineau worm eggs.
you should go to vancouver island looking for sea wolves
You should do a video on the coral snake versus the king snake and why they are different
Aquatic creatures are the best :)
Is that in the same family with stonefish
I'll let you pet Mr.Whiskers
I love frog fish, they are cool. There like jets with there propulsion system!
You should do something with a crab spider
wow my teacher is just like you! I am definitely telling him (My Teacher) about you and I'm going to say that you are kid friendly and you teach us bizarre things that we didn't even know about!😀Keep up the great work!👍
btw i love your name
Wow fish monster. Anyway I would like to see families and all people focus less on DISTRACTING THEMSELVES WITH FOOTBALL / SPORTS TO MUCH with all it's related drinking alcohol and over stuffing there big bellies with more meat 🍖 than they could ever hope to digest (which leads to overly high acidity levels causing mucus which causes an obstruction to the flow ie the body's ability to clean itself to maintain health - then leading to CANCER , which is on the rise) and focus more towards LOVE ❤️, there children and spouses, unity leading naturally to a better life for everyone. Please everyone try to start seeing that the medical industry only profits from keeping people sick.  I know it sucks to think the doctors are in on it but it sucks more to see children born sick and 1 of 2 people getting cancer now. Eat more fresh organic fruits and vegetables uncooked and fell your energy rise and your head clear and your weight balance out back to normal. Watch 10 or 20 videos of the life-regenerator on YouTube and take a look at DrMorseND in Florida videos on YouTube although he talks fast because his videos are for doctors of his naturopathic school, however Dan Macdonald liferegenerator on YouTube is fun and on point. Peace everyone 🙏🌿🍊💕
give discovery things a shout please love your vids.your videos inspired me to start a adventure channel with my brother.thank you keep doing what you do
Having Mark pet this fish brings me so much joy, I love how these guys interact with one another such a great dynamic among the crew. Truly great part of the show.
Coyote Peterson I would love to become on a trip with you I'm an owner of four pets
Coyote, try to catch a mantis shrimp and a pistol shrimp. Those guys are cool shrimps

congratulations on getting onto the trending list!!!
DaveHax has a beard and glasses! ( reflection on pot lid)
Hello again Dave I love your life hacks they really seem interesting
This is so stupid lol
DON'T YOU NEVER EVER EAT A APPLE LIKE THIS YOU SICK FREAK!
I remember in my elementary school some kids would stab there oranges with their strays and try to get the juice.
I'm so damn hungry
I try it home
Lol ain't nobody got time to bake apple!!
I dont even know what a crumble is
We all know for well we ain't getting out of bed to go do this, or if I can do it at all.
You can see his face at 1:36
Don't you wash the apples
Generic royalty free background music ✅\nEnglish dude talking over shots of the main focus of the video ✅\nLife hack ✅\n\nCongratulations, you have made it on trending.
Would you eat an apple like thGALLIUM SPINNERS
I challenge you to a acne hax video bruh
I shudder every time you say pretty cool, huh? Stop it Dave!
Did he say Tong??? Is he racist
Next on davehax : how to make a gallium apple crumble fidget spinner life hack
For stewed apples, you don’t need to boil the apples.\n\nI just cut apple into quarters (using apple cutter which takes the core away)\nPut in MICROWAVE for around 5-8 mins (depending on amount of apples. 4 apples = around 8 mins.) \n\nWallah!
This man sounds like a robot
If he was Canadian he would say pretty cool ah
Go to 1:36 you will see daves face
I ate an apple with a spork (fork and spoon together)before what’s the deal? (Saw thumbnail)
My nan has buckets full of apples, we’ll definitely be trying this ‼️ love it ‼️❤️❤️❤️
WHY NOT HOLLOW OUT THE APPLES FIRST, THEN USE WHAT IS SCOOPED OUT IN THE RECIPE???? NOW THAT'S A HACK!!!!
Instructions not clear, ended up with a hole in my penis.
Difference between a life hack and a tutorial, no percise measurements.
call this a food hack in front of ramsay,i dare you...
a life hack to eat an apple? Wow thanks i was wondering what thoes were for!
I clicked on this video because I thought it was a hack.\n\nNope.
Goddamn i hate that stock YouTube background music  >.>
They look terrible
Those are some ugly apples,
1. Why is this trending?\n2. WHY UKELELE
Difficult to watch on an empty stomach...
THAT SUPER CRINGY BACKGROUND MUSIC THO I HATE IT
Can i mix if with a spoon or just my fingers?
*sees thumbnail*\nHold it right there I’m calling the police
1:56 it’s like you’re about to carve a apple lol
No I wouldn't eat an apple like that because I don't like apples.
What's so special about these? I've done these before..
D don't you know gods of death love apples
No sir I would rather eat a regular apple
My best friend eats apples like that.
There is no such thing as too much topping when it comes to a crumble.
Omg 1:36 i saw ur face!!!!
Next time add a bit of butter on top aswell, it will golden the crumble
Or you can just eat it normally
I hate the music this is in every tutorial
well done to this *_3 dimensional carbon based life form_* for achievement thy art of the \n\n*_APPLE CRUMBLE_*
Looks tasty
Wait so how is this a life hack? .. its just a recipe. ...

Is it just me or does this guy sound like a robot?
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
No
Please make more awesome videos on corporations & companies! They’re by far my favorite 👌🏻 Videos on countries & technology are also highly interesting.
Thanks for the 'CATS' ad...💚
Not many people know it, but Kraft is an empire.
Wallmart is not the largest employer in the world !
Why was there a Toyota logo on a Mazda RX8...?
Bill gates is no longer the richest man in the world its Jeff Bezos
Samsung gotta be bigger. They make appliances, apples CPUs and screens, their own phones, tablets, tvs, computers, laptops, headphones, they own a bunch of shit too
The East India Company had its own Army, Navy and controlled a large part of India. That's pretty scary!
I think it would have been good to name at lease like one Chinese company like Alibaba so People learn something completely new to them
Last I knew Lipton Teas were a product of PepsiCo not Unilever
Where's indian corporation?
I live where uni was made
Now T.I.S has caught the corolla virus xd
Source on Microsoft employees? I visited there and was told by employees that 105K employees exist in just Redmond WA
this is a great video subscribing but hey i bet amazon take the leading spot over walmart i can tell
I've never seen McDonald's employees that happy
Yeah, we all know Disney rules the world.
Should have thrown in Trump and Tesla for comparison.
I don't have a Facebook, or a twitter.
That CATS ad in the beginning made me not want to watch the video anymore. Thumbs down
I'm just very interested in seeing Amazon take down all stores like Walmart, Target and other department stores like them. It's definitely going to happen, just no clue how long it will take
We all know its McDonald's
I'm surprised that with the political clout they have and how they have monopolized the food industry that the companies Monsanto & DuPont were not on this list. An oversight perhaps??
(Reads Video Title)\nIt's Oscorp Industries obviously
Goldman Sachs is the real answer
This many corporations is bad. With this many people in the world i would like to see small businesses take over in their own part of the world
I was watching this video and then he said nestle then I realized oh shit I’m drinking nestle water
Where is the logic when a company is valued at less than 50% of their revenue for the year. The market is crazy and unreliable!
I’m just wondering, where’s the gasoline giant market ?
England's 2nd largest city is Birmingham
Great video! My guess was either Google or Goldman Sachs
FaceBook estimated value of approximately five hundred million is wrong. FaceBook is not worth that much...except if many of the other businesses in this video are also valued as, measuring value of opportunities by what is in the lives of who are, too big to fail (what they use to get what they need).
Qualcomm isn't know very widely but is the second richest company behind apple.
I don't know how you looked at the wikipedia page for Microsoft and learned that they only employ 18000 people. It clearly states they have over 100000 at least.
Toyota corollas? Let me call my friend over here...
This is most famous companies, not most powerful. The only tech companies up there should be Microsoft/Google/Samsung, the rest are just a trendy bubble. Facebook & Apple is literally nothing.
they will all fall...
I think BlackRock should've been on the list. It controlls 5.5 trillion US$.
Three Corporations run the world: The City of London, Washington DC and Vatican City. The Unholy Trinity.
UK's second largest city is Birmingham...
Probably the kardashian brand which owns mass amounts of clothing lines, perfumes, shows, products, makeup, and enormous social media following. They also dominate relevance in Hollywood always being the center of attention.
I think there's a mistake in the number of employees mentioned for Microsoft. Clearly it has more than 250,000 employees.

Population of Manchester is just over 700,000 and it's the 3rd highest population in England.
E Corp of course
Mega corporations are only good when they have competition otherwise they have free reign to do whatever the hell they want without fear since there is no one else supplying the same service.(cough internet providers cough) This also only applies if we find a fuel alternative for oil otherwise mega corporations would literally be impossible in the next 30 years.
Obviously YouTube, millions of videos per day
I watched this while on break in McDonald’s
How does Lego compare? It's been listed above companies like Apple in the past by others like Forbes for most powerful.
i think a good video would be USA vs commonwealth
Walmart has 2.3 million employees and only 15 checkouts open.
Bill gates isn't the richest man in the world.
Indian rail and the nhs are the largest non military employers. And Birmingham is the uks second largest city.
Wowthat is cool you should see my videos on my channel CJ Collins
Complaining about corporations while watching on YouTube (google) on an iPhone

Above this is \n-The Rotschild bank\nThe second in Europe was the AXA group, a huge part of the Rothschild bank since the 9/11 attacks thanks to De Castries.
Down with the bourgeoisie!
Corporations maximize profits regardless of the social, economic and environmental costs. Congress has refused to regulate them. They are powerful. They have a lot of influence. I like what they create, but hate how they create it and why they create it.

Wtf do statistics have to do with power? Power is not a 1 dimensional thing. Nestle is probably one of the most powerful because billions of people literally depend on them for food

How I wish he wasn't gay. May the peace of God be upon him though
Man listens to this auto tune hip hop but bangs this through the aux on the way to pick up low key tho

ตอนลาสวัสดีเหมือนคนไทยเลย
除了美妙的歌聲, 我另外在意:\n1.\n太過隨意過份傻男上班族式的穿著?(還內衣外袖口外露? 西褲黑皮帶格子衫?)\n是否為了只讓觀眾將重點放在歌聲?\n\n2.\n這現場樂手及和聲的控制, 超級精準.\n\n3.\n收音太美, 乾淨而圓潤有彈性, 某些尾聲的ECHO是現場調音的話, 實在太強.\n拜託那個可惡到每次都把歌手聲音收音吸到乾淨變成肉乾的陳建騏可不可以學一下?
una locura este tipo
Perfect voice <3
His so unique❤❤
I love u
Oh Sam ❤️

HIS SMILE IS SO ADORABLE
How is this funny or entertaining? And how on earth is she famous because of this? Even my nan's dead body has more charisma than Lele Pons.\n\nI even made a video about her last month on my channel. So unfunny.
After this video I am tempted to watch Ethan Hunt free climbing that mountain in MI2 peace
how could she get through the little circle in the window
Was i supposed to laugh ?
Wasn't he on Sofia Carson's ins and outs music vid?
Oh!  It's trending on #25 right now. 😆
oh no I'm finished with the channel :(
Only thing I liked about this video: Twans hair
whats the song at the end?
Lele when are u going to do a Q&A with friends
haha\nderrr it has to be twan\njk IT SHOULD BE JUANPA
WTH is up with her nail
Is this supposed to be funny?
Aww man I wish I was your crush ):
Lele should do a video could the perfect handshake  pls like if u read this I never get likes I like my self pretty sad 😞😫😓
Yes I will so your HOMEWORK LOL I'M DYING THEN NON NO NO NO NO NO  LELE I'M DYING OVER HERE
What happen to you Lele Pon you use to be better.
This video is so LIT, one of my dreams is to make videos like you! But I’m not really funny like you :(
LELE: Suzan is not my name. I love your videos, you remind me of a spoiled, rich Cali girl i knew from oceanside. My name is Elektra - NOT Suzan! You do a great job by the way! 😂
Do you think People have her notifications on just so they can comment “not funny” and not even have watched the video?
I actually found this funny
Am I supposed to laugh? Or?
I thought this was funny ! Twan though 😍😂
*SLOW CLAPS......*\n\nTHIS WAS THE BEST VIDEO I SEEN ALL WEEK. \n\n\n\n\n😐\n*-SMDH WTF IS THIS SHIT-*

I love you lele too much because you’re my favorite YouTube

LELE TELL DANNAMPAIKID THAT I SAID NEVER HIT U WITH THAT BIG RUBBER BAND EVER AGAIN
What kind of person actually thinks this is funny?
He said its time for his lunch... It's night😂😂
I laughed so hard when the girl Yelled on the phone crazy
Not funny at all
I would have said that's not me that's my twin my identical twin
lol can you make a part 2😍😍🤣
I would class this as shit porn.
I’ve stopped laughing a while ago. Does she read comments or does she not know what’s funny any more?
Lele, I'm starting to notice a pattern. It seems you're starting to run low on ideas, so try this one on for size. You should do a skit contest! But in the in, you'll know what to do.
Lele Can you put Arabic from video subtitles as Anwar does?
If you don't like someone's vids stop arguing
can you make a new video pls!!!!!
I dare u to pin this
I KNOW IT WOULD, AMAZING!
Has she ever been funny?
F U C K Y O U < 3 !

So disapointed, typical pop trash. They used to be on such a unique level then they come out with this
This is fucking washed.  Krept has always been some butters talentless mutant.. and as for Konan..\n\nThese 2 must have been smoking some high grade when they made this dead tune.  \n\nIt goes absolutely nowhere.
Nice song but not for me
What a load of shite
Hey guys! There's a little corolla easter egg somewhere in here, so hopefully I didn't make it too obvious! Also like I stated in the video, I live in Texas and I personally know people who have been affected by Hurricane Harvey. This means a lot to me, so if you want to help out with relief efforts here, in Puerto Rico or in Florida (or anywhere else) consider downloading Tab For a Cause completely for free; http://tab.gladly.io/r/reallifelore. You guys are always amazing :)
Hey I live in Texas! Austin
And thus we have the Commonwealth afterwards\n\nEver seen a ram grow claws and become armored?\n\nEver see a cockroach grow as big as a fucking cinder block?\n\nWhat about a scorpion that can dig to the core of the earth?
What would happen if you nuked a super volcano?
Dropping a nuclear bomb into a hurricane......bad idea
Thank god I live in Canada middle of nowhere
A modern ICBM could obliterate it, and everyone else on this side of the planet
This is how\nCtrl A\nBackspace
Katrina: LOL IM SO REKTLESS\nSandy: Ehh, I did ok\nKatrina:Ya Ya, You did good...\n*Some one walks in*\nSandy: Who are you\nIrma: Hold my beer..\n*5 mins later*\nKatrina: ._.\nSandy: GG m8\nIrma: Where's my beer?
I say lets do it. I hope it starts the apocalypse​.
way to pollute the water 😞
I’m in Houston too I feel your pain buddy
You cannot stop it.
It’s not like you’d want to stop them anyways.  They serve an important role in dissipating energy that has accumulated in the oceans...
I live in Texas Austin
This person is asking the right questions
if u nuke a hurricane your fucking retarded
So, around 100 hurricanes did damage similar to financial damage that USA did to middle east in last 10 years?
All thoses peoples who loss their houses and lives is a tragic story...\nbut thoses multiples hurricanes may make trump change his mind about Paris Treates
Trump really is considering it then huh?
This is how America solves there problems \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe drop fucking nukes
I'm going to guess before i watch nothing to the storm but really bad for fallout.\n\nEdit: totally nailed that prediction
How many nukes would it take to move the planet??
Im going to make the worst idea I can. Step one get everyone to throw shit in the ocean, like a lot of shit (items not shit). When the hurricane comes along it gets bamboozled into thinking its hit land ( this will work because hurricanes don't have the best eye sight seeing as they only have one eye.) When it hits land it will use up all of its energy on random scraps. Step 2: watch your car and coffee table save the country.
My guess is that it explodes
How to turn an educational video into an ad
Korea:Why dont we test to find out?
I don’t get drop the Toyotas into them one.
its obviously the hurrican will be vaporize by the nuke lol
Even before I watched I thought that the fallout and radiation would follow with hurricane
Geostorm trailer popped up as an ad for this video.Wow
pls make a video on what if all south asian countries united along with Tibet and myanmar pls pls pls pls pls \na request from your fan
That tab for a cause thing is really amazing tbh like that's how we should always raise money especially that it's free like it should be an app thing
Man that hurricane jutsu is good wish I knew the hand signs
Nothing the wind will come back and firm again
Just use large grounding rods with grounding wires directly attached to the bottom of the ocean every 300 miles from Africa westward. Tesla already discovered why and we built trans ocean cables so its not impossible
Well we solved our energy problems\n\nJust harness the energy from the hurricane
Irma literally only killed 20 people ... and none of the houses were doestroyed.... it was a category 1 , 150 billion in damage my ass, I was in my house playing video games during the hurricane until the power went out... don't donate, I was homeless once, I stayed at the salvation army shelter and the city of miami was paying for my stay, not your donations, they wanted to throw me out because I tried to sneak in a kit Kat bar... it's all for money...
Yeah just fuck up the habitat of the area, causing a chain reaction of harmful affects on surrounding habitats.
I managed to get my whole district of schools to start using tab for a cause and that means that every school in my district + charter and private schools has tab for a cause on all of their computers,that means all elementary schools, middle schools, highschools,and k-12 schools have it downloaded on their computers.
stupid solutions!!! i guess the one who made this video is not meteorologist
So I can open 100298323792720226201 tabs and HALP people:O OMQ
One problem at a time let’s cure cancer first
So this is what I watch at 1am
Here's a crazy thought let's put a big windmill but to catch waves for energy. Use the hurricane for energy.
How to stop a hurricane! \nIt's simple pray to Jesus Christ! \nJesus Christ always answer  My prays
Like throwing sharks in a hurricane
Ah, the true questions that we should be asking...
Here's a good question. If you are in a airplane and you fly at the speed the wind of a hurricane is traveling does the plane stall because there isn't air being pushed through the motor? I know that it would suck up air so you would have to fly even slower than the wind I think so that the force of wind pushing by is greater than the force of the motor trying to suck it up. If you where flying that slow though you probably be flying at all, you'd be falling. And since a plane creates lift by moving forward into the air, you'd again be falling because there was not lift but what if this scenario could happen?
Chill yo balls bro i live in houston
Is that Top 5 lost at 0:50 a joke? Half those seem like a joke
I found it when you were showing options to stop hurricane
Your voice is weird.
Sure. Let's stop a natural disaster by mixing a hurricane with a nuclear fallout.
So you're telling me I can watch porn and donate to organizations at the same time
I love how they've had three hurricanes and yet the U.S. Government still refuses to acknowledge climate change.
I honestly thought that the nuke was a good idea but now after this video.. I feel so fucking stupid.. I really really do.. thumbs down 👎🏾
(Me before watching the vid)\n“WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?!”\n\nAnd upside down tsunami?
Nope! Wouldn't do a fucking thing.
It won't work this was talked about years ago if they do that the hurricane will spinning to three hurricanes
This would be really really bad...
You Americans one day will learn dropping a nuke on something actually doesn’t solve every problem
Yeah if 200mph winds weren't enough let's send 200mph nuclear winds at them!
Dude, Hiroshima is NOT pronounced her•oe•sh•i•ma
When he said he lived in Texas and added that sybol on the map and just then I heard a crash so I looked outside and when I looked up I say a giant pink windmill cover everything near me.
Plot twist: the hurricane throws the nuke back
Just drop my mixtape on it.
That's like adding fire to fire ...
I like the tab for a cause I don't know how it works but i cant do it because the only computer i have is for school but i wush i could
I think of hurricanes as earth taking a shower to kill people that are polluting it. Lol
Do what if we Nuke the sun
This shit is so American it's beautiful
Here's an idea: Don't spill oil into the fucking ocean
How does opening a tab do anything???
Wake tf up guys. Mother nature is with hurricane Matthew,harvy,Irma and Jose and god know what else.
Just delete your world and start again. You never know when griefers will grief you.
Hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons are the same fucking god damn thing dumbass
How u come up with this shit
Do your next video on SpaceX
Nah this will never happen the hurricanes we have nowadays are from haarp
Hey what about a video about what if NATO members became one country

The Frankfort school was to destroy America :know that just like the Jew lead blacks into wanting to gangbang sell drugs and kill' through paying some big money to shuck and juvie' like NWA 2pac chef keef JayZ and many others' who chose to lead there people into the dark' for a life of riches' based on lies and destruction of there own people'..yup he would know that the honest pro whites are exposing the mass control the Jew has in media Hollywood and collage university's .. and he would know that the Jews are using the blacks to try to choke out the white mans truth because he is trying to wake everyone up to the false reality' that  is being drilled into your mind-all day everyday..
Okay I change my mind I'm going to take away the dislike because you are like the female PewDiePie. And that's okay because you use his voice and I respect your sub count so people must like you

The Dolan twins. YAYAYAY😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
But my desire to hear the end of this story is so strong.
Oh my god, I just imagined how I'd feel, if I can't watch movies anymore. So sorry Casey :/
I had to stop running after I left the Army, so I started walking instead.  Nothing like training in  full combat battle gear running in Vietnam boots on hard asphalt  to fuck your knees, hip and back.  Be happy your'e alive man and your kids are healthy.
I want to get into running like this.
That lowercase i pisses me the fuck off
Did you try putting It in Rice?
running on hard ground isn't very healthy and you did for sooooo long
On a serious note...if you would like a second opinion...the radiologist I work for is a top sports and muskuloskeletal radiologist. She is here in SF. Her name is Sonja Moelleken, M.D. if you want to check her credibility. She reads MRIs for professional athletes as well. Good luck Casey I hope for a good result that will allow you to continue running. 🙏
SERIOUSLY ? you would think he was going through something Catastrophic something mortal something ah! never mind not going to go there dude brighten up Man Up there are alternatives to this why all the hyperbole ? how does your wife deal with you
Is that truely the sound your knee is making?  Your meniscus is shot.  Maybe you could benefit from a new grown meniscus.  If not then be a proponent of this technology.
man I hope you will be beter and can run again! can't wait to hear the results. be strong man!
Oh boo hoo, just get into speed walking like a real man.
Run all you like we only live once 🏃🏃🏃🏃
This is a story I never wanted to tell buuuuuuttttt unfortunately i need money
Hey Casey. My heart goes out to you. As someone who has had 14 knee surgeries, all I can tell you is be strong. Only you can decide if running is over for you. Be strong, be safe, be persistent.
Have you tried turning it off and on?
Sorry to hear that Casey, hope you're ok :(
Song at the end is called Da Juju by hurley mower.\nIt is not on soundcloud tho.
Hey, now I know someone that their knees make the same sound too, and sadly one day I got badly injured on one knee, but fast forward 6 years later my knee healed up enough to feel little to no pain. I can still run 🏃wished people would hear my story too. And not just from a celebrity....
This video made my knees hurt.
LOL don't remember if I had commented this earlier but watching it for the second time, and I have to say this is one of the best youtube videos I have seen for a while!
Welcome to the world.
Terry Fox did it, I believe in you and that you can too
Same problem. Minimalism and barefoot saved my life
Why am I watching this..... I can't even run for 10 minutes without dying
I hope there is a fix for this.  Love you Casey, you inspire true affection from me and I just want you to be ok.  Side note, I am forever impressed with the artistic value of every one of your videos.  From the angles, to the colour desaturation to the truth behind the words.  Thank you for letting us into your life.  All the best to you and your family.
I feel the same way riding my bicycle
My poor dad loves running. He  would run 10-15 miles to warm up in the morning, he runs 50 ad 100 mile races for fun. His poor back was injured when he was a snowboarder a long time ago, and it came back to haunt him. He’s in constant pain and nothing helps. All he wants to do is run.
What are you running from?
The amount of negative comments about Casey is getting a bit out of hand...can someone explain why so many people hate him? I find him to be a well-dedicated vlogger who loves his job and family.
He put his running shoes in the desc...
I have the same problem on both legs, went to a doctor, got some tests and... I got nothing on my knees.
I personally don't understand what people get out of that much running. To each his own though. The mere fact that he is so damn passionate about running makes me feel lazy, and that motivates me to get more shit done in my life. For that I thank you Casey. I hope you can still run like you want to. Peace.
I don't know if it is available for humans but i watch a series in the UK called the super vet, where they take a tiny piece of cartilage from the affected joint and use it to grow new cells (cartilage) in a lab.  Then they inject them back into the joint where they continue to grow new cartilage.
Hi I’m 15 and I have Arthritis
I recently tore my ACL I know how you feel. Injuries suck
Hello Bike Friday, you do know they make a Tandem. Who sells Rowing Machines ?
Damn dude my knee sounds the same for awhile now and I already had one surgery.......
But when you over come this you will get this too tattoo'd on you, same as you have before with all of the other challenges that you have faced before. You got this Casey!
Please don’t let this change the person you are casey!
Lol no I don't I just noticed that
Wait... he runs Ironmans? Damn he's insane. He should make an episode on that.
today i turn 21 and i am still virgin !!
Hey Casey. You forgot to add to the list Samsung Gear S3 Frontier. Nice looking watch. Be safe, buddy:)
I'm 16 and I hurt my knee, in may. And my parents told me the bills were to much, and we were going to have to wait another time to have me knee checked out. We have yet to go to the doctor but someday we will. I don't want attention, I just want you to know you got to power through it even if it sucks, just know you could be in a worst place.
This is the reason I swim everywhere
just get a robot leg. fuck that human leg
I am currently recovering from two broken heel bones. I haven't walked in three months and have been on crutches for the past two weeks. I have got two more weeks on crutches til I can try to walk unassisted. Injuries really do impact people's lives more than most realize this injury has ruined what I loved to do physically forever and has taken a toll on me emotionally As well. Won't let it get me down though and anyone else going through trauma or injury shouldn't either. We can overcome anything no matter how much the odds are stacked against us!
Sorry for all the haters. I can't stand running but I understand the risk of losing something that you can lose yourself in. We all need that outlet and once we lose it some of us do go crazy.
You should be character on next GTA V Add-On. You remind somehow the game (in good way) x-]    And its nice to see Genuine happy person like you. (Not to label every F...ing people who is normal and hard working guy to label him/her. Bibolar And give them lithium and other poison its All DOWN HILL FROM THERE.)   Opioids are yeah ...epidemic but its nothing to compare to Psychiatry drugs. Which ruin Life's and causes death,without overdose or abuse  (you cant abuse trash)  But anyway keep on the good job and positivity.    We are feel so bad at times and good too. RESEARCH CURE FOR REAL DISEASES Like Parkinson,Alzheimers, MS,Als.  Not some Pseudo- Billion  $ drugs whitch dont help anyone in a long run, and then you are trapped. Manic is a feeling. (AND WITHOUT SOME STIMULANTS, ETC OTHER BAD Drugs) You will never go psychotic   i hope everybody who is trapped in that cycle Knows that YOUVE BEEN ABUSED,Not your fault and you can get your neurons Back FROM THOSE TOXICS. .. just ween yourself slow DOWN slow slow down .. and  when you can add exercise and real medicine like MMj.  YOU WANNA BE YOU WANNA DO YOU WANNA MAKE IT BACK TO YOU!! Youre worth it. :-) PEACE!
The same thing happened to my grandfather on a far worse scale, he broke his neck and they told him he would never walk again, well he decided he did not care and he kept trying and trying, and guess what he’s been walking around nearly perfect ever since.
You can run like forest Gump
You could always switch to cycling man. My father has no acl or cartilage in his right knee and he has been riding without any pain for about 25 years. He had a similar experience as yours when he couldn't ski anymore, and since has been fulfilling that role with cycling. All the best for your recovery man, good luck!
hope you’re okay man! good luck!
My dad's cartilage wore down in his knee and he ended up having to get it replaced, but he still runs every day. he's 60, so you'll definitely pull through!
Can you get a prosthetic leg? If running means that much to you would you consider it as an option?
Read this Casey!!! I thought my knees will never heal after a accident, but I started drinking Magnesium Chloride, and 3 months after...No more knees cracking, no more pain and i was amazed! now. I always reccomend it ❣ try it❣❣❣ it is the best of life for your body and is healthy and natural. I hope you do it.
Casey the type of neistat to get a robotic leg and remove the company logo and spray paint it white to make a sick custom
Not to be-littel the news Casey, but you never really understand the it is that creates passion and obsession until we loose the ability to indulge into it. As well, something important we need to see about ourselves always resides at the root of obsession and passion. Hopefully you won't have to forgo your greatest passion, but if you do, I suggest you observe what you experience, as it will provide you the opportunity to see something that will help you to appreciate and benefit from your passions in a new and even better way.   \nHoping for the best man.
This is why I lift.
Get off the internet ya rich fuck
Well if you knew about running g it fucks your knees and ankles up real bad so yer just saying walking is better :D and also In the title you put finding out you may never run again can you explain why you have a neck brace on??? Lol
That crack at the beginning 😬
If Casey can't run I can't run
I had retinal detachment last year and went through three surgeries within eight months. Before my first surgery I loved running. Just like you said, it kept me sane. It could clear my mind like nothing else could. After my first eye surgery I realized I could probably never run again because of how serious the situation was. When I was recovering I realized what a huge part of my life running was. I missed it so much and at times could not calm down when I remembered I can't run because of the eye. It's been a year and a half since the last time I ran. But fortunately enough I went back to the gym and started working out.
Casey is such a beast
Been a while since I last dipped into a video but holy shit I forgot how well put together your content is. \n\nAlso, I hope the knee thing works out man.
Do what you can’t!!! Sounds like a cool video I saw...
I love running. Distracts me from everything. News that I would never be able to run again would be heartbreaking. I hope it’s all good for you casey!
He takes risk now he cant run ........ LOGIC ( not a hate comment )
I've been mountain biking for years, I'm 33 and just found out I have osteoarthritis in my right hip. My cycling days are over! :(
Casey we have faith in you
Why the fuk would someone like running..
No way.... putting a ton of pressure on your knees over and over and over again for years and your cartilage is gone? Say it ain’t so... 😒
Casey you inspire me to run everyday
Is it bad that I am 14 and every time i do what Casey does at the beginning of the video my knees crack every time
put it in a bag of rice
I have that knee crackling is that normal 😯
Have you tried putting it in rice?
I wish I could never have the runs again.
Keep killin it homie
HAHAHAHA FUCK YOU
Kiss it better
Run Casey run!
Jerk!
Fuck the dislikers.
I understand Casey!!!
1 like pray for Casey
Suck it up buttercup!

fred is ded
Waiting for that -puss- yiay
Jub jub want rub rub
Wait this isn't accurate, you made up Ron! He's not in the books!
Harry Potter is lame and so are the fans
pausing the video and reading each page is hilarious
How many times do you want to change the thumbnail and title John?
The way I cried when I read jub jub wants rub rub wasn't healthy
Guys only two more months until a new ygs (your grammar suck's)
Um, Mr. McFacto, may I make a request? I would love to see a Top 10 Top 10 Videos Video. I think that we can all agree that this video is kind of quality content that YouTube 2017 deserves.
His forehead isn't even that big
How the actual fuck did you not die when you said jub jub want a rub rub?
Hey, Boy McFacto, tell Jacksfilms that he's late on his October 1st YIAY for the images. We all know he is usually late but you can't give us a set day and be late......
Eeeeeehhhh, Jack!  This video is #37 on the trending list!  Aren't you proud?
Jiggle Joe wasn't even on this list...Blimey!
I would read your Harry Potter fan fiction, truly moving
I read the book when I was 12 I would have let Sirius lick me clean
This is like a clickhole article I love it
I love that Jub Jub is still there even when he's supposed to be dead
I'm still in denial about Jub Jub's death
I thought he was about to pull a “my name is Jeff” at the end 😂
cedric shoulda said I like watching you sleep...
I didn't watch/read Harry Potter. Is this real? Lolz
How do I delete a YouTube video from the internet?
I like your Me Boy, Me Big shirt
Hey jakc, where the your grammer sucks you should you would do?
You forgot the background music and stock photos XD
I'm very upset because I read all the text and you said jub jub dies in the second book but he's also there for voldemorts death\nWhy you lie
This is beautiful trash 😂
The no nose one needs some help
Jack needs to write a full Harry Potter book
When did I miss jubjub? When was jubjub?\nLol
YouTube must love this guy
There are people who have never read the books that belived this entire video
I'm finna kill an infant
shitposting in a new form
I love jub jubs commentary through the books from heaven. It really help the water works.
I couldn't stop crying this just got me right in the feels
Ron and Harry died?
I'm finna kill an infant
hooray, his top 10 parodies are back
The moral of the story is always give Jub Jub his  rub rub
Wow I'm really evil, thought Voldemort, evilly. Like, really really evil. I'm finna kill an infant. That's messed up. Dang. I should take a good, long look in the mirror. Nah I'ma kill this kid. He did lol
For a good time I thought this was real. Wow I'm an idiot
I have never read the Books, nor watched the movies so no one can tell me that this isn't fake
Wow I'm really evil, thought Voldemort evilly. Like really really evil. I'm finna kill an infant. That's messed up. Dang. I should take a good long look in the mirror. Nah imma kill this kid.
In all honesty though, Dobbys death was fricking terrible. I sat there and just cried for a bit.
I'm the original gay joke.
harry potter dies in harry’s srms
“The thought of a Heaven with no clothes delighted Harry. Suddenly he wasn’t so sad about Dumbledore fucking dying.” \n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful
Anyone else want the #1 spot to be Mr.Moesby
J.J. McCullough shaved off his mustache, so time to grow yours!
I did not like it
Harry Potter sucks. The Middle Earth lengendarium is superior in all aspects.
*Jub Jub want rub rub*
Where's Eric.\nTHE TOP TEN BOYS
“I am the only champion.” Harry said aloud to no one but himself.
Dumbledore was arguably one of the characters in the books WELL I'D HOPE SO
Wait, Sirius Black wanted to make love to Harry? Are you SERIOUS?\n\n*Cricket chirps*\n\nI'll show myself out.
YOU'LL ONLY KNOW THIS IF U READ THE BOOKS 😠😠😒😒😡😤😤😤
He did lol. Truly a harrowing glimpse into the mind of a psychopath. Keep up the good work, J.P. Morgana
people who haven’t seen Harry Potter and actually believe this
Top ten genders
kys
Can't believe this is trending
“There are no clothes in heave,” Dumbledore winked.\n\nWait, how did he wink that . . . ? You can’t wink something that you’d say. It would be: “There are no clothes in heaven.” Dumbledore winked.\n\nWhy am I overanalyzing this?
Give us a kiss
Am I the only one who's completely confused by  this video ?
It may be funny for some people but I have read all of the books and those are fake
This is all lies
What makes you think numbers would mean anything to the Aliens?
-Humans: send message to extraterrestrials explaining the universe\n-20 years goes by\n-Aliens: lol repost
How would ya say atom or proton or 42?Did you notice the 42 LOL?However, do not forget that this still is a serious question...
Nazi are on the dark side of the moon
why is everyone taking Elon Musk as an alien 👽 👽 👽
What if earth fragmented into several pieces?
Major Flaw. How would aliens know what an electron or proton is, what if they have diff. words for them?
Why did you stop drawing??? Your drawings were awesome.......
Did no one catch that Zoolander reference at 0:26? xD
What is this a school for ants?
We could use Planck's constant or even use Carbon
You're assuming our alien friends paid attention in their high school math classes; a potentially catastrophic assumption
What if they named proton and neutrons and other subatomic particles differently from us (obviously)\nIt'll be atom but they may see atom as named something else, then how do we explain them that by 'atom' we mean atom (in their language)\n\n**Brainstorming started**
If we don't want immigrants in our countries then why would we wanna communicate with aliens and invite them to earth.
1st how do you say proton
I'm pretty sure we can already communicate pretty well with them, if we arrived at the point where both planets know that they want to build the device
Ever since this video released I've packed my bags
I wanna see that Star Wars parody you made.
Why did this video assume that we have to tell the aliens how we measure meter, second and kilogram. Maybe they have a more advanced method of measuring things, that is let's say based on forces, or energies. That way, they will tell us how to build those units and measures, and finally how to build a teleporter.
Since you didn't actually talk about the physics of a teleporter, a more accurate description of the video would be on how to communicate with aliens.  By the way, if building a teleporter was physically possible, then the implications would be that it would also be possible to send messages backwards in time.  This is why many people believe that instantaneous teleportation is not physically possible.
Used to be black on white\nNow it's white on black\nWhy?
What. Thats all i have to say. “What”
first of all: AND ALSO THEY HAVE TO USE THE SAME NUMBERS AS WE DO, or else math wouldn't work at all. boom, comunication destroyed.
Too bad we would probably get scared and bomb them before we could grow with them lije this
can I show your videos in my class and in my videos
Was that a Zoolander reference at 0:26?
What if they don’t use math?
how do we tell them which ones are protons, neutrons, and electrons?
Watching this makes me feel smarter when in reality I can not keep up with all these numbers :(
Did you have to draw the visuals of this video in inverse colors?
A cubic is 18 inches, i think
Why can't we just say a gram is a cubic cm of the particle with an atom 8 and the atom with one (water)? Or something of the like I think that's right. And extrapolate from there?
but they wouldn't know what a proton or a nutron or numbers are so thats a huge road block too
Seems like it would make everyone's life a whole lot easier if we re-contextualized our own units in terms of whole numbers related to natural phenomena.
why not just use mass as an amount of an element at 0 degrees kelvin?
There's the problem of defining numbers.
assuming they know what an atom is... start video
How would they know our number system first, or even our terminology of things at the atomic level to describe our standard of time
Sure it's going to be a lot of fun to teach aliens from far away the concept of language, then our language, and then... and then... all that with a round-trip time of years... \n\n3 protons >>>>\n40 years later\n<<< how much is 3 again?
thanx for videos... do u think you can make a video on the very first transistor in history i mean the one that was created by shockley and bratain and has a triangualr shape and the  concept behind it and how it works.... please send your answere to shift.delete33@gmail.com
and how to tell them what a neutron, electron, etc are?
All I can see is the alien looking at you and saying proton?
What's a proton?  (Aliens are dumb)
But where can we find the Star Wars video?
Why are we the ones telling them to do all the hard work? What if they want us to measure all this stuff?
Unless we've figured out how to tell this all at once, this could at least take about 20-40 years xD. (The time the speed of light takes to travel to promontory is roughly 4.0 - 4,5 years
why would it be us setting the standards? do we had an idea how to build a working wormhole?
This is a really great video!
So did the teleporter work?
Problem, they might not have atoms that we have... sooo
Or you could just fire up the pyramids again.
This is actually accurate. The only problem is... Numbers... Yeah, whoops.\n\nBut it's accurate. People don't usually understand the immense difficulty we would have in communicating with other planets. But this... This is good. I like this.
What if they call atoms protons and neutrons different things
Why we keep assuming aliens are like humans ? whole universe is made out of same carbon and hydrogen if anything aliens are going to look like some animal and im pretty sure most aliens are water borne creatures. and if aliens were advanced or smart enough wouldn't they be the one sending signals to us ? life probably exists on other planets but humans are on earth only. maybe my last statement is an overkill but you can't prove me wrong on that.
YEAH WE WOULD BE USING THE METRIC SYSTEM AND IF THEY WERE LIKE US HERE IN THE USA WE'RE NOT HAVING IT😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Just say, \n\n1000cm^3 of water (atom with one proton, atom with 8 protons, another atom with one proton) is around 1 kg.\n\nThen they'll know mass.
But how do the aliens know that when you say atom or proton you're talking about an extremely small unit of matter? (Smallest) most likely they have other words for this , or an entirely different language all together, there's too many variables
Umm 1 major flaw. Time. How are we suppose to tell them these things? By time the message was sent and a new one came back we would have at least 1 new president and possible 3 if timed right. Elon Musk would also be a cyborg by then that has laser eyes and controls mars. Who by that pint made it into the death star and aimed it at us to remove AI.
Mass is easy... So many atmos of some stuff... Easy!\n\nNow how are you going to tell them how to Plug in the wire to the port on the _left_ ... without ever discussing what left and right refer to?\n\nChew on that, Minute Physics Guy!
Thanks! I'm gonna go build my own
😧 = my face the entire video
You're talking about atoms and clocks and whatnot, but what if aliens don't call them atoms? What if they don't use clocks? What if they don't use number but some other way of measurement?
With atoms and distance you can weight by showing two groups of atoms a specific distance from each other.   Yes?
Why haven't we figured out a better weight system yet? The Metric system is just as irrelevant as the Imperial system it seems.
And before the aliens come to us we have to make sure they are not made out of anti-matter by using CP violation
We already should have 1 kg measured... Check Veritasium channel. And none of these two concepts were used.
Why not just send a photo?\nAnd don't give me the but it can not measure size of the object.\nIt can be made 1:1 scale.\nI would rather make a video/photo communication device first, rather than a teleporter first.
So... how do we tell them what atoms are? Or, well, what 1 billion is? xD
No intelligent life in alpha Centauri , the horse head nebula is where you want to go.
Aliens as sophisticated as us or more so will have thought of the same thing. If there were a way to assume a standard right way to make a teleporter, maybe all civilisations across the universe could build one that way without even discussing the design beforehand?
it's impossible.Aliens that you think of don't exist.if they did,the universe would be obliterated by now.
I swear the kilogram was redefined in 2014....
√16=4
What?
nice clickbait
Brain hurt.

Is there an M-Class planet at Alpha Centauri? \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_planet_classification
How would they know what protons, neutrons, and electrons are? They could be called completely different things in their language.
So what's the link to your star wars parodies?
Drink some water thirsty boy. I don't wanna hear your lip smack I'm here to procrastinate
We’re too smart for Aliens.
They wouldnt know what a proton was because we gave it that name right or is there a way to tell them what a proton is
How do you know if they'll understand our numbers
Never invite Trisolarians to the party!
I have a feeling they already have this figured out.
Ask Rick.
this was crazy cool bro
Sam has always been a role model for me and it's crazy to see how far he's come. I'm so proud of him. He inspired me and showed me the way. He was one of the main reasons I started writing music, Thank you Mr. Smith. P.s..If you guys got a minute, check out the music on my channel.I promise you won't be disappointed.
Hello there.. I've recently uploaded a lyrics video of this beautiful song by Sam Smith!\nPlease feel free to check it out.. :)
The autotune guy in Sam's studio must get really bored while recording for him. There's no job for him at all.
Deep into the heart ! Greetings from Bulgaria ! <3
Laying in bed, earphones in, this song on blast, and crying my heart out
i just love this song!....    :)  grammy!!!!!!
You just get more and more amazing Sam! 🙌🏼
This was me the moment my (now ex-) wife had an affair
This song is so good.
Sam you're out of this world, seriosusly, I just hope one day I can see you live before I die, IS LITERALLY MY ULTIMATE WISH, youuuu're life maaan!!!!!!!!1
Love his voice. he looks better when thicker tho
Beautiful. Needed to hear this rn
I like his new look now he looks like his a man
He eats his CDs as snack
Wtf - sounds as good, if not better than the recorded version! This just confirms how Sam is pretty much the best male vocalist around at the moment.
This surely can't be live
His voice makes me cry every time
Those back vocals are not in the same level as Sam, you can barely hear them =(
Pure, raw talent. Every note piercing your heart in a good way 🙌
He sounds Flawless, So Happy Sam Smith is back with some new music!!!!!

Thank for creating music Sam!!
Better than the video.
those 717 dislikes means they don't have a taste in music
Literally on repeat. Every time I listen to sam smith I close my eyes and imagine a silky material moving in the wind lying on a big fluffy bed. His voice is just soulful and so full...of emotion. #eargasm 😂

I love this song so much
That exhale at the end was priceless
we are team that should be fighting for that 7-8 position and we strugling to get out of relegation zone
Same every week with Dom win or lose it’s always doom and gloom dom
Didn't celebrate the goal? Because you don't like Sakho? If west ham are as shit as you say they are then who can blame him for wanting to leave. Fucking idiot.
I agree with Dom for once Bilic has to go
You blame sakhos shit attitude, but he’s going to have that for as long as the fans will give him their shit attitude
That lads about 15 but he acts about 42 get a grip of yourself mate give yourself an aneurism before you turn 30
It’s the same every week with Dom win or lose you get doom and gloom dom
Youre fucking kidding you lot are in a relegation battle and need all the 3 points you can get, Sahko fuxking saved you
damn.. and i thought Real Madrid fans are suspect as fuck.
COYI. Love how this has made #33 on trending too lmao 😂
West ham must do a roaring trade at the burger van......
I'd try an Hope get Ancelloti in quick time
Spot on , we need a new manager asap
Why have Dom on here such a miserable c##t
Looks like the biggest problem at West Ham at the moment are the fans. Get behind the team and stop moaning.
Massive sigh at the end said it all. There were some positives at the very end and hopefully we can start with those players in the next game.
Dom is such a twat. It's 3 points well deserved as we dominated the game by creating more chances and shots than Swansea who are didn't have a clue. Stop being negative bilic in.
Bilic just won the game you muppet. So fucking negative every week
Until West Ham spend the big money and get better players managed by a world class manager we'll be stuck on this hamster wheel forever.same old shit casual play but the goal gets the whole team out of jail.
Why so many Pikeys follow West Ham?
I agree. Can't feel as excited as usual after a win because Bilic is still there and I feel he cannot take us any further. We were awful again but same as usual Bilic had no clue how to set up the team. No style of play. We have about 5 players up top waiting for it to be launched forward and we are fucking around with it at the back. Bilic clearly doesn't have instruction or game plan for the team. We need someone who will actually set the team up with some discipline and structure.
He is not a fan, who gives a fuck we are a team with 4pts from 6 games, would you rather we lost?
A goal scored by West Ham is a goal celebrated by me even if Harold shipman was playing upfront
More performance art from Dom. it's all an act.
Sakho did celebrate he took his shirt off lol! he went mad! why take your shirt off , he got a yellow card!
I hate Sakho's attitude but I love west ham so I celebrated the fuck out of the goal.\nDom is right about the win papering over the cracks though. We may have been better off in the long run getting the draw if it meant Slav got the boot because as it stands he is just going to continue with his awful tactics and we are going to struggle like we have for the last year and a half.
We have a decent aquad but billic dont know how to get the best out of them...thats was a piss poor performance...even antonio played shit and ive never seen him play crap
If Bilic did go who would West Ham get I mean no managers about who will take that job... And him saying Swansea not a good side and West Ham are behave both shit teams.....
When will people relise that the deal was in place for sakho to leave the club had arranged it but then decided to stab sakho in back as they couldnt sign another striker then decide to blame sakho
can we not give dom the job, with his attitude he would make me play like fucking messi
I'm not being funny, we messed up big time early doors this season. But we're still only 3 points off 7th.\nUnless we can get Benitez or Ancelotti, what's the point of changing manager?\n\nSo let's back the team if not him until we get a better manager.
Andy Carroll goals per game ratio is 0.28 goals per game. How is he allowed to play ?
This video was missing a 'chin up' at the end of it Nicky haha Dom looks like we've just been relegated out the championship to Millwall
Dom always looks like he’s got a bit of shit under his nose.
Met Nicky after the game today, brilliant lad, even got a picture with him 🙂
Well that was depressing, he has a point about Bilic though.
Mate ATM it doesn't matter how we get the 3 points as long as we do
Anyone else spot Ethan / bazinga from sidemen
Such a important win ffs , don't matter how they come when your struggling at the bottom, and I hear a lot of fans today at the match including this fat mug Dom saying he would rather us lose so Bilic goes ........ one word and that is CUNT
Bilic gotta go
Dom cracks me up haha
He's a morbid cunt
Spot on, don't like the man. His attitude is piss poor.
down. fuck we all hope so you PICKEY SCUM....................................................
Win papers over the cracks bilic out we will not get top 10 with this man in charge
Spot on from Dom, as for not celebrating the goal thas just petty mate last minute goals are the cream of goal celebrations lol
I see hear what you saying Dom\nBut we all know if it was a cup final against with the  drinks flowing n Sakho scores 95th min  winner ...  You would be going mental 😂
Dom just shut the fuck up, call yourself a West Ham fan , always fucking moaning . We won the game don't need your negativity. It weren't pretty but we are struggling. Not cheering your team ffs Just go away
caravan scum.
Completely agree with Dom
Why so many ugly fat West Ham fans. Fat ugly bastards LOL. Vocabulary of the East End sewer rats. Feck this and Feck that and nothing Feck all else LOL. West Ham hop picking holidays are what these fat bastards need.
Look at how he has to give a lecturing speech to a bunch of grown men and women. It just goes to show you how childish racism is...you literally have to speak to a racist like a child.
Wake Up: The enemy wants to kill Americans, they do not care how about your skin tone.  When you're in battle and the enemy is bearing down on you, the last thing you're going to care about is the race of your fellow soldier. Embrace the things we share in common, they far outweigh our differences. As a military the saying United we stand, Divided we fall holds true. If you haven't learned that in your military leadership training, you're not fit for leadership or military service. Get out - Lt Gen Silveria couldn't have made it any simpler for those that have a hard time learning.
Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria for president
Next United States president
know that just like the Jew lead blacks into wanting to gangbang sell drugs and kill' through paying some big money to shuck and juvie' like NWA 2pac chef keef JayZ and many others' who chose to lead there people into the dark' for a life of riches' based on lies and destruction of there own people'..yup he would know that the honest pro whites are exposing the mass control the Jew has in media Hollywood and collage university's .. and he would know that the Jews are using the blacks to try to choke out the white mans truth because he is trying to wake everyone up to the false reality' that  is being drilled into your mind-all day everyday..
Well said sir. Racism and intolerance have no place in the modern world.
Heroes like this. Heroes like this are the real reason I wake up in the morning, the real reason I can sleep at night. The ideas they have, the love they bring. \n\nI have a good idea:\n\nWith all the horrible people spreading hatred out there, threatening to nuke us, our allies and with people on our side threatening to nuke people we don't like, we need to spread the idea of love and respect. We will not, should not and cannot tolerate disrespect and/or disparage any other person for any reason given besides their actions towards another human being. \n\nSo if you hate another person for the color of their skin, you need to GET OFF OF YOUTUBE. You don't belong here, where love and compassion should exist. \n\nIf you hate me or anybody else, you need to GET OFF OF YOUTUBE. \n\nIf you, angry, decide to dehumanize somebody based on something they don't like, you need to GET OFF OF YOUTUBE. \n\nThis is a community. We respect one another with passion, consideration, love and the utmost respect and honor.\n\nIf you cannot, will not and if you think you should not do that for the innocent people who do so much to help you and me because of the color of their skin, gender, age, country of origin and/or beliefs, not their actions, then you need to GET OFF OF YOUTUBE. \n\nThey are not the problem.\n\nYou are. \n\nAnd as people, we get rid of the things we don't like about ourselves, about our community.\n\nIf you are a nuisance to our community, then you need to GET OUT.
Say a joke\nThe United States has no racial discrimination~
They were Trump Supporters. I bet
Thank you for being human.
Why is it that some people in the comments are *more upset* about him condemning racism, than the actual act of racism, smdh 😒
The world need more leaders like Gen. Silveria...
I can't believe this has had only one million views. This man just virtually  declared himself running for office!
Those words shook me those words remind me of what the military felt like 10 years ago
trump is a grate president  yall just don't notice what he doing good cuse yall lesson to fox news and cnn they dont tell truth he bringing jobs to america he putting liberal in there place
JRLM you are a complete keyboard pussy because you refuse to use your real name nor a real photo of yourself. You and your words are without merit. LtGen Silveria's words are complete politically correct showboating which is destroying our military. Have you noticed, MORON, that the so-called racist words have not been published?
I do wish the so called President, the #45 would understand what this General speaks about....
I’m confused, where are the offended black people, all I see is white people shaming other white people for being racist. Like wtf is going on, first pewdiepie says the n word and a bunch of white people are offended, like are white people secretly black?
Subscribe to my channel!\nReward: watch me give all racist 10 kicks up his ass!
Never was a patriot but after watching this, I feel proud to be an American.
ITS ONLY RACIST IF YOUR WHITE. FUCK THEM LIBTARDS.  I FUCKIN HATE THE RACE SHIT!!!!  I AM 75% CHEROKEE FUCK ALL LIBERALS AND AND WHITE GUILT. FUCK THE LEFT . I WANT ALL LEFTIST TO LEAVE MY FUCKIN LAND.
Agree with what he said. All groups have good and bad people with good and bad qualities. No one is perfect, and I don't think anyone is 100% evil. My question thou is: Do they know exactly who did it, and why? Was it truly someone evil showing there views? Was it an idiot just doing a protest to be like all the others protester? Like he said, protest but no options to make things better. Was it someone just flame baiting to get things going? One final option, was it some one of the offended group doing it to themselves to make the issue blow up? This has happened in a few cases. Regardless, we do have to live with one another, and if we work together, we can make this a better world.
Diversity really has nothing to do with racism.  You could have a perfectly equal amount of all races represented and still have racism.
My better idea, stop promoting garbage like Charlottesville and Ferguson.  \nHad people let the White Supremacists have their little rally in Charlottesville it would have been small, not on TV and quickly forgotten.  The problem was that the counter protesters honestly believe that the white supremacists don't have the right to free speech.  \nThe Ferguson protest was about a cop who justifiably killed a man for robbing a convenience store and then resisting arrest and trying to harm the cop.  \nCan we please just promote the truth....can the leaders in the military, like Lt. Gen Jay Silveria, please just promote the truth.\nRacism in the US is lower than anywhere else in the world and the more we keep beating this drum of racism the more people are going to resent each other AND THAT CREATES MORE RACISM!!!  For the love of God, PLEASE, stop this insanity.\nNigger is a horrible word, it is a dehumanizing word, much like the words that the military tells our soldiers to use when we go to war with another country.  Chinks, Japs, Krauts, Ruskies, Commies, camel jockeys, all used to dehumanize the enemy so the soldiers can sleep at night after killing another human being.\nBTW, I refuse to say the n word instead of nigger.  I will never call someone a nigger, but I refuse to act like a 3 year old, cover my mouth and say the n word when speaking to adults.  If you are offended, I don't care.
I'm not American but this guy makes me wanna be one ASAP. Fuck stupid ideologies.
I knew I should've joined the AirForce.
We need a people like this man he represent how is this nation and how directed these democracy  Not like the clown we have in the White House.
Give this man a fourth star for that collar!
Okay Lt.Gen. Silveria, who was the culprit?  What was their racial identity?  WHY did they do it?  We understand there was a racial epitaph but that same word you can hear 30 times a minute on any rap radio station.  What if it were another black person who wrote it?  What if it were one of the occupants of the room looking to start a false narrative because they were on the verge of failing the prep school?  Lots of questions and you have not provided any answers.  I understand the Air Force is not really a branch of the military but sheesh, quit being a PC lump.  Get some facts before you express your outrage that may not be what you think it is.  Duh.
Thank you for posting such good videos! It is always great to see there's still good people out there!
is 3 star GN3 or is it GE ?
Are you prepared to join the ranks of the worlds created Air Force? Aim high, fly, fight, win
Yes. Speak against hate.\nOur president should take notes on this speech.
Sounds like a classic race hoax to me. 😉
Oh look all the officers are white.
until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XHEPoMNP0I
I wish I were 32 years younger standing in Mitchell Hall with my fellow American cadets to hear such a spiritful speech live.
In 2017 this is STILL going on!! President Lincoln signed a piece of paper making every man and woman even and STOPPED A RACE OF PEOPLE BEING SOME PERSONS PROPERTY!!!!! And that was done centuries ago yet in this day and age he would be dumbfounded what the FUCK that’s happening in the States today?!?!? I’m in Glasgow,Scotland and I get it for being Irish/Scottish even to this day! And it mostly ends in violence! 2017 a few months and it’s nearly 2018? Really? Best term is “KNUCKLE DRAGGERS” because they definitely can’t walk upright!! And don’t get me wrong I watch the news and read about the news world wide! And the people who are SUPPOSE TO “PROTECT AND SERVE!” Seem one of the biggest threats in the States today!! Will they face proper justice? AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN NO!!! No they won’t!!! Children are getting shot through car doors,they are getting shot for “ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS” and simply getting killed for “Walking down the street! The police force have became a law Apon themselves! And it ain’t the law they where the badge for!!! where when a “Incident” happened and they get PAID FUCKING LEAVE! And sent to a shrink to talk about “There feelings,anger BLAH BLAH FUCKING BLAH!” Where any normal citizens feet wouldn’t hit the ground and you’d be facing 15-25 years in some states! It’s in there amendment rights,if they are not on police record and depending on there history in some states they can apply for a “Concealed weapon!” But out that % of ppl cleared what’s the % of people just snapping and using one? I’m just asking simple questions to a bad,sticky subject that America lives with every day!! I don’t know how the UK would deal with the same power if given it? More than likely 100’s of people would take advantage of the fact! No doubt they would!! And it’s said for every legal gun on the street of the States,there’s 20 illegal guns in there place? That’s a WTF moment right there!!!
From a US Army combat vet: well said Lt. Gen, cut fence and sort those racist bastards out....
Watch how many whites​ come and comment wait to all the facts come out..
EQUALITY: ] Well then, should we conclude that we....are better than others? No, not at all, for we have already shown that  A L L    PeOpLe, whether Jews or Gentiles, are under the power of sin. ... 23 For everyone has sinned; we  A L L   fall short of God's glorious standard.Romans3[THEREFORE,  I urge you, first of all, to P R A Y  for   A L L   pEoPlE.  ASK God to help them;  INTERCEDE  on their behalf, and give THANKS for them. 2 P R A Y  this way for kings and ALL who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. 3 This is good and pleases God our Savior, 4 who wants EVERYONE to be saved and to understand the truth. 5 For there is only one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity--the man Christ Jesus. 6 He gave his life to purchase freedom for EVERYONE. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time.....I desire therefore that the men PRAY EVERYWHERE, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting, disputing, dissension, etc;1Timothy2[ The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 By this the love of God is revealed in us: that God has sent his one and only Son into the world so that we may live through him. 10 In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if God  SO  loved us, then we also ought to love one another.1John4[........ Instead, we will SPEAK the TRUTH in LOVE, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.Ephesians4
Yeah I bet it was written by the offended race just to feed the liberal narrative.
I'm not racist, I just hate that black men get all the bitches. One day I'ma start a revolution, and there will be another civil war in America. Slavery ruined everything. I wish I had a time machine to stop slavery from ever happening. I'm going to hell for the mistakes our founding fathers' made. Forgive me God, but if I don't do it, no one will, and somebody's gotta do it.\nFuck u niggas, come at me I dare u, my eyes reder than the devil is.
Why are the poor, deplorable southerners the racist ones? Why aren't the upper class intelligent costal whites racist ?
Talk to all the cadets as if they are all guilty. That sets the tone for government work. If you want WELFARE you have to submit.
Virtue signaling 101 and I bet he's a closet homo.
Hurtful words on message boards, boo hoo boo hoo!   \nwtf, aren't these guys supposed to be military?  If they are so distressed over hurtful words then what the fuck are they going to do when bullets and RPGs are flying towards them?\n\nI might expect this from snowflake liberals, but not military.
This needed to be said, one of the very few nowadays standing against the elephant in the room that's destroying our country.
And this is why I love and respect our military.
When I hear a military leader talk about these issues, I turn a deaf ear. I was in the Air Force in the seventies, tho I am dark complected to the extent that I was often mistaken for Latino. My views were NOT welcome just as they are not today. Treating everyone equally is not a problem, most always their interpretation of your meaning is racist and biggoted. I am not full white, nor am I full native American and white, yet, I was often the target of racial indifference, to the point that I just started going my own way, so as a result of that, I was racist because I refused to be the target and mingle with any if my fellow soldiers. I was forced to go to ethnic cleansing classes disguised as stereotype classes. It was indoctrination to tell me my white linage is worthless and the native American portion has no rights except that of a 3/5 human. I learned to keep my mouth shut. My desire to become a career soldier was dashed against the stones on the beach of life, I was refused re enlistment. It was devistateing, took me to well past thirty to get over it and finally get sober. I do not, nor do I condone, racist activity, yet I see it daily from both sides of the spectrum. It has become acceptable for Latino, blacks and Asians to be racist, but not so for others. Kinda like feminism, if you want equality, act equal, if you want supremecy go to stereotype school and learn to be a man or woman. But please grow up, this is getting rediculous.
If only he was our president...
This is a real hero
I wish he would give that speech to Trump.
Tell it to Trump or you're wasting your breath!
He has my vote in 2020
I never understood how racist people think. Like, why would you hate a whole group of people based off their skin color? Something that we have no control over.. you don't get to pick what ethnicity you're born Into. You don't get to choose the country you're born in. You don't get to pick your parents...so why? The only thing you do get to pick is how you act as a human being. You can choose to be nice to your fellow human being. The only race is the human race. We may have different cultures but, that does not and should NOT make you any less human.
Great speech and he shows what America core is about! Let's build on these words and replay them at your next social gathering.
RESPECT ✊ to this Leader!
Man......can this guy be our new president??
Yep
O
Bad ass mother fucker right there!!!!!!
Whooo fuckn raaaaa!
Trump's America
Machiavelli at its best.
Nigger
It sure was.
Speech was 🔥🔥🔥
👏
Racists are insecure moronic imbeciles
Truer words were never spoken.
Trump Trump Trump !!  MAGA
Poop swastika part II
700 Plus racists in here
2020 u got my vote
Lt Gen Silveria for President.
every racist deserve to die
Lt. General Silveria for President 2020....💯
Highly admirable and respectable. Salute.
Blah blah blah as long as their white people they will always be RACISM #FACTS
racism is childish and children don't even do it
Its good to know people in those branches Care as a black man i fucking salute you Sargent
You'll never get this speech from 45 because divisiveness and intolerance were key to his success.
Most likely, it was a fake hate crime as usual. Wont hear anything after its exposed as a hoaxed as with previous incidents.
What you see on this video isn't strength, its pure weakness, this clown knows each and every one of his cadets would rather shoot at each other than anyone they are payed to murder in the middle east.
The same words I say to my students. There is only one way to grow a united family, this way is called respect, brotherhood and friendship among all. Those who do not respect others are out.
How embarrassing that these are supposed to be tough guys and terrified about a word.  Pathetic.
Should we apply this to our whole society? Should we apply this to all libtards who refuse to treat our President with dignity and respect?
When they find the writer of the message is actually a POC will this leader apologize and punish the message writer? It wouldn't be the first time POC's wrote racist messages to cause racial divisiveness. See: fakehatecrimes.org which has hundreds of similar stories. Remember the black churches burned that turned out to be a black man? How about the 3 black chicks on a bus in Albany supposedly beaten by racist white college kids? Or the  uslim chick who stayed out later than her curfew and instead of taking responsibility she blamed it on a group of non-existant klansmen. Interestingly, her brother did the same thing a year before. Or the bazillion times the N word was supposedly uttered, yet never on video...even though everybody and their grandmother videotapes every minute of every day, yet no proof exists. Just a poor POC being harangued by racist caucasoids. \n\nAmericans are growing weary with these false narratives. Any ody with eyes, ears and Google access can research shootings by cop broken down by race and find out there are many more white folks shot by police and that neing shot by police is oftentimes necessary when somebody is in the process of committing a violent crime. We don't say lightning strikes are epidemic, yet 300+ Americans are struck per year. 16 black men were shot and killed by police last year. But THAT is an epidemic? Not sure how that makes any sense but I guess if you failed math it might.
You get out , you zionist supremacist shit for brains.
Uh, I just need to tell ya...\n\nFerguson and Charletsviile were both a Hoax...\n\nThat’s right.  \n\nNo one shot. - No one dead.\n\nHands up don’t loot.\n\nRbM
This is what True Diversity is. People of every race including white people coming together and addressing the issues that people face. Well done. 👏🏻
737 trump supporters watched this video.
Racist people take note! XD Yeh because racists give a fuck about taking notes. They know their beliefs are fucked they don't care what others think of them XD Oh this man is a hero. What a leader for saying the fucking obvious. Oh god, what a true leader. Shut up.
Lt General Silveria: Don't you have something more important to do? Perhaps preparing the students to handle the next war?
Comments here are cancer. I will never understand Americans. I'll pay more attention to their comments when they finally catch up with the rest of the developed world. Right now it just causes me pain.
[Virtue Signalling Intensifies]
I guess Trump supporters arent allowed there
Look at this left-wing bullshit. The Air Force, offended by words! How are we supposed to beat anyone when we break down over something like this? And I thought he was supposed to be a general. Put on your dress wear, you lazy shit, you're not in combat. Look official for your little press conference. God damn. All upset over a relatively minor incident, an incident that was more than likely a *HOAX*, like most hate crimes are. The Air Force is a bunch of pampered little faggots, if this video is anything to go by. Poor babies!
Yeah when America was founded by whites it should be for whites this is why I'd never join a army that allows nigger and Muslims and faggots
this is the actual hardest game of all time and if any of you say otherwise, you are lying.\n\nsee ya later bye guys press a like
Loved the tap A to hug part
Keep it up! Thats what smosh been missing
i saw Lilly \nand immediately click
*667 ricegum lovers who hates real content*
this was amazing! very creative as well
I love the honest answer!  It actually made perfect sense.  Sad reality!
Hi my friend , Congratulations great video. Just keep in touch, I'll never miss any any of your video
The tap A to hug thing gave me anxiety
You survived a hug\nYou is a winner\nLiterally me.
Have anybody noticed, Anthony cried in this one too....in last scene
Dude it's been two days and you're still trending high five
Anthony Padilla: the telltale game series 
Someone should make that game
I liked you better when I thought you were gay. It made me think I had a shot, but now I know I don’t. Unless of course, you don’t care about labels, then YES I do have a shot. But I don’t.
Love this, so original one of the best videos I've seen.
I would play this game 😂
Why does the thumbnail say tap a when you're clearly holding it
Hhahahaha This was brilliant! xD\n\nI suck at playing Real Life too :'(
DO A PART TWO!!!!
The press A to hug gave me anxiety ahah
That's my boy! You get that Anthony WOO!
The hug had me dead 😂😂 this is such original content I miss this on YouTube
Wow your Nintendo 64 is a lot better than mine
Yes , life is a game
I need this to be a series
-Why does Anthony have 3 Adam’s Apples?-
This is more creative than smoshs new content
don't be lost in thoughts
imagine doing this in real life lmao
I'm sorry but you can't do that to Batman with that frame.
So Anthony is a Buddhist?
I would love to have this as a real game
Was it actually this awkward when you met her after so long??!
You choked to death on Lilly's hair wow...
I died of laughter on the tap A to hug
This felt like a smosh video. Just without ian...its cool though
A little bit like a smosh video but I still stand by with what I say. I still wish you were still on smosh
At least this isn't that weird ass kids show video
This is so cool
THIS IS AMAZING MAN KEEP IT UP. I NEVER SEEN THIS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
Are you gonna do the other 37 lvls tho?
Guys talking to people is not that hard
You created a video about nostalgia and fun! You can be proudly saying that you've gotten original as fruit.....dang it....frozen....no.....frog?
Still shouldn’t have left smosh 😐 sorry I’ll..... I’ll go
this is literally my favorite youtube video right now! Great job man!
Please do more of these
Make this a series.
This was almost too awkward to watch
You is kind\nYou is smart\nYou is a winner
The hug part had me laughing so hard
This is my life....
I RELATE TO THIS. SO. MUCH.
666 dislikes... dont know what to do with this information
The only one I was wrong about was... breathing...
This is what smosh used to be. Shame how much it changed no wonder why anthony wanted to leave
Anthony is so emo but without the emo hair
why is it that when Anthony dies he losses 200 points but when he completes a task he gets 1000 points the point value is completely thrown off
What's up with that depressing filter
I kinda want to play that if it was a video game
Oh my god... It really IS that hard.
This is so funny 😂
HE LOOKS LIKE NATHAN DRAKE IN THE THUMBNAIL RJTEJBTJRHFH
I wonder how awkward this is while filming
😂😂😂laughing my ass out godddd this is so good
This is actually a really cool video I'm super impressed
This is what Anthony wanted ❤️. It makes me happy ✨☺️.
This guy reminds me of the Smosh guy

No Ones Gonna Ask What Was On The TV? No? Ok...

Who else would love to suck on this girls butthole?
I love how Liza has her wine, beer, and her margarita mix lmao
4:13 WHY TF IS THAT CHAIR UPSIDE DOWN?? 😂😂❤
If I can get 500 followers on my Instagram I will challenge myself to upload everyday on YouTube!!
20 divided by 5 is 2, y'all.
Liza you are funny and sweet and dab on the haters
did anyone else realize that David said supercalifragilisticexpialidocious wrong?
When will u make merch
wasn’t super funny, except at the end when she crawled away
I think Liza should do ice skating with Liza
This is actually hilarious, love it.
Do a pun off with Ryan higa
The one and only thing I learned is Liza likes Cocoa Puffs ;-;
Liza you have to perfect nose shape it's PERFECT!!!
Yo the goats at the beginning
did i just watch goat porn or no
The way helga walks is how most of the girls in my school walk😂 (no hate though liza love ya💖)
Liza can u give a shoutout to Alan Campos please
I SHIP HELGA AND CARLOS!!!
Pls do one of these with carlos
im so confused, is she impersonating Borat ?
Idk but I thought it would be a good idea for you to make a video of Helga or Jet in the park (and scare people)😂😂
Making faces and stupid voices isn’t comedy. This shit is awful
David: What mistake you keep on making again and again?\nHelga: Children\n\nWho ele saw that coming 😂💞
She should totally colab with the Dolan twins!!!
Okay little brown gurl I see you!! You gotta booty that's for sure lol 😂😂❤
Are you going to do a 73 questions with Carlos
- What would be your spirit animal?\n- My dead goat. I MISS YOU, BALUKALEESKA!!!
Did anyone else think she was walking like Roger??
Hi small youtuber i would really like that if you checked out my channel and maybe subscribe
“20 DIVIDED BY 5 IS 2”\nUm r u sure it’s not 4? 😂😂
Why do you have play-dooh in everywere of you House?
Sigh...I weep for the depths to which comedy has fallen...
Who saw the goat sex
Hey Liza why maybe you can do Carlos next :)
Some of these I laughed so hard, Liza you are hilarious 😅😅😅
6k who disliked this video has no heart💛💛
Helga's a savage
Can u do Carlos
Dude do a library with Liza!!!!!!
anyone noticed the banana in the microwave turned into a plant 😂
Aaaaaaaand cue shitting on David for not knowing SuperCALIfragilisticexpialidocious\n\nAnd second shout out to autocorrect for having it in the dictionary?? #LittleSurprises
Do a 72 question interview with little Liza w/vogue of course
73 wow. Anyway I would like to see families and all people focus less on DISTRACTING THEMSELVES WITH FOOTBALL / SPORTS TO MUCH with all it's related drinking alcohol and over stuffing there big bellies with more meat 🍖 than they could ever hope to digest (which leads to overly high acidity levels causing mucus which causes an obstruction to the flow ie the body's ability to clean itself to maintain health - then leading to CANCER , which is on the rise) and focus more towards LOVE ❤️, there children and spouses, unity leading naturally to a better life for everyone. Please everyone try to start seeing that the medical industry only profits from keeping people sick.  I know it sucks to think the doctors are in on it but it sucks more to see children born sick and 1 of 2 people getting cancer now. Eat more fresh organic fruits and vegetables uncooked and fell your energy rise and your head clear and your weight balance out back to normal. Watch 10 or 20 videos of the life-regenerator on YouTube and take a look at DrMorseND in Florida videos on YouTube although he talks fast because his videos are for doctors of his naturopathic school, however Dan Macdonald liferegenerator on YouTube is fun and on point. Peace everyone 🙏🌿🍊💕
THEY'RE COCOA PUFFS IN THE PLANTS
Helga wasn’t like this before. Now she acts like Jet. It’s still cool but I like the old Helga better.

who was recording at the end 🤔
Alright, I have a weird idea, bear with me. If you catch on, feel free to continue it.\n\n\n\n\nYouTube Video Quality\n360p=Jake Paul/Team 10 or anyone associated with them- October 1st, 2017\n\nIf you disagree, feel free to replace it with what you want. I can edit my comment to include your ideas. \nI will also add on the date of the edits. Last thing, what I think is bad quality isn't what everybody else has to think. If you love Jake Paul and Team 10, I won't judge you. Personally, I don't like him. I include this in the comment because everyone has different opinions and tastes, and can react negatively if someone doesn't agree. That's it, I'm done rambling.
Can you start making more musical.lys? Btw i love you

This is gonna sound so creepy but your feet are so nice
This was so relaxing and inspiring! Candles really set the mood and I love that you and Jim take time to yourselves at the end of the day. That's so important especially when you live with your S.O.
SOMEONES CUTTING ONIONS, ITS NOT MY FAULT
This made me want to cry so hard, because I get it. I get how uncomfortable it feels to be a 6/10, I know what it's like to look around in silence and just wanting to leave because you're making everyone else feel uneasy with your trouble. \nAnd I loved your hands, how you moved. It felt like you were trying to touch something you can't quite understand. And it also felt forced, in a good way though, because when you feel like that you don't really know how to place or move your hands, so this little awkward dance starts and everything just doesn't seem right. \nYour outfit at the end also reminded me of the audition scene in La La Land, I don't remember if the clothes were the same but it reminded me of that. \nI just love this song so much, it just hits so close to home. Feeling like this to me it's the norm. \n\nGood job to everyone involved. Sammy Paul just knows how to portray emotions in the best way possible. Keep up the good work everyone, because it's gonna take you so far.
Everything about this speaks to me...
oh lord.. dodie.. i love you, this was beautiful.
This was the perfect visual representation for this song
More like a 4/10. But I'm glad I found this song.
thank you so much everyone who made this
HOW DID I MISS THIS
I like the title. really cool vid
I’m- it’s beautiful!
Amazingly powerful. I've never seen a music video, or a video in general, that has had this much meaning. Sending love.
that was so beautiful!!!
y’all, go to 2:38 on her “tips for when you’re panicking” video, maybe that’s an explanation of the shoulder thing
Guys.. Conan liked this video!! \n\n\n\n\nI sense a collab coming
what the fuck is this song about very stupid song
I'm prettyyy sure it's actually Alice Brittian, but at 2:30 she looks sooo much like Ann Ward from America's Next Top Model
I’m not crying I swear. Dodie is too good for this world.
please i’m crying
Thank you.  I love you.  Never stop being you.  Please.  💛😭
This song makes me feel emotions that don't yet exist 💞💞
I love this!!!!so!much!!💛
i’m crying and i never cry i’ve never cried at a funeral or anything sad or happy unless it’s food but still i don’t cry and dodie is just such a stress reliever it’s amazing how she gives me emotions
WHAT?? I HAD NO CLUE SHE HAD A VEVO!
it made me so sad to see my beautiful dodie cry....
you may feel like a 6/10 but this song sure is a 10/10
I didn’t understand why their arms hurt then I got it. It’s from waving to the taxis. I’m broken
Can't wait for more
Literally im crying because this is the best video of all , it make me feel identified , i will always live ur art because it conveys many emotions and feelings
According to the boys at my school who ranked all the girls i’m a 4 out of 20
Sucked in a breath I didn't know I wasn't allowing in at the end. Don't know why it made me so emotional, but in any other words, Beautiful.
Why is everyone touching their shoulders? I'm kinda confused
*there are tears coming frOm my eyes w h y*
god I love this
This is just so... Relatable and the video just beautifully encompasses that
This is beautiful, you're beautiful. This is one of those things that you feel honored to watch and listen to.
This just connected so fucking deeply with me. What?!\n I’m not crying?
I feel sad because I feel how she felt when she was leaving the waiting room and the other girls lacked confidence like dodie, but decided to stay! while others might feel as self-conscious and socially anxious as I do, I feel like I can't speak because someone might judge me or find it funny. I'm an art major, the competition and shade is huge in there! I feel like even if what I'm going to say is right and I have a point, I don't want to say it because I know the judgement/jealousy/shade/pity in their eyes. and I have that with my art, too. I'm presenting my thesis in 10 days and I'm already terrified at the thought that someone might toxically look at me or my art.
I really love it, but I don't *get* it. Maybe I just need to listen some more?? I'm fine with that lol.\nDespite my confusion, this is still a gorgeous song. Always loved your voice xx
AHHHH I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!! The meaning at the end where the other ideal girls had the same feelings and issues that dodie did! Amazing, such a good reveal and timing. Was the shoulder/neck thing meant to represent being uncomfortable in your own skin? That's what I kind of got from it :) Great job to all involved!!!! Beautiful video :D
I can't stop watching this. Dodie, this is amazing and beautiful and powerful and you are amazing and beautiful and powerful and I just love
This is a great portrayal of what it’s like to have free-floating anxiety. Awesome job!
I don't really get it can someone pls explain?
This breaks my heart because Dodie could never be plain!
Beautiful. That's all I have to say... beautiful. I love the way you made this, that you showed that everyone has a battle that they are fighting inside. Sending you lots of love, always.
What we should hope for is to say to ourselves, I'm a six out of ten. Great!\nInstead of saying, I'm a six out of ten, I'll get out of your way now.\n\nKnow yourself... but know that you are worthy. Strive for a positive outlook.
sammy u did it again
6/10 is still above average. Stick it out love
Yay! Yay! Yay! I've been waiting for this video forever ! Thank u so much dodie we love u ❤️❤️❤️
This is my favorite song and this video broke my heart mostly because I relate to it so much and no one should relate to feeling worthless
This is everything I have been waiting for.
I didn't think I was gonna cry, but man did I cry
my interpretation of the video was that when you would see her rubbing her arms, almost like she was in pain, to me it seemed like a metaphor to symbolize that she has insecurities and  pains that she tries to push down and hide. when she would reach her arm up, it seemed like she wanted something and was trying to get it. when she went to the audition that's what it looked like she really wanted for herself, was to be an actress and to be someone. when she got there, she saw all of these other beautiful girls and thought they'd for sure never pick her, so she gave up and it ends with her crying in the back of the car because she feels worthless and insecure. but really it shows that even though all of the other girls looked confident in what they were doing, they all feel the same way she does. \n\ni also saw a lot of references to La La Land, i don't know if that was on purpose but dodie loves that movie. she started in a coffee shop + went to an audition, it all is very familiar to that movie. \n\nanyway, dodie is so talented. this song is amazing and the message (i got.) was also amazing.
god this is so sad. I hope no one has to feel this way. I know that people still do, but I wish it weren't so. especially for a wonderful person like Dodie
wHAT DID THE UNIVERSE DO TO DESERVE THIS BEAUTY
Sammy's directing is great
The song is so beautiful. I also love Sammy's directing and Ciaran's cinematography.
well shoot. look who’s crying. :,)
i used to listen to this song every day this past summer while going to and coming back from work, where I'd always have to be bubbly and happy and cute. so not only do i strongly relate to the song, but i'm also happy to see that i can connect to the video, too.\n\n\nalso, i see lala land references everywhere :)
Perfect song gets a perfect video! So beautiful and so needed!
BABE YOUR TRENDING THIS IS SO SSO INSPIRATIONAL I CAN'T  SPEAK
i will hurt for you
This is incredibly beautiful, thank you for sharing :)
I think she is a 5/10 but still beauty is subjective
such an accurate representation of anxiety -- the mental and physical toll of it and I love it, thank you dodie
Wow and wow and wow and wow. Did I mention wow
I'm not crying, it's just hayfever... I just have a bit of dodie's new music video in my eye... I'm fine I swear... darn allergies y'know...
I'm dying, I'm dying... I'm dead
So sad :(
Beautiful
i am weeping
I love you Dodie
so so so beautiful! Thanks Dodie
Absolutely stunning

<3
Loved your personality and humour in this vlog !! Was so enjoyable to watch. \nNot saying that you're not always like this I just noticed haha
I love you Nile but OMG KOHEI THE GOD
you're staying right across the street from where i used to live omfg
Why did you take off your shirt to do a handstand?
hi Nile! I'm so sad, I wanted to come and watch the world championchips but I injured myself and I have to get surgery... I broke my right knee and 3 ligaments and my leg at a trampoline park, I'm gonna keep a cast on my whole leg until january... I'm so sad I can't do gymnatics this year, only conditioning, it sucks... I love you so much thank you for sharing your Journey with us!
2:51 was THE BEST!!!! Uchi, you vlog mate? I LOVE IT!!!!
Why aren't you verified yet?
Nile u were staying in the same room I did in Montreal
I'm in Montreal for the championships. I wish I could meet you
OMG you are to Montreal 😍
What kind of English do you speak man I can barely get you!!
So exciting!  Can't wait to see you Monday!
Welcome to my home town. Hope you're having a great time.
Need a T shirt bad, in white...help help I've injured my back but don't give a fuck..yes I'm very limited at the mo but ..the back support I use is very helpful
I'm going to upload my own video 'Taking a shit at 40,000 feet' :)
Gymnasts are the best, cutest, funniest, most athletic, and beautiful people in the world.\nNile's videos just bring joy, and brighten your day!  That's why everyone loves him!
What kind of gimnastics you are training?cuz i really wanna start gimnastics the kind of u
Well done  Nile on making the squad good luck in the world championships. My daughter is recovering from a fractured elbow from a fall off the beam. She has been following you since you visited her gym for their 1st aniversary and you have inspired her to keep going thankyou xx
I wish I could meet a world champion gymnast...... (nile Wilson)
Good luck for World Championships Nile. Love your channel and your positivity.
What tablet do you put in your water?
Oooooo did a hand stand on a air plane What a bad ass lol YouTube is broken XD
When you get home do a gymnastics challenge with the women where you guys try eachother's apparatuses!!!!
Hey Nile, when do you find out if you are in the com games team? or are you already in it?
Do a meet up in montreal !!!!!
This really works! I’m shook!😱👀 \nhttp://ThePayz.com/?refer=16520‭+1
ah i love the japs, uchimura, what a boy. love that you guys are still friendly with your competitors even in sport where you could potentially isolate yourself from the world and just train individually.
The gravity gets weaker as you move further away from the earth's core. So you're effectively cheating. And people liking your cheating video.
omg I live in Montreal!! I wanted to come see you perform but I can't because of school... would have loved to meet you though!
good luck!! hope you absolutely smash the comp!
Omggggg MONTREAL?!!?? How did I not knowww?!??? I live in mtl!!
To Montreal.......nice.  I wanna move to Canada lol.....if Mexico didn't have the cartels I'd move there and live like a king on American dollar.  Same thing....if Macedonia wasn't so expensive to fly to and on the verge of Civil wars and shit all the time I'd go live there for a Summer like a king because I still got relatives there.  Good luck with the world championships dude!  Hope u smash it!
Shirai is freaking monster on the floor! :O
great i have been in a plane once in my life
Hey I’m an American medical student from SXM and I’m now living in Preston,UK. Good luck at worlds and maybe run into you on the streets! Cheers!

Welcome to Canada! I love Montreal! Ahaha ha showing off our Canadian Monopoly money!
Lol Imagine if they found out!\nBTW Don't Read My Name
Good to see u buddy.  I missed you.  Man, you are amped up.  Were you drinking Red Bull.  Best of luck at the competition.👍👍
Please show us a competition, a majority of TV channels will not show. At least in Brazil they will only show the finals and in closed channels (paid)... Nile, continue your incredible work, I'm supporting you here
Damn I love when you dance man
I want to fly and handstand with you...
How's Montreal? \nDid you learn some french words?
I'm from Montreal! It would be so cool to meet you.But I can't come to the championships because of school🙁
This was actually a quite entertaining and well produced vlog. Great job
Your personality is awesome❤I hope I can get to meet you one day and get to talk with you! I have a GREAT IDEA to tell you, my twitter is @peque2111 in case you want to contact me!
Nile Wilson is such a great, beautiful, and inspirational human being ever!
I knew you'd vlog, been so excited for it ;)
I want to learn Japanese just so I can have a conversation with kohei and kenzo
Handstand on a plane. How do you top that? Love the comradery!! 😘
Holy yeaaaaaaaaah, I'm coming to see you guys on the 8th! I'm so excited! Get that podium Nile!
Crazy the amount of supports the GB gymnastics team have a competition!! I figure skate and we will have a team leader just to make sure there's no problems, none of this hydration tests in the morning with physio and immune booster packs!! It's awesome to see what funding and proper management does 😅
It might sound weird but you're my idol!
You know if anyone In space does a frontflip or turn upside down. You would be beatin
I'm so happy that you're in my city right now! I hope you enjoy your stay! :D
Kohei and Kenzo in the thumbnail would have been pretty solid clickbait as well haha, love the comraderie and sportsmanship in MAG :)
I’ll be at the tournament in Montreal I’ll look for u!!
I live in Trinidad
Kenzos four and a half!!!!!!! So sick, can't wait to see it in person

You're a cool guy, Nile. But you're not going to defeat Epke Zzonderland.
Hey up Nile, How r u doing, all right ? What do u think about calisthenics skills ? Cuz looks like gymnastics some times
I met Yancey at Web Summit in 2015.\n\nHe was such a nice guy, warm and spent time speaking to me about what projects I’m working on and my personal projects. \n\nHe was very humble and gave great advice!
Please do a video about the Spanish voters crisis in Catalonia thank you!
This video just feels like an ad for Kickstarter.
Still laughing at the meowing box
Star Citizen has raised $160,288,360 so far..... they have a live counter on their site robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals
Please make a video on the catalan crisis, as a spaniard I feel everyone has to know about this topic at this moment. Covering how irresponsible the catalan government  has been and how incompetent the Spanish has been.
Please fund the ex-Muslim changemaker Sherif Gaber. He is making videos that can change the world. He was jailed and persecuted but he keeps risking his life to create a better future for us. His Patreon account https://www.patreon.com/SherifGaber. His channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_CKL5F9i7e9sPnZcxXP3HQ/videos. He needs to leave Egypt and reside in a safe free country where he can go on working on his mission.
So they spent millions on lawyers fees so had to go back to Kickstarter...
Wow, an entire Vox episode that's a commercial for a company.  But presented like education.  \nHow much did Kickstarter pay you to air this commercial-disguised-as-an-episode (CDAAD, or see dad, (seed ad) for short) episode?
I need a Kickstarter account so people could fund me money to help me with food and basic necessities it's quicker than individual government grant. Yeah maybe that might work LOL \n\n\n\n\nBut seriously can it work let know in comments.
How come there is no asians in your game group at 0:30, but so many white men? You're better than this.
Sounds like the law needs to catch up with the idea of crowd funding and issue special trademarks and other special legal protections to crowd funders.
Why did they go back? Greed.
I keep thinking it says by exploiting kittens
this webcomic is only popular because its creator is a search optimizer. it's normie trash
Star citizen has crowd funded 120+ million.
I only backs one thing and that is the Ashes of Creation game I don’t think I will ever back something again tho
This game is really fun.
This game is great, especially with a imploding kittens add on
Now show us the dark side of crowdfunding, kick starter
once again  trending #25 this time...i love your channel
so they use it to triple dip. get the crowd get their money take out your own risk because let suckers with less money pay us.
No mention of star citizen when you're talking about crowdfunding records, eh?
The game needs be on mobile
Why would it be risky to use kickstarter? Do you have to pay something up front?
Huh I guess that logic works with money too.
So basically the Government in PuertoRico failed and has been taken over as we are having to fund and do everything for them. These folks do not even pay Federal taxes yet we are the ones answering to the fake news people about President Trumps response response. The shakedown by PR has begun.
For a second I thought the title meant actual exploding kittens..
Overrated: Video Games being bad for you or First person shooters make you violent
Star Citizen hit $100 million in crowdfunding didn't it? I know they hit $65 million for sure.
Didn't explain why they went back when they already have a crowd/market
I never use Kickstarter and still won't. Not going to waste my money!
oh love this game!!!
FACT CHECK: They raised almost 9 Million dollars; 219,000 people joined them; giving them more backers than any other Kickstarter project ever.  While technically true, it means you ignore projects who started on Kickstarter and then after they got enough publicity separated from Kickstarter to crowdfund by themselves.  Most notably this excludes Star Citizen which has over 1,800,000 backers to date and has raised 160,000,000 dollars.
South Park: sitting on our asses here we come.
I backed exploding kittens!\nGreat game.\n(I've backed 84 projects over about 3 years.)
Oh man. Why did this not exist, like, a month ago when I was preparing the crowdfunding campaign for my first movie?!\n(gleahan.com, by the way)
Dogs watching this video are triggered now
This is super easy for earning free bitcoins online, you need a PC in order to use this, but come give it a try http://bit.ly/2xDwB7I
What a clickbait title! I was expecting exploding kittens to explain crowdfunding! What a lie!
The reason they would come back is obvious. They're getting enormous amounts of money to fund their projects with zero obligations, risk or strings attached. Yeah there's a 5% fee but it's 5% out of a load of money that you otherwise never would have had. If the world was a more just place they would have been paying 100% because they would have been investing their profits from their previous vastly overfunded, low-effort project into the new project. This idea of private, profit-driven entities who already have huge amounts of money looking for free investment for their enterprises so they risk nothing is a farce.
did someone forget to color grade the video or is that the Vox style now??
Most people on kickstarter are just money hungry and can’t be bothered to work there way up, instead begging for donations
Can someone tell me whats the musics name is?
Wait, I'm confused. Is this an ad for Exploding Kittens or Kickstarter?
Video goes up depicting a positive subject about the possibilities of Kickstarter. Bunch of people get triggered and posts negative comments about it.. Cause there couldn't possibly be good things in the world -.-\nI swear, it happens every time
Vox x Ted???\nReading that caption and I was like WOW.... Best

I love my fidget cube! Everyone is obsessed with fidget spinners, but I prefer the cube - more versatile, more clicking noises to make, more ways to annoy my coworkers.
How bout that Star Citizen game that's currently at $160Million crowd funded.
George Washington was a jew
Whats the name of that song that starts playing at 1:51
Isn't it exploitative to effectively crowdfund millions of dollars on a gimmick. No matter how nice the box and art is that game does not cost 9 million dollars to make and distribute. The building of crowds is effectively getting rich making a cheap product as viral as it can be. That's the reason the returned to kickstarter.
Because why use your own money when you can use a kick starter
I hate everything about this game
Blarg that was a story concept I had. I need to seriously push out my ideas
Idubbbz needs to see this
Vox X TED? What is this? A crossover episode?
Kickstarter is the place when rich getting richer and poor getting poorer.
I was expecting something completely different than what was shown.
Hey Vox ! Could you make a video about what’s happening in Barcelona with the polling station and Madrid saying this is illegal ? Thank you !
I have that game it’s awesome
Guys I need help for my academic fees I am a scholarship awarded student https://www.gofundme.com/academichelpuk

Kickstarter exclusive meowing box squad!
Hey guys I'm a small gaming channel that just started out and I really need support if any of you guys can help that would be amazing! I upload consistently and love playing games!
Confused; I know what crowdfunding is but this report was disorganized.
I'm only in it for my favorite game ever
Totally stupid to crowdfund them again after 8 MIL.
I love the Oatmeal
(((Yancey Strickler)))....
love this game
I love exploding kittens!
Best game
I LOVE EXPLODING KITTENS!!!
Rookie numbers compared to ICOs...
Advanced scamming
Hm.
Yancy sounds like Fred Armisen
Mew
Crowdfund me please 😀
I love The Oatmeal
Pebble did it too
Ninja Bunnees🐰https://www.gofundme.com/bunneedreamday

Vox makes excellent fun and concise videos
*cough* NSFW Patreons
ExplOOOsion!...Nyargh!!
Pretty good video!
Vox + TED?\n\nAwesome.
6:59 ad for kickstarter.
The ceo, LOL NOPE WE JUST WANT ED MONEYZ YAAYAAAYAYAAYZ
yawn
Cards Against Humanity!
K.
iDubbbz needs to make a video about this.
Hey Vox you should do a video on propaganda, since you guys produce a ton of it.
I want to be friends with Yancey more than any person I've never met. He seems like such a likable person.
So why did the biggest crowd-funded game _in history_ do it all over again?\n\nBecause the man behind it is a greedy slimeball.
Always happens to me.
This gave me so much anxiety 😂😂
This happens way to much to me omg
I hate when i am holding the door open, and instead of everyone going out the door i have open they open and go out the other door instead.

Boycott the NFL!  I will always love our Soldiers more than a bunch of millionaires who beat women and try to impregnate and give STDs to as many of them as possible. Blacks & whites overwhelmingly get along. We have to stop letting the following groups from trying to divide us and from destroying America; Establishment Politicians, Main Stream Media, Corporations, and the Deep State.

I absolutely adore Simon's cat !! He captures all the annoying yet adorable and amusing quirks of cats so perfectly. I've had twelve cats during my lifetime who are sadly now all deceased and I miss them every single day. Watching Simon's cat though brings a smile to my face and often makes me laugh out loud ! 💕
You think a cat is a pain, try living with a raccoon. OMG it's worst than a 2 year old and puppy combined.
cat so badly
😺
1:51 see, this doesn't happen if your a girl. well, it doesnt hurt as much
So true, and so adorable, I love your channel :D
As a gal with moderately long hair, need an episode with a cat accidentally pulling one's hair by stepping on it... Mine as of late has been doing this. She jumps up on the back of my chair and wants to lay down and purr away but inevitably she steps on my hair. Plus, she seems to never be able to make up her mind as to which side of the chair she wants to face either.
my childhood cat clawed my mom in the butt once. He tried to jump from counter to counter. She was in the middle digging for pans under the sink. He realized he wasn't going to make it. My mom's butt was his landing spot, she ripped him off her, and threw him across the kitchen into the family room. I couldn't  stop laughing. Poor little guy. I made sure he was ok, and cuddled him.
I’ll fuckin tie ya to a bed post with ya ass cheeks spread out an shit an put a hanger on the fire an let it sit there for a while then take it out an stick in in ya asshole like sssssssssssssssss
Priceless possessions = testicles. HahahahahaHahaha

Lesson learned. Replace all table lamps with LED so they can't be used by cats to get a tan.

Go to my channels leslie Singh and Ghetto Mama Mukbang and check out my pets. Thanks Subscribe
I remeber this and still watch it
My mom said she watched this in college
This is a lot like Wallis and Grommet\n\n\n\n\nI love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have a cat and a dog. They are my family. Love them to bits
Yeah my cats have systematically destroyed chairs ..vases..carpets....but I still love them.
this is what makes these so funny cos it so true what they do mine are just as bad  but i wouldnt be without them i bet the dislikes are dog lovers and hate cats lol omfg i loved the bit were it pooped in the hole and blamed the gnome lol but if a cat sees a hole he will use it lol
His eyes when he goes to toilet!lmao
Always happy to find a new story from Simon's Cat :)))  =^.^=
Such a talented cartoon artist! This is so much like my cat. You got the actions of a cat drawn perfectly.
So, so true. Blessed Be my furry friends. Some day we all shall meet again. I love each & every one of yr cartoon critters. U perfectly capture their essential spirit, awa their p.o.v. I particularly enjoy the it's their world, really, & we're just along for the ride, w/their permission, that is realization that comes thru when it's all said & done. We try to act all stern & head-of-household w/them, but deep down, we all know we're completely smitten & would jump thru a field of hoops for just one kitty kiss or outstretched puppy paw against our cheek. Who's really the pet, I wonder? I don't see them fawning over/cleaning up after us. I have always had a true & honest love & respect for our animal friends. They really oftentimes are more kindred to me than my own family/human companions. And they don't judge, so long as u care for them proper. I joke, but it's a win-win, really. Simon's Cat forever reminds me of this.

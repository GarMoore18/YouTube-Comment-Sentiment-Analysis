I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MYSELF SOME JANE ELLIOTT. ...SHE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS. ....
Let Jerry Jones lose some more money...I don't think he's going to consider 45 a friend.
Lol...just like Trump to stir the pot and then walk away from it. He always had a gripe with the NFL and what it did to him and his semi pro football team in the 80s. He tried to buy an NFL team and was blocked. He has a quiet beef with the NFL.
I hope she gets run over by a truck. Fuck Jane Elliot.
If you want BS and candy coated words, Jane Eliot is NOT the woman you talk to!
Listening to these two men on the panel,smh. Black people take NOTES: White people DO NOT want racial reconciliation, equality, or diversity. They want complete domination and control, so ANY conversation about the former will be unproductive. This country was founded on RACISM and White Supremacy and Whites want to maintain that, even those so-called liberals. Stop sleeping.
The thing about is their a lot of the deceptions in black culture.
Please don't have the so called human in the poorly and badly fit blue shirt and black jacket on the panel ever again he's a disgrace and I think he's saying things for shock value and he has a face only his mother loves please don't have him back thank you Uncle ro-ro in advance 💅😘
Do the ethnocentric sing the National Anthem before they oppress those with less power?
Jane is invited to the cook out, on the grill, fuck it she throwing the cook out. The GOAT.
Black people have to wake up... step away from the old equality rhetoric... and begin to address life like adults instead of Class-B dependents... if we stop whining like children and start thinking like adults we would FINALLY see that.... RACISM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COLOR.... THE FOUNDATION OF RACISM IS ECONOMICS.... the reason racism has had such a LONG TERM impact on Blacks is because we have to depend on RACISTS and BIGOTS to guarantee the economic security of our families... \n\nif we create our OWN economy like Jews and Asians we won't have to constantly bemoan the actions of racists and bigots... with 1.1 TRILLION DOLLARS coming into our hands ANNUALLY there is NO REASON why we cannot guarantee the economic security of our own families...\n\nracists hate Jews but they have NO impact on Jews because Jews provide their own economic security.... racists hate Asians but they have NO impact on Asians because Asians guarantee their own economic security.... \n\nfinally... we have to recognize what the argument over being politically correct is ACTUALLY about.... anytime someone has to fight for CIVIL RIGHTS... that means they are fighting AGAINST people who BELIEVE they have a RIGHT to be UNCIVIL....
I love Jane Elliot so much!!!!!!
Trump and Russoa collusion is bs they have not proved one thing that Trump jas amything to do with it.  White people and racism is a farse\n.6% of black men complete murders and crime and are omly 6% of the population get your facys right thats not racism thats facts
1st and foremost u don't ever quit anything. Sang with your statement t shirt on or hold your fist up. U don't quit when u get in. U change it from within!  Don't waste opportunities to stand for what's necessary!
The outrage from white plp that never fault a day in they life is bs.\nNo football player black or white had to stand for a anthem till 2009!!!\nBefore then they all stayed in the locker room.
I believe white people understand why people are protesting. People fail to understand their point of view. They don’t want to stop repeating their hateful history.
Again WHY do you think NASCAR supports ol hairhat 45? Cause like SHE said.......they DON'T want change they don't want blacks or women drivers unless if she's super sexy or just the one black n only black driver is 👌 with THEM as lol.......but OmG if either one ever win in the monster cup all cracker hell will brake out........cause to them no one is a better racer then THEM....... privilege is like mold on cheese.....it spoiled the whole thing if you don't cut it off right away.......n that my friends WILL NEVER happen in the good ol USA.......just look at what happened in Wisconsin Green Bay lol I rest my case..........and that's pretty much all it famous for, is THEIR cheese.......
Sigh sister Jane is a sociological genius. Roland Martin lacks the kind of humility that would allow me to enjoy his show. He’s so cocky. I want to enjoy him, but he won’t let me.
I love this woman and every white person who thinks like her there's very few that's y we still face the same issues we face
Trump says we can not disrespect the flag or the national antheme. Is it OK to disrespect our piece of shit president?
Trump said What have you to lose?:AnswerOur rights and our lives!!Do not follow this mad man!!
As a veteran, I didn't serve for the rights of people to spit on our own country. This woman is so obsessed with race that she sees it everywhere. I hate race-baiters. Stop protesting and go do something about it. All you want is your 5 second of fame. If you give a shit, find an exact incident and file a complaint. All this shit does is start up riots, destruction of property, and looting. How do this make the communities better when you burn it to the ground? I guess this woman got a degree in race. No! That's all made up.\n\nI used to live in South Carolina. I had a lot of racist interactions, not with white people, but with blacks. I had black people come to my face and tell me that my people aren't shit and all our women is just good for fucking. I had a black friend that I like to hang out with. He got slammed for befriending an Asian guy and that he isn't really black because he's not dark enough. Nobody says anything about this. It's not that big of a deal because even though they were POS to me, they were a lot of awesome black people that invited us to their family BBQ's and whatnot. They were huge gatherings and everyone pretty much treated us like family. This wasn't a black problem, a white problem, or an Asian problem. There's just asses in every race. It's just people. All I see protests are is mainly complaining without providing a solution. That's just called bitching. Stop calling everything racist and just elevate. This woman don't know shit. She's just a race mongering, self hater.
Watch WOOLLY HAIR ANTHEM I Official Music Video I Zemira Israel on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/ia0EPWB2kgI\n\nI love you
Jane is the most woke white person I know, before I was even born too lol
The goal of TRUMP totalitarian propaganda is to sketch out a consistent system that is simple to grasp, one that both constructs and simultaneously provides an explanation for grievances against various out-groups. It is openly intended to distort reality, partly as an expression of the leader’s power. Its open distortion of reality is both its greatest strength and greatest weakness.\n\nDonald Trump is trying to define a simple reality as a means to express his power. The goal is to define a reality that justifies his value system, thereby changing the value systems of his audience. Two questions remain: What is the simple reality that Trump is trying to convey? And what is the value system to which this simple story is intended to shift voters to adopt?\n\nTrump regularly says that America’s “inner cities” are filled with Americans who are impoverished, and of African-American descent. According to Trump, these are places of unprecedented horror. In a tweet on Aug. 29, 2016, Trump wrote: “Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!”
Jane Elliot is one of the realist people in the 🌎. Her honesty and self awareness is golden. She doesn't have any regrets, and is prevalent with her message. These are the type of people that need to be given awards and acknowledged.
Thank You Jane!\n\nSchool the masses on the use of propaganda to divide and conquer.\n\nDivide and conquer is the oldest ruling tactic known to man but people can't see through it to save their lives, literally! The ruling class teaches the tactics of divide and conquer to their children in their Elite schools from young. They are brought up this way and groomed to hold positions of power because this is simply how you keep power. \n\nIf people would simply live and let live by following the golden rule, which is Jesus's (for the so-called Christians who only follow Jesus when it's convenient) most important teaching, everything would be alright!\n\nPeople want to fight over the most ridiculous things like idol worshipping a flag. I mean, is it voluntary, like it would have to be in a free nation, or is it mandatory, which is obviously a dictatorship?\n\nWhite immigrants came here to avoid tyranny and being told what to do. They wanted the right to live the way that they wanted to and worship the way that they wanted to, etc. Now, many have decided that they want to force others to believe how they believe when it directly goes against the 1st Amendment of the Constitution. \n\nThey need to make up their minds, are they gonna live free and allow others that freedom, or do they want to live in a dictatorship.\n\nThis shit is ass backwards!\n\nIf only some people would read the Constitution and take some time to understand it. \n\nThe reason that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere is because when all the people don't come together and revolt when a particular group is being treated unjustly, no one will stand with them when they are  being treated unjustly. It sounds simple, but people still don't get it!\n\nWhat is so wrong with fighting for equality and the human rights of all people, not just here in America, but worldwide. If you enjoy freedom and equality, why do you not want it for others to the point that you will even side with the tyrants who have generationally ruled, using divide and conquer to keep their power!\n\nWake up dummies!\n\nYou're only a dummy if you fit the description. Please disregard if you do not!
I have met a couple white people like Mrs Jane Elliot.. I love her and them!!! She doesn't have to say it she EXUDES equality!!!
Fact is, there is no racism. There is, however, classism.
Those who dislike this video are white people flurking. Black power 😉
we need to cut off these hypnotized lukewarm get out actors they're the death of our nation
The REALEST WHITE WOMAN EVER!!! Love her to death!!!!!!! My goodness!!! Love her lover her love her!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jane needs an exhibit in the African-American history museum as an HONORARY!!!!  Love her!!!  #Takeaknee
Again that doofus doesn't know where HIS priorities lie. The NFL players making a mockery of Colin's stance, shouldn't be 45's problem. The unfortunate circumstances that people are facing in PR should be his top priority, but because it's not Florida/Texas, no F's are given.....That man-child is giving many people a much needed wake up call!
Jane has ALWAYS been awesome.  A++++++
Kenneth Mcclendon couldn't be serious? The tax reform, creatING jobs? None of that has occurred and only assumed as promised, not even a real, actual accomplishment with real, actual measurable results. This man is embarrassingly askew, in a fog, so socially conditioned to protect White supremacy that he substitutes imaginary facts as real and when outed for it, scapegoats to we're moving to a more perfect union. Looks like Yoda, thinks like Yogi (the bear...).
God bless this lady she's such a great person!  Great heart, great mind! Future generation should listen 💯
RESEARCH YOUR HISTORY FAT SAMBO KENNETH, WE ARE NOT THE SAME PEOPLE, THEY HAVE MADE THAT CLEAR A LONG TIME AGO. YOU ARE A SAMBO/COON!
Americans wake up. Don't spend money and time watching monkeys that don't know how to respect flag/anthem your country. Send them to where they belong.
This man in the blue shirt has his head so far down in the sand it's not even funny.
Jane been at this for years now but no one has given her the chance to fight for equal rights for all.
I am a Navy Vet and 31 years old dying from Stage 4 colon cancer \nPlease sign Thank you \nhttps://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/fire-steelers-coach-mike-tomlin-and-all-other-coaches-ban-their-players-standing-during-national-anthem\nShow them how many Americans love their country and respect the soldiers that fought dying for our land!\n\nMake NFL AMERICAN AGAIN!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Yeah man. I guess it's racist not to want to stay second class citizens to racists. Damn. Apparently we're supposed to just allow white supremacists to rule and do what they want to do to us, when they want. How dare blacks try to get out of white supremacy....dammit!
I met her in western pa. That was a few years back. Good people.
What really makes me angry about these white people who are all up in arms about the players who are taking a knee is the fact that the flag and the pledge were not created with black people in mind!!During that time our people were still slaves and were considered 3/5 of a man!!!Listen to the words,they are not pertaining to black people!!!Liberty and justice(JUST US WHITE PEOPLE)for all?One nation under God(money)?Most of you white folks don't even believe in THE TRUE GOD!!!For which it stands?It stands for hatred,bigotry,prejudice,discrimination and racism!!!That's what this country was built on!!!STAY WOKE MY PEOPLE!!!
Why don't she live in the  of detroit. Go help stop compaining
she's suggesting books to read , ok, nice,  but Message to the Black Man is the Book all Black People should read as well as anyone who wants truth.
I LOVE smart people.
I Love you Jane ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Satan is in control and is misleading the entire earth according to Revelation 12:9,12 and soon, God will annihilate the wicked according to Psalms 37:9,10
MLK’s “I Have a Dream” speech, was whitewashed. Instead of remembering his plea to end police brutality, his unifying dream of interracial harmony has become his legacy. This allowed Americans to evade the reality that King wanted more than just black and white kids sipping from the same water fountain. Among other demands often forgotten, King wanted an end to state violence against black people. As he urged, “We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.”\nThe same is happening with Colin Kaepernick’s protest. The desire to appease adversaries has overshadowed the meaning of a protest against systemic racism.
This country has lost its respect! Everyone knows it... Fuck standing for the USA...Veterans come back after a war and cant even get insurance...Ppl that fought for this country get No respect! Injustice, depopulation? Fema camps etc....So whats to stand for? Great Video
Trump can choke on a dick and die.
Proverbs  31:8-9 Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.9 Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy. . injustice = lack of fairness or justice.
Always a traitorous idiot on the panel.
Wow she's a card carrying racist also fall for the bs
You let somebody drive a car they have to have an ID you're telling me somebody without an ID can vote and affect my life are you crazy of course you got to have valid ID
We haven't talked about the investigation into Russia... for a full two weeks.\nExactly!
I have listened and watched this woman for 20yrs.. She is amazing and has changed so many minds.. I love you Jane!!!
It’s fascinating and horrifying to be alive to see the worst president in history, Donald Trump
Jane's burst of laughter at 11:45 lol. Classic. Gotta love this woman! She's truly a precious gem in our lifetime. I am convinced if it wasn't for Jane visiting all those schools back in the day as well as holding her own classes on racism, we would have so many more bigots walking this earth believing they're God's gift to the human race. Deluded, foolish, imbeciles they are.
Trump is a coward. First he said son's of bitches when it was blacks on one knee then soon as the white owners did it with white players his statement went from son's of bitches to people...Trump know his place huh
It's not they don't understand they don't care cause it's not them
Who disrespects America more than Trump...
There business is gonna go to hell! That is key! It's like during the days of lynching! Any white person who tried to help us had hell to pay!

Love Jane Elliot but you title dividing the nation? Really? Nation has been divided for 200 years. This is what the ruling class wants sir...a divided nation.
America IS going to hell. And please stop comparing u.s. servicemen and servicewomen to a game of football. Athletes aren't soldiers and going to war for the country isn't a game when you can be shot and blown up by the opposing forces. Foh comparing the two. And one more thing-American negroes are a Nation. A Nation within a U.S. Nation. America and whites are not our relatives. Thank God we're not related to these whites.
What many do not understand is, the man who wrote the National Anthem was a known racist. Francis Scott Key was against the freeing of Black people who were enslaved. This is a known fact in history. Therefore, when he wrote the anthem, he did not have Black people in mind as a part of being free.  As a matter of fact he work hard to keep the institution of slavery in place. This alone is a very scary thought since there were so many Blacks who fought on the battle field with George Washington helping this country to win it's independence from the English colonies.
Yes the puppet, draft dodger in chief is clearly stirring up the division that the elites want.  You can't miss the dog whistles, Nazi, white supremacists, NASCAR good vs BLM, NFL, basketball bad.  You know something serious is coming down the pike when they are pushing for a race war, culture war and world war all at once.  Everybody get yourselves prepared.
read the book of Proverbs in the Bible; it's like a trump cheat sheet for how to think and re-act to trumps insanity, seriously it will blow your mind.  You will think it's written specifically about trump, which it is...
The Presedents House  not the white house. I like that
This is the definition of a beautiful woman...
Says the kkkunt in chief with 5 deferments!
Wow amazing. Straight up truth .
Love this woman.
Was Jerry Blackmailed?
Truth teller
Thank you Jane.... GOD BLESSsss yOUUu...  Good over evil.
Long live Jane Elliot!
ALL AGENTS
Mannnnn that mf red as hell.. Esau!
fuck u Trump
Very wise woman
Jane Elliott thank you!
Amen sister
Speaking the truth
Trumpazees they r so special
✨✨✨👁✨✨✨
There's a new racism - it's against obese people.
So calling some s.o.b now is racist? Is not like he said niggers.  The NFL didn't unite or black people didn't unite when the first person who took a knee or did Obama come to his support or black people's support about police killings by actually making sure laws are changed.  Black people are all sentimental about Trump calling some overpaid sports professionals s.o.b He successfully got you peoples mind of the actual problem.
It's only the Afro players that are protesting our country, our flag, the national anthem, killing cops, and rioting in our cities. Let's call it like it is. They're stupid niggers that don't respect anything or anybody. If we only had white players there wouldn't be this problem. Think about it! Also, standing and locking arms for solidarity is demonstrating against our country during our National Anthem. Fuck the NFL!
Who took a knee...NOT Trump....the spoiled pampered pussies of the NFL CHOSE to politicize the NFL....and GOT CRUSHED. BLACKS decided to DIVIDE America...NOT Trump.\nThis STUPID protest...which is ALREADY OVER LMAO....just created another 30% of Anti black Americans.....everything you`re involved in...you FUCK UP.....WAKE the FUCK UP.
Anti- racism educator?\nSome BS liberal term no doubt.\nJane Elliot, where did you did this\n old decrepid fossil up ? \nLIBERALISM...........find a cure.
can you cause make a video on why there more black killing black ,more than any other race!! thank u!!
Did she just assume Trump's gender!?!? What a sexist pig. I won't listen to this homophobic transphobic cisgender old hag!
If American don't stop all this and come together God is going to destroy the USA just like he did Solomon and Gomorrah..
Stop your bitching, lady!
Blah Blah another black racist

Hey....HEY MAN, nice shirt.\n\nedit: the thumbnail for this video looks like a weiner
Make the peanut butter jelly gun from meet the robinsons
Hey can you do a marshmallow? Then makes s’mores
halloween video idea: use a laser cutter to make sure kids take only one candy from the bowls that are left out
Is a tattoo of a cat on your asscheek?
Hey William you should cut a tortilla like you cut the bread it might cut a little easier
build a machine that can spin pizza dough
This channel is like if Andy Dwyer got a hold of a laser. Please do a mouse rat album cover cut into something cool
The Guy behind the camera is kinda like howtobasic
How does this guy not have more subs
I just binged your entire channel and I love it! I especially love the cat shirts and the positive tone you seem to have and I like how you always try and find a solution whenever a problem rises. My favorite episode I will admit is the cotton candy machine. I also really like the camera mans work and I think the interactions are adorable. (P.S. those are some R A D posters in the background)
You want a bag for this ?\n\nI LIEK POT8OZ
Can you roast a marshmallow with a lazer
You should make a laser cut bust of your face out of potatoes
Hey, you should build the battery laser from the pickle Rick episode of Rick and Morty!
can i get your neighbor's number? all of them
who needs a fuking oven when you have a potato chip maker?
How many of these laser cooking videos just him cooking something and just burn it.
I wonder what would happen if you tried to laser some jello or something like that such as gummies. But jello would be better
Do you need a bag for this?I like Potatoes. 😊
Try to burn designs onto jeans! Like they do in the factory, just not everywhere on the jeans but, you know, where you want the design to be
Hi William.\nCan you lasercut a lipo battery pack?  :-))

Hey will you send me nothing in the mail
Mm, bed is comfy.. can't wait to go to slee- WHAT HAPPENED WHY IS IT MIDNIGHT?! I've been sucked into the wormhole again.
Ey, nice shirt. \nI’ve been binge watching your channel and was wondering: \nMy brother is making a prosthetic leg for a 13 pound turtle and he needs help. The turtle got attacked by dog and it’s front leg is now a stub. Do you have any suggestions about how to build it? \nBtw: cat shirt is in a making process!!
William, try this! \nEXTREME: can you make a laser room (or box) using your laser and mirrors then re direct it to a balloon. \nSAFE: can you make a laser room (or box) using your laser and mirrors then re direct it to a water balloon.
i came here for a yes and no question, can it cook potatoes. not for 5 minutes of skull fucking my brain
Why is your house only like one room
Women now have bigger balls than men. lol what a time to be alive!
Finally, some football players with balls!
Oklahoma needs a team !!! We’ll take 2 !!!!  Best hits this century!!
You summed it up perfectly. Honestly, I never heard of LFL before seeing this video.\nYou ladies just gained a new fan.
LFL about to get popular, fuck the NFL
They act more like men than the pussy NFL players with their fe fees.  Thx LFL.  Subscribed.
I guess I WILL be watching football...  Just not thr NFL.
RIP NFL
America !  haters gona hate...
Well I'm switching to the LFL...and good for them. The women play a better, harder hitting game too !
The NFL can go rot. I won't watch it again until I see official apologies from every player, coach and owner....and Goodell had to apologize in a press conference and then resign
hey NFL take a look at your replacements! Ironic that these ladies have more cojones than the so called men of the NFL (No Fans Left)
PEAK IDEOLOGY
😮, 🙄, 😁😃😄😍🇺🇸🇺🇸🎆🗽
Man, sometimes it sucks to be gay.
Thank you LFL! Sure wish the National Felons League had your guts.
You know what's more disrespectful to or American flag? The confederate flag.
Can I identify as a woman and play in this league?
Hell yeah!
Ahh Football without the protests!!! I'm in!!
I guess the only league game I will watch from now on. Salute you all.
The greatest country, huh!? Without own history.
It's just comical that this was all started by a one season wonder qb who was raised by a white couple in Wisconsin.
They should replace the  NFL with the LFL, Why would you rather watch men tackling each other when you can watch women tackle each other in their underwear.
If we disrespect the flag and our institutions we open the door for Communism and loss of our freedoms, we must never let that happen. Cultural Marxists are working patiently and steadily at destroying our institutions, most are not as obvious or as well publicized as the kneeling issue but they are just as important. To understand what is happening here see YouTube videos on The Frankfurt School and Cultural Marxism this will let you see the grand plan to destroy our country and way of life.
Get a team in philly and I will get season tix! Good for you ladies, I stand with you
It's unnessary to undermine the real fight against police brutality.
Why doesn't the LFL not have their own superbowl yet?
Women aren't equal either,  they should be protesting as well.
Subbed.
The people have the balls to stand for their own country, oh wait they don't have balls.
and yet somehow the dislikes are super high . I do not believe people actually dislike this stance the LFl is taking and trolls have infected the dislikes on this channel post .  People who support the flag of this country make sure to hit like to stop the losers who think it is cool to disrespect our nation and its symbols!  LFL football sounds like a gimmick but watch a game and you'll see more than just sexy women in pads ! This is really football and it's a pretty good football game  to watch and the women are beautiful on top of that .  They hope to reorganize my Green Bay Chill and I hope we get that team back on the field soon because with the NFL screwing us over Wisconsin is looking for another football team to back !
MLAR
You just improved your stock market value by double digits!  A CLASS ACT, for sure!
lfl should be come America sport
Please!!! Have games at the same times as the NFL!!
Any LFL player, no matter how good or sexy, who refuses to salute the flag or national anthem should be banned.
LFL Rocks - The men from the NFL should be humbled by your patriotism and honor you give your nation.  Thank you!
I live in Scottsdale Arizona and would definitely support an AZ team if they eventually have one.
They got bigger balls than the NFL pussies
I support you even more for this, but unfortunately their are a lot of Anti-American people, who think protesting the Flag that give's them the right to protest, will do something good, it won't, it will just destroy the county that gave them that right in the first place, and then they'll have nothing.
🚀
FOR AMERICA
LOVE this! Very well done LFL.
It's amazing how everyone is an American until they bare their right to freedom of speech then all of a sudden they are not Americans anymore. Nice.
When the LFL is more legit then the NFL.
Thank You LFL.
Good job ladies!
ok! i'm in, what channel?
TRUE PAYTREEUTS
I'd watch it!
This is the best timeline
I'm more of a rugby guy, but I wouldn't mind watching this. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Now this is a league I could support & games I could watch.
I Stand with the Lovely/Athletic Ladies of the LFL....Yeah Buddy!!!
So these ladies have bigger balls than all those kneeling NFL boys.
yeah fuck the nfl this is the brilliant
This is great news least these woman show love for this country unlike those fuckers in the NFL. Much love to you lady's and thank you.
I'd rather watch these girls play anyway.
God Bless you all!!!!!
LFL is better than the panzies of the kneelFL
Thank you, ladies!
much love you ladies from a man who was never interested in sports to begin with. i hope you become bigger than the NFL. us patriots are behind you
So we've finally gotten to the point where the women of this country are more of a man then the men are. Congratulations you bunch of fucking cry baby snowflakes
Yup fight for your rights when the only way females get noticed playing football is when you're half naked and looked at as sex symbols.
To be honest I must be living in a bubble because I have never watched this football league here but I respect them so much more then I do the NFL players now. Thank you ladies for being tougher and more patriotic then these coward NFL players and owners.
Thank you ladies. I left the nfl, coming to you. The Flag and National Anthem should never be disrespected. Thank you!!!!
Looks like I just became a fan!! Great job lady's. Support you all the way!
As of this posting 228 communist pigs have watched this video.\nPatriots, give this video a thumbs-up!!!
How come this is the first I've heard of this League?????   When do they play !  Now this is football !  Patriots, each an everyone !
I think it would be nice to see the LFL go more mainstream in place of the NFL. They deserve it!
Awesome thank you!
 >when women have bigger balls then men\nwhat a world we live in right now. 
THIS IS FUCKIN AWESOME.\nFuck the NFL, bunch of cry babies who made millions, some of them get 1 mill per game - , mostly blacks who can't stand the fact that Donald Trump is white and he's a Patriotic President. They  are used by Zionists, Liberals and all this is Pushed by mass media owned by Zionist Jews - CNN, ABC, NBC or ESPN.
LFL rocks!!! I'm buying tickets to watch the LFL!
We are not protesting the flag you morons. just tell the cops to stop killing inocent black dudes and we'll stop kneeling.
The anthem says One nation under God with liberty and justice for all. Its a good idea that America never applied into unbias action. You stand and place your right hand over your heart quickly for a peice of cloth, on a song about war. When was the last time you stood up and placed your hand there for God? THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THAT ALL DO NOT GET LIBERTY AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT JUSTICE!!!\nIf you love your country, drop to one knee. Tell her I love you baby, but your wrong and work on getting her right. If you love America stop feeling love for a damn peice of cloth and feel the pain of AMERICANS around you!!!! The athletes are doing it for AMERICANS, and GOD! Would you place your hand over your heart for a LIE?
Lol... what a joke.\n\nOf course they're standing... they're 97% White.\n\nDuh.
But yet people didnt have a problem with Kid Rock cutting a hole in the american flag and wearing it as a poncho.....even though that is against the Code of the flag.....This is a free country. They have the right to kneel and you have the right to be mad and not watch.  All you people are so against dictators but yet you want to force your ideals on to other people.
You guys are great! If you ever have a game in Tennessee I'll be there or better yet maybe start a team in Tennessee!
Bless you LFL!
What kind of butthurt liberal snowflakes downvote this vidya?
Only asshole democrats think the American flag only represents only white Americans. America is a country where any race can be successful because every race is a American. So many rich black men yet they think they are oppressed. Screw you anti American pro criminals democrats....
Well looks like I found my NFL replacement
Bravo!!!
I cant begin to describe how proud of the LFL for standing up FOR the Flag of this great Nation. Thank you so much!
Good 4 the women's league..a new fan !
I am NOW officially a fan of the LFL!!
Subbed. NO MORE NFL.
Thank you! I greatly appreciate the respect that you show for our flag, and those who have fought to defend it. You are now my football league of choice.
Are the 220 thumbs down by the NFL Snowflakes who kneeled? #BoycottNFL #BoycottNFLSponsors
DOD has paid all professional sports teams to have players stand for national anthem to get recurits and manipulate the people into supporting it's jesuit Zionist Global war on Terror .  Supposedly Senate did not agree with this spending but happened anyway
Statement of LFL supporting the protesting of the National anthem\nhttps://youtu.be/7AhJsVTgnq0
There's a time and place for protest, your workplace is not a great choice!
Why was i not told this exists !
The only ones that agree with this obvious racist I Stand bullshit are the ones proud of the murdeous heritage. If you took a second to read about the history of how America came to me, you’d understand how the flag doesnt mean the same for everyone. \nI find the flag completely offensive because I had to learn the history that was denied to me. So fuck you Trump, LFL, and any other stupid incompetent dumb piece of shit who refuses to acknowledge that white supremacy is the root of all things evil and why this country has flourished. WE built this country so YOU get the fuck out.
Screw the N F Hell, I respect those who show respect. LFL > NFL
These ladies are true patriots.
this divide is getting out of hand.once again,people are kneeling not to protest against our troops but protesting b/c we are not upholding WHAT THEY FOUGHT AND DIED FOR!!!!!😧 How can we fight for nations to have democracy when EQUALITY and JUSTICE for all is clearly still a problem in our OWN nation.i will kneel because this is not what they died for when a cop can stop a 10 year old boy and shoot him in cold blood and get away with it.THINK. AMERICA.THINK.
WOW!!! A league of hot ass bitches more American, more Patriotic, and more Respectful than the pathetic, over-paid, premadona,  useless asshole NFL'rs. AWESOME.
Thank you Sony! Best usage of money I've seen spent in 2017. You could easily fund a season or feature length anime and it would print money. I can't wait to see the new movie in October!
Excellent, they should do a full movie!
15 minutes..............I want more!!!! Superb!!!
Weyland, Yutani, Tyrell and Wallace.
Genialer Film, geniales Universum & sehr guter Tie-In. Freue mich riesig auf 2049!
LOVE THIS! WE NEED A FULL ON MOVIE.
3:30 David Bautista
How to get subtitles in English?
Damn that's great!
I read that the girl is supposed to be a prostitute. Interesting if not scary concept. Is it ethical to manufacture as a child to serve as a sex worker? Glad that they didn't do this in Westworld.
This was really good :-)
Now this is pretty cool!
Fanfkntastic !!! ....... I'd love to see THIS on the 'big screen' !!!
This is a masterpiece
What a tasty morsel!\n\nCross your fingers! My hope is that the anime master is up for The Animatrix Chronology and a story arc that spans nearly a thousand years.. that lead up to the 4th coming Matrix sequel that it draws from.
they should make this into a movie or a series
There's some nice call backs to the original film, like the noodle bar at 11:48 with the neon dragon sign where Deckard was eating at the beginning of the movie.
I expect nothing less from the director of cowboy bebop
our lord, the savior,deckard will save the world.
Good one)All praise to Denis and Co.
Beautiful!!!
capto la esencia de  Blade Runner.
Really awesome
9:06 Storm trooper accuracy.
MASTERFUL <3
Meh.
superb....keep this going!!!!
Brilliant work.
Wonderful 👏
... Bravo!...
thank you
Amazing
That was awesome!! More more more!!
meh
Epico!!!!!!!!!
Better 3d effects in a anime than the new berserker
So, why not just do the 9th Star Wars film like this?
Great drawings but I feels like too pathetic for that girl fellow. Her poor acting made me uncomfortable to watch this movie.
if the new movie is even half as good as this, we're gonna be in for something breathtaking
I don't like the song of the credits, too much pop.
that's shit. Disliked.
LOL - So Blade Runner is doing exactly the same thing that the Matrix did with the Animatrix - small vignette animation to fill in the timeline - and they end up pretty much the same plot point. Thank you for destroying my hopes for 2049 with the dated supremacist vibes.. and the jihadi nexus doesn't get blown up by the explosion?
Just beautiful. Chance is super inspiring. He inspires me to make more music with meaning
My spanish professor told me about this song
This song speaks volume. Chance the Rapper,  songs like this is why I listen to you.
WHAT WHAT WHATTTTTTT WITH DANIEL?!?!? I'm about to lose my mind
love Daniel, love Chance... this is one those two goods make it even better
Chance + Daniel Caesar + Thirdstory backup = three of my favorites and just what I needed 💘
Where it at tho?
Wow. Just fucking wow. Him choking on his emotions so he fucked some bars up worked really well in his favour. So emotional.
That part about his daughter not recognizing him without the hat like damn bro
Makes me so happy how big this genre has become
Actually crying. God is so good
Too soft for me and I'm a drizzy/wale/common fan.

Chance with the off white nike Jordan 1s
I belive the colors represent darkness(sin, depression, suffering, misery) to light(the return of the Christ, rapture). The day is on its way. It couldn't wait no more.
how this video got any dislikes is BEYOND ME!
Thank you Stephan for having him on and performing this song! He is incredible and I patiently wait every month for him to drop something new. I feel as if him, along with these other amazing artists coming out of Chicago (Mick Jenkins included) are voices for my generation. This is what we need.
Imagine if John Legend was in on this song as well. Good lawwwd
He moved me to tears! What a beautiful song with words that hit too close to home
yessss chance u have such a bootefull voice and i know what said. i love chance the rapper. :)\nthis makes me cry kinda wait is this a song?

Chance is a beautiful soal.  We are blessed to be his audiance.
If people ever ask me why I love this man, im showing them this video.
Chance the Rapper AND Daniel Caesar? Yes please

These two can't stop.
Chance makes me love chicago even more. He captures chicago perfectly. Stay true;Stay chance
He has named the Song First World Problems
This was absolutely powerful!
what a mf man
Am I the only one who knows he's talking about the day Jesus comes back like a thief in the night?
PSA: The guy who sings with Chance is Daniel Caesar, do yourself a huge favor and go listen to any of his music he is very very talented. He does Neo-soul music and its amazing.
Legend..I'll see you soon.
Chance is our generation's messenger of hope! \nPlease take few minutes to check out my new motivational song on my page! Will appreciate your feedback.
This song made me sad and almost cry
Nico in the back!

I love how he always puts Donnie Trumpet on. He's been here since day one. That's the shit I like to see.
He performed this at forest hills september 27th. it was fucking beautiful
Beautiful. Late Show: how about 1080 instead of 720?
I absolutely love it. And I thought he was going to sing/sample Unthinkable by Alecia Keys
I'm not crying you're cryin

Wow...
Reminds me of 2pacs thugz mansion acoustic version
Yes
Why that dude playing guitar look like kemba
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Fucking amazing
shivers
we don't deserve this as humans
everyone here complaining he's not acid rap chance anymore, he's changed with everything he's dropped so far, been listening since 10 day and seeing how he develops every time makes me so proud and glad he's not just stagnating like so many in this industry
damn Chance you're just too amazing
this is what americans listen to? wow. i could easily make it in america
listened to this 9 times now, and cried each time
Lord knows how I feel about this song...I'm so emotional
is that vince staples with dreads
Hugh, went str8 to hell..
dead. good. should have died along time ago. a disgrace to us men & manhood who respect women.  he was a piece of rubbish. good riddance.
Died with his dick in some underage girl. Nasty prick.
He died doing what he loved...looking at and fucking women
At least Hell has one less vacancy
I'm sorry but I cannot mourn the death of a man who spent most of his life objectifying women... he was a nasty nasty man...
Can't say his in a better place now....
Ya sex sells for whores not for decent women  who work hard and are pillar of this society so fuck him
Should you HATE Hugh Heffner? THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DEATH.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESrCFrStey4
It is real. Look up what i told you to
Its all well and good talking mostly about the ILLUSION of 'women's choices' back then but the topic to me should have been W---H---Y HEFNER 'EMPOWERED' WOMEN (if you think that) or WHY HEFNER OBJECTIFIED WOMEN (if you think that). It appears the answer is the same - HEFNER 'USED' WOMEN FOR WEALTH and 'USED' WOMEN FOR HIS OWN SELF/SEXUAL GRATIFICATION! True no one forced any of those women but If a young woman you know CHOSE to sell her body in any way, would you 'empower' her by encourageing her to go ahead or would you 'empower' her with other options? EMPOWERMENT IS NOT EMPOWERMENT WITHOUT CHOICE. You are only 'empowered' according to your options and BAD CHOICES dont quate to being 'EMPOWERED'. Understand the definitions people. Are they telling me women had NO OTHER options back then? If there were no choices back then, how were they being empowered? More like sold the idea of it! (Talk about piss on my leg then tell me its raining). If Hefner empowered women, why was HE the one who had the most power overall? HE benefitted the MOST according to his assets! I wonder how many women he DISSUADED from prostitution regardless it was thier choice? How many non sexual women's issues did he give charity or support to? How many instances did he lend his support to that did not include sexual revelations to men or women? \nA black or latino or asian man would never get kudos with the same legacy as they would be called a PIMP or in a woman's case in the same position- a MADAM! Yet another example of America's double standards and blind existence of WHITE MALE priviledge! It was called Playboy Mansion because the owner was white and a male who knocked champagne glasses with the likes of. It would have been called a brothel if it were owned by a female or brothel if the owner was non white period. I love Whoopy but on this occasion, a woman taking 'her destiny in her own hands' should benefit her. Sure they chose to be bunnies ect but they were NOT empowered. A suicide victim does not 'empower' themselves when they CHOOSE to kill themselves nor do they benefit for the sake of taking 'thier desitiny in thier own hands'. In the same vein, STOP excusing Hugh Hefner's prolonged sexual deviance as EMPOWERMENT towards women. His empire was called PLAY'BOY' - the empowerment of boys and men NOT WOMEN. STOP with the praising of this man
RIP Mr.Playboy! old man sucks by the way, i am really happy about his death, ugly skinny cunt he was i believe! RIP Mr. playboy! take care, bye bye XD Playboy sucks! I'm sitting here at home all day, playing video games.this playboy dude was a muppet innit?  You know what i'm sayin'??????????ooppsss look at that  i just farted....fucking hell...stinks really bad dude
RIP SATAN is waiting in hell for you
Rest in Peace Mr Hefner.  Thank you for all the awesome years of Playboy. You are a Legend.
He saw more titties than anyone on the planet
I'm so sad for Hef, he a great Playboy king, he gets golden.
More like hugh just left heaven.
RIP Hef the King of Playboy
And life goes on.............
Rip! A Playboy bunny tattoo now for me 😎
All these feminist in the comment section lol 😂
Huh well that sucks for the people that loved him. But since I never knew him well you went down as you lived as a playboy.
Rest In Peace Hugh he having good time with Satan or Heaven party like a legend.
He was a degenerate
All you Christian feminazis need to shut your fucking mouth and show some respect to someone that just died you immoral scum.
whats with the sad music in the background.........
rest in peace hugh hefner your playboy products and tv show will continue to live on thanks for all the wonderful things you did for us men and woman bout makeing woman all over the world look more beautiful with their skin as well as thier clothing go in peace my friend my heart goes out to the hefner family and i hope hefner  legacy will continue to live on
The excess Viagra moved beyond his penis and throughout his body causing one big stiffy.
Back in the summer2016  went highland I saw a girl  wearing playboy playmate she had big boobs and my November trip to Las Vegas I saw hot womens strip clubs and wow rest in peace Hugh Hefner
Wow, the hell wait for hugh, burn forever.
THE GUY WAS A WALKING AND TALKING CORPSE BEFORE HE EVEN DIED.....I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD SPEAK FOR ITS SELF BUT YOU PEOPLE LIKE TO DEFEND WALKING AND TALKING GHOSTS.
Christian warns Hugh Hefner before his death to repent and believe the gospel...NOW HE IS IN HELLFIRE ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=40&v=6vKw7kp-vIg
In honor of Hugh, everybody give their wife or girlfriend a nut shot in the face tonight  !
at least they no longer have to suck his old dry dick
He got all that pussy back then!!
if you die a millionaire...youre probably going to...oh hell no! where you have to eat second rate pussy! and the women have semi non semetrical breasts! an alternate universe where donald trump is fred durst and fred durst is ted nugent...and where athletics are forced upon all people..even jumping jacks....and none of the women have blonde hair! none! but thanks to technology that world is made of plastic...the sex toy industry has officially secured hell...so he probably went to italy.
his penis will be missed
Has any of his women died?
People often say that those who have dies are in a better place. This will not be said for him.
About the only thing worse than this perverted bastard is the moral-less, classless, clueless, nasty ass bunch of tramps who sold their soul right along with Hugh.. For broad is the path and wide is the gate that leads to destruction, and many will enter in..
HE is burning in HELL for his wickedness!!!!! He was a key figure in the moral decline of our society he was a filthy wretch!!!!!
He made the world worse made it disgusting
I actually hate cringey feminists but everyone knows God doesn’t want him
Straight to hell where he deserves to be :(
This man is *not* living in a better place. Where do you go from here? He hit his peak after 91 years
1926? dang I bet he kicked it with Charlie Chaplin
I just got a commercial for the movie Happy Death Day like way to go YouTube! Great timing!
People some loved him and some people hated him. That is the Hugh Hefner legacy. I'm sorry for his family loss. His name will live on.

Hugh Marston Hefner WAS NOTHING but a pimp.
Good riddance freak. Burn Hefner Burn
So many Feminists and Christanists in this comment section celebrating. \nNo wonder why your hero Hillary Lost!\n(Not a Trumpeter, I don't like him either).
Mixed feelings rest in peace
No way you can say he’s going to a better place because he was in a better place at the playboy mansion.
It's about time, women are better off without him. He will now answer to God for his continued sinful ways.
Rest easy brother ill take over from here ;)
Nobody can say he's in a better place
The world is better off without him.
Wonder if he went to hell. He was a womanizer. I went to his old high school in Chicago graduated in 2009. The principal swore he donated a million to the high school she must of spent the cash on herself because nothing was updated at the school.
*REST IN PUSSY*
Jesus he sexualize women and other women believe they had to be perfect. Because of Playboy many women got plastic surgery porn got more and more popular it was just ridiculous. He's a pervert
Pornography can lower the sense of self-esteem and self-worth of the wife because she may compare herself to the women that her husband is viewing on the screen.  She sees it as a slippery slope to addiction. It may also lead to an increase in the progression of rougher or more deviant sex. This contributes to the husband becoming more focused on his needs and not those of his wife.\n\nAll of the experts agree that a detachment of emotion during sex, and detachment from the relationship as a whole, is very dangerous to the viability of the marriage. Pornography is a poor substitute for the bonding version of sex.
His soul will not be resting. Hope he repented.
This man enjoy every day of his life!!! My condolences to relatives....
RIP, Hef. You will\nbe sorely missed.
A great man died
R.I.P Hugh \n\n\n\n\n\nHe will never be forgotten.
Any libshit on here who praises this man and condemns Trump for equivalent behavior is the biggest hypocrite on the planet. Further proof that liberals are animals.
And are we sad about this
This comment section is full of a bunch of cucks, and fat ugly bitches who get no sex. I have nothing but respect for the man he achieved his dreams despite criticism and controversy. He made a fortune and slept with beautiful young women. RIP Hugh.
Rest In Peace you lucky bastard! You will be missed!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
So heartbreaking
Finally old fart
Yuck
FUCK HIM\nBLOODY PERVERT
R.i.p
I need someone to formally educate me cause I see a lot of negative comments. Did Hugh abuse the women he worked with, or something bad? Because to say he deserves to rot in hell just because he's the founder of playboy is not reasonable at all.
Voting is almost over ya Beautiful Bastards! Then we can all go back to doing... whatever it is we all do. lolololol. AGH. I'm gonna regret this Hooking Up thing, huh?
Trump's ban was always a racially motivated bullshit piece of legislation. The inclusion of NK and Venz means absolutely nothing- do you know how many immigrants we get from them?! almost none from NK and Venz has only spiked recently (from May 2017). Yet we've had very little political confrontation with most of these countries listed and almost (?) NO terrorists from any of the countries listed. It's very simply a way to keep brown people out of white supremacist america. :|\n\nAs per Trump's NFL tweets, sure he is free to express his distaste at the protest, but the suggestion that people should be penalized or fired for also expressing their speech is ridiculous. A high school in Florida (?) tried to enact a ruling that would make it so that kneeling players would be removed from the team, but the ACLU has already shot this down. You might not like it, but it's our first amendment! Just like bra and flag burnings, it is entirely legal and cannot be legally punished. \n\nBesides which, the leagues are entirely dependent upon their players and owners; simply firing or dropping protesters would do nothing but further harm the NFL.
does our great president understand the 1st amendment? he is yet to come to senses after they made official statements saying they weren't disrespecting the flag or service members
I like how fast he talks as fast as I process information. Wow. It's like he's speaking a different language.
i know it's not the best source, but americans have been disrespecting the flag long before this happened in every day life http://social.diply.com/american-flag-disrespect?utm_medium=what-facts
45 isn't a leader. He's not a good president. He does not deserve the position, the title, nor any of the benefits of the position. He's a clown that got elected by an outdated system because the other choice was also horrible. Everything he says is meant to cause division among the people of this country. He's the very definition of undiplomatic, he has absolutely no tact, and refuses to be the loser in any situation. He's a crybaby who got everything he ever wanted by buying it with money that was never his to begin with.
It comes as a great shock to discover that the flag to which you have pledge allegiance...has not pledged allegiance to you. -James Baldwin
Weiner did what he did because he enjoyed it very much. He's addicted to sexual images and behavior that he shouldn't be doing. He LIKED what he was doing. He got EXCITED by what he was doing.... I would bet $100 that he will still be addicted to the bad behavior after his jail time.
Gaaaaaeeeeaaay
I've never heard of this weiner guy.. what a wild ride.
TYT are great!  Congratulations!  I still dig Philip DeFranco, however.
Holy crap. I feel so bad for Weiner's (ex) wife. Poor woman doesn't deserve that.
Some people are just a little country, and some are just a little bit rock n roll...
You forgot to mention how kapernick wore socks stating all cops are pigs.
Who gives a shit it's just a flag.
This comment might be long and probably won't be featured on the Friday show, but this has been dawning on my mind and needed to get it out. Hopefully y'all who do read it keep it civil and give your input.\n\nThis is my opinion when it comes to the whole flag debate. Personally I will stand for the anthem because it shows some kind of respect for the country, even though I'm not that patriotic, but I won't condemn people who kneel during the anthem because one it's their right to just like it's mine to stand. Also because from what I heard and seen it doesn't look like they're doing this to disrespect the flag, anthem or vets but more for social injustice. Do I think it got the message out? Most likely not because everyone is shouting at everyone about what's right and what's wrong and not having a civil conversation. It's just I'm right and you're wrong mentality with most of the people debating this. Could it have been done at a better time instead of during the national anthem? Probably. Because the players and the NFL are getting really bad publicity for it, but like they bad publicity is good publicity because it shined light on them, just probably not the way they wanted. But on the flip side it seems like people of color whenever they do protest peacefully it doesn't get attention or there are more complaints about why are they protesting? There's nothing to protest about so I can see why the NFL players may have protested like this. Also to add another opinion here, I don't think the national anthem should be played at sporting events. It kinda feels like forced patriotism. There are plenty of other days in the year where I can be patriotic if I feel like it. When I go to a game I'm not there to be patriotic. I'm there to watch players play the game and have fun. Though the exception to that is if the game calls on one of those patriotic day then that's fine to be patriotic. But that's my two cents.
Nothing says freedom like mandatory patriotism. It's like we're trying to be more North Korean than North Korea.
I know this is going to sound very sour but Trump defiantly has his freedom of speech as well. I think its good that people aren't just in the background of these situations. Its good to flex the responses of people when freedom of speech gets put on the line. Its kind of wiping away the dust on our reasons to support our country in any sort of way. The challenge is good, annoying, but good.
I'm fine with the protesting, i know there's a lot of crap in this country, where i live i don't see it though, but i don't support it during the national anthem. It symbolizes a lot for any American who's lost a loved one or a friend in the military. So i say yes, do your protest, but leave it to a time not on a huge part of our countries culture, it's like throwing away maple syrup in canada. it's just not right.
the young turks won? ughh they have no class, no brains and no integrity. thats the only award they should win...that of sleeze bags
I believe people should have choice. But it really upsets me and I'm not even American. All those who died before us to allow us our luxuries now it's shameful to me. I don't think people should be fired outright but I think more people should be supporting their country and those fighting or who died for it instead of disripcting it from their comfy chairs heir expensive shoes stood on the football field. Shameful
Part of what has made the United States great is the fact that people are allowed to floss their ass with the flag in protest: They're allowed to demean our symbols. I thought it a tacit statement that the principles of our nation, the culture of our nation, and the people of our nation are so strong and resolute that we cannot be offended by such actions: We'll let you have your say. And we'll judge you, not for the act of protesting, but for your reason for protesting. If you're protestations are deemed legitimate you'll be praised, if not you'll be condemned. But evidently I was wrong. No one even seems to care about what's being protested, but rather how they're protesting. If you disagree with what they're protesting -- I know I do: Police malfeasance is a national issue, not a racial one -- then criticize their reason for protesting. The anthem is just a song and the flag is just a piece of fabric; no matter how they're robbed of their beauty it can't (or at least shouldn't) affect who we are as a country.
Kneeling for the flag=ok.Staying in locker room=not ok.imo
I don't know about y'all, but sports is supposed to be something we can watch to get away from politics. I think that the players should either stand or stay in the locker room but at the same time, Trump is ORDERING people to fire players! Sounds like dictatorship to me!
Being critical of your country isn't disrespectful, seems like a lot of the south has forgotten that.
They have a right to be free of arrest for grossly disrespecting the ideals of the country.  Everyone has a right to deny their hard earned money to them and to their employers.  Boycott until fired!
If you’re upset about people protesting during the national anthem of the football, you’re unpatriotic and you don’t believe in the principles and values of America. Yes that means you too Trump.
The American flag is often portrayed as a symbol of freedom, equality, and other goals that people fight and have fought to make a reality. In that sense the flag represent the country we want to become. I don't believe the people refuse to stand because they want to disrespect those goals and hopes for the US. They are trying to make a point that who we are and what most of us will say that flag represents are two very different things, that the flag as a symbol does not yet represent this country as a whole and we have to keep fighting to work toward that ideal.
As someone who has marched with the fucking flag across Safeco Field in Seattle, as a soldier in the US Army who has served in some form since I was in fucking high school, and as as a fucking Eagle Scout  - I need to say that Kaepernick not only has the right to kneel, but he was spot-on.\nDonald Trump is using this excuse of the knee to further divide the fabric of American society. If he is successful at dividing Americans in the arena of what is probably America's greatest religion - sports - than we are one step closer to loosing this nation.\nI don't know who Trump is doing this for - whether he is trying to bring back the glory of the Confederacy and have it finally secede from the Union, or if he is a secret Nazi, or if he is a Russian puppet - but every single thing he does is one step closer to the end of this fucking country.
You say you accept the players right to kneel but you don't like it. What don't you like? Do you not like peaceful protest? Do you not believe there is in justice? I don't understand.
The Flag means so much more than what you agree or disagree with. Men and women have sacrificed their LIVES so you can have the freedom to be a football player and make millions. No matter what you're political beliefs are, or if you like or dislike the current president, the flag needs to be respected. Regardless of our right of freedom of speech, I think it is and should be one of those  unwritten rules that the flag is not disrespected. What it stands for is far greater than what people are trying to protest by disrespecting it.
Man Anthony Weiner showing he didn't have a grip on his D-Brand.
North Korea was definitely added so they could say it's not a Muslim ban. North Korean citizens can't normally travel abroad anyways. If trump knew that, I wouldn't hate him so much.
I find this whole boycott the NFL thing ridiculous. So what if someone kneels for the flag, or doesn't stand for the national anthem. THAT is what our soldiers are fighting for. They're fighting for our right to pick which one we want to do, sit or stand for the national anthem. That is one of our amendment's, freedom of speech and expression. It's more un-american to tell someone you have to do something if they don't want to do or are trying to make a statement peacefully.
Forcing people to stand for the flag is to force nationalism on people. We're supposed to protect the right to protest peacefully, we take the moral highground against those that disrespect us. Trump sounds kinda dictator-ish. No I dont think hes trying to be the next Kim family, I just think he lacks any ability to critically think.
Direct TV NFL package cancelled!!! These  millionaires in NFL do not deserve my hard earned money.  I will stick to the non BS UEFA European Championship.
Unpopular opinion: We don't need the anthem before every sporting event, unless we are facing a foreign team, then they also get their anthem. Which that doesn't happen very often. so there that solves that.
NFL players kneeling during anthem = Lazy rich NFL players pretending to care about BLM when they never take personal time to go on talk shows or rally.
why is sports becoming political ? why is everything becoming political ?
I actually agree with most of Trump's 3.0 ban. I don't think it's honestly a Muslim ban and I don't think it ever has been. We have a dumb president who doesn't want terrorists and can't do anything about it without heavily criticism
AMERICA 21st in FREEDOM!!, only 20 other countries are more free!
There's a time and place for everything. When you're at work that's not the time...
I will always stand and respect our flag and anthem, but I I respect the right of other not to. However, what many are forgetting is that the players are employees. It would be well within the rights of a business owner to fire them as they were hired to play a game, not make a political statement.
Being patriotic is a great way to become a racist. The flag is a piece of cloth. We don't need these things.\n\nBut someone who'd disrespect their own country in the way the NFL did don't sound to me like they have anyone's best interests at heart. It's those who appreciate America who can do the most good making it better. Anti-American actions like taking a knee only give support to those who want to see America toppled. Stand with America, and see it heal instead. You have to care about your country to mend it.\n\nI say this as an Englishman who can see what a fucked up place America is. But damn guys, respect the place you owe so much of you success to! If you wanna join a Black Lives Matter protest do that on your free time.
Phil, im not from the US i dont live in the US either but viewing your videos and coming across this one i wanted  ask... the entire drama with the kneeling and standing form something someone in your country believes in , is freedom and it should be respected, right? but where im lost is that if people have issue with someone expressing themselves how they want and get called names of worse why dont those same people stand against BIG companies that make money from selling clothing reflecting the US flag?...  isnt this also consider a form of disrespectful regardless on whether or not some believe is a form of carrying the love for country with in clothing? just trying to get a grip on the reality we in right now... since the entire world is watching :)
how many times has trump disrespected our country and no one calls him out on it and when they do its called fake news its sad that he is allowed to get someone fired because he wants to show how big he is? wow America i hope he demands others to get fired for his ego maybe then people will open there eyes
You can't run for office with that last name lmao
Tony Romo has 2 playoff wins and Tim Tebow has 1. Come on! You hire people to check stuff like this.
I think america's obsession with their flag is kinda weird and unsettling. But of course in my experience, nationalism only ends up being a double edged sword
I don't know, at this point the NFL should just stop the national anthem from being played during games temporarily just to simmer down the conflict,  and just get to the game.
this is ridiculous, not standing is a right. Its the same as not standing during the pledge of allegiance, whether that be in school or in a sport.
The Young Turks is not news
Multiple veterans and active duty members of our military have spoken out in defense of kneeling during the anthem, so now we see a political organization whom is ignoring the people it's claiming to defend in order to stir up it's base.
Bullsh!t, Phil. Thats a crappy right in the middle of the road opinion you got, trying not to offend anybody and be 50/50 its everybody's fault BS. \nDid anybody (anybody) asked Kaepernick when he planned to stop protesting? What was his criterias? When zero minority is oppressed in this country? Was he planning to protest the National Anthem until the end of his f*cking career? \nPhil, enough. \nA f*cking football game isnt the place to protest the flag and the National Anthem because you're not happy about something. \nYou can protest before the game, after the game, publicly, privately, online, whatever. \nBut the football fans, who are held hostages and are forced to watch you also have the right to walk away. \nAnd thats what they're doing. \nThe players didn't understand that its not the NFL that pays their huge salaries. \nIts the fans. \nIts the eyeballs in front of the screens. \nThese players didn't think this thing through.
I blame Kap for this mess!!!
SPORTS! Personally, I love them!

I live in Canada and I am in the Canadian navy and I just don’t think this would never happen here, but as an active member in the navy I would feel sad too see Canadians ever doing this but everyone one does have the right to free of speech and protest. I would have tired a different less harsh approach to the situation the trump did.
Obama was the one who divided us more then any other, it'd sad they can't see that
Saying NFL players are protesting the flag is like saying Rosa Parks was protesting public transportation.
Not in handcuffs , but out work lol..
People might be more inclined to support the players if they werent such HUGE hypocrits! For decades police turned a blind eye to crimes committed by NFL players. Crimes like sexual abuse, rape, DWI, beating their wives (OJ is a good example here) and they, the players, didnt seem to have a problem with the police then! NFL players are dispropotionately arrested on domestic abuse, rape, sexual abuse, and a plethora of other charges, than the rest of the population. Shouldnt they clean their own house before critisizing others dirty houses?They are protesting what is also a false narrative as the stats just dont support what they claim to be protesting. Instead of protesting the problem 672 steps down the line how about protesting the fact that 6% of the population commits over 50% of violent crimes? How about prostesting the black on black violence and murder rate? How about the black abortion rate? Where are all the youth centers and mentor programs their millions of dollars could build and fund? How many black youths do they work with, and i dont just mean throwing money at the problem.Sure, they have a right to protest but protesting the National Anthem/Flag because of police brutality is like protesting God and the faithful because a bunch of priests are pedophiles.Also, I have the right to protest too but if I did it at my job I would be FIRED! There is a time and a place and while you are being paid millions to play a game is not the time or place to stick your middle finger up to people paying you to PLAY! If this really means that much to them they should address the problems directly, to the people being affected, not just tar every single police officer in the country.I get why they dont do that....because only having a few cases here or there doesnt get them near the attention that doing it during a nationally televised game does.They are presenting it like every police force has every other officer only targeting black people and that is as far from the truth and as false/misleading as the Hands up, dont shoot false, made up narrative that was spun by MSM.
If you’re a PROfessional, you should act like one. Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech outside of their line of work. IF you’re getting paid millions to play a sport that’s not so difficult, you should be thankful for that opportunity the your flag is giving you. It’s funny because most people taking a knee were poor no bodies in life and now that they make millions they think they still matter.
When a citizen while occupying the highest office of the land calls other citizens Son of Bitches he is not only being disgraceful to the Presidency but to the Constitution and not worthy of a salute!
My brother is Army. Brother in law, Airforce. Husband... my entire world... Navy...\nStanding for the anthem, respecting the flag, is for those lost in the fight for freedom. Just because you CAN do something, doesnt mean you SHOULD. My husband hates what is happening. He thinks it is absolutely disgusting. He said he doesnt want your respect, but the fallen MORE than deserve it. \nKneeling is a slap in the face to those lost. And a slap in the face to the families of those lost.\nThey are multi millionaires. Their fanbases are enormous. There are soooo many different ways they could make their point known, without disrespecting the fallen.\nMy husband isnt an NFL fan, but i WAS. i refuse to give them anymore of my time or money, because they arent deserving of it.\nThese celebrities forget that the only value they hold to the vast majority of people ends the second they no longer entertain us. Or rather, the second them entertaining us comes at too great of a cost, or too big of an inconvenience.\nTrump likes to take things way too far, every chance he gets. This situation is no exception. I can say though that i agree with the call for a boycott.\nJust as they have the right to be disrespectful little shits to the men and woman who died for that right... we have the right to stand against their disgusting disrespect, and take away the one thing that matters most to them, their money.\nIf you continue to watch nfl, that is your decision and your right. But i certainly wont be. And neither will MANY of my friends.
Real men stand up for what they believe in; they don't kneel 🇺🇸
Instead of giving the NFL another dime, do what I did and Support a disabled veteran business by getting an awesome NFL =no Fans Left shirt at https://boycott-the-swamp.myshopify.com Hope the ENTIRE COUNTRY gets one and wears it!
NFL sucks now, love politics but just want to watch football............stopped watching my niners last year for one Kapernick's crap and come on people he REALLY REALLY sucks!!
NFL is a workplace.  Legally you can say whatever or protest, but you can get fired too.  Seems to me owners are being weak on this issue because of the nature of the business.  Stategically may not be able to fire players because another team could pick them up.  These pro athletes live in a bubble.  What a surprise it started in California.  Should give them same status as Puerto Rico.
earth is flat
White House > NFL + NBA
Stop commenting.
Just gotta say lebron james- SHOTS FUCKIN FIRED xD that burn was beautiful
Boycott NFL
Team Protest :)
Mickey mantle doesn't pay my rent
affect our AGENDA yeah exactly fucker !
What disease does weener have?
Yay NASCAR
I'm disliking DeFranco's videos more and more. How much can a whiny liberal gush and bleed over nothing?
There is no confusion. Everyone knows why theyre doing. Either for the mistreatment of black people by police or to say FU Trump. We all know. The problem is youre using our National anthem that has nothing to do with police or Trump to protest. It pisses us off. It is disrespectful. Your intent doesn't matter. You dont use our flag and you dont use our National anthem. They stand for our great country that gave you the chance to be the privileged men you are. The anthem is to remember the men and women who have died for this country, for you! Its to respect the men and women that are in the military right now. They have their right to protest however they want it doesnt mean theyre not aholes for doing it.
The problem here is trump. There are bigger problems in the u.s. He should worry about those problems. They're expressing in a nonviolent way. Good for them. It blows my mind the way the leader, the president, expresses himself. He does not act like a professional.
Blind nationalism and blind following of political party are the sole reasons Trump is in office.
About the NFL, don't be mad, they were kneeling to pray to Jesus that they would win the game. And they were kneeling so they could worship the flag.
On the whole standing for the national anthem thing, I feel like Trump is really driving a hyper-nationalist narrative.  You respect the flag or you're fired.  It is divisive, and I think Phil hit on a great point, the kneeling was in protest of social issues originally (specifically around policing).  I'm of the same mindset as a certain German scientist who once said, Nationalism is an infantile disease, it's the measles of humanity.  It seems the president is using his Nationalist rhetoric to create in-groups and out-groups, those who agree with or support the players, and those who do not.  Sad.
To be honest, I don't agree with kneeling during he anthem. I was raised the way that when the anthem comes on, I stand and put my hand over my heart (yes even in my house). However, I do believe police brutality is an incredible problem and should be protested. Do it like the Cowboys did it. Kneel before the anthem. But during show some respect.
In regards to standing for the national anthem or not, I think the most important part of this argument is being glossed over. What's important is to ask yourself will this action bring the results I want? If you're going to put your million dollar career on the line and risk offending millions of people, including those who cheer for you and pay your bills, at least make sure your results will be worth the risk!\nDid refusing to stand end racism? Did it call attention to the issue in a way that didn't ruin your career (like Beyonce's half time performance for example)?  Did it make African Americans look good? Did it soften people's hears toward African Americans? Did it stop police killing African American kids? That's what really matters. So should you really continue doing this? They say the definition of insanity is doing the SAME thing over and over, expecting DIFFERENT results...
You forgot to mention that Colin Kapernick wore socks that depicted police officers as pigs on the field and the NFL had no problem with that..  If he has a problem with the police as he used to say, instead of the flag, why not turn your backs on all police officers that are all around the field and stadium as security to protect the players and keep the peace??? Hmmm
I don't stand for the pledge or the flag. I hate Trump thats one reason. Two, I respect soldiers that have died, and I show my respect in many different way. I just refuse to stand for the pledge because I'm an atheist and I dislike the under God part.
What boycott?  Week 3 was 3% UP over 2016.  The alt-right, sycophantic Trump drones are either lying about boycotting or lying about being fans in the first place.
With all the shit going on right now we are wasting the power of the government arguing about glorified games a flag is only as meaningful as the people willing to die for it but those people gave there lifes to allow you the right to shit on it part of freedom of speech is that everyone has it  i disapprove of what you say, but i will defend to the death your right to say it there is more important things then worring what a bunch of over payed athletes are doing when we fix all the other horse shit thats happening then we can focus on this problem if we haft to
I think the NFL situation is ludicrous. The same people who spout how everything that is negative about Trump is fake news but they pass around the fake NFL rule talking about how players /should/ stand at attention when the anthem is played when this is not even mentioned at all. Let alone the page that the rule is apparently on even existing. I think people should calm the hell down and maybe get angry at the cause of them kneeling and not them kneeling during the anthem.
I'm with NFL. It's a beautiful protests for a good cause and Trump should just stop making shit big. These players are acknowledging that there are these flaws in America and until they are fixed, they do not want to proudly stand to the anthem and I get it. Especially for the minority background or race players, this is important. If I came to America, I would be a minority. If there were enough lithuanians to be mistreated and heard about, I would dp the same
You all realize that he dose this every time that there are more important this happening in the world. I understand that the protest by the players is important, but it has been going on for so long that it is back burner news. Trump used this to cover up his failure to get aid to those in Puerto Rico properly and on time as well it's a bigger distraction from him trying to start war with North Korea. There is a bigger picture here. Why are you falling for his shit Phil. Don't be part of the masses! Please! It's one of the things I love about u and ur show
You guys over on that side of the pond need to chill, no need to be triggered when someone doesn't stand for the anthem/flag xD
As stated in our declaration of independence, whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.  Regardless of what the protesting is about these people are kneeling because there is a problem and they want to make change which is their god given right as American citizens. The first step to solving a problem is admitting that there is one which is exactly what these role models of society are doing while they exercise their first amendement rights.
Trump is condeming people for expressing their freedom of speech peacefully and rexpectfully, when it takes two days for him to make a small comment on teh KKK saying extremely racist and terrible things, and immediately goes on a rant about people peacefully protesting about social injustice, this reveals him as truly unamerican at heart.
I dont get how people are saying “ Those players are at work. They shouldn’t do/ say anything that could cause division just bc they have a certain view and they should have consequences for doing so.“ and are siding with Trump, yet Trump is at all times the president or “on the job”, but he can say incredible bullshit that could easily cause division, yet he goes unpunished ? How hypocritical is that ? Do not pick and choose certain principles to apply just because they line up with your OWN. On another note every player has their own reason to kneel, how are you to assume they are doing so to show blatant disrespect for our fallen women/men. I highly doubt any of them are kneeling for that reason.
The most problematic thing I find with the NFL/Trump thing is that he's calling to fire these athletes when they are expressing freedom of speech/expression. The President is going against freedom of expression by wanting to remove these players from their platform and that's very troublesome.
im curious, if someone gets fired because they kneeled, would that be considered wrongful termination?
I wasn't impressed till the daughter sang Lol
Awwwww she is to cute 😍😍😍😍
His hair on point
Can I get a studio version of him singing this? His voice is anazing
I keep whatching this video again and again since its uploaded. 😍😍
Wait, this is the dude who sings with his daughter on facebook
Adam's face when Blake turned around is priceless XD
This guy has a similar style to the girl on americas got talent whose dad has cancer think her name was evie claire..both great voices a duet would be so cool!
SO GOOD.----█▬█ █ ▀█▀ my CHANNEL BRO & SUB ME for a better life ★★
the only reason i watch this cause i want to see claire!! lol 😍😍😍
Im so happy!!!! Pls dont screw this up adam
Dave Crosby is why I hate when other people bring their guitars on stage.  He sang this song acoustically and actually played his guitar which is what I love.  I hate when people bring their guitars and are playing it but it does absolutely nothing because you can't hear the guitar or its just near useless.   These people just want to hold a guitar and appear as a musician.
I thought him and Miley would've been a perfect choice
This is such a beautiful song; I'm not sure Dave completely did it proud but he's got a pretty decent voice. He has one of those voices that I feel like might sound better on a recording than it does live.
does anyone know what's the bgm when Dave picked Adam? tks
Im kinda demanding a full cover from him now without the shouting and clapping xD
I repeated over and over again and still melting with her voice
I really want him to win the show❤️❤️
I felt like his voice is more soulful then the original...
'Y'all tricked me' Stfu up. Don't you have an own brain and an own opinion? If you like the music and you think you can win with him in your team, why don't you fucking press the button then?
Jenifer is acting so crazy
https://youtu.be/mEsMxMlQwFA
Aww, his little girl melted my heart!! So cute
From a fellow WASHINGTONIAN Tacoma born and raised and still reside and a Claire Fan, kudos to you dad! Super Super Proud of you! Go get em'
I'm rooting on you, man! 👏
who else replaying the video when his daughter singing. that's best part!!!
This was pure and beautiful. Thank you.
He is my favourite so far
Dave Crosby is the best singer ever and he’s gorgeous. He is obviously a great dad and husband too if you watch his daughter’s channel. They are awesome!!!
why do the audience always feel the need to clap in rhythm ....
Another potential winner by the voters..
Sing baby😂
I just was thinking a few weeks ago they should go on this or Americas got tallent I'm so happy and Dave and Clair need to go on Americas got tallent
What a voice. Precious daughter. Beautiful family. Love how the Voice celebrates real people and their dreams. Hat's off to management.
Dave Crosby: I Will Follow You into the Dark
I AM IN TEARS
Now he should sing a David Crosby's song to close the circle :)
Hey I hate to be that guy but his dang singing made me cry because this song makes me think of exr\nAlso from his amazing voice\nBut primarily exr
that little angel is a future artist way to go.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Why??? Why is Miley there? She is so bad!
What is the name of the song at 6:27?
Whats The Song Called @ 6:28
*LOVE YOU Claire and the Crosbys*
Claire is delightful but Dave....what a wonderful voice and such honestly.  It was beautiful!  Go, go, go!
Check out me and my bro.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9YDQyKzEPA
dave's voice is good❤️
I watched this in music class
How cute they are i mean the dad and daughter isn't adorable together ?
Amazing, as always!!!! Love that Dave's on The Voice- his talent is what drives Claire.
Who is him? I dont know ? Someone plz tell me?
am i the only les mis fan who's crying over the memory of george blagden singing this
Omg YES i am so excited he picked Adam WOW YES
Adam's reaction at 1:30. Hahahaha lmfao
Ellen brings me here
Their daughter looks like Lara Wurtzbach Manze
Who's here from Claire and the Crosbys? 😂

Every time I see this family on video singing or just being who they are in their vlogs, I tear up. They are such a really sweet family. Ever since I saw the video of them singing see the light from the Tangled movie, I fell in love with them. Dad has an AMAZING voice and Clair does as well. And what a little cutie. Love this family'
Ahhhh....  yesssss...  I'm crying happy tears for Dave.  I've been following their channel since I first saw Claire sing the song from the Little Mermaid.  Their family always brightens my day!  Congrats Dave!  <3
The winner.. I hope!! :D
You take good care of the Crosbys!
I always love J Hudson’s reactions.
that song and this is cute and she is good
What I always say is If u lose The Voice, then u can try for X Factor and Agt, Bgt and etc.
Why are successful vocalists always attractive? Can unattractive vocalists have a long, lasting career in the music business?
If he gets to live playoffs where America votes then he automatically wins.  He is already so popular and has won the hearts of millions.  All Adam has to do if he wants to win this is not mess up and not make the wrong choice (like he has so many times in the past...).
Yes! Go Claire and the Crosbys . Awesome. Congrat. Hello from Washington State
What a boring and cheesy song.
Why is Miley still judge? Is she mentally stable now?
so is this guy gonna win the voice cause of his daughter?
Dave, is going on the voice going to interfere with you going to the planet Kolob, where god lives????
Finally !!!!!! good luck dave !!!  :DDDDDDDD
More power to him, but while he was ok, his voice doesn't compare with most of the other contestants. I doubt he will make it past the battle round unless paired with a particularly weak singer, or unless the song choice is one that is especially suited to him. Comments like Raphael Wong's are the key to his success: who else replaying the video when his daughter singing. that's best part!!!
sounds like nevershoutnever
So adorable!!! Hope he wins.
The Crosbys!!!!
The rasp <3
Death Cab for Cuties!
“I’m obsesssed with herrr” same Miley same lol
hooooooooooooooooooooooooray. Good job Dave <3
Claire's reaction. OMGGG
Overrated
Claire watching the voice  she said one day I'm gonna be there now Dave was on the stage!I'm so excite for him
Good Luck Dave . I am sure you will succeed in everything you do . Well done #Dave .
I cried
Countinho
wow dave congratssss my idol and ur cutiiieeee pie baby
So awesome
Omggg GO DADDEH
Yeayyy, team Adam!! :) ;)
I LOVE THERE CHANEL
I’m cryin
Love you claire 😍😍😍
God bless the Crosbys!! Beautiful family!! 😍😍😍
I was thinking of 'Hey hey, it's Ty Ty' then I realized this is a different show. And that little girl is amazing! God bless this family! 😘
The Voice would’t be the same without Adam and Blake

Wil found your channel by accident.  Sending you prayers, light and strength. God bless you and your family. Keep up your incredible energy and positivity!!!!!
The extra boost of energy might be from the dexamethasone which is a steroid. \n\nLove your videos!
DUN!!
Hi wil im 12 i watch you from phx az \nYou got 906k subs!!!!
Its a blessing :)
konting bike na lang #1M kana tsong wil! #Wilodia
I'm so impressed that you'll keep your hands off the bike! Bike skills on fleek.
I love those words of wisdom about making the most of your energy when you still have it. Such source of positivity.
fight will, fight!  love your attitude. it's hard to be as peppy as you have been when you have cancer, but that's why i really love the way you've been dealing with this. attitude definitely helps. rest when you have to, but keep going at it will. fight!
They add steroids that wear off after a day.  I am in round 6.  Bit of drama.  The steroids are there to help you get through the first few days.   Not sure of all the exercise. You may want to check with the docs on alot of exercise.  The chemo eats protein.  Guess you will find that out.  I have managed to maintain my weight for 12 weeks.  Your immune system is dropping so watch any injury or infections.
im gonna use the thumbnail as a meme for future purposes sjsksjsj
You are so inspiring and so positive! My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer (gleoblastoma) He had surgery in February, but sadly his tumor came back in the same spot a few months later (another surgery is not possible) Radiation, Chemo, and immunotherapy and his tumor has been shrinking! :) We have all been staying positive for my dad and getting him out of the house, and I think that has been helping so much. Praying for you and a fast recovery.
Energetic, happiness can kill your cancer Wil ;D
Wil, I hope you are healed soon!!!  I was thinking of you because of your senior porject :Marianne McGarry Wolf, Wil Dasovich, Mitch Wolf and Lindsey Higgins, When Choosing a Wine Label, Women are from Hollywood and Men are from Boston,   Selected paper prepared for the 2013 AAWE conference in Stellenbosch, South Africa. http://www.embassyconferences.co.za/media/Presentation%20Gender%20and%20Wine%20Labels.pdf\n\nI also have been into YouTube! Here is a viral video I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRdSWtUdawU Marianne
Make sure you're not gonna sweat a lot. Make your dressing dry and intact all the time to prevent infection. God bless you and you family!
Been following your battle.\nWas diagnosed last night with kidney cancer.\nHad no symptoms. Caught because I had a growth in my nostril which was thought to be inflamed scar tissue from a previous septi plast.\nSince the granulima was negative before surgery to remove it.They dbl checked ,Thank God.\nCat scan revealed whole body clear except a baseball sized tumor in my left kidney.\nRadical nephrectomy and chemo to follow.\nKeep posting your journey.\nGlad your Dad is a survivor.\nI pray you will be as well.\nGoid luck.\nPeace and health to you.
You mean chemo ADVERSE effects not working!! That title scared the shit out of me
hey! you're almost at 1M! Congrats! #oakland
For Wil the most Anti Cancer foods in the world are Garlic, Broccoli sprouts and Black beans
The whole population of Puerto Rico is living without electricity right now. Wil has cancer but can still make money from his views.

Hey Wil, \nDavid here from The World n Us.  I'm a long time viewer, first time commenter.  We've just got back from camping for a few weeks to see what you've been going through.  Just wanted to send you some love from me and the whole family.  You are one person who has inspired me to start a channel and vlogging our family's travel experiences.  We just can't believe this is happening to you and want nothing more than for you to get through this.  Stay strong.  Take care of your body.  Get plenty of sleep.  We're here with you all the way!
You are such a sweet son Wil. I love how you and your Dad are super close. And the way your Mom looked at you in the end, that was pure love. Stay strong Wil! A lot of people love you 🙂
Hi Wil,apparently you seem strong and composed on the outside,but given the situation you have many questions and apprehensions/doubts about life here and beyond.If you only turn to JESUS,HE IS our Healer and HE loves you and HE gave HIS own life to prove/show this, to remove the curse(which includes sickness) .JESUS is as close to you as your own breath in your lungs,if you ask HIM in prayer to heal you I GUARANTEE you HE wil .Because there is no record in the Holy Bible of JESUS turning down anybody who asked HIM for healing, and HE IS the same today,yesterday and forever(Hebrews 13:8).Ever a Loving,Merciful GOD/Healer.GOD BLESS Tremendously in JESUS name Amen!
Alodia in the end of the vid 😍

Fingers crossed Nancy gets over her Steve phase this season!
oh and those goofy  monsters in the mix
Stop trying to put Steve against Jonathan and just ship them all together, life is easier that way.
Her and Jonathan for sure nothing against Steve tho
Dang kinda actually looks like a love story if you didnt watch the show and realize that its about a bunch of kids trying to look for a missing child who was abducted by aliens and still taking more kids
This video just makes me miss Barb.
THE HYPE IS REAL
THIS IS LIKE A FANFICTION TRAILER IMLAUGKING
This sounds like the introduction to a crappy fanfic
Do Pretty in Pink

Nancy and johnathan is like veronica and jd but better
When does this come out?
netflix don't need ship videos from fans, they make their own
I wouldn't mind if the whole show had this film grain effect
I'm glad she stayed with Steve

Starting to think the entire season should’ve looked like this.
i just notice that's the same bitch who got raped in the mist!
I know I can't be the only Stancy fan here...
This is 2% of what Stranger Things is about LOL
Can't wait for Netflix's new romantic comedy Love in the upside-down

So is Jancy happening or what..... PLEASE

Honestly - Bless you for making this. Can't wait to see their relationship blossom in season two!
They should do the entire second season with these VHS effects
When does season 2 come out?
imagine thinking this is true. Jancy 4 life.
Okay this video is great but wtf is the thumbnail? 😂😂
i just hope they don't make nancy and jonathan a thing. 😕\ni was so glad this show didn't follow that girl-dates-a-popular-guy-but-suddenly-she-fallsinlove-with-that-weird-guy overused plot.
???????? What the hell is this shit??????
I am so weak for this <3 Netflix ships it!!
Why did this make me cry
Team Jonathan and steve get together
OMG !!!! Yes, please !!! Jonathan and Nancy are perfect together !!! Netflix itself ships it !!! There is STILL HOPE !!!! Please get together this season !!!
Damn excited for Season 2 ... can’t it come quickly.??!!! Plzz share a new trailer!!
Since this footage was shot on red, I think the footage was ran through a vhs cassette to make it look more 80s and 90s style with the music.
DUDE IM SO HYPE FOR THIS! YAY WOOOEEEHHH!! I HAVE WAITED FOR 5 MONTHHHHSS! When is it coming out?!
This is not stranger things.. is this trailer a joke about the show? Wtf

Wanna try that pig's skin pasta
That chef was such a nice guy
I admire the chef. Everything looked so delicious, fine presentation, huge portions and he was so nice!
This looks like the finest meal ever served!
I wanna go omg looks heavenly
is it a french chef? he have french accent.
Ewww... Just ewww... Fat? Can you stoop any low Mr?
I've practically shared every single videos Mike did in Singapore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They all look so YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And i'm currently living in Singapore!!! PLEASE COME AGAIN SOON! YOU ARE A FOOD ANGEL!!!
2:58 do you have 3 arms?
Awesome video man - it was fun to watch. Thank you for sharing.
And here i am , staring at my empty fridge
BTW there is a woman asking for some behind you my man....
the chef was wondering how could this dude eat so much
I will commit suicide today please pray god for me.
Just added this restaurant to my must visit places in Singapore. That tripe looked divine!
When were you in Poland? Are there any vids from that trip?
Nice timing 11:11 when you ended the video
Great way to eat animals.. nothing wasted!!
I'm going to have to place a try when I go next year.
My favorite video by far!!!
DOES NO ONE NOTICE THAT THING BEHIND MIKE THIS SHOULD BE DEMONITISED
And then I realised I had some pizza left in my fridge. I feel so cheap xD
I can't eat thin stuff with a fork. I can only do it with chopsticks
Spanish restaurant, really ? Ok but with a lot of french cuisine influence.
Your video's are always the best mike❤❤
I think you should collab with First We Feast. Eat spicy chicken wings.
Love beets ever since does mike know that the Beet is a vegetable?
Is the pig skin pasta not on the menu?
Damn it Mike. Lol, you expression just says it all.
Man that chick in the painting is kicking em out wide
Wow. Quality and Presentation written all over this restaurant.
I would have been the on customer to lick the plates
I think I lost weight from my mouth watering for 11 minutes... Hmmm
do you have to pay these restaurants any money to film inside?
This was really difficult to watch because of the painting behind you, the chef's accent,  and the house music that was playing in the background.  And for me, personally, the combinations of flavors and ingredients did not really look that appetizing.
A little too primal for me... but I would be lying if I said my mouth wasn't watering the entire time.
so who was holding the second fork ???
How can he eat so much without getting full!
I have been to Dehesa. It is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Every dish the chef serves is a flavour bomb.
I'm just gona come right out and say it, Mr. Chen, you are really a great critic, in the sence that you cut the hypocritical BS upper class swines love to impregnate humble and high end kitchens alike. \n\nWe commend you, aqui do Brasil.
Good marketing when a restaurant reached out to a food channel.  Costs a miniscule amount in product to reach out to over 100k-400k people.
I live in Singapore
Glad you liked Singapore I am from Singapore BTW
Sad to say this looks terribly pretentious and is presented with alot of intentional smokescreens. When he brought the ice-cream with no sugar then proceed to stab it with caramel..and kept saying, no sugar, that really took the cake with that kind of comment.
Oh, using all the cuts of pork. I thought it's about actually eating the whole pig.
Look out, you are getting fat
Loved how the chef explained each and every dish in detail. Thanks for uploading. 😊
i love your background music choices haha.
Wow. I love that food 😍
2:57 He has three arms?
I enjoy your videos as they are interesting, informative, and I get to travel with you to so many places.  All I can say about this meal is Better You Than Me, LOL, because I wouldn't have been willing to try any of it, except for maybe the dessert.  But I'm so happy that it was an amazing meal for you!  : D
the picture behind you at 2:10 ...why!!!!!!!!!!! lol
I NEED to be there!
My eyes 👀 went directly to the painting 😱
Come to newfoundland, we have the best seafood in the world. From cod fish to lobster.
What is the name of that instrumental you're using???
You make my food taste crap while watching this video. Thank you
i love mike so much but the auto focus drives me insane!
From the rooter to the tooter. Well done!
This looks incredible! That beef cheek, and the pigs head dish omg...drooling lol
I love how he puts everything On the bread, the cheeks the fat the bone marrow and walnut. I love eating like that. All in one big bite.
An Chinese guy at a restaurant in Singapore ran by a French chef listening to American Rock and Roll
Love the painting in the back ground lol
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
I love how happy food makes you
The food looks good
Who was the second fork XD?
that chef is AMAZING
Aww! You didn't show the hot pepper reaction!
Great food!! Can you do some tofu dishes in your future videos?
the dessert presentation was beautiful. the food overall looked amazing
Is this meal ok to eat if you are vegan?
4:44 am i the only one who kept noticing the background
Nice girlfriend in the background
Cats?? Do you have any cats??
i was amazed at what that chef can do his a food genius
The chef is french ?
TURN DOWN FOR WHAT
I sweat to god i am going there one day! I NEED THAT FOOD IN MY LIFE!!
I always wanted to go singapore, i will have to plan a visit there very soon.  What an amazing food
Hey Mike.... Turn down for what? Lol
Mike, try South African cuisine!!
This was a delicious video as always but they were just using the nose to tail concept as opposed to actually featuring it.
😋😋😋😋😍
yucks!
Does mikey use gimbal?? 🤔🤔
another great vid
britney spears is mentally ill
🐷💕
lemi guess.. $300?
Wow! All the food looks delicious! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love bone marrow
That looked soooooo awesome.
Absolutely incredible video!
Dying to try that spicy sauce!
2:56 Mike has 3 hands ????
Absolutely sadistic
When you try omad but dumpling uploads...
Food i love food
Alright EA, I'm giving you one more chance.
It's about fucking time they turned it back to the bf style play and old battlefront. Fuckers were supposed to do it with the first one.
Next let's do Star Trek Battleside
This game will be dead in half a year at max, just like the previous successor\n\n*I know you know it*
So I have heard a lot about this game and looking forward to buying it. Never played a a Star Wats game in my life so should I get the first game in the meantime? Are there any bonuses or extras you can get from playing it and than this?
Nice to see their moving in the right direction but all I want to see is good old fashioned galactic conquest or ground to space battles, we have the technology to make that happen. Otherwise looking forward to this.
Who can't stop watching the trailer?
No. THIS is Battlefront II https://youtu.be/S7-fbAX5srY
Anyone else in the Pre 100k view squad?
After seeing that breath taking video. I almost cried. So cool I can’t wait to get that game
add in the blind dude
literally how do you not make battlefront II 2005  better with the technology now. I do not trust this game, It's gonna have everything the other game missed, but its probably going to be lesser version of what we actually want.
I wish you could put your own design on your armor, like how in black ops 3 you can put stickers on your gun
Mmmmm I really want too buy it now!
I wonder why John Boyega had an American accent in the movie........and well every movie he does lol....
All I want is galactic conquest
That is one of the more photo realistic game i've seen.
I sure hope that the tl-50 doesn't have secondary fire like the last battlefront. In my opinion that was be far the most annoying thing in the last battlefront
come on, don't lie to me. where's my buddy grievous?
Triple the amount still not saying much that's literally like the content of a normal game lol
Sorry EA but nothing can beat turning on your PS2 after school to hear that noise, seeing the gold disc and then the     old battlefront music and loading screens. You can try all you want but you'll never be that, and the children of today can never experience that.
Guys check out thr news. The old batlefront 2 (2005) is bringing back online multiplayer!!
Bravo EA you've really outdone yourself this time bravo this looks absolutely amazing but one small problem are the heroes gonna only be used when it's in their timeline same with troops I kinda found it lore breaking in the first game but this looks absolutely amazing bravo
Watch every discussed aspect of this video require a $15 dlc 😒
I actually had an orgasm
I cannot stop seeing this trailer
Why can't EA never use in-app purchases in their games, don't they already have enough money?
Epic 20 vs 20? Thats not epic at all, thats pretty lame actually.
Need a game just like Jedi Knight II again..
now made to run on the new GTX 4090 TI
I was about to ask about clones
I want to trust them but I can't but I want to but i can't but I want to but i can't but i want to but i cant
It looks beautiful but is it a good game? I wouldn't get my hopes up
THE HYPE IS REAL. Almost as much hype as Battlefield 1 had.
I aint buying it\nEa Battlefront sucked so hard \nDamn  you EA \nI aint trusting you this time
Please have Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker in this game we need him
looks promising but really, did you guys HAVE to add those stupid cards back?\n\nalso why is it just a campaign based on the villains. like shit ea, this is a bit of a improvement but seriously i think we would all just like a remake of the OG battlefront. still this looks like itll be better.
Single player. For when you're playing with idiots. Yay!
Honestly the first one looks better I don't like this car system and it better have both and endor and better still have hansolo and earth Vader luke like all OG characters and fuck the robots there so shit
It's a good thing that the DLC is going to be free.
Why does it say *Star Wars * game in the description? Is this game's campaign not canon?
When does the game fully release?
Can I use your star wars battlefront 2 trailer? please
What? Is it possible that this will actually be a full game when it releases unlike the last one?
Is that hero all the way on the left Leia? It looks like her but I can't tell since it moves so fast and pausing makes it blurry.
Can't wait to bust my nutt to this game UHHH
If you compare it to the previous game, no one is finna b impressed. Also, this should be a free expansion if this is what the previous one should have been. #stoptheBS
All I have to say is bring back offline galactic conquest!!!! That game mode was the bees knees
They should add a jango fett skin for boba fett on kamino
10 year old version of me would be so excited for this
Can't wait to get this
1:45 unknown regions looks so much better
I’m only gonna buy this game because John is such a great narrator.
Check out the first Darth Maul Montage from me on youtube ! \nIm a new channel on youtube you will see more content when the game come out i how yout enjoy and follow the BF2 Hype !! \n- peace STunoX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6nxPQ2saQY
I think EA owes me a free copy of this when it comes out because I bought Battlefront 1 when it first came out, and man, what a poorly put together game that was! Like 4 maps and 6 heroes? No clones and battle droids? No galactic conquest? I feel almost as gypped as when I bought No Man's Sky! This game, however, looks like they are trying to make up for the sin of the first one. Please make it lower priced as a sorry to the fans.
More weapons, and increased maximum match size to 32, a good progressional system.. and maybe weapon customization, like bf4.. then i would think about wasting my time and mula on this. Exploiting star wars to profit off less work is lame, yet all companies are pulling **** like this nowadays.
Theres no false advertising in this trailer im serious
Why didn't I see the good Only-Heroes-Against-Villain-Mode like in the old Battlefront II on Mos Eisley?
idk if this is going to be the case but its going to be weird seeing Maul fighting storm troopers or Rey fighting battle droids.
Don't fuck it up.
If we don’t get to play as obi wan, then we will riot
This is what we all have to do with EA now: preorder the game for $5 so u'll get all the bonuses if you do end up buying it. DO NOT pick it up on day one! Wait one day for the reviews to come out so u'll know whether or not they actually did a good job before you go fully paying for it. \n\nEA has a habit of not patching or fixing their products. What you get at launch will most likely be what youre stuck with so make sure its good first.
Sounds like what the game they released two years ago should have been!!
where the fuck is obi wan
Can we play the Splittscreen in Online?
Why are so many games using a card system because it's only games using it I'm not the biggest fan of card systems but it does make it interesting from time to time so I so can't wait
*Coming to Computers with 8 GTX 1080tis*
In the part that says i can play offline, i can play offline as a clone trooper?
I really can't wait to play as the completely inept bad guy Kylo Ren
PLEASE STAY TRUE TO FREE DLC AND NO MORE SEASON PASS
storm troopers count hit a fat guy 2 inches away from them
I can't wait!
We fucked up last time
Holy crap. I may have to open my piggy bank.
wait *this game might actually be really good*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*PRE-ORDERED*
Galactic Conquest is back? Free DLC? \n#GoodGuyEA

Epic 20 vs. 20 - umm... ok.
I preordered the game a few days ago and haven’t gotten a code or anything to get the beta early so will it just automatically download on the 4th or did I do something wrong? Plz help
Iconic Star Wars heroes from Darth Maul,to Boba Fett,TO REY XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD YOU FUCKIN SRS?
You spin me right, right round, Enzo right round
the entire Cruiserweights division  is just jealous
2:48 WHAT IS THAT EDITING
Davirari Made Me Laugh at The End
They made a pure Enzo Amore, I feel bad for him... 😮😞😖😖😖
Rip enjo
man why they hate enzo amore
Enzo just got cruiser raped
🎶Everybody hateees enzoo!🎶
205 live 14 vs 1 handicapped match
Enzo Amore does not deserve to be a champion.... R.I.P. Enzo\nLOL..
All Cruiserweight player without enzo are not male they are female
Jack Gallagher looks like he is on the verge of turning heel
0:45 - did... did his rib cage just cave in?
Stop he's already dead.
if I was enzo I will fight back just be friends with enzo fine if you guys don't lisen to me when I'm big I'm gonna kick all of and put your teeth down your throts you guys are mean people because you don't respect enzo amore
Enzo: hey stop it, stop it, that's enough after being spun for about a minute 😂 this is such an brilliant put down on him hopefully he's heel going forward
Braun strowman in Brock lesnar vs all of them that will be cool to watch on TV on raw
Wtf ....I m a big fan of wwe but after that I doesn't watch wwe...dislike
They are beating the champ because they are jealous
Wish that aired this on TV.
As god as my witness......he's gotta be dead!!!
What a disrespect to enzo they are worth nothing
Enzo just got raped by 12 people and the fans liked it
enzo is one hell of a seller holy sh-
Oh so when Shane attacks an employee he gets yelled  at  but when the 205 live division attacks amore nothing happens wow creative
Is this even canon?
Enzo is a trooper! Guy deserves a back rub.
3:07 I think he dead
I can't figure out if the whole cruiserweight have turned heel or Enzo has turned heel
Stop stop stop. I'm so dizzy, I can't see nothing
Am I the only one that noticed that Braun ripped his shirt off for the first time
Strowman might as well turn face, at this point.
Issa Certified Plane...Bada Boom Flying helicopters in the room. How you doin?
I love the way Braun just grabs them like their toys. He's so manly. Why can't more guys be like this?
You just make a list!!!
It just turned from bad to worse for Enzo
I hope they have a PPV match. And Enzo kicks him in the balls and Braun just shakes his head, and powerslams him to win. That would be funny.
he is nothing without big case...... no certified G
Braun is awesome👍 Enzo got his butt kicked and you can teach that👊
What the name of music in the end
Braun is the senior😅😅
Can anyone else hear enzo saying stop it at 2:26
The way Cedric Alexander slammed enzo I thought he broke his neck
This has no commentators, so am i right in thinking this was just for the crowd and not on Raw itself?
I like how the ring sounds
This is what happens when you bad mouth Cena Enzo.... Golden Shovel.
Hey dude if i give you the money can you go pick up the new Fallout game for me?\n\n\nYeah sure\n\nSorry dude i used the money to get drunk with my friends and i trashed you're car 3:08
Man  that  got  to  be  criminal offense
Make the cruiserweights a dominant faction with Braun Strowman and Neville as their leader
stop. stop! he's already dead.
I hate that Enzo is champion! He deserved that beating! Best 205 Live segment ever!
All u want to Kill him...
Enzo deserved it ...... but that was too much!
Les not act like they didn't use v trigger and young bucks super kick
Braun and Zo are friends in real life tho.
Look at the face of enzo on 3:08
Who are the heels and faces here
This was a terrible segment and I'm not even a Enzo fan. Why put the belt on him just to look weak ?
big cass must be laughing his A off from that hospital bed
This is a serious topic please read-:\nWWE you are getting worst day by day in earning.Now WWE really have only maximum 3to 4 thousand peoples to buy tickets and watch live and half of arena is empty!I know that.\nYou should really have to make fast changes to bring WWE back on line-:\n1. End the PG \n2. End the New era\n3. End the brand split because its not working!\nMake these changes to save WWE!!
Roses are Red \nViolets are Blue\nNew NEXUS.,\nWhat a DEBUT!
Gulak might have stolen the show on this one.
1:44

what name of end song from 4:21?
Hey guys, I tried uploading this a few days ago, but had a technical fault - so had to remove it! If you're wondering why you've seen it before - you were in the lucky 1000 views previously! X
I thought this would be a fail for sure. Pretty cool. Definitely would be hard to get even I think
The fact that she drops everything just freaks me out 😂 no offense, love you em 💓
Cara delevingne brows right there
Love your vids. This one is super quiet though :/ no hate! Just didn't know if you were aware. :)
Keep this background pls
I just love how clumsy you are and so jumpy. So cute! Love your chanell btw!
I love the fact that now she smiles alot in the videos 😍😍\n. Yes.. that brow stamp .. nailed it 😍
These brows look SO good on you!! No one has perfectly matching brows so no one would give yours a second look. We are our own worst critics - but this looks really, really good. Like, I want to try it now!!!
could u do a full face of elf i know that you done a full face of drugstore with some elf products in but could you do a full face if that possible? btw i luv ur channel :)
Wow I think you actually look good with the thicker brow! AND I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT TO WORK THAT WELL. Thanks for another awesome video, Em! 💖
Girl! You are perfection! Without makeup- so beautiful with makeup- just as beautiful! You are the most beautiful person i've seen
Ur so funny and positive 😂 I love it!
The brows look simply GOOD! Thanks for making me laugh again!
looking forward for u to review some stuff from makeup revolution....
you are the cutest person I have _ever_ seen, watching your videos makes me gay - never thought this would happen to me.
This actually looks surprisingly good! I mean, if you stamp them on in 3 seconds, you can touch them up quite a bit and still save time. Cool! 💕
wanna reach 500 subs can u help a sis out ^_^ have a good day:-)
your videos make me so happy ♡♡♡
That eyebrow is going to be walking 2 paces ahead of the rest of my body! HAHAHA! You are amazing and hilarious! <3
U need to spend 3 weeks on them  brows lol
Hi have you tried the foundation from dermacol ?
Plzzz change ur name from my pale skin to beautiful me coz u look so beautiful
Try the EgoEra facial mask maker. It looks interesting.
Actually this is intriguing! I'm missing half an eyebrow from a dog attack if this would work then it would save me so much time everyday having to completely draw on my brow from scratch and having to match it to the other. Does anybody know how pigmented the powder is on just plain skin???
Your reactions was so funny! I tried it on my mother but oh no, it wasn't so pretty lol
You're always dropping things 😂 \nLove your videos ♥️
your mazing and make my day your so funny! ENERGY. BUT can we get fall makeup LOOK?! OR NO..AND look idk stamp hmm how make eyebrows perf lmaooo did , OTHER HACKS instgram hype lol no missed video so new! TROOPER MOTIVATION GREAT . what foundation using?!
I love this!  I'm going to have to try it.  I would love to see a tutorial on your makeup look in this video!
You're the only person I've seen who didn't completely miss their brow when using this product!!
Yes I‘ve seen this video a few days ago😂
Brow stamp pretty cool....what eye shadow are you wearing it's lovely!!!
Love the video! So happy you finally uploaded this video!
I feel like you already did this before! Dejavue. Just like the video where you tested the Derma-high-coverage foundation! :D
I thought that only i have got one easy-brow and one hard-brow x)
I really like the thicker brow on the left.
Hey !! Just one suggestion- start giving marks out of 10 to the products u review. That would be good. Love your videos. :*
I CANT BELIEVE YOUR GOING TO HELLOWORLD ARGH I AM SO EXCITED
I think this could actually work for me!? Still better than doing it all with my clumsy hand! LOL :D
The product is pretty good may try it myself 😊
Hola muy buenos tus videos sigue así 👌❤️
```    ```
Not lucky one... Wish I could 😨😞
I literally just watched reaction time react to your pale skin video about how you are ugly your such an inspiration and continue to do what you are doing 🙂
What foundation are you wearing here. Your skin looks great
I Need that! 😳
Does anybody prefer the harder brow
Awesome video!!!!

They look so good!! I literally do my brows in 5 seconds for each lol
U r so beautiful. An inspiration to us all 😍❤👑
Really surprising how nice it looked! Id be scared to try it 😱
I dunno but almost all of her unboxing vids she MUST act clumsy and something MUST fall down. Annoying.
It looked great on you!! Wow! 👌🏼
Try rolling the stamp so it get the whole brow
First comment!!!!! Love your videos they are so inspiring!
I am pleasantly surprised at the results. Good job!
I am genuinly so surprised at how they came out! Brow game on point!

Super love your review always. ❤️ #notifsquad
OMG you totally nailed it Em!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏👏😘😘
First comment mother frickerrr
I'm such a fannnn 💕
why don't you just fill in your brows like a normal person... this would probably make my brows really uneven! lol (if i do it)
i love you guys so much, thank you for always being there for me through everything
You’re such an inspiration 😍 I love you and you got this boo, keep your head up high ❤️
he talks so fast that if you slow down the vid, it sounds like hes talking in normal pace hahaha love u James
when his makeup makes u stop and ask urself what u r doing wrong everytime u grab that makeup box in ur room, coz the truth is when u come out of that bathroom mirror u look like a hot mess
ok james i love your makeup looks, but was the thumbnail really necessary? Click bait isn't cool.
Oh.my.gosh I freaked when I saw the title and the thumbnail
I read tye description, anyone who says they are famous don't deserve being famous
Why is me so cute ?! 😍
Thanks for being real and talking about your experiences. Some people use social media as a way to spew hate and hurt others. They say things they would never say in person. To me, that makes them terrible cowards. You keep doing you, boo. Hang in there...❤️
James 2017- HEY SISTERS!\n\nJames 2050- HEY SISTERS!
Stay strong ❤️ you’re a huge inspiration to everyone 😽 love you 💯
You should do a mermaid Halloween tutorial! It would look so cute on you!
Just in time for Halloween.
You're a wonderful make up artist so I'll start there. As a woman I really hate when you call everyone sisters. I feel like you refer to yourself that way as well and it irritates me. There are men in the make up world, as you obviously know.
you are so talented, your make-up skills are beyond this world<3
Ok like James you’re actually my favorite. You give the best advice😍😘
James I greatly respect you. All you said makes sense , i like how u dont hide it and u just lay it all out there. U arent like most people who just act like none of that gets to them, ur honest with urself and everyone else.
Awe Jamessss! We love you so much!!! There is nothing wrong at all with taking a break, sister!
Daaaamn she talks fast! Loved the look   👌🏻
i would like to see your makeup collection in a video
Love you James Charles 🙌🏽💯
One day I will have makeup... And then I can come back to these chit chat vids and do my makeup with james...untill hen I watch in makeup-less sorrow
clickbait is so annoying and desperate
Fuck the haters sister! you are unique and perfectly yourself! YOU ARE MY BIGGEST INSPIRATION AND ILYSFM❤️❤️
You are so open and you really  get personal with us. That's really hard to find on the internet lately, and it means a lot to find a YouTuber that really shows us his personal side. Also you are an amazing and talented person, so no matter what others say, you are still awesome. Please don't quit YouTube because there's so may people out there that love you so much. You have me and so many other people that love you so much. Thank you for that. I love you so much, and please keep doing what you normally do.
So you aren't really leaving YouTube. You only left for a few days. Click bait. Disappointing
I'm sorry but the fact that you said that Make-up means the entire world to you,...oh man, you should be more aware of what world actually is.
Please don't go anywhere - ever. You're such an inspiration and I just adore you :)
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! It makes me so sad when I hear my favorite influencers having trouble with the negative they receive from social media/their videos etc...Jaclyn Hill is going through this a bit as well. \nIt just astonishes me because I watch you and am so amazed, and inspired and love you, and can't believe people have the audacity to sit and type negative shit. Why do they watch, engage, if they don't like you? \nI wish you could focus on all the love, because you know there are 1,000s of us who support you 100%, but I know it's not that easy.\nAnyways, glad you're feeling better and back on your A-game. Let the haters make you stronger.
James your eyes are so beautiful
I love you James I’m the biggest fan and biggest supporter I will never stop watching I have every sister apparel all my makeup looks are inspired by you even though I don’t do makeup that much when I watch you make me forget my worry you are the only one when I’m alone you make me forget thank you so much if you see this James I absolutely love You and that is why
So im going to do a really genuine video and talk with you guys but just to let you know its sponsored so i would have never done it if i wasnt getting paid because im having a dramatic breakdown.
Keep fighting the good fight, baby. Every wonderful thing that happens to you, you deserve. Every hurtful thing that is said to you, you don't deserve. You're beautiful, inside and out. And you are much loved.
Thank you James for posting this and for being so real :)
being that young and trying to be as respectful and supportive as you do, youre one of the few makeup artists i actually like youre so talented
I have 3 melting pouts and all of them stopped squeezing out easily after like 2 weeks, they're kind of drying, and they come off so easily that I can't wear them through the day. Idk, that was just my experience, I hope any of you that have them are having a better one than me.
So where's the link to see your apparel? \nI like the hoodie, but I need to see everything! 😛
He really does look like dragon from shrek
I'm just living for your nails!
I wish Charles would accept his beautiful brown eyes more instead of hiding them with his contacts..
He's so amazing ❤
If your relying on clickbait that means your not entertaining 👀
That was absolutely beautiful.
Let your wings cut those bitches up james
THIS LOOK IS SO SO SOOOOO BOMB
When he talks he looks half asleep😂😂 I love how real you are❤️❤️
Damn. Got my hopes up for nothing.
James Charles I thought I ordered some sisters merch, but I haven't received it but when I was ordering it it said it went through and that I would be getting an email, but I haven't received one
Cutting straight to the point *14: 41 to find out it was freaking clickbait*
Who else watches James Charles on 0.75 speed since he talks so fast?! 😂
I think you are so chill.you are pretty and handsome at the same time! Can u do more cover girl products?
I was looking for a lip liner that would work with all my different lipsticks. I didn't know covergirl offered a product like that.
I only clicked on this because it said he was leaving YouTube... I'm a victim of clickbait
Okay we get it, you think he speaks fast, Whatever. Jeez! 😂
when he says to get ready with him i really dont cuz i dont have makeup i just eat and wait if my future comes on a bottom of a bowl of cereal
By the title I thought you were leaving forever! Omg if you ever permanently left YouTube I'm gonna be upset but I understand why you needed a break.
the eyes are absolutely beautiful omg
You are such a beautiful human and you honestly my icon and honestly you should never listen to any of those negative people because all of your fans love you so much ❤️❤️❤️
You are so  talented I've learned so much from you and you are amazing don't listen to anyone. Your hands are gold and you deserve everything that you've achieved. Love you❤️❤️
THIS MAKEUP IS EVERYTHING! 😍
You're talking so dang fast in this video woooooh!!  Lol but I agree
Awww James it's all okay . We don't think you're complaining at all . We love you more than anything . Also sisters stay sisters for life . Stick like glue ♥️
Love your makeup but why would you make your title such clickbait.. lol I don't understand why you wouldn't just title it addressing the hate or something like that.
you should be flashback mary for halloween
Why doesn't James ever blend his foundation into his neck properly? You can clearly see how tan his foundation is next to his neck...
Not being horrible but how crusty are his lips , no hate i love him <3
This look was so fucking pretty 😩😍🔥
Can you Do the power of make up video?❤️
Love you James, your amazing and I love you so so much<3 your amazing and deserve so much better <333 I love you 💕 @jamescharles

I love you and your videos and can I just say SLAY ALL DAY SISTAA!!!!!! 😘❤️😉😂
they should download drivers first and put them on a thumb drive so they can install them easily
A very informative video about a very bad idea.
This is just in time for Halloween season.
Im no doctor...But I'm pretty sure this guy is not going to make it. Brave of him to try though. I hope the best for him.
2:14 is there any video of this on youtube or internet ?
This would never work. You doctors think your Frankenstein? That was a fictional novel. So it can't be possible in reality. Why don't you doctors stop trying to play God and trying to perform the impossible?
so no mention of immune reaction?
*3-4 weeks in the coma not 3 days
Actually Valery Spiridonov changed his mind and the surgery will be executed on a chinese patient in Q1 2018.
thats absurd! why doesnt this quack start curing people with severed spinal cords then? if he thinks he can cut off a head and reconnect it, he should start with his own!
You cannot transplant a human head it is not possible you cannot get the nerves to grow back together otherwise we would have a cure for all paralyzed people.This must be some kind of publicity stunt. This is absolutely morally wrong this is ridiculous something should be done about this YouTube should stop this this is absolutely ridiculous this is absolutely a very bad joke they're paralyzed people all over the world and they should not be given a false hope something so ridiculous
Trillions of nerves and blood vessels to be connected....
I have never been so disturbed. Imagine going to sleep and waking up with someone elses body. How can this even work? The body reject new head?
I had a brain surgery and I  would  not recommend  the precedure. i was traumatized, imagine  the  guy when he wakes up, hell no! really  scary stuff.
...ehh, it's more like transplanting a body
I have a prediction,  by the end of this operation there will be two dead people.
When exactly is the operation scheduled?
Theoretically you could live forever wirh he this
bbc earth labs i would love to know how you get your info
Which is the body where it will be transplanted his name???
This type of stuff sounds like what my biology teacher would do.
This is going to go horribly wrong...
Soap opras  have been doing it for years hahaha
The healthy brain, if the surgery is successful, will still need to relearn how to control a body, given the fact that the person has been paralyzed all his life. So, even if everything goes fine, he will need tons of physical and neurological rehabilitation.
wouldn't it be quite a surprise if the transplant was successful but the guy claims to be and acts like the guy who went brain dead.
The fact this sotry actually turned out to be true and not some elaborate marketing for Metal Gear Solid V blows my mind honestly...
Is this a Jojo reference?
How are we meant to know if it works without trying?
I'm just gonna wait until they create prostethic bodies Ghost in the Shell style, thanks.
I believe there will be one big fail :/
Lucky for me I don't need transplants. But I hope to have robot body when I'm very old and live forever YEAH!
X Files did it first.
Is it possible to transplant a head of a girl to a head of a man or vice versa?
I have a feeling that some people with high power within the medical industry would undermine this.
I really hope the surgeons play Eminems 'Lose Yourself' during the operation.\n😆
its technically.. a body transplant
This will be an amazing experiment - even if it fails. If it works - we gain a major insight into the connection between the body and the brain in addition to getting a step closer to having a synthetically grown body replacement for spinal cord injuries, lost limbs and various other conditions potentially including death! Or, if it turns out growing a body is too hard or expensive, we can just wire the head into a robotic body able to keep the head alive until a replacement body can be safely grown.\n\nThere is a first time for everything. This body transplant was bound to happen sooner or later. Even a failure here will push us towards the first success. This will be a great leap in medical science one way or the other.
just thinking about it makes me cringe
Guys, don't get ahead of our selves. ;)
What if its the head's last hope of surviving and the body donor is already clinically dead?  why does the video only explores the controversial side but at least no a single different approach
Is this some sort of European April Fool's day that I'm not aware of?
Lots of your facts are incorrect. Do you fact check at all?
Not for me thanks, but I am a registered diner.
In the name of SCIENCE!!
I imagine we'll have better luck in the future if we manage to make trainable wetware interfaces - you'd grow a network of connections into the base of the patient's brain, then attach a signal processor. Do the same to the top of the spine of the donor body. Train computers to interpret each body's signalling, then connect the computers. This way, you could correct for differences between the two nervous systems with software. Much more precise than just hoping for the best in case nerve behavior doesn't match up between bodies.\n\nOf course, we'd need to figure out how to grow those artificial nerve taps first, and then how to probe the connections without causing brain damage
The dog head being kept alive is probably the most disturbing thing I have ever seen.
During kidney transplant the faulty kidney is not removed thus thw patient has 3 kidneys...
It would help if ur a dullahan
Oh, idk maybe you should do this successfully on an animal first.... All those dogs and monkeys died minutes later.
sounds weird but I would choose to change my body with one from the other gender. I don't think this will make it harder? Or take the body of a chimpanzee!
I understand how exciting it is from a scientific technical viewpoint.... and do we really need that? Who is important enough  to revive this $$$ endeavour. It would be interesting to see what this would be fotr the new combined human.. there are memories by the body beside the brain... and for example the gut brain connection... i would rather have us figure out how we can make life  good for us and all living beings on this planet first... solving urging now problems... but humans curiosity of its ability to figure out nature seems non unstoppable
There are thousands of nerves in the spinal chord, are they going to just glue them all together as a clump or are they going to try and connect each nerve individually and how would they know which individual nerve is which? If they glue it as a single clump, how will the nerves know what to do? it's not like the nerves themselves can seek out and find the correct corresponding nerve to connect to. If they try to do it individually, the time it would take would probably leave the brain with irreparable damage. Morality aside, this is a fascinating and exciting prospect for medical science, although I doubt very much that there is any chance of success. Respect to the person volunteering to have their head transplanted though, even if I was a quadriplegic and dying, I wouldn't be brave enough to volunteer for this operation.
there's no way it's going to be successful
What's the moral questions about, if the donor wants to donate his life to science?
I've been reading about this for a while. I'm soo curious of the outcome.
Will the person have 2 different dna s. Or will the head adapt to the body or is it the other way around?
I'm hoping such a procedure does occur, and even more so for it to be successful.
If I was terminally ill I would definitely take the procedure, even on the experimental stage. I would also consider it if I was immobilized by an accident or a disease (if it was already perfected).\n\nIf they manage to do the thing safely, I suppose this will be a gateway for ~rich~ people who would like to gender swap with fully functioning organs
sound just like instructions on how to put a phone back together
How many spinal nerve 'glue joints' will there be?
You are transplanting a body, not the head!
PEG was used as a carrier fluid for electronic cigarette fluid early on, it wasn’t very popular due to its taste.
if i was disabled or some other life threatening issue. then yes i would have it done.
Drain the head of blood, seems like a problem recovering from that alone.
Do NOT search the video of the bodyless dog. Don't do it. Just Don't.
skip tp 3:00 if you are not a moron.
Wonder how messed up the persons life/body currently is, who is getting the new body transplant, with quite a big of a risk that it might fail.
Wasn’t this just a publicity stunt for metal gear solid 5?????
Maybe this is body transplant
Just thinking about this is giving me the shakes, I do not like this at all 😵😳🤦
Does he get to keep both passports? Portrait from one and fingerprints from the other.
I cut the nerve bundle in my index finger. The surgeon stitched it back together, but after 20 years I still have poorly localized feeling in that finger because the nerves are all cross wired and shorted together. Imagine a whole spine...
imagine the possibilities if this works
I feel empathetic for the person that is so desperate to be the head to be transplanted. At least you get to fade out in a medically induced sleep knowing you will probably never wake up. The person that is willing to do this is obviously doomed to an inevitable end and the person that is brain dead is in much the same situation. Neither person has much to lose here. Also this is probably going to be someone younger and capable of handling the stress and potential recovery. There's really no reason to make this political. If the doctors are willing to try it, more power to them. Think about this as if it is you facing eminent death, early in life, and you might have a chance to live longer.
IMMORTALITY HERE I COME
Fish head curry anyone?

MGS STUN
You get a like for the holding back of the pun.\n\nBut it was a good one! \n\nHave a nice weekend, Greg. Don't get ahead of yourself. :D
I have a feeling before attempting a real paying person for the procedure. They are gonna practice with deathrow inmates or secret prisoners, human trafficking victims. And perfect it just like other past experiments to learn. Humans species are crazy gotta sacrifice many to advance in the world
The real question is. when the patient survives. will his offspring be his body's or his owns? :O
I dont know if this aught to be done
Is this video directed at children? because wow this is said so childlike
A question that’s prob been asked a hundred times but what are the little numbers that pop up throughout the video? What do they mean? \n\nThanks
Wait so whats stopping thr donor body from being drained of its blood when the original head is decapitated from it? \nSurely the exposed boood vessels will result in the heart pumping the blood out of the neck.... Its not like they can cauterise the wounds since they need the blood vessels to be intact
if the body  gets injured, lets say a cut, would his brain be able to communicate with his body to heal the wound if the dna wouldn't be the same?
Just to clarify, doctors do not remove the failed kidneys of the transplant recipient unless the patient is too small to carry 3 kidneys (like children) or they have a disease called Polycystic Kidney disease or PKD, which covers your kidneys with cysts and enlarges them to the size of a football. I had a kidney transplant a year and a half ago and I have 3 kidneys, my two diseased kidneys still sit in their natural position and the transplanted kidney in the front, right above the bladder.
I just want a cybernetic body...
Poor donor. Gotta live the rest of his days without a body.
i think you missed probably one of the biggest questions: where is the donor body coming from?!
Can we stop calling it head transplant and inventing silly excuses for why we do so, and instead be adults and call it body transplant?
Wait..whose _body_ are they taking it from? That guy consented?!
polyethylene glycol is a laxative...
What if is successful, then i can transplant my head to a young teenager body to live longer.
how can the donor body be revived if it's dead?
I am not a doctor but, how are they planing that the brain will survive minutes without blood? I thought that is pretty much the definition of being dead.
The real question is, who the heck volunteered to be a body donor...
Earrings??
another makeup vid plzzzzz
Is she wearing contacts?

HI CHRISTEN !!! ♥️ I recently seen your snaps and how your eyes been twitching, also how you said you had Bell’s palsy when you were 16, My mom she’s 31 yrs old and she had gotten Bell’s palsy when she was 10 and In January she came home from work and she felt numbness on the right side of her face and she went to the E.R. And found out she had Bell’s palsy. To treat her Bell’s palsy she went to acupuncture and physical therapy, and did facial exercises. Hopefully you don’t have it because you are the best person on YouTube I’ve seen doing makeup💕♥️ I hope I could help💯💕🤞🏼🙏🏼

Let's all take a second to laugh at Sunderland
Goals are like potato chips. One is never enough.
What was Steele doing for that 5th goal 😂😂😂 can't believe I got 66/1 on this pile of crap being relegated & 12/1 bottom half finish
Shouldn't have left blackburn🤣

Its trending cuz Sunderland were at the top and now lost 5-2 wow
This is 15th on trending
Sunderland is a joke of a club. Goodbye Sunderland , being in the premiere league is history for you guys. You guys will never make it back. Oh and BTW, I'm a man u fan and I miss the guaranteed 6points every season. Anyway seems like crystal palace will be more than happy to hand out this service.

How on earth to Millwall have higher odds on promotion than Ipswich
Sunderland fans 10, Ipswich fans 1. SAFC were thrashed 5-2 but the away end sang for 90 minutes. Never experienced such a lame home crowd. It's like they're in the waiting room at the doctors – until they score the fifth! Aldershot would make more noise away at Carlisle.
How is this trending? Oooh right Ipswich actually won a match 😂😂 *OTBC!!*

*Camila definitely slayed this performance and her riffs are literally everything. She was definitely meant to be a solo artist* *and I can't wait until her album comes out. Hopefully it's soon. We just covered Havana on my channel, hope you will watch* *it.*
from shawns twitter
She is so cute...she is awsome...
Who's the backup dancer? I love them. Are they twin?
Nah. She's just not special enough to pop off into a big superstar. Outfit was cute. Performance was cute. But overall, issa no.
she's like a young Penelope Cruz...
This version is so much better!!!
Can't believe she's only 20 wow
She is so good omg she is the best singer😀😃
The dance is cool😂
Damn that trumpeter is so good
Much respect for her art and talent and she’s beyond amazing...... but jeez I’m a guy and I would let her get me pregnant
i'm shook this is the first time i listened to the original xD LOVE IT CAMILA!
I can't looking at the guy with the trumpet 😂😂\nHe is so lit
The dancers are on point ☝🏼
Love the song but her outfit is UGLY! Sorry but it doesn't show off the fit shape she has.
I want this version! Not the one with the rapper, I forget his name. Camila’s voice stands on its own, it doesn’t need a featured artist!
The name of the guy with the trumpet please
OMG I DIDNT KNOW SHE IS AN ACTRESS... CONGRATZ BABE
The latin instrumental with Cam’s vocals are just mesmerizing
This version with the trumpet is soooo much better than with the rapper and his nasty sounding voice.
The Solo Version of Havana❤️
I wish I wrote this song
Got me hooked with her Havana. Love her voice, music and dance moves. Im a fan now. 😊💖
SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT YOUNG THUG
The trumpet guy in the background is my new queen
Am I a bad person bc I watch this while watching tv coverage of this horrible Vegas tragedy? Pray 4 them, it's a long road ahead 4 those affected.
She looks and sounds like Selena Gomez at 3:20
I SCREAMED REALLY LOUD AT 1:35 I THOUGHT YOUNG THUG WILL CAME TO SING BUT I'M SO HAPPY TO HEAR THE SOLO VERSION LIVE ❤
THIS WAS  good we love the next selena
I was never a real fan of Camila, but she is so good auto tuned or not!
the song is a Hit ..but she needs to move more ..
and then at 1:50
young Shakira
this is lit
great performance, trumpet player looks ridiculous.
that guy tho . HAHAHA
Slayin 😍😍
❤❤❤
She killed it
i live.. ..
No oh yeaaashhhhhhhhh
She reminds me of Melanie Martinez 💕
Why did she leave 5th harmany???
1:24
Let’s enjoy life just the way that the trumpeter enjoyed the performance
Damn she can sing amazingly, probably he best live performance I've ever seen like in the audio she didn't even use auto tune. She also has those moves omg!!!!!
The man behind, yah he enjoys it too bro 😂 Damm! I love this song! ❤😍
What? You are iconic, love you, forever
Yes queen prove that she didn't not to show shades to others with her naturally talented slay!
Umm ok Camilla. 🤔  I enjoyed this performance. Vocals and choreo was there. The only thing I really didn't like is her hair and wardrobe. Her background dancers costumes looked better than hers, she should have switched. Other than that I loved it and I love the song. I'm here for solo Camilla
I'm honestly so surprised. I had no idea she would sound THIS good live.
Impressive, my dearest Camila! Among the 5, it was always you! You just showed the world what you got! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I bet the rest of the 5th Harmony girls are getting so jealous of what she's got up to and that she has loads of fans. Lmao
Is anyone else getting Jlo vibes??? You know, that talented, powerful, imposing, captivating diva :)
I'm sooo proud of Camila OMG <3
queen 💕
Im lucky im cuban!!!!!
😍
I love camila
that extra verse 🔥
SLAYAGE
Amazing perfomance 💜
This song is mesmerizing
A BOP!
The next Gloria Estefan
Hips don't lie 👌\nShe slayed my life\nI want this version more than the featured,_,
Am I the only one who's in love with the trumpeter? <3
Idk why but I really thought the trumpeter was Zac Efron 😭😭😭
I think the song is better without the rap 😍
Eeeeeeeeeeeeee oi gata
OMG SLAYYYYY QUEENNNNNN
She always was my fav
The trumpeter really steals the show
3k unlikes like seriously ??
Right in your face fifht harmony
Makes me felt very stupid
😍🔥
No dejo de ver esta perfomance
My gay ass brought me here again...😂😂 Her voice is so stable and crisp. She has proved that one doesn't have to be naked to sell talent. Gorgeous!
I saw this performance like 57898 times! I loved it!!!!
Made a sped up version of this song on my channel please go watch it! I think it sounds so cute! Thanks so much!
She the whole package
I like this song 😍😚😘
Now she's so happy and crying that Justin posted her song on instagram story.. She's so sweet 😍
Latina queen
This is enchanting
CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
2:05 her voice is AMAZIN.
Go Camila Go
GUYS BUY HAVANA ON ITUNES PLS
Her live can't be any more live. Her voice is so sexy >///<
CAMILA CABELLO IS PERFECT
I think the audience just focused on the trumpeter dancing! it's legit.. best thing of the performance.
she was lipsyncing u can tell in 0:27
She is wearing the same thing as Demi lovato when she sans sorry not sorry on jimmy fallon
Don't like
what is havana?
Camilla and Demi are basically wearing the same outfit in there fallon performances\n !
That moment when you realize that the trumpeter moves are doper than. Camila.
Whenever somebody says Disneyland you always have to emphasize the magic of the word when you say it.
I went to Disneyland in June 13 2017, DANGNABBIT I could of met you but I was too early, love ya! ❤️\n\n\nEdit: BTW I need to ask you a VERY important question,... DO YOU HAVE GREEN EYES? Only 2% of the population has GREEN eyes! Wow!

Jim: if you weren’t already pregnant\nLouise: then what? \nJim: I would still be married to my wife 😂😂

That’s a beautiful VW Camper😍
I loved this, I miss your vlogs!
I'm fairly sure the campervan in HTR wasn't left hand drive. It also had the newer style white/yellow registration whereas this one had the pre-1973 style black back with white print. \n\nCool vlog.
The special guest that's top secret that's in one of the last clips ;) hahaha
TOM DALEY WAS THERE OH MY 😍
This video made me so Happy!

3rd comment
Does this mean Marcus is finally being normal again?? (I unwatched him after the break up and acting like a shit.) :/
IS TOM DALEY THE ONE AT 5.01?????
I don't get how Jim acts like he and Louise are awesome friends when him and Tanya didn't invite her to their wedding but htey invited Hannah Hart. Jim did a radio show with Louise so you think that they would be better friends than Hannah.
Has anyone else noticed that naomi has just disappeared from the group
It’s no brainier, I’m getting the iPhone X.. I don’t waste money on recycled/reconditioned products such as iPhone 7/8. I work hard for my money & I expect anyone selling anything to earn it from me. It’s so very simple..
This question is totally unrelated to iPhones but I'm curious to know your answer Marques. I wanted to know what your thoughts on popsockets have you ever used them and do you think they are actually useful?
LOL @ the EWF clip
Throw me an iPhone 8 bra
Iphone X ---- Iphonesex
Misleading title man, didn’t come here to watch a q and a. 👎🏽
ur macbok wallpaper link please
Hey Mark, can you make some videos on home projectors... Thanks!
How is Apple Pay going to work?
I'm in Denmark and it's already widely known as iPhhone X not 10
What ever happened to the maingear shift that he had?
Hi Marques, I love your videos! Do you think the iPhone X should be on the market? I mean, it's as powerful as a MacBook, and who needs that much power for a phone? Even the most intensive Gaming apps won't use that much power. So, do you think the iPhone X should be on the market or should it be rebranded as 5.8 inch MacBook running iOS?
I’ll take the 8 Plus please.
will face ID consumes a lot of batteries?
What happened to the App Store wishlist??
Hey MKBHD,\n\nFirst, love the Earth, Wind and Fire plug lol. Will you be doing a review of the Apple Watch Series 3? That would be great and greatly appreciated, please and thank you!
Are u gonna review the watch series 3?
Marques is so composed it would be amazing watching him getting torn down by those wings.
Man what the fuck are you talking about? We came for info on the iPhone x, not electric cars, dumbass.
Are the speakers on the iPhone X going to be loud like the 8 plus or will they be a downgrade
I think once Apple adds fingerprint readers in the display FaceID will stay and it will be optional to have it scan your face and a finger to be place on the screen at the same time for even greater security. What do you think?
Iphone is the best \n1. Much faster \n2. The best camera  \n3. Better hardware and software integration \n4. iOS updates when you want them \n6. The best apps first \n7. No bloatware\n8. Works beautifully with macs \n9. Apple pay \n10. Family sharing \n11. Best support and help\n12 . iMessage
Are you a wrestling fan and 2k games??
From what I understand, induction charging is coming to Audi electric cars as early as 2018/2019
Isn't the swipe for home screen gesture gonna cause an interruption while in a game?
he has a quadro sitting in the back being a macbook weight
Should I sell my grandpa to buy the iPhone X?
Dude, nice shirt! Your favorite colors and your lucky number, I think? Pretty sweet
You Did Namaste in the end 😂
Please check my channel for amazing jewelry and tech reviews and unboxings. Go to my channel and then check out the playlists! Thank you guys.
Lg v30 or pixel xl 2 \nWhich is best?\nDo review of v30
That W Series cable kills me every time
*Looks at guy watching movie on iPhone X*\n\nHey, um, dude, you're, um...you're MISSING PART OF THE SCREEN!
Reachability is possible with Assistive touch on iOS, so there's your home button to use it. Also getting quick access to control center and the new lock screen (notifications) and you can set it up with the quick access YOU want/need + since they now made Double tap, and long press settings possible on it with latest iOS 11 update beside it has 3D Touch on it also, it should be the same on the iPhone X. So one hand use should not be a problem, because Assistive touch is like a home button. Make it your own! 👈😎
Well time to by the Iphone 3
at first i was like why is he saying porsche like that but now i realize i've been saying it wrong the whole time lol
MOST likely skipped the gold because it's a stainless steel body instead of aluminum.
Why are you not using a over on your iPhone 8 Plus? 😱
wait, how do you pronounce Porsche again?
I don't thin the sensor works in low light meaning you will spend half the day using your password to get in your phone...
Would you mind making comparison between the samsung's prime series and pro series
MBKHD has a lot of clout
No shameless D Brand plug for this video Brownlee?
That moment when u got your   edition  for everything you want .
Has anyone ever told you  you sound like a black guys impression of a white guy talking ?
Respected sir I like your video and your expression in that video really sir but I use someone's phone not my own because of my poverty and my unwillingness I don't have my own smartphone but I I am your big fan and domain as your big fan always and I always wish you grow more and more and prayer to God you grow more and more thank you sir.
Give me some tips to start a tech channel!!
Not a big fan of the facial recognition stuff so far. My friend has the Note 8 and I just grab it, point it at her face, it unlocks, and I run away with her phone. Is this what better security is?
Could you please make a video on Fuscia OS. Could it replace Android.
Best tech reviewer out there I dc I dc
If he likes sports and driving games, he should play rocket league
Dude give us the review of nokia 6
I enjoy your use of the word clout
Hmmm buy a 50 4k TV and a Galaxy S7 or buy an IPhone X🤔🤔🤔
One single iPhone X that will crack in a few weeks you use it $999\n200 long-lasting copies of The Bee Movie for about $999\nMake smart choices people..
Back to an Apple watch?
I saw the tweet of you converting the F to C and seeing it here for myself,  yas Marques yas <3
I don't care what anyone wants to say, but I always call it the iPhone X. 🍎😤😤😤🍎
apple the brand for people who live an illusion and think their human while their SHEEP BeeeeeeeeEeeeeEeeEe
your voice is so soothing and smooth damn
the gpu behind you is ....
Or go buy a chinesse phone, phones which got really good lately, for a fraction of the price, get all the features you actually need, and tell these corporations to eat your fatty.
'Man's so HOT'
Can someone explain what happened to the iPhone 9?
i'm legit happy for your success man. been watching for a while now. keep up the amazing work!
Should I get the 9 inch or the 12 inch dildo??????
Is it worth buying the iPhone se in 2017. And if Apple will bring the A11 chip in the se, then I guess it would be worth buying. Please guide. I don't have much to invest
I don't care who corrects me. Saying iPhone x sounds better than saying iPhone 10.
Heyyy Marques , Which is ur  all time # Favorite # phone..
iPhone 8 and 10? What about iPhone 9?
love your videos. But hoping you can put the English subtitles into the video. That can make easy for me to easy understand clearly what you said. This is because i still bad in English but also i want to see every video you make. Thanks
What do you think will be the next body part you use to unlock your phone?
1 request ! Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Unboxing And Review please (mobile released after)
Still waiting on the X vs 8...
Can a fingerprint scanner work with a toe print?
Great video man. Been watching for years. You've helped me a lot.
what do you think they will name the next iphone after iphone x?
Why don't they embed the touch id in the apple logo
MKBHD know of anyone working on utilizing NFC tech for wearables so one can for example, have credit/debit cards, train passes, ID, etc in a smartwatch?

The worst meal I ever prepared was the one I made the night I proposed to my wife...  Nerves I guess...  Still married 25 years later though.
This a fantastic example of video sponsorship done right! Awesome job YSAC & Hello Fresh
This pasta looks so good 🙌🍝🍴👍

HOW DID YOU HOLD THE CAMERA?!?!?!
This was so emotional.

My friend and I were crying laughing about Al Dente means broken teeth in French!  Backed that part up a bunch of times.
Is she into you?\n\nc. Can't tell
Nice recipe. I made it for dinner last night. Had to skip some of the cringe. While I was cooking I had to watch on mute. Commentary was too white for me.
is this is how to basic’s successful older brother?
Dude, what year was this made in? That house just reeks of early 80's mixed with a little 50's

What's the name of the sad song you play all the time?
Cucumbers are a fruit, specifically a false berry because they grow from an inferior ovary;( this means that the flower has more than one ovary for growing seeds real berry flowers have one), just like blueberries and cranberries  you should have added them to the ice cream.
I FUCKING LOVE YOU
I can't tell you how much I envy your knife skills. I try to emulate them, but...well, the doc said they couldn't reattach one finger, but did the other, so I should be back at it soo...in a while, few months, year or so. But, I'll keep watching, so I can learn more!!
i think YSAC went through a bad breakup, it's ok just subtly tell us with cucumber slices
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
What ever happened  to Dennis (the egg)?
Pant stainer, is that your nickname at school?
pan stainer HA! \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
*E A R  S Y R U P*
This is legitimately sad help
Oh my fucking God. Your videos are soooo good.
I love how your videos are instructional and also entertaining enough to distract me from the reality of my life that I'm the kind of person that doesn't even get dates with mannequins in wigs not really romantically but just to eat some food I made. But I do eat tasty food so that counts for something maybe kind of like.
Fuck man, I feel like the ending will happen to me
YSAC, sorry your dates dont work out. Invite me over, I'll read all your subliminal messages and even stay for ice cream.
This was deep, who hurt you
Hey! How do you feel about tapenade? I think you could make a great tapenade video.
I just made this and it was honestly so good
Dude. You could have cooked ramen with raw fish on top, burned the water, let all the steam escape, your personality is what would have made it happen.
Fek. That hit me hard in the feel dangit.
I am a very tall midget

Oh no... Ricegum made a video saying that he lives for this type of stuff and is going to have fun.... and at the end he said that he never takes L's

Killed it!!! Getting both pewdiepie and boyinaband to do this made this my all time favorite content cop next to the leafy roast! All hail idoops!!!
Came expecting a good time, left feeling very pleased
😂 i love how you put his old songs,
So glad he did this on Ricegum
I wanted to see the Jake Paul content cop
Damn bro you put him on the spot 🔥💯
this vid has been up for 16 hours and has over 7mil views, but is not trending... there is a vid with 130k view up for 14 hours that's on trending rn... Obviously this is intentional by youtube, but others in the comments from other countries (I'm in US) see it as #1 on trending. I like how the land of the free is the one being censored.
Even tho I’m 13 should I try to rap over it? What? I should go fuck a water faucet that’s been doused with lizard semen? Oh ok.
I didnt know this asian kid existed until today. Ive been using this youtube platform since 2011 btw
at first i was thinking i should check out his channel for context but idubbbz you really laid that dude out cold, you put enough evidence that for once im actually inclined to not feed the problem further by giving him the views. hey, thats pretty good.
Thank you so much, this was very deserved and anticipated.  keep putting these hoes in a coffin.
was waiting for pewdiepie to drop some bars :(
Never heard of the asian rapper dude, but props on the YT channel content bro
My god the likes
Why you in a sewer, bro?
Wait pewdiepie is in it ?
Idubbs can't say the N word in his raps CUZ he's white, so I thought Pewdiepie was gonna fill in for that part lmao

Look at all the GOPissdrinking, NRAsslicking, cuntservatives clans coming and trolling anybody who says anything about gun regulation
Wow Jimmy I'm done watching and supporting you. Next time do some research before pushing some agenda.
late night tv hosts bash Trump and conservatives 24/7 - and now they want your guns\nphffffftttttt - not happening
LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES!!! Where are the videos of the people dead?! There was no blood on the scene ANYWHERE. All paid actors. Just like this lying puppet. Sad jimmy, and you were one of my favorite comedians..
this is very touching. my love and thoughts are going out to all of those people and their families. its so sad.
i can understand people wanting to bear arms if its with single shot weapons but wanting fully automatic weapons that are killing machines is extreme.
Weren't box cutters used in 9-11?
Don't act like you wanna cry jimmy
The attachment of the gun is already illegal. How many deaths are happening with handguns every day on big cities? That massacre isn't the norm and you choose to ignore the wild west inside the cities.
The best revenge is make the killers to fall inlove with you every people in the world coz sometimes people killed when they're broken hearted
I mean I totally understand why people want pistols or shotguns whether for self defense or hunting or whatever...but why would any civilian needs automatic rifles or silencers...it is way beyond the need of 'self defense'... and why would any civilian needs 10 automatic rifles? gun control in America should never mean no guns, but it should take some normal sense into this market with many potential problems.
And when we go back to just using sticks and stones they will call for tighter stick control legislation. There will be a job position within the future framework of government whose function it will be to measure each man's stick. Stones must be small and smooth, just like the Libbys like em.
Hey Jimmy,  shave your beard and stop attacking America.
idubbbz's new video came out yesterday and is now 6million and growing unlike this stagnant video. youtube trending is supreme bias
Millions have been killed by oppressive governments, but conveniently leave that out.
these comments are cancer don’t bother with them
Yep, love and prayers sure DON'T cut it now!!
thanks alot just what i need to be told
I like and appreciate him taking the time to do this and announce his thoughts, but i completely disagree with everything he has just said. So you take away all the guns, what makes to think that people wont smuggle or illegally buy the guns and then us normal humans that follow the law wont have any guns to defend ourselves, then more crap like this is going to happen but it will happen on a regular basis. Think about that all you liberals.
An Australian council lady from my home town ,who was there  in it ,SAID SHE WILL NEVER GO TO AMERICA 'AGAIN' !!!!!!!!\nCome on America, help your selfies by coming down on the NRA !!!!
RICH PROTECTED HOLLYWOOD PEOPLE ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED. IT WON'T HURT HIM ONLY YOU TO DO WHAT HE SAYS.
The comments here really show the vile underbelly of the USA. You guys deserve the orange yeast infection you elected as president. And your glory days are coming to an end, not because of immigrants or whatever bigoted reason guys have, it's simply because of your ignorance
Could you guys just stop this idiocity of blaming Jimmy to use this massacre for a standpoint of gunlaw restriction? IT IS ABSOLUTLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. When would be the apropriate time to talk about smth like that? Obviously not when as many ppl as possible are confronted with the issue according to some of you guys... you're acting like a bunch of addicts
You're making an argument from emotion, not facts. Unsubbed.
does someone see the end of the world coming , and we are the cause of it  .
leftist propaganda lies and crocodile tears. give me a break
I want to be licensed to carry a gun for my protection in the future but, if the gun laws get even more strict I might as well hand my life savings to a low-level criminal I guess....
I didn't know he's such a great actor
If you don't know what a beta male is watch this
Check your own soul before you judge Jimmy Kimmel . This guy has no business of being emotion but he is truly being patriotic and sympathetic toward the victims.  So many pin heads dislike this because you think it's poletical.
It’s to late my american friends.. u got the evil in your houses and still call it “law for selfdefence“..😢
So much misinformation in that monologue.  Did Chuck Schumer help write that one as well?\n\nThis video will correct his faslehoods:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D0HSJDkFGI
For people trying to debunk him... Why does america needs legal guns at all? I know that there will always be black market for that kind of crap but amount of deaths will definitely go down at least by a little. If that's not better than not doing anything at all then I have you guys have no hope.\n\nThings like that don't change over a short period of time, but a few generations later people will definitely learn to live by these rules!
You can throw all the gun control in the world at this issue and it's never going to stop people from mass killing others. There's a multitude of ways to make bombs that would have killed far more people than this. Men with box cutters and airplanes killed hundreds. No, this issue goes much deeper and it's happening gradually, without people even paying attention. It's  a breakdown in our moral society. It's going to get much worse before it gets better, if it ever does at all.
It's been proven that blood transfusions arnt very effective, and the risks out weigh the benefits
poor guy its so stupid why did he do that familys loose friends RIP for all dead dudes
Jimmy your not funny anymore,,,you get paid to be funny,,,Boycott NFL,,, PEOPLE READ BETWEEN THE LINES.....
someone phone kanye for his thoughts
This is how i am crying cant understand why the majority of people are blind and only see and believe what the news says and close every other possibility that could have happen or how suspicious it is
He's so funny, willing to bend all facts for a joke
People watch your show for comedy. To get away from the real world. Do your job better. Leave this discussion for the world news Jimmy
dont you ever DARE to apologise for being a human being... bless you and I hope your friends and family are safe
Can some summarize what he said? Heard it offended many people
Remember Jimmy used to be on The Man Show. Guess if you want Hollywood success it cost your balls and a large chunk of your brain. Real cute fake tears, fuckass.
He's either not very smart, he's very deceitful, or he's both. Most of these points are just completely false, and he depends on you not checking him and accepting his fake tears to push his agenda along.
As sad as the subject is, it's good to see that this pandering TV host is now 2nd on trending underneath a video made by an ACTUAL YouTubers video that IS worthy of the number one space on trending, unlike these TV, Hollywood YouTube invaders who are trying to make an extra buck whilst changing and destroying YouTube.
don't ask what i can do for my country, ask what my country can do for me.\n\n-a. leftkunt (sent via iphonex)
He's only crying because the shooter was white, if the shooter was Asian, no one would care..
good Thing I didn't subscribe.. Fakest cry in 2017!..
red cross is the worst place to donate... they built 9 homes for haiti ppl after the quake. yes just 9. dont donate to red cross!!
This is so tragic too bad it will never change. 3 maybe 6 month from now it will happen again how many more people have to die before change starts to happen. . . And this is not about party lines by the way it’s about human lives
This has been number 1 in the trending category for two days.
Well said Jimmy.
+Jimmy Kimmel Live -  Listen, genius, these guns have been around for decades.  Decade after decade, nothing has changed there.  We weren't offing people in record numbers decades ago.  What HAS changed is this 24-7 TV of holier than thou individuals spewing out their regurgitated rhetoric of Polarizing crap, exactly what you've done here in this piece, dancing on the spewed out polarization from the day's talking heads preceding you.  \n\nTelevision now, is filled full of Media pundits, Talking heads and Righteous Celebrities'  that do little more than Polarize the populace, even in their late night comedy bit's, they continue to polarize their listeners.  Day after Day, Night after Night, month after month, it's all we hear.  It's all you spew.  And you wonder why the psycho's that are listening to it, blow a gasket.  This is what has changed, not the gun.
It’s so painful. gun raw’s really needed
Jimmy Kimmel moral adjunctator of our time. My prayers don't matter?!
Ah man, if that psycho was muslim, the whole nation would've been in chaos right now.
Who is here for logan pauls vid
these fake shootings are staged so really there is NOT a gun problem except for the thugs on the street killing innocent victims and the news wont show it.
You're an idiot, Jimmy. Stop the fake crying. A simple Google search will debunk all of your claims. You made your argument from emotion, not any factual evidence. Stop trying to take advantage of the uninformed.
58 innocent people dead*\nthe 59th dead guy wasn't innocent, he was the shooter.
No Jimmy, I'm not going to stop praying.
Wonder how much he got paid to do this...
This comment section is sick. If your family ever gets gunned down by a maniac with an ak-47 dont expect sympathy. just take it like a man.
Honestly who watches this Jimmy Kimmel? Isn't he a comedian? Now he is like the nightly news? THERE IS EVIL IN THE WORLD JIMMY! THE DEVIL JIMMY! RECOGNIZE THERE IS EVIL IN THE WORLD JIMMY! Stop acting like an idiot.
Respect. I hope this has an impact on the gun issue.

美国挺住    平民是无辜的   但是如果白宫继续支持isis    这种事只会越来越多
In germany ww havent guns so we less killed persons. In america you have a lot of guns and many killed persons.\nI had never need a gun in my life.\nThe americans jjst need the guns to protect themselfes because erveryone else could have a gun.\nNobody need guns?\n\nSorry for my english
Lol why do Americans listen to law that was created more than 200 years ago. There's no need for guns in this day and age. \n\nMany countries that heavily regulate gun ownership like Japan or do not allow ownership of guns like Singapore, have the lowest crime rates in the world.
I'm just here to comment 😇
Why isn't this being labeled as a terrorist attack? Because the shooter was white American perhaps🤔
Probably kimmels best skit yet always makes me laugh
so.many.idiots. - gun regulation is literally in place for every it other modern nation and woah it DIDN'T cause civil war. But go ahead with your paranoia as 33.000 people yearly die cause you 'luve yo gunnnz' 😡
Well, you asked for it, now embrace it. This is the price for your freedome.
Oh murica, you worst enemy is not in the middle east, it's right on your next door, it's a gun issue since forever but you people prefer to argue in a infinite loop and do nothing
I just really wish me could live in a world without so much hate and fighting. I'm not gonna comment on here about my thoughts on gun control because someone will disagree and just start more hate. I just want to say we all as people if you are pro Trump or not just try to love one another I know it is so hard believe me after the things my own father has done I should hate him but I don't not for him but for me and for there to be just a bit less hate in the world.  I bring up my life not for you to feel sorry but to just please try and come together even with the people who have done you wrong. We need to get past the hate. Jimmy thank you so much for your care and love for these people and for just fighting for the world I'm the way you feel is right. I love all of you please enjoy your day and just try to show love to someone today
Time to ban the guns America.
I love him❤️
Keep your Hunting rifle, Shotgun, and Handgun, BAN Assault Rifles. No Civilians Need those.
I cut this out of the episode, but I'm seeing this question show up in the comments, so let me clarify:\n\n- The clock in the garage is ALWAYS stuck at that time in every scene you see it, at least in this episode. So the time it reads can't be used as a part of putting together an accurate timeline of events. Good job looking out for it, though!
The clock in the clone room says 12:10 is that a or pm?
I want to believe Beth cloned herself and allowed her clone to be free to do whatever so at least one Beth can live freely, but Beth is way too selfish for that.
you need to kill yourself as soon as possible

Go To Google And then Type: *FreeCodesXXX* Now this happens to be the only working FIFA Coins working from this month. Do not waste your time on other specific codes
Couldnt Rick have pre-made a beth clone like he did with his own clones in case something happend to her?
There is another clock in the scene where Beth asks rick to if he could make a clone. It is in the very background.
She's a cartoon
Real\nAnd youtube did a horrible job of algorithmically determining what I want to watch next
She's real but they made the clone anyway to go on adventures to tell her the adventures
But speeches are for campaigning, now is the time for action.\n\n*boom* Gate opens.\n\nmusic starts.\n\nWhen is the next season coming damn it. :(
Seems sorta short, I enjoy your content but there has to be more, ya know? Kinda let down because I was expecting more than just time travelling. If Beth ISN'T a clone, maybe she's acting super nice because it's her way of saying goodbye for a while. I don't know much but if I knew I was going to be replaced by a clone, I'd like to say goodbye to my family or at least have one last happy moment
Maybe they are just waiting for the clone to finish
I’m glad Beth isn’t a clone
I'm still hoping Beth is a clone. Maybe the clone didn't have 0% chance of going blade runner like Rick thought because he underestimated how smart Beth was? And maybe the gun was to put her down, but when he saw the family saying it didn't matter, (and he had no idea when the real Beth was going to come back and said the clone would be there to do her job), Rick just sucked it up and thought let's just let this clone do its thing til Beth comes back then deal with it. Plus, it's been established numerous times that Jerry's an idiot (Rick's words not mine!), so since when are we taking his word for anything?? Buuuut maybe that's just wishful thinking. \nSince the opposite is also likely, and maybe her development was just as simple as her learning to value her family more over Rick, rather than becoming more badass and in touch with the parts of her that make her like her dad. \nThat being said~ having Beth go off on an adventure would mean c-137 has the Rickiest-Rick family of all. With a Morty that occasionally talks back and takes charge, a radicalised Summer, and a radicalised Beth! Pretty sweet. Plus *cough* Epic clone vs Beth battle *cough*\nMan this is a very biased post. Obviously this is just what I wish would happen, and like you said it all just theory talk - least until season 4 :p
What if 1.56 was 1.56am and by the time they got home and started eating it was 9.30am? The background when Rick and Beth are driving home totally counters my question though it's day time
There's a clock in the garage behind the vat
That meal could be her last with her family before her clone takes over for a while which would also explain why she is being affectionate and acting wierd. Also if it takes place one hour before like explained in the video then it is just enough time to finish the meal and not too long to be at high risk of her to change her mind.
Beth is not a clone at the end of the episode, however the reson she drops a 'L' bomb is because Rick had given her a chance, the clone was cooking up why'll they had dinner, Beth's last big dinner with the famaly before she goes. In episode 10 when Rick visits Beth with the gun to kill the clone he relishes the clone has got together with Jerry again, and so he does not kill the clone because it would be unfair on Beth to deal with the love drama that her clone had caused.
Every thing about this screams...need to expand and grow. Idk how many ppl caught this but Dan H. really wanted us to believe here there was something to do with eye patch morty(cuz there is no evil only smart pple) the episode after this. He mislead and FT is just trying to relate/stretch anything he sees fit to make it work.
Rick has a portal gun.
In the very next episode, Rick says she is not a clone
but if tommy's mom drove him there rick and beth would not need to bring back the car
Did everyone just forget Rick can literally teleport with a portal gun
Beth did choose adventuring, but she wasn't cloned.  She went through detox.\n\nYou see, Rick gave her the detox treatment he and Morty got back in Rest & Ricklaxation, and her negative tendencies (the Rick part of her) were filtered out into a Toxic Beth.  That Beth went to ride reality, and meanwhile the Real Beth is content with her life on Earth.
What about the tone to pick up Tommy's mom then drive all the daddy there with him
In a fictional world the nearest execution chamber isn't necessarily 4.5 hours away. I think it's supposed to be ambiguous.
BUT...\nWhat if that was her last day, she decides to leave but wants to have one last meal with the family, hence the overly loving nature of Beth, and the somewhat proud and smug demeanor of Rick.\n\nThat does beg the question of why rick didn't kill Clone Beth in the final episode, but maybe he just wants to keep things under wraps so Morty and Summer don't hate their mother (and Rick for letting her leave) and choose to live with Jerry.
why must you ruin everything you touch?
It’s clone rick
You're assuming that Rick didn't just portal to outside of the house as he's done before, then walked through the door.
I thought clone b4, but I definitely think shes real now
But Jerry pulled Summer and Morty out of school. And what if Beth is spending her last night with her family at the end of the episode; before being replaced in Episode 10 onward?
Not its confirmed in the Finale
Jerry pulls them out of school……\n\nAND the next episode basically confirms she IS a clone by her being unsure of her authenticity... the REAL Beth would KNOW!\n\n(Edit)\nAdditionally it could have been a “last meal” kind of thing while the clone was being cooked up.
This season was so nothing if that was the finale omg
Counter theory. Even though Rick may have not had enough time to clone Beth by the time Morty and Summer get home, this does not mean that at the dinner scene that there isn't a clone of Beth being cooked up at that time. Beth could very easily have been that affectionate to Rick and the kids because she knew that it would be the last time she would see them for a while. Beth may have left in between episodes or when the kids were sleeping making the Beth in the finale actually a clone. Rick is able to clone Tommy with just a finger so we know that the person being cloned does not have to be there for the process, only a part of them, for example, a sample of Beth's blood, a few strands of hair, or some skin cells. My theory, dear Matpat, is that while Beth may be the real deal at the end of The ABC's of Beth episode that by the time the finale rolls around she could be gone already, replaced with a clone, and no one would notice. \n\nNOTE THAT THIS PARAGRAPH WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THE FINALE. That's why in the finale Beth brings up the discussion she had with Rick about being a clone, it was the show creator's way of reminding you that this happened, and they wouldn't do something like that unless it was VERY important. Which is further supported by the fact that it's so heavily focused on in regards to Beth and Jerry. Remember what she says while she's in Jerry's apartment, that she remembers hating that night but that she no longer does. Yes, it could be argued that this is simply because of her coming to accept herself for who she truly is and missing Jerry, but it's more likely, at least to me that this is what the CLONE is feeling. Rick may be a genius, but it's not like his experiments do not occasionally go wrong or have a fault. Let's not forget that the entire population of one of the realities were turned into monsters back in season one. Not to mention that wouldn't it be a much more satisfying plot point later when the real Beth comes home?\n\nSPOILERS CONTINUE. This is also why Rick does NOT shoot Beth at the end, it's not because she's his real daughter, it's because he doesn't want Beth's cover to be blown. He loves Beth, he even says so when suggesting that he clone her. He knows that Beth needs Rick to continue acting as if she's still there with them.\n\nOMG SO MANY SPOILERS LOL! So with the evidence I have described, her being affectionate to her family because she's leaving, the fact that she could have easily left between episodes or when no one was looking, that just because we don't see Beth being cloned doesn't mean it's not happening, the fact that it's brought up again in the finale to remind us that it happened, her renewed love for Jerry possibly being a flaw in the cloning process, and Rick wanting to maintain Beth's cover, would it really be so strange if finale Beth is clone Beth?\n\nSo while I do agree with your theory that Beth is real at the end of The ABC's of Beth, it's not impossible that she's a clone in the finale. But hey, that's just a theory...
What about those clocks that are backwards? Also are u doing the emoji movie???
she was a clone
Rick would never be affectionate with a clone
Dude... All clocks usually say 2. Like, the clock in the background of the garage where Rick explains he can make a clone of Beth. In fact, it says 2 o'clock in the clip you used... You disproved your own theory...\n\nAlso, Jerry pulled the kids out of school to have them run from his ex-soulbond. So... that didn't happen on a Sunday. You're terrible at this.
Rick might have clones already made of each character
Clone.\n\nRick could have started the process as soon as they finished Tommy. Rick could have used the portal gun for a brief moment to go back at home without Beth.
They didn’t drive to the execution they drove to tommies mums house
you should do a video on how superman catches people falling and what impact that would have on there body due to supermans arms would it be safe or deadly and harder than the ground
She’s not a clone, she’s Beth from another dimension.
i say neigh neither she is programed robot that he made after he told her or mind control
I hqve a couple thoughts on a couple things you said. The first is about the drive. Couldn't have Rick brought the portal gun with him, take the car to the place and drive though a portal to get home? And when has rick ever cared who saw he had high tech stuff? Another thing is that Summer and Morty were taken out of school. That had to be on Monday. Another thing is wouldn't the cloning process take a lot less time because he has a full Beth to use. Rick said about 3 hours when he seen he only had the finger. He had the full Beth there so it would probably take a lot less time. And the cloning equipment was already set up so they don't have to bring it out. Any thoughts on my conclusions?
hey guys I'm a recording Artist I go by the name Ajey I make dope music you guys should check my channel out and help me reach 10k subscribers I'm almost there
You havent realized it yet, but by now you should know that I just wasted..... exactly 5 seconds of you time.\n\nHave a good day.
Maybe they just teleported outside.... Also beth and rick were acting pretty sketchy jus saying
But why isn't content cop on the trending page
Rick might have a Beth clone already. It isn't impossible.
Can you do a theory about who evil morty is
What if Beth thought about it for a week and then later asked Rick to clone her? There's no guarantee it didn't eventually happen...
Pls subscribe me and I will subscribe you.
Rick could have also already had a clone of Beth ready. He could have multiple Beth clones ready, just like he had a bunch of clones visible during the Tiny Rick episode.
also that clone of tom appears to not know whats happening
We know C137 has no chance of being OUR timeline, or even the timeline of the Morty we've been following. So, is it harder to believe that there wasn't an execution chamber closer to them, or that IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER. \n\nThis entire season has been screaming existential nihilism in everyone's face, and they STILL look for meaning, even when they literally tell you not to. I know it's your job Mattpatt. I love ya, but ultimately, by probing it, you're missing the whole point.
It ends on Monday not Sunday because jerry pulls morty out of class to escape his alien ex, which can only happen on weekdays.
Schools on sundays... :)

Did you just forget that Rick has a PORTAL GUN and effectively teleport so why the hell would he need a shitty car?
What if rick already had a clone of beth in the lair under the garage and constantly had her memorys updated and we do know that the lair has multiple rooms from the mortys mind blowers episode so a clone could be down there and about the time rick could have portaled home and erased tommys memory of it and in the mind blower episode we see rick always has it on him so yeah.
what if they just teleported the car back home.
Clone
Rick knows he is on a show he knows he can time travel and just because he says he wouldn't doesn't make it true also maybe he hadn't cloned her at that point but he she may have changed her mind before the next weeks episode.
Anyone know where I can get an eye mask like theirs ???

I want Arnold Schwarzenegger to be my mom so I can say I was in the Movie Junior and get so much sympathy I can screw up at everything and still be brave!
seems appropriate to be talking about hot sauce after idubbz’s upload
If Rhett's mom is my choice, does this mean I cannot fantasize about her anymore?
# qtmba. \n“ where do hamsters live besides the pet store?”
I legit just watched the hot sauce taste tast and was like THEY NEED TO DO MORE. btws if you havnt listened to their podcast you're missing out!!!!!!
how’d rhett know that Link was highfiving him
I will make an amazing REMIX for whoever subs to my new REMIX channel. Just let me know what song you want me too remix in my comments! Thanks a lot for supporting the little guy :-)!
Here's a suggestion for Rhett and Link and the GMM crew how about a zombie/Frankenstein walk contest? It's something that me and my 4year old daughter have been working on it also helps get over your fear of it!!!
It’s kinda hot to see them suck on a finger
I WAS JUST IN DESTIN FLORIDA A WEEK AGO!
Am I the only one who is amazed Rhett switched over to jack in the box over his better judgement, but was still right.  Well played 😂
Bruh who even considers Taco Bell sauce hot sauce u weak if u say it’s hot😂😂😂😂
I'm kind of disappointed they didn't do their no we're both great thing
Why does this show always make me hungry?
Man's not hot
Never dis the taco bell hot sauce. That stuff is amazing af
I want Ellen Degeneres to be my mom.
as you can see, we can't lmao
Why didnt they reveal what the sauces were ? They will be ahockes to know that the chuncky sauce was taco bell.
I was an only child. I'd pick the Octomom so I could still be socially awkward but not lonely.
When I wake up this Better have 500 Likes!
Hey guys don’t mean to intrude but if you would please go follow me on Twitter @Stockett64.......I want to start tweeting regularly but I’ll need more followers and everybody’s support to do that so if you would please smash that follow button, thanks!!!

I was expecting link to say we are no strangers to love at the beginning
It’s been trending all day, and in less than 24 hours it’s gotten 1 million views! GMM has been kickin’ booty this season!
3:45 link's like; wow, he's really enjoying it!
Should've gotten Diablo sauce for the taco bell..  what are you thinking??
They totally missed the opportunity to call it a fuego finger.
😝😆👣 boy feet videos on my channel!!!!
Taste tests are always the best videos!☺
How did they high 5 and get it that straight the 1st time if they can't see😂😂
Watch at 1.5x speed for an extra laugh
Poor Rhett 🤣.  His high five got rejected🙍‍♂️
Why are you two goofy bastarts so happy
When they both guessed chick fil a I CRACKED UP at the high five/thumbs up thing they had going on! 😂😂
Thing is..I only watch GMM at night before sleep 😂.
You guys should do a will-it rice crispy treat .
I love when link says, As you can see, we can't. IDK why but I giggle every time!
You are the only youtubers I’ll happily watch do anything
I pick Link to be my mom\n\nCan Rhett be my dad?
8:52  I love how Rhett goes from a high pitched baby voice to a deep manly voice
Anyone else find themselves talking with a bit of a drawl after watching GMM? I normally don't have any drawl,  but I think I think it's contagious.
Should have waited until 7th october to film so they can get in on that SICHUAN SAUCE!
Why is this trending and new content cop vid isn't???
I would totally do this on the show if Jenn could be my Saucy Finger.
When you haven't watched gmm in months, and you're surprised to see a new intro
The finger makes me quiver inside every time they put it in their mouth...😖😖
Hey are u guys in this video?\nhttp://ifunny.co/fun/VDhhqtbB5
Are these guys gay or something ?
This is such a regional thing. I have only ever eaten at two of these and only Taco Bell is in my area.
my roommate is sleeping in the same room and i forgot my headphones weren’t plugged in and links TINY VOICE echoes through the entire room and all i can say was “sorry”
technically Rhette an Edict is only referred as such if it is referencing a certain place. for instance the Edict of Milan, instructed by Constantine Consul of Rome was done so in Milan.

I got all of them right and I'm not a muscian.
got them all right, was a little hard cause they are MIDI samples so they dont all sound like the real instrument, but im glad i got em all :P
Not that hard, really.
Google search: WUMO SEO. It is the most excellent Seo agency in the field. They offer 100% full money back guarantee. I highly suggest this company.
OMG I GOT IT ALL RIGHT MEOW WOW XD\nI'M SERIOUS!
Move To Google And then Type: *FreeCodesXXX* This is actually the purely working FIFA 15 coin working from this month. Never waste your free time on some other applications
i did the guitars right. thats something!
It could be an electric guitar if it weren't not an electric guitar.
Yass all right loved it keep it up !!!
5/6 cause i don't know how to cello sounds, so it was only one to stay unrecognized
The last one is a great fucking meme concept! We just need to figure out how to do it! XD
I got them all right lol. I found it difficult, but being in band for a lot of my life helped. 😂
That cello C was terrible
Can you show us what the original samples were like
i got them all right
Hooray ! I got it right ! :D
i got em all right :D was struggeling with the cello though
OH MY F*CK MY ONE YEAR OF BAND AND MUSIC THEORY PAYED OFF BOIS. I can't believe I actually got them all right.\nEDIT: Oh yeah 4 years of choir might of helped, but I still can't believe I got them right.
Yoh I got them all right. Yay me.
Pleasantly surprised that I got them all right. The clarinet one was easy because any time I hear a clarinet, my mouth goes dry. Clarinet reeds stick with you. They're so dry and the texture is weird.
Pretty cool... I don't play any instruments but I actually got them all right.
I don't want to brag, but I got all right!
I only missed one! :3
That was super easy lol!
DAFUQ IS WRONG WITH YOUR FACE
Is it just me or when i imagine an electric guitar with nylon strings it kinda hurts and gets unsettling. Just me?
It could be an electric guitar if it was 9ft long and had over 300 steel strings and 80 something keys
Hey I just listen to music all the time and I got them all right... huh...
Am I the only brass player that almost shouted when he said 'wind instrument'
2:41 the 3rd one sounds like the Miku guitar pedal!
Wierd. I have very little experience with music and tones, but I got them all right first try, and to be honest I didn't find it difficult at all.
Good to see everyone together
Damn I got the nylon guitar and piano mixed up. But better than I thought I would have done as I don't play music any more and barely listen to it.
I missed the 2nd and the last one. Mixed the two guitars. I feel like I've brought dishonor to my whole family
HIS CAMERA IS SO GOOD
They just over thought each sound tbh.
I got em' all!!
Can you try the Seaboard Block?
Andrew Huang could be an electric guitar if you replaced the strings with vocal cords, took the body of the guitar and made it human shaped, -and carved it out and filled it with organs.
My guesses \n1. Clarinet \n2. Electric Guitar\n3. Trumpet\n4. Piano\n5. Nylon Guitar\n6. Cello\nI almost had them all.
you should've done the test on youtube the same that you did with the musicians. i got a fair few of those right even though it was hard to say because my favourite youtubers said something different
It could be an electric guitar if it was an electric guitar
yo i was right on every single one
My hearing is pretty janky and I still got 'em all right.
100% but I have been a musician all my life so i'm kinda used to these tones.
holy beans, 5/6! i feel really good about myself. hell yes!
I got them all hahaha\n\nThat was a great one man! Loved it!
Could he talk anymore in the begining.
I love the zoom in on Roomie's face as he's saying cello.
😝😆👣 boy feet videos on my channel!!!!
I was *ready* for that high five today, yeah.
this comment could be an electric guitar if you replaced the strings with letters, the body with a small box, and the neck with a keyboard, and then digitised it all
Aw man, I missed one. The clarinet was easy because I actually play clarinet. That would have been embarrassing lol
really cheaply made sampling\n\nuhhhuh i think that's somehow music started. just trying to clear it up here no hate👋👏💁😂
It could be an electric guitar if you took the strings off of the guitar, mounted them horizontally alog a board, each with corresponding hammers and rectangular buttons the swing this hammers down onto the strings to create a sound
that's such a shitty trumpet sample
Wow u went to school for this shit too easy.
Got them all right! Too bad I suck at playing music
*c* *e* *l* *l* *o*
😲 I just got them all right and I haven't really applied myself with music for ten years. I honestly surprised myself
Just wanted to point out that Boyinaband was also featured in another video released today which currently has almost 6 million views, and this is trending with almost 100k views, and the other is not. Not trying to bash this video, it was super interesting and really well done, just wanted to point out this flaw in the YouTube Algorithm
So, Joseph is Roomie's real first name. Woo, thanks Andrew!
If you listen carefully to how each note rings out it is easy to determine what it is.
I got all of them right
Got all of them correct first try
NUMBER 10 ON TRENDING GOOD JOB MAN

Glad you're trending
Sometimes reporting on these things hits me hard. I know I've said it before, and I'll continue to say it but please call, text, email, or better yet tell someone in person you love them today. The world can be so cruel and our time isn't guaranteed. In case someone hasn't said it to you today, I love ya, Nation. <3
who dislikes videos like this? that's messed up
The problem with the gun control side is that they believe that evil can be legislated away. Murder, bank robbery, theft, rape, etc. are all illegal. Passing laws against these crimes has not stopped them. Laws just affect law abiding citizens and set punishment. Locks on your doors only keep honest people out. Criminals will break down doors or break windows. People still commit murder in countries with strict gun laws. France with almost total gun bans, has had mass shootings and bombings. This nut was determined to kill a lot of people. He was a pilot and thankfully he didn’t pack a plane with explosives and crash it into a crowd of 22,000. What would we ban then?  911 was accomplished with box cutters.
Phil, I can't help but feel you overlooked an entire portion of the people reacting to this tragedy. The people in question being the ones who are getting #FuckWhitePeople trending, and trying to use this as a way to further their anti-white political agenda. I have seen nothing but twitter posts explaining how this is proof that white people need to be controlled, and trying to divide the races even further. I've also seen people trying to blame Trump for this. I don't understand how or why people can take a tragedy like this and try to frame it to fit their narrative. These people are absolutely disgusting, and need to be called out for what they're doing so that the rest of the internet doesn't assume that they have the popular opinion.
Wounded Knee was the biggest mass shooting in US HISTORY
Little sympathy for American people who continue to ignore the need for better gun control. These things should never happen, not at the frequency it does, or the magnitude it does, anywhere in the world. If America doesn't wanna change, then please just leave the rest of the world alone. If you can't fix your problems, don't expect anyone else to be sympathetic.
Recently heard most deaths by guns in the US are suicide. What are people's feelings on that? And how would you in act gun laws to prevent that? They would have to be much different than gun laws to stop homicide and mass shootings, right?
stupid americans, why do you want to have guns so badly?
All isn't what it appears
I have a friend who once played football with me. His mom went and im glad she didnt get shot, but she fell and got badly injured because she fell and got trampled on.
Australia had a mass shooting in 1996 (Port Arthur) where 35 people died and 23 were wounded. The then prime minister decided to crack down on gun laws. A lot of people in Western Australia disagreed heavily and were very mad, but he passed the law and since then Australia hasn't had a mass shooting. So I'd say we seem to be doing pretty well...nobody is paranoid about getting guns taken away because barely anyone has them. I see people saying you're going to be leaving people defenceless but who are you protecting yourselves from....each other? Taking away guns is obviously really hard to process for most people in America, so I think a good start would be to at least limit the type and amount of weapons you have. Because you don't need 13 guns for protection, because serious wtf are you protecting yourselves from with that many guns. Not only that but I've been reading up on all the loop holes there are in background checks for buying guns, where if you buy them from certain places (I've heard certain gun shows are one of them), you wont get a background check done....fucking crazy. Maybe its me as I'm a 17 year old that lives in Australia and the worst thing that comes to mind when I think of guns was the Sydney Siege...but I'll never understand the need for guns. Even if it was for protection I don't think I could make the conscious decision to risk ending someone's life like that. I'm so fucking thankful that I haven't been through a school shooting, and that its not just becoming the normal thing to happen in my country. I'm sorry if I'm being rude as I know American are very prideful people.....but get your shit together and stop letting people die.
Amazing how many guys still try not to  label the guy who killed 58 people and wounded 500+ as a terrorist.  If you look at the definition of terrorism on Wikipedia it says : There is no universal agreement on the definition of terrorism. Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions . But in my opinion killing more than 58 people is a clear act of terrorism. Done with religious motives or not, it really doesn't matter after all, It has the same effect on the ground, people are terrorized and scared. And yeah, if this guy was a Muslim, all the media outlets will describe him as a terrorist without questions.
I was happy/sad to see that in my town we had a Blood donation set up to help and there were so many people almost half werent able to donate due to time restrains. I was glad I got there early.
Who cares what you think
This sounds a lot like the Bell Tower shootings by Charles Whitman.  Whitman was a normal father who suddenly went mad and shot people from a tower.  It turns out Whitman had a fast-growing brain tumour (he dedicated his brain to science just before he started shooting).  The Las Vegas shooter apparently went mad very quickly too.  It's likely that he had something similar happening to his brain.
Just another nobody that wanted to die famous and feel important. If he didnt have guns he would have built a bomb or plowed a truck through a crowd or some other twisted thing to get himself into the news.
22000 different gun laws and regulations in the US. Can anyone explain how more laws and regulations will prevent the next shooting?
I'm sorry, I can't watch this whole thing. Its too heartbreaking, I'm not in the head place to watch it and I don't think I could ever be.
I get tired of Chicago being the scape goat of gun control not working. It doesn't work because you can go on over to Indiana and bring anything you want right into Chicago.
philip, you should also talk about gun control.\nShit like this will never stop unless something changes
Oh yes if a white male with ISIS and antifa connections shoots up a country music festival, let's all make a huge deal about it because...white male. If muslims drive over people in Canada or the UK which also happened in the last 2 days, ahh nevermind. Yes this is a big deal, he was a sick guy with ties to ISIS and antifa and had gone to anti trump events. But if you're going to cover one thing cover them all, probably a bunch of leftists in the comments going fucking gun tooting white male!!
Today is a bad day, but um hit that like button, nation!
Totally agree they are bastards and society makes them famous . My heart goes out to the families of the people who died. I will never understand senseless violence , I hope that Hollywood doesn't make a movie about this like they did with other tragic horrible events. I am with you Phil Fck making terrorists famous !!!!!!!!
My heart with the victims families. I was very sad when I heard about this.
Your Thoughts and prayers aren't worth a penny.
right lets get this straight. no matter what politicians say there is NO WAY of controlling these sorts of things ABSOLUTELY NO WAY.... America is saturated with guns everyone who wants one HAS ONE there is no way youre going to limit their use now and no way youre going to take the guns away from people unless you want more mass shooting theyre at the point of no return things like this with continue to happen and while its fucked up youre forgetting that it was only 130 years ago when americans were riding around on horses killing whole villages of people its still in their genes to be able to do these horrible acts. and the American people need to accept that these things happen if they want to live in free country it comes with the territory
Thoughts and prayers not enough \n\n\nEnd of video - ‘thank you lv police’
3:33 is that johnny sins
To this point. Meaning they are still investigating. And if im not mistaken isis has only claimed 1 thing they never did.
Go fund me? What a joke! Now they want to recoup their costs for staging this event?
His girlfriend is conveniently in Thailand. He conveniently shot himself. He probably conveniently called in to report the shooting of War happen and what room he was in and that he would be dead in the room. Conveniently of course
There are videos of someone shooting from a floor way lower than 32nd.
People die or get killed in Las Vegas all the time for horrible reasons all the time. They just never get covered in news. That place is toxic and evil. I feel terrible for the victims and their family. More reason to never go to Vegas ever again.
when you have people with so much money that they throw millions or billions around like its pennies, the only thing left that they want is power and control. idk if it was the case in this instance but they often turn to desperate people who want to provide more for there loved ones and are willing to sacrifice themselves to accomplish this,  they will use these people to further their goals. its not guns that kill people i'm sorry you are scared but people can literally be killed easily any way with any thing and even nothing are you going to ban muscles? are you going to ban cars? are you going to ban rope? are you going to ban any one from coming into contact with any one else ever? regardless history has proven you can only protect against weapons with weapons. there are worst things people can get a hold of than guns even if you ban weapons determined people can find them they don't care if they are banned they don't ask permission. weapons aren't that hard to create out of almost any thing. if even a small bomb had went off in a crowd like that there would have been way worse a result than any gun could have done.
What's worse than 50 dead Americans? \n\nTighter gun laws.
Idk terrorism is a political act to instill fear into a populace, think anders brevik in norway, tim mcvey or ted kazincsky were domestic terrorists here in the us. The aurora shooter was a crazy person and this guy we dont even know his motivations. Is it terrifying yes all of those were, but the semantic in me says that some are terrorists and some are not. Its murder first and foremost which is the worst crime anyway and they are all guilty of that.
I'm in Vegas and there a big car accidents, helicopters is flying everywhere...Life is a dangerous place...
That guy’s pedigree just screams Manchurian Candidate.
I've been thinking about this lately the shooter was a millionaire he was on no watch list and not a extremist my question is why did he do it? \nA guy doesn't just wake up one day and decides something like that. \nThis takes mounts and years of planning so why ?\nMaybe he was messed in the head or was there more stress on his life that push him?\nAll I want to know is why?and is there more to this?
You lost all your credibility when you went to Dave Rubin.
I’m sorry but by definition in terms of national law, this is not an act of terrorism until a clear political motive has been determined. I’m not saying that what he did is any better than terrorism. It is equally if not more horrible. However it is important to know that under the law this will likely not be marked as a terror attack on a national level unless a political motive is found. I’m not saying I agree with the classification, I’m just saying the facts.
Talk about how there were multiple shooters, 4th floor flashes noted on video
This story makes me scared to go do something with my son. This guy was clearly depressed and wanted to end his life, he prob figured he would take some people with him, but WHY? If you want to end your life then thats on you, but nobody should get to pick when another person dies
at this point isis is a joke =w=
How did 2k people dissolve this
Great video! 1 thing that bothers me and makes me sad is seeing tons of YouTube videos saying that it was staged. You're right those people are garbage or whatever you said. This incident is not a joke! I just can't believe those people would say that. I call that pure evil.
Made me even more confused.
What a terrible tragedy... don't forget to SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON, NATION !!!!!!!!!!!! what a joke.
Ban firearms for leftists and Mass murders will be down nearly 90%. Sorry leftists, beyond your crock tears, you own this one.
10 guns made it through the hotel lobby probably in a huge heavy duffel bag...
Thank you, such a refreshing moment to not see a public figure turn this tragedy into a platform.
We all knew vegas was next... we just weren’t sure when... I really just want to hold my family. When it’s your own city it feels so personal. Everybody knows each other somehow. I can’t imagine losing a family member. My brother and I were just down there last night with a couple of my friends.. My heart truly hurts right now and I can’t stop crying..\nThey interviewed a government official and asked if the shooter worked for a federal agency and he said I can’t confirm or deny that. No political affiliation. No motive. No religion. No mental illness. Video sounds like two guns firing Lone shooter but had a walkie talkie 🤔🤔 Girlfriend is out of the country\nGovernment can’t deny that he worked for a federal agency even though his brother said he’s an accountant. Girl interviewed said there was a woman screaming that everybody was going to die 45 mins before the shooting\nIn the video I posted neither of these are from the 32nd floor. Which would be at least 3 shooters. Which would make sense why there was 10+ guns in his room.\n\nAlso this >>>\n 09/11/01 \nRoute 91 10/01
I think it's awesome you put this video up and put the links in the description.  You didn't have to do that.  I'm not necessarily a fan but seeing this lets me and others know you aren't so selfish.  Hope you stay blessed man
Sam Hyde can't keep getting away with it
What y’all think about gun control now ? Lol
I couldn't imagine being there! Not knowing where the shooter was or if there was probably more than one gunman. Being in panic and not knowing where to run or hide since the shooter could be on ground even though mostly I'll be trying to help people,but if l get really frighten my whole body goes numb and l can't run properly like welp fuck imma get shot.
People in the U.S are still debating about gun control....wtf lol
Here's my issue with the now is the time to talk about gun control, when it's right in everyone's face why we need it thing.\n\nFirst, it's politicized and weaponized grief, which I'm never a fan of.\n\nSecond, what's really being said there is we need to talk and make decisions now, before you can cool off, because now we can more easily leverage your emotions to achieve our goals. A vast majority of gun control legislation being bandied about in the courts (such as aesthetic restrictions on assault weapons) would have had absolutely no relevance on the actual event instead of using programs like Project Exile (look it up) that have proven to work (During the first year of Project Exile (1998), homicides in Richmond declined 33%, for the lowest number since 1987, and armed robberies declined 30%. In 1999, homicides declined another 21%).\n\nThere are solutions to the gun crime problem being presented on both sides, but one side is trying to use these events as leverage to force citizens to make rash decisions that move towards the solution their side prefers, (eg Hillary Clinton posting We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA”, which is essentially saying “don’t take sides, just side with me”) instead of using logic and evidence to determine which solutions are better.\n\nThey want people to make rash judgements, even though making important policy decisions quickly and emotionally is how we as citizens loose our civil rights. It's how the Patriot act was passed after 9/11, violating our 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th Amendment rights and giving us the whole NSA surveillance crap, Guantanamo and waterboarding, et cetera, it's how we got involved in Afghanistan and, by extension, Iraq and Syria, and it's
I think it was hard for everybody, and now that Las Vegas has finally had been attacked, we now know how dangerous the world can be, and I think we are all sad about what happened and can happen
I love you philip
Where is the blood?
I have a solution. Instead of taking guns away, increase the sales tax on gun and ammo by 4000%.  All tax will go to a state funded program to help people with mental illness (long - term or short - term) and combat the stigma surrounding it. Also, every gun holder should pay a yearly tax on every gun they own. \nWhat do you think? What else should be included?
I need to get views on a video using a tragedy to make money. Hopefully you demonetize this
This isn't a political issue. Stop trying to make it one. Gun control would likely not have changed the course of history. Worry more about people affected and loving your neighbor instead of trying to take their weapons.
He is not a terrorist, he is a mass shooter, I am not saying it makes it less of a monster, but I do want to make sure that concepts are not confused.
The shooting was in the past and this comment too.
Who cares if he was white or not a part of Isis? He killed people, that's what matters.
A single man could do that imagine If we (islam) is really terrorist now that we all around the world about 1.9B, we could be 2nd hilter if we really are the terrorist, \nBut no stupidty they not thinking logically,, they only clingy to put blame unto someone especially on muslim smh
Until people (read u.s citizens get fed up with this nothing will change after 72 hours of b.s lip service and the thoughts and prayers tweets.  Rational gun control is needed, longer back ground checks and a stop to all semi and fully automated weapons.  Making guns illegal is never going to happen nor should it, but people need to understand there is a middle ground and we need to strive for it.  As if not sadly, more people will loose their lives both civilians and the good cops who risk their life every day for shit pay and little praise.
Imagine  if guns were available in the UK, how bad those recent attacks would have been. Guns need to be banned in America. Change the constitution. To all those saying he would have gotten hold of a gun either way, not necessarily. Thankfully the terrorists in the UK couldn't get hold of one. Only the army should have guns, never normal people.
Let me just get this off my chest.... Guns don't  kill people,stupid people kill people and all so can people stop posting Pray for Vegas  because wtf is praying going to do I would elaborate more but don't feel like too and I would just start rambling about nonsense like I'm doing right know shit.......
Today at school I was walking up the stairs to my science class for 4th period and I saw the flags raised only half way and I knew it was for the Las Vegas victims that lost their lives on Sunday night. I was so sad after that and I hope that everyone will come together to help and support the injured and the victim’s families.😢😢😢😢😢
Drugs are highly illegal, yet there's still a huge amount of drugs and drug users in America. Almost as if criminals don't follow the laws
I feel Nice has taught us you don't need guns to kill massive amount of people, but apparently not.\n\nIf we ban guns now, I can already see where this is going, they will use trucks and 30 year from now goverment will not allow anyone to drive and we will be all forced to use auto driving car...  \n\nWe cannot yield even one step here, if they can take away second amendment now they can take away more, much more. \n\nI don't care about guns, but I care about goverment taking rights away from people.\n\nThose who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety. - Benjamin Franklin
Gun control will not solve this. If you ban guns altogether nothing will happen. Evil people will get their hands on guns. Period. All gun control is going to do is prevent people from legally defending themselves from people who illegally got weapons. Hilary Clinton and jimmy Fallon are disgusting human beings who have taken a horrible tragedy and IMMEDIATELY twisted the tragedy to push their agenda. \n\nEvil people will find a way to kill people whether they use a gun, a knife, a car, or a fucking spoon. Like I said. Taking privately owned guns away from citizens isn’t going to prevent these tragedies. It’s going to make them helpless in the face of someone who got their guns illegally. \n\nHorribly perpetrated myths like Obama’s “gun show loophole” myth are pushin people towards banning guns when they know nothing about them. I have the right to self preservation and I have the right to protect my family from the same evil that caused his tragedy. If someone illegally enters my home uninvited I have the right to splatter his brains on the wall to protect my family. I have no idea if he has a gun he obtained illegally. That’s why it’s called the “Great Equalizer”, because now I can defend myself absolutely. \n\nEvil people will always find a way to commit these atrocities. The will get guns illegally so the only question is do you want people to be allowed to legally defend themselves and save the lives of others. Maybe we should be backing out police officers who protect us from this, rather than backing BLM extremists who promote hating our officers. \n\nAll my love and prayers go to Vegas, but my family is most important to me and I have the absolute god given right to exist and to preserve my life and the lives of my family. Period end of story.
That title is the first thing they tell me every time I end up back in rehab.
just a heads up if we set gun control…there are still going to be mass shootings…thats it…cheers
you can clearly hear two different types of guns being fired. was this guy shooting two guns at the same time or something else going on here? these casinos have the best surveillance in the world, yet somehow one guy was able to carry 23 guns including assault rifles up to his room on the 32nd floor w/o drawing any suspicion?? I'm not buying that at all. so many elements of this story are outlandish
Shame on Hillary for trying to use something this horrible to try advancing her political agenda
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT\n\n\n\n\nhow you look like Rick Astley
If they take our 2nd. They'll take your 1st
At 3:32 that picture of the man at the top right who is so called dad is a pornstar .😂😂😂ffs .Name-Johnny sins
More then one shooter
Shut up cracker
GUN CONTROL NOW
YOUTUBE IS SHUTTING DOWN MY CHANNEL
Good even thoughts.
Wtf was his motivation?
Great message❤️
You speak way too fast..lol
He clearly hated millennials
2:05 ugh fakenews
I think the guy was set up, gun grab agenda.
All these fucktards going *HURR DURR THA GUNZ WERENT ILLEGAL HE BOUGHT THEM LEGALLY* clearly don't understand that he *ILLEGALLY* converted his guns to full auto. They were illegal guns. Period. End of discussion. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know jackshit about guns or American gun laws.
Can I get a subscriber ( ' ' )
I apologize in advance if I offend or anger anyone with what I'm about to say but I have to ask this question nevertheless. If you can disprove the assumptions I am basing my questions on, feel free to point them out to me and rule out my hypothesis. Ready? Okay, here we go....\n\nWith the shooter fitting none of the usual profile patterns; Stephen Paddock's friends & family being completely shocked to learn he did this and mystified to learn he even owned so many guns; and we still have no possible motive in sight, I have to ask:\n\nAre authorities 100% sure Stephen Paddock is actually the shooter— or was he just the dead body they found lying in the room that the shots were coming from with a gun in his hand?\n\nIn other words, I want to know if it's perhaps possible that this guy could also be a murder victim himself and is potentially a patsy left behind to frame for the shooting? I realize this is going off the rails and into bizarre, crackpot conspiracy theory territory, but I have to wonder if it's possible with so little of this story fitting together. Nothing about this shooter adds up or fits any type of profile whatsoever. Nothing. Friends, family, neighbors, and hotel staff all say there was absolutely nothing about this man to suggest him being capable of this. He has virtually no cyber footprint, no cause he was overly passionate about, and no strong religious or political leanings one way or the other.\n\nI thought it very odd that in the crime scene photos that were leaked today, we see him lying dead in the room with the guns left scrawled all around him.... with gloves on his hands. Now why would anyone who barricaded himself into a room with no way out, who is planning to kill himself anyway when SWAT bursts through the door, go through the trouble of wearing gloves? Gloves are used to hide fingerprints; to hide your identity. How is this consistent with someone planning to commit suicide afterwards because there's no escape, or no hiding your involvement?\n\nAnd the cameras.... Those tiny cameras he planted in the door lock and room service cart— how would anyone with no military background or tactical training be capable of any of this stuff? It doesn't make sense. In fact, it flies in the face of it!\n\nAll of this suggests that maybe, just maybe, someone in espionage could have pulled this off. But who could, and more importantly, who would do this? There's really only one state that comes to mind of being capable of this because they have a global track record of pulling off insanely mad gambits like this: North Korea. \n\nAgain, I am not a nutcase or tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist. I'm just floating this possibility since nothing else fits the puzzle pieces together. You can bite my head off now and point out where I went wrong here...
Gun control? The shooter will just get the gun illegally and then what? Now someone who could have had a concealed carry won’t even have a chance to help.
False flag operation
The shooting was fake so
I live in Florida our gun laws here are not as strict as other states, i am a gun owner and would be willing to had in my firearm if they were to pass the law to ban guns from civilians. Think about it yeah evil people will find a way no matter what but its so much harder too, more avoidable, with guns you can do what this guy did easily he was 400yards away just firing off comfortably while siting killing and injuring hundreds. & for those who will say well then the thugs and bad people will have guns and we wont, guess what those guns they have illegally came from those who bought them legally and were stolen. So ban all guns and eventually no one will have them on the streets.

I'm sorry but i can't help it but laugh at Adam Sandler there 🤣
Still waiting on ya to leave the country like you said you would Miley.
Didn’t know Happy Gilmore could play the guitar
I love Adam Sandler but hate that moustache
It's super pretty but what does it have to do with Los vegas..... I totally don't get the song???
Oh fuck, it took me a while to realize that's Adam Sandler.
I might be an asshole for this but this entire song I realized just how much I wanna fuck Miley. She's hot.
When she got her normal look she looked more pretty 💕\nGood for u girl
Why didn't Dido do this duet with Adam?
It is so beautiful!!
Her voice is annoying as hell. Go listen to the original it's much much better. :)
whaaat this is so beautiful
SOOOOOO when am i going to be able to buy this on iTunes?????
Will we ever get to purchase this cover?
yesss I am here for Adam Sandler, he sounds incredible and so does Miley. great duet!
She's like a modern day stevie nicks.
Oh and im only here for Adam Sandler. The legend.
Did anyone see that Penguin!
so good!!! i missed adam
Miley will go down as top 20 musicians of all time. If she continues at this pace she'll make the top 10 list.
Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.\nGod bless
Such a touching song, made me cry. Miley and Adam did a fantastic job, and I never knew how good a singer Adam was!
Boi I'm so moved!
Look at all the brain washed sheep in the comment section.
the jew man himself
That was really good
Somber and moving performance. Although, I wonder the meaning behind this song choice.
Freedom to buy a gun and kill people yeahhh America
Man, if you told me that Miley Cyrus and Adam Sandler could perform a good duet together before showing me this, I'd think you were describing a weird dream you had.
Whoa, i didn't know miley cyrus could sing.
This makes me so disappointed in Adam Sandler. He has a creative and emotional side but he'd rather sell out and make crap films. Such a waste.
Thank you so very much!!! Praying for Vegas
I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I do.
Left and right coming together here.
1254 human beings Don't understand what real music feels like 🤷😕
She can sing, that's for sure
TAKE NOTES JIMMY KIMMEL. This is an appropriate response to a tragedy from a late night host. Don't do a monologue about the politics of gun control. All you have to do is address it, let people know, and move on with something heartfelt.
She has such a beautiful heart and soul...love Miley from the first time I saw her till now! ❤️
After a sad day, coming home and tuning into jimmys show made the world seem much more beautiful because of this performance. Such a beautiful sound, Miley and Adam both deserve a huge thanks for brightening our lives with their music on the show.
Check out my music
exist slow court terrorist expansion agreement nail base enable.
Bless these two and Miley might do crazy shit but she is true and sincerely kind to all
This is the side of Miley I would love to see more of.
Beautiful song & i never would've imagined those 2 together, but i like it.

No wrecking ball?  No twerking?  No giant inflatable penis?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQjy4aez9Vg&t=0s
This is a horrible song.
Worth It Guys are the only good part of buzzfeed. These guys are dope.
What’s the song at about 4.30?
Josh sent a hug to my mouth, through this meat i guess.
Loving all these collabs you've been doing Sean, my wish list is getting  shorter (Bring Bill Burr and Joe Rogan!).
Thank god you didn't forget Adam
Emphasize crisis bridge secret also household compare permission tank arm furthermore.
What does this guy have against COOKING this freaking meat?  It was raw!\n\nAdam talked too much in this one.  :D
2:38 Steven def wanted to cheers with Andrew lol
Andrew's last name... holy @.@
One word to describe this video, Legendary.
Big fan of the cross pollination of getting Sean out to the world. He's a great host. These guys? They phoned it in today.
At last!!!!!!!the suspense ended Adam talked for the firsttime
Was literally deciding whether to watch Hot Ones or Worth it. This is a sign.
Kinda weird seein worth it at just one restaurant.
City slickers would pay outrageous prices for steak. Buy a good whole beef and save yourself tons of money and get equally great steaks.
I really want the chef to cough
Stay the fuck away from them cunts!!! Fuuuuuuuck!!!
Andrew and Steven were completely different personalities here than on Buzzfeed videos. Behind all the Buzzfeed sensationalism there's a bit of intellect.
I love that these three are the show! It’s nice to see someone take them out to eat good 🐶🐱🐨
Good guy Sean bringing out Adam in the limelight too.
These guys were so underwhelming and bland.
3:03 it’s Austin powers
Andrew and Steven on Hot Ones!
I feel like they weren't very enthusiastic to be on your show. Just the vibe, idk
Great episode, I can't believe buzzfeed let the worth it guys go on their own for this interview. Buzzfeed is so protective
Wish it was more of a Q&A and not some chef just talking for 10 min
Worth it guys on hot ones
Keep the tumor buzzfeed far from First We Feast
I love you adam!!! Love ur voice....
This chef is an idiot...
Afterthought. Should’ve went to Peter Luger’s. 😂
Anything to do with buzzfeed is bad, you're better than this Sean.
I feel like you've made it on YouTube once you've filmed with Sean
THANK YOU!!!! I'VE NEVER HEARD ADAM SPEAKS A FULL SENTENCE SO I LOVE YOU SEAN
The guy on the far left is Eeyore
Not a fan of Steven Lim.  Feels like he is just trying too hard to entertain.
I think it’s the first time that we actually hear Adam’s voice.\n\nHe must quit BuzzFeed I guess!
Dude, dont lower yourself to working with Buzzfeed. What the fuck.
those are my favorite guys
great work team  its pretty much bbq  /grilling season in new zealand cant wait  im a tbone guy allll dayyyy
Here in Texas these cuts are not expensive as in this place.
BuzzFeed? Really guys? Come on, you're better than this.
saw my boy andrew in the thumb nail and had to click
HOLY SHIT I WANT THOSE STEAKS!!S
This is weird. 😂 Didn't expect to see this combo from my subscribed list.
Don't put these to shows together stick to there own shows
One of the two good things Buzzfeed has (Unsolved and Worth It)
best anime crossover episode of the year, neck and neck with the fantano ep tbh
The camera guy gets no respect, but you're watching this.
don't have these guys on again; hurts you. Buzzfeed, not Josh with Bowery Meat Company. heard.
Andrew and steven \n*Why i left buzzfeed*
I should be sleeping but this is WORTH IT !!!!!
I love all these beautiful boys!
I'm a simple man, I see steak, and I like.
5:35 that’s the perfect color of a steak. Pink all throughout, no red just pink all around.... just watch their reaction. Who wants to chew on a raw piece of warm meat
That can’t be Andrews real last name.... lol
sean you a legend .... the buzzfeed guys are a bunch of twats
Omg I can't believe Ricegum was in this video after being 261'd by Edups.
Hide rick flair, 2017 has been a rough year
It's not worth it.
Oh my precious Adam feeling bad for agreeing with Andrew again. <3
This was kind of awkward. Nobody really reviewed the food, they didnt really describe much about the meat. And the chef was trying to plug his company name every 10 seconds. And then it just ended... That was a short and weird video
andrews receding hair line is making me sad
The fact that Adams there makes my little heart so happy
The first time I’ve actually heard Adam’s voice clearly.
Hell yeah tell them to do Indian food next. Also get Terry crews and childish Gambino on the show Sean
Hopefully the first and last video with these Buzzfeed cretins
Yuck!!! Mooo🐄 I need my meat well well done!!!!!!!!
Disappointed!!
Estrogen men.
FUCK BUZZFEED
fuck buzzfeed
WUUUUTTT, ADAM CAN TALK?? 😱
Awesome! Great guys!

NOOOOOOOO working with Buzzfeed? ur killin' me man.
You got fame from zoella
Giant sacks of cloth.. literally me pregnant or not 😂
The think it is fine to bottle feed it is your baby and your choice
Breast feed or bottle feed it's no ones damn business!  Your bub your choice 💕💖.  I thinks it's sooo rude to ask someone how much money they earn. In saying that, (UTUBER)Danielle Mansutti said( I think I have this right) that to work out approx how much utubers get paid per video, take the last two numbers off the views, ie if it's viewed 34650 times, they would get paid about 346 for the video. She also said it depends on the country, US utubers get paid heaps more than Australian ones. It's interesting, but I wouldn't ask or expect to be told.
Haha, my sister and I are starting our ‘Puzzle Club’ on Sunday. Thanks for the idea! ☺️
This may be a weird comment but Louise has perfect lips.
I think a persons salary is private xx
It’s a good day when you get excited over seeing a guy you don’t even know just cause of how much hype Louise has made over him 😍😍 am I the only one? Yeah probably idc 😂😂
Love your eye makeup with that hair!! So beautiful 😍
Please make a fanny prep video soon!😅 Expecting my first baby and need some tips before due date in 6weeks😝
if people are interested for the good reasons (about the  money)  I think it would be interesting to know how do you earn money 😉 not how much, I do think it's impolite
I'd say if you know someone quite well or maybe looking to apply for what job they have, asking what salary someone has is fine but i wouldnt just go around and ask anyone that does feel rude to me. Do a smaller puzzle maybe like 500 piece wouldnt be as much of a challenge😂 I've done a 1000 piece disney princess one a while ago and it was actual hell!
Don't put pressure on yourself to breastfeed, your true subscribers and people within your life will understand whatever you choose to do. It's a personal choice, I have zero intention to breastfeed even though in theory I will be completely capable of doing so.\n\nAlso looking forward to the fanny prep video! \n❤️
I still think it's rude to ask how much money someone makes but there is often a massive divide between viewers and creators which is were the interest comes in, if you're working long hours nearly everyday and come home to watch youtube and see them receiving free gifts and affording the lifestyle some do, it can be frustrating as youtube is perceived to be an 'easy' job, i don't think it is an easy job but some creators/influencers are doing incredibly well compared to say nurses or teachers.
Eating fish and chips and watching Mulan sounds like the perfect night to me!
I wasn’t breath fed and as far as I can tell the only thing that could be criticised about me is I’m socially awkward but I can’t blame my mothers tit for that
your videos always make me feel better, so thank you <3
Whilst breastfeeding is probably preferable, it’s great to be realistic. It’s not for everyone, and it’s great to be prepared for you and babe! Love your vlogs Louise (and the hair is awesome!)
I love your hair colour! 🦄😊💚💛💜💙
I don't see a link to Sarah's book
I have 2 sphynx cats and really get fed up of people saying they are ugly!! They are different for sure but not everyone is the same and i love all cats! Mine are just different!
Re Money questions - as a student I find that all my peers are happy to talk about how much they earn/their money situation (e.g. ‘ugh my job only pays £5.30 per hour’ or ‘yay my loan comes in tomorrow’ or ‘omg I only have 36p in my account’) but all the adults in my life would never talk about how much they earn, how much money they have saved up etc. I wonder when you make that transition...
I'm learning so much about childbirth and motherhood and I'm a 22 year old postgrad student 😂
I agree I think it's incredibly rude to talk about how much you earn. It is no one else's business what you earn. I think because we see youtubers living a very comfortable and sometimes luxury lifestyle people are interested to know how much you make because it seems more attainable than a traditional celebrity and also because it's curiosity isn't it, we have no idea, not even a rough idea, where as most professions you have a rough idea of the salary. But I'm on your side, i wouldn't tell anyone how much money I earn and I'd be offended if anyone felt they had the right to ask x
I bought LOADS of waterwipes. My baby (6weeks old tomorrow) bloody hates them they are sooooo cold. Just a heads up... aldi wipes and nappies are amazing! I started on pampers and waterwipes but didn't like either xx
Why did you do the puzzle like that!? Sort through all the pieces and separate the edges first!
Nobody should be forced to reveal their income but I think it would be helpful if overall as a society we were more comfortable sharing that information. At least to the people we work with or around us. Not talking about it can create shame around money (earning a lot or not earning much) and that's not helpful to anyone. Also, sharing the information can help close the gender pay gap. Obviously people have a LOT of hang ups about money and so I understand why people don't like to share. I've found it helpful to be open about it with friends, reduces any awkwardness when people know where you're at and it's easier to ask for/offer help or say when you can't afford something or you'd rather not spend money on something.
When I had my first, I was told to give my daughter a bottle at 4 weeks so that she will take a bottle. I did and I completely breastfeed her, but she takes a bottle for when I am out and it is so freeing! As far as the debate, as long as baby is fed its just fine! Breast or formula fed is best! I think it is very wise of you to be prepared!
Does anyone else automatically think of Black Books when they see The Little Book of Calm?
Missed what happened\nTo the old house cats? Xx
I think that it is slightly rude to talk about money, it is interesting to know how you and other youtubers earn money. But I don't think anybody should ask a person how much they earn, I found it awkward when my PE teacher asked me how much I earn because it is something personal to the person asked
I saw u n Marcus on tv the other day when Richard Madeley asked if you were rich … loved how u turned it back round on him. I find it so rude to ask someone about how much they earn but for some reason it seems to be ok to ask people who earn money online that question???
I'd be really interested to hear how to make money online. I am a teacher so what i earn is a matter of public record - i dont get the choice but it doesn't particularly bother me. If people earn more good for them, if they dont and theyre happy good for them! I dont find money a taboo topic, talking about it doesnt mean you are boasting as everyone appreciates you have worked hard and you frequently comment that you feel you are 'blessed' to do what you love and i feel the same - regardless of what i earn.
this is why i hate trending
I'm a teacher so my salary can be found easily online but I tell the students roughly how much I earn so they can find out how much different jobs salaries are. I think it is helpful to talk about even if it is uncomfortable to talk about sometimes.
In college I learned that talking to people (and specifically coworkers) about how much money you make is taboo because employers don't want you to discuss earnings in case you feel you are being unfairly compensated, especially in cases where female employees are paid less than men. Not exactly what you were talking about but I thought it was interesting!
Oh have you seen the Black Book episode where Bill Bailey accidentally eats a little book of calm? So funny!
Bottle vs breastfeeding debate is stressful but what works for you& baby will work for you two. My mum had to bottle feed my sisters & I for various reasons & we all turned out great. (If I may say so myself). ;)
I think it is rude to ask people how much they earn but at the same time it is good to know a general salary for a job that you could be interested in going in to
The best you can give your baby is the colostrum which is like the first few days. FED is best. There isn't enough support for breastfeeding mothers these days, so it is completely understandable when they find they can't manage. I completely respect mums who try breastfeeding but choose to move on to formula. And, to be honest, those who choose formula from the get go. You need to make the best decision for you and your baby. X
I think it is important to talk about money because we, all humans, made it such essential to us. In respect to how much anyone earns, I think you only have to divulge that personal information to people that you trust and want to tell. Of course it is interesting to find out how Youtube, AdSense and so on works. But if anyone needs further information on that because they are new youtubers I`m sure they can find it somewhere?  It`s great when more experienced youtubers share in what they found out over the years individually though. That makes for a more social and transparent community.
When people ask me how much I make I have no problem telling them, but I think it's different because I work an hourly retail job, and people are always curious to know how much you can make at different part time jobs in college.
I really wish people wouldn’t go on and on about that argue! People should do what they’re confutable with for what every reasons, just leave them too it.
26:12 I also have that laundry tablet container- I love it!
Now i want a baby lol
I breastfed for all of 3 minutes with my daughter(tried for a long long time). She wouldn't latch because she was sick and I was completely drugged up from my c section. I beat myself up about it for almost a month. My daughter will be three months on the 19th and is strictly bottle fed and 100% healthy. That squirt bottle was an absolute life saver!! I used mine for cleaning my incision after I got home and it is still in my shower
I went looking for the twine in Northampton today and it was tiny balls.  I need that one.
Actually I think it's important people feel confident to have that conversation as only then can you see the gender pay gap etc.!
you will still be the best mother you can be even if you don’t breastfeed xx
Literally at my local tapas place in my new favourite dress I just bought from ASOS the night after I was there! I feel like we'd be friends... in a non-creepy way! x
You can start to see the baby bump now
That hair looks edible... keep out of my way, I haven't had dinner yet!
I think the taboo money topic is very much a generational thing. I'm 17 and people in my generation are very used to divulging information about themselves with others and being personal. I don't have a 'real' job since I'm still in school but my friends and me have part time jobs and we all know what we earn. Talking about it can also be really good to close the pay gap!!
I am a YouTuber (Jessica's Animal Friends) and I just monetized a couple of months ago. I would LOVE any tips you have to offer regarding earning online
Does anyone know if you get a really fade line you can barely see on a pregnancy test im pregnant or not ???
Loved this video Louise! 😊 Good luck for the future with you baby 💜 I hope the fairy lights are ok! I always worry so much about ones bought online, just in case they burn or something 😂 xx
Good on you Louise for being realistic about maybe not breast feeding! It's a shame that you have to explain yourself to those type of people. Good luck with it all! Xx
I don’t mind talking about how much I earn - but only in real life, online I feel like you can’t not seem like your bragging, suppose in a video would be fine. I feel that it’s only awkward to mention because of that whole don’t mention thing...
I suppose if u are talking abt money to a friend if Ur worried abt their income and money then it's alright. But if u ask someone how much they earn as a conversation then it's just down right rude
how many months pregnant is Louise?
Please sub to me it's my birhday
Shame she has to explain herself about the bottle-feeding. Why is it anyone elses business what she chooses to do with her own children??!
https://youtu.be/8OaLzNb_C1Q😮😲
How is this trending?
Wentworth wooden English puzzles are amazing!!!!
Tmi this comment, but I found that tilting to one side on the toilet it didnt hurt to pee but it didnt hirt to get a bath for me either after i give birth and got stitches xxx
I just love the transition I've started a puzzle club, yayy - I hate puzzle club x))
How is this on trending its got 80k views
My mom only fed me formula I'm 19 and alive and well lol. I feel like moms now care too much about weird little things, do what you want Louise! xx
les olives all the way
I don’t think people should ever ask people how much they earn, it’s no ones business how much people earn🙂 xx
I believe that you can talk about money as long as the one talking about it, aren't acting inappropriate and bragging about it around people that maybe struggling with money. Money is such a touchy subject, but if you're respectful then I don't see why you can't speak about it! Loving the vlog, especially your little pumpkin top 🎃
Why don't you do a small puzzle
It drives me crazy that us mums feel the need to justify ourselves when we can’t breastfeed. I too was hospitalised with my little bambino after a week of trying to breastfeed. I lost a lot of blood during an emergency c-section and my milk didn’t come through enough for my baby boy and I was effectively starving him as I felt so much pressure to breastfeed 🙁 \nAwesome video lovely and your hair and makeup looks stunning 😘xxx
LOUISE!!! WHAT ARE THOSE GORGEOUS RED VINES!?!? DO YOU KNOW!?! CAUSE I NEED TO KNOW!!!!
Did you put the tags link only I can't find it please xx
Louise what is that lip colour!? 😍😍😍
I love seeing the stuff you actually buy rather than what's sent to you 💕 your typical amazon mom buys are awesome. Especially since we're due around the same time\nAnd this is my first! Really looking forward to your prep videos 💙💜
As a mother, who tried twice to breastfeed and had to change plans due to circumstances outside of my control both times, I hate that women still judge each other for their childcare choices! Also even if you are successful in exclusively breastfeeding a bottle sterilization system is still a must have in my opinion cause sometimes occasions arrive where you need to pump and bottle feed! Or baby just refuses to latch or whatever, and you are producing well and having those bottle feeding supplies is great and can really prevent the onset of panic when you know baby isn't getting what they need and you need to fix it now!
Louise, your hair matches my rose gold phone case! It now matches my screen thanks to your hair! Looks lovely
I've always been told that it is rude to speak on the money you make. I've always kept my earnings private because there are some that don't make as much as I do, or vise versa. And so I tend to not mention money I make.
Lou, don't worry what anyone think about the breast v bottle thing. I, like you with my first was very ill after her birth, I'd had a massive Pulmonary Embolism I had to have a CT scan which they had to inject radioactive stuff into my veins, meaning I was slightly radioactive and couldn't even hold my baba for 24hrs - which nearly killed me! Bc of how ill I was, my milk never came in either so I had no choice but to exclusively bottle feed. As for my other two, I again had to bottle feed them as my milk dried up within a day or two of having them, I have no idea why either. Also, it's handy to have bottles so if you want to express so Liam can do his share, so you can get some rest! So, to all you haters, maybe there's a reason some us can't exclusively just breast feed, as much as we'd love to, sometimes, it just can't happen :'(
I've just bought the exact same dress you were wearing at the tapas place. Since watching your videos you've given me more confidence to dress in what makes me happy which coincidentally is how you dress/clothes from to your clothing range. Thank you for helping me with that cos your style (and you) are gorgeous xxxx
I think it’s only money and you should just be as honest as possible about money so many you tubers are not honest at all about their earnings
I really really hope those cactus fairy lights are for Oli White
I believing asking how much you earn is rude in most cases. Asking for advice as how to make a living online is very useful and kind to pass on.
You just do what you want to do! No ones business but your own. I bottlefed my first because that’s what I wanted to do. I did both with number two but he weened himself onto just bottles within a couple of months 😂.\nThere is literally no reason to judge someone for their choices on this! #mumsunite 👊
Like the video idea about how a living can be made in your career field. However, totally agree straight up asking someone how much they make is rude. If someone asked me that about my job (especially a stranger) I wouldn't be giving a specific answer either.
I LOVE that maternity pumpkin top! It looks adorable on you!!! And your makeup is on point! \nI could listen to you talk all day! I just love your accent, it's so soothing to me, is that weird lol?!?! \n\nMuch love from Michigan 💗🌟💗

RIL Chester. Thanx for sharing ur music w/ da world♡♡♡
it's not fair😢
One of the saddest songs I have ever heard. Anyone else agree?
What a beautifully mesmerizing song. I must've listened to it a couple trillion times now and it still hasn't gotten old. RIP Chester, what a tragedy.
Great, now I can't stop crying
Sometimes i get angry on you chester but i again respect with whatever you did... will always love you chester..... will always miss you....you were a legend with the perfect voice that anyone wish to have....that was too early on your part to depart so soon...respect and love for linkin park....
Dam this is emotional
This hit me harder than the music video.
couldnt help but cry as i listened to this song we miss you chester <3
Whenever I had felt depressed, lonely, neglected, sad, hopeless, guilty, I used to lie over my bed and then I started playing Chester's song and within the touch of his voice, I used to feel hopeful and happy. His songs had not only showed me how to break habits, how to resist myself from drug abuse or drinking alcohol, But His songs showed me the way of light. How to overcome, How to achieve anything, How to feel happy.\n\nYeh. I could not make friends at my school or coachings. Every one used to make fun of me. Within these 10 years I had lost many of my beloved people. 3 years ago, I lost my beloved cousin whom I used to recall as my sister. 4 Years ago, I lost Both of my Grandfathers. Not to mention, My favorite TV celebrities. But Chester's voice and his tremendous meaningful lyrics used to act like magical remedies for those scarces. \nI will never know myself until I do this on my own\nAnd I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed\nI will never be anything 'til I break away from me\nI will break away, I'll find myself today\n\nThis song used to fill the gap of my loneliness and whenever I used listen to this song, I would find my cheek wet. Chester was like a member of my family. I had a plan to meet him one day. But that day had converted to a fairy tale. I lost him forever. Perhaps, From Outside everyone is thinking that I am happy and ok. But from inside, I am virtually empty now. Perhaps, No one will be able occupy his place, No one will be able to make comparision between themselves and Him. And while writting this post, I was crying like that 7 years old Saiful. 😭💔Why Chester Why? You could live for us. Millions of people like me loves you. \nYour life was priceless to us. \nYou gave me the light\nYou touched my life, \nYour legacy will be immortalized.\nRip Chester. \nSee You Again.
LP CONNECTED THE WORLD, with tragedies every day, with people dying, their music will ease us, but we should care if one more light goes out.
This is so emotional. You just can't dislike a masterpiece like this.
who would dislike this
legends never die... love u chester. u will be always in mah heart. 💜💜💜 rip chester. 🌹🌹
This is the most sadd3st song i ever heard😢
We love you Chester. I pray for you everyday. Try to stay strong Linkin Park. We're all with you always ❤️
Every time I recoup a little, LP comes up with something like this and I'm back to square 1. How on Earth are we supposed to move on? \nI mean....I have a life I'm supposed to lead, studies...career...health....family....\nWhy doesn't it all seem important now? Why is C's death the ONLY thing that seems to matter? \nGood God. I wish u knew Chester...what u meant to so many of us.. And the mess u've left behind. We cared. We always did. Too bad it wasn't enough!\nOnce u do it, u can never come back. These are ur own words. Ur words that I keep repeating in my mind and thinking and wishing u remembered them that night. \nGrew up listening to LP. It was always about 6 guys. ALWAYS.\nThis new logo with 5 lines is heartbreaking on so many levels that I can't even look at it. \nIt should have been 6 for eternity. But like they say, forever is an illusion. \nAnd so here I am.... 3 months on... Still in daze... Still numbed.... Still hoping one day it'll make sense...  \nSee u on the other side Chaz! ❤\nTo LP... \nNo band will ever create the impact that u have created. U aren't a band...We're a family! We love u all and we miss u guys. Hold on ❤❤❤❤❤

R.I.P Chester but you'll be in our hearts forever...
I feel like he was singing this song to himself like he knew he was the light that was gonna go out. And man you were one brighting light
Can you guys please live stream the concert? I would love to go but I can't afford the tickets.
Your voice can touch deep any broken soul and heal even the saddest heart, you've saved more lives than we could count. From the bottom of my heart, I love you Chester. Thank you so much for everything you've done for us, I hope you can find all the peace you deserve for leaving to mankind this wonderful gift you had within you, which is reminding people that there is always one more light in the sky, and it flickers, it flickers...
My grandfather died, hours ago .. I dont even know if I should comment this.\nWho cares if one more light goes out?
One more heart touching song from linkin park..... well i Do
Don't flicker\nBe a blaze\nBe a tinder\n\nBe a shimmer in the night\nOr a glow out of sight\n\nBe a shelter from the cold\nOr a break along the road\n\nBe a cover from the storm\nOr protection form the swarm\n\nReach out to others\nAnd reach out to yourself\nWith good care of each other\nKeep each fire ablaze\n\n\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\n- I do.
Man i just got goosebumps all over me after hearing his voice he will always be with us forever :)
I don't understand. Taylor Swift, BTS get millions of views within their first day of release. \nAnd this masterpiece still hasn't garnered 1 mil?? \nRIP Chester.
Rip chestor you Was the best

Amazing video.You are good fellows.😍😍😍 Ukraine miss you Chester😢
My dream was to see Chester live in concert. Perhaps some dreams never come true and some promises are left broken. \nI know you’re in a better place, Chester. I hope you’re happy, but we miss you more than you could have ever imagined. You will always matter.
He was sending messages about his sufferings and pain all along through his music but we all failed to grashp it! Feeling so heartbroken right now.
This was such a nice video but I wish some of them Googled the proper lyrics before submitting their videos and pics....
Pls subscribe me and I will subscribe you.😋
It’s sad hearing this bc of everything that’s going on in the world and now another tragedy in Las Vegas Rip 😭to all the beautiful people who lost their lives that day also Rip Chester 😔
Well, we do, Chester. We care.
People lost in Las Vegas, Tom Petty lost, what more to lose. CHESTER. Atleast we have his voice.

You can hear two different shooters going off at different times
But the shooter isn't a terrorist guys
Is it a coincidence that 24 hours after OJ Simpson was released on Parole 50+ are killed?? Turrible...just turrible.
My heart and Gut wrenches every second I hear those bullets go off.\n\n\nAbsolutely horrified and great full I am able to hear them from you my speakers instead of through my my ears and body \n\nRest In Peace the victims \n\nAnd may some comfort find the family and friends of those lives taken by a sick and helpless soul
This is why in Australia we banned guns. Wtf did you think was gonna happen
What the hell was he supposed to do? He got scared.
Name of the song he was playing?
a real stand up guy )-:
The sound at 1:34 is just the worst. You can literally here someone get shot then fall to the ground
Does Time magazine own this footage or what?
Too much of this sort of shit going on atm. Always in a really fkn cowardly way too. Hope he burns in hell.
Holy F**k. This is the first im seeing anything about the vegas Shooting.  :(
You blew it man you had the mike you could of takin more control of the situation ?
what song was playing when it started
EVERY SINGLE DIME the media makes form reporting on this should go to the victims or the family of the dead. WHY SHOULD THE MEDIA PROFIT via advertisements sales etc. from others suffering. They are sensationalizing it to make money. Sick and twisted as the people who voted down controlling the sale of military weapons to untrained civilians. Also responsible the manufacturers that have made billions making and selling these weapons to the public. There are people responsible and it is time they start being made to be responsible. A bolt action rifle would have save a lot of lives. A ban on high capacity magazines would have also saved lives in this case. Rolling back laws to bolt action rifles and small magazines allows people who are target shooting and hunting to still enjoy guns. Just because we have the right to bear arms does not mean we need the right to empty a 100 round mag in a few seconds. Military guns are designed for exactly what this man used them for. Weapons for hunting or target practice are not.
geez the guy performing coulda said something instead of just bailing.
Why is there not more chaos, screaming, and running???  It seems there would be after the very first round of shooting.
Thank God in my country we're normal people with no danger or enemies.
Funny, how more frequent this seems to happen now.
Guys this is evidence that there was indeed many casualties! https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=695118697344319&id=100005385840751&pnref=story
I really don't mean to disrespect or whatever, but one thing that really caught my attention was: at 1:29 you can hear the sound effect of an arrow landing in Minecraft. Seriously, my heart goes out to the victims and their families.
This is the reason why the U.S should make firearms illegal or they should control what types of firearms people can purchase at store (so not fully automattic guns). I honestly hope nothing this tramatic or awful every happens again.
So all of these shots went off and no one started screaming? Edit 250 shots later (calmly) get down, get down
I fucking HATE whoever applauds this attack, you who have earned my hate.
For sure their was a second shooter! It was just a matter of time when this was going to happen in the United states. We need to come together and build PEACE gun control laws don't matter it's Human Control over how we treat one another! Always check your surroundings and know what if something bad goes down what is my xit plan-
smh , thats bull\nShit, that was a bitch move.
Man 😞 u can catch a bullet anytime anywhere nowadays. The states are open season all year round. Advice for all Americans! Next time u go to a concert/theatre(or any large event) wear a vest!
Just the first 10 seconds make me wanna throw up the fact everything is perfect and dandy then BOOM you hear gunshots non stop it's horrible my stomach hurts from this
my prayers go out to the people that lost their lives and got injured. That guy should have lived so he could rot in prison.
😔Support for Las vegas victims by wearing one of these 'Limited Edition T-Shirt whit pride!\nLet's join forces with the victims' families to wear this shirt!!\n====> http://bit.ly/2xXqomm
This has happened so many times it's not shocking,it's approaching normal,it's not if  but when & where,it's like being conditioned & not even slowly to accept it as the new norm.Either there is nothing that can be done about it or it's going to have to happen a shit load more times,affect the right people & something extreme will have to take place.. I don't believe it can be stopped.I think it's impossible...look at these fuckers,under the radar complete surprise, soft targets galore..sometimes they have a history for the most part,un detectable..You can blame the NRA ..weapons can always be found..even if they were doing what people think they could to curtail it.Everything I said is past tense & it's way beyond this,It'sactually incredible the things we can learn to live with.
If you've seen the movie the hangover you'd know that windows in Las Vegas don't open, and no windows were smashed on that floor.
Sounds like around 0:49 he breaks the second window.
Sickening. I'm past 30 now and the world we live in today is a much more dangerous one than the world I grew up in some years ago. There are mad crazy ppl everywhere and the Internet / Facebook etc doesn't help matters. Sure, shit happened years ago of course but its on the rise today, violence, hate, terrorism, sexual abuse...etc...
Youtube comments have almost always been shit
THIS WAS IN MY CITY but I live kinda far away from the strip so I think I'm safe for now
his brother told the trutjh about him and you threatened him to change the story
I know we can't-do much about the Las Vegas shooting but at least we should pray & feel sorry for their loss. #pray4vegas\nhttps://youtu.be/M-OycNYK8gY
Disgusting. This guy shot himself because of his wimpy ass being afraid for getting beaten to death in a prison. He should have died in 58 painful ways. Scum. My condolences goes out to all of the families affected by this atrocity.
I don't even understand why someone would do this. I know there are a lot of people saying this kind of thing, but what kind of sick, twisted heart do you have to have in order to inflict such suffering upon innocent people? Clearly this man was not okay. I hope to the dear heavens that someone will actually do something to prevent this from happening again.
On the bright side a Jason Aldean concert was ended early.
Sounds like more then one gun at times
Get down!  Get down!  Those words perfectly illustrate why you need to think for yourself in an emergency.  The know-it-alls who confidently open their mouths and tell strangers what to do, are often wrong.  The correct response in this situation, or in most mass shootings, would have been to run for your life.
How could they let this happen. The law enforcement police in Las Vegas and the security at the hotel and the maids at the hotel were not doing their jobs. POINT BLANK. when you have a large gathering of people like that, youre supposed to have THOUSANDS OF POLICE ON DUTY
White people at it again
BUY GUNS. BUY AMMO. IF YOU ARE A LEGAL ABIDING CITEZEN CARYY WEAPONS. KILL THEM! WHO WANT TO HURT INNICENT PEOPLE. KILL THEM!!!!!!! MUDER THE MURDERERS!!!!!
YES
I mean, guy was a millionair, he can clearly keep himself entertained..\nbloodyhell
That's such a horrible sound I'll never forget it
why did the lights go from him to the crowd? Why aren't people running? A moving target is harder to hit.
Not much video as an observation point, rather audience
United States is full of egomaniacs, nuff said, and no offense. No gun law, no safety that's it.
pray for my Las Vegas were I live
If this was a brown guy with a beard you'd be wanting to kick every Muslim out your country and bomb their country. Since it's just another white nut American from a clearly sick gun culture... not the guns fault bro
Okay I'm sorry, but I've got to comment on something here, it's driving me absolutely bonkers and I was curious if anyone else has had the same ridiculous observation? The moment this Jason Aldean fellow (I'll be honest, I actually didn't even know who he was before this. I wouldn't say I hate country music, but I do avoid it like the plague, so, take what you want from that) stopped singing and booked it off stage (damn lucky man), they shut off all the screens and colorful lights, etc., but then some genius decided to go and turn on ALL OF THE SPOTLIGHTS ABOVE THE STAGE, thereby providing the shooter with plenty of lit up targets to shoot at! Now I understand that it could have been pitch black and the shooter still would have hit A LOT of people, he could've been just as deadly with those guns as he was with the light, and that's probably not a stretch when you consider how packed together those 22,000 human beings were... but regardless of whether or not it would have done anything, it seems to me the right approach would be to at least make it as difficult for him as possible, and from a quarter of a mile away, any darkness at all would be a good place to be if you were a concertgoer, and a place to avoid if you were the shooter, because these guys want to SEE their carnage, they want to relish and observe and absorb as much gore as they can before they turn the weapon on themselves. So shooting into a dark crowd with an automatic weapon (or weapons plural, I should say) would still be just as deadly as shooting into one with spotlights on it, maybe, but it couldn't hurt to leave the freaking lights off for crying out loud... I mean come on, I really want to know who's idea that was....
Another mass shooting in America. Why are so many of them happening now? Why are these men turning against their own people, against there own country now? And it's happening more and more often now. Why now???????
To the people condemning Jason Aldean for not saving everyone\nOkay, imagine you're at a concert. A very loud concert with lights flashing, pyrotechnics going off, music blaring, people around you whooping and hollering, etc. The singer stops and yells Run!. \n1 - What are the chances you're even going to recognize what word he's said in that fraction of a second?\n2 - What are the chances you'd even take him seriously? I mean it's a concert, a fun event, lots of shenanigans going on. Why the hell would you immediately run because of ONE word (which, as I already said, you probably didn't even hear or recognize).\n3 - Run WHERE?!?! Nobody instantly knew where the gunfire was coming from; how would people know which direction to go? If the shooter was on the ground (amidst the chaos; nobody knew he was up high) and you ran the wrong way, you might end up face to face with him!\n4 - HOW are you supposed to run?! There's thousands of people around you. Just like at a traffic light; the people in front of you have to go before you can physically go anywhere!\nSo, do you think he should have stood on the stage, in the spotlight, basically BEGGING to be an easy target and try to direct traffic? Picture it: Okay, all you people to the left of the stage, you run west towards the parking lot. Everybody in the back corner, you duck under that sign. Those in the very front, crawl under the stage. \nYeah, THAT'S gonna happen!\nOr, or, or... maybe he should have uncovered his Superman costume, flown up to the top of the hotel (bouncing bullets off his chest. ALL of the bullets at once, across the WHOLE range of sight) and subdued the shooter. THAT'S the solution. \nNo, in a situation like that, everybody just reacts and nobody - I mean NOBODY, not even all the damn keyboard warriors - knows what they'll actually do when faced with a horrific situation like that!!
Clearly gun control would have stopped this lunatic.......Yeah right.
Why does it take blood and guns for us to be scared? Why does it take death and fear for us to protect each other? Why does it take terrorism to realize how dark this world is? Why isn't the president IMMEDIATELY stepping in? Why are Americans still paying for healthcare after events like this? Why are we the only species who kill each other for no reason? \n\nAs humans, we need to come together and be one. Race is just a colour, anger is just an emotion, and earth is just a planet. I live in Canada and there has been one, I repeat ONE, terrorist attack in my city. One soldier died and that's all. Why does America have to be any different?\n\n We are all born in fear.
If I realised something was up and I had a microphone,I would've been compelled to say something to my audience.  I guess he was unsure and didn't want to cause a mass panic if he was wrong.
Did the person who was recording die?
My teacher is there
Can someone please explain to me what happened?
The Lord Jesus is coming, the times are very dark, invite the light into your heart and believe. This tragedy is heartbreaking and I pray everyone who died was covered in the blood of Jesus. You, whoever is reading this, you don't know your last day, and you DO NOT want to die unsaved. Do yourself the biggest and best thing you can do today - say a salvation prayer and call on the Lord Jesus Christ to heal you and cover you in His Blood. He is coming to take people away, talk to God and ask Him for truth, He alone is the only one who has salvation. One day, in heaven, we will know that following Jesus is what brought us to heaven. He is the way, the truth, and the light, and no man comes before the Father but by Him, trust in Him and reject ALL lies about Jesus Christ. You can follow this prayer today and get saved! Praise God!http://www.allaboutgod.com/salvation-prayer.htm He will BRING you to heaven! Get covered. The best soul insurance you can ever have is faith in Jesus. No other. \nDo not take the mark of the beast if your life depended on it.
At least celebrities are safe.
Footage of second shooter coming out now.   4th floor window, but some how i don't that second shooter will reach the nightly news...........
Aldean ran like a little bitch without warning anyone as expected of a Trump supporter.
u need to take Canadas restrictions on guns. wake up
Can't wait for the false flagers to chime in.
and yet, just another incident. people give their condolences, talk about it on the late night shows, and move on until the next mass shooting kills over 50 people. sickening. i feel terrible for the victims. there has to be a change.
so obvious it's all fake.  If you think this is real you know absolutely nothing about shooting an AR or distance or flash or smoke or how REAL people (not crisis actors) act in a real shoot out, or what numbers could expect to fall at that distance, or how much the ammo weighs, how fast it goes off, the sound of ricochet, nothing.  FAKE.
Gun laws will never happen and won't ever happen until there is a new President willing to act.  How about instead of wasting time debating that we focus more on ideas and investing in better technology to detect these guns/metal pieces in certain places. Technology will only advance in the pace we want it to. It doesn't make sense to me that there is so much security check at an airport when a plane has an average of around 100 people and and a casino that has a window to kill far more has little to none.
Why did they turn the lights on ? Almost like they turned the lights on for him to be able to see
who turned on those flood lights and why
Could he not have said something like Active shooter, take cover?
I believe that guns should be BANNED! Because if we don't, these powerful anti-gun politicians will continue to pay and recruit hired gunmen to shoot up public events and crowds of people until they win the political debate and convince the public that guns are bad. It will get worse from now on. If we keep supporting guns, these anti-gun politicians will start massacring innocent civilians until they prove their point in court and eventually pass the law.\n-Nukes (selected countries only)✓\n-Explosives✓\n-Heavy machine guns✓\n-Rifles (in progress)\n-Pistols/handguns (TBA)\n-Knives (TBA)
Too bad it was all fake because maybe Aldean could have caught one and then the music scene would have instantly improved
I see Jason Aldean got out of there quick. His new song is called Without a word from the album, Run Jason Run.
The rage of white men.  Why is the government SILENT on this?  If he was a black man, then society would justify police brutality.  If it was a Muslim, then its label as terrorism and the government would have start a war somewhere.   However, its a white guy and the worse shooting in US history but what do you hear from the government?  Nothing.  Why?  because Trump and his cabinet are ALL WHITE and to suggest a crazy white guy killing 60 people and injuring over 500 people is a lone wolf and not a systemic issue among gun owners and angry WHITE MEN is an injustice to those who were injured or KILLED.  Since 1982 62 cases of mass shootings have been perpetrated by white men; no brown, black, Asian or Muslim.  This mass shooting will continue b/c the government (white folks) refuse to monitor their crazy people.   You white folks better wake up soon.  Your own folks are killing you and you don't realize it.  Its not the gang banger's, Muslim terrorists, minorities, but your folks who own the guns.
the question is why, why would any human do this? what is u were one of the victims, if the shooter imagined this I bet he still would've done it. something in his sick, warped mind tells him I want to do this this is truly sickening. and its sad how this sort of thing is becoming something that happens almost every single day, not just in the USA but also other countries all around the world, it's just sad. sometimes I don't think I'm safe to even walk out the door alone.
Here we go with the conspiracies and being called sheeple...
Poor people... love and support
As soon as he stopped singing there should have been screams from people that had been shot! BUT there are none!
Now people will be afraid to go to church concerts.......Horrible piece of shit

That's what they get for liking country music
I deserve and i wanna win the shoes because i have 1 year without play soccer,  because i suffered an injury in my knee and i wanna get back to play again when im completely healthful. Im fan from Mexico have a nice day! :)  i hope win
Subscribed and liked! I would really love to win the boots signed by ronaldo because he’s not just playing for the goals and tricks but he plays for his fans. He gives his heart out on the field to make sure that the fans deserved happiness and he is happy when the fans are happy... He’s an inspiration not just for me but for all. I’ve learned from him not to give up and patience is the key for success. \n\nPs, I’d really love it as a birthday present this Oct 18 💖🤗😉😇
The boots are a piece of history from one of our greats
I love Ronaldo and I want to meet him so bad so the boots are the closest I'll get so pleaseee can I have the boots
I want to win because I'm new to your channel and I don't know
Hi Touzani,i deserve the signed boots because i love Ronaldo and it would mean the world to me to get a signed pair. The odds of me going overseas to see him play are very low and this would be the next best thing if it would happen
To imagine myself in those boots is awesome but signature of cr7 will make me feel like I have met cr7 personally in India and that, is dream come true.
He must be nervous as hell
*Hallo Touzani!*\n\n*Als eerst zou ik willen zeggen dat deze video echt super tof was en respect voor Ronaldo zijn medewerking!* *Ik zou die schoenen maar al te graag willen winnen omdat Ronaldo mijn echte voorbeeld is, zijn skills, zijn passes, zijn hele stijl is geweldig!* *Ik hoop dat ik ze win, maar ik gun ze natuurlijk ook aan de ander kinderen die ze willen winnen ;)*
orang indonesia kah?

Touzani wat een geweldige mooie video!! \nIk wil graag deze voetbal schoenen winnen voor mijn 7 jarige zoon Mehdi. \n\nMehdi is al vanaf zijn geboorte een strijder. Hij is geboren als een premature baby. Hij heeft gevochten voor z'n leven. Vanaf baby was hij erg gefascineerd  over de vorm van de bal. Na mate hij ouder is geworden ziet hij Ronaldo als een rolmodel. Het inspireert hem hoe hij de feeling heeft met een bal. En hoe loyaal hij voetbal speelt. Zijn technieken en trucjes doet hij dag in en dag uit na. Hij heeft een grote poster van Ronaldo in zijn kamer. Als je mehdi vraagt waarom\nHeb je Ronaldo als poster in je kamer!! Zegt ie ik wil als hem\nWorden. Iedere dag als ik wakker word. Word ik eraan herinnerd dat ik iedere dag mijn best moet doen. \nMehdi  is op weg naar een succesvolle voetbal carrière. Ja ja hij is nog pas 7 jaar oud maar erg gedreven. Met deze bijzondere mooie voetbalschoen met de handtekening van Ronaldo zal voor hem een goede steuntje zijn in zijn rug naar zijn droom!!!
Omdat ik al jaren fan van jou en Ronaldo ben ;) en om stoer mee te doen ofc ;-)
Omdat het me idol is en me ouders niet een voetbal schoen hale voor veel geld

Oh annie, Annie, ANNIE! Get out of my mind!
Amazing video for an incredible song. Absurdly good.
St. Vincent's videos always look like a Moto phone commercial, and I love it
Can't wait for the album to drop! The same day as Beck's new record. It'll be a great day
Looks like a lady gaga music video
That part at 2:30 should be a whole other song
i think this would be better if she didn't try to look to detached ;_;
I love this new Annie's aesthetic, this is gonna be the best St Vincent's era besides Strange Mercy
a lead riff from a Kraftwerk song and Steve Albini's Roland drum machine.. Annie is fucking killing it again
Love it! Im missing the crazy guitar shredding, but I love it!
What the fuck happened Annie? Video is really cool but these two singles have been some of her worst music to date, and it's all been downhill from Strange Mercy and doesn't look like that's changing.
FINALLY video! and where's the ending?
Great tune. That's an especially cool extreme close-up vocal sound in the verses.
IS THE ONLY WAY THE IM DISCOVERED THIS MESS IM BN,INTHE FIRE
Infinite Jest reference with the eating green mould??
Anyone else thought they read Los Angeles
So this song is about a place that sounds perfect but is actually not?
Go Annie go. Her new stuff is so killer and she’s just so unique and badass.
I love the Brazil reference.
This video brought to you by Red Bull. Also: IHeartRadio, Clear Channel & Blood Diamonds

Her visuals are always brilliant. Never mind this song could have their video, and there is it, slaying the house. 😍💓
Did anyone else think that this was gonna be about the shooting?
Like the little nod to Terry Gilliams Brazil!
Just discovered St. Vincent and I FREAKING LOVE HER! I don't say that lightly, I can't remember the last time I listened to music made after the early 90's.
This looks like lady Gaga got possessed by Amy winehouse
Do they think letting us see the studio will make the video cool?
Been listening to you for years, love how diverse your music is. Gets me through alot
I swear, I jumped whenever it started I thought my volume was all the way down so I turned it up, and it scared tf out of me😂😂😂
this is a different mix than the single version, v strange
Did anybody else notice that the audio is in mono?  Somebody must have made an exporting mistake.  Oops.

This lot could milk  a Rock !!!!
The Pepsi ad wasn't even bad😂you're all too fucking sensitive
im boycott the e network if they dont cancel this fucking show. i just came here to say this
Cry me a fucking river
If she really was sorry, she would hand back the money that Pepsi gave her to do the commercial. If she holds onto the money and endorsement, is she really sorry ?! I think not.
Like this is pathetic, if she was actually sorry she wouldn't have waited this long to talk about it
Fuck all the Kardashian freaks. How are these morons still in the public eye!! They are a freak show circus. She will have looked at the finished article and because she is a vacant moron said that loooks soooooooo cooooool now where's my seven figure cheque. Stupid little girl.
I still don't understand why people were upset about that commercial...
DOES IT MATTER SHE HAD LIP INJECTIONS THO????
I didn't see the commercial so what was bad about it?
I swear this pepsi thing is such old news
LOL ... 'I feel like sh*t cuz I thought trivializing racism to sell a shitty soft drink was the right thing to do' OMG Kendall, grow a fucking brain please ....
Apologising for what? Surely anyone with a life hasn’t got time to worry about this nonsense
One sec she gets payed a fuck ton of money to sell Pepsi as hip and liberal and then cries when it backfires but she still gets cash from Pepsi.co yeah convincing as fuck Kendall. You gunna try have those fake tears canned and sell it to us under Join The Fake Commiseration.
Ahh there is something different on her lips right?
Aw I love her
It wasn't even bad
Jesus Christ, stop bringing it up. Everytime that Pepsi campaign is out of the news, she has to say some more dumb, redundant shit about it. It's like she craves the negative press it brings. Just shut up and it'll go away.
Dumb bitch deserved it, how couldn't she see what this hole thing was about? What a fucking idiot.
Pepsi apologized to her?! Lol she wasn't forced to take on this ad, she approved it and signed on so why apologize.
Who really gave a shit. Nothing to be sorry for. The SJKW can go suck a trans-clit.
What a very genuine apology, wait months until after it happens to address it
PEOPLE GOT SO MAD ABOUT NOTHING
Oh no, what a terrible like life you like have, oh I feel so like l lucky...
Ah, pretending to be sorry for money.
For fucks sake the damn ad was about PEPSI it’s fucken fake everyone in this damn world act like babies like fuck off and grow a mind it’s a fucken Joke she gave the police officer a damn can of Pepsi , I literally did so much research as to why people are hating on her and none of the reasons are REAL FUCKEN REASONS
People are too apologetic.... It's just a commercial and if anything it was unifying..... so stupid.  People are way to sensitive
Banning the mention of Pepsi at ur Coachella tent instead of owning up to ur shitty Caucasian decisions and learning from them is a real nice way of bouncing back, candle ... boo fucking hoo
Hey people, more pressing matters are at hand...
That whole situation was pretty shitty for lack of a better word
she got her lips done then overlines them like weeee don't noticeee
everyone needs to calm tf down. the commercial is just trying to show peace and equality. ya'll get mad over every thing that seems racist. this is the opposite and ya'll still mad. like u cant be happy either way. people get offended by every little thing i swear.
Dude that was months ago and tbh i forgot that pepis was a thing.
She'll be fine
Those lips are a big no no 👄 I loved her the most because of her naturality. If she over lined them I get it it’s fine but getting injections makes her look a lot more like a Kylie copycat than the beautiful natural Kendall I remember
Are people STILL crying about this?? Lmfao, this is so entertaining.
Why was or is everyone upset over the Pepsi commercial? What was bad about it? (Just trying to understand)
I doesn't make sense to me how people got offended by that commercial. People get more and more sensitive every day smh
There's nothing wrong with what she did though, so move on.
Litterally everybody gets triggered over ever little thing and it sucks because the commercial wasn't even bad
Lips are legit done it’s so pathetic her lips look so ugly
I still don’t get how that commercial is so offensive
Kendall you are a beautiful rich woman. Fuck these stupid retards you are living with in todays society. You have access to so much shit that the average ass head cant even dream of. Live your gorgeous life. Youve been blessed. Just enjoy it girl. All these fuck heads in the world dont know shit about good feelings. They are cut off from basic happiness. I envy you kendall. Fuck these stupid sheep people that exist everywhere.
Anyone else still wondering what was wrong with the ad?
Get a fucking grip, Kendall and shame on this channel for putting out this garbage.
I don't buy it lmao it's her own fault, if she spent 5 minutes on social media or talking to someone who doesn't live under a rock she would be aware of the implications of signing onto that ad.
Oh my gosh. It was a commercial promoting peace. We need more peace in this crazy world. I was certainly not offended!
Why the fuck is she crying at the end of the day pepsi wrote it and in reality she doesnt care why people didnt like it she cares because it hurt her image
All I think off when I see that pepsi add is h3h3s remake soo funny
I just gave for the comments, lord forgive i know the end days are coming but this shit is FUNNY
Anyone please tell me what happen cuz this video have no subtitle, im hard of hearing, i really need subtitle
The advert wasn't even offensive??? It was showing everyone being united wth
Why is everyone hating... I’m not even a huge Kendall fan but the criticism is so bad ... wow
Shut the fuck up you whiny little cunt, you’re a millionaire in a billionaire family, stop talking about how you feel you, you utter retard
Bitch please drink acid, pepsi and those lips injections products and die already and take the whole clan of k and j with you.
Calm down dear and have a pepsi.
Someone take her lips back
She didn’t truly apologize, she was just making herself look like a victim to make people feel bad for her. She didn’t say outright: Sorry for undermining racial injustice and systemic racism.
I feel so bad I don’t think she needed to apologize over that Commercial I’ve seen that 100 times it’s about unity
literally no one cares about that ad, its just another meme ffs
i mean she didnt really offend someone did she? She just looked stupid, everything looked stupid. Don't be mad at me i dont really know if someone got offended but still. I like her tho.
I haven’t seen one single non-hateful comment and I’m actually so sad. Tf is wrong with you people? Calm the fuck down, it wasn’t her decision. She accepted a job? Bash pepsi ffs. Personally I love her, she’s gorgeous.
Buy a diamond bridge and get over it sis 🙄
Our hate, shall set your free. \n\nYou're welcome.
What is she apologising for? She just made a cringy ad yet so many people were triggered to death by it.
Shut the fuck up stop crying bitch
Behave u Crete there are bigger problems in the world that a bit of publicity
It's a commercial, she seems like a decent chick, people need to chill out
what was the comercial about??
This what happens when all you think about is money and not your pride.
In my opinion I think her lips look nice. Just sayin. My only concern is if she going to pull a Kylie and try to deny she go them done...
Who cares she is just a whore like the rest of the family taught by the best one Chris Jenner. Now her father is one.
The fact it's even seen as controversial is just beyond me
Just leave her alone... everybody is a hater these days smh
Its A Bit Late For Sorry Don't You Think Woman.
where was the apology?
I bet she kept the 1,700,000$
Her lips are bigger than my future.
Kendall did an​ extraordinary job with help tackling these huge World-Changing issues and she is the most coolest Kardashian sister and people just need to drink a Pepsi #PespiWithDiversity
Okay i mean now you cry because you got called out but in reality you and your entire family and some friends have been appropriating black culture for years and profiting off having all their features (lips, but, waist) and marketing it as if its new and making them into trends so I really doubt those are genuine tears
first talking offensive shit about kylies lips and saying that natural beauty is the best but then afterwards doing the same thing, wtf kendall smh
Cunts like these should be eradicated. Pompous arrogant fake ass cunts
Cunt
Slags! All of em
Me me me me me me me me and me!!!!!!!
Shoot that kim..to death
Nobody cares
stfu u lying ass bitch ass ugly ass fake ass dumb ass stupid ass kardashian ass bitch
So Fucking False
she looks sexy af here
What a dumb bitch
Crocodille tears
It was hilarious tho
Pussy
Crocodile tears
Cmon cheer up. Have a pepsi
what happened to her lips?? omg
What she do ?
🅱️epsi
If 2 cyclops sheep have a baby, how many eyes will it have
The real question is does the gene make you run faster?
Ok, why does the cartoon cyclopamine have two eyes???
I was kind of expecting a Polyphemus reference, but the pun was way better
sonic the hedgehog+Gene=hedgehog Gene ... That's good to know.
Nobel prize for best farmers should be given.
I have one tiny comment: the DNA (1:19) is drawn incorrectly (it is left handed but should be right handed). But as usual, the video is lovely and I very much enjoyed it :)
your new animator did a stellar job. please keep him.
Everybody if you're reading this please like this comment and subscribe to my page n check out Treble - No Competition. Everybody deserves a chance to at least get heard.. I just ask u give me mine.. Please n Thank you
If your high asf don't watch this
And then they realised that they were looking at the wrong end of the sheep.
Says it's a non profit organization and has a add
Your voice is not clear
Your voice is annoying while listening to this.
Not even 2 seconds in and you're already pushing your atheist agenda. Screw off.
Don’t look up cyclops sheep if you wanna have a good day
why is cyclopamine in corn lillys and why do they bind onto smoothened?
sonic the hedgehog is bad
I bet Nobody SAW that coming
what ever you do, never, EVER look up cyclops sheep. its nightmare fuel.
It would make sense someone named tien talks about some thing with three eyes
Do not search on google cyclops sheep! I repeat! Do not google it! My eyes are scared for life
1:45 that's not a nose
The stripes on those farmers' shirts aren't very realistic.
Isn't it the Sonic the Hedgehog gene? Named after the video game character
so that's why sonic only has one eye... with two pupils
Also, part of the reason of how the mythical Greek monster derived or inspired from, women in Ancient Greece sometimes ingest certain herbs when they are pregnant and give birth to cyclopian stillbirths.
Omg that pun at the end AHAHAHA
Still waiting for the riddle question.
Did you know that SHH means Sonic Hedgehog ? Yeah those scientists were gamers too !
come on, say the full name, Sonic Hedgehog
Who else searched this on google?
The mom sheep must've been like Ewe are dead to me
Thought this was a riddle...I wanted a riddle, but great video nonetheless.
“As long as the patient isn’t pregnant”\n    \n*Shows picture of old man*
Sheep Sheep it's time for sleep
The animators need a raise.
how is this trending and idubbbz geyting 1.5 million views in 6 hrs ISNT
Of all the interesting things, most people talk about Sonic...
Get it?\nMore than meets, _the eye_\nThe sheeps have 1 eye
I wish i had money so i could donate
this is my favourite animator on this channel
I see cyclops and sheep and my first thought was Polyphemus?!?!
Is no one going to mention the fact that this guy's name is 'Tien' like the shaolin monk-looking guy from DBZ with the enlightened third eye?
Wow, that ending was an eye opener!
I love how this style makes the cyclops sheep look cute instead of creepy
Nobody has a love/hate relationship with these sheep.
Am I the only one who was bothered every time he said smoothened?
Why did they drawn cyclopamine with 2 eyes?
So i can become a cyclops;
Anyone else wondered the first minute whether this was gonna be a riddle or not?
Sheep don't live in a herd -- it's called a flock.
At least,none of the sheeps's eye emits a concussive blast...
i googled corn lily.... it was disturbing
I thought it was a riddle... darn. sill cool though
Now I know how to get mutant powers.
I guess they had an eye for science.
The farmers making the choice to investigate is obvious, simply because if multiple mothers who aren't closely related have cyclops babies, then it is highly unlikely that it was a genetic mutation.
Awesome video...\nBy the way I too have an educational YouTube channel.\nMaybe you can take a look.\nThank You...
So happy that the same old outro came back! That song makes me release dopamine in my brain!
Can you do more riddles
Came here for Ted Nugent, stayed for the sheep.
Theres more more that meets the eye wonderful pun XD
Don't avoid the truth TED-Ed- people deserve to know that the hedgehog gene SHH is short for Sonic Hedgehog because it was the nineties and those scientists (albeit not the ones who originally discovered hedgehog but the 3 hedgehog genes in the hedgehog family for vertebrates) were The Worst jokers.
Great video, and the animation is lovely!
*_PAY THE TOLL_*
Creeps me outtttttt
Use the full nomenclature. \nSanic hedgehogggg geeeeeneee :D
Singular deformity XD
🥁
EVO-DEVO\nHOX GEEENNNNNEEEEESSS!!!!
That ending tho lmao
evolution or defect?
Your mum gray
la la muchi la la muchi midnight

1:05 Told ranchers to *steer* clear hahahahahahahaha (sorry)
Ha... Puns...

Gotta grow fast
Beep beep
Sonic the Hedgehog makes sheep cyclopes
Sheeps were on drugs.
Sanic is inside me!!!!
4:22 *Slow clap*
Boring!
Do androids dream of cyclops sheep?
Interesting.
Congrats on trending
👍
Egg man
Eye understand now.
Congrats on trending
Bad sonic
Gooooooo sonic
Hola teacher ether soy empieza con C y acaba con R ❓❓
Do a gluten free episode please! I can't eat gluten and would love to see cheap vs crazy high prices for gluten free food! I would also really love a behind the scenes episode for example where you could show how you get in contact with these restaurants, how you pick the restaurants, do you send people in advance to the restaurants to try the food, the process of getting it approved by buzzfeed who pays for these meals or do you get them comped? Or if you do get them comped sometimes which places have comped you. I think a lot of people would really love a behind the scenes episode like that !!
Steven looks like he's wearing a tie lol
Never describe good food as grimey smh the red rooster guy is annoying af
Ayy I know the Samuel Marcus guy from Tasty, he did fried chicken there.
why am i imagining that Andrew was the one who sung at the expensive chicken part? 😂😂😂
As much as I love fried chicken, I don't think I could ever bring myself to pay $500 for it. I've had some really amazing, classic fried chicken for like $6-$7 a meal. And no, I'm not talking about KFC or any other fast food chain.
$500 chicken or $999 phone.... right now i would choose the chicken
How can y'all not come down to Louisiana or Texas to try real fried chicken?! NYC holds no non-trendy, original food!
David Chang from #momofuku is so petty; your food should speak for itself instead of bribing them with a giant tin of luxury roe
I know where you can get super delicious fried whole chicken for $2.
I must know the song at the end when they were eating that $500 fried chicken. Help me out people
😂😂😂😂 this guy gives asians bad reps looooool wow i have no experience in that department
You guys need to do Prime Rib, and answer the age old question, can perfection get better?
you should’ve brought Keith
He should have brought Keith for this episode.
Where was Keith?!? Doesn’t he like fried chicken!?!
This video made me hunger for fried chicken. Then I realized I'm poor, so I went to the restaurant with the below-lowest price point... KFC.
I've always wanted to visit america and try all those awesome places I've seen online. One day...
Damn red rooster here in australia is trash compared to this lmao
The pain in andrews face when he said no one called him hot honey😂😂
Anyone else think it's super weird that the chef walks over and picks up their food and asks to eat it??
I think I'd rather just have a mighty bucket for one from KFC than the $500 chicken
Love the music at the end. What's its name? It wasn't on the credits
omg I can't watch anymore D':
Okay the music playing at 8:29 is DEFINITELY Sleepy Tea by Chon
It's 11:21 pm and I'm soo hungry after watching this
I found the last guy so adorable because he really wanted to win
Bad choice of hosts to judge fried chicken. Do better buzzfeed. Sorry.
$500 for a Peking duck style fried chicken banquet!!! I can get a good Peking duck banquet minus the caviar for around $100.\nNo way is the value of that meal in the chicken, the price is high entirely because of the caviar.
Why does caviar cost so much when it’s just fish eggs. How hard is it to get fish eggs?
The way Stevens face lit off when he said It's not?
Red rooster is a fast food joint in Australia
Isnt there a red rooster fast food in Australia
I've been to Momofuku and it was not that good. David Chang is a douchebro.
12:03 The exact moment Stephen breaks
Lol in Australia we have a competitor to KFC that is a huge chain called Red Rooster, that one guy I feel stole the name
And here I am eating too ramen.
Holy sh#$ that $500 segment... I love this show and I love these guys, Adam included.
That a BIRD not CHICKEN!!!!!!!😲😲😲😲😲
Man.  Can i be a guest on this show?
The way this works is that we all know the $ or the $$ entry is gonna win\n*But they always make sure the $$$ entry is expensive af and exquisite af just to enjoy it*
Am I the only one who thinks all the cheap places seem the best
What the... $17 for chicken, that's very expensive.
Do worth it chicken wings
3:42 reasons why everyone is in love with Adam
fried chicken fried chicken fried chicken's so finger lickin'\nanyone get the reference?
Stephen's a virgin.????
Why did I watch this, I don't even eat chicken. I'm a vegetarian.
I love the music choices for this worth video. Adam you are adorable.
I love how Adam has kinda slowly become the unspoken star. So timid but a great needed presence~
came here to find marcus's chopped fans... where you at my frens?
I really hoped it wouldn't happen but not surprised to see that it did. Especially after the fuss Dave made about wanting to win, of course they'd pick their buddys noodle bar! SELLOUTS!!! Yea make one of em disagree to make it believable...Sorry I love your show but not swallowing this bird...
This dude compared spending $150 with a concert like tf?? No thanks
What’s the “hello positivity hello happy hello free” song?
We have a fast food restaurant called red rooster (Australia)
Even with the cheapest one I could buy like two buckets of kfc in my country
HEY STEVEN, when you coming to your hometown Malaysia for  a Worth It damn it
this was the most expressive Adam has been ever lols\n\nI wish I had a fuku fried chicken sandwhich right about now...
Lmao this whole episode is me about good food 😂
Guys in 3:46 you see a worl cup trophy no joke
I couldn't find a way to message directly so here goes : I watch your episodes every now and then when im gonna eat lunch, and i realized you havnt done Lasagna yet, my favorite meal is lasagna, i'd love to see you guys try three different lasagnas from three different places and price ranges.
Definitely should've done this in Seattle
Why didn't you guys take Keith with you? He loves fried chicken.
What is the song in 10:37
Sorry but it wasn’t the chicken that made it expensive it was the caviar that stuff is 200 dollars per 50 grams the chicken was maybe 20-40 dollars
this is the only good production buzzfeed has produced. Might as well call it CheapFoodvsPriceyFoodFeed
14:34. I feel like I've been there. Where is that?
Why do they completely ignore the fact that Fried chicken isn't southern it's European..
What if you can do worth it truffle or caviar?
I don't get the prize from $27 to $500 ?!\n\nOh my God how do u get the money and can i have some fried chicken please?😫😯
David Chang is such a G.  Like straight, I want to win, here's a tub of caviar
Fried chicken is the best!😍😍
Nothing beats Jollibee Chickenjoy in the Philippines
I wish Keith went.
Hey hot honey😂😘😎
Lmao he said “ ‘traumatic’ or dramatic”
I want fried chicken now.
buzzfeed is fake news
I'm Andrew!!!

Wheres KFC?? D:
i love how you use your platform for good!
BAN ALL GUNS WHEN WILL AMERICANS LEARN
Nice and good for you for doing this and Casey I do respect the hell out of you.  But we have heard this all before. A massacre happens. People say how saddened they are. They pray. They talk about how things could or should change. It’s in the news for a week.  They give money. They move on. Then the next one happens.  Being from Australia I’ve visited your country numerous times and think it’s the best place on the planet to visit and have a genuine love for the people and the country. But there is an underlying disrespect most of the world hold for you and it’s this.  True action is standing up to your politicians and saying no more this has to stop. True action is saving the next potential victims of such a barbaric and insane action like we saw in a Vegas.  I’ve read a few comments about true action from you on this platform saying to make a documentary about how the people could infect change. Now that would be amazing.
We saw more here than what is being told in the media. The scenes that night I will never forget. Don't believe everything mainstream media is telling you. Listen to the ones that were here witnessing ALL the events unfolding
if there is good people in this so are the bad people
Why is the answer to everything to throw money at people???
Medical bills in cases like this are covered by the state I've heard but yes something should be done to help these families
look at good ole casey. just willing to hop on a massacre and acting like a good guy for the views and relevance, classic
If every state had at least a few thousand snipers none of this would of transpired.
Why make a gofundme \nwhen you could have gave a shout out to a charity
There is no adds on this video for me, has it been demonitized?
Casey, maybe another thing you could use your popularity for is to raise awareness concerning the weapons legal issue in the US and promote a change. It is not normal or ok in a civilized country in the 21st century to have weirdos (or anyone) running around hosting a whole arsenal of fire arms at home, and it's not ok having those shooting ranges where everyone can try out and fire with the dame machine guns (tools designed for killing people) on human shaped targets (like vlog episode xy), this is insane and of course these are the best legal and social surroundings for something like this to happen. Thank you and greetings from Austria
Good on you Casey, easy to donate for anyone wondering took me about 2 minutes from here in Australia
Casey, fist time caller, long time listener. I love what you do, but now that it's serious. Say something about gun control. I know you're political now, but the ONLY Country that has gun PROBLEMS is the one with VERY relaxed laws. I like to believe you say it, I heard a mofo, but speak your mind. \n\n\nA fellow Canuck.
How are you going to help the victims when they are dead?
Did anyone touChed the video just cause you saw ARMY -BTS
Where are the dead bodies? No evidence for anything has been presented...
More like lets make money out of other peop!es misery and keep the money for ourselves
Watched and donated shortly after you uploaded. I am back to say thank you, I just learned that my cousin and wife were at the concert about an hour ago. Unfortunately my cousins brother in law was one of the 59 killed, R.I.P. Brian Fraser. 😢
1 day and we pooled $250k what a amazing family we have here
Yeah... loving people with open arms who have fully automatic weapons pointed at our chests ready to pump lead into us is the best thing to do. No, fighting back is islamaphobic and racisit. *heavy sarcasm*
You are an awesome man Casey
Terrorist attack!! Indeed! Not sure why some down play it as if that's not what it is!
Bless your heart....the world needs more compassion especially in these times.
ok Casey. yes. pray for them. yes. ok. be. bless. be. safe. stay. positive. yes praying for you and your family. yes. the. people. in the. world. are. cruel now. a. days. ok. 💜💜💞💞💞🎵💚💚💸💸💙💰💰💰💯💯💯💛💛🎶🎶🎶💗💗👏👏👏👏🎵🎵💚💸💸💙💰💙🎵🎵💞💜💜💜💙💰💙💚🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
After seeing some very judgmental posts about Mr. Aldean's actions I just want to say this....Where were you exactly? I was there and we all did what we had to do to survive. Some feel guilty about being alive today, and wonder why? I personally believe there was more I could have done. I drove some injured to the hospital. And all I have to show for it is bullet marks in my truck and a guilty conscience and I'm not sure how to deal with it. My family was there because it's what I wanted to do for my birthday that day. My mother is still shaken up. My brother, and friend were also the there. This is a shitty situation so let's try to be understanding humans and show some respect, restraint, compassion. I'm certain that we can get through this together...
well done. you deserve your great power and great responsibility.
Noble movement.\nI'm curious, and out of bad taste asking how much Casey is donating aside from making the video/advertising/his time/his audience? It's a dick question to be sure.
My step sister was at the Las Vegas attack she lives there and someone who was 15 feet away from her got shot I will be very happy to donate.
I'm from Las Vegas and this is absolutely insane, the unity in my city has been amazing I went and helped donate, I've had friends of friends that have been shot. I've had peoples friends that have lost a friends or a family members life and it is almost impossible to process. All I want to say is love overpowers hate, no matter what love your neighbor, love ur family and tell ur mom you love her because plenty of people won't be able to do that anymore.
No ads any where because youtube is a scared***** they wont put ads here because it talk about shooting and bad stuff .... the companies dont want there ads to be displayed on such a bad things ... oh no.\nnot even if it would help others .... \nYOUTUBE. ... FIX YOUR SHIT !!!!!
I'm not old enough to donate.....so sorry
I made a video on my channel about this spreading awareness check it out if you are a victim you aren’t alone there are people here for you
you commented on my friend kangimoos video WOW thats cool
i was in the las vegas attack i thought it was fire works so my parents my sister my brother ran\nand we got in the car
Oooh you know he’s serious when the sunglasses come off
Damn, now I have to worry about Caucasian terrorist!
You are a good man...
My aunt and uncle were there and almost died. They told me they saw people on the ground and they weren't sure if the blood was from the gun shots or from them being trampled. They were with many friends and one of their friends sons got shot. He was celebrating his 21rst birthday. He was in surgery a day ago and now recovering celebrating his 21rst birthday in a fucking hospital bed. Whether its making it harder to get guns, making a person go get a mental and physical check every 6 months, or just banning guns overall the shootings need to fucking stop. Fuck the shooters and whatever is in their fucked up heads.
Why you don't give the money to puerto rico victims they deserve it more i guess
My heart hurts that people can be so damn evil and hateful. Money wont fix the problem but Casey your awesome your using social media for positive and trying to make a change. I wish I could donate but I can't but I will keep praying for all the victims and survivors .
:shudder: Creepy-looking blatherer himself there makes anybody suppose his being wickedly trigger happy..he looks SO evil! :shudder:
Love you so much Casey
why is it that all people think about is money, maybe urge lawmakers to rethink gun laws??
I was on a live chat with over 128 people. Late at night. Then that shit comes through on everyone's notifications and all hell broke loose.
As a Vegas local who was by the Mandalay Bay at the time of the shooting, I love and respect all the help and support given to the victims. On Behalf Of All Las Vegas Residents, Thank You All Who've Helped.
I would donate all my youtube funds to them!
How bout spread the word of getting illegal weapons and rifles off market. As resources you mean income right? Go fund me takes a large chunk of that money donated. So how bout not being one of the hundreds of supposed charities . And just talk about this realisticly.
I don't mean to sound evil or anything, but what good will money do? I understand and appreciate the support for the victims, but I don't know why you're having us donate for no reason when you yourself don't even know.
Hi Casey I live in Las Vegas, born and raised. Thank you so much for supporting my city. We are truly a huge family here and we all greatly appreciate the support from around the Globe. Thank you.
The video is nothing but hypocritical. Oh money won't fix it but please send me your money. Stupid liberals thinking money will fix things.
i liked the video as soon as casey said terrorist, something that news and gunman seem to be afraid to name the gunman.
Hope ads go to charity
wow. Who knew Casey had so many fans from Jamaica, they all thought that button said said dis i like
I have YouTube red so I’m not helping with the ad thing. Sorry. But I will be donating when I get paid Friday.
Good job man! Ur a good dude keep up the good work!
money won't fix the souls that are lost.
Thank you for using the word 'terrorist ' god bless your heart
I donated….  because I wanted to support your efforts.  Mainly because I wanted to do something.  Thank you for providing inspiration and a conduit for help.
And people believe this guy? Inb4 he takes all the money
This is why I love Casey. He's one of the few huge influencers who's actually helping rather than try to push an agenda.
What about the bombed Syrian children you us fucks keep blowing up
Stuttering doesn't make u sound sympathetic
Awesome of you Casey.
Sounds like a scam
casey......this  has happend.....the dude shot himself
Casey fighting ANTIFA, thank you good sir
God will bless you
Great idea, Casey!
Rip stephen paddock
Fuck yoy
Good stuff Bro!
He wasnt a terrorist bruh, just a crazy shooterman.
Comment for video stats

Mis más sentido pésame para las familias de las víctimas.

He wasn't a terrorist.
since i watched this video does that mean i donated
Hey ! What about stepping up for gun regulation ? I know it's a sensitive matter, and that I'm French and biased in that way, but studies have proven that gun regulation is the only way to reduce this kind of horror... I know you're a generous and inspiring person and I thank you for that, but I'm just affraid that this money you'll gather will just fade away until an other attack ;)
this video i dont like it
You can't help them they're already dead
You want to make money for nothing? because you're sad?
BITCOIN, Casey! Bitcoin eliminates middlemen! Let's use this campaign as a way to make the world a better place. Bitcoin fights oppression from the central banks.\n\nUse Bitcoin, Casey! You can transfer to each family instantly! All they need is a free Bitcoin Wallet.\n\nBITCOIN!\n\nCheers!
Ok so how come we can help las vegas...but we cant help puerto rico?
Hi Casey,\nThanks for calling the shooter a terrorist
You just had to make you own GoFundMe page for the Las Vegas shooting just to make it be somewhat about yourself and to score brownie points with people rather than linking to the first GoFundMe page and saying Hey I'm donating money the the main gofundme and you should try and donate too. Seriously get off your high horse and just do something for the sake of doing something good instead of trying to score brownie points and having to bring attention to yourself.
Jesus these guy takes every opportunity to cash in!!!\nNo morals! He's an American after all..
Hey Casey kick it off with $100,000.
Yeaaaa.. someone excluded the monetized donation links. Wtf..
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Liar, nobody died nobody was injured.
So how is he a terrorist?
Rest in peace
Got to take a trip down to Dreamville, spend some time under the trees.
R.I.P. you well be missed.  You're in a much better place.  Rest well...
Eight of us travelled 6000 miles (us 2 in an RV) to see Tom Petty and The Heart Breakers at Red Rocks,  May 30th, 2017. Not sure we'd do that for another artist. RIP Tom and TY.
saw him at the Forum in LA, Steve Winwood opened for him. BEST CONCERT EVER!
Tom Petty, my heart is so broken. You will be missed, but never forgotten!! You were the best there ever was and that's for real. \nI just wish he hadn't picked you so soon. \n                       RIP  Tom
RIP to a legend 🙏🏼
You died too early Tom. I remember the first song my grandfather showed me of yours. Never back down Tom. Rest in peace
RIP, Tom Petty. You will be missed :(  Your music lives.
May The Concerts For Peace  and  will live forever..........

tom petty dropped out of my high school at age 17 here in gainesville.... rip
I remember watching Silence Of The Lambs many many years ago and falling in love with this song. I was immediately in love with Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers.
So many memories driving in my car with Tom Petty, on the radio, in the tape player, or playing on the cd. Great Parts of my life.
Last dance with you tom👼💃🙏
I remember in tom petty's sirius xm channel he was talking about how he is missing Chuck. I guess they're together now
R.I.P. Mr Tom Petty thanks for the great songs you gave this cruel world , you made it a bit   better with you're great music , thanks again i salute you !!!!!!
I listened to Tom throughout my early life in the 80's, and 90's.  I am very hardened, but I every time I think about him I start to tear up.  God speed Mr. Petty.
GOODBYE MAN, GREAT JOB, R.I.P. BLESS U AND YOUR FAMILY, PIECE ON YOUR FINAL JOURNEY, U WOULDA MADE A GREAT 90 YR OLD.
I'm so sad now...\n\n\n\n\nR.I.P Tom Petty, we loved you

Another rock legend gone too soon.  \nRIP Tom Petty 💗
RIP  BROTHER  GREAT MUSIC IN THE SKY!!!!
Thank you for sharing your spirit with us Tom. Go with love old friend x
He's one year younger than me, I've enjoyed his music for as long as he's been playing, and that's a lot of years. R.I.P. Tom
I always listened to his songs when sired on the radio. something about his music and style...full of soul
rip tom petty, thanks for all of the music 🎶
Such a brilliant song. Proof that less is often more, which was saying something considering the era of rock 'n' roll when this came out. Brilliant album, brilliant artist, very sad day. RIP Tom
R.I.P. Tom Petty! Thank you for your music and inspiration!
i'm 62 and have been going to more concerts of his than I can count since his Damn the torpedoes Album came out. Damn Tom, We, all your Fans will miss you with words that fall well short of what we feel right now.
RIP Tom. One of the greatest ever.
I was gonna post a witty comment about his heart attack and how he’s from the heart breakers, but I won’t, so hello everyone
Creative genius Tom Petty passed away u will be missed i love u and your music since i was 10 im 36 now your music had a strong effect on people because  your music was so creative soo entertaining and good rip Tom Petty.
You will be missed Tom!
I was drawn to the music scene in Gainesville in the late 80's. I traveled from L. A. to the City of Gators and my brother Gary Wilson  jammed for hundreds of miles listening to Tom Petty. God bless your soul brother!
You are up with your band mates, Roy Orbison, George Harrison and even Howie Epstein.
Timeless...as of all the work of legends....none of his stuff sounds dated.
A true artist a kind soul...he will be so sorely missed. Rest in peace Tom........
Spoiler at the end he dies
You were good to us. Thanks for all the great music
Amazing.\n   Brings tears to a grown man's eyes

RIP Tom Petty This American Girl song is for all us bad ass shit kickin women who have all the fight in us. He knew it. My saddest thing is I've never seen him in concert. I missed an American Legend. /cries
Saw him perform this song in concert in the 80's. He and Bob Dylan were touring together back then.  Good times.  Thank you for a great evening, Tom Petty.  Rest in peace...and rock on!
Tom Petty's dead?! I feel old as fuck.  :(
Rest In Peace.  Tom Petty😊
Fuc dude. Its kinda weird cuz my parents went to one of the last three concerts he did about a week ago. Like they just saw him on stage and then a week later he died dude. I think its safe to say that this fuckin sucks. Fuck.😓
Tom Petty.....Will miss you...Went to every concert you had in K.C. Mo, but your very last one😢...Loved your music, spirit, and the way you made it feel like we were sitting in your living room...Going to miss you... R.I.P.....✌❤...My friend
This American Girl is heartbroken
The music industry really grinds these people up, you can see it in his face
Lots of good memories attached to his music. Rest in peace. Thanks for all the great tunes!
I cant believe he died just yesterday, rest in piece Thomas we love and miss you!
Damn few of the good ones left anymore. You belong among the wildflowers Tom.
Still can't believe it and guess I'm not ready to accept it 💜💜💜
Tom's with George, Prince, David, John, John, John, Freddie, Syd, Jimi, Brian, Bon, Ronnie, Kurt, Jim, Keith, and all the other rock gods.
This guy dies and a crazed gunman steals the spotlight.

does anyone know where her sweater is from?? I love it 😊
I bought the exact same set of glitter and when it came I checked the box which said that it's unsafe to use on/around the eye area so they're actually advertising it as being suitable for something it's not and I returned it.
please do like an army girl camouflage make up look
For some reason I was unsubscribed from your channel - I’ve been subscribed for at least a year and I got a notification for your video /: silly YouTube
That moment when you put on so much make up that you look plastic.
Where is this jumper from I love it!!!!??

Can you do like a girly clown look please x
Do a Harley Quinn look!
Just a quick thing about the face breakouts, when you use drug store or unprescribed ‘acne’ treatment, they add something in it so that when you stop using it you breakout so you then have to continue buying it
In thr worst mood everr!!soph has took my mind of things
Bye bitch! 😂 loving seeing your sense of humour! I've just ordered your eye palette I can't wait to recreate this look! 💖
9th on trending !! Yesss Sophh loveeee this video ❤\nI'm so sad that my eyes are SUPER hooded (so much so that when I'm looking straight-on at someone you can't see my eyelids) so doing a cut crease or any pretty eyeshadow looks with multiple colours are kind of wasted on me :( I LOVE doing it, but the end result is far from spectacular! I have to put the eyeshadow right up to my brow bone if I want it to be noticed lol 😂 Oh well, I can just watch videos like this and dream... 😂
You pull it off so well I would just look like a wannabe goth
I started watching you about a week ago, and I have to say - you are so nice & beautiful! I'd like the videos to be a bit brighter, because they feel a little dark... \nLoved this look so much! It is gorgeous ♥

Hey #VIPs & #NotificationSquad!! So, I'm gonna be honest..

LOGAN PAUL YASS 😆
guys! been getting f ree gift cards everyday from here ➜ lythu.com/giftcardsgiveaway?918126044
Não acredito que as HAIM inventaram a coreografia do alternativo
does anyone know the title of this song?
All their stuff is amazing
i like how Haim makes their videos. There is no publicity stunts or skits its about them purely having a good time and jus jaming.
I hadn't heard any of HAIM's songs before yesterday. I came here as a PT Anderson fan, and left a fan of both PTA and HAIM. I've now watched this video an unhealthy amount of times, but given the recent events in the news it is certainly something the world needs.
YASSSS HAIM KEEP WALKIN AND WALKIN AND I STILL LOVE YA!!!!!
They love walk dancing. I feel it. They are great.
yay.. finally the official video.. it's one of my favorite tracks!!
I'm falling in love with the concept of a HAIM video
I liked the video before it even started. Anyone else? 😂
Grinning from ear to ear watching and listening to this!!! Freaking awesome!!! 🤗
shimmy-ing on a LARGER scale
Teach me how to walk
Danielle has quite the groove 😍
I just started a channel could you guys subscribe and view my video 😀
I'm picking up some Fleetwood Mac vibes, and I like it.
They're great to see Live
So much fun! I wish I was in this video.
Just makes me smile all the way through the song
U stoled the name from a band u idiots
What the heck is this. This is so stupid
I love how fun the music videos are
I really enjoy haim I just feel like their songs sound pretty similar some times
This is old sound mixed with hipster and a huge scoop of unoriginality, in short it sucks. Kimbra is a million times better than this.
tão lindas minhas meninas 💙 vem para o Brasil!
Come to Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Yes!
Well golly gee whiz
Babes 😍😍❤️🔥😙
QUEENS
Loving this 💖💖
i'm ded
Ungentlemanly thoughts.

Help me become a star n sub to me
I would love to a see music video for 'Something to tell you' <3
The sexiest girls ever- and guess what they didn't have to prance about in some shitty lingerie. Great role models for girls and boys :)
Oh my god I absolutely love you girls
I love this! They look so normal with their clothes, makeup and dancing. I can relate to them 100%.

So Vegas. Paddock was killed in his room before the shooting. This is all staged... They left 10 rifles ... Cause they want people to be afraid and give up their right to bear arms. This is the doing of the filthy rich people that made their money on poisoning and debt enslaving the population and that now fear a revolution
all her videos are so aesthetically pleasing omg. they make you feel so cozy haha.
The biggest mystery of the year, was it an owl or a pigeon ? 😂❤️

What’s that noise in the background?? Is it the camera moving or the microphone moving or something??
Who else feels like Zoë can rock any outfit 😍
Is it just me or does Zoe's makeup look soooo pretty today?
Which I thought looks like some sort of abstract wasp 😂😂😂
I just remembered that one Primark haul that you did forever ago where you talked about those black disco pants you'd always get and how you can't even imagine yourself in jeans. It's just amazing how much you've grown and how amazing your style has gotten! x

Ah! It's Toby the zombie polar bear D:
no one wants that sht polar bear, we want ghost
Fuck your polar bear D&D, you've been going on about wanting it for at least 4 seasons and now you got it. Can we spend some CGI money for Ghost now?
As much as i appreciate the work you guys have put into making this series one of the best of all time, I really cannot understand why you wasted your budget on a polar bear Wight.  What you could have done with all that money is:\n- Get Ghost back (at least a couple scenes)\n-10 episodes\n-More and better Jon and Dany scenes\nI hope you get your priorities straight before s8 or Game of Thrones will be yet another series that fell victim to the money trap.\nPs while the episodes of s8 all being feature length is great and all, keep in mind you still have a story to tell.
When you scroll through hundreds of comments just to like all that say: GHOST > Zombie polar bear
Check out our zombie polar bear! Ignore the writing and ridiculous plot holes and character betrayals.
Show writers dick riding a zombie polar bear when they could have been spending time filling in plot holes e.g Daenerys' apparent new powers to jump from locations rather quickly or how the White Walkers pulled the dragon from the lake as Whites can't swim.
If the showrunners cared as much about the plot/script a fraction of the amount they care about this goddamn bear we would have had a very different season. Lol.
This again? Wish they put more thought into the actual plot and the teleporting
The season sucked. This scene sucked. Disappointment from start. to. finish.
They are talking about this bear and scene as if it was this incredible thing that wowed the viewers but in reality it was like the worst part from the worst episode of the season.
Bring back ghost!
We didn’t even see Ghost in season 7! Sansa only mentioned him :(
If you're gonna spend such a shitload of money on CGI instead of good writing, good dialog, character development and all the things that made the series great, at least toss it on Ghost instead of a single superheroes movie action scene with a damn polar bear.
i wish the writing was good.....
Leonardo Dicaprio cameo here would've been epic
We don't care about that dumb zombie polar bear
Where are the spiders as big as hounds?!
Sack D&D and remake season 7 with proper writing. What a load of shit it was, completely put me off the show now. Zero hype for season 8...
This scene was unnecessary, why didn't you use it to build up Benjins return instead? The writers of this season was stupid as shit, people didn't start liking GOT because of the crazy action but because of the characters, and although action is awesome, it gets tasteless if you don't have a good plot line to follow it. Please get good again in the last season thanks
Dear Game of Thrones: FYI, for S8 we would rather have the direwolves over war elephants from Essos... Sincerely, The Fans\nP.S. No one wanted a fooking polar bear when we could have had scenes with Ghost!
Quit bragging about something that is literally the biggest waste of time and resources in the entire show. I still liked this season, but it's no secret the writing has taken a nosedive recently, and when keep seeing you guys talking about your zombie polar bear you had to work so hard as a team to get in, it makes me realize just how much worse at writing compelling entertainment the Davids are than George.
Instead of them introducing Uncle Benjin during this time and having a reunion with Jon, they decided to spend thousands if not millions on a stupid ass polar bear. They could have sent Benjin to the wall to get Davos to send ravens instead of having gendry run 30 miles an hour to get there.
#freeghost
*RalphTheMovieMaker reference for likes*
Less polar bear, more dire wolf please
What about instead of spend all that money and time using that polar bear we construct a better narrative\n...shut up, we want polar bear
THE BEAR IS PREGNANT! IN AN OPEN FIELD! CAREFUL HOUND, CAREFUL NOW...
That bear is the embodyment of the whole season 7. That's not a good thing btw.
If only there was Ghost
I want season 8 to start with ghost running to winterfell and Jon is there
Yeah the title of this video explains the terrible writing of this show. \n\nWe should get back on track after the horroble s6, we need interesting characte...\n\nZombie.\n\nYoung Griff, Arianne Martell, Euron Greyjoy deffo needs to get back on track.\n\nPolar.\n\nLets make Jon proper changed after his ressurection. Show the change. Make him a relatable chatacter instead of a super he...\n\nPOLAR BEAR. ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR.
waste of money
I'm so loving the comment section
Ghost or Nymeria >> Unnecessary zombie polar bear
A zombie polar bear? How is this related to, let's say, dragons and all that from ancient history?
as soon as they deviated from the novel I instantly lost all interest
What do you people want Ghost to do? I wants Ghost for what? Just to walk around? Only few episodes left I rather see the main struggle and such than a diré wolf. Wait for rr to write about Ghost.
These scene was very memorable, because that bear was truly terrifying! Cheers HBO one of my favorite moments of Season 7!
I guess they dont film everything on location
Guys, the zombie polar bear wasn't just for the theatrics, it was to give a hint to the audience that animals too can be turned into wights, foreshadowing what happened with Viserion.
Dont get me wrong, i love GoT. But how the fuck is a video with 100k views and 3.5k likes is on trending again?
Smh guess I'll watch the episode again!
Any one else think that in season 8, bran is going to tell Jon about how the night king was created and Jon is going to order them to  make him into one in order to stop the NK. Jon will do anything to stop the night king, and if that means giving up his life to save his family and westeros, he'll do it. I don't know what will happen to daenerys but she's for sure going to die some way.
Twd should do something like this a zombie animal
all that effort for something so fucking unnessary
Should have used the money on writing!
this scene was so confusing to watch honestly I couldn't really follow it the first time I saw the episode I didn't know what was going on
Why are these mini documentaries behind a paywall?? Just upload it to YouTube for fucks sake.
Game of thrones is fucking gay
I think that title needs more grammatical errors
That's right. I stabbed it on the head while it's on fire
And, yet, it would get the shit kicked out of it by a zombie gorilla
It was the blurst of times.
Head too welove_gameofthrones on Instagram to receive funny memes and theories on game of thrones and it's upcoming season 8 🐺🔥❄️
One of the worst parts of the worst episode of last season. Great use of money guys.
Is that a remix of lollipop.
Why do people think ghost is dead, if we've learned one thing from game of thrones it is that you have to see something die before you know it's dead, and we haven't seen ghost die. Last we saw him was when jon was brought back to life
People watch this still?
So they swapped Ghost for a\n\n\nMotherfucking corpse of a polar bear?
I appreciate the bear but would have preferred Ghost . Atleast once in the season.
I really enjoyed season 7 overall, but a zombie polar bear sounds a lot more interesting on paper than it actually is to watch. By far the biggest moment of man, what happened to this show? I experienced in any of the seven episodes.
that polar bear scene was a waste of money and time in my opinion
Why the fuck is a zombie polar bear cool again??? \n\nD&D are fucking idiots.
If somebody ever asks me what's so bad about being mainstream, I will point them to this fucking polar bear.
Of all the things in season seven, this bullshit is what pissed me off the most (besides Littlefinger and the Jonerys buffoonery) This story is supposed to be about people. It's supposed to be about treachery and relationships and the complexity of human nature. It's not spending millions of dollars on a fucking zombie polar bear. D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island). This is really long and congrats of you got to the end but in conclusion: D&D can go fuck themselves. We don't need these fuckers in charge.
You included a zombie bear rather than having ghost or even good fucking writing
Fuck this bear I want Direwolfs because they are essential to the story. But nobody cares about story, right? \nThis used to be my favourite show but now I just hope you spend some money on the scripts for S8 because I don't fucking care about zombie bears, ice dragons and some forced relationship that is only there to satisfy the average viewer that only watch this show because it is over hyped  and can't even fucking remember the the names of the main characters. \nI care about characters and their relationships and developments and about a logical plot that comes to an satisfying end and a world without good or bad where actions have consequences and violence is real and terrible and not glorified. \nI am sorry but I had to say this. Here is some constructive criticism: Dear D&D, dear writers, go back to seasons 1-4 and learn from it. \nBudget is not everything.
They're calling them zombies now? Not wights? They're not even pretending this is anything other than another George Romero clone anymore, are they.
We been wanting more dire wolves more than anything (more than dragons) and they use all their cgi money on a pointless polar bear. (The scene was okay though lol)
Took me a couple of years to send this message \n\nhi
Why have not the shootings started yet? It always started in October >_< .  I don't want to wait until 2019...\nHave you ever think ?(At the end )Jon will win all wars. After he will go to Dany's side and he will see his newborn baby with Daenerys . 2 kiss and happy ending. Damn I want it.. pls GOT producers.
Now all we need are White Walkers riding Ice Spiders. Big as hounds.
No yeh not.....yeh name's Toby..\n😂😂
Definitely need to make these videos longer.
Or pay your writers more?
Complete waste of money that did nothing for the story....jackasery
To be honest i think the polar bear wasn't even that well animated... Not to mention the Ghost > Zombie Polar Bear fact.
who is Ghost?
The Hound and Tormund = Best Companions
Somebody keep Ralph away
Well.Written.Complex.Characters.
We need zombie children
Mountain Your names Toby!\n\nZombie Polar Bear Kunta....KINTE
Longer videos. Dumb cunts!

So many haters... Fuck you.. This scene was amazing. CGI made by Weta Digital
People are always wining about everything thing... The show isn't what used to be but damn...
Fuck the all stupid assholes who keep bitching about the writing and direwolves. DnD made something awesome happen with this beast!
Please upload this entire series to youtube.
I remember your post about the mummy's still got her tummy comment and it's actually what made me start following you. I didn't however realise that the comment had come from a NURSE!!!! That's absolutely horrifying to hear!!!!! They are the people who are supposed to reassure you and a really fragile time and the fact that she had the nerve to make such a shitty comment it appalling 😡
Would love you to do a video about PCOS and how you overcame it x
I never had an issue with my body was happy with it, felt I looked good, always dressed nice then my friend wanted to join WW to be bridesmaid to my wedding but was scared to go alone so I went with her for moral support. Now 3 years on I’ve lost 2 stone and weight myself daily, feel guilty for anything nice that passes my lips and hate my stomach so much it’s ridiculous. I needed to hear your little chat tonight to have a think back to my size 12/14 self who never even owned a set of scales and enjoyed her food. Thank you G, keep being awesome xxxx 😘
I have a trick which seems to work for me when I need a boost about my body.  I'm not sure if it's a good trick or if it has downsides but as I say, it seems to work.  \nHow would I feel about myself if I was the size I am now but had just lost half a stone or a stone in weight?  I'd feel great, really confident, able to take on the world.  Even though I'm still the same size I am.  So it's all about tricking my mind that I've already lost some weight, and bringing about those feelings from previous weight losses.  Or I'm just gullible, it might be that!   \nIt's also good to remember everyone is different - there is no one perfect body shape or height or weight.  And that most people at some point feel the same way about their body, well their life really, and will be more sympathetic than you might think. xx
I've never been a typically 'skinny' person, I've had curves since I can remember, and for years I absolutely hated them, especially when I was coming up to secondary school/teenage years. I looked at other girls and always wondered why I couldn't have a flat stomach so I could wear these beautiful outfits that they did and get rid of this 'fat' which I now realise were my curves. It wasn't until I was about 15/16 that I realised that they weren't going to go away and I found my own style and found things that complimented me and made me feel great, I had so many people saying they wish they had my figure and I just could not work out why at the time. I've recently had a rough time which caused me to put on quite a bit of weight, and I'm so used to certain people commenting on it, not because they want to shame it, but they knew how confident I felt before I put it on. But it did make me feel a bit rubbish about myself and I did make it worse for ages, but now I'm in a better place and know that the size that I'm at is 'normal' for me and that's okay, I'd like to go back to my 'usual' size at some point but I know it will be on my terms and in my own time. \nI've realised that was a much longer speech than I expected, I could have gone on for ages :') xxx
Women are experts at creating problems that never existed before
I had the same experience when I first got stretch marks! Except I was horrified because I thought they were scars and they’d just appeared overnight and I didn’t know what they were... and I never actually thought to ask anyone and just ended up working it out as puberty came and my hips and boobs got them too
It is amazing how a throwaway comment can affect our thoughts. I am 7 months pregnant and I recently was standing in a queue and a Spanish couple in front said (in Spanish) let the fatty go in front. I speak Spanish so was completely shocked and didn't say anything to them. It really hurt me for a while and I am now kicking myself I didn't say something.x
I had twins last year and it astonishes me the number of people who almost congratulate me for looking like I never even had a baby, let alone two.  Obviously it is meant as a compliment but it DID happen and it worries me how we live in this society that wants women to look untouched by the amazing things their bodies can do.
I'm at the heaviest I've ever been, being 200lbs. I don't feel like myself at all. I look at my face and it's plumper than I'm used to. I've gotten to size 14 pants and that's the end of normal sizes. I have to buy shirts in L and dresses in XL. I hate it. I can only wear certain styles of clothes because I don't want to bring notice to any of the rolls. And yet I'm scared of exercising because I'm scared of being nauseous. The weight has even given me acid reflux. My doctor told me that even 10 lbs down would most likely solve my problems. My BMI tells me I'm legitimately obese, but if you look at me I look pretty damn normal. Before anyone says BMI is flawed and I shouldn't use it, I should say yes it is flawed. However, BMI is still pretty good at telling the average person who's not an extreme athlete or body builder which weight range they're in. It's great for determining at risk populations of average people. Anyhow, what bothers me is that I don't look like what you think of when you think of obesity. So having the title of obese put on me feels really out of place. I've been trying to focus more on my food. Eating more whole foods and less processed stuff. Drinking more water and tea. Making sure I eat my meals and that they're well portioned and limiting my snacks to 2 healthy snacks between meals. Especially avoiding eating past 7pm. Hopefully I can change these things gradually because I'd really like to feel like myself again and express myself the way I used to.
How do I encourage my fiance who doesn't like his body or feel confident with his appearance? I've got plenty of support and advice for my sisters... but what can I do for him???
Honesty like this really encourages me and gives me perspective <3 Love this!
You are such an inspiration. I'm now 16 and have struggled with how I've looked since around age 8 and it's getting worse. I've always punished myself for how I look but it's now horrible looking back at photos when I was 12/13 and I was actually so thin from avoiding food yet I know I was still positive I was overweight but now at 16 I've changed again and I hate it, I hate everything about me and I'm struggling so much with it, I'm leaving for an amazing trip in a few weeks to Iceland with my school yet my anxiety is out of control because all I can think about is that on the last day we are going swimming, I haven't stopped thinking about that for over a year and I desperately no longer want to go just because of how I'm going to look. I just wish I looked like somebody else
Thank you Gi for honestly and openly sharing with the world all the time. I feel like I could hug you today watching this. I'm same age as you and only the other day looked at young 20 something me and thought omg remember when your skin was that clear and young and fresh and you could do anything. Age is experience but youth is amazing too only when it has been lived through.
As long as I can remember iv been really self conscious of my body. All the way through high school all my friends were tiny and I always felt the odd one out, and I even had comments thrown at me in the school corridor about my size. I'm now 21 and still hate the body I'm in, and seem unable to loose weight yet at the same time have no motivation or energy to work out and push myself to loose it. I eat healthily but still allow the odd treat. I'd never dear wear anything skin tight or fitted only baggy tops and jumpers and you'd never catch me in a bikini or swimsuit in public! I can't remember the last time I stood in front of my mirror and had positive body thoughts, I tend to avoid it when I'm in just my underwear or getting dressed.
I really worry about children these days and how much they are influenced by all of the things they have access to now. BUT having said that, seeing more real life, normal people on YouTube, will hopefully give a more balanced view of the world 🦄💙💚💛💜
I wish I had a ounce of your self appreciative confidence. I have two children and struggle daily with accepting myself. My husband hasn't seen me naked (bar childbirth and pitch black intimate moments!) since before I had my first child. I look at myself in the mirror and feel proud of birthing two children, but I also mourn how confident and happy I felt with my body before getting pregnant. I eat well, I keep fit, but I just cannot shake the lack of confidence, I don't know how. I hope one day I can, because it's soul destroying
Fab mum day gi on the whole my bod is ok but I will forever be mum belly with tiger stripes but wouldn't change it. Taken me 7 years and 2 kids to get here tho
I have never been pregnant and sadly I never will as I can't have children. But I totally relate to the feelings in this video. I am 38 and still trying to find how to be comfortable in my own skin plus size skin and cant bear to look in the mirror but i am working on it Thank you for your honesty. I love your videos. X
Struggling to see why this is on trending..? no critique of the vid just numbers.
Oh Gi! ❤️ I'm pregnant with twin girls due any day now. I've always been large ever since I gained weight when I was 15 y.o. (26 now) and my mum and my sis has always been nagging me to lose weight and be that thin again. Now with my pregnancy I've lost a lot of weight due to morning sickness and they've been on me to start weight watchers as soon as my girls are born - just so that I can keep that weight and drop further. It makes me so mad and sad. 😔😡
I really love the honesty here. I wish I could go back and love myself and my body as a teenager - not only was I fitter and healthier than I am now but I spent so much time and energy hating myself and it's not a healthy way to be. When I had to be signed off with depression 2 years ago I spent a lot time hating myself and really turning my feelings in on myself, to the point where I delayed my recovery as I couldn't even like myself, including my body. Punishing it with excessive amounts of food or starving it were not healthy. Then I discovered running, and although it's a challenge, I like my body more now. It's strong and it can do so much more than I ever thought it could. And I think being in love has made me see myself the way he sees me, which is incredible.
My highest weight was 285lbs and my main goal was to get under 200 and I did! It took about 3 years and I got down to 193! My final goal was (still is) 160 but I found out I was pregnant when I was at 193. I am now 36 weeks pregnant and I must say, going above 200 again was really hard and it made me sad. My husband has been amazing and keeps telling me how beautiful I am and I know it'll be worth it because I'm gonna have a beautiful baby girl. My body will never be the same and I accept that. I mean, I'm growing a tiny human inside of me! Isn't it amazing?! You are an inspiration for so many people Gi. We all love you <3
I look back at photos of me from about the age of 15 onwards, I was so slim and attractive but I felt like a great, big elephant. One thing that I wish I could do, is go back and tell the young me to be proud of her body and to accept that she is gorgeous. All my life I have avoided wearing dresses and skirts because I have 'rugby player's legs' but I'm 45 now and have realised that they are the only pair of legs that I'm going to get so now have a wardrobe full of lovely dresses and skirts that I wear. If people don't like my legs, they don't have to look!
Thank you for sharing, Gi 💕
I too felt empowered throughout pregnancy and I now feel proud of those stretch marks post pregnancy! I was worried about what my body would look like after giving birth but I've never been this happy about my body. I view my stretch marks as a reminder of how empowered I felt during pregnancy and hope to never feel bad about my body again!
so honest and so truthful for so many people including myself. i'm not a mum but i love these videos!
Probably late to the discussion, but I am currently 20 and i started noticing stretch marks when i was around 15/16. They'd probably developed long before that, but that was the first time I'd properly paid attention to them. At the time, it didn't bother me, they were only on the inside of the thighs, who would see them? Around a year ago, they started getting really dark, like a dark purple kinda colour  (they used to be silver), and there were a lot more on my thighs, but also on my sides. I've always been really self conscious about my weight and I dress to hide it a lot of the time. You're videos and your book and just you in general are really helping me to be okay with my 'tiger stripes' and to know that you dont have to look like everyone else to be happy with who you are. You're so confident and honest and real and its a very nice and much needed break from all the perfect models on Instagram and on magazines❤xx
I thought we only got stretchmarks when pregnant and was horrified when I got the same thigh marks and more on my boobs in my childhood. I was so ashamed of them I wouldn't go the the beach or swim with my friends anymore. I'm still not confident having my legs out. Thank you for talking about this! <3
I'm much more confident with the way I look now compared to when I was a teen/early 20s. I was so unhealthily skinny (could see my ribs) and I hated the way I looked in comparison to more curvaceous friends! I've got more to me now and I'm much happier!
This was what I needed to hear today. Thank you for encouraging me. It was actually a few weeks ago I realized I was comparing my body to my 18 year old body. The one that didn't have the health issues I have now. My goal is to be healthy now. Whether that means I'm fat or not. Being healthy is key. <3
So happy you posted this today. I suffer with body dysmorphia and in my teens i hated my body. I was a size 8 and hated it. Everyone said i looked great and i couldn't see it. I sufffered with pcos and endometriosis along with other issues so i was hairy and my stomach would swell. I had my oldest at 19 and struggled with the weight gain to the point i was nearly hospitalised. But once she was born my worries seemed to get put in a box, it was like someone flicked a switch and i was happier with how i looked. Now im pregnant with baby no.4 and embracing the bump and womanly curves. I love my saggy pouch from my 2 cesareans and my scars from various needles and ops. I know that my body has made some amazing munchkins who tell me everyday how beautiful i am 💕
I seriously have a love hate relationship with my body. Some days I love it and think “you like great, you have had 2 kids - awesome!!” Then the next I see a large stomach and bits that wobble and stretch marks and it’s repulsive. I think us as women will never love ourselves completely because of media we see and these “celebs” who snap back and just have that “skinny gene” but we should be bloody proud of it...  (by the way massive fans of you and your family!) - Essex Mum too!
All women are beautiful
This is so inspirational !! ❤️
I have never been skinny and I hate the term fat - I prefer to call myself a plus size lady! I was bullied for my weight which didn't help - I comfort ate cause I thought it made me feel good. However I'm 24, still plus size but I am happy and healthy. I was always told you will never have a boyfriend if you are fat - but I was in a 2 year relationship with a guy who adored me and we would still be together but he unfortunately passed away. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel - I've been told by guys I'm there type - and I have a date on Wednesday! I will lose weight for me and not anyone else! Anyways who'd want to fit in - I prefer being unique xxx
Last year I wore with myself about my body image and how I felt which led to me writing on a friend’s blog about my hang ups and wobbly bits. The amount of people that wanted to talk to me and say “I feel the same way too” was incredible. Don’t worry! Everyone has bits they don’t like!!\n\n(P.s here’s the link to my post: http://www.verbalremedy.co.uk/no-interest-fat-friend/ )
couldn't agree more with everything you said. didn't feel great about my body early on in puberty (probably cause I was quite skinny as a child but developed early) but I've got used to it and yeah I do have moments where I wish I had a completely flat stomach but hey ho that's life 😊😊😊
Gi you are such an inspiration, thank you for talking so openly about subjects like this, and making everyone feel accepted and appreciate the fact that we are who we are. Xx
My story is similar to yours. I was never super confident in my body. High school was a mess for me, but I got past it. I then, after accepting my body for the most part was in an abusive relationship where the guy was so worried about me getting fat that he did extreme things to me to make me diet, excersize, etc. \nGot out of that after way to long and claimed ownership over my body again. Never again would a man dictate me like that.  \nI found a wonderful man who said he could care less what I weigh, and we married.\nI felt good about myself, not the skinniest ive ever been, perhaps the largest, but the most loved.\nMy relationship with my body hit rock bottom when I lost 3 babies in a row. How could I call myself a woman?  how could my husband love me when I couldn't give him his hearts desire? I am broken, i am undeserving, i am unlovable. It was awful, i stopped taking care of myself and unfortunately dont recognise myself in the mirror my shape has changed so much but I have had 2 kids now and a third is due in about 6 weeks. My body is amazing, even if most people just look at me and think, oh she's let herself go, I know the battles I have fought to get here and the demons I face. If im able to return to a slimmer state after this baby that would be amazing, if not, my husband still loves me and I have a beautiful family.
Thanx for this video. I was always the really skinny girl, who never put weight on when i younger. I’m now 35 with 4 children ages from 4 to 18 (almost). As u can imagine I no longer have the flat stomach that I had before. Try in vain to exercise.. and feel guilty if I don’t.. \nI definitely need to except myself now, n stop looking at everyone else for how I should look. Thank you for this xx
I've never looked after my body, and have an unhealthy relationship with food. Now I'm two years into TTC and my thinking is beginning to shift. I feel guilty for being so unhealthy but, still, I feel overwhelmed at the task ahead - the task of making real changes.
Ohh how i needed this today! I suffer with endometriosis, i was diagnosed at 13, now 19. The amount of hormones ive been on is quite scary, going through medically induced menopause, 3 major operations really does take its toll on your body! Thank you Gi for making me realise that despite the fact my body lets me down I should still love and embrace it💛💛 thank you!
Love this! Thank you so much! Have had a lot of 'meh' days since the birth of my second boy a year ago (still can't lose the last of the weight!) But it's so true, my body gave me my 2 boys and am so grateful!
Love you even more this video is so special
Thank you for this video Gi, I know you won't read this but I have to say. Been to drs to see my diabetic nurse and i felt like crap. I'm never going to be a mum I've embraced this now.  \nThank you for being you xxx
What a great message, Gi!  I've always struggled with weight and have never been satisfied with my body.  I developed at a young age and have never liked my big boobs.  I found gaining a little weight helped camouflage them.  After my first son, I was so large that I went to weight watchers to help lose the extra weight and felt so much better.  I weighed less at 9 months pregnant with my younger son.  Over the years I've lost and gained back the same weight that I no longer worry about it (well, as much anyway!).  At this stage of my life, I just want to be heart healthy and able to get around easily.  It's sad how society and ads makes you feel like you're inadequate.  I'm just shy of 5 feet and my natural body type is definitely not like a stick thin model.  You're so right that we should accept and embrace who we are and not compare ourselves to others.
I never liked my figure, but am currently pregnant with my third baby and am suffering with hyperemesis. I have lost nearly 2 stone in weight in the space of a couple of months and am the skinniest i have ever been. I feel awful! I look awful and i will never ever strive to be thin or have the 'perfect' figure again!
Lots of love Gi xxx
I was diagnosed with PCOS at 15 (I'm now 36) and have always had fluctuating weight and consequently low body confidence. Things got worse however, when I was trying to conceive and tried various treatments including clomid. 7 years later I had icsi/IVF and fortunately my daughter came along. Since having her almost 7 years ago I have really struggled to lose weight. I have always exercised regularly and really enjoy it but I can't seem to get to a size that I'm completely comfortable with. I have a trainer and he works me really hard and I feel physically fit but the appearance of my body is unbearable. I'm super proud that after all the years of feeling that my body was fighting me to get pregnant that I carried a child, but in terms of body confidence I don't have any. I avoid looking in mirrors, I don't accept compliments from my husband when he says I look nice etc and this can really upset my husband but I cannot help it. I totally relate to many of the things you say in this video and hope that one day I can reach the point where I'm confident and happy with how my body looks.
Hi Gi! My body lets me down time and time again. I have had Crohns disease since I was 11 (now 35) and multiple ops have left me scarred and with a stoma bag so body image is important to me.  I've embraced how I look because you only get one shot at life.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder! Love yourself and be loved x
I hate my body I cover up as much as I can,there is not one part I like.I've recently put on a lot of weight that I can't seem to shift,but as I was anorexic for quite some years I'm trying my best not to let that mind set take over I hope one day I will like my body but it's very hard not to feel judged by people for putting on weight or losing to much weight I hope one day that I won't be influenced by people's views on the way I look 😊
Especially post pregnancy (I have not had any children) there's this enormous pressure to force yourself to shrink yourself before you leave the hospital. I think it's important to know we are meant to be different sizes I'm not meant to be a size 2. As long as you're healthy that's the most important thing
Thanks for the video Gi. So many women feel the pressure to be skinny. Over the years I've put on weight and I'm okay with that. The media drive me insane with the articles about mums who get back into there skinny jeans weeks after birth, it's putting to much pressure on new mums. We all have different bony shapes so it should not matter weather someone is a size 8  or an 18! Your a star gi, and we need mums like you to tell the truth and speak out. You look great and your a Fab mum to.
Hi Gi this video came at a good time for me! Didn't realise I needed to hear what you said but it soothed me to know everyone is struggling in the same ways I do! I was diagnosed at 13 with pcos and have had a 21 year fight with this, I unfortunately have struggled a long time with the inability to fall pregnant and it still isn't happening and it breaks my heart every month. I've tried metformin and it didn't agree with me sadly. I still hope that I will be blessed but I am trying to make my peace with the fact it may never happen. After a big scare earlier this year of finding I had a condition that could develop into cervical cancer I've had to have a coil fitted and I hate that little piece of plastic so much, to me it spells game over for the baby dream! The body I have been given may not work how it should with all the other health problems I have but it's mine and I love it, I am the heaviest weight I have ever been but I eat well don't exercise as much as I should but I'm active and I'm listening to what it's telling me for the first time in all my 34 years with it. Thank you for being you and promoting self love ❤️ you Gi are a wonderful human xxxx
I've felt bad about my body since I was way too young. I used to be really open and a happy kid, and I loved funky clothes. One day I was wearing a crop top and an older boy said: you're way too fat to wear that. From that comment on, my self image changed so much. I always worried how I would look in certain clothes and compared myself to others in a negative way. The silly thing is that when I started a diet, lost a lot of weight and was considered 'skinny', I still felt horrible. It's not so much the weight, it's the mental scars that keep nagging. Bloody annoying!
I remember a few years ago I felt so fat and disgusting and it really got me down and I look at pictures now from that time and can't believe I ever complained about it.
Well said Gi! :)\nOne thing that annoys me though is when people moan about their bodies on social media or say that they need to go on a diet when they don't. My sister ( who's only one year younger than me, 23) does it a lot and it really worries me. I recommended Megan Jayne Crabbe's book on body positivity to her as it really helped me but she just laughed and threw it back in my face :(
THANK U FOR THIS
I'm on a diet with my husband right now.. I say diet but actually we starting eating healthier and loosing weight. It is so much easier when we do it together! I lost 6 kilos but still not happy. I think I'll never be happy with my body cause I keep comparing myself to others and think that I'm not thin enough. You are an inspiration to us all! love your videos xxxx
I am currently 35 weeks pregnant and am sick off people saying woo your huge or well so and sos bump is much bigger than your I feel like I should smile but really I want to say who cares my body is grown my baby keeping him safe I absolutely adore you G!
Oh Gi. Thank you for sharing this!\nEverything you said is actually what/how i feel about my body!\nAfter having two miscarriages and having tree boy's xx\nSo happy your back
Aw Gi I love this you're being so honest! Most of us can relate to this, you are beautiful! We all are! :)
Solidarity with your post-birth confidence smack down from a nurse. Nurses, I don't think, realise the impact a throwaway comment can make on vulnerable new moms #bluestriggers
Thank you for sharing this Gi ❤️ since having my little boy (he's two now) I've really struggled with my body - confidence has been at all time lows more than it has been positives! Although it's taken me this long, I'm finally embracing my body and self care is so important. Not every day do I feel like that, and inspiring people like you make me realise that it's ok to feel like that. So thank you 😘😘 Katy xxx
And you've done it again! Touched me with your honesty as if you were the little angel on my left shoulder that is telling me that everything is alright! THANK YOU GI! 😇
So weird! I decided to go for a run today, first one since having my baby so that's 9 months of pregnancy + her 18months! Didn't manage very far but felt so good afterwards, it's time to start taking care of my body for my sake and for my daughter! Thanks for the boost Gi! x
I've been really up and down with how I've  felt about my body.  I have always been on the heavier side, ever since I was a kid.  When I got to college I really let my eating get out of control and I got to be really heavy and unhealthy.  But then last year I began exercising regularly and eating better than I had in my entire life!  I felt great and thought I could accomplish anything!  I lost a good amount of weight, but still hadn't reached my goal. Recently, however, I've felt that my impulse control has gone and I've gained back some of the weight that I had lost and I've started eating junk again, and I don't know if I'll be able to be as healthy as I was before.  Hopefully I can get resume the healthier habits that I had before, and I can be happy and healthy again.
Thank you Gi. Just.. thank you. ❤️ from a mum of two from Finland
Hi Gi, thank you for this video it really helps too hear someone talking about PCOS, as not much is out there.
A wonderful message! I also love the message from The Body Image Movement via the movie 'embrace'- go find it! It's wonderful! 'Your Body is not an ornament, it's the vehicle to Your dreams' !!
Needed this today, such a great video x Thanks for sharing
I always say I wish I was as fat as the first time I thought I was fat! When you are younger you never actually appreciate what you have.\nYears and years later and a couple of dress sizes bigger I actually feel more comfortable and happy now than I ever did ! \n\nFab vlog as usual gi 😘 xx
Wow such a strong video to watch you're a beautiful person to speak to us about your personal experiences.xx😀💗
My little girl is 12 weeks old. I am covered in stretch marks but I don’t care about that (like you I had stretch marks from a young age). I weigh less now than I did pre-pregnancy because I lost so much weight through morning sickness but I now feel like I’m just eating crap. I really need to get back on eating healthy but I had gestational diabetes late in my pregnancy (I really had the pregnancy from hell) and don’t think I can deal with anything strict in terms of dieting. Your honesty about your body is so refreshing. I’ve never been body confident but I’m going to embrace it.
Needed to see this this morning.....28wks pregnant with baby number 4...Trying to embrase my body but its not easy all the time Xx
You look fab, glowing skin, bright eyes and not a wrinkle in sight!!
Loved this! You're amazing!!
Thank you for such an amazing video, I think its only normal we don't love our bodies every minute of every day. But we need to accept our bodies and be kind to them. I grew up hating mine, i treated it badly through having anerxia for over a decade. It was only when I hit 30 last year that I thought actually it's not perfect but it's the only one I have and it does amazing things. If I'm having a bad day and hating my thighs I think we'll those so called fat thighs that are a size eight crazy to think they are fat give me the opportunity to walk and take pictures that I am love  doing, they are strong and allow me to be active I should be thankful for them they allow me to do so much. How we feel about our bodies is all in our mind that needs to have a healthy mindset.
Thanks Gi! That's all i needed to hear this morning! Im 23y, and have this struggle with my body since 11y/12y. Im still trying to have this confidence but, for me its really hard. But as my grandma would say one step at a time!You're absolutely amazing! Thanks again for being so honest and positive!
Thanks Gi ^^. You are an amazing, lovely person. Hope you and your beautiful family are well.\n\nLots of love,\nMélanie
Thank you for this - you speak so eloquently about something that is so complicated. I did a little video as well about my issues if you're interested https://youtu.be/4gbg94fxvUE. I too have two children and have struggled with my body confidence my whole life. I'm reading your Happy mum, happy baby book at the moment and it is just fantastic.
i loved this you have summed up most women's perspectives on them selves. I could of said nearly world for word this about myself, i also have had 2 boys but constantly compare myself to other mums but i think those other mums are also comparing themselves to us. I do this in all aspects of my life you have mad me feel so much better posting this! xx
You are amazing, Gi!
Awesome video.  Thank you for always being so honest.
I was having a meh day too. This video has made me feel so much better ❤
It’s so nice to hear you talk about pcos. I found out 6/7 years ago that I had it at the same time of trying for our first child. After over a year of trying I finally had our first son and couple of years later our second son. They are truly my little miracles. Since having them my body and pcos has really become a massive struggle. I get so angry with it but it’s made me the person I am today and I’m stronger for it.
Loved this! One of my personal struggles is staying motivated to eat healthy and staying active? \n\nSide note, your car gives no shits about sitting on the dining table 😂
Yes Gi!! :) xx
Beauty lies within
Bloody love this woman!
Really important video
Hi Gi would you ever do a video about PCOS? Things such as how it effects you and what medications you take to help with your symptoms? Not just conception and pregnancy (that too obviously) but your journey with PCOS in general like the excess hair, spots, weight gain, mood swings etc, and what things help with each? I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 18 (I'm now 30) and am always on the look out for other ways to cope.
After suffering from anorexia for years and years I really appreciate super honest videos and posts like this my love!! Well done you, it why we all love ya! ❤️
I have two sisters and grew up being the chubby, short one. My lovely nickname was Fatty Arbuckle! it was meant to be endearing???? My body confidence came when I had my first little lady. Of course, I have a few bad moments on occasion, but there's something kind of magical about having children, being in a team with your body and seeing how amazing it is, rather than being at war with it. Thank you for sharing your stories. xxx
I've lost 13st over the last 18 months and I feel wonderful, ok I'm not going to be toned but I'm so happy 😊 😊 😊 😊 great video xxx
Wow. This was so honest and real. I've never related to something as much as I relate to this video and your story. Actually, I've never been pregnant and I always worried about how my body would be after I had kids... Thank you for this message and for sharing your story. Xx
What you said at the end about not swapping your size 8/10 body for Buzz and Buddy really struck me! I'm 12 weeks pregnant and really fluctuate between feeling great and proud of my changing body but then last night a pair of my pjs were too tight around my tummy and it just crushed me because I don't really have a proper bump yet. I had this big hormonal discussion with my husband while he tried to convince me that what my body does is amazing and that he loves the way I look as I'm changing but I just felt really sorry for myself that I was going to lose my 8/10 figure that I've only had for a few years but you're right I want this baby more than anything and that's just going to have to include my figure - so thank you very much! A well timed video for me haha
Gi - I found out I had PCOS when I was 16 getting my first birth control and I was so crushed for awhile. I'm 19 now and I still worry about it sometimes. Thank you for opening up about this, it means so much. <3 x
I recently just saw a photo of me at 20 years old, and when I used to see it, I would wish I were that skinny again. But then I remember how that was one of the most stressful years of my life. And some people, when stressed, gain weight. Not me. I STARVE. I literally forget to eat, and I was going to nearly four days without sleep and only coffee for nourishment. Now I look at that photo and think that I never want to be that unhealthy or that weak.\n\nI'm much bigger and heavier than I was then, but I'm also far stronger (I started doing aerial arts a few years ago; it's been incredible). Though I still have days where I really notice my soft tummy, or my thunder thighs, and just not contented with how I look.\n\nIt hasn't helped that in Filipino culture, we have this awful kind of tradition of greeting each other with Uy tumaba ka! (Hey, you've gotten fat!), especially during family reunions by overly nosy aunts. They use a tone that's supposed to be well-meaning, but actually just feels really degrading. And it does things to your confidence. Even when I was dancing ballet, and wasn't at all overweight, but I get a little heavy, and suddenly people react as if I've grown so much.
This is about as funny as running my little toe into the leg of the couch. Painful to watch.
What a contrast, Steve Baldwin an okay guy, his brother Alec, total douche bag
Move To Google And then Type: *FreeCodesXXX* This is without a doubt the purely working FIFA Coins working from this month. Never waste the free time on some other software

I *LOVE* Alec Baldwin's impersonation of Donald Trump!
It is a possession of the United States. It is a U.S. territory. But it is an unincorporated territory, and it has not yet been incorporated into the U.S. Therefore, it is not a part of the United States
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dzvnI5LYY4U TRUTH. ALL PEOPLE COPY AND SHARE
Might as well let Alec have this, after this role his career is pretty much over
Ugh. I used to love the Trump skits, but they’ve just been overused so much.
they got the diaper pants right.
I guess it's funny, if our IQ is down in the 80s.  Otherwise it's just snark.
Baldwin you never served in the military so you became a Hollywood fake impersonating cum stane ACTOR.
I'm a trump supporter and can't help but laugh even though its 95% not true
Trump should be replaced, but this is so boring. Hope this show will die out just as Seth should
Media is a business! Trump sales! Is like Steve Colbert, needs Trump to make raitings. \n\nBefore Trumps introduce in politics Jimmy Fallons dominated the ratings at night.  \n\nThe numbers of SNL and Steven Colbert show was a mess \nbefore Trump  now they have good raitings thanks to Trump...\n\n They are so bad creators and productor what need Trump to make money.\n\nMegyn Kelly is now millionare to because Trump.
So the Bush/Obama presidency screw with the Russians for 16 years and now the idiots in media are up in arms that the Ruskies repay the favor. Well wtf were you thinking was going to happen? Serves all you neocons on the right and left just perfectly. And then blame the Rump for all your shenanigans. If we actually taught anything in schools, people might be able to see through all this sh.
Yet SNL never said anything bad about Obama. As if the guy was perfect.
Not even funny. Just mean, immature and hateful. SNL has gone off the rails.
Did anyone else jump when Jeff Sessions stood up. I thought he was going to come through the door.
Say Puerto Rico as the natives say it, Puelto Lico, de done eres? De San Juan? Hay, Dio Mio!
This is just not funny anymore, Alec Baldwin is so embarrassing.
snl can suck a dick its now ok to call people on tv crackers yet we cant say the word nigger stfu wtf will u do when trump is gone the man could cure childhood cancer and they would bash him and to think its ok to slur white people but u lose your job if u say the word nigger
Surprised this show is still on, since it stopped being funny in the 90's
Went from comedy to a pusher of HATE.
that's a terrible huckabee. Where is the lazy eye?
Disgusting and not funny at all! \nWhat happened to snl ??? Y'all lost the good writers a long ass time ago!!! \n💩💩💩💩
SNL is a shell of itself all it does now is just make fun of Trump and try hard to be funny,  liberal trash
Funny stuff, the only thing Trump will Make Great Again is SNL ! \nThank you for that Donnie, but kiss my ass on everything else.
Hey I remember seeing that guy at trump's 100 days I was gonna say MAGA but didn't wanna trigger him.
SO             MUCH            CHAOS      !                EACH           DAY          MAKES         YOUR         HEAD          SPIN         !!!
I just don't find Baldwin funny
My you've a great country !! \nTake the piss during a very difficult time in your country ! \nShame as  you like to portray yourself as the most powerful country In the world ! \nShame you act so crappy ! No hope for the rest of the world you scary people 😡😡😡
I wanted Trump to win even though I voted for Bernie cause I wanted to him getting trolled daily. Now Trump looks like he is been in office 8 years when it's only been 10 months.
Please Youtube a song I wrote.  Youtube: I Can’t Stand the Donald with music and lyrics.  Thank you!
How Funny how the late lite night Scumbags live Behind Gated Armed Security Walls  Talk Shit about GUN CONTROL... Most of them would be DEAD if They Didn't have Armed Guards !
LOL LOOK AT THIS ASSHATS COMPLAINING. SNL HAS ALWAYS DONE POLITICAL SATIRE. THEY'VE MADE FUN OF MANY PRESIDENTS AND ADMINISTRATIONS. BIG FUCKING DEAL. TRIGGERED MUCH?
This Guy is scum pure and simple.
10/10 need more small Lones of million dollars
14K Butt-Hurt *CUPCAKES* crying in a corner where no one cares.
Those who Support Trump are just as simple minded as the Billionaire bafoon in the Oval Office! *The Fact that Trump is Cleary Obsessed with his OWN DAUGHTER (Ivanka), does NOT represent the Country as a whole, rather, its indicative of those Trump 'Supporters' who believe that theres nothing wrong while Lusting after their own family members?! Where do I get my News from?? Unlike the Trump posse, I use my eyes instead of my ears and exercise common sense and solid judgment! That's HUUUUUGE!
FUCK YOU SNL AND FUCK YOU ALEC BALDWIN, YOU LITTLE COLUMBIAN ANAL HAIR, I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU CAN SUCK MY NIGERIAN BLACK DICK!!!! IF you make fun of our amazing president again, then I might have to sue SNL... and for all the hippie-liberals out there, if you have nothing worth saying,then just shut the hell up! Also... there are a hell of a lot more Republicans in America then Liberals just so you know... I am fed up with all this bullshit! Have a good day...
Alec Baldwin’s career is actually on life supporting thanks to Trump...not a bad thing considering it has been dead for the past 95 years
The boss baby 70 years after the film
The Trump sketches are good, I love Trump and still find it funny as hell...i find some shit out of line but I can look by that
AMAZING TIME 2 BE ALIVE, 4 REAL
I used to like you guys but now you boring repetitive and annoying 🖕
So stupid and not even funny.. the abusive a****** was verbally rude to his daughter has the audacity to go on any moral Crusade what a loser
This shit is hilarious!!! I voted trump btw.
Anybody else think of v for vendetta movie when yall see these kind of vids lol
Like HBO and Comedy Central, hatred is the current style of humor.
This wasn't funny
this is just stupit
SNL = http://2girls1cup.ca/
***remix song***https://youtu.be/ypQmFFfUu3c
happy day
this is terrist shit
ALEX BALDWIN,\nCHINGA TO MADRE!!!
good goyim
SNL sucks now too liberal and exaggerated!
Mackinnon is amazing as Sessions!
Sorry Baldwin, Trump outfunnied you!
fkn stop
You liberals are such fucking losers.
Fuck trump, DEATH TO TRUMP
PRESIDENT WTF
With fishies and bubbles and turtles that bite! lmao
kate is tryna be Keenan so badly
Too funny yup that's Trump haha
Lame
Banananas? What are those, exactly?
US needs to worry about it's own city Houston before they worry about a commonwealth that ignored the hurricane warning  \n\nlogic vs emotion \n\nfuck this liberal way of think already
This show sucks! I did not even think people watched this lame shit anymore.Oh that's right the left wing liberal Hillary loving snowflakes, I forgot.Alec Baldwin is a dildo sucking moron.
Takes a lot of work to make fun of politics huh, why don't you try to actually be funny instead like the good old days
The sad truth is that Trump is actually funnier than SNL. Now that's funny
SNL may be the most unAmerican show on TV. This stuff is garbage.
jeff sessions is the old dude from The Burbs (a tom hanks movie 1989ish)
This is pathetic.  We have the greatest President EVER, and Liberals cannot handle it.  They have to crawl in their safe spaces.  Would be great if people would actually research instead of being the dumb shits and following along with ignorant celebrity has-beens.
Don't tweet on me, Please.........now that was funny!!!
This is getting kind of old it's only like the 50th time they've done it
Ha ha this clown Alex Baldwin a failed actor is still mad that his paper god Hillary lost!
TRUMP SENT $1,000,000 OF HIS OWN MONEY AND A LOT OF SUPPLIES YOU STUPID LIBERAL FUCKS. GET A DAMN BRAIN YOU FUCKIN CUNTS
fucking libtards
fuck Alek Baldwin
cool,it'sfun
SNL=Fonz jumping the shark
This bash Trump bullshit under the guise of comedy is getting very old.  Get a life SNL and fans
This is his life now so obsessed with trump he has to play him
The unfunny hate will lose your next election- please continue
Isn't this getting old
SNL is fashionably anti-White.
Skit was hilarious, as well as all the comments from all the trumpanzees crying like a bunch of wusses hahahaha poor babies!
Liberals need snl to dry their tears from the election loss😂😂😂this is gonna get very old even to them for next 7 years😂😂😂😂
Baldwin is great : )
FEMA Prime :)
The stupidity of the common person is persistent in overseeing the grand scheme. Sides are the only goal at this point. Polarize all angles as strongly as possible, at all cost that's what you're up against. Don't look only at what you are directed to look at. Don't make up your mind on an impressionable whim to the point of being controlled into a rage. Fucking listen to each others views, takes and experiences wether they be agreeable or apprehensible and take them as the differences between people that are impassable at a certain point. We as humans are better than this, don't retrace known historical outcomes through the basis of ignorance solely on the fact that information is Out of sight , out of mind. Be more aware. Start with small details if you must. If you are walking down a trail looking for someone not far ahead and a spiderweb covers your face don't continue on the same path, consider other options.
Badlwin really good at playin Trump.
https://youtu.be/KvPtxUj1J30\n\nNOW WATCH THIS
Alec Baldwin was once an\nactor. I am picky about movies, but he made a couple\nreasonably good films. \n       So why would a guy who has had some success start\nto destroy his career with this\nPolitical nonsense.\n       The only thing I can think is its a mental problem. self\ndoubt and stress. The guy is\non a Collision course with a\nbreak down.
alec baldwin....shouldn't he be humiliating his daughter by repeatedly screaming at her? yeah...what a piece of shit....he should be locked in a metal cage for his abusive behavior...
Compare & contrast Jim Carrey's comedy with that of NBC's The Office.
I turn to Fire Marshall Bill for political wisdom. 👍
is anyone else mad that adam eget threw the letter on the ground? carrey took them off but didnt throw them and MAYBE for a second they thought the R was broken due to it not being a full R but still man don't throw that shit. eget loses a point this one for that. gains one also for his spot on jim carrey heat barrier impression.
I'll shoot ya in the back
Best interview yet, Norm. Very happy to see this video is trending on youtube. I've been watching since season 2 and it really is the best thing out there. It deserves far more attention than any of the other talk shows on tv. Love Jim Carrey. Love Norm Macdonald.
Jim called the CANDY MAN for his ex apparently, her NOSE was EMPTY
SEE YOU NEXT SEASON?!?!?!?!?!?!?\nThat's it?\nC'mon Norm! Please give us more!
he has too much energy for a regular human
That desk must be made of mmatchsticks
What book about Andy Kaufman are they talking about right after the Hugh Hefner story? At @14.00 ...?
Is it just me or is Jim morphing into a combination of Crispin Glover and Deepak Chopra as he ages?
This is the first episode I couldn't get through.
Jim’s the white Dave Chappell
Jim Carey has literally gone insane and not in a good way.
Wow didn’t know norm had his own show. Love it
The funniest episode  to this day! They should get Jim and Norm together for a movie...
Autistic teens watching h3h3 & idubbz cringe shock comedy have no clue what funny is. This was funny
Sad it's the last one.. That was a great season!!
Jim Carrey + no joke cards = best show yet
Norm!  Please invite Emo Philips to the show!
Jim Carrey should do a Charles Manson biopic. He could nail the crazy head/neck movement.
Jim Carey has transcended or unraveled, either way he is an utter genius.
poor bastard is always on.
Jim Carrey always destroys sets during interviews. That's kinda his thing, he was always this way. Wacky and adversarial during interviews, and difficult to work with. This was Jim Carrey, doing Jim Carrey, doing an interview.  This was every bit the Kaufman like master that he admires. Proven totally by all these sad and erroneous comments regarding Jim's mental condition. Don't adjust your television people, this is just Jim fucking with the picture.
@7:00 The Cure quote, nice! Norm didn't notice
one of his next films will be about terrence mckenna, a psychonaut philosopher. for this role, jim ingested 5 grams of hallucinogenic mushrooms. His worldly veil has been lifted and this is the result. all of which he says is true. and those who have never had a psychedelic trip before will never be on his level. the only comic there who understood was micheal cera.
he looks like kevin bacon everyday
Norm is trying to keep the interview on the positive side but Jim is constantly squirreling out of control.
these guys are so fucking high, I love it
I made it to 23 minutes.  It's all so sad.
The two highest comedic IQ's in the world, both saboteurs dismantling everything as they see it. Neither can build up anything without the other tearing it down perfectly. Neither can be right or wrong about anything. There is no forward direction, only circular blades cutting and cutting down. These two pretending to be host and guest is perhaps the most mesmerizing psychological experiment I've ever seen.
Jim, let me tell you a little story about a carpenter.
What the hell? I'm watching and suddenly I see a Michael Cera cameo!
If you pause it right at 53:20, you can see delighted Jim is by Norm's lick the cum off her tits story.
Jim is a crackhead liberal. Looks like shit.
Did Jim Carrey just turn 15?  Yeah, we're nothing, nothing matters it's all BS man.  Does he understand how stupid this sounds?  Or is this some high-brow comedy i'm not aware of.
Sometimes I get the impression that Adam is Norm's Karl Pilkington.
There is something of resemblance in Billy Corgan's face within Norm's face.  I love you Norm!
JIM CARREY IS A GENIUS!!  HE'S ACTING LIKE A TRUE ARTIST ! HILARIOUS GLAD TO SEE JIM CARREY BACK TO HIS OLD ANTICS!!!  HE'S FUNNY AS FUCK AGAIN!!!
You might disagree, but I feel Jim Carrey is a proven entertainer.
Oh I see what happened. Jim went crazy so he could get internet famous and sell rediculous snake oil products to the sheep.
I've taken my ego, and shoved it far up my ass face-first! All-righty then!\n-Jim Carrey.
Guess he hates republicans, how shocking another judgmental Hollywood asshole who knows what’s best for us all. Thank God or I’m sorry thank Darwin we have these highly evolved folks to guide us monkeys.
I love how brushed over michael cera was, i feel like if he was on the podcast Norm would just talk to Eget the whole time, bless his heart
Who would have thought that interviewing Jim Carrey would be scarier than interviewing Mike Tyson?
couldn't even get a real person to be on the show this week?
Carrey is just embarrassing himself,\n just for another 15 mins
Reminds me of every Eric Andre interview can't stop laughing
I am not a person - soul-less Jim Carrey
Every successful social interaction includes a period of discomfort. --Darren O'Donnell   This is the best damn coffee cup of a podcast to ever hit the floor.
Joe Rogan hates when people talk over him, Jim Carrey wouldn't make it.
Jim just make another ace movie.  get back in your right mind man!  you've seemed to have slipped through the years.  creeeepy!
I was enjoying the show greatly, but after 20 min. I COULDN'T take it anymore. I feel like Jim has a lot of knowledge and interesting insights to offer but they are drowned sometimes by his excess. I mean those actions were attractive when he was in his 20s or 30s  even 40s, but now they should be more measured.
WHEN DOES THE comedy start?
Hey Jim, You’re a fucking asshole.
I don't have an ego at all HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
Love how he absolutely doesn’t care about his ego lol
there's like coke and e in Jim's coffee
37:16 a wild Michael Cera appears
dude is tripping off lsd, I swear I heard him say 'three tabs a day' at one point
Is Norm looking skinnier, or is it just the drugs?
Awesome awesome show, this one will go down in the archives.
Poor Jim Carrey is starting to get that Kevin Bacon head.
im almost positive Jim is preparing for an upcoming role & that preparation consists of him convincing the world that he is the person that he will be playing. the ultimate acting gig.
Nice to.understand Jim a little more...always was an idol of mine...his ability to make people laugh
Hey guys don’t mean to intrude but if you would please go follow me on Twitter @Stockett64.......I want to start tweeting regularly but I’ll need more followers and everybody’s support to do that so if you would please smash that follow button, thanks!!!
Get rid of the third wheel
Interesting to see Jim Carrey in the presence of such a brilliant comedian.
Norm needs to start leaving his cumslut boyfriend chained up in the anal dungeon instead of letting him sit at the table and ruin every goddamned episode
Love Norm. Jim is a complete idiot.
Couldn't get to the end of this one. Carrey's just obnoxious.
Does anyone else think Jim is hiding a deep depression by being so over the top and trying to get people to laugh?
Does Jim even realise how fucking pretentious it is to accept to do an interview and constantly go off on this nothing matters tangent every 10  minutes. He was a riot though and Norm bounces off him well.
Sucks to watch awkward  ,, my two favorite comedians .sucks to say but I really think Jim Carrey should stfu just every ounce Inna while  !! IMO
Carrey is pushing this nihilism rubbish but I get the feeling throughout this he needs the attention of the room constantly... Comes off pretty narcissistic tbh
If I was as rich as Jim, I would be a bum and all zen about my life as well. I bet if he was middle-class, he would not have the same attitude. I do like him, through...
Yeah woohoo my 2 favorite people Thanks you 2. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
cacao is just chocolate wtf is he rambling about
Nice
Unwatchable but still trying though 3rd attempt
See you next season, someday, somewhere.
Kevin Bacon!
NOPM MACDONALD\n\nPlease change that sign, Norm ;(
aye this on trending
Fucking evangelists
What a douche
He's a ducking nutcase
Hey, Jim.
Get fuckin bill burr
Dude is legit crazy.
Thank you, Norm for pronouncing forte correctly! =) xoxo
OMG
Yeah norm!
MacDonald just keeps on interrupting.
Jim Carrey keeps interrupting Norms good jokes with his own shitty slap stick stuff..
*40 Classic Films staring Jim Carrey*
Shaky conversation table/desk.\n\nPlease resolve.
Congrats norm, now you have herpes
Norm OMG please have me be the side guy I would kill it, but I need a certain amount of alcohol. Then seriously no joke I will gold in a witty crazy way
Nasa is a fraud.. earth is flat
I thought he was about to ride it tireless over a balcony or some crap
I think id rather aluminium bend than carbon fiber break in a stack and risk getting skewered  , picking the splinters out would be a bitch
at that point I would have fallen down the stairs. https://youtu.be/VfjjiHGuHoc?t=120
eBay description be like it has been taken good care of only used for a few hours
0:59 😮 I almost died of a heart attack \nSo risky
Imagine what the person person who invented bicycles would say
I wonder if jaws would Ollie that.. 1:55
They were just hoping he'd buy a set. They cost £5 million
Amazing the way Danny can throw around a full susp bike What forks does he ride?
This is a true run flat wheel!!

This hurt my soul.\nIf I owned a pair I would probably??? \nForget it all I can afford is watch you enjoy them lol
Welcome to hydraulic press channel. Today we are pressing this santacruz carbon wheel
It's strange seeing familiar neighborhoods on a viral video xD Makes me wonder if he'll make a high production trick video in Glasgow :)
I guess we don't need tires anymore
I'm sold
Que puta aviósote

Dont like carbon . love my Spank Tweet Tweet rims ^^ <3
The legend
Este tipo esta loco...
Ich kann mir das nicht angucken😑😓
when santa cruz watch ali Clarkson youtube channel
Carbon fiber is:\nApprox 10x stronger than steel.\nApprox 8x stronger than aluminum.\nWonders why it's (almost) impossible to break under normal circumstances.\nS M A R T
ffffffffffffffffffffffuck carbon . nightmear meterial when it comes to bicycle related impementations .remember people its cheeper just to cut wight of your self
Overpaid asshat destroys expensive garbage...please take my money. \n\nMan I love capitalism!
He still has suspension an probably a pretty good/soft one.\nI mean I dont wanna hate on Danny but this Test is easly to fake, especially when such a good Pro rider does it.
I call dibbs on the front wheel PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Come check my channel out guys new videos everyday
Biggest Casinos in world Where you can be lost for ever \nhttps://youtu.be/aKXOLJWiOwk
I wish he’d put pegs on and grind handrails. Or just ride a BMX. That’d be interesting.
So stupid. ..👎.
pls giveaway some bikes pls pls
Ciekawe ile by wytrzymała aluminiowa?
Not much surprising about this. Carbon is more resistant to deforming than aluminum. Its weakness is hard impact. Almost nothing here was hard impact, just sustained small impacts
Wheres the bmx version of this rim?
Will these also come in 20 for BMX ?,cause that would be even more mind blowin 🔥🔥
Yes! What else would I be doing?\n--I laughed so hard my mom was concerned about me
What else would I be doing!!! than watching jack and dean videos all day
Reminds me of an 07 - 08 YouTube. I have missed sketches like this. Nostalgic for me. glad I found this video
This was incredible! Also I'm always surprised by their accent lol why
The outro being parallel to the first shot was a nice touch. Lovely sketch!
Thank you for this 👌 content lmao
It took me so long to figure out it was Anna Akana's voice
Yo I'm new here, are they dating?
reminds me of spike jonze's Her
Should I be proud that jack & dean are on trending or concerned that 186K people watched a video about a man rubbing his dick against a computer??
this is the future millenials want
this is just the ultimate what the fuck video😂😂😂
Not the ending I was expecting.
Queue Bad Religion - I Love My Computer.
_I don't use Apple. I prefer Pear._
so the cult of apple has become a sex cult got ya.
That ending haha.. I just thought. He would be putting a usb in and out really fast..not fucking his computer haha
Watching your videos is always a bit wierd for me because my name is Dean and then to hear somebody say your name even though they aren't talking about you feels wierd.
Why is there Xmas songs in the background ?!
Check out my channel guys, subscribe if you find it interesting. THANKS!!!
Welcome to the world of tomorrow. ..
I can't believe this is #18 on trending!
and they say the perfect video doesn’t exist
WT FUCK IS THE END NO THERE IS A LINE THAT YOU CROSSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI might watch that again
What the actual fuck
If that last bit wouldn't be there then this video would have been amazing
Lol I don't know what I just watched, but my boyfriend said I can never pick videos again...he can't stop me xD
Holy shit this is great 😁😁😁
Am I the only one that felt genuinely akward during that exchange?
OMG 😱! Am I the only one who felt that response when the laptop said it's... Different, ahhh man, that's when hell would've broken loose for me!
The fact that Anna is in this video, even just as a voice, makes me hate it!
This is the best thing ever XD
It's .... different. *flashbacks to the ross and rachel break up scene*
I've never seen this video nor do i know about these guys, but from the thumbnail I could tell they were British. Great video 👍🏼
These guys deserve so many more subscribers!
It would've been funnier if you guys kept the whole reference implied. Once you start saying things like polyamourus and dick... It breaks the joke quite a bit.
Surely someone will give her the USB, she'd probably take 2 USB's at the same time at this point.
Finally a new video \nI luv it
Ok that last part was so wrong.
Is this a new episode of Black Mirror TV show?
Is anyone else watching this on the same model?? Got mine back in 2011, still been running pretty well to this day. And to be completely honest I love the plastic white over the silver aluminum, looks and feels just a whole lot nicer.
How stoned were you when you thought of this video idea?
This is how I feel with my ancient dell. It weighs like ten pounds, but I heft it around. Not because I can't afford it, but because sentimentality, and plus all my stickers are on this computer. :'(
This reminds me of Humans on AMC
I feel like there is some sort of subtext I'm missing. Lol
Words do not describe
I accidentally sent my film teacher this before watching it all the way through. I want to die.
This is spectacular. Possibly my favourite sketch yet.
Well I guess the other guy won’t be using his computer anymore... 😂
Oh my god I used to follow you guys when I was in high school, and I remember having dean such flowy hair. When this popped up on my feed it took a moment to realize who you two were and the nostalgia is so REAL right now. I just graduated university so all three of us can feel old u guys
Dean in the last scene, so hot!!
the last line made this perfect
I'm not drawing on chest hair!
what if jack opened the door on dean and the computer and dean just goes NOTHING' lmaoo
“After all, why have human interaction when you have dangerously overheating inanimate objects to keep you company.” -Troye Sivan
No, it’s not dodie’s flat. Daniel and Jack live in the same building. Same flat model.
It's so serious and funny at the same time
Someone get me a new OS install disk!!!
This was a weird but fantastic one, wasn't it.....................................................................................oh god what have I just watched..................
What even is this video?😂😂
Get out the room right now.. Out NOW!!... I have some things to discuss with her. Umm, I know I've been distant lately, but I can fix it don't worry yourself... Daddy's here You should have said something sooner  (umm...seems as if I got a little carried away)🤔 lol
I scream laughed at that ending!! Another hilarious vid!
I have the same model as Dean does... Now I'm more self-aware of my self-conscious computer.
Is this in the same world as 'Her' (2013)?
I'm 6 Gigs deep in that inbox
*I don't think they're talking about computers...*
XD I can't breathe
I heart Anna Akana
OMG! That is freaking hilarious!!
Oh uhm, wow 😮
*conscience
Thats really funny
Well I'm dead plz send flowerz
hahahahahahahahahhahahahaa
???
Disgusting wmaf trash with Anna the white worshipper
🤣
i need outtakes. give me outtakes.

BFR = Big F**king Rocket. Named after BFG (Big F**king Gun) from DooM videogames. Musk himself is a PC gamer.
elon musk is a reptile person!! and he got a weird name. i dont trust him. \nbesides, what is he going to do on mars, where there isnt enough magnetic field to protect us??\nevery1 knows Venus is the better option with its high altitude floating cities that would have earth like athmospheric presure, gravity and magnetic field.. one doesnt even need a space suit there, wich will reduce the cost. \nmars is a shithole.
1 hour anywhere in the world damn
Now here is a theory what if we were all born on mars and earth was the planet we would wanna go? mind blown!!
Like you old intro way more keep upp good vids thow:)) the old intro had a lottle bit of 90s touch to it:))
If anyone can do it Elon Musk can I wouldn't be surprised if he's coming back in time
and the best part is that BFR literally stands for Big F**king Rocket
Remember : If  you can't make it fake it !
Nothing is said about Van Allen rays/radiation and space suits to save any living beyond them. Something is big to happen during such time am afraid which would lead to jeopardising such so-called feats never to be achieved without establishing a suit which can withstand life beyond 7 layers of earth...which seems mind porn for future enthusiasts.
I could be the greatest achievement or the greatest failure.
Opening up airspace for nukes to just fly into our zone undetected an blow us all up
It would take Ten YEARS just to Build and Test that Spaceship; ain't NO Way it's gonna Happen by 2024 Folks.
wonder what they're gonna do when they get there and realise its already colonized
Not to be that guy, but what about the life support?
If the ufo's let you.
BFR, is lame, it wouldn't be annoying if it was FBR. It applies the adjective to the wrong word lol.
I saw you on a panel at vidcon. So glad I did, this is a fantastic Channel :)
Living in Mars is like to be in the worst prison! Besides, it's much cheaper to promote life on Earth. It's a shame to have 1/3 of the world population in hunger and another 1/3 dispose 30% of it's food or more to the garbage and deadening the oceans of fish, warming the planet, deprive of education the 3rd world population etc etc! Mars is a very expensive commodity! Science must solve earthly problems at this time frame. After that we can explore Mars!
Will people still practise religion on mars ? 😂
Of course it's possible and will happen eventually.
I believe that it will happen elon musk has proved to succeed time and time again, guys we are soon going to mars for holiday ;)
space x is the future
I'm definitely rooting for it! Though part of me still says we need to perfect things on earth, such as quality of life for those less fortunate
There is NOTHING on Mars which we don't have on Earth.Why not colonize Earth first? Just look at all those vast empty deserts waiting to be colonized.Colonizing Earth is much cheaper and is not restricted to an ELITE few well connected individuals.
I think we will go to Mars sometime between 2024 and 2040. That is still between our (at least my lifetime). There will be teething issues but they will be ironed out with subsequent attempts. As long as we don't add bureaucracy to these attempt we should be good.
Humans didn't land on the moon yet and they want to go to Mars
I’m sending my penis to mars to send DNA
What happened to climate change xD ?
Now Elon musk is one with the brain of all the smartest people in the world
Great channel but the music is so annoying. Please change it.
Didn't received notification..  Just felt in heart you uploaded new video ☺
With his new plan to send people to mars\nElon musk is the most creative serial killer of them all
2:34 UFO in the background
Red Faction should have been mentioned...
Musk is full of shit he hasn't even launched a man rated craft yet. He's going to kill a bunch of people.
Not until you solved all the problems faced on earth, Elon. You're saying it too early.
Great video mate! As always.
Last one on mars is a rotten egg
1985: There will be flying cars in 2017\n\n2017: Fuck that shit we going to Mars in 2024
Fix the Earth First
How about HD footage streaming from a camera on the moon 1st?
Coldfusion please create a new video on the space journey of humanity from 1969 till now
why would a brown eyed albino think he is invoted to mars? u got to be green eyes 6 foot 2 there are only 4 of us. #nasa
I believe he may miss the deadline but what it will do, it would force other company to step forward new technologies for the exploration of Mars and beyond.  I wonder why not do a colony in the moon then move to Mars.
Damn I thought it was that video where people asked elon musk what's its gonna feel like taking shit on mars
Elon Musk is great! He will does it for sure! Other just don't want to invest yet, but when they will se the benefits and see that is possible will rush to invest!
So what is the current solution to the drastic reduction of gravity on Mars and it's effects on the body over time?
Just wait till people on mars evolve into a separate species.
China will say they own Mars historically...
Bet there will be No Refunds or Returns on the tickets \nand no returns means back to Earth
Keeps saying shit when entry level model 3 is massively delayed
Watch my video to know more about Elon Musk.
I'm skeptical that it can happen so soon, but I definitely do believe we could be on Mars by 2060. I hope my skepticism is proved wrong.
Lol so in the future instead of the titanic it'll be a fuckin starship lmaooo!!!!
This guy is the IRL version of Tony Stark.
Great for Elon Musk sending people to Mars, they can't quit when they get tired of being exploited!
I think that it might be delayed due to some challenges but it will eventually happen
Mars?? ROFL! ! They haven't even been to the moon!
Holy balls! I say we pack Elon Money and this Cold Fecktard dude on a rocket and spank it to Mars - the Rust Planet. Good riddance. I'll stay here thanks. Oxygen? - Anyone?
Obviously NASA is out of ideas Aka lies so they have elon musk to take over with another dreamy cgi hoax of a planet that has only cgi imaginary fucking pictures. \nQuestion everything.
No rocket man will fuck it up
Wow, are we really talking about getting people on Mars in 2024 when President Trump finishes his second term?
People will still find a way to complain even if we can go anywhere on earth in less than an hour
I hope this will happen. This would be revolutionary. Even the rocket, it will change everything. Elon, I believe in you, and hope you will be successful.
There's no way the, fuel alone for even a suborbital flight on the BFR is enough to make a ticket at lewst tens of thousands of dollars.
Mars doesn't have any bottled water.
The considerably lower gravity should make human survival very difficult.
So if humans can colonise and live on a dead hostile planet... that means humans can also continue to live on earth if it ever becomes a dead hostile planet too.
😧\nI don't know why we want to go on Mars..!\nHow many of us visit our next door neighbor home to ask him How is he  / her.?\nNearly 1/2 of the world's population — more than 3 billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day. More than 1.3 billion live in extreme poverty — less than $1.25 a day. 1 billion children worldwide are living in poverty. According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty\nUntill we visit our neighbors in this world is it time to go on Mars or Moon or any other Planet..??? 😓
We going to hell 2024.with Alien Musk
Can you explain about space debris?
Great video. Thanks.\nTwo corrections:\n1. The revised BFR (introduced in Adelaide) is slightly smaller than the Saturn V. The old one (introduced in Mexico last year) was a little taller.\n2. The Max Ascend Payload is 150t NOT more than 4000t. That number would be the weight of the entire rocket, not the payload. If he could do that, he would probably call it the FBFR.
I would say around 2030-2045 humans will go to mars. Their is no way humans will go to mars in 2024.
Why am I uncomfortable by this? I couldn’t even watch the video for a second. I paused it at an ad. I think I just hate the future.:(
Are you sure it has raptor engines? I think it only has 6 engines this time
BFR Big Fuc..n Rocket
So awsome!
Mars???\n\n\n\nHell yeah!!!
The ‘big fucking rocket’
Mars.. we are coming :-)
BFR= Big Fucking Rocket\nI am sure Elon likes Doom :D
Mars looks lame
Nice hear we come
BFR.....Big F*cking Rocket?
Excellent
You are awsome!!! Tip; reduce treble. S sounds hurts. Otherwise awsome!
Lol ...the BFR ....the Big F’n Rocket!
What microphone does Coldfusion use?
Hahahaha!!! I'll check back on your dumbass 'BFR' in 2024...fruit loops
Elon 'Bottleneck' Musk....LOL.....
BFR stands for big fucking rocket fyi
Bull..
No Your not.
Bye bye bye! Leave us on smart people on earth!😀
Thunderf00t anyone?
I'm sitting here eating a cheesecake wondering which shows to watch next, while simultaneously Elon Musk is colonizing Mars.
And Trump thinks Mexicans/muslims are the threat...
Neighbor of 8 months said Paddock was a Trump supporter but also believes it's a setup since Paddock was a really nice guy and couldn't believe he'd turn out to be a monster.
That's a meme just need the school shooting theme and we good.
Congress responsible for these murders allowing guns to public.
They don't call Los Vegas Sin City for nothing..
Rest in peace all
Prayers to all of the people that have lost family🙏
How can someone do this.
Why is it always the white guy shooting crowds?
Rest In Peace To Everyone Innocent Who Was Killed At The Terrorist Attack At The Las Vegas Concert. 🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏 God Bless🙏❤️🙏
The fact that Jewish people didn’t have a strong enough form of the 2nd amendment is why they are not alive today. Keep the guns and god bless ‘merica
Excuse me USA, here's Italy. It's very simple, let me explain this in the easiest way possible: no guns, no shootings. Why are you trying to avoid mass shooting with more guns? Think about it in this way: how do you put a fire out? Certainly not with more fire. Think about it USA. Let me know if you need another explanation. I'll gladly help :)
The worst country in world
If he christian, he would be called atheism and politics aim. \nIf he muslim, he would be called terrorist. \nUSA logic!
CIA false flag to take away guns ........ oh and go to hell trolls.
Since he was white everything is fishy and conspiracy but if a person of color he is a terrorist good job America
Here's a tip, Stop going to events.
You guys will blame Muslims for it soon .
People mowed down by a leftist while chanting “god bless America”. Seems like liberals got an early Christmas present.
Who takes the professional pictures of these people and why?
Fake fake fake, false flag you guys need to do a better job!!
Welcome to America. Guess what nothing will be done. We all going to feel sorry, pray, help but our Congress will not stop gun control. What type of amendment is for  an individual  to have a semi auto machine gun for  protection?  20 mass shooting in 2/3 years alone. NRA profit on guns is more valuable than human life's right?  Smh, Welcome to America.
I'm betting right now that there will be a movie made about this, and it will star Mark Wahlberg
There no gun fire in China. only use knife to kill . more bloody…  Sorry about las Vegas . Horrible
I was at las vegas 3 weeks ago.
a Casino.. of Gambeling.. in USA 20 Trillion Dollar Debt.. bothersome
Politics is social. Change has to be individual. Politics don't really exist except that fools buy into it. Like putting a game in front of people you know will fight over it. \n\nGreetings everyone! I'm trying to start a music video channel here on YouTube but it's difficult to get seen. \n\nThe music is instrumental and may fall under categories ranging from mellow to rock to hip hop - but mostly a unique combination of them all. The videos are original and usually random - whatever comes to mind in the moment. \n\nI'm new to both video and music production so I will gladly acknowledge input from anybody willing to offer it. If you have the time, click my icon and let me know what you think. Thank you in advance, it's much appreciated!
False flag attack for the 500th time
To liberals down is up and if you follow that belief system to its logical end you end up in hell.
Everyone who makes it about race; you're justifying every time some criminal who is black shoots up a home in a drive by, someone else making it a racial issue rather than a criminal one.
*If you watch carefully a video posted by someone on YouTube, you can see what appear to be muzzle flashes coming from the second floor as well:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihkw_VFDzxo&t=0s
So trump can go to las Vegas but not to MX or PR Wtf dude PR is in a critical condition rn
My heart goes out to victims and families! RIP! This is disgraceful! All hotels need X-RAY software even hidden to sound silent alarms when someone walks inside with all these rifles. This can happen again if they dont prevent this using X-RAY silent mode software and agents.
Every country has got nut jobs. That's nothing special, it's all about access. When someone looses it in America they're able to purchase military grade weapons and kill 60 people. Who it is of what decent or religion is the narrative people apply after the tragedy has happened. So when people say they're glad the shooter was white instead of something else shows how far we are down the rabbit hole.
doesnt shelter in hotels seem like the wrong idea?
Guy made up almost half of Chicago gang shooting stats in 45 minutes.
What what in the butt butt
you can't get anyone to understand anything...\nand i think,\n.\nthat is the point.
Just another crazy crakkker doing what crazy crakkkers do...shooting their own kind PLUS killing kids at schools.
I wonder 1) how many % of crowd were White.   and 2)how many % of crowd were wearing Black cowboy hat.
The amount of retarded comments here make me cringe.
that man was lucky enough to killing so many people  <3
So sad so many innocent peoples lives taken#pray4vegas
the witness said there was single shots too hmmmm
I have no hate for Vegas #prayforvegas   but go ans see muslims of borma there ils nothing to say about that and nothing we can do sry for bad english god be with u vegas
I would have got the fuck out of their
Kenny is the AahilaaayJacke Lottmeor center of a few Sorry for the same time as well as the same time as well as the
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. THE PATH IS NARROW AND VERY FEW PEOPLE FIND IT!THE STRONG DELUSION THAT GOD SENDS IS SUNDAY CHURCH SERVICE, AS WELL AS THE PRIDE OF LIFE.PEOPLE WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO THEIR PASTOR THEN LISTEN TO GOD. EVERLEARNING IN CHURCH INSTITUTIONS AND NEVER KNOWING JESUS. NEVER HEARING THE FATHER VOICE.Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons DIDNT WE ATTEND CHURCH but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven.REPENTANCE,OBEDIENCE AND LOVE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. THE CHURCH IS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THEY ARE NOT IN THE INSTITUTIONS. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!! ACTS 7:48\n\nBE YE SEPARATE FROM THE WORLD!! BE YE SEPERATE FROM THE LOVERS OF THIS WORLD!
This is a terrible event, my condolences to relatives, I want the wounded people to recover as soon as possible. #prayforvegas
False flag operation
DAMN, IT WAS RAINING BULLETS
美國不安全，你們應該禁止槍支，保證你們的人權。
Praying for you
难怪外国人少呢
I hear firecrackers
What about porter ico??
I mean freind
Fooking pussies
this is crazy
inc gun ban
:/
So much violence seems to be directed toward Southeners lately... The Chattanooga soldier killings, the fire at the resort in Tennessee(They still don't know who did it), The Scalise shooting, the recent church murders in Antioch, Tn (near Nashville), and now this...was it directed at a special  kind of music lover?  Isis says Paddock joined them several months ago, but it hasn't been confirmed.
American Christian terrorist
Random 64 year old white guy with no criminal background, no history of mental illness and was a friendly man got a hold of 23 rifles and randomly shot into a crowd of people. Seems very fishy, Remember not to take whatever you see on the news as the narrative, think for yourself.
HOLY SHIT, yall Americans need to be friends with russia atm yall mfs need help yall gon die without help with that shit Yall need to evacuate rn! \n\n(Edit) that wasn’t a racial comment all my peoples is my peoples love you guys but seriously yall need to do something about that
Why does this always happen on my birthday
Watch & wait! The girlfriend in the Philippines has more than a little involvement in this!
I hope everyone are doing good in heaven🙏😘❤️
Why cant we have some dignity for     the lives lost and not release videos like this ...
How to increase your wealth...\nhttps://youtu.be/FcX5DPy6vMA
had no previous convictions,you have to be convicted it does not mean he hadn't committed a previous crime/s pure evil!!!
All the other kids better run better run! Faster than my bullets!
Another psycho on prescription drugs. Keep taking your drugs and vaccines sheep
Can someone please explain why there is absolutely no blood or dead bodies in any YouTube video I've seen??????? I've seen people running and screaming.  I've seen people being carried by others,  but not a single sign of blood or anything. This is one strange mass shooting.
For all you people claiming this is a terrorist attack, you're completely fucked up. Do research before commenting. Terrorist attack is when the motivation is a religious belief or something this is just some bs guy probably going through depression and decided to kill without a reason.
America has 5% of the world's population but accounts for 30% of total gun deaths.
white terrorism!!!!!
No noticing that witnesses reported multiple shooters?....
Fake!
Lol
Fake shootings everywhere.
USA is such a evil country.....full of evil people.
Alrighty, let's take a vote for something that's absolutely not debatable the will hopefully get both sides of people to agree. CRACK DOWN ON GUN SMUGGLING. The only true unbiased way to see if shooters will get their guns legally is to crack down on all illegal transactions taking place in drug dens. Making legal guns harder to get is one thing, but I think ALL OF US should be able to agree to CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL WEAPONRY.
pray for Vegas
This is very heart breaking for family members to witness the death of their own. When I heard that he was going to kill people during life was beautiful, I was completely shocked because one of my own was going over there. However, we have to see the bright side of things. These things happen every day, and that is how life is now. We have to take advantage of this. This is a learning experience. Stop saying things and start doing things. Also, I don't believe Isis did this. They claim every attack and it is quite annoying for Muslims because they are always the ones to be blamed and I think that we should be sorry.
Nobody thinks this is suspicious or a little odd doesn't add up
JUST MORE FAKE NEWS..\nNobody died,stop with your Soros funded Vigil's and paid crisis actors!
Just another day in the usa.
More like 59 dead, and 515+ injured...
Why are the authorities showing the VIDEO SURVEILLANCE footage from the Hotel hallways showing the gunman toting all the weapons into the room..?  THERE IS NO REASON they can't show that.  It has no negative effect on the investigation whatsoever.  So........BLOOD in any photos of victims........and NO HOTEL FOOTAGE of gunman carrying in weapons.\nHMMMM...........amazing.   NO EVIDENCE this guy did anything at all.  Yet they tout him as the shooter.  I'm not buying it.
I wish trump was the only one to get hit with all them run
Dont think one man can injure or kill that many people in min.\nMos def tbe sound of more than one gun goin off...GOVERNMENT ORCHISTRATED!!
God bless all involved in this horrific incident..but in all the videos that have shown the Hotel where the shots were coming from, I’ve  seen no muzzle flash from the machine guns which would be clearly visible at night.
I'm don't care! They deserved it! I hate Americans because they think all brown skinned individuals are terrorists, I'm disrespected and mocked on a daily basis. It's so ironic that a white man was the mass murderer.
a hoax !! show me a video of them being shot ?!
Look, if you're not going to do anything about it, then shut the fuck up cause this is the norm. At this rate, more will die because of retarded gun jack offs. Good job gun jack offs, you should be celebrating your auto weapons that killed 59 people. Keep your prayers and thoughts, it's retarded excuse. Just another republican terrorist.
Maybe we should just destroy all the humans, that would solve everything
Trump did this
Look at the double standards of you programmed sheeps. When they lied about him being muslim your attitude was worse than pigs. Now that they've confirmed they were wrong, you say nothing! Hypocrites!\n\nAll of you are programmed sheeps  they control you.  You're slaves to the media. You believe the lies they tell you and hate the wrong people you cockroaches!
Not a drop of blood eh ?
I love how cozy your vidoes have been recently.
I loved the video, Amelia! You looked absoultely stunning with just mascara, you should do it more often! Also your answers were really nice, you seem like a really down to earth kinda person - very lovely!

I really enjoyed this laidback video :) Especially you answering the “work” questions:) Now my question may seem weird, but I’ve been reading so much about this so I’m curious about your thoughts: Why don’t you have business account on Instagram?

Loved the vid! And the relaxed vibes / look on you is so gorgeous and glowing!
I love your minimal make up in this video! You look beautiful! If you do a part 2 can you talk about what your parents do for a living and what your childhood was like in London?
I haven't watched a video of yours in a while, they haven't caught my eye, but this one was great! It flew by and I found everything you said really interesting.
Love this casual and chatty video!!
Love this video, you are so great!!!
I loved the vibe of the video ....especially how you were sitting. learned a lot!! of course love you more now ❤❤❤❤
Would love to know more about your Religious beliefs! X
I love this video , thanks for being so honest and real 😘please do a part to , would love to know how you got into YouTube ?  Xxxx
Really interesting to hear about your work and how you make a living. You sound very passionate about it. Would love to learn more about how you ‘do business’ and how hiring people to help you has allowed you certain freedoms or the ability to fast track or grow your blogging.
Can't wait for the Vlogs!!😘😘❤️❤️
Know I would love to see your mum speak Arabic 😍
Love your real ness ! Do another video if you can. 😘
loved this video!!! thanks for answering re: earning on youtube!
Thank you for the honesty Amelia ! I also wanted to share that as soon as you said that you come from everywhere I knew you had to Middle Eastern. I feel like middle easterns have been so shamed over the past decade that they ended up believing (myself included) that they should be ashamed of where they come from and that being Middle Eastern makes you less valuable to others. It is so sad. I am both lebanese and canadian. When friends used to ask me where i reaaaally come from, I used to be so ashamed and I used to make up pretty stupid lies to say that I was italian. Looking back at it now, I am so proud to be lebanese. I am also proud to be canadian. And whoever treats me differently after knowing where I reaaally come from is the problem. They're what's wrong, not me. LOVE LOVE :)
I liked this! It was really sweet. Hope you have a lovely week 😊
Great video....you look so much prettier with minimal makeup
cool! loved learning more about you!
Thanks for being so open and honest with us! That's why I love your videos - you seem so genuine!
I love this video Amelia!!!1 Please do a part 2.
I love this video! I think my favorite of yours 😊
I just love you? you're so dorky and funny <3
I could watch you chatting for hours!
absolutely loved this video and seeing a personal side of you! please do more like this :)
Omg I just love Amelia you're just the best
I would love if you shared your Persian rice recipe!
Loved this!! So nice to see you and thanks for sharing with us!! I love that you are so open and brave about sharing your life! We appreciate it and feel like you’re a great chum! ❤️ Thanks and keep up the amazing content!! ❌⭕️
You should go to Beirut you would love it ! 💕
Loved the video !!  (but i do feel guilty about it, like i don't want you to feel like you have to answer such personal questions)
Really appreciated your honesty here. I know how the YT community tends to stray away from 'taboo' questions such as these. And please keep us updated with 23andMe! Been wanting to try it myself for years!
Amelia i have been asking when are you gunna do a youtube how to wash hair tutorial video and never and havent gotten any response back
I love this video! 😍😍😍 You're so sweet, honest, funny and cute! It takes a lot to expose oneself to the public eye and judgement but you managed soooo gracefully to show us how truly genuine you are and how caring about your family and passionate about your work 💖💖💖\nI love how you spontaneously chat with us and make us feel your friend and confident (same reason I adore you instagram lives😍). \nLove you Amelia 💖💖💖💖💖💖 You truly are an inspiration and I wish you all the best in the world because you simply deserve it 😘😘😘
lol i just love how people say where ur really from without realizing that thats not a thing. ask heritage, easier and not as offensive
Absolutely love the chilled vibes and openness in this video Amelia ❤️
I thoroughly enjoyed this video. I've been following you from the early days and this is one of my favourite videos. Looking forward to the DNA video!! x
what NAIL POLISH COLOR are you wearing??? its such a perfect in between pink!
Please do a part 2! I could have easily watched a 30 minute video of this!
I would love to win your giveaway 😍😍
i knew it i knew it. you have the Persian/arabic vibes lol
I swear I'm not green-screened onto this: it's just weird lighting!
I'm guessing Fermat's Last Theorem is one such case.
Wtf...I was just on one of these a few hours ago. Now I'm seeing this vid. What a coincidence
Basel is a port city. In Switzerland. Which means that Switzerland has a merchant marine.
It's a water kite.
What if Thomas Edison thought of this unknown, obvious idea that was proposed at the end of the video on his deathbed and never got to spread the news?
I've been on one of those but it's made for cars. (New Zealand) It was the only way across the river unless you want to drive for ages to the next bridge as it was in the middle of nowhere. It's pretty cool how it's the only way across if you forgot to go across the bridge 10kms back.
It works the same as a sailboat in many ways.  In this case, the water pushes, and a cable holds the boat steady in one direction, causing it to go sideways.  On a sailboat, the wind pushes, and resistance against the (hopefully non-moving) water holds the boat steady in one direction (sailboats can't move sideways easily, only backwards or forwards because of their centerboards/keels and hull shape), causing it to go sideways to the wind (or whatever direction you want).
That is really good design
Wow that was interesting.\nThank You
I grew up near the Danube River, next to ferries like this. They are a bit like sailing but on a current not the wind. Clearly a smart idea. And back in their times a good investment, I guess.
I got one just outside my house
If we can sell pizzas with tomato sauce spread over them then why not toast with butter already spread?
There is one near Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.
How do other tall boats not hit the overhead cable?  Also, I'm reading that there are floating cable reaction ferries.  Even more of an issue for boats going up or down the river.
Have you thought of doing a video about that slice of  Germany inside Switzerland?
You also need a river that you can string a wire a cross that isn't going to be snagged by tall ships. Probably wouldn't work on the Thames.
Wow tom is on trending, I'm shocked
You‘ve been to my town and haven‘t told me? To shame!
This technique is used in kayaking - it's called the 'ferry glide'.
Isn't this the same principle that yachts use to sail against the wind (tacking)?
Dude, bummer! Would've been great to meet you, since I live there.
Thank you for all the videos. Very much enjoyed and appreciated.
Oh I think there's plenty of room left in all of time to make a few more interesting ideas come to life....
COME TO LAUSANNE BABY WE HAVE SCIENCEY STUFF
You should do a video on the Theory of Inventive problem solving. A Russian engineer spent his entire life studying patents to see how humans made solutions to stuff like this. It's now generalized into a few charts, and is really quite handy.
Thats incredible! How has someone not applied this concept for electricity generation I wonder?
Ah, thank you for this Tom. =)
Interestingly a very similar technique in kayaking and canoeing is called ferry gliding.  Forward paddling and or momentum are substituted for the wire
I hope they got a license from the Fine Bros.
Female phychology. There must be something obvious to it since it affects more than half the world population but we still haven't figured it out.
As a kayaker we do this all the time, it's even called Ferrygliding. The only difference with a kayak is that you have to keep paddling upstream.
Wow im amazed how fast flowing the rhine is compared to something like the Thames
It's an obvious idea to someone who sails sailing boats, basically it's just using the water currents rather than air currents to sail by ;)
I loved how, in addition to the usually informative video this one was also inspirational. Great job Tom. Thank you.
The 26 dislikes are from people who hate free energy. Shell I suggest any names?
Powered boats can do this too.  They can motor up against the current to match the speed of the current.  That way they can be stationary with the land and yet move sideways!  It can help manoeuvre in tight spaces (Though very few skippers seem to know how to do it, despite its simplicity and usefulness).\n\nFunnily enough, it's called ferry gliding!  And now I know why :)
Wow you are in Basel! Thats where i live xD
Maybe there is still some big, obvious-in-hindsight stuff out there that will change the world, just as soon as someone thinks of it\n\n[thumbnail for rotary jails video appears]
`Light Bulb moments `have been the reason for human dominance on this huge free floating  Molten rock
Its sailing in the water stream. Near Dresden in Rathen is a bigger feary that uses the same technice
y do you keep coming to Switzerland without telling me!!
...and Nile boats use a combination of wind and water flow to go upriver and down...\n...and-yes my fifth-grade observation about electromagnetism overrides Maxwell's...
There are other surprising pre-electrical means of transportation in the Alps. For example water-balanced funiculars - such as the one in Fribourg, Switzerland. Both cars have a water tank, and the upper one gets filled up, while the bottom one is drained, whenever the cable car needs to move. The inbalance and gravity does the rest.
Since you are in Switzerland are you going to visit CERN? It's only 2 hours by car from there :)
We used to have hundreds of these in British Columbia. I assume they probably died out here because of safety concerns. We used to have car-sized wooden suspension bridges too.
Tom, I swear to God, this is the second time you were in Switzerland and I missed you again (last one in Zurich) by probably about a week or so! Next time you post something hinting there on Twitter or elsewhere, I will move heaven and earth and whatever else to meet you. Or at least try to give you a video idea via mail and getting you where I am so I can contribute.
Wow. That is so cool. I would never have had that idea. But so obvious when you see it.
There are several reaction ferries in Canada that carry cars.
IT'S CALLED PETROL TOM >:( but these boats are rather cool
Using warmth 20 meters underground via some conducting material to prevent train switches or other critical infrastructure from freezing over. \n\nSo obvious, but I dont think its done anywhere.
That's like the guy who floats down the river to work instead of driving 😊 I love simple solutions that use natural reusable energy
Sadly, thinking about is not enough, sharing the knowledge and people with a need that search for a solution is a must\nI think this relationship is what really changed the world, but today, with the tsunami of data on the internet, very few actually study something, and the rest have all the incentive to keep secrets and patent them since their livelihood usually depends on it\nso, cutting edge knowledge is a commodity and old knowledge is buried amongst irrelevant and sometimes wrong info and as a result get overlooked
When I was at Switzerland, I was stoned by clarity of Rhine in Bern... That river is something that I can not easily understand...
It's like a kite using water instead of wind.
I there some sort of meet up? I live in Basel!
I actually live just next to such a ferry. The one I can see from my window is much bigger and can load 10 cars or so. It is really fascinating, but I just don't like it for commuting because here the ferry has no scheldue, and waiting about half an hour can be quite annoying. Glad I only enjoy it on Sunday trips or so. Great video.
i didn't understand the principle  could somebody please explain it?
There are a few of those in the Netherlands as well, I believe, although they look like normal ferries and the cables run underwater, not above it. If memory serves me. And maybe they've been disposed of already.
Omg i was on the exact spot you stood there in Basel a few weeks ago!
I am sure there is one at Symonds Yat
We have a reaction car ferry in McLure, British Columbia, that will take a few cars at a time across the North Thompson.  It can't run when there's ice on the river or during spring flooding.
ah I'm so sad. I live in Basel but I'm on vacation right. so sad to miss you :(
That is a interesting thing to think about. \nIf you live in a place where the conditions for something like this doesn't exist, you'd never think about it. You'd never think to even look it up. \nA thing you don't know you don't know.
Read about another Swiss project recently. There's a mine in the mountains, and the ore (or whatever it produces) is transported down to the valley in trucks that use the weight to produce electricity on the way down, which is more than enough to drive them up the mountain again when they're empty.
How do you get 50 fps video?
I was so shocked when I saw your video because I am from Basel
Clever Bavarians recently replaced one of theese by a gasolin driven one. The old one has sunken due to the lag of maintanence...
It kinda works like sailing, but the wind is replaced with water flow and the resistance from the water is replaced with a cable.
Theres one of these on the River Severn at Hampton Loade, near Bridgnorth, but it hasn't run at all this year.
The obvious thing we still haven't invented is slood. It comes after fire, but before the wheel. Except we missed it.
If you kayak this is the same principle as in ferry gliding.
So how, exactly, is this different from sailing ships tacking? Still a clever idea, but I bet that if tom had experience on a sailboat this wouldn't be that innovative of an idea. Just an example of specialized knowledge.
A movie I saw as a child in the 1950's showed a scene with one of these craft being used in Florida at a time before railways, automobiles and air conditioning had made it hospitable for people from cooler climates to want to go there despite alligators and hurricanes.
I live in switzerland! And it works nicely!
Someone tell me why Thoughty2 has more than double the subscribers to Tom Scott?
better than tesla's auto drive
Haha, nice!
It's basically a kite. A water-kite, but the principle remains.
Just, bloody hell.

Can you explain how cell phones and cell towers communicate at high speeds? Like on the motorway? (Does some of the signal get lost behind?)
Pretty sure humans have been pulling themselves across rivers using rope or wire one way or another for a few thousand years...
Wait, how do you get back? I saw some dude pull a level to the other side of the boat. how does that change the direction of the boat?
There is even simlper solution to this - not from user point of view but mechanical - the cable that connects boat to the main cable is in one corner of the bow and when you want to drift to the other river bank, you just mount the cable to the other corner and boat just steers itself.\nYou dont need any moving part like the steering lever.

Dude October 3rd is my birthday
@Binging with Babish My brother, Michael Chapa, has been a fan of yours for a long time. In fact he is also the one who introduced me to your channel. I would like to buy him a signed book.... is there any way I can get this? Please and thanks!\n\nAlso can people thumb up so he might see this comment?
Wow damn dude this is a great idea/book. \nLove the cover art!!!!
My birthday is Oct 3
http://huredrhjto.bid/8711966267852/
I have the best cook book ever. It's called the internet. I can learn to make anything. So I will save my money and instead of buying some dumb cookbook I'm gonna buy some groceries.
I AM SO READY TO BUY THIS BOOK \nHopefully there's an audiobook too cuz I could listen to your monotone voice for hours
Got an email from Amazon today saying that my pre-order has been delayed. No shipping date currently available. :(
Amazon told me it was delayed... I pre-ordered this like a week after he first announced it. Why has it been delayed if it hit bookshelves?
Any word on what's going on with the Amazon delay?  Preordered the day it went live, and Amazon has NO idea when it's gonna ship.
Soooooooo got an email today saying that the delivery of the cookbook had to be pushed?  Is there any say when they new delivery date will be? Just wondering.  Looking forward to receiving my copy!!!!!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Why are people calling him a sellout? What’s wrong with trying to make money by doing the same job in a different way?
Really disappointed that I pre-ordered months ago and am now being told I won't even get it until November if not later. Rather poorly handled book launch.
Amazon is now saying my preorder from August won’t ship until November 😭😭 This was supposed to be my birthday present to myself!
I'm buying this. Ive perfected cooking hot pockets and totinos pizza's so now is the time to take my cooking to THE NEXT LEVEL!
Do ship to Australia
Sdg jazz
Props man! Love your channel!

I ordered it back in August but Amazon seems to have failed me on delivering it in time. RIP
Just bought your book. \nIt's out of stock.  Do you know when I'll be getting it?
wait, does it mean anyone who pre-order the book can have the signature or have the chance to win the signature?
He's out of stock!!! Nooooooo
tbh for the pre orders u should stick the books in the envelopes and the signed one mix them up and lable them so you send them out with no clue to who the winner is XD
When to get book realized it was already out of stock
Preordered it a while back, can't wait to get it! Congrats!
Im super excited, preordered this for my dad almost 2 months ago. Cant wait for it man, loved basically every dish youve made on here
Preordered it a few weeks ago, and now I’m seeing ‘sold out’ on Amazon, with no estimated ship date. Looks like demand surpassed supply by a long shot.

Noo. I wanted to see the performance
Why end the video like this? I feel sad...
This has acctually made me feel nervous from just watching it
love him so much +x !!! it is lovely to see that despite the fact that he is a superstar, he has undenying love for his family.  Specially love the part where he cutely fights with his sister. Plus i love the part where he has to stand on his bag to close it.  But I hate the cliffhanger !!!
Make a video on how you dj and how you mix songs .. please
Dua and martin would low key make a great couple
I wish someone would look at me the way Dua Lipa looks at him 3:55
We want So Far Away ASAP

Whats the song name at 0:33?
Cliffhanger.....why the end be a cliffhanger 😭😭
Hate how they stretch these things out...
Why did you left the suspense at the last @MartinGarrix bro ?
Some dumb asses think they can become Martin by watching Martin Garrix show.
Longer blogs were definitely better in my opinion. Much more exciting to sit down and get lost in Garrix's world for 30-40 mins a few times a year, then 5-10 mins every week.
Martin this was fu***king amazing but last what happened
I here only for the DUArtin lipaRRIX ❤💛💚💙💜
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MARTIN GARRIX
I'm in love with all the hard work you and your team make every single day❤Keep changing the world with your amazing music! Do what you love, always here for you. I hope I can get to talk with you one day! I've a GREAT IDEA to tell you, my twitter is @peque2111 in case you want to contact me!

Who's waiting for next Season from now
Martin I love you dude 💕❗ I wish to meet you one day and be your friend for the rest of my life that would be great :)
Martin and Dua's friendship is amazing. They are nice to each other but with me and my friends we pull pranks talk across the room in our secret language and roast the teacher, but he gets his payback. And honestly he is my favorite teacher so far
Like when you want martin garrix to go to your country, but remember that your show is in the capital and not in your city.
Why the show stop there , I am so nervous about this
Martin should do a song with Lana Del Rey
dude, you can't end it like that!

Love a toddler haul!!
Can't wait to have kids so I can shop for all the cute baby/toddler clothes 😊
*I'm watching this like I have a child and want inspiration for children's clothing 😂*
Dina you will get white hair early enough, enjoy your brown hair damn -_-
I love baby clothes, they are so cute. I CAN'T. 😍😭
I got the grey polka dot hoody for my 2 yr old and sooo want one for my self! She loves it, perfect oversized hoody. Morrison’s do great clothes and they’re funky! You should go there..their bakery section is amazing too!
Girls clothes are a billion times better than baby boys
Ya you pay the same price for your jacket but your jacket has much more material because it's larger and it will last you a lot longer then hers! I hate how my kids clothes is so expensive I'm like come on their clothes takes way less fabric to make! And they will only wear it for 6 months max!
Selam Aleykum! MashAllah you are very blessed. Was wondering if you would ever consider giving Hanna's old clothes to other families who have more so a low income than the average family. Would be extremely helpful but who knows, might be far fetched.. thanks!
Omg i want that animal top!!!
Y don't u show ur daughters face
is a quid and pound the same thing?
I just wanna put it out there for cat owners :\n let your cats eat grass when they want to because it contains (Fer) which is good for their digestion but almost none of cat food that we buy has it
You are a lovely mum Dina <3
You should really start a kids clothing line Dina, I reckon it would be really fun and interesting.
Personally I have a few pairs of Zara jeans and I recommend them for other men.
Neeeed a 'Hana's look book' asap
My daughter is 9 months, an I have been mix matching her clothes with boys 😊 the best combination to purchase. Because not all girls clothes are nice. Especially when they are all pink. So annoying right!? 👍🏽gray choice Dina.
Mama got a good taste! :)
YES!!!Would LOVE a Toddler Clothing Line by you 😃😀😁😊👟👕👚😇👶👼
How are there more clothes in this haul for hanna than I have ever owned😂
Does Hana still wear bodysuits? I'm wondering how long my toddler should wear it for.
you dyed your hair blonde! u reminded me of Ascia from the hybrids channel 😍😍
Love zara, not so much this particular haul... loved the grey polka dot hoodie though!
Love you Dina...but the color of your hair...:(
@DinaTokia I realllllllllllyyyy dot mean to be mean butttt your clothes for Hanna doesn't look um all that but ILYSM so don't get offended
What did she do on this teeth ? They changed but I don't know what is différent (I supposed they are more perfect but is not natural ) she look like Willy wonka 😐
Stupid nozy woman!
Love it
She reminds me of marina Joyce
Just saw your New mom vlog were you say you made Hannah an e-mail and use it to send her mails that she can read in the future. Im just curious do you still do that? ^_^
I have a two year old too!!! They are much funnier to dress now ! Definitely always want her clothes to wear 😍😍😍
I literally want every single piece of clothing that you showed for myself, and I am 24 years old...
Lol why the video title change ? £160 ish on kids clothes? Wooowwwww NOT
My cat hates your intro. Adore you, but fucking hell it’s loud.
U took forever to do this
Nice to see a fellow brit
Omg dina you have just had the best idea for your next range! Please please do big kids clothes I'm so jealous of my daughters clothes! Ps: so glad you shop for her in the boys section too. People think I hate pink, I don't, I just think there are a lot of other colours that she can also wear. 🌈
Love your lobster sweater, which brand is it?
She just launched a new trend , toddler clothing haul
I just received that wonderwomen jumper this morning for my toddler and she already has that grey coat 😭😂😂😂
you look awesome with that hair colour
hanna is nearly 2 now ohhhh my god time flies so fast 😩😭💗
I need to look for trendy farm clothes for my cousin 😂
i just abruptly said calm your tits down mate as soon as Dina said HI GUYS coz it was damn loud with headphones! still love it though 😁
React to clothes that grow with your child
Get sid to record a video on hana’s shoe personalization!!
Omg that toddler clothing line is such a good idea... you really should do it dina! 😍😍
FEEDBACK: Try to look more into the lens, Dina!
U have so much money to splurge over a toddler clothing and from zara! Adopt me pls
Yes.do a collection for adults inspired by todlers.
did you dye your hair yourself or did you go somewhere? love it though!! xx
I bet Hana is the most trendy kid in daycare
I feel like the hi guys gets louder every time 😂😂😂
Dina hair is perfect! She literally look like an angel with this new color! I bet it gorgeous in full! What a great mom doing shopping for her child
PLEASE DO YOUR BIG KID STORE I WOULD BUY EVERYTHINGG KIDS CLOTHES ARE THE BEST
Hana is so much better dressed than I am
Zara kids clothes are always 3 sizes too small! Kmt
You need to do a look book for kids,Hana can be your model😍💕
I seriously want one of everything lol. So cute and funky!

*THIS IS HOW WE DO IT DOWN IN PUERTO RICO*
PR has no votes in the electoral college, so it will take a long time for help to come
Any chance that at least for individual homes they could put in solar? Sounds like the power grid is not returning any time soon. sigh.
Talk about an easy PR win. Send in the Army Corp of Engineers and undertake a project like we haven't done in decades. It's what made us great ya know.
Puerto Rico is the U.S side chick who is always asking for money but damn is she thick 😍
Puerto Rico gets over 21 billion dollars annually from the United States government. Their citizens do not pay personal federal income tax but still get the 21 billion in aid. They on average pay 2.1 billion to the United States treasury annually. Think about it. They have 3,676,141 people who do not pay personal federal income tax yet they get 21 billion in aid annually. That's about $5.984.00 per person each year given to Puerto Rico. Fees and other taxes paid to the United States comes to about $571.00 per person annually. Where does the other $5,413.00 per person per year go? \n\nPuerto Rico also has what is called a Commonwealth tax. This is like state taxes in the rest of the United States. No figures are available that I could find on what they collect. But with getting $5413.00 per person in federal aid and being able to collect their own taxes where has all the money gone? \n\nWell most goes to its own government which employs about 25% of the population. They also own the electrical power systems. Though they do not charge government agency's for electricity. Things like Giant floodlighted stadiums, the largest water park in the Caribbean, and an ice skating rink all owned by the Puerto Rico government and paying nothing for their electricity. Could you imaging what it cost to run an ice rink in the Caribbean? Basically it is their government that is sucking them dry with payroll, expenses, and  government pensions.\n\nThe island has more than $72 billion of debt — nearly 100 percent of its total annual economic output — and an estimated $30 billion shortfall in its state pension fund. This is before the storms. People this did not happen over night. Their local government has done this to them for the last 75 years. When things go bad everyone like to point the finger at someone else but they need to take responsibility for this one.
They should all just come to mainland us. Plenty in ny anyway
Geez I live in Georgia and Irma barely touched us but took out my power for 3 days which felt like a year. Hopefully they will be ok.
I'm very sad right now.  My parents are there suffering.
http://lifestraw.com/\nThese would be a big help. A straw that purifies water...genius.
can you do political relations history between us and puerto rico or something similar ?
Trump: We gotta get rid of North Korea... They're a threat... a big threat... the biggest... The pacific is only a hop and skip away...\n\n*After Puerto Rico Crisis*\n\nTrump: We cannot send supplies over the large, big ocean.... it's a yuuuge ocean, the biggest, and I'm telling you... it's yuuuge, never seen anything like it, water, so much water... there's water everywhere... too much water... we can't help them... can't cross the YUUUUGE water... did you know that there's water underground <Begin Rant to avoid question>
Lmao  cocky ego Puerto Ricans say they're the best when clearly these fuktartds can barely support themselves...
50% of Americans still don't know that Hillary and the DNC lost the last election.\n\nLiberals always believe the world could be so much better, if only SOMEONE ELSE cared a bit more. Their reservoir of hypocrisy deflection and blame certainly never runs dry.
Its because they have been broke for years from thei corrupt internal government.  NOT TRUMP you stupid ignorant idiots commenting and blaming him.  Educate yourselves and quit watching all these fake ass celebrities and left wing talk show hosts on feeding you their bullshit.  Their mayor is a complete idiot and has done jack to help the economy with her greedy ass.  You can wake up ignorant, but can learn so you dont go to bed stupid.
Puerto Rico is not quite a rich port. It's fallen to the standards of the surrounding islands and what quality it does produce leaves on first chance to the mainland..
Vox is cancer. I pity those who get their info from these morons.
Obama: We need to help these fellow Americans.\nTrump: Lol bye
Tax cuts created jobs, removing them caused the jobs to leave... That is so weird (it isn't).
Too many ppl are unaware that Puerto Rico is US territory.
The tornado wouldn't have happened if everyone in Puerto Rico had guns
But they're in other place
So its our fault that puerto rico gave tax breaks and adding an amendment to their constitution that creditors will be paid first. Its time they accept their responsibility, i am all for helping but i like how they used the loopholes and are in deep financial crisis and expects for even more money from us mainland. I agree they are our fellow citizens but they need to take responsibility of their financial crisis and whatever trump said about money is crap we need to help them first and then immediately sort their financial mess.
They can't vote nor pay taxes to America and in great debt. Trump don't want to help for these reasons.
Make it a state!
Puerto Rico may never recover because last year they began going through a financial crisis
@vox Next time you are making a video covering natural disaster impact in specific regions. *PLEASE* include the local charities/organisations at the end of the video to help them gather funds.\nThanks!
I theorize Puerto Rico will sink. So does my cat in my picture
At least the UK did well with most of it's commonwealth countries and continues to do so unlike the US. This shows how much the US really cares.
Please update with what Tesla has done to help.
This video is more biased than well researched.
Jones Act is hard on Hawaii too.
Disgusted that Our President is talking about the amount of deaths now, but if we don't do something right now that number is going to rise. What do our countryman do? I don't have answers but maybe we should evacuate the island completely let Wall Street rebuild/foreclose or whatever they do. And when everything is up and running our countrymen can move back. I couldn't go camping for longer then a week let alone months. Prayers to all.
Why is a place like Puerto Rico not solar and wind powered by now?
An aging power supply mismanaged by  democrats. Improper preparation by democrats. Democrats are at fault.
@Nasty FingurZ I dont see any sources from what you say in fact... It Just sounds like opinion
Despacito, this is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
How bout a PR Green Electrification Project similar to the US Rural Electrification Project in the f'n 1930's? Why no mention of green energy alternatives in this presentation and so few in the comments? Please stop simply following these mis-leaders. THINK 🤔 ... GREEN 🌱.\n\n: ) > -
To the government you're just a number on a piece of paper.
all puertan ricans should sell their homes to retirees and just move to the mainland, they will be better off
3:35 so that's where our old rocking chair went..niceee
So Vox points out a problem and doesn't offer information for things people can be doing to help? No donation link in the description? Not even a mention of it in the video? *If you can, please donate to organizations like UNICEF, United For Puerto Rico, Save The Children, etc. who are working to help PR. (More can be googled.)*
Sorry your information is wrong. Puerto Rico is corrupt not cause of the relationship with the United States. It's because of the corruption with the political system is the reason why the country is corrupt. Get the info correct before posting your videos please!
1:47 true
Solar, Battery and Musk to alleviate?
im not gunna watch but im gunna assume Vox blames trump yet again
no mention of Fortuno fleecing the island for millions. No mention of financially illiterate people screaming for tax INCREASE on the streets. no mention of an island mostly of non-working people living outside of their means. if you're going to do a story do a complete story every politician there is dirty as hell all they want to do is lace their own pockets and move someplace else in the world when they're done robbing them.
Prayers for all affected by this.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus! \nHe LOVES you! Please do not listen to the lies of the enemy. Jesus is NOT angry at you. He is waiting for you to call upon Him! He will save you! He will deliver you! \n\nLook around at all this chaos, Jesus warned us of these kinds of things in Matthew 24. \n\nPlease, if you haven't already, make Jesus YOUR Lord and Savior! He will forgive you if you trust Him. \n\nShalom, friends.
People defending trump cause he gave 1 million like if he doesn’t owe us 33 million from the stupid golf course he made
Do a story on why the politicians of Guam and Puerto Rico are ridiculously corrupt and inept.
Tough to invest heavily in a stretch of water that is known for devastating hurricanes.
B-B-But Puerto Rico is surrounded by lots and lots of water in the middle of a hyuge ocean and it's filled with Mexicans.  - Trump
so sad to hear about this. the government needs to do better.
I feel a coup, coup please
We're sending aid a lot of it but he leader in PR is holding on to it so she can say Trump isn't helping them, sad that leftist will let their people die to let their politics get ahead
We need to modernize Puerto Rico’s energy grid and infrastructure, demolish the Jone’s Act permanently, and provide tax break incentives for businesses who set up shop there. Your move Congress.
Trump only cares about Russia, Guam (North Korea missiles hit Trump's resort properties?) & the Mexican border. Puerto Rico voted for statehood, but the commonwealth government has a huge debt. Yes, Puerto Ricans lived in the mainland for a century, esp. peaking at 800,000 in New York City in 1970 after a previous migration wave. And not just hurricane Maria, they had Irma but it's eye didn't land on the island. Let's pray for Puerto Rico to get back on their feet. +
Instead of wasting money rebuilding an already bankrupt territory, why not just bring/settle these people here? That would probably cost us less; there are only about 3.5 million of them.
Damn I feel bad for those poor Ricans
Funny how vox conveniently forgets to mention the impact of socialism and massive government spending had on the island's debt.
So what is the American Government gonna do to help Puerto Rico? They are getting alot of bad media coverage for taking to long to help. And what do you do when you getting alot of bad media coverage. Change whats happening in the media. #Vegas
2:33 Is it just me or is the water from the broken pipe flowing perfectly into the other end of the pipe?
The U.S has done and is still doing plenty to help Puerto Rico, we need to send the military to help distribute food, water and other supplies as well as help rebuild
The hurricane was just trying to help them convert to alternative energy.
Trump is the reason.
Puerto Rico... Here i come
im going to make a guess................its Trumps fault.
Mother nature herself is striking back against the emissions thats killing earth. If we continue to burn fossil fuels this will be our future on the entire planet.
Elon Musk's idea to use Puerto Rico for solar expansion makes sense. We all should be independent instead of linking up to a grid. I saw a book YEARS AGO which said all we need is a solar panel and a small wind mill attached to our house. With sick people needing electricity, we really should go this route. Extreme weather is our future thanks to BIG OIL. Now is the time to go with this alternative.
Lemme guess since this is a vox video I'm sure trump single handedly destroyed Puerto rico
I’m lost. Hawaii has the same law. Why is it detrimental to Puerto Rico and not Hawaii?
I know a guy from puerto rico he said trumps sending in the navy and trucks and too stop watching cnn lol
The Puerto Rican singers should put a concrtt and donate every dime for this island in dire need. They should stop asking poor working people who could barely make ends meet and they who are millionaires should help reconstruct at least the basic necessary things such as water and power its a breeding ground for deaths, disease. It no help arrives soon Im afraid their situation will get worse and more complicated
Good work on the video. It was very subjective and laid out the facts.
After I have seen how fat are in Puerto Rico, I think It would be take years before someone death of starving
This uncertain and stressful situation, when it comes to the fact that 85% of their electric current is generated using oil,  can be a place where Nuclear technology can be proven. The startup company  TRANSATOMIC POWER, and many more all ready have a next generation reactor technology. Great video about it is at this very same channel. VOX! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poPLSgbSO6k&feature=youtu.be
THE US. VIRGIN ISLANDS, GUAM, AND P.R. NEED TO BE CONVERTED INTO STATES SO AID CAN BE ACCESSED MORE EASILY DURING TIMES LIKE THESE.
The attack on the jones act is totally wrong. I'd shows a complete misunderstanding of how the act is intended to function. The jones act protects shipments from America only. Foreign ships have no extra tariffs on the shipments coming from foreign nations.
Why did you delete the texas shooting video
Here's 10 photos that'll make you say this is all trumps fault, let's ignore the long line of democrat policies that have bankrupted the island.
So we have to bail out Puerto Rico because stupid people didn't prepare for when the taxes were turned back on as planned? Why not promote responsibility?\n\nI'm concerned about the people there, but when you make more money by uprooting to the mainland, there must be a bigger problem with Puerto Rico and not with how we don't think about them.
Puerto Rico should have their Independence.
Where is our military? I was stationed at Hurlburt Field around the time of the Haiti earthquake; *we were there within **_hours_** of the disaster* .
VOX helped radicalize the Vegas Shooter
This is why the federal government should subsidize distributed solar and wind energy in Puerto Rico. You don’t have to rebuild the old grid. You can create interconnected micro-grids. It’ll be cheaper, more reliable, and environmentally sound.
Elon Musk is on it
Is gone😂
k
Despacito though
#shouldhavevotedforstatehood
Well done US
places very far away Sigh! 😑
spain at its finest
ugh. wish things were better
Dont let these spics in haiti please
Fake news
Get rekt,luis fonzi
Prior to 2006, Puerto Rico's economy was the strongest, most powerful one in all of Latin America. PULL THE JONES ACT
What a joke! United States wants to take care of the world but don't even know how to manage their backyard
Trump has tens of thousands of aid trucks sitting on the docks. The DEMOCRATIC MAYOR is holding the aid HOSTAGE until his UNIONS get paid more!!!!! ARREST THE MAYOR
I dont like coldplay at all... but respect, you are a real band! best tribute ever, thank you
Will never be able to listen to free fallin the same ever again
That was Absolutely Beautiful. Coldplay could actually do a TRIBUTE TOUR performing ONLY Songs by The Recently and Semi  Recently Deceased Artists such as Tom Petty. Prince. Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington.  David Bowie. Amy Winehouse Scott Weiland George Michael Etc. Its all so Sad and Overwhelming ...
That was actually pretty fuckin dope and i don't even like coldplay.. #Respect
David Bowie, Prince, Leonard Cohen, Glenn Frey...hell even Merle Haggard, and now; Tom Petty. \nMusic will never be the same.   This was a simple, but effective tribute to an icon.
This are my boys ❤ * proud *
This was an excellent tribute to a rock legend. May your soul be at peace Mr. Petty.
brought tears to my eyes.....great job coldplay
Thank You Tom Petty for playing the soundtrack to my life....I've NEVER been this sad about rock star passing...This one REALLY hurts.

I wanna go to their Concert at Rose Bowl this October 6th but no one wants to come with me due to the shooting in Las Vegas.
I was there! SO GOOD! It was SO emotional - they came out very solemnly, asked for a moment of silence for Vegas, then went into Free Fallin'. It was SO emotional! <3 <3 Love them!
Thank you Coldplay.  You are a good band honoring a legend.  I can't believe Tom is gone, it was like he never aged.  Anyone who didn't like his music was no friend of mine.  I imagine him meeting Elvis, Jackson and half the Beatles and imagine the jam session.
Not a Coldplay fan but a very nice cover & tribute.
shout out to Coldplay great tribute to the great Tom Petty!!!!....R.I.P TOM
Most emotionl version of Free falling I have ever heard. I am so heartbroken over the loss of Tom Petty, his music has been the soundtrack to my life. He was by far my most loved. I cannot believe he's gone. RIP Tom :(
I was there, and it was absolutely incredible. Chris is such a great guy :)

What a beautiful tribute. This is amazing.
Mad respect for all of you on stage and fans. One more light just went out...

thank you to all the patient fans last night! myself got caught up stressing about getting food to all of you and I heard this coming from the arena! it was like all the chaos disapeared! Just made a lot of people show love for strangers after that! people paying for people's orders in front of them is just one example! As a bass player myself, growing up with Tom petty, I have mad respect for coldplay! Even more then before!
I hate getting old,I see all the greatest disappear,RIP Tom Petty.Now I feel like i'm free falling...
Oct 2 will ALWAYS be remembered
Wasnt there but was fully aware of them coming town. What a blissful surprise to see they did this. :) RIP Tom.
Coldplay and R.E.M...doesn't beat Foo Fighters and Rick Ashley!!! Great tribute though!!!!!!
Knocked it out of the park!! Great tribute song. R.I.P. Tom Petty. You will be missed, but your awesome music lives on.
Who is cutting all the onions here?
It took me almost 20 hours to grip that Petty passed.  Laying in bed crying my butt off. I love all musicians.  Listen to  Leave Virginia Alone written for Rod Stewart by Tom. Go see Rod while u can.  Seriously.
thank you!
Major Respect Coldplay!
Much respect!!
Amazing! RIP Tom.
Yes😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭👋

que lindo  espacio que deja la gente  , en los conciertos afuera, , para poder llegar  hasta el borde del escenario   :)     en Argentina eso no pasa   :)  :)    ;)
Stop disrespecting by butchering the death people song. You have done enough, Chris Martin.
Nice sentiment but poorly executed.\n\nTHERE IS ONLY ONE TOM PETTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nRIP Tom!
I hate Tributes swimming on the wave of fate for PR. Guys you going too one day don’t forget that! ColdPlay 👎🏻
This video raises the inevitable question, is there any corpse that Chris and the boys won't fuck the shit out of? That lumpen drum sound, the guitars lacking in any kind of feeling, the walking vagina and embodiment of middle class liberal guilt Chris 'the plagiarist' Martin, unable to hit the fucking notes. Had he even heard this song before? When this bunch of washed out cocks die they'll no doubt release own posthumous tribute to themselves to grab a few more quid from beyond the grave.
Fucking Coldplay playing a tribute to every single artist who died. Wonder how honest they are.
awesome tribute! PS- Go check out John Mayer's rendition of it (the live version)
i guess coldplay won the race to sing the tribute first
Good stuff, gentlemen. I'm only 30 but my parents were heavy rockers and Tom Petty might not have been the voice of my generation.... but I was born about 25 years too late. It hurts.
most attention pathetic seeking band going. licking Gallaghers arse at Manchester and he can't stand them and now ruining an already shite song
Not a fan of Coldplay.....and a big Tom Petty fan......they did an average cover of his work.
There is nothing left in football.
i thought crack was mental
I will always belong to this family
wtf is happening peeps bitchin over Sanchez get a grip,i do agree with DT we are riding our luck
Alexis fan tv, kissing his ass while he disrespect ur club lol. Smh
City and spurs gonna smash Arsenal 5 nil
Sorry but arsenal fan tv would not be the same if you won the league and cups because DT n Troopz wouldnt be mad. Love there reactions 💯👊🏼
DT is still only fun when they lose
Arsenal are doing good but DT u over expect everything. You said oh West Brom had chances u expect them to dominate every game of course the other team will always get shots off u can’t expect them to keep the opposition not have a chance.
Robbie you should make playlists for every team we play and add on them the next time we play them
Alaba you've had your 10 goals go away!
Again with the trending wtf is going on,but to be fair the lets talk about the game comment was hilarious 😂😂👍🏻
https://youtu.be/uupZlTULD1w this will help you get over your shit game
Ramsey and Giroud totally overrated! There is more goals in Wilshire and Walcott at the moment!
While the Manchester clubs and Spurs are banging 4 against so called lesser teams, we are just about scoring 2 and riding our luck. Bigly. \n\nWe need to sort this defence and also get Sanchez, Laca and Ozil playing together. That front three could do wonders for us this season and when Jack gets in (if he can keep this form), our midfield can be way more creative than the staleness we are witnessing now. \n\nBut much of this wont matter if we dont sort this defending out. Wenger should try 4 at the back and see how we play. Its been a while but I think we'd be more solid.
Riding our luck Our xg was 2.9, Brighton's was 0.4. DT is a complete moron
I never even knew Alexis had haters he holds are team on his back he is Arsenal.
Give Aresnal team some credits pls... as for DT .. I dun know who u are... but seems like you are nothing but a very negative person.
I think Alexis, maybe because they both speak spanish, has a better understanding with Monreal than with Kolasinac, on that left side. Hopefully with more matches Alexis and Kolasinac can get a better undrstanding and improve each other performances , because Kolasinac is a beast, and Monreal is having a amazing season in his new position so i wouldn't change there positions.
Why is this even a topic. Laca should have played sanchez in for a tap in !!
This is actually trending. DT one of the best personality on AFTV
Good arsenal win
Arsenal should of won 5,6-0
People forget Alexis had some very rough international games where he lost the confederations cup and then lost 2 games (qualifiers). He´s got a lot in his head at this point, not only Arsenal, and this is not to make any excuses, but come on, those fans giving him shit... they should be bothering the board to get rid of Wenger and the lazy players, instead of bothering the only guy that gave everything for his team last season.
i like you DT but do you ever say anything positive
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
DT is definitely the realest amongst all the other AFTV regulars. He may be biased towards some players but he lenient towards them when they’re shit. I like him better now than when he was all “Wenger Out”.\n\nNot saying that Wenger should stay beyond the 2 years though. ;)
Always in with a chance when it’s 11 v 11, so keep Ozil out and get him out ASAP. Alexis is a done deal- he will sign for another club in January and then maybe people who are fooling themselves that he might stay will see.
It is too early to talk about signs .. he is correct we have to see how we play away in the coming 5-6 premier league games.. Everton, Man City, Watford .. would be the test.. Hope we rest our players in europa and EFL cup .. and then put up a performance like we did at Chelsea and this time take 3 points not just 1.

Good job Arsenal! You have avoided defeat for weeks!\n\nIn other news, Robbie has reportedly been delaying his downpayment for a new mansion, citing 'temporary loss of income' as the reason.
Man Utd for life! We will win the league
In subscribing to anybody how subs me untill I reach 100 subs\nComment done
This guy is a mug
I dont get the sanchez haters.....i really dont. I said b4 its likely people who cheer on wenger that booo sanchez but its beyond that. I genuinely think they dont understand football and aint worth debating with.
The emerates has the worst atmosphere out of every league!
Next week well be very interesting goo.gl/b5Nh2T
DT is on point right there
when Arsenal win Robbie has to get 'creative' with video titles...
is this fatty ever happy if we had lost he'd be screaming we have to learnt how to win ugly theres really no pleasing arsenal fans take the 3 points and the clean sheet and move tf on
DT ...I hear you on the poor performance...but we slowly getting the 3 points...
I don't get it half the time we lose we moan we draw we moan we win we all still moan what the hells going on we still won don't care who were playing we still won lol
3-4-3 Formation is killing Arsenal's season
Really poor? They won two nil.
If Alexis leaves then let's see how this team copes. The guy was a star player for Barcelona in his last season
DT is only being like this because he deludedly thinks that he may stay.
DT complaints way over the top sometimes. why not win ugly and get 3 points than dominate and get nothing and still complain.
Mad that DT gets more views nowadays than Claude
DT is RIGHT! we're doing well against lesser teams but let's see it goes against the bigger clubs and I don't mean just drawing against them! I mean solid performances and wins. Coyg!
This bloke is a total cock !!!
Sanchez don't even want to be at arsenal why back a judus
DT needs. To chill relaxing like he's beast.
'Lacazette looks clinical, he hit the post today' ffs
DT is one of the few Arsenal fans who have a true sense of perspective. \n\nBut we all know how the season's story is going to turn out for Arsenal. We don't need DT's wisdom to tell us. Because we've been reading the same book for thirteen seasons.
When are arsenal fans going to understand that arsenal is a mid table team glory days are over
Why interview a moron? Couldn't give a toss what he thinks. Whinging bloke can't even speak English, I'm embarrasssed for him.
Am i the only one who cracks up when i see the view count that aftv have when arsenal wins and then compare it to when arsenal loses? Lol
C'mon DT just chill man. Every team has problems. I know Arsenal have been playing some shocking football, but can't blame the defence all the time. Look at Real Madrid today. They won 2-0 but Espanyol had 2-3 really good chances. I know that you had enough of poor Arsenal, but start supporting the team rather than critizising their every mistake.
They could have had this they could have had that... could have and should have are two different things!! Are you forgetting that arsenal also hit the bar and had more chances in this game?? Think you need to stop being a pessimist and support your club.
well said DT. today's game was just too slow and not scoring the needed goals
DT is right on the money... except for the contradiction regarding the squad making progress. If we have the potential to compete for top 3 then that's clearly progress compared to previous analysis stating we probably won't make top 4. \nI'm Still #WO (since '08)
Alexis is the number one arsenal
Didnt know why iwobi was in the background.
Again DT is absolutely right! Arsenal progress with frail teams but crumble ever so easily against big and technically strong premier league clubs. If Arsenal beat Any of the top 6 teams away the same way we beat lowly rated clubs in the premiership, then the world can take our title credentials very serious, as it is there's no amount of points you can amass from smaller clubs that can justify winning the premier league trophy.
Robbies just thinking about how he's getting to Ibiza next week, by his private yacht or his private jet?
Arsenal is shit end off.
hey robbie id like to know if you will be going to the world cup next year, i think it would be cool if you go along with the aftv boys(troopz, dt etc.) like if you agree
Did anyone else notice the Brighton fan in the background? 😂
Big up to DT, always tell the truth
Arsenal is shit, Chelsea for the win
I hope you're dream comes true my dream is to get 100 subscribers by the end of the month can you please help me with my dream?!!
Once we  start playing the ball sideways it is Xhaka's role to collect the ball and spread the ball to the right forward. When the game gets boring we should blame him, he is our engine at the same time passing the ball sideways can be a way to rest after running so much and try to pull the opponents. #wearethearsenalfc
these ungrateful fat fucks never touched a ball in their greasy lives stfu!!!!!!!
Usual
Dt on point
THANK YOU DT!
DT mate calm down buddy!

Btw.. I heard that Carlo A. Wants the arsenal job !! \nAnd cante wants to leave Chelsea after this season !!\nAny thoughts ????
I swear DT jinxed Arsenal when we start winning games and go on a run he gets negative and we tremble it's like the players watch arsenal fans tv or something
I love when I refresh my YouTube subscription page and it's 1993.
love breeders forever
What jerks voted this down? Breeders are back!
Give me the album already
I love it!  Kim Deal I love you forever!!  I've been a fan about that long anyway.  Kisses!  xxx
Just what I needed to start my day! THANK YOU! Welcome back!!!
Good to know that The Breeders came back to 4AD. This will bring again worldwide exposure the band deserves. Great track! Welcome back Kim, Kelley, Josephine and Jim!
I really dig it!
Wots... uh the Deal?
Still got it, unlike the Pixies...
New Breeders material is welcome in these trying times.
holy fuck i needed this! 🔥🔥💘💘⚡⚡
YES! Now I can stop grumbling that everything new sucks.
So excited to see them at Union Transfer on November 6th! Last time I saw them live was opening for Nirvana twice in 1993.
Oh Oh, is this a new album I hear?
makes you wonder why it took them forever and a bit to bring out some new stuff... just to give you the impression, there's nothing more casual to do in the world, once you hear it.\n\nThey found a way to pack all the classical Breeders magic into this 2 minutes, making it as catchy as ever. Kim's always been a goddess in writing short songs with character. She still got it.\n\nim eager to hear more
Nice!!!   Btw. so excited to see you in Berlin in a couple of days :-)
I love you Kim
Love it!!! Classic Breeders. Aging like a fine wine and I like fine wine too ;)
So wonderful, just what I need!
Good song! Thanks for a nice surprise. :)
pls sir can i have some more
This is the best way of waking up
GOOD MORNING! This song is *everything*! Made my week/month/year/life.
It's got a good beat https://youtu.be/7g3P18rTFMA?t=1m35s
Here are the lyrics I tried to decipher. I am not sure about some parts. Would love suggestions or edits from everyone else.\n\nTHE BREEDERS, WAIT IN THE CAR\n\nGood morning\nConsider I\nAlways struggle with the right word\nMeow, meow, meow-meow-meow\nAs a sinner, I\n(unlock?) nothing that neat\nSinner I\nSinner I\nSinner I\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nMother wants to hold me down\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nWait in the car\nI got business\nForget the sun\nTime to get off, take it or not\nCause strategies for punks\nMother wants to hold me down\nMother wants to hold me down\nGonna chase the stars\nMaking a map, scraping off the sky\nJust to fall back\nSinner I\nSinner I\nSinner I\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh
instant classic! I'm so happy! !!!
'Wait in the car while mother beats the shit out of Sen. Jack Martins..'

Beautiful video.I love your songs \nGreetings from Poland :)
I have never been in a relationship before but this video somehow melted my heart.
Anyone realized that after party studios produced this? (Callux's company) pretty dope!
Sarah's voice is so relaxing and soothing
I love it! Now give me a slow one of just you and the piano. Gosh, I'd love that.
This is just magical
When I first saw her friends I thought that was jake paul Paul and Erika Costel
Wow video quality is great and the song is good 8.5/10 😂
Thought that was Pewdiepie in the thumnail
That's great , loved it !!!!!
Who wants Sarah to cover 1800 by logic?
Sounds like a Trap Nation song
absolutely amazing video, well done, you should be so proud!! Love it 💜
What’s callux’s opinion on your “boyfriend”

I heard this song for the first time this morning and i'm loving it! Everything about it

The realness in this is amazing. Seriously wonderful job
Horrible. Unworthy. I dont feel nothing.
that tweet about that she thinks girls turn girls on way too easily.. was that like some homophobic move or..? tf
The comments on this vid are beyond retarded.
Who cares he's a fuckin freak
Looks like he got his Gunn
lmao Jesus is coming for your wig manson 😂😂
too funny. hope he is doing ok ;)
Could have been worse. He could have been at a gig in Las Vegas!
Crushed by a giant cross? Ohhh, so there IS a god AND he has a sense of humor
when it hit him he bend over so far he could lick his own ass lol
Who's the jerk fan who screams to finish the f****** song at minute 2:45?
Anne Lennox did it better, come on
Wow they weren't even playing the instruments.
I bet he broke a few ribs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh wait.
AHAHAHAHAH
Couldn't have happened to a better 'man' 😂😂😂😂😂😂
it fell on the beat drop
I can't be fucked this crowd is boring.. Cut the strings and let the prop fall on me...
2:04 is what you came for
2:47 is when some guy shouted finish the fucking song
MOST LIKELY this happened because he has been ripping a bibles onstage...
I don't wish injury to anyone but honestly, I didn't know he was still performing.  I thought he retired.
Hes ok, remember kids he had his ribs removed so he can succ his own dicc. he simply folded in half until the prop was removed off him. no damage done. thank god.
Hes gotten so fat his gravitational pull was bound to fuck him up
Lol, a bit of a Spinal Tap moment. Act of God for being a degenerate !
People Cheering like it's part of the show
Rip pages out of the Word of God and you’ll get what you deserve.
did they pay to get in? to listen to covers?
I love you. Get well soon 🖤
he can't get enough horror this bloke....lol
I believe this was... Staged.
Let's just pray he crushed his vocals
They're jammin' out at hammerstein,\nHe climbed a ladder then got pinned,\nStupidest stunt in mankind,\nThe ballroom prop.
Was that paul from the wonder years?
*FINISH* *HIM* 2:03

Бедняга...  Надеюсь декорации были не очень тяжёлыми 💜
ECW! ECW! ECW!
I love your videos.  Thank you.  My grandpa taught me to shoot when I was six years old too.  My favorite rifles will always be single-shot .22 rim-fire, bolt-action rifles...with a plunger you have to actually PULL BACK each time.  Good little plinking guns.  But 6-year olds and hundreds of people in a crowd and EVERY PERSON in this country...they are so much more important to me.  I'd be fine with never shooting a gun again, with never OWNING or TOUCHING a gun again, if it *reduced* the numbers of people killed by white guys with guns (and arsenals).  We do, indeed, have to TRY.  Thank you.
We don't need to ban guns, but we need to make it more strict to acquire. Go look at Japan gun laws. They have strict gun policies and has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world.
MAN WELL SAID ON POINT DUDE......
Trae Crowder, thank you for speaking the truth.
It ain't opportunism, it's desperation.  Thank you. I was a student at Santa Monica College when that one went down (though I was nowhere near campus that day), and I was blocks away from the 2009 shooting in Binghamton, New York, trying to get to a voice lesson. Those are opposite sides of the country. You'd think the odds would be against me ending in up such close proximity to a shooting twice like that, but that seems to be America these days. Even without counting the people I know from Binghamton and Santa Monica, the number of my friends who have personal connections to national tragedies is just getting too goddamn high. It feels like these gun-toting mass-murdering bastards are just closing in on all of us, all the time. Something. Has. To. Change.
Can't buy an Assault Rifle in Australia and guess how many mass shootings there are? Pretty simple solution. It is so frustrating.
One of Trae's best videos.  This is for real.
Trae, I am with you 1000%!! And, I live in South Carolina! If anyone has told you that you aren't funny, send them to me. They can kiss my big, dimpled white ass!!! You're making a helluva lot of us proud. According to a former Supreme Court justice only 5 words need to be added to the 2nd Amendment to help the dumb motherfuckers understand what it REALLY means, to keep your State safe! Since it was intended for state militia. He went on to say that home safety and hunting were the only exceptions and he wasn't particularly happy with home safety since there are so many irresponsible gun owners out there who do not properly secure the weapon and a kid gets his hands on it. It's on my Facebook page if you want to read it. Retired criminal law judge, Robin Addis Vaughn. Hang in there!
Canadian liberal red neck hippie here. There is only one thing you can do:\nFind out WHY this guy did it, and solve THAT problem.\nHOW he did it is something no piddling law can erase, which is the physical existence of millions of guns in America, that will always be available, and will just create a new black market if you try to pull back hard enough to make any significant difference to their real availability. \nIt's too late, you have to fix the WHY, you can't fix the HOW.
You rock, Trae! I wish there were a g-rated version of you, so I could share your wisdom and humor with my six-year-old son! Big love from Texas 😘
Such truth! I'm an Alabama native. Every uncle I have shoots, hunts, etc. I don't understand how they can think that's on par with a nut job owning 20+ war machine guns.
You should've seen what this one guy said on FOX news. He said that with Bin Laden, they knew which group to hate, but with this guy, with no group to put him in they don't know who to hate. Can you believe that, he doesn't know who to hate, A MAN KILLED MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE AND INJURED 500, BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO TO HATE. HATE THE KILLER.\n\nSorry for caps, it's just that guy put me on edge, with his bull.
A man after my own heart.  FUCK the GOP and FUCK the NRA.
We own 42% of some 650 million guns in civilian hands worldwide. 42% of 650 million. Digest that. It's a lot of god damned guns. Couple that with our lack of healthcare...mental healthcare. It's a very scary scenario. And it is our reality here in the good ole US of A. I understand people yell it's my right. But what about my right to go to a movie or a concert without being afraid? We all have rights but who's pose the most danger to the most people?
Who are the 55 fuckfaces who think that anything THIS MAN has said in this video is not worth taking seriously? WTF has to happen for you 55 numpties to get your head around what he's saying?
Nobody woke up after sandy hook.  Those were 23 innocent children.  They had there whole lives ahead of them.  I have no hope for this country.  Stay armed.  Stay prepared.  The worst is yet to come.\n\nBetter yet.  Buy ammo.
A redneck that is against the NRA ? This has to be fake, Hard to believe that a redneck would be against the NRA.
More guns and Jesus, then we’ll be safe
Trae, I love you!  Thank fake Jesus there are people like you who reassure me with your rants... \nthat I'm not crazy.
Ohh nooooooo !!!!! The shooter dude was a white guy????? The Donald needs a brown shooter man...[sigh]  oh well, nevermind...put a travel ban on Ethiopia
I love you Trae. I'm here in the south (SOUTH!) and I love my guns, but yeah... I've known for years now there has to be at least something we can do. At the least, owning a gun should have the same burdens of owning a car. Oh, and consecutive prison time for using a gun in a crime instead of concurrently... And treat an unregisterd gun like it's that 3rd strike for a dime bag of weed... at the least. \n\nOh, but some Congressional assholes wanna add silencers into the equations. Sheesh. Dumbfuckery all around.
Those assholes shouldn't have been celebrating at a hillbilly concert, they should have been rioting for a living wage and healthcare, free college, and taxing the 1%, and most of getting rid of the Trump Junta! We need more heroes like Stephen Paddock to liquidate more of these MAGA cap NRA, GOP supporting yokels! Nevada and all the other red-states have it coming to them in spades, I only hope someone starts killing the Koch Bros, Mercers, and all the famblies of the wealthy tyrants in this country! Death To Drumpf & GOP!
Probably already pointed out, but... Did you break a banjo string at the 3:00 mark? \nLove your point of view. Keep up the great work.
One thing I love about you Trae, is you are as real as it gets.
Spot on as usual.
Thank you for telling the truth!👍
It took me over a year of paperwork and correspondence with my police department before I could begin my firearm purchase and I feel like the amount of stuff that happened in that time frame did not reflect the time spent on it. If it took that long and the entire process was close scrutinizing of psychological disposition and likelihood to commit violent crime, and they came to the conclusion I'd use it responsibly & lawfully, there'd be no justification in arguing it was time poorly spent.\n\nI don't have a good stance or solution. I think **I** should be able to have whatever I want. I can't say I trust anyone else doing it though.
you are my fucking hero.  this arkansas girl cannot understand how it's nothing could be done. is an excuse.
Trae, what do the these words in the 2nd amendment mean? A well regulated militia.  Any fool?
We can try. I think it's amazing how hard you try. Thank you for that. It's easy to feel like hope is lost. We look around & so much is messed up. My mama always says nothing worth having ever comes easy. Just know you are inspiring so many people to try. Conversations are happening & I use examples from you all the time in my talks. Keep trying. Maybe go shoot some shit, but when the smoke blows away always come back. People really need your message.
I don't know what to say about this. If an incident like Sandy Hook, where a crazy man mowed down a bunch of toddlers doesn't get people to agree to try to fix the problem, I honestly don't know what will.
I'm open to suggestions brotha
Dude!  You're good and this is from a septuagenarian lifelong atheist who is also a Vietnam vet.   You are a breath of fresh air so please keep going!!  Best of luck!   Just remember that we Americans really are a stupid lot.  Have your critics google the most honest 3 minutes of TV and then ask them what they think!
Thank you for your sensible voice
Say it with me America. Owning. A. Gun. Is. Not. More. Important. Than. Innocent. Lives.
We need to do something. We took my dads guns because he started having symptoms of  dementia  and he was able to go to a flea market and got a handgun. Just like that. Scary.
It's not opportunism, it's desperation no truer words have been spoken.  This is why I love you guys, Well Red!
You, my friend, are 100% correct!
Thanks again, Trae. You always say what's on my mind.
I don't want to say this man was deranged. This was cold and calculated, and there was the thing with a 100,000 wire transfer to the Philippines a week prior-plus his girlfriend just so happens to be in Tokyo. The augmentation of semi automatic weaponry to function as fully automatic doesn't surprise me-what does are the cameras he hid outside in the hallway with which through his tablet he was able to determine when the police/hotel security were about to barge through the door. He used an AK47, that recoils like a bitch-he REALIZED this and PLANNED AHEAD with a stabilizing tripod. This was meticulous, this was textbook domestic terrorism. Oklahoma City all over again. \n\nI'm all for universal background checks, I'm all for ATF certification for fully automatic weapons, I'd go so far as to say we should go the route of the UK and Australia (that's not happening, but it'd be nice). The problem is that this guy passed a background check every time he bought guns. No criminal record, no known mental illnesses, no known political extremism (the most extreme libertarians get is Vermin Supreme), no known religious extremism, the only thing that stick's out now is a high stakes gambling addiction. So long as it would be legal to buy any guns, or possibly make them with a 3d printer (good luck making an accurate rifle with that) this would have happened regardless... that scares the shit out of me!\n\nThis man was motivated, patient, completely in control of himself, and able to make a plan-which for him worked like a charm.If we had better laws 2 things would have changed, the scale of the victims and the time it took him to pull it off. If nothing else I'd fucking take it in a heart beat. \n\nNow I wonder how Russian troll farms are going to jump on both sides of this topic to stir the pot and attempt to destabilize our culture... seems to be their thing these days. \n\nOn an unrelated note-look at what's going on in Spain with an independence referendum. Catalonia has a city named Barcelona, where a Russian hacker is being deported to the US... I have no evidence to say that Russia is involved with the violent unrest but I have this eerie sinking feeling that it looks hauntingly similar to other stuff going on right now
I’m for the right to bear arms for self defense. BUT NO ONE IN HELL NEEDS A COLLECTION TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST A VAST NUMBER OF UNARMED PEOPLE, THEY NEED THAT TO MURDER PERIOD.
Thank you.  Keep it up, Trae.  We can’t give up.
Anyone ever notice what all these massacres have in common? They all happen in heavy blue areas of the country. Seriously. Do your homework if you don't believe it. The media and democrats want to politicize a massacre? I will give them their fucking facts. The problem isn't guns, its democrats.
u r so right , that what our good u.s.a sad!
Trae should expand His perceptions, a bit more. The World in which We live in? Is no fucking accident. Nothing, is unforeseen. Like facilitating the Lone Gunmen of the World? Every Nut with a WMD, is an Ambassador to the American Weapons Industry! Hence, the (costly) Militarization of all Government Agencies and all Americans, in the Name of Defense. When there is no Defense. Only progressive escalations. Tis' no fucking accident and not unforeseen. IT IS A PARADIGM OF INTENT.
8 years ago I had to go to a town hall meeting in Illinois to speak before the council.  Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Guns had pushed a piece of boilerplate legislation to all of its membership in Illinois for immediate consideration at the local level.  They did it this way because the state had recently been forced by SCOTUS to pass a CCW Law, and the state law would preempt all local laws once it went into effect.  By its writing, the law would have made me, and a lot of other pretty regular folks a felon for owning (not carrying, not shooting - just owning) a double-stack pistol, which is generally the standard-issue police sidearm for most departments across the country.  My pistol would have been classified an assault weapon, and I'd have to turn it in to the state or face prison.  \n\nThis law, that MAG snuck into dozens, if not hundreds of town council agendas for a vote might not have taken my granddaddy's hunting rifle, but it would have taken my only firearm.  So when folks tell me, Nobody is coming to take your gun - I know that's only true because I paid attention and spoke to my councilpersons.  Had I not been paying attention - that's exactly what they would have done.  Folks will tell you one thing while you're looking, and do another when you're not.\n\nAll that said, it's time to talk about it.  It's time to put the effort in.  But I want it to be an honest conversation, because I don't believe we've been having one.  I'll give you all the other points, Trae - NRA, and all.  But the BS is flowing both ways, man - and as long as it is, it's gonna be difficult to figure it out.
It was Too soon after Sandy Hook.  How about we talk about Sandy Hook now?
I was on my land in the UP shooting this weekend at grizzly whores. I was gone for 3 days and you all let the crazy out. I own a 9mm and a 12 gauge.  To me, there's no reason for any automatic weapons.
Guns should be relegated to shooting ranges and hunting ranges. Have your fun while you're there, but this whole protect my family bullshit is just that.
There will never be gun control, Sandy Hook proved that. We love guns so much that 20 dead children cannot change gun laws. What makes you think 60 dead adults will? Doesn't matter, the NRA has already bought your elected officials. I can already see the upcoming theocracy unfolding, it's called CPAC. White, straight, Christians have more rights than everyone else and they have no shame telling us this fact.
Damn well said, sir.  And that's coming from a 53 year old white son of a 22 year Army vet who was raised in a small town in Minnesota.  So yeah, I know guns.  America's gun regulations, or rather lack thereof, are pathetic and inexcusable.
Your shirt is on backwards man....
We already have weapons control, we don't let people have bombs or grenades or armed F16's...  We just draw the line too far out, people don't have any need for assault weapons, there is just no need...  There is a desire, but there's desire for all sorts of things that are illegal. That's been my opinion for years, protecting peoples right to own reasonable weapons, single shot rifles, shotguns, and handguns...  But I'm really quickly getting to where...  just NO, none, nothing... I'm done, you can't talk sense into the other side, its I should be able to carry an arsenal into a hotel and do whatever I want...  Now, I'm from Kentucky, a southern boy that's owned guns and grew up with them, and I'm over it, just no, they need to go, then we can stop arming our police to the teeth too. It's a multi-factored disarmament.
I say step one is to limit magazine capacity. Sandy hook, this one takes large magazines to carry out. Hard to shoot 200 people with a 5 round mag. Step 2 probably nix assault rifles. The gun debate was over after Sandy Hook with a democratic president and no change. \n\nGuns don't kill people like hammers don't build houses, but they make the job a lot god damn easier.
I always think it is ironic when it comes to drugs we have to regulate and in some cases eliminate them because they kill people and destroy lives.  We blame the drug for the problem.  But when it comes to guns killing people well then it's the people, not the guns.
The world is full of hate.
In response to The Onion article about the shooting: \n--\nreddit user Sambothebassist: One of the funniest jokes (and saddest realities) here is not just that the article gets literally reposted, but the onion actually write a new article with the same headline and text content (with slight updates to name and locations) to prove a point - nothing will change whilst the gun culture stays the way it is.\n\nresponse by user halfar: I don't get why this is even up for debate. America looked at an elementary school filled with murdered fucking children, filled with bullet holes all the way through, and said, yeah, we like the status quo. The gun debate is over. They won. They get to keep their toys. There's nothing else you can say. There's no possible hyperbole or exaggeration that can make them look at the issue in a new light.\n\nsee you all at the next shooting.\n--
You look kinda like jake gyllenhall in brokeback mountain
I need one more AR 15, and a high capacity shot gun, then we'll talk about it. OK?
I’m gonna use that kids with knives thing.
Make gun owners have to carry insurance for each firearm and watch the insurance companies go after the NRA.  When did Jesus ever tell anyone to carry a weapon of violence? This sure isn’t rocket science.
White conservative christians have killed more Americans than any other group. If you disagree, go look up the casualty count for the American Revolution, War of 1812, Civil War (Union casualities only of course), WWI and WWII European theater.
Forget gun control...never gonna happen. It's time to fix it the same way they fixed smoking: Public shaming, mockery of gun nuts and relentless emphasis on the reality of the matter. Who would buy the image of the macho cowboy smoking himself to death? Likewise the idea of guns as machismo or freedom is laughable next to the reality of 8 year olds accidentally shooting their parents and lunatics mowing down their fellow citizens: THAT is what guns are, only cultural realization of that will ever change this clusterf****.
You are awesome and right on time!
You are one of my heroes for a reason. Thank you!
Our little obsession with guns really is insane.  Forget the criminals for a minute, we need psych evals for the people who think this is okay.\n\nI'm not delusional enough to think we'll ever get rid of em altogether.... But how much fucking firepower can one person justifiably need? I mean, if you're a hunter,  you can make a solid argument for two or three. But the idea that people *need* anything beyond that, is just fucking crazy. \n\nThere are already more guns floating around this country than there are people, and anyone who doesn't see a problem with that..... probably feels that way because deep down they know they should be prohibited from owning them, as a person suffering from mental illness. \n\nThe constitution doesn't guarantee anyone's right to keep a small arsenal in their basement. And any idiot off the street who's capable of dressing themself,  isn't anyone's definition of _a well regulated militia_
Spot on as usual, Trae - thanks.....How about a video on the new law that goes into effect in Mississippi on Friday!
Thanks, brother.
VOTE!!!
Very sane man....
Shut up you stupid faggot.
thanks t-bone
Bravo!!! Well said!!!
Thank you, sir!
Stop making sense...it's weird
Solid brother....I felt that!
Thabks Trey.
Thank you.
Amen
Trae is my spirit animal!!‼️‼️
Amen!
Right.
<3
Just another gun fetishist.
PERFECT!
Truth brother!
Well said. VERY well said.
But muh suppressors 😟
Your Grandfather must be so sad his genes and legacy ended up in such a faggot.
Are you all Fucking Idiots?.....what Kool-Aid have all yall drank??....Gun control isn't the answer folks!...don't listen to this Idiot....this guy in Las Vegas or anyone like minded wanting to commit this type of mass murder will still get these same type weapons through the black market or from someone illegally no matter what gun laws are passed! This event would have still happened! while all us law abiding citizens are gunless and defenseless against criminals wanting to harm you....why cant yall see this?....do you all want to give up all your freedoms and live under a dictatorship government controlling every aspect of your lives? is that what you want?...then move to another country!!!....criminals that want to harm you and do mass murders will obtain weapons no matter how strict we are with gun laws...a gunless society makes it easier for criminals to do this even more! how stupid are you now?.....omg!
Na. No reason to restrict the rights of anyone just because someone else abused their rights. You're punishing people for crimes they haven't even committed. For shit they MIGHT commit because someone else already did it.
But still for gun owners think about this 32 floor at 400 yards or feet I don't remember but arow dinamics does this entire story make sense 😕?  A mile is 365feet
Trae on the white-guilt train now too?  Bummer.
The deodorant stains on your shoulders is a bit distracting...
The problem with banning firearms is that it does not stop people from getting them. It only helps support the black market.
Sigh. I wish. I really do. But it ain't gonna happen. It just ain't. Never. Especially not with Darth Orange in office. Not being a pessimist, being a realist. You try to take away the guns, especially in the south, and you are literally going to have a civil war on your hands. It's sad, and it's fucked up, but it's true. Try to stay safe y'all.
I love you Trae, but that's where I draw the line.\nOK, all guns are banned. Now, someone takes a truck and ram over people, killing 86 and wounding 450. Oh, it already happened? Right, Nice in France. So banning guns accomplished nothing??? So back to square one, go after the people not the tool.
Fuck you Scumbag
😂😂😂😂 this progressive redneck just laughed her ass off! This is asinine that the conversation had become so polarized to no one will listen to the valid arguments made from the side that opposes their point of view! I'm about to get a lot of hate for sharing this but maybe coming from one redneck to another some of my family and friends will listen to reason!
Now that you mention it yeahhh you ain't been too funny lately ... I loved it when you were anti Religious... Buuuut its been a while
This is horrible he should have just left it alone
Fucking disgusting scumbag, is that seriously the most 'humane' way of putting an injured bird out of its misery? Taking the piss more like.
fucking wanker, ill give the coward an iron around his head
*How is this on Trending??*
Drown this guy . !!
Absolutely disgusting behaviour.
Excuses. \nShould of left alone.
Fucking scum bag.!wood love a swing at ur head!
That was a birdie
Fat bastard with woman's boobs needs a good kicking. And his kids taken away for there safety
Who's the animal?
whyd u do that
What a piece of shit. Killing an innocent animal for humour and a video online, pathetic cunt.
Absolute cunt.🖕
Why...?
Let me bash his head in with a golf club & see how he likes it
It sucks but read the description of you haven't
That guys a fucking cunt . I can just imagine him doing that and then going back to lining up another shot moving his gay hips fuuuuck if I was there 🤛
Swearing, Feminsium, Racism that were youtube draws the line but this is okay
But if it was real  fuck him
He's a scumbag  but i wouldn't wish death upon him like most  of the other comments
Are you asking for a hoard of shitty comments ? 😁
Sees video, sees channel name American toy fun review channel, seems legit.
Wtf fucking dick head if he died it would do humanity a favour
And he did that because..............?
I'd like to play golf with his f****n head!
How is this on trending!! This is disgusting
This really was a fun review
So many people saying this guy deserves to die are you for real? We kill and eat ducks every day...
Why the fuck would you record this? It just makes the situation a whole lot worse
YouTube go home you're drunk
What did you do
Duck hunt /tiger woods
Faith in humanity lost ..
Not good
Disgusting
What a cunt.
25 minutes till the Battlefront 2 Beta !!
Nice
Hehehe, He was arrested
What a disgusting human being
Birdie.
Read description
ended its suffering after being hit by a golf ball? I bet it was just stunned. I hate being human. We're cunts to everything.
Excellent Finish
You fucking sick cunt! I'd do that to you, you prick!
This man is an example of a person with a sealed heart who deserves to enter into hell.
I wonder how many of the people whom are outraged by this, are meat eaters? Because the abuse animals receive from the meat industry is far, faaaar worse than this. But everyone ignores that. People are such dipshits. I'm a meat eater by the way, I just don't pretend to be a good person. I'm a cunt, just like you, but I'll admit.
Dude \n\nWhat the fuck man
The bird wasn't injured that is bullshit. That is his excuse for trying to get out of doing such a horrible thing. Expose this man and let's hold him down and do the same to him and see how he likes it!! Who's with me???
YouTube should probably take this off trending
It s not real because if it was weres the blood from the head plus a gose will  run away if u get as close as that
I AM NOT INVOLVED WITH THIS VIDEO ANYHOW.

I GUARANTEE ZIAS GONNA REACT TO THIS 🔥🔥
That startup made my boner shoot through the goddamn ceiling. Can I get it in ringtone form please?\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso GODDAMN that unskippable cutscene gives me major Link to the Past flashbacks.
The closed captions make this even better. Now I have to watch all the rest of your videos again with closed caption on. :D
Awesome! : D \nWhen i watch one of your videos, it reminds me when i was a child and playing SNES! : D
I NEED THE FULL FINAL BOSS THEME
Great one, miss the cave level tho
This guy made exactly the same video as last time and I still love it.
always that water level. ..
I like how this is soo true
Water level music would be so enjoyable if not for the ptsd...
Please make a full extended version of the boss theme
sound ending look like music mr.bean
I.. I liked the water level :|
I need the full version of that final boss theme please
I need that boss theme on a long version ! D:
What's the OST at the end of the video?
>you have to get 1st place for literally no reason at all\nI see someone else dropped Giants: Citizen Kabuto at the same place I did.
Is there a song that has the similar sound of the Start Up at 0:00? Really love all your other tracks!
Can't wait for part 3, featuring:\nSad Ice Level, (stupid floors)\nTechno Space Level,\nBamboo Asian Level, (Oriental Riff may be major motif)\nOminous Castle Theme,\nVery Ominous Right-Before-Final-Boss- Recovery Room,\nAnd\nNostalgic Credits Theme
This video describes perfectly my experience with zelda ocarina of Time xD
I was expecting Ocean man at the end
Water level or Tenpenny's tower... Just saying
You’re so hot 🔥
having subtitles on was a bad decision
absolutely none of this was copied from or inspired by nintendo or any nintendo product thank you please don't sue me 1:19
can you do water level , and race theme full???
Someone here who knows how to code make a game with this music & objective
What’s the racing mini game supposed to be from
back at it again with The Stare™
Make this into an actual game pls.
Who makes the hoodie you've got on in the video? I would like to get an Åhus hoodie or something similar!
this triggered my final fantasy ptsd. thanks seth i hate you
turn on the subtitles haha
holy cow i love your poker face expression and i would totally like to tap that smooth shaved head of yours.. #totallyappropriate
this was all so accurate, amazing
Why does the boss theme sound like music from Pokémon ruby and sapphire?
Biggest boss...you actually unpacked your shit during the making of this vid? Love your stuff, want more originality, 7/10. Costumes 8/10. Wish you would post more often...10 bananas out of 10 bananas.
I'm fucking crying lmao this was great 😂😂😂👌🏾
Music from The Legend of Zelda: OoT in 2 minutes xD
god is bigger than the boogie man
He faces is the best
No-one is asking the important question, why does the hoodie say ANUS?
The start of the final boss theme kinda sounds like the start to a kahoot song
the end theme reminds me of mr bean for some reason
That Start Up got me wetter than Harvey
So would moving the speed higher be considered a speedrun?
You should actually do some music for video games. That would be absolutely amazing...
Make a full length version of the boss battle
is this of a actual game lol
i want the song as a ringtone
The fire level was more like desert level
You're a legend
I WANNA PLAY THIS GAME \n\n\n\n*Take my money*

When you started playing the Song that played in the credits, I thought you were playing AoT OP2 lol
Turn on captions, makes it 10 times better.\n\nI found the hidden message for having CC (Captions on) :)
i remember the second phase in the boss level, that was so unexpected
Every video he looks more and more like Gru.
Aaw man! I want all of these too be full songs. Specially the racing and boss one.

I love these
penis head
2:28 that last note tho
Sounds great!
Your a genius dud
Epic
Agent 47 is back.
“Good God almighty, good God almighty, that killed him…as God as my witness he is broken in half”
YOU JUST MADE THE LIST
Did that look fake to anyone else
it's fake, now back to my porno because that's real
it looks scripted
Looked scripted to the fuck..
Fake as fuck
It looks like he hurt his lower back during that takedown and his opponent notices it and be like fck it Im Doing the Walls of Jericho Maaaaannnnnn!
WWE fans here>
Kudos to FCC for putting this video up. Outrageous and incredible finish. Jonno Mears is my new hero.
It's fully legit and it would break you in half . It's all about posting luck we're you end up out of a scramble. This is a rare finish to get the two legs
Fake as fuck.\nThat dude got a pillow punch to the face @:28 and turtled up his face leaving his legs limp for 3 seconds as if he was asleep.\nI call bs
MMA fans are the most retarded fans in all of sports. Everything is fake except mma 😂
Looks 100 percent fake.  I've been rolling for over 10 years and NEVER seen anyone lay there while a guy fumbles with his legs, or roll stomach down from love taps.   Troll.  That was the SLOWEST leg grab / clumsy as hell transition that I've ever seen.
Next please God let someone win a mma match with a RKO or a Stone Cold STUNNER
Get the fuck outta here lol
Clearly fake. If it was real they would be continuously ringing the bell while he nods his head to apply more pressure.
Walls of Jericho? That move is older than WWE... If only they watched good old Lucha Llibre........
That was some seriously fake shit right there.  Anyone who actually believes that was not a work, I have some prime real estate on the moon to sell you. Dirt cheap.
Dude that lost looks like he's never seen any type of grappling before. \n\nEither he was that bad and unskilled or this is fake as fuck.
This was real I watched this happen so fuck all u mongy cunts who say it’s fake ahah weridos
It's not fake. Allegedly he slipped a disc in his spine on that dlt so you can only imagine the effect of contorting his legs and lower bavk
lion tamer is much better than the walls
That actually does work.. it seems like he got it to easy but that shit actually hurts enough to get someone to tap... you back can only bridge so far and the more he goes the more pressure on your chest... bushing up only hurts your back more...its hard to explain you must experience it to know what i mean.
That was an insult to anyone with eyes.
you know what happens when you use the walls of jericho without jerichos permission ?\nyou know what happens !!
The way the guy was making weird faces the whole time, and just laying there like a fish out of the water... Looks fake, still fun submission tho
here is a vid I did years ago on half-crab, and a half crab was ACTUALLY legit done in Indian MMA a few years back fyi https://youtu.be/fA1NxkhnYdM
Jericho mears
If you ever been on this submission you will know that this move makes it hard for people to breathe when in this position
I need to do this when i fight someone
Fixed, Zangief from street fighter was trying to get into the move before it was being done on him...
It's not Boston Crab, it's just crap
Where are the other fights ?
This looked fake as hell, dude was making zero effort to get up at 0:30, just let it happen.
some moves are in the WWE are effective in real life combat situation
Guy hurt his back and was winded by the fall, this wouldn't have worked if his opponent was not in a weakened state.
That guys back looked broken from the takedown. Why would you even MMA if you can get beat with THAT pro wrestling move.  Tough way to make a buck
I had the Bolton Crabs ! strange really ? As the Crab had a shaved pussy ?
He knew what he was doing all along, you can tell he had already planned it
imagine if it was the lion tamer
guy hurt himself on the takedown, thats why he could get it
Really looks fake wtf! Why would anyone agree to being embarrassed like that
Oh my that's so fake. Please don't destroy the reputation of mma with these fake fighters
CAN WE GET A STONE COLD STUNNER NEXT WEEK.
Fucking easy. I always do this to my sister. Lol
He tapped only because he hurt his back, You can see him grimacing from pain after the takedown.
fake nothing else to say
Fake a planned
You just made the list !
BREAK THE WALLS DOWN
Break the walls down
LOL he gave him his right leg.. all he had to do is extend his right leg, get on his right hip and shake his left leg. i cant believe people are falling for this fake bullshit
Aaron Jones looked hurt after the takedown, then took a good shot to the right eye and went defensive belly down, he was hurt and in cover mode so the boston crab was easy to setup. I think this is legit. You watch too much UFC and you forget there are some pretty bad fighters out there who can get caught by something like this
Boy was that set up. No way in hell a pro fighter would let anyman sit on his back and slowly grab both of his legs smh. When i saw this i thought there was going to be some crazy set up to get the sub but that was just one guy allowing the other guy to do it wtf is that bs
Punches were half hearted. Reactions to them were too strong.
пипец, реслинг теперь в клетке устраивают?))
Faker than WWE
WTF, 100% fake, no way!!!
Fake as fuck
That looked so homoerotic
pmsl nice
Amazing finish!
🎶 You can't wrestle, tan tan tan tan tan 🎶
Caralho!!! John sena
what a joker
fake and gay
0.27 that fake punch lol
Ha
Fucking UFC Creative buried him
NOT FAKE
OMG J.R ITS THE WALLLLSSSS!
Looks faker than WWE.
Fake as shit
looks scripted
jajajajajajaj que malos tio
FAKE
WWE FAN HERE
Fake.
WWE
About as real as a leprechaun flying a unicorn
You do realize when applied properly, a boston crab will get you a submission...I've done it; just sayin'.
BOSTON crab. Not Bolton.
Jonno gets style points for sticking the tongue out
Back in 199X it use to be Boston crab now it's Bolton who?
That looks set up  and definitely not walls of Jericho
It's not the walls of Jericho.  Jericho puts a knee in ur back
That punch was so fake before the SHARP SHOOTER.
Alright, Now if they can pull off a Figure-Four or a Sharpshooter, then maybe I’ll watch an MMA match.
I was literally thinking the other day that I'm surprised a figure 4 leg lock hasn't been done in UFC yet as it's pretty easy to do and extremely effective
FAKE
The fact that they called it before he even grabbed both legs makes it look hella fake. Not gonna judge tho.
scripted better than EastEnders
That gay gave that to him
GOAT
LOL
Probably fake but still that move hurts like fuck, anybody with older siblings who are WWE fans will relate all too well
That was a pure set up .Pure theaterised shite. Mma fans of purity will have seen tight through that one 👎
Dana White's Lookin For A Fight...... won't be lookin here!
*BOSTON CRAB
Damn, she sounded amazing at only 13. I'm 13 and I sound like a strangled cat when I sing.

SHES PENG
SHE IS SO ADORABLE
why isn't she wearing the head phones it's kind of bothering me
I still remember the lyrics to this is me even after a decade after it came out. I still love that song. ♥️♥️♥️
Demi's hair looks so great in this video!!
Before they played the first song I was in the middle of typing my favourite song she's ever sang is (this is me) then they played it and I was so happy💜
omg they have skyscraper in  Spanish!?!!! 😱😱😱 Her laugh is so cute!
Alguien que me embotelle la risa de Demi porfa 😍😍
El final duele :( me gusta mucho Skyscraper en español, y ni siquiera sabe qué dice xD en fin, I still love you, Demi! <3 and please, learn a little bit of spanish(?) xD \nLa tristeza, me castiga, se apropia de mi ser; puedes llevarte mi ilusión, romperme todo el corazón... (8)
sola me voy a levanta, como un rascacielos, como un rascacielos!
Pero te juro que al final, solo me voy a levantar como un rascacielos. aldjaldjd Fallas pelada. hahahaha te amo.
No se pero Demi está hermosa en esta entrevista
¿Por qué no cantó RASCACIELOS? Demi, debes aprender español mija.
No entiendo nada de lo que dicen, solo entendí la parte cuando sale Rascacielos y cuando ella dice como un rascacielo .. 😅 Amo esa canción porque con esa la conocí ❤ también amo su risa😂.. 😍
Lol 😂
*Pero te juro que al final, sola me voy a levantar! como un rasca cielo...* me duele que no se la sepa ajajaa
Alexandra owned that dance!! Nice to see the judges give it so much love too ;)
After this I wanted to dance. I did...\n\nI danced against a door and now my head is aching. \nWhat is my life?
I think I have a weird obsession with this routine.. I keep creepingly coming back to watch it.. can't get over it.. and I know this may sound weird but I want them to date.. they are such a great looking pair... Shipping them so hard...
Seriously undermarkef
This was *LIT* - cannot wait to see how firey their Argentine Tango is gonna be (whenever they get it)
If they are shagging \nI definitely don't blame her 😂
She's still a little sloppy and lacks fluidity, so let's not sugar coat her ability to dance too much.
Que arte♡
This is perhaps the only time I've thought that Jennifer Lopez song has ever sounded good, haha! A thrilling paso. There were a few rough spins and I wish that the walking transitions looked a bit more musical rather than rushed. Nonetheless, the 36 was definitely justified, in my view. Great choreo from Gorka and it really showed off Alexandra's grace, speed and power.\nOverall, I'm rooting for Alexandra. Despite (thankfully) the few idiotic bores further down in the comments section playing into misomelangyny and claiming she's 'arrogant' and 'up herself', she's a very talented, professional and unassuming entertainer that evidently not only dedicates herself to her craft but also – more importantly – enjoys it. I sincerely hope she gets into the final.
Great British people, I am calling for you to vote for this amazing couple! As I can not do it myself from Czech republic, please keep amazing Gorka and fabulous Alexandra until the finals! And I am going to watch this ten more times.
YASSSS work alex!! best dance on strictly in a while
Oliver AndMiaVEVO\nOliver AndMiaVEVO\n1 second ago\nwhat is the last number of your like:\n1-Davood and Nadiya \n2-Mollie and AJ \n3-Chizzy and Pasha\n4-Gemma and Aljaz \n5-Rev Richard Cole and Dianne\n6-Susan and Kevin\n7-Charlotte and Brendan\n8-Alexandra and Gorka \n9-Aston and Janette\n0-Joe and Katya  \n\nLeave a comment telling me if you think this is a cool idea and who you got i cant wait to find out also keep dancing\nMia and Oliver vevo
Alexandra as good as as pro - in 2 weeks !! Paso Doble and Alexandra made for each other
WOW!!! ........and only week 2!! Gorka.......you really hit the jack-pot when you were partnered with this girl!!!!
i sincerely hope that alexandra and gorka don't get the same treatment that natalie gumede and artem got a few years back. in my opinion, natalie has been the very best dancer to appear on strictly (with, or, without previous experience argument). alexandra could well equal the achievements of natalie. absolute pleasure to watch over and over again.
She started of really good but her nerves kicked in you can see her legs shaking and a view steps missed but all in amazing for UK
We love Strictly and this year there are so many brilliant contestants
SLAYYYY
I couldnt keep my eyes of her.. her every move was so entertaining and beautiful as well as passionate.. the chemistry between the both was on another level in this performance
This dance!!! OH MY GOODNESS
One of the best dances ive seen on strictly, loved it! They've got such amazing chemistry together and Gorka, be still my beating heart!! 😍 I thought no one could replace Aljaz as my number 1 strictly crush but Gorka's giving it a good go lol
I'm so glad this _hopefully_ means Gorka will get to stay in for the long run this year. I'm still bitter that he and Tameka were voted out in week 3 last year. I hope this is his year!
This felt like the first moment of the series.And in a frankly not too deep field this year,barring accidents, she's a finalist.I have to say I haven't quite warmed to her yet,but that's more about me with driven people.This was a delight by the way.Also I felt she was strangely undermarked last week.
This is one of the best dances I have seen on strictly. The song was just perfect too.. I like that they did the Spanish version. But I agree with what Darcy says, the way Alexandra expresses herself to the music is amazing to watch.
I genuinely can't believe the intensity she attacked this with and the difficult technique that she nailed - amazing.
I normally hate the Paso but this was so good :)
British clapping annoys the crap out of me. And i'm British.
Who knew she could be this intense? I thought I would pass out after watching this dance
Watched this back so many times now. Mainly, because at least the first 10 times I couldn't take my eyes off of Gorka, he's sooo pretty!!! Alexandra, though absolutely smashed it! You go girl!
I think that is a very good example of somebody who understands ballroom dancing and the little details of flamenco (paso doble). Very well executed by both.
They definitely saved the best till last. Fab-u-lous as Craig would say. Alexandra danced like a pro, and Gorka looks hot. Not my overall favourites, but one of them (I think it's hard to have a fave this early). It's a 10 from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the new Alesha Dixon!
Incredible! I usually lose interest during some of the dances, but this was such a dramatic and intense performance, perfectly executed, that I had to come and watch it on here again!
She dancing with her massa
Its just a lot of flicking around, kinda easy!
https://youtu.be/fF8W_BDRqWo
If only people were as passionate about spirituality and humanity as they are about dancing lol.
She is going to WIN this show
Wow what a performance  , never ever seen a pass like that . Alexandra  you can dance
Yaaaaaaaas that was so fast!!!
She's incredibly flat footed it's painful to watch 😬 she did a good job and that but her technique is not good but then it's only week 2
If thats how she preforms the Paso, I CANNOT Wait for her Tango and Argentinian Tango
Oh my god\nHow beautiful is the male dancer!!!!!
Where the 40 at?
Amazing xxxx
Fantastique
Cough cough decency please Man!
Possible Strictly winner??!!
Get um Alex!
OMG love this girl. Amazing and only week 2. It's gonna be fantastic final. Betting on Alexandra, Aston and Debbie in final.
Brilliant.
😍😍😍
On da floooorrrr
9
Absolutely sensational 👏👏👏
SSSLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
Honestly rewinded this dance more than 10 times last night. Parents got annoyed so I went to bed- secretly keeping watching on YouTube. You're my faves guys- literally was dreaming last night I was dancing with Gorka
No she did no just slay my life
The best in years since Alesha and fit Gorka too! Loved this in ironic Spanish
I am now at the age where I have started to watching Strictly.. Where is my pipe and slippers?
My new single Two Sides To You is now available on Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, GooglePlay and more! \nHead over to my Facebook page to get the links! \nFacebook.com/SayshaWilliamsMusic. Xo
I love strictly come dancing
I Also Think Alexandra & Gorká Would Earn The 2017 Glitterball!
AMAZING FIREY HOT PASSION SOMEONE HELP COOL DOWN THE FLAMES!
This would have been amazing at any stage... but for week two?  Outstanding!
Alexandra is just beyond talented, she owned x-factor and now Strictly too. She’s a superstar.
Alexandra Burke wow she was once a singer...
My favourite couple on Strictly Come Dancing this year love them!
Genuinely thought Alexandra was one of the professionals in this episode omdsss
She was so hot and fiery I couldn't take my eyes off her... and Gorka had his gorgeous chest out! =P It was a dance worthy of a 10 or two; and if it wasn't only week two, I think we might have seen it.
I used to love her on X Factor but damn. Her dancing is as good as her singing!
she is an amazing dancer... she is a bit smug but honestly this is an unbelievable performance by her for week 2 of the show and not much experience
Great dance for Week 2. 9/10
I'm probably the only one who didn't enjoy this dance. I like power and attack but she came across as psychotic. I liked her dance last week more.
They are smoking hot….Thank hmmm Gorka has a partner that can dance so we can see him in full view! Yum Yum Yum!!!!! Can’t wait for next week
Can't believe what I'm watching considering it's only the second week. AMAZING!
Alexandra and Gorka are simply the best better than all the rest better than anyone who's ever been on the show before things can only get better by the strength and sheer excellence of this dance
Alexandra didn't came to play !
Used to admire Alexander when she won the Xfactor, she stated music was her life and all she wanted was to sing. Since her first album I've heard virtually nothing from her. As with most X factor winners they get one or two albums out and then give up and settle for doing adverts when their money runs out. She's still massively talented but I'm disappointed in her lack of commitment to what was her apparent dream.
Naturally Get Rid of Pigmentation & Dark spots \nhttps://youtu.be/YEwsstcNSl0
Hmm, I was thinking before it started: this'll be ok... 0.12 BAM!!! Jump-spin and the fireworks exploded. Definitely worth the score and the standing ovation from CRAIG that it received!
I'm still amazed at this & it's only the 2nd week!! Thrilled for Gorka who went out too soon last year!!!
I adore this dance!
Jls and the Saturdays face ...like WTF face lol hilarious
You strictly lot need to learn to dance this is how you do it http://youtu.be/uupZlTULD1w
They remind me of Normani and val anyone else?
Omg she's absoulty stunning! Amazing dancer and so much passion! I hate all these talent shows but I'm a little bit tempted to start watching this one because of her but I won't
Uno what gets me\n Aston has more views for his dance. And I'm sorry he is certainly not as good as this. I now know he will win the show just cous he has biggest fan base not cool
Blooming heck that was amazing!
Just curious if any of you women out there have complained to BBC about Gorkas outfit....or lack of? I mean after all, it is a 'family show'. I mean... .Dont you all go crazy when the pro girls show too much leg or tits? Amazing how quiet you all are when there is a 6 pack on show! Pffft.
I do get annoyed when Alexandra talks but she is such a talented singer and dancer! This definitely tho is the performance of the night! Possible one of the best paso doble performances I've ever seen actually! 😱💚
One of the best dances in Strictly history. Would have been 10s a few weeks down the line.
Since when did John fashanu join the strictly contestants?
Ohh shock shock another \nCompetitor that got a big applause .. for dancing well  ..\nOh I forgot they danced before??? it's a fair competion  ok let me see Aston ,Debbie ,Alexander ..I thought it was about stars that never danced before and see how they come on threw the weeks .. it's \nabit unfair as the dancers are a bit disadvantage .
Who is the most annoying person in the world?\n\nAlexandra Burke by a country mile.\n\nMy idea of hell would be to be stuck in a lift with her....
Another one who has been taking dancing lessons way before the series started..pathetic..
I don't get it, this just didn't have the paso feel that Debbie's had last week. Emperor's new clothes springs to mind...
A great dance but you can’t compare her to the others. She has a lot of dance experience and shouldn’t be on an amateur dance comp against people with no dance experience at all
Alexandra is also dance trained yet nobody seems to give her grief compared with Debbie
Too fast and too aggressive needed more content. Thumbs down.

Where is Kristen channel? I think you tagged the wrong Link
Youtubers are the cancer of the internet.
You two are hilarious together!!
Any small YouTubers wanna subscribe to each other ☺️? If so subscribe & comment when done so we can subscribe back !
Liza's reaction at the end of the video 😂
As a vegan I am ok with this.
I just... Want a friendship like this
holy shit the girl on the right with the nose piercing shows more gums than teeth when smiling. I'm sure that there is a operation for it though.
Seems pretty distasteful to make light of people born with birth abnormalities.
When you click on the link Liza put to subscribe to Kwisten, the link says this channel does not exist 😂
So now Liza uploads on Thursdays and Mondays : D
Thank you so much Liza, I have had a really hard time at school as I have just moved up not secondary school and I find it quite hard to concentrate so I get things wrong and the teachers yell at me which almost brings me to tears, even when I feel like I can never be happy you make me feel happy and forget about skl thank you so much❤️❤️

This Rashida Jones story is the best thing this week ☺️💚
Hahaha u crack me up haha amazing, i can so imagine how chuffed u felt, whats the chance! Go g♥️rl😘👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I loving your vids when I get a chance, I've said it before so cool and effortless chic. Love the video : )\n\nNatoya
Love the Dr Jart.  I finished one tube and agree about the packaging.  I took off the pump and turned it upside down for several days into a smaller pot.  Then I knocked the pot on the floor.  Splattered up into the air and landed on the carpet, the dog and places I probably still haven't found.  Still love the product.  So does my dog.
Love that a previous season item of clothing is back in rotation in your favourites! You have such great ethics Anna
I love parks and rec too!!! So amazing that you met rashida!! \nBtw you should totally watch brooklyn 99 if you haven’t yet. It reminded me of parks and rec and i abolutely love it!!
great faves girl!
Oh my worddd 😜 Loved this vid
You're so cute❤️
You‘re so hilarious 😂
That DemyLee sweater looks SO cosy!
That Rashida Jones story though 🤣... amazing!
What an amazing story!!
That whole Rashida Jones suitcase story 👌👌👌
And the lovable, adorkable award goes too... awww Anna!
The Rashida Jones story!!! 😱😱
Great video Anna! 👍🏻😄
Great Rashida Jones story time!
Hi
really liked your rashida jones story! lol
Hilarious 😆 lounge incident!!!
Rashida frickin Jones! 🤘🏼🎉😱
#luggagegoals I guess!
💕💕💕
You are too cute lol !
Loved your story about suitcase!!
You are SO adorable with that luggage story!!! 🤗😂
Hi Anna! I love your videos. Is there anyway I can get a nomakeupday jumper in xl?
Dr. Jart is pronounced with the J sound, not the Y sound :)
I love you. Period. You make me smile and giggle.\nThank you! :)
Great video! Thinking of getting the jeans but not sure what length - how tall are you? :) Thanks! xx
There's a light version of the dr jart B.B. Sometimes I mix it up. 🤗
That suitcase is so cute! Def planning to get one!
Hey Anna! Do the straight leg jeans give when you wear them or do they stay nice and snug? Xx
Just ordered 2 pairs of MOTO jeans 😎 Been on the hunt for a great everyday non-skinny style, hope these fit the bill!!!
Now all I can hear is Chris Traeger saying Anne Perkins. Great video, as always!
I love your accent!!xx
The Rashida Jones Luggage link doesn't work! It just leads to their main page :(  Are they sold out or unavailable now?
I'm also a serial luggage purchaser and the Away ones look like they could end my habit! Amazing - thank you :)
I love your hair!!
I thought it was Moto as in Motorbike as in Moto Jacket? Not Motto? Have i been pronouncing it wrong for like 12 years?
what is that brush you always use to put on your foundation? i need it!
you watch Parks n Rec! have you seen Brooklyn 99 as well?? it's by the same writers <3
Great video, Anna. I love the framing of this shot. I'm definitely tempted by that pretty suitcase (but don't think I travel enough to justify it - bummer!) xx
Love the story about the luggage :) The leopard print boots are so pretty. I will have to check out the jeans too.
You are the cutest! Such a cool moment!! :) and the luggage looks awesome too!!
I love september favourites because I am do not like necessarily researching new trends so I found your videos very helpful and I really like your energy. Great video x
I found out about Parks and Rec through you, and just streamed all the seasons. But it seems like the Rashida Jones collection is not on Away anymore?
That story time was so hilarious 😭😂😂
You're just adorable! Loved the Rashida Jones moment - looks like now I'll need some new luggage as well....
you walking past rashida jones would be me walking past you tbh
Rashida Jones is SUCH a badass, how did you resist asking her to go to coffee so you could pick her brain? (Please, I say that as if I would do that - I'd be as awkward as you were in that moment, because holy crap it's Rashida Jones!)
Love your videos! I feel like we are friends haha
So, you have a book signed by Aziz Ansari, and you've met Rashida Jones.... I am so jealous!!!
Rashida Jones just gave thumbs up on this video.
Anna, can you find a slightly enhanced version of Glossier Like? Been searching!
Oh Anna, now I've got the giggles; that was suitcase story gold. Thanks for sharing! See you next time!
I can't find the pink on their website. Don't tell me it's gone 😭😭😭
such a fun story! lol
The booties are sold out in every size. Can you suggest a dupe? Thanks.
I love Rashida Jones as well. This was a really cute post. I'm a luggage W_ore as well and now I must explore your suggestions. Have a great October.
Any tips on how to wash raw hem denim? I throw mine in the machine but the hem gets very frayed which is not the look I like. Thanks!
Loved this video! The Rashida Jones story was hilarious 😂! I always look forward to your videos and they never disappoint
Love your attitude and energy!!!
The Neutrogena Body Oil feels and smells amazing. Definitely an affordable alternative to the Clarins. http://www.neutrogena.com/skin/skin-bath/body-oil/6811101XX.html?cgid=skin-bath#start=7
OMG your face as you tell Rashida Jones anecdote!! So funny! Exactly the face me and my girlfriends make when having a natter over a glass of wine 🍷
Literally got so excited for you when you were telling your rashida jones story 😂 my heart is like pounding lol. Love the video!
How would you compare the Dr Jart versus the IT cosmetics?
You Rashida Jones story is so entertaining, and the fact that you are so excited made me smile. Love the suitcase, shame I just bought a new hard case :(
Rashida is the sweetest! She came into my old job with some friends and hung out for a while. She was so lovely and we both made awkward jokes at each other. Now I just want to be friends with her!
I can't believe that you met rashida!! Parks and Rec is my fave as well! I truly believe you and I are the same Anna, love love all your content <3
Ahaha aww love the rashida jones story, I probably would've been the same as well 😝 So cool though that you met her, loved her on parks and rec!
Please so a workout video with your current routine <3
Your fan girl moment was both funny and sweet! 🤗And I LOVE my Away luggage!
You are so adorable. Especially about the Rashida Jones/luggage thing. Thanks for making me smile and well done on your charity... so much to smile about!
Liking the video before even watching it <3
Would love to see your YouTuber faves too!! I love finding new people and fellow YouTubers to watch xx
Anna, you totally made my evening. Laughed hard on your story about meeting Rashida Jones 😂 Fun fact (not related to luggage though) - Dr. Jart ‘s beauty balm formula is not the same in Korea (South, that is), the country where the brand is originally from, despite having exactly the same packaging. I live in Korea, and I am a big fan of Dr. Jart skincare range (btw if you can get your hands on their Cicapair serum I HIGHLY recommend it). I also purchased their bb beauty balm in high hopes to look like a sun-kissed beach goddess. I think I looked like my nanna’s pearls or her polished china instead. It gave me tonns of glow, but none of that bronze goodness, rather a whitish/pinkish tint 😔 which is not necessarily a bad thing, just not the look I’m going for. On a bright side- it does get better after it sits on my skin for an hour or so.
thank God! i thought you are going to take a break too!
Love your  Sunday videos Anna! The leopard print boots are still so beaut 😍
SUCCESS!!! ANN PERKINS APPROVED YOUR (her) LUGGAGE!!! <3 <3 loved the story!!  *high five*
where is the beautiful cupboard from?
Love a good story time! #LuggageTale 😂
Loved the story with the suitcases =)
The september newsletter rocked my world. Your style of writing is thoroughly enjoyable!
Love the suitcase, but the link doesn't work... I'm in Portugal, maybe that's the reason...
Thank you for telling us the jean size you are in those Topshop jeans Anna, I’m the same height as you (been to your meet ups ^^), and was sure whether to get 32 or 34. Definitely ordering the 32 now! 😊🙌🏻
Hi Anna! Do you use any kind of dust bag to protect your suitcase while traveling? Sometimes airlines are a bit rough with luggage and they get scratched
What is the colour of suitcase???
Take a shot everytime she says oh my word 😀
The Away x Rashida Jones Collection doesn't seem to be available anymore? Think its just the new Amastan colab?! :( xx
I love that I'm not the only one that turns to mush when they meet their idols. X
Anna, have you tried the Zoeva Luxe PETITE Crease brush?! OMG, it's definitely my favorite brush. It's obviously smaller than the regular one you mention here, but I find it so helpful for putting precise amounts of color in my crease or outer corner and then blending with the bigger brush.
I couldn't find the Rashida luggage on the Away website. I'm afraid it's gone 😭
OMG so in love with that CHANEL toiletries bag, where did you get that and can I still buy it? <3 <3 <3
dr Jart! not dr yart please!
You ramble more than you should.
Anna, you're lovely and I love you to bits but PLEASE... Could you stop saying 'I feel like...' quite so much?! As a listener, once you pick up on it, you hear it every single time and trust me, it's a LOT of times...! 🙉
That Rashida Jones story - I genuinely almost cried out of excitement for you. Can't believe you met Ann Perkins.
you always look amazing anna but can i say you look extra fab in this video? WOW! i’m screenshoting all the products you’re wearing to add to shopping list 😘😂

Kay. You just put tears in my eyes. Such a big inspiration. Go'head on w ya honey girl💯🙌
I like my girls just like I like my honey; sweet A little selfish I like my women like I like my money; green A little jealous 'Cause I'm a beautiful wreck A colorful mess, but I'm funny Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet With a stone-cold neck, yeah, I'm charming  [Refrain] All the pretty girls in the world But I'm in this space with you Colored out the line I came to find, my fire was fate with you Heartache would stay with you Fly great escapes with you  [Verse] I countdown to the clock, saw you awake Don't walk away, or would you wait for me? I go out to the bar, fuck hangin' with the stars Don't even have a car, but you would wait for me  [Refrain] All, all, all, all the pretty girls in the world All the pretty girls in the world But I'm in this space with you Colored out the line I came to find, my fire was fate with you My heartache would stay with you Escape with you  [Chorus] I like my girls just like I like my honey; sweet A little selfish, huh I like my women like I like my money; green A little jealous Oh, I'm a beautiful wreck A colorful mess, but I'm funny Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet With a stone-cold neck, I'm so charming, oh, oh  [Bridge] La-la-la-la-la-la-la Do-do-do do-do Do-do-do do-do Do-do-do do-do Da-da-da da-da Do-do-do do-do  [Outro] Is it love all we need? Is it love? Do-do-do do-do To be the same prophesy? Is it love? Do-do-do do-do Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti, is it love? Do-do-do do-do Love, do-do-do do-do
all her music is so beautiful
I LEGIT FREAKED OUT WHEN I SAW THIS IN MY FEED QUEEN IS COMING BACK
Here before 200k views and here before it gets big #earlygang
Lool was walking on campus when I got this notification and stopped to get my headphones out my bag because I couldn't wait 😩
Such a good song 💕💕✨💛
The voice is beautiful and this song is amazing but the reason I am not a hardcore fan is the sometimes the rhythm and beat is not really hitting the spot or it’s not really original. They have similar features to a lot of old pop songs. I mean the lyrics are, damm good but it’s just a little constructive criticism or a feeling from a fan that doesn’t really know anything about music.
Such a beautiful song sung by a beautiful soul.
Ugh mom ive been waiting for some beautiful acoustics from you, i know this is from the heart💛
Here at 127K hoes so don’t hit me when this song start poppin 😭
I would LOVE to hear Tori Kelly cover this song!
she is so beautiful
A song with SZA is all we need
the world needs a song like this
she’s so precious and talented. A FUCKING QUEEN.
My new all time favorite song. LOVE KEHLANI💛💛
Yes so excited for new music! Already love love this song!!
KEHLANI and SZA need TO: COLLABORATE, bring your beautiful spirit's together!!!!!!!..............SAVE my LIFE FROM,....................................................\n EXHAUSTIIIIIIIIIION.#CTRL#SWEETSEXYSAVAGE\nKINDRED SPIRIT'S
This is gay\nThis is perfect
She is so beautiful with a voice to match❤️
Dedicated this song to myself since im straight and single lol
lyrics please
Thank you Kehlani.

Was immediately reminded of this scene when I heard Tom Petty passed away. Rest in peace, man.
RIP Master Tom Petty! thanks for everything.
fly high tom petty
RIP Tom Petty
Rip tom petty ;(...
This clip picked up 100+ likes in a day. RIP Tom Petty. Legend
Best scene ever. RIP Tom Petty...
R.I.P. Tom Petty ~
Hahaha his face when he's trying to find the right song
Das könnte auch Ich im Auto sein. CD von Petty im Kasten und dann: Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Falling......:-)
Freaking midget
Tom Cruise singing before it was cool. Makes me wonder if the people behind Rock of Ages saw this and thought, Let's have him play Stacee Jaxx! Love both movies btw.
My LOVE!
free fallin'💔
One of all time favourite scenes ever since I was a kid! Great film, and one of Tom's finest performances. 
one of the best actors everrrrrrrrrr... and so kind to his fans... I admire him very much
he is still the best lookin guy ever
Cameron Crowe knows how to put together a great soundtrack...
This song is 'free falling' of the Tom Petty!
Absolutely amazing scene!!! I love you Tom ;)
Love you Tom!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Can anybody tell me who's song is this?\n
I´ve seen girls driving the car screaming at the top of their voices ... isn´t it a bit of a paradox??
Omg❤️❤️❤️❤️
okay I'm really shocked that tom cruise can sing 
er liebt Klasse Musik, deswegen ist sein Sohn Connor auch DJ, der darf machen was er will. Vor wegen Scientology schreibt alles vor,Blödsinn, da gibt es Freiheiten und das muss zum Erfolg führen, hilf dir selber andere tun es nicht
#RIP Tom
Another music legend has gone. RIP Tom Petty💔🎸
Rest In Peace legend 😭😭
Rip Tom petty
When it was unconfirmed that Tom Petty died: Tom Petty has died. Will you stop saying that!?\n\nWell, unfortunate to have it finally confirmed... Rest easy, Tom. Running Down A Dream
RIP Tom Petty. Nice clip. Way too soon and really unexpected.
RIP, Tom.
R.I.P
RIP Tom Petty.

I wish I could celebrate Halloween in the USA someday, because I live in The Netherlands and sad enough Halloween is not very big over here, especially in the town were I live in. (Halloween does get bigger and bigger every year in The Netherlands  tho. 😃) I just love oktober,autumn, pumpkins and Halloween and the whole atmosphere around it!
I love you, Bunny! XDOctober is such a fun month and you make it that much better. :)I BELIEVE IN JACK-O-LANTERNS!!!
When I was shopping for Halloween decorations today in a UK grocery store. An elderly lady stood behind me was looking at my decorations & was like, oh no, I don't like that. When did Halloween get so big. (As in the UK it never was for years). Anyway, the checkout lady went, it's an American thing. I was thinking, it's nowhere near as big as in America! I wish it was! Most stores have ONE aisle of Halloween decorations, compared to the US full stores dedicated! I'm so damn jealous! Although, I've still managed to spend nearly $200 on stuff here lol! I'd be bankrupt if I lived in the US!
Yesss follow me around target! Yes follow me around Wal-mart!! Yess video on you setting up the jack-o-latern!!!
Hi  Hi bunny! Your super pretty and very funny!!!

Hey guys I am doing a dissertation about lecturers using lecture capture. (recording their own lectures and posting them on university website) please please can you answer the questions, it will only take 2 mins and 7 short questions https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/NNQVYCH
Harrison Ford is lucky that his training in his previous profession has prepared him for the style of acting he aspires too, he was a carpenter wasn't he?
Reese Witherspoon look like she boutta take out a knife and stab Margot in the neck
Graham looks like he taped his suit with black duct tape
Harrison ford just wants to go smoke weed
THIS IS WHY GRAHAM NORTON IS MY FAVOURITE TALK SHOWWWWW
I love Harley but not this women. I think I'm in love with a character 😭😭😭😭
Harrison’s face when he was offered the tattoo 😂... I wish he had done it
Lol Harrison Ford and all of them are awesome
Hey Graham, did you know Kit Harrington was selling his car? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-MHoIyW4E0&t=1s
Are you alright?\n\nJust good.\n\nGives a big smile. I swear in his mind, he's chanting that he can't believe Margot is doing to this... Doing a tattoo on his foot. It's like his dreams just came true.
He could cut that toe off, preserve it in formaldehyde and sell it for *thousands*
i love of let margot tattoo my bolix not my foot....
Reese witherspoon is so jealous margot is getting the attention
Dear Producers at TGNS, please be more diverse in your guests. Week in week out your guests are white! yes you have Idris Elba & Chris Rock on this Friday I know but every other week the show is constantly white.
He could sell that on eBay!

And find out
https://youtu.be/fF8W_BDRqWo
whats his name the old guy
Reese is a buzz kill :/
That IT smile in the thumbnail's just creepy
Don’t get tattooed by someone who calls it a “gun”😂
Harrison Ford is done with this world
Margot is so cool and a bit weird
is that woman sitting by Margot,  the girl from clueless ?
She could tattoo me all day !!! Love u Margot !!!
Now cut it and sell that toe on eBay. Lol.
She is so cute :)
Margot robbie can tattoo me any second of my life
The new Marilyn Monroe. Sexiest white girl living
Two in the pink and one in the stink
Am I the only one who loves Graham Nortons Suit? It looks really good tbh 😅🤷🏻‍♀️
That should have been me
division trust standard gwqnwf practical category crowd maker.
OMG Margot robbie feet yummy <3
Wouldn't be surprised if that got infected. She didn't wipe down or sanitize the area before tattooing
The look of sheer terror on Harrison Ford's face when he KNEW he was going to be singled out.
I'm a simple man, I see Margo Robbie, I click
Have I seen that Adam somewhere before???
Id let her tattoo my toe just so she can touch me. ID ask if i could put my big toe in her mouth as well
I'm willing to get a tattoo from her, even though i hate tattoos...\nThat's how much i love her! 😍
I'd pay alot of money to get a toe tat by that sexy beautiful creation of the gods, Harrison Ford!
Low class, tacky, sure signs of lowlife losers. I wouldn't get a tattoo if my life depended on it. And if a girlfriend of mine came home with one she can leave and try to be a girlfriend of someone who's equally as skanky.
This is cringy to watch XD
https://youtu.be/uc6eI3GqNpQ     🔥EGO🔥 is the NEW 2018 HIT !!
As a tattooer, I want to die watching this
She's the megan fox of this era :3
Is this a toetoo or a tattoe?
Lol check out my latest Pokémon go video would really appreciate it lol thanks so much
Is there anything margot can't do 😍
If acting doesnt work out anymore...\nShe can make a living doing that... no problem :D\nLove it btw.... Humans are crazy, and this is the crazy i love! :)
Graham Norton needs some good anti aging skin care 👴

Leviticus 19:28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the Lord.
Who's that older guy I've seen him before but I can't quite figure out who he is
he wasn't considering if he wanted the tattoo. he was thinking how do I get out of this...
What a hot prod staff guy
would kill to let margot robbie touch my feet 😍
I bet that guy had a full-blown stiffy by the end of that..... i know I did😓😓😓
I'd get that tattoo no problem by Margo!
Get a tattoo from Margot Robbie on a popular TV show sitting next to Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Gosling, and Harrison Ford. Check.
Please know that JESUS LOVES YOU, JESUS IS LORD, AND JESUS FORGIVES. We are all sinners. We are all on our way to hell, forever. God does NOT want us to end up in hell, a place of eternal, conscious torment and suffering (Not parties). We can all live in eternal paradise with no pain and no suffering forever. It’s one place or the other. Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ Jesus took our punishment for our sins. This is a FREE gift. Many will never know how wonderful a relationship with Jesus is because they are afraid to ask. Try asking. What do you have to lose? Just ask Jesus into your heart and to forgive your sins. It literally costs you nothing, but will give you everything. God Bless.

Witherspoon is cranky because she's Margot outshines her.
It's a tattoo machine not a gun. I would not consider myself to be lucky to be tattooed by her. I am a professional tattoo artist for 13 years now. I have 2 small beginner tattoos and that's it. If your artist says they are shaky but love doing them......Find another artist!!!! I don't care how hot they are or their celberty status.
guys! omg f ree amazon gift cards from here ➜ lythu.com/giftcardsgiveaway?307689663
Hi my name is LaToya a ghetto black name spelled correctly... LMAO!!
It’s sad how accurate this is.
Dude you haven't posted in a year in the main channel I need education
can't tell if led or chin\nYOU'RE TEARING ME APART
no hookups *is already pregnant or has kids* \nno fuckbois \n#singlemommylife\nmy children are my world/my son/daughter has my heart\nI love the office\nI love parks and rec
The amount of girls who's bio are I only swiped right because you have a dog is staggering
Oh dear!!!! Makes me glad that I like dating the old fashion way
I want somebody who challenges me. And somebody I can challenge.
It's always the fat one.
Every female tinder ever: DTF?. Every. Single. Guy. We all have needs. Every. Single. Time.
I wouldn't know, I never get any matches.
You forgot  if I super liked you, it was probably by accident
yeah tinder doesn't work for me
Tinder likes my dog more than I do
Hi I'm Kaitlyn I love Disney going on adventures and going to the beach
A guy who's been trying to find a partner for the last few months on Tinder, I can confirm this is 90% of what I see.
Lol I just had a tinder ad played before this.
Guys subscribe me i will subscribe you back.\nYess i successfully add my comments into 80k videos😊
mfw I got a tinder ad on this video.
Quick tip; most people you swipe won't even see you on their feed. If they add a Snapchat or Instagram account, follow that instead if you are serious
Looks at incorrect spelling for possible child name...
When you match but no reply
Lmao where's the male version of this thats exactly the same but with pictures of fish
Hahahaaa I can only relate to the only have an account for a joke bit.  I used to have a tinder and I actually had a normal profile, except I had vinn diesel paintings as my profile pictures.  And yet I still managed to meet my boyfriend/soulmate, so hey, Tinder ain't all bad
Hiking, adventures, pictures of them being alcoholic thots, rugby, 420 friendly, dog person, trucks, has a kid, overused quotes, shitty pop music. Why are women so... Indescribably predictable and one dimensional?
Got a Tinder ad before the video.
I'm sarcastic. Also be sure to check out the picture of me and the drugged tiger. No hookups!
Don't forget I love to laugh
Looking to have fun really means they're  going through  there hoe phase and the just want to hookup
I also like netflix... and chill too! Hahahaha
Now do one about black women.
Bears, Beets BattleStar Galactica. Best line in the office.
Tinder thought me girls boring as fuck but they want you to be funny and ect...
I'm disturbed that this is incredibly accurate
Females don't need to put work into tinder
Touch my butt and buy me Pizza 😖😖
I am a microwave
I don't know what this tinder thing is precisely but I use it to start a fire. Sounds like our cultures are similar but we thumbs up instead of swipe right.
Congratulations on making trending and getting so many views so fast!
Hopefully not the fat one
What's Tinder? Just kidding. It's like that old site called \nHot or Not right?
Upload on Sam O'Nella Academy more often please, I would appreciate it.
So Tinder is a dating app? Can I join if I'm only interested in getting my dick sucked for as little money as possible?
Always up for an adventure.... Yah, like spending our money.
Why do girls have to specify that they're not into hookups? The fact that they do makes me think that its reverse psychology haha
Don't forget the bitches who don't respond, or act super interested at first but then suddenly stop responding
That's my profile.  But you have to understand tinder is a mess and I've had to move to match. Basically you go on tinder as a woman and you can essentially date anyone of your race between the ages of 18-40. The guys there seem just as basic. Compared to on match where you actually see people based on your interests.
Girlfriend does make up on Boyfriend!!😱😍 Video on my channel👍🏻
They're all obsessed with Gin
Most women go on tinder purely for ego boosting, they don't wanna meet up with strange men (what women does). They only wanna see how much matches they get
I swiped right and nothing happened... duped again..
Can't way to the next millennia when you post another vid
By far the best argument I've heard against online dating is, You don't go to a junkyard to find a nice, new car.
Good music for studying and more! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCra6VD5wenzUL-6E_92m4gQ
Oh also forgot. Must be 6'4 or taller
You forgot the part where they all say they're 420 friendly
ok, now do one for men on tinder.
Why is this trending Sam?
I'm so lonely. I have nobody to call my own.
Swimmingly
Live.Laugh.Love.

almighty Sam, thanks for not making shit videos and can you bless me papa with your awesomeness? SAM bless plz.
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
Make one about guys too
I got a tinder advert before watching this lol
Il ont oublier le Logo Pegi 18
Rho le but de Draxler 😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👏
La démontada de Bordeaux !
ca se prend des scores de set de tennis et ca veut jouer le podium
KING NEYMAR!
Supporter du psg je tire mon chapeau au FCGB qui ont proposés du jeu et respectés le football. ..donc quand je vois des gens se moquer je trouve ça ridicule quand on sait que leur équipe se met à 11 dans les cages en attendant que ça siffle . Donc 6-2 oui mais une opposition digne de ce nom.
Bon ok on s'est fait démonté la gueule, mais je suis content d'avoir vu mon équipe jouer, proposer quelque chose, et pas garer le bus comme on fait et feront certains. Après forcément avec des lacunes defensives telles, contre un Paris efficace et impitoyable comme celui de samedi on prend une branlée, mais merde on finit avec 17 tirs, 6 de plus que Paris, qu'on vienne pas a me dire que ce match annonce un saison catastrophique, au contraire.
Neymar, Mbapé e Cavani, melhor ataque atualmente ❤\nPSG futuro campeão da liga dos campeões.
#TeamPaname 🔴🔵
I from Brazil and I can say , Neymar is the best player of the world at the moment , when Neymar guy played  Santos team  by Pelé  , I always watched , so i wanna say Neymar I love you bye
1:46 #fifa
Pour une fois qu'une équipe ne gare pas le bus pour essayer de prendre 1 point. Merci au Girondin d'avoir joué normalement et d'avoir rien lâcher même avec 6 but pris.
That's why you don't play giroud in goal
Brésil mon amour!
En tant que marseillais je ne peut qu' être objectif. Je trouve cette équipe de Paris impressionnante. l'attaque est juste monstrueuse. Franchement ça fait peur. Cette année en ligue des champions vous pouvez faire quelques choses de propres.
Check this update on barca leaving la Liga to possibly join the French league if the catalan independence win:\n\n https://youtu.be/ns5hcCFgxtc
On attend les chèvre maintenant c'est petite pute marseillaise vont prendre chère 😂👍💍
Doesnt take keeper look like Giroud?
Pwa que des pépites
Allez l'OM
Draxler the monster
Aller om
The goalkeeper is terrible
Check very funny 😄 😁 animation of President TRUMP reacting to NEYMAR's move to PSG, some hilarious 😂 🤣 responses:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tRzR7l7Tpw

Target practice when this can be his year.
C'est Federer contre Monfils ! Score de tennis !
This fucking team... Wow
Aller l om
Et dire que Bordeaux à lâcher Carrasso, je comprend pas. Costil fait un match dégueulasse. Une belle passoire
Costil est pas ouf comme gardien  ...
Le but de Draxler 👏
PSG 2017-2018 campeão da Champions , 🇧🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🗼

Neymar a tiré le pénalty \nOK
Costil les cheuveux ... 0
Mdr bordeaux c prit une rafale
Haha
Allez Paris !!
costil :(
C'est pas score de foot mais un score de tennis
Allez paris
Encore un viol 🤤
Bien ce geste Mbappé 🙏🏻
Notez que c'est Neymar qui tire de penalty😂
les gens préfère trappe rien mdr  et maintenant il préfère   areola  juste pasque il a fait un match de fou face au bayarn  arêtes  un peux      \nil faut choisir  un gardien  numéro 1 pour moi c'est pas les 2
DIEUX MERCI QU ON  A PAS MIS CRISTIANO RONALDO DANS L ÉQUIPE AVEC NEYMAR SINON ÇA AURAI ÉTÉ GRAVE
Paris sont impressionnants et monstrueux...Je redoute le 22...allez l'OM ⚪🔵🔵⚪⚪🔵🔵⚪
Pour une fois que Marseille fait un bon match de son côté... tout le monde s'en fout vu que le vrai régal était (encore) au Parc.
J habite a bordeaux et.on.c fais baiser
Ce PSG va faire mal cette saison.
Ceux qui pensent que c le psg qui remporte la ligue 1 likez moi ça
On a vu que le gardien de but bordelais était décourager au 5eme but du PSG
Tout les Français dois avoir Fiers de Marseille unique à gagné LDC
paris aussi. un  équipe mdr
J'aime voir les fan du PSG qui aime leur idole neymar, mais sachez que vous avez une équipe , et que c'est pas seulement grâce q lui que vois gagnerD'autant plus que Draxler ou encore Mbappe se donne encore plus que neymar sur la pelouse ! L'argent a eu raison de la ligue 1 , GG ^^
va t'informer sur les statistique de messi et cr7 a 25 et puis revient Parler, donner juste quelque mois a mbappe et vs allez voir quil Sera la start du psg
quelque'un peut dire à Neymar qu'il a oublié d'enlever ses bigoudis
Super le PSG et trop fort
On est pas chaud nous
Le PSG marche sur la France a pas de géant!
les lyonnaise qui essaient d’exister a travers le PSG c'est pathétique mdr on a tiré sur la barre  ^^

Quand on regarde les stats 6-2 c'est un peu violent  ; mais bon face à un psg comme ca en confiance après le 3 - 0 au bayern , sans faire le bus comme montepellier , à l'éxtérieur et en ayant au final plus d'occasions que le psg ( assez grosse domination bordelaise en fin des deux mi temps ! ) le contenu proposé était franchement sympoa et même si on se prend 6-2 le match était beau à regarder après la défense et le gardien bordelais ont un peu raté leur match un manque d'engagement ( comme l'a dit rabiot ) car les bordelais partaient un peu vaincus alors qu'ils auraient peut etre pu faire mieux , mais si on regarde la match en soit et pas uniquement le score , moi je trouve que ca présage du bon surtout que l'équipe est encore en rodage ! moi je suis content de ce match même si symboliquement parlant se prendre 6 buts dans la gueule ca fait mal , et en différence de buts cest que un de plus que le bayern donc moi je dis , allez bordeaux !
ICI C'est Paris 🔴🔵🔥🔥
Vous voyez les Parisiens faire ça contre la Juve, le Réal, le Barça, Manchester United ou Manchester City?
Sa prend deux but a la maison contre bordeaux parcontre contre la juve ou le real ce sera pas 2 but
Messi The best
👀.
on dirai monaco l'année derniere
c'est moi ou di maria devient roulier il perd des duels il fait de  mauvaise passe.
En attendant Bordeaux en mettent quand même 2 face au PSG
Sans déconner cassez vous au Qatar les parigots, vous pourrissez la ligue 1.
Se prendre que des buts en contre, par le psg, au parc... C'est quand même un comble. A vouloir jouer son jeu Gourvennec a juste offert le match. \nCa n'a aucun sens.
Ligue 1 Conforama ? Ils sont serieux avec la pub là c'est honteux
Toute façon paris cest bien beau de faire les beaux en championnat mais on attend toujours quelque chose de votre part en europe car a part collectionner les 8eme et les quarts de final ca monte pas plus haut et tout les ans on entend objectifs champions league. Mais quand il sagit du barca ou du real bah ca fait plus grand chose pour moi paris est juste une equipe europeene on va dire moyen haut car a part une coupe intertoto cest tout ce que vous avez\nMais vu les quelques matchs que jai vu cette année vous pouvez la tentez elle est large a votre porter \nBon courage a vous pour leurope \nUn supporter bordelais
Que c'est beau le pouvoir de l'argent sur un championnat sans but
Le PSG est une très belle équipe, toujours agréable à voir jouer. Vous devriez être content s'avoir une telle team en France. Mais non, vous faites les chauvins simplement car ils ont de l'argent.
Mbappe c'est le seul travailleur franchement j'le kiff ce gamin j'aime trop quand il marque
C'est normal que le psg gagne c'est tous des braisilien
Quand Meunier marque c toujours un bon match mdr
Bonne nouvelle kurzawa s est blessé en EDF
Au moins Bordeaux joue au foot et pas au casino
je suis fanne de  lom est je reconnait que le psg sont monstrueux . mais il faut reconnaitre que l'om a fait un match de foues contre nice
AUCUNE GLOIRE NI FIERTÉ A AVOIR lorsque tu joue dans un championnat ultra faible niveau ligue 2 et que les médias essayer de nous vendre ça comme un somment de ligue 1 ; XPTDR.. Surtout lorsqu'en plus tu a des joueuses bordelaises qui se couchent de suite et qui attendent la fin du match pour faire des selfies avec NEYMAR !! Pitoyable.. Une seule chose positif, très beau but de Neymar et celui de Draxler par contre..
la ligue 1 est faible pour le psg
4-2 POUR MARSEILLE POLOPOPOOOPO AH merde c pas ce match excusez moi ...
En league 1 il n'y a que le psg qui m'intéresse le reste des équipes pas intéressant
Draxler ptn je l'aime trop \nBerchiche je le trouve bon
Ligue 1 is shit only one good team no challenge or competition must be boring in that leauge u will hardly see a 4-6 nil in a leauge like  bpl
Super match de basket

I voted for Julia because it's much more easier
Since you mentioned about show suggestions at 3:00, might I recommend the anime Hunter x Hunter? It's a long series, but totally worth it!

I approve of Julia's burger, right up until the ketchup went on...

The only good thing to come out of today. NPR, thank you. You give us so much joy.
Today was such a shitty day but this totally put a smile on my face.
Thank you. Great stuff.
Dana Carvey sure plays a mean fiddle...🤣
banjo master
Bruce Willis on banjo #2 ;)
Planes trains and banjos
Awesome banjo.
He hates those cans!
Love it!!!!
It would be nice if Steve Martin could find something he's good at.
Doc Watson .... would be smilin' ... Nice stuff boys! Mr. Martin Bravo!
He is Soooo talented.  They sound great. Thanks for sharing this with us.
I feel like this music would fit perfectly in the Firefly universe
Love Steve Martin, and loved this NPR Tiny Desk Concert!!! Now when can I see this live??!
Dam Steve I had no idea
So much happening, I can barely catch up! The beautiful instruments, the mellow singing, the amazing audio engineering, perfect jokes, impressive musicians. Loved everything about it!
Lol after listen to this i want to marry my sister
His face seems unnaturally smooth. Did he got plastic surgery at some point?
Wow Steve is a natural👍👏🎶🎸 btw the whole group flows so well together. I love when people have more than one creative ability, keeps you out of other peoples business! 😆😁
Steve Martin lookin like Pappy O'danielYa dad blamed idjit
Surprenante découverte... Bravo Mister Martin!...
Dad music 100%
check it out \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI-cdgLl6Ek&t=2s
Um YEEEEEESSS
Steve martins gangsta as f#%*
很好
STEVE CAN SHRED!!!!!
True american bad ass
So cool
Polished as feck.
Gavin Volure
Huh... TIL
Sounds good.
FINALLY!!!!
refreshing
HE HATES THESE PHOTONS!
Dope
This is awesome
Right on!!!
OHHHHH that Steve Martin
Hm... I didn't know Jimmy Fallon was so mandolin savvy. Nice!
Steve's closeups just took my virginity, paid off my student loans, gave me roses and lavish gifts, took me on extravagant vacations, kissed my hand and asked me to marry them.
loved it
Steve Martin MF 😐
They remind me of my hipster neighbors. I call them 'Granola Crunch Hipsters'.
I didn't know I wanted this.
Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers are pretty snazzy
I am glad he finally did something with his life! 😉
Finally, a platform for this little known musician.
The third song was amazing!!
Can we get Dave Matthews on vocals to join in on a few songs?
Damn this is so cool!
This band is so amazing, they even have a turtle singing for them
No idea Steve was such an awesome musician. So pleasantly surprised!
Steve Martin, I started on a five-string banjo like yours, but I have changed to a 10-string banjo. Much better sound. Why don't you give it a try?
Didn't know Bruce Willis played the Banjo as well!
They are doing a meet and greet where I live...  but I'm gonna be camping in the Mississippi River delta
I need this video on loop for when I have a rough day.  It's just so great and it helps my mood tremendously.
Steve Martin is writing, playing, and singing his Ass off!
Steve Martin... the Van Halen of the banjo!
I so love Steve more for being a killer musician then just an OK comedian.
I love this!  Way to represent Asheville, SCR!
Dammit Steve!  Stop being so talented; you're making the rest of us look bad.
Another brilliant Tiny Desk! Loved it. Thank you.
Its amazing enough that the fiddle player didn't knock Steve's glasses off his head.
It's almost like he'd dedicated his life to the Banjo, and yet he has accomplished so much more than that.\n\nAwesome stuff.
steve be doing the most in this life
Man he's funny. DO some movies!!
I love it how famous actors like Steve Martin and John C Reilly have these secret talents for being bluegrass musicians. That artistic gene must manifest itself in all kinds of forms.
Thank you thank you thank you! This was pure delight.
Wish Steve Martin was also doing movies; it's been a while
This was awesome. I have loved Steve Martin for so long- an amazing multi talented human being. Would have loved to hear him sing a little more, but the other singer was fantastic as well.
What tuning is the banjo in?
That's super cool. Steve is really nice with it.
So that's where he's been
i'm an intermediate to advanced guitar player and i thought i could pick up banjo and it would feel natural but no.  Banjo is hard, at least if you learn guitar first, that high g string throws me off every time, but i still try once in a blue moon, i make it sound more like a shamisen or sitar  than bluegrass traditional banjo sounds
Lester & Earl would be proud of y'all.
Beautiful claw hammer style
Fucking awesome.. he looks sexier than ever.
That. Was. Fun.
SERIOUSLY CANT BELIEVE KING KRULE HASNT BEEN ON YET.
The shoes are truly cruel.
Nice.  I thought he dead because of a fake new of some months ago.  I am very happy to see them playing that beatiful music.
This man should get on a show with Hugh Laurie to mix their two blues styles
This reminded me of the film; A MIGHTY WIND! I loved this...I love folk music! It's beautiful...Relaxing and I could sing along! And I am a jazz vocalist!   This was perfect. Fun and so entertaining! Well done, Steve and Steep Canyon Rangers! Very well done!
I love seeing clawhammer banjo on tiny desk!!
I watched this with the stupidest smile on my face all the way through, Thank you!
I was born a poor black child..
I want him, Robert Crumb and Woody Allen to form a band now.
Been waiting for this way too long! Worth the wait.
Beginning of third song, was it meant to be a tribute to Glen Campbell's Southern Nights?
I thoroughly enjoyed this - thank you Steve.
Go to google and type: *gexxguides* You get the only real 100% Working clash of clans working method in 2017
NPR is normally state-propaganda, so this was refreshing!   I do love bluegrass.   \n\nThe lack of hill-melancholy and marcato give it away as city-playing; but refreshing nonetheless.   Thank you SCR band.
I just started a channel could you guys subscribe and view my video 😀
Is this is a Cringe Compilation?
Very shocked! They play so smooth!!!!

Alfie, can you please explain what happened to one of Zoe's guinea pigs :(
The second spear looks hurt
That made me happy
Bless you dad!!   I thought that was absolutely darling!!  \n0:08  When he made the sign of the cross ..........Awwwwww!!   Really made my day!!
Liberals think this is child abuse.... Your going to jail now!
No kids were hurt at the making of this video.
Good way to get the kids tired and off to bed early. RKO into a pillow, nighty night lol.
I hope WWE sees this and gives y’all free tickets or something!!!! 😊
I was waiting for your video, and it was AWESOME\n\nSee you next year =D
When u know cuteness trends on YouTube
Hey you know all those disclaimers in WWE that say Please, Do NOT Try This At Home? They'll be the reason you get to pay out of your own pocket for your child's medical care for the rest of his life once he is paralyzed from the neck down cause his dumbass dad thought it was cool to encourage him to imitate pro wrestling moves even to the extent of jumping off a ladder. Great parenting. Remember these videos when you try to sue WWE for your heartache and medical bills.
Some quality father and son bonding right there !
I wanna to see a Swanntom bomb off the ladder.
We had pile drivers in our day. Now we have pick up wheel chair basketball games on the weekends if anyone is interested.
When the kid was shaking his hands, priceless.
Cant believe there is no perfect parent comments about how this is abuse etc
That little boy looks so happy!! Ohh wait... that's the dad!
So, this is once a year..
Lmao this guys such a good dad
As a parent this really angers me you should be ashamed of yourself......... it's no way in the world I would've let him hit me with the leg drop from the latter I would've jumped up into a rko
508 people clearly don't have kids
G.O.A.T. video, end of story, get out.
A 20 second video #20 on trending🤦‍♀️
Nice mate you really cracked me up
See you next year guys!
When mom goes to the store
I knew he had it in him, the older guy had no chance.
This is gonna be my brother and his son 😂😂😂 OR EVEN DAUGHTER
When i was a kid ..I used to do this with my younger brother every day after dinner ....🤣🤣
Did... the kid hail mary before he jumped off the ladder??
Why is this called annoying? He looks like he's just having fun with his son
Admit it wrestling fan, you did wrestling some moves to your son more than once.
“I’ll set up the camera, son. You get the ladder”
Best part was that last slap one
Hopefully you monetized the video. Put the money in his college fun
To be continued: September, 2018
I'm calling child services.
haha this is so cute\ni like the hair flip at the beginning 😉
The kid in the thumbnail is about to get a football head.
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS AND BE THE CHURCH!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH SYSTEM AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!\n\n\nRevelation 18:4\n\n4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues\n\nHowever, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:\n\nProverbs 7....
I once did this with my dad and it was awesome until I punched him in the balls.
This is good parenting
This time plz don’t wait so long to make a new one

This is just perfect !
I'm a teacher. Many of my kids are dealing with trauma far beyond their years, and beyond their coping skills.\n\nThis video has already been so helpful to me personally. We talked about building a ladder in class today. I plan to continue talking about it.\n\nI don't comment much on YouTube, but please know that you've had an impact on at least one person across the globe.\n\nThanks for your honesty and introspection.
You are my hero !
Thank you Martina for posting the video and sharing how you deal with the bad days. And thank you Simon for being there for Martina and supporting her. I have lupus and went through a bad time many years ago when my entire body was retaining fluid. I can recount with some humor now the stories when I screamed when the x-ray tech didn't believe it hurt A LOT to raise my arms and would do it quickly or the moment when the machine to drain fluid from my lungs kicked in and I couldn't breathe for several seconds. One way I dealt with those times was to crochet a pill puppy and stuff it with the cottons from the meds I was taking. My health has improved somewhat, and the pill puppies remind me to stay positive and turn misfortune into art.
It's too bad you don't have access to medical marijuana, I don't know how I'd get through my hard pain day's without it. It's that bad, that I have to be on another planet. I've gotten to the point that the other narcotics have no real affect at normal safe doses. I really hope that helps, also I don't wear clothes at all on those days because they burn my skin, I avoid sunlight and stay in a cool room and ride it out. And of course, I binge on junk food like chocolate, ice cream, cake or whatever else makes me fuzzy in side, like shave ice, cereal, whatever! And usually that helps, it foes take the pain away, but it helps. And it always helps to know you're not alone!!! I hope you can get relief dear, take care.
Thank you. You are empowering. You are inspiring. Both of you.
George Michael is my happy music too for bad pain days. I have CRPS after an injury almost 2 years ago. I'm 22 and have a walking stick. I see specialists every week and had to stop doing what I love which is musical theatre. It's hard to explain to people what a bad pain day is. But you did it! Getting out of bed after a night of spasms, burning and stabbing pains, is so hard. Getting to university via train and bus with a walking stick is so hard. When the lift at uni is broken so I have to walk up 5 flights of stairs to get to my class. It's so bloody hard! So thank you for making me feel understood! Xxx
This was really helpful because my mom has fibromyalgia, which makes your nerves overly sensitive and muscles tighten and cramp. It's also one of those invisible diseases. Totally gonna show her. \nBtw her pain medicine is Gabapentin and it's been super helpful to helping her manage the pain so maybe you Martina can try
I hope you well be good next day,  dont give up girl.  Much moment dont you know,  keep smile and positif thinking
This is the same thing I do!! :) the small things matter. I try to make myself a breakfast and dress up nice and I do all I have to do, even if it is super hard.
Thanks for being so real with us! Needed to see this! It blessed me so much!
You are so cute with your pig hat and all :) I'm happy it makes you feel a bit better. I know how you feel going down those stairs that way.  Sometimes I don't want to bother, but your video about building a ladder really stayed with me :) Thank you for being so brave to film these videos :)
Love you Martina and Simon <3
Hey Martina. I found your channel like 3-4 yrs ago? And i admired your overpoweringly infectious positive attitude and wished i had just 5% of that energy and high spirits. I havnt been seeing your channel for maybe the past yr or more (before it was religiously) and as i came to see the couple episodes in the past yrs, this one struck me to write. As u know the difference of building ur ladder, im proud of u yet not suprised. Uve always been so strong minded, not letting urself powerless. So heres my advice, when you lay down, feeling like u need the rest or not feeling good, read self-help books and i highly recommend Presence by Amy Cuddy (can find on Amazon). It explains how to feel more powerful in a psychological viewpoint of rather simple ways with great results. Even explains how u can acheive it when you lay paralyzed. Its small nudges that will fortify in time. Im not a big book reader, but this book kept me engaged the whole time and i can see how it can help u when applied. Too detailed for me to explain shortly. Ill prah for you right now, Dear God, we thank you always for the many blessings u have given to Martina. I know your purpose is greater and will not be meaningless. I know ur making it very hard, but we know her reward is far greater than she knows. Not just for her benefit directly, but how it is affecting others positively. Which is what makes Martina happy too. Of course she would rather rid the pain for good, but one thing i can say is i thank u God for showing so many people Martinas strength and heart through the breakdown she goes through. U picked the strongest candidate to help more lives who couldnt do it. And i know u will give Martina more strength, wisdom, and influence to others, with a golden house for her in heaven. Amen.
Your advice is so amazing! 😊 I've been suffering since 2011 with chronic pain and I struggle everyday! Thank you for this video and reminding me to do all these wonderful things. Go outside. See the beauty in small things and be proud of small accomplishments. I just found you on YouTube and I'm happy I did!
Thank you for being vulnerable, honest and candid about your down day and showing how you build a ladder. Encouraged. ❤
Thank you. So much. For making this video...I haven’t had to deal with chronic pain for long, only the pass two years. But I haven’t worked for months and surgeries don’t help. And it’s hard because I’m alone majority of the time, so I was going to try and start a YouTube to keep me distracted 🙂 I don’t feel so alone now and your positivity is inspirational. I’m going to try and go for a walk this afternoon! You are an amazing human Martina!
So vulnerable to post this. I applaud you and respect you so much for posting this. Oh how much I want to hug you! Martina you're an awesome woman.
thank you for sharing this, thats honestly all I can say because this really touched me.
Get well Marina !!! We love u and care about you! From Guatemala :)
Martina, You are an inspiration to everyone out there who needs to know they are not alone. I admire your strength and positive attitude. I have been watching your videos for a few years now, and watching you and Simon grow as people and in your relationship has taught me so much more than you will know. You teach us how to love ourselves and that it's okay to get knocked down, but that we have to make sure to try to get back up. I suffer from depression and bipolar disorder and most days getting out of bed is a feat, just like it is to you. I have always looked to you and Simon for a smile or a laugh. So thank you for creating this beautiful video, and all the videos before it. Love you guys! Keep Going <3 #buildaladder
Oh, Martina. Xxx I love you so.
Thank you for this video. I suffer from very bad depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Besides work it is so hard for me to get out of the house and get moving. I work because I have to lay the bills but if I didn't do that I'm not sure what else I would do. This video has really encouraged me. Sometimes i just sit at home and cry feeling so very empty but if I can just #buildaladder then maybe I can go out and at least get some coffee and people watch. Thank you Martina.
Giiirl, thanks so much or making this beautiful video and being so honest. I'm glad that you let us be a part of your ladder and that you share your experiences with us! Love you!! <3
Love you Martina! You're such an amazing person.
Hey Martina! Thanks so much for this video. It had to be really tough to do. I also have EDS and klippel trenaunay syndrome( lovely combo, one leg is larger and heavier) with regular dislocation as well. I love your channel and it's definitely part of my ladder because it's like going on vacation with your cheeriest friends, even when you can't get out of bed. Studio Ghibli movies, creme au chocolate tiesta tea, and my pup help too. Last year, I found pandaplanner, which is a sweet little journal that you start your day by writing : what you are grateful for,excited about, positive self affirmation, etc. I also keep a 'crash bag' with snacks, sketch pads, and water in case I get stuck when I wake up. Giving back is fun too, so whenever I am down, I have cards that I send cards to senior homes addressed: whoever needs a smile. You're one brave tough gal!
Martina, thank you so incredibly much for this video! From such a dark place you still manage to radiate so much brightness! 💖
thank you so much for sharing this❤ hopefully I can follow these. you're amazing
I don't know the laws in Japan, but this lady at Buzzfeed had great results with medical marijuana: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=05jEknLDEoI . Move back to Canada when it's legalized soon! :)🇨🇦
Martina- you are so strong. You have found a way to somehow take one step at a time and build yourself a ladder throughout the day. I think it took great courage to make this video and expose yourself and I think it will make such difference to so many people suffering through chronic pain and/or depression. I'm lucky enough to say I'm healthy and have no major health issues but seeing you suffer like this is hard to watch. I just want to somehow solve your issue but obviously it's not that simple. It makes me grateful for my health, knowing that one day it could all change and I could lose it in the blink of an eye and be in your shoes. I'm so glad for you that you have such a supportive husband who helps you through your roughest days. May you have more good days than bad days.
I loved seeing this side it's always nice to know that we all have bad days. I think for me listening to music or playing the drums/guitar is what usually takes my mind off things. Keep strong Martina!  \nDon't let your mindset become what controls you -Beartooth
Thank you so much for this!
I love you martina!!! Youre so brave and courageous!
Watching your videos make me happy on my bad days and give me courage!! Thank you for making this. I and my daughter s have eds, well and mito and a few other things that go w the eds and mito. My point is.. I got you!!! I so have. Days like you...from the emotional to the happy enjoy anything I can to depression and tear s to the being too tired to feel anything....somedays are very lonely and feel like no one understands and so much isolation... please keep the video s coming. Bad days... My animals and funny animal videos and Pink...lol
Martina, you are an inspiration. I suffer from chronic pain from endometriosis, thank you.
Poor Martina I hope you get better but please get some rest and don't force yourself, thanks for sharing even in a bad day you look so bright. Lots of love 💕
Thanks for sharing this story with us, I needed this love you and Simon 💕
this video made me feel so strengthened thank you for being so raw and sharing. it definitely is a great source of encouragement for many out there including myself don't give up on building your ladder. :)
Thank you so much Martina for sharing. It helps so much, words can't even describe. I've watched you guys since early high school and through all the ups & downs in my life and you guys are just such incredible role models and you give me such inspiration when I need it most. Thank you guys. I love you all :3
From my very own Experience the only thing I can tell you is  that when you can't withstand against illness or pain or any hardship in this life, if you seek God with all your heart and despair believing even if you never believed before, he responds with real facts, not very much people can believe in this. but I can tell you, that when I lost everything, ( my job, my Family, my house, and all my dignity as human being  ) and I was totally abandoned with big health problems ( chronic heart arrhythmia and insomnia) I prayed to god and regret myself of all my old ways and ask him for Help and rescue, he answered me, 4 years ago, God gave me a new life with a wonderful wife and new family,  healed my body,  also he put me in the best job I ever had in my whole life and now I don't even remember those freakin' bad days where I suffered so much! And I'm still todat thanking him for all this wonderful new life through this message.  Martina, Simon, I've been seeking your videos since 2013 you're a wonderful couple and I wish you the best life you can get. Martina I will also pray to God for your health. but this is all I can tell you as an advice if you knock his door he will open it and he will heal you, just some faith can change all!  A big hug from Chile Thanks for entertaining me so much!!
This really empowered me, because I struggle with this as well. Chronic pain, constantly and today i had to leave school because i couldn't do it but when i got home. I tried to build that ladder to help me. Watching this helped so much, you guys are some of the most important people I watch, because even if i don't know you personally. Face to face. I feel like i know you. Like i can connect with you. And that is another rung to my ladder. Thank you guys so, so very much.
My first step on bad days is having a good morning snuggle with my kitty. She motivates me to get up and be productive. How else am I meant to support her? Lol
Seeing the beginning of this video made me so upset. I know how this feels, as I have sciatica from three slipped discs. Seeing you in pain when I think so highly of you was very hard. We’ve obviously never met, but you mean a lot to me, and to so many other people. I’ll use your tips in the future. Thank-you, Martina <3
I love your videos and I know what your going through and sometimes it's so hard to be positive when you feel like hell! Please don't give up on trying to find the positive things in your day to make you smile! I hope you start to feel better soon and have no more pain. ♡♡♡
Martina I love you so much and hate seeing you in pain. Thank you for sharing this with the world, that way we can understand the things you go through better and what we, as a community and friends, can help you with. Love you lots, both of you (and your furbabies)! Hugs from Sweden~ ❤️
This is the most important video you've ever made. We love you
I love you Martina! You are so strong not only for yourself but you have helped me stay strong for myself as well. I look up to you everyday and once I started watching you guys I can't stop now! Hugs and love your way!
Thank you for sharing and for the advice
I love you guys. I love how strong you guys are and always making people stronger not just from your happy go lucky videos( althrough I love those videos alot), videos like these is what makes me fall in love with you again. Probably the most impressvie thing is the video was Martina using her left hand to catch Pokemon, that takes some amazing skills :).\nAnyways one thing that would always make me feel better is to write, whether it was a horrible day or the best day ever I can just write all my feelings away. When I go back to read it, I can remember all the good and bad times and know that I have come such a long way. Again I love you guys so much and how everyday you guys make my day a little brighter. LOVE ya!!!
I love you, thank you so so much! Martina you really save me. Simon you are so amazing as well, I don't ever want you to forget how incredible you both are at being able to build that ladder together. Thank you and I love you both!
Thank you. I know that mental illness may not be comparable. But it's rough too. Thank you for being around to giving perspective.
Thank you so much for this video. When I'm in a depressive state, I normally don't move at all, listen to dark music (or even just lie in silence), and I keep myself cooped up in my head. I'll sometimes remain in bed for days (occasionally getting food and water and using the bathroom). However, after seeing you fight that urge, and learning about how you build your ladder, I feel better equipped to face those days.
Martina your awesome and thanks I was having a hard day
Oh my gosh. I don't even know how to start or what I could say to express what an amazing person I think you are Martina. 🙏🏼 This video made me feel the opposite of down! It humbled me and made me feel overwhelmed with the strength of the human spirit. Your spirit. ❤️ Your strength, your light,.. it's truly inspiring. You need to write a book. 🤓And Simon and you are the true definition of soulmates. 💖👫Your love for each other is beautiful and perfect. Sending you a virtual hug and hope that you find comfort soon in days ahead. 😘
I love you and your strength to be positive every day! Keep it up Martina <3
Martina, thank you for sharing this. As a fellow EDS-er attempting college, thank you.
I can't relate to anything you've been through, but I've had some knee pain going on for a little over year. It's started last year after I banged it really hard on some rocks when I went caving and white water rafting; caving was on a Tuesday and rafting was on a Thursday. I went to the doctor and she thought I tore my meniscus. Went to sleep away camp, and messed it up by climbing a really steep hill like 5 times that week. Went again and she thought I had a bruise underneath my kneecap. \n\nFast forward a few months, I started to play soccer and running on an already messed up knee doesn't mix. \n\nFast forward to July of this year, I started to notice my knee hurting, but it wasn't too bad. Just like a small muscle spasm here and there. 2 weeks later, I notice on how bad my knee started to hurt. I was at sleep away camp for that week, mid July, and the following week so I couldn't really do much. At this camp, we walk everywhere and it's in the mountains of VA. The camp has a few golf carts to transport things for point a to point b and some people if they're hurt for some context. \n\nBy the end of the first week of the two weeks at camp (last week in July to first week in August), I was in so much pain. I had the knee pain and for some odd reason, I have this weird rib pain where it feels like someone is stabbing me in the ribs. The following week, I went rock climbing and that was a big mistake. I went all day, until about half past 2 pm and I went to a camp site. Later that night, I twisted my right ankle and I think it's still messed up to this day… \n\nFast forward to last night where I was in so much knee pain. I was so close to becoming insane from the pain in my knee, but my best friend kept my composure and made sure I didn't go insane. She did the same thing tonight and fun fact, we call each other love cause we both love each other so much. (Yes we're friends, no we aren't dating) \n\nI totally agree with what you said Martina about pain altering your mind. I was so f**king miserable last night and tonight from my knee killing me. Anyway, my rant about my annoying life is done. \n\n(Shameless self promo, if you love inspirational quotes, follow me on Instagram! @natalie_b_photography\nI post around every day, usually with a quote)
I have lupus that has caused fibromyalgia & chronic migraines (& other not so fun things). You are such an inspiration to me. seeing you push through helps remind me that I can too. I really try to apply some of the great advice you give us one getting through our bad day. Thank you for making videos like this being so open about your struggles, it brings attention to something so important.  \n I was able to get an ESA that has greatly helped my depression caused by not being able to do things most people my age can. Having her with me on my bad days has also just helped me so much to think about something other than the pain.
Thank you Martina. I'll try this. :)
Thank you for making this video. You are such an inspiration! I love you guys so much
Martina, you give people so much hope.
I don't have the same problem as you but I've had chronic pain since I was in 7th grade and I've always missed a lot of school because I too stay home when I have really hard days. But I really love this ladder thing and i want to try it because I hate missing out on life because I'm always stuck at home. So thank you for making this because it's actually inspirational.
When I sit at lunch, that’s when my depression hits the hardest. I don’t know what to do
Have you tried medical marijuana?   I saw Kelsey from Buzzfeed that she suffer chronic pain.
I love you two so much 💕 thank you for everything
I'm a 15 year old athlete and I have chronic joint pain. No one knows why. I'm also very accident prone and have had many broken bones and surgeries from hiking accidents and acciedents from the horses I work with, I get suuuper down on the days when its cold and my joint pain gets 10 times worse and when I have to sit in bed and can't walk because of bad knees. You have no idea how cool it was to see this video and how open you were just to help others. Love you both, Jessi 💝
When I'm having a bad depression/anxiety day, I like to watch funny things. The English dub of Ghost Stories and DBZ Abridged are my top ones. I also like to bake, so my house always has some sort of snack that's homemade.
Not even a minute in and I'm already bawling :( love how sweet and understanding Simon is
Thank you for sharing this Martina. I know this is a difficult thing to show, but it's so important to see what it takes to be positive. You're such a strong role model for everyone. <3
I love this fan base. Thank you everyone for being good humans.
If video like this Help you to fell better do it ❤️ i didnt know about this pain so its great to talk about,  may the force be with you  😉
I feel you so hard right now. Whenever I am feeling down or in pain (which is a lot of the time, I have been I a wheelchair my whole life), I do my makeup put fun jewelry on, dye my hair a fun color just to pick myself up! And most of the time the pain meds I take only take the pain away just a little bit, just so it is not the first thing on my mind when I move. I miss the days, the ones when you first wake up nothing hurts you just get up and move around not having to worry.
Im proud of you!
You are right about music, Martina. Since my arrival in this society, i always felt scared and depressed about things around me (and it's not getting better). But, music has always helped me get through my day, no matter what style it is. K-Pop, metal, country, etc. I like to know that they are people that are not afraid to take chances and share their passion with other people. That is why music will never die and I will survive.\n\nThank you Martina for sharing this video with others. You are a true inspiration :)
Have you tried cannabis love ?
I love you both. Martina, you're a real knight in shining armor!
You guys are so awesome. Thank you for this video, really.
One minute in .. and my heart strings are tugged .. but thank-you for this video .. need to build myself a ladder
Smelly therapy dogs are the best ever.
This is heartbreaking. I don't know how I'd mentally handle it because I have pretty much no one in my life or by my side.
Thank you for posting this. I love you Martina(simon too!) !! I have chronic back and knee problems. I definitely know that feeling when I just want to stay home because the pain is too much. \n\nMaybe you can put cute patches or have someone embroider on your beige sling.
This also makes me think about how what Martina is suffering limits how many types of jobs she can do. I honestly feel that today's working environments aren't very accommodating for people's individual physiques and physical limitations. I imagine that having a good job is a great and very welcome distraction for this sort of pain. Just keeping busy with something productive can be great.\n\nOn the the plus side, if it wasn't for this and Martina did have more work options then Martina may not have been quite as compelled to become this youtube superstar in the most awesome youtube superstar couple of today. And that's saying a lot because there's a lot of amazing youtube couples out there.\n\nWeather is something else to take into consideration for a person's mental well-being. My neighbour drives trains for the ttc and he said that the deeper in winter it gets the more people who will commit suicide. In the dead of winter when nobody would dare go outside I force myself to put on many many layers and get out of the house because cabin fever sucks and I know it will cheer me up. A lady once thought I was homeless and refused to believe that I'm not homeless because I was out for a walk in the middle of winter.\n\nSo yeah, what I do is just get out of the house, even when the weather doesn't want me to. My wife used to think I'm nuts for going out smack in the middle of winter, but then she'd thank me for forcing her to get out of the house with me. Going to places that have more of an outdoors and social lifestyle. Finding ways to do the sort of work I really enjoy doing as a way to make a living. I've met so many people in my life who are unhappy just because of their work.\n\nSharing your bad days isn't what's important. What's important is you sharing how you deal with bad days.
My ladder has been a very difficult process. I also have EDS, along several other disabilities. On top of this, I have severe depression, GAD, OCD, and PTSD. The worst of all of that, comes from rape PTSD. It's taken moving out of the area that my abuser lives in, burning the bed in happened in, among other things, to feel like I can get out of bed in the morning, without panicking all day that he'll come for me(justice system did nothing about what happened). Now I'm having to go back to that area, to finalize the move stuff(pack what's left, hire movers), and my anxiety and panic feel like they've never been higher. I'm on my way down there as I type this, and I am horrified. The logic and panic sides of my brain are odds with each other, and I'm having a very hard time finding those first rungs. I'm trying, I'm doing my best. But all the panic, anxiety, stress; It's all making my physical stuff way worse, and I can't sleep well because of nightmares. I wake up sick and in severe pain, and I go to bed, sick, and in severe pain. So I am focusing on making the those rungs, be the ladder that gets me back home, and far away from him.
Martina, you are an AMAZING human being. And so is Simon!!
Even if you don't feel it, you are so strong. Whenever I'm not feeling right (more mentally than phisically) I try to over rationalize things (that is not a permanent state, that it's not really as bad as I'm feeling it...) and that helps me..\nBut right now... I JUST WANT AND NEED AN AWESOME HAT FOR SHITTY DAYS!\nBIG KISSES for you both ;*
I started this video with sad tears and ended it with happy tears. Keep building your ladders everyone. Thank you Martina for motivating me and many others to continue building and climbing. It's nice knowing I'm not alone and that even when I feel my worst, I can still manage to feel better even if it's just a little bit. :-)
Martina, it's so courageous and amazing for you to guide us how you got over your bad day. I'm crying T~T\nI'm actually thankful that you made this video, because it has definitely hit home for me and will help me to get through my bad days. \nSeeing you go through this day, how your spirit lifted slowly as you built your ladder, is really inspiring. I commend you for your strength in spite of the pain. Sending much love to you both, Simon and Martina.
Thank you, Martina - you're amazing. Thank you for the tips in this video, although I can't begin to imagine the kind of physical pain you're in, this really helped with my depression. Hugs and kisses to you both and thank you of being so strong xxx
Thank you for making this. I'm sure it's helped a lot of people.
When I first found out of Martina's condition, I was devastated for her. \n\nA year or so ago, I was diagnosed with Hypothryoidism.\nI knew what she was going through was bad but I never thought I would suffer from my own chronic illness soon after.\n\nNot only do I support you, but I greatly look up to you now.\nYou put such a bright smile and outlook on life even when suffering.\n\nAlthough our illness are vastly different, I look up to you and how you can stay so strong.\n\nYou are a role model to me more now than ever.\n\nThanks Martina.\nFor keeping my spirits high.\n\n#BuildALadder\n\nP.S.\nSimon, you are a great person. It's hard to find people that put full support to people who are suffering chronic illnesses. You are blessing.
I was actually recommended to this channel from someone because I also suffer from EDS. I can't thank you enough for posting this. Most of my days are spent in bed writhing in pain and generally most people don't understand or have questioned if there's actually something wrong with me because I look fine, it was when I got a walking stick people started to ask me what happened and I actually have been called a cripple from others, which really made me ashamed of myself. It really means a lot to see youtubers and other people posting about how bad it is, thank you for making myself and other people with EDS and other chronic pains validated. I might try get a special hat for bad days too haha
Martina, I also have EDS and this video is so inspirational. I often get stuck in bed, my legs are usually my big issue but as I’m getting older my shoulders are slipping out more and more too. I hate using my cane and my braces so much but I know they are good for me, I think I’m gonna start decorating them with sailor moon stuff too! I work in Disney World with the characters so I’m really lucky that when I’m having bad day I get Baymax cuddles to help me! Thank you so much for making this video!

THANK YOU
is the cause of your pain from some sort of inflammation? If so maybe you can implement anti-inflammtory remedies. \n\nTake curcumin, matcha, ubiquinol, flaxseed supplements and omega 3 rich foods. Drink apple cider vinegar/lemon water with straw. Also take all types of collagen supplements (type 1,2,3).\n\nAnd try to avoid consuming in inflammotry foods like refined vegetable oil (not coconut/avocado oil), alcohol, caffeine, high glycemic foods (refined carbs/sugar).\n\nEven though inflammation may not be the source of your pain, I believe above remedies can still help you feel better. Hope you feel better.
The new world order is corporate oligarchy.
You forgot CATS on your list.
These are some of the LARGEST corporations in the world but if your looking for the most powerful companies Monsanto and Goldman Sachs should definitely be included.
I'll say China itself. Of course China is a country but it is a communist state so everything they make and earn is then put under their own name like it became their product. And they gave out loans and make many exports for other countries. For that I see China is one giant nation that is becoming one giant super corporation.
Where did you get those employment numbers? According to wikipedia Microsoft employs almost 100,000 more than that.
I love that game!
What is with the sponsored content?
why put the Mazda rx8 as representation for tyota?
Didn't know cats had this many moneys!
But when you look at apple's actual market share, they ain't shit
Happy to see channel growing... \n😊😊😊😊
The car you used to represent Toyota is actually a mazda
Where's the rothchilds?
Democracy really needs better ways of managing monopolies or even removing them.
What about the Oil companies? They are huge.
Why Did You Mis Out Australia
As someone from Birmingham, THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN ENGLAND, it is worrying to take your sources as fact as you miss that fact out. In the UK its London, Birmingham and THEN Manchester. Either update on that mistake or find another way to fix your mistake before i can take you serious.
What business in the world has always been tax exempt, people not only buy what they sell but donate regularly to them, have their own donated Royal Security Force, and have their own country/domain.\nIts so big they don't have a number for value and don't want you to talk about it, of course\nthe catholic church. Even if prostitution was always managed through 1 company that company would be tiny in comparison.
damn it, now I want a Big Mac
I have cats good game
The United Kingdom's second city is Birmingham not Manchester
I wouldn't trust volkswagen though
Curious why they don't have a Walmart near San Francisco.
Wouldn't Exxon Mobil be up there?
CATS is pay to win, there saved ya all the trouble.
Walmart's value is half is revenue?
Bankers man, these tech companies are nothing comparing to the bankers.
The most powerful company is probably Amazon
Nokia, obviously.
Cats definitely rule
TATA ??
Dude look up Serco, they may be the biggest company you’ve never heard of
bad/ new world order donald trump bill gates
What city has less than a million people?
Why did you remove your latest video?
These corporations kind of scare me nowadays because they have so much power and it can corrupt people so much. There’s a reason that in America’s history they had corporations that had to get broken up namly the gas companys from the early 1900s. There’s a reason our economy doesn’t allow for monopolies and because these companies are worldwide with reaching they can cause even more damage and should be broken up as well. There’s something to be said about smaller companies with less reach and more competition
Trump and the ultra rich will benefit most from his tax cut.   You need to watch the filthy rich on CNBC .  These folks have elevators for their Ferraris,  they will be getting the bulk of the tax cut.  Also ask yourself why some of the richest neighborhoods are around Washington DC.   Also need to watch A GOOD AMERICAN on Netflix and see where your money is going, follow the money.
But the English East India Company
Godammnit! He pronounced Milo wrong, it's Mai-Low not Mee-lou, son of a bitch...
Lol, I was literally playing CATS before I watched this
And you didn't mention Alibaba which had revenues of $550 billion in 2016 . . . more than the combined revenues of Walmart and ebay combined.\nThe largest corporation in the world is ICBC, the largest Chinese bank, with assets of more than $3.6 *trillion* and it is larger than the GDP of India.
Can you do the same with banks?
Can you make a N.Korean VS US 2.0
for the record milo is pronouced my lo
Walmart isn‘t so powerfull. If you say no chinese companys because they are only known in china, i would say walmart is only in the usa active. Even Aldi is in more countries.
I bet EA is in this. Oh and also Tencent.
Thanks for the 'CATS' ad...💚
Not many people know it, but Kraft is an empire.
Wallmart is not the largest employer in the world !
Why was there a Toyota logo on a Mazda RX8...?
Bill gates is no longer the richest man in the world its Jeff Bezos
Samsung gotta be bigger. They make appliances, apples CPUs and screens, their own phones, tablets, tvs, computers, laptops, headphones, they own a bunch of shit too
The East India Company had its own Army, Navy and controlled a large part of India. That's pretty scary!
I think it would have been good to name at lease like one Chinese company like Alibaba so People learn something completely new to them
Last I knew Lipton Teas were a product of PepsiCo not Unilever
Where's indian corporation?
I live where uni was made
Now T.I.S has caught the corolla virus xd
Source on Microsoft employees? I visited there and was told by employees that 105K employees exist in just Redmond WA
this is a great video subscribing but hey i bet amazon take the leading spot over walmart i can tell
Gotta love how many/most of your sources are Wikipedia XD\nMost reliable source of 2017
I've never seen McDonald's employees that happy
Yeah, we all know Disney rules the world.
Should have thrown in Trump and Tesla for comparison.
I don't have a Facebook, or a twitter.
That CATS ad in the beginning made me not want to watch the video anymore. Thumbs down
I cringe when you pronounce Porsche wrong
A top ten list on special forces or counter terrorisom units
expose kelloggs and you'll show up missing lmao
APPLE ES EL ROBO MAS GRANDE DE LA HISTORIA PARA EL CONSUMIDOR.
RLL Confirm Toyota Corolla
Nestles Milo is pronounced My-low not Me-low
I hate Facebook.
Bad for society
AT&T?
Yawn, obscene numbers and more numbers. Boring
Valve.
Most powerful corporation? Evil Corp.
Did you just say .... Meeelo?😂😂
RealLifeLore probably owns some 2 million Corollas alone.
What about Monsanto?
Eh North Korea
Whenever I think of facebook users, I think of mindless zombies.
Warren Buffet
Value v.s. market value/price.
make a vedio bangldesh vs myanmar
and mobil exxon?
ur voice annoying
EU vs Brics
ExxonMobil
Facebook dose not rule my day.
Walmart’s revenue is scary
Wow a Toyota RX-8
DISNEYYY

FB ad? Much?
Facebook is dead...
Apple is getting horrible
Notice how most of them are American...

You work hard and draw a lot of people to you so dont ever feel like you dont belong...you have definitely earned it! \nGuys, I honestly dont think Lydia meant to shame her by talking about her big feet..she was just teasing playfully..we big feet girls can get insecure about our feet but we have to own it and move on!

18:50 @ patricia's face. im dying. shaaadddyyy
Truly amazing your videos are inspirational
My Fav body butters are strawberry and shea
Love Home sense!
I disliked and haven’t subscribed because you live in denial. Makeup is to complement not make you look like someone else. If you took a pic of your real face for your passport and then walked around with your changed face that you call doing makeup and police stopped you and you showed your passport as ID you would get arrested. So how is that ok? The sooner you accept your not pretty the sooner you can deal to live with that face and appreciate yourself better instead of fooling yourself and others what you look like. I like women who use makeup but seriously. Women like you wind me up.
Wow!  Best reporting on this issue I have ever seen.  And that is really sad. :(  \nI mean you did a great job.  But you are a comedy show, real news outlets should be doing this stuff.
Watch Vee's video he made on this vid.
This is so much nonsense. Important to remember who started this violence: Antifa back at the February Milo event in Berkeley.
So because one group wanted a fight, it was okay to fight them. Also it's just as easy to say the right wing group may be armed because antifa keeps showing up and attacking them...
This trash just reminds me why I unsubscribed a while ago. lmao
I never expected the best journalism to come from Cracked.
Holy crap this is on point, this needs to be shared on every platform
So the Berkeley protests was Antifa being provoked to smash windows and destroy school property and attack anyone (not just Nazis and white Supremes but ANYONE) that even slightly disagreed with them? \n\n This is bullshit. \nThe driver that ran those people over in Charlottesville got arrested and charged with murder.\n\n I listen to the news everyday. Antifa's names is almost never mentioned, the only time they are is when they are made to be the good guys or victims. Everytime its white supremes or nazis that start the violence.\n\nYeah, white Supremes and Nazis are bad but that does not make Antifa good guys. Nor is it okay down play what they do by saying the Nazis started it, Cracked.
I wonder if white supremacists were actually dressed as ANTIFA people (their faces not seen) in that incident of vandalism? That kind of tactic is not unheard of.
Been watching u for a while, this isnt funny, its some of the best jornalism in the states
To be honest both groups are compete and utter scum. Fuck the Neo Nazis and Fuck Antifa. Both groups show just how far humanity can fall. We need more people to be able to just meet in the middle on shit.
There's a video by ContraPoints that deals with the subject of whether violence has to be the answer to some alt right happenings (specifically that dude who punch the nazi that time) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEyL1rDe60w
This was both funny and very informative. Thank you for posting.
If you wear a mask or bring weapons to a protest rally, you are a bad person. Period. \nThat said, the Alt-right is a bigger problem.
I'll save you 23 minutes of your life you won't get back watching this love-letter of apologist drivel for domestic terrorism, here's the abbreviated version:\n\nCody thinks that Antifa's domestic terrorism and violence is ok because other hate groups commit violence too...
Both sides are violent HATE GROUPS AND USE FASCIST TACTICS
Fuck this country. Honestly im sick and tired of pretending this country is so great with nazis walking about inciting genocidal terrorism
Cracked: Antifa is not as bad BECAUSE!\nAntifa apologism...geez, Cracked, how far you've fallen.\n\nSeriously, this the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  One side wants to be violent to people based on class, the other wants to be violent to people based on race.  How the fuck is one better?  You think the people inside the building that the Milo protesters set on fire heaved a sigh of relief upon learning that Antifa wasn't doing it for racial reasons?  They're both two sides of the same collectivist coin.  Actually, if your metric relies solely on racializing then, yes, Antifa are racists too, just toward a different group because they do explicitly advance this notion that only one race is truly evil, only one race is responsible for all the world's ills, and that the world will be a better place once _those people_ don't exist as majorities anywhere.  100 million dead from Communism, but, hey, they're not Nazis so special treatment is in order.  Certain types of hatreds and violence are less bad.  This idiot is even citing the damned Southern Poverty Law Center to make his point.  That should tell you what point he wants to make.  Even when there are no counter-protesters or white nationalists to be found Antifa still manages to show up, beat people, and destroy property, but for some mental gymnastic reason it's less immoral than Alt-Right violence.  Why?  Because someone was killed by the other side in Charlotesville?  It's not by design that Antifa hasn't killed anyone yet but by luck, so Cracked is only slightly uncool with Antifa throwing bricks and explosives into crowds of their opponent, with them spitting heads open with blunt objects, or with them setting fires and trying to stifle free speech, but they're not as bad because...reasons...fuck you, Cracked.
How can anyone possibly walk through life with the impression that the KKK and Neo-Nazis are anything but reviled? If you could produce even ONE person who would be even the SLIGHTEST bit surprised to find that everyone else finds these groups sickening, then I will eat a car and set my face on fire. The idea that these hate groups are just given a pass or whatever is fucking absurd.
oh wow, american media sucks at their jobbs, well nothing new. Still does not change the fact that antifa are fascists. Causes stopping people from expresing their views, with violence, is fascism. True the ones they were going against were fascists/racists/biggots/generalskum, but still does not change the fact that Antifa uses terror attacks to try and stop people who voices views they are not okay with. This includes people who just thinks that they should stop burning their car, or people that are just trying to talk about the issues that are around. But hey, they are totaly not terrorists. (hamburg anyone?) Now sure America is a fuck bucket, still Antifa is just another problem, sure one thats 1 step away from the IRA.\nBut to be honest if you ask me, let people have their protests, and ignore them. If they break the law, well arrest them, if not ignore them. If people don't even pay attention to a cause, that cause dies there.
Everyone should watch this show
On unrelated note how has everyone here say antifa I've been saying it as anti-fa some people say ant-e-fa is there a proper way of saying it.
I would appreciate it if you put links to the quote you use. Other then that, perfect.
Dammnnn every year we lose more reasons to want to live in America
The part at the end about the Jean Paul Sarte was great
'How To Actually Cover Stories About Antifa', has nothing to say about antifa.\nThey're scum, why not actually cover their beliefs and ideologies? Afraid to? Perhaps because a peek into their scary, violent, cultish anarco-communism might just make them look no different to 'tiki-torch waving white nationalists. \nYou're nothing but an aplogist for brainless thugs.
Both the far right and the far left are dumb
This is pretty much a public service announcement.
B  L  A  C    B  L  O  C  K
I for one think they're both a bunch of extremists idiots.\n\nBut yes, the media needs to be more balanced in it's coverage of these protests.
When Cracked provide better analysis on the state of the union, you have to wonder where the fuck the world has gone.\n\nI'll be on TheOnion getting objective news now.
From the outside, it just looks like two groups of losers that hate each other getting into fights in the street because they can't figure out better uses for their time. I don't really watch the news because they spend too much time covering stupid shit like this.
4:53 those weren't  far right assholes getting their due from Antifa. They were just there at the protest and Antifa starting provoking and attacking them because they thought they were. Antifa beat them for how the look!! Nothing else matters. Yeah skinheads and neo-Nazis are shitheads but Antifa is just as violent if not more so.
WOW. Actually defending the sick violence of the pussys in antifa? Cody and Cracked can eat a dick....stick to the funny not the politics shitheads.
Hey, Cody-o! I just wanted to tell you that I watched the video and it's still right! :) (Not trolling). Keep this up. Cheers!
I used to like Cracked. But these news videos are ridiculous.
I watch every single Some News with my teenaged daughter, we use them for discussion about current events. The videos are helpful and informative and I find them to be very balanced and educational. Thank you, to everyone on the Cracked team for putting out such informative and educational work. We really appreciated the quotes from Jean-Paul Sartre this week it was interesting to hear his work put into context of a real world situation. Thank you again, great job Cracked.
Too bad the alt-right trolls won't even watch and are too stupid to understand how they're being manipulated.
Not surprised. You go after how people cover the left but when it comes to scrutinizing the left on how they cover the right...oops ERROR! data can't be found! Please try again..
This video still has less views than Steven Crowder's undercover video of antifa https://youtu.be/fFvH1Njg2rM. Funny considering this channel has more subscribers. The people have spoken with their views, and Cracked is losing.
Well, at least he says right at the beginning he's a special news person.  So at least now we know he just got to use the recreational computer at the mental institution.
Strange world, people are more angry at people who fight neo nazis than the neo nazis themselves! Maybe so many people are hiddenly racists.
Donald Trump thanks you for your campaign donation for 2024
I like how his defense of Antifa is that the Left is stupid and easily manipulated to violence. He's blaming Antifa's violence solely on the victims of Antifa's violence, who are also perpetrators of violence. The difference is that Antifa is the group that keeps escalating, especially in Berkeley. Milo showed up armed with words, Antifa showed up as a masked violent mob. Over the next few weeks, Antifa continually escalated the violence. The Alt-Right started brawling back at the next protest, so Antifa arms itself with clubs (and a bike lock), and the Alt-Right responds with shields and clubs of their own so Antifa starts with M80s and Improvised Incendiary and/or Chemical devices in the form of Molotovs and homemade smoke bombs. And at the last protest (the People's Prayer), there were maybe 50 Alt-Righters there and literally thousands of protestors from the Left, and most of them that I personally witnessed were armed to the teeth with shields, clubs, glass bottles and various other improvised weapons and some (a couple of hundred out of the thousands there) were attacking people indiscriminately. The two people being attacked by Antifa at around 3:30 in the video above were actually anti-Trump demonstrators that Antifa assumed were Trump supporters because Trump appeared on the kids shirt. but if you really look closely, It's a picture of Trump wearing the uniform of the Fuehrer of the Third Reich, making the statement that Trump is literally Hitler. I consider myself to be a pretty liberal person, firmly on the left side of the political spectrum. I'm multi-racial, trans, and a Bay Area resident. I'm also tired of seeing a town that I spend a significant amount of time in be held hostage by domestic terrorists wearing black masks.
It's clear you want a race war, but how do you think that will REALLY turn out? Please, keep it up. I'll be fine.
5:00 that was a mid-fight video.. narrative here is untrustworthy if he can seem so sure with an obvious lacking of knowledge on the variable details.
I hope you all know that they are officially classed as a terrorist group now finally :)
How dare you attack attackers that for famous for attacking attackers. This is clearly an attack on peoples' right to attack attacking attackers.
ANTIFA = Everyone that fought against Nazis in WWII.
Neo Nazis are assholes \nAntifa are assholes \nAny identitarian group can generally safely be accused of being divisive and bad for everyone. \nAlso what the fuck does being pro-western have anything to do with supporting nazis? The west beat the nazis.
this is why I don't believe in freedom of speech or better said freedom of press anymore; I mean the press should be responsible the reason we have freedom of press in the first place is to inform the public of their public servants' action and hold them accountable not so that they can normalize discord.
You know what I don't get, everyone's like yay Nazi punching. So great! We should all punch Nazis. But those Nazi punching Antifa people go to far when they punch Nazis.
If you say things that offend people they attack you, just ask muslims talking about Salafism in the ME where the drones keep trying to blow them to bits. Killing people because you're scared of what they say is the American way.
Every argument used here also covers how anti-Israel media cover that conflict. Israeli action is always categorised as violent, aggressive or disproportionate, while instigating incidences by Palestinians are buried or completely ignored. Palestinians are framed as victims even while their leadership incentivises perpetrators of deadly attacks with life-long cash payments for their families.
Nazis are hateful morons.  Antifa are well-intentioned morons.  Nazis are far worse but also far easier to identify and ridicule.  Their words, as demonstrated, are ludicrous.  Antifa are incidious in that their intentions and words are relatively commendable but their tactics are deplorable and their proclivity to shout down opposition views is, at best, narrow-minded and oppressive. There is no moral equivalence between Nazis and Antifa but there is a stupidity equivalence.
I agree with much of the video, but often antifa (and other left winged protestor) often claim that someone is a nazi (or any other kind of biggot) when that person isn't
Thank you Cody & Cracked team. Hoping this goes big! It's great to see the research put in front of us so cleanly and you've got a tone right for the age.  You're doing a hell of a service for us all.  Then I hope you quickly don't have to do it anymore, because, this is exhausting.  :)
Sad when Cracked does more research than supposed legitimate news outlets.  On another note, I laugh my ass off every time you sneak a Join the conversation Pepsi reference into these videos.  Good stuff!
While on your way home you are stopped by a mugger holding a knife, threatening to hurt you with it. You (probably stupidly) struggle with the mugger and by some weird miracle (all those karate classes paid off) you get the knife away from the mugger, and then use it to threaten them to leave you alone or detain them while someone calls the cops. Did you *become* a mugger for using the same tool (the knife and its threat) as the mugger? No. Using violence against fascism and racism makes you equivalent to ... i dont know, whatever the 101st Airborne dropping into Normandy were.
Antifa are a violent rebranded anarchist group, who advocate mob rule over the law of the land.
The alt-right getting the media to characterize Antifa as terrorists is the consequence of Antifa using violence in the first place. Antifa basically blindsided the Trump supporters at the Milo protest early in the year. It wasn't until after that that they started gearing up to fight Antifa and began baiting them. This just goes to show what I tried arguing back then. Violence is just a bad strategy because it can be manipulated into backfiring just as it is now. Yet back then people insisted to me endlessly that it'd work.
Thank you for still having the ability to make me laugh with jokes about Pepsi in the middle of the shit storm that is America in 2017
Please watch The Antifascists, very good documentary. Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd4Wd56q6Ag
I can’t believe how many people liked this video. Is there something in the water?
I always wondered how these shits advertise and pull in support. Now I know. Use hate speech and violence to incite minorities to attack you then cry like piss babies that the minorities are all out of control and violent and exterminating them is the only way to keep ourselves and our families safe. People already soft on racism (Trump voters) see images of peaceful white protestors getting mobbed by minorities and start thinking maybe the nazis have a point.
There is nothing wrong with anti-fa. If some members of an anti-fa protest behave badly that doesn't condemn all of the anti-fa protesters. Anti-fascism is completely justifiable and so are their protests.
Greetings from Germany (yes, that Germany). So, you have Nazi scum over there? Here's a thought: Let them win, let them murder millions (again) and then lose (again), because that's what they ultimately always do. They devour themselves because there is always some sub-group deserving of their hate and like the insatiable morons they are, they will be their own Nemesis in the end. Sad, though, that millions will die in the process. #Sad #Raiseyourslightlysmallerthanaveragehands
I find it pretty funny how the only time a relatively neutral piece on Antifa is published it immediately makes it onto the trending page.
Kudos to Jack Jackson who actually watched, listened, thought.
The last of them where born in the 1930s to see a real one jump in the time machine to stop evil all you need is to not look away and stand up for what is right
Can't wait for the Cracked article about how Cracked's snarky liberal views help get Trump re-elected.
Why does everyone try and take sides just because they are labelled as slightly more your political opinion. The far left is full of hate and violence. The far right is full of hate and violence.  Neither can morally be defended and both should be ignored into oblivion. All these videos do is provoke hate and enlarge both their groups and make them more devoted.\n\nIt's why Trump won. He appealed slightly to some people but they were undecided because of his other hateful policies. Then you called all of them racist and evil and made it personal, so they had to defend themselves and take a side and you fully converted them. Hate breeds hate.
How not to cover stories about Antifa and further division by using the most unreliable sources imaginable. Some News.
Thank you for this video.
Here’s a headline “Cracked endorses domestic terrorist organization known as ANTIFA”
The closing message literally made me lol.
Its fun when the most ballanced newstories comes from humor sites like cracked and the comedy central.
Let me get your comment straight: ANTIFA is ALWAYS violent. It´s what they set out to do, its what they like to do, it´s what they think is a good thing to do. And THATS why they are RIGHTFULLY labeled as a terrorist group, because they are RADICAL COMMUNISTS in a DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.... let´s see if you can find out how that doesn't fit, idiot!
Hit me with Some News about fucking yesterday what the hell. A shooter or lone wolf or whatever killed a bunch of people in Vegas. Yay fun he had... 17? no thats too many... 17?!?!?! wow yea 17 guns smuggled into a hotel room nice. Now people are dead somehow. Great. God its so fucking sad
antifa are just as bad as nazis, they're both extremist groups on each end of the spectrum. both burn houses down, both fight and kill eachother, both hurt and violate people, while antifa gets funded by the government because being left is cool, no matter how illegal your actions are. anyway it's a hot topic
AntiFa fit the definition of Terrorists. They mean to affect political change through violent action. You know, TERRORISM.
Cracked is leftist bullshit
River particular chop aklll weigh next laugh gray speaker news.
**subscribes**
Brilliant, incisive and fucking infuriating.
You failed.
Good shit.
Dude, you are killing it lately.
So, so good. Thank you.
You mispronounced Sartre. Disliked.
You... Are... Retarded.. Provocation does not give validation to an act of violence more when that provocation comes in the form of free speech. Your stupidity makes me want to erase this content from YouTube still that does not mean I am entitled to it.
Excellent and essential.
wtf are you on?
Cracked is fucking cancer. Antifa are terroristic.
Antifa cuck lover
The take away here is that protesting is getting more and more violent and crazy.  The powers that be are going to take away peoples right to protest and this is a very bad thing for us as a whole.  And I am not talking about the white supremacists ability to protest, but rather protestors that deserve to protest like the people who protested against the white supremacists and like several years ago the anti wall street protests.  Protesting is a necessary right, and these hate groups are going to ruin it for us.  argh
I got all of 5 Seconds in and I had to stop because I was dying laughing who the f*** do you think you are seriously do you think because it's not the right doing any of the identity politics that is solely a construction of the left in order to be a Democrat or anybody left of a republican for the most part not including Libertarians you need to be quasi queer black Asian American with 20% Native American and all these other labels I'm a cisgender attack helicopter and demand your respect that is the entire statement and for you to say that it's the right doing identity politics makes me laugh that you were trying to say anti-fascism isn't fascist I can pull over a dozen videos of someone slightly right of someone who's slightly right of trigender saying hey you don't get to attack me and proceeding to get attacked by an Tifa and their b*******
Say goodbye too my subscription...
This guy is an idiot!
2:35 MLK's protests were deliberately designed to provoke a violent reaction from the Alabama police for the national media to see. Same with Greensboro sit-ins. Why is this a controversial tactic?\n3:41 Antifa openly advocates violence against peaceful protestors; Gibson and his group clearly do not even if some attending their events are violent.\n3:47 He cursed out the neo-Nazis and white supremacists attending his rally. What more can he do?\n7:55 If you watched any of the national media or read the national newspapers you so eagerly criticize, you'll know they don't support the all sides narrative. Trump was roundly criticized for his Charlottesville remarks by the same reporters who wrote those negative headlines about antifa.\n8:33 The Neo-Nazis who attend these rallies have never actually committed a genocide of millions of people but subscribe to an ideology responsible for genocide. Same with antifa, whose members mostly identify as communists. Neither group is being fascist or totalitarian but we can still call them that anyway since that's what would happen if they were in power.\n9:39 No it would be if 28 of those articles were talking about evil doctors who cured their patients of cancer but gave them brain cancer instead.
I'm here before the fandom ruins it
A speedrun already!?
You have 24 hours to collect all of the contracts from my debtors- Wait, where did Cuphead GO?\nAfter 37 minutes, the devil was defeated by Cuphead after he defeated every one of his debtors. Somehow.
When you're trying to hit the pink dice, it's WAY easier to just stand right under and parry as soon as you jump if you're trying to get a specific number.
Please submit this for next agdq or sgdq would love to see it there :)
raise your hand who believes that bendy shit fandom will ruin cuphead
Anybody know what hit him at 43:33 ?
Can someone explain what he did to Cagney the flower?
I'm here before Cuphead porn takes over the internet.
Why do you stop the timer after every boss fight?
its been 2 days.....
Final boss - the skin of the devil
On the last boss, Is that a design flaw/bug where you don't need to drop down and you can still kill the devil just by the hole?
I know fandoms are going to fuck this game up for everyone else
Haven't played this game yet... looks fuckin' gorgeous and fuckin' boring
Cuphead is the Megaman we needed to fill the void left by the failure of mighty number 9 or whatever that bs was called
Holy patootie the charge shot is stronger than I gave it credit for.
When you want to complete the game and return it after to get your money back
You can knockout Dr. Kahl's Robot in the first phase in under a minute (I randomly got it in 56 seconds, which means it can probably be done even faster). I did it by complete accident and I'm not even sure what happened to be honest. I'm still not sure if it was a glitch or legit, but when it happened I used 4 magnet EX moves right next to his chest just before his heart popped out and it must have all hit his heart at once or something.
With people speedrunning it already, I wonder if it's too late for a Cuphead run to get into 2018's AGDQ?
I always assumed the flames would spread across the entire screen and kill you if you didn't drop down.
Really good, but there's a lot of room for ambitious speedrunners to beat this time!
I'm genuinely surprised people have already set records for this game and it's only been out for 2 days. This kind of dedication amazes me, because of how effortless this looks.\nYou've definitely earned a new sub
Now that's what you call skill
Is this the legend 27!?
I feel like the smoke bomb could be abused for some cool ass strats
2:10 ah yes a tree full of big nosed wood jews
Do you manually stop/start the timer during the loading times?
love the run, even moreso love the amount of optimization still needed on it - would love to see it done perfectly in the future.
show this to dean please
You sir are a Saint and a scholar. A god among men sir.
Why can't there be a category for a weapon swap abuse run wouldn't it just fall under glitched any% or glitched all bosses?
Well I learned how to cheese a lot of bosses today
This is how an average iwbtg player plays cuphead.
Pretty good I can see some places you can speed past those stages though.
Lol I was wondering if they were gonna get the dragon first time. Guess not :P
Well that was fast :y
Nice run, you lost SOOOO much time on king dice. Try pause-buffering if that helps to line up your dice roll
Once tumblr gets a hold of this, it'll be cataclismic autism just like undertale
HOW
This was cool
lol that satan strat
20:35 A masterpiece speedrun... Until this happens
I want Cuphead in AGDQ!!!
The bug flowoy
Did this so fast some of the bosses didn't even know they were dead already like the 🐝 queen
wtf this game trippy as hell
Dem Dice Rolls :((
Unreal. Great job, bro!
That was fast
that was fast
Very nice run
wtf
11:00 hehe lucky bug
My first 37 shameful minuets of cuphead
Nice man! :D Awesome job :)
And is the time lost due to Run'n'gun really worth the coins?
Oh, well. I imagine how devs decided to split the final ultimate boss into dozens of absolutely weak mini-bosses halfway through development just for lulz. If you ever played a bullethell game before, you'll beat this one in a single approach on the day you've bought it. So what's the charm in it? Looks like an oversimplified 2D game with retro-style art direction. Or was the art direction the main selling point to manipulate the minds of oldtimers?
Nice job! you got it really fast but i believe you can do it even better if you tried. btw why are you apologizing for using a glitch to win? thats a part of speedrunning.
Japaaaaaaannnn. That's the word I hear every time you finish a level.
20 extra minutes that it takes to finish the tutorial
the game will be better if the music follow the game like the animations
Here before viral
Why is your timer pausing during loading screens?
10:49 Flowey you ok?
I feel like Spread Shot will out DPS Charge Shot in many fights and also help with clearing out adds. Have you tried out Spread much?
Hey! Is there anyway for me to get in contact with you? Im thinking of getting into Cuphead speedruns myself and I want to learn from the master
This is the standard for Cuphead runs due to random load times. How is there a standard already? =P
Pausing the timer for each loading screen? Is that a thing you are allowed to do?
Is this harder than Super Meat Boy?
Where is the leaderboards for the run? Speedrun.com looks barren.
23:20 I'm confused.
no weapon swap abuse isnt even a category tho
exploiting the last boss does not count.
why even pause the timer for loadingscreens
I think you did the flying boss that turns into a moon on the easier difficulty, at the score screen you only got 1 star
Fucking asians.
What happens if you give the devil the contracts? I really wanna know
Anyone else think they might have made the orange gun a liiittle bit too high dps? I get it but it's a tad overkill
10:46 What happened?! O_O
I've never seen a speed run where you pause in the loading zones...
I feel as if asians would hate this game\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm funny
This game looks so cool. I'd love to be able to play it but I lack a gaming PC or PS4. At least I can watch though. ☺️
Heres some real high class folk BEGONE!
Why does the timer frequently pause?
I've never seen a speedrun pause on load screens... How is that a thing here?
How has Disney not sued this game? The art looks EXACTLY like old-Disney cartoons. I'm probably missing something obvious aren't I....
Your Speedrun Needs To Include Load Times..Your Timer Isn't Accurate
I predict the fandom of this game will become like Fnaf's and Undertale's
on god, colin is such a perfect gentleman. i felt so intimidated watching this interview lmao. and everytime he gave lengthy answers, i could feel my insides shrivelling a bit 😂😂😂

@Amber Scholl I think that Amber should pierce her nose with and get a little looking like diamond earing I know she won't pierce it just because I want, but I think she would look cute and show off her diamond style and always have that little diamond in her nose or even a pierced belly button! Love you Amber! So just like it up little glamies so she could see my comment and think about it.💋💖💗💅Btw this is just an idea so no need to do...

I couldn't stop looking at his lips when he was talking after coloring half and half😂
Also James you have got to stop talking so fucking fast, it's awful dude
I'm so glad you give the disclaimer in here that it's dangerous to buy knock off makeup. You are so awesome
“And now I’m in-shook” I’m ded😂😂😂
This kid is pretty cute!
How does he pull a darker foundation shade then his neck so well I am confusion.
James, a question!! Would you ever consider vlogging? I find you so intriguing. Thank you for sharing your talent and life with us. <333
I absolutely love your makeup tutorial videos, you are an amazing makeup artist James!! <3 but, the real makeup products look WAY better than the fake products. You still made them both work, so slayyyyy James!!
Your foundation is too dark for you boo
i always think i know a little bit about makeup until i go back online and watch james and manny.. :__:
i love this series omg i want more!!!! but i have to be honest, this music annoyed me the entire time watching it
Kim posted about the KKW fakes on her snapchat calling the fakes out
Why is his audio shit?
HILARIOUS!! Dat KKW lip is killin it!😂😂 thank you for this video! I hope & pray to the fuckin gods that your face/ lips are okay! Love you, James!!
Slightly more fat James what are you trying to say jk jk ilysm 😂😂
What's the background music called at 2:19?
He got mad about his eyebrow looking bad but he's the one that messed up the brow and he said the tip isnt defined but he broke the tip of the brow liner
Are you part of the Illuminati because those three moles on your neck make a triangle!!!
The real version looks better.

THIS GUY IS A GOURGOUS PRINCESS OMFG Like if u agree
Why are you so fine?! And that voice😍😭
Anyone know which videos he sings in
Wow that was a huge difference.
What are you beating your face with?😉 I'm super dirty minded
Video bothers me\n\n\nWhy I wonder?\n\n\nOh yeah\n\n\nCoz I have no money for the “real” stuff
I love your hair now James!😘 it looks so good sista!
I love James but his foundation looks a little to dark for him
Uhm it looks exactly the same?
This video told us a thing that a good looking makeup not depends on products but his skill of applying makeup 🙄
He has lipstick on his nose 😂😄
Am I the only one that has to change the play back speed to understand him?  Lol\nPlease teach me your makeup ways!!
Wtf is it with beauty gurus and long intros like hurry the f up
Please zoom in more when you are doing shadows? I hear what you are saying, but can't see very well. Love ya, as always.

Took him 10 minutes for him to say something remotely positive my god
Y'all can just go to drug stores and get makeup it's cheaper and not all bad quality
do a video with patrick star⭐️
You should add a 2nd camera where it’s like macro and you can put your swatched arm underneath it to show it better than the main camera. Or like a close up of a product.
Yo why he always got the stuffy nose voice
Am I the only one who thinks he looks gorgeous without makeup
Please do another one!!! That is so crazy the kkw lips looked sooo different its disrespectful!!!😱😱😱

Dude that's a pot!! Not pan my god...
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming! \nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus!\n\nHe LOVES you! Believe it! \n\nPlease do not believe the lies of the enemy. Jesus is NOT angry at you. He is waiting for you to call upon Him! \n\nHe will deliver you and save you from what is swiftly coming! Look around you in this world, every thing is becoming chaotic. Jesus warned us about these signs in Matthew 24. \n\nPlease, if you do not know The Lord, make Him Lord of your life TODAY. You may not get another chance to do so, and to die without The Lord Jesus is extremely DANGEROUS. \n\nThe Lord promised to never turn a person away when they come to Him, so come as you are and let Him make you new. \n\nShalom, friends!
I didn't like
i like to talk like this guy when im bored to irritate my mum...
I’m eating a sandwich now. Thanks for making me hungry.
That's a pot not a pan. GF's chest is as flat as a pan. That pot is deep. Also like my GF
Why waste the insides of the container apples?  Better to spoon the apple out and cook that instead? No?
Too many apples , also very sweet.

So, why not just hollow out the first apples?

For stewed apples, you don’t need to boil the apples.\n\nI just cut apple into quarters (using apple cutter which takes the core away)\nPut in MICROWAVE for around 5-8 mins (depending on amount of apples. 4 apples = around 8 mins.) \n\nWallah!
This man sounds like a robot
I try it home
Lol ain't nobody got time to bake apple!!
I dont even know what a crumble is
We all know for well we ain't getting out of bed to go do this, or if I can do it at all.

Hey guys! There's a little corolla easter egg somewhere in here, so hopefully I didn't make it too obvious! Also like I stated in the video, I live in Texas and I personally know people who have been affected by Hurricane Harvey. This means a lot to me, so if you want to help out with relief efforts here, in Puerto Rico or in Florida (or anywhere else) consider downloading Tab For a Cause completely for free; http://tab.gladly.io/r/reallifelore. You guys are always amazing :)
MEGA TSUNAMI?
We should take the hurricane and push it somewhere else
I laughed so hard at the title lmao
Delete this. Do not give trump the idea
Why is this channel obsessed with toyota corollas
That’s dumb as hell. Whoever proposed that should loose their degree wtf
This proves that Sharknado is a lie
Useless video! You can't absorb energy by adding more to it, So obvious. Why do we even have a video for this.
In tHE EYe of A hURRIcane TheERE IS qUIet
It makes a super duper mega nuclear reacting hurricane shooting miniature black holes into space destroying Satan so his tungsten scale triangle collection could implode into a 5 mile long ice cream sundae also destroying Poland for some reason while the hurricane goes to the sun to make green peppers not a thing anymore still keeping Timothy the sad clown alive intell 109 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and sea cucumbers mutate and take over the world at the year of 2464.
There are acts of god you cant fight, you see a hurricane you have to get out of the way. But suddenly when  your in a Jager, you can fight the hurricane and you can win- Riley Becket.
Hopefully our potus doest decide to test this out.
This guy talking about bullshit. So what happen. If u drop eye of storm? . There has no energy. And core of hurricane. Im not the scientist but. Wonder even if it is strong. Eye is the core. Would it work?
I was just wondering if there is billions of damage what about the jobs created with the clean up & rebuilding of the damage? There's always a silver lining to storms it may not be the best thing about this topic but it's still a way of looking at a tragic catastrophe!
Nice biased opinion. ..Puerto Rico's humanitarian disaster..the facts are really out there that they had supplies there even before the storm hit and their truck drivers were busy taking care of their own problems at home and neighborhood to even show up to deliver goods..just sounds like you're trying to make it to be trump's fault like the fake media does
What if you dropped a nuclear bomb into a sink hole? Or volcanoe?
You should make a video where a united Asia or uniting the americas and compare them
does the extenstion use your computer to mine bitcoin?
As a kid, I always thought that we should stop a Hurricane/ Tornado by tossing a giant boulder on top of it with a catapult
what if a hurricane's energy was somehow harvested to power stuff?
Nah bruh. We all need to do the “Kami Kami blast” facing the hurricane to push it back
And so an atomic bomb is not the most powerful thing on earth.\nBut by taking away a small amount of energy could cause a dominow effect dont know how to spell deal with it so it would be a good idea to heat up the air under the hurricane and making the displacment not there with simple earth heat batteries adding heat then taking heat thus solthing global warming and devistating desasters...
i was in the area where the hurricane hit texas right before it did. so glad i left when i did.
Have the Flash run around in the opposite direction
What would happen if a nuke exploded in the Mariana Trench
I'm about to donate so much money to hurricane relief by watching porn.
2 questions \n1) what if we made a weapon that created Hurricanes \n2) what if two hurricanes collided with each other
or not i dont know what happens if we try
Shine lasers into them?\n\n*IM GOING TO TRY THIS*
Skip to 0:15 for content.
ummmm BAD NUCLEAR BOMBS MESS WITH THE ATMOSPHERE  IF WE PUT TOO MUCH NUKES THEN EARTH WILL FREEZE FOREVER!!
I don’t think nuking a hurricane would help at all I just think it would destroy land and possibly make the hurricane worse

Jesus will rapture His faithful on the Feast of Trumpets in October 2017\n\nThe Jews didn't keep up with their own calendar. Big surprise with what we learn of them from the scriptures. This means the watchmen haven't been wrong about the timing of the rapture. What was wrong was the calendar due to it being shoddily put together ahead of time. \n\nWe know now that the Jews neither kept up their own calendar nor did they account for the leap year this year which pushes the Feast of Trumpets (and all of the Fall Feasts) back one month / lunar cycle.\n\nPremade calendars don't work well on God's timeline. We were one month early. The Feast of Trumpets hasn't even happened yet!\n\nCheck out Jerry Toney's video that explains the Hebrew leap year which pushes all of the Feast days, and everything else, back by an entire month / lunar cycle. This is done just days before the month is changed over. We had no idea it was even a thing until now.\n\nHere is Jerry Toney's video: https://youtu.be/h32TOHhUyB8\n\nJesus is still returning on the Feast of Trumpets this year! October 20th or 21st, 2017 when the new moon is sighted!\n\nDid you know that even the scoffers are fulfilling Biblical end times prophecy?\n\n2 Peter 3:3-4\n3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,\n4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\n\nJude 1:18\nHow that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.\n\nIf you want:\n\n- Proof the Bible is True\n- To know what Jesus did for you\n- To know how to be saved\n\nThen this link provides answers: https://tinyurl.com/y9el7ua4

why is clicking an extension necessary for them (creators of the extension) to donate the money?  if they want to donate them money they shouldn't need you to click on an extension.  just more advertising bullshit.   they should do it out of the goodness of their hearts, not a business decision to get a tax writeoff which shouldn't exist anyway. either donate or don't.
just helpee built 3 houses in florida 2 houses in puerto rico and 9 in Houston.
Wasn't it the  nuclear bomb test in North Korea that began these huge climate changes and storms
We should probably just ask arnold to see what happens...
I thought of this years ago. How about what happens if you ride a jetski at full throttle through a waterspout
What if you bomb it as its forming
You have a nuke hurricane combo making the fallout much worse
*Nukes a hurricane*\n*Creates a giant tsunami and an even bigger hurricane*

Why don't we try to get energy from hurricanes

Hit it with a Texas Smash
u dont have to blow up huricane, u just need to unbalance it.
What happened if you drop a nuclear bomb into a hurricane? Hurricane will die. What will happen if you drop a poop over there? it will be called huriop and if that hurricane hit us it will be rain POOPZ
Throw a Nokia into it
'drop toyota corolas in them' ... well it CoULD work
Thanks for making this video. What an interesting question. it’s something that has always come to my mind sometime ago what if...
Such an American question
Why not just built better drainage systems in hurricane areas?
what if the whole world reunited today?
I will guess what will happen the nuke will go in and then it goes with swirly and then it is launched hitting something but it cut cause a tsunami since it can can explode when it hits the ground in a body of water 🤑
no just build solid houses
If you nuke a hurricane you might create a radioactive hurricane. What a dumb idea.
238 Tsar Bombas per day equates to 0.0027546296 per second. What do you mean that they aren't powerful enough?\nA Tsar Bomba releases 2.1*10^17 J in total where as a hurricane releases 6*10^14 J per second. Results from Wikipedia link below. The majority of the energy from the bomb will be released within a few seconds, this combined with the fact it is 3 powers of ten higher suggests that there is enough energy in just one of the bombs to cause an impact or at least suggest that energy is not the reason it wouldn't work. Simply saying that the energy release isn't high enough is false. For that to be true the energy release would need to take longer than 350 seconds although as I said the rate of energy release from the explosion would probably be much higher in the start and reduce in a non linear fashion.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)
So all in all, it’s a fucking stupid idea.
We could just take the hurricane and push it somewhere else
Kim Jong Un will take note of this.
Hahaha, am I the only one who had REALLY thought about this before seeing this video?
Wanna stop hurricanes ?\nBUILD A HUGE FUCKING WALL!\nEven Trump agrees!
Idiots. Just drop a nokia 3310 on the hurricane eye.
It will cause a tsunami it’s basically like a earth quake under water
U don't add energy to energy if u want to stall something
I can't imagine, how people made themselves vulnerable for a wind. it is just an AIR. You have buildings that stand after hurricanes, why don't copy them? Why do you build houses where you live (if having home is important, maybe I am ignorant of something) of paper? You have money for that, US is not an India, where people can't afford normal material. You have knowledge how to make concrete or other material. Please, let me know.
Can you shoot a gun in space?
I always wonder this
Katrina didn't have to cost 105 billion. We could have just left Louisiana like it was...a worthless pile of incest garbage.
No stop fucking with th earth scientists always make shit worse i dont want a fucking raidation strom
Great filter #876: realize nukes can't dissolve hurricanes.\nResult: Mankind survived.
Pouring massive amount of pee in the eye of the hurricane will stop it.
Why are toyota carollas being used as a unit of measurement??? Say crysler concorde and i'll have a better idea.. but seriously? Where did it come from?
What funds it though? The cause... how does opening a tab make money?
I hope someone could clarify this for me. The video says the energy releases by a hurricane per day is equivalent to around 238 Tsar Bombas. If we did detonate that many Tsar Bombas, that would wipe out the entire earth's civilisation. But why doesn't a hurricane destroy human civilisation? Considering they are releasing the same amount of energy per day?
Can you do what if the Venetian republic (with all its territories in Italy, Slovenia Croatia, Greece and Cyprus) reunited today? PLEASE

*HIDE YOUR COOLERS, NOBODY IS SAFE*
Its spreading, first Odell now AB, when will the madness stop? #CoolerLivesMatter
**Sad trombone plays**
The cooler deserved it
AB will propose to the water cooler next game
Big Ben on the decline
Don't turn into Odell please AB.
This needed to be posted?
He was wide open & Big Ben didn’t see him. & all of the sudden maybe that’s why he’s mad
This better be talked about on all the sports shows since they always do with O'Dell
can't blame Antonio. Wide opened and Ben throws an incomplete pass
Todd Haley almost got stole on lol
When AB gettin' nothing, you know Rothlisberger is on the decline.
They're called the Pittsburgh Steelers, not the Antonio Brown's.
Get that man the ball!! #tonytoetap #GOAT #callGod
Would you be mad if you were wide open on the other side of the field? Just curious
I wouldnt want Haley touching me either.
Sorry guys.
Ben is just not using Bryant and brown well...his got big time players...but not using them to the full potential . ..i hope he retires ...his done man
I did the same thing because I got ab on my fantasy team lol
I understand he was upset but to pull away from the coach and throw a cooler is not exceptable
I don’t blame him, Ben could have gotten 6..
Ben and the other 2 Amigos from his draft class or trash now.
He better apologize to that cooler if he scores a TD next week... 😂✊️
keep the rich super slaves under control,....right?
I'm taking a knee for water cooler oppression and Steeler brutality.
Jimmy smith had him on lockdown
The cooler kept its cool though\n(Thank you, I'll see myself out, etc)
Under control haha that's the opposite of the nfl
Come on Brown, don't stoop to Obj's level.
I wouldn't blame him. He was wide open and close to possibly scoring a Touchdown
Rumor has it AB apologised afterwards and asked the cooler to marry him.Prenub ofcourse.
Looks like he's mad at the police and military to me.
Every right to be angry.  You are the best wide receiver on the team.  You should always be the first option.  Big Ben is declining.
Lol shut tf up brown cuz he didn't even see your stupid ass
Anger management
I LOVE IT.
Were all boy cotting baby
So nobody cares that an NFL qb didn't see a wide open AB??
Roids do that
Some People Take a Knee. Some People Throw a Cooler. \nThe Struggle is Real!
He's mad cause his barber canceled last minute :/ AB didn't look as fresh as he always does
Its ok when Brown does it but when Odell does it, hes a baby, and he complains too much!!! Makes sense.
Tbh, I'd be angry too. He woulda scored if Ben saw him.
This was just too funny, but All I can say is it's AFC north football. I mean things are gonna get heated what do you expect. And AB is a competitor and he probably knew how much that TD could've helped us since typically when we vs the Ravens those games are usually decided by 7 points or less
It was just the black coming out of him, nothing new.
I've watched Mike Tomlin teams look progressively less imposing, year after year. Even Ben said last year, regarding the Patriots What rivalry? We're the little brother
Take a knee for that kooler.
What a jerk its not like that caused them a loss. Get well soon Cooler.
Antonio is a competitor he wants to be the best he can be he trains hard and studies hard to do his job and when you do your and your wide open for could have been a touchdown it's heartbreaking.
Well, if you can not make a play on the field (get on TV).  (Get on TV) Make one on the sideline. :)
I think his teammates were clownin' him the whole game for some reason. Watch the full game, they all did the signature AB first down drop
Its Enough Clear out this coaching staff.
shouldve been a TD watched the whole game , Handle that better Ab go to yo QB and say yo bro im open take yo time dont snap on yo team and yo OC . disappointed in u from that .
Man this is gonna look bad for him and the steelers organization. First not showing up for the anthem now you're best player is acting like a fool. C'mon now guys this isn't steeler like
I guess Antonio never dropped a pass that could have been a first down or touchdown.
He just mad he didn't get to twerk in the endzone like he usually does.
What was Ben looking at!
Ben on the decline FAST.
If this was Odell everybody would be like he a crybaby
Did everyone already forget about how the falcons blew a 25 point lead.
when will he propose to the cooler?
Now he needs to fight Josh Norman to be the new Odell Beckham
The cooler was wide open as well
Cooler lives matter. Petulant child.
This is what happens when you devote your entire life to a game that elementary school aged kids play in the backyard.
Pathetic. The dude is being paid millions and yet he acts like a little kid
The moment you realize your offense is more dysfunctional than the Browns offense. Life as a Ravens fan. 😞😒
Maybe he should take a knee to bring this attention to ben
Spoiled brat
Sit that p.o.s. !!
that wrong man he did nothing to you... that cooler had a family
Showing this tantrum to the masses is why Terrell Owens is not in the hall of fame a few morbid these and Antonio might get this label.   Hopefully T.O. makes it in next year
spoiled
better him than Odell
Thank god for Julio
Hes such a baby
Like that before
Soft
DUDE Dont become ODell Crybaby ..... Keep the skills loose the Tantrums ..
That's the first time I have ever seen brown get mad
Jesus Christ is Lord and is the only way to Heaven
antonio brown needed to cool down but he keeps on knocking over coolers. #coolerlivesmatter
Not the Antonio brown ik and love
Man ppl are dumb this is part of the competitive fire that gives AB an edge. He cares about winning. It was a huge missed opportunity and those moments are super frustrating for any athlete that wants to win. There’s a reason he’s the best in the business #businessisbooming
Brown is prima-donna just like Odell Beckham.
Crap
Just another overpaid child throwing a tantrum for not getting his way. Poor big baby
Meanwhile the score 26 - 9 was the BIGGEST margin of victory that Big Ben has ever had against the Ravens, w/ the Stillers winning 10 out of the last 22 games in Baltimore. AB can't rejoice over a W? #smh
If Odell is immature then Antonio Brown is what.......?
Acting like Odell?\nJulio jones>Odell and Antonio brown
“Ab is better than obj because ab doesn’t throw tantrums”
He is too expensive to have on your line up and not consistent.
What's the NFL?
I already know no ones gonna talk about this, BUT if Odell gets mad no no that’s mainstream news all over social media
I would have made sure he wasn’t open
Steelers are crybabies
Awww u gonna cry?
Not supried it's the Pittsburgh Kneeleers
Ben is stupid and about as good as Jay Cutler right now? Give Jay all of Ben's weapons and all the sudden Jay isn't as terrible any more. Antonio will have to be patient with Ben. Ben doesn't have the vision of an elite quarterback and is losing his physical skills rapidly. Ben has mentally retired and will not be able to lead this very talented team to another SB victory.
Please put on Alicia Keys cover!
Missing GM more😕
y'all should also upload alicia keys one
I appreciate that he did this cover, but the sensuality and mystique that GM's version had was lost on this one. Makes me miss GM even more than ever.
As a huge George Michael fan , covers of his songs usually leave me cold but this is great ,well Done Sam Smyth for honouring him
Good version but nothing on George Michael himself, just goes to show what a voice he truly was!
I know he always gets compared to GM...but he didn't have the vocal dynamics like GM has. \nThe moments to be soft and full blast.
George is a legend...no one can surpass his tone..Oh how sad he is gone 😞
Just showcased how much better George Michael was.
Thank you Sam...\nYou are right, the INCREDIBLE George Michael
I caught a glimpse of his Arabic tattoo at last كن طيبا it means Be Kind
Even though I love George Michael, My Sammy did a GREAT job and I LOVE HIM! These are called covers for a reason so everyone saying George Michael did it better, OF COURSE HE DID, that's why it's a cover for a reason. Just enjoy the fact someone liked and looked up to him enough to pick him to do a cover on and embrace it!
So now we know who his favorite artist of ALL TIME is
I became gay just by the title of this.
Sam Smith’s background vocalists are amazing!!!
U have a voice like a angel I wish I could go to a concert of yours I am such a big fan I have liked you ever sense stay with me I can’t get over how amazing you and your voice is (Boston would be a good place to do so ) lol
I agree. George was amazing, outstanding talent. Had a voice of an angel.
I miss George Michael
MY FAVORITE ARTIST IS SINGING MY OTHER FAVORITE ARTISTS SONG!!!!
If you wanna hear the definition of a George Michael tribute search this on YouTube: James Arthur-Careless Whisper(Acoustic) George Michael cover-House of Blues Orlando
So much better than Lorde's take on phil collins
did he stole his outfit from his grandfather closet?
Wow he has lost so much weight . Has he got AIDS ?
This is good but he sings it to fast and without any emotion. That shows how incredible George Michael was. Nobody can replace him.
his sweet fucking face.
Omfg pitch This is actually   cute {ideq explosion   .
Beautiful!!
George has nothing to worry about, if he was alive.
I want the lyrics of this version 🙏
I love this song
Too bad it wasn't done in studio.  Sound quality and mixing was a bit off.
Superb. Wisely Sam did it in his own way, didn't try to simply imitate GM. And Sam sings low notes beautifully as well as high. Fabulous Sam.
I love Sam Smith, but this absolutely falls flat.  Something missing...
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
We should congratulate a top contemporary artist like Sam Smith for keeping the memory of George alive by covering his songs - and by bringing new audiences to George's timeless music. The last thing we should be doing is attempting to compare their voices. Thank you Sam for honouring GM, and please keep reminding audiences about GM and how brilliant his music is. For what its worth, I really enjoyed your cover!!
You have done so much justice to the two songs.... Yog will be proud of you Sam!
bb sam let me hold u and love u 4ever
Not a patch on the original
WE WANT THE NEW ALBUM!!!! <3
Western populations should shed their illusions. Our governments are committing war crimes and imposing an overseas holocaust on non-belligerent countries. The West and its allies are terrorizing and destroying countries and they are falsely projecting their own high crimes onto their victims.
I can’t get enough of his voice
amazing. He did George proud
Please leave such songs alone 🙈 There's a reason why George is George 💜
I really appreciate this heartfelt tribute to George Michael. There is no point in comparing the two artists. No one will ever compare to George Michael. What matters is that Sam Smith honored George Michael and his music with a lovely medley. Sam greatly admired George and George respected Sam. It was a fitting hommage which paid respect to a great artist and is another example of celebrating George Michael's music and keeping his songs and memory alive. As George himself sang in 'An Easier Affair', See, I don't have the time for the haters.  Thank you Sam.  Nothing but LOVE <3
Sam's looking good - trim and healthy - nice - like Father Figure - Faith not too much - imo, Sam's best at ballads/slower songs -
PLEASE UPLOAD try sleeping with a broken heart  too :((((((
Could see this absolutely popping at a festival
Wow Sam gets better looking every time I see him, his singing doesn't get any better as you can't improve on perfection.
Guys, please check out my new cover of Too good at goodbyes :) Thanks \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNY2iUe_06o
You were missed, love to hear you, darling
Beautiful,love it, thank you.
😍💓 I love you Sam 💛
Please upload the Alicia Keys cover performance!
I'M SHOOK TO MY F'ING CORE! This is soooo amazing!
I love you sam smith😘
Hey guys! I just want to give my channel a kick start, I hope you can help me by checking my new post videos. Thank you guys! Very appreciated :)
I have a feeling that his boyfriend in the audience 🤔🤔
Beautiful
Didn't see that so much as a cover of, more of a tribute to, GM who he clearly loves- he's SSs' favourite artist , so SS is unlikely to think he's better than him is he? Job well done in my eyes xxxx
Look at his eyes. They shine with happiness!!!
only few singer hold the voice as George Michael  song as him
Still waiting for Adele to perform Freedom '90 someday!
Very good combination of father figure and faith 👍
I'm crying! This is so extraordinary. \nThank you for this amazing cover💕
I love you so so much Sam 😍😍😍😍
He would of loved this cover x
I've never clicked on a video so fast
He should have sang “Pray for Time” would have been awesome!
I AM IMPRESSED! VERY NICE!
whoever did sound for this know what they're doing
He is a bit 😐 at first, but at the end 😊❤️\nNot the right song for him
Are people going to start calling Sam, daddy because of this? Yikes. Amazing cover Sam!!!
He is so Talented 😍
💙💚💛💜❤
Sam is great!!
best
YAASS Sam Smith YAAAAAS!

APAIXONEI!! Ficou maravilhosa. Amazing work! Congrats you all!
Beautiful!!!
What a angelic voice.
GM brought me here😊😊😊
Perfect 😍
Why is everybody criticizing Sam.. he’s not trying to perform it better idiots but he did do it with justice..
Everyone saying George was so much better I think That's a bit of  nostalgia tbh plus Sams style is different but they are both excellent vocalist in reality
George would have loved this! =)
Còn nhớ khán đài bằng đá cộng hưởng âm thanh hình như cả hi lạp không\nLol +<~>100%=> 😁🎶💪🏻👈🏻🔩🔔📢👉🏻🎧☝🏻👏🏻
George Michael is my favorite singer, and I love Sam Smith. but this cover was cheap and didn't do justice to George Michael. disappointed :(
This gave me so much warmth
HELLO FRIENDS!!! hope u guys enjoy this deep dive into a different side of the ~mannequin challenge~ (jk it's nothing like that). hope u guys enjoy! would u wear any of this? xo, saf
Living for all of this original content omg. 🖤🖤🖤
Tyler looks great in the pink sweater
I love your videos
I think the holistic outfit was so cute on you😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💓💓💓💓💓
That Zara outfit was amazing. It's so ridiculous that it works.
What I hate about the mannequins is I can never find what they're wearing in store
I never comment on videos but I just wanted to say that I love your content! It's so original and fun to watch.
giant lsd taking friend of a Muppet 😂😂😂 I died! lol
you actually look really good in those round glasses i love how they look on you!
I'm gonna need those pants from TopShop
I hope you returned some of the clothes.
I actually really like the Zara one!!! you rocked it
I love watching safiya dance around in the streets. So fun.
you're so creative and original. I love your videos!
When u lowkey liked all the outfits especially when Safiya wears them. 😅😊
The walking in the yellow fuzzies outfit & the dancing in the last made them even better...haha. This was a really great vid.
Outfit 1: Lizzie Maguire. Outfit 2: Music festival I guess? At night once it's cooled down? Outfit 3: one of the kids from the animated TV show Recess. Outfit 4: Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Outfit 5: Some sort of maid anime. Outfit 6: Tumblr trends. Outfit 7: That 70s Show.
I actually like these outfits on her.
Am I the only one who watched this last week then got another notification for this video today..??
I could could not stop looking at that shirt from H&M! It was SO ugly!
The last one was my favorite one
You are gorgeous and I loooove your videos!!
Do a full face wearing makeup from wish.com!
Safiya I Love You & Your Video Style 😍
At 5:40 two guys stare at her (on the third day)
They let the employees put the clothing on the mannequins
I thought you were going to dress like a mannequin and stand in the windows
Your legs look like a balloon animal in the black pants. So shinny.
Every outfit was super cute and trendy I like it girlll
☺☺☺☺ we got the same name. Love your voice
Tbh I actually loved all the outfits on you😂 I just see it as fun and I think that’s just what fashion is. You’re supposed to have fun with it and just go all out(sometimes lol).\nI didn’t really like the H&M outfit on you that much(hope that doesn’t sound rude, not trying to) i think I was probably the top that kind of threw it off but idk there was something lacking in it. and yeah the Zara outfit is kinda ridiculous but it was actually really kinda cool, I think the changing the pants  and taking out the socks would suit the outfit. Maybe the shoes too? But all in out I liked it on you :) \nESPECIALLY that last one, I really loved it on you👌🏼
You should do a video where you dress as your astrology sign for a week. Most astrology instagram accounts post outfits that each sign would wear for different occasions or seasons😂😂
That was great!! Definitely an eye-opener.
The urban outfitters outfit looks so good on Saf! 😍🙌🏻
Okay but she's really pulling off that piercing hat, it's pretty cute actually!
that forever 21 outfit is cute without the jacket lol
Love that you always have coffee.  🖤
Saf, what did you put in this video? My cat attacked the screen the entire time I was watching it. 😂
Your friend's jeans are destroyed in the private area 😂😅
the Topshop pants reminded me of robbie rotten
11:41 why is there a skelecat?
you look REALLY cute in this video. like 10:40 are you kidding me?!
You should try out the air umbrella. It's supposed to be an umbrella that sprays air at the top of the pole and deflects the rain.
Any of the phandom here? Saf was featured in phils new video and I'm so proud!
great video Sophia thank you for trying out all these outfits.. so I don't have too 😂😂😂
I wish she wrapped the flannel around the flowy pants :((((
Can you try the ‘buttcrack’ jeans??
Like button isn't the only thing I'd schmash. Wink.
I love watching your videos because I go to the Galleria all the time. Definitely an adult mall rat as well, which is strange because I never actually shop at the mall. Just eat. Blaze Pizza mostly.
I thought it going to be weird. But most of these clothes l might ware.\nNice subject.
Don't make me dance, don't make me do it hahah
So much denim! Too bad I outgrew all of my denim skirts and jackets from middle school 😕 are we gonna get super glossy lip gloss back soon, too? I hope they find a formula where you don't end up eating your hair all day.
You look good in everything, ffs
You look like a 23 year old version of my 7 year old neighbour😂
on day three she straight up looked like a minion on acid.
All of the outfits looked so great on you, even the LSD outfit 😂 Somehow it works, and I love it!
I loved the final mannequin outfit, honestly! It was my favorite!
9:12 easy, they won’t buy it
That was a great video! Next time, you could also try dressing as a store model (it's similar but clothes have been worn by a real person once as you can see by the pictures inside)
you have seen nothing on missguided uk ones💃🏻💃🏻
I thought outfit no 1 was pretty cute except for the fur, clutch, and hat.
Her videos are so creative
i remember when i was a teenager, i would steal mannequin looks all the time because i didn't know how to pair clothes back then lmao
You should do one of these every season,imhere for it
I love the urban outfitters outfit I am in love with it 😍💗💗💁
I would wear all of these outfits. I am so extra.
She probably has a million pairs of shoes by now lol
U look like a minion with the yellow poof arm thing 😂 ..
Safiya, I love how your videos are a mix between style/beauty videos and social experiments. You're probably my favorite YouTuber to watch. That said, fast fashion bothers me because it is one of the most damaging industries for the environment and I worry about the working conditions of the people who make the clothes. For the sake of sustainability, I would love to see one of your challenges take place in a second hand store. Please consider it. There are many unique treasures to find! Thank you for your wonderful videos and for taking the time to read this!
make your bf do a boy version for this
Trying to find that H&M top! Help lol
How the heck can you afford buying five entire outfits in one week? :D
Please more like these !!
I wish so bad I were born a girl so I could wear these outfits T_T
Why do I watch these.
i actually really love look 1 and 2
All of your videos are fucking retarded it's horrible
the outfit from Zara would literally be something Bella Thorne would wear on a normal day
I suggest getting rid of the Starbucks plastic cup.
should have tried a UNIQLO  mannequin~~~
TAYLOR SWIFT BELLY HAHAHHSJSHAHAJAJAJA IM SO USING THAT
i loved this omg
*********Someone help me find that Zara benie **********
That H&M shirt is horrible.
Those guys staring at Saf! 😂 5:40
5:35😂😂😂😂
Saf and her drinks
Remember all the freaking shearling from 1999 too! Omg, freshman yr of high school, shearling coats, sweaters, everywhere

2:43 “I skinned Elmo.”
I feel fluffy, oh so fluffy😂\n-Safiya 2017
*I SKINNED ELMO*
You beautiful creative weirdass soul
you should buy eBay mystery boxes
Now you need to meet PJ Liguori
what is the to-do list you use? it looks so good and aesthetic i want it
You write scripts and come up with video ideas - I would argue that that is creative too, but I totally get your sentiment to be around people who are more creative than you / to whom creativity comes easily.\nAwesome video, my dear!
Don't worry girl it happens to the best of us !
Omg it's crazy how all of my friends are creative in some way and just there like :/ ekkk. 100% feel this.
You are creative in your words not in your images. You are still a creative person. Just in your same way.
I didn't realize how similar we are. I've been watching you for years. The thing is, I'm so detail-oriented that I can be artistic and make a perfect piece of art, but I have zero creativity so I can't come up with my own designs. I can barely start a coloring page, because I can't pick which colors would look the best, but if you give me a color-by-number, by golly, it'll be the best color-by-number you've seen.
I think you need to be very creative to be good at math, understand, and discover it...
Hannah!!  Creativity is innate in all humans - it's the ability to imagine things, to see or find meaning in abstract ideas, to express yourself.  The application of creativity is down to technique (a learnable skill!).  I bought the lie all through school that people are either talented or not talented - You're either good or not good...  Nobody ever told me that the people who get good at anything spend hours upon hours upon hours practising and that there are no shortcuts.  I think people are drawn to different things, predisposed for whatever reason or influence - maths included - and are therefore happy and want to spend time doing it.   It might not feel like a chore as it does to others, and perhaps people feel like they haven't had to 'work hard' to get as good as they are...   Every single human is creative!!!  :)   :)   My twopenneth!
Love this so so much!
Love this! I can relate so much with everything you said
I love this but it's fucking with me because I am neither creative or organised. I'm officially a lost cause
I’ll never get that time back :( why the hell is this on trending?
You do realize this video was an art piece right? It flowed like spoken word.
Da fuq kind of job interview is this?
I am definitely NOT an artist. I'm rational, logical and a problem solver, not a creative person. I am not organized, not a people person and too anxious to be a communicator. \n\nYou are a good Youtuber Hannah, because you are a good communicator.
Not to be off topic but I love your little necklace it's too cute :)
I love this video and I really respect your argument. But - I'm afraid I am one of those people who believes that most people are creative in some way! I believe that being able to craft an argument (like you have in this video or like you would in an academic essay), and see a problem in a way that other people can't (e.g. a logistical problem that requires a unique perspective or careful organisation) is highly creative! I'm aware that this all depends on the definition of an artist/creative person but I would take that to be a person wiht original ideas and ways of thinking and think you are definitely one of those people! (p.s. I love your channel a lot but have never commented before!) X
Great content and intelligent speech win over doodles or fancy editing any day 😊 The way you think and the things you say are brilliant- could be 380p and upside down, your content would still be more thought provoking and beneficial to the world x
oh great i'm neither creative nor driven or organized what am i to become
I really needed to hear this, thanks a lot
Title:  I am not an autist lmao
okay but why did I cry?
That 'um' was so harmonious
Creativity is a matter of perspective. Isn't organization an art form? Your art may feel different but it's still great!
I love it and I feel you!
10 000 hours, just like anything else in the world. But it has to be something you like.\n\nI guess our generation is used to get what they want right now, we're not use to sing for our super so to speak. Which is sad, it almost bring us back to the era where natural selection dictated what we were suppose to become.
I played the game and it's just plain terrible (in my opinion ) the ads are just fake content (obviously)
Same here. \nBut I love to film videos and to talk about whatever I like.\nI basically would not say I am completely uncreative, at least I know how to draw and to semi good play the violin. But to be honest I’m lazy af. \nBut this is the internet.. a space where everyone is welcome, even if you have no special plans, talents or creativity. There is a place for everyone in here.
lol I thought the thumbnail said I am not an autist
I'm not traditionally creative; I can appreciate art but I can't create my own. I used to do speech and drama classes in high school and was good at it because I was always given a script and was good at empathising with the characters. Though when we did voice exercises, they were improv and I was rubbish at that (I'm also rubbish at knowing what to say unless I'm talking to someone I'm close to). And when I do get ideas (usually story ideas) I can never figure out how to transfer that on paper unless haphazardly. I guess I'm too much of a perfectionist. But I've always excelled at and loved maths and science, so much so I'm doing a physics degree. At uni I also enjoy electives from arts units where I get to analyse something rather than create something (I did well in politics and gender studies, and I enjoyed English Lit in high school though the latter was a lot harder and required a lot more effort to achieve a high mark). I guess I'm just not a creator. Which is fine, cos I'm damn good at interpreting, analysing and breaking down difficult concepts to bite-sized pieces.
Honestly this video made me feel so much better about not being creative. I'm good at completing objectives, going through routines, and just getting stuff done. And seeing someone be successful in a creative industry while not being creative. Means I feel better about being able to do things!
Everybody is an artist; they just don't know it.   \nDidn't you write a book?  That's creative.  \n :
Being organised is just your form of being creative. Yes you may have someone help with your videos but you're the one doing the work and taking about what makes you passionate. Your podcast is another example. It's easy to look at others and latch on to something you can't do. I'm a writer but I cannot write poetry and when my friends send me poems to look over it pains me that I can't create that sort of feeling. You have a book too and it was your idea to get others in to write it. You're creative you just don't know it :)

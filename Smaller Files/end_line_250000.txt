Ughh I need every single song that was played in this 😩 every last one. Someone help me please
I haven’t cried in so long until I seen this video 😔😔
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING!!
What a beautiful work of art 💜 I literally sobbed

I loved this so much :) she so beautiful and genuine 🥀
I lost my brother 5 years ago so when I saw the title I already knew it was about this. I remember when I heard for my brother after he passed away I'd listen to it all the time. Sitting bed side not wanting him to leave us.. we were 2 years apart too so we all looked up to him. No one had my back like he did. So this hit home. You're the best Jhené. Thank you for this.
poor dante tho he is cute x
OMG so beautiful watching you in this film, can't wait for you to release more content like this. Effortless! xxx

I didn't know I could love someone I don't know. But I swear I love her in my soul! 😩
The ending! Been there.

THIS! Wow! This album is going to be amazing!
Her song on her album “ LSD “ is connected to this video .. at the end of this video she’s taking a little piece of paper and putting it in her mouth she mentions it on her song “ LSD “  and she also mentions “ and it was fun .. what I seen omg omg “ in her video after taking that piece of paper she seen her brother
As I’m sitting in the car watching this video my bestfriend who lost her brother 2 years ago begins to cry!! Even before the tear I told her that she should watch it she will love it she can relate ! It’s so beautiful to see how strong she is but I love it even more when I see her being able to express how she feel and show that it’s not always easy and miss him! This was much needed for a lot of people and I’m glad that she was able to relate and be touched by this! ❤️ much love .
Shit Jhene! Got me in the library all chocked up, all in public! \nThis was great & the acting didn't appear forced, natural.
This is such a beautiful way to let the world see her emotions... her pain .. respect for Jhene❤️❤️❤️
Such a beautiful soul ✨love this so much
What are all the songs in the video form the album?
I lost my boyfriend on Christmas of last year and he was the only good thing I had. I'm very familiar with this pain, I'm trying. You inspire me so much, Jhene🌸
Now what do I do with all these tears? 😭😭 Jhene is such an intelligent talented artist and it's videos like these that I consider true art. I've never been so moved by an artist before. ❤️
Am I the only one who had tears in my eyes the whole time ❤️ so touching and personal I love it
I love trip trip the song made me cry
I love how he a cancer and her brother a cancer and my name is Hasani like her brother ....wow crazy shit I'm a cancer too LOVE U JHENE

I'm speechless. 😩 this was great 💛 I admire her so much for expressing her pain like this. The video, her album came out beautiful. Soooo proud of her
When I say I’ve been feeling like this for years but lately more in a dark place, wanting to left alone, writing poetry to express how I feel be on the inside,literally trying to escape the world to find happiness and peace. Seeing this was sooo beautiful and comforting to watch. It’s nice to know I’m not the only one who looks great on the outside but really hurt on the inside desperately try to find true happiness. Great job jhene 🙌🏾❤️🥀🙏🏾
this made me cry, jhene aiko really know how to get me in my feelings
His name just had to be Dantè 🤦🏽‍♀️
💜💜💜I love it
Brilliant! Beautiful! Thank you!

Beautiful!!!!,😍😍😍😍😍
🕊
This was amazing.
So beautiful!
While we're young ! I need this version ! Someone can help ??
can you post your new songs from your album on youtube
You opening that card.... Oh, Carrie!! We miss you!! Xxx
Can you get it in? It's not really in is it? Looks like a turtle head - sounds like the time I lost my virginity.
So nostalgic for Bristol now!! I haven't been back since I lived there for a year for university. My flat was just up Park Street from the Hippodrome! 😍
i live in the us so i can’t see this production (which kills me bc i’m like in love with this cast and also you), but my fingers are crossed for a cast recording or (if the world is feeling generous) a proshot of some sort?? for now i’ll settle for binge-watching interviews and promo videos but like. you’re perfect. not even kidding.
Returning to a place you performed in the past and that you have fond memories of is quite emotional and amazing!  So happy you're having such a great time on tour :D. Plus RIP Archie... ancestor material for sure!
It wasn't until I saw Carrie in the beginning of this video that I realized just how much her hair has grown out :)\n\nUpdate: just watched the end of the video with the mouse. Carrie, you are so precious.
Saw the show last night in Bristol, you were incredible!!
I'm a homing pigeon
The show was amazing well worth waiting for
Just binge watched all the watch me wednesdays again, one of the best series on YouTube 💜
Where is Les? Fab job Scott!
Watched The Addams Family today at the Hippodrome and it was flipping brilliant! I was in awe at how amazing the whole cast was, even when there were some disturbances the cast stayed in characters. I'd love to watch it again!!
You are so amazing and an absolute credit to yourself and a fantastic actress that can do anything you put your mind to x
Why did you put the box on its lid? Did you remember to put holes in it so the mouse can breathe?
Aaw your hair has gotten so long Carrie omg!! And I was emotional during this, when you opened that card and when you were on your old dressing room. Rip Archie❤️❤️
I'm seeing you today!!!!
You'r so caring for  looking after a mouse, must people would just leave him to die & you have such an outstanding voice! Did u train at a theatre school?🎭
Carrie, could you make a video doing your favorite vocal warm ups? It'd be help a lot of singers I think, plus it'd be fun and interesting to watch, thanks :)
OMG im so lucky, i got to meet you and Oliver today. I was the girl who was really emotional and couldn't stop crying, please apologise to oliver for me. All the cast were amazing today. thank you sooo much xxxx
Anyone know if there's anywhere you can buy the soundtrack for The Addams Family? Saw the show in July and loved and would love the album.
In way too emotional about Archie
The length of you hair is so cute right now!!
Carrie! Your hair in the beginning was soooo cute!
Hi, Carrie Hope Fletcher. I want to see a photos of you in Mary Poppins.
I saw that Mary Poppins all those years ago! I was right up in the gods and could see the terror on the face of the flying Mary...
Tbh I'm quite impressed that it has been fourteen years and you still remember everyone's names! :D guess I just have a very short memory...
Hi Carrie! My name is Jemma and I just wanted to say how amazing you are. You are such a beautiful person and deserve so much as you are so kind and caring and just the best person. You are an amazing singer and actor and I hope you have an amazing life and career. Unfortunately I live in Australia and I won't be able to see The Addams Family live but it is my absolute dream and I hope that maybe one day I will be able to see you and Oliver perform in The Addams family as well as the rest of the cast. Once again you are beautiful and I love you so much.\n\nMuch Love,\nJemma from Australia!❤️\n(You probably won't see this but I just thought I'd say something nice anyway 😊)
Where did you get your amazing jeans???
I always love the warm up and behind the stage parts! \nGreat vlog again, looking forward to the next one :) !!
Oh my goodness to have a signed photo of you as Eponine?!?! I'd probably faint or cry from happiness. Probably both. <3
I'm glad you are feeling better! Hope Archie survives! I'm gutted I couldn't see you perform in Bristol. But hopefully coming to see you perform in Wolverhampton - can't wait! Xx
Would be so grateful to anyone reading this if they would check my latest video, It's my first one ever which is scary. But karma will repay you good if you help a girl out :) like and sub if you would hehe ❤️❤️❤️ all you have to do is click :)))
Just got back from seeing you tonight! I love love loooooved the show❤️.  You are so amazing Carrie :)
I would love to see a video on your singing warm ups! I take a little children's choir and am looking for some genuine warm ups! They would love it if they were doing the same warm ups as you guys in theatre!! \nLove your videos, love seeing the behind scenes of something I've always dreamed of doing x
Actually ignore the last comment cos I went to see it on Thursday and it was absolutely amazing. It's honestly one of the best nights of my life. Got to see Oliver at stage door though I'm gutted I couldn't see you. But your performance made it worth it. 💜💜💜💜
nice, you went past my house
Ah! I lived in Briz for 3 years, so cliché to say but fun to see you at the Hip and around thems local parts! If you get a chance to get up Cabot Tower in the centre, any of the Boston Tea Party coffee shops AND BAKESMITHS MY DAYS. Also the Cotham Hill (said cott-ham or coth-ham?!) charity shops are BRILLO PADS for lil' gems. If you get any down time, a poke around Clifton, cobbles, coffee shops and cute things to see comes warmly reckoed (as does the fish and chips in Clifton!) Enjoy Bristol, I hope you get some quality rest <3
I think boyonce is the perfect nickname for Scott! 😂 xx
Laughing at the crew girls checking out Oli dancing HAHA
Bristol is my country lol
Carrie, I'm thrilled your in Bristol but so heart broken because I can't see you because I'm away. Is there anyway I could deliver a letter to you? I love you so much xxxxxxxx
Coming to see you on Saturday 😊😍😘
Is Scott playing Fester permanently? Did Les leave?
Please! Could you do a tutoriel on how you do your two braids with the cute scarf in it? You look too adorable !!
RIP Archie, hey! Maybe he could have played thing!
Carrie is a woman of many hairstyles and I love it. Working the pigtails.
Awww Archie! :(\nGlad you're feeling better, Carrie! I don't remember the last time you wore jeans but those ones look amazing!!!
Love watching behind the scenes of theatre!!!! It's Totally my dream job❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
NIOOOOOO ARCHIE. YOU WERE A WONDERFUL LITTLE MOUSE WHO DID NO HARM TO NO ONE. RIP LIL ARCHIE. WE LOVE YOU😘  ok now I'm crying
When you live in Bristol... OMG 😍😫💗
how would I get my letter to you? :)
I saw you perform last night in bristol (20th) and im seeing you again tonight!!! Couldnt be more excited if i tried Xx
So sad that when I lived in Bristol, the Addams family was on in Cardiff and now I've moved there for uni its in Bristol this week :(
I lived in Bristol for 3 years when I was at uni. I loved it there. It's so quirky and like a mini London.
Wow Carrie, your hair is growing so fast!
I love that you give your coworkers free reign of the camera sometimes! It's super funny, and also fun to see you in action!
any small youtubers wanting to help each other out? ill sub back x
OH MY GOD YOU ARE IN MY HOME CITY! I'm coming to see the show on Friday and I cant wait!
Carrie your backpack is lovely!! so pretty!! xx
Your voice is stunning.  I used to live in Bristol miss it so much x
Coming to see this saturday! So excited as I saw you in les mis and also played Wednesday a few years back in our groups production! My friends went yesterday said it was amazing and took photos with you at stage door! 🎉
My mum and I went to see the matinee in Bristol yesterday! It was the first musical I'd ever been to and we thought you were all amazing :) Such a fun show!
Poor Archie. :(. So is les Dennis still ill, he wasn't well when I saw you last week in Manchester. Also I think there must have been something going around that theatre, I got ill last week too. X
Aw the card from your mom and dad<3 Dressing room nostalgia :') RIP Archie!
I noticed before you mentioned the Cat Cafe that you were going to walk passed it and you gave the exact reaction I thought you would lol, love cat cafes.
Carrie, would you ever be able to do an updated hair care routine? Your hair is looking so long and lovely
I like Oliver's haircut. If I wasn't going bald, I'd get it myself.
How did this get on trending 4 with 45k views
I'm coming to see the show on Saturday evening, so excited!
Omg I LOVE your bag! Where is it from!? X
It was great seeing the show yesterday!
Do you think you're gonna venture into the cat café at some point? Love the video! x
Omg I came to watch you when the show came to my city and now my school announced today that we are doing the Addams family as our school musical this year! I'm so happy!
We were at the Saturday show. So sad not to see you proform. You did the right thing though and we enjoyed the show all the same. Hopefully we can come see you in something else soon xxx
My home town of Bristol!!!
your hair looks so good at this length :)
When I saw 'Hippo' in the title, my brain immediately went, Hippo Campus! (the band) and thought Carrie was gonna talk about seeing them live or something... guess I've been watching too many Hippo Campus vids...
Omg he died?? That's so sad 😨😰
As a Bristolian I properly yelped in delight at seeing you in our lovely city! I hope it’s treating you all well 😊
Dat ass Ms Fletcher 👀😂 someone hasn't been slacking on their squatting 💪😜
i'm seeing addams family on 5th october!!! in belfast!! missing school and all, i'm so excited
Pause at 7:58 to see three ladies checking out Oliver!
Oliver dancing and those 3 women staring at him like wtf is honestly hilarious!
ahhh i miss england so much watching your vlogs carrie but they really help me feel closer to home! <3 i wish i could come and watch the musical but unfortunately i'm a poor british uni student living in australia! i've had one normal night on loop since i first listened to it this morning and im in awe of the notes and lyrics <3
Hearing you sing made me happy💜 glad your feeling better.xx.

**glasses nose twitch**
🖤💜🖤
7:56 the girls in the background starring at Oliver dancing are somehow so funny to me. :D Love your vlogs so much! Thank you for making them, Carrie! <3
I DID follow you on instagram, but then I tried to post a supportive comment on one of your pictures and then seconds later you blocked me, probably because you didn't even bother to read past the first sentence which was, admittedly, a bit of a rough joke. \nI wish I had known how you would respond before wasting my breath typing something sincere and well-meaning...
_ALWAYS BE YOURSELF!_ \nUnless you can be a Viking. \nThen . . .  *Always* *be* *a* *VIKING!*
Here's one:  You will never be a Kung Fu master.  In fact, you will never be even remotely proficient at Kung Fu.  You will however become quite adept at the face block, i.e. using your face to block a punch.
9:22 , room for a big one !
You forgot the one about when the older version of you shows up (or anybody who has lived shows up) -  LISTEN to their advice.  I dismissed so much wisdom from older family and friends but now realize they would just sharing the things they thought a young person should know.  And they would right!\n Love your video and the whole channel.  Keep on sharing.
You are the best Emily! LOVE FOR YOU
The you that you are seems to be quite ok to the me that is me
it's a bit like Crime Emily
All so VERY true!
Buts its ok guys live in your fantasy. Just to expose you for what you are.....you are not a woman anyways. You have an adams apple . Prominent brow ridge too. Wow i knew most of hollywood is made of trannys but i guess youtube is the next invasion . Blind leading the blind.
One of those should have been learn about the power of compound interest.
A BOTTLE OF VODKA IN THE FREEZER, AND A LITTER BOX THAT NEEDS TO BE EMPTIED... THATS YA FUTURE.
This is one of the best videos that you've done. Just awesome -\nThank you
I wish I had known that I am lactose intollerent, and I have a digestive system that will get very weak over time.
:   \nLife is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.      \n:
I wish I knew to buy Apple stock...
what I wish I had known...\n1. alcohol is the only way to happiness after fifty\n2. only date those who think you're too good for them\n3. being annoying is more fun than having friends\n4. those who like me Don't know me yet
The 2nd one.I totally identify with that one.
LOve you Emily, i can relate to you very much
Never try amphetamines
I wish I had known that I had Asperger's, so I wouldn't have tried so hard to succeed in life.
Good to have you back aunty Em. 😅😅👌
how many? Many.... lol\nAnd here I thought you were such a chaste young lady
Some of the nicest people have crooked teeth so don't worry.
1. Learn to detach yourself\n2. It's okay to feel low\n3. Appreciate your alone time\n4. Never compare yourself to others\n5. Sometimes things are just not meant to happen\n6. Do not blame yourself for the behaviors of others\n7. Always Be Yourself\n8. Change is inevitable\n9. Everyone else is wrapped up in their own insecurities so DON'T WORRY SO MUCH!!!\n10. Work to Live not Live to work\n\nMy Top Ten i did copy a few from you +Emily Hart
Excellent topic choice. Good news  your degree. Think about the discipline and the topics you trained in, include web access to adult peoples curious mind which is the predominant *nature of a child, curiosity. Oops looks like your degree has got you there*, just not in the way you expected it too or in the format you trained in , however if you apply the principles/ axioms of your degree, then you can see why you are such a success. Fun fact for you: The brain keeps growing until the age of 30, often people perform better in exams intellectually in adulthood. You and your topics are as a matter of fact very intellectual. Your genius is in the way you convey, it. Thank you keep up the good work .
Interesting and very relevant,I liked especially what you said about change.  And yes you do swear too much...😊 But I still love you... take care Brian.
professional rhymer - I seem to recall that there's a word for that sort of person. Glad you took some time off, it's always good to get away for awhile. Just don't do it for too long, or too often. I can only hold my breath for so long, you know.
Loved this video! Nice one Emily. 👍
Boy. You nailed it with the school thing! Especially in the area of the value of a degree. Oh. By the way, you would be beautiful even if you were MISSING teeth, so don't sweat a little crookedness ;)
I just love it when you say,and ten. You look so relaxed and pleasant. I liked your video very much. I may show this to my daughter. Though maybe at a later time. She is only 6 now. Cheers. Well done!
Nice Emily. When a person is younger they think all this shit means everything, but as you get older you see that you just need to say what the fuck, and do what makes you happy, and push all the bullshit in this world to the side.
#1 True story. My DAD told me when I was a teenager, Son, Everybody is not going to like you, Just shit you got to live with. I took that to hart. It worked for me! Their Loss.
One thing I wish I had known... that women are fucking crazy... and good luck on being in any relationship for any length of time... oh, and none of your dreams ever come true... fuck you universe!
Just realized I don't follow you on Instagram! I feel so ashamed. Great video though Emily! Love your advice and I'm excited for more videos to come!
Your face is pretty and I like looking at it.
Miss Em, This should be mandatory viewing for anyone about to turn into a teenager.
Honestly I can relate so much to number 4 specifically and hearing you speaking about it and giving your thoughts on it was amazing for me to hear! This video in general was so helpful!
If children and young students really understood how poorly achievements in school translated into success as an adult, the drop out rate, along with failing school grades would skyrocket.
I missed you Em, thanks for doing another video x
You're still hot I see
And the one about don't try too hard; I didn't try too hard and that's why I got pretty much F*** all out of GCSE's and A Levels..... I still might try University yet, but I need to find something that really suits me and a way to make it work foe me and with me , if ya get me.
we all need a TARDIS , just think ...
@swearing: it's much less of a deal in germany, believe me! it's always quite funny to see how not-so-lady-like women from the UK or US apologise for or worry about those kinds of things. also it's a little sad to see such pressure to behave in a certain way. \n\ni mean, we do have social situations where it is absolutely NOT ok to use swear words, sure, and some where it may raise an eyebrow or two, but in general, when someone has a reason to swear, (s)he swears. \n\nabove all, there's not THAT huge a difference between men and women regarding swearing. it may be a little amusing for many when a woman swears like a drayman (as a german saying goes), because, despite our hun-like, blunt and barbaric nature^^ we do have a concept of lady-like, but seemingly we are more comfortable with a greater variety of female behaviour. \n\ngreat video, as always! have a nice weekend! :-)
What shoe size are you ?
you could end your shows with a clever ending, maybe something cute... oh how about ending each episode with a pajama dance. I bet people would love it!!!!
I understand the whole concept that something better will come along and that it will happen unexpectedly. But we are always taught actions have consequences. That has both positive and negative meanings. The relevance of that here is if you prepare for something then only you will get it. You will have to work for it. This is something firmly ingrained in most of us. The hardest part for me is about the time I have to wait between I don't have the thing I want to have and then I have it. It is really hard to stay positive and focussed on the goal that you are trying to achieve.
I was fortunate to have someone hate my fucking guts based on my ernest open eye contact, genuine smile and (not too) firm hand-shake, in my early twenties. Hadn't even had a chance to offend him! That was when I truly internalised 'No matter how nice you are, not everyone will like you (and some will FUCKING HATE you)'
Don't write down all your account passwords.  You can get programs that store them.  I use KeePass but there's plenty of others.  And if you're going that route since you don't have to remember  them, you can make all your passwords different and more complex so you're a lot less vunarable to cracking
Be yourself is the best one! There is nothing at all wrong with swearing at all, just only in certain situations really (common sense). Like I have never sworn in front of my parents and I swear every second sentence around most everyone else :D
I wish I had been told:\n1. Donald Trump is not a comedienne, he just says funny shit\n2.Jeremy Corbyn is a comedienne, and does not say funny shit\n3. Piers Morgan is not a comedienne, he just talks shit
Instead of writing down you passwords use a product like lastpass. https://lastpass.com/f?3384546
Funny you bring up swearing.  A friend and I were discussing this, and here's what we came up with.  Have you ever heard someone lament how 'in our grandparents day, you didn't swear in a public place.  Or  how a man was expected to wear a suit if he was in public.?  I think some people miss the dignity that comes with NOT letting it all go in front of each other.  If I met you for a date at a nice restaurant in sweat pants, it would give you pause, right? Swearing used to be considered vulgar, right?   Well, If I gave you the once over and told you what I thought you'd be willing to do in bed, you'd throw a drink in my face, and walk out, because you still consider that to be vulgar,  when once swearing would have been just as offensive.\n    Well, Maybe it's about what we each define as respect.  It's like that joke blaming the cartoon Teenage Ninja Turtles for teaching a generation of boys that it's ok to live in mom's basement, subsist on Pizza and call your girlfriend 'dude'.  \n     I for one still do not swear in front of my grandparents, or older aunts and uncles.  It feels good, respectful not to.  I don't want a girlfriend who is ok with me calling her dude, belching or farting around her, because she deserves to not be treated like one of my high fiving jackass mates.  \n\nOFcourse, not swearing doesn't make me think I am better than anyone, or judging anyone.  Just a really good topic this, Miss Hartridge, and it sparked my old debate brain.
Out of curiosity.Would you have listened,if anyone told you all this when you were young?\nBtw how bout making a 10 movies that made an everlasting impression/impacted you.Either in your youth or as an adult .Or both
You end shows with the pyjamas dance!
Even if current you had access to a time machine and went back in time to visit your younger teenage self to give advice. Your teenage self wouldn't believe anything you had to say.
I wasn't listening but you look fecking great ;)
you should stop saying I don't know how to end shows, it was bye.  No more doubts, A phrase that came from St. Pete.  Use it.  Have faith, You got atleast one sweet pete, and what was it, three arrows or something, so I say sit back, have a popcorn, put in a movie, and...Reach for the stars/surrender yourself to good times.  I have not a clue what to say.  I usually am quite thorough, I thought you looked amazing, btw.  I was hoping for a classic 10 reasons why, with the numbers and everything.  Thank you for answering my wish.  You are as adorable as the day I met you.  As Gandalf said to Bilbo in Lord of the Rings,  you haven't aged a day   So to all your smoothies, and tisanes,  Whole foods, and fine wines, free from fear over here is forwarding you thins message: keep it up.  Thin like slim but differen.  OD on Dissos and you will meet gOD.  Disso you know I reserved a time with you and my divine disco enferno to us finally unwind and fill up on magic mind and know how to rhyme.  Behind the frying pan is a man with a plan to stand at ease please just release your energy on me, she is queen on the boobtube I mean youtube it was something about boobs how we crossed paths, who knew, you drew me in and then I had a thing, 5 year anniversary approaching.  How do you want to celebrate.  A bottle of merlot, a candle, and filtered lighting, a gentle breeze, a phat bowl of eMeXPay, ouch he makes you pay is what I'm hearing.  Will you come to my hearing.  Hear how I plowed down a mad clown.  Mushroom Mushroom we all fall down.  Ok you love my lies, like me less when I'm committing adultery and kinda of feel this is getting salty.  Salvage things like I love you and you're so gosh darn pretty.  Ok I'm going to cash in this crop of wurm castings(English)and make out with my arm or something.  You have a heart.  I know. Bye. :)
Just be glad you didn't grow up in China. College exams are the BE ALL and END ALL.
Why not end your shows with your beautiful wink?
It's quite obvious how much you've changed/grown in what seems like no time at all. Couldn't agree more with you being stronger, happier and more independent. I'm very happy for you. Enjoyed the video.    S.A. and Til Next Time       :  )
Great video, you are beautiful.
The password thing is a definite. I always forget those damned things.
I've good teeth genes and I'm ambidextrous [my hands, just my hands, and really just my hands]
one thing about and one of the main reasons i watch i can tell that you dont think your better than any one eles green eyes
I can relate a 100 %
The braces one is SPOT ON 😂 fuck my life.
Emily, I Love your everything, but you look bad your eyes and neck look very bad like you have been up for days and days. I think that the one thing you did not say was You might want a friend for life and you might think he/she is that friend, but if you ask them they will say WHO like you are the last person they think about
Hello Emily. How are you today?
Thanks , going to discuss with my teenage daughter !
I agree with all of this! :)
I like the plant with lights by the bed. Nice touch. I could sleep there i think.
Emily : You are Perfect the Way You Are !
This is really important! Thanks for the vid, Emily
I wish I'd of been told no matter how much training you have or things know. People don't care unless you kiss their ass about the fact they know less then you.
Lots of people have that lower twisted tooth, including myself and Bobby DiNero, so you're in good company. Your advise is well taken for the youngsters to keep their retainers in at night but as far is you are concerned, chalk it up to a distinctive character trait. I think you look better now than ever especially with that 50 Amp smile.  Also a long time ago a friend gave me some really good advise. She said  Don't wast time with people who don't like you. That little piece of advise really made things lots easier.
Wish I knew that being twenty doesn't make my life put together neither makes me an adult. Smh*
Emily,\nI'm glad you're on Youtube and not on TV. On TV they'd just try to control and censor the way you act.\nOn Youtube, you can just be yourself.
I just like watching you talk. O_o good stuff tho, makes sense.
Only a shallow fool would care about your bottom teeth, Emily.
Booooooooooooon-JOUR! Comme ca!
I needed this..thanks, Em!
Really great talk.
Great video Em!
Good advice

Don't know y Ur amazing videos r getting very less views
could be a classic
Shane is going to beat an inch of Owens life Owens is finished in 3 weeks no place to run to place to hide 3 weeks KO You will pay for your actions I promise
for real if they dont have owens go over ina brutal dominate fashion that should put kevin back in the wwe title picture then wwe is truly dead
How much you wanna bet that they're gonna reinforce the Cell AGAIN?
Get ready for some big jump at Hell in the Cell from Shane, because his ring ability is taking a leap of faith which obviously always makes the highlight.
a terrible promo performance. no emotion behind it, was just like reading a script. way to not believe in your own product McMahons
You made Kevin do it Shane. Do to your father you made him the heel you had to put your innocent father in this and your sister Stephanie they turned out to be you Shane, just like all of these WWE Universe people they turned to be you Shane, I see Shane everywhere I go to, Every place I see Shane the Devil From the transcendent of heaven Kevin angel descending to battle the devil that is you Shane. See you in hell Shane. Shane, people like Kevin can't go to Hell no, no. They go to heaven like the good angels does.
Shane always delivers something huge, puts his body out there to be destroyed, I'll never forget that summerslam jump.
what happened to his indefinite suspension
shane said in the beginning when he came to wwe that more new guys will get their chance, but they are always highlighting aj style, ko, randy. and he throws himself in every ppv matches
When the roster is so bad Shane McMahon has to return to the ring
Welcome back Shane you know it's time to bring the pain
Just shame Shane can't call on the devils favourite demon the big red monster Kane to help out just a little lol
i like you Shane and i hope u do! i just can't  stand ko.
Don't cross the boss!
I'm hoping this feud builds to a Daniel Bryan return... Like, Shane loses, KO continues to beat him, DB comes in to rescue, build tension for a few months as KO becomes world champion again, then DB comes back at the Royal Rumble and wins it, leading to Daniel Bryan vs. Kevin Owens at Wrestlemania.\n\nThat is, of course, if the rumors of him trying to rehab is true.
brock lesnar is the beast will beat john cena , roman regins,triple hhh, theundertaker
Hell In A Cell Hahaha . You got it Kevin Owens.
Wow, that's shane? I remember the days when he was a youngster in a black tracksuit lol
He looks very old and fat now
Shane looking at no fans on that side of the arena it's empty
Y fight when u can just fire him
It's all fake. Fools
Evil qur’aan (Proof in desc. and comments) ripping and my advice, if I am slaughtered! Like and RT\nhttps://youtu.be/szZTiavY-6A \nMany muslims are in delusion and they think they will get eternal pleasure for following falsehood!\n\nIf you are to evil to realise the evil nature of Islam there is nothing I can do! \n\nThe most powerful creator will exercise justice to those who are evil!
Plz do us a favor @Shane McMahon dont dive off the cell again🙄🙄🙄
Ko if you win or lose you fired
Like HHH said this is good for business.
Does Shane know what Kevin did to his father
Who are the story writers on wwe they are making boring story lines
0:16 \n\nHow would that make you feel?\n\nKevin: I fe---\n\nIt doesn't matter what makes you feel.
Anyone think this could MAYBE lead to HHH v. Owens down the line?
Never mess with a McMahon, never turns out well for you.
Good promo by Shane. I hope he colors up KO in Hell in the Cell.
It was good to see Shane McMahon live. I was there last night. He didn't greet the city of Oakland CA that just shows he's serious now. I can't wait for Hell In A Cell
I want to Dean Ambrose or Roman regins or Seth Rollins to fight  Shane McMahon
No Mercy on my birthday :D
Shane is too damn old for this
It's so rare that I see the crowd go silent.
They could make this way more exciting
Let Triple H do it he would beat the hell out of Kevin Owens
Undertaker pulls Shane down under the ring, Shane is gone for a few weeks with the lights going out every time Owens has a match and next ppv the corporate ministry makes its return.
Shane McMahon Vs Kevin Owens At No Mercy Do IT
It's called wwe Shane, The word wrestling is in wwe. If you didn't want your kids to see it why you let them when they already knew the script duhh
When Shane said he was going to Dem him did he mean dm
Shane gotta be one of the best guys in wwe right now\nHe always puts on a fight with great wrestlers and do an incredible job on thoose matches
Lost to undertaker lost to AJ styles y'all think about this
I can't wait...but knowing the current WWE, this match won't be all that great
Isn't it crazy that Shane has 3 sons and Stephanie has 3 daughters
They had Kevin Owens never even come out?
Smackdown is so wack compared to raw
You know the show is bad when the only way to get good ratings is to have the boss fight
What about all those times Austin and Rock beat up the McMahons?
Calling it now.. triple H will come out and pedigree Shane
I love shane but owens wins 😥
If Owens wins, I stop watching.
This match better be good if  not this storyline is trash.
What is Shane looking at?? There are no people in the sections of the arena he is looking at
They do this so Shane can jump off stuff
Am i the only one who got chills throughout all the time Shane was talking?Like,you can see it right in his eyes that he's not joking anymore..
Didn't he himself order people to beat down McMahon on multiple times?
Oh NOW !!! Shane decides : daddy i love now because someone attacked you and i have to care about you now ,and your going to see jump off a cell again and pretand that we have a father -son bond😌😭 .........hhhhhh dude last year you said that you wished that your not his son and you said that you are ashamed
Now I think the only think left is Chris Jericho if he returns on hell in a cell I would be so excited for the smackdown after hell in a cell I am missing Jericho and his list
how much u wanna bet shane jumps of HITC
McMahon's will strike out with massive vengeance! Ha lol you definitely do! Look what you guys did to CM punk
Who threw a pie in Kevin Owens face .....
Anyone ever thought of a KO vs HHH possibility if Shane was still suspended?
Shane was totally Jules in this segment! he's gonna murder Owens....
Jajajajjaj no entiendo
yall watch wwe? oboy
HELL IN A CEEELLL!!!
Smack That ))
Shane DESTROY him
Stone cold Kevin Owens
a cell shane, a cell
>Shane promises to take Owens to hell\nYou said that about taker and look what happen

Shane McMahon is awesome
I love you Shane Mcmahon. But you dont even believe what you are saying. Kevin Owens will not be a known name in 10 years from now. And its expressed in your promo for your rivalry here. You are so humble to grant Kevin Owens your spotlight.\nYou guys might be pushing him, but there is no reason for it, and I see here that you believe that too.
At the end I could here the sickness in your voice😂😂sorry just had to say it but I love you❤️
You better have got that guys number who sang to you gabbie!
You're very beautiful! And we have the same tshirt! ❤❤

YouTube have demonetised this video (boo!) but you can still support me by buying me a coffee! https://ko-fi.com/A1814A5T
It's actually really helpful that you speak so clearly! I'm autistic and have APD (auditory processing disorder) and while I technically have perfect hearing, my brain does not know how to translate sounds correctly.\nSo I have a lot of trouble understanding spoken language, but I can understand you almost perfectly fine, which is very rare for me. You're great!
I´d wish that all english native speakers would pronounce *that* clearly ;-) being a german viewer of your channel I can honestly say it´s a real pleasure to listen to you <3
Boo for demonetization! I know I sound very deaf, and my voice is very low so even on my good days people have a hard time understanding me. So I simply don't bother! Maybe it could be fun for you two to take a class together to learn sign? I mean, I know you already know most of the signs but it might help Claudia learn better ;P
Fascinating!!! I didn't realise there were TWO British sign languages! 😲😅 Loved learning about the structural differences behind both though. I guess there are so many sign languages because they develop as organically as any other language does. Although after a quick Google search; we currently have 6909 languages in the world...so maybe 300 isn't too bad! 😂\n\nFor teaching Claudia, I think using sign language as much as you can when speaking to her would be helpful. I noticed that for me (even though I can't sign) through sheer repetitiveness from watching the TV show Switched at Birth (which I mentioned in one of your previous videos), I found myself picking up the signs and associating them with their correct words automatically (ASL though 😜). \nOn Claudia's end, she should first try signing a few words here and there in her sentences as opposed to trying to get her whole sentence signed correctly right off the bat (which will just lead to a lot of frustration). Think words like: bathroom, kettle etc. and eventually she will pick up more associative words and go from speaking like a child to an eloquent adult in no time. \nPersonally, I'm bilingual (English and French) and I understand but I'm too embarrassed to speak (Spanish and Italian) because I'm still at that speaking like a child stage, but practice makes perfect! 💪😤
I'm learning so much!! Thank you for explaining all of this. This is the first video of yours I've seen and I really enjoyed it! You're so so charming and entertaining.
I love all your videos!!
I learned a lot from this actually! Thank you so much for posting. And just so you know, your voice is very very beautiful.
Hi Jess, in a way your similar to my mum, in that she spoke for a long time before she lost her hearing in her 30's. It must be hard word to practise and I never really thought about it that way. I've just started making cooking videos with my own hand written captions, I try to film so I'm not blocking what I'm doing with the captions. If you have a moment would you have a look please and let me know what you think and how I could improve my videos for the community?
You're such an amazing and empowered woman, I love to watch you shine! Also I loved these videos on deafness, they were very honest and informative. Here where I live the sign language has a structure similar to BSL, so it was pretty interesting learning about SSE, I didn't know it existed.
Can you make Claudia a series of videos kiss for her to learn from?
I loved all your videos this week! I’m actually hard of hearing and my dad is going deaf due to his cancer..so this week I’m starting ASL classes, I know some ASL but like you I use SSE because I honestly just find the syntax of ASL to be confusing. For example, you mentioned in BSL you would say “name you what?” In ASL it would be “you name what?” Granted, I do speak french but I’m already used to English sentence structure so it just is easier for me.
I didn't know the difference between BSL and SSE, thanks for that! I'm trying to learn sign language at the moment but if I try to watch a video with vocab I feel myself switching off. Something Special (the CBeebies show) taught me a bit as a teenager and I like watching interpretations of songs so I've loaded up your playlist of signed songs to get me started!
Your such an inspiration
You have a beautiful accent. It matches your clothes. (I don't know what that means). But it does.
Haha a teach Claudia SL video is in order
do a video teaching Claudia SSE!!
While in Las Vegas Nevada recently I noticed that most shows (burlesque and variety) now offer a sign language interpreter. All you need do is let them know 4 hours (minimum and 24 is best) before the show you are going to see. Also great video!
Love learning about all this!\nOur (America) sign language is ASL (American Sign Language, lol). I know the alphabet and a few words, but not many. I have no idea how to structure sentences...\n\nSSE makes some more sense to me. Like, if I'm trying to use ASL, I do tend to just put the sentence in the same order I speak it. SSE seems like it'd be nice and straight forward that way.\nDo you know if America uses SSE at all or if they have an equivalent?\n\nAlso, I read (a while back) that the reason there are so many different sign languages is because it was 'illegal' to teach any sort of signing languagr to deaf people. (Not sure if actually illegal, or just frowned on by society.) So little groups of deaf people would create ways to communicate with each other, organically. Then, when actual deaf communities (schools, etc) started popping up, they started becoming actual languages as more and more people would be communicating and they needed to do more than sign one word at a time. It was interesting to read about, and I wish I could remember all the details.
Your voice is amazing. I have trouble sleeping and when I'm really stressed and just need a sleep, I put your videos in the background and your voice 'soothes' me and lulls me to sleep. I throughly believe you should do audio books. Except maybe not the ones with the Irish accent......... Xxxxxx Xxxxxxxxx
One of the fun ways I learnt sign in my Auslan classes was with certain games. Like I can remember at one point there was a lockdown and we had to hide against a wall of the classroom and not speak, but being a sign language class, we could all kind of communicate with one another, so we played I Spy in Auslan. So that might be a fun way to get her to learn colours perhaps?
When I first started watching your videos I got hella confused because I'd be watching you sign and understand it and then you'd use a sign thats different to what we use in New Zealand and I was like why is it so similar??? because it was just similar enough for me to be I know whats going on and get complacent. It turns out British, New Zealand and Australian signs are considered part of the same dialect because they were created together and influenced each other, yay Commonwealth countries.
I'm learning through song! Music creates memories different parts of the brain, more long term so it's great for learning and revising. Look up Wayne Barrow - he's trying to get bsl taught in schools so to raise awareness he SSE signs music and songs and goes through some of them slowly so you can learn along with the Lizzy Jay who is there with him and only knows the basics
In fact, your English is so clear that is very easy to understand for someone like me who is trying to learn English, me and my family use your videos to practice listening :)
Hi Jessica, love your videos! You are quite possibly the most adorable person on YouTube 😊 x
This video explained so much! I first found your videos because (as a hearing person who doesn't know how to sign but is interested in the topic) I wanted to see how BSL was different from ASL, and I thought, Oh, here's a British YouTuber who sometimes signs—this'll show me! And I was kind of confused for a while by the syntax, sentence structure, etc., because they seemed very much like spoken English. So your explanation about the difference between BSL and SSE made a lightbulb go off above my head. Thank you for explaining the difference so clearly!\n\nI love your videos and wanted to also thank you for raising awareness for the International Week of the Deaf. I didn't even know that it was happening until I saw you mention it (almost a week ago now), but because you alerted me to it I've been telling other people about it—both on Twitter and such but also in the real world—to raise awareness. So thank you for raising awareness, which then inspires other people to raise awareness ... in a lovely ripple effect.
I know American Sign Language and it's sooooo different from BSL! Watching you sign your version of SSE is so interesting to me because some signs are similar and then others are just like ???????  Haha!
Honestly your Irish accent wasn't half bad
I’m a hearie from America but I’m self learning ASL signs and use it as SSE here. I learn by watching people sign songs and it helps me learn signs. That way if I can’t remember a specific word I might remember the “song lyric sentence” and it helps me recall. Always a pleasure to watch your videos. Much love
Interesting. I’ve always thought and been told that it’s ‘your name what’ in BSL, as opposed to ‘name you what’. Either way, sign language grammar is certainly weird/interesting!
I wouldn't say slurred, it's more that the sound of consonants is muted/lost. My best friend in high school was deaf and her explanation was that if you can't see a sound being made and you can't hear you have no way to know, for example, if it's a P or a B (or What the difference between those is), or how sharp something is 'meant' to sound. She was brought up in a mainstream school despite being almost completely deaf after the age of 8 and they refused to teach her BSL. Why we don't teach sign language instead of 7 years of French and Spanish is beyond me.
I was told I was HOH as a child, haven't had it checked since but I know I struggle with hearing and understanding. I had NO IDEA International Week of the Deaf was a thing!!!
Thanks for the explanation about SSE and BSL, I've been learning BSL for a while now, but had no clue about SSE and was constantly confused about how you speak and sign at the same time even though the structure in BSL is sooo different, but now I know you use SSE. It's cool they use same signs though, so you can talk to people using either and understand each other (the sentence structure doesn't really bother me as I already speak 3 other languages and the structure is different in every one of them haha). love your videos, x
Hiya, thank you for making these videos, they've been incredibly informative and enjoyable to watch.\n\nI'm in the process of learning BSL myself and personally I think it's easier to learn if you can make it fun somehow and turn the learning into games. Categories help too, I find it harder to retain signs if they're random and have no connection.\n\nAnd also, as much as I hate to admit it, being persistent. Can Claudia read fingerspelling well? Perhaps use signs here and there daily and if she cannot  remember the sign, perhaps fingerspell it instead? Hope all goes well, I wish you both the best of luck and if I think of any more ideas, I'll share them :)
You are the most interesting, engaging and informative person, i can't stop watching your videos. Sorry that youtube is being an asshole.
I relate so much to this. Since I am losing my hearing I struggle with the BSL sentence structure and feel more comfortable using SSE. Another wonderful video Jessica :)
Wow, it's really interesting that BSL has a different grammar for signing. I didn't realise how different sign languages could be. Also, eyebrows on point!
Maybe Claudia should try taking a class? That way she'd be with other beginners (so it's less pressure to learn without mistakes - I know The Fear and that's a good way to get over it) and she could surprise you one day with being able to sign to you! (: \n\n(I'd also maybe like a video where you teach her a few signs, or a sentence? That would be really cool, I think.)
Super interesting as always 🌼 That's the Irish accent of a leprechaun ... begorra so it tis like ... but you did it perfectly💚 If you ever get talking to a leprechaun don't forget to catch hold of him cos you know what happens then right ... 🌈
I so greatly appreciate that you caption your videos! I am hearing, but because of EDS am slowly losing my hearing. Having captions is so, so, helpful!!!
Watched this with my younger sister who’s never seen any of your videos and her first comment about five seconds into the video was how see thinks you look like one of those classic pop art girls and honestly, I kind of see it. Thanks for great video :)
I was struggling with learning how BSL structure works, but you've put it so simply - thank you!
Dose she use BSL
You could make you teaching claudia sign language into a video :)
Floof doin a growl
Love u.. \n😘 😘 😘 😘 😘 😘 😘
If you are going to teach Claudia sign language. I think You should first figure out if she is a verbal or visual learner, or she may be both. So Than get books or videos to help teach her.
Can SSE work with ASL signs too? If anyone knows
Yay a makaton mention :)\nI use a mix between Makaton and BSL/SSE because I learnt some BSL but my coordination makes it very difficult to be precise and my hands can run away with things and start their own signs so I prefer the freedom of Makaton but I try to add BSL signs to my vocabulary where I can. I'd love to learn the grammar but there seem to be so few british signers on youtube.
Peace and love to everybody listening to this wonderful song <3 Can't wait to hear the whole album <3
Hmm, Morrissey, not his best lyrics, but this makes me think that there is something to the simplicity, that the matter of fact means something really important to him. I think my 8 year old niece could have written this but hey who cares, it's Morrissey. No bus no train Where have Morrissey's brains gone. No bus, no train, Morrissey travels by plane. Okay
And now my 2017 is blessed by Morrissey's comeback <3
I'm not my type but ... 💝
2 MONTHS FOR THIS ALBUM? FUCK
Love the political message
I love it!! Thank you Morrissey
Better stop watching TV in general .
I know morrissey loves to bitch about life and politics but I totally thought this was gonna be about bed but it took a turn ._.
Take out the 'as the workers stay enslaved' line and I'm basically on board with this single. Maybe also the 'highway, freeway, motorway' bit, I mean, what was he thinking there, y'know?
The MetroSexuals love you Morrissey. You're our idol. 💚
The moment when you're in bed reading the comments section...
Just keeps getting worse. Always, expectations, dashed. Lyrics are good and fine but band can't gash a melody to save its ass.
Having Morrissey being discovered at this time of my life. I'm blown away!
In my head I just spent the day in bed was good one cheers mozza
Heard it first thing this morning and if this is anything like what the new album is going to be like,well we are in for a treat,great single welcome back moz we missed you!
Not much of a risk for Moz here, kind of nice and neat and accommodating, like the World Peace Album. Nothing less, but also nothing more. Already starting to sound like his own Morrissey-Sing-a-like-impersonator, lacking the old grit in creating great lyrics. Though I have to admit: ''Pillows like Pillars'' is still a reminiscence to the old texting-craft of his.
Not normally a Morrissey fan but really quite like this single.Lyrics are simple but good.
Morrisseys lyrics are  the story of my life
I wish Alain Whyte would come back!
THAT KID IS HOLDING AN AXE!!!!
I spent the day in bed and when I'm lying in my bed I think about life and I think about death and neither one particularly appeal to me
I stayed in bed while the workers remained enslaved \ncunt lyrics over some hackeyened organ riff out of the '70s.\nYet people will act like this is poignant, when it's really Morrissey throwing together a bunch of lines he scribbled in a notebook together.\n\nHe goes from talking about staying in bed, to about how the news sucks. There's not even any coherency, it's basically a old, whiny, white british guy ranting. You could put a backbeat behind some guy on his porch and get a similar effect.
Do you like my cover of this song? :D http://bit.ly/2wP20EM
Good song, nice lyric. but, im at office :(
Bloody genius!! Actually the best Mozzy song I've ever heard.....!!
Not a bad little tune. You know who would make it better? Johnny Marr. Those two could make beautiful music together.
The years wash away. This is 90s era Morrissey. Lovely!
This is great, normally when I spend the day in bed I put on the entire discography of the Smith's. It would be nice to run into Morrissey to chit chat about nothing and the things we hate.
the queen is not dead
This is everything The Smiths were not.\n\nWhich is why it sucks.
Love the subtle electronic tinge to it
Give up WORK as a bad mistake, moz is now telling us to take control of our destiny, he always has. I love the image as well, go on son , off with their bleeding heads, moz the king of the misanthropes, ;) LOVE HIM FOREVER
Listening to it in my bed
Great lyrics! Fighting idiocy one song at a time. Keep on delivering the goods, Moz! This filthy world still needs ya!
Funky and superb Morrissey!
Brilliant
Yeah, I like it! If this is a taste of the album to come then roll on release date!
Bloody great! <3
im not my type but i love my bed
The Great Man Returns
and please, Moz, come back to ITALY!!!!
We love you, Stephen Patrick Morrissey.
Gets better with every listen. The little organ touches are almost 70s   funk
How do you pay the rent if you spend the day in bed..i suppose one day is possible...
Spent the day in bed\nI love my bed\nAnd I recommend that you stop hearing this piece of crap...\nNow, toss million pounds to my pocket, you idiots !
Thankfully we still have two living gods. Robbie Fowler and Morrissey xx
Just wow. He's captured the zeitgeist brilliantly. Wonder whose playing the keys. Stunning work.
Brilliant single. Should be a brilliant album https://twitter.com/JohnSemenowicz
i love you and i don't love anybody.
He did so much better....
no bus,no boss. im off work today
Seems simple.  Is not.  Very clever.
Time Do As I Wish
I spent the day in bed very happy i did yes i spent the day in bed as the workers stay Enslayed im not my type but i love my bed and i reccomend that you stop watching the news because the news contrives to frighten you to make you small and alone to make you feel your mind isnt your own i spent the day in bed its a consulation when all my dreams are perfectley Legal in sheets which i paid i am now laid and i reccomend to all of my friends　that they stop watching the news because the news contrives to frighten you to make you feel small and alone to make you feel your mind isnt your own Time do i wish Time do i wish 　time do i wish time do i wish spent the day in bed you can please yourself but i love my bed pillows like pillars life ends in death so theirs nothing wrong being good to yourself be good to yourself for once no bus no boss no rain no train no bus no boss no rain no train no bus no boss no rain no train no Emasculation no castration no highway no freeway no motorway no bus no boss no rain no train
YEAH FUCK COFFEE SPEND THE DAY IN BED
This will be a hit on KROQ.
President Trump would approve of this song.
The best thing YT could've ever recommended
Classic Morrissey : that voice : pure quality all the way . He is a glorious human being indeed !
Musically its pretty cool. I can't help but miss the poetic and melancholy Moz though. The cynical and blunt Moz doesn't really do anything for me. Most of his songs that take on politics or  'the system' (America Is Not the World, World Peace and this one) come across slightly superficial and condescending to my ears. \n\nHopefully there's some corkers on the new album. The last one was enjoyable, although it was the first time in his solo career that the music outshone his lyrics.
Morrissey is getting better and better ! Gotta also love his anti government views
I dunno... but, I'm really fucking digging it. It's like reggae the Smiths.
His solo stuff peaked with Vauxhall and I. \nIts ok but just...ok
I wasn't expecting this single to sound like this 👍 It's pretty good
Great and a strong message.
What an evil, hook -filled piece of genius.
The Doogie Howser keyboards made me laugh
Yes Morrisey!
Awesome tune if I cared.......... ;)
Beautifully woven from the eternal wondrous rebirthing grey matter of Morrissey, adored <3
slayyy
Great song mozza
Excellent
Corny
Superb!
Genial
Narcos brought me here!
sounds like Noel Gallagher
fan boys forever bumming morrissey
I love Morrissey
Une voix aérienne qui nous marque à jamais
Brilliant! Love Morrisey...real
Really like it
El Mozz siempre sorprende con algo nuevo. Me reencanta esta nueva canción. Radiable. Saludos desde Perú...
so very good
Electrified Morrissey?!!!!
rubbish
Love my cover daz
Yikes
As Perfect as MORRISSEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Millenials anthem
Very bad
No bus, no patrón, no rain, no train
The Moz come back en grande forme
586 views are mine!
È tornato il maestro.  Please stand up
'(I Can Afford to Have) Spent the Day in Bed' would be a better title for such an out-of-touch message in song. Has Morrissey not considered that the 'enslaved workers' he speaks of don't have the option of quitting their jobs and idling neath a duvet?\nThis man's lyrics and his observations, in song at least, used to be on-the-nail and relatable - excluding Bengali in Platforms, Asian Rut and Best Friend on the Payroll - and were last heard on America is Not the World and The World is Full of Crashing Bores (and he must be one).
Average Moz. Nothin' new. Last album was terrible, fingers crossed he sorts this one.
Yes goyim. Just keep sleeping.
This video reminds me of One Thing ❤😭
OMG, if i didnt know better, they look like brothers. twinning out the city. they're both cuteeeeeee with their beards
Laim hit the high note in the end part! It's so cool..
They look the same
I wonder what Lil Jon and The Eastside Boyz think of this song title and chorus...
Where are my dancers hot dogs??
so fun... all the best..
love zedd .. love all his song.. make me crazy :-D
I fallin in love for Zedd
Girls make this video
one of the girls looks the same as form ed sheeran shape of you...... >_>

Love this song to much

Dance Music : A song that makes you dance. This is it.
A great collab tween Liam & His Royal Zeddness :-) Looks they both had a lot fun filming this...
But did anyone hear Zayn’s really high part from “You and I” at 3:30 in the background?
His voice reminds me of Adam Levine

What a retarded lyric be alone together sounds way too toxic for someone who has no jezebel spirit in them
I really enjoy Avicii, but this song isn't what I'm looking for.
Why you released this single at the end of the summer :( it could be one of the biggest hits of the summer :]
❤️ One word = Love x
The ending made me sad... so i listened to it again and ended up replaying it for two hours while working.
clicked so fast when i read ft. Rita Ora <3
It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle\nI cut the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend\nIt's my head or my heart and I'm caught in the middle\n\nMy hands are tied, but not tied enough\nYou're the high that I can't give up\nOh lord, here we go\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\nAt the bottom of a bottle\nYou're the poison in the wine\nAnd I know\nI can't change you and I\nI won't change\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\nLet's be lonely together\nA little less lonely together\n\nEyes wide shut and it feels like the first time\nBefore the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends\nNow I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\nAt the bottom of a bottle\nYou're the poison in the wine\nAnd I know\nI can't change you, and I\nI won't change\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\nLet's be lonely together\nA little less lonely together\nLet's be lonely together\nA little less lonely together\n\nMy hands are tied, but not tied enough\nYou're the high that I can't give up\nOh lord, here we go\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\nAt the bottom of a bottle\nYou're the poison in the wine\nAnd I know\nI can't change you, and I\nI won't change\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\nLet's be lonely together\nA little less lonely together\nLet's be lonely together\nA little less lonely together\nA little less lonely now\nA little less lonely now\nA little less lonely now
Dislikers just wants to be unique
LETTTSSS BE ALOOONEE TOGETHER\nLETTTSSS STAY YOUNG FOREVER\n\n..sorry it came to mind

Do you even Gay bhoi?
THANK GOD HE LEFT BUZZFEED
News flash.... don't mix dark liquor and hallucinogenics. Problem solved
Well... That was unexpected.. M. Night should take notes.
Oh. My. Gawd! The production value on this thing is unreal! It's a legit movie.... he should win some kind of something for this...he's so talented! This is hilarious AND looks amazing
Watching this a second time gives me such a different perspective
Chris should go on talk shows or something to boost his subscriber numbers. He's so friggin good and I live for these videos, I wish he had more support
This shit blew my mind omg good job chris
SH SH SH SH SH SH\n*SHUT THE FUCK UP*
This is awesome!! Great work!!!!
OH SHIT WHAT A TWEEST
wut
It's so fukked up
So many fucking plot twists in a video. This is a fucking 10/10. Great fucking job . Best thing that happened to Chris was leaving buzzfeed
This was weird ... but cool!
YOOOO THIS WAS SO GOOD. That twist thooo
Well... This got dark
i fucking love your videos man !! inoticed you dont publish content that offen but when you do its a whole trip!!
That fucked me up man great video
haha\nnice chris\nwas fun last time seeing u at buzz\ni would love to see your new videos weekly
WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS\nTHIS IS AMAZING
this channel is so clever how does he not have more subs?
Im going to start needing to emotionally prepare myself before watching Chris videos XD
Calling it now. Chris Reinacher is the Millenial answer to David Lynch.
That was so fucking good!  What?!?!?!!!
For some strange reason the straight one looks gay and the gay one straight to me.\n\n\n\nEdit : OMG i didn't even see the end!! I'm shooocked
But why is it when the plot twist occurs the main character starts talking like a gay stereotype? And starts gesturing flamboyantly to show how communicating with crazy hand movements is intrinsically gay? Everything else was good, but the gay character  representation at the end is kind of offensive. I thought we moved past the effeminate gay tropes.
This was really smart
This is like a gay version of fight club
holy SHIT I LOVED THIS
Im so fucking confused. Can someone please explain the jist of this to me?
So I did see that coming, but you came at it from a different angle than I expected - well played and excellently produced as usual :)
NO.. \nNOOOO \nthis is too much\nthis ruined my evening \ngoddammit..
Omg this was absolutely amazing. If I wasn't a fan before, I'm definitely one now!
If your girlfriend has a gay friend, then dump her ass cause she's blowing someone else
Oh, and you're a ghost. 😂
normalizing the type of shit murder suicides happen over!
87k views is not trending. How much did you pay YouTube
Doesnt she say have a good gayte at the beginning ? I thought it all at the beginning
I'd like to eat your girlfriend's pussy out.
Oh! and you are a ghost... That makes sense!
I had to pause the video after she said he was the gay friend cause it was too painful for me to process that. 😭😂
Nobody can come between me and my fag hag.
my goodness! how do you even come up with this stuff! <3 fav
so glad you broke off and did your own thing, this content is AMAZING, I love the creativity <3 keep it coming
Fantastic! This was cool and creative. More of this on youtube!
EASILY my favorite video this WEEK!\nLMAO
Dude, make a movie.  Please,  for all of us
Hey Chris, just wondering if you'd ever think to release a behind the scenes video for this? I love the editing and vfx as I am currently a first year Screen Prod student; always looking to pick up some inspo wherever I can!! Cheers
I love it but when she said that mike was her boyfriend and Chris is her gay friend it was so unexpected!!
This is actually good😂😂
I'll just pretend that I didn't see this. \n\nYou can actually visit: www.thenobleblog.com\n\nIt has some great news about the latest gadgets
WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH! 😂😂😂😂😂
Wait, is this what gay friends are supposed to be like? Because almost all of my best friends are girls and I don't act like this at all.
THIS MADE NO SENSE IT CONFUSES MY MIND AAA\n\nEdit: Wow watching it a second time really changes things.
He's the gay friend and a ghost coming this fall to fox
that was the fastest 7 minutes of my life
after watching this I gotta wonder... am I the gay friend???
This is messed up man. How am I suppose to go to bed now?
Ohhhhh mmyyyy gaaaaaaaaassshhhhh
Shit
haha
Oh... my... god...
Got me hooked man!!
@4:41 \n*me.exe has stopped working*

What is this omg
https://www.openbible.info/topics/homosexuality\n\n\nhttps://www.openbible.info/topics/fornication\n\n\nActs 2:3838 Peter said to them, “Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. \n\n\nRomans 8:5-65 For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 6 For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace\n\nRomans 10:8-178 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart”—that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, 9 [a]that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; 10 for with the heart a person believes, [b]resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, [c]resulting in salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in Him will not be [d]disappointed.” 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; 13 for “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”14 How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? 15 How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who [e]bring good news of good things!”16 However, they did not all heed the [f]good news; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” 17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word [g]of Christ.
Awww you are so sweet xx  Loved meeting you both and real talking about home births and YouTube stories :)
New York is my dream!!! You are so lucky!!! But Lily please don't cut pasta!!! ahahaha xoxo from Italy
Lily... YOU HAVE TO STOP with the whole '...I'm not as cool them'... because you are! You are so cool and unique and so beautiful! :)
love the women uplifting each other, girls supporting girls!!
OMG loved this vlog!! (You didn't seriously cut your pasta with a fork and knife?! Italian viewer here 🙋🏽lol). Apart from that, it was lovely!
Hi Lily! Love the video! It was really wonderful to meet you on that lovely De Maria evening. I was wondering if you could give me credit for the illustrations. My handle is @pauline_de_roussy_de_sales \nThank you!\nBe Well\nxo\nPauline
Oh coooool! I totally understand that you loved @madametamtam. She is definitely one of my favorite German YouTubers. Such a stunning lady!
it seems so cool to be a blogger!!
I'm visiting NYC now and it's 30C today! And just a few weeks ago you wore a jumper here....so jealous.
Did that glass container give you lids for the lipsticks.... it concerns we that they may dry out otherwise.
Broody Anna
Wow that clip of you in the floral blouse with the pink lips (unsure if purposely) def Lisa Eldridge vibes. Gorgeous look.
I love this! I got so excited that you guys met Geneva! All three of you are mega girl crushes ive had fr the longest time, fabulous ladies!
Omg so jealous of all the gifts and also really glad you shared them them all as I am sooo nosey!! This looked like a great trip.
This dress is amazing ,just like you.Great vibe!Love you.Kisses from Santorini ♥️
I love the curtains and the bed head in your hotel room: so cute and pretty.
whats the name of the song playing 4:52?
How fun! I want to go to NYC so badly. I live in the States but never have been. TFS. Those lipsticks look nice.
I just love your videos. The dresses you and Anna wore were just beautiful. What a wonderful trip with Bobbi Brown.
You ladies are my no.1 crush! 💄💋
Hi lily ! Btw .. The gurl ur talking about in happilyevaafter blog is Susan sarandon's daughter 🤓 \nLove blogs !!
Totally in love with this vlog, :)Xx
Not sure if u know but Eva is Susan Sarandon's daughter 😲...... I know she looked familiar😄
holy fuck jenna lyons\ntell me she was the best ever
Nice video i like its creation\nplease subscribe my channel\nhttps://youtu.be/qk-ekQuK2Gk
I've been following Geneva for YEARS! I first followed her (almost 7 years ago!?) bc it was so hard to find a HK-based blogger. I'm from HK and living in Sydney now so every time I see her Instagram/blog posts it makes me feel a bit closer to home x
I don't usually comment on videos (or watch ads) but this was beautifully executed and you seem so happy. Such a pleasure to watch ♥️
Bobbi Brown tests on animals...so not really interesting for me :/
LOVED THIS VLOG SO MUCH!! Xx
Watch  my first  vides
The straight person's concept of girlcrush is confusing to me, as someone who legitimately has crushes on girls lmao
Loved the vlog! X
NICE!!
Oh my goodness. Jenna Lyons!!! She revitalized J Crew. I wish she was still with them.
Had my daughter's bat mitzvah at that hotel. It's a wonderful, little gem here!
ah Lily!! you always make me smile!!!
Your hair looks STUNNING in this video! Xx
Of course Anna is your girl crush, and the two of you are my girl crushes!
I've been looking forward to this vlog! Times have been hard lately for me but watching you, and Anna, and your honest and real friendship/adventures gives me so much joy. I want you to know that ❤️✌🏼
2:50  Wow, that index finger!... It's soo long!  ˆ◡ˆ
Lily - Oreos was making pop-rock oreos! You would love them if you love popping candy!
Soirée means Evening in French but we also use it to say 'evening party' like 'I'm going to a soirée tonight'
You can really tell when you do ads with brands that you work together to make it very much like your own content.. Really love it! 😊
Soooooooo nice! One more week and than I'm off to the big apple! 😚
I love those vlogs Lily x Anna & you are the ultimate babes <3
Loved,loved this vlog Lily. lovely to see someone so humble and say how lucky they are. Going to re-watch this again for all the good vibes it gives. Well done x.
Cheers Lily!  Your day in Brooklyn is my next date day with my hubbie!  You need to grab the new East River NYCferry next time you are here.  $2.75 a trip and great way to see the city.
Loooooove this vlog Lily! can't wait to check the lipsticks out!
Love the music in this one, Lily! xx
I was in Dumbo just last week by the bridge and carousel and it truly was gorgeous...and peaceful! What a dream trip and the candy floss matches your Alice + Olivia dress 💕
What a seriously enjoyable vlog to watch, such a great mix of clips and the 'AD' part was well integrated and natural. Anyone that has followed you for a while known your love for Bobbi Brown and that makes it even more genuine. Adore the Alice and Olivia dress!! x
I loved this vlog so much! NYC is my favourite, and it was so nice seeing women supporting women 🤗 looked like a super fun trip!
Well, I was girl crushing on both you and Anna the entire vlog! X
Yes Lily, it's Ganni like you said it, at least that's how we pronounce it here in Denmark. It's a Danish family-owned brand ;-)
Love watching yours and Anna's trips together! I think my fantasy New York to-do list is just yours and Anna's recs!
This is such a lovely video and inspiring in a way. The theme behind the brand is amazing and the fact that it leans towards empowering women and encouraging us to find other women to admire is a beautiful thing. I hope to hear more about the lipsticks, maybe you can do an updated video for fall lipsticks or moisturising lipsticks since going towards winter our lips get more drying, at least mine do. It becomes almost impossible for me to wear matte lipsticks, it looks like my lips are falling apart and I tried so many chapsticks, now I settled for Burt's Bees, the vanilla flavoured one and it's pretty good if anybody has dry lips.
Jane's carousel! I'm sure it's the oldest in the world or something similar! I got a tattoo of it to remind me of my fave city.
This is such a great vlog Lily, the ad content is tastefully done and I loved that dress on you!
The editing on this was so goooood! And the music choices too! 💕
Hi Lily! I'm more mature than most of your followers so I picked up on your use of homely. when you said ...homely and lovely... to describe the Crosby Street Hotel. Here in the U.S. homely means unattractive. The British definition is cozy and comfortable, like being at one's home. Isn't that wild?!
That outfit is gorgeous 😍❤️
Great city
Your hair looks amazing ❤️
Awesome VLog Lily...love it!!!
Beautiful vlog :D
Awesome topic for a trip!
Loved this video!
So cool Jenna Lyons was there! I love Cat Bird, just got my wedding band from them ❤
i loveeeeeee geneva, she's so talented and she lives in hong kongggg!
Wait? Did you really just cut a noodle? Anyone else do that?
I really really enjoyed watching this vlog and the music you chose. Well done!
You and Anna are my girl crush!!!  💕💕.  I just love your  vlogs you look so beautiful! 💖
What shoes did you wear with Alice and Olivia dress?
Jenna Lyons is def one of my girl crushes.
i really love the new way of editing the videos ❤️❤️ xx Keep it up loved it xx
AWW i love your looks here also, shipping the lily-anna friendship ALWAYS <3
You, Anna, and Eva are my 3 favorite bloggers/youtubers! So glad to see you combined :)
You and Anna have the cutest friendship, I need a friend like that lol
Brooklyn Bridge is the brown one, the blue metal one is the Manhattan Bridge. x
Lovely vlog Lily! :-)\nImmediately knew I had seen that Carousel before in Glee - Lols :-D Here is the clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb9DGhpxnN0
Definitely want to check out Lilia! Looks so good!
I'm not a lipstick girl but these sound amazing. I'd actually try them.
 You are one of my favorite bloggers and as an amateur musical theatre actress NYC is one of  my favorite cities. Thanks for sharing your time here with sweet Anna
what is the name of the first song? x
You and anna have such a beautiful friendship ❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you both!!!
You are amazing lily ❤️❤️❤️
I spy Jenna Lyons! 😍
Where are the lipstick lids😮😮😮
Ahahahaha pasta baby. Bloody love Anna 😂😂
Lily sitting down on the floor at the start of this vlog reminds me of her old videos 😊
Lily, love the way you do Ad's! I dont even habe the feeling you are doing any Ad's bäm in your face 😊😘
Geneva, from A Pair and A Spare was one of the first fashion blogs I read. Her DIYs are awesome and she has great style.
Oh that dress is worth the splurge <3 Loved this vlog !!
So the Brooklyn bridge is the brown one that you briefly shot on the left. The one you are in front of for most of the time is the Manhattan bridge.
That cookbook looks lush. Really loved this vlog, Lily. I love how your channel is really evolving and changing right now. X
Such a beautiful vlog! I'm really loving your content lately lily 💓
Loved this, Lily! PS All the illustrations got me wondering if you've kept up with your calligraphy...
Awwww I just love your vlogs lily ❤️😘
I don't think homely means what you think it means lol
OMGGGG I've been waiting for this video all day!! Haha I love watching your vlogs 😉
Chemistry these guys have it, seeing ACE clean healthy looking great, there is only one Ace ,  no dis to Tommy but dude you can copy a Rembrandt and it can look great, but it will never be a true Rembrandt this how you play  Parasite ,
think kiss should make one more album with ace and then do what motley crue did, tour the world for that new album and end things on a high note that would be waaaaaay fucking cool
Rock on Ace & Gene, hope to see Kiss with Ace again!\nBest From Late Night With Johnny P Show
Now that was cool, no egotistical nonsense, just , you know, shut up and play!  Love it, should have happened at the RRHOF , but hey, better late than never
So, why not have Paul play rhythm guitar and Peter play drums? It's that simple really!
Bring ace back! Paint somebody else as the starchild!!
Fuck the haters!!! This is awesome!!!!
Yeah Baby!
BRING ACE BACK.
I always thought gene sounded best singing on aces songs
hay gene go eat a hot bowl of DICKS!
Gene was actually pretty gracious on that always pointing at Ace I thought it was pretty cool
Gene sounds damn good
GO ROCK SOLDIER!
I think Gene's starting to look like Andre the Giant!!! Good to see him on stage with the Space Ace
when rock and roll was rock and roll and not bullshit like Madonna and Lady GA GA
He will go all the way to Minnesota to get attention to promote that ... ambitious... VAULT release he announced last week.
forget a reunion, Paul can't sing anymore since that procedure and it's just sad to see in my opinion one of the greatest rock voices struggle to hit some of those higher notes, no thanks I've got great memories of them and him live and that's just fine with me, one of the greatest bands of my life.
That was awesome. After all the bad words from Paul and Gene, they have now both recently played with him. It's a good feel story. They will reunite again as Kiss but they don't need Peter. Those 3 guys were the band. Make it happen.
They’ll never reunite in makeup, but I sense another “Unplugged”, not sure about Peter but Gene Paul and Ace for sure.
You know, KISS takes a lot of crap from a lot of music fans. But this is a great song. And they actually had a good number of them throughout their career. Good performance here.
Seeing this kinda makes me want to see the original band without makeup...
Pure Fuckin Magic..classic im in a wheelchair and this made me get up and devil horn rock my neck off like a bobble head...yeah
At about the 4 minute mark Gene is checking to see if Ace still has it.
Just put all the b.s. behind and get the band back already . Ace you are the man and kiss is the band
kiss is Paul, gene, ace & peter!!!  not those 2 other wanna bees !!!!!
Clapping....\n..get peter and paul  in there and I'll give a standing ovation
This may be as close as we get to a reunion tour. A no make up tour would be good.
As a life long Kiss fan,  That was really cool!
hotter then Hell the original Ki§§
weird...Gene is more likable NOT as the demon.
I saw them after the morning show and ace is a true gentleman. All smiles while signing autographs.
Ace sounds pretty good to me, it just flowed out of him. I wanted to break Genes finger so he couldnt point it at Ace no more. By the way,   Ace did write those songs all by himself, they added the band later!
It will be interesting to hear Eddie Trunk's take on this.
Gene would be better off playing with Ace than Paul at this point.  Ace had the worst voice of any of the original members but he mop the floor with what little Paul has left, vocally.
Paul must've been pissed off when he heard about this reunion performance....
Anyone can say what they like about Gene, but it's undeniable that he's a cool fucker. As is Ace. It'd be great to see them go out with a bang on a big tour with everyone that ever played under the name, Kiss.
Love to see Peter .Paul ,Gene, Ace do this w/o makeup just Rock n Roll they do not need all the pyro or makeup just PLAY
You can see the HOLY FUCK, I'M ON STAGE WITH ACE FREHLEY !!!!!!! look on the younger guys in the band. Great to see.
Bring back the Cat too!
He was kissing Ace's ass the whole show. Nothing from Gene Simmons ever seems real or sincere. He doesn't care about the fans or music, just making money
Heard from the guy who posted this video - he said that Ace was sober right before the show. So I was wrong to think he was drunk. My apologies Spaceman! You still do a hell of a good drunk walk for a sober guy :)
Kiss new merchandise I bought a Kiss bedpan at this show and my wife bought the Kiss three pack adult diapers and the Kiss denture glue
Good to see Ace and Gene put their differences aside for a good cause
Gene&Ace????  Wow!! what a lovely day!!!!\nmore exciting than original-KISS reunion :)
Gene will fire Paul and hire Ace
Both Gene and Ace have let themselves go physically... such a shame... but hey... they still sound great!
How many more guitar players can they fit on a hat stage?
Just hearing Gene say Ace's name like that in the beginning makes me freaking happy. I'm glad in the end after all the bickering, they can still come together like none of that ever happened. I wish Paul was there to join them. That would have been amazing.
KISS REUNION PLEASE! A REAL FAREWELL TOUR !!! REAL KISS, REAL FAREWELL !!!
I enjoy seeing Ace play with other Kiss members on the friend level better than being in Kiss.  This way everyone is happy, getting along and want to be on stage together.
I grew up with this music. Some of the best hard rock ever written. Love it. damn sure would go see them in concert.
Finally found something good to say about Gene. At least he knows the songs.
Glad to see this happening. Gene wrote some songs with Ace recently, and it looks like they still have a pretty big spark playing together.
Be cool to see the pair tour?🤔\n\nJman👀
Ace is THE place with the helpful hardware man!
Do you know of the bands, KISS maid? Little help?
Great to see them together but as a loyal Original4Forever it still doesn't seem right without Peter\nMaybe his fued with Paul can end even if Pete's retired maybe do a show or two.
a reunion again? Really? I don't know peter isn't doing well & recently retired.would I Like Ace to be FULLY on the next KISS CD? YES. but I doubt they will want to or agree on a full tour.
Do all aging metal heads sound like punk garage bands?  I'm not making fun.  After all, I like punk!
BRING ACE BACK & THE MONEY IS THERE$$$$IMMMONS
Those dudes can't play with Gene an Ace thier lazy slacks,thier too...loose that was more of a tight groove song Ace an Gene should have just had somebody in the back ground on rhythm...
That was so fucking awsome. Gene looks happy. That's hard to fake. Playing with old friends, gotta be an incredible feeling.
Bring back Ace! Time for another reunion tour!!!! F it, I'll go again.
One of the BEST songs KISS ever recorded...
This shows that Gene is an amazing bass player. Most bass players just follow the drums without worrying about much, whereas Gene creates little melodies inside the songs as in Detroit Rock City, Deuce or Watchin' You. An all time great
The magics still there two Legends
i wish i was there
Holly crap, it's finally come!
So nice to see Gene and Ave together.
He still LOOKS GREAT GODDAMMIT-YOU GOTTA LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
Gene confused Ace with Peter about the ten inch thing
Ladies and gentleman. The real deal. 🤘
Gene loves to play music with Ace when Ace is sober. It looks like both are having a blast here. It would be great to see the original lineup just play without makeup on just play a concert in street closes.
Solo surprised me. very good
This is so good to see and hear. It's still there.
I love Ace but those rings might be starting to weigh his right hand down just a bit
Fuck yeah!!! I am loving Gena and Ace. This is fuckin awesome!!!
they sound 1,000,000 times better than the current fake KISS
oh man.. lets hope .. this is a good sign.
Yeah Ace!  Fuck Gene!
Esophagus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo great!
Gene actually looks pleased.
Rachael Gordon in background Ace Frehley's Fiance.
Ace Frehley - funniest guy in rock!
Bring back ace!
Ace is God , still fucking shredding
Awesome
Wow! This is AWESOME!
Hell yeah!
Ace is still cool
Fuckin awesome!! !
This was awesome!
Epic
Magie ist - wenn alle Original Kiss Mitglieder rocken. Der Zauber ist unvergleichlich. Daher ist Kiss unersetzlich...es ist wie wenn man sein Seelenfreund trifft - einzigartig.
Nics wig.. what an old bum..tommy thayer is the true spaceman......fuck this clown.
It's official, Ace has sold out and betrayed people like me who despise that washed up sex addict, Gene Simmons. Respect for Ace at 0 now.
It's two buddy's jamming, bugger all the reunion stuff! They tried it, it failed. Kiss would not exist past 2000 if not for the current format, otherwise no one would be talking about 'fake' anything! I'm glad the original members are all still alive, unlike a lot of bands. The finale for the greatest rock band of all time will be memorable I'm sure!!! 🤘
Sounds like shit.
Hotter than Hell...best Kiss album
thumbs up if you have no idea why lily is hitting everything but you love it anyway x

Your songs forever with us chester since like always singing along with you, i tryin aint cry... thank you chester helped me alot
To those who disliked or wants to.. I hope u will not dislike or remove your dislike because this is the type of songs where people wants to hear so that they can remember who they had lost and wants to remember what they did. I hope that this song will reach the whole world and that Chester will always be in our hearts <3
You will always be loved in our Heart 😞
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple, sometimes goodbye's the only way- Shadow of the Day. RIP Chester. Forever in our heart.
We saw brilliance while the world was asleep
love u Chezy you will always live in my heart....
Thanks chester for all
We love u Chester....u mad my life so much easier 💖💖💖💖💖
18 years so gone，Chester is gone
Wut The Fuck !!!\nLove it so much <3 <3
This makes me so emotional
Not good.... Why do people like these people.
Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?\nCan I help you, not to hurt, anymore?\nWe saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep\nThere are things that we can have, but can't keep\n\nIf they say\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\nIn a sky of a million stars\nIt flickers, flickers\nWho cares when someone's time runs out?\nIf a moment is all we are\nWe're quicker, quicker\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\nWell I do\n\nThe reminders pull the floor from your feet\nIn the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh\nAnd you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair\nJust 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there\n\nIf they say\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\nIn a sky of a million stars\nIt flickers, flickers
I still can't believe he is gone
I am sure that all Linkin Park fans are still missing Chester
Chester's death hit alot of people hard. Aaron Lewis broke down in the middle of his cover of linkin park. Doesn't matter if you liked the band or not depression affects us all and it takes a great person committing suicide for us to notice just how dangerous depression is.
Can I help you not to hurt anymore... \nChester, Linkin park, you've helped some of us more than you can imagine. Thank you.
I love you Chester and will never forget you , you're my hero
Thank you for making this guy's can't explain exactly why I have felt this emotional over the last few weeks but this was cool to see.
I a may or may not have shed a tear while watching video.
Linking Park for life.
Finally got the courage to watch this video for the first time today and as soon as it started my skin started to react, my eyes swelled up and the tears flowed... Fuck man, life is fucking unfair.
i was blown away by the news i grew up in the tmf period and yes linkin park was one of them i grew up with like nirvana and many others . RIP i hope you found your rest up there
To those who dislike, you got no dick and for female, you're bitch with cunt
It still hurts... We will always love you my middle school heroes...
A light burned in magnificent colors. It slowly dimmed.. then.. faded out one fateful day.. That Light was a life and it was.. Chester's.
i always miss him 😭
WoW, the feels... rest easy Chester
OMG THIS SONG IS SO BAD HAHAHAHAHA, I'M GONNA REPLY TO EVERYONE SAYING THIS SONG SUCKS HAHAHAHAHA... I TROLL PEOPLE CAUSE I HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO.... HAHAHHA... LOVE ME PLEASE... HAHAHA... I NEED ATTENTION... HAHAHAHAHA Seriously do you something other than be a complete loser. You don't like this song? Fine, but at least just drop that dislike and leave. Don't be an attention whore, god you guys are like my ex girlfriend.. creating drama just to make your life interesting 😂
The Legend now in the right place:)
There were signs you ignored, I don't want your help anymore. I'll keep the good stuff, our good memories, but you won't, you don't care. The reminders boost a false sense of love, just cause you believe it doesn't mean it's there. I won't stop caring about you.
Your music will live in our hearts forever
i'm almost near my greatest break up ever, but i know i have one more light.
I break down every single time I watch this...every time... 😔
No one ever likes my comments and I care
As if he sang the song of his own funeral...
To all the 7K dislikes, your heartless bastards, he was an amazing man, he's helped this world so much, he's given me an honor to know him, and he's given the world a chance to hear his word, you are a heartless bastard if you dislike this or him, I love you all, R.I.P Chester and keep living and loving, peace
Czech republic we love you 😢
why am i feeling that this all (the death and all) was planned......
I've always loved Linkin Park, but I always worried about Chester's wellbeing. Some songs were very depressing and I always had a feeling he would take his own life, hoping he wouldn't with his wife and kids and a life he loved. And yet he did. He sang about how unfair it is when someone dies, that empty dinner chair, and how people DO care when someone dies, but I feel he was too far gone for a very long time and his light left the sea of stars. How did no one close to him see this? RIP
chester you will remain into our hearts...
Chestor you be the personification of the deepest emotions we feel every day. Love you. See you soon one fine day
F#$% the 7K dislike FFF YOUU~~~!!! don't ever follow linkin park then.. F#$% YOU all 7K dislike
I tried so hard and got so far\nBut in the end, it doesn't even matter\nI had to fall to lose it all\nBut in the end it doesn't even matter\nIn the End... Chester forever in our hearts
For those people who dislikes this video,..Fuck you all,..haha,......
I've decided to get help after Chester passed away. I'm on meds now, and I can see positive changes already. \nThank you. I'm so sorry it had to be this way.
It's been a little over two months, but it still feels like it was yesterday you left us. One day we will meet again, Chester #LegendsNeverDie
Legends don't die they live forever in our hearts
Linkin park will never be the same 💔 Growing up you we're my #1 band to listen to during my teen years. My heart aches for your death, you had one of a kind voice. We 💜 you Chester!
This Is sad.. #FuckDepression
I'm crying. 😭😭

Podesta killed him.
deep water more pressure, space vacuum & radiation so we need suitable suites and environment. simple instead of long boring video :P
This whole thing was very narrow minded and short sighted.\n\nIf we had the technology to build under water biospheres, pressure wouldn't be an issue. The structural integrity of the system would be high enough to not need to highly pressurize the air inside to combat the external pressure. Boom. Air pressure problem solved.\n\nWe have the means to generate artificial sunlight that can grow plants and stimulate vitamin d production.\nBoom your vitamin D problem solved. Plant growth problem solved.\n\nRegular plumbing. Boom. Urine / waste issue solved.\n\nHumidity. Really? Ever hear of dehumidifiers? Problem solved.\n\nLiterally every problem you mentioned has already been solved. We do have the technology and means to build such a structure. It would be massive and immensely thick to hold back the water pressure but we *COULD* do it.\n\nCO2 scrubbing and water reclamation. The list goes on.\n\nWhat a short sighted video.
I still dont really get the preassure thing tbh :(\nWhy would preassure be a thing i would have to handle with if im in a building underwater?\nYou even mentioned how submariens dont deal with the preassure.
I've got a question, why is salt and pepper singled out as the 2 condiments that you would want most with food?
Given money and resource isn't an issue, couldn't we solve all those issues with tidal generators (powering machines that normalise pressure), giant sunlight simulating LED's, aquaphobic coatings and genetically modified plants to create extra oxygen for a set populous?
Underwater? Outer space? Why not both!? Stargate Atlantis <3
Would our bodies be able to adapt to all those not so friendly conditions throughout generations though? Evolution has shown that adaptations to crazy things are possible.
The Bends is a great album.
Serious question:  When a person eats sweets, if one's pancreas does not produce enough insulin on its own, one becomes diabetic.  When one uses artificial sweeteners, does one have the possibility of becoming a patient of artificial Diabetes?  Given the sweetness of these artificial sweeteners, would it not fool the pancreas and other bodily functions to cause such a situation?
Question: why does hair go grey and why has my nose and ears started sprouting hair in midde age? Yuck. Thanks
What are we doing to prevent global warming
If there's so much radiation in space, how do astronaughts stay safe whlist in space?
Why an earth would you want to live underwater?
You can have your underwater envionment at normal atmospheric pressure as long as your habitat is built strongly enough. The humidity thing is BS, it can be as dry as you want.
Why can't you have a double wall structure with pressurized walls and have regular pressure for the people inside?
yea people, living underwater isnt a good idea, i choose space
In reference to the flashes of light that astronauts see when they close their eyes from radiation effects, it can also be caused by Cherenkov radiation. Ground based experiments have not narrowed the exact cause yet, so both direct nerve optic nerve interaction and Cherekov radiation are the suspected causes.
We are not fish.
Don't be stupid, comeback to reality.
What about using virtual reality to 'fool' the brain to not feel like you are in a small enclosed space ?
No gods or kings, only man.

Where have I seen him?😅
Actually mentioned Bioshock, kewl
First
Shiit 2nd :D
The Lionesses top their group after matchday 1.
So sorry to see Mark Sampson leave England Women's Team - THANK YOU for some amazing results and progress in Women's Football. My wife and I have REALLY enjoyed supporting and following the England Lionesses and their tremendous progress.
Too easy.
Why is this trending?
*BLYAT*
Then they go and sack the manager, what the hell..
Is it me or do the English lady's play better than the men. Well done girls
02:00 best of the lot.\n#Bronze
Mark Sampson is such a great manager.\n\n\nOh wait...
Toni Duggan is such a great player
0:10 Goal! Let's do one thing to secure our career, nothing is more important than our career *Everyone celebrated with sampson\n0:29 Sampson: that will do it, players support me, the world will think i'm innocent
Why are there people on here complaining about womans football. 'Who watches this' 'womens football should be banned' 'Id care if it wasnt women' You dont have to like it but it clearly said WOMEN in the title, why bother clicking on it? Genuinley curious? Usually if i see something i k ow i dont like, i tend not to click on it.
Amazing Fran Kirby
pizdec
1.45 failed hi five
So, in light of all the rumours swarming around Sampson, all these celebrations look a bit... forced and rather dodgy, tbh.
Aluko and the other players making accusations against Sampson should be utterly ashamed. The ones complaining are the ones that are technically poor and so haven't kept up with the development of the game over the years under sampsons charge. Aluko was fast but technically terrible and like schoolboy football as the other players develop technically the poorer players get found out. Aluko and Sanderson are disgusting and cost Sampson his job and career, just because they cannot accept they're not good enough.\nThe FA are an embarrassment, when they decided they don't want anymore race coverage, despite him being cleared twice, they look through his history and find an excuse from before he even had the England job which all of a sudden is a sackable offence. #JokeFA
The crowd sounds so stupid.
Good girls
I support Tranmere
Tranmere rovers!!!!!

What a player frank kirby is... amazing... she deserved the player.of the match award
I just like watching women run after a ball
This is meant to be enterta.. I just woke up.
Just need Benny Hill theme tune over this
these are the type of results a good manager with longevity gets you
3 out of 6 of the goals in this game are CALAMITOUS. Hilarious to watch...please dont pretend it's at a decent level. The fifth and sixth goals are simply LMFAO
how is this on trending with 11k views? just more evidence towards you just pay to get up there.
Like to see a game with the usa team.
Then hours later he was sacked
Manager Sacked.
Check out www.makeplates.co.uk for car show/legal plates :)
Now Sampson is set to leave as manager haha
Hi everyone can you subscribe to my channel please watch my little boy doing football training thank you
I'm sure eni aluko will still find something to complain about
*scores 6th goal* \nCommentator: And that will seal up the game\nI think it was sealed at 3-0
i mean its all nice but imagine Bailly and Rojo charging at them. The whole team would have to be stretchered off
Good job, Mini Messi! Fantastic assists tonight.
Pity it’s the women
who even watches this?
Great performance by the girls. Cracking start to the campaign. Well done everybody involved.
Man Toni Duggan is a babe and good player too 😍☺️
Brits might won this football battle but Russians will always win the beauty war
Great Lioness and beating Russia is great.
Everything about that first celebration is just wrong... They show unity but what about Eni Alike uhh ? Unity in keeping the starting spots.
First
Women football shout be banned
Can't believe the fa sacked mark Sampson all because he dropped 1 player who didn't like it he was cleared twice of any wrong doing from 2 different investigations no other players are saying he did it England just got rid of the second most successful England  manager so good job
Wow, finally Duggan scores and she's labelled a good player.She's an Heskey. She chokes a lot.Good game.
kirby should have gotten man of the match for that amazing performance. but they all played brilliantly so understandable that the commentators had a hard time choosing
I'd care if it wasn't women's football tbh
Why is this trending with only 7k views,
No such thing as England lioness bunch of Dykes
Ladies love to play with balls more than men 😂😂
Reported for violent content
Russia lost credibility all over the world after that doping scandal. It would have been better to lose honourably than to win and lose honour.
School girl level of skill
Do It fOr ThE sOvIeT uNiOn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission Failed better luck next time
Preston park tranmere rover ground was empty and it was shocking game and under 12 boy team would wipe floor with russia and england team is crap defence with goalkeeper was comedy show.
Why is this on trending. O I know libtube.
1:33 what a miss!
The women are better than men 👍
stop playing football
Good riddance Mark Sampson you racist scumbag
Transformers has had 5 movies... we are dumber than dogs.
Exactly. Thank you. I'll let you feel the pain for me, since you're paid to do so....yeah...
So looks like Prince of Persia is going to keep being the only adaptation that's serviceable at best...
Your dogs are cute as hell.
uploaded a video essay on the movie and video game movies as a whole for anyone interested.
You must listen to TOM LEYKIS!
The tomb raider origin story and character growth sucked. Loved the games but the story of the reboots SUCKED
I played the 2013 tomb raider game,which it looks like this movie is going for. It was on sale on the PlayStation network about a year ago. It was awesome. I thought it was a good game and it did play as a movie. I saw in the trailer there are some gems from the game and also the second game too. The actress does look close to the new Lara. Hope it good.
Hey Jeremy, could you please do a review of the Agent Cobra: Reborn theatrical trailer, it looks like a good movie, and I wanted to know what you think
I hope this movie will be good,pls god!!!
Saw the trailer, thought it looked like crap. Nough Said.
This has always been my position, its better to make a video game from a live action movie, than a live action movie from a video game, it will not work most of the time. The video game is a world of fanstasy, where impossible things can be done, where the game character can die many times and you hit the replay button and he's back at it again. It is very difficult for any studio to reproduce and match the expectation of the the gamer. It might only be good for those who have never played the games. I will not be going to watch this. Same goes for making live action movies from cartoons or animations, that is why I have stayed away from the batman v superman and justice league, wonder woman, aquaman and all those other shit movies that will be coming out of the DC universe. I'd rather stick to watching DCAU movies, or JLU series... I have never seen anyone represent the Dark Knight to my satisfaction in live action movies as he has been represented in the DCAU, Kevin Conroy's voice irreplaceable.. Well the new guy is not bad though
I'll have to use that pattern recognition rant when explaining why I think things are going to go to shit.
It was basically watching the movie version of the game released a few years back.
The movie looks mediocre. But Lara's origin story in the 2013 torture game wasn't good at all. It was unbelievable. I don't like the gritty reboot. Crystal Dynamics are such sellouts.
no one can beat angelina jolie's hotness :/
At 2:30 I really exploded in sudden laughter xD And is that duck thing a quote from some movie or whatever?
I like Alicia Vikander. She was cute in Ex Machina.
It is our reminder that Warcraft and the silent Hill movies are the best the genre has to offer
The fuck is this dude talking about? Full on rant about nothing and his dogs in the middle there.
Here in the UK,some film maker said in 5 years Hollywood will be churning out nothing but reboots/remakes/updates etc etc as no original ideas will exist anymore.....after watching this trailer,i understand why he said it....nothing new/original/innovative.....same old green screen/CGI etc etc........
Dogs shitting on the floor? Not surprised. Should have gotten a cat...
I am SOOO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FILM :)!!!
I thought the trailer looked straight to videoish and kinda boring.
Looked like shit is probably going to be shit wont be watching that shit.
Basically, Alicia Vikander and possibly the rest of the cast deserve better than the writing, direction and tone that the movie might have as a whole. The photos and posters seemed to promise a dark and gritty atmosphere that the reboot games delivered. But then the trailer comes out and it's like the late 90s again. \n\nAlso, this whole Angelina Jolie thing...why is she being brought up in so many comments? Is everyone making fun of the fact that certain people pretend to love older versions of movies or some shit? That's like, Man, Ben Affleck will always be Daredevil. I'm not feeling this Netflix series.\n\nTotally different dimension guys.
It looked like shit. I don't want any movie to be shit and hope am proven wrong like Wonder Woman, but sometimes you can't help but say like it's bad from the trailer.
Thing about videogame movies is, that they mostly just pick the easy, uninteresting ones. Like wtf is special about Tomb Raider, its Indianna Jones, but with a girl. I bet they are gonna record Uncharted too at some point. The only interesting videogame movie was Warcraft, because thats an original world, and despite its flaws, I still like that movie.
Jeremy you are spot on with this trailer a solid meh
I like the shirt you wearing. Really I like it.
Your comment about your dogs shitting when you are not home......I know that struggle.  8 year old dopey Lab here.
Its a video game movie they are all terrible so who cares.
How was this even a trailer review, you were basically talking about your dogs...
I'm cautiously optimistic about this movie.
Of course she is the shit, Mcnulty is her father.
I'm with ya Jeremy
Tbh ...I was hoping you do punisher trailer review looks awesome .. but again tbh it does honestly looks good
I lost all cognitive thought the moment he mentioned Gypsy and Danger.
This role seems below Alicia at this point in her career.
damn! this review is deep!
I could see it being a high point for videogame movies\nBut that's a high of like, 7/10 at best
I just feel like the movie will be rushed... in the Tomb Raider game reboot, the first game was essential her being dropped in an unknown world and discovering shit while still being talented in survival. It would be nice if this Tomb Raider was survival based and focus a ton on Lara instead of the side characters.
I wanted to see the innocent fragile girl who almost cried having to kill an animal for food Origin Story... oh wait she's already THE Tomb Raider...
I'm just going to say it.  Love the holodeck shirt!
Trailer didnt catch me and i did not buy Vikander as Lara Croft. Definately not the badass Lara from the old games and still not the just growing into adventure Lara Croft from the new games. She is just a well trained good looking but skinny girl in the jungle. With guns. Does not feel like Tomb Raider at all. Trailer has no soul to me. I dont believe in this movie. I hope im wrong.
It looks decent I will wait to see more of it
You're preaching to the choir here Jeremy.
Nigga if people do what you do in regards to videogame movies then nobody would've seen Batman Begins. The trailer was shit, let's be honest. And by that time Superhero movies had gone the way of Shaft. I'm not saying Tomb Raider will be good, in fact, I now it will be shit, but give me a break, man.
Wait Richard Croft is alive in this?
Jeremy your shirt is awesome and so is your dogs names!
I think the main problem with the trailer is its editing. \nThere is no way that clip at the end of the trailer where she is buying guns ins't from the end of the movie.
You know what would have been a better film? Two games in one...Nathan Drake and Lara Croft go on an adventure! This film looking terrible and Lara looks bored.
I liked Vikander in Ex Machina and she is a good actress for the reboot Lara. But the trailer looks like a 90ies movie to me with all the bad greenscreen and general cheesiness. The music was especially bad, so for me the trailer did nothing - except that it was good to see some Frost again.
One question.. why her ?\nShe is the definite opposite of a badass
You could make a legit Far Cry 3 movie.. That story was awesome
You know what you can do J? Why not review Tomb Raider (2013) and Rise of the Tomb Raider?
Looked like a straight Blu-Ray trailer
looks horrible the game has better CGI and cost less to make lol
I totally agree, just play the damn game! You'll have more fun! I feel sad about Alicia Vikander, I mean, yeah she will probably get money and all but being in a movie of a videogame will probably hurt her career.
The trailer looks pretty good.
No one can Lara Croft like Angelina Jolie. She was perfect. This actress looks like Lara Croft the early years and I can accept that.
I never look forward to VG movies but if they was to announce a God of War movie, I’d lose my shit
I hope they let her learn how to be the Tomb Raider. If she come out whipping the floor with people then ima be pissed. I feel like she will have very little to learn about survival.
Review the new punisher trailer please!
am I the only one that doesn't like the actor who's playing Lara Croft because she's doesn't look like in the video game in 2015 and the old games?
My expectations are zero but I'm hopeful
I'm trying to NOT have expectations. This works in real life, too. I do it all the time. Nothing will ever go right. Then when it does, boom! I love the crap outta Tomb Raider. One of my favorite games. I can not tell you how many times I've played the original game. I was 12 when that game came out. I definitely wanna see this. But I'm probably going to be cringing the entire time. Who knows! Maybe it'll be another guilty pleasure movie like the ridiculous RE films.
Dog shit! I expected a top class movie for tomb raider.....so disappointed. And i wanted to see her grow and become the tomb raider but clearly thats too hard for the producers.
Why do they keep picking games with cookie cutter stories? tomb raider is JUST indiana jones. STOP. Legacy of kain, Planescape Torment, GOD DAMN
Any one else reminded of the iron fist trailer or was it just me.
The first Jolie one was perfectly stupid.
I'm glad you touched on it, Jeremy, but it's really bothering me that they're leaning so heavily on the reboot for tone and visuals, but seemingly the plot is Lara Croft going on an adventure to save the world as opposed to Lara Croft going to explore some neat ruins or something and suddenly having to fight for her life.\n\nLike, that was a big draw of the story and tone of the reboot game. Lara obviously had some skills in survival and whatnot, but we got to see her pushed (at least partially) into becoming the badass who goes looking for danger.
Most of the scenes from the trailer match the new video game that came out a while back
Jeremy has puppies!!! So cute... oh and the video review was good, but. Still puppies!
Conclusion: you should have reviewed the Punisher trailer.\nNext time, trust your instincts, grasshopper!
i felt in love you said your dogs name, gypsy danger! jajajajaja
I don't think she's a good pick at all for Lara
I have the same T-shirt! And I know everyone here wanted to know that =)
STOP WITH THE JUMP-CUTS! THEYRE NOT HELPING YOUR VIDEO! THEYRE TAKING AWAY FROM IT!
You named your dogs Gypsy and Danger? That's fucking awesome!
It's just a trailer dude. Watch the featurette instead, it's better.
What did JJ think of the Halo films, 3 of which made it to DVD?
As someone who doesn't play video games newer than N64, I actually enjoy about 65% of the video game movies that come out.
To quote Garrus Vakarian: I like to expect the worst. There's always a small chance I'll be pleasantly surprised
LOVE the names of those dogs! ;-)
So...am i some kind of...TOMB RAIDER?...credits roll
LOL your shirt!
100% agree
Looks kinda bland and generic
Does Jeremy Jahns look like Milo Yiannopoulos?
pattern recognition lol, <3 JJ
That shirt. <3
Gypsy and Danger, nice Pacific Rim allusion.
Dude, best shirt ever.
I would gladly be dumber than two digs call gypsey and danger. Just sayin
Love your dogs dude
its was jus meh :/
Looks average at best
OMG...more pics of your puppos please! 😃
stop makinf video games movies point done
Guys I know this has nothing todo do with the channel but there was an earthquake in México City yesterday and theres a lot of help needed if you could spreed the word would help a lot
Swoll af 😂
wow american drink sizes are huge! :o
Is it racist that when Jun was talking with the cat in front of him there was going to be a obligatory Asian joke?
Funny, I am just having some KFC over here in Indonesia 😂
How much calories are in the jewelry collection?
so basically Japan's fast food soda sizes are the same as the US... from the 1980's
just dont eat! ever! no food! youll be so attractive!
I went to Japan a few weeks ago. Just out of plain curiosity I ordered McDonald's. Yes! They have smaller portions. However, for me it was the perfect portion. I felt satisfied when I finished my meal. Usually, here in United States I tend not to finish my meal. Because it is to much for me.
I was about to subscribe... When I realized that i have already subscribed
OMG THAT NECKLACE WAS SO PRETTY 💕💕💕💕💕💕😍😍😍😍😍😍 I MUST HAVE
I think Rachel is very well ya know not as pretty as Japanese girls
THIS IS RACHEL AND JUN. WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT ALL THE WAY made me lose it ;; you guys are the best!
Hey Rachel! I am from Nepal but I am at USA for my study. I wanted to go to japan for visit purpose. How can I apply to Japan from USA as a Nepalese citizen.
check the sugar content, sugar is what makes you fat
I'm from New Zealand and from this chart we are 1 above japan in the average calorie intake yet we are the 3rd most overweight country in the world, I'm so confused right now.
An answer for the calories of the fries might be in what oil is used? McDonalds in the US I know switched to vegetable oil many years ago for their fries. Not sure on BK.
Not overly worried about calorie levels as we're not big eaters anyway but Le Hubby & I watch our sodium levels. We are always shocked when we look at the sodium levels in some Japanese fast food. Misu, oshoyu, etc are very tasty but super-high in sodium!
They're both so beautiful! If they have a child it will be GORGEOUS! Oh my goodness.
American fast food in Japan vs American fast food in America
The skits for this video were so cute
Very interesting, cultural differences are fascinating.  I love Jun’s Kitchen, and your jewelry collection.  One of the best facets of your videos is your normalcy.  Best wishes to you.
i missed you T_T

you need to update your cooking channel more frequently then!!!
Rachel you should really get some anti-reflective lenses the next time you buy glasses.
it's always please my day by watching videos of both of you. thank you.
Good thing I don't drink soda lmao
This video was great good job.
Yes and they are unhealthy extremes! Jun looks too thin. Stop trying to promote anorexia. You are starving your girlfriend.
Great video guys and just like Jun said.. eating fresh home made real food is the way to go. I haven't stepped foot inside a fast food restaurant in over 10 years, the food is just so unappealing in every way.
hi rachel and jun..have you tried the game ''cat mario''??
I'm so happy to see this guys back. Cuties <3
I'm like Rachel, have to drink lots of water all day. It's good for you and actually helps with digestion, but a lot of people in the states tend to replace water with soda or other sugary drinks which ends up making things so much worse, even if you're only eating at home. It is interesting that drinks are so much smaller in Asian countries, I wonder if there's something about the evolution of the Asian diet that has led to a lower needed hydration level... I would say lower salt levels but there's plenty of salt in most Asian cuisine.
American’s are fat fucks
i work in korean public schools and the water habit seems to be what throws people the most when first coming here. No one drinks with their meal in the cafeteria, they just take essentially a shot of water afterwards on the way our the door. Koreans teachers always joke about how foreign teachers are always walking around with giant bottles of water lol.
Do people put as much ice in their drinks as in the US though? We might have huge cups, but often times half or more of it just ice.
there is almost a year that i don't go to McDonalds
MURICAAAAAAA
Do those small Japanese cups at least come with free refills (if only for water)?  The volume of water consumed with a meal should be equal to or exceed the volume of food eaten.
0H M4h G4WD heck I have the same ruler as you guys
This video is so impressive, educational and food for thought.
Japan is healthier and Japanese live longer than Americans.
Rachel you stand out in the crowd sooo much 😂
Also lets not forget they jam pack the cups with ice
Thats was one of the most adorable transitions to an ad ive ever seen. I love them both 😂😂
something something but what about the amount of ice in the cups? usually american drinks are like 90% ice
I eat junk food a lot, but I eat it at the smallest portion (like getting the kids meal) and that's how I stay skinny.
Jun pls, you haven't made many cooking videos to tell other that they should try your food. but no hate
WHY AM I SO BROKE?! your jewelerylooks amazing Rachel!!
I drink a LOT of water
3 MONTHS WITHOUT A VIDEO
Japan is a dieter's nutritional heaven. America doesn't have to be bad either, but most of their food companies suck.
I don't know never really like fast food lol and US food just does not do it for me hlah to much junk even in the so called healthy food..also does not help they add in a LOT of stuff that's not even food such as petroleum byproduct and more NO TY! >_<'  but I've really liked Japanese fast food lol they at least offer healthy options with no junk on them or in to make the food cheaper just good food yay. ^_^\nAs always I don't replay to anyone sorry and trolls ja u win good for u lol! :P
I thought in the end he was going to say The best diet is to eat cats. with the cat in front of him lol.
no waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy I thought people in countries like Japan and Taiwan would eat out WAY MORE than people in countries like USA or Canada D:
I want a mcdonalds now but i live so far away...
Despite of size, personally I prefer to cook my meals because I control what goes in it. Not to mention that I hate feeling bad after having all of that greasy food. Because I don't eat fast food a lot. Fast food to me is a meal made in less than 30min. Plus I save more money because I usually make enough food for a few days. Jun, do you have meals in Japan that are good as leftovers? I know that it's different there because most meals are best served fresh. However are there tricks to meal prep so when the day comes to make the meal you want ends up being as flavorful if not more than if you'd made the whole meal on the same day?
The Jewellery is so gorgeous. What a shame that I am allergic to silver :(
Coming from Denmark where people are constantly talking about exercising and eating healthy. This is how Denmark stands:\nMcDonalds\nHamburger - 253 kcal \nBig mac - 503 kcal\nCoca cola big - 212 kcal\nCoca cola medium - 170 kcal\nCoca cola small - 106 kcal\nFries big - 434 kcal\nFries medium - 330 kcal\nFried small - 231 kcal\n\nBruger King\nHamburger - 244.1 kcal\nWhopper - 613.6 kcal\nDouble Whopper - 851.7 kcal\nCoca cola big - 210 kcal\nCoca cola medium - 168 kcal\nCoca cola small - 105 kcal\nFries big - 347.9 kcal\nFries medium - 284.2 kcal\nFries small - 181.3 kcal\n\nTo sum it all up: If you want to eat the healthiest burgers and fries go to Denmark, for the healthiest soda go to Japan. Side note: most people in Denmark drink diet soda anyway. When deciding between Mcdonalds or Burger King, Burger King is healthier.
Greece is 3RD?!?!?!? WOWWWWWWWWWWW. I mean we do eat a whole lot and we add olive oil to ALL our foods Cuz tradition but at least what we eat is healthy😂 plus we don't eat out much, most often you can eat is once a week but our fast food portions are relatively small. Idk I'm surprised Cuz I don't see overweight Greeks often. That could just be me though😂
With the drinks the clear difference is the American drink is at least 50% ice at minimum.
I'm hungry now -_-
How could you drink NOTHING with a meal? I would absolutely choke and die, omg.
Omg love the video 😍 I like the new style  of this video too 😍😍.. keep the good work guys .. can't wait to see your next video 😊
You guys are such dorks XD I missed your videos! Also the food is a lot different between the two countries too! We tend to eat a lot of red meat and bread here whereas in Japan it's more of fish and rice. Tofu is like a thing only health nuts eat in America lol at least where I live! Most stores only have a small selection of it if any at all.
the effort that went into this video is amazing
I got a little scared when he started talking about his cooking channel while the cat was lying on the bench 😂
Who is that gorgeous celebrity who is apparently fat and ugly in Japan?
I miss you guys!!! Thank you for posting again❤
Good job... you succeeded at making me ever more hungry... Thanks alot Btw I love ur channel!
That subtle advertising for jun cooking channel hahaha nice work guys, but on a side note yea Japan's fast food is still smaller than most of Asia. Was kind of shocked when I ate at McDonald's the first time in comparison to my home country.
I think something to consider is westerners are bigger than Asians by default. Not in fat, but actual body mass so the required calorie intake will vary. A huge problem we have is while things may not have certain ingredients in them they get replaced by much unhealthier alternatives to both save on production and pass laws that say food should have less of say sugar. Something may not have sugar in it, but it's just replaced with high fructose corn syrup which is much worse for you. There's a lot of shady practice that goes on that allows companies to bypass laws. For example, something may say it's made in america on the box but the item says made in china. What they do is claim that the box was made in the US, but the item was manufactured in China. Good times.
I do agree that Japanese are overall healthier. But am I the only one that thinks that the healthy bmi in Japan looks unnatural compared to the healthy bmi in America? In Japan it looks almost as if some of them are anorexic. I say that not to be offensive of course. But I'm concerned that the Japanese are starting to fall into the opposite extreme compared to America. America is too fat, but Japan is too skinny
The griiiid....it looks so effing perfect my ocd antenna is just loosing it :D
Eyy I subscribed to junskitchen before this one :D
Dang I didn't know America was so fat. I've lived in Colorado my whole life and very few people are overweight here.
I loved that jewllery when it first came out and still do! It's just I'm trying to be a minimalist and have a ton of jewllery already TT_TT
Jun should have a cook off with Shaylor and Rachel could be the blind taste testor.
Well done video! Very good edition and design of information :D
Quick question: how many cats do you have ?
In Japan, you can walk to anywhere. In the U.S., you either don't want to or plain and simple, why walk when you can drive.
no wonder if japanese are healthy,just...look at the cup size comparison...
My parents don't let me eat out and I can't even remember the last time I had soda.
I thought you guys had stopped making videos.
Sometimes I skip all the meals but most times it's lunch and I eat healthy foods I live in America
Rachel is so beautiful!!!
i'll admit the cup sizes made me laugh
The good side of those small cups is there's less waste and also you have less chance to have diabete
even if we say that japanese would eat alot. they would lose it fast cause of how their lifestyle is. 1 example is more walking less riding. compare to americans.
my family eats out five times a week......😑I just figured out why i lost weight once i started living on my own....
one of the only trailers nowadays that doesn't give too much away!! (David Bowie YES)
looking forward to this! that trailer had such beautiful music / sound editing
oooh! i'm very excited about this!
Looks really freaking cool!
Saw this in Cannes, this trailer really doesn't do the film justice - it's way more magical and mesmerising. This makes it look like a Disney movie...

Take a shot every time she says Girl
Gigi G do you work at Microsoft because I text with you before. You helped me.... I'm Jack..
Hi gigi I'm a big fan!
love that bag\n*throws across room*
You sound like a commercial
You look gorgeous as always :) would love an update on the electrolysis :)
I saw your film Gigi and i just have to say  I LOVE YOUR DAD!
Where is that sweater from? Does anybody know?
If anyone is wondering the outro song is Dangerous Girl by 1waytkt
Can someone add all this up? This video is literally thousands of dollars
I've been loving the $10 Snoopy shirt I've been deciding wether or not to buy for a month on Amazon.
She's been looking worse and worse lately....
no way are you actually MAC NC45 when you're tanned..that's my shade and I'm Indian lmao
Omg it's like totally my favourite thing - never worn it, still has the tags 👀
yeah it's such a genius idea to review your favourites and then throw them across the room after you present them
Why am I subbed to Gigi Gorgeous? 😩\nStop forcing your suckage on me YouTube!!!!!! 😡
U remind me of my Barbie cartoon I used to watch
Nats, Gigi and you are so cute together so beautiful,, but too much makeup for Gigi
I like how she just throws her bag like it a ball
I want PR so bad! I would cherish that little mini fridge! It's so cute!!
You can tell she's okd
why did u suddenly turn into taehyung the gucci king lol
Wow im so jealous hmu girl I'm just a broke drunk uni girl xoxoxox love you so much pls someone support and like this
Missed these types of videos from her 😍💞💞
LOL she had to get Mario to send her foundation.. she couldn't buy it herself?
💋💋💋

I just started a channel that involves beauty and much more! I hope you can show some support on my channel and subscribe! thanks love❤️
Omg, obsessed with your makeup look right now!!!! So gorgeous, and the hair, YES!!!!! 💖💯‼️
I thought ur never gonna wear extensions again .. didn't u make a video saying that ?
$145 for a pair of socks.....damn
I adore you, but I dunno if that eye look goes with the bold lip. The bright pink lip kind of makes that lower lid look like you've got bad allergies, have been crying hard, or are coming down with pink eye.\n\nYour eyeshadow is flawless otherwise.
wait, she loves that bag but throws it around like that? she just has so much gucci that none of it means anything XD already turned off from this video, but whatever she doing her i guess
You have awesome things!!!! \nYou are great!!
he keeps looking uglier and uglier. im sure he stopped taking his hormones.
Long hair looks way better
Any small youtubers want to support each other?
GiGi ... pleasssssssse 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 do a tutorial on your eye make up in this vid .. i am so in love with it ❤️❤️❤️ #staygorgeous

Yessss I live for Gucci! Xo from my channel to your's! <3
guurl i love you and actually bought some of the items you showed in your favorites <3 PS: people let her do what she wants and if you think she is materialistic or anything then stop watching her video and go be sad !
Did your hair day  to be on style mermaid very  chic!
anyone else trying to look to see the pricetags price of the knee high socks?
The lips are not feminine they are hideous, you are a skinny Trisha.
Omg you lips look so much better now.
You are looking gorgeous! Love the makeup and hair! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
buying a 1790$ bag is stupid
Can you please get ready with Jeffrey star on his PJ
...bullshit, she looks like a meth addicted pole dancer at a titty bar called Wrinkles & Scars...
Oh my god, those boots are $1,600.... \n\nI don't know why I even thought I could afford them when I saw them. Haha.
Gigi doesn't care about YouTube now that she has that billionaire money. Too booked to be bothered hunnnayyy!
Since Gigi did her lips she just looks less feminine...
For real thought the cat in the back was my cat. Looked over and hes asleep. Damn that cat meows alot!
No hate but Y  she throwing (almost) everything away > showing how much she appreciate the things  😐😐🤔🤔 easy comes easy goes
No hate but her hair looks like ramen noodles
@ Gigi Gorgeous, I REALLY LOVE YOUR MAKEUP 😍
What is happening with the background noise lol? Do you have a cat? Am I the only one who noticed That??
did anyone else hear the cat screaming in the background?
Those sneakers look like something I would have worn when I was 12 ... actually probably not even then lol
When all the Gucci items add up to more then you can budget to spend on yourself in the next two years 😂😂😂
Don't worry, I won't hurt you. Proceeds to throw them carelessly.
does Gigi wear exstentions??
Dye your hair midnight blue!!!😍😍
When she threw the Gucci bag, my college tuition flashed before my eyes.
All of the makeup literally looks like she hadn't even touched them before filming the video...
Wow talk about being materialistic and shallow
Love the boots
ilove you gigi
obsessed with this hair!!!!
i loveeee that tanner its amazing
You look beautiful
nice blue purse
giiiiggiii u need a makeup lineeeeee
You be you gigi

Jakim pustostanem jest ta osoba....
I'm not gonna lie i got triggered when she threw the bag, The OCD Went wild xD
Mexico is in such a bad situation, and this girl is just showing her Favs
Most superficial, materialistic video Ive seen of you..... Dissapointing
Stop throwing these expensive items ! So disrespectful and a ridiculous attitude
Check out my latest video!  😘
I will never for the life of me understand people whom live in excess like this.
So where does her money come from?
Why is this video not available to me?
She's still the same!
okay guys, Tay Tays been absalutely gorgeous/stunning/Hot before but in this clip she is like DROP DEAD GORGEOUS/SEXY AS HECK/OMG IM TOTALLY STRAIT AND SHE IS TOO WHY AM I NOTICING SHES SO DANG GORGEOUS!?!?!??? i wish i looked that beautiful... imagine Shirly Temple at 15 with strait hair and Brown eyes... thts me :(
BTS TAYLOR SHOWS HOW HILARIOUS AND KIND-HEARTED SHE REALLY IS. I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE KEEP ON HATING HER FOR SOME NAIVE MISTAKES SHE MADE IN THE PAST *SIGH*
Why they'll hate the rat?
Taylor Swift is a cat lady
THE MOUSE LOL this is proof the old taylor's aren't actually *dead* they are just inside of her and different
I can't believe she went on that swing! it's so high! I would have been terrified
I don't like how it goes into the video instead of more behind the scenes I want more behind the scenes and for it to be longer it was such a cool video I want to see how the whole thing was made
and the costoom was agly
I DON'T THINK THE OLD TAYLOR IS DEAD AFTER WATCHING THIS!
I love that even though her new album makes it seem like the old Taylor is completely gone, when you watch her creating her videos and talking behind the scenes she's still the same old Taylor we know and love❤️
Miley Cyrus Can't be tamed, sorry.
I can't see it it says the video is unavailable
Did you guys actually think she wasn't going to be her goofy, adorable self anymore? C'mon people, you can't put out that fire.
They actually added the music video......
The mouse and taylor <3
Why do we have to rewatch the whole music video everytime? is it some kind of brainwashing?
that hamster and Taylor form the cutest couple ever\nlike if you agree
awww.. that is an adorable cat.. i mean rat
On camera she looks so serious but off camera she's just,\n\n\nTalking to a hamster likes it's a real person?!
I'm confused... Why did they upload the whole video again? And not just the behind the scenes??
she is the queen of snake, but she don't eat mouse . she is in the next level :0
I wish I was the mouse xD
I love how she came up with the idea of sending the mouse into a training. LOL
Did anyone notice the snake on  her upper right leg in the cage scene?
0:39 or Three times Thirteen seconds in. ... This is why we adore Tay-Tay so much, and now she has a new little friend. The next magic multiple of 13, is 91, the first pseudo-prime, because it looks like a prime, but is not. it is 130 - 39 or 7 x 13. then after that is 169 or 13 x 13. one of the Magic Squares. One, & One are the first two squares, next is Two times Two, then Tree time Three, Five times Five, Eight times Eight, and next Thirteen times Thirteen. 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2,  1 +2 = 3 etc. 0,, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.... The Harmonic Series, sometimes called Fibonacci Series. When a plucked string is divided by this Golden Ratio 55:89 or 89:144, etc. Called Phi. in Greek Numerology. Both strings resonate in musical harmony.... All of life is related to Phi.
bc EVER put the music video??????? is INECESARY
Love you taylor 😘😘 you are amazing 😍😍😍
Why the hell do they keep putting the music video in the BTS???
By way, why they put the music video after behind the scenes of LWYMMD of the birdcage?
WAIT THERE'S AN ACTUAL MOUSE IN THE VIDEO?????
The more you ask for your soul the cheaper you look.  Nice bird cage.  You are a canarie.
she touch a rat
How does Jacksfilms have more subscribers than Taylor Swift?
Taylor is so cute with the mouse ♥
Goshh this video is not available in our country! Ghaaaad
I never realized the mouse
Who's this scene about? The giant birdcage reminds me of Miley's Can't be Tamed, but idk 🤔
We need a Taylor Swift training facility for mice lol
WHY YOU GOTTA BLOCK YOUR VIDEOS ON MOBILE, TAYLOR?
Why can't I see the video😢😢😢
why was there a mouse
That's why I love Taylor, she's beautiful, talented and loves animals
WHY ARE ALL OF THESE UNAVAILABLE IN MY COUNTRY?
The part were she was with the hampster 😂😍
It's not available in Malaysia 😭💔
+1 for the rat and training center :-)
We're gonna have to send you to a training facility Taylor to cute rat - 2017
I didn't notice the mouse until I saw Tay petting it xD
for some reason the video is not available in other countries 😭
...Ready for it part haha
The lyrics for Taylor swinging in a Gilded Cage don't make sense:  You asked me for a place to sleep/Locked me out/ Then threw a   feast.   WHAT!?!     STILL haven't seen an explanation  anywhere.    Any Theories? .....  Anyone?
Why it says This video is not available?!
taylor: old taylor is dead\nalso taylor: your eyes are closing like my cats do
ITS IN EVERY SINGLE BEHIND THE SCENES, she play the ENTIRE music video in them... I hate this.
wtf why they played the video over and over again
So, they made several clips so that they can get more ad revenue, and put the song at the end of each clip so that the video can be long enough to get enough ad revenue?
literally uuugh~ Um. I'm great. I'm good. \n.\n.\n.\nWELL TAYLOR WE'RE BEYOND GREAT RN WITH THESE BTS THANK YOU SO MUCH
Miley Cyrus Party in the USA inspired?
Taylor and Katy finally made up. I love how she featured her in the video!
I AM IN LOVE
The new Taylor might be really weird, but she still loves animals 😍
This video is not available :( whyyyy
i didn't even realize there is a small rat in this song until i saw this vid.
how to make more money = Put  different parts of behind the scenes
Now I'm looking for the mouse.\n\nTHERE'S REALLY A MOUSE THERE!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\nSo adorable!!!!
not available 😢😢😭😭😭😭😭 im literally crying right now
i dont care what people are saying \ni still fucking love her
why the video is down why?!
I cant see it
Damn Taylor., how many more  bird  cages bathtub  screen shots,etc, do you singers have to do. what does that have to do with singing?  or music everyone knows it is  part of that fake illuminati crap. if these second city scam a dollar artist were really illuminati., they wouldn`t be copying the same old bird  cage/bath tub scenes.they would be enlightened enough [thus illuminati~enlightened ones], that they would come up with something new. But the sad part is. With your industries misguided music these days,  artist  have lost a complete generation of listeners., TODAYS GENERATION LISTENS TO OLD MUSIC ON [LP] LONG PLAYING  RECORDS , BECAUSE THEY DON`T  WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS SAME OLE ,SAME OLE CRAP ANYMORE.And the sad part is no one in the entertainment industry is getting it., not even you Taylor. you used to be a singer/ musician. not part of this retarded hollywood circus. Is every Song about halloween to youpeople, 365 days of the year? you would think someone making money and famous , would have something sometimes happy to sing about.hunh?
What does the birdcage represent?
she manages to pull this off so level headed. genius.
why i cant watch it? can someone tell
I love taylor swfit so mush ♥♥ I love your voice
This was my favorite part of the music video
This was my personal favorite scene like LOOK AT THOSE BOOOOOOTS
If you look at her hands when she was petting the hamster, you know she always pets her cats :p
*i just covered the worst cover of charlie puth - attention on my channel, don't check it out. thank youu*
Does this remind anybody of Miley's I Can't Be Tamed?
é sério que o taylor nation barrou a própria taylor?????
http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=73173
Taylor é maravilhosa <3
Sia wants her birdcage back!!

Dona algo$$ para tus fans mexicanos
Em không xem được!  huhuhu
This is Taylor's personal page and you are only able to watch her videos on a laptop or a tablet. So no  phones sorry everyone. But lucky me in Australia I can watch on my laptop so good luck everyone.
Am I the only one who can't watch it?! 😭😭
I WATCH ANYTHING WITH BLAKE SO I WILL BE WATCHING THIS.
For anyone who doesn't understand it:\nGirl is blind and married to guy. She is young and pretty so once she gets the surgery and gets her sight back, she feels more adventurous. She probably doesn't like her husband anymore, and sees her chances with more attractive guys. She turns more independent, until she starts to lose her sight again. \n*dun dun dun*
Kinda been done before.....it's called The ticket😕
She has a thots eye..

Well that escalated quickly...
song please?
Song name?
#♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God & promises you eternal life if you simply believe Him.*\n*He promised to also heal your body.   (Just ask Him)*
Why in gods name would they chose to release this on the day of the Stranger Things season 2 premiere....
Man turns into a man baby after his blind wife gains independence. Seriously. Instead of growing a pair and letting her have some slack you'd rather get jealous. If anything she deserves freedom. But it's obvious this plot will follow a man who prefers to be in control in the relationship. Like way too in control.
Perhaps this kind of dark role every woman plays in their life....
Blind married women gets to see for first time. See's attractive people for first time. Wants to bang said attractive people. Sluts it up. Hubby gets sad. Former blind, but still married, woman sluts it up for awhile, discovers herself but soon finds out that being a ho is shallow and soul crushing. Runs back to hubby. Hubby, as he's a beta male, takes back the slut. She gets to have her cake and eat it too. Very Hollywood. Very 2017. Much feminist. So independent womyn. Wow.
Am I the only one who immediately thought of The Eye from 2008???
love it !!!
Good song by HAZAMA \nhttps://youtu.be/QuufCmRkLns

You'll float too

I'm actually scurred
My Last Duchess
WTF?! Watching!
That's fucked up
Seems very interesting
What
tukin
Can’t wait !
Must see
more trailer https://goo.gl/NHB5rg
People are going to think this is a thriller from this trailer.. Pretty sure it's an existential life-course type movie.
This looks fuckin offit. Can't wait to see it
This plot reminds me of that movie with Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth just that she had amnesia and here Blake is blind
Looks great, Blake Lively is awesome
Blake lively❤️
Who else is lost?
I don't get it.
They already made this movie.. is called The Ticket
Very good by the looks of it . Can I get 50 subs without making any videos. I'll sub back too 👍
Why are all trailers now made creepy? I bet the actual movie is not creepy at all,  the plot makes it sound more mystery
I would say this to my pizza. All I see is you....\n\njokes aside, If you reverse the gender roles and tone down the horror, it might look like the movie The Willow Tree where a man regains his sight (after losing it in his childhood) and rethinks his marriage and life. in the end his body rejects the transplantation and he loses his sight.
Great... another It Comes at Night
I think I had read a book a lonf time ago where a woman gets eyes transplanted and her personality starts to change to that of the donor  and she becomes very paranoid while another person who got a heart surgery also changes in personality and both do a total 180 degree flip... but tht donor was possessed or somthinf so thay thig becomes part of these two.
So she starts seeing and cheats on her husband.
C U C K E D
Blake keeps rising on her acting skills and the quality of her films
What's the fucking plot
Watching this trailer, I have absolutely no idea if this is a horror movie, a psychological thriller, a drama about an abusive relationship or something else entirely...
Bloody chick movie... I was waiting for a terminator to show up... you can take the eyes out of a whore but you cant take the whore out of the eyes
Story of a rotting girl
I wonder how this movie is gonna turn the man into something bad, and the woman into some kind of hero?\nHmmm
He knew once she seen what he looked like and how she looked she was cheating lol
Fucked up version of At First Sight
Every eye movie I've seen was stupid
Sorry Stranger Things 2 is on that day also
the movie will end with him blinding her again to try and get her to stay with him
It can't be thriller without a sex scene huh!?
another marriage is horrible and men are all evil plot, so original

Omg Blake lively😍
It's said that the ideal arrangement is a blind woman with a deaf man. Playa had it half right. Done messed up.
Is Ryan ok with this ?
No need to watch this movie. Eyesight makes her a whore. The end.
It seems the only real hardship this loving couple faces is difficulty conceiving a child but when Gina is given the...\n\nI bet he was giving her Plan B, but told her they were prenatal vitamins or something.
A wise man once said... THESE HOES AIN'T LOYAL
Did the guys over at Explosm Entertainment make this trailer?
She's given a second chance at sight and the idiot chooses to ruin her body with cigarettes.  Classic.
Slowing down a pop song in the trailer  trend needs to die ...
The husband ends up re-blinding her in the end because his fear of losing her becomes too great.\n\n\nOops!   SPOILERS!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, I'M SCARED.
Finally a trailer that doesn't give away the damn plot!!! It looks good
There is almost a  20 year age difference between the two actors...
They should've had Ryan Reynolds play the husband hands down. I'm not saying that you should have the real couple play the couple in movies, I'm just saying that they are already a perfect couple in real life and they both happen to be amazing actors, so Ryan should've without a doubt played the boyfriend/husband role.
Idk her acting is never that convincing to me especially in emotional scenes but looks interesting
She looks like that Blake girl......oh
Looks like after getting her sight back, Serena Van der Woodsen's starting to *see* his true colors. Xoxo, Gossip Girl.
So did she found out she's married to an older man, and she's a young woman taken advantage due to her blind sight ???
So the husband goes out of his way to get her an operation to see again and the first thing she does is fuck some other guy. That's some grade A cunt right there.
why serena still a hoe even after gossip girl...
Woman gets sight and best a whore and then loses sight again.
That turned dark real fast😳
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
Bru I’m pretty amazed that you did all that backwards honestly
Who would want to play this once a year
Sorry im an ignorant, did he created that game?
Guys do not open it. It's an onamori. It's a blessing that is not meant to be opened. It is lost once it is opened.
As much as this is seems a tear jerker, its best to not open the program as it is a Omamori, per this twitter https://twitter.com/sprsk/status/910295200228032512?lang=en
I couldnt get it to work on my switch no matter how much I tried can anybody help me
I've tried this three times and no luck
One of the coolest things I've ever seen.
I need to connect to the monitor and demonstrate it
its not showing a thing there to allow me to change the system time and date
Do you get to keep the game, or is it only playable on July 11th?
That's pretty creepy the way this is hidden inside without Nintendo saying anything about and the way you have to do Iwata's directly to you hand sign,  now now I'm staring at my switch all weird while playing Splatoon 2 LOL.
He died on my birthday.
I can't get it to woek
This legit makes me want to cry.
We miss you Iwata-san TT.TT\nMad respect for Nintendo for that easter egg!
Nar this doesn't work..
You know, I never believed my friend when he said an NES game showed up when he was moving around his Joy-Cons a while back. Interesting to know it was Golf.
This is such a thoughtful tribute ...that is makes me want to cry! :')
How the fuck did you figure that out??
Goat fire brigade'  helps save Spain from forest fires\nhttps://youtu.be/ImFJAw2SnZg
I understood how the 3ds had all types of hidden games, but why would Nintendo make you summon a game?
Cool video paying your respects to him. 👍
i used to rock this game on my nes
Hey that's some pretty good asmr
thank you for posting this.
I did the exact same thing and yet i didnt get it
May I put forward a proposition; you shout me out, and I reciprocate (Do the same)
Oh man, I remember that game.
This is on trending
i'm not crying
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄
I don't say this often for actions made by people, but this is beautiful...
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!

How did someone figure all of this out?
donget it, you just wave your hands around and the game starts?
is it possible to do this without hacking your switch?
Get a pc
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
on my console it dont work :(
fucking moron can't speek? holy fuck wts is this? get cancer and die.
check.  out.    watch.     now.   \nshared.    my.      video.    2017.
This video was made on my friends birthday
Holy moly can you speak or not?
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
I just got a switch and cant get it to launch...brand new but it wont launch
Wow, how did this pass 7/11/2017?
I just want to know how long and how many hand movement combos it took for him to find the easter egg lol...he has to know a designer
Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.
Are you supposed to press any of the top shoulder buttons when you do this?
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!

Celebrating Halloweekend!! and I plan to be Cruella Deville, Daphne Blake, and a dead
Reminded me a little of the good ol' DailyGrace vids. Ah, nostalgia.
Isn't anyone concerned about that 0:03 moment when she said OUR house?! Did i miss something? Is she living with mamery? Some guy? I want awnsers!
Are you related to McGuyver? ..............?
I'm dressing as Veronica Sawyer
For Halloween I'm gonna be something REAL slutty
The only problem with getting Adultolescence on audiobook is you miss out on all the fantastic illustrations Gabbie did for the book! Getcha hands on it if you can. I work for my county's library system and we got a handful of copies in. If you can't afford to buy the book check your library!
I'm being totoro for Halloween ^^
Grace! You are beautiful inside and out! Accept it ladybug 🐞
Was she on the walking dead? That girl named Jessie I think....
I do not know Which was said such a thing to the elderly
Speaking of stream of conciousness, can you read a couple of random pages from Ulysses? I think I'd be able to understand it better with you as a narrator. Or maybe not. You should still do that though.
just play the youtube provided background music and everything will be ok. Jesus, please save us from these typical videos youtube puts on the trending page.
Did you know that you forgot to finish putting eyeliner on the bottom of your eyes? They look kind of funny.
Do you like to eat pizza  if you buy a mixer you can make your own\nPlease do a live webcast-this is real life and you are amazing.

Just talk Grace. I'll listen
I'm thinking about being the Winter Soldier again this halloween

I remember when you started doing stream of consciousness videos on your dailygrace channel, I actually remember the very first one called stream of conshhhhsness.\n\nAlso, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT WHITE HOODIE?
I honestly don't understand what this video has to be on the Trending page.
a very nice video
I listen to your podcast so much I remember parts of some of them by heart and it's sad
I just like the way your mind works. I find it comforting that someone else's mind works a little like mine.
I do need a vacation dad. Are you free this weekend?
Here's my director cosplay: Goose get out of my frame. Goose. GOOSE GOD DAMNIT!!!

You should not use q-tips in your ear holes.
keanu Reeves is 53. wow I'm definitely a pervert coz im only 25 and hv been crushing on him since 14.
Grace your makeup is fucking on point
yes grace, I am having a sucky time in school. Butttt im watching this so how bad could it actually be?
Your dad lied to you, Grace. I'm so sorry. The bats were swooping to eat insects around you / the pool. They don't want human hair and they have excellent flying and echolocation skills so they won't fly into your hair by accident! #freeallbats #batdefense
Bats do not make nests, from hair or otherwise. Your dad was either messing with you or not aware of this. The bats swooping towards the pool were probably swooping at insects that were hovering near the water. ... Bats are awesome, and it makes me sad when people are afraid of them. TAT
Well, stream of consciousness videos are great, because you always manage to subtly drop little philosophical thoughts and insights inbetween. And great jokes of course.
Actually those bat are just thirsty. They swoop down as close to the water as possible to get the fur on their chest wet then they fly to their roost and lap the water off their fur! It's how they drink. I don't think that bats would try to get your hair...lol! XD
For some reason when you said Keanu Reeves is 63 I pictured Shia Labeouf, and that really would be life changing! (but obviously he isn't hahaha)
Im going to be a slut for halloween.
im going as wednesday addams and my friend is going as morticia ayyyyy
Have you microbladed those babies? They on fleek!
Bats dont build nests, and never did or will. I am french
I'm gonna be a BAT for halloween ( watch out for your hair Grace, moahahahaha)
I kept hearing ass burgers love it Grace
6 minute video and 4 minutes of it was plugs..
Found out just yesterday my birthday is the same as Himmler's, after saying, you know that asshole is probably a Libra.
oh shit i just made you click...
Dear Future Grace,\n\nI'm not sure if you're aware, but it appears the ghost of John Belushi may have sneezed cocaine into your tear ducts... or you have oddly placed eye shadow/eye liner... either way, love your content!
because it's authentic. At least it's expected to be.
Did you know that Lindsay Sterling is on dancing with the stars
Bats don’t want your hair. They want the flies (and mosquitos, and other bugs) buzzing around your hair. They’re basically dive bombing the bad things around you like little, flying superheroes.
I gave this a thumbs up just because I thought it was sweet to give Gabby a shoutout
You need to do a tour of your place too.
I love the stream of consciousness videos because it just feels like listening to a good friend blabble abouy blabble which is very comforting in an empty house 👍
im coming out on halloween - going as the babadook
that's moment ay tail you should
I cannot escape the shit
Tell us Gracie. How about grass is green, water is wet, air is very light,  sky is blue. O, and finally, you are a mental midget.
I listen to Not Too Deep when I walk home from work. Excellent use of my time if I do say so myself!
Just realised my birthday is near too! And it's the same date as yours lol
First time watcher. Fyi-I thought you had grabbed an infant, but turns out, I think it was your knee, lol. Enjoyed this! Cya.

Grace:  your Very Hot!  You should do your videos Naked.  Why do you have all that stupid clothing on?   Yes many girls will be jealous and unsubscribe.  But think of all the new male subscribers!!
Wait, so this video was stream of conscious? Then what are the rest of your videos???
any small youtubers wanna support eachother

Envy is a dumb ass.. In L.A./Compton/ more Crips bang on Crips, certain Blood & Crip hoods get along better with each other.
I love the guys, their ambition is at the highest level.
Man I love too see this...  Pls Lord Let more of my ppl come together like this 🅱&♿= ✅✅ 💯 #BlackUnity  #BlackPride
Blood didn't like that book book shit.
So you ride on your own kind for red and blue,wow.
The blood dudes eyes move so damn fast lol he looks everywhere in a split second
Columbus Georgia down with it....
They still have their flags on though? Are they still in or out?
When black people learn that they need each other the better we will all become
Why does the dude next to envy always look like he's out of it? Get that man some coffee or a new job.
this is the most beautiful thing ever
This is amazing. SPANK is the boo!
The guy with the red bandana face, when he said a book book, he wasn't happy
Zero credibility when you say you went to cooking school to get out of gang banging but still gang hanging and repping gangs. Will not be supporting any business like this
I like how Envy is concious of he tells to not cuss 😂😂
Just a regenerated version of the Zealots and Sicarii when we were back in Israel much love.
this is really cool
The fact that they still glorify their gangs by wearing their flag is just pitiful. Get out the life it's what is killing millions of black people. I'm sorry but I can't hear a word their saying because the stupidity they reppin is drowning out any sound.
Spicy mac and cheese! I need that!!
Bra this is super dope big up
He is this ? Chingy and shaq
This is so dope, unity is the key, lets work together and generate profit. time to build IN, and FOR our communities. We dnt need any more of our brothers blood spilled
Damn they need to come to atl w the food truck!
C Tha God with another incognito positive message to the people. My man been making it happen behind the scenes, giving platforms to people who would otherwise never get it. Much respect to the man.
The purpose of these gangs originally was to protect our communities, let's get back to that!
I love this story! Everyone in this world has a gift. It's just up to you to tap into what your talent is. And to show people that we can get along.........wow! Love it!
Luv my people so much.This is gud for the community.
Much love to my brothers from CPT. Keep hustling
Why didn't the guy in the red talk?
CBM all as one I started that Crip blood movement
We got juicy j and Shaquille O'Neal 😂😂😂
Smfh...  Kill each other over colors. But can get past the gang shit when it comes to food? Y'all are confused.....
First of all.......... WE BLACK  - The Future , lets keep it going , Beautiful.
A real breath of fresh air honestly
I bout the book some bhicken right now
There movement is amazing for the City. Salute to these brothers
The bandannas were necessary, I respect their hustle and hope they inspire other gang bangers to put the guns and get money the legit way. But I guess they had to make it visually stimulating for the viewers.
It's clear these two niggas be on some gay ass eating and fucking type shit too!!
This is why people make fun of yall.. Fucking idiots..
I kinda like the concept, especially if the food is good ! 🙈😋😍
Nigga in the background was not feeling it lol
I been fallowing these dudes for min. Shits real. Man y'all do ya thing.
See, THIS is what's up. Something positive! If they open something out here in NY, then I''d definitely be a customer. The food looks pretty good on their Instagram.

In these tense political times We should all come together to appreciate that this video wasn't filmed vertically
third world mentality ...dumb cunts . like living in bradford or any other shithole part of the uk
Water sucks, Gatorade is better.
Ахуэть 😮
Seriously people, moaning that a guy blocked the road, if it were most people you wouldnt give a f**k about any neighbour or person you dont really know, especially duing a life threatening moment like this where every sec counts, you would only care about your own life
The god of mud is angry
Well, Laotians are famous for owning donut shops in America.  oops, make that Cambodians are donut shop owners.  What are Laotians good at?  Certainly not in dam engineers.  I would think the engineers are either Chinese or Russian.  Russians not that good I would think.  (their aircraft suck!)  And the Chinese?  Hmm, ever hear the term Made in China?  Best they call American engineers.
I think I'd have to take that guy who blocked the road with the machinery and throw him over the edge if I survived.
What happened to the stupid fuck who blocked the road and the other two drivers? The cameraman was too stupid filming stuff that wasn't important.
how do I hire this tractor driver?? I have a job i need to get done within 10 years. He's perfect for the gig.
Shut the fuck up
In any state this
That guy that ended up blocking the road, if he survives is gonna get such a beathing by the other blokes 😂😂
Where did this happen? Location?
nice,thats not magma (sorry for english)
Truck guys die?  Seems like they should have just run up hill...
Just sitting over here wondering why this is happening\nEdit: I’m dumb
I hope that guy in the truck is okay...
Am I the only one annoyed that people thing the thing blocking the road is a tractor?
Omg, I hope all those people are ok
The dude yelling and hootin says it all !
wow way to park a road grader in the only escape route, asshole in the red shirt. sure hope one of the people you killed was your boss cause otherwise you are in trooooouble
0:05 The guy leaving the grader in gear should be put on trail for his hideous act. What a complete moron! According to the news, no one was killed in this accident - but that was more luck than anything else, this idiot didn't help the situation.
I rather die in the mud then listen to this awful shrieking voice
No offense but i really thought the title said jiberish
LAVA IS RISING, GET TO HIGH GROUND!!!
FOR THE HILLS, BOYS! RUN FOR THE HILLS!!
Lol...i just saw this on the daily dose of internet lol
Words canno... stupidity... two drivers...even in the moment...I can't...Darwin...incredible.
Anyone else scream RUN from the first look at the video? And continued screaming until it was obvious that people died?
Why is everyone here unrealistically stupid? That you could go faster off of that tractor and let people through without it walking away but now he just had to back it up and block the only way out for cars and trucks
This woman is literally hollering like a monkey 😂😂😂
retarded fucking women all they do is scream for no reason when theres trouble
He is warning of Pizza and Bear Monsters and to vote for Bernie Sanders.
O shit that's a lot of chocolate milk
Get out of the tractor, get in the truck and go....better yet, don't run down the road..go up the hill.
Wtf I didn't know they had chocolate rivers in Laos
(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\n\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\n\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\n\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\n\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\n\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\n\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\n\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\n\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\n\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\n\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\n\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\n\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \n\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\n\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.
That guy on the grader should be shot. Bailing and blocking the road.

Do you agree with Stephen Jackson?
do you guys agree that rachel nichols is delicious?
At least we can all agree now, that durant is a Major bitch, and a Major snake
The Lebron stan says that the Warriors wouldn't win without him, apparently he knows the truth in alternate dimensions lol..  Will this dude ever get of James' jockstrap?  Fucking embarrassing for a journalist.
Yall doing all that hating on kd when he took over in the finals
The crazy thing is this pissed Stephen Jackson off but when KD went to Golden State Stephen Jackson said he was cool with it 😂😂😂 where the fuck is his moral compass this is the kindve guy who would whoop his son for making  straight a's and throw him a party for failing a class this mf is all over the place
KD...move on with life bruh. Don't feed the negative vibes.
Stephen Jackson always on some real shit. KD always on some bitchmade shit.
Had to be a woman 😫
haters.. i dont give a fuck about you
Lebron Durant are both public stars whos lives and DECISIONS are put on display. As fans we have the right to comment on their decisions when it is public knowledge for the world to. know comes with the job when u famous. If you say some shit on fb or twitter and people comment they have the right because u pit that out there. To sit here and say when a public figure makes a decission we should not worry about a grown mans decision especially when that\n Decision effects a league we watch n support not to mention that info is made public so all can have a opinion u sound like a dumb fuck
I have a fake page Stephen Jackson and so do millions of other Americans. To all of you who have created special rules for KD alone. Ask yourself why? respect the man's accomplishment and stop the hate, in the name of Lebron James your Lord and savior let the man enjoy his win.
I jumped on the Golden State Bandwagon when KD went there and always thought people who called him names were being unfair...but after this...I think I'll just go back to being a Lakers fan
I Know This Nigga Did Not Just Say They Wouldn't Have Won Without Him ! Mean While Curry Almost Averaged A Triple-Double Out Rebounding Tristian Thompson . Then Without Kevin Durant 73-9 And Also Went On A 16 Game Winning Streak Man Gtfo . We Won A Finals Without Also .
Bro a 28 year old man claps back at teenage boys with a fake account...Lol
ITS NOT THAT DAMN DEEP!! Damn some of y’all in these comments lame asf
I don't care how you feel about Durant, you have to respect his jump shot...
Stephen Jackson is a real nigga
K.D. is on the verge of a Nervous Breakdown.
He didn't admit to using other accounts. He said he just went overboard on his, which I feel is bs unless you really believe he talks about himself in the third person
Wait he didn't own up to it!? He said I don't use fake accounts to clap back he didn't explain why he was sprain in third person fym
Durant ruined basketball. He is not a real champion. He is a choke artist who took the easy way out. Could yoi imagine Karl malone or John Stockton joining the bulls?\n\nBecause of Durant, the NBA PO had zero competition. Everyone knew who’d win.
Why is this so shocking to people? The guy eventually had to take responsibility for fucking everyone in OK over. And now hes done so much damage and hes realized its all his fault, and at the end of the day im sure he does not feel like a different person or player for winning a worthless title and its all crumbling down around him, he is now forced with recognizing that he created this fucked up situation for OKC, the NBA and people who viewed him as family and he has no one to blame but himself.\nI really do think he planned on pulling a lebron. Going to the warriors, winning a couple titles and then coming back to OKC but he fucked it all up and now OKC wants nothing to do with him the entire league views him as a bitch and hes a joke now.
Am I the only one thinks that's hilarious trolling. I would do that all the time ahaha. But yeah there's comes a point where you take it too far and you end up looking like a Bitch
I wish people would get a life and worry about their own personal lives. its only basket ball not a cure for disease..
I don't even acknowledge KD's ring..that nigga ring is equivalent to a bench nigga..yea he got but he just road the bandwagon to get it
Why everyone hating on kd still? He practiced from a kid put in all the work (all his choices) and is now one of the best in the NBA alone. Y'all sound like his hood acting like he owes you for that one ride you gave him when he was 6.hes a man and can make his own decisions. Haters gon hate. \nHere's my opinion: get that ass off the couch , learn to dribble. Compete. Go pro . Make millions. Turn down millions. It's that easy rite? All y'all acting like women
No he didnt stand up to it like a man. Motherfuckers forgetting that he straight up told us that shit when he was posting from the wrong account. The only reason he came out so quickly was to save his own ass. Fuck this snake ass bitch
That was the fakest apology I've ever seen...
Golden State Warriors did not need KD to win the NBA title. Instead, KD needed the GSW to win his first NBA title; one of the weakest moves I have ever seen in the history of sports, under the circumstances. Namasté. PS: Great athletes, and real superstars wants to beat the best, not join the best.
WAAAAY too much is being made of this... shit!
The Irony is most of the men posting on durant video's attempting to gluestick labels are the most delusional, feminine, mentally degraded, soft an emotional unstable guys with the weakess conviction rate since corrupt cops. For people who claim to hate and have no respect for him, they are ALWAYS there, ALWAYS. At EVERY video about him. Desparate to hear, see and talk about him. Creepy, hiding in the bushes type stalkers.  \n\n#Mentalillness #HeartBroken #Tberapy
Can't make a cupcake without eggs
sound like a lot of bum ass haters!!! eat a bag of dicks!!!
Someone remind KD it's YOUR OWN PEERS that since respect what you did!
THIS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GOT A GENERATION FULL OF SOFT MOMMAS BOYS WHO DON'T HAVE FATHER FIGURES IN THEY'RE LIFE. THAT IS SOME FEMALE SHIT HE BEEN DOING. ALL THOUGH I RESPECT THAT HE OWNED UP TO WHAT HE DID AND DIDN'T DENY IT. HE STILL PUSSY THOUGH AND THE SOFTEST PLAYER IN NBA HISTORY
so now its not a fake account ??
He apologized because he knows someone would have proven this 2 be him .. he was caught no way 2 snake his way outa it
Leave KD the fuck alone! Just take care of your own business, dats what we all gotta do.
That clip from the OKC game when KD and Westbrook were going at it was epic...
What's this fat bitch talking about GSW not winning the championship without KD? They had no problem winning it 2 hrs ago without him.
Yes KD is officially a bitch so get over it
Old people he's still mad because he did the can't beat them join him. Playground rules don't change he'll get made fun of that forever ...sorry
I'm torn at this one braaaaas😏\n\nKev is weak for the way he trashed his boys like that, his coach..., etc!  But on the other hand the guy has CLASS- PURE CLASS for humbling himself and just owning it……!!!  #OfTwoMinds
KD has a ring but is not a champion.  No respect for him.
Just fucken leave KD alone. You guys make it a big deal hes the best player in the NBA next to LJ. He deserves respect. Move on. And im a Laker fan. But respect the sport
ALL YALL DURANT HATERS NEED TO SHUT UP, THIS MAN IS HUMAN AND STILL GREAT
Jackson is a bum so who cares about what he thinks..
Who’s better..... ok then
Who cares what this guy thinks
Kevin, is not happy.  🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀!!!!!!!!
What's to apologize for if he meant what he said? Oh, he didn't mean to say it? In the end...KD is soft. Has been from the start! #eggavatar
He owned up AFTER he was caught 👎🏾
Steven Jackson feels comfortable cooning for his white massa's. Notice how he keeps looking for verification that he's cooning properly. I HATE fucking cooning ass nigguhs! So proud to throw his own under fucking buses sitting on bricks! @STEVEN JACKSON....I'VE LOST ALL RESPECT FOR YOU BITCH! DO WHAT U DO AND DANCE MONKEY DANCE FOR YA MASSA'S APPROVAL YOU BLACK GUMS HAVING ASS PUSSY!
Dude wack as fuck for that Twitter bullshit... Leave Twitter to Trump damn it!!!
We all know Stephen Jackson likes to clap back at fans lol
KD is a certified fuck boy, he knows it in his heart! Soft ass took the soft way out and his conscious eating him up! Sad that u make fake accounts, that's like sending your ex girlfriend text messages from fake phone numbers, SOFT ASS FUCK BOY, that what he is
Tell the quota hire to shut up.
I've seen stephen jackson wear that same gucci sweater 2 or 3 times on this show 😂
Is Brian Windhorst actually on a video that doesn't cover Lebron?
KD ain't a real champ he's just a little bitch
Anybody who dislikes KD for any reason, he’s a champion, fuck off and let the man play basketball, fuck 🤷🏾‍♂️
HE ONLY APOLOGIZED BC HE GOT CAUGHT
This pussy spent all summer arguing with OKC fans I'm dead
No Rachel, he's just sorry he got caught
Durant is a fucking weak ass bitch that couldnt win a ring without joining a super team!! PUNK ASS PUSSY BITCH!! Id slap his slut mother and he wouldnt do shit about it!!
He only apologized because he got caught. Imagine if he wasn't, he'd NEVER EVER feel guilty about saying the things he said about Donovan and his former teammates. So yeah, I agree with Jackson.
Having those lame shoes come out with all the Media insults and then this fiasco occur in such a short amount of time is embarrassing to say the least. He's so soft it's almost unbelievable. OKC was spot on with the Cupcake criticisms
KD don't let these commentators whatever they are fool u you are still ringless in my eyes
Stephen Jackson don't respect kd lmao like who are you compare to kd? A nobody
Great player but like some the great player he has a fragile ego i bet he has only yes men.....
And KD was supposed to take over for lebron as the face of the league 😂am I the only one who notices has been in the gym since a couple days after the finals always posting him working out getting ready getting better...he’s peers aren’t and obviously KD isn’t. This warriors ship is about to be over
Durant is a hoe ...this is too much
who care abt what jackson has to say he s the one lookin like an avatar smh
why the fuk are we talking about a snake? he's not even a top 10 player in the league, the nigga practically had to piggy back ride on the reigning back-back MVP Steph Curry and his squad, who very little trouble getting into the Finals TWICE and breaking winning streak records...stop talking about weak-ass players...
Durant hater bias talk ,/, don't hate! Just appreciate greatness he work hard for that and he deserves where he is now
KD`s a joke of a man
Rachel knows KD is a soft sensitive beta male she just wants to stay on these players good side to keep getting the inside scoop
Kevin Durant is better than LeBron James.  It has to be frustrating that more people don't realize it
this bitch blowing all these nba players dicks
KD needs to move out his moms house ,get married,get some kids,he is too soft
Snake KD needs to grow up!
What I say to Durant is....a True Warrior Competitor never joins the team that beat him...EVER....
This is all because lebron is too good lol..warriors won 1 without kyrie n live, 2nd one with 2 former mvps in there 20's ...thats like adding oljawon to the bulls with jordan,  durrant a pussy n he knows it
KD isn't a champ because deep down he knows that ring was cheap
Stupid non-issuenews like this is why ESPN loses Subscribers! You're so detached from the Real World, you try to create stories, so you can take the high ground, & feel better for all of BS Fake News... I'm sick of the direction ESPN has gone in, & can't believe it's taken me so long to Unsubscribe from this Dead Horse Beating News Station..... Sadly, ESPN is now in the same gutter as MTV.... ADIOS ESPN
Kevin Durant will always be the ultimate negative example. He's a disgrace to this sport, a vile loser without dignity and pride.
i am telling you in the future kevin durant will be so underrated, he will not be regarded as top 5 all time, barely even top 10; because of how he gained his rings. It's one thing scoring and being MVP but its another thing joining the best team in history ALL to get a championship. People will remember that until modern civilization crumbles, and even then their might still whispers.\n\nKevin Durant destroyed his legacy.
Now...which comes first?\nEgg? Or Cupcake?
Rachel, please STFU!
god shes looking so fine
Stephen Jackson hating ass!!
Fuck kd fuck kd nappy head bitch pussy ass bitch he ain't shiii he jus a bitch
Warriors bout to go crazy 2017/2018
The weakest champion ever KD...
SUPER TEAM HERE
He’s a 🐍
KD officially has bitch tendencies.
KD <3

hi hermosa just subscribed your undocumented video came up on my feed and thought finally someone i can relate too!!! thanks for bring awareness to the DACA youth!
You so cute omg 😍
Happy birthday 😊💜
You look stunning! But my aunt previously had sun spots and later found out because of the way she's eating and drinking too much alcohol. So if you change those things in your life it might help.
did anyone else notice she said the hd foundation stick 😂😂
Happy late birthday!!!!❤️ This makeup look 😍
Can you please do a fairy tutorial!!
Omg do a scarecrow or jigsaw like the glam version of it 😭😍
Can you please put the links to the brushes you use in this video in your description box , that way it makes it easier to buy😩

That subtle yes behind the camera when you're applying your highlight 😂

Are daisy and salt still friends 😕
I would be laughed at if I wore make up like that!  No professional or college student would wear make up.
Daisy can you please do a look for quinceanera photos. It would be really helpful mine in coming up in like 3 months. I love you so much please like so she can see this ❤️❤️❤️
Yaaaasss girl 💗 honestly my sister has a channel that she started and girl let me tell you she loves your videos but I love this look so much I can’t wait to try it since I’m a beginner and you explained everything you did so perfect I loved it 💙 if you can do me a favor and check out my sisters channel Melizza Lorenzo  we love you ❤️ keep slayin 😍😍😍💯💯
Putting eyeliner on your waterline damages your eyesight

Glad there is another girl out there who is gaining weight and not hating it! #selflove 💖
I love it. It's really beautiful

Happy birthday me gustó tu historia te immigrant me and my family are immigrants we came to the USA on 2007 me my sisters my mom and my dad were separated I was with my jungle sister my mom stayed with my middle sister and my dad got separated from us
I have sun spots and the doctor told me it's because of low iron and I recommend you go get checked out to see if your blood is good on iron because I was low con iron and had to go to the hospital. So I basically go the sun spots from low iron and I'm 14 and works in the sun so you should go get checked on your blood .
Sunspots are freckles although some can be light most of the time they are dark or hyperpigmented
Do a mermaid make up look
Please do a birthday makeup tutorial! Love you and your channel btw 😘
after you said god damn do y'all see that was that alex that said yes?😂❤
I love your coloring of skin, hair and makeup it is so stunning, you seem so mature for your age.\nDeborah💄
hey Daisy I had sun spots to and it was because I didn't drink milk,  sooo toma leche or eat more at home
u have to go to the doctor they give u this cream i had that
What was that purple spray she used to make her concealer and foundation more dewy
Loveeeeed it Daisy!!!😍 You should try and do a mermaid tutorial for halloween! 😁
You remind me of Miranda Cosgrove. Such natural beauties 😊😍

I am so excited to for the holidays too I love fall and winter my faves
Love this look😍 and happy birthday love you so much😘💗💗
How did I miss this?????!!
my mom gives me sopa de frijoles to get rid of my sun spots , the bean juice helps the spots
i know it's gross but drink bean juice from the can. it really works !
please come out with merch!
Fish oil helps with sun spots it's disgusting but
recreated this look before the tutorial, I loved itttttt. YOU LOOK SUPER STUNNING 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
ATTENTION : I use mother of pearl face and body lotion and it evens out my face in 2-3days but never use a brightening cream in the day wear it at night or it will create more sunspots.
Do you struggle putting on your contacts with nails on?
Wear sunscreen girl that helps a lot speaking from a Lifeguard’s point of view sunscreen has to be on your face no matter what!
This look is everything! Love you x 😊
pls upload a recent skincare routine:'( aaaa skin is popping b
U need a psychiatrist

You almost resemble Jennifer Lawrence in this video!
Im a long time veiwer and genuine uncontested adult grown up, and I have to say, I love how you keep your youtube channel a safe and positive place for kids.

Halloween party inspiration :) Love these looks!
Hey Lex? when you were doing your liner it looked like you had some sort of white makeup sponge or something on your fingers but I didn't see you use it anywhere else. What is that and why do you choose to use it?
I like # 1. &   # 3. The most.
WOW, awesome! You are Rockin the Wonder Woman look!! 😊😊😊
LEX YOU INSPIRED ME TO MAKE A BODY ART / MAKEUP CHANNEL ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Could you do a tutorial for the Sanderson sisters from hocus Pocus?
This is really cool and I was hoping you could possibly do a makeup tutorial on Coraline... but like a creppy version?? You don't have to, just a thought.
What product are you using for the WHITE highlight lines on the lips??? Thx love you
You should do Harley Quinn the comic one
its 3 am right now and I'm supposed to b in school in 3 hours but instead I'm watching this
can u pls do a comic book joker
Hey Lex. I have a question. I was using my skin illustrator platte and I used 91% isopropyl rubbing alcohol. It worked fine for me. Just curious, do you recommend I continue to use the alcohol I'm used? Or should I use something different?
Hey madeyewlook i'm a huge fan so I was wondering if you could respond
you look so beautiful with dark hair, Lex! i'm in love with all the costumes!
look at lex with her fancy new costume! I'm a bout 5 hours away from any halloween stores this year so ill be painting a lot this year!
What a WONDERFUL (eh, eh?) demonstration of how, when one holds a sword, one is compelled to swish it around. Not making fun. I've always loved swords. MANY a imaginary monster fell to my self-made wooden sword when I was a child. Now I'm an adult & have a few of the real thing. Carbon steel, not that cheap shiny stuff that's only good for hanging on the wall. My point is, I understand the need to swish. I really, REALLY understand.
fastest.\nclick.\never.\nlove it!
me, thinking: why does Lex remind me of someone so much today\nI've been watching lots of That 70s show \nShe's reminding me of Donna Pinciotti
Original Wonder Woman?! That's my next cosplay and I could use some help from my senpai!❤️
You are amazing! I got my 16y/o daughter watching this because she is artistically savvy with very little outlet for it. You are a great role model, I'm glad you make these vids. The comic book makeup is some of my favorites. Keep creating these awesome looks...
This video is awesome I love the variety especially the Pop Art.
It's Halloween time and I have no idea what I want to be this year..... soooo..... time to watch literally every one of your videos.
AHHHHHHH this is so good !!!
DUDE THIS IS SUPER COOL I HAVENT EVEN WATCHED THE WHOLE THING AND I'M SUPER EXCITED
Oh my gosh! It looks like you just stepped out of a comic book.
i like the 1st and 2nd looks.
Can u do a Starfire tutorial? She's a red head like you!
this was soo good!!!! You ARE SO AMAZING!!! I do some of you looks for Halloween. My family loves you!!! You are so amazing. OMG! I am your biggest fan!
I just wish I could do even the barest one you did. I try to put on eye shadow and... well it's not pretty.
For Halloween this year, I'm going to be doing a slit throat effect, though I have no idea how to achieve that... Any tips?
Btw Alex have you seen Brian Dowlings book Redhead Beauty?
aahh I love you and this....this is amazing
Hi love you so much
You're amazing! So much talent! the comic book style one is my favorite, but they're all great!
i've never clicked on something so fast
Yessssss!!!! I LOVE THIS VIDEO SO MUCH!!!! YOU ARE FREAKING AWESOME!!!!
Is that costume in Party City?
Lex are you thinking of going to Australia
Imma be black canary from justice League unlimited
This is really nice and she is *really* pretty!!!!!!!!!
Spirit Halloween should sponsor you too
I love this! You look so amazing as Diana
EARLY-ISH SQUAD WHERE YOU AT??
LEXXXXXXX OH MY GOD THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
Thank you for doing this! I love Wonder Women and was so exited to see this video!
I like how you are a type one diabetic I am too
That's such a cute costume! 😍
I like the 3 wonder woman but to me you are the best at makeup and the best artist since you did the dog one.
Where should I get prescription contacts in the crazier colors
Can you do a Daria 4 ways? I'm going to be Daria for Halloween, and I think it would be cool to see a cartoon ish look, as well as a natural one!
I absolutely love wonder woman! Did you ever get to see the movie? It was so good. But the feels 😣
The costume looks so cool! I think I'd probably paint the crown so it would look more gold.
Please do a realistic female to male makeup tutorial!
Wonder Woman was badass!!! Loved that movie.
You should cosplay as Wonder Woman. You look amazing!
this is awesome :D your awesome this is very awesomeness :D lol love you ! Madeyewlook

I cant find it on the site
El-P ain't that skinny tho lol
Waiting for run the jewels bong
I don't see it in the link!
100 ain't enough :/
r u n t h e j e w e l s
you have more than a 100 fans:/
You guys need to make more! !!!!
they should make more than 100 maybe 10K idk
It's already SOLD OUT.
Well I got Gears of War because you 2 are in it, fuck it I'm getting the statue too.
Guessing with 4 k views on this vid alone...all 100 soldout quickly :'(
Wow! Should be a lot more than a 100.
hahaha, that's crazy. I would love to own one!
Ummmmm Can't find it......
I need this shit in my life
the 80's vibe is fucking amazing
aaaaand it's sold out already!
Give me all, please
My wife's making moves to order this for me, she knows me too well!!! #wonderwoman
i have £20, is that enough?
Nooo already sold out, whyyy
Wow that sold quickly
https://www.facebook.com/HipHopCollectibles/
Already sold out god dammit
yes! want!
👉🤛
I'm bout to cop two of each.
Dope. Reminds me of the Madvillain, Public Enemy, Tupac, Biggie, Necro, and other hip hop figurines/action figures etc
Notice how they don't show the faces or full shot that long.  This doesn't look ANYTHING like them.  Misfire.  Just do a facial scan next time and 3D print it out.  RTJ needs to get a new team.
Shout out to (I'm assuming) VICELAND for doing those coked up 80's graphics. #RTJ
Take my fucking money now!!!
Killer Mike talks of peace and unity...then he's okay with being portrayed like Rambo. THIS is the kind of shit that makes niggas seem ridiculous to White folk.
Please tell me why we need these statues? I don’t get it.
from sellout crowds to just plain sellouts
how the fuck do you protect your stomach against pepper x?? man a butch T fucks my stomach - barely burns on the way down though
Sean has a real distinct way of speaking.
My mouth is burning just from them talking about this shit.
Why did he have to add the but i dont know at the end? Does he not know if he is Sean Evans from Hot Ones? No hate, just wondering why uncertainty is the new confidence.
Sean do you go to sleep every night remembering that at some point or another you're going to have to eat a Pepper X?
Other than a novelty, what's the point?
what a crock of shit 10 yrs...stealing another pepper !!
This is Pepper X and it is gonna fuck up your world! lmao thank you for that ending, Smoken' Ed.
The Golden Heat .... just a good name I think
Seeing as the PepperX is the hottest pepper on planet earth, why not give homage to its creator and call it ''The PuckerButt'' ?
Fronto will make some money for you\nDownload Fronto (http://bit.ly/1s6J9aV) and use this code 'NOTOR3' to get 1250 P! Just wake up your phone and get rewarded!
you can hear Shaun's voice getting raspier as the episodes go on lol
What kind of sick bastard would want to one-up the Carolina Reaper?
Why not name it, the hot one.
Ed Currie, holy shit. Now I know The Last Dab don’t fuck around one bit.
Do you guys ship to Germany?
Ate a Carolina reaper in class today.. ended up getting suspended
The last dab should be named sacrilegious sauce
9:51 Nuff Said
Interview Tyler the creator
White Privilege
Keep the name Pepper X. It sounds intense
3:57 Why do you assume that natural is better? Plenty of things that are natural are bad for you or will flat out kill you.
A hot sauce launch party.........
I don't think it's considered 'all-natural' if it's made with cross-bread/genetically engineered peppers...\nnot that I care, but just pointing it out
I like the name Pepper X
for those of you fans of hot ones that dont know. look up Clifton Chilli Club, Iook at their chilli eating competitions
idk if this is actually hotter than Mad Dog's Revenge... sorry guys
AYY SEAN IS ON BEAT AT 1:53  Someone please make something out of this
Pepper X has the same color as those colorblind pictures that show you what colorblind people see
Maybe also sell mini bottles say just an ounce sized?  What will you do once you harvest all the pepper x 's ?  Are you growing more or will that be it until the end of next summer?
How about for the new name for pepper x, The Omega Pepper.....?
Call it The Wolverine, a little play on pepper X
you should interview Rod Stewart sometime soon
I feel like my reaction to this would be\nHow bad could it possibly bAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Have to be honest as a UK viewer, only been watching a matter of months. But I love hot sauces and chilli's .. Sean you are a top person and interviewer, great channel mate..I would love to do that spicy wings challenge! Great vids and content.
name submission for pepper x: pepper mcpepper face
YO LEAGUE OF LEGENDS PLAYERS.\n\nTHE GUY ON THE LEFT SOUNDS LIKE ANNIE BOT.
What about Dragon's Breath Peppers?
Pepper X? Does this have a notch and cost $1000 too?
You need to get Dr Ken on the show
So when are we gonna see you and Chili Klaus eat this beast??
can you please get bill skarsgard on this show?
when will you get plutonium\n(9000000000 Scoville) hot sauce?
Pepper X straight up looks like a nug
I was interested until I heard Mustard. #Disgusting
Sell an assortment of all 10 sauces, in order, so viewers can challenge themselves.
They're 3.18 million now
Dude, eating hot sauce so much must be a thrill going to the toilet.
I think Pepper X is an awesome name, just gives that air of mystery and danger!
I need this sauce in my life
These 30 second ads literally make me slip every video
Finally get to take this challenge on
You should call the pepper the Death Valley Reaper. \n\nHas very self explanatory name 👌
I think Smoking Ed deserves to NAME THAT PEEPER!
I vote to have the name changed to Satan's Banana Pepper
I wanna kiss sean's beautiful bald head
Can you guys get rich chigga on hot ones PLEASE
Nogga I know your booty hole stay on fire
And I can barely eat a jalapeno without practically dying.
i would hate to be sean evans toilet ....
Sean Evans i love your show, every time i watch it makes me wish i was famous enough to join your show. keep up the good work. but if i could make a request? i would love to see your show do an episode on PHO SATE. i love pho, and the spicier the better, could you do one episode where you put your last dab into my favourite meal. or i can go to my favourite local sate spot with your stash and record it for you? please PLEASE do pho sate
can we talk about how entertaining Sean Evans is? He's a great host man
Hope Sean getting a % cut of hot sauce sales
At 4:22 Sean sounds like he's rapping over the beat and it's low key sick
they should name it yellow death
more of this. It was awesome
The only kind of dab i'd use on my haters
At 5:27 you can see the effects of this sauce on a human being...
I love how Sean gets slightly more urban every season.
turn the background music down just a bit for the next one please. ty
I once put pepper spray in my beans and put that shit in my enchiladas. This stuff is like ketchup to me.
I mean... At some point a pepper will be created that just singes your flesh. The chemical reaction will be that you have no skin left...
the last dab. hope no one dies from that sauce. I think Sean wings are rigged insont see him sweat anymore
you just know that assholes all over the world will be pranking friends with this
If I was a celeb, as much as I would like to, I couldn't do the show. Mild Taco Bell sauce is too hot for me. I have acid reflux.
Get Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey on Hot Ones please!
retired like   the result a!lrt anticipate
First, it was the Trinidad. Then, came the Ghost chili. Records were broken when the Carolina Reaper came out. \nNow......PEPPER X\nHOW MUCH SPICIER CAN IT GET FROM HERE.
Send me out there, I'll do It!  I love anything hot!
Or Jesus Juice
Pepper McPepperFace
Should call it solar flare
Rip voice
Just ordered some!
get the plutonium hot sauce
The Bennington pepper
DO MATT STONIE ON HOT ONES
Please get Matty Healy
They should call it peppery mcpepperface
Satan’s testicle pepper.
#buyseannewjackets
Just bought some :D
not the hottest anymore
I care sean - respect
Dab on those haters
Dab on the haters...
Hotter than reaper squeezums? fuuuuuck

WATCH THIS VIDEO. MIGHT CAUSE OF ALL THIS MYSTERIOUS EARTHQUAKE https://youtu.be/tjUiTJiiUBw
My prayers are with you Mexico
SO SAD TO SEE PEOPLE BEEN HEATRLESS. I LIVE IN MEXICO CITY LOTS OF CHILDREN ARE DEAD AND MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING.\n SO CALLED TROLLS HERE TALKING GARBAGE I AM A TEACHER AND I WAS AWAY FROM MY OWN CHILDREN PROTECETING OTHER PEOPLES CHILDREN ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT I WOULD TRY TO DO THE SAME FOR THIS TROLLS NO MATTER HOW MUCH I DISAGREE WITH YOUR WAY OF THINKING.
Ladies and gents this video has a filter, the city view was NOT even close to the foggy image of the city shown here. It was a clear day with sporadic dust clouds in the distance. Leave it to the US to bring terror.
Mother nature tired of human bullshits..spacially muslim and christians
Lets do what we can to help Mexico, the citizens are in need and the aftershocks will come and do more damage
B jack. I agree. If any of these idiots have ever helped with a tragity like this only then will they understand how bad this is and the loss of life is not a joke. The negitive coments come from flat empty brains
Yesterday and today I help taking debris from fallen buildings. Is very touching see the city like this, every body is offering food, water, a place to stay or any kind of help. The help is that much that they are asking stop going to help because we are getting in the way, because we are to many\n..  I saw a person with one leg taking derbis just like me and i allmost cry. We live in a caotic place to live, and we are grumpys allmost all the time, but I can tell you that I've never see people more loveley like I did in this couple of days  (and I know Canadian people...)
That's what the looters get for looting USA.
'Horrific images' *shows some buildings and dust* OK.
Please don't be selfish help us (Mexico) and support use please don't be selfish we are one 💪👬👬👬👭👫👭 #weareone
I think earthquakes are justreally weird and spooky. I really don't think it has any symbolic gesture though. We know what they are
Condolences to those to lost there their loved ones.
God is doing this for a reason for us human being to believe that he is real and that his son Jesus Christ is on his way he's doing this to prepare us for the second coming 😇
Repent turn to Jesus Christ for the remission of sins he is god of universe who will judge everyone
Hmm September is a good month for the media a lot of stuff to report. Good way to keep your eyes glued on the news. Largest hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, floods tsunami, etc. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Because of the solar eclipse!! Look it what is causing harricane and earthquake!
Many serve satan,false gods,andsacrafice to false gods.The WRATH of ALLMIGHTY GOD is coming.REPENT and turn to the real God,before it is to late.The Lord REIGNETH.JESUS Christ is Lord.
0:01 that map image is not Mexico City -.- \nMexico City its much bigger and surrounded by mountains. It also doesn’t have a river cutting thought it
Sept 7 earthquake and after a week they got hit again by earthquake. Wtf
People in the comment section be like I'll pray for Mexico lol why don't you do something that would actually help
I bet Donald Trump is having a party about this.
It’s time for government Geoengineering of extreme weather events to stop. This is immoral. This is murder.
i hope everyone is okay, stay safe and ily all 💕
To much stress to me this last days, thank of god that i don't suffer nothing but it feels horrifying, such a bad experience, i have no feel that much scariness in my lifei
This reporter just said “you are looking at people screaming” 🤔
CHRIST YOU’RE AROUND THE CORNER!!! 🙌🏾
Make sure you have a bug-out location & a portable generator like the Kodiak:  https://youtu.be/OiUUkrof3Yo
I pray that the missing kids are found, the parents of those kids that were lost find peace and those others affected are helped. My heart is shattered and I feel selfish being able to hug my girls and to be able to wake up to a home today. Please be grateful, be sympathetic. This is a devastating situation and to those who have bread in the table share a piece with those in need. My heart is with Mexico, Puerto Rico, Florida, Houston, Africa and other countries who are fighting to get by. My heart may not be plenty but if I could be out there I would be. 💕
Maybe they should build better. I get over 7 earthquakes and our city is fine
why'd godzilla have to do mexico like that
that's a real bs .it happened in the same day that the one that happened in 1985.
0:01 The map is wrong, that's not Mexico City.
Jesus say who is next ?
Amerikkka can't blame this on Terrorist or Muslims
Is this bad business for the drug cartels?
>getting out any way they can\n>videos show everyone just standing around; one guy even walks casually.\n\nYou might be filming a real event but you're still fake news.
This Was Actually Stronger.. 7.1 my Balls.
Where are the so called, Absolutely Horrific Images?
Every year it will get worse and worse. No matter what.
please use motion vibration ( used in car security ) to atleast figure in initial stage that their is an earthquake wether than wasting time with talking to each other there is an earthquake or not
Save the hispanic women!
My heart and my prayers go out to Mexico and to everyone affected by this terrible earthquake. God bless.
Societies are a direct reflection of the people who live in\nand create them. Mexicans created Mexico. Mexico blows for one reason and one reason only. Mexico blows\nbecause it’s full of LOW STANDARDS, LOW MORALS life style Mexicans. Everywhere\na Mexican goes in the world, he can only recreate the disaster that is Mexico. This is because this is what his culture has programmed\nhim to do.\n\n\n\n80% of Mexico\nwants to come to America.\nIf we let 90 million more Mexicans flood our heaving shores, America\nwill become Mexico\nNorth by default.\n\n\n\nMexico\nhands down is the most horrifically dark and corrupt country on the face of the\nearth. Try driving across the Yucatan\nor down the Pacific coast...The government preys on the people and has for 400\nyears. They drive their poor slaves northward so that they can export their\ndiseases and poverty to the US.\nThey want the $26 Billion a year they send home. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf our inefficient and corrupt government actually cared about Americans or the\nMexican people they'd close the borders and deport all the illegals they could\ncatch. The returning Mexicans (who are owed nothing by the US)\nwould probably plunge the country of Mexico\ninto political turmoil and unless that happens things there will remain pretty\ndark. \n\n \n\nMexico\napparently falls into the same foreign policy category as Saudi\n  Arabia. Just as the State Department\nis willing to overlook the gross human rights abuses of King Salman in the\ninterests of oil and “regional stability,” it is equally willing to give\nMexico´s Enrique Peña Nieto the benefit of the doubt even in the face of\nmounting evidence of the repressive and corrupt tendencies of his government\nand his party\n\n \n\nThe State\nDepartment’s most recent report on human rights in the world points the\nfinger explicitly at China,\nEgypt,\nEritrea,\nEthiopia,\nIran,\nRussia,\nSyria\nand even Saudi Arabia.\nYet for Mexico,\nit goes out of its way to protect national elites by locating problems strictly\nat the local level and among narco-traffickers. The report\nalso flat-out lies, stating that there were “no reports of political prisoners\nor detainees” and that the Mexican government “generally respected” freedom of\nspeech and assembly.\n\n \n\nToday, Mexico\nis one of the most dangerous\ncountries in the world, confirmed by the international press and news media,\nwith frequent assassinations and threats against journalists, mass killings,\nsavage public assasinations including women and children. For instance, on Feb\n8, Anabel\nFlores Salazar, a brave, 27-year-old crime and corruption reporter became\nthe fifteenth journalist assassinated in the state of Veracruz\nduring the five-year reign of Gov. Javier Duarte, a close ally of Peña Nieto.\nOver a dozen journalists have been killed in the line of duty throughout Mexico\nsince Peña Nieto took office. According to the free press group Article\n19, the vast majority of these cases involve the direct participation of\ngovernment officials.\n\n \n\nIn addition\nto direct violence against journalists, government censorship of the media has\nincreased. A long list of independent journalists are excluded from radio and\ntelevision for their anti-government views and Mexico's leading radio news\nanchor, Carmen Aristegui, was arbitrarily fired, apparently on direct\norders from the office of the president.
is it a coincidence that all of these DISASTERS are happening right after one another????
*This has nothing to do with global warming, it doesn't exist* says -
Wake up people! This is no fluke. Another earthquake on anniversary  of 1985 deadly quake 30 yrs ago. The lord is coming he told us when  these things began to happen then is time to look up be ready. \nMay peace b with u all. And prayers going out to mexico much love. Be ready be prepared have faith. Much love
That's one way to get all the rats out of the buildings. Sadly, now the US will invite the entire population of Mexico here, for the entitlements and free housing.
My prayers to the dead ones may they rest in peace, and to all the injured ones hoping they get better asap. \nPeace,love and support from the mideast,Lebanon❤
An earthquake strikes on the anniversary of a much larger one while they were doing an earthquake drill!!??  This can't be a coincidence.
For people of Italy , be prepped for the earthquake, you are the next don't ask how do I  know that  but I want you remember that I already warned you, it will be strong as you never seen before
This is what happens when we frack Mother Earth for oil companies. Mother Earth responds back like this and people still vote for Republicans and Democrats in the USA knowing they that both political parties are pro-fracking🙄
God bless all these people
that's what the people think u will see,ur lost in this world with everyone else
man is the world really gonna end
Prayers and thoughts and strong hope for these poor people...♥️🙏🏼
My prayers go out to those affected ...Mexico with the earthquake and Puerto Rico with the hurricane my prayers go out to both countries ...🇵🇷🇲🇽 stay strong ...God bless everyone
Beside of the earthquake problem, the government, the politicians, the soldiers, the marines  don´t have a organiced plan for keep peolpe alive and in good contidions, they are killing us. They forbid us (common people) and rescuers to help the injured persons. We are organiced, they aren´t. We are helping, they award themselves the donations of medicine, food, water, etc.\nThe consecuences of  earthquake are not only in Mexico City but in other states, in far villajes tha affects to millions of people that are invisible for interational viewers. \nIt´s a real fact here in Mexico and the government are not with us. it is not only a media event for you to pray for us, it´s a political problem, but mexican people are united.
An earthquake with a category 5 hurricane in the bottom corner.....it's the end times!
Love to Mexico from America.
People was depressed by 2016 and 2017 was even worse god bless god bless god bless spread love there is no time for hate ❤️❤️❤️
Is New Mexico ready to rock!? 🤘
México sigue de pie!!   ...-
Pray for Mexico
MSNBC showing this clip. Surprised they aren’t blaming President Trump for the earthquake.  #FakeNews  #BuildTheWall  #MAGA
Pray for mexico please :( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fyAo323iUmI

and yesterday JAPAN
Wow..
My heart with México #FuerzaMexico
You are excellent
Dios mio
What concerns me is that there is no news coming in from Puebla.  Puebla is a huge city and quite near the epicenter of this earthquake.  No news from Puebla in this case is very bad news.  My grandfather built a beautiful university in Puebla and I would really like news from Puebla if you can get it.  Any advice would be appreciated.
Wish all the corrupt people in Mexico die in that earthquake
Well Mexicans you're going to need them wetbacks we are going to send back to you you should put them to work
Give money for support? Can you imagine...building a wall after this? So you suffered through a devastating earthquake? Good. Stay there.
Viva Mexico #fuerzamexico
It's time for Mexicans to go back home and help.
Isn't Mexico supposed to look like that always ?
FInally Real news . . .     All the FAKE news from MSNBC has left me untrusting of the Fake News Industrial Complex.      FYI  I did have to confirm that there was a earthquake
where am I going to get my tacos now
FAAAAKE NEEEWS!
This comments just made lost even more faith in people...comments saying we deserved this for stealing american jobs (which doesn't make sense because we live in Mexico), or because we are too much, or people literally calling us sub humans just make me sick, americans forget that this can very likely happen in their own territory (San Francisco) and that mexican people have always helped when it's needed
Happy anniversary .
Earthquakes, hurricanes...what else?
Lmao mother nature did something good for once
So this wasn't a kourtney diet
Hahahah... literallllly so good. That was funny.
Did you lose weight, did you feel more energized? Changes in skin?
Candace, I loveeee watching your channel. You're such a Normal down to earth person! I get a kick out of all your videos! Keep it up!!!
i liked this video however I really wish you would have let us know how much weight you lost or if you had more energy or less energy if you felt hungry a lot. ya know just some stuff we would want to know so we could make a better decision about weather or not we would like to try this diet. I kind of felt like it was a waste of time only because you didn't mention that i don't know how to feel about it other than its easy for people who can't cook.
if she doesn't eat dairy then how can she put mozzarella in her salad?
Kourtney said she doesn't consume dairy, but her signature salad had mozzarella?
No dairy diet right for Kourtney. How about that mozzarella cheese? What is that? Avocado and spinach smoothie with cashew milk is the best. Also that salad was way too little.  Have to say no one us know how she really eats. I'm seen her eating chicken and salads so that's not a weekly thing. No one could eat same thing every day.
Why do you sound like Miranda Sings though? #ChilliStillLoveHer
The food seemed kinda bland...... good for sticking with it! Also 6:45 was the most unconvinced It's good I've ever heard.... :-D
2 minutes in and i just got to say going gluten free doesn't just apply to people who have fad diets, although people misinterpret it as one. I'm gluten intolerant/celiac and found out the day after i finished 9th grade after having it tested, anything over a 10 means you need to go gluten free and i scored a 22.... unlike going vegan it usually is not a decision you can make, and there is testings to see if you are intolerant or not. You obviously don't understand what gluten free is when living in LA, it is like lactose intolerance you have to switch to another source to get what you took out replaced. When i first went gluten free i was mad because of the little options 6 years ago in my area and I couldn't have many things which caused me to have bad cravings because I wasn't getting enough carbs and filler in my diet. I however was a good cook and researched how to self sustain my diet by making bread, desserts, and pasta leading up to being able to make anything i want and nobody else can tell its gluten free. Its not something to go half assed in and if it wasnt for my illness, which I've had for 8 years and am now paralyzed, which means if I were to consume it i could potentially die or get really sick due to the fact I haven't had it in years and my body had just learned to live with it and now can't process it, hives and bloating being the least of my worries. Stop treating it like a diet craze and just because you can have it doesn't mean it doesn't still affect others. Its available because it is a necessity not because it will cure your weight troubles.
How many calories does she eat in a day?
You didn't do 100% organic though
Omg. I am also gluten free dairy free soy free and my shakes taste like milkshakes!!! Ask me if you're interested or find me on Instagram! @jaimiecass
Can we talk about how naturally beautiful she looks at 6:00
Her diet looks pretty good, but I definitely prefer more carbs. Good for her, getting on those greens in!
I don’t know why but I felt like she started to look like Kourtney towards the end of the video, is that just me ?
Your Kourtney voice is spot on, that's hilarious! Great video!
Says she's dairy free\n*eats mozzarella cheese*
That was hilarious🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣howww you diddddd her voiceeee laughed so much
Woah u look a lot like kourtney
Mozzarella cheese is dairy !?!?!?
She changes the recipes SO much!
Good on you for not drinking that gross bone broth!
I LOVE UR HAIRRRRRR
Everytime you made kourtney’s voice it cracked me up 😂
She said mozzarella cheese for the salad but I thought she was dairy free?
Also for those with gluten intolerances, try tamari sauce instead of soy sauce.
Where did you get Kourtney's recipes from?
This is super random, but I wanna know if anyone else sees it! I think Candace resembles Jeana from PVP, especially with the makeup she wore from 7:22-7:56.
Mozzarella... has... dairy in it
she got her boobs done so she has gone under the knife
You said mozarella cheese in the salad...but that's dairy.
Can this bitch stop doing weird shit to her body lol
avocado and ground omg I'm dying. NEW SUBSCRIBER hahah
How does she not eat dairy but her signature salad had mozzarella cheese???? Is she not aware cheese is DAIRY?  LMAO (laughing at kourtney not you girl) 😜
Do her kids do the bone broth thing too?!?
you kind of look like her! Also, it seems that by the end of the week you lost a little weight?? You look healthier anyways
Are you aware that bacon causes cancer, ask the World Health Organisation.
Fasting is actually really good for your body and health
i hate her channel but i always come back to watch more
My daughter can't drink milk but can eat cheese and yogurt
It's not that I didn't like the video, but I had to thumbs down it. Us Kardashian lovers don't take too well to hate lol
Even tho I'm white as hell even I was seasoning lol 😂
I really noticed tht u looked more refreshed & less dark circles around ur eyes. just really refreshed!!
Look really cute with your hair in the side ponytail (5:04)
You actually look at lot like Courtney. I'm not a big fan of the Kardashians, but I do like Courtney. She's my favorite. :-)
They make soy sauce that is gluten free. Try Tamari
You look just like Lily from Clevver style
Dude I thought this was a buzzfeed video, I know that she was in buzzfeed but the thumbnail was so much like buzzfeed's
It's like America - Kardashians .British -Queen
It was suppose to be Kourtney Kardashian not Kourtney Kardashian'S
Plugging it in helps lol This was a fun vlog! I love eating vegan, it is my favorite way to eat so far.
How is she dairy free when she eats eggs and cheese?
Mozzarella in her signature salad? Isn't she dairy free?
literally couldn't have half assed it more
I thought she was going to say how much weight she lost tho
Lol no one ever knows kourtney kardashian is or what she does
Tofu? Really ?? I'd rather ear heated up dog shit
Kourtney Kardashian is dairy free but eats cheese? That's a dairy product
i just saw that she works at popsugar
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS A BUZZFEED VIDEO FROM THE THUMBNAIL
One of my friends who is allergic to gluten told me that soy sauce that is produced in Asia is gluten free most of the times. Only the ones they produce in Europe (and probably the US aswell) contain gluten for some reason.
Was I the only one who saw the blender wasn't plugged in
Soy doesnt contain gluten but gives off a similar effect to gluten when ingested into the body... as far as I'm aware.
Your skin looks so much better after that diet!!
Ew how can anyone eat avocado like that!!! With chocolate?!
She's dairy free but mozzarella for lunch? 😟
Maybe I just haven't seen enough episodes but every time I see her eating on the show she's just poking her food around and having half bites and throwing most of the meal out. Not sure if following her recipes really counts as following her diet :p I'm not suggesting she's starving herself - she's eating very often, just only tiny bits at a time.
7:23 YOU LOOK SO GOOD! You should do your makeup and hair like that more often
There’s no reason to go gluten free if you don’t have to
Mozzarella cheese is dairy though ...
How is mozzarella dairy free?
Could you try a Vegan Keto diet?
How is mozzarella dairy free?
Try Chef AJ's diet.
I love Kourtney!
Up your avo game, Kourt!
#666, and no shame! :O
you're so boring :(
this was bascially her eating salads, avocados, coconut milk, and coco powder
omg you look so pretty @ 7:29 !
YOUR HAIR
wait dairy free but had mozz cheeze??? im confused
Ehhh... this video suck
Up your avo game kourt!
So awkward/cringey 😄😂
Aren't eggs dairy 🤔
uhm meat is not sustainable
Her eyebrows are very uneven
7:50 😂 the vocal fry
I like your positivity. Shines through.
after watching this, iv realized kourtneys diet is trash in all honesty. i would never eat like that. unhealthy af. and boring af.
Hey errybody I'm dieting like a celeb for a bit. Anything for views! I'll gain all weight back when I'm done because that's what happens with diets. Do de do dee do.
No dairy but she still eats meat? Kourtney is weird....
did you loose any weight ? lol isn't that why we diet? lol
There was a boiled egg in that salad!!!!
She can't be dairy free and eat a kit kat, wtf
kourtney got a boob job
WHERE ARE THE CARBS?! I'd be starving on that little amount of calories and carbs. And I hope her kids get a higher carb intake as their brains need the glucose for energy for school etc.
Please keep the pink hair 🙌
Every time Emma says something a bit dorky and just quietly runs away, I absolutely crack up with laughter😅 I actually love her little quirks, a candle filing system.. I can definitely get on board with that! 😅 xx
😂😂😂 This vlog made me laugh out loud, thank you!  You two are the best people to go shopping with.. even virtually! 😂
OMG WHEN THAT KITTEN STUCK IT'S TONGUE OUT! I CAN'T COPE! ❤❤❤😛😛😛
How about something gym related for Liam. I don’t know gym things but I gather from your vlog that he likes to go to the gym. Maybe a fitness tracker or some new trainers, gym clothes, a really cool drink bottle i don’t know
Idk what is it this week but Louise u just look FAB! Love love love
Your voice is so relaxing! I love watching your videos! Love you so much Louise :*
Honestly Louise is so brave after her horrible experience before giving birth.  This is especially because Darcy's birth is the only birth experience that Louise has had.
I love the little bit with Too Good at Goodbyes by Sam Smith :)
Pink is so your colour 😍 💕
it's a 7 foot tree molly omg i remember their video ahaha
The pink suits you so much, it looks great!!
Wax out of containers - put in the freezer for several hours. Bring out and tap wax gently with a butter knife to break into pieces. Remove pieces and clean with hot water. Done and done.
Oh girls you have made my day. Ive just had jaw surgery and I can't laugh and shouldn't try. But you both have just made me laugh all through this video 😂
You are so beautiful!
Beautiful pink hair what dye did you use ? X
Oh my god I love your hair
watching Darcy's personality develop over the years is such a joy!
Ah I love your pink hair it looks so gorgeous!
I watch all the weekly vlogs but particularly enjoyed this one! :)
Your hair looks gorgeous Louise! Just wanted to comment and say thanks for being so honest, we all have worries and will obsess over them if it’s something important to us, the internet is very much about portraying the perfect life at the moment which is great and inspiring but I really admire and relate to vloggers that are honest about how life really is with all its ups and downs! X
Me my cousin and my nan do a puzzle club! We gather at my nans on a sunday and have a roast dinner and then do a puzzle!! Love it x
Got to love a good speed-clean. I've been really enjoying your weekly vlogs, Louise, probably my favourite videos. Three cheers for the soft office!
usually I don’t like vlogs, but you are the only person I can watch and laugh out loud to 💙
Must be six times but I'm about done having to bloody stop and start lol! YOU LOOK GORGEOUS! AND MAKE A PTSD VIDEO!
A candle filing system 😂 so do I!! Finally someone who gets it haha x
This happened to me as well Louise. All I can say is that as awful as it is.....it will go away. Im sorry you are having to experience this. Xoxo
hair is very pink and cute kittens!!
For a present idea for Liam: for my boyfriend last year I got him a personalised wallet with his initials on (from notonthehighstreet.com) and also a little cute metal insert (also from notonthehighstreet) with a lovely message on to keep inside :)
Please don't apologize for talking about things that are happening in your life, even if it's not 100% happy. Save the filters for Instagram, we come here to see your real life.  :) Also, you might be experiencing some depression and anxiety from pregnancy hormones. It can really mess with your head. Sometimes it goes away after baby comes, but sometimes it can linger. Either way it's a good idea to talk to your midwife about it so she can help.
I had the exact same thoughts when i was expecting with my 2nd! X
put the container in the fridge :)
'What do you think of the red vibes? Does it make you feel like your about to get murdered or are in a brothel?' 😂
I love the pink hair!
Hey Louise, I'm 34 and maybe one of your oldest viewers but wanted to comment and say I love your videos.  Been watching you for years (that sounds creepy....) but I am also training to become a counsellor at the moment and I loved hearing you found CBT helpful, counselling really is amazing and I highly recommend it to everyone! Luv u x
Put the burned out candle in the freezer. Wax will pop out x
Love the pink hair it really suits you  I'm a new subscriber love your videos xx
Where is your lovely black and white star jumper from Louise? x
Put the candle in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour....When you take it out it should have contracted  and will fall right out. I just did one the other day, it took mine about an hour.
put boiling water over the candle and then scrub after a bit to get the wax out!
As someone who uses candle glasses for drinking glasses (poor student life lmao) pour some boiling water into the glass and then set it in a bowl or a sink with hot water until the wax loosens up and you can basically take it out then wash it multiple times
You should be feeling really good for talking about ptsd after birth. It's really important for women to talk about, we want women to have a positive birth experience. Just remember you can do this 🙌🏻
that emma lady seems like a nasty person?
You always apologize for saying negative things but it makes you a real human if it was all rainbows and candy floss I would think you were a phoney, I have an almost 6 year old and pretty much had to stop watching the news once she was born, I can definitely get caught up with worries that are mad. Always appreciate your honesty!
Hi Louise - this'll probably get lost in the sea of comments but I'm 18 years old and I suffer from PTSD from when my fiancé went into hospital and I know how horrible this illness is and how much it can affect you - I think my top tips are to ground yourself and to know you've got over this once before and that you can again!! It's hard to stay positive but it's all about the mindset and you control your own brain - thank you for talking about it I feel better knowing I'm not alone <3
Someone's probably already said this but I put any sort of wax in the freezer to get it out of the container. If it doesn't pop right out after tipping it over, you can use a butter knife to lightly break it up into a few pieces! 😊
How do you tell the difference between the kittens like they are full on identical 😂 (and totally adorable!!!) ❤
I LOVE you, Louise xx
to remove wax from a candle you should put it in a freezer and then get the wax out with a knife :) never done it myself but i saw Ingrid Nilsen do it in one of her vids
@brummymummyof2 I have a candle filing system as well! I thought I was the only one!
*Liam present* how are one of those picture frames that have scan 1 scan 2 and now I'm here for him of baby pentland and maybe a experience day somewhere
I adore the mad af cat woman vibe you've got going on. This is very #goals
Hi louise, by the sounds of it I had a similar birth of my first child also 6 years ago. I have just had my second baby 8 weeks ago and the birth was totally different and much more of a positive experience. Just wanted to reach out to say every birth is different. Message me if you want to chat x
I could never have children I would definitely not trust other people because they definitely don't have your best interests and your being completely rational about this
I need a video on Emma's candle filling system 😂
LOVE the pink hair. And I agree with Em - you are doing a WONDERFUL job. Also love the mini Si quote at Homesense! xx
Love this vlog but did anyone feel like it ended abruptly?
an idea for the baby name reveal, you could carve her name into a pumpkin for halloween then put a candle in? just a suggestion x
I think the best way to get someone a good gift is to note in your mind what they want or need. For example, I had no idea what to get my step mum for her birthday this year. But when I visited her she was complaining about having too little mugs, and that they were black on the inside so she couldn't see when the tea was brewed to her taste. I remembered that and got her some cute ones with white on the inside. She was thrilled! For my boyfriend's birthday, I got him a nice sweatshirt I thought would suit him, and a fancy chocolate powder drink I saw him pick up in the store. It was too expensive for him so he didn't get it, even though he wanted to. He also lives outside my city, so he travels pretty much every weekend for 3-4 hours straight to see me (we both study), so I got him a traveling pillow so he'd be more comfy. So if Liam wants or needs new nice clothes, I think that would be the perfect gift!
Velvet Teddy has never looked good on me because I'm Blonde, but Honey Love which is a similar colour looks fab!
I love how your vlogs are such a mix of emotions and discussions about things that you are going through. I agree it is so important to talk about how you're feeling so they are an accurate portrayal of real life. It's why I watch you religiously 💜 love your hair and the kittens just melt my heart! And finally, to get the wax out of your old candle jars, fill them with boiling water and the wax will melt and float to the surface. Then you get a clean jar and a wax melt that you can use as well. It sometimes takes a couple of goes, but it does work.  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
To get the wax out you just have to freeze the entire candle and it should pop right out!! Love you Louise <3
You have the best sense of humour I've ever witnessed aha
Is Liam into cars? You could get him a supercar racing experience, I got my boyfriend that for his 18th several years ago now, you can pick how many cars they drive and what ones - he always talks about how much he loved it! I found mine on Red Letter Days! Hope this is helpful :D
I love mildreds, they do good food and cocktails
No judging here I love puzzles!!!! I was going to get a Disney one too the other day now you've convinced me I really should!!!
This is my favourite weekly vlog yet! I laughed so much at the Home Sense section!xxx
great product and great price. you can use Argan Rain Shampoo safely.  you can thank me later.
My hair is slightly more purple than pink but it's still pretty colourful - can I join the pink hair gang?
This vlog is so pink, I love it :D
Put the candle in the freezer and the wax should just pop out with a knife. I've done it before with melted wax on trays and it works really well.
Why u celebrating Halloween so early? Xx
You can look on Etsy for gifts for Liam. They have many sections that can guide you
Why don't you buy liam a trip away for you 2 before the baby comes and give it to him early then on Christmas give him little bits x
would love to hear more about hypnobirthing and other methods/syratgies you're using to feel calm
You are beautiful Louise ✨ Lots of love 💕
Maybe you could get something from Ted Baker which would suit Liam. Xxx PS LOVE the hair

Anyone know where to get the Lego? X
Vlogging whilst pregnant is nice for the baby too :) like, you're sharing your day with us but at the same time bump can hear your voice :)
May be a little bit of depression/anxiety type thing, maybe talk to someone just to reassure yourself a little? Even just a friend?
What is CBT?
Love the hair! :)

What happens in CBT? Xxx
wheres zula
Counselling? I go regularly so things that keep coming to me & upsetting me can be dealt with before it gets any more. I had postnatal depression so have to keep on top of my low moods.
If anyone has any advice for feet sweat please hit a girl up.
Much respect for making this video. I deal with excessive sweating as well. Almost a coincidence you made this as I've been researching ways to help with it.
I would do the jacket thing! But would definitely sweat through the jacket lol
If you wash your armpits and it still smells badly it's because of bacteria that regular soap doesn't get rid of. Try using a bacitracin ointment on your armpits and you'll be smelling like nothing for days! Bacitracin kills the bacteria.
OMG thank you so much for being comfortable enough to talk about this. I am sooooooo going to try the corn starch trick. THANKS 😍😍😍
Thanks for this, I just found out I have hyperhidrosis, and it makes me super self conscious.
Where is your hair from?
i have excess face, hands, and feet sweating and its the worst thing in the world bc i be dancing at parties and everyone is like uhhh girl why u so moist JDSAKJADSKIDAJDS
Nope. Tried Botox. Didn't work for me. At all.
I have it too :/
As a kid, I had the jacket security blanket thing too :/ but cotton and antiperspirant are lifesavers!
Best video EVER!! Thank you. So informative.
< The curse of hormonal underarm hyperhidrosis, a.k.a. satan's balls. \nSomething very helpful to try periodically throughout the day, In addition to (or maybe even in lieu of) your usual antiperspirant: \nThoroughly wipe and clean affected area with 91% alcohol, followed by a liberal dusting of baking soda or corn starch.
You guys! Use Shout on your pit stains, just spray it on the area before you put it in the washer. Your shirts will look brand new. You're welcome ❤️
oxybutynin girl that stuff is a miracle
My whole body sweats like C R A Z Y. Not just my under arms, it's my back, my head, my face, my everythinggggg. Even my couchie. \n\nIt's all long 👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾😩😩😩
I HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH THE QUEEN NO PAPZ PLEASE
Both of my parents sweat profusely and I unfortunately do too. It sucks when I sweat like a mofo on my face and when my hands get sweaty and boob sweat and I just sweat all over. It is horrible. Certain dri helps me out a lot. It works wonders! I swear by it! I have not had to worry about my underarms for about a year now! I also have learned, like you said, to just think positively and not let my anxiety control me. Thanks for this Jackie! This truly did help! xoxo😘💕
Jackie you look amazing in this video
I sweat so much too. I thought it was my deodorant for the longest time. I tried everything. Only one deodorant has stopped the smell and my sweat takes forever to break it down
Thank you so much Jackie for talking about this, the video is so helpful. It's so embarrassing. Well, I stumbled on something called 'sweat block' on Amazon and it works wonders in addition to my sure anti perspirant. Also I sometimes use a sweat pad which I bought on Amazon as well.
FINALLY somebody has addressed this, I don't feel alone anymore. I'm a dancer and sweat so bad in my face like 2 second into the warm up I'll look like I've been swimming it's so embarrassing
Jackie im in the med field....lawyers and public speakers do botox under the arms for that....Dont go to botox parties though...GO TO A DRS OFFICE OK?
do you have any tips for feet sweat when wearing heels because everyday sor school i have to wear heels and my feet would always sweat. it's a nightmare :')
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼bless you for making this video. Not only was this super helpful but it also makes me feel SO much better about my hyperhidrosis. My girl JACKIE AINA has it! I will never feel bad about it again 💞💕💞💕
Hunny omg I had hyperhydrosis, I got the sympathectomy surgery, and hunny let me tell u the T. Bitch dont do it, all my fucking swear goes in between my legs and my back and my side, and it stinks bad if u don’t tain or clean it very  very often.
i have hyperhidrosis too girl i got it so bad, arm pits, feet, and hands and lemme tell you having my hands POURING sweat when i'm getting my nails done is so embarrassing
The weather is getting warmer here in Australia, which means I'm about to get extra sweaty :( My hands and feet get so sweaty and I've tried Driclor which is suppose to be really effective (I think it's similar to Certain Dri, we don't have that one here in Aus). It doesn't work though. I've also tried multiple anti perspirants from pharmacies and supermarkets but they just don't seem to get the job done. \n\nIt sucks :(
My husband has hyperhydrosis on his hands and feet and I have a pet peeve about wet objects/limbs so I can't touch his hands (hold them) and when we cuddle I have to keep my feet away from his. I think I might have it in my arm pits because I notice that I sweat profusely for no reason sometimes. It's hard and it makes me feel bad because my hubby is really affectionate with me but if he's sweating I won't hold his hand or let his feet touch me because of my mentality where my pet peeve developed. I want to try to help him because he has a greater chance of catching athletes foot and other problems. Plus, he likes basketball and being active in general (personal trainer) so his sweat will destroy his shoes. It really sucks.
PALMS and underarms!!!! thanks so much for this girl!
Yayyy I'm not alone. OMG I felt every word you said. Love it girl!!
Wow thank you for this! I sweat a lot & always bought deodorant not reading to see if it was antiperspirant!! Thank you
omg thank god you made a vid about this. I'm always so embarrassed about this
Thank you for posting this video! It’s embarrassing to talk about, but it’s clearly helped so many people! I didn’t know this was a thing, or that there were so many other people! Keep doing what you do! ♥️ and stay beautiful
I was diagnosed with this back when I was 18 and got a prescription for Drysol, been using it for 13 years now and it is the only thing that works for me.
My problem is everywhere above the knees, but mostly my back, armpits and under my breasts. And it's only gotten worse as of lately. I've worn nothing but white t-shirts for the past 2 years. Even during the winter. If I wasn't insecure about my flabby arms I'd wear white tank tops instead (although I do wear them around the house). It sucks that I have so many pretty colorful shirts in my closet that...not only can I not wear, but also growing out of (as far as weight gain). They're literally sitting in my closet collecting dust and going out of style. All I wear is white v-neck t-shirts & sweatpants. When I go clothes shopping it's all I buy. White tees on top of white tees. I love my white tees, but damn, not everyday. This shit is ridiculous 😔.
Yes Jackie! I have the same condition and use Botox and I love it. It helps me save the majority of my clothing lol. Thanks for sharing this video!! Love ya girl xoxo
Girl you are not alone! I had to get that from my momma as well.
I have hyperhidrosis too! Thank you for speaking about this!
Just because of that that a like winter. A lot os clothing and big jackets. Summer clothes with my under arms problem its not funny.
Something that helps me is wiping away sweat with a paper towel vs cloth. Rubbing a cloth across your face keeps you hot and a paper towel keeps you cooler. Try it!
thank you for talking about this!!! my underarms and hands are always sweaty. what kind of Dr can you get them meds for it from? I need them so bad
Very helpful tips. For me the older I get the worst it gets. I sweet between my legs. Powder helps for few hours. I am at the point of bringing two underwear to work. At some point I thought I had tuberculosis but I dont. I read that using panty liners will just make the sweeting worst. I never thought about medical way to solve that issue but now ....
I have that on my hands at least you don't shake hands with your armpits
Omg thank you so much, I was literally just diagnosed with this a month ago, was like tf?! But thank you so much for this video 😊😍
I thought it was just me all these years. I can literally go back to my high school pics and I have pics where my underarms were soaking wet and this is during the winter time 😩 I asked my mom if she has this issue and she was like no so idk who I inherited this from. It’s totally embarrassing and it does stain my clothes 😒 thanks for the tips though at least I know I’m not alone
Wooowww thanks so much for getting out of your comfort zone! This is going to be a gaming changer 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I wanna thank you Jackie for this vid because I've been struggling with this since middle school. nothing like sweating in the club from dancing or sweating under my winter coat by just walking
Washing your under arm with lime really helps with the smell too.
Am 25&I sweat like a waterfall esp by my armpits&it aint getting better since puberty.Winter,summer,no difference..So stresses me up esp when am supposed to go on a date with a guy,anxiety kicks in behold the fountain like WTH,a disaster😭😭😭😭😭😭
Crystal roll on deodorant dipped in baking soda....haven't sweated like a thief for years
Jackie I have it, too. Was bullied mercilessly. It stopped at 18. I use the prescription antiperspirant by Secret every couple of days, does wonders.
Adhydrol Forte stops the sweating it blocks pores and the morning after you apply it dry as a bone i wouldn’t even sweat after running. TRY IT!!
CERTAIN DRY, folks! Buy it at Amazon or Target
I have it too 😣 It's the worst!!! But for my underarm sweaters..Please try Miracle Dry if you haven't already! It's amazing if you're consistent 😊
Omg I can relate so much to this. I also got it from my mom. Thanks for making this video!
I have the same thing and I'm natural because I have eczema and really bad sensitive skin so I have to wear natural deodorant and when I do I always put baking soda under my arms it never fells. When I no I am going to have a sweaty day I lather with the baking soda because sometimes I have to let my body breath from products and baking soda is my holy grail! I'm 23 and my mom is like girl just put out your own products and stop tryin to be extra and cause a break out trying products lol!
I wish you still posted bible verses at the beginning I always loved that about your videos 😩
I love you Jackie!! Thank you for sharing this!! You will help so much people!!
Oh my gosh Jackie I love you!! I was just diagnosed with hyperhidrosis on yesterday. I was prescribed the Drysol by my dermatologist. I couldn't wear long sleeves because I 💦 so bad, and not in specific areas either. My WHOLE body sweats! Thank you so much for your videos @jackieaina
I think I have this, but just in my hands. They are ALWAYS clammy and I cant hold anyones hand without sweating all over their hand... its so fucking annoying.
What r u wearing on your lips it looks so good❤️❤️🌸
I suffer from this,  I sweat everywhere 👀😕 pits, hands, feet, crotch, face everywhere 😌
Smelling like Activity😩😩 😩 I have  the condition too, I dealt with it since Junior H.S., it was soooo bad 😣and I use to put paper towel under my arms underneath my shirt. And I own Nothing WHITE!!
👏  Thank you huntie; they sell these underarm garment protectors at Steinmart which are good because once that sweat stain is there its not coming out.
sweat is not what stinks!!!!! its the bacteria feeding on it, antiperspirant is gonna clog your sweat glands and that can cause you to get an infection. you need to use antibacterial deodorant if you wanna get rid of the smell
I don't know if I have hyperhidrosis because I only sweat during school, but a couple months ago I started using hypercare, and it conpeletely stopped my excessive sweating ! Now I wear normal shirts without having to worry about a sweat stain
MOOD I literally started sweating so fucking much this year and I have no idea why it like I haven't done this ever like I go to sleep with three fans on and I wake up covered in sweat and I'm like oh well I guess I'll have to take my fifth shower today
Ahhhh musty Matilda !!!!! Hahaha love it! Maybe I have it too cuz I can shower and by the time I finish our 1st worship set, I smell like a pack a monkeys!!  Haha thank u!:)
Lol so that's what's happening to me
Whyyyy didn't I know the name of this in highschool 😫 my life
Funny because I sweat extra hard under my arms too and do the Botox too and like the amount of Botox needed to get all those sweat glands I have is crazy even to the doctor. But coincidentally I don't sweat in my face either and I'm black as well. So it may be something to do with our hormones as my mom suffers the same issues as well.
I didn't knew that I had hyperhidrosis untill now...WTF THANK YOU SO MUCH JACKIE ♥♥♥♥
Lol i use to walk around w paper towels under my armpits😂😂
Thank you so much for sharing Jackie!! I've struggled with hyperhidrosis for years and it's nice hearing tips and being able to relate to someone else who deals with it.
I just love you. You're so encouraging, inspiring and real! I have this issue tooooo!!!
Thanks for sharing your story, Jackie. ❤️
Yes. Never knew others struggled with this also. I have underarm and other areas that sweat more than others. Sweating doesn’t cause the odor, the bacteria does. I apply tea tree oil about every two weeks to kill the bacteria.
I don't know what I have but I sweat so much.... Like too much my test papers shrivel up, I wear black that's it I can't wear anything else cause I'm so scared of sweat. I'm always cold tho so idk what the problem is.... Does anyone feel the same or am I alone??
GIRL. ok i know you don't like the liquid antiperspirants and i was totally right there with you but try MITCHUM. it takes some getting used to since its a gel but it dries pretty quickly and you put it on before going to sleep to let it activate and it's supposed to work through the next day too (even if you shower apparently) but i use it at night and in the morning and it works WONDERS. and no white marks!! i'm tellin you it's god's gift to girls like us!!!! and for bonus points there's no animal testing or ingredients!
girl, this channel...i just love more and more this girl. my problem is also on my underarms, they feel wet no matter how cold is outside (i live in central europe) and you don't wanna know during summer. when i say wet, they are freaking wet :|
Okay, I have one question... How do you know when you've got hyperhydrosis? I've always thought that armpit sweat/face sweat was normal. For reference, I live in a notoriously humid country (Singapore), and I do get a sweat stache' often and sometimes under eye sweat, in situations when i do sweat. And sweat everywhere else on my body too cos... It's hot here, ok?! Haha. In fact, I actually find it weird when some of my friends DON'T sweat LOL.
SAME I tried everything then I LEARNED about sweat. AFTER I waxed my armpits. Hair ANY amount holds germs and odor. Waxing helped SO Much. THEN EXFOLIATE. Every other day. I was constantly using deodorant to hide the smell and even after showering Id still feel residue from the deodorant. Over time dead skin cells and it lead to more odor, the clogged pores in your armpits SWEAT MORE to breathe so to speak.. Exfoliating changed my Armpit Life. Odor is caused from bacteria Waxing, and exfoliating removes dead skin and hair which all contains odor causing bacteria. Daily when I get out the shower I dry my armpits and wipe them with rubbing alcohol. Kills whatever odor causing bacteria there is and help your armpits to dry. I also clean my deodorant with alcohol before each use. These steps have changed EVERYTHING. For me i feel so much fresher and confident. I use LESS deodorant and I haven't STUNK like Musty Mildred since I switched to this pattern of cleaning my armpits. I hope this helps anyone who needs it.
I use Dricolor it works magic and it's at target for like 6$
You're lipstick 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Aina keep rapping
Your makeup is SOOOO FLAWLESS
Thank you Jackie!!
Its my palms.. ugh. So embarrassing
Smelling like activity Girllll you aint neva lied. 😩🤦🏽‍♀️😂
:)
Jackie!!! I feel you gurl
YAS QUEEEEEEEN
This video made me sweaty. 😂
I love you sis
Didnt know anti perspirant and deodorant were different . Thanks!
“I wear deodorant just like y’all heifas, dang!” 😂😂😂
Thank hoy so much ❤️ LOVE
Omg I thought I was the only one. But I sweat EVERYWHERE just sitting down in an air conditioned room I start sweating
I sweat in all the awkward places  😩😩😩 (underboob, crotch, face and neck, armpits, feet), I'll be in class and just start sweating! I have social anxiety so whenever I talk to someone I sweat buckets! I sweat through bras!
Who knew so much thought went into distributing cat videos?
4:14 No, it's cleverer than that.  The uppermost bits overflow _into_ the lower bits: it's called ones' complement or end-around carry.  This is because the values to be summed are not the individual octets but rather _pairs_ of octets treated as 16-bit numbers.  Thanks to this clever ones' complement hack, it doesn't matter whether your computer is a 386 that thinks of them as little-endian numbers, or an m68k that thinks they're big-endian: each octet carries into the other octet — it's a circle that has no ends to be big or little.\nThere's also _another_ clever hack: the checksum isn't just the sum of the packet data, instead it's _minus_ the sum of the packet data.  This means that if you want to validate the checksum on an incoming packet, you just add up the _whole_ packet, including the checksum, and if it's valid you should get *zero*.  (This turns out to be a big deal for network encapsulation — where your UDP payload is another entire packet with its own IP, UDP etc. headers — because it means you can calculate the outer checksum just by looking at the outer headers, since you know the inner packet with a correct checksum adds up to zero.  This is called Local Checksum Offload, and was invented by, erm, _me_.  But I think the people who originally designed the Internet Protocol checksum are the ones who really deserve the credit, because it's their brilliant design that made it possible.)\n\n7:29 The main reason for using UDP instead of TCP isn't the ACKs and the bandwidth they use, it's that latency-sensitive applications generally want each individual packet delivered as soon as possible — they don't want new data to be buffered up in the OS just because it's still waiting for some old data that's supposed to come before it but maybe isn't even relevant any more.  This rationale applies to everything from video chat (I already displayed that frame with low resolution and glitches, it's too late now to tell me what it should have shown, I want the next video frame ASAP) to financial trading (give me the most recent stock price, I don't care what the price 10 microseconds ago was!).  Lag is caused not by ACKs but by waiting for retransmissions and enforcing ordering constraints that — at the application layer — may be totally irrelevant.\n\n9:11 Technically (and yes I'm being pedantic now), the very top of the tree are the _root name servers_, 'a.root-servers.net' through 'm.root-servers.net'.\n\n10:05 Oh no, not the OSI 7-layer burrito.  Real-world networking implementations don't look anything like that over-engineered heap (does anyone really understand wtf the Presentation Layer corresponds to in the Internet protocol stack?)  The standard protocol stack today combines the physical and data-link layers into Ethernet (attempts to separate them out conceptually founder on the way the data-link part of it gets waaaay too intimate with the physical part).  Similarly, some of the network layer's functions are handled by 'layer 4' protocols like TCP or UDP, and some functions that OSI puts in the transport layer are done either by IP or by other layer-3 protocols that go straight on top of Ethernet rather than being wrapped in IP datagrams.  Sometimes the layering even differs between IPv4 and IPv6: ARP, which is considered a link layer function, is layered on top of Ethernet, making it network layer; its IPv6 equivalent, Neighbour Discovery, is part of ICMPv6, sent inside IPv6 datagrams, making it technically a transport layer protocol!\nCertainly the Internet protocol suite _is_ layered, but the trouble with the OSI model is that it's so neat and theoretically elaborated that it _sounds_ like it should be a strict and precise thing, whereas real, working networks are inevitably messy and don't follow neat layering boundaries.  See also RFC3439.  While the OSI model does give us a few nice names (Layer 3, Layer 4, and also (though it doesn't actually define it itself) Layer 8 for the user's intentions and behaviour layer), it shouldn't be taught without a warning that it's basically a cross between numerology and stamp-collecting.
When there is no internet connection in Russia, it is called Internyet. So when it's back up, it turns into Inderda.
Why do you have an oscilloscope for a computer science series?
Can you guys do a video on how Operating Systems work?
dobledoo wasn't that from John Green in Vlogbrothers? lol
This is a great video, but as an American I flinch a little every time she says “rooter” instead of “roawter” (rhyming “route” with “about”).  But never mind me, carry on.
Amazing video, thanks guys!
The TCP packet walks into a bar, 'I would like a beer' he says. 'You would like a beer?' The bartender replies. 'I would like a beer' the packet says.
Your PC is the first hop? Since when? :P
Hope to see a knowledge graph of this entire series
What about ICP?\nDo the packets come with clown make-up?
Doing the world a great service with all you offer CrashCourse! You have my support.\nThank you!
or 'ack' as the cool kids say
and then you start working with websockets which add another layer of packets on top of the application layer packets.
im new at this internettywebbythingymajig . so pls help. ive written my email put it in my envelope, wrote the email address of the person its going to on the frount, im not stupid i know that i dont need a stamp but my problem is . . what slot do i push it in to, is it the 1marked ,cdrom drive, is that short for . .

Am I the only one who heard ROOTer (*router*) and thought: isn't it supposed to be pronounced ROWter? \n\n\n\nWhen I hear ROOTer something altogether different comes to mind...
My traceroute for dftba.com ended up grabbing the site from a Cloudflare CDN endpoint instead of the California servers. Before I realized that, I was confused at why my route was ending up in Texas XD

What a weird coincidence, my networking class just went over this today.
I know absolutely nothing about computers besides clicking the thingy to get the stuff and thought it was just magic but I love this series and have binge watched it all. Now I actually have a basic understanding on how all the components do relatively simple jobs to make everything happen and why things are the way they are. Now I just think it's magic that it was thought up by somebody in the first place. Awesome show and please keep them coming
This series is really good.

Stupid question how does one create own their internet? How do these companies do it?
I did the test and it told me all the routers originated in 2001? And there was only 5 steps.
How does Tor Browser operate for this data transmission concept?
Skype operates on port 443 lol
Please create a video about fibonacci sequence😊
Go slow when teaching
You keep saying WAN
The OSI model doesn't really apply to the TCP/IP stack, hence it having it's own model. The session layer an above are just considered Application layer because how they are used and implemented is *very* application specific. DNS, for example, has no session layer.
I love this series, thankyou!\n\nI'm really hoping at some point you'll took about encryption techniques, and also compression techniques, because I'm learning about both in my own time and they're really interesting.
Is it rooter or ra-outer?

You should prank your husband and fill the bag with potatoes (up to the same weight) so the next time he is with Aria and tries to take something from the bag he will be confused. (But make sure to leave just one spare diaper at the bottom of the bag) \n\nI'm hitting the age (26) where I'm finding myself progressively thinking about starting a family almost every single day. Anyone else like that?
Just sat down now that my daughter Aria fell asleep and you uploaded! love that we have a daughter with the same name 😂
I'm not pregant, no kids and i don't know if I will have kids yet but I just love mommy related videos 😂🙈
You ur mama bear shirt is too die for 👌🏻🌸🌸 great diaper bag as well ☀️☀️
Despite the fact that I don't plan to marry any time soon, I love all these mom videos because I know that these will come in handy some years later. This I know from my experience with menstrual cups--knowing many things about them before actually using them (thanks to Jen) has helped me so much.
Yay!!! You're such an inspiration Jen! I so appreciate these videos (I'm 20 weeks along with a baby girl), thank you!!
Loving momtember 💖💖 So relateable
I love your mommy videos!!
yesssss JUJUBE lovers!!!
Love you Jen! ❤️
♥️♥️♥️
boogie wipes are a life saver!
New subscriber
I just ordered same sippy cup:)
I love that diaper bag I have in black out which is just all black :)
Can you do a diaper bag comparison? What you like or dislike about the diaper bags you own? Love to watch product comparison video/blogs, thanks
I also do mommy/diaper bag videos!! I love jujube!! 💖💖💖💖
Do you still breastfeed at all? My daughter will turn 1 next month and I don't know how to start weaning her
I love this video! My husband and I are first time parents to our amazing one month old daughter, Ellie. We definitely had questions on what to put in the diaper bag the first time we packed it. Just like you guys, we like to keep things to a minimum of what we need to carry. I like the style of your bag a lot. We've got the kind of classic duffel-style bag, but I think once Ellie gets a little older, we'll end up switching to something like yours. Loving all of your Momtember videos! Please keep 'em coming <3
Obviously I wouldn't just whip my boob out anywhere! - I'm so lucky I got to whip my boob to feed my baby out without fear in San Diego: at the park, at the San Diego Zoo, on the beach, at the tide pools - and no one gave me a hard time.  In fact, I'd say at least in our part of SD it was rare to find mommies using a nursing cover.  Now when we moved up to the Miracle Mile in LA I gotta say I would feel weird breastfeeding in front of some of the scary homeless people or in a super crowded area.  What a blessing to have had that first year and a half with my baby in South Park, San Diego, where hipsters don't care if you breastfeed in public.
Hey Jen! I love Ju-Ju-Be bags! If you want more, there is a FB community for Ju-Ju-Be fans and also a BST page for it! There are more Hello Kitty items to match your coin purse! I have a few of them and love that print! Let me know and I can share the links to the pages!
The link to the diaper backpack doesn't work :/
I like how you packed this bag with all the right essentials. I would do the same. I used to have a back pack type diaper bag too when my son was a baby. it was great for traveling. I think that brand was called one step ahead or something, been long ago lol.
I loved your idea of the coin pouch for your car key and stole it plus I add my drivers license.
Thanks for sharing! I love these vids...just curious to see what others carry in their diaper bag.  Does the backpack come with a stroller strap? TY!
We pack similarly! As mine got older, diapers were replaced by snacks, his sunglasses, etc. But I'm pregnant again and love seeing what other people do -- not sure how I'll pack for two!
I had the same diaper bag and it broke within 6 months of using it plus I found it not functional at all . I purchased it before my son was born :( . I feel into the hype 😖
I will be so happy when I can make videos like this. We have been trying for over a year now. Until then I can keep watching videos like this and learn as much as I can! :)
Yeah jujube!!! We have snacks in the top zipper in case Allie gets hungry, and an extra set of clothes for me cos there has been accidents (I usually have it in a separate be quick for me)..
Does she still drink milk from bottles? Our littles are the same age and I still carry around toddler formula and bottles lol
100% with you on the diaper wipes! They are so handy!
This is a lovely bag but how do you use a backpack bag when you're dressed up fancy 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
My kids are older, 8 and 4, but I still carry around baby wipes. I keep a bag in my bag and in the car. I swear, someone is always spilling something or getting their little fingers sticky/dirty. 😂
You should making video about reviewing baby product too.. 😄
I'm a young mommy and I've been struggling to find a good diaper bag. Thank goodness for this video because I definitely know what to get now!!
such a cute video, you have a lot of good essentials xo
My daughter absolutely LOVES that baby Einstein music light up thing. It's a life saver for my husband and I.
Loved this so much Jen!! I love more simplistic things too so this was super satisfying to watch. :) Thank you for sharing.
Omg! I got that little fan thing when I was in San Diego. It's so useful and such an awesome thing for a hot day
Yes! Yes! Yes! I love our backpack bag, and I basically carry exactly what you do, with one addition. A shirt for me! I was inspired by a friend of mine who's daughter had a blow out while she was holding her. We were out and her baby had a change of clothes, but momma wasn't as lucky.
No snacks or food 😛 ? That is something I always keep for my baby .. like one smoothie or raisins or ... something 😝😝
Please keep posting these mom video or even your experience!! Love them so much
LOVE JuJube, I own two! and Steven used to love that toy as well! Love your Momtember vids! :)
No snackies?! 😲 If I didn't have to carry 2 different medical kits, I'd be able to get by using a regular handbag with a small diaper pouch and snackies. Instead, I use a giant Kenneth Cole commuter bag. Lol.
Props to all the moms out there!👏
Where do you put your baby bottles?
Son Heung Min seems like a legit nice guy.
best fashion sense - Eric Dier (nominated by himself)
Wait I swear most Tottenham players have said eric dier has a bad dress sense
2:56 that voice crack
I like this series but I'd like it even more if you didn't just do it with players that only play for spurs
I love Eric dierrrrr, Eric dierrrrr loves meeeeee
anyone else just completely forget to read what the hell theyre talking about
They call me chip diddy chip I don't tolerate lip diddy lip\nIf you know you know

I'm getting San Andreas vibes in this vid ..
I got an advert with Eric in it

What's the intro song
Is it a coincidence that I got an ad with Eric dier in just before this video

Why are they only interviewing spurs players everyone knows their answers
Who the even fuck is this
This shit is so repetitive now
Lamela wearing loubs how is that fashion fail
Get players from different teams 😪
Tubes looks so awkward interviewing people. Big babboons red arse face on him
You have could have interviewed any other spurs player and u choose eric fucking diet. This guy's personality is equivalent to a brick.
Do more teammate 2.0
Funny is that everyone says that he is the fashion fail

that was such a tender sweet moment with your grandpa and family
“Food will make everything better !” \nLiterally what I say every day.
My great grandma has alzheimers and was like that near the end too.. brought back some FEELINGS... Tell him all you want to tell him while you can.
Won't it get cold to sleep next to the window when it's winter?
Omg I literally go to seekonk ALL THE TIME. Can we meet and take pretty pix???
you're grandpa is so cute
You are pure class. Such a calming, kind, and sweet demeanour and really cool style. Your family is so cute and I really enjoyed the clip of you and your grandfather (I just lost my grandfather in July). Enjoy school this year
I literally teared up at the part wth your grandpa. He's so sweet ❤️
Hi! Does anyone know the name of the bgm from 3:22? I absolutely love it but I couldn't find it :(
i started crying im so sorry about your grandad i truly hope he gets better ik what it feels like
Was so hard to watch the clip of your grandfather. Mine just passed away a couple weeks ago, with my grandmother also having passed this last New Years. I wish him, you and the rest of your family all the best of health <3
Never seen two better dressed people in my life 😩😍 this video was so pleasing to watch and I'm definitely subbing xx
I love you so much... I always get impatient for your next videos... the make my day better
I WAIT EVERY WEEK FOR THESE VLOGS. I've watched this vlog thrice its so nice
Oh. Your grandpa reminded me of my grandpa so much that was strangely touching 💛
praying for your grandpa and that he gets stronger :) my grandfather just passed away but I know he's in a better place 💛
the scene with your grandfather really touched my heart. it reminded me of when i had to say goodbye to my grandmother before she died. really hoping for the best for both of you. much love.
So smart turning the bed upside down! It looks much more comfy 😇
Her new short hair look so sweet 🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭
Love that dress at 10:59, super cute!
My blessing go out to ur grandpa and hope he gets better soon💗💗
Hello! I just discovered your channel. You're actually the only non-kpop/korean channel that I subscribed to cos your vlogs are so raw and quirky and not controlled by some brands and ads. Like your videos are the real meaning of vlogs. It's about daily life and not some fancy sponsored vlogs that have no life. Sorry that was long 😅 And you seem like a nice and respectful and family-oriented person. 💕😭 I found another favorite Internet person. 💕
All the best for your grandpa❤️❤️❤️
Is your sister also attending RISD or is she just moving to RI?
I couldn't stop laughing when your cat hid behind the computer at the vet!!!!
I miss your pink hair. but you also look so amazing in your hair now. ugh.
What school is UNI ?
How's your grandfather now?
It's been ( about ) a year since I've discovered you and followed you along you beautiful journey! Also I'm praying for your grandfather who is just so wonderful! 💛\nEdit: this is a repost BC there were annoying comments that just weren't okay!
What course does she take?

Wow your view is amazing! My view at my school is of an Ihop and a parking garage (altho not complaining that much cuz I love ihop). I'm a freshman at college and so far its been SO much fun and pretty easy.
your sister is so cute! I love her whole look, with the haircut, the blush, the checkered dress, the green coat, its all so cute!

Just feel so cozy watching this video. Just like morning coffee in a comfortable armchair and watching   Birds and squirrels outside the windows. And then fall asleep.

Really really appreciate the description 💖!!
1000th comment 😂
Wow her sister's hair is so different! But it suits her!!! She looks so youthful and adventures
I literally started sobbing when your grandpa came on :'( He reminds me so much of mine. I hope he gets better soon!!!

Does anyone know that name of the cute cafe she met her friend Amanda at ??? So cuteeee
Your grandpa is very precious & i hope he holds on for longer :’) also love ur cat so cute
oh I remember seeing your grandpa in your past vlogs and he brought me so much joy. The clips of your grandpa got me. Praying he'll be well.
Your vlogs are beautiful and very relaxing
I appreciate the small editing details you add into your vlogs. Like when you were washing dishes, the camera shot from the side, and then from inside the cabinet as you put the dish away was really seamless! Lovely work
i was crying so bad when i saw ann's grandpa.

I cried so much when you showed your grandfather :( I hope he's doing well!

I was there, and oh yeah, it was my birthday too, yeah.
This video was edited in imovie ?
Shakira's voice is perfect for that song :)
Shakira is never old❤️😍
Shakira's voice puts Beyoncé to shame.
has the same mystic voice
They are taking something that doesn't need that much editing, and editing it by 300%. Like stop!
no usó cinturón, rayossss!!!
Wow Carpool Karaoke went downhill
Trevor💛
where can i see the whole thing? can't find it!!
Really not a fan of Trevor...
My dream has been done! Thank uuuu! OMG, she is singing one of the songs where she sings really similar to Dolores O'rordian...she has a really similar voice colour!
I want the FULL EPISODE please!!!!!!!!!!!!! also im a bit sad that she didnt do the carpool karaoke with James
I actually really like the editing. This is just a promo video, the full version won't have edits like this.
What is the song called
hard core rock, the cranberries? no way. that's pretty soft to me.
NO I WANT HER TO SING HIPS DONT LIE UGH
Yeah... Carpool Karaoke was good with James....
In the comercial they sing whenever wherever and hips dont lie.. WHAT HAPPENED!!!
OMG where is the other guy?. This is crap. Dislike.
two of my favorite people
Some how Apple managed to ruin Carpool Karaoke!
Where is the full video???? Pleaseee
Porta subanlo completo
Trevor is hilarious
I LOVE SHAKIRA
Hit that snare
Shakira is a freaking QUEEN!
Not loving the format...
This is crap, Carpool Karaoke but shittier?
This is how you are NOT supposed to edit...wtf??
that was incredible!
The old format was better. I was looking forward to them singing some Shakira songs the way James did with other people. I hope they redo this episode in the old format with James singing Shakira songs with Shakira. I didn’t enjoy this episode at all.
I like the traditional carpool karaoke with James. This video has too many special effects . This guy has no charisma, sorry dude but is not like the others carpool karaoke. The only thing that is amazing in this is that appears Shakira. That's my opinion. Take care.
She should do another episode with James !
Trevors Dope!!!
Te amo Shakira ❤❤
ooh, shakira's voice would sound great on What's Up? by 4 Non Blondes
Just let James corden do this. Stop stealing ideas. 🙄🙄🙄
This is rubbish. Apple ruined it.
All these speicel effects are so bad like 😂😂😂😂
#bringbackoldcarpoolkaraokewedontwantthiscrap!!! Bring back old carpool karaoke apple ruins everything!!!!!!!!!😭
I want to watch the entire episode!!!!
One of the biggest messes in youtube. Terrible video. Great singing.
The reason why Carpool Karaoke worked was the authenticity between the two stars. It was away from the studio, the audience, publicists and managers so we can see a genuine interaction. But this edited version from apple music completely misses the point. They try to glam-up the video with crappy effects to make it look 'cooler'. All they need to do is create a space where the two stars can relax and be themselves. (also, I miss James and his fan-girl love for the artists).
SHAK 4 EVER QUEEN. Te adoro, bba❤ me muero por verte en vivo!
What the fuck is this shit!
I can't believe this just happened, it's like the video was tailor made for me... TREVOR NOAH ON CARPOOL KARAOKE WITH SHAKIRA!
Wtf is this?
Inteiro???
IY nino
Que haga el cover en el Tour  el dorado.
Apple ruins all . i want to see Shakira with James Corden singing her songs and driving around
She is amazing !!!
Love it !!!!
Zaambie zaambie lol
carpool karaoke shakira do it james plsssssss!!!!!
Shakira is legend
@eduardocarrero
Fuck off Apple
why does apple have to be everywhere so annoying  i want old carpool back.........I  was waiting for shakira's carpool and got this so unfair
only Spanish speakers know how much awesomer and cooler were Shakiras songs at her early years. Well, I guess Inevitable is the only remain of those\nPd: I miss James on this
Worst special effects ever :( Shakira with James corden in a normal carpool karaoke please 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻.
Now Im in love with that song 😍
Shakira likes The Cranberries? My life's complete
I love shakira she's such a great artist!
Hardcore rock????
I'm a shakira fan from when she first came out in Latin America. When she was a little older, she was a full on belly dancer and a rocker. Her MTV live set was amazing too. I love that era of Shakira. Especially the song Ojos Asi... Zombie was perfect! 😁😁 I be looking forward to watching this one.
He's so surprised she likes rock. C'mon, she was a rockstar in Latin America way before the whole Hips Don't Lie sh*t.
Nothing Trevor Noah has ever done has been funny.
DAAAMN, That sending money joke hit me hard trev! & with regards everyone hating on apple, yes they've messed with it & its obviously not as good as the original, but hey, didn't ppl complain about james & trevor taking over, now everybody loves them, they might improve, okay that doesn't take away the payment issue, at least lsb was on tv (where I'm from anyway). Now I've loved jc since before he moved to the us, but at least this way we get to see trevor & seth having a go, okay there have been some stupid ones...
Omfg she sounds exactly like the song
When is it coming on YouTube?
Ok, now I really love Trevor.  Wu Tang!!!
I don't mind Apple Music taking over, I mean they can get even more celebs on the show but WHY REMOVE *JAMES*  he was the reason for this show. It's like watching spongebob without spongebob in it.
Where's James? Is this not his show anymore?
zombi is a song in the future tour Of Shakira ! well see
I love shakira super voice
#BringBackShakiraToTheVoice

Jajajaja Shakira, you have no idea, that is not hard-core 😂
What is this song 0:24 ?
He is boring
Cranberries!
Bitter scouse TWAT
Leicester 3-1 Liverpool today's result.
I’ve supported the mighty reds for a very long time and I am convinced Rafa has unfinished business at our beloved club......
Coutiniho doesn't want to be at liverpool
If I'm honest I don't see it getting any better, the defence is tactically inapt and lack coordination.. 3 very trick games over the coming weeks, for that reason stability at the back is critical. They need to pick an agreed back 4 and stick with it, not chop and change every  game.. The players look terrified, that in my opinion is due to a lack of direction and confidence.. Worryingly I'm not sure they presently have the ability within the coaching staff to instil that belief..
This team has no world class player except mane
Next year will be our year
What is it with scousers playing the victim
It pisses me off SO much that every LFC supporter knew our Defense was the problem but for some reason Klopp and FSG dont try and improve that area! We NEED a new Keeper (we haven't had a decent keeper since Reina!) who breeds confidence in the Team and a NEW CB and LB!  I know we wanted VVD but come on! at least have a back-up! There are LOADS of players better than our CBs!
But Klopp has a great cup record tho doesnt he tho
All you deluded Liverpool fans who love Klopp need to realise hes has almost 2 years now to sort this defence out and if anything it is worse.  I dont just mean defending from our defence i mean all over the field. If we are not on our  A game with the pressure closing down type of football then we are a totally average team. Too much f**king around and changing the team all the time does no-1 any good. Cant understand why he thinks we can have 3 teams for each cup. We should have our first team no matter what and if anyone is injured then some1 gets the chance to step up and prove their worth!
Simple question, would Jose Mourinho still have a bad defense after two seasons transfer windows?
When are you scousers gonna realise that Klopp is just David Moyes with a German accent, glasses and yellow teeth
Its only game, why you have to be mad?
For years we are the nearly men, is it the players, managers or owner? Fsg out now ynwa.
Only thing coming out the 0151 is AYSTAR
We had a legendary defence: Hypia, Skrtel, Agger, Carragher, Riise, and Finnan. What on earth happened to our defence? Our defence took a turn for the worst about four seasons ago. Subsequently, it hasn't improved since. We need to optimise our defence primarily, not our attack or midfield. We already have a great attacking squad, however, our defence is dismal to say the least.
Create enough chances... 🤣\n\nDid he even watch the game or at least check the stats before he made this 🤣🤣🤣
arsenal: undefeated since ox left. Liverpool: haven't won a game. robbed you lot 😂😂
this is ur year
Hahahah faggot we'll beat you on Saturday too
we are nothing without firmino salah and mane
Why does no one understand how much work goes into getting a football team to consistently play good , ofcourse they should (play good) but when dickheads like this one and half the people in the comments blame a bad shot or 'we need mane to win' no team in history had a one man team
I miss the good sturridge
Ach not too fussed, we sabotaged it in order to win the CL, so no harm done! :P\n\nNa being serious, I thought we did look disjointed first half, with Ox not linking up too well yet, or Coutinho and Robertson linking up too well either, but we did create chances. Usually I defend Hendo, but he was absolutely rank last night it has to be said, he kept giving the ball away. Second half we looked like a team of individuals as well, which tbf most of the lads playing haven't played with each other much, but its still no excuse.\n\nOn the plus side, great seeing Ings back.
Seems as ox was the issue then 😂😂😂😂
Did u think ud beat a team of premiership champions with ur team of never will cos Gerrard slipped like a pussy bitches???
i miss my team of the 8o s  and 2001 trebble wining team we want dijmii !!! :0) the stig !!hurry up lala we miss your hunger weve gone soft!! :0(
Well that was fucking embarrassing wasn't it? This is what happens when you fail to sort out your defensive and team depth problems. I think it's looking like a trophyless top 10 finish again. Back the drawing board next summer.
And people need to stop overhyping our players after a couple good results\n\nGood bye hendo\nAnd if Klopp even thinks about playing keita and hendo
This is a fuckin joke now I can't see it getting any better why can't we win games without Mane ??????
It's my fault. I wasn't singing loud enough to improve our back four. Sorry Chris I will do better next time
This isn't just this season, it's been season in, season out.  It's become the 'Liverpool way'. Whenever I see possession heading over 60% if we don't have got a lead I fear a poor result.  I really don't get PC mandatorily going off after 45 mins.  Yes say to him, when you start to tire tell the bench, but him going off turned the game.  Robertson then lost the freedom he had and that closed off our main attacks.  Here's a question, what is more tiring for players, playing a run of games where you know your team mates and you give every game a good crack, or chopping and changing where you might be watching your mates lose on TV.  So few games into the season and it feels like f'ing Groundhog Day.  We have a house without foundations and season after season we seem to think that will bring success.  At the start of each season do FSG really want us to challenge, because after so few games, I don't think we will top the table at any stage this season unless others have games in hand.  I've followed this club for 40 years, the last 25 being utterly ropey.  Even the few successes we've had have largely been toss of a coin stuff. (Penalty shootouts). Leicester proved it doesn't have to be the most expensive players but the right players.  Generally our players have poor concentration and are generally weak in game phycology.  Bored of it.  Don't mind losing if it's because our best team have an off day, but sick to death of our club being a work in progress.  Klopp you want us to believe, then start earning your fat salary.
disappointing season after season come on were liverpool and not getting a trophy after a few season is a joke the fans deserve more than having to see every season these type of results just pathetic
I miss kolo and martin
I'm sorry but klopp relied on the second team and they didn't perform simple. Flanagan is garbage and should be nowhere near the premier league.  Woodburn always looks average and just loses the ball,  i don't see the hype.  He looks small,  slow and if he doesn't pass backwards he loses the ball. Average. \nEverything else wasn't too bad but we lacked talent when Phil went off.  \nHarry Wilson or Kent are better than Woodburn.  I remember when sterling came through he was actually good lol he took people on and showed class.  Woodburn hasn't. He scored a tap in and one in preseason.  Forget Wales when he hit one from a distance.  His overall play is poor.  And he is not a winger! \nHe is still young but I think in 45 mins if that was markovic he would have been slated.  He did nothing. We need to stop overrated average players especially scouse players.  Players like suso were much better at the same age. Suso btw would have been great last night but we let him go and become the main man at ac Milan..
it's a micky mouse trophy anyway..it's a blessing in disguise
Woodburn has great future ahead of him and am puzzled why he hasn't been making the bench because he looks like a first change for salah/mane.but taking couhtino off in what felt like a premeditated sub killed us,he was what knitted the midfield n attack together.the ox was erratic on his debut let's not judge him yet people.west ham been linked with cavallio had me thinking well surely klopp will pounce with Lucas n Stewart going smh.#3points on Saturday
We still don't have a top striker. Playing attacking midfielders as a striker ie firmino isn't the answer, unless we find the next Torres or Suarez then 100 shots and no goals will continue.
January has come early this season. It won't turn February until Mane comes back and Coutinho finds his range. But this defence is the most gruesome I can ever remember.
We Need The King To Return King Mane. Without Him We Are Shit.  We Need To Start Showing Are Main Man The Love We Show To The Likes Of The Old Guard. Becouse Believe It Or Not Mane He His The GLUE Of The Team. Watch When He Returns.
Its become embarrassing we just throw this cup away and being realistic our only chance of a trophy its utter shit that alot of these players are played in a week what takes us a year or more to earn Im tired of hearing about the defence forget that even when we went a goal down were the fuck was our captain again gone missing blowing passes all over the place he has lost a truck load of pace and hes lost in midfield now a lot of kids on that pitch last nite looking for big players to help them and ge them up and nothing every senior player was nowhere to be seen and then on commentary isnt it great to see the senior players in the stand watching the game like would ye get fucked I still cant understand why these results shock me klopp has three games to put it right or he can fuck right off hes making.hodgson look good
Pathetic.  The team lacks real leaders on the pitch.  O how I miss Carra and Bellamy.  Yes, Bellamy.  He was a leader on the pitch, especially up front.  I remember when Carra shouted at Arbeloa when he lost concentration during a match.  We don't have that.  A defensive leader would also help Simon and whoever else are between the posts.
Remember when ox wasnt a deal with was going to affect the lemar and VVD deals? good times... sold a lie as usual
We didn't play our best team last night, but the game on Saturday isn't gonna get easier. They are gonna bring back Maguire, Simpson, Schmeichel, Vardy and Mahrez and we haven't won at the King Power in the last three visits (including last night). The only good thing is we don't play at Anfield until October 14th. The way this team is playing atm, playing at home will only hurt them. We have three games until the international break to go out there and recover points in the league and bring our confidence back. Up the Reds.
FSG are the problem but nobody is listening
The biggest idiots of all this are the have faith in Klopp guys. Fucking retards, fucking bastards, fucking misery twats.
you wanker,a few weeks ago u were running your mouth,now u see how crap liverpool is?...anyway how is the Oxlade doing,are u still buzzing u signed him...lmfao
The big German cheerleader 😂😂😂😂😂😂 seriously tho he’s a fraud!!!!
The only good from this match is, Joe Gomez has finally played in CB! Oh, its better to watch him play rather than Klavan or Lovren. Also Henderson maybe need some rest, 'cause lately, his performance was so horrible, cant blame Klopp if in the January market we bought some good DM to replaced him
Let's try another way. Let's do the Pygmalion thing and everyone say we have a great defense.!!.. we have a great defense!!
Sick,is a understatement!!
Man of the first half!!!!! - what a phrase that is!!!
If we don't score within 30 minutes, we end losing most of the time.
Klopp and Wenger, need to share idea's.
Bitterly disappointing last night. Ultimately, we didn't deserve to go through after that second half performance. Okazaki came on and changed the game. Ward was excellent and Woodburn was very hungry. Solanke was great. Gomez was solid, apart from the goals of course. League Cup was never a priority, but at least it is one less excuse for Jürgen to use! At the end of the day, another chance of silverware gone - another one bites the dust! Just hopeful that we won't play like that on Saturday. Hope we can use this defeat as incentive to beat them on Saturday!\nC'mon Liverpool! We go again against Leicester City (again!) at the King Power Stadium back in the league! C'mon Redmen! #YNWA ⚽️🔴❤️
this is what happens when most transefer windows we sign shite or potential shite
We are sad , u are changing ur opinion every game
Em what's the count now
MANE GOES OUT AND IT ALL GOES TO SHIT, AGAIN.
Never seen such a bunch of nearly-men as Liverpool. Still living off past glories after all these years.
Liverpool destroyed us first half with us only having 26% possession and no clear cut chance, we are used to defending with our backs to the wall and even won the league doing exactly that but even all us in the crowd were thinking ur goal was coming... You were unlucky tbh. That shocking corner (1 of many lol) by Ox that was MEGA powerful near post that managed to potentially concuss Ulloa was the difference as it forced GRINji Okazaki on and the energy was injected into us. Iborra was excellent second half, as was Dragovic both on their debuts. I thought you reds fans were another level of brilliant last night btw, to all you reds fans who weren't there last night they done you proud! They were noisey, well behaved and packed the away corner... You should be proud!!! We were lucky to win last night as it could've been 3-0 at half time, you reds fans shouldn't be too disheartened though as at times you played some PHENOMENAL football and we couldn't cope, you were just unlucky last night. We go again Saturday evening and no doubt in our minds you will give us a ridiculously tough time. All the best for your club for the future and hope you get the results you deserve.
Before blaming Klopp, it's important to understand why we didn't strengthen the defense. It could be because FSG were unwilling to spend (most likely scenario ). However if it was because we didn't have a list of targets then the manager should be held responsible.
No blaming the fans this time eh?

stop over reacting, frankly Liverpool are an average club and as such will only attract average players and managers. Sure you'll do ok this season, just don't expect to win anything cos you'll be disappointed.  (southampton supporter with realistic expectations)

Why does the cake rise only on the sides?
JJR - In a previous episode, i thought you said cream cheese melts fondant and therfore shouldnt be used as a crumb coat. But for the steam punk cake, which was awesome, you used cream cheese buttercream. Am i just making this up, or missing something, or both?
This cake is so cool looking. I agree when Nikita Holmes says to make an Alice in Wonderland cake.

Omgoodness! I made your chocolate carrot cake with the cream cheese frosting for a coworker's bday and it turned out FANTASTIC!! I only wound up using half the frosting for the cake, tho. The other half I slowly ate with a spoon over the course of the next month. It was delicious and amazing. I would also love if at some point you did a whimsy cake!

It'd be epic if you could do a collab with Yolanda (how to cake it). Also, here's a vote for a mad hatter/garden tea party cake. ❤️
Kind of Hopeing the bonsai tree cake wins. Mainly because A.) It could be a Green tea or different flavored tea cake, B.) The trees bushes could be lightly dusted in different colors so it can look seasonal and such, and C.)I really wanna see the out come of hat it will look like :D
I love that he eats his crumbs

Peoples asking him to collaborate with Yolanda, try to think about them and take a moment to look at their technique.. Sorry to say that but Yolanda is definitively more professional and meticulous and like using rules and measurement...\nI love him too, but it's like telling to Leonardo Da Vinci to work with Picasso.. I love both of them but they don't belong in the same god damn univers.\nI think both of them would not enjoy it at all...

What an amazing experience for you! She seemed so lovely and you could tell how grateful and happy you were to be there! Looks like an amazing trip! 😘😘 still loving the vlogs
This vlog is excellent. So professional and informative. I think you may be the best out there at what you do. The right mix of personal but informative about brands x
You are simultaneously the most gorgeous and kind person living such a dreamy life, yet so relatable at the same time. How do you do it?? Xoxo
This vlog is so awesome!!!!!
What was the lip color you were wearing at the end? And on your cheeks? Was it the same from the beginning of the video? Thank you! Your makeup and outfits look amazing!!
2 amazing inspirational women :) xx
your makeup looks amazing! i'm so proud of you
omg so cool you met her , she seemed so shy :D but so cool really - i love the spice girls too - you are very lucky that you actually met a spice girl :)))
So there're different makeup styles for different cities? Like football team colours?
Wow, VB is amazing!!
Love, love, LOVE this! xxx
Goals!
that highlight is to die for!!!
this makeup look is GOALS.
Your awful hair is my dream hair 😂😂😂💖
I feel you should take a look at the shade of your foundation, and match it a bit closer your your natural skin tone. If I met you without seeing you without foundation I'd think nothing of it, but it's noticeable when you can see the before and after,.
Hi Victoria, loved your smiley personality when you were interviewing VB. Her stunning advice for winter, coat, jumper, trouser, wow, how original!
VICTORIA IS SO CLASSY!! 😩🙌🏽🌹🌹
Such a dreamy experience to be a part of, so glad you were able to share it with us. \nHugs Adele xoxo
Ahh you look so happy and very humble to be invited to such an amazing event - you're practically glowing like morning aura itself! Love all those looks on you and I have to get my hands on that blush/bronzer thats on your cheeks in the last frame of you looking into the camera - its just stunning!
I hate how hotel bathroom lights make everyone look tango'd!
I'm so intrigued by the VB Estée Lauder line, particularly the contrast between Victoria as a spokeswoman and Kendall Jenner for the Estee edit. I'm really growing tired of celebrity lines that lack real involvement from the celeb themselves. But I really appreciate VB's passion behind the collection, and believe there was a true collaboration between the brand and herself.  Plus Victoria! I see the similarities between you and VB. Intelligence passion and style!
Looks amazing Victoria, one to remember forever!! Love that skirt, I have a similar one and it just comes out time and time again!! X
So happy for you Vic👏🏼
You met Victoria Beckham, got a chance to interview her and all you do is read social media questions? Come on, it was your opportunity to shine and show everyone what you know about the fashion business, and create a memorable impression on VB.
well done, you deserve everything that comes your way because you work so hard xxx
Nicely done and well deserved!  All your looks were perfection.  LOVE VB! 💙💙
So happy on your behalf! I have been a subscriber for some few years now,and I have definitely been caught up on how much you adore this woman :) Not to mention that you totally deserve everything you have achieved and will achieve in the future xx
The girl in the background at 4:14 looked so cool and chic. Need that jacket⭐️
You are the sweetest ♥️♥️♥️
How do you do make up so well in such speed! I take about an hour and it looks like I took 2 minutes to do my make up 😰💞
Hi!! Would you be able to film a makeup tutorial (or tell me the products you used) on the makeup you was wearing on your final outfit change (the blue dress and the awesome green boots!!!) I absolutely adore your makeup and really would love to recreate it xxxx
Congrads!!!!!! :D That's a point checked from bucket list :D Amazing! BRAVO! I know how much you love her :) (pssst me too! she's got an amazing style!)

Beautiful look.  Your hair looks long and luscious also.  Have you thought of doing a hair tutorial as to how you get your hair style so spot on.  Loved the questions you asked VB. She is such an icon.  Congratulations.
Both Victorias the cutest ❤️

Omg How Amazing! VB Is One Of My Favourite Women. I Would Have Passed Out With Excitement. Thankyou So Much For Letting Us See Behind The Scenes At NYFW - Looks Like You Had An Incredible Time xx \nP.s You Look Fabulous In EVERYTHING 😘
Victoria squared! Victoria beckham is one of my favorite designers, her clothes are so beautifully made and the fit is amazing!
You were so sweet when you were interviewed Victoria Beckham, you could tell it was your dream come true but you were so composed and professional.
You and Victoria (Beckham ;)) are absolutely one of the most beautiful en sweet people on earth!
Not sure how but that gorgeous browny nude lipstick totally compliments the contouring.
I never miss any of you vlog!love you Victoria!am a fan 😘😘😘🇵🇭
My goodness your skin without makeup is flawless!
such an icon! I dont even imagine what it feels to meet a person that you admire so much! You are so lucky Victoria! ohh and LOOOVED the blue sweater
Gosh, I wasn't even considering trying the new VB makeup until I saw your video with the different looks. How would you compare the VB looks to the Charlotte Tillbury looks in a box?
WoW Victoria! Huge milestone, congratulations! So cool to know where YouTube has taken you, not that I live in England or anything but I´ll just keep on working on my channel as well and hopefully some day cool things will come my way!
This vlog actually made me so emotional. Anyone who watches you knows that she is one of your biggest inspirations so to see you get to talk with her and get invited to these intimate events with her, I don't know why but I could have cried. I literally got choked up watching you interview her haha. Beautiful looks as always <3
Awesome video. Just ordered two pieces from the collection. I was inspired!
WOW ! you cant call this work.. :-) meeting VB... but you work hard every day and deserve these lovely moments Vic, pleased for you, the new collections look so well made and look good on you. xxx
So happy for you! After watching you for many years I squealed when I could see your dreams coming true!! Great vlog! Just wondered what you fav restaurants are in NYC as I'm heading there for the first time at Christmas!! x
Your skin gets better every day, just beautiful..
I was fangirling so much when the two of you were talking! Iconic af 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Wish there was a #drybar near me. The creator is such a lovely lady!
What a dream to meet VB!!  Please post a pick of your blow dry.
Your face when you were talking to VB is gonna be my face when I get to meet you someday 😻
You looked amazing as usual! I'll be taking some autumn wardrobe inspiration from you!
Oh what I would do to be in your shoes! (Metaphorically and literally, cuz your shoes are always on point)💕
So awesome, so happy for you
My favourite Victorias combined 😍😍😍😍😍😍
What an amazing opportunity! This is why I love being on YouTube and the experiences you can have xx
So happy for you! What an amazing experience ❤
Ahhhh it was so cool to see you both together :D She is so stunning and seems lovely :D
amazing! you are on fire my girl xx
I squealed when you started interviewing VB.
I personally think VB is a bit overrated....she is ok....her style and her look is alright but nothing special....I think she is the one who should be thanking you and be grateful to  young beautiful bloggers like yourself are giving her products the time of day....\n🤗😉
Victoria was highkey fangirling lol
Hang on, hang on ... stop right there. Victoria Beckham - VICTORIA BECKHAM - said you looked lovely in her dress?! I die! But of course, she's absolutely right ;) xx
who was that girl talking at the end of the video she was stunning
We didn't get to see your blowout 😞
When you said Victoria nude, I was thinking Victoria Mcgrath nude which was YSL!! 💜
hey inthefrow! u look absolutely gorgeous and you would have outdone VB if u wouldn't have slouched ua body and carried ua self with more confidence! U were more beautiful than VB but her poised body language won the show there !
Wow wow wow I am so so chuffed for you, well done for not falling at her feet, it really must've been so hard to stay composed while asking her questions! Xxxx
I was grinning the whole time you were interviewing Victoria, so so happy for you - you deserve all of the amazing opportunities you are having! I have no clue how you were so chilled and candid when meeting her... very jealous! xxx
Loved the looks and your personality too, amazing 😍
Anyone knows what watch she is wearing? :)
Hi Victoria, what is your natural colour of hair? :)
Hay when can us in the uk buy the VB and EL make up xxxxx
I don't know how old you are, but in the beginning of the video where you have no makeup on, you look like a 17-year old girl! I mean, your skin is perfection! Please upload a skincare routine video ASAP!
Can you please recreate the LA look for us ?
Everything is so wearable. When you watch other runways there is not a lot I would wear but hers is beautiful xx
Hi Victoria! Where are your earrings from? I notice you wear them all the time and they look lovely! Love from Guam <3
awww you can tell u were totally girl fanning! So ice meeting ppl u admire :)
Wow what an amazing scientist and an amazing person too.. Not only fighting to save the environment, the fish, and the local people livelihood to. Beautiful video, I feel like I'm also getting teary eyed just like Emily..
I just got home from my visit to The Field Museum last night and now I wake up to a BrainScoop video, it's like I never left Chicago.
Fantastic work, it would be nice if people like Dr. Lesley could have the kind of prominence in society that we give to the many vacuous celebrities. The would would be a much richer for it. Thanks Emily, you're a bundle of wonder. :)
This is an amazing way to teach us about large freshwater fish. Showing us how you study them, how they are protected, etc. Instead of the river monsters bs we get on cable tv, that do nothing but perpetuate myths about these creatures killing or eating humans.
This is SO COOL! It makes me so happy to see a field scientist who's a woman of color. Represent, homegirl, and keep fighting the good fight! Also, ya'll are adorable getting emotional about fish conservation I love seeing geeky people being passionate about conservation!!
That lady has such a soothing voice. I can listen to her talk about fish for hours.
Animal Crossing prepared me for this video.
I think it's really cool how this scientist emphasizes local knowledge! it's really in line with what I learn as a social anthropology student.
On The Animal Planet show River Monsters Jeremy Wade talks about these multiple times. He had ribs broken by these trying to help net them for scientists like her.
Arapaima is an amazing fish. It's extremely old species and is prehistoric as well. It's also incredibly powerful, able to literally break bones by launching itself at you (almost broke the guy from River Monster's chest plate)
Really enjoy your videos. Found you through the No Dumb Questions podcast and been watching you ever since. Keep up the good work!
You guys are amazing. Thank you for doing such great, inspiring work. I'd love the chance to pick your brain or at least listen to a lecture or read a book that you write.
Hahahaha I cried a little too. I love fish nerd friend Dr. Lesley :)
The Dr. has great passion for her work and for the local people ... that's a good combination :)
Emily I've been complained over the past year to reach and share with you the amazing journey I've been on thanks to you.  Just over a year ago I began watching your YouTube series BrainScoop and was fascinated by the work you do!  I started thinking maybe I could be like Emily one day, being an ambassador of science inspiring young people to become stewards of the planet.  I looked into enrolling into university, but my high school grades and courses were not adequate.  So it was back to high school for me to upgrade my math and sciences at the ripe old age of 29!! Today I am 30 years old; two weeks into my first year of university at MacEwan in Edmonton Alberta.  I have four years ahead before I can officially call myself a scientist, but you set the wheels in motion!!  Never did I imagine myself ever attending college or university espt at my age!  I'm so excited to earn my science degree in biology and anthropology with the hope of working at a museum just like you!  Thank you Emily for making your videos and inspiring me!  You do not know me but you have changed my life forever!!
Arapaima are one fo the coolest fish in my opinion.
Please offer PBS this show. Kids would love it... but I guess they can watch it on YouTube, too!
She looks like Michelle Rodriguez! What an awesome study and preservation effort
The footage from Dr. de Souza's research looks top notch, does there exist any kind of fully edited video/documentation? :O
Guyana is truly an amazing place!
Aka da best fish in animal crossing.
Please do more videos like this! As a student who wants to go to college for marine ecology I love watching scientist work from different ecosystems and seeing how the science is applied in the field!
Although fish really freak me out, this is so incredibly interesting!
She reminds me of Grace from Avatar.
I wanna squeeze a fish right now but I don't think it would be a very good idea.. but they are so CUTE AND I DUNNO WHY
I appreciate the banana for scale 👉
I had goosebumps from watching this. Great vid and great work in the preservation efforts!
This was so sweet T_T
You can tell by the look in Dr. Lesley de Souzas eyes that this is her passion. This is a great interview, Emily you're great. Keep it up. It's really inspiring to see someone as passionate about science as you.
Anyone else who first knew of this fish through Animal Crossing?
I get teary eyed thinking of 5:59
My only issue would be the initial impact of inserting that Radio tracking device, I understand its absolutely no harm to the fish physically but owning fish myself i know when they get stressed they tend to hide therefor not giving you the most data possible particularly in 24 hours, Ive seen a GPS system they used here in Sydney harbour to track Bull Shark movements... some interesting stuff...  http://gpscreate.com/case-studies/shark/  You are in the Amazon... i understand that, just food for thought.
Brilliant women in science, love it!!!!!!
The world needs more people like her, using science in collaboration with empowered local people to get ecosystems and species protected.
The banana for scale in the thumbnail image is brilliant.  I'm going to start adding them to all of my architectural drawings. I salute whoever put it there.
What a great episode. It was awesome to see Dr. Lesley de Souza geek out about helping these fish.
This is supreme content! thank you for the continued knowledge and education.
I need more braiscoop i don't 5 new ones a day i love this show ......ur passion makes the show some much better
I love this channel, great video!
I love arapaima! I got to see some full grown ones at an aquarium once, one of them yawned right in my face! Instantly loved them :) So cool to know there are people out there working towards their conservation!
Thanks for the series in field biologists and the animals they study. Very awesome.
Dr. de Souza: English is Guyana's national language, but many people there speak other languages. Did you converse with the local people in English, or some other language?
This is so cool! I hope I'll fine a field I'm just as passionate as her about the work I do.
the world will always need fish nerds fighting the good fight :)
Another awesome video. I love watching passionate people talk about things they love 🐟
You can tell she's just so passionate about her job. I bet she could go on for hours about it! I say job because someone with a passion like this is the kind of person that would forget they're being paid to do what they love :)
Arapaima are my favorite fish!  I'm very happy to see conservation efforts moving forward.
Thumbs up for REALLY good audio quality!
My mom loves, no, she LOVES arapaimas. We have several in our Moscow aquarium/oceanarium.
What can we do to help?
As a complex system, every ecossistem evolves, it changes and it's always changing. How do we know if a certain change is caused by humans (most of them are, I'm sure of this one) or if it's just natural evolution happening before our eyes? We are always trying to prevent or reverse change because we made it in the first place, but if we ever see natural change taking place, will we know it's natural? How to diferenciate?\nAlso, if something is naturally changing, we know it's natural, do we let it do it's thing or do we intervine?
You should open up one and show us whats inside 🤓
Arapaima's a bloody big fish!
Now that's someone who cares about her work. Awesome job!
Thank you for continuing to include it still has brains on it. From, was it the wolf dissection?
I'M!!!! SO PUMPED!!!!!! I want to do work like this!!!!!
You are awesome, Emily! And through these videos I have developed a desire to visit the Field Museum one day! :D
Emily, I was at the Field Museum on the 11th seeing my name on the Project Hyena display! I saw you there, but I didn't say hi because you seemed busy. Just wanted to say thanks for this great show. The Field is the best museum I've ever been to.
Great video!!!
At my mom hometown, there's a mall that converted a shop lot into a big aquarium and housed 3-4 Arapaima fish about 7-9 feet long.
Loved it, but Souza is not pronounced Soo-zah. It's pronounced Soul-za
Mmm this dat PREMIUM level YouTube content. I'd like to see Keemstar try and produce this type of excellence.
Banana for scale? Are you a bit of a 9gag'er emily? Also great work I liked the pacing and interactive feel of this episode!
She looks like Michelle Rodriguez.
Badass! <3
ICHTHYOLOGY!!! HELL YEAH!!!
are they tasty?
I love arapaima. They are adorable
Very cool
Emily, please never stop doing what you're doing. ;)\n\n I have an idea (might be a stretch...): an interview with David Attenborough on the importance of communication in propagating knowledge on nature and science.
Thanks, Dr. de Souza!
I can confirm arapaima is delicious
Great vid!
Getting teary eyed about fish!
very adorable ending
:) this makes me happy
always cool info
Fishnerds for the win!
These are yummy fish
First radio telemetry adult video, for fish....bloop bloop chicka bloop bloop
love me some arapaima.
Hi!!
Oh yee
Yay!
Wow!
Huge fish
Yay! A new video!
When the fish die and decompose wouldn't the transmitter still be around providing false tracking data? How do they account for that?
if you want to save the environment so bad, you have to get rid of people and never go there again.
This is so fantastic, thank you! As an aspiring biology student (and perhaps ichthyology, one day!) I truly appreciate your videos on a world that I don't get to see here in little 'ol NZ. Does Lesley have any social media accounts that you'd recommend following? :)
Stupid intro jingle
She's hot
Fucking Hippies
This trailer legit sounds like a movie trailer. If I weren't watching this video, I'd think I was listening to a movie trailer.
How can you call yourself WW2 game when there's no Pacific theatre stories or factions
Looks great but WHY REMOVE THE SWASTIKA
Welcome back cod..we all miss u
....and we currently have dumbasses disrespectng the flag, so many brave soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice for the very freedoms we all benefit from.
Fix the gunplay now and it would be perfect
no swastika=unrealistic sissy multiplayer with lame woman and black soldiers=unrealistic=boring=no immersion=better play something else
All you people saying this will be good are gonna be the same ones complaining about how there's to much camping in the game
i am downloading it right now.. 14gb :D
so why are over 2000 people disliking? What's bad about it?
I can't wait until they start making games that happened in our era. Like the battle of Fallujah, Marjah
2:02 is my favorite part
Just when I thought there wouldn't be any more good call of duty games. Looks awesome!
This looks good but I kinda wish they’d stop using actors faces
2:01 what madness is this a Swastika owh nooo all the germans will be so triggered now
I'm gonna buy this for ps4!
Well that's good, i can tell that I will probably buy the game, but im just waiting for a new Modern Warfare :( Anyone else?
Is hitler going to be in supply drops or only for pre orders?
I swear on my mom I will like this comment\n\n\n\nYou just swore on your mom that you would like this comment.
the graphics look awesome (not to streach it too much) i thought the trailer was live action lmao
Let's be honest. Every single movie, game or whatever that uses the nazism as main topic is very sucessfull. Why? Don't know, but it's true.
What do you call a blind German \n\n\n\n\n\nA Not-See
Looks unreal. The graphics are off the charts
Omg,what should i buy,this or star wars 2,arghhhh!!!!!!!
Oh how my eyes lit up when i saw those swastikas\n\n\nThat sounded horrible
So what am I supposed to say? AWESOME! Probably the GOTY of 2017..\n\nWords do not describe my emotion!..
call of duty is back
Call of duty is back on the map
if only the graphics were as good as the cinematic movies, like in this trailer. It shows about 5 quick clips from in-game.\nBut still looking forward to the story
It looks like a movie 👍
youre all a bunch of asslickers hopin to get likes and attention, youve become programmed, 1 with the AI that is observing you, nothing but lethargic walking profiles zombies
But can we be Germans
I'm glad Activision has been listening to the fans
Finnaly a cod everyone love bring it back to young back how cod born love the ww
hopefully the graphics of the trailer will be the same in the final game
Anyone else here started playing in cod4 and amazed that people still play this?
This is gonna be great game.I just miss UK or SSSR like in COD2. :/
Can anyone tell me the name of the song?
Paul Walker is alive. He is not dead.  It is at 1:50
Awesome
Swastikas!!! Proceeds to pre order
Amazing.
so hype to play zombies
The villainy 1:10.. Goosebumps..
yed
*SPOILER ALERT*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntagonist died
Great  game
Sounds like tom hanks?? 0:25
Enjoy your arcade shooter lmao
wrong german uniform, again.
this game is going to be lit
for the first time since the days i was playing call of duty mw2 i have hope for this game. I might actually buy it, if it's not some marketing crap...
Campaign is for pussy's. Show us the multiplayer if you dare..
@0:33 I swear that that voice actor was from CoD 3
I've never seen a WW2 fps before. Having seen gameplay from the multiplayer this honestly looks like it runs on the same engine as W@W. A part from the graphics being slightly improved, the only difference between this CoD and the one ten years ago will be this one has worse balance. Why can't they be trying to evolve the FPS genre like they did with Modern Warfare 1 & 2. I guess that all the skilled developers at Activision left to make Titanfall. At least Treyarch can still make a decent game, even if they're nothing mind blowing.
I know this is all inengine and not ingame but man, this looks stunning.
why can't i ever play as an axis mission.
Incredible
The graphics are soooooo clean and fresh!!!! Im so hype to play the campaign!!!!
This might be the first Call of Duty I will play since Black Ops 2 came out.
I do not know if they noticed at the end of the video William Pierson betray the team in the minute 1:51  you see a handkerchief in the helmet and look at the end and look at the head  of William Pierson has the same handkerchief  in the helmet 2:04
Why is cod ww2 on the ground \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause it's actually a call of duty game
I preorder it
pc or ps4 yah ps4
Next level Warning: Waffen SS ARMY
About time Activision
2:02. Demonetized
lol those gunshots sounding like blasters
Wow😍
Awesome, just awesome..
bf1 2017
.
ohhhhhh mannnnnnnnm😍😍😍😍😍😍
Cant wait 😍
Swastikas are in.
thats pretty edgy
SPOILER:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe germans lose
Stuka, Stuka! Incoming!
see COD look at all these likes compared to infinite/advanced warfare
THE HYPE IS REAL
Hope they make a Yugoslavia DLC
Hmm just me thinks that the graphics are better in this trailer?
*Y O U   A R E   N O W   B R E A T H I N G   M A N U A L L Y*
😍😍😍

Can't wait for this game, it looks incredible. I've never really cared much for the Call of Duty games but this is something I will for sure be buying.

На учениях «Запад-2017» на полигоне в Ленобласти боевой вертолет попал ракетами по зрителям  The K52 helicopter shoots on the civilians during the military exercise because of the malfunction
A Russian military helicopter accidentally fires on parked cars and journalists during a military exercise.
Go watch some helicopters they said\nIt will be fun they said
“Mission failed, we’ll get em’ next time”
in mother russia, missile shoot itself!
Description has English translation.
Did I see someone die?? I need a translation!!
When mom tells you to wait in the car
Did dat guy survive?? It was brutal
How it feels to chew 5gum\n\n0:13\n\n5gum, stimulate your senses
They probably thought he was gay
was the pilot aiming for Poutine?
Not one person (that I saw on this post) asked if that poor bastard survived the missile blast?!?
But were the Trucks OK?????????
Just a heads up, don't load the guns if your just doing an air show....
So are we going to conclude that guy walking is dead ? Or
They’re doing a military exercise in a civilian area with live weapons? What the fuck is wrong with them? \n\nI’ll leave this here for people trying to explain it:(Obviously they’d need real weapons in a real scenario with civilians around, but come on)
wow, trying to kill their counterparts. Smh
When you don't have a buzzard
(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\n\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\n\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\n\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\n\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\n\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\n\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\n\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\n\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\n\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\n\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\n\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\n\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \n\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\n\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.
Ok I think I got the controls. Wait what does this button do?
I like how this gets on the trending page
So that nigga in front died...
Weak ass missile... Had it been American it would have melted the camera
That's just how you get a ticket in Russia.
Did the guy walking towards the car dead???
YouTube doesn't trend videos that deserve to be trending but trends a video of someone being hurt or potentially killed. That's fucked up
*0:13* when you forget to tell your co pilot to hold your beer.
YouTube turns into Liveleak for one quick video
That car cut him off in traffic earlier in the day?
Tf is wrong with YouTube
First off HO-LY SHIT!!!! Secondly who's the badass who gives zero fucks at 0:22 whos not crawling for his life and taking a leisurely breeze walk?
Malfunction, you mean the Pilot was being a dick.
This happens bc somebody messed with Your Mom, apparently.
Pewdiepie can't say obama is a nigger, Hitler did nothing wrong, or Jews did 9/11 but google actively promotes some guy getting incinerated live on screen.
this is some Just Cause shit .
Well at least Russian CGI is getting better
Scared me to death
the target was the big truck it hit. If you don't want to get hurt, stay away from the target Dumbasses
Scared the fuck out of me I expected a helicopter to land or something.
It is odd to see this video among other entertaining materials. Seems that people are really interested in that. And YouTube doesn’t even try to check the contents!!
And this is trending why? The guy didn't die in the video and they claim it malfunction during training  (though must say how does something like that malfunction)
In Russia, human is target practice
The russian pilot was looking for his vodka bottle, in the helicopter cockpit.
Если не только в стране, а и в армии бардак, то это - п.здец!
За пять дней учений Запад-2017 доблестная и славная военщина Хуйлостана(бывшая Россия) потеряла:\n\n— Командующего Воздушно-десантными войсками (ВДВ) России генерала-полковника Андрея Сердюкова\n\n— заместителя Главкома по воздушно-десантной подготовке генерала-майора Владимира Кочеткова\n\n— помощника главкома ВДВ\n\n— адъютанта главкома ВДВ\n\n—  трех хуйлостанских журналистов-пропагандонов\n\n— отделение из 6 саперов\n\n— корвет класса «Неустрашимый»\n\n— стратегический бомбардировщик Ту-22М3\n\n— учебно-боевой самолёт ЯК-130\n\n— машину управления БЛА комплекса РБ-341В «Леер-3»\n\nЭто только список, который попал в СМИ и подтверждён фото-видео материалами. Сколько там сейчас всего небоевых потерь не знает никто.\n\nЧто сказать???\n\nУчения удались во всю славу величия хуйлостанского(бывшего российского) оружия.
Now that shit is what I call a demostration.
Are you hurt? Try a little harder next time.
Dude in the hoodie was totally banging the pilots wife
American news agency's: Trump blows up Russia with one missile
Never new what the buzz around Russia was seen so many stupid videos from them not being able to drive being pissed drunk embarrassing themselves starting and losing fights, nobody likes your corrupt dumb ass country
Я хочу, чтобы мировая война три
As a true American I can say with utmost certainty that the RUSSIANS ARE BADASSES. RESPECT.
Не бойтесь русских\nмы сами себя поубиваем

Funny thing I was in the uk in aug 2nd to 11th and I got a little color on my skin and dan lives there!
Dan have you seen the movie Edge of Seventeen? I feel like you'd relate to the main character even though she's a teenage girl
Is it weird that I have bad sleep problems but when I listen to Dan's voice I fall asleep?
I'm Asian and I'm tanned af\n\n*Even During Winter But Now It's Spring and I'm burnt now*

@danfloating on IG
The beginning was my life; awkward
If brad doesn't come to my funeral then I'm not dying
Thank you Brad for initiating me into the Braddies
That explosive movement is too dangerous Brad. You should be careful next time
Brad hall the type of dude to call in sick for a doctors appointment
Brad, did you take into consideration that the color of the shoes might also effect the comfort of the boost material?
*tattoos Braddie on my arm*
Can we get a face reveal? Like when your not in character
Ohhh yeah babyyy
I can't believe I watched the whole thing...
No Shit... this guy just take sneaker review to another level.
Hey everyone!! Look!! It's Brian Kobold!!
Show me that leather
Detroit sure has sucked the soul out of this man
This guy uses commas to finish each sentence instead of periods.
Great video...just subscribed ...nice shoes...hope the odor goes away.
Brad can you make a video on how to tie Ultra Boosts laces like Kanye?
Is this show hosted by Sheldon Cooper?
How comfortable is the shoe you wear in the intro??
Review Brah's older brother?  I think so.
Put a belt on bro
I don’t think ultra boosts are worth it
Should i sell my yeezy or keep them.. been thinking for days still not sure. I bought it of a reseller.
Thanks for the video Brad Hall. I am a Nike guy but I think I'm gonna give these Ultra Boost a try. I need to feel that fresh cushioning and hope the comfortability lasts long enough to go for a couple of walks. Thanks again.
Been a braddie since the Oreo 4's review
I'm a Braddie for my daddy.
When are people going to get sick of the nerd gimmick? jesus christ.
Why u speak like this
Intuitive question.  It might be too nuanced for some to ask.  But still, it's a valid question.
Excellent information Brad \nKeep up the good work
wth brad I haven't seen any of your videos from at least the past month in my sub box??
we want to see your fart
Someone yelled at me and told me I looked like a b*tch but I think they meant braddie
Wear a belt. Are you a heathen or something?
I'ved been a braddy since day one
Proud to be a braddie
Actually something I’ve been wondering...
Left hand constantly wants to be in the t rex position 😂😂
Is it possible that your legs weigh differently so it could possibly disrupt the comfort in the shoes
It's an honor to call myself a braddie
Your house's windows are amazing!
i want a pair of ultraboosts but muh wallet
Brad where is your church, I would like to worship you with other Bradies
Wait is this really him
Nice shoe. I just got the grey one today.
Show me that leather
'Let's do some more explosive movements'
I'm a braddie
This is a genuine concern of mine.
Brad the lack of uploads is concerning.. how are you feeling?
braddies squad where you all at.
I'm a Brad Haller !!!!

Braddie squad where you at?
Thank you again Brad
Hey brad ive got a question concering your choice of footwear would u by any chance be pursuaded to wear air jordan 4 KAWS
The continental rubber wears out far to fast for a shoe that’s $180. I think I may only get a year with the boost I have.
thanks brad, next time I will buy new pair
1st time watching your vids. Are those Frank Lloyd Wright Tree Of Life stained glass windows behind you? Do you live in a FLW house?!!
Brad, I love you.
Brad is the reason i live
You really need to get down to an ENT guy, and have your sinuses sucked out. I have never heard a more nasal voice - and I talk to Australians almost ever day! Seriously, you have a bad sinus issue, which needs to be fixed.
Hey Brad, Will the shoe be less comfortable if I don't use a shoehorn?
This was actually VERY useful information.
I got so exited i did all of my homework for 10 months.        ...
This should be #1 on trending , and casey neistadt should be last, or off it completely..permanently...
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
That was an interesting music video, very dream like. \nThanks for your music L. Cohen.
I'll never forget you ,you've meant so much to me in my lifetime your the best ever❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌈
thank you sir for helping this 22 year old male with his life problems. your music is beautiful and that's coming from a real ghetto polish kid. Thank you to my father also for introducing me to your music, it really helped me to heal wounds.
He is still my Hero.\n I hope people don't use him.
Happy birthday Leonard...rest in peace friend
This made me cry so hard
Happy Birthday Leonard,  wherever you are now.
Teach the Angels to listen your  b e a u t i f u l  songs!!
♥ Mr. Cohen ♥\nBeautiful song...\nThank you very much ♥
I don’t need a reason\nFor what I became\nI’ve got these excuses\nThey’re tired and they’re lame\nI don’t need a pardon, no no, no no, no\nThere’s no one left to blame
Beautiful song, we love you
did a child write these lyrics
this made me sad at 2 am
To all the lovers...!
This is one of the most haunting songs I've ever heard.
Wait, didn't he die?
This is blowing my flame ...mind blowing !!
May it rest in peace his beautiful soul and may his songs live on.
I believe Leonard Cohen to be a genius and a philosopher and this simple song very moving in view of his impending death but am I the only one to find some of these images lacking in taste and unworthy? A sort of poor Leonard Graphic moving in the clouds. Really???
It's nice to honor him few days earlier from his birthday
Thank you for making art in this world of misery and bad people. Rest in peace, artist.
Wonderful ! Thank you very much !
Sigh...We really miss you Leonard...now more than ever. But hey...Everybody knows...that.
Really beautiful video, I admit I shed a few tears just like I did the first time I heard this song❤️
Poet, prophet, performer, keeper of our love.  <3
Thanks you for  your beautiful  songs, Thanks ypu for returning a bit of my Tug! I miss you Tug!
And now there's tears in my eyes
All that I can say is... thank you, Mr. Cohen, thanks for the good music and the company.
He is an angel.
i love you, leonard. thank you♥️🌹
Leonard Cohen's continued gift here, to me, appears to be about letting of mind's construct/ the material world manifestation and resting in the essence of It All. This is the kind of death that is selflessness, knowing our True Self, alive in what lasts forever in this only moment at evolution's edge. Truth. Knowing. Bliss.
Cohen died, his art is immortal
The table has come back, now majestic.
Wow.  Pure poetry and evocation.  Farewell Leonard, I wont pretend to think I will see you on any other side, but damn, you gave real sound to my life on this side!
This was probably one of the greatest birthday presents I could have gotten, Thank you for being you Mr. Cohen. May you rest in peace ❤
2:25 And could I ask you, each person to light a match, so I could see where you all are? ... I would love to see those matches flare :')
really dig the video and song. here's a write-up we did about it https://zumic.com/leaving-the-table-leonard-cohen-youtube-music-video
You are missed, Leonard Cohen.  Thank you for all you sang and wrote.
Love L. C. . We dont blow out the flame. I can feel it. You my name and you tell me from yor star that you are stell my lover. Kiss from your baby. L.J.
13 people just don't like emotions I guess
I love this song and the video is just perfect for it! Thank you Mr. Cohen!
video by the amazing Christopher Mills !!!
the one and the only. thank you, to share your life with us. I miss you.
people i no had breack downs ..your words gave them truth an hope
Oh what a great voice. Thank you for being in our mind Mr. Cohen. R.i.P
Thank you to the creators of this beautiful tribute to Leonard, the greatest of the great
Such an amazing talent!! RIP Mr. Cohen ... I've never had this thought until now but Leonard and Roger Waters sound a wee bit alike in some songs.
we cannot really function when we are so full of fear....fear is an illusion ....a thought ,,,,,,,,it dissolves in a world of love where we belong
I don't like this.
Hearing this incomparable voice makes it difficult to comprehend, that he actually is gone ... Leonard Cohen forever!
Rest easy Master Cohen. Love you.
This is my  favorite from the album. Was this video created by LC himself? I did not know of it until today.
I’m leaving the table\nI’m out of the game\nI don’t know the people\nIn your picture frame\nIf I ever loved you, oh no, no\nIt’s a crying shame\nIf I ever loved you\nIf I knew your name\nYou don’t need a lawyer\nI’m not making a claim\nYou don't need to surrender\nI’m not taking aim\nI don’t need a lover, no, no, no\nThe wretched beast is tame\nI don’t need a lover\nSo blow out the flame\nThere’s nobody missing\nThere is no reward\nLittle by little\nWe’re cutting the cord\nWe’re spending the treasure, oh no, no\nThat love cannot afford\nI know you can feel it\nThe sweetness restored
A beautiful soul. I miss LC, he was one of a kind, thank you Leonard Cohen for your style and grace
What a sexy voice.....beautiful Lenny <3
Just beautiful!
Happy Birthday Sir.
Sweet video.Missing Leonard

SZPER
When did he make a music video? He died last year
Repent from sin, Jesus is Lord
Bonjour! Est-ce qu'il y a quelqu'un qui sait qui a produit ce sublime vidéo? Merci
why does this look better then when I normally do my make-up\nespecially the eyeliner\ndamn
I did not know this channel turned into a horror flick.
I thought she was going to die So I *cried*
Pizza I mean... Lizza Looks creepy With her make-up Like that
What to see Liza and Lily together to do a collab like this up if so
How does she still look so good even with messed up makeup? I swear she is just so naturally beautiful 😍
3:00 who else died in this part?
Its actually not that bad XD
Theres beauty in pain and theres beauty in everything...
who else noticed that it took her 2 hours to flim the video 4 us
maybe for this weeks video you should do a cup song
she is my number one on you tube
This is better than some people’s makeup WITH the proper brushes 😂
Any small youtubers wanna support each other 💗
i bet when she started youtube she never knew she would put on her makeup with tools and roll around in pads for a sponser
Very creative I have to say!!!
i never thought of that now when i look at them every time im gonna laugh
Do a Collab with laurdiy
Beauty gurus are QUAKING
hah ha liza I have youtube red haha
DID U JUST SAY MIC DROP? OMGGG ❤️
but why though, Liza?
you soon silly
She looks sleepy with out meakup
2:54 bts! 😂
Best booty guru ever! Use those tools gurl!
Don't pin me! Needles Hurt!!
4:20 let's get baked
Liza: Don’t try this at home!!!\nMe: okay I’ll do it at Starbucks **does it at Starbucks**
Hi Liza I feel kinda stupid about asking this but my birthday is on September 27th (the day before Thursday :) and I was thinking I don't thing you can come down to Oregon just whenever you want but if you end up reading this can you put me in your next video? Sorry.
I swear I almost starting shaking when she brought the power tool near her eye...
You looked so beautiful 😍.p.s. that was my cousin Ryan
I was so scared when the tools were so close to her face
Like this if she looks more nicer and cooler
A girl shouldn't use tools
I legit thought that Liza was gonna hurt herself
this video gave me anxiety
Tip: don't eat while watching Liza's videos... you'll choke from laughing too much
Thumbs up if you believe liza is the most normal human ever
Can you be funnier again? 😐🙄😅
This whole video gave me anxiety especially when she put them tools so near to her eyes 😅
she did GOOD on her eye  liner!
Lizaaaa!! Can you react to the KPOP band BTS?Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaase
Is it sad that she does a better job putting on make-up with power tools than I do regularly.
I'm holding my breath when she start to apply the make up. I'm afraid that the tools can ruin her skin
you should say smeksy in a vidio
I thought she was gonna say Auto Zone so I screamed it out and now I'm disappointed because she said construction zone instead
oh, dainty. bahahahahaha\nthis is pretty hard. probably why it's called hardware. i love that liza laughs at her own jokes bc i do, too, bahaha.
2:55 MIC DROP yeah that's my favorite song army where you at
this whole time i was like LIZA NOOOOOO UR EYEBALLS R GONNA COME OUT BE CAREFUL my family thinks i'm insane.
Why does it look better than my makeup that I do with my hands?
It actually doesn’t look that bad
3:04 I had a heart attack
Please can we a freakish cast collab on your channel?❤X
HA! THERE WAS NO AD BEFORE THIS VIDEO!!
She does her makeup better than mine even WITH HARDWARE
This is so funny
she looks better than when i put on makeup regularly
What's up with 4:20
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD!! 😂😂😂
Lots of views and likes, videos aren't censored. She making money!!!!!
can you react to DNA by BTS plsssssss it's a k-pop band and hope you will like it
Why does it look so good??
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Why is she using tools that's fatal
Whats the song right before she said she didnt have lipgloss :)
Saying I have a boyfriend is getting old now, sorry stfu 😂
It took her two hours to make the video. Look in the background on her Mac.
that was pretty funny , corny and cool
She looked pretty good for putting on makeup with hardware! 😄😄
The scary\n\n\nThe most scary thing that I saw was somebody not smashing that like button
Who else was born on 420 🙋
Why does she like 4:20 so much any way?
ANY smaller you tubers wanna support each other? <3
Liza u should do ur makeup with paintbrush and paints😉😂😂
What’s with her putting snaps at 4:20??
What's lizas code for international shipping for the keys?
She inspires me tbh
Wow so perfect without makeup!!💕💕💕🍍🍍🍍
F**k
Liza looks like chiqui
U GOTS NOT EYEBROWS😂😂😂
I love lizza
I love your puns
I'm in 4th grade

Liza: oh, dainty \n\nMe: MILES IS THAT YOU
Not gonna lie. Thumbnail scared me.
Tiny baby Hitler mustaches

CaspAr Lee

Comment down questions in my newest video ＼(^o^)／
i cried more than tyler did... im still crying wtf???  and my favorite memory is when you actually replied to me on twitter like 3 or 4 years ago and told me you loved me too. tyler, you are an inspiration to me in so many ways. your videos have helped me through some of my darkest days. And honestly, you are one of the most amazing, beautiful, outgoing and spirited people i've ever seen. Thanks for everything you do. and just thanks for being you. you mean so much to me and all the rest of the fans. so keep that amazing smile on that amazing face of yours and keep up the amazing, funny, and every other amazing word that defines you and your channel work up! i love you, dad xoxo, Ecssy
That's a cute sweater Alfie DEAD
This was so cool to watch!
The thirst for joe 😂😂😂
You were one of the first youtubers I watched (that was like 5 years ago omg) and of it weren’t for you being who you are and your videos I would be a very different person and I wouldn’t be nearly as confident in myself as I am because of you, you and your videos always put a smile on my face and even though I’ve never met you, I’ll never stop hoping that one day I will
Although I've only been here for 4 years out of 10, I'm really proud of who you are and what you have done for so many people. You are an inspiration, a lovely and funny human and I really appreciate you and everything you stand for. So thank you Tyler and congratulations! 💜
I am so proud of you!! It's been over what a year or so since the slumber party tour?! Me and my best friend went to go see you in Brisbane and how excited we were. But we had no money to get your tour t shirt until we came out of the show and our mothers surprised us with a t shirt each and we cried. You've have such a long journey and honestly you can make your journey so much longer and bigger and you've got a lot to look forward to!! You haven't failed to make me laugh, smile and cry (happy tears) I cried through this whole video and seeing you feel loved and supported by all your friends and family and all of us. It was good to see you surprised. You've done so well. You'll always be a good influence to this community and its what this world needs. It's you. I'm so so proud of you and I love you with all my heart! keep it up baby.
Let me just say Happy 10 years Tyler. I've been watching you for about 2-3 years now and I remember coming out to my mom after watching one of your videos(she cried and didn't except me being a lesbian for like a year but she doesn't care now.) I look up to you so much,  When I read your book for the first time I remember busting out laughing in a silent english class which was kinda awkward but nobody really cared. You have made me so much moe confident in myself. I love you Tyler. to 10 years!!
this is too much... SAY MORE!!!
i remember  about 6 years ago he made the video am i gay
Question: Aren't Dan and Phil, Tyler's friends?
Hi Tyler!!! Ugh I wish we were friends in real life! I've been following your YouTube channel since 2008, when I was a freshman in college! One of the first videos I remember was the I'm a bad bitch one ;-) and the one about why Gay Marriage is WRONG (parody), haha, I LOVE YOU and all your stuff!!! Can't wait for TEN MORE YEARS (hehe).
Cant believe it's been 10 years since you started YouTube! 😱
Thank Joey b/c the only reason I found out about you was I watched escape the night
A few days late but HAPPY 10 YEARS! you're truly an inspiration. Can't wait to see more videos :)
I remember watching you when I was a little sprout I was 11 years old and I watched you and I thought oh my damn he's funny. Congrats on 10 years Tyler love you
I won't be able to say I was here from the beginning Tyler, seeing I was about 7 years old! Still I've been here for half of it and I love you Tyler ❤ You've always inspired me to be a better person and have always been able to make me smile on the rough days how cliché that may sound. I still hope there will be 10 more even if it's giving you an existential crisis, can't go without you ❤
Balling my eyes out so sweet
Woo I cried
aw, this is so cute! congrats Tyler 💚
I discovered you when 5ag started. All the guys are wonderful, but something about you always stood out. You are genuine and articulate and not afraid to talk about things that need to be discussed even if they are touchy or controversial. It does not surprise me at all that you have been, and continue to be, so successful. I've never met you irl but I feel like I've been on this journey with you. You never fail to inspire and encourage. The world could do with another 10,000 of you. Thank you.
I came out to mom video.
I just want to say THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, YOU ARE MY HERO, IFLY ❤️
His reaction to Joe Sugg made me have to PAUSE the video because I was dying of laughter! \nSame af Tyler, same af.
this video is filled with so much love. I am emotional. Much love xo
Tyler's reaction to Joe Sugg is absolutely perfect because Joe Sugg is beautiful
why am i crying in the club rn
Congrats man! I don't comment enough on your channel, but you're great and when I watch your vids, it makes me want to create more. I won't say Here's to another 10 years but Here's to YOU :)
The second I opened this I laughed
on the slumber party tour i loved when someone yelled troyler and i was getting annoyed but then you yelled shhhhh! haha
congrats on a decade of loveliness! 🌈💙 \n\nps~ but where was miranda or colleen, why wasnt she invited??
I would have liked to have seen some of the other 5AGs reach out. Though, I don't keep up with the gossip, so I don't know how many of them still are in touch with Tyler. Though that's entirely selfish, I admit. Since 5AG was my first experience with him & Korey.
Love you, kween!
#10YEARSOFTYLER
Congratulations 👌🏼😁❤️
LIZZZZZA(And congrats!)
Why is colleen not here?
Wow Ten Years Of Tyler Oakley
Great. So inspiring
superfruit? :(
His reaction to Joe Sugg is everything. 😂
Damn you Tyler! Now I’m getting chocked up ❤️❤️❤️ love you adorable man!! Congratulations 🌺
You were one of the first youtubers I watched and became a fan of. One of my first subscriptions and I am so glad that I found you as you have inspired so many people and I know that you have a genuine heart. I cant wait to see what else happens for you, on youtube and off. Congrats on ten years and congrats on not crying. I almost did.
Anything to do with you and Joe Sugg. I think we all have the same thirst for him. Also anytime you were drunk with Mamrie or Sawyer!!
the condom video is still one of my favourites. and the 5AG years <3
Who else cried? coz I did 😭🙂\nWhat’s true genuine kindhearted person !! Congrats ❤️
Tyler, you are just the sweetest human being. Your smile, optimism, and joy for life is just so contagious that 10 years has felt like 10 minutes. 10 more years may seem overwhelming but just know that the world will always need more people like you. These next 10 years will be filled with new faces and new hearts that will be drawn to you simply because you’re you. Congratulations & thank you!
I literally started crying I love tyler sooo much he is incredible I'm really emotional ♡
I’m not crying!! You’re crying
This is the sweetest thing😄 Congrats on 10 years on YouTube Tyler❤ I remember the first video I saw with you in it was Zoe's break-up-tag and I remember actually thinking you had been a couple because I didn't know you at the time😂 I was super confused who was Zoe's boyfriend because there was Alfie as well and it was just too much for my brain to process haha😂😂 But that was when I started watching your channel! Thank you for inspiring so many people including me each and every day! Thank you for speaking up and raising your voice in important situations like prior to the election. Like Joe said, you truly are a role model and I think more influencers should act like you do❤
I think the best memory that we shared together it is when you did your video of what happened in Pulse. You made me cry because you felt it and you made me feel every word you said. Thanks for always inspire me. Congrats!
helium balloons with marcus! waaayyyyy back when... congrats on 10 years, and to think ive been watching for the last 5!
Yayyyyyyyyyy congrats Tyler Happy 10 Years your so amazing I love watching your videos my most favourite ones are the helium ones with Marcus butler and your collab with miranda love you so much here's to the future xx
Fanfiction with Marcus 😂 or legit any bid with you and Zoe
congratolations
Congratulations! YOU ARE MY HERO. I LOVE YOU💓✨Also my favourite video was actually the one where Alfie kissed your neck it was so funny! Your reaction woah YOUR A MYTIC GODESS 💓✨ YOUR SO SASSY I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU~
HER MUM SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S READING OF SOMETHING AND NOT EVEN MEANING IT! LMAO
watching this, i felt _nostalgic._ i guess i really do miss everyone, everyone from the days. not being a bitch but *i fucking miss the old youtube*. that might sound cliché, but tyler was one of the people who also shaped me as a person along with other youtubers. \n\n2014 might've been one of the really best youtube years in the matter of vlogging and inspiring people i guess (╥_╥)
omg i cried awwww all ur friends are soo amazing and nicee!! HAPPY 10 YEARS TYLER!!!
DAN AND PHIL IM SO DISAPPOINTED ON YOU, HIW DARE YOU NOT SEND OUR QUEEN TYLER A VIDEO, YOU DISGRACE FOR THE COMMUNITY\nJk, love you guys
aww congrats love, we adore you.
LEGEND LEGEND LEGEND
9:40 awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Tyler you are an inspiration 💙
Tyler!! You helped me to come out over 2 years ago!! You are a huge inspiration!
Why am I crying? This isn't even for me! 😭 I love this so much
Tyler I love you so much, you have helped me accept myself for who I am. I'm so glad that I got to experience half of your YouTube journey with you. I would love to meet you one day, but as of now my favorite memory is when you liked one of my comments and I actually cried. Thanks tyler❤️
Happy 10 years on YouTube Tyler!! I still remember watching your videos all the way back when I was starting high school and now I’m in my 3rd year of college! Now being in college I can’t catch up on videos very often, but the ones I do watch still brighten my day 😊 You have inspired many people to be themselves and you are such an amazing person all around! I know you love hearing this .. so I hope you have another great 10 years! 💕
I remember from when you first was doing YouTube and I was like 4. Wow. It's incredible.
My favorite is one of the first times I saw you. I was browsing and binge watching can challenge videos and yours popped up. I regretted every video before that but not yours. You are so happy and energetic all of the time and I am glad you are able to have 10 years of YouTube checked off on a bucket list you probably never had. Anyways I hope you continue with what you love and keep being awesome!
i will never forget when i dressed up as you for halloween w your professional fan girl shirt and you liked it on tumblr and instagram. you helped me realize it was okay to be me. love you, tyler. happy ten years💛.
Why am I crying in the club rn
I agree with Paolo, you r the best and the cutest!
Where is Marcus?
Jenna Marbles???
Where is Miranda!!!
Tyler u hurt my heart
I started BAWLING once Hannah came on 😭
He wrote CASPER instead of CASPAR.... Love you lots Tyler, hope life treats you as good as you deserve
i'm so proud of you Tyler. I have followed you since the 5 awesome gays and your quirky vidoes with your bf in the dorm in Michigan. I have watched you grow up on YT and am happy for all your accomplishments. Congrats boy!
i was waiting for Dan to come on and mention the whisker
it makes me cry to know yt will never be the same again only the og will understand good content not all these diss tracks and hateful crap that are on you tube now a days
His reactions to joe is everything 😂😻💦
Tyler is one of the people in youtube that still makes me smile. When I'm so down and deep in my depression I watch his videos and smile again.\nI ove you so much, Tyler. My favorite memory is definitely discovering your cannel and laughing until there were tears in my eyes.\nBecause I live in Latin America (Perú) I haven't been able to meet you, but I never loose hope. Love you <3
I'M CRYING. UGH TYLER OAKLEY CONGRATULATIONS YOU AMAZING HUMAN BEING
My favorite videos are you and Marcus singing and talking in helium.  I love it and you.  Every now and then I watch this and your drunk collabs with Sawyer
Team internet is so supportive and amazing xx
tyler i remember when you posted a video about how there shouldn't be a national coming out day or even coming out because love is love and FUCK SOCIETY!!!!! #tbt
I was trying so hard to keep it together and then your mom popped up. Ugh I'm so proud of you Tyler!! 😭❤️
Tyler Oakley well now! 10 years younger and your content is great and always a surprise👍🍾I believe my favorite memory's are with you grace mamrie and sweet Hannah and when grace comes up with those game rules nobody wins LolLol you are an outstanding person Tyler and give it a easy 30 your just warming up!!!👍👍👍🏄🕶🕶🕶🍺🍺🍾🍾
Ohio state Barnes and noble meet and greet!!!! Babes ❤️❤️
This Is so amazing,but u know what wouldb more amazing...A TROYLER REUNION COME ON IM CRAVING SOME FREAKEN TROYLER
This made me cry awww, I love you so much! Happy 10 years on youtube, keep doing what you’re doing. You are an inspiration to us all 🌈❤️
I love YOU. But I'm not a fan of your super frequent SPONSORED videos.
get ingrid to 4 mil subs!
so many of your videos are sponsored unfortunately :(
Was super excited about this video till I realized you were going to show any of your actual skin care because this is so damn sponsored...😒
at 4:01 I misheard and thought you said a nipple size
You should try the milk makeup stick for blush! I don't like most cream products but I love it!
GREAT t-shirt. That colour is so satisfying!!
i love your hair!!! i need a tutorial
I’m a guy and have been following your vids for over 6 yrs now. Very glad to see you look really happy in the recent uploads. Love you Ingrid! Hello from Taiwan:)
Simple skincare is now in the Philippines and it is amazing!!! Best makeup remover ever!\nIt totally didnt break me out and I really feel so fresh after. ❤
I love Ingrid so much \nshe is really good at make up\nand had good tips \nI wish she would stop losing subs \n and re hit 4 million subs
i hope it looks less greasy in person
Could you make a vid about your dads artwork? I have seen them in several videos and they are wonderful.
If only my skin was that nice 😭 but I love this video so much!
How many times does she say hydrating'' in this video?
Definitely my favorite hair length on Ingrid!
didnt know the greaseball look was popular... that looks like you just got done at the gym girk
Love your videos I also am so happy to see u posting so much always love your videos and love how you always keep it natural and real! ❤️
INGRID! I'd love it if you did an updated makeup collection. It's been so long.
You're so beautiful Ingrid c:
Your natural hair growing is really fast？
Can you recommend a daily sunscreen for girls with oily skin?
I love this look! So naturally pretty! Do you still do that thing where you occasionally check out a new channel on YouTube and then if you like you feature it on your channel? I don't want to be asking for that on everyone's channel, so I picked yours bc I thought I remembered you doing that, if not never mind I'm crazy 😊😘
I always want to like your videos and get so excited, but then you say that they're sponsored  😒 It just feels a lot more inauthentic than your old videos used to be
I thought you liked the Garnier Micellar water but yet you're using the simple one only because they're sponsoring you...
If you like hydraton you can try out the method layer toner 3-5 layer and pad it with your palm
E a t  m y  a s s
I totally need some good hydrating products because my skin has always been combination/dry, but recently it has been sooooo dry and it's so uncomfortable! Thank you for this!!
Wavy hair tutorial please (: Your hair has the perfect undone look!
Your hair is goals 😍
Hey Ingrid! I loved this video. Having super oily skin acne prone skin, I have always covered up with foundation. It was only until recently that I started putting a small amount of concealer on with some mascara instead, that I suddenly felt more comfortable in my own skin, even with pimples on display. \nHaving grown up with your videos and now at the age of 26, I still have acne and wondered whether you recommended peels etc. to help even out skin tone, reduce large pores and tackle acne scarring?  Any advice would be very much appreciated 💜🦁
I really don’t know where you got the fact that eyebrows should be lighter than your hair, is the first time I hear that o.0 cause all I’ve heard and what actually happens in reality is that eyebrows are usually darker. Alsoooo...  I love going without foundation, So glad you’re not one of those youtubers that paint their faces with super heavy foundations. Refreshing ! <3
you're a radiant individual, ingrid <3
Trying combing through you lashes before curling them, I just started doing this and I can't believe the difference it has made!
Plus the volume of your hair!! thumbs up!!
I also love wearing no foundation! This is one big step forward for me, actually. I have never had a perfect skin, and for that reason, I have always been uncomfortable showing my natural skin out in public. I had always been the girl who reaches for full-coverage foundations. But I have being skipping foundation lately! Even though I still need to get some help from concealers to cover some redress I have on my face, I am so happy and proud of myself for feeling ok without any foundation on!
Is the Simple Water Boost cleanser similar to Glossier Milky Jelly cleanser? I almost picked this Simple cleanser, but I LOVE my milky jelly!
Looking sooooo gorg! Xo from my channel to your's! <3
What shade do you use for the rms concealer?
Heads up, the changes in your eyelashes may be from curling them, mine always did that when I used a curler, I switched to one that doesn't pinch but heats up a little and runs along the lashes, I got it at Sephora. Just a suggestion!
Oily skin is a skin type, dehydration is a skin concern/ your skins condition and it is not a lack of oil,cots a lack of water (hydration). Hope that clears up some of the confusion.
Not moisturizing when you have oily skin can do more damage than people might think. When you don't moisturize, your skin produces EVEN MORE oil. Moisturizing is important! :) I really loved your makeup, Ingrid! (Especially the blush)
would like to know for all cleansers nowadays what their ph level is.
Kudos to you for embracing your skin the way it is ✨\nI'm gonna keep packing mine with mattifying products because i'm not there yet 💔
Finally someone on YouTube who doesn't wear foundation!!!!! No foundation is always better!!!!
I wish I could do this but hey ho I have rosacea, so not much I can do without a base, when my face is like five different colours. The green primer has been helping though
So pretty, love the video and makeup look!
OMG can you trade skin with me? It looks so good!!!
Love the simple skincare products\nReally enjoyed the format of this video
I couldn’t find any video like this and then I saw this right now !!
Are you excited for American Beauty Star? I want to hear your thoughts on the new beauty reality tv show!
I don't like how many sponsored videos you do... But I like this one! The partnership seems very authentic and I don't feel scammed in the slightest.
Some of us are ugly, Ingrid.
So natural! How refreshing? I love it!
You are so pretty and inspiring! I love watching your videos and I truly love and look up to you! thank you for all you do!
i'm 35 and i'm doing makeup like this for a 18 years now.. just no  primers ..i have nice and healthy face ........ excellent  video how to show women /girls that trends are garbage
Such a nice look, Ingrid! I wish I am that confident to not wear foundation :)
I really enjoyed this video, my skin has really cleared up with the products I use (I lost the reddish patches, uneven pigmentation, unhealthy pale tone) so I am skipping foundation a lot. Your tips are so helpful - I never thought to use a primer! Thanks for a great video and list of the products. My fiance has used Simple light moisturizer (now with SPF) for years and his skin looks so good. Their bar soap is also great for sensitive skin. We are in England and Simple is a very popular option for face care. Also, I love your hair x
I just do mascara, brows, lips and covering of the underye in my daily makeup routine. But now i might add blush just cus how cute you look with it. Thaanks for the inspo!  Xx
Loove this look!! Always admired how simple your beauty routine is 💕
any small YouTubers want to be friends ?❤️❤️
You are just so naturally gorgeous xxx
You're so simple, natural and beautiful. Kiss from Italy
i can get this without even trying, it's called oily skin
she looks like a grown version of millie bobby brown in the thumbnail
It's beautiful ingrid!
My skin used to be pretty oily, now that I regularly hydrate and moisturize my face, I'm almost never super oily.
Sometimes the reason oily skin occurs is because your skin isn’t getting enough moisture so it over produces oil to compensate
First YouTuber I ever subscribed to, still my favorite. I remember when I first signed up for youtube, which I didn't even know you could do before then, and I saw a video of Ingrid' s back when she was miss glamorazzi and subscribed immediately. It was like a tv show for me, I knew what days she uploaded and I watched the video the day it aired.
I think to people who understand the concept of creating glow with makeup will get it, all the rest will just think your face is greasy looking, sorry, how I see it.......
haha when you said nickel sized I thought you said nipple sized
hi Ingrid! Please post the recorded livestream that you're gonna do today on your channel after you are done with the live session. you haven't been posting your livestream on your channel lately and I would love it if you'd do that because I live In a different time zone and always miss your lives!
Sponsored. Blah
Your skin looks beautiful!
The thumbnail is gorgeous ❤️😍😍
love this!!
❤️❤️❤️
Your videos make me calm. 😌
Oily but also dry skin squad! 👋  😄
What happened to Bare Minerals??????
Amazing 😍
LOL these intros
step 1: have perfect skin
omg so beautiful date me ahahah<3
Looks GREAT!!!!
IN LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Her face just looks oily.
This is beautiful!!!! ✨
Ingrid!! Plz update ur hair routine...
So gorgeous 💗
Beautiful! ☺️
hi Ingrid ! You're so beautiful ! bises ;)
Sweaty mess ewww😷
So pretty Ingrid!
Is there any videos from you that AREN'T sponsored? You've become such a sellout.
it just looks like a big oily lump face. Only high end products are used nowadays which not everybody can use.
I wanna run to you with a oil absorbing tissue and press it all over your face during the whole video 😂😂😂 I can't stand with this look. OMG. 😂 I'm oily AF😥
i also did a skincare video on my channel. it was inspired by watching your videos! i started to care about my skin recently as it's better to care for your skin at a young age. 😊 PLEASE WATCH MY VIDEO AND LEAVE COMMENTS :)\nLOVE YOU INGRID!!
Guys, im from mexico, we just had another earthquake and the losses are huge. If you can please donate to: \nPaypal: donativos@brigada-rescate-topos.org topos.mx https://t.co/3bVhOqXRYe\n\nEven the smallest donation makes a difference. Thank you so much.
While you're doing it, it looks quite nice, but at the end, maybe it's just the lighting, it looks just very greasy, or as if your moisturizer is still sitting on the skin. I love glowing natural looks, but that was a bit over the top for me.
Jesus, can everyone relax about that guy? I get that nobody asked for his opinion and that Sammi wasn't checking her reflection or worrying about her looks, but maybe he just tried to be nice, that's all. Sometimes I feel like people aren't being feminist anymore but downright misandrous.
Indy's face with the caption Pub lunch Terrible service at 2:08 made my day lol😂
I've had plants for 40 plus years. You need to buy pots with drainage holes to prevent root rot. Get some landscape fabric and cut out to fit at bottom of pot to prevent dirt from escaping. Also buy saucers to put your pots on to collect water run off. There's a really good YouTube channel called Garden Answer and you'll learn so much from Laura. From outside plants to indoor as well as succulents. I think you'll Really enjoy her channel. Best of Luck! Oh and Indie is scrumptious!
I miss Jason's cooking videos!!!
love anthropology!!!
He saw you looking at yourself and probably thought he was being kind putting your mind at rest. Yes I would of been embarrassed if he said it to me but I really don't think it deserves so much hate. I don't know, difference of opinions I guess.
Saaaaaammm, I'm OBSESSED with those earrings! Soooo nice!  And that red lip is everything, especially the particular red you chose matches your skin beautifully. This was a great vlog, and of course, so happy I got my little Indie fix! LOL. Oh, and as an aside: The font writing is too white, and too small; could barely read it.
Take a sip of water every time Sam says pots\n\nStay hydrated!!!
Sam, firstly, can I squish Indy (without hurting her!) bc she’s THAT ADORABLE!!! How can a child be THAT cute?!! I LOVE her!! Also, I know curly hair can be a B and so can London weather, but here’s a tip (I do h&M in fashion & adv, and, I have curly hair!) if you take a few sections around your face, front hairline....and time permitting, scatter a few more pieces here and there..there’s a quick easy way to have it feel more polished (but still wild!). That is, take a smaller iron,  1/2 - 3/4 inch, to match your curl, more or less, and simply smooth out a few pieces-  bang area, front, temple, and a piece or 2 behind the ear (but leave the end out-it’s sexier and will blend well) I shampoo, then diffuse, then curl, and it stays for days-or even when you just want to freshen up the look and not wash it...curl a few pieces! It gives a soft sexy look- I get compliments left and right! You looked HOT regardless (over the lip colour on you!) just wanted to share...in case u were interested! <3
hahaha I love how not impressed you were at that guys comment about don't worry you look beautiful! LOL i wish i could post memes on yt comments because your face was like just mmmk!
Sam, can you find a spanish hair dresser in your town I'm sure if you go to the spanish community they will do a such a fabulous job and the cost will be right with in budget I promise!!!
What music was used during the cat walk clips?
Where did you buy your phone case from?
I love your hair when it's really curly!
How do you keep Indie out of your plants? I want to green up my place but I don't want to constantly repot because of little digging hands lol
Sam you look AMAZING! &  also I'm in looooove  with your new bag! xoxo
Just an FYI it all you so called feminist. Being a feminist doesn't mean hate for men! Or anything that a men can do a women can do better. It means equality for all! Black, white, Hispanic,  Asian , lgbttq,  disabled, men and women! I dnt when it turned into a man bashing movement .
The amount of random catcalling you catch in your vlogs is - well, I'd like to say it's surprising but it's not haha. Jesus. Old men need to quit it.
Enjoying the vlogs but please for the love of god stop using the super tiny white font in your videos. Some people are watching you on their iPhones and I genuinely want to read what it is you're inserting but I really can't. Pleaaaaase.
Im burning angel food cake candle rn too!!!!! love it
Those pots were really cute! I like hearing about pots and all the homewear you get. I'm 26 and more into styling my home so please continue to share all your home decor tips!
Great video i need some plants in my home 🌷
*Are you lооking fоr hot dates in your nеighbourhood?*

You always make me miss london\nLove you 😘
Loved coming along to fashion week! Loooved the outfit :))
Hey make sure your pots have drainage holes (or place those small plastic pots inside of them) otherwise your plants might drown/die. Especially the succulents!
Have you seen the cute googley eye pot on urban outfitters website? And they have other designs too :)
i have missed your vlogs so much! <3
Love love love your new bag! xxx
Love your new handbag animal print is my fav because you can use it as a neutral and it can go with so many different outfits
this was such good vlog! love seeing more of you + Jason <3
the song at the versus show was 'spliff' by the austrian band bilderbuch- they are so so good!
I love plants too
I love your style! You're so confident I love it
I love your phone case where can I buy it! I know it's comme de garçon but where do I get it !!
Please share how you look after a plant... I just killed a cactus 🌵😩
Hi, sorry could is the missing word!  Sorry. ☹️
We are a new family daily vlog channel! Can we please get a shout out to help our channel grow!
Loved this vlog! And you of course!! What song was used during the first fashion show?
Miss Jason in the vlogs, love how real you guys are. I know he is private, but do appreciate his appearances 😀
OMG Indie's face at 2:07, together with the caption reading 'pub lunch. terrible service'. I died. So n'sync.  Haha!
Hi Sam! Just to say that the &OS earring suit you so well, you look so good in them, with that black top and eyeliner... omg gorgeous!! \nloved also your vlog backstage at FW! \nx
Sam, sorry if this has been mentioned already. Pls could you share where indies high chair is from and  whether you find it easy to clean. Thanks!
Your day to day boring (as you quote) life is so relaxing to watch, btw you look amazing in both looks in this vlog
Love that little round pot with the ridges...I think you should keep it...And you sweatty glow looked beautiful.
I really enjoyed this one Sam!! Liked the bits at home planting pots, then feeding Indie, to getting all glam and being at shows. Really showed how diverse most peoples lives are between outside and inside the home :)
You were just killing all the outfits in the video!! 👏🏿 love you Sam😘
You look amazing! I've thought about it every time I've watched one of the videos you've made since you came back from your holiday and now I'm finally writing it 😊 Your new pants with that black shirt and your beautiful hair 😍 Your videos are the only ones on YouTube I watch all of 😅 It just makes me happy... you are so real, living your dream, looking amazing - even when you are not feeling at your best ❤️ and it's a true joy when we get to follow you (almost) every day 😃
As someone who has no clue on plant names... 'my mother in law's tongue' threw me a bit ha ha! Such a great vlog as usual though :)
I LOVE that angel food candle from Anthro! I need to get another one, it smells divine 😍
Samantha Maria, I Loove you! I want to see you someday..
I was worried about you when I heard the another attack in London. Stay safe Sam!!
Love love love the blue jeans you're wearing at the end, I think they look so flattering where are they from?
Where is your black top from (one at end)? Love it x
who else goes to the loo or to make tea when a 36 second ad appears on Sams video lol. okay video see you in a bit.
Love your vlogs so much! I'd really like to see and know jason more but I can also understand if hes uncomfertable
u are an inspiration
Im really getting into plants too! but more terrariums with cactus and succulents they're super easy to maintain. LOVE the pot haul
I just realized how lovely black clothes are on you! 😍 It really suits your skin tone. Could you please consider doing a lookbook featuring mostly black?
Omg I love your outfit 😻 you always look so fly
Your vlogs are really lovely to watch and so relatable. Im not married or have a child, but I feel like I just get you :)
IM IN LOVE WITH THAT BAG WOW!
you are giving me 70's retro vibes with a modern twist....<3
Samantha u r one of the most genuine  n sweetest vlog gers.
Bring the bangs back! You look so good with them! And without but you know what I mean lol
You look so pretty in this vlog. You always look pretty but you're glowing so much... sending love from Trinidad❤️
totally get it Sammi, big highlight for you. well done for getting to this point. your outfit for LFW was amaze, need those pants :)\nlongtime fan x
Yes 😭! I miss vlogs, I've been watching old ones. I feel so calm now thank you girl 💗😌
I am lovvvvvving the dangling earrings on u!! idk how, but they compliment ur eyes!!
I really enjoyed this video, best fashion week that I've seen.
Sammi: might put my mother in laws tongue in this\nMe, someone with zero knowledge on horticulture: damn wtf she can't be that bad surely
Hello from Canada 🇨🇦 xoxo 😘 I love love love ❤️ your look at the end of this video!!! And those earrings!!! Wow! Beautiful:)
Jason eating dry bagels is soo triggering, I used to do that when there's no food in the house 😂😂😂
Hahaha at the beginning I thought you said I'm going to put my mother in law's tongue in 😂
I can't see all those captions on my phone. Please, use the biggest font possible! Lol
yay maje ... the best ever....if your ever in birmingham selfridges do come to ourl concession  we would love to make your shopping experience a memorable one x
The Maje bag is beautiful !
16 £ for one bowl OMG
Yasss Jason!!
I'm really enjoying your      vlogs!
Looking gorgeous! Xx
THAT FIRST UTIFT IS BOMB! SLAY SAMMI!! ❤️
Love your vlogs Sammi! That leopard print bag 😍
Love your lipstick 💄 what colour please
loved your outfiiittt
Loved this vlog, you look amazing. <3
More pots and plants
Realising Jason is liteeerrallly Jon Snow. Their accents are identical!\n#winteriscoming
You look so beautiful!
That maje bag is everything 🔥🔥
You look fabulous Sammy!
It's truly funny to me how up in arms people are over a man telling a woman she looks beautiful...
Maybe people should look at how women are treated in countries like Afghanistan. Then a simple, friendly comment from a man who probably thought he was being nice wouldn't be such a big deal.
That was fun to see the Fashion Week footage; right now Vancouver Fashion Week just started too! (Vancouver BC Canada) My daughter is a model in it, and it's a bit of a family event. Fun. Thanks for the vid, enjoyed it!
I honestly believe that man was just trying to be complimentary. I'm sure his intentions were innocent.
AGH I get SO frustrated when a guy tells you something like Oh, don't worry, you look great without being asked, especially when it's an older man.  I feel like with younger guys, they should know better so I don't feel bad telling them that I don't really care what they think, but I find it so hard with older/elderly men who think they are being nice and don't realize how intrusive they are.  Instead, I'm stuck standing there thanking them for what they think is a compliment.
Shout out to the Vegan activists sabotaging the event due to the all the animal use with skins and furs being used :)
loved the plant and pots bit 🌿👌
Omg that guy coming up to you and your fake laugh 😂😂😂 I don't think men realize how uncomfortable they make women when they do things like that lol.
Let us all take a moment to appreciate the man holding open the lift.
Any body else see that news interview where he was called a poundland Donald Trump
Lmao ambushed??
Wtf YouTube trending 1.8k views\n3 comments YouTube doesn't have an agenda Xd
Oh just leave you idiot you've come to my school and even when I was 7 and didn't know who you were, I was very un-impressed and confused why everybody was fussing over a fake old man.
#poundlanddonaldtrump
How is this 17 on trending with only 2k views?
He can't even sort his own collar out...
Lol he has hard nipples
May's a fool for keeping him around and he's a fool if he thinks he can be PM.
ok resign..please
Boris did nothing wrong. Fuck off, Lefty tossers!
This 2k video doesn't look like something that is trending..... Hmm...
what a fat piece of shit. would love to see him run for prime minister, because he would crash and burn
BoJo should be mayor of London still. Fuck sadiq khant
Boris should be pm he's a right laff
Hmm... All pro boris comments are found at the bottom of the top comments list. How interesting.
Two faced slimy prick , and not just him , all the global elite fucks
Speaks his mind. so what.He can only be critised for the timing of his article
And so the UK wept
I was waiting for him to get punched in the head or get jumped pr pr something 😂
Ahahahgahga the fat piece of shit can't run to save his life \n\n\n\n\nSo why the fuck is he running for PM
Don't you think he looks tired?
Needs a bra doesn't he?
Boris for PM
Very nice
This shit is trending why?

I went to the match and there was barely anyone there in the stands lol
Dele that goal made my cock hard
Dele is best
Assist for the birthday boy!

Enjoyed Spurs TV VLOG but I guess grandpa would have scored this goal by Dele!  Spurs fans seem like good guys!
Hey What's up from Ireland Sidney here uuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i love u spurs uuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i love come on you spurs im watching u on my ps4 pro ps4 pro ps4 PlayStation vr rules
If Eriksen would've been on it would have ended atleast 3-0 Spurs
Upload the whole match, please
Well played Trippier, such an improvement on last year
Cheeky feature in this video lol, was nice to see this goal being directly behind it
thats what we and trippier need to do especially in these type of games beat your man and square in in the danger area. Not sideways  or back passes, and even when we get in them areas son shoots all the time for goodness sake.
trippier plays better than aurier
Celebration??
Easy tap in 😄😄😄😄

Different claaaaaaaaaaasssssss !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Of course as soon as she tries something new, people are like we want the old emeli back, don't change your music!1! chill, let her experiment with her voice and different melodies. It's her singing career not yours.
Well she has very flexible voice for many kinds of music. If I didn't know her previous records, I wouldn't think it is kinda unexpectable. I like it and still prefer any of her music than Disney's stars. So, go with whetever you want Emeli
Emeli Sandé should win more AWARDS!
I like the song, I'm not too crazy about it... It's Emeli so I'll let it pass
I wasn't sure about this, but when that beat dropped I was like yaaaaassssssssssssssssssss queen!! Give me dance. Give me naughty boy vibes! Let's take it back to the beginning. Her ear for good music is impeccable
This sounds like not your music... Don't change please
I wont Judge or be negative as it's Emeli  It's Emeli! but I am finding it hard to adjust to this new sound' I hope it grows on me cause I simply love Emeli Sande
Different sound for her. Love it!
Am I the only one disappointed here?
Dope af
This feels really uninspired. Must say I'm not impressed and a bit disappointed. Seems like a desperate move to become mainstream again, and not even a good one at that 😖
This isn't new for her. Have you heard Heaven & some of the other songs she did with naughty boy or David Guetta
Idk why , but in a gay club this is a bop.
She is the opposite side of Adele. Her music is so good even when some hits are very sad but so good when Adele's songs are just sad
LOVE THIS!!! upbeat feel good music happy music Saturday morning clean up music!!
Great song and it was made here in Philadelphia. Now when will she perform Here?
This isnt that good. It feels rushed and very repetitive. There's no reason to rush this song since her album was released last year💁 It sounds like a rushed and cheaper version of Swish Swish just without Nicki Minaj and less instrumental breaks. This song could have done with a longer instrumental and less of Emeli's vocals in the intro, a small break between the verse and the chorus and then a bigger break between the chorus and the next verse. The instrumental sounds good, but with Emeli's vocals from the start of the song is not needed and makes the song rushed. Sorry but this isnt a good song imo
For the people saying they miss the old music, come on. She's experimenting, especially since she has few loyal followers when compared to the mainstream artists. She's talented but she does need to gain more fans
Love seeing my favorite artists grooooowww! 😄
👏👏LOVE IT!💗🎵🎶🎶🎶
It sounds dated......not good....just dated....late 90's......no melody....crap in fact....
_so lighthearted_
really like this
Feels like a basic dj remix her song. Lol. I need an Emeli version
Such a beautiful positive vibe❤️ How incredible it would be to light up the one who loves you ❤️ How incredibly wonderful it would be to be loved ❤️ Seriously to make the one who loves you feel special so spectacular how beautifully awesome ❤️ I feel it is always better to make someone feel happy because of you and definitely not sad because of you so horrible!
Look at it like this music is a feeling everyone has that first person they fell in love with, we think too much and feel too little, banger as I said, well done  emile sande 😊😊😊😊
Thank you emeli ,now i know how in music definling total shit
Sounds different to her usual style of music, but I like it. Kinda jazzy :)
Can't wait to see you LIVE!!!
I am a Dutch singer on YouTube making cover, I don't really have a lot of views and subscribers, so if you have a minute to check out my covers...That'd be awesome! Let me know what you think! Thanks so much from The Netherlans <3
AMAZING!!! Emeli can do so many different styles and I love them all.
Finally something different! Love it!!
She needed to go down this commerical pop-dance route seem that she suffered from Second Album Syndrome and followed her debut with a flop.
I was hoping I’d run into you when I was in London earlier this year😪
It doesn't mean she is going to change her music if she made a different song. You need to chill and let this amazing artist explore. Love it 💗
who typed STARLIGHT and aphs starlight roreplays come out??
GIRL GOT IT \nAnd I guess a fella just can't live without it
A little different than your usual stuff but it's fun . I hope you have found love Emeli
Wasn't what I expected but it's Emeli so I'll let it rock. At least she's trying something different.
Yass the queen is back new playlist yasss 💙⭐️💙
This is such a good song
I think the video kind of throws off the song.
fucking love this absolute fucking banger of a riddim and productions on point 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤
Can't wait for the music video 😍
Thank you so much been waiting for this song
I mean.. I wasn't sure what to think at first but after a couple plays it's growing on me. I like that she's experimenting with new sounds ain't no harm in that
oh fuck off her music's great ya'll can always leave and stfu let her try something new dam.
Yeah just watching this and its only got 2 hours online
It is certainly a different sound
This is a Happy beat! It makes me want to Samba, Rhumba, and just dance.
do what you feel and never change that ok?
So different, love it!
I love how she has the ability to sing in so many different ranges it so impressive she is incredibly talented this is such a fantastic song. Love her!
I loved Long Live the Angels; it was released on the exact same day my grandmother died last year, and it helped me through it at the start of this year, but I can't listen to it anymore. I'm so happy Emeli is finally happy again and is releasing music that reflects that. Can't wait for the other 5 tracks in November (3rd) and album 3 next year!
Comments here remind me about comment section below Flo's St. Jude as it was released. If artist wants to try something new, why they wouldn't? If Emeli released Read All About It p.IV people would complain about stalement and that she doesn't look for more. If you don't like this song, stick to her old songs, there will be more songs, maybe others will sound better for you ;)
I'm her number one fan from Iraq\nI guess the only one !!!\nBut, still disappointed .. not even close to her average songs
We at ScotSound sooo love this:-\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ62jpJZvLLMx0-0UMKN7zg/playlists
What a banger! This tune makes me happy and makes me dance instantly. Different music style, but we can still hear Emeli's style in this song and this is why we love you, girl ❤️❤️
i do wish the song was longer though , the bridge slowed down with deeper bass and the production was a lot better. still a good song. but could have definitely been a lot better. i see a lot of producers / dj's killing the remix!!!
😃
Starlight - out September 20 - arrives ahead of her UK arena tour, which kicks off on October 14.\nEmeli released her second album Long Live The Angels last November, where it entered at Number 2 on the Official Albums Chart, pipped to the post that week by Olly Murs' 24 HRS. To date, it's shifted 271,000 across physical copies, downloads and album equivalent streams.

#Worldneed @emelisand'e
This is what we are used to from Emilie - FANTASTIC😜
Veni a Argentina!!
Divine song by Diva !!!! ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaavvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyy
love❤
pop basics, not even catchy enough
I have been following you since you dropped your first album. I am personally addicted to your kind of music and I love it. But PLEASE DONT CHANGE YOUR TYPE OF MUSIC
Please emeli don't change your music it fits who you really are #an guenine and sensitive artist \nI Was expected better from you\nStill love you though
Is this a cheap demo.
You can't please everyone so all of you who says it's not her, just shut up and appreciate a real singer and songwriter doing her thang. Too many fake ass artists out here doing the same shit. I bet you wouldn't say shit if it was Ariana Grande. Please! Obvious none of you know how music works. SMH.
will not be raping the replay button on this one, but it is such a radio track tho.. so I'm sure the radio will. But, then again, so much crap on the radio nowadays
All I heard was a beat and your love repeatedly about 48 times in 3 minutes.  I'm gonna continue jamming to the previous soulful emeli though 🙏
If this is new and experimental then why has she done the same thing for the past 4 albums?  If she wants to do something truly innovative then maybe she should try writing a song with a melody.
This is how the Universe was created
I personally view this less as a bad song because it's not catchy, and more of a profound emotional adventure, with deep yet simple feelings about the need to care+create care in the world.\n\nI'm not a fan of Bjork's music, but I do understand it as music anyways, just with its main focus being about vocal simplicity & ambient tones that add to the reflective nature of the song. \nRather than say, loud intensity and a beat track- the loudness is supposed to come from the deep lonely voice, as accompanied by the sensual facial expressions & stunning visual work.\n\nLong story short, I dislike the music, like the ingenuity and fully hear the message.
I think I don't like her anymore
So, where's the music? She's been playing too much video games lately? dafuq was this?
What is she singing in the beginning?
This is so björk
What a beautifully unique woman and artist.
Wow. This girl has potential. She needs a little voice training but someday she'll make it I think
i'm just glad yer still here Bjork.  Thank U.
...one of the most complex, special, strange, complete artist
Transformed into a gate.  Transfixed by a great artist.
I love the music at the beginning. Is that an individual song too? It's so sweet and relaxing. I like the main song too.
Bjork lives in her own world and we, as a civilization, are worse off for not living in it with her.
she's of the sidhe <3
Bjork is entitled to do what she wants, and it's really nice to be witness to her journey through pain. I cant help but really miss the days when she would make catchy melodies though. Like I said, she can do what she wants, and it's beautiful in it's way. It's just far more demanding than it used to be, with very different rewards. I generally haven't got it in me to put on Vulnicura, when something like Vespertine is pure pleasure to listen to.
Bjork's music videos are more satisfying than any porn out there. Seriously.
Dreaming for a collab of her with Arca and Imogen Heap
...now waiting for the 10 Demonic Subliminal messages in music videos lists to make this awesome video complete.
there really must be trippy mushrooms growing in iceland
This is so weird, I kinda like it! lol
weirdest sex scene i have ever seen in my life
an energy being of another world trying to wake us up. BEAUTIFUL.
I wonder what this would be like taking psychedelics 😏
Sublime. I have no words ♥
Who needs to go to Peru?\nJust turn the lights off and watch this full screen.
Bjork should represent humanity when the aliens come down to visit us
There is something very nostalgic about this that I can't really put my finger on, I feel like I've heard this before, which is disturbing...
love love love love that dress. whos with me?
Now im pretty sure she's a seelie
i still wonder when does this bad taste notion begin... great song though
This is pretty next level. Awesome Björk
Someones had a meeting with dimitri👀
Björk send me a beautiful girl I pray before I die
dmt as fuck
Metaphysics, pure metaphysics...
Pure art
ARCAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!  VENEZUELA CARALHO <3
The sound design and visuals are admirable however I really don't like her voice.
Super production , impeccable spacing of silence.
How Lovely! My favorite to do in meditation is to dance with our Divine Mother <3 Namaste
Take me whatever alien nation Björk is from and fill me with this kind of energy. Thanks.
Wow!!!!!Bjork, one of the true originals, continuing to explore. Love her!!!
I am going crazy trying to figure out what that flute sound is... Is it a sample from a song? or an actual bird call? It is so familiar...
beautiful
The time of birthday by sugarcubes is so far ...  shes always good singer
❤
Once again dear Bjork does fantastic visuals.great singer producer since sugarcubes I've loved her.
She's 51 and rocking it ohMYGOD
there is another world out there
anyone noticed sex scene at the end?:)
the most amazing thing I've seen in my life\nBjörk, I love you.
I did not think I could admire Bjork more than I ever could. ❤️💜💚❤️
i think she was born on Titan...ill have whatevr shes havng please
This is perfect. I love Bjork.
One of the songs on the soundtrack for the film Mother?
There is something different in her voice and I love it!
I dont know why, but this vid reminds me of Protos...
OK I'm pretty sure Bjork is not human. She has to be of a different species. She's too advanced for us with her futuristic and avant garde visions.
WHY AM I CRYING IN THE CLUB RIGHT NOW
im stoned asf and watching this makes me feel like i cant breathe. 11/10
Stunning. Every new song, every video has her heart and soul poured into it. She is an amazing, creative force. Love to you, Bjork.
ah.. i see bjork is back to her usual shenanigans of VIBRATING HIGHER\nmuch love lol
So this is how heaven must be looks
Thumbnail almost gave me a no man's sky feel
oh look ofcourse its a bunch of floating alien vaginas
I have never listened to Bjork before. Only Icelandic musician I've listened to was Sigur Ros, but now... it's changed.\n\nThis was trippy af
*More than 3 Million views on Facebook and counting.*
I'm kinda still waiting for the song to start...
I love Björk.  She commands extreme focus and attention, and this is further proof of her abilities.  I have a hard time paying attention to lyrics; It usually takes about two years before I start to understand what any singer is saying.  I enjoy the scenery she paints with music and her voice.  This video is hypnotic, strange, and great.  It took a long time for me to actually sit down with her last two albums but that is nothing short of a compliment as I'm sure this new album will have the same effect on myself.  I don't understand this song or the video, but like any true adventure, I will prepare myself with time and wait for the right moment to embark into the unknown.  Where ever she takes you is sure to be strange, haunting, and beautiful.  Nothing but respect for her and her craft.  I'm sure this will all work out fine.
Beautiful.....
Always, always delivers.
Brilliant
Amazing
that just gave me soul shivers
MY ETERNAL SINGER LOVE BJÖRK...
Great Gate

Plesae never stop being wonderfully weird Bjork.
Bjork playing cubis puzzle game.
Mongolica.

Listening with parrot headphones = EARGASM
EXTATIC !
Simply Beautiful x
Divina sabiduría
What an absolutely treat, thank you Bjork
Who?
An audiovisual masterpiece
whoa
Boooooooooring
SO. MANY. CHILLS!!!!!!
she has a digusting accent, and voice tone doesn't help either.. i also am not a fan of her music making style.. feels unnatural and forcefully staged
NOOOOO! At 5:13 she gives the satanic devil sign with her hands! Fuuuck! Noooooo! Satanists do this. I can't believe this shit. Maybe it has another meaning...? Now I'll have to look it up again...
Such a shame she's become totally predictable. A cliche of herself. Sad.
Bruhh bts has a sound so new that it makes me nervous and sick and happy and everything i think im going crazy
*Yes Jungkook you're taking over me*
Love Yourself Album\nin my opinion Love Yourself album is one of the most prettiest album ever because\n1. it has something that singers can't do\n2. it has a lot of meaning to it\n3. The music will legit kill you
ARMY! BTS needs your vote! please vote for our boys \nVoting is on the Asia Artist Awards website!!
thanks bts i came fifth in my class. my teachers are damn proud of me.
I don't feel the least bit offended by it and neither should y'all. If anything this just proves how much BTS knows their fans and worries about them. This is how much they love their ARMY, they *care*. Take it as advice and move on, follow your dreams, focus on your life while playing BTS as your soundtrack if you will, that's all they wish for us all. 💕
Bts know us very well
Well this song was true!! But i never rejected them instead I let them ruin my life as well as saving me in my lonely days.
I have always thought that Jimin's voice is way better than jk, jk sounds too forced for me
U TELL ME TO STUDY YET TO FOLLOW YOU!!! WHICH ONE IS IT LMAO 😂😂😂 I CANT
BTS INTO BSDM? my hubby said lmao \noh man, never knew id be so happy to hear a flute, damn.
why do i feel like this song is for us (army) lol. love it so much
is this our diss track
*I can't stop listening to this song TT*
GUYS BTW the jimin part at last has wrong translation its you cant live without me not i cant live without you.TRUST  ME
this looks like one of that sings I will hear 973737374738 later and cry
This song is basically for us 😆 every single thing in this song is so true 😆❤️
why does it feel like I've heard this song before
It’s just a fan they said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nITS JUST A PHASE THEY SAID
With the lyrics, this reminds me of the story of a boy or someone luring kids by playing a song on their flute. I don't know if the title of that story is the same title as this song. Please excuse me, lol. I only knew about that story from the tv series Once Upon A Time.
Oh my gosh....If this song is about ARMY...Then im their Paradise.
Jimin is an amazing singer like really amazing
The pise v is in reminds me of haru from my little monster for some reason 😛
I feel like my mum made them say this
You're my paradise Taehyung. All of you are\nThank you BTS\nThank you ARMY\n\nI am so glad to be a part of this huge international family I LOVE YOU ALL HONESTLY
The amount of line jin gets in this is the amount of lines he should get in every song.
I’m here to save you part that Jungkook said 😻😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😮😮😮😮😮😮
Jin: Just close your eyes and listen to me closely......Me: I won't understand if I don't see the lyrics!!!!!
Wow they know ARMY really well....too well😂😤✨❤️😍👌🏻😅👍🏻😭🔥
Rampon knows i got pics of him on my wall\n0_0 i am just shooketh
Jungkook's voice in the beggining i caNOOT\nGood girl WTfF namJoOnNnNnNNnN nobody ever called me that,and he basically described all of us armys :')\nJin's,Tae's,Jimin's voice omg it's like i'm listening to three angels<3\nJungkook Don't worry,my hands are Warm,warm only to you WTFFfFffFFFfFfFf *dies*\nJimin If I am Ruining you,will you forgive me because I can't live without you because I know SaME bOO <3\nJungkook I'm taking over you Well yes,you and the other members have been taking over me since 2015 :')\nSuga's beautiful voice <33\nAhHh this song had got to be my favorite in the album,he lyrics are like they are talking to us armys.And basically everything they said was true :')<3
Im taken over you yes.. Yes you have
Im sorry but its easier said than done BTS lol if I cant study then I just cant because you guys are too handsome.
Last number of likes on this comment is your future husband.\n0. Rap Monster \n1. Jhope\n2. V\n3. Jimin\n4. Jin\n5. Suga\n6. Jungkook\n7. V\n8. Jungkook\n9. Jin\n\nWho did you end up with? & Who's your BIAS? Mine is V :)
i have 3 papers to do and ok i'll start after finishing the song
This is made me cry 😭
Fuck I'm still crying... WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!!???
The second chorus...isn't it Jin who sings first? I'm not sure...
Am I the only one who cracked up when Suga whispered his own name? Also I think 2.46 is actually Jin instead of Jungkook?
Can't close your eye ofc can't cause youre suffering me☹️😑
When I'm the only one that didn't put any meaning into the lyrics and just enjoyed the song lol but I enjoy bts like any other fan lol
Somehow this gives me spring day vibes
Such beautiful lyrics! Bts cares so much about their fans and they are incredible artists.  So amazing! ❤❤❤
Talking about the ARMYs and it's so accurate
Awww they know us so well XD
This song is literally the story of our lives.\nBTS: Start studying for exams\nArmy: NO
BTS: Y'all stop stalking us and do something productive \nMe: *cries*\n\nIt's true fellow armys as much as I love them don't forget to study or do something cause they are succeeding because they worked hard ;) let's do the same
i want to learn how to pronounce the words but i feel so cringy and they're just there on screen watching me
This song had me dying 😂
Why does this lowkey sound like it would belong in a Broadway musical?
I have nothing to say since everyone one else said everything that I wanted to say. Love u bts and this song is just amazing. Actually all of them are.
Me: Aweee this song is do cute! Don't worry loves my grades are good! I'm focusing on school wor--\nBTS: Here your reward~~\n\nMe: *HOLY SHIT YES GIMME OMG I FUCKING LOVE YOU OMG OMG OMG OMG* -FORGETS ALL BOUT SCHOOL AND GRADES BECOME Fs-\n\nRapmon: *facepalm*
We all know  that suga wants those awards so he needs to stop trying to roast us and convince us to like them so they (he) can get more awards and I have no pictures of rapmon in my room.
You know what's ironic, I can't stop listening to this.
When I listen this song for the first time I thought Jhope's got no lines in here. Turned out his voice is almost the same as Suga's 😂
everytime i hear namjoon's rap i squeal i can't even deny it
The part of the song when they said “You may struggle, but it won’t matter anymore” kinda got me, because i really look up to them, alot i see them as really really REALLY distance brothers and i idolizes them alot, they inspire me to be greater and do better and strive to live my dream, which is to be a song writer and singer,so particularly i look up to Suga alot since he is their main producer, the other day when i was on a field trip, each school there had 2 passes for participation, i was pretty much forced to cause no one else wanted to, so i was scared out of my mind😂😂, but i though to myself, if Tae can do it i can too, BTS has stood infront of thousands of people, if they can do that, i can too, it is very helpful and gives me curage to do things alot of the time.
This is the first time i'm seeing lyrics and i'm like.... oh fuck this was about me! : |
has anyone else noticed the suga whispers suga before he raps lol?
When it says 이리와 난 너의 paradise, it's actually I'm your paradise not your my paradise ;))))
BTS roasting us is my new kink.
Wait, are they roasting armys..?
Suga's whisper before rapping tho ughhh😍 IM-😇
I like it
I love how BTS have used the trope of love and obsession gone wrong to show us theres more to life than them. Yet at the same time they’re begging us not to leave. They want to lead us astray into a beautiful fantasy world while also wanting whats best for us. \nIf this was a novel or movie it’d be a best seller.
I'm a little dangerous. Yeah, I can't handle myself either. JUNGKOOK HAS READ OUR COMMENTS
JK; Yeah i'm a little dangerous, I can't handle myself either....kills me everytime!!! Little dangerous!!?? Like being in the eye of a storm is a little dangerous!!
The reason why I started listening to BTS is because when I would get bullied at school and get physically beaten every day before I came home(I had to make up lies to my family about what happened). I listened to BTS my friend said it would help me feel better. Don’t worry (I’m kidding nobody’s worrying about me), but I’ve moved and everything’s fine now. But that’s why I listen to BTS but it’s sad because I know I’ll never ever meet them or even see them in real life..
This honestly sounds like a Daft Punk song..... I WANT BTS X DAFT PUNK NEXT
They're basically saying hey, we know how hard you work to support us but we care deeply for you and want you to do your best (but pls still support us lel)
The song is super nice, I love it but Yoongi, Jin and Hoseok didn't have lines at all. :(
yes it's dangerous, yes you're sweet, yes you have ruined me and yes, you have taken over me
This song totally describes me! Lol! 😝😂
BTS literally exposed ARMY's in this!!! LMFAO
This song is literally my life in a nutshell 😂😅
Bts needs to stop this album is too fire abd ny heart cant take it. Espicially my bai V
BTS R THE REAL DEVILS HERE😂💜💜
of course jimin and jungkook are singing the most dangerous lines
You may struggle but it won't matter anymore\nYeah that's not creepy, not creepy at all...
*this is literally every army's life summed up in a song.*
i listened to this song a few times before reading the lyrics and actually liked it a lot....and now I am shocked because the lyrics are so different from what I expected them to be...\nbut I still like it. It has a nice twist
i got butterflies
Do....d-do they know a-about th-t-t-the ffs.......t-to?
Jungkook\nRap monster\nJin\nV\nJimin\nSuga\nJ-hope
Tf bangtan u spyin on us or whaaaattt

Bts <3
my fave!
maravilhosos
Idk why I see something hot behind thoses lyrics XD
*JHOPE STARTS SINGING* 😂
The best song ❤💖
Normy, Normy, Normy....SJWs Normy!...they're not funny Normy!
why is this sooo uncomfortable...? It's like they got in a political argument just before taping.
Norm why don't you interview Jim Carey?
Guests I'd like to see...Jeff Ross, Rob Schneider, Artie Lange, Jim Breuer, Denis Miller, Conan with Andy Richter.
This is actually a brilliant episode.  By being a giant, drugged up asshole, Norm managed to make somebody as unpleasant as Margaret Cho almost likeable.  The audience can sympathise with her.  I was genuinely interested to learn more about her life at one point, then she lost me at the Muslim stuff, but for a brief moment in time she was actually a real human being, not this asshole licking lame joke machine.
I think we just saw where Norm comes down on the Not all Muslims argument. (and no one got it. \nCho just said how true or something like that.) https://youtu.be/Nkddddt_IVE?t=31m55s
My favourite episode this season. I prefer the ones where norm is weird and almost trolling the interview. To much of this season has just been serious interviews.
This episode is like a resignation letter.
Margaret was a favor for fucking, Jerry. WTF Norm. Quality man! Fucker's lowering standards.
Norm was trolling both of them with the ISIS permit and following joke about the 'dirty bomb' and they had no idea. Brilliant.
That was the worst episode ever. That woman is simply not funny. It felt awkward even watching.
What is brand shirt Norm is wearing at the first sponsored clip of this show? The one with the letter ‘B’ on the right. What does that mean? Butt.
not one of the better ones.
This show is going bad , not funny anymore
this is a prime example of how PC/SJWism has ruined comedy
Boy that Adam Get really is a fat fuck
What the hell is going on? Where are the opening remarks that last more than 2 min? Where is the abusing of Egret? Where is the rebellion? Why is this becoming just one more talk show or even worst: a comedians trying to look intellectual-showcase ? If Cho or whoever is gray & dull make them pay. You don't care. You should not care. If they think they are something special that's their problem especially when they are not. We can not keep watching the old episodes like: Stoller, Swardson, Nealon etc etc just to cheat ourselves that these are still funny. NML was the best of the best. WTH???? Or am I just missing something? Or is this Meta? The whole thing?
Fuck, Adam is the worst on camera.
norm needs to lay off the xanax for real he's too somber, and this interview sucked shit
'I don't like doing homeless guy jokes, fuck those'
Bob Hope was fine in 1989/90. He was fine in 1991, 1992 & 1993. He did stand-up in the UK in 1994. What's wrong with Margaret Cho's dates? They're starting to seem more like Margaret Cho's lies.
Did she just copy Mickey Avalon's My Dick song?!
Deleted every one of them. \n\nI'd best go and pray now!
Oh boy, you know it's gonna be a good episode, when Norm starts it off with a nazi joke
Margaret Cho what a twat, any excuse to shit on conservatives it's ironic that the joke is why would anyone be apposed to killing ISIS and she has to turn it around to make a point saying fuck conservatives. I detest the religion as a whole being a vile sexist, destructive, oppressive religion but we can all distinguish between ISIS and more moderate Muslims you pig.
In which Norm continues his recent unfortunate trend: first Mike Tyson, then Caitlyn Jenner, and now Margaret Cho. When are you gonna have COMEDIANS on again, Norm?
NML close to jumping the shark.
Everyone loves Margaret especially me.........Ok now let's see the funny Cho?
Margaret Cho basically says its bad to say isis hunter because it generalizes muslims, and then proceeds to generalize conservatives. This is why leftys are fucking idiots
What a brain dead liberal. Proved it when she took the bait @31:53.
Man, Norm's flinch after the Lizzie Borden joke is too funny
Hahaha! I really liked that part where Margaret made the asshole licking to battery testing comparison. It reminds me of that time that Jim Norton did the exact same joke in his new HBO special. What a funny and original gal she is. What a hoot!
So is that just a straight Mickey Avalon My Dick rip off or was he involved somehow?
44:03 pizza joke is funnier when you put them emphasis on ITSELF
One thing I've learned consistently from watching Norm Live: not a lot of comedians or comic actors actually have senses of humor.
One less bar, norm. Just one.
I dunno who this Buckley character is.  I thought he was doing Hannibal Lector.
Why is Norm pretending to be more senile than he really is? I mean... I know why, but... you know!
Jesus Norm, could you put some effort into the show with Margaret Cho. Stop taking what ever meds your Dr has prescribed  you.
I heard Hitler was a bit of a jerk.
I watched videos of Bob Hope from 1990 and he seemed pretty mentally alert.
I love how diverse this season is! Doesn t matter if old white men are funnier, but as long as its diverse!
God she's a bore...
clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Margaret is starting to resemble my mother.  And I hate my mother. Ok I find my mother extremely annoying and try to distance myself from her as much as possible.  Hate's a little excessive.
I've seen nearly every episode save for the Adam Sandler one and part 2 of Gilbert godtfried. This is the only one I didn't thoroughly enjoy.
Norm doing his best Eric Andre impression.
on Hitler: ..and I do not care for that man. Norm and/or my Grandmother.
Bobby Lee part 2 was very disappointing, this time around there was no chemistry or connection. Norm seemed a little bit out of it. He didn't even get any funny story's this time. No wonder they didn't open the season with this one.  This one might be the worst episode of the entire 3 seasons.
I've recommended season 1 and 2 to my friends. Not so much for this season...
I love Norm but he can be frustrating at times.
Norm, buddy....are you okay?   Let me know
I mean this guy was a real jerk!!!
HMMM, SHE SAYS SHE SOCIALIZES WITH SUPER DAVE OSBOURNE, BUT THEN SHE ASKS IF HE STILL SHOOTS HIMSELF OUT OF THINGS AND VECROS HIMSELF. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SHE REALLY KNOWS SUPER DAVE AT ALL.
But they never suspect THE DEACON!
does margaret not like norm...or just not get him? she comes off like someone's nervous, humorless aunt that wandered into the studio.
I thought that was the boy in those Karate movies of the 80s
Is Norm stoned or high or extremely tired or something? He looks like he is about to fall over at times.
It's a bird
i don't find her funny anymore ...
when adam eget is more entertaining and interesting than the guest.
13:23 omg I can't stop watching this over and over
she's just an old chung of coal.
boy Norm did NOT look like he wanted to be there...either that or he had copious amounts of xanax
Light camera....dark camera.....light camea.....dark camera.....I fuckin love this show!  That and Margaret started off with Ari Shafir's joke about liking assholes is like a 9 volt battery.
i bone no one
I thought comedians were supposed to have a sense of humor.
What do you do with a guest that isn't funny and you don't respect?  JOKES for 15 minutes and the guest has absolutely no fun with it the entire time.  TRUE COMEDY
Cho in a nutshell- Don't generalize about Muslims! while she generalizes about conservative Americans. I don't think the sentiment going around in conservative circles is that it is OK to think all Muslims are ISIS, but I guess it is OK for her to generalize while she criticizes others for generalizing. 100% aside from her hypocrisy, this was the least funny episode of the entire series- except for the Lizzie Borden and Mamie Eisenhower jokes.
You know, I am a self-identifying conservative and it is true that I DID want to kill all Muslims. ALL OF THEM. But after hearing Margaret shine light on this subject and really illustrate how ignorant I was being...as a conservative, of course...it has made me really do some self-reflecting. I guess she's right. I guess we shouldn't kill all Muslims. I guess that not all the billions of Muslims world wide are terrorists. I'm glad she pointed out the ignorance that all us conservatives hold because I really did think that all Muslims were evil terrorists. Wow. Thank you Margaret. But now my conundrum is, can I be a conservative who doesn't believe that all Muslims are evil or should I become a liberal who makes sweeping generalizations about the ideologues of conservatives? \n\nHmmmm...
I have watched most all of Norm Macdonald Live but this one...uggh. Not remotely entertaining. \nIt's not too late to delete this episode, Norm.
What the hell is the meaning of this?!
Margaret Cho's impression of a dull lady with nothing to say was irresistible
I have no idea why this woman is famous.
The ISIS hunting permit bit culminating in Norm's friend's biggest fear is fucking sublime genius. It is so deadpan I missed it as badly as Cho and Eget the first time I saw it. But Norm masterfully hooks them into revealing their banal PC ideas that basically are the same ones Barack Obama had (after every Islamic atrocity in Europe the first thing our former POTUS would say was words to the effect of 'Islam is a great religion of peace', b/c he was more worried about the blowback than the safety of Western innocents at the hands of crazed butchers). Norm set it up in such a way that they were completely unaware they were subjects of his satirical observations. Cho's that's true was the coup de grace. Anyone who wrote off this episode b/c of the guest is missing classic Norm.
I remember when Adam's shoes were still clean in season 1.
I'm going to the bathroom and take a Margret, then I'm going to wipe my Cho. She really knows how to put the UN in funny!
YES!!! JOKES!!!! too bad margaret is fucking... ugh
It's Spike Milligan
john c Riley
Jesus train wrecking Christ
Egret is as fatbody.
Fuckin fuck margeret cho
Margaret Cho, beautiful, great guest
always amazing Ms. Cho!
oh jesus H christ...my pus ?
Worst episode ever.
Cho sporting the Joyce DeWitt hairdo.
jokes are back!!! thank you jeebus
Egret is getting fat.
Good episode. Minus the viet cong fella.
Yet another awesome show, Norm.
Discovered by a barely alive Bob Hope... that explains it. Seriously, this show dragged. Apparently to be a comedian you don't need to be funny off-script.
Bring back the makeup girl!
It's hard to tell if Norm is pandering to, or trolling, the sociopathic retards in his comment section anymore.
Mel Brooks: Stupidly politically correct society is the death of comedy.  The master has spoken.
for some (stupid) reason, alt-righter fans of norm have concluded that since he's made some right-wing sounding comments over the years and likes fucking with people, that he is a *sociopathic maniac* who mocks his liberal guests' very existence just by having them on - while appearing cordial on the surface. all done as a nod to the enlightened few who truly understand him. every fan who knows norm well enough knows that they haven't the slightest clue about almost anything, least of all the things he's spoken about.
This podcast needs to be age restricted...Must be 40 years old and up to watch. To hear so many stupid kids spitting and bratting in these comments sections, it makes me sick.
What a generous guest. Norm was a total ass.
Reading the comments I really wanted her to be funny or interesting but she was the anti thesis of comedy.. maybe I didn't get it, I dunno.

I can hear the pain in his voice, it's so clear... But that has only increased my love and respect for Mike. In spite of everything that has happened and how it affects him, he still talked to us. And not only through social media but now also on the radio. I can't even imagine how he - and the other guys&Chesters family of course - must feel. The fact that he reaches out to us is just... it's just downright special and emotional and ugh I don't even have the words. I'm really fucking proud of him, and I know that the LP family will always have not only his back, but also the other guys' and Chesters family their backs. One day at a time. We will remember Chester forever <3 Always in our hearts #MakeChesterProud #fuckdepression
Hey I'm thinking about you. I care. And sometimes that's enough.    Well.. Freaking true. It's so relieving to hear his strong words too, though.
Its Nice to Hear Mike Voice After 2 months.
If Mike ever sings that song himself there will be tears
It’s so hard to see that things are moving on without Chester, those 2 month felt kind of empty for me, and for a lot of people here i guess...\nBut it really helps to hear mike’s voice...\n\nThank you LPA to share this with us !\nDoes anyone know if there will be a live stream of the show ?\n\nAnyway, i think it’s such a symbolic date to honor his memory, just a few days after hybrid theory’s birthday.
Will it be streamed for those of us around the world. \nI would sell my kidneys and liver if it meant I could attend this event, but it's not possible for me. \n\nCome on, please there's got to be some way you could let all those who care to be part of it.
Hearing Mike speak of Chester in a past tense is so heart wrenching.
i am so proud with how strong the guys are being <3
♥ LP
How the fuck you dislike this... and it has 30 dislikes, which means 30 stupid people were on the same place, small world huh?
We love you Mike!!! You are #MakingChesterProud
How can pple even think of disliking this!
My heart goes to LP, the fans, the families, and everyone. Chester and all of LP have helped me and many, many of us through the years! One More Light makes me cry every single time. And I wish one of us could have reached Chester the way he reached us.
There's no way in hell it's been 2 months already since he's been gone.....omg.........
I sense the pain but fortunately he sounds calmed as well. I pray depression never gets you Mike, remember the love of not only your family and friends but all your true fans. Peace.
Who's gonna be singing chesters parts???
i wish i had the money and a way to go to Hollywood bowl for the memorial show
Mike's voice never ceases to be medicine to my soul. Thank you, so much Mike, for being the strength for the fans and the genuine spirit who never stops caring. Who cares if one more light goes out? Well, WE do!!!
Really hope they live stream October 27th 🙏
Who were the 24 people that disliked this?
You can feel the change in the way he talks.... :(
And a DVD/B-ray of this show just to be fair to every fans around the world
Is the concert also going to be send out live on YouTube or Facebook?  I really want to see it live.
Thank you so much for sharing this. As a fan the lost of Chester really hurt. I cannot begin to understand what his family and close friends are going through. :(
it is so nice to hear your voice Mike,i love you,Chester and Linkin Park  forever in my heart.
I whis I could come to the consert but it to far away.
the great thing about this interview is that you didn't ask any specific questions about the passing of Chester.
Man it's so nice to hear Mike and just anything about how they're all doing. 💜
If us,the fans,are broken i can't imagine what his family and rest of the band are going through
Jesus has it been two months already? Damn feels just like yesterday. Miss you Chaz
I have been a fan since the beginning. I am now 54 and still with them.  My heart was broken and still hurts.. so good to hear Mike so positive.
I hope they get austin carlile for the oct 27 tribute concert.
THANK YOU FOR THIS LPASSOC. JUST WANT TO ADD....I WOULD LOVE TO\nSEE LP CONTINUE ON WITH\nJUST THE FIVE OF THEM, NO NEW LEAD SINGER, MIKE IS NOW THE NEW LEAD, MIKE SHINODA HAS \nA GREAT VOICE❤
Right now it's good to hear Mike. It's good to hear a follow up.
Chester's death was a very painful memory but I cant believe that Mike can hold in all that sadness
I cried during this whole interview.
So great to hear Mike in an interview like this. You can tell how broken up he is, but he's still keeping his head up. Good for you Mike. Stay strong, Shinoda. The fans still need Linkin Park. We need you guys.
Every time Chester screamed I do toward the end of One More Light=goosebumps.
Mike is such a great nice guy. This was a good interview and very touching.
I am glad to hear Mike's voice. I'll hope everyone is okay. Dave, Hahn, Rob and Brad too. It is very dark time losing someone we loved. \nThank you so much for making this interview. At least, I know any progress about them. \n\nPS: I don't have twitter, facebook and instagram. So, I am kinda outdated to get the news.
I can't believe people have disliked this video smh
pain in his voice... But good to hear Mike's laugh.
idk why i find this hole chester thing suspect but who knoes
Please don't stop Linkin Park. \nPlease continue your fantastic Job. \nI love you guys.
Glad to hear Mike Sounding so well!
earphones on and closed my eyes\n. i don't want to get distracted from hearing his voice, after a while. and to hear he sounded okay.. make me feel okay.\nthank you for this. :')
The Two months since Chester passed away... was enough thank you... bye
Wish I could be at the upcoming event. \nGreat to hear from Mike!
So who's excited for new Fort Minor tracks?
It felt SO GOOD to hear his voice again
So good to finally hear Mike's voice... Thank you so so much for uploading this.
I am very grateful for this
Just started on youtube to capture all the shit me and my mates get up to so any views, likes, dislikes or subs would help but shit i wont loose sleep if im still on 0 in 3 years 😂😂
Mike is so strong, I am so proud of him and LP. Its a heavy time for them, for us, for all fans. Its good to hear him. Stay strong, guys <3
Thank you Mike , is this show going to be recorded or live broadcast so fans like me from Europe can see it too?
Damn it, I cannot help crying just looking at the comments.
There's a reason he's 'The Glue'
I got my tickets to this show today. I hope this will be a good time for everyone, and a source of some closure.
I love u guys so much and I am very sad that I can't come to the show in honour of Chester just because I am living so far away😔
3:20 one more light - how this idea pop out - heart breaking story </3
I'm so happy to hear Mike's voice again. I can't even begin to imagine how tough it must be for him, the rest of the band and Talinda. You guys handle it with a lot of care and dignity, and I wish you all the best in the future. Won't be able to see you guys live unfortunately, but I will always be there, making tributes and doing my best to support you. Thank you for everything.
Much love and respect Mike and LP and all Chester's fans, and family!
Such a Great Person.. stay strong r.i.p chester bennington 😭 he's an Angel now
😢💔💔💔 so much love to the #LP and the family rest in peace chester bennington xxxxx
He definitely was choking up while talking about the making of One More Light. I feel horrible for him and the rest of the band plus Chester's family.
Is there any chance of that tribute concert being broadcast online for other fans throughout the U.S. and around the world who won't be able to attend?
Mike is really in pain.......rip chester
I like that they didn't ask him about Chester's death and just let him speak a little bit about it
Wish you all the best Mike, the hole band and Chesters family..❤❤
In the tribute concert I would like to see the band members together sing One More Light to end the show, makes me tear up just picturing that in my mind.
Thank You Mike for this from 🇩🇪
This broke my heart a little.  But I needed this. I really hope they come back to tampa fl and do something.  I need to see them and cry out . Not to sound like a little bitch,  but this band has been in my life sense the 9th grade and I'm 33 now
it's very comforting to hear mike's voice
He really likes to say the meat and potatos XD
Its been 2 months...2 months of sadness.R.I.P Chester Bennington.
it's so good to hear his voice. the guys are so strong and i know that they're gonna get through this even though the hole in their hearts will never be filled by anyone else ever again. i miss Chester so much and i know that he'd be proud of everything the guys are doing. i love them so much and hearing Mike's voice and his laugh gives me comfort in this hard time ❤️
This is so hard to listen to but it was nice to hear Mike again. Thank you for uploading this.
2 months? thats fucking crazy, yet people like already dont care. probably because we get new information so fucking quick n more new news over n over than people jus forget. we need to like get rid of this way of getting information, i dont think its good for us
rapper best
So nice to hear from you, Mike. Sending you much love and wishing to be there at Hollywood Bowl on October 27.
Thank you for uploading this :)
Keep strong.
Thank you for sharing.
This just came up in my recommendations and the first thing i thought was 'how can Mike be so strong about this'. He is amazing and i love them so much 😊
The fact that he had the strength to talk like this , makes u hopeful and to be more positive. #staystronglp thank you for this
LP43V3R
#RipChester 😢😢😌😌❤❤❤💔💕💕

Tearing me apart💔
Thank you. Love you Mike ❤️
Breaks my heart ........
The Best!!!!!!!! Hungary
Kevin & Bean!
Mike <3
Como tw extraño Chester la banda que ara sin ti has dejado un vacío en el corazón y en el alma tanto dolor 😢
I was my whole life a big fan of this band and there is this last consert! as a normal guy from vienna i guess there is never been a way to get there and listen to them but i hope they stream the shit out of there so i can watch it at home <3\n\nThanks Mike for this great Interview!!!
thankyou so much for this Mike , LP4LIFE!!!!
You can hear it in his voice that he's still hurt. I feel for the guy but it's pretty amazing to hear his voice and to hear Kevin and Bean lift his spirits up. Good interview.
None of that DOS buildup, and WEEZER!!\n\nWindows 95 was the SHIT!
this is the kind of acting that made daniel day lewis retire.
An entire orphanage full of children must be sacrificed to make amends for this video.
It was funnier at the academy awards
I feel bad for these Celebrities,Don't be a cyberbully
Gal Gadot is a freaking angel. Gosh, it’s difficult not to get stuck in a time loop when looking at that lady. Yowza.
Kristen bell is so beautiful
Guys sub to us We bout to post raw videos

Emma Watson is a beautiful woman but when you put her right after Gal Gadot then she doesn't look as great. Lol
They can't be going at my girl Gal Gadot like that she beautiful af.

לייייייק מי שהוא ישראליייי
4:54 that scene of Deanna Troi got me through Junior High.
Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a 2012 meme as a thumbnail.
Riker Manoeuver got me lol. I don't remember Patrick Stewarts acting was that good, It is hard to rival this show because of him.
Please do an honest trailer of Star Trek Voyager that would be great
Are we sure this is as good as we remember?
Pls do the office us next
I still have chills down my spine at the There are four lights line.
Just gonna leave this here at 4:54
For next month do Honest Trailers for Grimm since the series ended and had a huge fan base.
Kirk or Picard? The answer is easy, Benjamin muthafucking Sisko
can you believe I have never watched a single episode of star trek!?!?!?
my fav bit at 4:02 starts and the Kardashians Omnipresent Leatherskinned tyrants bent on galactic domination if there ever was a trailer warning of aCardassian sub speices rejected by there own culture we have been given it!
please say: I'm not a corporate stooge.
But like, this is so spot on and great
Grew up watching TNG. I never realised The Riker Manoeuvre before 🤣🤣 ... too funny.
One of your best works to date! And they're all good!\n\nOh almost forgot to say NUDE GHOST!
It must be hilarious as an actor to have your habits pointed out to you. I don't pull my uniform down all the time-Patrick Stewart. Oh, wait. Yes, I do. -Also Patrick Stewart.
7:20 they are right, Star Trek the Next Generation should be called Star Trek the Next Concert episode  I think as many as 40 episodes of it's 169 had some scene of the crew either playing or watchign someone play a live intrument, play as a band, or orcastra.
Well done. :D\n\nOh and please do Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek Beyond.
Well done, Dan. Also, a big thank you from someone, who remembers when Star Trek was still attempting to strive for greatness. LLAP
This was the longest Honest Trailer ever I think.
Okay you are not allowed to complain about blatant advertisement in movies if you are blatantly advertising in the beginning of your video
Lol that was the worst trek episode ever with the ghoast
In fairness, you can't break your hand as easily from palm punches.
Hey, I love the one with Mark Twain!
There are Four Lights!
Do Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan for the 35th anniversary this year please!
Patrick Stewart made the series. And is the only one to stand the test of time. Legend.\nKirk vs Picard? Always Picard.
So that troy loves chocolate ?? is somehow wrong??\n\nLots of people love chocolate.\n\ni have never met anybody who dont like chocolate\n\n\nSo why is it wrong for troy to like chocolate??\nShe cant like chocolate just cause shes  a woman ?\n\nis that it??\nor was   it because it was acted out by troy  ?\n\nWould it be better if it was acted out by picard somehow ?\n\nyour logic baffles me.\ni thought the love of choolate  was not  gender based.\nSo what actually is your point for showing this fact ?
Please say: Through three cheese trees three free fleas flew. While these fleas flew, freezy breeze blew. Freezy breeze made these three trees freeze. Freezy trees made these trees' cheese freeze. That's what made these three free fleas sneeze.
I'm a huge original series fan who could never stand Next Generation even though I really like Patrick Stewart as an actor. It was far too lovey group huggy, express your feelings 80s nonsense for me. While the original enterprise had the austere look of a naval vessel, the next generation ship had all these lounges and cocktail bars. The ship's PSYCOLOGIST was a member of the bridge crew? `The Romulans are attacking, councilor? How do I feel about this?'
I'll admit, as a kid I watched this mostly to see Counselor Cleavage.
Hey! The episode with Picard turning into a kid was hilarious!
Emperor Palpatine must be on the Enterprise with all that Force Lightning going on.
Honest Trailer for Justice League Unlimited (and you know, JL is coming soon)
I need to make more accounts so I can like this more.
Can't forget about the dead Tasha Yar...   \n\n\n\nOkay you can forget about her
This is so good.
I loved the montage of Stewart reciting the alien languages.  A world class actor who remained committed to his dialogue even when the writers clearly fell asleep on their keyboards.\n\n*Ahhhhhhd klaxon lees blaj blan ach niq*
Sir, where is Transformers: The Last Knight Honest trailer.
before it turned to a meme
No word about Troy's BEOOOOOOOOBS?!!!!
Who is better Kirk or Picard? Well the answer is neither the best Star Trek Captain is Captain Benjamin Sisko.
the picard maneuver was exactly the one thing i noticed right at the start of the show  and have been wondering ever since if they made his uniform purposely smaller :)
It's pronounced, Picar, not Picar(d)!
Please do an honest trailer for Transformers: The last knight.
Which is better Star Trek or Star Wars? #HonestQuestion
Dan, I love this!! 🖖🏾 I never noticed the way Will Riker swung into chairs!!! 😂 Hilarious! Picard speaking in all those languages in one riff! Lots of concerts! Seriously so many concerts! Can't wait to share this! What about Guinan?
Gosh. How I miss the 80's
hurry up and do the ring movie
How is it the holodeck never made it to this trailer?
Does this contain spoilers for someone who hasn't watched the show?
4:55 and THAT is why Troi is hotter than 7 of 9
HAHAHAHA! Holy F%cking Sh%t! I never got into Star Trek cause every time I turned the channel to it it always looking so f%cking boring! Even after the watching the reboot movies and that famous Picard lights episode, still couldn't work the nerve to hop in. But, if the show is anywhere near as ridiculous as this video here presents it as, maybe I'll try again to reconsider it.
Lol, well done! Also, so true about Worf getting is a** kicked so often! In S.T. klingons are described as the strongest warriors - the sayan of that universe - but facts do not keep up that statement.
oke, that kardashians part made me laugh so much
How on earth did I never notice the way Riker sits before
Star trek Discovery is available on Netflix Australia though (along with rick and morty)...........too bad our Australian internet speeds suck
To suscribe where no one have suscribe before!! 😂😂😂😂
I'll take this Riker maneuver over his weird, tongue one.
THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS! Is my favorite Star Trek quote of all times
As a child of the nineties who did not watch this show, I just have to say: that isn't William Riker, it's David Xanatos!
OMG I loved this! Please do Star Trek Voyager! Or really anything else Star Trek!
Oh for God's sake please do Doctor Who classic or 2005 one
Please say How about advertisers put their aaaads before the clip instead of into it as well?
This honest trailer is more long that the hope of the poor!!
Not sure who was hotter. Troy or Crusher
I'm Team Picard, as any discerning Trekkie should be
Please say: That space ghost had great taste in women.
Great work. Good job. Thumbs up. Magnifique! But damn I hate these commercials. I want my old HT back- without these messages. We had this creativ room, free of these crows, these vampires who always want to make you feel like you are missing something. Hate them! Leaaaaave me aloooooone!!!!!!!
Do a Stranger Things Honest trailer before Season 2 comes out
It ran for seven seasons. There are bound to be a few clunkers. But being a chocoholic isn't  even a particularly  feminine trait.
Heeey it also had space battles, at least two
There MUST be a star trek tng tv/movie fights after this
The best star trek the new one is soooooo 💩
you left out O'Brien
Picard for sure.
Vegans rule!

British Airways sacks stewardess behind racist rant against Nigerian passengers\nJoanne Wickenden sparked outrage after recording the racist clip in her BA uniform before flying from London Heathrow to Abuja on Friday night\nThe 23-year-old said today that she was set up by a BA colleague who recorded her and shared the clip\nIn a statement today the airline said 'she no longer works for British Airways', adding: '​We expect the utmost professionalism from our staff when they are representing British Airways.'
She forgot to mention her vagina and make fun of that....yanno, female comedians
degenerate, what happened to Europe?
Sounds like she grew up in a shithole.
The *Only* thing wrong with this video is the vile cunt who recorded it and uploaded it.
When she did the hand gesture swinging
I think it would be a better punishment to keep her on the Nigerian flight route indefinitely just so she has to face the people and watch them ridicule her daily
If this was a live comedy sketch there'd be no problem
Dindus ask for upgraded seats because their dicks are toooooo big.... right.....
None of them nigerian fuckers could even understand her accent.
Get a FREE MS Office setup & Install Product Key, Click Here\nhttps://goo.gl/YAdFPL
So this girls life is potentially ruined for  a little joke. fuck this PC outrage culture.
Doesn't really sound racist...stupid ? Yes but not racist. You can clearly hear her love for our BBC's
This was hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂she wants that BBC
This woman is a hero
Deserved the sack for being an absolute moron. Incredibly embarrassing women. Hopefully will end up working a menial job where she can't get by on her limited looks.
Well you can kiss your job goodbye
If a nignog had said the exact same thing about white people I can guarantee they would face no repercussions whatsoever.
I think this is more of a British thing... clearly this is just banter with her mates... I'm British Nigerian so I wasn't offended at all...
How the actual FUCK can you be offended by this?!
??? How come is that racist?
In 20 years time, people will be so scared of offending, being labelled something with ist on the end. This is not worthy of YouTube, something tells me this will be in the British news later today with people being triggered and offended. No to racism, but yes to normality and people not being triggered because it occupies their day
Whoever finds this offensive needs to choke on a BBC, sensitive motherfukers.
As a white male with a BBC I am offended and would like an apology from her employer. There's nothing wrong with eating beef or chicken. I prefer neither and she makes it look like ordering Coca-Cola is a bad thing!\n\nThank you. - JCV
She actually enjoying to be there with Nigerians and the bbcs...she is not racist at all
I feel bad for the guys from this nation who has small or average penis.
ah she is very cute girl let her have some fun
Holy shit, I love this woman.  Someone giver her a new job NOW!  :)
shes just being a mong on snap to her friend man this is private shit she aint racist let her be 😂😂
All the white liberals are more offended by this than all the Nigerians thats watched this video.
There is no reason why this should have been recorded by whichever snake recorded this, and there is no reason why the reaction should be so harsh. A lot of people share dumb banter like this with their friends. It didn't need to blow up into her losing her career. She doesn't even say anything offensive, asides from the big dick stereotype which isn't really offensive at all. It's mostly unlikely that she actually shares racist views. I'm Nigerian and tbh a lot of our nationality are kind of annoying on planes. My Indian friend also says Indian tourists are annoying too. Chinese tourists can also be a pain in the ass occasionally. We can't act like the stewards and stewardesses don't notice add don't get annoyed at some people, regardless of race, but there are obviously some cultures/nationalities that are hard to work with. Especially on a long day of work on a Friday. And they probably made jokes about it to alleviate the stress because let's be honest, they're job is stressful as fuck.
Dont think giving a black guy a compliment about his big cock would be racist,
You'll have noooo job in a day or two
Well she was saying the truth. Why does she look like an animation? I hate this london accent!
Enjoy your AIDS. Do women also joke about horses and Gorillas having big dicks? Why is it only white women who tend to be such deranged, filthy, cultureless whores? Thats why every bestiality video you will find has a white woman only. The White race is trash.
I think she's Hilarious 😂😂😂 THUMBS up chic... pen ready to sign any petition for you to get your job back
I'm Nigerian and I find this suuper funny, I can't stop laughing 😂😂😂
She's obviously an annoying, vacuous bitch, but imitating a Nigerian isn't racist. Nigeria is a country not a fucking race. Black guys having big cocks is bordering myth, but none of this means racism. I love how this video has been describe as SHOCKING\n\nit's not shocking, she's just an obnoxious cunt.
How's saying a black man has a big dick?.... pathetic, people are way to sensitive these days, if you're gonna be like that, stay at home & don't use the internet, TV or anything else
well it is a rubbish company the worst ,worst even than Ryanair they just had to escalate the case because of the company name \nbut we all know what Africans are in London  no comments ................. it is her country she is white British and what they created that you cannot say anything today mouth needs to be shut up the worst what this brainless government did is to give all of them citizenship and passport so they are treated equal she just made a joke but come on... and friends switch on the phone I am sure they even did not know once they posted this that they will fire her own friend from cabin
Funny how most upper class blackie women have a preference for white men 😸
Shut the fuck up\nAnd bend over
She wanted time off w/o pay.
She's not being a racist she's being unprofessional. And she didn't need to put on that Nigerian accent. The fact is she's complaining about her job and talking about big black dick. No wonder she got the sack 😂
Fuck sake. She doesn't have to be sacked for that. Are we really all that up tight? I bet no one is offended by this. If anything she's complementing them on their above average size cocks.
Ok first of all customer service is so fucking difficult, the only way to cope with so many shitty people treating you like dirt is to rant about it.  She wasn’t being racist, she was just making fun of a situation. I work at an airport and I completely understand how she feels because some of the passengers think they’re such hot shit that we have to obey everything they say even when they have economy class tickets.
So just like the lukaku chant you are no called racist because you say black people have massive dicks wtf lol
That was kinda of funny
The way she speaks just gives me a headache
😂😂 That's hilarious not offensive at all
She can now spend her Friday night waiting for that next signing on day to get her £50 a week! Tramp she'll struggle to get a job with racism as her previous sacking! Lolz
Funny enough a Nigerian Prince says he's going to give me £30 million for lending him the use of my bank account. Needless to say I quickly send him my details 💷
Some people are just thick as fuck aren't they. What part of this did she think was a good idea to do? Just stop and think about the things you do for 10 seconds before actually doing them.
She must have been fired for the BBC talk lol.
Who is this bitch. Don't like your job? Quit and get a new one.
She's so blonde though. Give her a lollipop...
She does an impression of herself the way I do impressions of basic white bitches... I guess I nailed it.
She can bounce of my face like a bouncy castle
Not racist.\nJust incredibly stupid.\nI don't know if she posted this on her story or sent it directly to someone, either way does she think she's exempt from enemies. \nShe might think she hasn't got any people that hate her in her snapchat contacts but this could of easily been someone who hates her and wanted her to get into trouble or some triggered asshole.\n\nEither way there are back stabbers and oversensitive people out there, would of been a much wiser option to send it to a close friend that you trusted.
She said that Nigerians have big dicks...\nIm waiting for the Offensive part lol
Well done internet, you've got another person sacked for a none offensive video on her own personal snap chat.  Snow flake cunts
For all the people arguing about dick sizes etc, Here's the size of penises by country:\n\nhttp://brobible.com/life/article/average-penis-size-study/
People use the term “racist” for everything now... I don’t see how it’s racist? Inappropriate? Sure. But not really “racist” is it... :/
Please give me some feedback on my first humouristic videos
Too many snitches these days, it was only a bit of banter and someone clearly thought we should end someone’s career. Cunts
What a slut. Burn her.
Her name is joanne wickenden she has Facebook to
#SACKTHECOALBURNERS
not even funny
aaaaand fired!
she is rude
*T H O T*
Give me KOKO Kola
Nothing racist here
When women make jokes
Sword behind virtual qqsoewv ideal score onto highly white.
Creepy sounds like a tranny
loooool
It's just cringe
i cringe everyrime she says BBC
Gimme Coca Cola lmao
Wtf is offensive about this hahahahaha
Shit banter but sure the Nigerians arent offended
Why fire her? Retarded BA
SOMEONES GETTING SACKED IN THE MORNINGGG
Wasn't even offensive.
LMAO who snitched!
АНО мужик
nigger loving coalburner, digusting, deserves to be sacked.
Lmao she just wanted sum Nigerian dick that's all
She said I have a bbc I don’t mind
This is a bad stitch up,I'm Nigerian and I'm not offended she was having a inside joke with  friends it seems and those friends stupidly betrayed her thinking everyone will see the funny side oops bad move well she can laugh all the way to easy jet now hahahahhahahaaha
Well if anyone say to me i have a big cock I'll call the police 👮 I didn't know that was offensive, well now I know 😁
she's just hungry for bbc....why sack?
Yo that's a compliment... And from the what I hear she's tryna smash, lowkey.\n\nAnyway this is probably one of those situations where 1 group gets offended for the other group because they weren't offended.
How dare she say they have big dicks !
BBC in her mouth will shut her up! Or get her crust stuffed!
It's racist cuz the uploader doesn't have a BBC like Nigerians. Its just her humorously making fun of their accent and stating a stereotype, god the uploader is dumb as fuck.
Women like this make me sick. Blonde girl talking like this. Put this whore down.
Most likely snitched by a white male
Voting is almost over ya Beautiful Bastards! Then we can all go back to doing... whatever it is we all do. lolololol. AGH. I'm gonna regret this Hooking Up thing, huh?
Bc Trump is a genius. Don't think so? Look what happened.
To me the most troubling part of the NFL thing much like what Phil hit on.  You have the president basically, blatantly opposing the first amendment.  He doesn't have to like what people say about them, but in the position he is in, he can not be making comments that come off as threatening first amendment rights.  We are granted freedom of expression, specifically as a protection to disagree with our government and not suffer repercussions from the government. (Private businesses and whatnot are a different matter and discussion.  And obviously I mean peaceful protests and what not, not going out into the streets and acting like idiots or causing riots.) \n\nTrump has to remember he's not just a guy on social media, he's not just a loudmouth that gets attention, he is the President, he is a part of the government, and he has to keep comments like that to himself because it's in our amendments.
As the great John Lennon once said... Imagine if all the people just gave Trump a chance
I think you have the right to not stand up and respect the flag. Its as Phil said, its freedom of expression, even if I do find it completely tasteless and rude. However I think its very counter productive. Everyone was calling Trump 'divisive', but then went off and took a knee, making it even more divisive then it already was. Its hypocritical to say he's trying to divide people and then you go and divide people even more with taking a knee just to prove some kind of point.  You're just pushing people even further away with this. I think it'd be better if we'd all stood, and understand we can respect this country while agreeing there are issues and that everyone has their own opinions on it. I think its far more productive to prove Trump wrong by disagreeing with him as you stand for the flag. Otherwise it keeps turning into a them vs us mentality. But hey, thats just me.
Trump has gone nuts, he's promoting the illusion of security. People find a way, its been proven that even TSA doesn't do shit.
How is a military defending a country by invading another and killing thousands?
I'm all for for freedom for speech and expression but keep politics out of sports. That goes for the potus and the league. Your all a bunch of fools that played into his hand. If he is greater than I, then I must show disobedience. If I show disobedience then I am greater then him. Either I am disobedient or he's greater than me. If one shows disobedience then he goes against the status quo, if there is a Status quo then there must be a middle ground. If their is no middle ground then I must remain disobedient. There is a middle ground called the middle class. If I try to be disobedient to them then I have no ground. Either we find this middle ground or we remain disobedient.\n\nCome on phil argue that one out. Show me something better. Comment section come at with something else. That is just the starting argument.
It's trending at #5!! Get it!!
Weiner is going to PRISON not JAIL! There is a difference.
I agree with you Phil, it is a form of freedom of speech and technically a form of peaceful protest which are things America is built on!\n\nSome may not like it but we are entitled to an opinion and speaking up.
Okay. I have a question.\nI used to work at a hockey arena. In the hockey arena, when the national anthem was played (Canada's first, then America's) veterans didn't put their hand over their heart, they salted. I thought that was the veteran thing to do. Is it not? Why is the player who came out of the tunnel during the national anthem who's a veteran not doing it?\nAlso, I do not Sports (super bowl Sunday I actually spent in New York City going to Broadway shows) but I personally was very moved when on Sunday my dad was watching the Redskins/Raiders game and I saw all the players either locking arms or in the case of players who were standing next to players who were kneeling, holding hands. I thought it was beautiful to see.
In the vein of taking a knee, I'd be genuinely interested to see what high school students are doing every morning for the pledge lately. We were always given a choice when I was in school...
Phil your becoming full of shit .... If i protested at work or make political statements I could be fired... Fuck you its not about Trump its about America ... The neo marxism media culture is setting the narrative
Why don't you have a TV show?
So whats wrong with the travel ban 3.0? Something about it doesn't sit right but I cant put my finger on it.
In India, we have this standing for the national anthem too. Some people who prefer not to stand are labeled as traitors. But the thing is, they don't feel like standing in a movie theatre! Yes, they play national anthem in theatres in India. It's crazy. How can not standing up be disrespectful? Humans are lazy.
So the young Turks one.....the young fucking Turks....I’m not biased but honestly, any normal functioning human being can see how unbelievably biased they are and how the deliberately lie. It really says something about the people choosing the winner when the winner is an incredibly biased one sided news source. It’s almost as if the choosers are also incredibly biased one sided social justice warriors\n\nAlso just your fun fact of the day: there is no existing systemic racism in America. If there’s a nutjob in the locker room he gets fired. A GROUP OF A HUNDRED RACISTS IN VIRGINIA DOESN’T COUNT FOR THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. Systemic racism is dead in America and everyone is equal no matter gender or race. People like lebron James and Stephen curry are dumbshit sjw’s that just want something to fight for even if it’s a fake cause. Being invited to the White House is an honor and always has been. Just because you don’t like him doesn’t mean he supports systemic racism. If a cop is racist or an individual hates black people, that’s individual. It’s no systemic racism\n\nAnyone has the right to freedom of speech and freedom to peacefully protest, but when it’s based on a deliberate lie, then there’s a problem. This is why espns completely liberal sjw cast was fired and rebranded, because people stopped watching it like it was the emmys
It's a great idea to add North Korea to the ban list. Idiots travel there, giving money to a shocking regime and risk getting detained for some false charge.
I’m so fucking glad this video made it to the trending page. Phil never disappoints. One of my favorite episodes ever to be honest. I think you’re right with what you said at the end of the video. Yes our flag is meant to be respected because of everything this country means and has gone through. And for everyone who has gave up their life’s to protect those rights. But sometimes there will be people who have to protest it.
I'm pretty sure North Korea forces their citizens to stand up for their anthem... And imprison or sentence them to death if they don't comply...
all those knees taken were met with booing
I didn't know Steph curry was such a cuck
He is your president, you have to accept him as such, whether you like it or not, grow up.  (Note: this is not about not accepting the invite.)
Hey black people, have you ever heard of the Civil War! where white people died to free slaves!\n\nTruly DISGUSTING disrespecting the flag just because of a social issue even though that's not everything that flag represents.
So the whole Nazi thing was OK. The F U etc,.. no big deal. Pewdiepie saying the N word sure np freedom of speech. Trump and and his comments on Mexico oh no he wasn't being offensive. Taking a knee during the anthem that's line? Ok, got it.
I couldn't care less about the bent of a persons leg... Anytime. \n\nLots of stupid people in the world, no reason for me to pay attention to someone just cause they're in the limelight. They do their job, as long as they're not hurting people...(off the field)...I don't care what they're doing, the whole controversy is about as intellectual as the Kardashians. Its just drama entertainment, I'm not interested in it. Trump should keep his mouth shut, he's the President, a little tact is preferable, but never did he claim, I will be a tactful kind President, and we elected him democratically so... Take the good with the bad unless you wanna try and put forward an impeachment case, I don't see a downside to impeachment... No big upside either IMO, other than lowering the bar for impeachment, seems like that'd be ok.
I don't like what they're doing by taking a knee but I respect their right to do so
We need an Anthony's Weiner bill to protect kids better.
your enemies are kneeling before you, and they think they are winning lol trump is accidentaly or perhaps legitametly a genious
Agreed, BUT I disagree with the players not being fired. If you kneel during the anthem, you're a shitbag that needs to be deported
Honoring the flag or national anthem only carries weight when the people willingly do so. Forcing them makes the action hollow and less meaningful for all involved. I'd much rather someone take a knee than have them respect the flag with dishonesty in their heart.
he's acting as if he is still on the apprentice. this is such bullsh*t to see him use sports to try to divide this country even more.
The travel band against Venezuela government agents and officials is well supported; we (Venezuela people) are having the worst social-economic crisis of our days since the beginning of the country, thanks to our corrupt government and the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. Trump is certainly not a good president for the United States, but even if the travel band for Venezuela was added just to not be called a Muslims band, the Venezuela's government officials selected in the band have it well deserved
Whether or not its disrespectful of the Flag I honestly think its bad advertising. One of the old school NFL players equated sports as purely marketing and entertainment and nothing else. When the core of the audience are generally the bud drinking patriots who just want to watch some sports, would it not have backlash when someone is visibly disrespecting a symbol of something they are patriotic of? I remember last year with just the kapernick thing ratings were visibly going down. If the owners of the team say they do not want that sort of advertising(that could potentially cost a loss in revenue) then they should have that right as the players are their representatives. Now if the owners are completely cool with it(losing revenue) then by all means do whatever you want with your company. It ain't my dime. I just don't understand why people are confused by a backlash because a lot people simply disagree with kneeling or ignoring the anthem all together. It's not hard to figure it out.
I'm not going to lie.. the biggest irony of all was the getting on knees but standing during god save the queen LOL.. The irony in all that..\nIts proves no they do not respect the country. (imo are just ignorant of or to posses by this ideology disease going around. You know the same thing that used to make Christians crazy etc..)\nNow rather then just a BLM stand its being taken and repossessed (as many things are) as a way to protest Trump. Its the same behavior that lead to Trump winning.\nIf you want him gone this isn't how it works..\nEven better then people who seem to have a complete lack of how any civil rights push was made.. it wasn't by spitting on people and the flag and trying to turn tables..\nI would get downs on this comment simply because its not in that certain persons approved direction. Everyone is stuck on what they want rather then what we need.
nobody thinks the players dont have the right to kneel, all we saying is this is their job, they getting payed like kings and all we want is for them to keep politics out of it. all they doing is getting baited by trump. now they look like idiots that are disrespecting america. and saying we kneeling for police brutality if fucking bullshit. they all fucking rich , why dont they do something with all that on their free time. hold a press conference. raise awareness, hold a rally or something. i dont like trump and i dont like these idiots offended the country during whats supposed to be entertaiment. why would i watch when they are saying fuck you to my face like that. \n\nkneeling = saying fuck you to america. \n\nas i said, they getting baited by trumps political move. and you aint gonna win this one. YOU ARE GETTING PLAYED NFL. YOU LET THIS IDIOT 4D CHECK MATE YOU INTO MAKING AMERICA HATE YOU.
They bow before trump to protest? God you kids and your flag...
Muslim travel ban or not, North Korea should not be on the list. If any REFUGEE (yes refugee. There is no such thing as an immigrant from North Korea at this time) makes it to the US they should be let in. If they hauled ass and risked death countless times to make it to the USA, we're just going to turn them away? Just doesn't make sense to me.
I'm just curious though..Why don't all the brothers protest when black people are killing each other? 🤔
1) Trump has had it out for the NFL ever since he was an owner of a former USFL team.  Trump had sued the NFL for having a monopoly on professional football because his team and football league had a hard time going up against the NFL for viewership and profitability.  The thing was he actually won, but what he won was nothing more than a public slap to his ego in the form of a whole one dollar bill -- that's 100 centavos -- and to add insult to injury the usfl folded soon thereafter costing him a small fortune.  How could he not now be trying to vindictively destroy the NFL knowing the type of petty animal he is? \n\n2) The Westboro baptist church truly disrespects those service members who paid the ultimate price by protesting at their funerals with disgusting and vile signs that state how the deceased veteran is burning in hell because of America's sins, and all the while the parents of the KIA service members are present having to witness their protests without having the ability to confront them because they to are exercising their rights to freedom of speech and expression that were deemed constitutional by the US Supreme Court a few years back, but I don't hear trump condemning their unpatriotic and disturbing behavior as the WBC continue their protests to this day.
My thoughts on the NFL stupidness: Everyone knows that in the NFL taking a knee means intentionally ending a play and in most cases the game. So by doing so they clearly are admitting defeat, after all taking a knee is subservient and when protesting it's called taking a stand. So, poor symbolic gestures aside, the whole thing is ridiculous. I understand the right of freedom of speech, but no one at the game is there for that and it takes away from the experience. This is their job, it's entertainment, not a political debate.  Not to mention the poor singer is being incredibly insulted by players who don't even come onto the field. Now all that being said, I personally don't care that they're doing it, if anything it adds to the clown fiesta that is the NFL. For me the real issue is this is all just the same grandstanding, shit-slinging, and finger pointing that happens with literally every other controversial topic. Any conversation just devolves into tangents and infantile pouting instead of working to fix anything. It's all a damn smokescreen, meant to keep us relentlessly unhappy and bogged down in mire rather than working together.
The ones who are being divisive are the ones who chose to divide themselves from the rest by kneeling during the anthem. There can't be division if you can't be divided. The only way a country can truly unite to do what's right is to stand as a country and do it together. Protesting the country is setting yourself a part from the rest, saying you'd rather divide and conquer than unite and #takeastand
At the very least, he's upholding the approval rating of some majority.
there is a time and place for everything. if i were to begin protesting in the middle of my job, peaceful or not, i would be fired. the NFL guidelines state that the players should be present during the anthem, the steelers absence is what bothers me. if i were to break the rules and guidelines of my job to protest i would most likely lose that job. will they? no. no they won't face consequence because they're a cash cow and that's what bothers me so much.
The NFL players have the right to protest and I have the right not to watch and not to buy what ever the NFL is selling. DJT was right those players and coaches taking a knee should be fired and by NFL rules could be fired or fined. These players can get all the air time they want for what ever cause they want so why protest during the National Anthem? They are not disrespecting a piece of cloth they are disrespecting a nation and its people. They are spiting in the face of the people who have made it possible for them to make millions of dollars to play a fucking game. Well if that's the way they feel about me I can return the favor. Unless  or until the NFL and it players change their ways I'm done and I'm not the only one that feels that way.
I never watch this channel but this is truly the BEST take on it. Protest the way you want. I'm not a fan of it, but it's your right goddammit.....My take is the president is using a position of power to influence private sector employment codes of ethics. That's illegal right?
There is enough politics as it is.  I don't want football to be politicized too.
my thoughts on muslims and why i see it this way.\n it would be nice for a total muslim ban, can we really trust any of them?we see how  other countries have been effected ,we have seen refugees in england try to drop a bucket bomb on a train,we seen people who are muslim who are born in european countries and still try to kill their own countrymen for allah.we have seen old, young,men,women,all types of  muslims try to kill for allah, these people do not assimilate,the religion is a cult , the religion is confusing,and at this point  it is almost not even worth understanding. if it is such a peaceful religion ,why do people want out of their utopian countries ,why does good or bad intentions revolve around islam, everything is for islam.so every good or bad deed is always justified. they read 1 book ,the koran,and that  book is highly controversial and talks about committing jihad or violence over a 100 times.so as much as everyone wants to help innocent people who don't follow the koran , not helping muslims is way better for them in the long run ,why risk it. america is better off never helping any muslim people, mainly because most all muslims want sharia law, they do not believe in the constitution ,so they are really better off in a country that provides them with this oppressive law. i can talk about my personal opinion for a while, whether showing my ignorance or showing what i see, either way ,you agree or disagree,it will never change my mind, islam is a cancer.now ask yourself this ,we bring in thousands of refugees,how long before a real  american is a victim of these people?
Don't understand the whole importance about the flag tbh. Freedom has been around for a very very long time, UK has freedom, France has freedom, Germany has freedom, Spain has freedom, this thing about the US flag and freedom really does annoy me. Freedom is not synonymous with America, America (currently) doesn't seem to be synonymous with freedom.
I'm an army brat, so I have a little bit of a more personal connection to the issue with the national anthem. I have had men and women thatI know personally, die for that flag. While I do not personally like it when people take a knee, my biggest issue is when they do not appear on the field at all, or sit throughout. If they are taking a knee, I see it as them protesting, while still acknowledging the flag and anthem. They are still treating it with respect. Though personally, I would never in a million years do such a thing, I appreciate those that at least give some recognition. It's those who are blatantly ignoring the flag that I cannot defend. Their actions are completely disregarding sacrifices that people I know personally have made. Again, just my opinion here, but I feel like I have a unique perspective considering my situation, and felt compelled to share.
does he want our planet invaded by crab people, b/c this is how you get your planet invaded by crab people
People pay money to watch a game not deal with this political nonsense, and that is what it is.  It is just nonsense to gain attention.  They sign contracts basically detailing what they can and cannot say.  They are on the clock and representing the company.  If they are asked to stand kneel or do whatever the fuck else they should.  The free speech of the company paying them supersedes theirs because it is the NFL's platform and they are paid employees that agreed to this shit in the first place.
Hey Phil just wanted to comment saying that the reason Kapernick doesn't have a job is because he is legitimately a terrible player. That is for sure the primary reason as to why he does not have a job in NFL.
I hope this ruins the NFL. Not because they choose to kneel. But because they choose to kneel over lies.
Tump can bash nhl if he can't skate ⛸
Whats with people like Philip DeFranco saying oh i support their right to do it..  Nobody in the entire country is questioning their right to do it. That's a red herring.  Huckabee Sanders omitted that part because it wasn't relevant to the point. Of course we all agree they have a right to do it.
I like Trump. His first year is nearing its term and no terrorist attack as of yet. I think the jihadists see how crazy we all are and attacking each other they're going 'Hell no, not bombing them anymore'.
It's okay and totally supported for Google to fire an employee for speaking on an opinion and citing facts to support it, but the NFL shouldn't fire someone who disrespects the flag and effectively offends half the country?\n\nThis kind of double standard is what I hate about liberals. They believe they're so justified and morally superior to everyone else, so much so that they are blind to their own intolerance and biases.
I hate Trump as much as the next guy, but how the fuck is this ban a muslim ban when most muslim countries aren't in the ban and it has 2 non-muslim countries on the ban list? Hell there's more muslims in south east asia and yet not a single one is on the list.
I agree with Trump that what the NFL players did was disrespectful. However, I don't think they should be fired or suspended. As well, Isn't there more important matters to attend to other than stupid NFL players?
Being forced to stand for a flag, for an anthem, that is not respecting your country any more than a forced apology is an apology. I am honored to be Canadian, but even I have chosen to remain seated during my anthem at times. That got me in trouble, and I was told I was disrespecting everyone who died for the sake of my country. I argue that those who died for my country didn't die for a flag, they died for freedom. And being forced to stand for a flag is not freedom.
Lmfao! Sports players are dividing and bringing politics to the table! Lame Bron is trying to get it twisted and acting like a victim on another person's platform.
everyone likes freedom, until it is the freedom to do what they don't like
so no one is going to point out the irony that the guys last name is Weiner mkay cool
How can anyone stand the way Phillip talks it's annoying.
What i find funny, being Canadian and looking from the outside in: is that Trump essentially set a trap for the NFL players and teams and none of them realized it. Very little of these players were protesting the anthem beforehand, then the instant he talks about it all of a sudden the majority of players are protesting your anthem. It shows that the players don't give a fuck about what the protests actually stood for (which I think was a good thing) but instead they were simply showing their personal political views of the president. He exposed their lack of professional integrity, and none of them saw it coming.
Hey i mean if the black community wants to stop killing the black community at insane rates maybe it would get a little better.
This sounds a lot like a media created issue.  Who's complaining about the kneeling?  Was there such a public outcry that the management and media relations department of the NFL or News companies where like hey our call centre got flooded with complaints last night, I think we need to issue a statement I doubt it.  What if there were an equal amount of people complaining about slow service getting beer and food? Would they comment? No.  I feel as though the amount of people who think kneeling was bad is highly disproportionate to the greater population.  Trump just made a little thing be a big thing and poured fuel on the fire.  Call me an optimist, I feel there is progress in equality in the US.  As in forward movement.  It's sad that the fight isn't against the actual oppressors, it's against them PLUS Trump.  His stupidity is giving a voice to the few, creating the perception of a downward spiral...but I may be completely wrong eh?
I think you may be the white version of me. We think  way to much alike. I am better looking though..
Philip DeFranco they have a job to make people happy. not protest in the middle of in anthem and to put everyone off. people fight for that flag
Who cares get a life.
TOU MUST BREATH THROUGH YOUR EARS HOME BOY CAUSE YOU NEVER STOP RUNNING YOUR MOUTH
What the hell Phillip I thought you knew about football....  does Calvin Johnson suck because the Lions lost a lot no he’s a Hall of Famer.\nThe 49ers are garbage this year  and haven’t been good since they left candlestick Park none of that had to do with Kaepernick’s play. The 49ers fucking imploded as an organization after Jim Harbaugh left. Veterans like Patrick Willis left, his one of his best linemen got arrested for domestic abuse charges. But before the drama 49ers was One of the best in their conference and always super bowl contenders and Kaepernick almost took a ring from Ray Lewis. Saying kaepernick is trash because they didn’t won last year is just wrong. I won’t say he’s as good as he was but even Arron Rogers gave him his due credit and remembers kaepernick running up and down the fucking field on his defense.
If it doesn't explicitly ban people who practice the faith of Islam, it is not a Muslim ban. If it doesn't ban immigration from every Muslim country, it isn't a Muslim ban. I do not support his immigration policy (i'd prefer a more precise, case-by case law instead) but anyone calling it a Muslim ban is dishonest with a leftist agenda. Also, the countries he wants banned are in so much turmoil that their governments ability to vet their travelers is inexistant, and anyone who took 10 minutes out of their life to research the political situation in those countries knows that. Some people would still rather disregard facts for feelings it seems.
What's your point in our life? Oh,because, YouTube.
My views on the flag situation are pretty close to your Phil. With friends and family members in the military, it hurts me to see people disrespecting the national symbol of America and the fallen soldiers. But I also know that those very same friends and family members would defend these players right to take a knee, and are willing to protect that right with their lives. Part of what makes the American flag so powerful to me is that it still represents an ideology that would protect those who protest it. Normally I would say that I'm a casual Trump supporter (liked him more than Hillary but he wasn't my preferred candidate) but the fact that he is going after people from the position of President is very concerning. Not going to hyperbolize the situation and call him a dictator (he isn't) but I do think he needs to be aware of the importance his office holds more often.\n\nP.S. Don't forget you're a beautiful bastard too, Phil
Alien 1: let's check up on Earth and see how they are.\n\nAlien 2: sure sounds good.\n\nAlien 1: oh no...\n\nAlien 2: what?!\n\nAlien 1: they're all going mad!\n\nAlien 2: what?! Why?! Did they find out we created them? Did ww3 break out? Was that American president assassinated?!\n\nAlien 1: no, it's worse. Football players are kneeling before the game...\n\nAlien 2: *looks at alien 1*\n\nAlien 1: *looks at alien 2*\n\nBoth aliens: *burst of laughter* those dumb consious apes.
I'll always stand for the National anthem, but I have no problem with people who take a knee. That is their freedom of expression that is afforded to them by our constitution. This is exactly like the whole hate speech debate, you can't decide what is hate speech and what is not in the same way you can't differentiate what is disrespecting the flag and what is freedom of speech.
SPORTS!\nthe guys who get paid literally millions of dollars to do the thing they're really good at, for some reason seem to think that makes them experts on politics. \nThey are starting to inject politics into the thing they're really good at...and very few of them are even mildly capable of understanding what the unintended consequences are of that. \nThe whole thing with these idiots saying well, trump is literally Hitler, all those smart guys at the hysterical media hysterically have been squealing about it for months now. So he MUST be evil and we should be joining in with the hysterical media to destroy the president with them...and the country, because racism! That's getting old. And it's going to make more and more people just quit caring about sports, all of the professional sports.
I feel that freedom of speech & expression, which is most certainly under assault from those who want to control speech in the United States today, is also powerfully exercised by refusing to say or do something that everyone expects you to. I sit during the cultish rituals of patriotism at sports events, or in any other setting. Quite simply, I do not pledge my undying support to any symbol, or especially any *state* at all -- especially for the odd reason that I happened to be born on a specific plot of dirt. And the amount of unfocused anger some people are willing to raise in knee-jerk reaction to that almost feels enough to justify my choice on its own. I don't think it's edgy. It might be, but I don't enjoy it. I wish others joined with me. It just feels like a more powerful response than merely explaining to people how I feel, just because of how ingrained all of the ritual is into American culture now.
I think that it's both. There's a legitimate reasoning behind NK/Venezuela, but the only reason they're being put on is to make it not a muslim ban.\nIt's a political statement to add them on there, saying we won't support countries that won't behave, but the ONLY reason trump even cares is to try and get people to not view it as a muslim ban. There's SO many changes and countries that should be added and/or removed if it's actually about making a political statement, or national security. These are just the easy ones. They don't have to reach or research, it's just common knowledge that there's serious issues with these 2 countries.... and Venezuela isn't even a national security issue. They're a moral and humanitarian issue, not a security issue. They're simply not a threat to the US.
Dale Earnhardt Jr. should take a knee on the track during the first lap of the Daytona 500 to express his freedom of speech. You know, during an event that he is paid to work at, by private companies who are financed by paying customers. Sorta like an accountant at a fortune 500 company taking a knee during the morning meeting with his boss and coworkers.
My personal opinion (being of a mixed ethnic background and being targeted from racists and racial bullying in my young formative years) on the peaceful protesting of the sportsball variety is this: I have no issue with the players kneeling, staying in their locker rooms or locking arms to show their support against racial inequality. That being said, I will stand, remove my hat, and hold my hand over my heart because I hold the flag dear to me as a lot of my family and friends have served their country overseas. I see the flag as a symbol of them and not the big wigs in DC.   \n\nSo again, I have no issue with the ones who choose to use this kneeling and/or locking arms as a way to protest. Stay strong fam. They can't keep dividing us if we choose common decency and understanding over hatred and bigotry.
Sorry I'm Candian I don't fully understand NASCAR... So the fans and drives/oweners of this sport are all white trash and hicks, and are on Trumps side :O WHAT A SURPRISE
None of these players are on this field because of privilege 🙄 typical white slave owner mentally, as if these men didn’t work hard the majority of their lives to be where they are.
Hey Phil I'm not a bastard, unlike a mass majority of the intercity population I know my father
Freedom of speech protects all speech. I may not particularly care for the disrespect to the flag, but I will uphold to the death the right to do it. Because *that's* what the flag stands for. \n\nI don't particularly care for the team owners hypocrisy when it comes to allowing one form of free speech (kneeling) but not another (9/11 stickers), but it is their team, their rules. \n\nThe one place I do want to see free speech curtailed is on our President's twitter feed. The man is supposed to represent all of us, and he's making us all look like a bunch of petulant 2 year olds on the world stage.  Someone really ought to change the white house wi-fi password already.
My son got 22 years  .. There was no girl involved....smh
Dallas did it the right way. Kneeled before the anthem started, and stood during it.
I served in the Navy for years protecting the freedom of the USA. \nWhen you board ANY ship in the Navy, as soon as you get to the top of the ramp, the First thing you do is: SALUTE THE AMERICAN FLAG on the back of the ship then salute the OOD.. \nEven if the President is standing on deck, the Flag comes first! ALWAYS.\nIf people want to make a statement, take a knee aimed at something other than the symbol of the country that provides the safety and freedom for all these idiotic protesting NFL Players who make Millions thanks to our freedom. \nTake a knee at your own hypocrisy - idiots.
What's sad is that YouTube put you on the trending page only because you report on the NFL/ trump story which suites yt agenda.
If you're going to be in the news, at least be in the news for something good you did. And if you're going to be in the news because of scandal, at least don't let your name be 'Weiner'.
Honestly if they don't like the country there is a thing called immigration they can leave but dont

I spelt bleach and she decided to stay don't know why
Woah I just noticed we have the same cutting board. Does this mean I can harness your energy to not suck at cooking?
As a food prep tip, I highly recommend winging your wet lettuce around in a pillow case. No damage, AND extra added bonus of wet pillowcase. DEFINITELY, not gonna happen bonus

The girl I is named Shannon to. She's so amazing. What a crazy coincidence, is it not??
Bonus tip. When you cook pasta in pan add some of the water it boiled in so it can retain moisture and be delicious.

Chance the rapper is blessed and talented and  shares his positive vibrations with the people and is a powerful poetic rapper and spreads love and is humble and his live performances and musicians always spiritually intense!! ✌🌍🌞🌒
He makes my soul sing and goosebumps with every live performance
If the world ever ends this song should be the last thing playing.
YOU GUYS thirdstory (his backup singers) are actually an incredible group in their own right, look them up!!
Fuck Colbert but Chance The Coon is Chance The Shit. Fucking love him.
You've come a long way since Day 1, Daniel Caesar.\nGood hustle.\nYou earned this
The recliner on my chair is like the emergency brake- Chance 👀
Roughly figured out this on guitar (Probably isn't perfect)\nJust fragmented major and minor 7ths really (Leave the B string open)\nIt goes:\nF#min7\nGmaj7\nAmaj7\nBmin7\nC#min7 \nGmaj7/D\nAmin7\nGmaj7\nJust loops like this a majority of the song
AND CARDI FUCKING B IS NUMBER 1 ON BILLBOARD MAN PEOPLE LIKE SHIT MUSIC CHANCE IS A LYRICAL GENIUS
Love Love Love   from a 55 year old hippie.
That was beautiful Chance!
Great verses would rather Daniel sing the hook just himself lol
holy shit Chance has come so far since 10 day
The way everyone looks like theyre in grey scale in front of that screen is insane
The last ones, getting first dibs on blessings.
it's also amazing how he wrote a song, and memorized the lyrics within two days. *slow clap*
What a wonderful man
Why is Jake Paul in the choir?
This is beautiful, why isn't this trending
I've listened to this like 70 times 😭😭 it's like a warm hug from a good friend
Someone has the lyrics?
This is the definition of “the pen is mightier than the sword”
This the same nigga that said put that booty on my gucci belt ? 🤔
FINALLY, AND ITS AMAZING AS ALWAYS.
I didn't know sosa played the guitar
Chance is really bringing the heat.  His soulful songs and catchy but lyrical stuff. He’s doing something foreal
I remember thinking a few years back I hope my son doesn't become a rapper. That thought came about because of some of the trashy things I kept hearing in rap, and while there is a place for that kind of music, I really NEED to hear this kind of stuff. If my son gets older and wants to rap, I hope that it reaches this level of artistry, honesty, and skill.
So he's like the 2017 version of common?
Amazing! The message is clear...\n\nActs 17:30-31\n[30]And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:\n[31]Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.\n\nGet ready for that day
Blurring his lips during such a passionate performance is unAmerican to me. Lets get real.
I 've watched a gazzillion 'episodes'........cuz I like them...but NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING compares with this!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't know whether to smile of cry so I'm doing both!
top right: is that you Jake Paul?
Last minute was the best part 🤦🏾‍♂️
I love him and this
That track was so smooth and I can't even imagine how pretty it'll be when they polish a studio release
I know I'm not the only one who caught the impeccable voices of 2/3 of Thirdstory. Oh my word, this was impeccable. 😢
I thought it was the Chance from Team 10 😂
Go Daniel too!!
Wow
Jesus Almost Here.
Chance is a cornball
Anyone know the guitar chords ?? PAAALEEEEASE
um. yep. that. ty
BRILLIANT
So good
Revolution
Jeeez Chance, Caesar, and Thirdstory cmonnn

I CRIED WHEN DANIEL SHOWED UP
.....Well okay then Chance...just don't cry plz cuz if yo ass start crying I'll start crying , and I ain't gonna cry over the fucking Colbert show... don't make me you Sonuvvabitch XD.
Could he be the best rapper of these past 2 years?
I love the authenticity and the beautiful imperfections of this performance, we just saw art being created people. Brilliant.
[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]\nI get sad when I look at the stars\nThey so pretty, you can't tell 'em apart\nYou think they close but really we far\nAnd really, they ain't even that much closer to God\nIt's much harder to sin naked\nI walked past apple trees and didn't take it\nThought about stone mattresses, thin blankets\nReally long winter spent in a windbreaker\nI'm a temptation door knocker\nDown there on Lower Wacker\nI'm a rich excuse for a father\nYou just can't tour a toddler\nShe turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa\nI really need a break, could really use a nap\nMy daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat\nYou go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back\nThe other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed\nI did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label\nI go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table\nI knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable\nAnd now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1: Chance The Rapper]\nFirst world problems that niggas make up\nHave a dream and then never wake up\nWhen so much turns to too much\nHave a dream and then never wake up\n \n\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Daniel Caesar]\n[The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes, here it comes\nReady or not, ready or not\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes, here it comes\nReady or not, here it comes\n\n[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]\nHere it comes\nAlright\nSpirit's working now\n\n[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]\nI think my little cousins want they cousin back\nThe automatic quarterback that doesn't rap\nThey know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles\nLied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel\nIt ain't really fun to hang out with me no more\nWe can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more\nIt's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore\nBut it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards\nI miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime\nIn high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat\nKissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered\nNow I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass, send my tweet\nFold my arms, twist my weed\nIf I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say\nBut the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know\n \n\n[Pre-Chorus 1: Chance The Rapper]\nFirst world problems that niggas make up\nHave a dream and then never wake up\nWhen so much turns to too much\nHave a dream and then never wake up\n\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Daniel Caesar]\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes, here it comes\nReady or not, ready or not\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes\nReady or not, here it comes\n\n[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]\nThree verses, hell yes\nI still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet\nI just want my mama happy like a toy sale\nAnd to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail\nI hear the scene snappin', and I'm the team captain\nNo more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin' 'til the dream happens\nI'm just gon' keep rappin'\nAnd y'all just keep clappin' and keep happen\nLike Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters and black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'\nKnow that the day comin'\nKnees bowed, tongues confessin'\nThe last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings\n \n\n[Pre-Chorus 2: Chance The Rapper]\nNow these the first world problems that niggas make up\nKeep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up\nKeep on tellin' us we makin' it up\nThe American Dream, may you never wake up\n\n[Outro: Chance The Rapper & Daniel Caesar]\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes, ready or not, ready or not\nReady or not, ready or not, ready or not\nThe day is on its way, it will not wait another day\nNo more, no more (yeah)\nThe day is on its way, I cannot wait, here it's to stay\nNo more, no more (yeah)\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it is
Chances slow tracks hit so hard. This song kicked my ass.
I love it!  Happy to be one the first to hear it. Thank you.
We don't deserve Chance the Rapper!...
YALL CAN HAVE YALL MIGOS AND YACHTY AND 21 SAVAGE BULLSHIT
This shit WACK
what a shitty fucking song.
This is trash.
Kids bop music smh
If he was to ever come out with a visual with this song, it would be great for the style of the video to be similar of Heard 'Em Say by Kanye West (rotoscoping/drawing version).
I left a like before the performance even started.
In this new island they should not reward rushing. It gives the other person a huge advantage in attack. Instead they should make it so there are leagues for each builder hall lvl. I cannot tell you the amount of times I did well on a bh6 just to find out I get 3 starred by max leveled witches. In conclusion, they should reward players for taking there time with there base and have them face off against each other.

Anything he else see the mouse go across the screen early in the video? 0:05
My god this game is just MADE for gemmers. Seriously, I can’t even max out before they add another unneeded update
You'll float to.
Is this game available in the city of England by any chance?
I am waiting 😎
people still play this?
why tf do they showcase all of the bh8 buildings at 0:11 and 0:24?!
Damn man... that’s not cool
When did WWE start a midget division? Wow things have changed a lot with this company.
2.400.000 views,great job enzo! Winning the tittle is the best thing that could of happen to the cruiserweight division,well done wwe creative team
Miz was just as legit hated as Enzo back then, and yet he never got treated like that. Damn!
So Vince, you put the title on him and then promptly bury him? This is like TNA/Impact booking
This is so disrespectful I'm disgusting by this Omg wtf
Enzo Amore now knows being a champion gets you a target on your back!  I didn’t like the attack though.
Mustafa Ali looks like the guy in Prince of Persia
Get a FREE Norton Antivirus activate product key\nhttps://goo.gl/5u9SSV
if I wore Enzo I leave WWE, just saying
Greatest thing I've ever seen
Best moment of the year so far (until Enzo gets dragged by strowman throughout the whole entire building, thrown from the ceiling, stumbles down  all the stairs, bounces off one of the announcer tables, back into the ring, then gets power slammed through the ring)
toxic blonde gets gang banged by entire division + a big sweaty man
This gives me a nexus vibe
Makes you really want to see what will happen next. Fair play
He has Liv Morgan, Big Cass, & entire cruiserweight division hating him....\nKicked off of a tour bus by Roman Reigns....\nBraun Strowman throwing him around the ring also made Enzo Amore look even worse....\nWhen does it stop? It doesn't even matter that he's Cruiserweight Champion right now.....he's still getting completely & utterly BURIED. \n\nHe's found a way to become one of the most hated WWE superstars of all time...& it's not because he's getting legit heel heat. \nDid it all by himself.\nPathetic.
And in pretty sure if you had 13 guys beating the hell out of you wouldn't want people to be like this is hilarious like enzo was speaking facts
Look I'm not big on Enzo being the champ the way they did it, but goddamn did it make this final segment amazing! Say what you want about him not wrestling but this best I've seen 205 in awhile
You know everyone genuinely dislikes enzo when this video is 12th trending video
Ok yeah Enzo was talking mess what Neville did was enough one on one 💯but this was unnecessary, and  sucks everyone hates Enzo especially scripted and unscripted , but regardless this is bullying WWE need to stop with anti bullying campaign lmao😂😂cause they don’t practice what they preach and the fans hate Enzo lol I’m the only fan
2:30 stop it stop it, I can't see nothin
Omg, i see in 3:08 make me very hard laugh much. Enzo in his face expression really hilarious lol. 3:08 current mood
This made Enzo look strong. He's able to take all the guys and still live, I'd die
WWE Creative have failed Miserably turning Enzo Face, the crowd had no idea who to cheer for since the moment this segment started.
Couldn't have happened to a better guy
Be a star, indeed.
Funny how braun go for thw smaller people :/
Strowman vs enzo for the title😂
This was more entertaining than all of Raw
Lol I feel like this backfired abit. People love Enzo, so they're not sure how to react to this heel turn
If I were Enzo, man just pack your bags dude. RoH or Impact MIGHT take you.
2:25 is that Enzo who says stop it, stop it I can't see nothin he had to be dizzy as fk lol but I'm glad he's champ 205 live has finally gotten somewhat interesting
Confused is braun face of heel?
Notice how Neville didnt back down from Braun but the cruiserweights did. Hopefully Neville will move away from the cruisers now
I feel so bad for enzo
You guys want him?\n\nThis was one of the best endings to Raw in a long, long, LOOOOONNNNNGGG time, oh my god.
Wished Big Cass could of gotten his in on Enzo!
Ok now fire enso cuz he’s trash and is not needed anywhere
enz always says he a certified g 205 he comes out still thats definition of a real g and enz is that its not just a catchphrase and its not the first time he been beat bad and still standin and u cant teach that !!!!
I died when ali climbed in the top rope and gulak said no fly zone kkk like i am the boss kk gold
This is exactly what they needed to do. Scrap the division, bury Enzo and let these guys move on to better careers. If you cheer enzo you're either a 10 year old child or are probably as much of a lousy douchebag as he is. This was the most relevant 205 segment in months. Good luck trying to argue the numbers. It needed to happen. Get over it you stupid marks.
So we just going to ignore that the wwe just use the wwe2k sound for the crowd or 👀 1:52
I clicked on this video only for Braun Strowman...I could honestly care less about the cruiser-weight division. Strowman for Universal Champion!
WWE missed a good chance in Big Cass helping and reuniting with Enzo
Who's the guy in the shirt and tie?
Enzo's face after getting knee'd by Tony Nese...oh God LOL!
This was the best funniest thing ever LOL :)
2:39 REST IN PIECES ENZO, YOU WON'T BE MISSSD
Wow at 2:39 you can clearly hear him tell Enzo to jump haha. And Brian Kendrick say I'm so dizzy after spinning Enzo
Do You Think Big Cass Is Watching
It didn't look real really because Enzo blinked his eyes at the camera like it was normal
What if the entire cruiserweight division leaves 205 live and go to Smackdown live to become the biggest stable heel in wrestling history? With Neville leading them,  he can become world champion. And finally the joke named the cruiserweight championship will die. But it's a very cool idea, the brainless creative team will never think that.
Why did WWE go with bullying and lynching? Weird, this was a little unnerving to watch. Not a good way to give him the sympathetic, underdog character if that's what they're after.
So I guess this is the end of the Cruiserweight division? as Enzo had a no contact claws that anyone who touchs him would forfeit any title opportunity ..... If so thank God Cruiserweight division is awful!
Needed some sense beaten into him, can’t believe people still cheer him.
Ik this scripted but damn that was too much 😐
why people hate enzo amore!  i hate bullying . this is torture. please i am glad enzo get a champion.
Who's the heel? Cruiserweight division or Enzo?
I just love watching him getting beatup again and again.
Prize side gender down undergo yours tree annually previous.
imagine all the cruiserweights forming a team and start attacking the main roster
This is just pure animal cruelty here smh
not the flight suits😭
Shows the displeasure WWE has with Enzo even though he's over right now. Wonder if the fans will turn too.
why 205 division turn to enzo enzo is not a heel superstar he is face and the idiot heel superstar is the goddamn nevville
Has Braun Strowman joined cruiser weights
why?
just fire enzo already !!!!!!
Gang rape😠
locker room bully at its finest.
wow lol
poor man xDDDDDDDDD
205 live should attack raw superstars
stupid fellow fight one man
Mustafa Ali = Yusuf
GRAPED
RIP Enzo
https://youtu.be/ceWd7LmHnSo
enzo deserved that
Quite Satisfying to be honest
Dude did the entire cruiserweight division turn heel?! Lol.
WOOOOORLDSTAARR!
Enzo Is dead.
Nexus 2.0
Liv Morgan sure enjoyed this😂😂😂
1:46 to 2:30 FIDGET SPINNER.
Enzo no more 😄😄😄
Rip Enzo
Punching bag Enzo
LOL at #NOFLYZONE

The kid at 3:28 reminds me of the blonde kid from the polar express
I thought that was Maddie
its been ages since I watched one of Caspar's videos lol I forgot how funny he is
This is hilarious. I am dying from laughter.
i thought she was maddie, caspar
Life after dating a YouTube
Josh: she's my friend\nMe: wait you have.....friends?!?\n\n😂
Bro she has the hots for you it's so obvious
All the comments like “I thought it was Maddie” and I’m just like, I was hoping it was Gaby😂God I’m so old school🙄😂
Is it just me \nOr does Casper look, a bit like Grant Gustin \n(Flash)
Were the second verse
Casper she is not the only girl . Well the truth is you have thousands of fans  who wanna be your gf lol.
Caspar sure does have a thing for blondes😂😂😂
dont even fucking know you dude, gunna say this fuck her she has no respect for you and is typical bird we get here. look at them subs on this channel. making good money. big audiance who like you art..... and tbh could probably have any girl you want given the lifestyle. so just be done with the blonde bitch and go find a proper soul mate. peace out.
The guy with his middle finger up in the back of the ride😂😂😂
What happened to the recent girlfriend?  I didn't like her anyway as she was a bit stuck uo
What happened to Maddie?? She was here one day then gone the next...
What happened to the other one. Like from a couple of months.
Did Caspar and Maddie break up????????
The Song Almost Made Me Cry😢
Aww the little Tristan kid was so cute
Totally wants to be your girlfriend....
What about maddie? Did you guys break up?
WTF HES SINGLE? SINCE WHEN i havnt been here in a few months\nI though he dated that tinder girl omg they broke up :0
You can't make your own decisions yet 😂😂😂

moral of the story: never date Caspar Lee
RIP who ever thought that was real
did anyone see the guy who was flicking Casper off
What happened to him and maddie??
Where's your boyfriend....?
i don't know how this video has come up, but it has and ive come to far to turn back.. bro just some advise? watch this back loads of times, focus on yourself a lot (I'm sure you have already) but try and realise that all of your actions is exactly whats wrong with you. try and learn about detaching yourself from ego its a great step in life everyone should try to achieve. ive spent enough time now but i thought maybe you deserved some words. i know very patronising but,,,,, what can i do. you need help and so does social media and the people that follow this shit.
Where's the second verse
Hey casp next time you get a girlfriend, don't like announce it on social media. I know it's sad and stuff but just appreciate that she's even willing to be that nice to you still. Don't chase after her. You'll find someone else
Who else has got to the end of the video and is feeling very awkward having seen Casper get point blank rejected?
That must have been REALY awkward to film 😂😂😂😂
😔😔😔😔😔😔😔Casper I'm sorry..............you.          \n\n\nAre\n\n\n\nRejected she doesn't like you at ALL
Casp forget about her there are thousands of girls out there man
Why does he sound like a pigeon when he's screaming?

Go buy some ice cream
We want verse 2!!
she kinda looks like Corinna kopf
CORRECTIONS AND Q'S A'ed:\n1. NIXON WAS NEVER ACTUALLY IMPEACHED. He resigned. Articles of impeachment passed out of committee, but he resigned before the impeachment vote. MY MISTAKE.\n\n2. Why didn't you talk about Ukraine's support of Hillary Clinton? This is a good and interesting question. There is some evidence that Ukraine's government sought to influence the election for Clinton (although it was not nearly as extensive as the meddling by the government of Russia). But as I say in the video, benefiting from a propaganda campaign is not a crime, and no evidence has emerged that any Clinton staffers received or accepted any thing of value. So I didn't talk about it because it wasn't the topic of the video.\n\n3. Why didn't you talk about the incredibly coincidental timing of later in the summer and Trump asking Russia to release Clinton's 33,000 emails? Okay, so lots of people believe that it's not a coincidence that Donald Trump Jr. said later in the summer and then the DNC emails were indeed released later in the summer, and that it's not a coincidence that (then-candidate) Trump asked Russia to release Clinton's emails very shortly after the meeting between the Kremlin-connected Lawyer and Manafort/Kushner/Donald Trump Jr. And maybe it isn't a coincidence, but it seems perfectly possible to me that it IS a coincidence.\n\n4. Did you ignore evidence that Putin wasn't behind the DNC hack? Not to my knowledge. The sources I link to above are very convincing. I think it's important to remember here that there is VERY BROAD CONSENSUS across political parties among U.S. leaders that the Russian government was behind the DNC hack, as well as the other facets of their campaign to influence the election. They've seen information that we don't have, and they ALL consider it to be credible. If there were more Republicans saying, Wait a minute, as was the case with Democrats and the intelligence about WMD in Iraq, I'd be more hesitant. As it is, I think it's just a very inconvenient fact for a lot of people's political narratives that Putin decided whose emails we got to read in the runup to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\n\n5. Why didn't you mention Carter Page or Roger Stone or et cetera? Because the video was already nine minutes long, and also because most of the people you're asking about left Trump's official campaign relatively early on. It's important to remember that these days a LOT of U.S. political consultants do business abroad. I don't think in and of itself that should be a red flag.\n\n6. John Podesta was the chairman of Clinton's campaign, not of the DNC. MY MISTAKE.\n\n7. Why didn't you talk about Trump drafting the untrue initial press release for Donald Trump Jr? There's reporting about this here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-was-involved-in-drafting-sons-statement-aide-confirms.html Some people think this is a crime (likely obstruction of justice), but it seems a stretch to me. They made the meeting to be about adoption; it's perfectly possible that adoption was mentioned. That doesn't strike me as a likely crime. If we put every politician or businessperson in prison who massaged the truth in a press release, our incarceration rate would be very high, indeed. \n\nI'll add more answers (and corrections, I'm sure) as they come in. Thanks for watching. -John
+1 good desescalating and reporting and summurizing. Im glad you want to try to take a position of doubt in this.
Aw man its been so long since i watched this channel...
I would argue that while we don't know the whole truth, yet, what we do know is enough to impeach Trump and get rid of his administration. The appearance of impropriety this compelling should be enough, when it comes to elected officials. Their decisions will all under a cloud of suspicion and governments can't operate this way.
Check this interactive timeline from the Washington Post. https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/national-security/russia-hacking-timeline/?utm_term=.e950f8b69d3d
erm you forgot to include that trump fired commie for telling trump that he was not under investigation but not telling the public. 3 times
We only have words from the higher ups, the same higher ups that have been wrong about WMD's in the past. The evidence is only an agreement of government officials. This is typically what the debate boils down to. Facts that are only based in the words of the elites.
I thought the cia had tools to forge the origen point of hacks to make russia look like the culprit.
But you did forget to cite the president's golden shower incident in Russia...
As always John you remain unbiased as to the point. It is difficult to find any discussion about this topic without people getting emotional and picking sides.
Agreement is one thing, but evidence is another
Sadly, knew all of this already thanks to Seth Abrams on Twitter.\n\nSome creepy shit.
Reported independently by 2 different news organizations ( fake news & fake news ) How do I know they're fake news my source has a source that says a source says they're fake news.
I wasn't expecting this to be near as good as it was, it was far more objective than I expected, and did a decent job delivering information, not conspiracy theories. \n\nMy one question, is why not mention the fact that Comey told Trump he wasn't under investigation on three occasions, but would not publicly admit that information. I could see how Trump could be angered and fire Comey due to his refusal to publicly state Trump was not personally under investigation. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comey-told-trump-3-times-191217484.html
Yesssss as I type, this vid is on the trending page between Phil Defranco and a potato being turned to chips by a laser. What a time to be on YouTube 😍
>Says that Russia is the US's enemy for interfering with foreign democracies and illegal invasions.\n>Does not give any reasons to justify why the US might be an enemy of Russia (hint: See above).\n>Goes on to make a point about how an imbalance in information can be used to sway opinions.
A law system full of holes and grey areas which expensive lawyers can play around with all day long.\n\nIf you're not careful some rich people could take advantage of that...
Some of this sounds an awful lot like treason to me. Isn't that an issue?
Nothingburger.  Must be the fault in your stars, libtard.
Democrats should not see this as a get out of jail free card, they need to find issues and arguments to turn the heads of actual voters,  not rely on litigation,
Don't watch RT - it is russian propaganda!!! Really\nPS. Sorry, my English terrible.
When candidate Y doesn't release their tax returns\nI see what you did there, John. Well played.
This is starting to remind me of Watergate....... . . . \n\nand we all know how that turned out.
The issue i have the most problem understanding is he has ZERO political experience, yet he was still allowed to run (let alone win.)  i always thought 1 of the requirements of running for President was you had to have a certain amount of years in some type of political office (mayor, Governor, congressman, Senate, etc.)  And there has even been a handful of people who attempted to run & said they were disqualified due to not having enough political experience.  i didn't know having a reality TV show where your catch phrase is You're Fired could be considered enough experience to qualify you for being the 'leader' of a country.
Trump Is kissing ass cuz russia is 10 years ahead of us and they have all more nukes
This is my biggest problem. How in the hell do you use a term like thing of value in legal context without it bwing defined?
I know it wouldn't have been proper to include in this video but i think it is worth hilighting the work of Mike Farb and unhack the vote/vote sleuth. They have a reasonable amount of evidence that some of the votes were actually hacked in some precincts. It is my current opinion that in the future it will be determined that the vote was actually interfered with, in trump's favour, in half a dozen or so states.
But we also know that US has defeated Russia at the 2016 chess Olympiad! That should count for something :)!
So this is sort of Ironic. Americans have a rich history of meddling in foreign elections, yet when it is done to them they scream bloody murder.
DHS no Russian interface in election
The US intelligence service and the Democratic and Republican parties are definitely trustworthy sources of information.
Wow I learned a lot. Holy crap, thank you. And yes that is VERY strange that Donald would have a private meeting with Putin without a U.S. translator by his side....Wtf!? Wow. Lol
You're not up on recent events. DHS & others have reversed themselves on the Russia deal.
For all I know Don. Jr., might have been talking about adoption but that's about Russian adoption and the magnitsky act
As I understand you say you don't know much. Why bother with video ?
Nothing better than listen John with subtel Jazz spanish guitar in the background! (was not on purpose, my computer on the office has the radio latin jazz on all the time) Maybe @vlogbrothers you should applied to your videos more often.
Mob bosses are experts at making evidence disappear and making witnesses go silent.
Kudos.. I think that was a fair video.
You have done an amazing thing by making this video. So thankful. This is what makes you so awesome. You come with facts and do not interject your own feelings or opinions. Truly, truly thankful for his video.
John said it better than Morgan Freeman. Mr Freeman said the west is at war with Russia.
What does “failed to disclose” mean? Trump associates use it as a free pass all the time for laying. All government forms say that providing false information or failing to disclose information is illegal. Republicans sure love to talk about how Clintons are above the law, which is true, but that is true in the case of trump and his family too.
everything that the  intelligence community was basing their info on was from a fake dossier  from a British spy named Christopher Steele the 35 page document is unsubstantiated and Steele was hired by a US investigative firm Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson that has strong ties to the Democratic party. Since then both Steele and the key members of Fusion have been avoiding the senate hearings..   Puttin may have swayed voters but their was no colluding.
Citing The NY Times? Really? Lol what a joke
Ukraine helped Clinton against Trump. Russia gave to her foundation in exchange for Uranium and she took money from many middle eastern countries.UN Powers unmasked Americans more the normal. Had Hillary won none of this Russia stuff about hacking would have been brought up. Obama never mentioned it before the election when DHS knew. FBI never looked at DNC sever. RNC turned theirs over. They said it was hacked but not able to brake through the firewall... why no leakage.We won't see any evidence from these agencies bc they're going on heresy and none exist. lastly, remember WikiLeaks has never been wrong and stop trusting the government 100 percent. We know you idolized Obama. Don't get derangement syndrome. If anyone circumvented democracy it was Clinton to Bernie.
Hi John! My name is Yishai and I'm from Israel. just for your information: The USA did in the last Israeli elections what is ileagal in your - they contributed money to help one of the sideds to win (if you are intrested, look up the v15 movment in israel)
I would have added air quotes to win in Trump did win the election. To my mind the most surprising (and reassuring) thing about the 2016 election was that Clinton actually won the popular vote. I really didn't see that coming.
Why is this topic still being discussed?
Such a good recap! I've heard of this all, but now it's in one neat place! Thanks John,
could you do a video about what's happening in Catalonia/Spain?
Hey John, if I'm gonna share this, I need sources ^^ I know you mentioned your criteria for sources, but people will question them regardless. If you happen have the sources available, could you copy/pasta links to them somewhere? <3
Thanks for finally talking about this!\nIt's more than just trivia or political drama, it's almost certainly treason,\nand even if somehow it's not, it's _definitely_ close enough to warrant talking a lot about.\nIt's potentially dangerous to every American, ignoring it was becoming unsettling.
Let's be real... the true crime in any of this is that America decided that Hillary and trump were the two only and best options as our next presidents... there has to be far better options... it's just sad tbh
Russia interfering US election = fake, actually Israel influence should be more of a concern.
and what if ? whou couldn´t bother ???
Trump 2020. It'll be an easy election  because liberals become more and more insane every single day Trump is on the news.
We are living in the middle of it - that is the truth !
Thank you so much for making these kinds of videos! It's really hard to follow these stories on regular TV, with all the bias and speculation and what not. I really appreciate the focus on objectivity. Please make more of these in the future!
I'm shell shocked... América constantly breaks its own laws in regards to its actions in other sovereign nation
This is an important video. Thanks for all the work you put in. As an international relations student, I'm also looking forward to seeing how this ends...
Hahahahaha, hahahahahaha you still think Trump Russia is a thing? Hahahahaha,  hahahahahaha,  hahahahahaha
John i just got an ad for your book on this video
Dear John, thank you for the video. I honestly respect your work and your ideals  but I can't understand the way Americans act towards Russia and our president. I'm Russian and I can say that there are a lot of problems in our country but they aren't  different from the US or Britain or Germany or India and the people in russia aren't better or worse, we are the same with the same flaws and when respectable  people like you and your brother say that our president, government or people are undermining  democracy and so on it doesn't help anyone because everyone  sees democracy  differently for once. Sure something should be done with all this corruption and lies, but depicting Russia as an enemy isn't  good for anyone. Perhaps our countries should try working together to some common goal and not view each other as adversaries .
Thank you.  I really appreciate this as someone who gets super overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information that floats around and that you try to remain as honest and objective as possible.  Also that you say when you just don't know enough to make a statement on something.  I really love this type of video and I hope you do more of them as we learn more.
Thank you John Green for being so curious and thorough in your search for answers. With the amount of sources and viewpoints out there about this topic, it is nice to be able to count of you to find the truth by looking through many sources and reporting the facts.
If you want to find the DNC hack look at Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Imran Awan (+ Awan family).
oh please let this guy oversee every damn newspaper in the world, if only...

ZYSjPZUqLdk,

ZYSjPZUqLdk,we could all be informed properly, damn, it even sounds like a fucking utopia thinking about such a world
The bigger issue the biggest problem we have currently in the united states is, this is trending and its under 100K 😂
It's really amazing the cult like hold Trump has on his supporters, they don't care about any of this and Trump lies about it all the time and not even sophisticated lies, just lazy lies you can dispel after five minutes of looking at the evidence. I predict that while Republicans hold the house and the Senate nothing will come of this issue because it's not popular in Trumps base and Repubs don't want to rock the boat.
Can you guys just make a separate channel for Trump content...\nI feel like you guys are kind of just shoving Trump information on everyones throats at the moment.
Your opinion is a non starter.  Putting two British football team scarves next to each other is an incendiary blast of cringe.  \n\nOn subject, you mention the real question is if Trump is getting something of value from the Russian links.  Hillary and Bill were paid 300 million thing$ of value, for 20 min Wall Street speeches over the years.  Not party donations, but cash into their personal accounts.  Wall Street is made up of international entities.\n\nI think Trump is an idiot and people are giving him way to much credit to think he can collude with shady diplomats to game the presidency.  He couldn't organize a good hair and people think he can pull something this cool off?
How many people did you have to blow to have like all of your vids show up on tending
Thank you John, I'm glad you made this.
What about the pee tapes?
800 people don't like objective facts.
Please adding subtiles speak english bad. Reading better. Thank you
the definition of thing is pretty obvious, right?\nthing can refer to anything, which is therefore probably how it was intended.\nif it has significant value, don't accept it.
I hate Trump as much as the next guy, but can we please stay away from the Russia issue as long as we don't have solid evidence? There are _so_ many other issues we can rightfully attack him on, like how he campaigned as a populist who would help the working class, and he's doing the exact opposite of that in office (through healthcare, tax plans, putting five Goldman Sachs guys in his Cabinet, etc.). Most American voters care about these issues, not Russia.
These are my favorite kinds of vlogbrothers videos.  Facts only.  No partisan swing or interpretation, no conclusions drawn, no fear-mongering, no demonizing, just facts.
Even if that meeting was about adoption, that still is sanction policy that falls under the Magninsky act.
Somebody's been watching Rachel Maddow. Oh, John Green, how I love you (as a human).
Brace yourselves, incoming Trumptards!
Lot of hypocrisy.
Ummmmmm wiki leaks?
Путин -хуйло!!!
You're drunk dude
You are fake news!
BAN ISLAM AND JUDAISM THE ANTI-CHRIST LEECHES!
you do not know shit weed head..
Nice to see that you guys are finally exploring fiction writing.
This is not true. What vlogbrothers said in the video is wrong.  Both FBI head James Comey and DHS secretary Jed Johnson testified under oath in front of congress that there is NO evidence that the DNC was even hacked at all because the DNC refused to allow the FBI to inspect the servers. Wikileaks has said it was an insider leak.
reported independently by two separate news organisations COUNT ME OUT.\n\nJust because a newspaper says its true, doesn't mean its true, and doesn't mean they are going to bring any kind fo evidence outside of our sources tell us!, which will very often be fabricated sources for the purposes of justifying the news' larger agenda. \n\nYes, the news has an agenda, it is housed with deeply political people who really want to see one party succeed over others. It's news. What did you expect?
*_The DNC was not Hacked. Someone went inside of the DNC offices and took 2GB of unencrypted server data using a cheap thumb drive._*  Hillary Clinton was STUPID to not cover her tracks from people who didn't like her... *_IN HER OWN CAMP!!!_*
Dear Trump Supporters: Please watch the entire video before you dislike or make stupid comments. John already says in the video what I'm sure you're furiously typing on your keyboard -- that we do not have firm evidence of Russian collusion. \n\nJohn, thank you for making this video. Although I have been reading a lot about this as new information comes out, it's a very complex subject that I didn't necessarily understand thoroughly. This video helps a lot!
Hers what I know. The Clinton foundation sold scramjet technology to the Russians and then the Chinese. That should have been enough to land them in jail for a long long time. But no. Why don't you tell your audience why there's been no investigation?
Lol you take joy in yelling russian connection in USA election, but the millions of illegal immigrants who vote on every election, you look the other way.
This douche literally provided no proof of any connection between Trump and Russia. Does he think he convinced anybody of anything? Plus, he was wrong about quite a lot.
Evidence of Russia interfering in the US election? zero. Evidence of US interference in over 80 countries since the WW2 including Russia in 1996, overwhelming.
So, in other words: ten months of media panic, zero proof that Trump colluded with Russia. Got it.
How cute are the kids?😍😍😍
She can song better than me... :3 I'm 11

That little girl is so precious!!!!
I know it's sort of the style but I don't like all the breathyness
She’s so precious ❤️
He’s really good for a blind guy. It didn’t even look like it. Not totally spazzy like Steve Wonder

I got chills while watching this
I can't wait for her video of this Song!!!!!
I've been waiting for this!

Why does the beginning of the song sounds almost exactly like Selena´s Same Old Love ? :D Or is it just me hearing that ?
I love the support from Camilizers in here 🤗🤗 but can I ask why you's give so much hate on 5H videos? 🤔
this is so amazing i loved the dancing i loved it we need an mv asap!

She killeddddd it !!!! So glad that I covered this track 😍🙌🏽❤️
Never been fan of 5th Harmony but always felt that Camila was the most talented of them. She always was a stand out from the group since they were on X Factor. Good for her and this cool latin song.
Ok. I am here just to see camilla booty
That guy on the back tho. But nice performance
trying to dance\nExpectation: dance like camilla\nReality : dance like the man who's holding trumpet
I'm obsessed with this song, and it sounds even better without the rap. Amazing!

Her skill to pretend that she’s singing live is another level.
She is not really Singing it Right 🤔
Is this the same outfit as demi on the show?
Now invite FIfth Harmony to perform Deliver next week!
Disappointed that this doesn’t have a spanish version.
Selena Gomez same old love beat little faster. Hooray synthetic pop o I'm a woman don't subjectify but yet do to be an image in this commercialized context people call a culture. Say oo la la and hug me from behind. Sex sells we know. More strip clubs than abortion clinics though. SMH. Not a race thing I say the same for all pop.males just say baby ten times in a song and say they'll treat you different But hey its nature (friend image group in school) and nurture ( a fantasy that subdues reality) a pre teen rolled up in a Mc Donald like fashion. Big busy don't care about the crap their selling everyone knows this. Lambs to the slaughter guess what fat cat said that.First line of nirvana come as you are tells more about how to take life enter a relationship or job and stance on most anything. Who writes their (pop) stuff I'll tell a group of marketing analyst and obviously artists But anyways most people see a paragraph. Skip over and I could go on a whole spiel about ADHD and technology but what ever peace out
Damn she's like the only singer that sings good without autotune
It’s funny how everyone said Camila didn’t fit into the group because they were RnB while she was a pop princess, but she’s doing more RnB than the girls are rn lol
She trying to make it not sound auto tuned so hard
☝️😂👻it was done before it was over
THE SONG IS NEVER OVER UNTIL YOU SEE FULL COMBO
OSU SQUAD WHERE U AT!!!
So... who's played Cytus?
Played osu 3 hours before I watched this.
One word...Osu.\n\n\n\n\nI was originally gonna say DDR, but that pales in comparison to other games.
Every rhythm game be like:
He looks like Sheldon from rocko's modern life
Jesus Emmett... 3 comments with over 1K likes.... I wish I could be u...
Osu all the way
Rhythm games are one my favorite types of games lol
Somebody give this homeless viner a home
i mean, like literally every single on of his skits have been on youtubes trending
Rock Band is the best rhythm game
osu and ddr all day baby
I can't believe I've been called out
Apparently I'm the only one who doesn't find these funny. Why is that?
Inb4 one song is like 50 songs at once, and you have to deal with that one crazy as hell song.\nAnd it trolls you mid-way.\nThen at the end.\nThen the biggest troll of the song...\nPsych! That wasn't the end! We're just only beginning! That was just a pause in the song!
Everyone's tripping about people kneeling and stuff. I'm over here watching this shit.
Fever’s Remix 10 be like
Y'all go subscribe to our channel WhighamtwinZ e would highly and greatly appreciate it
how the fuck are you always on trending your content is shit
this has happened too many times to me on sif
You have great comedic timing.
That hammer had a pink handle. How odd
Just a reminder that the banner at the top of r/stepmania is the Reddit alien putting his fist through a computer monitor.
ProZD the otaku singing its just a song
That's relatable as heck
Anyone else feel as if most rhythm games don't have good music? Especially the mobile ones.
how is this guy popular,please someone tell me i beg of you
Wow this guy is making money off of 30 seconds video. YouTube is totally shit now.  Vlogs, pop music, clickbaits. All fucked up.
Omg, I hate that notes, when you are proud of your full combo and BAM the killing notes
wtf did i just watch also can i steal your subscriber count, fuuuuuh
I've been showing your videos to my wife for over a month now. She would politely smile. \nThis is the first one that made her crack up.
Gawd I want that Fairy Eli so much ;_;
TFW I've been playing this game for the past 3 years ans still going strong
God. I remember playing Guitar Hero and a SINGLE note would move super slow after a FAST CRAZY MILLION note bit and fuck it all up for me.
*plays the song perfectly*\n\n\n\n\nB+
Either is dude in my school looks EXACTLY like him (FR,FR) or that actually is him.
OMG ITS LOVE LIVE SCHOOL IDOL PROJECT I LOVE THAT SHOW
No matter how many times I see it, rhythm still looks misspelled.
rhythm games are a fad\ndead\ngone the way of the minecraft, undertale, fnaf, and tf2
Why am I here ?
Is it alright to be confused???
BeatEvo YG when I don't know the song 🤦‍♀️

This is great, but what happened to the old actor for the main guy?
You greenies don't know my emotional attachment to this series.
This movie gon be so good
Where's the maze btw?
I CANT WAIT TO WATCH IT
Its so awesome how you see someone growing through movies...etc percy jackson and the maze runner look at him now!! Grown so fast!
If it gets to Newts scene I'm gonna have to leave the cinema \n\nYou all know what scene I'm talking about...
Quick recap for half the trailer cause everyone forgot the franchise was still running
Took ya long enough... 😂 lol I'm kidding I love your movies it looks great can't wait to watch this one and more to come hopefully 👍😉
The books emotionally crippled me and I was crying the whole time. Welp I'll go re read the series again
Looks amazing, I was scared that the second didn't go as good and there wasn't gonna be a third
Go to google and simply type: *gamesecrx guide* You're going to get the only 100% working secret fully FREE for the game.
Dang as if Ready Player One already looked amazing this is just as amazing!
Alright I got shot gun best part
I'm waiting for Please Tommy please 😞
Ok i dont think any of the words they said was actually in the book, they better not mess up this movie the way they did scortch
I love this trailer and i want to See the movie.  ❤❤😢
I waited tow years for this now have to wait another 4 month 😫
OMG I love you Dylan ♡ and BTS has 61 M views!
Doesn’t look as good as the book :(
i dont see Minho in this. ....
Oh DAYM it is finally here!!
Infinite Dimensions, i guess in this one i was trapped in a maze
*ADDS DATE TO CALENDAR SO I DON'T FORGET TO REQUEST THAT DAY OFF IN ORDER TO GO SEE MOVIE*
I AM NOT READY OMFG IT BETTER NOT BE LIKE THE BOOK
I'm still not forgiving Theresa
Am I the only one that loves the movie series as much as the books? The actors are great and the sets and visuals are amazing too
That train part is clearly near Santa Fe  & Albuquerque.  Wonder if they will put the accident that Dylan suffered into a deleted scene on the DVD.
FINALLY IT LOOKS MORE INTENSE I BETTER GO WATCH THIS
You think they're gonna do it?
So, 90% of the movie is about a train heist?
Yes OMG I have been waited to fricken watch the third maze runner. OMG yesssss\nE
My baby is all grown up from the teen sing wannabe from spice girls dancing to the sarcasm is his only defence to kick everyone butts and being an assassin I'm so proud of Dylan
Finally I been wait ever since I step out the theater from scorch trials
Whoah...I see Paul Walker in Dylan O'Brien.
fast and furious 9? the legacy?
Turning into an action movie. Unless this trailer is made up of only random scenes i lost hope
when you realize missandei, littlefinger, and jojen are all together in the same movie
I’ve been waiting 2years for this
When it shows there in the train look in the background and u can see minho
IM SO READY FOR THIS!!! IVE READ TO SERIES TWICE!!!
Got it on Boulay homes !🙌🏽 ... 5$ a pot or 5 for 20 $ lol 😆
I know it’s so sad but I really hope page 250 happens in the movie. It has to, its such an essential part of the story
Is this still a thing?
The second movie seemed to be like a part one didn’t it?
I found the cure to life.
So pumped for this movie!!!!
I've been waiting to see this new trailer of maze 🏃🏻 the 💀 cure for a long time.
This movie comes out extremely close to my birthday, and I am watching it in the cinema with my best friend who has never read the book or watched the movies. Hetalia is more on her wavelength, and she doesn't understand why I just randomly threw this book across the room when I read it. I really will sling my popcorn ACROSS THE ROOM IF 250 IS IN THE MOVIE......... rant over.
i almost forgot about maze runner lol kinda glad it’s back
Dang it's been years since I read the books. Forgot there was even a Maze Runner movie trilogy.
The Trailer was short! But I hope we get another trailer soon!
YASS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE I WAS BORN
It looks like a better movie then the scorch trials but they've had a theme of every movie getting less and less true to the book so I'm hoping they don't completely mess up the story for the middle school girls watching it for the hot guys but then again those kinda people don't read books other then the fault in our stars and paper towns anyways
He looks like a young Paul Walker
omg ive been waiting for a new maze runner
YALL IM NOT READY FOR THIS
Do you guys think Minho and co will be saved????
THIS IS GONNA BE SO BADASS
What are you doing here Stiles?
Who's hear before it goes trending?
ITS BEEN SO LOOOONG FINNALLY

so uh wheres Minho
Noel is just leagues above his simpleton brother in every way.  While Liam is ranting like a bitter child on Twitter, Noel is writing classic rock n roll tracks. I'd wondered how someone with such a poor grasp of English could have written an album, but it turns out Liam hired a pop songwriting team to help him do it. It took FIVE people to write Wall of Glass, including people who usually work with Adele and Charlie XCX LMAO. Also funny that Liam's tour wasn't selling so well, so he had to announce that he'd be singing Oasis tracks as well as his own LMAO.  How much of a hypocrite do you have to be to spend your life slating your brother,  but you're quite happy to sing his lyrics on stage. The guy's a joke. Looking forward to your album and tour Noel.
Nice to see Tame impala chemical brothers flaming lips and pink floyd Back
This is my kinda shit!
i think noel is great
he is fucking back
I wanna use this as my wake up alarm.
God built the moon! Earth is flat!
It's gonna be a great album, but I prefer the first HFB's album vibes. Everybody's on the run, Broken Arrow, What a Life, A Simple Game of a Genius and If I Had a Gun... ¡Man! That was Noel at his best.
This sounds absolutely incredible, shoegaze psychedelic rock! Hopefully this gives us the sounds of that Amorphous project that didn't take off at the start!
Oh no chief... Did you just start another drug again? What the psychedelic.
Nice, chief! Sounds like New Order.
First part sounds like we got the power gorillaz
Yer da just wants rock music
He's like Midas, everything he touches turns to gold!
A mix of Tame Impala and U2. I hope he doesn't lose his essence. We'll see...
Sounds like Noel totally leaves the Oasis background behind and goes totally Spacey Indie Rock. \n\nOnly heard bits of 3 clips now..  not sure how to like this yet. For now, I prefer Liams album, for what I've heard. But maybe when i can hear a bit more of Noels album, I'll totally change my mind.\n\nMy guts say we don't get the typical Noel athems on this album. If so, that would be a shame.
Named after one of my fave books... get on to the book, fucking eye openingly weird as fuck.
I have watched this too many times because hyPE
you gotta get your self connected the writings on the world and if your minds neglected stumble you might fall lol
For what it' s worth
Very New Order sounding on the last track
Who else is getting a sold out libtarded youtube advert about fallout boy every thing they click, god i barely like them anyway pieces of reckless shit.
His first album wasn't that good in fact it was crap! his second album chasing yesterday was amazing with brilliant bsides to go with it. I'm not too sure what to make of this one time will tell I suppose!
noel has officially become a hipster :D
Too much time spent with the Gorillaz?
New Liam's album > new Noel's album
Might get high for the first time when I hear this for the first time. Could be biblical
Prefer Liam and this shit confirmed it
Pish
Esta genial.
Yes Knowel, these r sum blazin beats, pure fire!
Sick
Biblical
wow.....
potato boring
Last song....Blondie influenced?
You've absolutely nailed it Noel.....
Snoozer
Can't wait ✌🎢
honestly????   shite...sorry.
Very Coldplay.
Los Gallagher's saben cómo hacer marketing se pelean , y para más consumo sacan dos albums a la vez putos genios , #liveforerer
seamos realistas. Noel es un groso pero esto es una garcha. espero que el disco no sea con esta onda porque al menos a mi no me va a gustar. espero que solo sea una estrategia para que crezca la incertidumbre sobre el nuevo album. y me quedo con esa esperanza. esperando al 24 de noviembre...
Admitanlo es bueno ver a Liam salir del retiro y recuperar un tono de esa gran voz que no volverá jamás \nPero vamos !!\nNoel se lo está garchando \nY sigue éxito tras éxito \nAunque \nSigo pensando porque rayos aún retiene a su baterista gordo ! \nY a su guitarrista que intenta parecerse a gem !???? \nTocan horrible!!!! \nQué vuelva Terry y GEM!!!!!!
Sounds like New Order meeting Chemical Brothers under a very fuckin' good acid
OMG what is this .. let's get back to Joey Beltram
This sounds good and something different to the Oasis sound. I love Oasis but its good to listen to a different album
Another reason to live
We want the new single out now!
First tune sounds epic, the rest not so much
It would mean the world to me if your could subscribe to my channel!! Xx 😘
I'm gonna listen to Liam's album out of curiosity, but seeing this I'm sure Noel will slay it.
Think Noel is going back to his young acid taking days here !! Can’t say I’m too excited by that promotional vid but hopefully there’s some good tunes coming our way 👍
lads stop bitching, let the man experiment.. this sounds really fucking cool and unique. really excited!
This is just what I needed
wow way to rip off m83
Finally sounds like something I can get behind, not like his old AOR.
The music is refreshing I love it
Was that kates bush at the end?
Who built the sun for that matter.
Sounds like the Intro to mission impossible at start
Are you guys betting between Noel and Liam? Man.... Noel always wrote Oasis songs... Noel is the fuckin' genius.
NOEL IS GOD!\nBest songwriter in the last 30 years.
GUYS! THIS IS AN ALBUM TRAILER! NOT AN ACTUAL SONG. CALM THE FUCK DOWN
Is he back on drugs?
Excited for both Liam and Noel album to come out.
Seems like everyone who wanted The Beatles to keep playing rock and roll covers are having their say. Don't worry people I heard The Enemy are bringing out a new album soon. You can drench yourself in 3 chord wonder then. Let's not be progressive or anything. Lord no, we can't have that
Sounds good to me, bit like U2 or X & Y coldplay.
Illuminati confirmed
1.39- sounds like hooky!
WTF????? SUENA SÚPER FRESCO :D
kasabian???
awssome
GENIUS GOD LIKE!
this music intro reminds me mission impossible
OIOIIIIIIII
Noel! The Chief! ❤️
YAAY
Shit
Liam Gallagher > Noel Gallagher
Not feeling these.
Se quejaba de otros artistas y ahora suena como Kaiser Chiefs & Guster.
Liam's music is much better than this shit.
Lets pretend for a moment the same music & video was done without Noel Gallagher.  How many people would like it then?
Noel and liam releasing two new albums only a reunion would be better i still think liams will be more successful tho
Sounds like a U2 early 90s shite. No soul in this. Big sounds no substance.
I won't go any where near this crap.
I admire Noel for venturing into new genres while Liam is still stuck in his formula of songs written by other songwriters in the style of Oasis
just terrible, like generic 1992 disco pop
NGHFB = U2
WALLL OF GLAAAASSS\nWait...
Hurts my ears
HOrrible..
No.
what is this? kinda dissapointing
Disco Noel💩💩💩
This sounds awful.
There goes my hope of hearing something like Bring it on Down. It's all gone a bit coldplay?
compared to every as you were stuff that I have heard so far is this very disappointing
Sounds like U2
I get 150mbps through Ethernet and 50mbps on wifi for $50 a month here in Canada 😬
I liked this until it went to the anti Trump propaganda
Same in Germany. A lot have less than 50mbit. I pay 45€/months for 100mbit. Super expensive.
Ah ha! Of course the cucks over here at vox find a way to bash trump
no offense to anyone but i feel glad living in las vegas since it has good wifi
Just wish more people took advantage of the opportunity that having high speed internet is and would waste less time arguing on facebook or watching snap chat stories.
And we in Iran dream of a 2mbps internet speed for downloading
I get 100mbps , for $67 a month , in Phoenix AZ ( with a 1Tb data limit per month )
So this is basically saying that if Hillary was elected president, we wouldn't have this issues, because she'd make sure with her private servers that middle-class white people won't be unequally sharing Internet access across the nation?
10 megabytes a second isn't actually that bad I can do everything with it I play game internet and Netflix runs well  really good
According to the broadband map I live in a blue section that gets good internet yet here I am with crappy expensive satellite as my only option.
Terms like broadband and chickband are demeaning to women.
5:05 Oh wow! So Trump has finally done something good.... aaaand no he hasn't.
Anywhere there is an electric line there can be gigabit internet.  Huge copper wires can carry huge amounts of data without affecting the power that runs peoples homes.  The only reason it has not been done mass market is because the power structure in 'Merica is still 100 years old and will need retooled at the power plants.
Is the first few mins of this video just a huge false causation argument?
how about you do Why 23 million (100%) of Australians don't have fast internet\nwe're literally all on around 5mb/s because our goverment thinks no one would use fast internet, even if we had it
Really Hate Optimum company.  I’m still stuck with that greed company because there’s no other providers in a small suburban city NJ. Smh
How about 'Why 100+ millions Filipinos don't have fast internet'
Don't let this distract you from the fact that the earth is flat
Hahaha xD Dude... The statistic table shown at 6:32 is wrong by doing the statement that germany has a higher mobile internet quality than Japan. That is wrong. Why can i say this? I live in Germany. My daily driver is a Galaxy A3 with LTE and i can say, that only in metropole regions like Hamburg, Berlin and other bigger cities 4G (LTE) is available. If you drive with your car through the country on some autobahns, you mostly get Edge speed. Why? Because the same argument you used for the glass fibre infrastructure is applicable to our main net provider Telekom. They first built 4G at the most profitable metropole regions. That's it. The cables with especially glass fibre is so rare in germany. If you can load a steam game in under an hour you are very lucky and you cross this day in your calendar. You just have to look at South Korea. They are the most advanced country with 5G mobile network. 5G has average speeds of 1GB/s. This is fast ;)
Did anyone see Kingsmen? Samuel Jackson is coming
NEW VIDEO PLAN: Why 102 million Filipino has Slow Wifi
I climb on top of my roof in Nigeria to get 3G, but I can see why this is a problem in America
What about the 23 million Australians who don't have fast internet.
The internet in Iceland will make you feel like a demigod.
i cant get any broadband service where i live in east tennessee, but less than 5 min down the road, i could choose between cable or dsl. due to wierd situation i own my house but not the land, and the owner of the land decides who can actually stay on said land and they wont let me sell or rent the house. i also cant get cellphone service without using a 500 dollar signal amplifier that is ductaped to the side of the highest point on my house. with all that effort, i get a maximum of 2 bars of 4lte signal, and my speed is roughly 3mbps down, but less than 1mbps up. uploading maxxes out at 100k a sec. it such bullshit that i cant even pay a company for the service of wiring up my house. i would gladly go into debt  just to have the PRIVILEGE of paying a monthly fee for true broadband.
Z U C C all 4 billion of them
Slightly lower than the population of Australia... interesting....
Lol I have 2.5/0.5 stop complaining. I live where people the next street over can get 50/20, just the dumb Australian government's fault.
It's cool to hear that despite all its faults, inet DOES improve quality of life\n\nAt some point we should start treating it as an essential service like water & electricity and have the state provide and mantain infrastructure. Thats precilely what the state is for, to create a minimum level of equality when capitalistic incentives alone don't.
no mention of the millions/billions given to the isps by the government where they did NOT use it to expand the national broadband service?
Are these spots look like they are on the reservations
as I watch this on the only access to the Internet,  my Verizon cell phone where they routinely dropped my access from the 4LTE to 3G or like for past week 1x.   Verizon use to be the only access to copper line and DSL but they failed to provide it to us after promising to have it available by 2005, instead they gave the two communities near by fiber optic (FiOs). So here we sit, getting throttled on our 2008 unlimited data plan that the contract did not include data caps.
Watching on 50mbs mobile from Finland
So the only good thing Trump has said and he wont even do it?
And here I am with 2mbps internet speed. I see no problem for streaming and stuff
Of course Ajit would do the laziest thing and change the definition to accomplish something.
I had to go to Boise Idaho for business things and the internet there is super slow (i live in washington state)
this video literally took a minute to load and I'm in the third largest city in canada oml
here in norway we only need 3G routers then we have 70 mps\n\nwe actually have 5G+ routers  then will prob give 100-300mps
I just discovered that in some countries you get a data cap? How can people even live there? I usually use about 2.5 terabytes of internet a month
Or those backwards ass hillbillies can just not live way out in the sticks
10mbps was a suggestion guys. You’re basing your entire argument on a suggestion
I guess the shitty internet is why so many americans voted for trump, they didn't even research.
Please explain why Australia internet
nyc got the goat of wifi
Cause my stupid neighbor figured out my password. It's password:/
Here’s a better question: why does ALL OF AUSTRALIA have slow internet?
I knew Tump would find a way to screw Americans.
The real question is why 100% of people in England don't have fast internet
I almost closed my browser in the first 15 sec because of that circle
There may be a correlation of internet speeds to poverty, but you cant suggest that it cuases it
In Florida we have the best wifi internet etc I rarely have anything load
I have 11family members in my house, no Ethernet (because my mom doesn't want a wire running through the house), and 14mb down .5mb up most of the time even though we (i think) pay for 20 down and 5 up .
I’m watching this video in Nashville TN on Google Fiber lol
many years from now all will pretend to have never supported trump.
This explains why Trump voters weren't able to Google any of Trump's claims during the campaign.
Well they should move to civilization.  These are the same idiots complaining their jobs left decades ago, but still choose to live there for no reason.  They need to get a life and move to the cities.
My connection is going up to 500mbps. I never had connectivity problems, at least in my town (Petroșani, Romania, EU).
US is about 75 times larger than Greece, and has a GDP about 95 times larger. If we're assuming that the US should have completely homogenous coverage, I'd say given the topography difficulties, then those ratios make sense.\n\nOf course in much of the US the broadband coverage is significantly greater than most countries. \n\nLong story short, not really Apples to Apples. We have it even worse in Canada, where our cellular providers barely cover out of cities.\n\n\nSource: http://www.mylifeelsewhere.com/country-size-comparison/united-states/greece\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_between_U.S._states_and_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)
Actually 4G must be capable of 100Mbps down to moving phones and 1Gbps (one thousand Mbps) down to stationary phones, but okay.\n\nIt's actually 3G that must be capable of 10Mbps down while in motion and 100Mbps down stationary.
Don’t forget about decent system specifications with custom software tweak play an important role in term of Performance.
I don’t see why this is a problem. \n\n\nUpdate: I don’t see why we let this become a problem
The highest I get is about 10mbps
What they should do is drop the monopoly on cable internet and turn it over to the federal government.. The cable companies can then compete to offer services like PlayStation Vue does.
This video should be about why the whole Australian population doesn't have fats internet
in Boise, Idaho, the internet is pretty slow (but not terrible compared to the many rural places in this state) and it's okay for apps and short videos. it's just extremely irritating when I need to start my homework and the internet is gone for hours, despite perfect weather, or when I want to watch something and the video buffers every 3 seconds.
i live in a rural area and internet works smooth as silk ,you dont know what your talking about Vox
Even if 10Mbps is lower than the current Broadband benchmark and would just be setting the goalposts lower, I would love to have even just 10Mbps.\n\nIn town just 30 miles away, they have cable internet speeds of 200Mbps or more, but here where I live, the MAX we can get is 1.5Mbps. Most of the time I'm not even getting that, closer to just 1Mbps, and that's all because the only hardline provider out here is Centurylink. Anyone who has ever had centurylink knows just how bad they are. I wish we could do our own community internet service, but thanks to telecom territory laws that'll never happen.
Call it Alphabet all you want I know Google when i see it
And satellite internet is expensive AF.
I love how somehow slow internet leads to health issues😂😂😂
Dude i went to work and the internet was so fast 100mbs per sec lpl
The answer is to provide VDSL on existing copper cable.  Which most everyone has.  If you have POTS you probably have copper cable.
so this is why my video games are a consistent 200+ ping... literally changed routers SIX times in the last SIX months
That comparison was hugely misleading just to send a message. Read the source you mentioned properly and the situation isn't as grim as you present it to be compared to other countries. Everything on internet is propaganda these days for either camp, lack of genuine videos.\nhttps://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/state-of-the-internet-connectivity-visualization.jsp
Why 24 million Australians don't have fast internet (entire population)
Oh poor Americans they don't have proper internet even though china is living poverty it doesn't matter, we need to get Americans fast internet( sarcasm)
I wish Google fiber wasn't so much though
Oh gosh, this video triggered my 10 hour non stop sax guy video addiction. Got to watch it now, bye!
Now try being Australian
Of course an educational video from Vox will end up as a Trump bashing propaganda
3rd world country ;p
Farmersonly about to be packed

Answer is.... comcast.
Wow!, did you see those tittes @2:41
(TRIGGERED)
1:35 correlation doesn't prove causation
Just use an Ethernet cord

Those poor bastards. I get 400 Mbps

*cough* Australian Internet *cough*
10mbps for 5$ here in Bangladesh per month.
I live in cedar falls Iowa
What? You need buttons to actually use this??
Sorry kid, no touch screen. That old piece of crap was made back in the horse and buggy days.
Humanity has come a long way...
Pokemon yellow ! Starting her off on the best game !
I used to give my little brother my iPhone and he didn't know how to work it because there was no buttons and only a touch screen, now it's the other way around
You failed as a parent
This hurts. Like, it hurts.
Man i kind of got mad
When I show my kids my gba in 2080
does this little girl even know how to use a gameboy????
its really cute but this hurt me sooooooo badly for many reasons
I'm sad now...
Don't give it to a girl ! They can't appreciate it on any level !
Wow so glad i had a childhood.\n\n-14 year olds
This is how spoiled kids are these days
I'm getting a vesectomy
That's a gameboy color, not a gameboy.
Jesus Christ all of you are such opinionated monsters!! Lmao it's a funny 13 second clip of a child not getting their parents old toy. It's for the gigs people lighten up :)
Ive seen my little cousin do the same thing. They dont understand the joy of actual physical buttons instead of a touch screen
It's not as sad or scary as you think it is. She is at an age where she hasn't had much if any experience with analog inputs into a digital space. She sees something that looks interactable and she tries to interact with it, not because she has grown up using her mums ipad but because that is the bases for learning and  interacting with the world around her. Its like fitting the correct shapes in the correct slots, you don't look for an arrow key to press to move the shapes into the slots; you instead physically pick up the shapes and put them into the slots. Stop trying to paint three year olds as uncultured swine
I don't wanna live on this planet anymore
I just gave my 1.5 year old daughter mine and she knew to push the buttons. #parentingwin
Has she figured it out yet!
When this generation is so screwed up. There's buttons for a reason.
This is sad why would I say it's cute
Guess it runs in the family \nRecords vertically
This is the stupidest thing ever
Oof... reminds me of when I beat Pokemon Fire Red when I was 3...\nReminds me of how clueless I was.\nBut this hurts. A lot.
OH GOD THE PAIN
Trying to play Game Boy
That's a gameboy colour isn't it?
A kid failing to use a device older than quadruple her age is not sad or depressing. It's accurate.
This generation is so sad
OUch! I feel old and sad.
I fear the future now
I feel old._. I'm 23
2 things i miss right now.....\n1.Gameboys\n2.Good trending videos, not that jake paul bullshit and gta money glitch crap
Kids are so high tech
This is so sad :(
She was so ahead of the game with the touch screen!
Wonder what she thinks the buttons on the bottom are for
🤦‍♂️ I hope my kids are not dumb like this
Sexist. They assumed the gender of that game.
;-; i hate it it angers me
Guys most people aren't sad because she doesn't know how to use it, people are sad because there old
I don't understand why people say it's sad. She's grown up with modern technology, of course her reaction would be to touch the screen. She's learning about history really...stop being such purists...
with out needing to watch and just by hearing the music i knew it was pokemon gold
The kid’s playing Pokémon Yellow. I loved that game!
Remember when you tried playing the GameBoy during a road trip at night and the only way too see the screen if you pass a street light? Oh man, nostalgia.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
I almost cried this makes me sad
Such a simple act pains millions of people >.<
You'd think at a young age, she'd be allover the buttons. \nI don't get it.
Thank god I wasn't her age when touchscreens existed.
As the name implies, it's a game boy. No girls can use it
how did this get on trending
You youths are destroying society with your gamechats and your snapboys. Back in my day we didn't have computers. We read the newspapers and walked 10 miles to school in the snow everyday for fun.
This, this is what touch screen has done...
*talks about nostalgia comments and how it's sad and gets 100+ likes*
Today's kids will never know:
I still have my Game Boy colour! I only have Tetris though.
This makes me feel old
Christ thinks she’s it a touch screen 😂
Hurts my life as a kid
Hurts my soul
This killed me
Kys
*MY HEART ACHES* 💔💔💔
Lol
I wanna kill myself
*DISGUSTING!*
*sees buttons*......\n\n\n\n\n*Touches screen* BEHSJWBSUEBDHD
Nooooooooooo
😢😡
Awww honey
...........................
I have one
Dislike foreshame smh
I feel old
This hurts me.
Jfc
How is this trending?
....why?!
kids these days
Rip this generation
Ya dummy
Sad
how is this trending lol
https://www.gofundme.com/get-red-to-college
I feel old...
Nooooooo :(
2017
Faith in humanity: 0
That is sad.
Instead of Gameboy how about Gamegirl?
She's grounded.
LMAO
I WORK HARD ON MY CHANNEL WHILE STUFF LIKE THIS GOES VIRAL 🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁
She will never know what we had to deal with
If only Gameboy was touchscreen back then...
I love your style Tanya! I see you’re at Battersea park! Did you see someone let out a python and it was just chillin there😫😱 so scary, to think I was going to go yesterday as well

Incredible!
Lol@CMTG telling Bryshere to write Lee so e lyrics for the dick challenge
Yaz comes off very awkward...almost painful to watch. 🤦🏾‍♀️
I stopped watching after no one knew who Khandi Alexander was
Can't help but to think of the Boondocks episode
😲 STOP. Nobody notices the info LD is dropping?
Somebody sexing somebody... That gay spirit is strong . Energy is off
he pipin that young man, they both saucey
Does this interview pick up?  I'm about to log out.
Who's doing the sound check on these mics they need to be FIRED
Breyshere is probably being fucked in the butt by Lee.
I'm s black gay man (black FIRST) and even I can admit Lee Daniels is problematic for the black community. Don't believe his bullshit, he was behind white supremacist wet dream shit like Precious and Monster's Ball. Two horrible films that portrayed black people in a degenerative state.
I just love lee ❤️
Why is it that being gay in the Black community is a big deal in 2017 and BlackOnBlack crimes is acceptable?\n\nYou people are the real detriment to the Black Community if the black community was so important you would stop killing each other over the dumbest shit ever like colors or the neighborhood you're from!\n\nWhite people hate us and are reluctant to get to know us because of quote on quote Straight Black Men, and if it wasn't for the quote on quote Gay Black Men the crime and welfare rate would be a lot higher then it is today with blacks!
Everything was normal until i saw Lee Daniels' ear!
I feel like Lee Daniels is REALLY passionate about Bryshere ! I'm not mad at all.... Just sayin! 🤔
I'm so sick of people with all of his sexuality bullcrap I'm transgender I know plenty of heterosexual men who don't get down like that just because I'm friends with a heterosexual person doesn't mean I'm sleeping with them y'all got to get up off of this shit we can be cool with heterosexual people I don't throw myself at hederosexual men it's okay that we're cool with heterosexual people don't make it seem like we're all sleeping with them are trying to sleep with them
Lee 's interviews always weird af
Why are they both crossing their arms? Some strange energy right here.
This wasn't weird, It was a great interview.
Something bout yaz on this interview feels weird AF.
Lee Daniels is a legend y'all gonna hate cause be Gay but you gotta respect
If you don't understand Racism which is White Supremacy what it is and how it works, everything else you understand will only confuse you. Nelly Fuller Jr.
Lee Daniel seems like to type to sexually abuse a man before a job/role is offered.  Bashire has seen and experienced too much hence looks uncomfortable in the presence of lee. Ctha makes subtle remarks to Bashire '' do you need permission from big daddy?''.
Im 2 minutes in this interview is dry Yaz dont feel like talkin im through lol
Why is Lee sweating and chalamagme wearing a winter coat?
Where is Dame Dash 💰 Lee??
Why is he whispering tho? I'm glad CTG bust him out!
Dj Envy knew this sweet boy was coming so he cleared it #Smartmove ✌🏿
Yall just hating on Lee... He doing his thing... Keep it up Lee....#BlackPower💪
the older son gone die
speaking of macy, what happened to big booty macy
Is it me or do Lee Daniels & Tyler Perry look alike.
This interview is def weird lol WTH is going on 😂
Seems like the Guests don't want to be there! Hmmm
Thanks, Mr. Daniels for your film on Rustin. I can simply say oh my gosh. Blessings on you. Is the movie being filmed now? I am sure this movie will be rich. Ok, I need to take part in this movie.  I have been teaching Rustin for years!
They fucking I don't care what nobody say
ANGELA YEE MAKING YAZ SOUND LIKE A STRAIGHT BYCH!!!! “DID YOU ASK BIG DADDY” hahahaha AND THIS NIXXA JUST SITTING THERE LIKE A FUCCN PUPPET.!! SMFH
Ron Newt in a Vlad TV interview said that Terrance Howard stole the idea of Empire based on Ron's actual life story that
Ok I'm just going to say it! Lee Daniels is fucking that boy and we all know it!!! Now you can start the slow clap!!!
INTERVIEW JOE ROGAN that will be an interview...
Best interview in a while.  I  love Lee Daniels,  I totally relate to him and his plight.
Something is off In there . I think something gay happen before they came to the interview
sooo now that lippy leroy said his 2 cents ... when u going to have Ms. Monique on the show to have her say OR have you all black balled her too?!
Wanted to hear more from Bryshere<3
Let Me Find Out They Fucking...
It’s sad to see dumb ass people in the comments talking shit about a show that’s broken records and won awards. Something I don’t see Power doing...🐸☕️. Not that I have a problem with Power but the proof is there that Empire has been a hit and still doing it’s thing. We should support our black actors and shows but we don’t and wonder why the white actors get everything. The homophobic comments are ignorant and if that’s all you get out of the show then you’re not seeing the bigger picture of it.
He looks good to be in his late 50s
Not everyone makes a good interview.
hey lil mama let me whisper in your ear
This should have been Lee's interview just saying.
Omg y'all got to do better about the sounds on these interviews smh make them speak up I started to stop watching
He hitting that.. yall know right...
Terrible interviews come on breakfast club
Why is this interview so awkward? This is almost as bad as Migos interviews.
Who else didn't notice that envy was gone??
⚠️ ⚠️⚠️WARNING 🔥🔥🔥COMMENT SECTION IS FILLED WITH IGNORANCE READ COMMENTS AT YOUR OWN RISK😂😂😂
Dj envy: so can you explain what gay is..
I bet Lee Daniels fucking all these boys for them to get on the show. And he sweating like he still on coke.
Did they just get threw fucking or something damn
Yuh I’m calling it now, ol dude from empire Hakeem is a strate homo
Empire is so trash and this interview is drier than desert pussy
The body language vibe between lee and yazz is suspect🤔 Its gonna come out trust
This interview is uncomfortable. I hope Lee Daniels not turning out  Bryshere Gray and other male young actors. To take it to  the next  level in the industry.
God damn lee took that boy ass, charged him for that job
11:35 I'm gone pray for yazz
lee Daniels is clearly on drugs in this interview.it looks to be heroin or opiates not coke.the way he acts you would think he couldn't create such a good show, which makes me think he has people around him that do most of the work,especially since he didn't know charlamagne was on the empire.its kind of sad how when we have powerful black men in position they are often conquered by drug abuse.i hope im wrong but he's showing a lot of signs of someone being on drugs and not signs of being a top producer.the eye closing from almost nodding out,getting really hot,incoherent sentances,up and down of emotions and just weird behavior.i thought this before he even said he was a past drug addict,which I unaware of...i haven't seen lee interact much before this so if this is typical lee behavior someone correct me cuZ I could be wrong or he could always be fucked up
Damn I have ear phones on and can’t barley  hear this nigga 💀😂😂💯
Everyone that told me i should watch Empire don't watch it anymore.\nThey say the show got corny now, no shit it's on Fox it's a PG network.
Angela is getting worse and worse at interviewing, its sad. She rambles on without presenting a question, includes herself somehow in the topic, switches subjects abruptly, weird questions, just bad.
All I got from this interview is that Hakeem slept with Lee Daniels for a role
He seems like he is still on drugs. They should have done an interview with Yaz by himself. Lee Daniels has issues.
Yaz is hiding and whispering  bc he sold his soul and Ass to Lee Daniels. Sad 😒
Lee Daniels is a very troubled man. Energy tells everything and I get the feeling he is pressuring Hakeem for a relationship off screen. It's obvious he's attracted to him. He needs counseling to deal with his family issues for sure. He hasn't healed.
Mofaya Sbu Leope is pushing this energy drink.
Bull lee definitely fuckin yazz
Whole cast light skinned.
Automatic thumbs down for Lee Daniels.
Yaz crying reading these comments
they smashing!
This dude Silly. You still Blackballing Monique. Lol
So many awkward suspect moments 7:38 😂
I love #Empire 😍😘😘😘
2017 Chris stokes marcus Houston take that take that take that
Imagine if Dj Envy was there
14:19 Lee staring him down!
why  dont u talk about puertorico u fuckin lames
Yazz got a hangover !!!!
Arms crossed???
It's obvious bryshere gray screwing lee daniels
they need DJ ENVY
These niggas is weird..............
lee hittin that
Somebody suckn somebody dick.
somebodys getting fucked in their ass
This is legendary.
I  just came  for Bryshere Gray!!!
fuk both these fukn FAGGOTs wak af
This man gonna die in his sins if he dont repent like everybody else if they dont change he wicked as hell he us a admonition which is one of the worst sins and it dont matter how much money  he got it or how many wicked blacks he get jobs fir to help spread foolishness luke adultry, fornication, and drugs on tv to our people. He hate himslef his people and God....And it kills me when straight men like Charlmagne try to say it dont matter. . living wicked does matter
It's A Damn Shame That I'm Gay 😂😂😂😂😂😂 This Dude Is Hella Funny Man
I can't hear shit! Both these niggaz talking low! DJ Envy would've been like Talk into the mic please !  &  please explain to the people how gay you are on a scale of 1-10 !
fall vibes are the best🌅🌙🍁🍂

YAY! The Zoella Autumn videos have started!! Does anyone else watch these videos and get so excited to go buy autumn/halloween stuff at the store??
I love your videos!
I wish the video was longer!
Clicked on this faster than I blinked
Awww Gabriella has the same peach bedding ❤️😘
this gives me autumn vibes 🎃🍁🍂🍁🍁
Hey, Tom, you know what really gets numbers on YouTube? Videos about financial minutiae. (Prof. Rouwenhorst is spectacularly overqualified for this interview; he's one of the world's leading experts on finance and financial history, and I'm really grateful he was able to take the time to talk about the original bond!)
Damn, I would love to have Tom Scott's air miles. They would be huge!
That is just so effing interesting. <-- not sarcasm
I am a Dutchman and I did not even know about this. Shame on me! Thank you very much for sharing this with us all, Tom Scott! Keep up the good work!
Bank: How's your credit?\n\nWater Company: I've paid on time for 300 years. \n\nBank: Eh, denied.
Holy crap Tom's gonna get to 1 mil subs!
Wait, a financial innovation?  It occurred to people Lend me some money now, and I'll pay you back a little at a time forever before I'll pay you back over the next few years plus a little extra for your trouble?  Yeah, that's consistent with my observations of humanity.  It also sounds like something a 3-year old would do.
HOLLAND i am from holland XD
this is actually really cool
How is this debt supposed to be payed off? Can the debtor anytime say here is your principal, now give the bond back? If so they wouldn't need to default and could just pay it off.
Over the course of the bond payments if all interest payments were put into an account earning avg 5% per year today it would be worth around 70 billion dollars, probably more.
where do you get the money to go to these places ? :-0
So Yale pays that guy to travel over to Europe in order to collect a fraction of the money for the plane ticket back. It may be history for the Netherlands, but it sounds like that Yale guy got a sweet job out of it.
How do you always find such nice people for your videos?! This guy's enthusiasm is infectious.
Ahhh Yale University, The only good thing about Connecticut....\n\n( Used to live in CT )
GLOVES. WHY ISN'T WE WEARING GLOVES? My mum worked at a museum for years and I had this drilled into me. You never handle paper artefacts without gloves!
What a dumb system....archaic.  If only we had a decentralized peer-2-peer blockchain technology.
you know there is something called: US National Debt
What's interesting is that even though this particular item only amounts to 11 euros per year, it makes one wonder what other items are out there earning perpetual interest;  plus, can the payer no finally pay off the bond and be done with it?
How excited and happy that guy looked about a (interesting but) very old and slightly worthless deal makes my night better
Oh commoooon Tom the only good thing that happens in New Haven is you coming and you NEVER told me. I'm disappointed my friend is this how our friendship ends?
Had the constant e even been approximated 367 years ago?
You visited my hometown and didn't come over for tea?! (You can actually see my old dorm in the video!)
As if Yale didn't make enough money already. They should cash the money then donate it.
Doesn't the UK have debt from the mid-to-late 18th century it's still paying on?
Is your next video going to explain how the water authority was able to unilaterally decrease the interest they are obligated to pay?
Tom, you have the funnest videos
Are you still in debt for to your old hairdresser? That might explain why your sporting a hairstyle from the 90s!
I know one debt that still keeps paying. \n\nColonialism.
I am disappointed Tom Scott neglected to explicitly mention a pregnant point: governments that control their own currency can inflate their way out of debt. That is not financial minutia. It is a power that many in governments in Lisbon, Madrid, Dublin, and Athens likely miss dearly.
I wonder how long until they give up on that lettering system (aaaaaaa, bbbbbbb, ...) and just switch to spreadsheet-style lettering (fa, fb, ..., ga, ..., ).
Damn that's something I might not have known, cool.
Talk about a raw deal.
In only 500 years, someone might find the United States national debt interesting.
I thought this was Edd China's channel.
This is the sort of stuff i like to see trending on YouTube.
Britain has been sending a bill to the U.S. every year since 1773 for the tea that we threw into the harbor. Every year we disregard it and don’t pay it off
It may be the epitome of boredom to watch paint dry, but perhaps it would be less boring if it were drying for over 350 years.
Ok can we do this with national debt but forever?
Tom, you are close to 1,000,000 subscribers. With videos like this, you deserve every single one. Well done, Tom. Keep the great videos coming.
These are the things I'd be willing to pay for. That's just funny.
The name's bond. Government bond.
Does anyone reckon Tom Scott is obsessed with himself? Just go onto his YouTube channel page and count how many times you can see his face. Its actually quite disturbing.
I counted the singular or plural version of the word 'bond' 21 times in 3 minutes and 57 seconds.
Why won't the US government define that this paper doesn't have relevance anymore and the debt is considered paid already?
Next week on can't pay? We'll take it away!...
hehehe lovely... i used to swim and ride bike around that area
Haven't watched this yet: Is this Brittain's debt incurred through Mr. Blunt's South Sea Company?
Imagine if the Darian loans needed to be paid back with interest?
I feel like I just had a stroke and lost my ability to understand what's being said. Confusing video.
But can it be hacked?
Things like this are not as funny as you might imagine - they provide legal example and precedent for much more odious debt all over the world via US Trade Agreements, and Harvard are leading cheerleaders this nasty endeavor.
What's the part that says w w w w x x x x?
I was worried, until he said the bond pays $13 per year.\nThen it is just goodwill thing.\nThank You for sharing.
No Thames bond but there is a British consol (perpetual bond) that was issued to pay for war expenses during WWI and also some from the South Sea Bubble of 1720 that still pay regular interest. They are often mentioned in finance classes as they are a special case of present value calculations. When I was at MSU in the 1970's one of my Finance professors had a French Consol that had been issued to help Napoleon pay for his wars. Not sure if it was still paying interest or not.
So it's a kind of pond bond?
Dutch water authority goes to the bank We need a loan Have you taken out any loans in the past Well let me tell you a story...
I saw the 12th of January and thought ooh my birthday time to click 😂.
hey guys does anybody knows what is the video where tom talks about trumps winning elections (he said something about talking the elephant in the room i think)
If I saw Tom I would hug him so hardly <3
Will they cash in the bond?
All the old timers talk about inflation this, inflation that:  back in my day a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread cost me 5 cents So why did this bearer bond/perpetual bond never rise according to inflation?
When are they next paying. I wanna go. Let's have a party.
Yale has never had a problem propagating fraudulent legal contracts. It's the only way the truly useless in our society can feel as if they are contributing.
Why didn't they pay it all off ages ago, surely it's a lot more expensive to keep paying interest off forever?
The name is bond, James bond.
I love videos like this
I was expecting the bond to be worth millions 😂
Why was the interest payment lowered? Was it by the payer or the payee who decided that?
Is it still possible to trick someone into signing a perpetual bond?
While in New Haven, I hope you were able to take advantage of timing to learn about the City's green.  I sent you an email on it a while back.  Intriguing ownership and management of a public space. - and a neat place for a park bench episode.
Idk who this guy is but he looks like Jenna marbles on the thumbnail
plot twist. they pay interest for a Jew Banker
Is this guy 30 or 60 I'm not sure
This is why in the Abrahamic religion God forbade interest because it is an evil practice. The Jews came changed that all around and now it so wide spread in all its evil corrupt glory.
Nice Passive Income.
so cool
Usury?
11 euros
Haha what a trip!

Are levies related to levees?
what is your obsession with red shirts?
god, capitalism is so stupid
I love his voice.. it sounds like a young pre-puberty virgin boys voice which is so innocent to listen too...
Good thing it wasn't compound interest. The Dutch government would go bankrupt.

*THUMBS UP IF THE WATER MOMENT HAS YOU SHOOKETH!!!* 😱🌏✨
“Where was it this whole time? In high school, in PE” \nMe: 😂😂😂
OMG I love your videos!!!  Could you do a makeup collection video? Where you show all of your makeup? xx
You think I have time for ads
Your hilarious babe, i love watching your video's ... keep doing you babe
i wanna see a video that you clean these brows with other cleanning products other than its self's
hey im new on youtube it would mean so much if you could check us out!! x
I wish they had black, i can't do brown eyebrows
You are just too darn cute.
Where was this product during high school in P.E. \n\n\nP.E.? Guuuuuurl, who you fooling.
Did anyone find out what gloss she’s wearing???
I think you look amazing with warmer brows
What brow brush does she use? X
its looking a little smooshy gushy wooshy- me looking in the mirror after bottomless sushi
What’s on her lips while she’s applying it?!
can you Please do a review on Oval Brushes pleaseeeeeee. 😊😊😊😭😭😭😭
That happened to me on a first date I was terrified to even look in the mirror to find my eyebrow all smeared
⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️😂😂😂😂I can't breathe! Thank you for making my night
Hahahaha I died at the part where you spray your face and hold the paper towel to your brows 😂😂 omg though! I NEED THIS! How did it hold up when/if your face got oily?! Love you Nikkie!!💕
PLEASE TRY THE BROW-NIES FROM BEAUTY BAKERIE
U have to use this for a whole hot test day and let us know!!!
This girl is inbred and has downs
I love you so much but your lips are fucked!!!  SHTOP!!!
I wear this when I go swimming
I have really no eyebrows. There is almost nothing. I love these product. You have to practice a little bit and than Boom perfect brows. Wunderschöne Grüße from Germany.
You should purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka
Can't stop looking at the greasy hair....
When that i-question popped out, I was like Gurl, be ready to be amazed! LOL
She transformed it so well!😍
Okay Nikki I'm gonna need another, take her swimming on the first date video ft. This product and actually testing the products by the pool cause that would be amazing
You crack me up...my eyebrows are same...mine didn't survive the great plucking of the 80's LOL
I use this stuff it's legit. It doesn't get off even after taking a shower.
I swear if she didn't have the camera on she was going to scream from how excited she was 😂😂. But it was cute seeing how happy she was. I love her so much. ❤❤💋
Wunderbrow is all I use now! I love the product ❤
you compared it to a long lost child 😂😂😂😂 i’m so dead Nikkie you’re hilarious!
The way she pressed the paper towel onto her eyebrows 😂
I would love to start doing make up videos like these except drug store make up but i would never know where  to start! Love your videos!
okay but how expensive is this product
I only use powder and mascara so I only watch Nikkie to see her reactions and listen to her 😂 I loved this video so much
1. Why is this on trending 2. Lose some fuckin weight
You should do a MUFE Aqua Brow tutorial. Shade #10 is cool toned and it would match you better. It's also a WAY easier formula to work with.
Yay I actually have something that Nikki doesn’t! I absolutely love the wonder brow! I would always use the wonder brow on vacation
You look like a big fish in your thumbnail😂😂😂😂
Omg!!! You reaction is everything you don't have to work about people touching your brows now .
WOW. THanks! NEVER would have believed it.
where do I get this?
It comes out with Vaseline ,or any kind of oil.🌺🌸🌼
days?! honey no you gotta take ya make up off at night LMAO
I showed this video to my mom and she has a similar brow type to you and she was SUPER impressed, lol usually she’s super finicky and picky and doesn’t like makeup very much.  I also have similarly sparse non-existent brows like my hairs are black but they look more grey.  Really appreciate this review.
PLEASE PLEASE DO A CUTE BUNNY LOOK FOR HALLOWEEN!!  LOVE YOU!!
I did not like the brow product
Nikki is the epitome of shook in this video
Love this product so stoked you tried this!!!
Damn you look so different without makeup, this is why you take a girl swimming on a first date so they can't hide that spooky face
I love you so much!!
Where do I get it from?
I've been using Wunderbrow for about a year now. It basically IS my eyebrows. I keep it one for two weeks at a time, touching it up in the morning.
WHAT GLOSS IS THIS I NEED!!!!
I tried it and didn't care for it!
This is the time to day eyebrows on fleek....DOES ANYONE SAY THAT ANYMORE?!
y’all i tried this on my hand a few weeks ago and i had an eyebrow on my hand for a week.. i scrubbed and scrubbed.
Cool video.   Tonight at midnight debuting new episode of Homeless Teddy.
The NYX brow gel ($7) is THE BEST!! it's waterproof, easy to work with and doesn't budge! It's hands down the best drugstore eyebrow product
Hey, I use wunder brow too and It takes a few tries to get a hand of how to work with it (get more natural looking brows) my eyebrow hairs are basically non existent and this is a life saver !🙌🏼 I have my routine down to where I can do my brows in under 5 minutes with concealing or anything
My uncle owns the company who makes that product....🤔
Loved this video. Nikkie is so funny.
Nikki is so beautiful with and without makeup
Do u just use makeup remover to get it off or what lol
New follower! Excited to see more of your videos!
You are so cute!
I tried wunderbrow before .. hate it ! But I love you and I’m totally subscribing to your channel ❤️
You don’t think the product felt heavy and crusty on your eyebrows?
What lip gloss is she wearing?

I keep looking at her lipgloss 😂😇
Where was this product during high school in P.E? \n\n\nSame girl.
Try https://www.audible.com/numberphile and check out The Mathematics of Love by Hannah Fry\n\nEnvy free cake cutting (the paper mentioned): https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03655 --- A clarifying note from Hannah: n^n^n^n^n^n is the *maximum* number of cuts in the n person case.
Guys, for the love of everything holy. PLEASE DO A VIDEO ON TREE(3). I'm so confused by it, because it's supposed to be a finite number unimaginably bigger than Graham's Number, yet it's described and calculated by ordinal notation apparently? I'm no mathematician, but I'm doing my best to teach myself. I need answers.
Cut the cake in half and the person that cries is the real mother and gets to keep the cake...
i'm a bit disapointed, i thought you were going to solve the 1/3 = 0.3333333 etc problem.\ni thought you were actualy going to divide that cake into exactly 3 equal parts
How to thoroughly butcher a cake.
Haha the flashback to when Bob chose his favorint piece.
The one who gets the biggest slice is the guy with the knife!\n\nIf you want people to share their food, everyone needs a knife right from the start. You can't just give your vote to a billionaire, put him in the White House and expect him to cut taxes fairly.\n🗡🎃🎂
But what if the second person agrees that all three pieces are equal? Then he wouldn't be able to choose any two pieces as bigger, and by cutting any piece further he'd be making it smaller than the others.
Just cut it in 4 and then cut one slice in 3 and give one slice of the three that are not cut to each and give one of the 3 smaller pieces to each. Done.
Cut it into 6 pieces give each person 2.
I would DEFINITELY have Hannah pour honey to my ears
why is it that every participant is able to perfectly cut a cake into pieces they themselves consider fair, but at the same time, are unable to cut them precisely into equally sizes pieces?\n\nthis is how i imagine it:\nmoderator: alice, cut it!\n*alice cuts*\nalice: oops, this one got too big. can i have a new cake?\nmoderator: no, you like all the pieces equally, as agreed upon in advance!\n*game continues, in the end nobody is satisfied*
Just cut the cake evenly in the first place, this is absurd.
I'd say give each a knife and the fittest survive..
Video should have clarified difference between envy-free (I don't think anyone got more than me) and proportionally fair solution (I think I got at least 1/n of the cake). Because later can be achieved with way simpler algorithms in way fewer cuts. For n = 3, e.g. Alice cuts in half, Bob picks bigger half. Then both cut their piece into 3 parts. Charlie picks biggest from both Alice and Bob. Each participant can't believe they got less than 1/3, even if they think someone else got an unfair cut. For most practical applications, including actually cutting the cake, that's more than sufficient. But yeah, there are cases where true envy-free solution is desired.
Cut as far as the centre of the cake, then cut two more at 45 degree angles symmetrically opposite to each other. Three equal pieces.
Hannah is always a delight. I really enjoyed the Mathematics of Love, it's a great book (and listen!)
Charlie was actually pissed cuz he had to go last due to white privilege
Why not just cut it into sixths and give each person two pieces?
But this is not really true though is it? It hinges on the idea that the first person can cut a cake in 3 parts that they'd equally like. But the whole reason for this being a problem is that people have great difficulty cutting a cake into 3 parts. So that first person that cuts the cake will not actually be happy with all 3 pieces, even though you assume that in step 1.
That's why we have cupcakes
If you're trying to be fair, give 1/2 to Charlie, and 1/4 to the Bob and Alice. Charlie faces systematic oppression because he's a negro, so he needs affirmative cake allocation to make it equal.
Just cut it in 6 pieces, and each gets 2.\nLiterally not that difficult.
What if Charlie likes the piece Alice chose?
How bout just be a grown up and eat cake like a functional human!.... or butcher the thing while you act like a seven year old i dont care....
What actual application does this knowledge have? Because if someone is enough of an asshole to make you do this, they are not your friend and you shouldn't share your cake with them.
A simpler solution would be proposed by my ex: Do you want some cake or not? Shut up and eat what you're given.
What is this area of mathmatics called? Game theory?
I would rather just go wild with a knife and reduce it to monogenuous pile of crumbs and then divide it. If you dont like how I cut it -  we all are gonna eat crumbs.
Can't you just cut it into sixths and have everyone take one slice and the slice opposite the one they chose?\nI'm pretty sure that results in everyone getting equal amounts of cake for everyone.  Also is a lot simpler.
If you take the radius of the circle and walking around the edges as a cord length it will divide a circle into six segments. There’s are equally divided cake no questions at all
Too complicated! It is much easy to find another person and share the cake between four people =)
Are two pieces of pie called _a piece of tau?_
If this was the decided on method of fair cake distribution, I can only imagine some of the rejected ideas... Okay, okay listen... First we're gonna put the whole cake in a blender. We are going to liquefy it, and then pour the cake into 3 equal cups by volume, and share it that way.. It's fair, and easy.
Kids! Get what they are given!
Wtf am I watching and how did I get here
this applies to doing drugs without weigh scales too
they spent more time dividing than cooking
Great video! Cake-cutting is such a nice problem!\n\nNote though that the method presented is NOT the envy-free Selfridge Conway method.\nIn the Selfridge-Conway method, it is the trimmer Bob that should cut the trim and pick last.\n\nIn particular, the method presented here seems proportionally fair but not envy-free. \nIndeed, while Alice got an extra bit, so did Bob, especially if Bob first got an untrimmed piece.\nThis means that, in the end, Alice still might envy Bob's share.\n\nMore details in the Quanta Magazine article How to Cut Cake Fairly and Finally Eat It Too.
when you put one fatass into the mix, it wont work like this
I'll go with cupcakes instead.
or you could just cut it in 3 120° degree slices
Wouldn't it be easier to cut it in half three times? Then everyone gets two, everyone votes on the best, through worst. One gets 1,6 two gets 2,5 three gets 3,4
I hope that this cake-video don't get as freebooted as the last one you made.
Simple version: Each person does 1 slice sequentially.  Person 1, then person 2, then person 3.  Next, they get to choose any slice they want, but must do it sequentially in the same order as the slicing.  Then everyone will get an equal amount and everyone will be happy.  \n\nAssumptions: \n(1) Participants know how many slices need to be made.\n(2) Participants can make perfect cuts. \n(3) All participants want the biggest slice possible.
I didn't know Cersei was a mathematician
I didn't read all the comments but surely someone posted:  THE CAKE IS A LIE!!!
What is this, a Weight Watchers party?
I believe the word in English is among.  Between refers to two reference points.
I am an adult. I just buy myself a cake for myself.
The accent at 3:00 was A1 and funny af
Cut it in 6 parts and give each two.. very easy.
Or you could use a compass.
All you're doing is ruining the cake. :(
Umm!!!find the center. Pretend it's a clock. Cut from center to 12o'clock. Then cut from center to 4o'clock, and from center to 8 o'clock
The scientists at numberphile did it again. They engineered the perfect way to cut a cake. Quick, someone call the today show.
Say the cake was pre-cut. Tell me how to decide the price of each piece when participants value the pieces differently.
i thought charlie would get 3/5ths of a cake.
why doesn't the second person just cut the trimming from his favourite piece cake and put it at the second piece cake so it's equal and you won't have any leftover trimmings so the last few steps can be skipped if you know what I mean
The solution is simple. Buy a cake for each person. BOOM
Seriously, is this what's considered to be fun in Narnia? You sound as if you're from Narnia.
why don't you cut it in half three times at 120° difference between each cut? makes six even pieces, and everyone gets 2 slices
My goodness...this is not rocket science.
Or take a lawnmower and drive it over the cake as a punishment of being envious
Yeah but now you have all these pieces of cake with crumbly bits. Who wants that? 😂
If it has fruit, it's not a cake. It's something British people eat.
This is why I don’t like cake
Why isn't the bit that is trimmed cut up and shared as the whole cake was? If that is the ideal way to split something three ways surely that applies to the trimming. Because you're just starting again with a much smaller cake. \n\nWhat am I missing?
Just divide the cake into infinity slices, and everyone can just take as many slices as they can count.
There are several ways to do this better using math. Like cut it into 6ths.
What if someone prefers to have his share intact in one piece?
I have a much neater solution (not sure if it is as rigorous).  The cake will be cut into sixths, with each cut being a straight line from one side of the cake to the other.\n1. Alice cuts the cake in half.\n2. Bob makes the second cut at an angle to the first cut to produce two sixth slices cut from either half.\n3. Charlie decides if he wants to take these two sixths as his share.  If he does not they are Bobs.\n4. Alice makes the third cut, cutting what remains in half.\n5. Whichever one of Bob or Charlie is yet to get their cake chooses a half to take*.\n6. Alice gets the remaining two sixths.\n\n* They must take either half as divided by the third cut, they cannot take one sixth from one side and another sixth from the other side, as the first two cuts may have been imprecise and made it impossible to cut the remainder into four equal slices in one cut.
Sheesh just weigh out the pieces on a scale until everyone has the same weight of cake.
Fair? Perhaps. Equal? Nope, there's no proof that each person gets the same amount, they only perceive that they're getting their fair share or more.
Liberal way of cutting cake
So, no one is cutting the cake in concentric circles, each of equal mass?
Okay here's the revised version cut it in for everyone shares equally the extra piece throw it away but before you throw it away put it in your mouth
This is why in the house of every mathematicians the cake plates have a full-circle protractor.  =D
just cut the cake in a horizontal way... right?
Wouldn't it be better to cut it into 6ths then each person gets to select 2 pieces.... 1, 2, 3 get to select, then 3, 2, 1. Everyone gets an average choice that way.
But will this work if two people are secretly conspiring to deprive the third of their fair share?
Or cut it in 6 pieces and get 2 each
Real people will still perhaps have envy, because real people are not always rational or consistent.
Alice,  Bob, and Charlie won't be happy for very long ... after they realize I stuffed their cake full of horse laxatives!
Just give that trimmed to the smallest
why would i share my cake???? \n\n\n\n\nand i have  no friends.
What regional British accent is this? It's so sexy
A whole book of Hannah Fry talking?  It's ASMR heaven!
Remind me to slap the people who didn't knew this
Seems based alot of subjective obsevation

very interesting, thank you for the video!
mfw my top speed was 38 km/h on a fire road and i almost shat myself with a 40 cm drop \nಥ_ಥ
I'm scared when I hit 40 mph on my roadie. Couldn't imagine doing that on a mountain bike off road
That is insane.
Did Blake ride this trail?
Your beard = super nice

I like the way he says here.
Where's the sweet spot 😂
Blake looks a bit like Charlie Hunnam in this video. That course is insane.
Wow, even bigger then I imagined!  Blake needs to hit that
please forgive my ignorance but what exactly is red bull hardline? is it like red bull rampage?
That's insane! I love videos like this
I went 45mph on my road bike, and when I became conscious of just how fast I was going, and really felt the way my bike was controlling, I felt my stomach drop and became hyperaware of everything.  To think that I would hit a 45ft gap after obtaining that kind of speed makes my knees shake just thinking about it.
Yeah! Was looking forward to this video from GMBN!
Gwin did not have an invite eh?
He said big 10 times, and he said huge 5 times
Where  can I get one of those coats
Is Blake gonna send it?
Wow you should do more like This it was very interesting to watch
a few extra feet could be added to the measurements to account for the arch of most of the jumps too
Do a video like this at Rampage!
40 MPH on an MTB. What the heck!? Insane.

Come give our edits a watch any constructive criticism would be really appreciated, want to hear what we can do to make our stuff better!!
Would any of you GMBN guys have the bottle to hit any of those features?
Speed gun and tape measure at redbull rampage
I stay Up to 3am Singapore Time Just To watch GMBN Videos When They Get Released
Excellent edit! And thank you for the metric values!
*Rob Warner voice*WHAT 2 GMBN VIDEOS ARE ON TRENDING OH MY GOD
Hey please keep reading!!!//    I quit YouTube last year and decided to come back  I posted my fitst video back 2 days and need feedback on how it is (if anyone is willing to check it out wil mean alot to me 👐🏼😴) thanks
Bike vault photo in the making at 6:19, love it
wow... im humbled ... i dont think i could hit ANY of that!
Nope... Nope and more Nope.  The fact that so few riders even make final due to injury on the course shows how hard it is.   Anyone who gets down in one piece - especially given it was wet this year - is a bloody hero IMO.
And Adam Brayton rips a tear-off off his goggles mid-air into dirty ferns\n\nThat is even more impressive!
and this kids, is when you need math to know how far the landing is, simple pythagoras.... 5:10
Remember back in the day doing 8' drops and thinking we were champs! This is just mad!
Awe where was my shout out for making you a brew at the top?!!!
you need someone at rampage this year
Another great video. Now Blake should shred it!!!!!!!
#askgmbn I want to ride megavalance next year but I'm not sure if i should ride with flat or clipless pedals
Getting a ton of merch for Christmas
Did they skip that huge drop during race? I can't spot it in winner's POV video.
Blake, are you going to do a claudio caluori of the track in your next vid? lol
I really wanna see the bing bong shreds this trail.\nI know you capable doing this..
I love the concept of this video, it really shows how crazy big those fearures are
I thought this video was sick
Blake could hit those gaps and drops for sure. And I guess he should ride there too.
I died as blake said sayonara and dropped the tape!
Impressive...and insane. Thank you for the metric values!
So basically all the features can be rounded off to 50 ft, that is insane!
really like this type of video would like see it with some more tracks
#20 on trending how many more videos can you get on trending
I hoped Blake would take part at Hardline :(
Wow if u just watch the POV or on RB TV u really don't realise how big this stuff is! \nReally cool vid!!!
Man I would love to see Sam Hill ride Hard Line, I think he would smash it!
please continue this series!!!
Are you going to ride it
Make more videos  like this pls. Btw your videos are raaaaad
When last year I said one of the presenters should have a go, Scotty said he would like to have a go. He really dodged that one by leaving GMBN ey ;p
exactly what i was looking for!
holy cow. on video it doesn't really do justice to how big those jumps are
the kicker in redbull district is 14 foot and like 50 foot gap so it would be interesting to see what speed they are going at
#askGMBN Has Blake dyed his hair 😂
Red Bull Hardline 2018 Blake?
Your R sound is coming along nicely, dude.\nLol, such a chiller, love this guy.
This is trending ?
4:45 thank me later
Hey Blake do you think you could survive it? Just curious
Has the winner been announced for the Park tool  Pk-2 Professional Tool  Kit  @Global Mountain Bike Network
But could/would you ride it blake/scott/Neil ?
were speeds measured in mph or km/h?
What is the location of this track ? I wanna ride there 😀
Did you try any features, Blake?
Sarah has so much joy in her... it' s contagious!
I can smell the pheromones from here! ;P lol 50 does look good though!
Whoopi looks good
anyone know what the 50 song playing in the beginning is?
That's a new song 50 walked out to
*trump* was the president by accident
... And u r a daddy... Hahaha yes he is
Looks nice in the suit
Veterans have fought among other things, so people can peacefully protest, so stop using them as an excuse for your bigotry and ignorance, most of them are happy to witness their purpose. #vetsforequality
Legend fitttyyyyyyyyy
been a fan of 50 for over 15 years yet always feels like im tryna solve a riddle listening to him
The View should invite some average American's on their show. Average Americans that work 40 hours a week for an annual salary of $40,000, that have a family and live in a 3 bedroom ranch home. Nothing against the Hollywood Elite, but it would be interesting to get a different opinion from a different type of person. It would make sense wouldn't it??
Viewers have all of the power
don't look in 50s eyes, he'll charm you
He didn't really say anything poignant abt the kneeling🙄 what a waste of a platform😒
Awe! I want a hug!
You're a good hugger lmao i love sara so much
What's the name of that 50 cent song playin at the beginning?
That blonde lady wants some of 50 for sure..that body language and flushed face 😷😷😷😷
This was a great segment with 50 and the ladies!
The bum. in chief,  sounds great,lol
What's the intro song called
50 cent still looks the same after these years
50 cent was one of all time best rappers. from the 00s. one of my favorites.
Just goes to show you, you can be a billionaire and a president and YET still be a big fat BUM!
Come on, Sunny!  What was the point of your question about Power, other than spoiling a major plot point from the finale?  That was a really dumb question that was super unnecessary.  I understand that the season ended a couple weeks ago, but there is a way to ask a question like that without naming the character or at least ask something interesting like how will that impact the characters and have you already starting working on the scripts for next season instead of asking if your going to bring the character back from the dead.  You're smarter than that girl!
I think we should get rid of poopie Goldberg and 0 cents.
50 just naturally smells good...bet that hug felt GOOD!
50 still look good
If Trump is so sensitive about the Flag:\n\n--Why does Trump not show his tax returns of he is so devoted to the flag and America?  I mean he loves the flag and the country that deeply,  why not be open with the American public like all former Presidents did.\n\n--Why did Trump insult so many people under the American Flag, including veterans? \n\n--Why are so many in the Trump cabinet associated with Russia, if he loves the Flag and the country that much?\n\n--Why did Trump defend the KKK and neo-Nazi who he called  very fine people, while  they killed a woman and attacked clergies, the folks who defended the confederacy (traitors to America) and the confederacy flag (a flag appose to the American flag)? Yet, at the same time he was outraged about Anti Fascists (abolitionists). And he doubled down on them!\n\n--Why is Trump so concerned with a entertainment game?  And not with the 900.000 false arrested black lives that were made between 2007 and 2015 by NYPD? Or the 50% of exonerated black lives, because of false incarceration? Or the almost 90% of clearances of black lives in FBI stats? \n\nAll this happens under the American Flag. \n\n--Why is he not as concerned with the 3 million Americans at Puerto Rico who are without water and electricity, but instead spends his weekend tweeting about athletes who exercise their right???
the king
Hi Tiff, Hi 50
No doubt.
...if I was the president by accident...\n\nSee, I'll ALWAYS believe Trump wasn't serious when he ran and he didn't think he'd get voted in (by electoral college).\n\nRepublicans f*cked up big time.
does any know what song he walked out too
Name of the song at the beginin'
does anyone think that 50 looks like Matt Damon?
50 cent would make a good/better President....
Blondie wants that BBC.  Peep the body language 👀 🍫 🍆 her panties filled with lust 💦💦 #forbiddenfruit
Does anybody know what kind of training watch Sarah has on?
What song is at the beginning?
HEY WHOOPI I HEARD A GREAT MINISTER FROM MOBILE ALABAMA CALL HIM #45...THAT WAY WE ALL CAN CALL HIM HOW WE FEEL ABOUT HIM ..AFTER 45 COMES 46👊👊👊
50 must smell really good because this is not the first time I have seen talk shows comment on the way he smells. A few years ago Kelly ripa and mark consuelos started their interview with the way he smelt very good.
shame on the women of the view. he is a misogynist, ignorant bully. how could u have him on your show? he repeatedly disrespects women.
Real life fiddy is cool, social media fiddy is a troll.
they all got moist from that hug... except for whoopi
I'm the 1 these b!tches wantI be keeping the dough Coming in coming in coming inI'm on to something!!!
where were y'all when Obama signed the ndaa
I love 50. xoxo
This got me thinking: Are there things that I don’t like about America? Yes. Quite a few, in fact. Violence against the unborn, the highest violent crime rate in the industrialized world, sordid social agendas, the destruction of the family, high taxes and a creeping socialism are all high on my list. With these things in mind, perhaps I should take a knee, too? Maybe you have your own list of things you don’t like about America. Shall we all kneel and stick it to the man, as they say?No.The national anthem is about unity, not division. Think on the words. They tell of a perilous night through which a battle raged. Our nation was on the brink of extinction. When dawn finally came, the sun shone brightly on our tattered flag, giving proof to the fact that we had, indeed, survived as a nation. The story appeals to our better selves by reminding us that we are a people who unite and persevere through troubled times.By contrast, not only does Colin Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the national anthem do nothing to advance the cause he advocates, it further divides an already deeply divided nation by unnecessarily offending and alienating people who are in no way guilty of the offenses he decries.
what was the song he came out to
#bringbackjed
VIEWERS HAVE POWER: We want JED back! Like if you agree.
#BoycottNFL
When fiddy smile, I smile :)
We want JED BACK!
Sunny says you smell really good! Hahaha
Whoopi just called out ABC.
Is it just me, or does it seizes up at 6:51 what gives?
Where's Ja?
WHOOPI STOP CALLING THE PRESIDENT NAMES. YOU SAIS IT YOURSELF TO MIKE HUCKABEE AFTER HE APPEARED ON THE VIEW. HYPOCRITE
That blonde is soaking the ground while 50s there.
✨ 50 CENT FOR PRESIDENT! 🇺🇸💫
Shade @ ABC for getting rid of Jed. \nBring back Jed!!
these sports stars are black billionaires in a ''white racist country'' lolol the teams are from Liberia surely\nwe all have slaves - i have 14 slaves they live in india and china they pick tea and coffee and spices :( \nhttp://slaveryfootprint.org/survey/#where_do_you_live\nwhoopi as a rich american how many slaves do you have - maybe i will do a survey for you - i reckon you would have about 150 slaves working for you WITHOUT you knowing or caring
50 and diddy aspire to be like trump but because these networks hate trump they have to go along with it.
Lol, isn't 50 cent bankrupt?
Ask an ape a serious question, and you get an ape level answer.
50 cent has definitely lost his street cred!  Can't believe he's on this show with these moaning, whiny hags.
The view sucks. So do it's followers. You're all retards.
first thing that comes to my mind...you sure is ugly
So now the view has only one view....they call the President a bum....but we couldn't even mention anything about Obama.....that would have been racist, but when a black woman says things like Wooppie does it OK and not racist.....really ?
PolitiFact :Joy Behar: 95 percent of what {Donald Trump] says is a is a lie  FALSE.          We need Facts...No??                                     CP
I wanna impregnate the broad on the far right.
This guy can't talk without smiling.
what a miserable bunch of cunts
Fuk you View ,i was in the Vietnam war and lost 2 Brothers, to the war , so leave the FLAG LONE
this show has rea ched the ultimate in boredom and one dimension
he worried about peaceful protest, celebrity apprentice is real without camera
Get rid of 50 cent! It's only 50 cents!
One ugly dude. Close your mouth
King of entertainment
So we're just gonna ignore the fact that 50 has publicly denouced his other son?
50 shouldn't be talking bout father hood when he not a father to his oldest
6:50 SPOILER WARNING!
Thought he went broke!
50 cent I'd duuuuuummmmmbbbbbb!
This is such a stupid protest i swear to God what is wrong with you people?
50 aint got no eyebrows
WAYMENT, did he just say, President by acciden? LOL! KMSL! That was so funny! THANKS FIDDY! I needed that!
Why l dont like blacks
The players that take a knee shouldn't be played - the NFL ratings have gone down - over 700 black people were killed last year by other black people however only 16 unarmed black people were killed by cops
Jed is way to good for these poor excuses for women. Angry and so unkind.
lol 50 fifty tweets and says the same dumb things as the president. so...not sure why everyone is clapping for him.
How American is protesting the flag and National anthem when American veterans fought for our freedom overseas and come home to see  their efforts were not appreciated by NFL players who make a ton of money and who were never in the military? It must be sickening to thousands and thousands of veterans and  American soldiers around the world who PLEDGED their allegiance to America and gave an oath to protect that Flag and the people of USA. These NFL players and followers who kneel and don't  honor our National anthem are not seeing the  real picture.  This isn't the 68 Olympics, that's all done and gone. There's more opportunity  in America for  blacks than anywhere else.  Trump is right again!  His comments were not about race.  It's about respect  for our country.  So fire these NFL cowards and get'em off the field!\nShow less\nREPLY
A little troubling that his son colored 50 with white skin :/
50 reminds me of trump
Having Respect in this country is so important. This is so disrespectful to the families that had their father's and mothers killed in the line of duty. If you do not like American. You have options to leave. If you ever traveled to another country. We are so blessed to have what we have. Spend time in another country and look around and see. Thank you for reading!
Black people do not smell so well when burned and hanging from trees in the Southern United States.
what does this guy do anyway?
Good to see Louis making more documentaries
Louis Theroux is back!!! Aroused! and leaking at the tip!
THE DARK SIDE OF AMERICA\n\nit's ok you can say black people

Louis is the type of guy who could bring the peace between n korea and the states 😂
Looking forward to this new series.

thumbs down to those who didnt smile after watching this......
Im a united fan but youtube bought me here ... fab video, great stuff from klopp, a very genuine hug from gini and what a brilliant charity
This has genuinely warmed my heart! Can not believe that there are people out there who have disliked this video!!
Make my wish come through and stop wasting chances to score. Fucking head wreckers to watch
i wish klopp would have a shave and brush his teeth...
*Get that kid a free season ticket in the kop end this is the kind support we need in the stadium not the mumbling cunts*
I'm not crying. You're crying
I thought the Proclaimers were Hibs fans?
People who disliked this video should honestly be ashamed of themselves 😔😔😔
Jürgen Klopp is genuinely the most amazing person and leader for Liverpool. He loves the club and should be backed 100%.
I was feeling really miserable today but this has really cheared me up and made me feel warm inside.
Ahhh, bought a tear to my eye 😊
make a wish great initiative
Who's the cunts giving this a thumbs down? Love Klopp! YNWA Loyd
Love this, shows you the true power of football and how it changes peoples life`s. It heals and empowers us.  I`m not even a Liverpool fan in fact I`m a United supporter but that doesn't matter, moments like this matter and need to happen more.
Love klopp what a hero (united fan)
I love this man ❤
This is what football is about respect. Klopp your a true gentleman. Well done to Liverpool F.C. #YNWA
I'm so sad for the kid when klop get the sack 🤧
O my god when he sang YNWA that was amazing
Quite a lot of people tryna press pause while the screen rotates... only reason I can think of for any dislikes!
This is what makes Jurgen so special he is the normal one and we love him to bits. So glad he is at our great club and hope he stays for a very long time.
All who call for klopps head should watch this video
Amazing how Liverpool will do this for someone with a disability
The best Coach
It Puts things into perspective, Cmon yer Reds!

Our Club is exceptionally special.
This is why I always loved klopp. He's such a kind and warm  hearted person.
Can he play centre half?
What a gentle man! #Klopp.. Good initiative Make-A-Wish! All the best wishes..
Looking at the screen made me smile
What a man Klopp is. Always happy around the fans, although I do disagree with his role model comment... he's a perfect role model!!
Just watched this, the video on the up next is Klopp learning scouse off a young Liverpool fan. This is a rare manager that really reaches out to the fans
This one of the best videos ever! It makes me feel all warm inside this is why we love liverpool!
Moments like this man give me a very happy feeling. Look at the LFC family.
Bring my tears down in every single moments in this short clip
Who hates Liverpool. Me
Love this lads. Buzzing for the match tonight!!
Massive respect for Loyd and Klopp, this is why I love LFC,\nSuch an amazing club.\nCouldn't help but just be happy for Loyd :D
Lloyd is a true baller
Quality stuff this from the club and jurgen #YNWA

Gini comes across as the nicest man on the planet!
This is what YNWA means to me... Loyd will never forget this Class all around... YNWA
the look on ginis face when he hugs Loyd :) <3
how can anyone dislike this
How the f*ck can you dislike this video? What's wrong with you people?
Man, this brought tears to my eyes. What a class act from Klopp and the club. I hope we beat Spartak tonight so Loyd will have a good reason to celebrate and shake that tambourine. 😊
.
That was amazing 👍❤

Dis nigga wouldn't survive in game of thrones
Hook and loop - 3 syllables\nVelcro - 2 syllables\n\nSorry, sticking with what's easier to say.
You are only *just now* making an effort to keep people from using Velcro as a generic word? Probably a little too late.
I didn't even know Velcro was an actual brand till now.
Funny video but I'm still gonna call it velcro lmfao
I'm still going to call it Velcro. And if that makes you cry, grab a Kleenex.\n\nNow where did I put my Vaseline...?
yeah good luck with that.  talk to Xerox
This video is clearly meant to be humorous and tongue-in-cheek. Nobody at Velcro thinks this video is going to change people's vocabulary.
It's funny I haven't seen Hoover make sarcastic youtube videos.
This is hilarious. I had to check to be sure, but I'll tell my customers we sell Velcro brand hook & loop. Or just Velcro for short.
That's just glorious. Thanks for the link, Reddit.
velcro sounds better
Get better at marketing then??
VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO VELCRO
Not only will I continue to call it velcro, but this song has further persuaded me to purchase non Velcro branded velcro.
I love VELCRO® Brand hook and loop.
How to backfire, John Oliver Style.
Not sure why everyone is so butt hurt. This is a clever and creative video with a hilarious message. I dig it.
The sneaker heads will be like\nAhhh he got the hook and loop\n\nSorry guys. Doesn't work.
My Velcro didn't hold up now I have to get some Kleenex and Clorox to clean the spill and probably use some Germ X after.
This is like trying to tell me Plato isn't a planet.
this was actually fun
lol this marketing is actually pretty good, it's just a hit or miss thing, next time just get a few bots to get that initial positive reaction so the community follows. or u know, hire me.\nanyway, peace.
I wanna work there
It's too late. Velcro is already common parlance for that type of fastener. Just like band-aid, and kleenex are common parlance now. Give it up. And no one cares if your trademark goes away.
Comments are full of idiots who don't understand satire.
I'm calling it velcro anyway just out of spite. That way, your trademark with dissipate as it becomes common name. Just like  all band aids are band aids, so now the brand has to call it band aid brand.
This is one of the best things I have seen all week. I will try very hard not to call it &*^!@# and share this to anyone who will watch it on ... that social media site.
Apparently people on YouTube are very bad at recognizing joke videos and picking up on when messages are tongue-in-cheek. How can you watch this and think Velcro is doing it in earnest?!
Hook and loop? Nah, velcro.
this is bad
overly expensive - generic velcro far more economical.
No.
should call it ssrrcccctttccchhhh one word and its the sound it makes
What if lawyers from companies all over just tried to get trademark laws changed to reflect the way that information spreads and adapts in a society with social media?\nThink it was bad before the internet?
Internet and people's mind 101: I don't tell people what you don't want them to do. Cause it's gonna be worst
I found this hilarious lol\nUnsuccessful.... but still very funny
It is like Band-Aid too
0% chance of hook and loop taking off, but a damn catchy song nonetheless.
I actually love this! and the song is so catchy!
Do people actually call bleach products Clorox? I've not heard it personally as common for bleach. The others? Sure
Tell that to Hoover. :-)
I can't tell if this is supposed to be funny. But with so much going on in the world, and the local all-news station deeming this important enough to mention, all I can say is: Boo-Hoo! What problems we rich folks have to contend with.
Velcro shoes is using it as an adjective, not a noun or verb. Editorial my friends, editorial.
Honestly you should called yourselves Hook and Loop so that you won't have to worry about that stuff
I didn't waste my time watching the whole vid , or reading all the comments, but didn't you 'lawyers' steal this song?
Can you guys just become a company that manufacturers music videos of interacial lawyers singing.
Okay okay I won't say it anymore!
ok i wont, do I get a cookie
Saying, velcro shoes places the word velcro as an adjective. It describes the type of shoes as a noun modifier.
It is and always will be velcro, no one would even know what I'm talking about if I said hook and loop get outta here.
Guts, it's obviously a joke, calm down
Redditor and legal enthusiast here (I once beat Phoenix Wright Ace Attourney). These lawyers are right, it's wrong to use VELCRO® as if it were a common word. Social Justice has taught me that cultural appropriation is very real and harms creators of that culture. Therefore, we are appropriating the company culture of Velcro Brand Companies when we use VELCRO® outside of its intended legal context. Please refrain from velcroing this video with your ignorance.\n~Bertie Gallagher, moderator of r/legaladvice and r/INTELLECTUALPROPERTY, IQ of 172
ok this was hilarious well done, from now on if i see it i'm saying  that fucking hook and loop
Ok i got go now lemme get my velcro shoes and my velcro wallet and my velcro socks and my velcro car and my velcro jacket
Working as an aircraft mechanic, EVERYONE in the industry will call it Velcro, so it a WAY to late to change the naming
No worries guys, nobody even heard of you in Poland, there won't be any infringement.
And if you make a mess using Hook and loop remember to hoover it all up.
Brilliant song, very catchy, well made point, very funny, and yet... it's still fucking velcro. The difference between Velcro (R) and velcro is the logo and the (R). If you didn't like it you shouldn't have waited 60 years to address the problem.
Sorry, no one is ever going to call it hook and loop. Thats just reality
sorry but your annoying bleep filled song isnt going to work. Its Velcro. Deal with it.
I suppose they want us to stop calling shirts with collars polos, referring to mopeds as vespas, and assuming all pregnancy pills are plan B also.
Inb4 video is deleted.  \n\nThis company that makes velcro has goofed up.
I think I've just been velcroed...
from the same people who brought you the yo yo and the slinky
Ok so wtf is up with this INSANE 90s NOSTALGIA CRAZE and NO ONE has brought back blading or even talked about it? MAKE AMERICA SKATE AGAIN
They are my velcro to the other velcro part....
I'm going to find some off-brand velcro, and just stick it to things. I may the Hoover up the mess, when that fails, i'll go Google the way to do it properly. We don't get to decide how the world uses words, stop being a cuck about it.
Velcro.
kys
Whatever the hell they were trying to do with this video, they failed.  Also, this message is at least 30 years too late to change how people talk.  Probably more.
Velcro right?
Generocide is a thing layers.
Velcro for president
Dang. Velcro Lawyers harmonizing something fierce at 1:44
omg ha
Velcro\n\nTrademark (TM) 2017 Velcro R company.
velcro
VELCRO!
*Velcro.*
lol why are so many people getting butthurt about this video. yall a bunch of virgins. thumbs up for pissin off reddit nerds.
I'll stick to velcro..
Velcro.
If you own or work for Velcro you are making bank. This is how corporations control you. Slowly and surely.
Maybe it would be cheaper to just give up the trademark.
no
justin mercado wasted the first comment, then edited it, then wasted second comment and edited that one too, then ten minutes later he came back and wasted third comment. Now I'm sitting here getting 5th when I should have 3rd.
Marketing: We make bags, straps and bookends now. TIME FOR A REBRAND!
I just took time out from hoovering the inside of my JCB to google that. I was so distracted I walked straight into a dumpster, and  now I need a band-aid for the cut on my arm. I wiped some of it with a kleenex, and smeared some vaseline over it.
I don't care. It's called velcro no matter who makes it, just like band aids, roller blades, kleenex and myriads of other things.\n\nI will not let some corporate stooge tell me what nouns I should be using.
Self-qualified lawyer here. I absolutely *adore* this video, for it reinforces the belief that we should protect the very best of our society, including multi-billion dollar corporations. It's sickening knowing that people are appropriating VELCRO®, knowing fully they are diminishing the real brand. As an upstanding Redditor, I'll upboat this video for visibility, so reap karma VELCRO®, you deserve it.
This video straight up made me cry for some reason. Like this is a hook and loop kicked in and I sobbed.
Velcro
This video gives exactly the reason why to call it velcro in the first place. Trademarks are stupid. Nobody wants to make lawyers richer. As soon as you have an idea and share it, it should belong to the people. Making money off of an idea is wrong
for doing this dumb video,  I will always call it velcro and I hope you lose your trademark
Can I replaced all my nouns with VELCRO®?
This is amazing! More name brands need to be like this!
I was with you until the censored swearing.  I would have shown my kids, so they could learn the right way, but you had to make it dirty.
Hook and loop? Maybe if you had a shorter, catchier name for it we wouldn't have been calling it velcro to begin with. I'm not going to call it hook and loop.
i just wish the audio was a little louder bcs there are moments where your voice is really low and I cant kinda hear it. no hate just suggesting
this background is bomb🔥👀
I think the Foundation looks very very nice on you..😍😍😍😎😎😎😎

Thanks this stuff really covers my bruised face and ass
Love this video!! What I like to do with the matchsticks is use my regular concealer that matches my skin and then I use the concealer stick to highlight a little and it works nicely on my skin. Maybe that could help?
THE KATY SIGN FROM THE UD COACHELLA HOUSE THOO! IF YOU REMEMBER THAT VLOG YOURE PROBABLY JUST AS OBSESSED WITH KATY AND DESI AS I AM 😂
What morphe brush do you use to buff out the concealer under the eye?

Eyeshadow blending is awful 😞
I needs a hype man like Jonye lol 😆
yes to the “No Makeup Makeup” !!!
WHY IS HER RING ALWAYS ABOUT TO FALL OFF AND FACING THE WRONG WAY ??? lol
I love this background!!! Also please do the kind of no make up make up look!! Those are my favorite and you always look stunning. Also, another video idea! A video about undereyes!! I feel like I have the exact same issues u have, kinda dry and have dark circles exactly like yours. Know you love bye bye undereye but can't really afford it. So would be awesome to hear your favorite drug store options ans also like skin care u think helps u most.  Just an idea but I'm sure alot of us could beneift from your knowledge! ❤❤❤
Yaaasss! Please do the “kinda make up no makeup” tut!!!
Omg Katy is trending YAAASS 👏🏼👏🏼❤️
Come all the way through ssssamanthaa blinking beaut lash!
Totally agree with you about being bored of eyeshadow palettes lately. I got the Desert Dusk palette last week and it's the first time in sooo long I can remember being excited to put eyeshadow on and play with a palette. It's SO beautiful and different. And each look I did with it lasted over 12 hours without touch ups. It looked just as good at hour 12 as it did at hour 1
Can we add a post it with an “@“ on that neon sign? 👀
I have been waiting for a new video to come out featuring hot new shit I am so excited to watch this video
Love this look!! That confetti needs to hop in my Sephora cart for Halloween. Just saying.
I think the fenty foundation looks AMAZING on you!! And your whole makeup look is life. Your skin is glowing and that eye look is killer ❤️
Wow this different look is some hot new shit 😍
I love how even when you make your own makeup collection, you are still using and reviewing other products. Even though your shit is HOT FIRE and I use it almost every day, it's still nice to see you trying out different products rather than just your own creations!!
i disliked the match stix set too and the foundation i feel like it broke apart on my face especially around the mouth
Love you, Katy!  Enjoyed the video! Snapchat Fam 😘
Do you paint your chest too?? Or just try to blend it out? My chest neck and face are all lighter than my body
You’re so extra with that katy in the background 😂😂 no shade. Love ya
Your background is 😍🙏🏻 also Jonye and his commentary 😂
Please do a full line review of glossier!! It would be great no makeup makeup
Beauty gurus are so confusing they have all skin types in a their normal videos they have oily/dry skin in their special videos and when they are having a good skin day they have normal skin and when they are having a bad skin day they have sensitive skin 😂🖕🏾 dafuq man 😂😂
Honestly, someone clue me in.  How many people are doing make-up tutorials, trials and so on on YouTube?  What for?????????
FEELIN this background!!

Legit loving the backround 😭😭❣️
Do any of you babes know the Morphe brush number that Katy uses allll the time to buff Concealer in?? I can never find a video where she says the number 🤷🏼‍♀️❤️✨
You NEEEED to try the Shiseido Synchro Skin foundation. It's the best for no makeup makeup. The coverage is very light so if that's what you want, don't. But it's the best for everyday and it's soo pretty, light weight. I never hear anyone talk about it and it's the only foundation I've actually finished a bottle. IT'S SO GOOD!! 😍😍😍😍😍
What brush did you use to blend out the concealer??
Nice interview. Gracious of him to take the time.
Thank fuck you're back. Also quality interview.
No uploads in a year and then you drop this gem.
Lol how'd you manage this
Quality interview
amazing interview
Brilliant vid
What do you think? Are you a body with a mind or a mind with a body? Also, we hope you noticed the book rec at the end of the vid. You can download an audio version of the book for free at http://www.audible.com/teded. And for even more book recs from our team, visit http://ed.ted.com/books.
I feel like I am mind equipped with a body 😅 right? Right?
What if the feeling of self is an illusion?
The mind is something science can never answer. How can you produce thoughts in your head from nothing? What about the dreams you have in your sleep. Science cannot answer this.
Thought is itself the thinker. Without thought, there is no thinker. Therefore, I am who I think I am.
I lost all interest before 90 seconds.\nDid my mind leave the body?
We are but an aspect of the universe with the sole purpose of experiencing itself. My mind and body are no more cohesive than a rock upon the ground and a speck of dust within space. We just exist. We just are. Every bit of your physical matter from the day you were born to the day you have read this has been completely replaced by new materials taken in from your surroundings. You aren't even you; YOU don't exist, WE don't exist... Nothing exists. Stop looking at everything as separate things and begin seeing everything as one hyper-massive singularity.
Really what I think that ever thing is real its not illusion because if it was then it would be there for not to be in any facial way of doing that if there no existence of anything and no existence then that will be only a mind just with a body because you know how you can touch sense and hear and feel and emotions and we see I think that's real the trees the grass the skys the clouds the air the animals the Critters/bugs being in my house at school seeing other people the tv the laptop the world.I know this doesn't have anything to do with this I think and I be live there is a god because who made us because there's no possible way that we can just come on the earth there has to be a crater of making the galaxy of space and the earth the sun the moon the solar system the stars the people on earth the ocean the land the ground the dirt more dirt um stuff that's on earth.If even there for if god made us just have illusions I don't think.
I agree but only to a certain point. I feel like you misunderstood & misrepresented what a soul is in religion.
Are you a peanut with a shell or a shell with a peanut?
This video us exaclty what my brain been going through for 20 yrs of my pufe. just more scientifically explained.
It’s funny I actually just started reading this book and recently got to Susan Calvin’s interaction with robots
Here is the rear question does it matter?
There is no past, and there is no future. We live in the now. The past is just a remembrance through thought. The future is just an expectation without reality. Our bodies are similar to this. Our bodies are created to be perceived by our mind. Our mind is created to experience our body. However, the two will never meet. They just “are”.
We are both and neither.\n\nThe body is simulated at the quantum level. \n\nAnd so is the mind. \n\nThey are one in the same yet nothing at all. \n\n0110100101011
This video seems really depressing
How such would one be if the child you were testing on was neither played with, looked at, or talked to? Would that change anything? How would you know if that one child was a mind with a body, or the other way around?
If we are just a body, then can we still give life meaning? Do we just work our whole lives just to see our personal progress erased after we die?
I'm a mind with a body. I view everything as a picture as 2D, 3D perception feel has vanished for me, sometimes there's moments were whatever I'm looking at I question myself saying Is that really there? Is it? I don't know then continue on with the day. As long I feel like I'm in control I'm fine with that.
It's obvious isn't it? We are Sims. ._.
Mind-body dualism is a bad idea.
this video is more than a useless thing
My mind's telling me no but my body is telling me yes
We are spiritual beings experiencing  reality in physical bodys.

I remember when I was a kid and I used to think about this too much. I always wonderer why me was me, why my body was mine.
(Before u read this, u should know I'm coming from a very atheistic point of view. So if u love Geezus or any other god, u probably shouldn't read this or u might get triggered.) On one hand, we are absolutely insignificant in the cosmic scale. Physically we are minute when compared to the billions of planets, stars, and galaxies in the universe. Our bodies are extremely fragile and could've only came to be through perfect circumstance. Our minds can be easily tricked and because of our senses, we never really see our world how it truly is. Be that as it may, we are literally the eyes of the Universe looking back on itself. Through the right evolutionary processes, we have come to be on this little space rock we call home. We can see and hear the world around us. We can attempt to understand it through scientific means and learn new things everyday. We can connect with each other and feel beautiful emotions like happiness, contentment, and love. Even though these are creations of our minds, they are still very real to us. I feel very special yet humbled by these thoughts. We should appreciate and enjoy life. We should love and help one another. We should value life but always keep in mind that when we're all gone, our energy will just flow on.

OH stop, we dont have spirits or ghosts inside us! we're all matter.
We are just a small bundle of carbon put together randomly, inside a vast galaxy. Which our lives or thoughts mean nothing.

If Descartes had the benefit of knowing about Darwin’s discovery he might have rephrased it to, evolved I am, therefore I think.
Is a half filled glass half full or half empty? Answer? Ew, it's salty
to answer that question ... we need first of all to answer the question : what's the nature of the Consciousness? i'm not talking about our basic Senses ... i'm talking about the self Awareness itself. Edward Witten, one of the most respected and greatest physicist of our time ... said : I think consciousness will remain a mystery… I have a much easier time imagining how we understand the Big Bang than I have imagining how we can understand consciousness.” probably to anderstand the mind mystery We have to go beyond and surpass our intelligence.
I like to think that I am similar to Krang.
What if I think it's a mix of both?
Definitely body with a mind.\nEverything you experience and imagine is just the firing of electrical signals and pathways through neurons in the brain. Therefore, the mind (the sum of these signals) is very much a physical thing. The brain is as much a physical organ as the lungs or kidneys. The mind merely functions as a way for the body to learn about and perceive its surroundings (to find food etc) so that it can survive another day with the chance at reproduction. Bodies with brains that have a greater ability to do this are more likely to reproduce and therefore through evolution, our brain has​ become more and more complex.
I think a body with a mind
My consciousness can't be pointless...
Got a taste for the cherry I just need to take a bite. Lol

When your here for a good time but get a confusing one
I'm just a thoughtless body... p.s. plz click this bc I'm broke :) http://teensearnbank.com/?ref=Madzmoney
If you think about it, everything in your body is used to protect, nourish, and reproduce your brain. You are a brain with a body to perpetuate the brain's existence.
I think we are all a mind inside of a body. At least I know I am. I feel like my body is just a vessel that I use to go throughout life. And I have to take care of that vessel or else I could die. And I am an athlete so there are plenty of times that I push my vessel to its limits to see what it’s breaking point is and how strong it actually is. And after seeing how strong it is I feel proud because after training it I made it stronger and more resistant to things. I never thought about it this way until now, but it makes sense. I tell it what to do and it does it. In return I keep it healthy and alive. Me and him are really good friends though, we understand each other.
Such a great and an informative video 😶👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 6 mins of my life finally not wasted.
3:10 that's one horrific looking baby
Thank YOU for the knowledge
You are a spirit with a soul ( mind, will and emotion) that lives in a body.
You are a receptacle of sensation. Everything you think of is proceed by the brain and given into this receptacle. And you also give impulsion to the material world. No ?
I'm more of a suggestion
Consciousness is a state of matter. The brain is in a state of matter which causes dendritic growth in a liquid crystal matrix. This dendritic growth controlled by the environment itself and the sum of our body inputs and thoughts and subconscious inputs. \n\nThis means that the 'body-mind' is an interface between two things, and the 'body-mind+environment' is another interface of 3 things. An interface between 2 humans, is an interface between 4 distinct things (body-mind-environment-body-mind). \n\nWe all share the 'Body of the environment with each other, so this is like the organism we compose, just as cells compose our bodies and share the body as their environment. \n\nDoes this preclude a non-material 'soul'? No! In fact it means that everything is part of your soul, because the interfaces are dissolved in various ways, including in death. The only possible way that science could explain a non-local consciousness with what we know about the Universe, is to organize the consciousness into a highly correlated quantum object that behaves like a superposition of all possible states the brain could take with it's slow physical matter. This highly correlated state could be considered a Bose-Einstein condensate or a superfluid. The sum total of the brain's capabilities could result in a quantum 'image' that can be stable and distributed across a holographic network in the environment by resonant entrainment of the quantum state of matter.  This can be done while ALIVE but it requires that the highly correlated 'body-mind' superposition delocalize itself just a bit so that it can be in two places at once. Both representing the physical activity of brain-states and interacting non-locally with the environments information/momentum content.\n\nYou can see evidence of this by looking the the double-slit experiments by physicist Dean Radin. \n\nIn those experiments the wave-particle duality of the experiments is influenced to collapse into particle behavior or expand into wave behavior depending on whether or not humans are watching (at any distance and through cameras even) because of our 'mind-body' creating a highly correlated 'sink' for quantum information. \n\nWhat if you have to prepare for death in order to be capable of navigating in a state where the body dies and leaves only the 'mind-environment' interface to store the previous information structure that the brain provided for the flow of information you think of as 'mind'. The highly correlated information can't disappear, it can be transformed but it won'y lose information through decoherence, but weakly correlated systems would become inaccessible to the 'mind' after death if there was trauma to the brain and decoherence was too strong before transmigration.
I'm a body mind
I don't believe we will know this answer in this life, I do not believe we are meant to know.
Neither, you are a soul
Neither, we are human, neither our minds mor bodies could exist separately.
What if it was both
( 3:37 )\nCan you see the left hand that in the smallest finger it has a little bit of white color on the nail ? \nI assume it is the plaster they put in the hand so they could create the fake hand on the right :P
Okay. Now, u just burnt what I used to call my brain.
Mind with a body...... like seriously? You can lose parts of your body but still remain whole. Whole being who you see yourself as. But lose a part of your mind and your no longer yourself.

So obvious...
Woah.
* hits blunt *
The question is nonsensical. Am I a brain or a body. Both. You can't take away one, then something deep and fundamental would lack. Also, we do have souls which is immaterial. The latter is logical because material stuff cannot give raise to consciousness, information cannot give raise to consciousness, information flowing cannot give raise to consciousness. Human brains does all three, yet we have consciousness. Saying that we have souls is just another way to say that there is something beyond material science which describes what we are. Perhaps it is tightly tied up to how brains and body work, but that does not mean we are just brains and/or body.
These type of question are the things that keep me up at night
Actually we are our bodies with a mind where by the mind is the part of the brain which we haven't figured yet, but we are somewhere around those 86 billions network of neurons network. \n\nAccidents explains well this phenomenon, a physical damage on a vital organ such as the brain there's a significant chance of the mind to be affected which brings the idea that if the mind isn't our body then it shouldn't be affected it should've dodged the bullet lol... btw yes we are our bodies.
My personal believe is that we were born as body with a mind building within us and some of those minds will ascend to a higher plane of existence. The way of doing this is unknown to the living and shall be forever.
Mind with a body
Are you a body with a mind or a mind with a body? - YES!
who are we to ask those questions?
I haven't seen the video,but i believe that i am a mind in a body
I'm hungry...
Huh?
This hurts to watch
First, that's no innovation at all. Way behind on the watch as they are on the phone. Very expensive usual products, sold as premium, which I think is only in the heads of the less educated. There is NO premium, as this type of classification is truly different for each individual.\nAs we aknowledge beauty and good taste differently, the same way we take premium under consideration. So just taking those Apple products as premium, just because they say so, it's only a sign a premature brain leaking :) .
The Swiss government wants you for crimes against wristwatches
Think I could get that scratched Apple Watch? Very good video!!! Thank you.
They should have just called it flame fusion crystal  just like Invicta does to make bull shit sound fancy LOL! Dude.. congratulations, you literally stopped me from making an impulsive 700 dollar purchase today on a fucking piece of bullshit when it's not even complete sapphire. Thank god for people like you. I'd like to hire you to work for me lol!
Nice to see the scratch test on the ceramic! How does the black chrome fare?
*The* *bed* *is* *lava* *like* *this* *if* *you* *died*
Fucking piece of shit apple. All apple is a rip off and all people that buy apple are morons.
I have to say the level 6 and 7 I can barely see the phones I would see it immediately?
Does the apple watch have an AR coating? \n\nAR coating is softer than sapphire.
He said it very well.. buy the base model, and you’ll be fine. Don’t hate on Apple because of a watch, hate them for having children build their phones at miserable salaries
Which is the best smart watch you recommend to get?
Apple we have indestructable screens that crack if you drop them any higher than 2 nanometers
Tissot should pay you because you just made me want that watch.
Good evening JerryRigEverything\n\n\n I am a social media editor of EBC NEWS from Taiwan, Asia, which have over three million fans.We saw your excellent presentation video of Scratching the $1300 dollar Apple Watch - is it really 'Sapphire'?, which is the video from these links below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EBgaxFfDA0\n\nwe want to access your authority to use your video in our news report. May we get your authorization and publish on our Facebook page and Youtube channel? Defenitely we'll tag your Youtube channel  for sure.Thanks sincerely !\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/news.ebc/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/EBCbuzz/
basically Apple is still fucking over the consumers and trying to make products as cheapily as possible and sell it as expensive as possible. Get any other brand than apple please people.
Maybe you shouldn't scratch them with level 6+ if you dontn want marks on screen
Omg some of us can’t even afford these things and here he is scratching them!! Ugh I want a apple 3!
The rubber seems to be legit, though. LOLOLOLOL
Can I have any of the watches?
Sue Apple for false advertisement. 1,300$ for that piece of shit.
Damn, I can buy TWO of those Tissot watches and still have gas money in my pocket. Apple is so overrrrrrpriced!
Apple cuts cost and wants more money, Simple is that. Most of iUsers aren't scientist, and they don't care about it.
I'm very grateful to you Zack for this amazing channel, Please keep it the same. Don't change your principles or ideas based off money there are only few of good channels left nowadays.. Thanks again.
Get a screen protector and call it a day
i hope you read this comment since you do this kind of test i want you to test the hardest watch in the world rado v10k vs CX Swiss Military Watch 20,000 FEET the hardest mechanical watch in the world
Its hurt to watch that you scratch the Tissot even you know that iWatch will scratch at 6. Tissot will scratch at 8 and testing with pick 7 would be fine, but all the way to 8? You have already proven this before. Spare the Tissot next time.
Apple buys Artificial Sapphire for some company I forgot the name of. Search it on YT there's. Short documentary on it. And I hurt me more of see u scratch Tissot watch than Apple watch
I think they use sapphire coated glass because a pure sapphire crystal would be quite brittle. Even with just the sapphire coating the expensive Apple watches are easier to shatter at least compared to an unscratched base model with a glass screen. As the glass gets scratched easily it gets weaker agains impacts and might shatter as well.\n\nUsing a pure crystal is a lot easier in a traditional watch as it is round eg. has no sharp edges or corners. The weak edge is protected by the metal housing of the watch. The Apple Watch’s design leaves a pure crystal very vulnerable and it would probably completely shatter in normal use.
This is tech Rex's educational brother
I always look forward to your videos. You get to do all those things we shouldn't.  Thanks
I just watch this channel to see apple products get wrecked,it's very pleasing.
That's just how Apple is making a fortune by saving resources. Fanboys will buy anyway, because they do not know the techniques but they are marketing.
I am pretty sure they use impure Sapphire because it is super difficult to make in that shape and maybe the impurities help? Also it might make a difference for a touch screen but idk. Not an excuse though. For close to 1500$ you could get a much more reliable watch. Possibly even a after market Rolex if you are lucky. I rock a g-shock mudmaster 24/7 and I love it. It has Sapphire as well and was only 700
I just wish this controversy could be exposed so that apple wouldn’t be profiting from their cheap, low quality electronics. The software of apple is far superior to any others but the build quality is low grade.
As usual play know most of their buyer ignorance they play around with words.
Phones aren't even $1.3k and smartwatches have less functionality... Wtf?
Tissot: awesome.\nApple: total shit.\n\nAnd that price? It is for morons.
Can I have your damaged iPhone watch?
APPLE HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO!!
The dislikes are from butthurt Apple fan boys.
Nice video, but could you STOP SCRATCHING WATCHES!!!
Tim Cook and the rest of the Apple team is really mad at Jerry right now 😂😂😂
Apple has turned into yet another purveyor of overpriced, over hyped junk err I mean products. The cult of Mac is a powerful drug. The first computer I used was an Apple II in grade school in the late 70's, this is NOT the same company in any way, shape or form, sad.
BUYS 1.3k watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGets a rubber band.

You scratched your 300$ Tissot watch for this kinda impure apple watch!??
scam?!
https://youtu.be/ywn9EXyj8s0
Test the leEco s3 pls
God damnit apple
Ouch
I cringed watching this!🙈
cheap tricks by apple
LLLLLLLLL Lick ma ballllsssss, I'm tiny rick!!!!!!!!!
Ur not scratching the tissot Watch dumb cunt until u got to level 8 idiot
Apple is super sneaky and ruthless
Did you try the scotch pad method? They have an oil resistant coating that scratches and can be fixed by removing it with a scotch pad heavy duty after about 30mins of rough scrubbing
Hey Jerry, I have a question. A while back you said that apple gets paid every time a manufacturer makes a charger for the iPhone. Would it be the same for mentioning the product in a movie? Just curious. :)
Can you do a review of the Oukitel K3
Nice video! but I can give you a hint?..instead of using a $1 lighter 04:46, use a zippo! 😉 You'll notice differences in your tests.. Thanks.
First of all, the reason to use Sapphire is due to the hardness to make sure no scratch on it! \nSo, Apple! if you just gonna use the Sapphire but with the same hardness as the normal glass, than what is the point of using it! Just to make it sounds expensive and can charge more? \nBy doing this Apple you just showing me how you want to do business like, just fooling customers around and cutting the edges to everything to make more profit, no longer like before, which you just want to make the best product!\nMaybe this is why from a company leading 5 years to now just like other company and some other company even ahead of you!
It's some type of mixture with sapphire. Probably just to advertise
whoa whoa hang on, are you trying to tell me Apple lie to their consumers?... no, that can't be. This is special Apple sapphire and it costs a little extra for someone at the Apple store to spit on the glass to give it an extra coating of protection. Sometimes you hear the staff laughing at you as you hand over the money and walk out the store, but I doubt its at the customer who spent a mere $1300 on a product that definitely wont go out of date within 12 months. I suspect they are laughing at silly Samsung owners who stupidly pay less for a much higher spec device... pfft it doesn't say Apple on it so...
Wow, a special red bit 😑
Why do that to such a nice watch????
Who is also crying when the bald guy started level 8 with Tissot 😭😭
the rubber seems to be legit.. 10/10
thank you for doing this. amazing. .hit the sub button guys. this is one of youtube best.
Can you make a video of removing the scratches you made by polishing as its a gemstone ?
Nice video, are you going to test Nokia 8 at some point?
Of course it’s not worth it
*As it was already explained by Samsung, the fake thing here is not sapphire, but the test itself.* The reason is that the guy uses the hardness measurement instruments it a way that it is useless for measuring hardness. The instruments only return valid results if they are used in a press that apply an equivalent of a constant force (like 1 kg) perpendicularly, not a random force at random angle.
Thank you for this video. Pains me to see the Tissot scratched , but very insightful as I have been thinking about the stainless version manly for the sapphire crystal.
Remember that Apple Watch also has a touch screen...
I think if you buy a $1300 watch your a fucking moron
Bro i just wanna say you are the best! :D
YES it’s a SAPPHIRE but it’s china sapphire
+JerryRigEverything\n\nF🖕🏼k Apple and their *sapphire lies !!!*\n\nI’m getting four (4) Tissot watches for $1300 💵 dollars
You are scratching the number 6 with the mohs pick 6
How many of you're directed from  GSM arenas link?
Please keep scratching with higher level picks, because we want to see these nice deep scratches
Do a Samsung galaxy j7 prime durability test! Please
You sound like Ben Wyatt from Parks and Rec :D
Now..apple is not that apple of steve jobs
Apple corporation would've had hated you, but their fan base is mostly made of blind imbeciles. Apple guys just nervously chuckle
I am sorry but it doesnt matter if it has it or not. It cannot match other sapphire glass watches so it doesnt count.
Apple: overpriced junk
Gotta love apple
Plz make a durability test on Lenovo z2 plus
Scratching the 1,300 dollar dollar Apple Watch
Apple = 💩
Wasting money for nothing
Trending......
Is Tissot  watch is for  giveaway ? 😍😍😍
well, surprise apple fans, you got scammed
why does apple always charge so much for their products?
lol there is a video about if the apple watch’s glass is sapphire or not, and the guy prove that it’s sapphire with level 8 hardness. There is a non sapphire version. Either this guy buy a wrong the non sapphire version by mistake or this video is a scam.
Im more interested into your tissot watch, which model is that?
Your looking really good Louise! Xx
I struggle to get the kids I work with to drink too. I have a box of curly and fun straws for the really resistant children. They're a pain to sterilise but still better than dehydration. We also give a choice between milk or water, so if a child doesn't like water, they have a choice. Putting fruit in (raspberries, lemon etc) can work too for some children.
Dan seems sooooo happy far out!! You do too Louise
This whole entire vlog was so delightful. Oh  my word
aww, i love how giddy and excited dan gets when he's with louise
I'm a new subscriber to your vlogs. I've also got the audio version of your book that I'm really enjoying so excited to pre order the sequel. Hope you are keeping well x
My sister is about to turn 18 and we still have to nag her to drink more water! :')
Does louise still have her other cats?
Joe not wanting to touch the baby and Marcus tickling Louise is adorable
My son's 8 and it's still a battle to get him to drink!! I feel your pain! We've just had a breakfast battle over a cup of water! But he loves fizzy water & will drink it endlessly!  I try and get him to eat lots of things like Celery, cucumber & melons or he could go a whole day without water!!! Xx
Omggg that tyre thing happened to me on the freeway (In australia about 100kms/hr) and i ended up having a car accident its terrifying!!
You should try using feliway friends for the cats, it's a plug in diffuser which releases the same pheromone a nursing mother at does after having kittens and helps your cats feel at ease around each other and generally just get along better! Can probably be found fairly cheap on amazon but here's the website for it - https://www.feliway.com/uk/New-Feliway-Friends x
When the kids don't want to drink water, I usually told them really excited omg u know what can we do, grab a lime 🍋 I cut it open and drop like 5 drops of lemon, and tell them that bc we put lemon there it's not gonna taste like water, and I'll have a glass with them, but idk 😂
Your weekly vlogs honestly make my day when I watch them😂
I am new! I think you're bloody marvellous though! X
I never comment, but I must know where your lovely necklace is from? The one with the pink stone on the middle! It's pretty! X
Just FYI, I love the long vlogs. They play while I work. I work from home.
ok didnt the whole gang include naomi or no? \nmaybe its me, i just feel a bit weird about that
This video was a crazy mess, just the way I like them👌🏻👍🏻glad to see that you got pep back in your steps. Big Love M❤️
My sisters never wanted to drink and mum got them these water bottles each and it had like lines and tells them when the need to keep drinking and that and then refill and they would get little rewards when they had drank it !! Highly Recommended💓
ok pause video at wilde pre order (tick),, pop on amazon(tick),, pre order book(tick) ,, and continue watching the video,,, (tick)
Im new but I'm gonna be a stayer i just love this
my mum used to color my milk to get me to drink it, just a drop or two of food coloring, might work the same with water? you could even add some fruits and let it sit overnight to give it some flavour (which is the only way i can drink water because i don't like the taste)
The Dublin store is the main store, Primark is Irish ! :)
you should try flavored water to get encourage her to drink more water
I used to and still really dislike water. It makes me feel ill if I drink it. So I put some sugar free lime squash in it and it makes it easier to drink personally
I Love your Videos with dan and Phil
Louise I love these long videos!! Thank you xx
My foster sister (mum is a foster carer) battled with my mum for at least the first 6 months of living with us. Then my mum found a water bottle with her name on and ever since then she drinks the full bottle each day. Give that a go? X
Hey so with the water dislike, My mum used to use cordial (natural ones like lemon or pineapple ones), or we had drink bottles with diffuser's in them so we could add things like strawberries or kiwi fruits
I don't like donuts... I'm sorry they just taste so weird, especially glazed... The only donuts I really like are completely chocolate ones.
Aw, Dan was just adorable in this. He turns into a kid around Louise, I love it XD
I'm NEW! And loving all your videos!
I am new. Lol.
my brother is exactly the same with drinking and he's 10!!!
my 5 year old son struggles to drink his water and whats worse is that he only drinks water or hot chocolate. you tell him to drink some and he will take a sip. its so hard . he comes home from school with none drunk too. 😔 x
28:15 if you guys were wondering
Where’s Tanya and Naomi :(
I have only been watching for like 3 or 4 months
Newww
neww
For Darcy's water intake there's an app called plant nanny. Maybe that's something you guys can do together that will help. Basically it's the cute little app where you log your water intake throughout the day and it waters a little plant and makes it grow and keeps it alive. So maybe you could download it on your phone and she will enjoy coming to tell you when she drinks so she can water her flowers!
I never drunk water as a kid and now I drink it all the time, just put a little bit of juice in it and by the time she's older she'll learn to love it on its own
For your tires, next time check to see if there was any bumps on the side. That can cause blow outs.
I'm currently watching Chesapeake Shores on Netflix and it's so heartwarming and good for my soul
GET THOSE APPS FOR DRINKING WATER AND IT GROWS YOUR PLANT\nI got it on my phone for my sister because she did the same thing
I’m new-ish. I watched you when I was about 12/13, stopped, and now I’m watching again as a 17-almost-18 year old. Started again bc your content has changed, it’s sort of grown with me which is cool! x
I really love the long vlogs!
Louise! Is that poop on your rug at 5:36?! Ha ha ha!!
It was so nice seeing you all together- reminded me of old school YouTube :')
That's so weird, you guys were literally ten minutes away from where I live!
I'm new to your vlogs (: I love your chats and your pink hair!!
do a rose quartz cosplay hawhaw you fit that role perfectly
You actually get a lot of liquids from foods so it's quite normal for kids who are eating a normal amount to not feel like drinking. I dranks very, very little as a child even when I was playing sports. Also the 8 cups of water a day was mostly made so important by a bottled water company if I recall correctly so that's also a thing :)
I love doughnuts but I can’t eat them 👎🏻😞 I can’t eat wheat or gluten or dairy 😭😭😭😭
Oh your living room is the exact blue I want for my new place!! Absolutely beautiful 😍😍😍 Please could tell me what colour and brand it is? xxx
I am new love your videos so much
Dan: Can Phil express an opinion \nMe:Daniel can Phil express an opinion \nXD
Yes my little sister will not drink
My daughter is almost 12 and I STILL have to reminder her to drink water!\n\nI loved seeing you with the old gang, I laughed hysterically...
Make the drinking a fun game! Drink through a straw. Draw lines on a bottle, and make it a game, to get down to the line!
ahh louise you're dah best and i can't wait to sniff some fresh content 👌 and i love your vlogs teehee
I want to be a cleaner oh she's so cute. I love that she so badly wants to be in the vlogs too 😂💕 ps I'm loving orange is the new black, need finish the last series!
I was new in 25 june 2012
Thumbs up if you reckon Louise would go into labour if she saw IT?!
I'm so happy the gang got back together :):) so happy I cried 😂what have you done to me 😂😂😂xxx
As far as your tire goes. It looks like  low tire pressure may have caused you to loose the seel on your tire.
Aw i'm new btw and i love your vlogs ❤
I really want to read your book now by the way! I hadn't looked into it that much but hearing you talk about it is making me want it!\n\nAlso, I'm jealous of your candle stash!!
I love the yellow cardigan thing you were wearing, you look gorgeous, where is it from?
Hi lovely, I struggled to get my 5 year old daughter to drink and bought her a kids hydrate m8 bottle so it has the times on it and she has to drink down to the correct time. It really works! Xx
Hello I'm new. I started watching you because I follow brummymummyof2. X
I love Darcys little fringe, she's so cute 😄 ps. I've been subscribed for like four years I think
Try ..... fruit smoothies for a drink in the morning ... \n\nFun cups and straws help too!! \n\nTry a few sliced up bits of fruit in the freezer to pop in the water to make fun fruity ice ! Xx
Which one of you is the father? I wanna laugh and cry endlessly 😂
i couldn't drink water too at a young age, try to flavour it with something, mint sciroup worked for me
Love them such a lovely Vlog, so beautiful ❤
My cousin is 12 and my auntie still battles with him over drinking! He's a very happy healthy boy though! Xx
I kind of need that lipstick from the first day of the week  🤗
If you're liking The Confession Tapes on Netflix you should try watching Time: The Kalief Browder Story. But it will make you angry and cry loads!
I work in a nursery, and I'm an auntie of two little boys. Particularly at nursery we find a bottle that they find exciting and have chosen themselves helps them be more enthusiastic about drinking, which I'm sure could work at home as well :) also watered down fruit juice for a little bit of flavour 😘 hope it helps xx
I don’t like doughnuts
Any chance you could do an 18+ meet up? You mentioned it a while back - like cocktails perhaps for those of us who are a little bit older?
omg rocket!!!! hahahah couldnt stop laughing
Who is Rocket??
Lol hiiii, I'm newww. :3
What does Louise say at 1:57 hahaha
I don't know if it's available in the uk, but my siblings and I always drank water when it was mixed with cordial (and still do)
I'm SO ready for your video with dan and Phil 😁
Louise is the definition of a super mum
Im a new viewer 🤗 came from a binge on estee lalonde's old videos and found her breakfast with louise video x
You are such a beautiful and inspirational woman! Love watching your vlog every week. It brights up my day.
IM NEW
im new
Meeeeeeee
30:18 Milky?
who doesnt like donuts? sadists.
I'm new :)
You were fucking rude to Richard Medley. Pity your ego got in the way during that interview... you came off as an arrogant narcissist. Fucking idiot.
I feel sorry for Rocket :( he's lost his friend and now he has to get used to two new cats.
Arsene Wenger reportedly interested in signing him
Top finish. Love the dive from the keeper!
A beastly finish from Payet's big brother
The keeper trying to save it made it even more special for him. Look how emotional he gets It's like he's just won the world cup! I bet the keeper is so pissed for conceding a goal 😂😂😂
Better than Benzema
Arsenal wenger:I almost signed him
Love how the keeper still tried for it
How is this on the trending page and there's only 9 comments??
Well down you man this is real fan :)
What a fucking finish lad!
What a finish bottom corner😂
Not all heroes wear capes
Candidate for puskas award.
on his way to liverpool
We've all thought about it..
My friend:if you go and score I will give you a pie\n\nMe: hold my beer
That's one off the bucket list 😝
I don't think the goal Keeper was ready for it...
Yellow card for the celebration hahaa
Lol only the keeper tried
Wasn't that an own goal?
Why did the keeper try to save it
The man is living the dream, what a legend
Take notes Messi
Keeper is horrible
Go on lad !
g
*STREAKER ON THE PITCH*
Bless his little heart
Quality finish hahaha
Why is this trending
What a goal 😂😂😂
Lol
Molto simpatico;)

What a belter 💯
Спартачи так же делали задолго до марселя )))
what a boring sport
0:12 did he smell his own sweaty armpits or something what's that face for lol.
Love you Amelia, but I think the reason people hate on the fake color lenses, it that they are incredibly distracting. Whether you think about it or not, people tend to look into the eyes of other people when they are talking, and when something as subtle as an eye color is different than what you are used to seeing it can become extremely distracting. I love all your videos, just wanted to share my opinion, plus your natural eye color is so beautiful!!
You look gorgeous in this video, as you do in all your videos. PLEASE do not listen to the negative comments about your eye contacts. They look great and so do you. It’s your life and YOU decide what to wear/do, not random internet trolls.
Love your look with or without lenses. WHO CARES. Why would it bother someone else... its not hurting anyone? 😶
What a bunch of haters on here?! Ameila looks beautiful with or without her contacts. What her contacts do is only enhance her natural, already there beauty. I personally LOVE them on her. A few videos back some of you didn't like her winged eye makeup, which in my opinion looks also great on her. If a person don't support you Financially, Emotionally, and Mentally, then... (Fill in the blank)... them where they breathe.
Love it! Old amelia style vid💗
I don't get all the negative comments about the contact lenses... they're no less fake than dying hair or applying eyelashes. It's fun to switch things up with your look. You look pretty as always Amelia!
People need to lay off with the contact lense comments or at least be respectful. As someone that has dark coloured eyes, I love and wish I had light eyes. You always want what you don't have. That said, comments about how Amelia's contacts are distracting, fake, not your preference are unnecessary. If someone has naturally curly hair and straightens it, or likes to self tan if they're fair, or wants to wear contacts to change their eye colour and do something different it shouldn't be open for discussion. Live and let live.
Yes to the high end one 🙌🏼 xxx
Did she say which shade she had of the NYX Vivid Brights Creme Color? I swear I've watched it back twice and I don't hear her mention the shade. Does anyone know which it is? I want to pick it up ASAP because it's gorgeous!
Which mascara would you recommend please????
Fantastic video Amelia, I have a lot of these products because of you (you're my number 1 enabler) my favourite though has to be the maybelline concealer it's soooooo good under my eyes!  Please please do an insta live soon.  💋 xx
Good video! Luxury version ?? :)
Fekkai brilliant gloss shampoo conditioner-best in the world!!
Mascara?
it's so, so, so-so-so-so-so soooo gooood :D:D
i think you look amazing with this eye color!!
Why so much negativity? Amelia you are beautiful, keep doing your thing x
Love you in those contacts 😍😍😍
I hope you don't take those negative comments to heart. I personally think these specific colored lenses you're wearing look more flattering on you ❤️ But I also do love your natural eye color as well ❤️ sending you and Duke much love ❤️
You should try the OGX Lemon Highlights Shampoo for your coloured hair. The whole range of OGX is amazing and I highly recommend you to try them 😊
Hi Amelia, long time follower here and I'm just glad to say that I loved today's video. However, I have to agree with some of the other commenters.  Those contacts are beautiful on you but I had to keep rewinding because they're distracting (and very beautiful)!  This might be a good thing for a date night... love you xxx
People that are hating on the contact lenses or claiming they are not 'hating' but still commenting negativly on the contact lenses need to learn that she feels great in the contact lenses and that should be the only thing that matters. You may not like them as it is different and something you would not usually wear but there is no point on commenting on it as it really doesn't effect her life at all and she will wear them regardless. \nPeople need to chill lol.
Try pureolgy hydrate! It has saved my color treated hair.
Great video Amelia!! What are you wearing on your lips in the video??
I love these contacts I don't know why anyone would not they're stunning
What about mascara?
Loving the contacts xxx
Try silicon mix conditioner..The best👍🏻
L'Oréal lash paradise
My problem with the foundations is the fact that I have oily skin and foundations tend to oxidise on my face and get darker what do you recommend me to use ,what type of foundation should I buy
What nail polish are you wearing?
Why does almost all of the products look not used????
Can't live without: AVON wash off water proof mascara, great for daily and comes off so easy! Not sure if you can get it in the UK; Also Almay non oil eye makeup remover pads, Costco brand make up remover wipes, and Sally Hanson Color Therapy or Complete Manicure nail polish, they also have the wide brush.
I actually love the colored lenses. You look so cute
Luxury version please!! :D
You should try Aveda’s color treated shampoo & conditioner it works great!
You look soon pretty!! As usual. :)
Im so jealous i wish there was a duke on my lap.
There aren't many drugstore eyeliners that can stand up to my oily eyelids, but the one from Revlon (the one that twists up) doesn't budge on me. I use the one with a purple cap, and the dark purple shade makes my brown eyes pop. 
Thanks for this video Amelia! Everyone on youtube seems to be so obsessed with luxury makeup lately
You need to try the maybelline eye shadow pallet
For your suggestion I really wanted to know about the N7 line I really want to know if is good, please let us know if you try some products and what you think about it . Love your videos. For the contacts is a little different but it doesn't bother me at all.
I really love your videos, they're really pleasant to watch. By the way, regardless all the negative comments, I really like your contact lenses!! Lots of love from Spain :)
I really like it, I think she looks so beautiful!  Keep wearing them. It softens her look, and she looks more feminine and she is just having fun. Its fine!
The contacts look so good!
In my opinion, whtever she wears on her eyes, that's her choice and that's a kind of fashion. I really don't mind and she looks amazing.
I think your lenses make your eyes look very pretty
Amelia, you are so lovely! I am so in love with British culture. Women seem to have a femininity that American women kinda lack ( me )! I started watching your vids just because we share a name :) but I think you are sweet and funny and produce really great videos! I love Duke too! xo
Amelia you look really good with those lenses. it suits you
The lenses make you look blind.
that eye colour looks lovely  on you but i want to  scratch my eyes while watching this aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Green eyes are awesome on you!!!
You look a bit like Miranda Kerr in the thumbnail!
need that shimmery l'oreal shadow in my life ASAP
I wish I could send you the drugstore shampoo I use bc since its from a Brazilian brand you won’t find anywhere but in Brazil, but its soooooo good, it leaves my hair so smooth and shiny and it really helps my hair growth
Try Sally Hansen Colour Therapy in blushed petal! It's my #1 favourite nail polish... I'm on my 4th bottle, it's always on my nails! It lasts forever and leaves my nails so nourished and strong!
Let her live geez contacts are fun to play with haha the milani baked bronzes are good they're so glowy
Giiiirl, what is on your nails right now, in this video?! That color is giving me LIFE, I need it....!
Love your makeup in this video, will you do a tutorial on this look? You look so amazing!! I am going to have to buy most of these products now, love this video!!! So cute!! ❤😙
I loooove that you included cut aways of your old videos. Soo nostalgic and beautiful!
Love you Amelia, and I think you should wear whatever the heck color contact lenses you want. 👌🏼💋\nAnd YES! I have a holy grail shampoo and conditioner!! It has CHANGED. MY. HAIR GAME. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ it's the Bed Head Urban Antidotes level #3 (red bottle) for severely dry hair. OMG, I've tried other sets, even salon and prestige brands and nothing can touch the amount of life, body and softness this set gives me. I really hope you try it!! Good luck!🍀🍀🍀
You look like a completely different person with your contacts!!! That must be fun to change up!
OMG you look so different with colour lens :O Almost didn't recognized you ;-) You look amazing :-) Which ones are, please? xx
Some amazing things here. The pallete is definitely one of my personal holy grail. I would love if you could check out my Disney world vlog channel !
essence satin lipsticks and what lipstick combo are you wearing
Big fan of the contact lenses! I can't believe how much of an impact it has, I noticed on the thumbnail you looked different! I have blue eyes but would love to try brown!
Ignore the hysteria about the lenses. They're fun aren't they? I use them & it's great to change up your look x
Great info and loved that you have made everything easy and affordable for everyone. Sometimes the more luxury products are out of reach
loved it! and yes please a luxury version!
Great info! Love the video, thank you for all the ideas Amelia! 😍☀️
❤ Amelia!!!  I think you would really like the L'Oreal True Match blush in Subtle Sable!  It's very natural,  with a satin finish.  I was introduced to this blush by someone who primarily uses high end blushes, and fell in love with it.  Just thought I'd mention it to you as well, since you featured a few L'Oreal products and you seem to tlike them too... :)))\nI wish so much they sold that Garnier Rose Water Balm in Canada...  Went to look for it online and it looks like it's only available in th UK... :(  You are so lucky!!!\nP.S.  Those lenses are beautiful but I still think you are stunning with your natural eye color...  Although it could also be because it makes you look like a different person and I'm so used to the real you... :))  Hard to tell...
Omg I just used that Garnier sheet mask last night for the first time. I loved it! I used it a couple hours before bed and my skin woke up so hydrated.
hello can you do a full review on the garnier balm please..like pros and cons when and how to use it..that kind of thing
The contact lenses look amazing!!! IDK why people don't like them, the colour looks really good on you and they don't seem super fake xx
I could not stop looking at the eyes beautiful. They look more awake and open.
Everybody is negative because your eye color... I dont get it. You look beyond stunning!
You look like Urwa Hoccane in this video if you dont know her google it!!
I really appreciate it that you made a video on drugstore products. Now i can go out and get products from these affordable yet amazing brands 💜💜
100% L'Oréal Elvive, I've tried so many brands but I go back over and over and over. I'm currently loving fibrology and the clay but they're all amazing
Love this videos and went through and liked a couple comments that focused on the content rather then focusing on changes. You're always the best
Yes the luxury...... 😁😁😁 please
Yes, to the luxury version!
Ameliaaaaa I would love to see the luxury version ones! Please do them soon :D
I’m would love to see more videos on your lipstick collection maybe like best of drugstore as well as high ends for fall or something like that!! And Yes for the luxury brand version of this video. ❤️😘
What about mascara?? I know it's hyped but I do love the new loreal paradise one. It's so good! I also use the simple cleansing oil love it to take off my makeup xxx
what bedding do you have?
Are there any websites that sell Bourjois in the US?
Luxury version for sure!!!!!
so weird to see you with this eye color, I actually prefer your natural color 😊
Shampoo and conditioner!! Try Living Proof. The restore line in the purple bottle. It makes your hair super soft and smells so good. (:
I'm sorry but I think that you're natural eyes look so much nicer than these contact lenses! :(
I swear those lenses are so distracting Amelia! 😭😭
Why why youtubers are talking about beauty and often have chipped nails? I don't understand...I love this video but those chipped nail close ups make me cringe..
Love the green lenses on you Amelia!
Need to try this garnier 3in1 mask, your skincare recommendations always work for me so I already know I'm going to love it 😍
I would love to know what is on your nails! Beautiful colour <3
Where are your contacts from?
Whats your eye shadow today?! So pretty!! Sorry if I missed you say it x
hi amelia ! love your nail color. what brand is it ??? I need to purchase this hahah
No mascara??????? Or eyebrow products?????? Whooaaaa

she looks like the girl from lazy town
This was at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The soprano was 28, not 16. She is portraying a doll, Olympia, with whom Hoffmann falls in love. Sadly, she is only a doll. The opera is Les Contes d’Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann) by Jacques Offenbach. \nRemember kids, there is no amplification in opera. These people have trained, and have loud voices. I love opera. 👍🏻😊
She was not 16, she was actually 28 when she sang that. Jesus Christ, that's a 12 year difference! How can you get something so god damn wrong?! https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/726trh/in_2009_an_understudy_for_a_trained_opera_singer/
She was 28 when she sang this performance. 36 now
Amazing!!!!!!!
This is creepy
Was that Rachel Gilmore?
Wow 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
She was 28 you morons..
Holy fricc
Ez
She was 28
She trashed it
Fifth Element Diva!
True talent 😍
Phone screen just cracked.

Omggggg so amazing

Damn

Wow...how can there be dislikes
WHOA WHAT,?!?!  INCERDIBLE!!
stephanie from lazy town is quaking
This was AMAZING. BUT 16 ?!?! Skssk😍😍
Whoa.
Anyway, here's wonderwall
Slay bitch 😭🙌🏾💯
Stephanie, dufuq you doing here?
I've seen better :/
A crowning achievement.
Wow
She's not 16.
👌
Clickbait title...She wasn't 16
This is from 2011.....
She usually has black and white hair in the music videos
That was a fantastic performance
Is it just me or does the way she dance weird?\nBTW,\nShe's like mariah carey but opera.
Pshhhh...let's see her sing the contra G in Do Not Reject Me in My Old Age. She's got nothing on my boi Chesnokov. 😤😤💪💪💪
Why do people like opera? I can only take so much of women screaming in my ear before I lose it.😬😉
Theres her, age 16\nthen theres me... my best achievement is 100 hours on Mercy in Overwatch
Who’s here from Reddit?
What that mouth do tho
I didn't realize the human voice could resemble a violin so much 🙄
My dog freeked the fuck out when the is came on
She was actually 28, not 16. She mentioned it in the Reddit post.
I dnt know anything about opera but u can tell she is good by everyone's expressions. They all looked amazed.
okay, now its time for her try at the 5th Element Opera Song.
But she isn't 16.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE BORING ASS PEOPLE LAUGHING AT?! beautiful voice btw.
Opera equivalent of Through Fire and Flames in Guitar Hero.
She was 28 not 16 she confirmed this on reddit
OMFG MY WINDOWS ARE CRACKING....OMG THE BIRD'S HEAD JUST POPPED....AAAAAAAAAH....OMG I CANT HEAR ANYTHING....DEAD
Is that actually singing? My ears are bleeding, its worst than that heavy metal where screaming people, but at least those don't use such a high pitch to fuck my ear drums
Bravo! Bravo!! 👏 💐  \n\n* Edit -- WTF!?  This is from 6 years ago :/
her singing is amazing and all, but as a dancer, the ballet incorporated in this is terrible
*people laughing*\nMe- wtf is she saying? Lol
wow she is amazing and her acting is in point I love it thank you for uploading this talented lady video you've got a new fan here
I can't even talk without my voice breaking.
She did a very good job. What a good voice.  Best wishes to the new young soprano.
Good singer but she scared the poop outta me
This is amazing!!! If I tried those notes I would just be screaming 😂
Wow! Good job lady! She can do that opera singing stuff so well for being a youngling.
Get her for fifth element 2!
Be still my heart!! I'm speechless...
I saw this is music class in school last year.
i'd LOVE to hear her sing Queen of the Night
WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY TIME????
Hopefully she doesn't get a sore through.
This is a reminder that white supremacy is everywhere take this down
U can hear the ppl laughing 😆
💥💥💥 that was you blowing my mind
Dame that's high
She's kind of freaking me out.
Didn’t know opera sounded this bad
26, not 16. She posted her story on reddit (with proof).
Must not be too good or she wouldn't be an understudy.
If she is 16 then I'm 16
What the hell is she wearing? She looks like a character from a cartoon or a weird looking Princess Peach
Wow that is a highly trained voice for a teenager! Great job!!
I don't usually like opera, but man that was something!
I'm glad some white people stay in culture while others are out acting like wiggers and weaboos.
Except she's not 16 at all.
She wasn't 16 she was 28 lol
She wasn't 16 when this video was taken btw, to sing this song the voice has to be at least 20.
Unfortunately, the title is inaccurate, because she said she was 28 at the time; there's proof from the soprano herself. But, what makes up for it is the fact that she was told she was singing in the concert 4 hours ahead of time, which is even more impressive, I think. AND playing with the MET: arguably the best opera company in the world.
SHE WAS 28 HERE NOT 16.  For god sake this channel is so lazy, cannot even get facts right. Regardless of age she is amazing.
This happened back in December of 2009.  Why is it being shown here like it's a new thing?
Omg! Rachel Gilmore went Viral!!! \nShe is an incredible singer and such a sweet, lovely young lady. I’ve met her twice and and every time she has been so gracious and attentive. May she and her husband have wonderful careers!
The video is years old, why is this only trending now
Report click bait she is 28 at the time of this song.
Damn missed this epi from lazy town.
lol she's not 16
Jesus in the morning
She's not 16. This is Rachele Gilmore's debut at the Met in 2009. She was 28 at the time.
That was metal as hell my dude. Rock on.
She was actually 28 at the time... This was posted by her on Reddit the other day:\n\nThat time I was lying next to my sleeping husband browsing Reddit in the dark and discovered myself the subject matter of this post...\nSo yeah, that’s me in the video. I’ve never actually commented on anything on Reddit before, mostly just a lurker, but I figure this is probably a good time to make my first!\nI was 28 at the time, living in Queens. It was 2 days before Christmas and my parents were in town visiting. I really did only have 4 hours notice and we all took a ride across the Triboro bridge in rush hour traffic to get me into the makeup chair in time. My parents actually got to see the performance, which was my MET debut, and is still is really special to me. Also, the reactions of the people in the chorus behind me, as I was told by several of them personally afterwards backstage, were actually genuine. It was a terrifying and thrilling night!\nBtw, I am 36 now. Is that really LATE 30’s??? I would say it still qualifies as mid 30’s and I’m sticking to that.\nAnyways, this being my first Reddit comment, I’m not really sure if you need proof it’s me, but I’m happy to answer any questions. I will probably fall asleep soon though, you know, being in my late 30’s and all ;)\nEdit: Proof: https://twitter.com/rachelegilmore/status/912165099368042496\nThat’s the best I could do for midnight. (Don’t want to wake the sleeping hubby, he flew in from the west coast today). Here I am holding the insert to the original program from that night announcing my performance.\nEdit 2: Thank you so much for all your wonderful comments. It’s so uplifting to hear that this performance still brings positivity to people after all these years. Off to bed. I will get to work on my inbox tomorrow AM and answer as many of your questions as possible. Goodnight Reddit!\nEdit 3: Back this morning to answer more questions. Going to try to get to as many as I can. Didn't get too much sleep last night ;)\nEdit 4: Further proof for those who were asking: https://twitter.com/RacheleGilmore/status/912376104727572480
Should not laugh but oh boy it's so funny. On a serious note though, the teacher was wrong to sit on the car's bonnet.
Teacher should not have sat on bonnet.. but thats not an excuse to  drive through him!..  He should have been reported not transported!!!..
Teacher acting unprofessional by sitting on someone's property = frustration and retaliation= a sore arse !!
Move please?!\nBugger off!\nWhy?!\nDo you know who I am?!\nWho the hell are you?!\nI'm Ronnie Pickering !!\nWho??\nRonnie Pickering!!\nWho?!\nRONNIE PICKERING!!
If the driver waited for traffic to pass and reversed, the teacher would of slid off his bonnet and landed on his ass, especially as he had his hands in his pockets. Not a very good teacher sitting on someone else's car. The car had no insurance or mot and if he did that, I doubt the car driver would of been arrested and jailed.
My sympathy was for the Teacher, but when I saw that he sat on the bonnet, that sympathy diminished, no need to be that arrogant.
Haha stupid cunt of a teacher. Arrogant cunt got what he deserved.
Sitting on the bonnet of someone's car is just asking for trouble. A quick reverse would have had the same effect. But we don't think straight when we see red do we!
Should’ve driven straight into a wall.
He sat on the mans hood .fuk id have .thrown him off my car too then stopped and whipped his stupid ass.
Serve the jobs worth right😂😂
Both are to blame, but the teacher should never have done that in the first place. Should have just let the car in the car park, then ask them to leave once off the main road and not obstructing traffic. Trying to be clever has cost him, could have had a nasty accident if he fell the wrong way too!
the description on this video is very inaccurate... The teacher actually sat on the bonnet of the car, Which in no doubt would have angered any motorist. Serves the teacher right for trying to be really cocky!!
that's my teacher so fuck of m8s 
Humans are garbage. This video is the proof.
The driver should have quickly reversed instead.
Stupid fucking teacher, he looked like a right wolly car surfing
Don't sit on his fucking car then! Cheeky twat deserved it.
Hahaha that’s funny!!! But why did the so-called responsible teacher sit on the mans bonnet??? Surely he knew that would only exacerbate the situation.
Nonsense the car gave the old man a ride to school totally innocent
This is my school😂
I have no problem with the teacher sitting on the bonnet of the car, too many people think they can park and drive anywhere they like. I see this on a daily basis outside our child's school, drivers who don't give a shit and will park anywhere. The teacher obviously told them they could not access this area and they basically refused to move. I personally would not have sat on the car just incase it decided to move, but to have a go at the teacher because he did is ridiculous, what that person did was reckless especially with those 2 kids on bikes being so close to being hit as well. What the teacher did was nothing compared to that driver, yet majority on here complaining about the teachers actions rather than concentrating on the driver. So sad.
Absolutely hilarious that!
Cheap car cheap driver
TEACHER WHOLLY TO BLAME!!
Ive  just seen this on the news! Have they pressed charges against the teacher yet? This is an act of aggression. If he got out and pushed him he would be in the wrong! Try sitting on a police car and see what happens!
Teacher was in Passive Mode (  Noob )
Teacher got what he deserved
why his pride would not let him park where he should and not where he wants .\nDriver decides its ok to risk kids and teachers safety by driving like a prat.\nany one who thinks this was/is ok is a complete and utter arse hole .
The teacher didn’t sit on the car bonnet cos I saw as I was the kid on the bike (on the right)
fuck of who says that shit ye sir can be anoying and m8 just cuz u got a big ass dog as ur profile pick don't make u a bad man I got a grate Dane so stop talking shit 
has to be a woman driving ...benefit mum had no dick last night ...Jeremy kyle fcking ppl
He didn't sit on the bonnet - he was forced on to the bonnet when the driver deliberately ran into him. The driver is a lunatic and should have his licence revoked.
I had the lovely soft thick hair that hardly needing washing for both of my pregnancies, it was so nice but be prepared for the hair loss afterwards , not everyone gets it but if it does happen there is loads of it
Awwww you have such a cute tummy 💗✨
You look amazing 😊
Omg I'm so late! Congrats Fleur!
,u\nOMum poiuuuu,l,bYn?\n\nFkkdJ\n,l,I\nJnjknn\n.llK,
Pregnancy books please!
Sciency pregnancy stuff!
Fleur I´d recommend you to use only creams your obstetrician allows you at pregnancy. Its ingredientes penetrates your skin, and flows trough your vascular system, ending in the fetus. Kisses!
Would love to see a video on beauty ingredients to avoid whilst pregnant please 😊
Loved this!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your are absolutely beaming Fleur!!
You are so gorgeous
You look so happy and radiant :)\nTry the Bio Oil, its a natural product and really cheap :) *
Makeup is on point! Please do a tutorial \nThe eyes and lipstick is gorgeous 😍
Stunning make up, could you give us your products used especially your lip colour its absolutely what i would go for.Thanks,
Who are these magical unicorns out there that don't have to wash your hair everyday??? I so don't understand how that is a thing. And that was even before I started hitting the gym four times a week.
Ugh. Your videos always make me realise that I need to be more of a 'grown up'... 🙈
I’m sorry but £22 on Conditioner and shampoo is ridiculous but love your channel ❤️❤️❤️
Pls pls pls can I beat my brother In a bet and get 100 subs in 2 days xxx
Omg I miss my pregnant glossy thick hair. It's been falling out in clumps post birth 😩 I look forward to seeing what you do at this stage even though it will be a bit late for me by then. Love your videos! X
in fact green tea has a lot of caffeine ;)
ohhhh I love your lipstick and your nail colour here. What are they? Beautiful. I have similar colouring to you and I find it difficult to find things that suit me.
I'm 35 weeks pregnant and have been using retinoid almost every night 😧
Absolutely adore following along your pregnancy journey! Loved the video! :) x
What nail polish are you wearing fleur? 😍
Oh man when I was pregnant I felt like the biggest grease ball in the world. Like they say oh you have that pregnancy shine I was like no it's just grease! It sucked...you look amazing!!!
You should really do your eye cream/serum before your regular face moisturizer, otherwise your eye area won't absorb the eye cream properly, so you're just waisting time and money. Caroline says (;
You shouldn't use the ro's argan body conditioner (though I know it smells incredibly good) it is made with parabens. If it is dangerous for everybody, it is especially for pregnant women... 😟\n(Please like the comment so that she can be aware of it)
You are just a few more weeks pregnant than me and all of your videos are perfectly timed for me to make some discoveries and incorporate in time 😊 love your videos! Xx
Your so pretty !!!  Love seeing a part of your life 😻
I usually don’t thumbs up anything...I don’t know why really. It’s just not something I do. But I thumbs upped this video :) i know you were feeling a little weird showing your belly, but this whole pregnancy just suits you. You look SO gorgeous! Glowing and happy :3 I’m so happy for you Fleur 💜
Love your rings and nail polish...
Really loving these videos! whenever I see one in my subscription box I watch them before anything else.
The clip of you wipping away your makeup in your PJs, and petting Piglet... oh my - It was so cute. I made me warm and fuzzy inside :)  :)   :)
I used the lush conditioners throughout both my pregnancies and I got no stretch marks and I was sure I would get them as my mum has them really bad from her pregnancies. Was so shocked I didn't as my first was 9lb 3 and I am a only a uk size 8!!! I also loved lush Therapy massage bar used to just use it on my bump it was so lovely!!! It's such an amazing feeling being pregnant so jealous of u right now lol trying to talk my hubby into having a third!!! But he isn't having it lol. Enjoy the amazing journey xx
Would love to know what base you're wearing here! Your skin looks absolutely amazing x
Hi Fleur more reading suggestions for you, check out 1. supernatural childbirth and 2.God's plan for pregnancy
list of baby pregnancy/ baby books you are reading! have you read any good parenting books that you can recommend?
If you like the Eve Lom cleansing balm I would 100% recommend using the Emma Hardie Moringa cleansing balm, it smells so heavenly and melts makeup in seconds, leaves skin feeling really plump, soft and nourished, definitely my favourite way to cleanse my face both morning and evening.\nFab video as always, loving watching you grow and glow with your pregnancy!😍❤️
The l'occitane almond shower oil was my saviour when pregnant. So nourishing and not one stretch mark. Every midwife I saw at checkups etc complimented me on my smooth preggo belly!
Hey fleur, just wanted to let you know that the link to the Amazon pillow isn't working x
I never got stretch marks with either of my pregnancies but my friend had them really bad on the bottom of her back of all places, might be worth taking your cream all the way round your bump!
You look fab! Keep doing what your doing and it was great to see your bump...so exciting!
Idk why but you seem so shy and reserved in this video 🤔😂 love from austria 💜
Your hair looks amazing! Did you use something new?
They say you should drink green tea two hours after you've eaten because it prevents the body from absorbing iron during digestion.
Yes stretch marks are genetic unfortunately for me :'( It didn't matter WHAT I did. I ate extremely healthy, drank TONS of water, and used every oil/cream I could get my hands on.  I couldn't prevent them with my daughter and they are horrible. I'm fine with other people being empowered by them, but I certainly don't feel that way. It's just a part of being a mom for me and I'm cool with it.
Definitely do a video on the books you've read!!
What is on your nails? 😍
I think this video could be so much better if it were in tutorial form! 😊☺️
Watching your videos is so relaxing. You have a calming voice and the editing is so professional...
people I know have always told me that when ur pregnant some babies can be more active in the night and the time they are more active is the time they are more likely to be born
💖 It's been wonderful to see you doing so well, you're looking absolutely beautiful and radiant.  💖
You should try the therapy massage bar from lush. It was designed for pregnant women to help prevent and fade stretch marks and it absorbs super quick in to the skin.
congrats fleur! so excited for you on your motherhood journey!
In my country,.green tea is one of black list products. It has something that can affect baby heart rythm and development.
The more pregnancy videos the better!!lol my husband and i are trying for a first for a few months now and i just love watching all your video! You're so inspiring! Cant wait to see what you journey has in store for you and Mike!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love these pregnancy videos! Your so lucky, I'm pregnant and my hair is the complete opposite, greesy and is weak and falling out! I used to have lovely thick hair before pregnancy xx
Yes please to the recommended baby books!
Hello Fleur. I hope you'll create a video on which makeup are paraben free that is safe to use while pregnant and breastfeeding. Im looking at MAC products but I according to blogs, not all are paraben free. Thanks!
As a mom of four, I'm really looking forward to your version of this video as a new mom! I know you'll get REALLY creative with paring down skincare and makeup to the absolute essentials when you've got a baby hollering for you in the next room!! Enjoy your pregnancy!! Breathe in the last few months of knowing you can properly pamper yourself without feeling guilty! I miss it so much. ❤️
LOVE this super comprehensive drugstore favorites list, THANK YOU! I started using the Loreal Pro-Matte foundation a couple years ago based on your recommendation and although I've waffled a few times to try other things, it's honestly still my favorite go-to. (And, just cause I saw some weird comments on them, I love your lenses! You do you, girl) ;) xoxo
I loved my hair during my pregnancies. It was full, healthy and shiny. My 3rd baby is 10 months old now and my hair has been falling out for months and it looks like someone poured oil on my scalp😔 I hope it doesn’t happen to you!
I need to try the Lush body conditioner! Looks amazing!x
Put some of the stretch mark butter on your back as well! I was sure I wouldn't get stretch marks because my mum never had them but low and behold at around 30 weeks pregnant, I noticed stretch marks appearing on the sides of my back and then eventually got them on my tummy but once they appeared, they literally get bigger every single day and Im 37 weeks now and covered haha! I love them though in a weird way they make me feel proud of my growing baby! Love this video!
Please do a video on pregnancy books! I have been looking for recommendations!
Fleur What a great video! Thanks for it! I also wake up much earlier now,  around 6 am. For the First time ever, no need To set the alarm:) id love To see a post on pregnancy books ! I am currently 23 weeks, just behind you:) and love your pregnancy content!😘😘❤❤ congratulations and take care beautiful!
I think you should be okay making a dedicated video for the books :)
Thoroughly enjoying this pregnancy series. Please could you do one on your meals. Are there certain foods you can't stand and others you crave for.
I used palmers on my tummy when I was pregnant and didn't get any stretch marks whatsoever despite my mother and both sisters having them (even my sis with no kids).
I'm not even pregnant but loved hearing about your moisturisers - my legs are super dry and I have growth stretch marks across my bum.. so might have to try some of these!
This makes me realise how much I'm neglecting myself this time around! I know I've already got two little ones, but I've really struggled to even moisturise at the moment. I'm 16 weeks on Tuesday, and the second I start to feel better I'm taking a leaf out of your book! You are looking lovely by the way. Such a glowy 🤰🏻lady! xx
You look so happy! And there's a new quality to your voice, softer and just lovely. The baby is so lucky to have you as her mum! Loved this video! xx
Do you still take your vitamins?? I am 26 weeks pregnant and around 20 weeks (i think) my doctor told me I don't need to take my vitamins (mine were called elevit) anymore cause they had done their job. Was a nice relief as they made me so constipated! :( I'm also allowed one coffee a day :) xx
By the way Dr Hauschka stretch mark oil is just phenomenal
I'm 13 weeks pregnant and have struggled with Hyperemesis, sadly. But I'm hoping it tapers off soon so I can use some of these products and take better care of my skin! It's so hard right now, where smells make me sick and almost everything has a scent. And ontop of that, I'm just not feeling well enough to be able to do all of that. This inspires me, though and helps me to really look forward to my pregnancy-- I'm hopeful that my Hyperemesis doesn't last too much longer! Love your pregnancy vids, Fleur. Ps. When you told everyone of your pregnancy, I had just found out I was pregnant and I was soooo thrilled to be pregnant at the same time as you (first pregnancy, too.) Because now I get Fleur de Force pregnancy vids! Talk about a real treat ;)
Same on the body clock thing! 6:30am without fail. It was one of the first symptoms and I've never been a morning person before, it's so strange!
There is a special line which I also used when I was pregnant it is called 9 moins by Mustela it is very good and they have oils as well . Whithout any chemicals or parabens it is really nice.
I loved the Burts Bees mama bee cream when pregnant. Not sure if they sell in the UK
Hi Fleur, with regards to the stretch marks I wanted to recommend Retin-Oil by The Chemistry Brand after you had your baby. I have massive stretch marks on my bust for more then 10 years. This is the only oil that makes a difference. Love you, beautiful xxx
This might be a stupid question, but do pregnancy bumps feel like the skin is burning sometimes where the skin is stretching, or is it so gradual that it doesn't hurt?
No wonder your skin is glowing!! So many moisturizers! ;P I seriously need to up my moisturizing game. \nWould love to see a vlog about your book recommendations and just a daily pregnancy vlog update! :) your tummy is definitely showing! <3\nHave you made any changes in your diet since being pregnant? For nutritional reasons or cravings?
You will have the best hair of your life when pregnant! I had amazing hair for my entire pregnancy! However, around 4 months post baby my hair fell out, and I had bald spots! It doesn't happen to everyone, but it's one of those things no one tells you about! It's growing back now (my daughter is 6.5 months old) but for a while I thought I would need to wear a wig!!
Can you please film a 'baby names I love but won't be using video' 🙊
Love the positive vibe going on here.. #teampreggyfleur
you should try L'occitane Almond shower oil!
Highly recommend skipping. The pregnancy books and reading about breastfeeding and baby development. Because you are far to tired and to late to read them when baby arrives.
Is iron ever a problem for pregnant women, since they're not menstruating?
hi Fleur , looking beautiful as usual. \nJust to tell you, the Pai pregnancy oil duo is amazing as well. Used it for my both pregnancies, no stretch mark in site . Don't know how much was luck , but still wanted to share :)
vitamins are 3 for 2 in boots just to let anyone know <3
I give all of your videos a like before I  even watch them... just because I LOVE your videos 💕😊
Hi Fleur love your channel I just want to recommend a gel breast pad we get in Australia. Called Rite Aid Hydrogel Breast Discs. They were incredible to use when I had my daughter. They are so amazingly soothing. I am in Australia so I hope you would get them in the UK somewhere or find something similiar, love your channel!
your makeup look in this video is gorgeous! I would love a tutorial on it!
Congratulations on your pregnancy! Yes, please do a pregnancy Vlog once in awhile and/or post more on your blog! My husband & I are hoping  to get pregnant within the next couple of years, and would love to follow your journey. I've been following your channel for a long time & am so excited for you! Best wishes!  ^_^
Careful with green tea because of the caffeine! One of them makes me jittery haha. 34 weeks pregnant and cannot wait to not be pregnant! SPD sucks :( you look gorgeous xxx
LOVED this video Fleur, thanks so much. Loved the cut-a-ways of you using the products etc. You are looking more beautiful every time xxxx
I'm not pregnant, but I LOVE these videos!
I LOVE your pregnancy vids, please do as many as you can stomach XD
I noticed once i got prgnant, my internal clock was waking me up earlier as well! Its so strange. Maybe thats why pregnant women need all the naps!
Did anyone notice the zoella and pb top which zoe was wearing!!
Are you going Tullys farm this year?
Love when you all get to hang out together! This is getting me excited about vlogging going to the pumpkin patch next month! 🙊🎃
Wait was Zoe wearing a PB + Zoella t-shirt at the start?
I got the iphone 8+ yesterday for my birthday and I started crying because I thought I was just getting a 6+
anyone notice Alfie’s green top!?!?!!
Boyfriend goals right there
your such a sweet guy bought Zoe I phone 8 and I love the games you play looks like awesome birthday also, sorry about your acid reflects;(( hope you feel better peace and love
I suffer with really bad reflux also. Try not to eat carbonated drinks, chocolate, fruit juice, or tomatoes. They really flare acid.
Was that a pb x zoella top I just saw
iPhone moment at 4:07
I love the 8+. Such a big upgrade from the 6S I had.
Alcohol is really bad for acid reflux, so your 12 cocktails the night before may have been a contributing factor. I suffer with chronic acid reflux too. It's awful.
7:12 expect an epic vlog from Zoe soon 😂
That is a wasp!!
WHAT is this game called???
i also have really bad acid re-flux with painful flare ups.\nYour vlogs always help me to feel better though :D have a great day Alfie!! <3
Hey Alfie, I've got acid reflux in pretty much the SAME way as you! Teva-Pantoprazole Magnesium is a medication I take daily that has made my acid reflux completely go away as long as I take them every day. Just thought I'd suggest it to you in case you'd ever think to ask your doctor about it!
Did anyone else see Joes shirt at 14:54?
Does anyone not see joes shirt😂
Oh so want that phone!! #LBW where you at???
You always make your vlogs so interesting ❤️
did anyone else notice josh's face on joe's tshirt??? lolllll
I want a relationship like them 😫😞
Alfie just brightens up my day ☺️💗 can this be a shoutout or? 😙
Is that your new house😍
Omgggg on the boxes, there was written zizzi and in French, the word zizi means willy 😂
Be careful. If it's an Asian hornet ! They are dangerous
I looked through my subscription and I overlooked the title and I thought it said 18+ 😂
Did anyone catch the PB and Zoella merch at 5:28
WHEN R U GOING TO UPLOAD TO UR MAIN CHANNEL?! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR LIKE A MILLENNIUM!
I love how you guys call each other 'gorgeous' 🤣💕💖
Tanya's figure is amazing. Love your vlogs Alfie xx
Such a lovely gang of friends! ☺️
#LBW sqaud🎉5pm is litrally the best part of my day👅
Alfie I suffer with the same thing u have got! It's not very nice though I hate it xx
Omg Alfie have his lock screen pictures of Zoe !!!!!
Surprise David Parker with a iPhone 8+
The pumpkins make me feel soo fall!!
Have not watched the vlogs in soooo long. Finally been able to catch up on all my subscriptions! When the heck did Zoe and Alfie move????
Next video surprising zoe with the iphone x
sounds harsh but should of killed the hornet, they kill honey bees.
What is that awesome balloon game!?
you need a electric bug zapper
Bruh I swear if my dad catched that bee he would've killed it lmao.
Tell me why he looks like Ryan from teen mom lol
That’s Japanese!! alfie!! (The first screen of your new phone )
I would have killed the shiz out of that bee
Great shots on the drone - they've got to be your best yet!
Drink the Aloe vera juice  (the INNER FILET ONLY) It will snuff acid reflux out! I use FRUIT OF THE EARTH brand.
Aw ): Alfie, I really hope you're feeling better :) xoxo!
That is the biggest bee I have ever. Seen!!!
Please can you do a video on how you edit your photos for insta and some photography videos?
From eBay you can get a humane spider/insect catcher. It's like a sort of cup with a sliding base on the end of a stick and you can carry them away without hurting them. I think they're less than £5
can someone surprise me with an iphone too
My phone just broke, fancy buying me the new iPhone, Alfie :))))))
I'm in love with the shape of your balloon, push the pokie thing in more
Please bring out the tops u were wearing and do them as a pair so u can buy a pink and green one in a set or individualy
I used to have major reflux until I started taking digestive enzymes! Prescription strength acid blockers didn't work but these little capsules somehow do the trick. Their called Source Naturals Daily Digestive Enzymes (Bio Align) and they are meant to be taken with every meal/when you eat. Idk if you can get them in the UK but it's worth a try :-)
Switching to a Whole Food Plant Based Diet cured my cronic GERD. Took a few months but no more meds...worth a try.
Alfie - There is a surgical procedure that fixes reflux.  It's a Nissen Fundoplication.  The doc surgically tightens where the food goes in your stomach.  I had it.  Changed my life.  Can eat anything with no pain.  Good luck to you.

Do you actually /need/ to get down to fewer than 16 t-shirts? Maybe you do because of limited storage, but I don't think you should put yourself through the stress of getting rid of something you love and do wear just for the sake of achieving an ideal number.
I don't think 16 shirts makes you a t-shirt hoarder at all! You love to wear them, so it makes total sense to have a few of them (and again, 16 is not like a huge amount!). For me it seems absolutely fine to keep all of them, doing some kind of rotation system, or, if you really want to reduce, keep track of wich ones you wear the least ( and if those are the ones designed by your friends, or having some other sort of emotional value, make something else out of them! Like framing one like a picture, or sewing a t-shirt-quilt (i did that, it's awesome!)) Loved the video, please keep us updated! xx
YAS, LOOKBOOK, PLS. I love your style and I feel quite identified with some parts of it, and I was waiting for something like this to happen!!
YES LUCY! This video is literally like porn for me X
I'm currently working on refining my wardrobe ~ I'm slowly donating or passing onto friends (my local charity shops love me 😆). Autumn is just about a big oversized orangey - maroon jumper with black skinny jeans or leggings and a black or burgandy pinafore with tights and boots for me.
Lucy, I tend to have the exact same problem with wanting to keep sentimental t-shirts. Sadly, because I have a shorter torso, normal shaped t-shirts look really weird on me because they are either too long or too bunchy, so I never get around to wearing them. But I still really want to preserve those memories. Ive found online that some people turn their old t-shirts into quilts! You can still enjoy all of the memories associated with them without having to actually wear them. Maybe that is a possible solution to your t-shirt problem?
For tshirts, something that I have done (which isn't for everyone) is made them into a quilt! My friend took my shirts and made them into squares then makes the back out of fleece and for me it's the perfect mix of keeping sentimental shirts but paring down my clothes
I wear a uniform for work, and work three to four days a week. on days I work I dont do anything else (ie, no need for real people clothes on those days) so I really only need 3-4 outfits for every season. realizing that was pretty much life changing.
How do you accidentally buy something?
Love this! Planning my capsule wardrobe now😂 x
if you like capsule wardrobe and fashion channels i recommend justine leconte. She is a french designer who makes quick and concise videos about fashion and one of her series is about capsule wardrobes.
Oh my gosh! WHERE is the pink coat from? ❤️❤️❤️
Have you considered making something like a quilt out if your t shirts you adore but don't necessarily want to wear constantly? Like a t shirt quilt or tapestry? Combine textures and other squares that go with your t shirts into a quilt type thing to snuggle with or hang in a room? Just a thought!
With the T-shirts, have a weekly or fortnightly rotation. You'll find you wear those you often don't reach to more often without having to scale the collection down!
If I have too many items that I love but they won't all fit in one wardrobe rotation, I store them then at the beginning of the next season I'll swap out the ones I really love, and if there's any I'm not keen on wearing/haven't worn at all THEN I'll donate them, that way I know I won't wear them and I feel less guilty about it :)
please do a lookbook once you have it organised x
Damn trending Lucy!!!! Wooooo, such a great video so highly deserved x
what colour are you getting nathan zed's tshirt in? (sorry if its a weird question but i was curious if it goes with ur colour scheme)
Could you do a video abt fuckboys part II? im living for those
It would mean the world to me if your could subscribe to my channel!! Xx 😘
Pls pls pls can I beat my brother In a bet and get 100 subs in 2 days xxx
A big mistake a lot of people make when doing capsules is that they discard items that do not fit into their capsules. If you are not feeling hot pink right now - put them away and in february, check if you are feeling them for early spring, for example. If you like an item but it does not fit into your capsule *right now*, it might in a year or 5. I bougth a pair of trousers in 2014 that fit perfectly with my FW17/18 capsule... It takes time to find what fits you so you are bound to experiment along the road.
i love this video & i don't really know why
Hi Lucy! I have a few questions :) when you build a capsule wardrobe, does it work for all seasons? or is it like okay this is my capsule wardrobe for winter and this my wardrobe for spring? I've seen people limiting themselves to a number of pieces (like 52, 30) and I don't know if shoes are counted in too. Loved the video, I'm looking forward to the next one! :)
I used to exclusively wear jeans as bottoms, but then I watched Begin Again and Keira Knighley's effortless and supercool way to pull off smarter trousers opened my eyes to a whole new world. Check it out, Lucy!
where's that gorgeous pink coat from?!😍
Try the pureple app, its a wardrobe app, you add photos of your clothes which helps you keep track of what you own, you can create or be suggested outfits and that helps to see what you actually wear or not, ive had this app for years and i swear by it
I'm sure someone has already said but what about making a blanket out of your excess tshirts? Pinterest will have great examples no doubt!
Who says you can't wear all black all the time? lol. \nThis is a neat idea. I'll be interested to see the final result!
Lucy be careful of making rules for yourself. It's your wardrobe, if you want a secret 3 bright pink things, then do that. There's no rules if you think about it.
bro i couldn't get my eyes of her frickin lips i feel like a bird ~sHi~Ny~~
PLEASE do a look book
I get if you want to wear them, but you could always frame a t-shirt or two that your friends designed.
i think you're putting unnecessary pressure on yourself about the amount of things you can have. i'm the same way with my tshirts, and that's ok. if it's something that brings you joy, or you feel good in, or means something to you... keep it! and don't pack them away! you love them and you'll wear them, so they get to stay. don't worry about it so much.
I've learnt about capsule wardrobing from Justine Leconte (she's an incredible fashion youtuber, definitely recommend) but I've been waiting until summer to do my capsule wardrobe for two reasons: firstly, Australia doesn't really have 4 seasons.... autumn and spring just consists of alternating summer and winter days or weeks (it's not a stable temperature), and secondly, I'll be finished with my uni semester in November so I'll have more time to do it. I also have a new wardrobe which I don't have the space for so when I start sorting through my clothes, I'll ditch my current one (and maybe my clothes rack since I have no space for it) and buy a small chest of drawers.
i have the same problem with t-shirts! i have so many that have sentimental value to me and for that reason i'm not willing to part with them, but at the same time i don't wear them as much as a person with a ton of shirts should! i've been thinking of making a t-shirt quilt out of them, bc that way it's clearing out my closet, but i still get to keep the t-shirts around in a useful way.
If you could get someone to send them to you, I feel like you could live in these pants https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-italian-goweave-easy-pant-black?collection=womens-bottoms
i'm debating whether or not to treat myself to a new pair of doc martens next month... my current pair are over five years old and were mistreated throughout high school, so there are holes in the heels and the leather is all cracked. i'd love a new pair but i'm not sure i'll wear them enough to justify their cost, especially considering they can't function as my winter boots because it's way too cold and snowy where i live. we'll see whether or not i get them lol. i also need to go through my clothes again and be harsh in getting rid of things i don't wear and that don't fit me. i've gained like 20 pounds in the last two years so i have a lot of old jeans and shirts that don't fit at all but are still in my dresser taking up space. that'll be a task for.... whenever i have some time to kill, which lbr is a rarity for a uni student who also has a part time job
Excited for the sequal of whatever this is :)
This video has inspired me to do something about the explosion of clothes in my room, so thank you! haha Also I love the way you organised the whole thing starting with what you regularly do and what outfits you need for those things and going from there. Maybe I will reach that point in my organisational skills someday lol
Have you considered making a t-shirt quilt? You still get to keep the designs and the memories they bring without having them take up much room in your closet
It's 30+ degrees weather over here in Toronto dont ask me how
Not a very interesting video,
I have Nathan Zeds good enough t-shirt in the post too 😂
your style is absolutely stunning, you inspire me so much
is a jumper like a sweatshirt/sweater?
if you love them keep them! It's all about having stuff you love and will actually use, not just getting your wardrobe down to a specific number.
u should put some of th ones u dont rlly wear on depop !!!
Fab video! I feel like it would be a bit more engaging if you did some b roll of what you're talking about & the process!\nLoved the video and I hope there's more capsule ones to come xx
I would recommend to be flexible about the item number or pieces. If you really like and use tshirts you don't need to get rid of them just to fit in the capsule wardrobe standard. This is a really marvelous concept but I think one should adapt it to it's own needs and taste. Good luck!
It's so refreshing to see a practical take on reconfiguring a wardrobe/closet! I had to do this when I started my job several years ago and now I like to think shopping is a matter of plugging in holes and thinking carefully before making purchases (my impulse only seem to be things I've stalked for months or years).\n\nI also have had your problem regarding the fit of pants and jeans and learned that a good tailor completely solved the problem so am so happy you've sent some stuff off! I had the same gaping waist/sagging crotch issue and the tailor made them fit perfectly each time. It's annoying that so many pants/jeans seem to be constructed in a way that do not accommodate normal hips, but I'm grateful to have a good and decently priced tailor around. A good cobbler is also life changing for maintaining shoes and boots!
Not to give away my secrets but if you want recommendations light before dark is THE place for semi casual trousers
I love the idea of a capsule wardrobe but it seems like so much work, plus I'm at university so I have zero money for clothes. Your capsule wardrobe so so nice, you should some fashion videos once you get it all sorted. X
Since you have good music taste, what's your opinion about this good track, Lucy Moon?\nThe Midnight - Crystalline\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4iLX7eWwmE
i think with your t-shirt problem you could keep them all at least for a while and even switch them up during the 3 month capsule cycle. this way it might help if you ever get the feeling you want to buy a new t-shirt. cause then you can just go the ones you already own and switch things up. even old stuff feels like new when it's been out of your sight for awhile. after awhile i'm sure you'll notice if there are ones that you never really feel like including into your capsule. and then it might be easier to get rid of those.
wow i'm such a  t-shirt hoarder as well 😩 this vid has kinda inspired me to do a t-shirt clear out this week hahah
I just love people talking about style/clothes
I got so many jumpers on new looks sale page! have a look :)
Could we switch parts of our wardrobe, I have WAY too many jumpers (around 20...) but not that many basic t-shirts.
if your looking for good quality more affordable jumpers try pull and bear x
I really like the way you structured this video. The information is specially well divided and chosen in this one. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but I so bloody appreciated it.
Love it! So captivated by the idea of a capsule wardrobe... thinking I might need to give it a go!? xoxo, Caylie
100% backing this idea!! It's so good for the environment and your creativity 💕 also, can't wait for hauls and lookbooks. And I would recommend a cashmere jumper as one of your three purchases, they are a god send 🙌🏻
omg but where is the pink coat from??
Yesss I really needed this! Looking forward to the next video :)
First I want to say I LOVE YOUR T-SHIRT!!!!1 I just brought myself a pinafore and im in love with it!!!! \nAlso, id love to see an overview of your bullet journal!!!
loved this vid!!!\nif you don't want to get rid of t-shirts, but don't want to wear them, you could make them into tote bags or cushions so that you get use out of them?
lucy i love this kind of video! having a curated wardrobe is so appealing to me. would love if you showed more of the items or made a full video showing all of the clothes in your autumn wardrobe later in the season! also would really love a video about your bullet journal <3
Get your sweaters from boohoo. I got two maybe 3-4 years ago, payed them 15-20 euros and they are still as good as new.
I think you should put im just a t shirt hoarder on a t shirt
Nothing much to say except I really enjoyed this video and looking forward to the lookbook 💕
You can save the T-Shirts that really mean something to you, but you don't wear often, and get them made into a quilt. That way you still have them, but they are actually used.
This is so interesting! I've always wondered about and secretly wanted a capsule wardrobe, but as an 18 yr old broke student who doesn't really know their personal style yet I don't think it's achievable for me. Can't wait to see what you collate though!!
Loved this, I can't wait to see your wardrobe & I love your shirt :)
Would love a look book please! X
I got myself a suedey burgundy jacket and a b e a u t i f u l lacey slip dress to go over t-shirts for my autumn wardrobe
This satisfies my anxiety so much, might just do it myself. Also love how calming your personality is? Idk you seem so peaceful, it's a thing. Good luck on your closet journey!
Loved this viedo thanks for the inspirations!!
Just keep the t-shirts!!!! A capsule should serve your needs and NOT restrict you, if you like wearing them often thats fine, just give away the ones you dont wear or doesnt suit you 100%! for the future shop tshirts more intentionally. You dont have to have a certain number of things to have a real capsule. :)
i was in such a bad mood but this made me much happier yay
Put your t shirts in storage/ out of the way. Think of it as giving them a break so they last longer. Then next season go through them and it'll feel like you're shopping!
Whats your haircut called ?
This has inspired me so, so much to try out a capsule wardrobe. Your tips were so helpful, Lucy. X
I've been working on the same thing! I'm the same way with t-shirts. If they're graphic tees you can hire someone to make you a t-shirt quilt. I had it made with all of my school shirts and memories and things I was holding onto. The back is lined in fleece and it's super cozy! Could be a good way to keep the memories of the shirts but turn them into something new :)
A channel that you might like all about fashion, focusing particularly on capsule wardrobes is Justine Leconte Official. She's a french fashion designer and her videos are super duper helpful!!
I miss your discussion videos
looovvveee this so excited to see the result <3
i need to do this, please do another video after this section of building a capsule wardrobe
Lovely video, Lucy! <3
Lucy 💕✨🌸
Check out Longchamp for smarter trainers!
I make all of my own clothes because that avoids the human exploitation/sweatshop element of lots of popular brands, and also makes me think carefully about what I really need. This season I'm making black jeans, a grey blazer and a colourful blazer, a nice black shirt, and some leggings for layering.
Hey girl! If you're shopping on the high street for mom jeans it's almost impossible to get a good fit, my tip would go vintage or second hand, the quality and fits are way better. I usually go for the men's section and get a levis 504 or 505 but it's really about finding the best shape for you, I'd also size up one or two sizes as the denim is mostly non stretch. Just thought it might be worth a mention because it can be really hard to have jeans tailored in a non obvious way, so excited for this project!!
Does anyone know where the baby pink fur coat is from? I've been looking for one for two years now and this one looks amazing! Thanks for your help :)Great video, Lucy!
Hope the fur was faux
get superga's for trainers! v cool but can be formal too xoxo
Slippers for around the house are also the best 10 pound investment that you'll ever make
If you don't watch The Anna Edit, I highly recommend it. She's got capsule wardrobe down to an art (albeit a pretty expensive one).
Besiktas will always be better
The best team in Turkey for Fenerbahce
I see no fans like this in England all we do is 'yeah'  'nooo'  'goal' this is passion!
Dünyaya bizi rezil eden şerefsiz hakem palaremzi
The ref done ok if you ask me. The Besiktas goal was ruled offside by the linesman. \nThe ref should have given a pen to Besiktas but apart from that he was spot on.
This REF is PURE GOLD...For Barcelona in a future El Clasico !!!
Fuckinh cunt ref. Fucming piece of shit, fucking siding with Fenerbahce, god fucking knows who promised him to fuck him after a game, fucking eh, fucking corrupted cunt, low groundlicking scumbag, fucking red cards are you fucking serious??!!!! And only one side?!!!! Get the fuck out of here!!!!!
The biggest Fenerbahçe👊👊\nFenerbahçe will be champion💪💛💙💛💙
Huhahahaha that is fener baby, always wins the derbys (almost :))
Why is everyone complaining about the ref lol? I don't like Fenerbahce but the refree got it all right honestly. Quaresmas both fauls were yellow worthy therefore red card = correct decision. Medel clearly pushed Jansen for the penalty = correct decision. First Fener red is also correct, Tosun is denied a clear goal scoring opportunity and is the last man. Second Fener red is a two footed tackle no matter how much contact it had that is always a red. Hutchinson clearly touched the ball with his hand for the second penalty and had a yellow earlier so second yellow and a pen is correct. Only decision which I disagree is the offside one when Negredo scored, but that was probably the linesman's call
Oh my days that ref is shocking, should be killed after that
As an experienced player, Quaresma shouldn't lose his cool so easily
Hats off to the ref.
lol this ref is a clown.
Only thing missing is a dead cow on fire thrown on the pitch
Turkish league is a joke
Imagine  how pepe felt how can there be 5 red cards and i didn't  get one
The worst league on the world.absolutelly terrible players.rubish fotball
But why turkey is always in the UK trending??
I have to say, Red cards on last defender foul and rough tacle were OK. But Quaresma and Hutchinson second yellow card, no way.....
Is this football or rugby?
The real secret of magic lies in the performance (Chinese Boys)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5uhUade4IM
Two years ago besiktas beat fener 3-2 where besiktas scored a goal which was offside and fenerbahce was not given a clear penalty. Refs making mistakes is a part of football. Bjk fans r making it a big deal because they haven’t beat fener at kadikoy for 14 years😂😂

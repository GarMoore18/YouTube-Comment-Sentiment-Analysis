Any Apple haters here? If there are, *facepalm* OK.
You could buy a MacBook Air for the price of the base model Pixelbook with basically the same specs.
For the one click tethering, while it was super useful when apple first came out with it it is kind of irrelevant now. All you have to do is swipe up on iPhone to control centre (and I think swipe down on android?) to turn on personal hotspot and since the computer remembers the WiFi network it will automatically connect.
I pity the students that lived the Android/chrome OS life and enter the business world looking for a job.
Too many poor people in the comments , sad for them.
Who puts their  phone face  down anyway?
Aaaand it just got outdated because intel launched the 8th gen laptop CPUs.
If  they make these changes, I'll switch from my Razer Blade.\n\n-Dedicated GPU or Thunderbolt 3 for external GPU connection\n\n-1080p, 2k, or 4k but I believe 2k would be perfect for it's size. I use a Razer Blade and scaling has always been an issue with non-standard resolutions.\n\n-Bluetooth 5.0 (pairing multiple speakers)\n\n-Ability to add Window OS. I'm not asking it comes with it, just that I could install it side by side. I guess I could just use Linux.\n\n-Make a black version from aluminum.
So ugly and I honestly don‚Äôt see the point of it.
Might be easier to install android on Chromebooks by default and create a chrome os launcher an add some features
It looks so good, I wish you could run windows on it and use it as a proper laptop.
ChromeOS is so limited. Mad to pay so much for a Chromebook
If I want an expensive computer that only runs mobile apps, I'd just get an iPad Pro.
As stunning AS USELESS. \n\nDoes it give the option to install Windows? lol sorry Google, me too I don't like Microsoft, but maybe you can do something about it in 10 years.
I don't understand the purpose of this laptop. Unless Google is trying to compete with Apple and Microsoft with a *FULL* desktop OS. Which Chrome OS isn't that. I bought an Acer laptop off eBay for $300, it came with 8 GB of RAM (upgraded to 12 GB), 1 TB hard drive (upgraded to 500 GB SSD), Intel Core i5-5200u, and NVidia 940m graphics. And my Acer can do more than 10 times the thing the Google Pixelbook can do for more than half the Pixelbook's price
Would hack Linux on it anyway
That bezel in 2k17, lol.
$1,000 for Chrome OS tho?
I WANT ITTT
What is the point of a $1000 laptop that cannot run real desktop programs like Lightroom? Get an iPad Pro if you want this almost-laptop experience
google starting to be like apple too.
Man, I really wish i could use this, but I need muh Windows apps
I don't understand why anybody would get this thing. I guess linux lovers who just purely hates Mac and Windows? For that price, you might as well get a surface or MacBook. Google seems like is trying to copy Apple A LOT recently, and in a bad way. Pixel phone copied all the stuff I hate about iPhone such as no expandable storage, no flexibility (in terms of what you can get, unlike Samsung and LG who gives a lot of options) and no style. I don't buy a phone just because it looks like something else, which is iPhone design in this case, I buy phones only when there are unique things that really makes me bond, just like how you would love a long-term crush. I'd like to see a phone with the company's own flavours, like Samsung with TouchWiz and their stylish S8/note8 and A series devices, not just copying Apple.\nOn the pixel laptop, Pixel is copying 50% Surface 50% MacBook. Heck they even copied Apple's dongle and also fanless concept, hooray! Let's see if the Core i7 chip would desolder itself after a year or two of usage!\nMy suggestion: Go dump the money on a mid-spec Surface or Dell and dump the rest of the money on a Sandy bridge budget powerful pc!
I have Surface/MS products. How can this take the place of my Surface Book or Surface Pro? I'd like to know because I am thinking of changing everything from MS to Google because MS had abandoned their Windows platform and now abandoned Groove Music streaming, of which I loved. Disgusted in MS. I need Adobe services, need a replacement for Word, and most other things I use are apps, so??? Any thoughts? How is or WHAT is Chrome OS?
if only it ran windows lol, I might be interested.
It has a headphone jack - its a dealbreaker -  would buy it if id had the new features like not having a headphone jack like apple does it !
To manage and edit photography. Good on the go tool? or should i just go back to the mac?
Probably the nicest designed piece of hardware on the market right now
Great job as always, Dieter. Just wanted to throw in that I've been using, pretty much exclusively, the HP Chromebook 13 G1 for a year. It's close, not quite!...as nice as this new Objet Du Pixel save for no touchscreen and no 360 hinge. Two bummers when working with Chrome OS/Android Apps. It has a great keyboard and screen (3200x1800 snazzy) and if you're the sort of person, like many, who really does a great deal of writing in various forms on your computer, then it makes gobs of sense. The point you make about how useful android apps are is so true. Big issue for me is running applications that are staples on Mac or Windows, for me that means One Note for example, and being constrained to a web version on the Chromebook. Mine runs an i5 with 8gb of Ram, but the web experience of such Office is just...not. For the right person, and one who digs deep into Google apps, Drive, etc, it is a fantastically efficient way to go. Cheers.
This thing makes the 12‚Äù MacBook seem like a good buy
Can i code /programma with this? Like Android studio or visual code
Can you put linux in it?
No Microsoft Office? Sorry, no.
For that price I'd rather get a proper Windows or Mac laptop.
Welcome to the future, where everything sold by the major manufacturers is overpriced by $200-$500.
Can I install Ubuntu in it?
Can install windows?
i7 with Google Chrome is like an M16 that shoots BBs. \nPointless.
What?? It looks hideous
Isnt he the idiotic cable fold guy
Useless af
Bezels are too wide
Does this pixelbook has graphics card?
Does it support VR?
Literally copied Surfaces \n\n\n\n\n\nWtf?!
NEW GADGETS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3_qllJSfb8
prize?
The camera is ALWAYS moving. ALWAYS!
To all the people confused by this product, I think it's an obvious competitor to the Microsoft Surface Laptop. It's at the same price, but the pixelbook has better specs. The surface laptop has the gimped Windows 10 S which limits you to only being able to use apps from the Windows store, giving it pretty much the same functionality as Chrome OS.
Pixelbook without Internet = a piece of expensive metal
I just wanna know the song that starts playing at 4:45
Surface is the best.\n      The end
How is this different from Lenovo Yoga series!!??
even this has that stupid two-tone design with the glass half above, ugh
taco bell would NEVER do this\n\nare you sure about that rhett?
yo what happened to link at the end when he said subscribing. glitched right out
The amount of times Link left Rhett hanging in this episode XD
Wouldn‚Äôt Sauce Boss be better?
I like it better when they tell them the right answer after they answer so they can reevaluate their whole lives.
As you can see, we can't\n\n\n\n\nI should put that on a plaque
How about PB CUP taste test?
Watching Rhett and Link suck hot sauce off a gloved finger because pornhub was down. (I'm sorry)
There's a Jack in the Box 30 minutes away from my house, which also happens to be right by my favorite park. My favorite thing to do is drive up there, chill at the park, then get 4 tacos from JITB üòÇ I live in Ohio so they're not common at all, but I love their tacos.
I'm the best!\nNo, I'm the best!
as you can see we cant dunno why that cracked me up
You forgot to go over ur answers.
These guys just appreciate the taste of latex.
HOW AMAZING ARE THESE PEOPLE!!!!
When they said DelTaco and Taco Bell at the same time, I legitimately thought they said TacoTaco.
Get to Del Taco, they got somethin' called a fresha- free, FRE SHA VAC ADO!
J. K. Rowling for mom
If i had to respond to the qtmba, i would have to say it would have to be  hugh jackman. That's right i said something that was counter intuitive, but i wouldn't mind having a fatherly mother.
Love me some jack in the box tacos
Come on down to del taco and get your free sha vaca doo
I want Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) to be my mom. Nobody will mess with me at school.
Kate McKinnon for a mom
The first one....... FRE SHA VOCA DO
how dare they i love taco bell's fire sauce
fast food marinara sauce taste test? I was eating Sonic mozarella sticks and I thought about this lol
You need a fire pill
i thought that finger was flippping me off at first lol
I hope everything is okay between the two of them. I don't know why but something seems off after watching some of their videos. Is that just me??
I would want either Jennifer Garner or Kristen Bell

Isnt it  Frankensauce not Saucenstein
I would chose Kristen bell!but I still love my mom‚ù§Ô∏èand if I were to pick a dad it would be Chris Pratt
I think the weird thing is, is that I watch your videos at night but you say, good mythical morning üòí its kinda odd
you and link my mom and dad haha
Link: [due to mix of love & guilt, refuses to pick a celebrity mom]\nRhett: [without skipping a beat] I pick Cher\nXDD
Wouldn't the rubber glove mess with the taste
You should do a powdered food taste test, like if you agree.
Rhett looks like Burger King with that Crown
:\ I really really miss the Wheel of Mythicality skits. Improv comedy is one of Rhett & Link's funniest styles, why did they get rid of them?

This is something I would do. Where my hot sauce lovers at?
Okay lets make this clear, link is a duche. he does shti like this all the time... they spin the stupid wheel and it stops at QTMBA WICH IS LITTERALLY QUESTION THAT MUST BE ANSWERED!!! And link has the audacity to NOT ANSWER wtf burn in hell cuck link
Rent need to shave a littile
Anyone else miss the old intro lol
Will it casserole????
Can I borrow that finger for something? Asking for a friend.
Why do they even have any dislikes?
Aww, link didn‚Äôt want to pick a new mother ‚ù§Ô∏è\nThat was so adorable
Jennifer Lawrence would be a fun mom I reckon. Give her 10 years, I'll just say I told you so right now though

Hi

Selena Gomez
Omw I just sucked my finger üòÇüòÇ
Taco bell would never do that\n\nLol, it's taco bell
I hate Taco Bell hot sauce, gross and not hot.
You haven't lived until you've had the sauce from Taco Lita in Arcadia. It's not really hot, but it's the best on burritos and also pretty good on mac and cheese.
AS YOU CAN SEE WE CANT\ni love that üòÇ
haha it's the Uno gamo players inferno bulge

OMG BOJANGLES HAS TEXAS PETE SAUCE!? I found this stuff at Disney world and I am now OBSESSED

Love your channel! New subscriber. You are stunning!
I don't know if they make your shade in the fit me dewy, but the fit me dewy is really nice for drier skin
Love you nyma! It would mean the world if you checked out my channel you're such an inspiration! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I love what you play on the background.....

With YOUR pretty melanin self!! Love you girl...‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
In which shade did you have the maybeline fit me
Every time I watch one of your videos or see your Instagram I literally cannot get over how beautiful you are üíïüíïüíï
Where can i find L.A. Girl brand at??
Had to click cuz of that glow, but I have oily ass skin so I need all mattifying  stuff
I saw the thumbnail for this video and just wanted to stop by to say you have the most beautiful skin color :0\nyou look like a doll
I love watching your videos! Your makeup is literally flawless!!üòçüíì
There's 2 types of the fit me foundation. One matte, one dewy.
You're skin tone is absolutely stunning!!!! üòçüòçüòçüç´
U look like a delicious chocolate bar I just want to bite into...and I'm sooooooooooo not a lesbian. Keep up the good work hun ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
The first 2 are my holy grail right now (LA Girl in White and L'oreal W4, I combine them because I don't find my shade where I live...) Love your videos Nyma üòò
I love you chicka! I just saw you on Harry. I was screaming that's my girl!!!!! I am biased though, you look just like my future daughter in law. Keep up the great videos.
Girl what is that lip? ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
You look so beautiful here. Youre always pretty but today your glowing
There is a dewy + smooth fit me instead of the matte + poreless! i'm not sure if the shades are the same though
Hey Nyma I would love to see a video of you trying the darkest shade of Huda Beauty foundation
You are so beautiful nyma üíû much love from Florida ‚ù§Ô∏è
As an oily girl I LOVE the LA Girl foundation
This makeup look you are wearing in this video is life!!
Can you do a make up tutorial video for the look you have in this video? You are beautiful.
You are so beautiful! I found you through your Fenty review and I'm so glad I did!!! üòçüòç
OMG I just saw you on ‚ÄúHARRY‚Äù YouTube channel.  Congratulations for being on his show.
I am generally not fond of lashes\nBut I really loves yours\nIt really looks good on you
Take a shot every time she says foundation
Do they have the W10 in loreal one cause w stands for warm which would be more red which you will like. And if they also made the lumi one in 10w that you would love too
specifics on your nail color please? Thx
Yo I saw you on Harry the other day and nearly died from screaming. I'm so happy for your success
I literally love you!!
Girl I found u when when u had a lil bit of subscribers and I was so confused why u didn't have more cause ur content was amazing congrats ‚ù§Ô∏è
Girl what is that lippie?
I'm as dark as midnight myself and I don't wear makeup. But I'm glad there are options out there that don't stop at 11:30 p.m. Shout out to you, Jackie Aina, and toomuchmouth for representing.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It would be fantastic if you could do a video on Vasanti Cosmetics MatteCrush lipstick line!!!
Although sometimes I enjoy longer videos, I like that the majority of your videos are shorter. It‚Äôs nice to get to the point and watch something without needing to commit to 25-30 minutes.
TAKE A SHOT EVERY TIME NYMA SAYS FOUNDATION üíö
my Walmart sells shades for deeper skin and toy don't know how excited I was when I walked into walgreens and they had all shades of the true match
I use the Fit Me in 360.I like it but its not really my color around my jaw line I feelbitsca little ashy. I would love to try LA Girl but they don't sale that around here üòí #GETWITHTHEPROGRAM
Perfect! Short and to the point
You‚Äôre beautiful!üòçThanks for this video!
Can you talk about your tattoos please? I'm dark skin and been always wanting to get a tattoo but scared cause it won't show. I love your tatts
your skin looks so glowy!! üíï sending you lots of love
What is in your lips it looks amazing!
She is so fucking beautiful I can‚Äôt üò≠üòç
girl you might want to adjust the white balance of your videos so your eyes don't look yellow hehe
I'm watching Nyma's videos even though I'm white. I like her personality, how she's not your typical beauty guru. I don't know, I just really enjoy watching her videos even though I'm not her target demographic. Keep up the good work Nyma‚ù§Ô∏è
GURL whats your lip i need it üëÅüëÑüëÅ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è love you nyma
You're so pretty and your voice is so soothing üòå
I deffo think that the NYX drop foundation must have a different formula for the deeper shades. I'm the lightest shade (pale) and it is super drying and is horrible on my dry skin RIP. I really enjoy your videos Nyma!!
I feel you on how it's hard to find foundations to match because I have a really yellow undertone and when I find a great one from the drugstore I think that'll match me it either turns out to be wayyy to pink on me even though it looks yellow tonish. The only one foundation that seems to match me good is milani conceal n perfect in #1 but it feels to heavy on the skin for me so that's why I'm kinda bummed out. Even the maybelline one I cannot find my correct shade üíîüíîüíî
This is such a great and important video!  I read online that sometimes mom and pop drugstores don‚Äôt stock darker shades because they‚Äôre afraid that people who use those shades would shoplift.
you look so gorgeous, you should do a tutorial on this look!
You always look beautiful but you look even more gorgeous than ever in this video. That glow is to die for üòç
Girl, why my dry skin doesn‚Äôt look like yours? You‚Äôre glowing, I just look dehydrated üòÇ
Do you have any recommendations for oily skin? üòÖ I'm personally not a fan of the Fit Me.
I know there is a lot of self-hate in the black community. But let me just say, as a light-skinned/high-yellow black woman I think you are absolutely GORGEOUS! I wish I had beautiful, rich skin like yours. Absolutely stunning! Love your vids!!! üòÉ

I like you and how you do your makeup, but everytime you say the foundation is dewy I really don't get it because all I see is oil. You always look super oily. That's different from a dewy glow when your whole face looks super shiny.
For a second I thought this was a parody. XD.
Damn, this is Fergie evolved. Such a chill and groovy tune.

DID ANYBODY ELSE NOTICE 2:12. And here i'll just add 6 petals...... there where only 5...
Sorry polymodal I like it when you're not talking is makes its faster sorry not to be mean or rude I'm really sorryüôÄ
‚úä‚ôêfuhk trump dont give a fuhk what anyone thinks fuhk trumpppp i been saying he a lil bitch ‚ôé‚úä dont care what yall think its all hypocritical vs. Politics vs. Historical am here trying to change into peace nd unity ,but donald the bitch is fuhking it all up i stand nd will stand with Em ‚úä
Em is a clown
Come on guys, let's just take a step back and talk this through...
Just because we support our President, doesn't mean that we ignore that he is a snake who may lead us to a nuclear holocaust.
So after all the years I've supported Eminem, it's like that just because I support Trump? üò≠
I Love McDonald‚Äôs
All these people are saying I lost respect for Eminem after this, he said clearly if you can't decide he'll do it for you so I don't think he cares...
EMINEM is smart.., but seriously you F boys got to get off his INSANE hypocrisy and nuts now
It's sad how he's desperate to be relevant again and he's cussing someone who's be cussed a billion times
Go vote and make a difference every body fighting makes America look so weak and we need to get together
Wait ...why is it so censored?
Everything eminem has said about politics in his music in the past now means nothing to me. All the weight they used to hold has gone with this video. He has picked a political just side to stay relevant.
funny how he is about to release new album in Nov and now is asskissing the establishment for exposure.. this is so fukin` pathetic....
Em is so  much better than any other new rapper that it's not even funny. Literally nobody wants to beef with him
566K Likes 65K Dislike\nThe comments sections has a disproportionate number of hate comments toward Eminem.  \nThe Trump Russian Troll Factories and the USA redneck keyboard warriors are hard at work again. \n Eminem is the best.
It's sad that someone with really great lyrics is such a moron.
the niggies are gona be all riled up over this lol. like they need another reason to violent savages.
Shit, I think I'm going to stand by myself. #lineinthesand
Throw that piece of shit against the wall til it sticks.
He ain‚Äôt gonna do shit. Eminem‚Äôs a bitch.
I yawned and almost fell asleep.. this can't be better than Black Thought from the Roots- Come on he even put his chain on.. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Tell him to take his slow walking ass back to Beverly Hills - ¬†It's all about WUTANG new album The Saga Continues- People Say -100
What's up w the background men
I'm still surprised Trump hasn't gone a whiney Twitter rant about Eminem yet. John Kelly must be doing double babysitter duty these last few days.
Stop deleting comments! Let people speak up for whatever they want
Yeah son. Represent. You tell it how it is.
Lol Cringe, what's this gonna do? Overthrow him? Think Again. As much as I dont like the guy, no matter what people say, its not going to change.
(Left): OMG this is amazing, we love Eminem even more now!! (Right): He's part of the anti-white establishment, a washed up rapper looking for attention. He went in on Trump so he's no longer a great rapper.
Ricegum is better than this üëåüòé
Where's the un censored one?
Isn't this guy in his mid 40's? He's a little old to be making little rhymes
Now all we have to do is wait for Trump to respond.
And don't tell us how to defend our families you and your bodyguards
our economy is up 5 trillion if y'all was leaders interested if following people blindly you might know this.
He didn't have to say anything about trump or athletes or anything about America and he'd still be relevant. It's eminem he'll always be relevant.
Eminem is the king that never dies
He's got a good way of putting things. Respect!!!!!!!!
Next Video : Trump's reaction to Eminem's Youtube Video.
Absolutely awesome!!! As a black man raised in the 80s, this white guy is the only white musician with born skills in rapping who hasn't talked evil shit about black people. Like Eddie Murphy said¬†some of if you can learn but most of it you have to be born with. Eminem was born with it and talking for blacks and against Trump has gotten to be real uncommon nowadays with the innate white supremicists coming out and showing their Satan worshipping true nature. Kudos Eminem!
Trump is such a moron
I am Em fan, but why it's so cringy?
Donald Trump Says He Would Vote for Eminem \nhttps://youtu.be/SuSkOQsv9fg
Goosebumps all over... Donald Trump might start something the whole world cannot stop. Support your conscience!
Wow look at Em's approval......trump only wishes for that  kind of real ...love.....and respect... Iam near 70 year old Grandma....Props to you Em.......Diamond and Silk  failed comic mimic of you sucked just like their clueless leader trump sucks.......
Yea yea this is champ E M I N E M üèÅüèÅüèÅüèÅüèÅüèÅüèÅ
People:‚ÄùRappers should not talk about politics. They should stick to making songs.‚Äù\nMe:‚ÄùHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA‚Äù
Em's good with beard..
Minority groups like Trump voters need to understand that Eminem speaks for America.
The day Trump supporters lost the only rapper they ever liked lol my respects em killed it
An old has been has an album out next month and attempts an absolutly shit publicity stunt to sell it. üòÉ Fail.
That's an aweful hot coffee pot, should i drop it on donald trump, problably not but thats all i got <-- whole freestyle summed up in the first line, eminem spitting fallacies and bullshit to encourage more sheep, 'omg eminem said this, my political view must change so i can be like the real slim shady' .. lmfao, buy into it libtards, buy into it. YOutube will make anything a trend so long as it agrees with their agenda. pathetic rap,  eminem hasnt been good for near 5 years.
This guy popularized freestyle? Jesus that was horrible and hardly freestyle. A freestyle requires flow. This was slam poetry at its core. slim sheckle, the guy who talks about raping his mom with a chainsaw claims to be a moral arbiter and cant even come up with a steady rap about something he claims to care about.
He sounds like hes battle rapping a ghostüòÇ but nobody is hyping his wack shit upüòÇ

This is all just a distraction to keep the world from knowing about all of the Hollywood pedophilic sex criminals getting exposed
Why did eminem have to get involved in this. I get he is one of the guys who is suppose to always give his opinion on important shit but eminem was my favorite rapper and he just talked shit about all my beliefs. For me that's enough to stop listening to him. Disappointed
I'M GETTING RID OFF ALL MY EMINEM CD'S , OH WAIT , I DON'T HAVE ANY , BWAHAHAHA : ) )

What is actually the song at the end this Epic Theme always gives me goosebumps
i like this movie.....
i love all episode of star wars <3
OMG IM SO HYPPED!! LIKE IF YOU ARE TO
I can‚Äôt wait for Christmas to come
whats so tempting in this that people go crazy for star wars ?
Oh no Ren will kill her mother üò£
not surprised. all women are evil and are drawn to the dark side.
Are we sure the Force isn't awakening in this one?
I need to see this
oh wow the trailer ends just like the ending of the force awakens \n\n\n\nCoincidence \n\n\n\n\nMaybe....
lol just look at all the nerds creaming themselves over this cinematic diarrhea.
*oh snap chain begins now...continue it in the comments* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Coming April 12th Oh, It's real.
Kylo Wren still punching things...Doesn't look like he'll get laid in this movie either.
RIP carry fishes may you be careing for fosh in heaven
Porg is the new Jar Jar.
Who else is really hyped for this movie?!!!
Hey anyone watching this for the 20th time I have a problem
Porgs are for comic relief while snoke is torturing rey
well that the movie watched then
Oh please, don't overdo the cute animals...
For the last question: Which is more likely: Rey turning bad or Kylo turning good? I actually think its a bit of both... I believe Kylo will wake up and realize the Sith masters have only ever used the Skywalkers as tools for their own ends, and he's no exception; while Rey will realize as Luke said Its time for the Jedi to end. that the force isn't actually meant to be split. It YEARNS to be in balance, not within the universe, but within the USER; a balance of good and evil, light and dark within the one who carries it, and she too will reject the Jedi. Not to become a Sith, but that both Kylo and Rey will transcend the ideologies of the past and become something more, something truly balanced, and something truly fearsome.
OK WHO IS THE SAME I HAD A CRUSH ON ANIKIN
The force is strong with this one
I approve looks good don‚Äôt like that little seal thing tho hope it isn‚Äôt just a merchandising thing or god forbid the new jar jar binks
This was everything i wanted it to be thank you whoever made this!
Just a shot in the dark here but I believe Kilo and Rey are gonna go not with the Jedi nor the Sith but an entirely different third route.
You will not know who I am.¬†\n\nNeedless to say, I am now somewhat hidden. I built my cabin, away from it all, in order to keep my family away from it all.\n\nGod bless y'all.
One of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot.
I think they are going to kill off Luke in this one, hence the title
Hmm, so is Rey gonna turn to the dark side temporarily like how Luke did in the EU? Also, I'm not a big fan of how Luke just sort of wimps out on everything.
Holy sh*t the film looks awsome but the trailer to
EVERYONE everyone, no, Rey is not joining the dark side! Why would star wars leave such a big spoiler in the trailer? It's probably just Rey pretending to do it so that she earns her trust and then after wards betrays Kylo.\n\n\n\nBut meh she might be i mean i dont know its up to you i guess i dont know the truth so meh i mean (get the point?)
I need the soundtrack
I promised myself that i wasn't going to watch this trailer...
So glad Carrie Fisher could be in this movie. ‚ù§Ô∏è
What anime is this?
What happened to being nice number 1 trending, now it‚Äôs number 2 when it has more views
some things of star wars is cool and all but its not THAT great
Trailer is a bit heavy handed, hopefully the film won't beat you over the head quite so much with the dichotomies, which are a fine idea in and of itself.
fan theory: rey is yoda's daughter.
I really happy about this movie I can't wait
Why can't they have Luke just be a powerful Jedi and let him save the day in this movie. That's what I wanted. Looks like he's going to be a weakling and barely be in it.
drama in space lol so boring
Snoke is not Mace Windu.\nAnakin cut Windu's rhight hand.\nSnoke has his own right hand.
At least it's not George.
The whole world stops when Star Wars drops a teaser\nI really really hope you have a happy easter\n\nGet the reference? No?
The director said he wasn't going to let Carrie Fischer's character go like that. They are not going to kill Leia, idk how they'll do it but they will somehow make her live in the franchise forever.
Yoda: Luke, when I am gone, the last of the Jedi you will be...\n\n30yrs later, it still stands.
I WANT ONE OF THEM NEW X WINGS.,,, LOL. XXXXXXXXXX
Can I get 100 likes for nothing?
I kinda cringed when her lightsaber was going to the beat... Anybody else?
Could someone please explain the entire star wars storyline? I have no clue as to what's happening and this looks pretty good. Thanks lol
Can't wait for this to hit the...torrent sites. Free movies ftw!
Omg I have been waiting so long I might cry like if you have tooüòçüò≠üòç
AAHHH *jumps up and down* \nSorry\nI can‚Äôt waitttt...!
Shyeah, I ain't standing up in the next ten minutes.
Luke Skywalker is the bad guy in this movie. look at the past movie poster, the bad guys over shadows the characters.
Like this if Snoke is just Gollum from Lord of the Rings raised from the dead!
I don't get it.
Idk if its just because of Carrie Fisher's passing but seeing Leia staring off like that is heartbreaking.
I have a good feeling that Rey turns bad and Kylo Ren turns good. Rewatch the end!
So now Chewbacca has a guinea pig gremlin fish thing for a companion.
I live the US so hopefully there's not a¬†shooting at my theater.

Han Solo dies lol
bad trailer
This is going to be epic. Visually stunning scenes, musically magnificent, brilliantly written,  and breakout acting by Driver....CANT WAIT!!!
Rey is lame. Ive only seems such raw power once cheesy dialogue. We'll see if they can develop her character more this episode, her last appearance was dwarfed among real stars, and lackluster overall to be the supposed new lead. Kylo is attracting the new spotlight.
Wow the new Star Trek is looking nice. Can‚Äôt wait to see if Wonder Woman goes with Neo from Star Trek Or Gandalf . Also the fight with creed and Ironman looked dope.
This trailer is amazing!!!!
Liam Neeson makes his return...ha!..it's to bad he thinks the film's rubbish.they need his seriousness

But I genuinely believe that I'm an artist you'll actually be glad that you heard. If ONE PERSON gives this a thumbs up, you'll be an important part of helping a persons dreams come true. I promise my music is good and you won't be disappointed. I just need a chance and 3 minutes of your time to check out my music on my channel.
I really really like him
You can tell Emma wanted to laugh
no wonder only fox would give seth a job
the Alex Jones effect\nfirst they laugh\nlater they cry
Sallie Hofmeister , good luck explaining all of this for your client, Harvey Weinstein. Or have you bolted, too, in the footsteps of Lisa Bloom and Lanny Davis, who finally found someone so vile, so rotten, so psychopathic, that NO amount of money could entice them to go down with their client's ship? See what happens sometimes when self-respecting journalists go into the PR business?
Harvey Weinstein is just the tip of the iceberg.......the elite in this country know the clock is ticking......the party's over, you sick twisted lunatics.
Guys how do I promote my channel?
Did seth know all along?! I can't believe it! He was hiding it as well! Arrest this man!
It goes much deeper than women that these people are abusing....children are victims too i hope it all gets exposed and hollywood gets shut down the entire industry is disgusting! Stop spending your money and time watching and idolizing these swine!
These disgusting freaks don't care about women being raped, it's funny to them as long as they're making millions.
He also predicted Bruce Jenner would become kaitlyn
Fuck he wasn't even joking. Dead face after that delivery
The way Emma reacts makes me think she went through it too.
Any real journalist would have dug deeper into this. But nope. We all just chuckled along pretending we're part of the it crowd like good smiling sheep
Seth: Oh you're laughing at what? It's true, you know.
He did good, but this shows how the people we're watching now being all shocked, disgusted and surprised are all a bunch of hypocrites. They knew all along.
Unbelievable. I spent a month in L.A. once. Trusting my intuition, I likened it to a concentrated cesspool of American dysfunction, and never returned. Going to see a show in Hollywood in a couple of days. Then hang out in L.A. (maybe Venice Beach) for a day or two. Then, I'm certain I'll leave thinking the same thing. 100% certain.
So a creator of family guy is predicting the future not tge simpsons ü§î
And this is Hollywood, the land of the whores and rapists, that lecturing people from the higher moral ground, telling them how to think, how to act, how to vote...
Wait I don‚Äôt understand this?? Can someone explain this to me?
Hollywood is a sick place. Where morals and dignity are garbage values to these celebs in exchange for money and fame.
So I can still see how this can be seen as a joke if one doesn't know what he did
Lol his face looks like I‚Äôm not joking this is some real ish
I saw this clip when it was first a thing and I was so confused
Please read this comment! The state of California has essentially legalized INTENTIONALLY infecting others with HIV via SB 239. I have created a White House Petition to call on congress to publically address SB 239 and call for its repeal! I have created a video on my channel that clearly addresses this issue and there is a link to the petition in the description. I have FaceBook group called Repeal Sb-239. If anyone could talk about SB-239 and address this issue and call for people to sign the petition it would be astounding! I am paying to promote a vid on my channel that talks about this because it sets a dangerous precedence! Please help! I need 100,000 signatures within 30 days. We could do something good!
why is this on trending though
When this news broke out last week, Seth was probably watching TV like 'I hope someone picked up that phone because I FUCKING CALLED IT!
What about all the pedophilia in Hollywood? Prime example being Walt Disney.......a sadomasochistic pedophile with the perfect cover..... Hollywood is founded on the sickest behavior imaginable, soon it will all come to light folks......just wait
Hey everyone!! Could you do me a huge favor and check out my recent dance video to Future - I'm so Groovy?? You're input would be greatly appreciated!! :)
Apparently a friend of his had to fend off Weinstein
Notice how Hillary Clinton will keep talking about how appalled she is about the revelations on Harvey Weinstein. In fact, she just looked the other way. Because Weinstein was a huge financial rainmaker for her campaigns and had a great influence on the journalists / media as a power and access broker. What a great feminist.
I'm looking forward to seeing a future Family Guy with some actress in a metal bikini chained to Jewbba the Hutt (Weinstein)
i hate all of you faggot Hollywood peophiles
Yet they call us conspiracy theorists.
He should be treated as a hero.  Compare to Seth, those men who made voices after the story broke  are cowards.
They take you and rape you, look at you in disgusting ways ohhhhhh you should of.....never trusted hollywood
Seth is like I'm not fucking joking guys.
i don't get it
Jeez this Weinstein Guy looks like a freaking sack of Potatoes with hair glued to it . Disgusting human being ...I believe we haven't even scratched the surface . What's happening in Hollywood is shame it's self .
WOW THIS VIDEO IS SENSORED, HERE IS THE EXPLICIT https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nQE1h62Kjrg
This is the one time he wasn't joking, but people thought it was a joke anyway
They'll bring back Harvey Weinstein,by 2018 just watch like they did,with brian williams
Great idea)))) Wonderful video))) Thank you for visiting us
Get a New Samsung S7!\nhttps://goo.gl/hs69xf
McFarlane is a beast.
Harvey's been a bad Mason, so he's being punished.
So...everyone knew, the whole time, and no one did anything
For some reason this foo seth knows shit we don‚Äôt.. Been multiple times he has called out shit
It is so common, they have had a name for it for at least 60 years, it's called the Casting Couch.
Every actor and actress knew in Hollywood. Now their just in their Pontius Pilate shit.. washing their fucking hands when shit got real.
We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
The Elites knew. They all knew. Your getting big üí∞ you look the other way. It's gross. Thats showbiz.
I'd open my legs any day to Harvey, back in 89 I spread them wide open to his 8 inches and had 40 kids by him, allegedly
If only people really knew! üòï
Hollywood is like a family. Everyone knows all the bad things about each other and it stay in the family.
So glad Hollywood was able to laugh about this...instead of...you know...doing something about it...but yes, haha, very funny...
Seth is the man!
seth is a legend.
Not to many people laughing.cowards.
Scroll and find a snake in your bed\nSubscribe- millionaire \nLike- you get ice cream
he knew about Bruce Jenner and Harvey weinstein. could seth mcfarlane be clairvoyant?
the depressing part is that it took this long for something to be done about it.
Hollywood is run by pedophiles
From the nervous, uncomfortable laughter, you can tell everybody in the room knew. Presumably including Meryl Streep, who at another award show came out and called Harvey Weinstein God. And who now pretends to be morally outraged and plays herself as an innocent dupe who was tricked by this man's pure evil into having no idea about any of this, who would never have supported him had she known. Despite knowing him personally for years. Despite cheering for Roman Polanski and lamenting his being jailed in Switzerland. Of course, we all know that is a lie. Everyone in Hollywood knew. They just didn't care. Never trust anyone in Hollywood when they try to morally grandstand. Especially on an issue like this.
Seth Mcfarlane is like the Superman of Comedians (the look the voice, etc.). This dude is great and would love to see him do more comedy. he is REALLY REALLY good. And the most edgy in my opinion.
Dave Chappelle was right about Martin Lawrence and Hollywood!
But didn't have the guts to call the police.
They all knew

Sad rich powerful men can't be men anymore......... 2017 year of the pussy.......  Donal Trump please  keep us men in power....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sorry are you triggered???
Not saying what weistein did was right, but we all kinda know that Hollywood doesn't lack actresses and weistein did not rape these people. The actresses weren't forced to have sex with him, it was a trade, though an unspoken, undesirable and despicable one, still a trade nonetheless. I mean, these actresses never had to have sex with weistein if they don't want him to help them get the job. \nIn the entertainment industry it has been quite normal for these types of trade to take place (Actresses actively seeking to sleep with directors and producers of gone with the wind back then for the lead role) and I gotta be honest, at least every actress who claimed to have had sex with weistein did get the job, as well as fame and money in the end, which implies he is actually a pretty fair person, there are producers who sleeps with actresses and still doesn't do what he or she promises. \nIt really just feel like accusing someone to be a sex offender after agreeing to have sex with said person for personal gains. Pretty gross. These actresses shouldn't be standing on the moral highs ground and pretend to be the victim.
wait can someone fill me in on whats going on? why is this 2013 clip making its way back to 2017? who did what and what did who?
Omg that mother fucking trump was right about the grab em by the pussy if ur rich and famous
Doesnt that make the women Whores? They agreed to sleep with him for high paying roles? They could have said no.
This is one of the few vids were James doesn‚Äôt surpass the artist vocally!
James is doing this because he is a good singer üëå
I love how almost all the songs they sang are throwbacks
Oh Miley, my Miley! Ur the best and cutest ever!
Disappointed they didn‚Äôt sing Best of Both Worlds
wow that vocals!!! She's fun though!
I love how she harmonised the old songs and didn't sing the same as the recording!!
Wonderful plastic teeth. And uuuuuugly tattooooos. Which random number generator did she use to find the most unfitting spots for those ugly tattooos? Is that a new market? An app to assure you find the most stupid spot that makes you feel so special cuz noone else is stupid enough to have a tattoo at this unappropriate spot??? BOOOOO¬≥
Carpool Karaoke With Kendrick Lamar , i would love to see that
personal thought I feel like Miley just crushed this, like usually James has his spotlight moment but today Miley was just completely wow. amazing
her voice gives me life üòç
The climb will forever be my favourite miley Cyrus song ‚ù§Ô∏èüèî
Looks like he's making up for all the hits he missed out singing with her
They have to do another one when she did the bone dance
Too bad she's flopping now lol
I love her so much
Where are the Dead Petz songs? :(
So happy she seems like she's in a better place now.\n\nOn a side note though, 2013/2014 Miley was soo fun.
Why are the same two cars behind them the entire video?
I love her top.
Miley CAN SING FOR REAL gosh she's so good
can i ask wtf is a carpool lane??
first carpool karaoke that I actually know all the songs to :,)
Not even one Hannah Montana song.....üòûüíî
Does anyone else notice how Miley keep looking at the center of the dashboard while singing? What the heck is she looking at??
Must be awkward singing 'we can't stop' while they're already stuck and stopped by the traffic üòÇüòÇ
LmaooooüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ \nMiley - it could of been more fun if we hot boxed this thing I lost itüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Her voice is deepüòêüòêüòê
She looks so classy, I am legit so proud of her, and her voice is out of this world, mash'Allah!
She is the most beautiful creature. UGH
harry styles and miley should do a collab... pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Like her life choices or not, but this girl has an incredible voice!!
i‚Äôm so happy
It's like my favorite carpool karaoke as the one with Harry Styles!! Thank you James!!! You'e the best!!
Her new album is boring as fuck.
I was about to cry when they sing the Climb ‚ù§Ô∏è i live Miley so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
miley and adele kinda sound similar, maybe its just how powerful their voices are
when is there going to be one with shawn mendes, come on :D
Whether you like her or not, (i'm not really a fan) she's an amazing vocal talent!
James voice is higher than miley's in every song
i‚Äôve never seen james mess up so muchüòÇüòÇ
They went so hard lol. No really that was some powerful singing between the both of them.
Malibu is such a beautiful song and hearing Miley sing it was amazazinggg
Am I the only one that completely lost it when James used her tongue for his stamps??????
what is that song called at the beginning
Wow! She looks great! Please stay like that!
So happy for Miley! Love seeing her happy and content with where she is in her life!
PINK GONNA HAVE TO DO IT!!
Miley, you can smoke with me anytime you want.
Miley üòçüòçüòçyes finally when waiting for this
Why are the majority of these comments talking about how good she can sing? Like are you guys kidding me? Have y'all been sleep or something?
So happy Miley made a comeback and is embracing rather than hiding her past actions and how she's changed
her voice is incredible
She looks so much like Hannah Montana lol
She has a voice of an angle
She's so fit
OMG the best karaoke I love you Miley Cyrus.üòçüòç‚ù§‚ù§üòòüòò

girl got a set of pipes on her.. respect!
I was waiting for Party in the USA and Malibu üíõ‚ù§Ô∏è
She was 100% on something during this üòÇ her eyes are so red
Wait, when did they start using actual Karaoke tracks? I know it's going to be a long time ago and I'm going to feel silly when someone tells me ...

Idk what I watched but PLEASE MAKE MORE üò´üôèüôèüíì
So you tried to clean Canada, one of the cleanest countries in the world already, then you went to Africa and didn't try to clean it?
I need someone to edit this video with SOPE. lol
How do I wash Soap?
Is there a pdf link where I can download these tips?
You are doing yourself an injustice not watching this high.
Oh, I get it.
Anyone else see the fidget spinner in 0:36?
No soaps were hurt in the making of this video.
WAS THAT A FIDGET SPINNER IN THE AFRICAN JUNGLE?
I know im not the only one that came here to see soap tits
Soup...Let's make a religion out of this!
Nope it‚Äôs already clean - hahaha that got me üòÇüòÇ
*o h  n o  i t ' s  a  n a t u r a l  d i s a s t e r*
Idk what the fuck this is but I need more
You could make a religion out of this
What Did The Librarian Tell The Students\n\n\n\n*Read More*

Ughh.. I need to stop mixing weed with youtube binges,  it's giving me a headache. .

Coulda sworn I was watching a Dove ad
i tried eating soap \nit didn't go well.....
Thank you soo fucking much for uploading this on my birthday :P
You're like Jordan Underneath but less creepy
Good job Wilburt u managed to become popular! I love u
We should make a religion out of this.
wtf is this and i love it
But how would you protect yourself from soap?
*the first time at Lush*
I'm washing my hands....with S O A P
Don't drop it.
Pro tip, don't drop it
I love you bill
suddenly, the word soap has lost its meaning
I like it. I don't know what I watched, but I like it and know that I want more of it.
No soaps were harmed in the making of this video
I'm allergic to soap.
You could make a religion out of that
is this a drugs
Umm.. what did I just watch üòÇ
Hey ,You could make a religion outta this
Don't drop the soap
This channel is weird. I love it. And I like soap.
The world is not ready for this knowledge.
So like... ALL the drugs?
Did you wash your hands before and after making this video?
I love this so much
Hi I'm üéµstill a peace of garbageüéµ.
What the hell kind of name is Soap?
My head hurts but luckily bill wurtz always clears it up
People in Canada don't use soap.
i was high when i watched this
Is this what it's like to be on drugs?
I feel cleaner after watching this
As always, what did I just watch?
I'll have what he's having
It was a bad idea to try bath salts and then watch this...
wash Canada!\nnope it‚Äôs already clean.
This is literally how my brain thinks about random stuff everyday.
This is what I needed
Bill I'm concerned
LETS GO TO AFRICA AND FIND LOVE IN A JUNGLE
Would the soap be dirty if someone with dirty hands made the soap? So then do all soap workers have to wash their hands with their own soap so that they don't get the other soap dirty? So then who makes _their_ soap?
imagine watching this while high
We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
This video is inappropriate can i have a clean version \n\n\n\n\n\nGet it ( ¬∞ Õú ñ ¬∞)
I wonder if anyone understands a single thing in this video. Or the more likely, it's just a bunch of kids jumping on the bandwagon like sheep thinking it's cool because everyone else does. Another portion would just be a bunch of stoners flipping out at all the psychedelic colours and sounds. And finally a huge portion of pretweens thinking every word is hilarious and compelled to repeat it in the comment section.\n'Don't drop the soap! TEEHEE I made a funny! Everyone like my comment!'\n\nThis all just reminds me of the Rick & Morty Fandom Apocalypse. A bunch of morons taking the jokes too far and f***ing it for everybody.\n'Wubba Lubba dub dubb! Amirite you muthafarkin Pickle Rick sh!theads?! Where's mah schezwan sauce b!tches!'\n\nYeah... \nI'm sure none of you idiots have a clue what's going on. Just repeat another funny quote...good job.
Im shedding a tear, this video was so, powerfull
Why do i feel like all the videos have a meaning that no one has goten becuse the peron that makes theses are on a higher degree of life then we can understand.

Dislike cause this shit seems routine but I love you daisy.

She's so cute!
How is she doing that with her mouth?

Retarded.  Why don't you interview a soldier or a frefighter.  Daisy Ridley.  BFD.
She's a dora bol, that's hindi for cutie.
That's like walking into a dream of mine
This is kind of a creepy video because it has the feel of a completely different KIND of video, if you know what I mean. Strange.
Favorite colour Grey. GREY JEDI CONFIRMED! (Before you Larry literals try to tell me it's not the case, it's a joke.)
She fucks with toni braxton, mulan, and eminem? She also bites her fucking nails and likes sushi.  She needs to be my bestfriend
Why the fuck is this filmed like a casting couch video.

NO !!! i was listening to Lose yourself right before i clicked on this video ... no shit !!!!! i was summing the lyrics while watching this video ... and then she started singing it :O
2:33 who else expected her to say her favorite flower was a daisy?
Am I that only one that thinks that that random friend on the phone was Karen Gillan.
I'd slide down a dry water slide covered in broken glass, rusty nails, cat shit, and Lysol on my belly into a pit of dingos just to lick her *tit* dude
Was that random friend Karen Gillian? 5:01
i love her teeth
Am I the only one who thinks she looks dead up like Kiera Knightly in this video?
can you imagine a 73 questions with eminem?
We don't deserve her. We are not worthy.
My boobs are bigger than her's . And im a man.
I LOVE HER SO MUCH!!!
You Really Cant Hear Most Of her Accent I n the Movie. Cant wait For The Second One XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Omg I thought you were wearing makeup until you started applying your makeup. Your skin is perfection!!!
You mean... you weren‚Äôt wearing makeup at the start of the video????? Wow goalsssss
Your hair looks so luscious!!!!
So helpful!!!! Thank you xx
it's always refreshing to see youtubers being honest about the products they may or may not like :)
This was a great review üëè
I can't wear sunscreen directly on my skin. So I have to layer it on top of my moisturizer.
Thank you for this!! Super helpful. Feel like I can justify a couple new purchases now :)
Love the milky jelly cleanser. ¬†The wowder made me break out. ¬†I kept trying it because I really like the finish. ¬†I have oily skin, acne prone skin and I just couldn't make it work. ¬†The cloud paints were great, but after an hour they would disappear off my face. ¬†I really wish they had more staying power. ¬†Probably better for drier skin.
The Glossier Cloud Paints are my fave! I add a small dab of Puff to Dusk and it creates the most natural rosy nude. I find Dusk on its own to be too brown, and Puff to be too bright pink but together - perfection :)
I had a bit of a glossier shopping spree the Monday when uk shipping became available, after watching this I'm really happy about my choices and am looking forward to receiving them. I got the haloscope in quartz, the balm dotcom trio (rose, birthday and cherry) and the phase 2 set (light, brown and zip). Zip looks like it could be the exact wore look red I've been trying to find for months, I can't wait to try it all!!
Thank you for reviewing the body products as I was mulling those over. I will now give them a pass as I too have sensitive skin and can't tolerate overly fragranced products. Also, anyone with sensitive skin or Rosacea prone skin should always avoid chemical sunscreens and opt for the physical sunscreens.
Please make a skin care video with your favs, your face skin is awesome!
I can't get enough of the coconut balm dot com and Milky Jelly Cleanser!
Thanks Anna. Super helpful, well presented review. I was trying to resist buying anything and then, bang!, you hit us with the 10% off code. I've just bought half of the Glossier website and couldn't be happier! Hoping Cake Generation G will make me look as fly as you and Allana :]
you always come up with the most helpful and well thought out videos! btw you're skin looks absolutely incredible! when you started putting make up on I got so confused hahah xx
I made my first Glossier order a few weeks ago and ordered one of almost everything! The only thing I do not care for is the skin tint. It makes me look like an oil slick about 2 hours in. Loved this review and you are the reason I made the order in the first place!
Oh man - Wish I'd watched this before I ordered some products! I need some Generation G!!
Love the thorough review! I'm also waiting for Glossier to release a bronzer :).
As a Combo skin, sensitive, dehydrated and acne prone skinned girl - the original priming moisturizer is holy grail for me. Changed my skin for the better.
LOL definitely pale! - Right there with you! Thanks for the reviews, I placed my order the other day and can't wait to get it!
Thanks Anna! Really great informative video, my Glossier shopping list just got longer! Also noticed you are number 8 on Trending!!
You have such amazing brows, do you do anything to tame them, grow them, keep them healthy? Gorg! Xxx
You‚Äôre not the first one who itches after the shower gel. I‚Äôm missing out on these!
I like that you kept it realistic! Xx
Just back from New York (still strugling with my jetlag), but I think it's a hype. Only bought the cleansing gel (is ok) and the brow gel. Otherwise, nothing special. It's all about the woman who really doesn't need make up.....(according to the Hirons lady),....so why use it than? Marketing: genius, quality wise: nothing special. So thanks, but no.thanks! üòÇüòé And for the stickers...sorry, I'm n√≥t a teenager that loves little kitty!
I've been looking forward to this video so much. However my first thought at the start was your hair looks great.
*the mole on your cheek looks like it has its own gravity and is pulling the side of your lips towards it*\n\n\n\n*jk :D, love ya!*
It took me like 10 minutes, till you applied the perfecting tint, to realize you had no makeup on... looking gorgeous Anna xxx
Anna, I honestly n e v e r leave comments on YouTube ‚Äì but I love you and your channel and I just couldn't hear you complain about the price/size of Glossier Super Bounce one more time without letting you in on the amazing lil' secret that THE ORDINARY DO AN EVEN BETTER 'DUPE' FOR A *FIVER*! It's their 'Hylauronic 2% + B5' and (get this) ‚Äì it's 30ml!!\n\nGet it here. Thank me later. Seriously. http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-hyaluronic-acid-2pct-b5-30ml. xx\n¬†\n(p.s. ASOS, Feelunique, Cult Beauty and a couple of others stock it too ‚Äì it's just out of stock at the mo).
Send a dollar please paypal.me/boubkr
The cloud paints literaly disappear on oily skin
Glossier needs to ship to Australia, stat!
HOLA mu√±ecas a que hora salen por el pan bizcochitos
Thanks for the comprehensive review Anna!
you should always wear this tint ! it's so nice on your skin
Just waiting for my first order, looking forward to trying them. PS, I just listened to a podcast where Emily Weiss mentioned she uses her milky jelly cleanser on her err intimate area, you‚Äôre welcome lol xx
All the makeup YouTubers paying to get on trending hahah
out of everything you showed in your video today ima buy the bobbi brown  brush...and the cleanser
Ah I'm about to place an order but I can't select shipping in the uk anymore. I almost placed one yesterday and it was fine then üò≠
Amazing run through! Thx Anna! Feel super informed and ready to hit up the site x
Yes!!! I have been waiting for this aha xxxx
Hi Anna, you mentioned having psoriasis a couple times before and I wonder if you could you do a psoriasis video? Not very glamorous I know haha - mine pretty much disappears in the Spring and reappears in Autumn so I would love to know your tips before it comes back. Thank you!!
Getting my order tomorrow can't wait üòÄ
Dying to know how the new perfume smells!?
I love crush!!! It looks great on my skin tone!!! I think it‚Äôs a very universal shade!!!
I disagree with the skin tint! I have OILY skin and that product is a holy grail. Matifying products always break down weirdly on oily skin. I just embrace my shine and that product doesn't break me out at all
Loved this.  Almost placed an order but glad I waited.  Based on your information about using the products for awhile, I have changed my mind about some items.  This video has helped me out a lot!  Thanks for the very helpful info, Anna!!
Thank you so much for this Anna.  I am about to do my first order and this is so helpful. X
Its been a month and i was skeptical to order but now I'm going to buy. Its a big order but im very curious to not look so beat. Im a little over that look. And this company celebrates natural beauty. I do have acne scaring not so severe but as my skin heals i feel its best to embrace my flaws as they recover. Long story short im buying.
Such an insightful video, can't wait to order! xxx
Obvs I placed an order on Monday (hurry up and arrive please!) but now watching this makes me want to go for order number two!
Can't wait for my order, watching you and Lily rave about this has made me so excited for UK shipping. Not sure my credit card will thank me though! Thanks for such a great review!!
Hiya, I sent you an email about helping me with my a level EPQ, would really appreciate if you reply as soon as possible xx
my first order is on the way over from the US right now. yay to shipito. I'm kind of excited - I hope I picked the right shades. I was like you know what you look like a mozzarella just get the lightest one of everything üòÇ
Very helpful! I'm hinting to family in the UK to send some to me in SA. Totally unrelated but... what do you use on your hair? It's always so lovely and shiny and sleek.
Thanks Anna this was very helpful - I have ordered the milky cleanser and concealer, hooray!
I love Generation G! They give a tinted look but feel nicer than a lip tint. I also really love the Milky Jelly Cleanser, Haloscope (Quartz) and Cloud Paints (Puff and Dusk for day, Haze for night. I'm also really enjoying Wowder (I look moisturized but it tamps down the Glossier look of looking like I can fry an egg on my face haha). The rest I'm kind of meh with. Stretch Concealer was a fail because I feel like it didn't actually conceal anything and Priming Moisturizer Rich WAS THE THE WORST because the lavender oil broke me out. I was so disappointed when I saw the lavender oil in the ingredients list but I bought it anyway because I love the brand. Anyway it was good to my skin for about two weeks and I actually thought the lavender oil would be ok...and then it murdered my skin. SMH.
Thanks so much for this! As someone with oily acne prone skin most of the skincare is a miss for me and makes me break out terribly (ugh superbounce was awful for me) so I appreciate the disclaimer in the beginning. I would stay away from all the skin products if you have acne prone skin even the concealer and highlighter which has coconut and castor oil. Don't get sucked in!
Just about the order my basket then this popped in to my subscription box !!  Perfect timing thanks Anna !!

I'm loving the look of your hair on this video Anna! You look so pretty :)
Love you and your videos! For redness you should try dr. Jart‚Äôs cicarepair tiger grass in the pot! Its so good and has spf in it too üëçüèº really think you‚Äôll like it ü§ó
What a lovely review! I just ordered th Boy Brow in Clear and the Stretch Concealer in Light!! Can't wait to try them!
I really want to try the concealer but I'm not sure it'll cover my mum eye bags!! Xx
I haven't tried these products yet, but I've watched about a dozen videos reviewing them. They seem like they are targeted for women with really good skin, who don't want to wear much make up but just want a little boost. To be honest,my impression is that they are a lot of hype and not a lot of benefit for the money
Thanks for this! Anna, do you find the Moonstone Haloscope glittery or still glossy and sheeny like the others? I have milk pale skin so think that's the one for me, but I've read that it's chunkier than the other two...but I trust your judgment most on it!
anna! i'm a religious viewer/reader but i never comment - i just wanted to say thanks for being dedicated and awesome. I wanted to suggest/ask you to compare the glossier super pure to the ordinary niacinamide serum and super bounce to the ordinary hyaluronic acid. Also, have you ever tried topaz as an eyeshadow situation?? i love quartz but i'm considering topaz for that purpose
Totally couldn't tell you had no makeup on at the start of the video! Your skin is amazing, I hope that's down to the glossier as I just placed a big order üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
Great review! Wish Glossier would ship to Australia...
I still think that about serum you should try The Ordinary. They are much better prices and really good! Did you try them Anna?
Great video Anna very informative and has saved me spending a lot of money when I don‚Äôt need to...thank you
Im obssesed with the generation g lipstick in crush, I use it everyday!!
I really like the skin tint, and I have oily skin. I do use a powder on top. I'm pretty lucky, so my skin is clear and I don't have much discoloration. If you need serious color correction, this may not be so useful. It's a very nice texture as well.
Love that you‚Äôre a total fan girl of Glossier but you still gave a very balanced review. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre one of my favesüíï
Anna, thanks for a really thorough review! One thing I really love about Glossier that I feel doesn't get touched on quite enough, is their line is 100% cruelty free and they don't do any animal testing. Just thought I'd share! Thanks again!
Hi! I just wanted to let you all know that you can get 20% off and free shipping of your first Glossier purchase by shopping via a rep link. I have mine linked in my blog posts about Glossier (on ninamidlik(dot)com) or if you go to glossier(dot)com/reps/Nina - I'm just sharing so you all can get the discount. And once you place an order they'll give you a link to share and you can get credits to your account! (Disclaimer: reps get a small amount of commission on sales (not the in store credit) Just so you all know!)
Loved your review and the makeup look, looks amazing on you!
Such an amazingly helpful (& honest as ever) video! Thank you x
You should try the cloud paint as eyeshadow. Dusk makes a great blown-out soft eye shade. I use it on my eyes and cheeks all the time. Makes an easy tonal look.
love your vidsss!!! a huge fan of yours from indonesia <3
I have the Generation G in the color Jam, and I find that it looks absolutely amazing on my lips, but also lightly patted into my cheeks! For any Generation G owners who have yet to try Cloud Paint (be it budget, etc...) definitely give it a go first with some Gen G on the cheeks! That being said, I am really excited to get my first Cloud Paint (Puff), and I am trying Generation G in Crush as well! Just can't get enough..!
Incredibly helpful. I think you‚Äôve just saved me $100. It‚Äôs overwhelming trying to figure out what is good, and what‚Äôs terrible. Thank you for saving your audience a lot of money.
I made an order on Monday (trying for the first time), for the boy brow and concealer, so impressed! This combined with your video has caused me to make another purchase !! I also got the perfume sample and oh my gosh I need this fragrance!!!
I am absolutely in love with your videos!! And this on is definitely one of my favs! üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº
Is it not available in any shops? Just online?
When she said lol instead of laughing hahahha
Just wanted to say: I love the crease under your eyes. It gives you such a youthful look! This feature is actually celebrated in South Korea, and they sell products to accentuate it! And of course, being South Korea, they have plastic surgeries to create/enhance it. https://www.kpopsurgery.com/what-is-aegyo-sal/
Your videos are soo good looking :)
Thank you for the honest and comprehensive review! Have you tried mixing the drippy serums with a moisturiser to help apply it?
This was  beyond helpful, Anna. Thank you so much! üíï
You're making me regret being so restrained on Monday, I feel my spending ban being broken again for the second time in the space of 2 days üòÇ
Thanks Anna, super helpful. I placed my first order on Monday. I just ordered the stretch concealer and lip tint to start with.
giiiirl, please do a body care video! I have terribly dry skin and love any recs to make my life better <3
Need to try Boy Brow!! Loved this video! Xoxo, Caylie
Not sure that I agree with the shade range being broad if there are only 5 shades ??? is it 5 shades of Caucasian ?  that aside I wish they'd ship to Aus already
I‚Äôm not sure this brand is really worth the hype. I have made an order but am not expecting that much really. The choice of products is really limited too. Let‚Äôs see how it goes but to be fair  I‚Äôm more excited about beauty pie
Has anybody tried the Wowder and the Charlotte Tilbury airbrush powder? If so which one would you recommend out of the two?
I wish you would have sprayed the eau de parfum and told us how it smelled. Thanks for such a great start to my work day!
Loved this video! I‚Äôve been so excited to see your overall Glossier thoughts. Question-  why is *no one* talking about Generation G in Leo?? It‚Äôs my favorite shade out of all of them and literally NONE of the beauty bloggers I follow have even mentioned it. Have you tried it?

You know the respect is real when Trevor calls the lady who cooks him home food as CHEF Chen! üëå
Absolutely love your videos and how happy you look when you're eating! However, Ê≥°Ëèú is pickled vegetables not pickled radishes in translation since most Ê≥°Ëèú is not made from radish. It mainly comes from mustard plants, cabbage, or napa.
I wish i would have been with u for having that extremely spicy foodüòçüòçüòç
I love the outdoors eating. Must be nice not having motors and cars wondering around near you while eating (unlike in the city) üòÅ
Loved the tea horse journey.  The chilli rating is a great addition. Keep it up. 5 stars.
Should bring strictly dumpling there since he loves spicy food
it's 9:20 am in the morning and im hungry becuase of Trevor!
Hi, Trevor. I really like your videos. My wife and I used to watch your video at bed time and we had to get up and eat something! I actually live in Vancouver and eat in Crystal Mall at metrotown a lot. There is a Ëä±Ê∫™ÁâõËÇâÁ≤â which is really nice. If you want to explore more of the delicious food, I suggest you go to Ë¥µÂ∑û„ÄÇThere is a lot of delicious food! Again, thanks for your videos! Great job!
They are all so genuinely nice.
How do this guy finish it all
Don't know what type of MSG that Chinese uses but I respect that you don't edit the moment when they add and you ask what it was ( ¬¥‚àÄÔΩÄ) Really enjoy watching your show!!
@8:13, The street food lady cook is too modest; no way an amateur cooking at home can reproduce her street food  cooking recipe.
Trevor, you're getting fat bro. Still love your vids doe üëå.
I just watched a video about gutter oil in China and then this one appears. Way to go, YouTube.
As you were in Zigong, you should have visited the panda zoo
Hi Trevor congrats for 1 million subs..and u r videos are awesome...I like very much  u r videos and ratings....
As a Zigong native, glad you could show its food to the rest of the world!
You know what trevor, i saw your notification,i opened it, and i click the thumbs up even i havent see your video. . Simply enough, because your video never stop to satisfying me

Absolutley loved the video ,yum ,looking forward for more videos :)
Woah it went from day to night!! Did you finish it?! I can‚Äôt even handle that much spice!!
the audio is a bit low. why is that?
try the new mcdonalds crispy chicken tenders they are next level
There's spicy but taste good , then there's extreme spicy that over power the flavor of the food and all you can taste is the burn n pain , I'm talking about using stuffs like the Carolina reaper, the scorpion blend, and ghost pepper..

That sound as the hazelnut praline was being poured...I thought a random window of mine was making that noise.\nAlso, Mike finishing off his nut sprinkling somehow reminds me of how James added his finishing touches right as time runs out XD\n\nSuggestion for you lads to have a throwback week! so remake a recipe you've made eons ago without looking back at that recipe and video, just to see if anything's changed in your procedures over the years :>
Any suggestions if you can't have eggs or dairy? üò•üò•üò• I've the worst allergies :(

I‚Äôm Jeremy‚Äôs girlfriend literally
I'm sorry but you know Mary Berry would say that the roll is not tight enough!!
Huh that's how I roll my joints ü§î
Mike, you can totally be Jeremy‚Äôs girlfriend if you want to. You can be anything you want if you believe hard enough.
Keep up the dairy free desserts/ food! üëå
What? didn't understand girlfriend explanation >.<
I love the intro it's so funny
Is it possible to substitute hazelnut with macadamia?
REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!! Jesus died for you knowing that you may never love him back. He shed his blood and sacrificied his life so we can be in heaven with him and the Lord! Turn away from your wicked ways and accept Jesus Christ as your SAVIOR!!! HE IS COMING AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND OR GO TO HELL. WOE ONTO YOU!!
Please temper your hazelnut coffee mixture or you will scramble the yolk
What if you can't find hazelnut milk? Will other nut mills work??
u're knocking off my nuts\n\nthat sounded damn wrong man XD
You're knocking off my nuts\n\nMike, 2017
Dairy free recipe but you used eggs......
Mike just wanted to put his nuts all over that roll but Ben kept getting in the way
But I‚Äôm a girl and I can‚Äôt eat dairy
Wait it says coffee st the start and hazelnut in the title
It has to be nice to have so few allergies in one's circle of acquaintances that dairy free poses a problem. I once made a birthday cake that was nut free, egg free, gluten free, chocolate free, berry free, ¬†stone fruit free and that did not contain lactose, in order to accommodate all the allergies and intolerances within the party-goers. Wasn't the BEST thing I've ever baked, but 1000% worth the effort to see everyone's delight when told that No, there's no gluten/nuts/eggs/etc in there, so you can eat it.
‚Äúlet me guess, someone stole your sweet roll‚Äù
Love the video, but I'm allergic to hazelnuts :(
Very nice, thanks for sharing!
i must try this, thank you.
Hey Mike, you are acting a little strange lately, are you alright?\nBlink twice on the next video if you need help!
Ben almost said Dairy Free Girlfriend at the end don't even try and hide it lad
You can make this vegan by replacing the egg yolks in the cream with silken tofu and the eggs in the cake with aqua faba for the volume and oil for the fat!
Mike''s looking better than eva... so YUMMAYY :)
Ben wins for the first minute with that nose pinch over the glasses...
You're knocking off my nuts \n-Micheal
Could I replace the coffee with something else? Dairy free but I can't stand the taste of coffee..
If he waited until cake was cooled off a little I don't think it would've stuck to the parchment. Can't always cover bad bits with powdered sugar
Oh my god, that looks soo good... I wanna have it!
oh my god Mike don't ignore it >:C
Looking for Jermi in the commnets ;)
That looks yummy even for people who can eat dairy.
I've already become obese watching this. Eating it will kill me for sure.
Swiss rolls are awesome and super tasty so it's awesome that you made a video with this recipe, but you can tell that it's def not perfect. Swiss rolls should be round and the spiral should stand out well otherwise the cake part might not have been made right which is totes fine for just eating with family, but you want to impress your mates right? ;)
Looking good, Mike! Lots of jaw line definition!
Which is the better method for making marshmallows using egg whites or without egg whites?
I understand how weird this is going to sound, but I'm gonna say it anyway.\nWatching Ben roll that pastry was like, oddly sexual? Just me? ü§∑
Looks a bit like it's filled with cold pork gravy... So my challenge for you is this: Make a savory pork swiss roll with gravy!
Wow it is on trending!
aw man i *just* used the hazelnut milk i had sitting around to make a faux alfredo to get rid of it.
I only invited him because our mums are friends - I've never heard anything more relatable than this
How do you milk a hazelnut?
Thanks Jeremy, you gave us a great recipe because of your stupidity
sorted should do a 23andme test!!
If she's dairy free, tell her to suck it up. HOWEVER, if she's lactose-intolerant, then I'd make it this way.
I love you guys, but it's killing me that you didn't trim the ends to make the roll look neater.
Anyone else heard mike say your knocking off my nuts!?
are you guys going to the chocolate show this weekend at kensington olympia?
'It's moist but not wet'üòÇüòÇüòÇ
One thing I always like noticing in the videos is the changing colour of the pan- over time it's gone from black to white because of washing and it's just weirdly fascinating.
I'm sorry, but haven't they already made pretty much the exact same Creme patisserie for the hazelnut croquembouche?
I've never put caster sugar on the outside to keep it from sticking. I always use a little bit of powder sugar. Because of the heat it also melts into the sponge and prevents sticking. Maybe I'll try it out.

You're knocking off my nuts\n-Mike Huttlestone, 2017
Mike is strange.
nothing like a mild, unnecessary transphobic comment when you're trying to watch a recipe video, thanks so much Ben
*instructions unclear, got penis stuck in swiss roll*
I thought eggs were dairy... ü§î
C'mon lads. You can do better than that. The YT pic looks like Harvey Wankstains jizz cloth.
A little bit of icing sugar covers a multitude of sins
why does my recommended show '9 desserts for peanut butter lovers'? Does it think that I am Mike?
does adding egg not make it dairy.......
Can you please do a sweet bake without eggs . Ive mentioned this before but you never seem to do it
What is the purpose of using vanilla paste in place of vanilla extract? Is it more concentrated? Are you trying to limit how much moisture you have to cook off? If it's the latter, could you just use vanilla powder? I only ask, because it's a bit difficult to find vanilla paste in most stores...
Will Almond milk work if I can't find Hazelnut milk?
Every time my mum makes swissroll she also uses a pastrybrush and some water on the back of the paper she baked the roll on when she¬¥s peeling it off, helps it loosen upp a little easier and not break when peeling the paper back :)
Will you ever do anything that isn‚Äôt either vegan, dairy, gluten etc. free ever again
Anyway to replace the caramel? I'm traumatised ever since I got second degree burns from that God forsaken substance
This video to me = fat fuck man knows how to put on make up like a proper woman.\n\nHonestly trending is a boat load of bullshit.

Michael all of the highlights¬†are kilowatt highlighter qqq¬†x
Why are the highlighting sticks SO FUCKING HARD to use. Fenty needs to make them more creamy and less hard
THAT EYELINER TURNS GLITTERY WHEN YOU RUB IT üò©üò©üò© I wanted to see it rubbed and full gleam
Was it me or was there a bunch of fall out when you dipped the brush? Like I saw it raining down or I'm going blind
That's my motto... haha this reminds me of Trunchbull in Matilda.

Am I the only one that hates the packaging of the new lip gloss shades, It just looks cheap for some reason :/
Everytime Michael says Do you know what I mean?  after saying something I almost feel obligated to reply out loud
The name if the highlighter isnt killawatt. The entire highlight collection name are called killwatt highlighters but the ones you used im pretty sure are called mean money and hustle baby lol
Step out of your comfort zone more enough because all these new looks are so gorge! I was getting bored but now I'm intrigued to watch your vids and try new shades myself.
Michael, do a full face using foundation mixed with different food colouring üç≠ü§õüíïü¶Ñüéâü¶ã
Not a fan of the shadows. They look like the really cheap shit you can get at Kostcos here in NZ.
Babes you look really good pale. Keep repping the pale.

when you're american and use all of michaels lingo but none of your friends get it cya #thatsaproblem
I love you and damn you made that foundation work!!!!
How come u don't use the fenty match sticks? Not hate just askin' love ya dal xoxo
I made the same mistake with the foundation!! üíï
9:44 that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt put the stick directly on your face, huns, put it on a brush/beauty blender then apply or even put it your hand first and then apply with your fingers/brush üíï
Michael I'm literally sitting in a physics lecture watching your video PRIORITIES CYA QQQQQQ

I hate fenty foundation! üôà can't help it light colours are ashy medium to dark colours oxidise to literal orange üëãüèª
babe, I think it blended into nothing cause you have to warm up the product first and not to mention you had a reallly light foundation. maybe try different shades? xox
That foundation is way too white üò£üëÄüí≠
The eyeshadow pallet itself looks kind of tacky in my opinion. The shadows look good though :)
I enjoy so much wathing michael. You make my day an you are fucking amazing
Michael you can find the rose gold palette which is your holy grail and it is going to be discontinued you can find it on cult beauty ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hey Michael, love your videos! I just wanted to let you know that Fenty beauty does have concealers, they are the match sticks :) Love ya xo
The eyeliner turns glittery when you rub it!!
16:05 the lip shake üòÇ so weird
I'm fucking LIVING for that eye look, you look so good in bright colors üòç
Try rubbing the highlight stick on the back of your hand to warm it up first and then apply it‚ú®
You should of got a different shade that‚Äôs why the it doesn‚Äôt really look right
Hi I am your digest fan and you inspire me and you are so beautiful.

Love you Michael! I just started this video and my 3 year old son heard your voice and came running to watch your video we love you üòò
Has anyone noticed oxidizing issues with the Fenty Beauty foundation?? Because I got a shade lighter than what I usually am and it oxidized very ugly and I had to use another foundation over it.
Can't believe we live in a society where people genuinely believe those eyebrows and lips look attractive on a human being. You look like a god damn fucking alien.
I‚Äôm not homophobic but Jesus fucking christ what is this
HAA GAYYYY
Bruh why a dude wearing makeup

That Noah Cyrus. The IQ of a piece of bark for sure.
Ricegum took the L
Noah is fucken retarded
Shaw is a legend with Thriller!!!
As not to offend I'll be politically correct. She is mentally and aesthetically challenged. Fuck it, she's ugly and stupid. Sitting next to Mandy, she looks even more like a mongoloid white trash  C.H.U.D. ( look that one up if you aren't familiar with the reference.) I've seen hobo shit by a highway overpass that was prettier than that girl. She's only on TV because the rest of her retard family is somewhat famous. Seriously though, fuck all y'all C.H.U.D. loving S.O.B.s  Muahahahahahaha!
Noah Cyrus is definitely lacking a few chromosomes, God I've never seen anyone so fucking stupid. Something definitely went wrong at birth
This is password not charades.
Why didn't anyone ask why she guessed pimple? I don't get it....
Love when they play Password. They should have more hip hop artist do this like they did with Gucci and 2 Chainz
Stay in school kids
Noah is stupid just like her sister :)))
Geez y'all really coming for Noah over a game??
Jimmy looks like he lives on Shaq's shoulder and is so happy he's been allowed down for a while
Jeez, was Shaq sitting in front of everyone else or is he just a huge mutha?
Am I the only one that thinks Noah's personality blows.
Mandy Moore .....My biggest regret in life is not jacking off to your CANDY video when i was younger ....but it's NBD
Jimmy is just a grown ass KID. He gets so excited and competitive in the games. Love him!
Noah Cyrus...I thought she was some girl from the audience.  Mandy Moore has always been so hot
I was hoping shaq would say toe for camel üòÇüò≠
When I see Mandy Moore I just wanna sing stupid Cupid stop pickin on me ü§£
It's been evident for a while now that the days of Higgins saying, this is password, not pass-charades is long gone.
Either I am too old, sexist or just out of touch but I have no clue who the women are at all.
Jimmy is a cheater he acted thriller before the clue word he always cheats
My fav game in life
that superman emblem ring is crazy
good thing Mileys sister is pretty... i mean rich
Isn‚Äôt that cheating, u can‚Äôt use body movements?!
why is she relevant
Damn, people are ruthless in the comment section.
Yes guys keep hating on Noah so she can gain fame like Danielle bregoli
Noah looks like she belong in a bad hentai porn.
fuck the haters! Noah try her best üíñ
get noah out of here omg shes only here cuz on miley
Thats funny how they give Jimmy points before he or Shaq even answered
No shade, but on the real, Why does Noah look Korean?
Noah looks like shelley Duvall in the shining
Does anyone else think Noah Cyrus looks like a damn alien that was sent to the Cyrus family to be the ugly one
While Cause! Was awesome, it was no IT
Proof of nepotism in the entertainment industry.....Noah Cyrus.
The Michael Jackson thriller was a great clue
I was thinking of Mandy Muse...
‚ÄúThe password is...‚Äù üòèüòèüòèüòç‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅüôåüôÉüòòüòâ xxx
Ewww. Noah lookin like some garbage. Guess Miley got the looks. She does have pipes though.
WHERE did they find Mandy she is SOOO gorgeous. Loved her when her career was more active
I want both their camel toes together
noah cyrus Looks like she's stretched. Like her face hurts to be a face.
You always win when you have Shaqstradamus on your team.
That chick Cyrus, straight up looks Chinese ü§î
At least Noah can sing... Not the brightest spark it seems
This is like the simplest game ever. How do you mess this up?
I saw Shaquille O'Neal at the Cheesecake Factory
kids theese days. got that camel toe right away and bumped at the bark. smh
I always love hearing Quest Love's laugh in the background
Mandy and I think the same.
bruh, the thriller thing was cheating... hes only supposed to use words
That moment at 6:20 when Shaq is showing Jimmy the card
*Stay In School Kids*
Shaq is a gift to this world
The chick in white was deaaaaaaaad
I thought Mandy Moore's clues before she said them.
If only Allen Ludden was here
Slobbering sloths slurping liberal snot through cocaine straws used by liberal sexual deviants. Most public are blind sheep drugged by lies but refusing to wake. The world is crashing then will be burning the worm in the stomach will not heel.
its kinda scary how jimmy seems to have an addiction to cheating.

For the second clue I would've said Toe \nEdit: And there it is, fucking Mandy Moore lmao. Also Jimmy is a dirty cheater, you can't give a word clue and verbal clue!
why is noah relevant again?
I'd fuck the asian girl in the ass
Good thing Noah Cyrus has a famous family üòÖ
Ahh!¬†I finally just shared my coming out story!!
Why does Noah Cyrus look like she is trying to be asian Robert Smith.
Noah? Did ya‚Äôll mean *Billy the Puppet*
Wonder what the password was for Harvey weinsteins room ü§£
If you haven't watched the video yet just skip to 5:02
He cheated at 0:55
I know this is mean but Noah Cyrus looks like a ..potato
Is Noah a Kardashian? she's dumb af

Hey Kimmel, how about you ask another 18 year old to guess what's in your pants!?\n\nDOWN WITH HOLLYWOOD MISOGYNISTIC GARBAGE
Hey Kimmel, you got anything to say about how you're best buddies had no problem covering up for a sexual predator, which was apparently a known thing in Hollywood?\n\nDidn't think so. Proceed with ignoring Leftist douchebaggary.
You expect logic from Idiot Jr
Bring  back the girls jumping on trampolines!  Oh wait, that was from the time when you were a man.  LOL
I wonder what Crowder and them will have to say about this lol.
Rest of hollywood are busy slamming Harvey Weinstein and Kimmo is busy attacking Trump.
Think its about time you two had a beer together & chill the f**k out üëç
Kimmel Clip Resurfaces of Kimmel Having Women Guess What‚Äôs In His Pants: Maybe ‚ÄòPut Your Mouth On It‚Äô

*real rappers get shot, while snoop...*\n\n\n\n*...has to be put down*
How much were those health care premiums to Kimmel? How about trying to live off of poverty salary & paying health care premiums that triple in one year!!!!!!!!!!!  how about you try to take care of a child when you see your health care premiums triple because of a socialist takeover of healthcare... U should be ashamed of yourself U R pathetic and you don't care about anyone except getting into the halls of power how... about more do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do  huh? http://www.dailywire.com/news/22161/watch-moral-compass-kimmel-has-series-women-grope-hank-berrien
Hey Jimmy, Your offended by trumps sexist remarks? Really you Jimmy? Are you sure you don't want to wander the streets some more and think about being offended by words Jimmy? Maybe stop random females play a nice relaxing game of Guess what's in my pants?
So Trump is repetitive because he says some words more than once in his lifetime?
No industry says more than Hollywood to condemn misogyny(SYMBOLISM); and no Industry does more to protect its own rapists/pedophiles than Hollywood(SUBSTANCE)----Got to love the double standards.
Hah! Junior walked himself right into it twice in a row, what a shmuck. Jimmy knocked it out of the ballpark.
meanwhile the satanists molest and rape kids and kimmel is happy taking paychecks from them
I miss the late night shows being funny!
jimmy Kimmel u should do another whats in my pants skit that was so funny smh...
jimmy kimmel the king of SJW's. the most beta male ever walked on planet earth.
All you can do is talk about trump and cry about trump every week talk about real issues like harvey weinstein
Nice subtle reference to Friends and the fact Joey doesn't know how to use air quotes when he punches Ross in the face. Sorry ;)
I wish you luck America.
Smh we're all taking an L for the very fact this is a thing...
I love jimmy so much
Jimmy kneels for the national anthem
that is the biggest damn spliff i've ever seen
snoop is the funniest person i have ever seen
Im fron England but Jimmy for president!!!!!!
And Melania said fake orgasm. Trump should go back to his Twitter love affair with Rob Pattinson
I swear to god that I heard Barack can tell you until he repeated it slowly.
Jimmy Kimmel is a child molester. He is covering for Harvey Weinstein because he has proof of Kimmel's assaults.
Donald trump is the worst president so far. Fr fr he yells too much and he always angry at something. With his twitter fingers.
That's right, get your flu shot goy.
you SAVAGE I love jimmy
Don Jr, you ASSHAT! Brought a knife to a gun fight!
Trump has a small vocabulary.
Kimmel: One of the most faithful butt plugs that the Luciferian globalist bankers own. So silly.
Jimmy is a savageüòÇ
Donny Jr. is in enough trouble for being the ‚ÄúFredo‚Äù of the family (this is from inside the White House), so he should keep his thumbs up his ass.
Now that's how it's done. Thanks, Jimmy!
Jimmy is going to go missing!  Don't blame the PRESIDENT!
I love it goes to show Trump Jr is as smart as his dad. What happened to don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
It's only for your very red eyes only üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump is draining the swamp. Weinstein is the latest to go down the toilet. Who's next?? It's so exciting.
I guarantee you sounds like the start of a Broadway number!
This man is a SAVAGEEEüò≠üò≠üëåüèΩ
and just like that another meme war has begun
As someone named Joey, you have my full support in calling him anything else... PLEASE!
Jimmy‚Äôs balls must be bigger than whatever is bigger than normal human balls lol
America you assassinated the wrong president
damn, of all the people to start a very public battle with- jimmy is the last person any sensible human being would pick.\n.

jimmy is a savage lmao
Talk show hosts are only there to kiss up to celebrities and promote their movies.
what are the words con-artists boast all the time ? Believe me, I guarantee you, That I can tell you, etc.
I am surprised he didn't cry this time. Especially when he does penguin stance for this show and every show.
I am going to unsubscribe. ITS GONNA BE HUUUGE.          just kidding
Remember when late night tv wasn‚Äôt political soap boxes?
I'm surprised he didn't start crying
Equal Time? Wtf does he means, he gets all the time, he's the biggest news there is, if he wants good comments he better start doing good things and give them something good to say!!!!!
Donald Trump is a such sexual predator too.
If Jimmy were any more less woke he'd be in a coma.
Adam Corolla is rolling over in his grave right now.
Am I the only one concerned that the presidents son, and some comedians, think rape and sexual assault are subjects for comedy? :/.  Why would comedians be talking about Weinstein accusations?
Don't forget to send Unc that footage.
Lol DTJ roasted kimmel. Kimmel got desperate and posted that video.
This is pathetic üôÑ
Kimmel is my favorite Jimmy!
See all the Trumpanzee snowflakes on here, whining. Guess they want Jimmy to be politically correct, and not hurt Little Donnie's feelings. Babies.
Kimmel is a freekin agenda pusher...how is that appealing to anyone with an independent mind?
I'm sorry, but Kimmel got destroyed on Twitter. People are posting a video of Kimmel making girls grab his crotch on TV üòÇ
‚úÖ..Eminem  is a 44 year old..‚Ä¶‚ï≠‚à©‚ïÆ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)‚ï≠‚à©‚ïÆ.....washed up ass wipe fool!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jFJTZkMc40~ \nWe can't wait to vote for President Trump in 2020 Again... lol
Jimmy would rather support a dictator like kim, what a shame
Thin orange skin
Jimmy Kimmel has armed security (armed with guns that is) which he recently increased. If he demands they disarm he'll have some credibility - Michael Moore has armed security - same thing.
Absolutely disgusting what im hearing out of kimmels mouth makes me sick to my stomach #StayWoke

Why do people keep talking about right wing and left wing like they are two polar opposite things ? They are both within the same political system and support the same ideology. Yes there are differences but I don't think you should ever declare yourself loyal to one or the other. I don't see how anyone could stand by every decision without question. I agree with some republican policies and agree with democratic policies. I don't agree with every decision my closest friends make for THEMSELVES never mind a party of hundreds of people who make decisions which affect me. I also think people need to separate their personal dislike on an individual and focus on what they agree or disagree on what a party of politicians are doing: any decision trump makes needs to go through Congress. If you disagree with how the votes were collected, or the fact the previous president ran out of his allotted time or even how decisions on policies are made you have an issue with the political system- not one man. I don't like trump, but instead of criticising him for things which are not his fault, or twisting his words on things like illegal immigrants and instead making that seem like racism, when I don't think anyone should be allowed to enter a country, any country illegally, people should be focussing on what he's doing with the platform of power he holds and the policies he creates or supports, rather than bashing his appearance or something he said a million years ago. If you use petty, irrelevant things to justify your dislike or disdain for him it sounds like you cannot come up with enough legitimate reasons to support your argument. If someone is bad for a country or is abusing their power you should not need to make things up to justify your opinion.
B CAREFUL WHAT JIMME STARTS CRYIN ABOUT,sshhhhhh,(might not b in yer best intrests)
Press business is next to be exposed.
Like Women don't sexually harass men too. Puh-Lease.
He didn't do anything that Bill Clinton didn't do, and all those women would gush over Bill Clinton if they met him.
Such bold women. Coming out and denouncing a man's actions that they said were no surprise to them. It's really brave to distance yourself from someone that you kept silent about after they got caught and divert the topic to how the everyman does it.\nCelebrities are trash. You're a moron if you don't want this industry culled and repopulated decent human beings.
Who cares.  I bet they did it for fame. It's obvious.  How many women suck their bf/ husbands dick for gifts.  Same thing.
Weinstein looks like a guy who has been serially harassing and raping women for decades.
This winesteine dude is the kind of dude that gives all of us guys a bad name...
Weinstein is also a person who funded Democrats for office. This shows who liberals really are and how they have no morals
Insane that this is topping the news coverage while NAFTA is about to collapse... ¬†I can't.. I can't believe it.
it's really good seeing so much attention given to this. thank you.
And the hoes kept silent cause he paid them gold diggers
Ima catch hell for this one....  & if you get what saying... HELP!                            \n Not placing the blame on women. not at all. and certainly not any victim of unwanted harassment. The help part... Men need to learn the toe the line approach and read reaction. Some chics will hop on you for being sleezy; like they can't help themselves; they want it!   ... some, are very offended. (some men go way too far though)
These are the writers for this show. No wonder its not funny
He's the type of guy who slips in the shower and tries to grab onto the water...
Harvey is a great guy! Helped a lot of democrats!!!
This is literally a part of the problem. Fucking pathetic. Shame on you, late night
Was this funny? Waste of time
The black chic was not shocked, huh?  What kind of an environment does she live in.
The girl in the leather jacket reads off a TelePrompTer better
So where are all the conservetards claiming late night hosts never criticise liberals? \n\n_* tumbleweed *_\n\nYup.
I like how no one's really laughing because those women aren't funny at all.
Ugh... the expression casting couch has existed forever. So I am shocked than anyone was shocked.
That was about as funny as a root canal. WTF
The black woman looks like a tranny.
You see ladies... If you never went out with strange men without a chaperone until you were married you could never ever be raped or sexually harassed.\n\nThere are systems in place for thousands of years to keep you safe....\n\nBut if you dress like whores and go to a frat house and have 23 drinks and then pass out with no underpants on a couch wearing a micro mini skirt... That's not part of the system and we cannot protect you.
Weinstein should obviously suffer for what he's done. This however was a terrible segment that's less about the case and more about if he's done this then he's definitely done that. This sort of thinking takes people away from the actual situation and more into their own imagination.
Hmmm so to stop harassment we will make a segment full of women spitting on each other. Lots of spitting.
Trump's wall is a fema camp prison wall
I love Seth's show but that video of the women in the office, that was tragically bad.
Why say ALL men are creeps. I don't think all women are cheating lying creeps so why label us all the same. They are calling their own fathers creeps too
I didn't find them funny at all
Being holier than thou is not funny. This Harvey Weinstein situation has plenty of comedic promise but the constant beat down without any angle is boring. These people are doing comedy a disservice.
You know, to be honest, I disagree with many of these people on different issues (besides this), but honestly I'd love to just sit down with them and just talk politics in a civil manner
These women look so unnatural on camera...üòí
I really appreciate these women making a big statement about this issue, but they did it in the most annoying way.
I agree that it's bad that nothing will happen to him,  but I don't think the solution it to assume every man is a creep and every woman has been harassed. Isn't the point of feminism to reach equality not put yourselves above men? How about let's not give people with this hypocritical world view national publicity...
I get that you are trying to send a good message. But this is very cringy. There could have been a funnier way to roast the creep. It seems extremely scripted and nothing seems like actual improv. The Jared from subway joke was the only part I ever thought was funny. The water spitting is annoying and gross. Please be funnier, it'll be hella savage.
All I can think about now is what improv school these ladies attended, and if they are talking about one person or more.
liberals need to be spoken to like retards, as not to break there conditioning, we must stop liberal evil
No idea who any of these women are
Also, Groot got  a 3 picture deal... coincidence?  I think not.
It's fascinating to watch these paid-insiders bend Weinstein's actions away from criminality with 'humor'. They also leverage HW's crimes to promote socio-political Leftism to the public at large, avoiding further commentary on HW's crimes.  YTube is already phasing HW out of the 'Trending' list.  In 2 weeks, some new Vegas crisis will blossom, and most will have fogotten HW.

Hollywood hypocrisy.  Smh.
that wasn't v3ry funny
Are these 3 women funny?
Here comes Harvey. Hide your plants.
Die you sjws and feminists, scum.
Welcome to Hollywood
so many Danielle Thomases
Lying gold diggers look like these bitches spit not swallow
These women accusing Weinstein  are lying just like Broderick.
Nihga noone cates
Harvey Weinstein = Donald Trump
Creep, probably enjoyed the videos of women spitting all over each other. Did you think that through first?
The three women in this video are like feminists being roasted and plus if a woman did this would yall care ?
Harvey Weinstein is a creep, but this quickly devolved a feminist circle bean flick.
Not an ounce of funny.
good god, these ladies are on point, just not funny...
These bitches look like the women who get roasted in feminists videos üòÇ
Maybe this show isn't funny because there are so many women writers.
Lol I'm like wow these girls have it good, where I come from you're supposed to just accept that men are creeps and you certainly get no cash payout for the drama creepy men put you through.
It's crazy even a behemoth of a man like Terry crews seem to be effected. If they're not scared of assaulting him what are they doing to the little guys?
What he did and said was 100% terrible and disgusting. No honorable respectable person could do the things he's done. That being said, not all men are creeps or sexual predators. Generalization is a thin and cheap method of presenting facts.
I mean this guy sucks but these women arent the least bit funny
If someone said anything mean about women it‚Äôs sexist but they can generalize men and call them creeps and side note that was the worst attempt at being funny honestly so bad (not supporting rape or Weinstein)
Another Jew who should be dead.
I want to know who the improv coach is....
Big fat Hollywood Jew is a sexual opportunist. I mean, these news stories are such a shock when they break.
I love that UC for Cinematic Arts is refusing the endowment!
Blame it on all men üòÇ SJW cunts this is why trump won haha THE RIGHT LIVES ON
Did all of you pathetic losers finally get your marching orders from your king to go ahead and sacrifice Weinstein it‚Äôs OK to come out now we decided he‚Äôs going to be the sacrifice you guys are sick
Seth?? When are you gonna hire some funny people??
These 3 come off as annoying and not funny. Of course they do write for Seth Myers. that explains so much.
OK  Now we know  about Weinstein do we need to watch it 24/7 ?  OR HEAR  from his Third Cousin on his Mom's side that She saw him  Snap a Girls Bra Strap in 6th Grade   and she wondered about him back then if that was a  sign of future events    WTF .   \n\nIt's like Fox, MSNBC, CNN need a  Breaking News  story that goes on for a week EVERY WEEK.    I want the days when  a Water Skiing Squirrel was the Big News .\n\nOH and  Gwyneth Paltrow? Really ?  We all know Weinstein  needs help but it's far more serious then first thought ..
These hoes are not funny at all
Yeah, I was shocked that people were shocked.
The last part was not needed!
Men could just stop being such ******* creeps.\n\nWould it have been so hard to say These men and not blame the entire gender?
Why is the black woman there, it's not like she would've gotten sexually assisted by him, she's too ugly...
Can I just say this of all the late night hosts Seth is the only one that involves writers in the actual live show giving them actual credit. Unlike Colbert being hailed for his monologue on Trump which most definitely is written for him Seth gives them more than just credit on google. This man deserves more ratings, more views, more subscribers and much much more praise.
What about what he said off camera \n\nhttps://youtu.be/XBs1wBMRDcY
I don't really believe Seth Meyers have no idea about this. Apparently, everyone in Hollywood knew about this.
This is tv fans way of understanding the situation.
Was this supposed to be funny???
AND I JIZZED IN MY PLANTS!
Not approving of Weinstein actions, but it's the same feminist and liberals in Hollywood condemning Weinstein and his actions who gave Polanski the man who drugged and raped a 13 year old girl in a hot tub a standing ovation at the oscars, Hollywood is a disgusting place and obviously is full of people who rather hide up serious issues like sexual assault or child pedophilia to avoid tarnishing hollywoods good name, disgusting!
*sexually harassing women - and then paying them for keeping quiet*\n*...doesn't make sense! you can pay women to sexually harass them...*
üò± that was Corny, Weinstein thought Libtards will forgive him like they did Bill Clinton but the Truth is out Liberals are Evil.
Wow women are really unfunny
A white bill cosby..
Dumbass Feminists, Equally as much an Oxygen Thief as Leftards & Moslems.....
Women aren't funny.
UGH cringe
Stupid. _ _ _ dumpsters...three potted plants that can talk

TO GOVNO TREBA UBITI!
Dear Sufjan: you are never allowed to leave us. Signed, your affectionate co-dependent sycophant.
Subaru Sedans is at it again.
No greater example of musical flexing than calling a track this good an outtake
I'm still waiting for MYSTERY OF LOVE
I did not expect this to come out.\nNor did I expect it to be of this scope and beauty.\nAn absolute contrast to other carrie and lowell songs.\nIt sounds as if I'm deep in the sea, admiring the beauty of the dragon from below.\n\nThank you, Mr Subaru
Thank you, Sufjan, for making my day so much better!
Like a continuation of Carrie and Lowell with added brass and strings... And the lyrics too, just wow
I can't even get mad anymore at Suf for making me this sad.
The most beautiful voice I ve heard. I adore this artist I don't think I am wrong in saying that he is a beautiful person, I really feel connected with Sufjan. I've attended so many concerts, so found of so many music styles, but when I saw Sufjan on stage both in France where I come from and in Dublin where I live,  I really feel he was welcoming us at home. So cosy, funny yet magical atmosphere. It makes me shiver anytime I listen to him,. Sometimes I feel nostalgic in a beautiful way listening to his songs, yet I never feel alone as I have the feeling to be with a spiritual, kindly friend. I feel so happy. I even suffered panic attacks following a trauma for a while, and listening to Sufjan was always the soothing way to chill down. I just wish him the best in his life, he is giving so much to many of us, I wish he realises the impact he has on turning our lives better, isn't it the most beautiful goal to achieve to make someone happy?
Oh how I adore the etherial sounds of Sufjan Stevens!
It's too early in the morning for this
Tears are running down my cheeks.
Daddy Suf blessing us once again üôèüèºüëèüèºüôèüèºüëèüèº
thanks for my life soof
I'm from Wallowa lake and the lake monster is actually a real urban myth from the Nez Perce Tribe I was told growing up:) this makes me so happy.
How is Sufjan actually allowed to do this???
I cry, but smile, but also cry and smile to Surfman's music like a little bitch.\nHold me.
HOLY FUCK
Thanks for the birthday present!
I'm not crying, you are.
Carrie & Lowell part 2. I'm here for it, daddy!
WALLOWA LAKE MONSTER (lyrics):\n\nAs if you know the story of Wallowa Lake\nLeviathan first hid in the deep where her children sleep\nShe kept them hidden from the plague\nBut have you heard the story of my mother‚Äôs fate?\nShe left us in Detroit in the rain with a pillow case\nFortune for the paper weight\n\nWe followed her to Joseph, near the Indian raid\nShe wept among the weeds, hide and seek, for the fallen chief\nSpathiphyllum on his grave\nAnd like the cedar wax wing, she was drunk all day\nWe put her in the sheet, little wreath, candles on the crate\nAs the monster showed its face\n\nAs she waits for her children in the shade\nDemogorgon or demigod the ghost parade\nNo oblation will bring her back to our place\n\nShe stayed within the deep end of Wallowa Lake\nThe undertow refrained with the flame of a feathered snake\nCharybdis in its shallow grave\nShe gave us one last feature, the fullness of her face\nIn the shade of Hin-mah-too-yah‚Ä¶ (Red Napoleon)\nAs the demon took her place\n\nAs we wait for the waters to reside\nHer remarkable stoicism and her pride\nWhen the dragon submerged we knew she had died
Every time I hear Suf's voice on a new track, I fall in love all over again <3
Sufjan, and Porches put out new music in the same day?I can't handle this.
why does he take forever to release albums -.-
Subaru Sedans is at it again.\ni can bet he is not using *A U T H E N T I C VIEWS D O T C O M* to get views \nas he is talented
Man I used to swim in wallowa lake all the time as a kid.
Had a crappy day. This made it better
thanks so much for this and carrie and lowell. no one talks about complicated relationships with their mother
Been a fan since time began. Keep inspiring creative genius!
I looked at the picture and nutted
Sufjan I would do anything for you
This is so beautifull. Thank you, thank you !
this is literally just a sonic fusion of age of adz and carrie and lowell lol
*this is wine to my ears - both bitter and sweet at the same time*
Thank you, yet again Sufjan, for saving my life
Surfism Stovens is the musician of the century.
Omg omg is there a new album coming!

There are sad days, and there are days Suf releases new music. These days are also sad, but in a good way. Thank you, Sadjan Stevens.
Carrie & Lowell Part 2: Electric Boogaloo
This dude is  unbelievable.
Our boy got #20 on trending! üí™
thank you suf
I feel like the more Sufjan gets old, the more he makes me cry with his music genius. Sufjan is like that husband who really loves his wife as time goes by both of them. \n\nI've been following him since 2008 and I'm still in love with him until now. And I'm afraid if tomorrow I'll not see your face again.
I am crying and I don't know why
Honestly since A Sun Came I don't think he's come out with a lackluster song/b-side.  This song continues that trend.
started crying around 2:20 what a day
I was waiting for this  ... And wait is over :D  A SUFJAN FAN
Think this is a B-side
if i weren't at the uni library right  now (supposed to be studying) i would be crying...
All I can  think about when listening to  this song is ‚Äúrhubarb rhubarb walla walla‚Äù
And now I'm dead!üòµ

If his goal was to compete for the most depressing lyrics with the saddest music ever written, I think he quite easily achieved the victory. Every suggestion for a competitor is welcome
Ehm, John Wayne Gacy Jr. + Should Have Know Better?
You are the Bob Dylan of our generation.
Too good to be true... oh wait, is Sufjan Stevens!\n\nSubscribe the new IndiependentMood channel for more songs like this!\n‚û§ Just sit and enjoy music.
Fodeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Meh
DADDY I MISSED YOU
omg dead
Dearest heart, you feel it rising do you not? How we love you and want you to know of our gratitude, simply for YOU Sufjan, Lowell and all in the family that is life. As an aside this notification came through while I am covered in hospital sheets. Too many hospital stays simply trying to keep death (life?) at bay... this is a gift I take with me on day 3. You lulled me to sleep last night with Carrie and Lowell and Planetarium on repeat. I am no longer afraid. I merely want release... we're all going to die. Look right into the light lovelies. It Wont.Hurt.A.Bit... Has your prayer only been LOVE? GOOD. For love is all...
Is this like B-side from Carrie and Lowell? Or from a new album? Sounds fantastic as usual. Still can‚Äôt wait for Call Me by Your Name tracks
Boy, another goosebumps attack, just like the first time I heard the entire Carrie & Lowell album :')
18 days left.
I 100% get the texture thing, all my friends and family think I'm a picky eater but it's not necessarily that I don't like the taste of the food, but it's the texture. This video has inspired me to try and cook something with my arch nemesis: mushrooms. :)
I really needed this video today <3
you're hair looks amazing!!! it really compliments your face <3
I don't know if you will get to read this because there are so many comments already! I really relate to what you're saying, I was underweight because I couldn't eat when I was stressed, which was all the time pretty much. I struggled with food because of textures too! Also, when I started up a relationship, with who is now my husband, everything changed for me. He was so encouraging and ate so many different foods, and there was no pressure to like them. If I didn't like a vegetable he would ask why and find something else I might get on with, or suggest cooking it in different ways like roasting broccoli for example. I don't eat perfectly but feel so much healthier, I'm happy with my weight and have alot more confidence in myself. My point being that you've done amazingly, and I can really appreciate the progress you've made
Maybe try trampolining classes for fitness? Could be really fun and a great throwback!
Thank you for making this video Keira! \n\nyour food videos have always been a big help to me, reminding me how important it is for me to be chill about food, eat that ice cream, try that fake cheese ect \nveganism has also done so so much for me in repairing my very broken relationship with food
I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down. That is until almost 10 months ago I went vegeterian and like you said tried out a lot of new foods like lentils or all kind of veggies. Sure enough without even  focusing on it I slowly over the months lost some weight. I don't really like the scale so I only noticed It when my clothes especially pants felt looser and people started mention it. It really is a feeling from within it just feels right. A healthier mind got me a healthier body that I'm slowly accepting for what is :) - loved hearing of your story and experience. You show food in a very natural and easy way that I think a lot of people understand better myself included üòä
how the fuck is this trending gtfo
I can relate to this so much I've grown up as the most awkward fussy eater, my mom would always cook me my own separate dinner without any veggies in cause I hate certain textures. It's got so bad that me and my partners friends won't invite us out to certain restaurants because they worry I will not be able to eat anything on the menu üòû I feel like I really need to be open minded to trying new foods especially fruit and veg. I'm really glad you did this video it made me feel like I'm not the only one who has food struggles ‚ù§
Great video! I was also a very plain picky eater as a kid (only ate white food i.e. Chicken and potatoes) so I can relate a lot! I started being more adventurous with food (also as a result of meeting my boyfriend) and now I love trying new things my family are constantly amazed at the change üòúüòú have you tried any recipes from Monami Frost's vegan cookbook?
You look extremely beautiful always. and i think you are a great person
Thanks so much for sharing your journey with us! :) \nI felt the same when I went vegan - I lost some weight, but I gained a whole new world of delicious food, compassion, knowledge and I feel the best I've ever felt - the weight is just a thing that happened along side that!
I admire you so much....i am 69, and been vegan for 9 months and have lost 47 pounds.  I wish i had figured out some of these things when i was your age.  You rock!
Great video! It was so interesting to learn more about your lifestyle. Thanks for sharing. :)
Thank you for sharing your story. It is a brave thing to do and it's a brave thing to share what you eat to the world especially if you've struggled with food in your lifetime because people can be really brutal online. Here you are not hiding behind a veil like the people who judge you are and putting yourself out here and it's really inspiring. I love to hearing that despite the judgement you recognize your own personal achievements like eating a variety of foods. I can't tell you how much this really does help. You seem like such a sweet person and I really enjoy your videos and hope you enjoy inspiring others with what you make.
Thanks for sharing your journey! Sorry you suffered a traumatic event that affected you so adversely! Just look at how far you‚Äôve come!! Be kind to yourself!! Love your channel!
Veganism has also changed my life! It's so lovely when things fall into place. Thanks for sharing your story. It resonated with my own story so much.
At 21 years old I‚Äôve never met or even heard anyone else being so ‚Äòfussy‚Äô with food like me. For as long as I can remember I‚Äôve struggled with the textures of food and in consequence have a really basic diet, also being vegetarian that doesn‚Äôt even eat fruit and veggies is practically unheard of lol. It‚Äôs so reassuring hearing that you‚Äôve managed to overcome this your self and gives me hope for the future that I can do this myself
Awww Kiera. I still remember asking if you were vegan a long while ago and you said you weren't yet. Your journey is amazing. So many animals saved. You look so beautiful , you always have quite frankly...oh and the grown out fringe definitely becomes you! <3 from Long Beach, CA USA
I bloody love your what I ate videos. I think it shows what real life is like and that not everyone is a health nut. Vegan ism personally isn't for me but I think your videos also show that veganism isn't just a bunch of salads all the time. You're looking fabulous and as long as you are happy then that's brilliant üëèüèªüíï
Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.\n\nI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.\n\nI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. \n\nTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.\n\nI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.\n\nKeira - thank you for being so honest. You're honest and have no shame and it means that people like me can be honest too. \n\nLove you x
Oh my god this video was so personal thank you for sharing üíó your thoughts from childhood were so heartbreaking but comforting at the same time to hear someone else feel the same. I'd like to think that if our younger selves knew each other, they would have been pals üíó
Such a lovely and inspiring video...I can really relate to your story and struggle. Well done on getting so far! Xxx
Great video Kiera! Talking about food and diet on here (especially if you're vegan) can be so nerve-wracking! I used to be a pretty picky eater myself but once I cut out meat from my diet I was sort of forced to try so many new things - most of which I really enjoyed! I follow Dana too, she's so unbelievably helpful. ohsheglows is pretty amazing too ^_^ Hope you and Alex had a lovely anniversary!
thank you for sharing your story <3\ni've also struggled with food my whole life, had anorexia as a teen, but now that i'm vegan (been vegan for 14 months) my symptoms have lessened significantly, i feel a lot less guilty about eating and have managed to maintain a healthy & stable weight - i think the knowledge that i'm making a difference by eating plant-based really helped me feel better about food\ni've also been going to therapy which has helped, and figuring out the root causes for my mental health issues has given me so many tools to improve
I think everyone in the comments will hate me for this but... In one of your really earlier videos I did make a comment to you about my concern that there was a lack of vegetables and fruit and now I really regret what i wrote, I wasnt trying to be rude I thought I was trying, in my weird way, to look out for you. I thought I was being helpful, but wasn't aware of the issues you faced, so I want to take this moment to apologise, I'm sorry and I really hope that I didn't offend you.

You are the only person that helped me stop feeling ashamed of being a size 16 because I think you are so unbelievably beautiful and it helps me think that I might be beautiful too ‚ù§
Anyone who would dis your diet or lifestyle or tear apart your daily menu must be extremely disillusioned by something that has absolutely nothing to do with you, personally.  Every video you make is honest and non judgmental to anyone out there. Why there are people out there in the www (is that an old term?, I'm over 50 yo so sorry if I'm not up to date), who seem to seek out reasons to hurt people are doing well in their lives? Hopefully these few ( and I sincerely hope they are few) who feel they must take time out of their day to make disparaging remarks about ANY of your videos will soon realize that it's not YOU or anyone else but THEY who have a problem. Sorry to go on for so long.
so important! amazing video hun x\ni've noticed it's quite common for many people that after going vegan their relationship with food changed. \nin my case...I don't want to say that I forgot about my ED but it just....I don't know, different things started to be more important and I was just so excited about foods? With trying new things - high five. As a kiddo the only veggies I ate were chips and mushrooms. Maybe cauliflower. And now? Look at me! For dinner today I had bowl of SALAD bigger than my head :P\nI'm so happy that you're doing better and that you having back control over what's happening :*\nLots of love :*\n\nalso - vegans judging other vegans over who's more vegan - GTFO\nanimals don't care if you eat raw till 4, if you're frutarian, if you juicing all day or if you stuff your face with mac n cheese. As long as it's vegan, you're good to go!
You are #22 trending! Really interesting video I went vegan almost two years ago and it really changed the way I thought about food. Also it helped with binge eating (for me chocolate) when things aren't vegan I have absolutely no desire to eat them üëåüèΩ
this video was so honest and real and from the heart <3 thank you for sharing Kiera, you'll have helped so many xo
I SPY A NEW PLANT BABY!
I agree with other commentators that if you want to exercise more, then find something you LOVE! ^____^ I started hula hooping/ hoop dancing almost 2 years ago, and I love it so much because it is FUN and creative! :) And as a circus skill, anyone can learn it, all it takes is practice!  \nThank you for this video, even if if was super hard for you to do, you did a great job, and you are making me more and more interested in becoming vegan! ^____^ X
YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD
I hadn't eaten all those vegetables or really ANYTHING either until I went veg and pretty much forced myself into it
Your hair is amazing right now
I super related to the taste and texture sensitivity issue. I tell people all the time I can't eat certain foods cuz they feel off to me. Definitely agree that my partner influenced my ability to expand my tastes. Still struggling with my weight but I less overeat and more so eat poorly and lack exercise. Loved this video so much for it's honesty And realness
I'm a fussy eater as well. I also hardly eat fruit because of the textures! It's like you are describing me! I would have to try new foods at friends houses because I didn't want to be rude. I'm 28 now and I'm still fussy but my fiance (got engaged last week after being together 6 years!) has pushed me to try new things and my diet isn't amazing but I'm doing well :)\nThe way I eat fruit now is smoothies! It's the easiest way I find to do it.
Really interesting video Kiera , iv suffered from bulimia since i was 16 at 20 i went vegetarain and it really helped me to feel more comfortable with food. However i still suffer from bulimia and im struggling at the moment with over eating and i feel like im really suffering but i cant stop and i sont know what to do i need help. X
You are truly inspiring and yes! Cooking helps so much when making the transition and it's so much fun to challenge yourself with different recipes. Hot for food is another awesome blog if you haven't checked it out yet.
Just to say that you look absolutely beautiful in this video.  And now I will watch the rest üòÇ
When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore. I struggle everyday with my feelings towards food, but hearing people talk about how they got over their issues with food helps me a little in trying to fix whats going on inside my head.
*you should try proper working out*\n*i used to hate it when i started myself pretty late in life, but then i learned to love it!*\n*most things in life we don't like when we're not good at them, but no one is good at anything he has never tried*
so happy for you!!! i love hearing everything u have to say <3
I'm not vegan or ever plan to be one but I really do enjoy your videos on cooking! It's awesome that you share what you love without trying to push anything on anyone :) Keep up the amazing work!
The pea pesto is my favourite too!
As we grow our taste buds change I don t do well with vegetables but after 19 I started to be able to tolarate them before that I would eat potatoes. My relation with food and weight is also shit, university isn t helping my situation either...
This is like looking in a mirror. God, some of the things you said hit me so hard in the chest. I just have to say, you are not alone and the struggle is real.
You are very brave and beautiful. Thank you for sharing ‚ù§Ô∏èüå±
I struggle with food textures. Like onions. They're a slimy slippery nightmare! But man do they smell good and give off a great flavor.
Find a fight like xena class.
Thank you for this video Kiera! I have struggled with my weight and insecurities my entire life. I started going to the gym last year and it has helped me so much , not only about the weight I just feel better in general <3
have you ever heard of Neophobia? from what you're describing it sounds like you may have had that in the past, but look into it if you don't know what it is and see for yourself obviously! Nice video btw xx
Thank you for sharing, great video. Also your hair looks amazing!
Thanks for speaking so openly about this topic. I was very shy as a child. Although I wasn't overweight, I established a strange relationship with food. I never gained Body Positivity so things like shopping clothes, wearing a swimsuit... are stressful to me. It's good to hear that there are some other people, dealing with this problem.
Honestly, I am so happy that this video didn't really focus on weight loss being the number one topic, but rather your increasing enjoyment of food, how happy it makes you, and how you don't obsess over being perfect about it. I think that sends a great message to younger girls (and old ladies like me - lol) who may be watching your video. And vegans too! From one chill vegan to another - thumbs up for this one. <3
I've always loved the idea of veganism, but I'm afraid of carbs. I have a liver disease where basically I need to lose fat, and they suggest a low carb diet, which has worked so far, but I don't like eating meat since I was raised vegetarian so I feel conflicted. It's hard finding a balance I guess. Thanks for this video, I've always had a complicated relationship with food and it helps hearing other people's perspectives and journeys :D
Thank you so much for sharing. It means a lot to know other people can relate to having a bad relationship with food.\nMy relationship with food is still pretty terrible, but I am actually eating 2 meals every day instead of a something once every 2 days. I have never learnt to cook, as I didn't eat, but I think I am brave enough to try a recipe from the Minimalist Baker.\n\nI am so happy to hear your story and that you have come so far. It gives me hope that I too can one day have a good relationship with food.
I love your look here! You look so natural and healthy and beautiful <3
I look up to you so much, I also had difficulty with my weight in my teens because of family issues and being homeschooled, I wasn't allowed to leave the house but once every other week. I'm still struggling with my relationship with food. You give me hope! Never stop doing what you love!
You're so sweet!!! I think it was really responsible of you to give the 'weight loss' bit some context, even if it means less views. I'm gonna get one of Minimalist Baker's cookbooks because they look amazing, so thank you for recommending her! It's a shame that people held you to some kind of standard, even if it was only because they didn't know what you'd been through. It's difficult enough to talk about food on Youtube, everything seems to get attacked, or picked apart, and food is such a personal topic. It means different things to each person - all mixed up in their personal history and views. Also, what's right for one person might not work for someone else. But thanks for sharing your recipes, I always find it inspiring, and have tried a few things you've shown. Well done for being brave enough to share your story. Keep being you, you're the greatest!
This video was so inspiring! Thanks for being so open and sharing your journey. I always get so excited when I see a new video from you in my subscriptions and I can truly say I'm never disappointed! :)
I know this might sound weird, but I've been pole dancing for a year now and it's helped my anxiety, stress, mental, and physical health so much more than anything else I've done in my life. Dancing makes my soul sing. You will never meet a more supportive and encouraging group of women than the ones you find in a pole studio! I went in at my heaviest (over 300lbs) and no one ever second guessed my abilities and they treated me equally to the other students, which was also something I've never had before.  I really recommend trying it out if it's something you'd be interested in!
Does't she look like Rebecca Black
You are totally my vegan inspiration. I, too, am a vegan on a budget && I actually have food anxieties too! Like I cannot eat certain foods due to texture or colour lol. It's deffinitly strange but hey apparently it's more common than I thought!
Thanks for sharing Kiera üíï I needed this today too üòå not necessarily for food but other things as well. Like something I‚Äôm going through that isn‚Äôt about food really also kind of fits into play with various tings that you said. Sorry I‚Äôm at work and it‚Äôs hard to get the best words across atm. But nonetheless it was really helpful. And I‚Äôm very happy for you and Alex too! \n\nTo share a little story with you: \nI used to be picked on all the time because of how I looked. I wasn‚Äôt seen as pretty and I guess people found me quite weird and day dreamy. I used to not like my teeth and hair because they stuck out a lot and I needed braces that my mum got for me and I wrote them for a good amount of time. To shorten the story a bit I love how I look now. Well some days, lol. I‚Äôm still struggling more with finding who I am and all that so I‚Äôm working on losing weight a bit I‚Äôm currently 165ish as if last week and I want to be back around 135-140/145 which is the healthy weight or whatever but I want to be fitter. But I‚Äôm rambling, lol sorry my mind has been a bit of a jumble lately. üòÖ
I'm so happy you made this video, I have thought and felt so many of the things you talked about in this but I never told anyone because I was so embarrassed.. You become more and more of a favourite youtuber for me with every video. I wish I had a best friend like you! :)
I'm in the process of re-evaluating my relationship with food and my weight.  Seeing this video gave me sense of relief.  Not really sure how else to describe it.  Thanks for  sharing.
You are an inspiring woman. I think this video was super helpful for me. I myself struggle as long as I can remember with food (restriction and overeating). I have this mindset that I need to be perfect to be ‚Äòokay‚Äô and that sometimes makes it difficult. I love the fact that you feel so much better right now and it‚Äôs amazing how honest you are about your past and your struggles.
Oh my god XD I thought it was just me that's gone overboard on cheese! I'm trying to go vegetarian (I did slip up yesterday and my body hated me for it - had a belly ache for ages), mainly for health/weight reasons and all I've done is substitute meat for a LOT of cheese :( Need to make a little note somewhere that reminds me not to eat it every single day.
Thank  you for this video Kiera. I struggle really hard with overeating and also struggle with texture sensitivity and its good to see you overcame it like a champion, it gives me a lot of hope that I can pull through it! <3
Thank you so much for making this video Darling and being so honest <3 i'm struggling with eating a lot,  but veganism is really helping .  LOVE , keep fighting x
My boyfriend was a very picky eater, like, really. He hated tomatoes, peppers, eggplants and zuccini because of bad memories from kindergarden . We've been together for 2 years now and he eats only tomatoes and peppers if they're fresh in a salad. The same reason I hate chicken soup and red meat. I'm nothing near vegan, but it's just the memory of the horrible teacher stuffing chicken skin down my throat.
For exercise you should defo invest in a mini trampoline for your living room! I listen to podcasts while I bounce or watch tv and I love it :)
Thanks for sharing Kiera. I feel like you're a very good story teller. You present each of your videos in such a way that it feels like you're talking to an old friend. It seems so genuine and it's the reason I've been watching you since 2011! Much love and I'm glad you feel that you're in a better place.
I can relate to this video so much, I was such a picky eater, and even now I can't eat fruit, the texture just grosses me out sadly, but going vegan really helped me health wise, I would never in a million years imagine that I would love veg ahah, thanks for sharing Kiera, you're lovely
Oh my god, YES. I went vegan two years ago, my weight hasn't changed (i've always been around a 16-18) and i feel very aware of all the super duper healthy vegans out there when I look at what I'm eating (like I have to label myself a fat vegan to avoid judgement somehow)... I'm so glad you mentioned this, because i also went vegan for the animals and the benefits it's brought me mentally far outweigh anything physical. I always try to ignore these negative feelings I'm prone to, but hearing someone else say it makes me feel a lot better. Thank you  <3
great video from my favourite youtuber <3 i find that with exercise i don't stick out anything even if i enjoy it (e.g. yoga). however, i now use a bike as my method of transport and it means that exercise is a by-product of getting to places which works great for me as i don't have to allot time to exercise :) its also meant that i have lost weight without having to even think about it which is a bonus!
You are so real. Thank you for tackling this huge and complicated subject in such a great way. <3
You're amazingüíú
Love u üíì
I relate to basically all of this. I‚Äôm 22 and I still can‚Äôt figure out my relationship with food. I feel like it‚Äôs never gonna get better :(
‚ÄòTrending‚Äô
Thank you for making this video. I have a bad relationship with food and just hearing you talk about it and saying how you managed to change it... It gives me hope. I love your food videos and even though I cook everyday, I still learn something from you every time.\n\nI know you said you probably won't be making any videos about this again, but if you ever do, know it helps a lot :)\nThank you and stay safe (and Alex tooüíñ)
I didn't like To do exercise at all. Running was a pain and gyms terrified me. 3 months ago, I started boxing (i'm the most non-violent person you've ever met) and I love it. It's different and punching things is so satisfying and it's a good training. I didn't like the idea to train just to loose weight and boxing trains you to have more power and move more easily. I still struggle To go every week but I'm getting there. Maybe you would like it? Thanks a lot for this video üíõ
I have a similar problem with food as I don‚Äôt like any vegetables although I am trying to eat more healthy and try the odd vegetable. My mums vegan and I‚Äôd like to follow in her footsteps and hopefully be vegan one day also. So thank you so much for posting this video x
My mom is not suportiw
Brave girl x
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
That was so brave of you! You really inspired me to confront my own relationship with food and diet. I believe these things we neglect and don't feel comfortable talking about, are the most important topics to learn to talk about. Great video! X
ur very beautiful kiera!!
ilysm ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
your pea pesto recipe is amazing!!
You could do Krav Maga Kiera üí™üí™üí™
I just adore you
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is probably the best martial art for females.
You know what is fricking delicious. \na juicy hamburger
I am so glad to live in¬†the age of¬†YouTube and get to spend a moment with people such as Cliff.
Man I love this guy, but this is the worst kind of teacher xD the kind that gives you an assignment that's actually not an assignment, but a lesson, but he hides this and later criticizes you for not doing it right even though he set you up all along
I overthink things way too much and find very little situations to apply it to. I'm a toolmaker so when you said measure the area I was already thinking of all of those little extra factors before you started rattling them off. Really hard to turn it off sometimes, but occasionally it matters and I work something out that no one else could or I save someone a heap of trouble or something.
Can we find somewhere more of the assignments he used?
Autistic spectrum people are better at finding things not square or level. Often they notice construction mistakes. Buildings look straight to you but they notice some the walls are not perfectly perpendicular to the floor
If Cliff was on the title or thumbnail I would have clicked faster. I was lazing around now I have energy to climb the Everest.
This guy is insane.
This guy seems like The perfect type of maniac with the perfect amount of crazy. I would love to hang out with him
The secret to measuring  a piece of paper is that your teacher may be pranking you.
I wish all teachers could be like him...He ignites the love of learning.
When I heard him say the sheet of paper was 20cm across I knew something was up.
The idea of questioning our assumptions is also central to philosophy, which loves this stuff
We must know, we will know\n\n\n\n\nAnd then remember vaguely
Cliff is out there living my dream life
I guess you could call that a Parker Ruler.\nMostly correct but not quite right.
4:13 \n-Is that natural ?\n-Who knows ? (Like je doesn't care) I've got to know things!\n\nWell I think you believe you do but obviously not about everything....\n
I guess this is what Rick would be like if he was sane... and real
This is the exact type of homework problem that would have really pissed me off when I was in the eighth grade.
Can you guys do a video on maths that NEED and I mean literally NEED, like cannot physically be done, without a calculator? Because I know most math can be done without one, with just our knowledge of long multiplication and long division.
At 2:20, is that a Klein bottle in the Pacifit ocean? Or a Moebius strip?
We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
This will be me when I‚Äôm older
why learn if you can't remember
it seems like the odd shape of the paper would be obvious, unless the students had to clear their desks or something. because once you got that paper near a normal rectangle piece of paper, I think you would see that
If numberphile was exclusively Cliff videos, I'd still be a huge fan.
I just love how happy he is with his math. It reminds me of when I was a kid watching math programs. I clicked on this because I had to measure a part of my room using a sheet of paper. I didn't have standard measuring tools. What I did have was paper with it's size known. I taped sheets to the wall until the space left was smaller than the sheet of paper. Then I folded it in half repeatedly to get smaller units. It worked out well. The furniture sits perfectly in the space.
Hilbert... space? Richard Feynman was the same way. RIP you two. I wish I could have met you.
So how in the world do I find a measuring tool I can trust?
Is that a mobius strip on his globe?
soooo cool..where can i get this ruler?!
We could take it further. What's the thickness of the paper? What's the total surface area?
Cliff! Have you found¬†The Cuckoo‚Äôs Egg?
is ... is that a Parker Ruler?
So animated and interesting :o
U tricked me I was hoping how to measure my pee pee to make it bigger please help asap!
I would cut the piece of paper into 2 triangles, make sure the angle is 90 degrees, if not adjust for it. Sum the 2 triangle areas, and you have more accuracy. To see whether or not you have 2 right angles, place them against each other, it should make a straight line. This goes for wall brackets especially , tip, before you buy wall brackets, make sure they are 90 degrees. Some wall brackets have imperfections,  I've learned the hard way. Place the brackets aginst each other on a level surface, lets you know they are properly made or not, you'd be surprised.
I freaking love this guy.  I'm 36 and I wish I could sit in his science class.. like right now.
This is borderline evil, and I love it
Man I just saw the numberphile video and clicked,1 had no idea I was going to get a cliff video.
also need to calculate the inner area of the circles based on the thickness of paper :D
damn this guy is sneaky giving them  a fake ruler. lesson: never trust anyone, never trust anything, always doubt your world?
Worse yet it the paper is not a perfectly flat 2d surface.  So you have to find the average exposed area of all the fibers.
Cliff reminds me of Doc from Back to the Future so much, I love it
Ins't this guy just the best alternate reality version of Rick Sanches Rick Sanchez (C-137)? I'm glad to be living on this reality haha
epic troll. didn't even tell ya the answer. mic dropped.
We might know, then somebody throws a monkey wrench and we don't know anything.
I love this guy
I love this guy! Can he be my cool grand-uncle or something? I just want to be like him.
I have never seen Cliff's handwriting before, it looks awesome.
Teachers should learn from this man. It would make the education system actually worthwhile.
There are only 8 marks between 17 and 17. XD
How to know it all without being a know-it-all?
Bruh Why is doc from back to the future trending?
Can you be my teacher
What is the best way to meet Cliff Stoll?
I have a math problem I do not know how to solve., there is a picture I have from Star Trek¬†5 where there are these walls with holes in them, I assume¬†to be 6 feet wide. Each wall is directly behind the next. Because of prospective they are each smaller. The question is how do I find¬† from this image how far away each wall is from each other.
A lot of my friends have issues with writing essays.  Their biggest concerns are length and structure.  Some of them are too wordy, some of them get right to the point, either way, they miss the word target by a fair margin.  The wordy ones can't make a concise point, the direct ones usually fail to explain their premises.  I frequently pull scores over 80, and into the 90s, and my uni is pretty brutal with the marking.  A 60-70 here means you've done well, but didn't go above and beyond.  You can write a perfect, but uninteresting essay and score up to a 70, to get beyond that, you have to show originality and novelty.  Anyway, given my scores, my friends frequently ask me for advice on how to get their scores up.  I say one thing makes for better essay writing, and that is practice.  Write long posts on Facebook, write long comments.  Eventually, the structure you'll need to follow will come naturally.  You'll be posting a thesis, followed by a bit of background information, some facts that support your position, and a logical extension of those facts into your conclusion.  It's that simple.  Write like you're surrounded by idiots.  Explain every jargon term you use, to make sure the reader knows you understand it, and is on precisely the same page.  In a philosophy essay, for example, it's not enough to say Camus was an existentialist, you have to expound and say what some features of existentialist philosophy are.  In a post about how Rick and Morty is nihilist, you explain what nihilism is, and what features of nihilism Rick and Morty displays.  At some point, you'll realise you can churn out a two thousand word essay on any topic, in one sitting.
Why can't I thumbs this vid up over and over and over again?
If he was my math teacher, I would actually like the subjectüò´
My entire life I have always been told to trust my equipment, be it measurements, frequency, ETC. Then you go and give these kids a bad ruler!
An integral to calculate the area of a quadrilateral? Just divide it into two triangles and the area of the quadrilateral is 1/2 base times perpendicular height. The mathematical ability of these otherwise great physics teachers unfortunately leave something to be desired.
I close my eyes, I hear Tom Hanks!
This guy is like Bill Nye mashed up with Ed Wynn
For some reason i thought this was vox because their thumbnails look similar
But does it have Klein bottles?
Man what a poor title job. What a great video. This is GOLD!
Love this guy hes so hyped about learning! Wish he was my teacher...
Who on EARTH would dislike these videos? It irks me.
I wish many people questioned their assumptions about many things.
This was so different from the other videos with Cliff, but I loved it. Great lesson.
If Cliff was my teacher in grade 8 I feel like I would have been a LOT more interested in maths and science.
Somehow, I'm convinced he's actually managed to find out the secrets of the universe. What's the meaning of life? Klein Bottles. How do we stop wars from plaguing earth? Klein Bottles. How do we solve the unsolvable equations? Klein bottles, my friends. He's on to something.
I think Cliff and Destin need to meet. Both of them have an infectious thirst for understanding and are great at making knowledge fun and accessible. I think it would be great!
How awesome must it have been to be his student
Cliff is such a legend
Seems like silly prank. Maybe I missed something %(
As soon as he said calculate the area, I thought of the holes
This guy is the best kind of crazy.
Hey dac, we're going back to the future
Why can't this guy be my grandpa. He'd be awesome at family gatherings.
I cannot, I will not ever have enough of Cliff Stoll.
Cliff is the best
This is so awesome!!!
Great video!
(:
Amazing.
More Cliff videos!
That was great
This amazing
epic troll. much respect. very wow
Lol
This is inspirational
Theophilis? or the awful-est?
1 Cliff video = 1 like
Kind of adorable?
i love cliff
Dude, where is the DeLorean ?
Great lesson.
Fantastic video, fantastic teacher

i love you so much. thank you for being my sunshine for almost a decade. i don't know what i'd do without you. thank you for everything.
There are few people I love more then Demi
wow. who gives a royal shit?
This girl gives chillsüíØ she helped me with some of my depression #proud
Please put spanish subtitles in the video
That last line was great\nDemi: Yeah\n*Big Pause*\nDemi: I mean, thank you üòÇüòÇ
You people are all victims of mass hypnosis
Oh my girl ,you are the best üíïüíï
How do you always know what I need. Ipray one day I can meet you and truly explain what I mean by that... Spirituality is a weirdddd thing. Thank you Demi, I need this.. Namaste <3 ((Do you believe in living angels?...))
she was a little kid and given everything a little girl wants all at once. that can't be good for a child's mental health
Pfft.\nShe's no Judy Collins or Barbra Streisand.
I'm so fuckin happy that this is happening and I can't wait to watch it because I know that This will be absolutely amazing because everything my demi is always fuckin amazing g
I CAN‚ÄôT WAIT TO SEE THIIIIS
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
You look like my ex
I LOVE U!!ur life is like me im a girl and just like u if i feel sexy i become a beast
God long to be single God I'd love to show her what love is such an amazing woman
It's things like this, that make me glad she is one of my idols ‚ù§
you know she's gonna do a documentary and all its great, but now she gonna have to wear makeup all the time hto
I love you so much DEMI:) You are such an inspiration for me. I don't know where I would be if it weren't for you. I have been waiting for you to make a movie/ series about yourself for years. I so happy you decide to open up.
So proud of you. Big time. \nps: this seems better than Five Foot Two. Just saying.
Omg I can‚Äôt wait for this
She's a strong woman and a good model to the youth üíûüíû that's why I idolized and love her so much üòòüòò
I'm so ready. I'm already crying.
I can't wait! I love you SO MUCH! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
omg I'm so excited for this üò≠
I hope you don't have to pay for it. Why couldn't it be on Netflix like Gaya's documentary.
copying the kim k hair fucking get your own ideas unoriginal cunt
Demi was on like a road...to suicide\n*gasps* No!? Really!? What gave it away? üòè
Okay, so, somebody needs to explain this to me. It's illegal to do drugs, right? It's illegal to be in possession of drugs, right? In order to be a drug addict, you must use drugs, and to use drugs, you must be in possession of them, right? So, why do we reward drug addicts with a 4 star rehabilitation resort and let them continue on with thier lives? Saying your a drug addict is like saying you murdered somebody, or you robbed a bank. It's a crime, it happened past tense, no one saw you commit the crime, there is no evidence, that doesn't mean it didn't happen. And 100 percent of the time, going into rehab, people can fail a drug test. So why is there no legal punishment for this? Why are they not getting sober in prison? Why do you get 25 years for just being in possession of a brick of coke but admitting to possessing and using drugs gets you...nothing. I love demi, but she should have been in prison. I beleive in all or nothing, either drugs are illegal, or they arent. There is no in between. An addict can't give you a sob story and get away with a major crime. Either it's okay for them and everyone else to use drugs, or its not. This is why it's such a problem. We're teaching our kids they can do drugs, and when they're done, they just go to rehab and get thier life back with zero consequences. Am I missing something? Can somebody please point out where I went wrong with my logic?
Demi, the last 4 years of my life have been hell and your journey has produced such inspirational music for me. Thank you.
she is such an inspiration i cant wait to watch this :)
can she adopt me or what ???
idk I just can't seem to get into any of the music she puts out. also, I don't know anyone but me that has YouTube red .... and I only have it because of Google play music.
You ROCK!!!!!! Luv you and thank you for being you!!!! üíïüíúüíïüî•üî•
I expected so much more from her new album tbh. Hopefully this documentary makes up for it
üò≠ i love her so much i just can‚Äôt honestly
I need to see this
I REALLY HOPE ITS NOT YOUTUBE RED
#simplynoonecares not human that says it all. Sold your soul don't feel for ya.
I liker her as a person, but shes overrated as a vocalist. So shouty.
IM SO PROUD OF YOU FOR DOING THIS. YOU ARE INSPIRITING AND YOU NEVER FAIL TO IMPRESS ME BABYGIRL. IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS AND FOR THIS NEW ERA.
Who Cares This Girl isn't that Talented and seems like Trendy PC Liberal. I Have No Respect for her Mental Capabilities and that makes the Mediocre Music much harder to ignore. Another Bozo that is Only Famous b/c she is Branded for her Looks and fitting that Pop Niche Appealing To Impressionable Morons.  Im only gonna drop this comment because Dumb YouTube recommended. I push stop recommending me this TRASH and it don't listen. Typical BS from YouTube pushing this trash over content with real value.
~Demi/to whom it may concern,everything is going to be okay,things are changing now,you will soon feel enlightened,just stay true to yourself,light and love will always conquer the darkness and lead to a brighter future~
I'm so fucking proud of Demi I love you so fucking much your my role model words can't describe (like if you agree)
Demy....you are fat and obviously a cocaine whore. Go relapse hoe
oh god she's cried...i'm so proud of u
Demi. No one really gives a shit. You did some drugs, you were rich and famous. Boo hoo. This story is a thousand years old. You want to make difference? Help the poor with education. Otherwise this film, documentary is another Katie Perry Flop. \n\n#truth
She thinks the world revolves around her....
love you Demi :) I look up to you because I've been bullied like Demi was and still get bullied online and also at 19 was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1. I am alive because of your music Demi and your quotes and speeches.
But is she sunny with a chance???
OMG!! i can't wait for this... i promise that i will watch it in any way possible.
Omg I love her smile so much!!!
Who has time to watch shit like this?
I cannot wait to watch this
Just a question. Is this going to be a movie on YouTube Red or a series of episodes?
will this be on youtube red? or just regular youtube? someone tell me will it be free or will i have to pay?
I freaking love Demi! Such a pure soul! Something about her makes me smile she is so honest amazingüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Stupid, proud to be a slut

if I could pick the last video I ever got to watch... this, this right here
A walking and talking Corpse.
lmao youtube is so fucking rigged... this channel has nearly a million people subscribed, and gets #25 on the trending page but can only get 30k views... that's like less than 5% of their entire subs even caring to watch this video which has been nearly half a day old... and gets advertisement on  trend while a ricegum video gets 100k+ within the first hour
the entire mv could have been like this and i would have loved just as much my bbs
30k view ad on trending, that's it uninstalling YouTube app and you can go fuck yourselves
It‚Äôs good... but it ain‚Äôt a Fake Happy video...
I LOVE THE THREE OF THEM TOGETHER ITS AMAZING
This is the cutest thing
best band ever thx thx my old friend and ignorance is your new best friend ;)

Oh look!! A generic thumbnail with two gaping dicksuckers and some Pepe Le Pew homo skulking over a shoulder ... great

So sexy! So handsome!
Hello, tonight I'd like to test some of our favorite and as well as some new sounds that can be triggering for you while testing my new mic set. I do need to work on some settings and get pop-filters still but overall I think these are pretty good :D What do you think? \n0-02:10 - intro and voice test\n02:19 - rolling crinkles sound\n05:55 - comb in the plastic ‚ô• \n09:47 - brushing of the mics\n13:27 - purple beads waterfall\n15:53 - crinkly sticky sounds\n17:47 - bumpy clicky sounds\n18:30 - shell beads high pitch clicky sounds ‚ô• \n19:41 - fast tapping on a smooth foam sheet ^_^ mmmm\n20:41 - light slime squishing and tapping \n21:36 - whisper test and goodbyes :) \nThank you, I hope you enjoyed it! ‚ô•
I know I should be commenting on the spectacular video you shot but I can't get over your top!! I neeeed to know where you got it from?! üòçüòç
Maria I love your choker and your hair in this video! So trendy and cute!
Loving the outfit. The ribbon, choker, and laced top go really well together
Uhhhh 3.....3 HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MICROPHONE......but still better and cheaper than a 3Dio hmmmmm interesting
one of the best video that I've ever heard <3
Help is this stuff supposed to give very mild erections
I didn't know Amy Adams was doing asmr videos now!
i‚Äôve been very sick for the past few days and this helps so much, i love ur whispers
I usually either don't watch full asmr videos or I'll skip through certain parts when I get bored but Maria has a way of making every item and every second magical
You should take up modeling, Maria.
Angela from The Office?
Love the new mics!!!!!!
*fails math test* at least my neck smells nice
noticed the overlapping of the editing. Very nice try!! I can see how much effort you put in your video and how you want to be creative. Really appreciate it!
When you brush mic, I don't know why but I felt like you're a teacher -for little kids absoulately- and you try to teach an enjoyable studying tip
Like I'm not busy?
A lot of people have celebrity crushes... \nI have asmr crushes and Maria is the number 1 on my list üòçüòç jeez she‚Äôs so damn beautiful
I can't be the only one who's curious what inside the smile bag is making that incredible sound???
You look so beautiful on this vid.
I wish I had discovered ASMR in college üò≠ I'm so mad at myself üòí All those stressful nights...
Looove the slime tapping,and I never listen to tapping sounds
Did anyone else notice the awesome hair look at 20:16?!?! HOT! Your hair looks amazing now, but that short hair looks so good on you!
I love you. I seriously love you.
She repeats test over and over in my head and I'm like internal crying cuz of all the tests I have
Great, and now I cant watch any other ASMRtists, these mics are so flawless every other video just sounds awful.T_T :D Just kidding, but the audio and video quality of your videos is out of this world now.<3 I seriously don't understand how can ASMR Darling have more subscribers, I mean yeah, it's not bad, but the content quality cant even try to compare. Plus you're a completely transcendental, loving, charming and calming being, that's something every other ASMRtist is lacking. You're the best!:) <3
You look like Amy Adams in the thumbnail.
The Queen of ASMR, the Czarina of Tinglation, the Empress of Whispers, the Duchess of Calm, She who reigns from Cali. We salute you.
This is probably the best ASMR mic setup I've ever heard!
This is too good to be true... indeed.. indeedüòÅüòÅ
You look positively radiant in this video and ur outfit is beautiful üòóüòóüòó
I'm not the type to comment but this was crazy good
I'm glad she seems very into it, helps me relax more. I respond better to unintentional but this one is good sometimes.
This is the first time I believed in love at first sight. :o
My favorite triggers were the comb in plastic and the makeup brushing on the microphones! Tingles all over
I love this video the mics are on point 110%. Please make more videos with these amazing microphones.
I've been following you for a very long time now, I'm so happy and proud you're getting the recognition you deserve! Happy 1 million <3
Love Sennheiser! I have been buying their studio headphones for the past 12 years now. Great company!
These microphones really really show off your talents. Keep them please!
This is by far my favorite audio setup in an asmr video. Great quality!
maria your hair looks so beautiful i love the way it was worn this video!!üíú
5:55 gave me tingles...first time in months!
How is this possible? Gorgeous, and great at ASMR? Subscribed.
I love the new mics, they makes everything sound so soothing, and I like the front and back design in it. I really hope you do a personal attention video, using at least one of these mics. I would enjoy it alot.
Am I the only one who doesnt hear it behind the ear?
Please do an unboxing when you get your Gold youtube play button !!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
You are so beautiful! I love your videos :)
I'm gonna make it through the whole asmr video *falls asleep*\n 5 minutes into the the vid
Loved the last smelling your neck part!
My prayer have been answered \n\n\nBy the comb gods üíûüòÇ
I am IN LOVE with that shirt!!
The face brushing is my favorite
Your outfit is just goals üòçüòçüòç love your video yet again ‚ù§
Love layered whispering at end! Would love more of it üòç
Masha, where'd you get that fabulous sweater? Love love love it, and you! Another great vid. ‚ù§Ô∏è
The new mic's are really great.  I enjoy your videos so much.  Thank you for making them.
I love how Maria always looks so adorable and sleepy whenever she uses the comb in the plastic bag
the beads- strings of pearls are AMAZING!
Your one of the few people that makes me actually enjoy living. Thank you
I've been hoping for more videos like this, simple sounds like your older ones.
Love these new mics! Intense sounds that come from behind my ears give me the best tingles, and this was lovely üòç I also love the comb in plastic
There is no amount of nice words to describe how delicate and beautiful Maria is. Her whispers, her soft speaking, slow gentle hand movements, and genuine care. Thank you for this video Maria! Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è Hannah
OMG I lost my tingles for over a year and you brought them back with this video üò≠üò≠ thank you!!! Ily üíó.
I think comb in plastic needs his own video.
please do a full video of the comb in plastic, it is the most amazing sound <3
Unanticipated* you are too cute, Maria! Thank you for your hard work!
We have something in common we both got ne things but instead of mics i got the nintendo switch. ps. I know
6:03 \n\nWhen you come into work early as hell and you clock in\n\nThen you put a good 8 hours in to work like never before\n\n*BUT* then you look at the clock and it's only been 30 minutes \n\nEdit; Hi
There's a tonne of great ASMRtists out there, very creative and putting great effort into their craft but what I like about Maria is that she just seems to have it in her DNA. Don't get me wrong, I know she works hard to make these videos for us but some people just have the gift and this woman just makes it look effortless. I don't often comment, but I feel compelled to thank you for body of work that I owe many a pleasant sleep and de-stressed evening to.
How are you so beautiful??!?!
Yup. Officially the best mics you‚Äôve ever used.  Brilliant vid.
Watching for the third time in three days trying to get past 10 minutes or so. I feel failure coming on again.
Did u say gay form 0:34
A full video of just those whispers in the beginning would be so perfect! Helps me fall asleep every time!
You gave me finger tingles??? I‚Äôve never had that???? Kinda scared
Thank god you don't put mid-rolls into your videos. Thanks.
Do a hand sounds video my queen üôÇüôåüèº
YAY A TRIGGER VIDEOIIII

Awesome mics! üòÑ

Black people are so fucking gay now man
HOW YOU DOIN'? Sharing is caring (and good for your mental health...let me know and talk to each other and be nice to each other and give virtual hugs down here plz) <3
Isn't H as in H&M supposed to be pronounced aitch not haitch? Just wondering. English is not my native language.
I feel you Melanie! Periods and PMS do affect me a lot even though I try to be strong and focused but it just does affect me every month. I'm learning. \nLove your channel üòÄ
Red wine hot chocolate? YES Miss Melanie please!! Awesome video Mel, helps so much just to sit down and relax to here you talk
Don't worry Melanie, that happens a lot after finishing projects,  you feel sad and confused,  but what you need to do is  go out, visit things and  go to places,  find  inspiration, and soon you will feel fantastic again,  and  you will find something to manifest your creativity too, remember we love you, and  we are  here for you!
Honestly, I'm not doing okay.\nI picked my major back in high school, got a degree, and then got two jobs because that's what I was supposed to do.\nI'm tired of doing what I'm supposed to do.\nI loathe my major, and it makes me depressed working on it.\nI started my YT channel because that's my true passion, and it's helping.\nIf anyone could send me good vibes, I'd love that :)\nTo anyone reading, hang in there if you're feeling down today <3
I'm a slave for my hormones... i need to have an oral contraception, i'm a mess without that, physically and psycho. With the pils, i just have anxiety and migraines few days before my pms get out. I know it, so i can deal with it. \nI understand what you said about not knowing what to do. When my calendar is empty for few days, i feel empty. When i see an entirely month empty, it's the worst. I need to have mini goals through the year. It's ok to have some days with nothing to do. Nothing like oblivion. But we, humans, need these moments to find peace, enjoy the quiet... go shopping, watch tv, clean house. Just relax. \nAnd the calendar will be filled day after day. Plan some vacations for december, plan a birthday, a tattoo, a lunch with family... little things. Let the life guide you , like an otter on a river. ;)
Hand over that hot wine chocolate recipe! Love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
So how do you make this red wine hot chocolate? ü§îüç´üç∑
I cry every single time i watch Marley and Me and i have a yellow labrador who's 9 now :(((
I love these videos Melanie üíö seeing that your not happy and perfectly wonderful 100% of the time makes the rest of us feel more normal (what ever that is) love your videos, keep being you üíöüòòüíö
tysm for this, mel. i've been feeling pretty down recently myself but your videos make me feel hopeful :) i hope you find that same positivity! much love x
I have generalized anxiety disorder. I've been doing quite well with therapy. However, last month I was PMSing and I couldn't even go to sleep because I kept overthinking everything. As soon as I got my period it went away. Hormones fucking suck
You're definitely not alone on this! I suffer from really bad PMDD which i'm sure you've heard of but its just a more severe form of PMS and it consumes my whole life for like 4 days out of every month, gets pretty bad in terms of depression and overthinking and I can't get anything done, can't focus on anything, it affects my work life and my relationships and its just awful so i know EXACTLY how you feel. My only advice i can give you is to just let it happen, know that its only situational and just do small things that make you happy to try and get through it to the other side! You're a very strong woman so I know you can handle this!
Melanie, I'm happy you shared a video with us  even though you weren't 100% feelin it. I think it's incredibly noble to be vulnerable on camera and I just love your content! It's good to let yourself feel.
I feel you sooo much. Recently, I feel like the PMS, Menstruation and recovery phases take up about 75-85 percent of my time. I have become extremely withdrawn. More so since I don't have any Projects going on right now.
I'm watching  Laurel and Hardy to feel better, it helps, perhaps you should watch them aswel :-) nice video thnx for making it.
Your videos are so calming and cozy‚ù§ +long or short hair you look beautiful anywayüòÅ
Random, but I really love how you edit your videos!! Every time you do that thing where the audio keeps talking but you visually show your pauses it makes me so happy because it's so well done:D
I've always struggled with my periods, they've always been ridiculously heavy and leave me feeling really drained and I usually feel really sad in the lead up and throughout and it's annoying as some of my friends will have really light three day long periods, and their moods don't change and they can't understand why I'm so effected! I've been on pills to reduce the bleeding and always refused the actual Pill as I don't want hormones in my body but now I've been made to go on it as they think I have endometriosis, I'm really scared as I know how much my periods effect me, I don't want the pill to effect me loads too üò¢
I feel ya, girl. Every fucking month, 1 week before my period starts, I get extra emotional. I cry watching The Voice, I cry thinking I procrastinate a lot and I'm not doing anything with my life, it's awful.. I honestly am tired to have this every month :(
My boyfriend is very understanding when it comes to periods but he still doesn't understand the full effect
I feel you sister! I was always a very busy person, worked a lot, had uni and other projects I was working on, etc. Since having my little girl I am limited in how much I can work and have not yet returned to uni. I am fully aware that having a little girly is so fulfilling and she does indeed take up so much of my time but I often get really down about the fact that I always had a goal I was working towards and was always so busy and now I find myself feeling as though I am no longer working towards anything. I am simultaneously the happiest I‚Äôve ever been and the most lost. I find setting myself little projects helps, I crochet and cross stitch etc. But I completely understand where you are coming from here, and it‚Äôs nice to hear I‚Äôm not the only person who doesn‚Äôt really enjoy not having a lot to do! \nYou‚Äôll find your content self again lovely lady, don‚Äôt let the bad days overshadow the good. Lots of love from my house to yours! üòò
Red wine and hot chocolate damn that sounds nice I used to drink coffee and cider my London friends didn't like it but I did must be the welsh in me
Love your honesty, love how you edited the video!\nSo awesome that you did this for world mental health day! You are so amazing Mel :) all the best
I totally understand how you're feeling. I'm in a place at the moment where i just cannot motivate myself to do anything and im feeling a bit empty and aimless because i have no goals to work towards and all i want is comfort and cuddles. My period is coming up too so it is probably hormone induced for me too but its bloody annoying... you're not alone ‚ù§
OMG I have watched marley and me in cinema. I think that was year 2009 and i remember i've cried  a lot. I thought that me and my boyfriend are going to watch a fun comedy to laugh a bit  but no. What was even worst ,about 2 months earlier my parents had to put to sleep my dog that we had for 16 year. Damn You marley and me!
You are such an inspiration, you're doing more good than you think, Mel. When you're stressed or anxious or sad or angry, just think that it'll all pass with time. You know what to do, it's just getting around to it is the hurdle. BUT you did this video and that's amazing. I've been majorly struggling with balancing my PMS moods, general moods and little anxiety things like not letting shit get to me so easily. We're all trying and when we know what works for us, we keep going and we're NEVER alone. :)\n\nAlso, RED WINE HOT CHOCOLATE!? HELL YES!? We need to sit down for one of these some day.
Girl I feel you, I have the worst PMS. Physically but especially mentally. Kinda hate it but luckily other than that I am very healthy right now. Which I am grateful for! But those couple of days are tough sometimes!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE share the recipe for red wine hot chocolate!! That just sounds incredible. The copper mug is beautiful.\nI just realised that yesterday was world mental health awareness day and I was diagnosed with chronic depression yesterday. The irony....
The background of this video is so pretty üíõüíõ
I have been lucky not to have any mental health issue  ,however i had a family member and a friend ,whom suffered with  mental illnesses. I have immense empathy for  people ,who are dealing with mental health issues  ,you are all brave living your lives ,even though you feel like rolling up in a ball and not moving .
It's so strange, I feel exactly the same. I can't actually tell you what is wrong but I'm feeling very heavy (the best word to describe it). So today i didn't even go to uni. I stayed in bed and I'm taking the morning off. It's my mental health day and I'm trying to focus on myself now. I want to work through this and get better. (Plus yes, im also about to get my period and my  skin looks horrendous and it felling effects me). Hope you're having a good day today :) love you!
I just wanted to say how happy I am that your a YouTube. Your funny, relatable, truthful, smart, fashionable and more! Honestly, and I never think this about anyone..but goalsüòÑ I hope you stay on yt foreverüíö
Mel we all lose our keys and find them in our pocket! Since I left uni I really struggle with fulfilment but I'm going to do some volunteering to fill that gap
Melanie, \nThank you for the abundance of joys and happiness that your delightful sharings bring. Your thoughts and warmth are always a present to your YouTube friends. I wish I could wrap you in the largest of hugs when you need them most. \nBe confident that you bring something special to those in your real and virtual worlds. \nThank you for sharing.
Love the way you edited this video at the start showing how you were scatter-brained, but at the same time still had you talking!
i bloody  love how the red has faded  in  your hair to ginger like...  i always wanted to  go  that red but i also  wanted to go that ginger so it's  like best of both world and it grows out nicely  too
Generally the week before my period starts I get so so sad and down for at least a full week and it ruins everything because I have no motivation and I get so easily stressed and overwhelmed with everything. It sucks
You do seem a little off, tlking faster than normal. Hope you feel better soon  :)
Love you, and proud of you for posting this video even tho you weren't feeling yourself (still loved it, just always feels like chatting with a friend). üíö
very random and off topic...but gosh you're gorgeous!!
Ive had a good week ,I did 1500 steps in aid for mental health for my school and we raised a flag for awareness
I feel exactly the same right now !! Kinda deflated I think .. anything will put me in a mood eeesshh! Pms is the worst :(
YES for talking about being so weird and scatterbrained during certain times of the cycle. Happens to me too, at least zwo times during one cycle. I recently found cbd oil drops, they seem to help my anxiety. Best from Germany <3
I feel like you're the sister I never had. I relate to you so much with everything you say and we look weirdly similar ?? (My mum's Irish so that might explain it) but I love your videos, you're the cutest!!
Is the Garnier hair mask available in the US? I found it on the UK Amazon site, but I can't find it on any US site.
Out of all my friends, I am the one who suffers from serious symptoms of PMS. I've been diagnosed with PMDD and do have meds for it but I try not to take it unless i REALLY need to. I just turned 29 and I realized that my PMS was really bad in my mid 20s - 23-28 were my worst years. I also have crazy anxiety but that hasn't been diagnosed by a doctor, I just know it gets alot worse during my PMS.  I feel like I have the same issue as you - when there isn't something i am working on, I am extremely scattered brained. I just started journaling this week. Hate to admit - I've only done it once this week but I do want to stay committed. I feel like that is an emotional release for me on paper.  I also realized reading also helps with my PMS. I sorta just shut myself out from the world and dig into a book and that REALLY helps.
Hun, I'm sorry it's not a good spell right now. Just remember another one of those wonderful life affirming days will be just around the corner. \nSending a hug :) \n\nAlso, the words: red wine hot chocolate in conjunction with one another are perfection. PLEASE make a tutorial! X
I hate Marley and Me it's so depressing üò°
I've been sick in bed all day :/ but I'm feeling a lot better I've been bingeing your food diary Fridays and videos in general ‚ù§Ô∏è I saw a clip of you vlogging from the Scotch Hall bridge and had a spit take moment because I live there ( drogheda,, not under the bridge üòÅ )
thank you for this video . the past two days i've been shit like zone out or something.  and I've so much assignments to do . üò£üñí are you doing vlogmas?
Yes! i have PMDD and it sucks
Oh Melüíö It breaks my heart to see you down, I sincerely hope you're feeling back to normal again soon. I'm proud of you for still filming despite your struggles, and even sharing them with us so we know we're not alone. And neither are you:) Much loveüíöüíöüíö
I need that red wine hot chocolate receipt <3 and thank you for mentioning briefly that all the girls PMS and menstruation doesn't affect so much, I'm one of them usually when it comes to periods and I feel like it is criminal to talk about having easy periods when so many struggle with them. I also would like to hear more this kind of honest conversation around all the hormonal stuff .
Have you heard of anhedonia? It's a condition where one is unable to feel pleasure in things they would typically enjoy. It's a common symptom of depression but there's no reason why it shouldn't exist without full-blown major depressive disorder or whatever. I also associate it with a lack of motivation etc which is why what you said reminded me and I thought I'd mention it just in case there was the smallest chance it could be useful. Sending all the love xx
Hi Melanie, I totally feel you. I feel like a different person the week or two before my period. I question life decisions, friendships and my own self-worth. I'm slowly learning to work through those feelings, but it's always hard.
It's so amazing that you talk about everything with huge honesty. I know our situation is so different, but I think I had the same issue that you have now in the summer. I accomplished a big goal of mine and after that I just didn't know what to do with myself. I'm a creative person and then somehow I lost all my creativity and motivation. I just wrote it down cause I'm so happy that I've heard someone else talk about it. I felt like nobody understood what I was going throught. I hope you'll feel better soon Mel, you're just an amazing human being<3
thx mel i really appreciate you openly talking about how you are feeling. I am hating school at the moment I just want to cry when I go but it makes me feel better that feeling anxious and sad is ok and I can work through it, love you mel xxx
I NEED your chocolate üôèüèªred wine recipe!!!!
Thank you so much for this video, Mel! I had THE worst day and hearing that I'm not the only one feeling like  this helped me soooo much.
i feel you! i usually get into a slump, where all i want to do is sit and  binge watch, but tthen i get anxious about the fact that i'm wwasting time when i could be doing something else, which adds to feeling down and it just feels like i'm digging myself a hole. but it always passes, i hope you'll feel a lot better!
Today I'm actually in a really nice mood. World Mental Health day kind of highlighted how far I've come since last year and while progress can seem slow it is happening, it has put me in a hopeful mood.
I personally have been lucky enough to regulate my hormones with the Pill. I've taken it since I was 14 (I had/have very bad acne), but I'm going off on it at the start of next year which is scaring me horrendeously. I'm undergoing a new treatment for my acne that will make the Pill pretty much unnecessary (in regards to my skin, obviously) and I'm terrified of not having the effects the Pill had for me in regards to my PMS and my period. The few times I went off the Pill in the past or wasn't on it when I was 12/13 I was in horrific pain and couldn't even get out of bed on some occassions. I'm really afraid to see what will happen next year. On the other hand, I've been dying to not have to rely on the Pill for so so long. I'm almost 27 now and I just don't want to have to spend money on it if I don't have to.
I absolutely know how you feel. During pms sure it gets worse but I do struggle with both anxiety and depression  as well. It's hard not to compare yourself  but with depression it's even harder to get out of that head space to be happy and healthy and carefree when your wallowing in misery
What liquid eyeliner do you use? That lipstick suits you so much!
I get really down round my period and start questioning my life decisions too! And crying over really minimal things and wondering if this is what I should be doing with my life etc. Completely okay! xxx
Aw Mel, even on your down days you make me smile. Thank you for doing what you do for us <3 p.s: I would love to see the red wine hot chocolate recipe!
I relate to this so much. I always need to have a target and a goal to obtain otherwise I get lost and unfocused and overthink. So now I make lists whenever I feel like I need it to motivate me and I make things for myself to do so I‚Äôm focused.
I get this, it's a lack of focus and a lack of purpose. When I'm not doing something I start to wonder why I'm here and I start thinking about all the bad things, but it's not all bad and in reality you'll have dips  because you can't constantly be doing something or you'll burn yourself out!
red wine hot chocolate?! pretty sure i NEED that in my life üòÇ
be careful with the crest strips, don't use them all the time, take breaks. When  I was in america for three months I used the crest 3d white toothpaste (not even the strips) but the toothpaste has hydrogen peroxide in it and for the first two months I felt fine. I now suffer consistently with really bad sensitivity in my eye tooth and nothing makes it go away!
My drama lecturer said a very interesting and important thing about ''fun'', which is as she says a space of freedom of all kinds. And what we might call fun might be actually a social obligation, kind of a social construct that we have formed over the years. But in reality not many people have fun in a way of doing things on our own, rebelling... and what you've said about being anxious while not having an important 'project' on your mind, not being occupated at the moment is actually a kind of social construct, because you are sorrounded by all those always busy people who have no regular life, just projects and ''big ideas''. I think it's ok, to be ''stagnant'' for a bit, and maybe give some time for yourself.
do you think you have pmdd? I get pms, I experience it too but I hate the think its reason for people to think less of women. I know that's not what you mean Mel but sometimes its the vibe you give without of clarification. I hope you feel better!!
Oh babe! So sorry you're through this! Sending you lots of love and hugs ü§ó
even when you're feeling shite, you're lovely xxx
Youre such an inspiration. The fact that you pushed yourself and made this on a bad day makes it so much more meaningful. You're so honest and open in a beautiful way. Thanks for sharing. \nMe personally I'm just feeling so stressed and alone. I'm in 12th grade and it's college application season - there's so much to do and I can't get it done and I feel so incompetent. I'm also feeling a very strong sense of running out of time. High school is almost over, I'm almost leaving this place that finally made me so happy. There's so much I haven't done. I'm not ready to leave these people, this place. I feel like I'll never find another place that makes me happy. My friends now aren't close, but I wish they were. There are people here that I genuinely love, but we never got close and I feel like I'm gonna lose them, and I'll never find anyone like them again. Plus, my younger sister just got a boyfriend and is really happy, and it's just making me so jealous. I've never had a boyfriend or a kiss or anything and I should feel happy for her but I just feel so alone. \nIt's a lot. And it's hard because the one person I used to be able to talk to is spending the year across the world.
Really respect you for not click baiting this.
Hey, just wanted to share something that has helped me a lot. We're not often taught this, and actually we're usually taught the complete opposite.. but i think its valuable for anyone to hear this if it might help them. stop suppressing your feelings. it can be so easy not to realize that this is actually what you are doing that is making you stressed and anxious. our feelings/emotions are meant to guide us through life, and yet all our lives people invalidate us for the way that we feel. society doesnt understand the value of emotions yet. But if you suppress or deny them, or dont want to feel them, then they are going to start simmering until they explode into chronic anxiety or depression. I lived like that for over 10 years and never realized that it was because i was refusing to feel my emotions. But when I realized it, its seriously started to change my life completely. i feel more self esteem when i stand by how i truly feel, and im more confident and secure in my self, because i know that i wont abandon how i truly feel just to cater to others. plus my anxiety, which was caused by emotional suppression, is gone. please consider if this is your situation too. i hope other people have the chance at freedom like I now do.
Thank you so much for being so open and honest, I just finished Fully Functioning Human and it made me feel like I wasn't alone and I am so grateful for everything you do! \nI've been in and out of therapy for the last two years and it has been really difficult to find someone who really understands how I'm feeling about certain things. I've struggled with anxiety, depression, dysmorphia and disassociation A LOT over the last 2 years while also trying to get through uni. I'm nearly finished my second year now and I have learned so much but sometimes I just don't think that my voice counts (I'm studying at film school with insanely beautiful and talented people everywhere) and it really gets me down. I've struggle especially with dysmorphia, so much so that I started to not talk to my friends because they didn't understand how I was feeling. I felt really alone and it was through your videos that I found that I wasn't! So thank you so much! I've really looked to a lot of YouTubers who talk about their mental health online, they are so brave and it's just amazing to see people breaking down all the stigmas that society has.\n\nI've now sort of become the person people go to regarding mental health in my friend group now, which is really funny. I have, however, struggled with some friendships. One of my oldest friends and I were having a big chat one day and I told her about my issues with body image and eating. I did not eat very much for a few months due to resurfacing childhood issues around my weight in relation to my relationship with my mother (she used to project onto me a lot because she was unhappy with her body). And in response to opening up about my struggle, she slapped me really hard on the arm. Which was very confusing to me. And made me feel really awful, because the whole time I knew what I was doing was bad, but I was getting skinnier, clothes were fitting me so much better, I felt comfortable with my body. I had gone through such a confusing time, of feeling like I was getting thin, but looking in the mirror and not seeing any difference, standing with groups of people and trying to make myself as small as possible because I felt that my body was huge and awful. Obviously due to not eating much I had many health problems which I am still trying to overcome. After I got myself out of starving myself I immediately started binge eating and I couldn't get myself to stop. I felt really empty and scared so I filled it with ridiculous quantities of food. It was a very confusing period also. I've gotten myself out of that and am working towards looking after my body so my brain works. I'm eating 5-6 times a day, making sure I get plenty of fruit and vegetables, I am exercising 4 times a week -  going to the gym and cycling and am generally feeling a lot better at this point. It has been really difficult to stay on track, but I allow myself one day a week to not be so strict on food, and I am also learning to forgive myself for slipping up. (I have a lot of food intolerances that I ignored for a while which made me even sicker but I'm making sure that I keep my diet limited to the stuff that makes me feel good and keeps me with enough energy to do all my uni work etc.)\n\nIt's really odd, I started out this big comment wanting to talk about how awful I was feeling but I am feeling quite good, especially about my lifestyle change.\n\nBut if I'm being fully honest, I have been on the pill for 2 months and it is making my life a living hell. I have gone up two bra sizes (and before that I was already quite a big chested gal so it's a huge pain), I've gained a ridiculous amount of weight, my skin has gotten worse instead of better, I have crazy mood swings and I feel constantly exhausted. Best part is, my doctor won't let me come off it. I had mild hormonal acne and was seeing someone sexually at the time of going on the pill, now I am definitely not seeing that person anymore and my once lightly spotted face is now fully covered in spots. They itch and hurt and look awful and there's nothing I can do about it. I don't have enough money to cover it up with makeup and it's summer here in Australia so it's way to hot to wear makeup outside all the time. I'm hoping that it will clear up now that I've changed my diet.\n\nMy brain is really all over the place at the moment, I wish I could make a really eloquent broader point about mental health and the struggles we all face. A lot has happened in my life over the last 3 months, so much so that I cannot face how I feel about it just yet, which means it's going to hit like a tonne of bricks soon enough. But I've struggled and gotten better, learned and have people who will always be there for me. \n\nThanks Mel for being so open and wonderful <3 Your videos always brighten my day x
Always good to hear from you Mel. You're the kind of person that makes people feel OK not to feel OK, actual therapy for some of us. Thanks for bashing the way American girls talk, lol. I'd like you to read a poem in that voice-awesome. Someday I would like to take a walk on your beach and look at the lighthouse and the scary islands. I hope you feel as good as you look, bye now, bye, bye bye, ok bye! Sending Love and Positive energy
Hi Melanie (and all others who read this),\nI have a few things to say, and hopefully you see this and can consider what will hopefully be helpful advice to you.\n\nFirstly, I spend about 3/4 weeks of a month having some sort of PMS symptom. Whether it be: Cravings, Mood Swings, Depression, Anxiety, Cramps, Nausea, Extreme Anger and of course the list goes on. It's an issue for me every month that for two weeks before my period I am just horrible to be around, or feeling completely not how I want to feel. With a bit of research, and talking to a few doctors I've found that I suffer from Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder or PMDD. \nPMDD is a severe version of PMS, where symptoms either emotional or physical, or both, are debilitating or affect a woman's daily life, relationships, work etc. PMDD symptoms usually last a longer time than PMS, and usually show up a week before menstruation and are gone a few days after it has begun (as mine, these symptoms can last longer, but if they aren't gone by the time that you've finished menstruating, or don't go away then there's a chance that there's something else wrong and a doctor should be recommended).\nSo, in saying this, I don't mean to be intrusive but have you ever considered that this condition may be the case for your what seem extreme PMS symptoms? If so, speak to a doctor about this condition, and you may be able to get some help for it, and it could make pressure on your work life and your relationships much easier with a bit of help!\n\nSecondly, to help with dealing with the feeling of having nothing to do, and your mind racing to catch up with the fact that you haven't got a big project to work on, why not focus on something small but something that might keep you focused, or feel like you have got something to do on your hands, like say, upload a video everyday? \nI'm not saying this for our benefit, although of course it will be loved, but maybe it will bring some focus to the chaos in your mind, and leave you feeling like you have a project to work on, even though you can opt out of this at anytime. Just something small, but large (if that makes sense), to tide you over until your next big thing?\n\nAnyway, that's all I have to say. I really care for you, and I admire just how strong you are. Keep doing what you're doing, and encouraging others to speak out. You're a dear.\n\nIf you, or anyone wants to talk my Instagram handle is @brianna.bambery, so just flick me a message and I'll be happy to chat about anything or everything.
You look so beautiful and glowy!!! \n\nAs far as sharing goes, I‚Äôve had a rough few months. I lost my job at the beginning of July because of brain bullshit, and then I got married in August. I‚Äôm thrilled to be with my husband, and I‚Äôm glad we got married, but goddamn are weddings stressful. I‚Äôm just getting to the point where I‚Äôm in enough of an upswing to start working again, and I‚Äôm so glad I have a job now where I can‚Äôt be fired because of attendance. I‚Äôve found it really helpful to remember that recovery is a process, not an event, and that having an off day (or an off three months) does not mean you‚Äôre always going to struggle as much as you are now <3
First, I'm so sorry that you're having a bad day. I can tell that you're not entire yourself here, or maybe it's just a side that we don't usually see (because you said that you don't film when you have bad days), and that's fine. It's part of being human. I've been dealing with anxiety this year (and I think a litle bit of depression) and I feel kinda like you, in the sense tha I don't have a big project to look forward to. I finished university last year and for the first time I feel lost. I had projects in mind that I had to pospone because of family and personal stuff and I just feel lost on the planet right now. But  with all these new feelings and emotions, I also tried something new, and that's therapy. Little by little I try to improve my mental health and also I've been trying not to be too hard to myself. So, I took a little break and I'm trying to do things that I enjoy, like painting, I pick up my guitar again (I haven't play it for so long, maybe 7 years) and I just try to take life and days with much more calm. Take care of yourself Mel, if you don't feel like doing a video, don't do it. Don't worry about what people are gonna say, haters always wanna bring youtubers down because they don't do a normal job, but they're just jealous. Being a youtube,r you communicate things to people I think you need to be well mentally to do a good job, and also, WE ALL deserve a break sometimes, no matter what our job is. It's important we all remember that, especially in this day. Take care Mel üíö
Hi ! :) it's such a comforting feeling to see that you posted a new video ! I would love to have your recipe for hot chocolate and red wine üç∑‚òïÔ∏è
I'm doing okay! I had a really awful weekend, but I found out on Monday that I've been accepted to study abroad in Germany this spring! I'm a little stressed out because I have to confront some family problems on a uni break this weekend, but I feel renewed from my exciting news and I'm really looking forward to the future instead of depending on it like I so often do. Love this video and you as always! Thanks for bringing up topics that can be hard to talk about <3
I love how real you are. From what you say, to how you say it,  even to how you edit your videos (extended cuts showing you losing your train of thought or getting sidetracked with your voice over top, instead of just jump cutting to a better take. I feel it greatly humanizes everything and makes you a real, honest person.) you're being your adorable, honest, interesting self. It's so refreshing watching your videos. I'm a guy and a lot of them don't apply to anything i'm interested in but I enjoy watching them because you're in them. Like you said before on how you've evolved into watching youtubers for their personalities rather than just their content. Anyways, thank you so much for sharing and I hope you have a slendiferous day/night!
It's EXACTLY the same thing for me at the moment, I feel sooo down and on the verge of tears everyday because of period hormons :(
Thank you for observing World Mental Health Day in this video, I needed it. Mentioning personal experiences in the comments is nothing new...but I had to post something. None of us are alone in these psychological struggles, and for myself it helps remembering that...I'm in the thick of my problems as many of you are, but I hope more individuals band together and support each other. You're strong, you are lovely, and we will make it <3

Does anyone know where her gold choker is from? Been looking for it forever xx
Looove those scarves!! I picked a couple up last year and after using the soft ones I couldn't go back to any of my other ones... also, can you link us your jewelry pieces?!
loved so many items! Why have I decided to go capsule wardrobe üò©
How tall are you?
Where are your earrings from, love them!
How did you make your thumbnail where you cut yourself out with the white bit around you? Xx
Hello October, you've come round so quickly! üçÅ
Really like this makeup look, I know you said the lipstick is discontinued but I'd love a tutorial of the whole look
I love the font you use on your thumbnails! What is it called?
Who knows where to find the short necklace that she is wearing? Please?)
good call on the aviator jacket - you're right .. its the perfect length on you! lovely haul - love you!!
where are your earrings from? i love them!!
Oh my I LOVED every single thing in this haul üòçüíú
Paused the video to buy the red sweater with the bow. üòÇ
Love the green cardigan and the suede jacket best.  I love the pink jumper contrasted with the black tie (very Chanel) but I would return since it has pulls in it.
that first grey scarf looks amazing on you! especially with your hair and makeup like that. so pretty <3
You can poke the pulled thread through the jumper (just stretch it a little bit where it's pulled-you will be able to poke it through one of the holes and pull it through from the inside). I have 2 cats I have to do it all the time!
LOVE LOVE LOVE everything from this haul. I'm a short arse too and I need that aviator jacket it's perfect. üëå Where are you jeans from you're wearing in the cut away frames? Xx
Number 14 on trending eeeek!!!! Loved this haul, but my bank account did not üòÇ love the olive tones and that scarf is lovely üòç
Hey Suzi , just wondering what hairdresser you go to ..? :) loved the haul. Knew you would kill it with an autumn haul. The aviator jacket is sooo flattering on you üòçüòç
could you tell me what jeans you are wearing???
Very good video!but i cannot opeen the links!i want to buy firectly things i have got iphone6 and when i cleek on them it goes to a blank page whatever video i  see!can u help?thnk u!

everything is beautiful.. also  the last coat..
That olive cardigan is absolute GOALS! It looks so soft and cozy, which is a must have for the fall! üòçüçÇ
Where are the white drawers behind you from please?
How tall are you? It would just be helpful in relation to sizing :)
I have the same faux suede jacket and I am soo happy with it! It's so worth buying. Love your hauls, especially Zara ones!!!!üòç
Use a bobbypin to fix the snag in your jumper!
Top haul. I have recently become obsessed with Zara this season. I recently bought an insane pale pink and faux fur sweater with huuuge balloon sleeves. It's life. I LOVE it.
Great video! You got so many cute clothes!! I have a small channel that I am really trying to grow. I would be super grateful if anyone could go check it out!üíú
We have the same aviator jacket üò¨ I love it! It's so warm. Looks great on you x
Your hair colour is just so nice :D
Everything looks amazing and suits so well! Except I agree that the ‚Äúcape style‚Äù coat at the end doesn‚Äôt sit as well as the other pieces.
What lipstick are you wearing? It look amazing on you!! xoxo
When u wear the cuffs over your hands!!! üôà
I got the same jacket but in pink xD
tha aviator jacket looks so perfect on you !!!! i love ur videos !
Love your style..more of hauls.. I just added everything in wishlist üòçüòçüíó
Fell in love with your earrings, where are they from? <3
That leather jacket you're wearing when showing the beanie!! Where is it from I've been after a jacket like that!!
I'm sooo gold you said that about jumpers being tight at the bottom and that they're not as flattering. All the jumpers I have that I love are loose and I was just about to get a tight one on ASOS. Ta!  Haha
So jealous that you can wear scarves and sweaters already, we‚Äôre still waiting for the cold in New York üò≠
These videos are my favourite! Try on hauls are the best.
I bought the cape coat but returned it because it was just too thin. For the money I didn‚Äôt think it was worth it. Also didn‚Äôt have any washing instructions in it üôà
I just ordered the oversize cardigan in gray. It will be perfect for when I fly to New Zealand in February. I had to limit my self, but wanted to buy everything in this haulüíï
Ohhh so nice! Girl three bags for your birthday- you don't need to justify yourself! Love love love xxx
The grey hat. Love it.
Love the cardigans and herringbone grey /beige scarf, I love the bat wing coat on you, will be best when it's really cold as it looks roomy and big enough to wear a thick jumper underneath and still button it up. Your style is so good Susie X ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèªüíï
I bought the same sweaters in the exactly same colorsüòÇ
What jeans are you wearing?
Where are your jeans from? x
Makeup tut on this look please
Loving all of your haul, love a good knit recently!!! The Zara aviator is in fact ¬£25.99 üò±üò±üò±üò±üò± so a Brucey bargain rather than ¬£50 as you quoted, I bought one in mustard yellow and it also comes in a pink üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç I‚Äôm in love
I am happy for you, my Zara basket is filled with amazing items, but I live in Louisiana, so I haven't ever worn the clothes I got last year ‚òπÔ∏è, I am still tempted to get a couple
Love your videos. What is the lipstick you are wearing? It's lovely and really suits you xx
a very nice haul you got there :)
To be honest I'll never get why anyone would consider something 'high quality' when it's literally made up of only plasticy synthetic fibers like acrylic that will look terrible after a year of wearing...
Do you actually try things on in store?
Love the aviator jacket! Your fashion content is so nice to watch :) xx
I want that camel jumper on you so much but it‚Äôs out of stock :‚Äô(
Zara is life! Love these pieces!
Where are your earrings from?
actually, I think the cape is really cute. It's really stylish and fashionable.
I have the red jumper with the bow except In cream, but it's gone so bobbly already even though I haven't washed it. Does anyone know how I can save it? So sad it looks so old and worn :(
You're looking good, girl!üôåüèª Cute Haul!!!
Don‚Äôt keep the pink jumper with the black bow doesn‚Äôt really look cute and it kinda makes you look wide and hides your figure ‚ú®
Where is this lipstick from? :)
I love everything omg!\n\nAlso, I personally really like long cardigans and I think this one looks lovely on you! However, if your looking for a shorter alternative, check out the cream one Zoella got from ASOS‚Äã in her latest haul. It looks so cosy, but I also think it is the perfect length for what your looking for xx
What lipstick are you wearing PLEASE TELL US xxx
What jeans are you wearing??
Stupid little puppy claws... seriously disappointing?
Love these type of videos with try ons!Also love the scarves.Liked them all from the start on your youtube vlogs!
Youtube made me buy it...so I now got the beige scarf, thanks Suzie ;-). I'd totally be in favour of a Bag Collection video :-)
Love this zara haul would love to see more of these

Is Superman alive??? Is he coming back??
Superman is in this movie??? I am so shocked... I thought he would actually stay dead in BvS... Gasp.... -_- \n\nAnd that's right, Superman's short controversial impact on the world is now gone... I mean, he actually had a big part in the world and made a few differences.. not like his time was so short that he couldn't possibly be a deterrent long enough for people to do less crimes or go against America... \n\nI mean, he was a huge thing of hope for people.. and he was definitely not mistrusted and protested against... \n\nThey earned the impact of Superman... just like how he died at the most perfect time...
There's going to be 10 trailers before this is released. I guess they're trying to give us the Joss Version of things lol.

Ia Superman Deads ? In This Film
Gal Gadot proved herself worthy of being the new symbol of modern wonder woman, but Lynda Carter will still be the classic original for me. Still, I am looking for more of her performances. Everybody else is another story...
It will definitely the best movie of this year, I'm going to watch this...
Nah man they should have made a few more movies on the flash, aqua man and cyborg just like the did with Wonder Woman. I‚Äôm pretty pessimistic about how this will be they are moving to fast.
So who all tried to stop the frame before 0.2 sec to see her ass.
wish it was Grant Gustin as the flash. dont get me wrong, Ezra Miller is a great actor, i just prefer Grant Gustin as the flash
Only reason I am seeing this is for my boy Khal Drogo.
NEW CHANNEL: watch my vids for some top cheeky content!
Just gonna watch because of wonderwoman and aqua man
Gal i love you‚ù§
Did not have high hopes, but honestly this is a great trailer...
Batman -'Hey Robin, is it sexuial assault if I tweak your nips on camera...? \n\nRobin-Please don't rape me in the Batmobile...
So apparently the first scene in this trailer that everyone is so hopeful about was actually by Zack though I find it interesting  that everyone thinks joss did it. Props to both of them though this movie is going to awesome
I hope the flash isn't gonna be annoying..
The SUPERMAN THEME AT 0:20 oh my fucking god dude
I know aquaman is from the ocean but did they really have to make him into some surfer dude.. my mann surfs upp dude! YAYERRRR\n\np.s Infinity War trailer KILLED THIS.
i was surprised superman is alive, i thought hes dead üò≤
I still think grant gustin should be the flash
justice league without a FUCKIN SUPERMAN !!!!
MY MAN! Obvious simulation is obvious.
Cyborg and Flash look cool, but Gal Gadot still can't act and Aquaman doesn't talk like a street punk. DC screwed this up before the ink on the script dried. I'll go back and watch the Dark Knight again.

1. Clark is wearing the Donner Clark Kent flannel\n2. Clark has the Superman hair curl
Some people said this trailer is more like video game trailer than movie trailer because of the CGI, and then they said that DCEU sucks. But, GOTG has a lot of CGI too. Why you don't complain about that? I agree that JL and GOTG has too much CGI & VFX, far more than Avengers movies ever had. No matter how good the CGI & VFX, if it's overused, it will looks like cartoon anyway. But there is NO OTHER WAY. JL is a group of gods (featuring Batman) and GOTG is a group of aliens, so there is should be a lot of CGI & VFX in their movies. It's impossible to use organic or practical effects to make a bunch of massive explosions, destroyed buildings, red sky, giant blue light dome, lavas coming from the ground, fire and lightning spread everywhere, how you could make those effects without CGI & VFX?? It's impossible. The only way to make JL movie with minimum usage of CGI & VFX is rewrite the script and give the project to serious director like Nolan. But ofcourse a lot of comic fans will not like that. SO, if you don't like a  movie with 20% reality and 80% cartoon, stop watching recent superheroes movies, watch Nolan's movies or Oscar's best pictures instead.
If no one dies in this then i'm done with super hero movies.
Didn't expect this to be an Adidas commercial
who did the cover of the song? it's awesome
Does Batman grab anyone's tits in this movie?
Wtf voice It looks for me like deeply  boot|  work%great
rofl JL without the manhunter xD fuck is this shit
as far as i can see on the trailer, its only cgi and fake color
waiting so long for this
Is it be or every time flash something I cringe

They said ‚ÄúGreen Lantern, hate to break to ya your out of the team! Can‚Äôt be both Deadpool and Green Lantern, you fourth wall breaking piece of shit, and your GL movie sucks!‚Äù- Batman
Are they seriously still pretending Superman is dead?
Had this movie not been directed by Zack Snyder I would have had more expectations. But this movie is not looking good plot wise nor action wise
I am a huge fan of Star Wars, much longer fan then DC... but damn, I am more excited about his film, then the new SW!!!
better than thor and star wars...\nThis was the year of DC and Warner! f*** u disney!!!

Hahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahaha!! Yet another pile of shit from the DCEU! What is this, a video game? DC deserves every bit of bad reception their movies receive. That‚Äôs what they get for jumping the gun and attempting to create a whole Marvel-like cinematic universe in two movies. They even blew their load too soon within the movies themselves! Introducing Batman without establishing him first in his own standalone film? Killing off Superman in literally the second film in the franchise? And those are not even the numerous ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù mistakes, like casting Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor ‚ÄúJr‚Äù or Jared Letto as the Joker. Haha they could have literally just cast Jessie as the Joker and he would have been fine! Also, how about the infamous ‚ÄúMartha‚Äù scene? What were the writers thinking?! üòÇ I‚Äôve already heard the first cut of JL was ‚Äúunwatchable‚Äù so the trend appears to continue. They done fucked themselves real good and I‚Äôm just enjoying the shit show!
1:27 what's that song?
Dc has higher budget\nMarvel has higher box office
this is going to be better than the avengers.
Why not superman present in this?
Doesn't look that good tbg
Who's the villain in this movie?
Height of disappointment. This is what they have in their sleeves against Marvel's Thor Ragnarok. Batman was much better as a solo hero. üòìüòì
This movie looks like a complete garbage.Just like every DC movie in recent time.I hope that you will do something better is future!
I hope Superheros save USA people from NK alsoüòÅüòÅ

This movie will be fucking trash

DID I SEE DISCLOSURE IN THE TRAILER JUST NOWWW!
Jesus is coming back soon. Repent from all your sins, Turn from your wicked ways, and follow Jesus. God's judgement is upon the ppl of America for their sins and foolishness and for how they treated the Slaves the real Jews  which are the Black ppl in America. God is gonna destroy this country very soon. Our country is very wicked and has been getting alot worse for a long time. Our ppl are falling further way from God, the churches aren't speaking the truth, the government is evil and full of Devil worshippers and has been since the start of our country and ppl following them, our ppl were are brainwashed to go fight wars for our country to steal ppls gold and minerals like oil, ppl are pledging to a flag disobeying God idolizing a symbol, the schools took prayer away and don't talk about God, science lies and goes against the Bible, our communities are filled with ppl selling and doing drugs. Our ppl are living so wicked they lie, deceive, steal, fight, kill, do drugs, smoke, drink alcohol, selling drugs, having sex before marriage, cheating on their spouse, watching porn, lusting, being jealous, being hateful, being selfish, idolizing Musicians actors athletes and others instead of Jesus, glorifying money, listening to or making music that is foolish and that isn't Glorifying God, and disobeying all of God's commandments. God is very angry and will destroy our country completely, ppl need to repent from their sins, put God 1st, and follow Jesus. The wrath of God is serious and U are suppose to fear God and that's means U will live right and be Holy cause U know God's wrath is serious and he will destroy evil. Jesus Loves us all and he wants us to truly follow him. \n\nAccept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour (Romans 10:9)\n\nRepent from all your sins (2 Chronicles 7:14)\n\nGet baptized in the name of Jesus (Acts 2:38)\n\nHave a deep relationship with Jesus (John 4:16)\n\nFollow Jesus\n\nRead the Bible learn the word of God (Joshua 1:8)\n\nSpeak the word of God to the world (Mark 16:15)\n\nLead ppl to Jesus \n\nDo the Lord's will to the end (Matthew 24:13)
Are you really really big serious...\nYour super massive awesome music. \nI can‚Äôt wait for it !!!!

Harry those 2 holes on you tow hitch are for the safety chains on a trailer. Incase a trailer comes off the tow hitch ball, the safety chains wiith hooks stay connected and insure the trailer doesn't go into on coming traffic, hit a person or a building etc. You want a tow hitch bike rack like this. It'll slide right in to the square receiver n fastened with a big pin .....¬†\n https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-Racks/Thule/TH990XT.html?feed=npn&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIofbev_jp1gIVQWSGCh1JkAubEAQYBCABEgKO2fD_BwE\nThule make good hitch racks. Hope this helps.

Harry, get the space brace for your ankles when you ride. They will save your ankles! Also help you get revived.
I am so glad harry is keeping it like his channel in stead of worrying about youtubes rules! Cheers!
you can purchase a bike rack that just sicks right into the square hole in the back.
thumbs up for nandos (SA for the win)
There is a tow hitch already on it. Just removed that plastic blocking the hitch and you can use your bike rack.
the riding shorts are good  but maybe invest in better jerseys, those ones look like they are for cross country, also an enduro helmet would help.. For example ( troy lee designs A2 helmet) having longer shorts is better too,  the jacket is good.
its a bit shit mate, got to a mountain bike specific store and there get you the baller shit you need man!
That was one of the funniest vids I've ever seen!! Good start with the Enduro gear, just stay away from Spprts Direct next time. Have a ganders at Endura clothing on Chain Reactin Cycling.
Parking over two spaces like a twat
Harry!!!! You don‚Äôt need glasses bro, just bang on a sick set of goggles with your full face üòú
Why don't you get a roof rack for the bike
for your towbar try Caravan and Camping/ towers in southport
You have a hitch on your Sport already mate.  All you need is a bike rack now, it will go right into the existing receiver.\n\nSomething line this would work https://www.roofbox.co.uk/scripts/rbvehsel4_tab.php/car-specific-accessories/buzz_rack_bb4_4_bike_wheel_support_rack_no_brp304/Qx%40w%2C6M42VAwp3%40Rb%7B~cC4ure5HXEB\n\nGood luck with the ankle and the date bro!
Nice little fear and loathing in Las Vegas look! Yesslad
Get a tld Jersey they're the best
Holy shit mate, i sprained my ankle on a second degree and y have a friend that hurt it 4th degree, and now you!, we were joking that hurting your ankle was the new trend. Its fkin nuts. What up with the global energy or wtf is going on, too many synchrinicities
A Thule should just slide right into that hitch that's already on your car. And I'd definitely get a neck brace for downhill riding. If you go head first into a tree without one you'll for sure fuck ur shit up.
The square in the middle is the tow hitch receiver...typically you'd slide a trailer hitch w/ ball mount in there to tow a trailer, but they make bike racks that slide right in there as well, similar to this  https://cdn1.static-tgdp.com/ui/productimages/approved/std.lang.all/90/45/t2_classic_wloc_9044_9045_sized_750x492.jpg
You already have a receiver hitch, which is the squareish opening back there, which is what all bike racks insert into anyways. Get a North Shore style rack or a tray rack. North Shore mounts the bikes so the sit vertically long ways. Tray rack they just sit by the wheels horizontally. North Shore rack would be my personal opinion any day as you can hold way more bikes and they don't extend out so bloody far, so they are sturdier and more compact so that you're less likely to back into things.
You already have a towing receiver. Just buy a bike rack that fits your (guessing) 2inch receiver.
Harry you need a hitch bike rack. You already have the hitch you just need the rack not a tow bar. US price is less than $100
get  full face helmet with the remove able chin piece there better for enduro type riding
Don‚Äôt get a Thule get a North shore rack they are much better
buy a thule bike rack or a roof rack for the MTB it will look steeazy and its not half that expensive
stretch the other side of your ankle.
check out the online store chain reaction cycles
You have a hitch receiver. Just get a 2 rack.  ü§ò
You should have gotten the TLD or FOX gear
Most hilarious video in a while or maybe I am just in a good mood.\nI feel Harry is back to having tonnes of fun and just doing things he loves!\n\nVery good to see my man, cannot wait to watch you shred some enduro in your new get up!
Go on chain reaction cycle if you want good deals on any mtb stuff
Hahahaha the ginger part. Sounded like u said shall I edit that hahahahahahah. Hilarious
I enjoy the mountain bike videos
your fucking quality man videos are sick.
for outdoor sports stuff go to decathlon if there is one near you not sports direct
Riding gear is right I'd just go to a local bike shop
hi harry i have some downhill trousers and a top you can have . the top is a large and the trouser are a small to medium they were only used a couple of times . they are in good nic. let me know if you want them
Check out the Bell Super 3R helmet. It's a half shell but has a chin bar that you can attach and detached. Means when your confidents goes up you can remove the chin bar.
Hope his ankles alright but him hitting that tree was fantastic üòÇ
I feel you pain. Always did my feet and ankles. In the end I just permanently rode with 661 ankle braces on. Made a big difference in pain management and feeling confident. You're totally killing it on the MTB by the way üëç
As an MTBer who did some homework, I recommend Osprey back/hydration packs, camelback is the big name but osprey are better thought out, Chain Reaction are a good start point, another top tip, join British Cycling for ¬£20 2nd get 10% discount at CRC, have saved myself a fortune
Shimano do a great hydration pack and alterations or funkier clothing is good
any fox mtb clothing are the best, for winter I've just bought the fox downhill polar pants and a gore-tex waterproof jacket......best mtb gear purchases i have made! For a full face i suggest the POC Coron...rated for multiple impacts so you can crash it a lot and you'll survive
10:48 i lost my shit holy fuck that was funny xD
bro you should make your own cry down hill gear shoes the lot job will look sick
The central square hole under the bumper is the main armature part of a tow bar(the expensive bit!), you have the electrics fitted too (black plastic thing to the right of square with sprung lid!). I doubt that you have the plug in part with the hitch under the floor in the boot (it's too big to fit under the floor, old ones used to attach differently and fit under the floor). Go to LR Supermarket in Speke, they can sort you with the bit that's missing (I have the adjustable height removable bar on my RR) - also they sell Thule bike racks - the 'tilting' ones are recommended cos you can still open the boot with bikes on the rack!
Budget is best sometimes man ruin it re buy :)
For your enduro rides you should def get a pair of bib shorts. Basically a Lycra suspender shorts but it has a pad in and stops any chafing. \n\nIt took me years to start wearing them. It it's the best thing I ever did.
giro switchblade is a pretty good helmet for enduro and dh
Osprey hydration packs are really good I‚Äôve had one for a year and it‚Äôs really good
Towbars are normally a few hundred quid. Just shop around at scrap metal places and stuff or CES or euro car parts. They will certainly have something for you
An easy way to remember what you need to do is called R.I.C.E.  R- rest I- ice C- compression & E- elevation. If you do that you‚Äôll heal quicker.
Get roof bars fitted by a Land Rover specialist not Land Rover themselves and then get a roof rack for the bikes
You need to get a ute to put your bikes on the back
Why don't you get someone to fabricate one lad
I sprained my ankle really badly and wrapped it up tight to stop it flopping about when on crutches. Turns out it's not the best thing to do according to NHS
And there is a channel on YouTube callGMBN that is all about mountain biking and everything you need to know when you are starting off
Such an expensive vehicle I would go the dealer to get the tow Barr
Come subscribe to my Chanel new to youtube would like your support I do biking vids
As a mountain biker I am loving this shizzz!
i'd recommend the fox proframe helmet, it's lite and cool enough to just wear all the time but it's full face. i have one and its sick! or the bell one with the removable chin piece.
Those two holes are for the safety chains.
If ur gonna be riding enduro and u want to hav a full face u shud try a helmet with a removable chin bar ..will make the climbs much more enjoyable
Bruh I'll message you on Instagram and tell ya what you need. I can send ya pics, look for low.nali \n\nYou range rover has the tow package you just need the drop hitch bike rack.
Dayumn dude.. kid is not even born yet and the dad jokes begin. LOL. 6:22
Where can I get one of those Pixar balls!? :D
you couldn't just say Why I like this short\n\ntop 10 reasons? like we needed 10 reasons, nevermind top _10_ -_ -
Fun Hawaiian fact about the Uku is lice part, it's called an ukulele because your fingers are moving and jumping around like ukus
Are you guys gonna do a trailer review for the new Star Wars trailer?
There is also the fact that story telling is a very big part of the Hawaiian culture and music. Not only do you have to tell a story by the lyrics, you have to tell the story by the music. I remember the first time I watched the short, (which btw is my all time fave as well), I was crying before I even watched the movie! lol. In other words: It was such an amazing short because of it told a story.
I thought you were going to say this on number 1. But it is based on a love story. More accurately, the love story of IZ, one of the most influential people in the history of hawaii. You probably know him for his somewhere over the Rainbow and what a wonderful world song.
I always sing this song whenever I hear it
Presto is the best these people don't know what there talking about
I really liked Lava too, but my fav is the 2D animated one about opposites.
LAVA!!! Ever since I was 3, I had been saying that I was waiting for my true love, then at 7, I met a nice boy in my class who liked me, then I liked him, but he had forgotten about me, but now I am currently dating him.
the story was based around the Hawaiian guy who sang Over The Rainbow, and his wife bc he was a large lonely man until his tall hopeful beautiful wife came into the picture btw
I literally remember being in the theater with my sister and this came on and we were in tears laughing at how dumb this was. It was literally a knock off song of the over the rainbow Hawaiian version with a super cheesy story. We were in hysterics
I have another napkin story!  Monty Oum smudged ketchup on a napkin in IHOP to make the world of Remnant in RWBY.  He also used different foods to symbolize ice, mountains, deserts, etc.  I feel like you'd like RWBY.  It's a little different than your normal content, but it's characters are very relatable and fun.  I think you guys could have fun with it.  Just consider RWBY pls.
My science teacher used the short to teach us about tectonic plates and stuff like that in fourth grade
Holy shit you're an exact rip off of vlog brothers disliked
Love this, just one little thing...Hawaii is a hotspot, rather than converging plates. Much like yellowstone, but under the ocean instead of the land.
Check out the Shakeman show page for funny bits not for the faint at heart or easily offended
Funny thing about that pole:  Lifted is my favorite Pixar short.
If Boundin' isn't your favorite there is something wrong with this generation
I can't unsee that the middle top little green man on his shirt is wearing a tie.
My top 10 shorts that are better than Lava. #1 being the best short ever.\n\n10. Partly Cloudy\n9. Boundin'\n8. For The Birds\n7. La Luna\n6. One Man Band\n5. Presto\n4. Luxo Jr.\n3. Lou\n2. Geri's Game\n1. Night and Day
Looks like they had babies hahahahaha I lost it üòÇüòÇ
Hello from peters creek road
Geri's Game will always reign supreme!
Everybody knows that the greatest Pixar short is Mr. Incredible and Pals
I think it's hilarious that he listened to this song on repeat after going to a beer festival
That song broke my replay button....
#livelifebuttfirst are words to live by...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I really don't like Boundin'. It scared me as a child/scarred me for life... *Ugh, such ugly animation, terrifying*üòùüò¢
This was the lamest short ever, I don't understand how so many people liked it. And I love Pixar shorts! But this one, uh.
That's why last year we played LAVA on the ukulele üéºüéº
I now understand why I don't like this short: I have no luck in love and the topic depresses me.
I think that Lava is the WORST Pixar short, that's why:\n1 - It is a love song\n2 - I hate love songs
You forgot the most important reason why it's the best! It's a pun!!!
Who went and listened to the song after this video because that shit was stuck in my head for a year. \n\nA long long time ago
Hey Jonathan my birthday is January 28 and your boy is being born in that month how cool would that be if he was born on my birthday
Mine has to be 'Piper' or 'Lou'
whats the short about the guy that plays chess with himslf
You don't No How to work on the call
Awww I didn't know you were married? And with a son? Soooo cute!
Ionno I find it cringe tbh.\nBut can understand why others like it.
Awe. Ok that made me fall in love with Lava more
Wait two volcanoes in love, isn't this just popocatepetl and iztaccihuatl in Hawaii
What the heck this is a weird video lol
I lava my son.\nHe's not even a dad yet, but he's already making dad jokes.
I‚ÄôVE LITERALLY BEEN OBSESSING OVER THIS SONG FOR WEEKS
My favorite Pixar short is about a girl who lost her grandma and she lives in an alley selling some kind of match and she lites them all to feel the warmth of her grandma it makes me sad sit it is good üôÇ
I'd vote for piper                  soooooooooooooooo cute
I have always wondered one thing about Harry Potter. Before I say it I want to say I do love the franchise but one thing has always bothered me.\nHow do the students of Hogwarts learn regular core classes? You know, like math, English, history? PLEASE make a video on it  because it has always bothered me. Thanks!!!!
I just LAVA lava. It is so amazing
I thought u were going to show it. Fuck u asshole.
NOOOOO NOT THE SOCK CLUB (favorate short is one man band)
I almost cried during the song
The Star Wars - The Last Jedi official teaser is OUT! BREAK IT DOWN IMMEDIATELY
I‚Äôll be honest. I‚Äôve never paid attention to Pixar shorts, (didn‚Äôt even know they were a thing until your video ranking them), and I haven‚Äôt seen the majority to be able to rank them myself.
Ye Jim Murphy rightio with the pronunciation, love Lava cuz of how they named the characters after said instruments üòçüòçüòç
I love this short
who\nThe hell\nCares
Me and the fiance say I lava you when we're feeling especially disgustingly cutesy. This has always been my favourite of the shorts, though the piper came in a close second for me.
My choir sang lava last year and we played ukeleles
Well someone already mentioned The Bruddah Iz connection so I'll add that it's the first song on my son's bedrime playlist. As for tournaments maybe recommending baby names.
I just wanna be invited to the wedding.
LIES: Knick Knack is by far the best
Can you do more Lion King theories?
Just a correction. The Hawaiian volcanoes are hotspots, not tectonic plate margin volcanoes. Not that anyone cares...
Im surprised Lou was so low in the list. I loved Lou!! It was so cute and touching!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
My lava story was about a teacher that we shared a love over this short film, and when I got a ukulele I promised her I'd learn it and perform it for her and I'm now working on it!
Just when I realize ‚Äúhey I can finally join the super Carlin sock club‚Äù I got Twitter two days ago, they end it and now to get featured you need to by their merch:/  I really wanted to get featured
Congratulations! You're gonna be a Dad!
Does Hagrid know Dark Magic? In the first book he said he flew to reach the hut on the rock.
Anyone else get goosebumps  when J talks about baby Carlin üòç never been so excited for the birth of a child
Piper is by far my favourite, I liked it more than finding Dory. XD
Lava was the first Pixar short I remember watching in a theater before the movie (like, not on YouTube or anything)
What did the tectonic plate say after the earthquake.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm shook but it wasn't my fault.
what the one man band seemed pretty cool im my opinion
The time is 6:06. Have fun Internet
Okay not a Pixar short but I love the Mickey Mouse: 'To Get a Horse' (2013) I love how they mix old style animation with modern effects.\n\nDoesn't help I love similar things like Epic Mickey. But the short is really funny and cleverly uses the ...well watch it yourself.\n\nHere a good link: https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1euywx
‚Äú...Converging, diverging and side swiping each other..\nMe: ‚Äúhey I know these terms, and the side swiping term is...wait...I swear I learned this last year in 7th grade science...what? how do I not know...‚Äù
What about Day and Night?
I have a LAVA story!!! Me and a friend in ukulele club at our school sang the lava song but halfway through we forgot the chords for the chorus so we just started singing and the rest of the class started singing with us! It was so much fun!!!
That song from the short is just so bad...
My teacher decided to basically use their teacher skills as an excuse to give a bunch of kids nostalgia by showing them Pixar shorts (and showing them new ones). They used the excuse of looking at plot progressions and Pixar shorts are, well, short, so we could watch a ton of them to look at how all plots have patterns. It was great. The only one I hadn‚Äôt seen was Lifted. I liked it. I think maybe it‚Äôs a thing that is just lower on people‚Äôs list, like few people‚Äôs favorite, but in many people‚Äôs top 10. IDK. Probably not.
okAY IT MADE ME CRY SO, THEREFORE, IT‚ÄôS THE BEST
This short sucks
Geri‚Äôs game!!
Boundin was my entire childhood

OMG wow you got sent so much! You‚Äôre so lucky, I can‚Äôt even afford one of her products :(
You make putting on makeup so easy. I really want to try fenti but the closest stockist is in Gold Coast (I am in Townsville) and I need to try the shades. I always get scared when people put on the contour creams but they look so good when you blend them out. Maybe I should try them
Wow Chloe you look so happy in this vid üòäü§ó
Does anyone ever notice that she looks like Candice Victore Secret & Kendall jenner ??
Love your hair!! The final result of your makeup is stunning. Sexy afüëç
I really loved your energy in this video! A++\nAlso, your hair. Amazeballs. xx
what are these lashes ?!?!?!
you're so gorgeous :)
GORGEOUS GORGEOUS GORGEOUS <3
What colours would you say is closest to 280? Meaning shades in other brands, I've ordered mine too dark and I'm swapping it for something else but I have to order online.\n\nI find that I'm the same shades as you most of the time in foundations.
you always do makeup so flawlessly <3 so much love
Chloe! Did you get married? What‚Äôs this new ring on your finger??????? üò±
Hello Chloe can you make a tuto about your hair ??? PLEASE! kiss <3

Your hair looks really nice in this video Chloe! Such a beautüòä
Your eye makeup is incredible üòç
I need to go and try some of their products asap üòçüôåüèº
why it didn't look good is bc the blender is a build able coverage and the brush is instant full coverage...
‚ÄúI usually actually just jizz it on my chest.‚Äù üòÇü§£üòÇ
I still love your content
Chloe babes can you do some fashion videos ? I love your style üíñ
i really love that your videos are thorough but also to the point and quick! youre so beautiful!
The foundation is supposed to be sweat proof but yesterday half of my makeup evaporated üò≠ \nIs that only me or...?
‚ÄúHopefully no oil comes off bc I just did my makeup....-weLL WOULD YA LOOK AT THAT IM OILY AS F‚Äù
Your lips are looking so good Chloe! üòç Who is doing them now?
The highlighter looks amazing on you, and the fact that it stayed for 10 hours is amazing because I feel like it is the first thing that comes off on me!
I usually just actually just jizz it on my chest. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ  CRYING! I love you Chloe.
I actually can‚Äôt believe the products that you gurus get. It‚Äôs amazing they can afford to send everyone of the colors to all of you and charge the public a fortune üîÆ for them. I know it sounds like jealousy but it‚Äôs actually thinking they are dumb as hell. You guys don‚Äôt even use most of them. They lose a lot there but get it back from us. You guys can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs for your kit because you don‚Äôt do other peoples makeup anymore. It‚Äôs just yourself. I think you guys should start doing other people. It would be interesting. Still love all your videos. Not against you. You can‚Äôt help it but you should do more giveaways for colors you can‚Äôt use. I‚Äôll take whatever. üòâ hehe
Can you do a tutorial on this hairstyle please?! It's gorgeous xx
You look so stunning at the end of the video!
You look beautiful Chloe! Can you review the new Galaxy collection by Fenty beauty ?
Was waiting for this babes!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Just the tip of the Iceberg, how low have we allowed ourselves to sink? Homeless Vets on OUR Streets, Homeless full stop! Corrupt Governments,¬†a Cataclysm of staged attacks, Women & Children dying every day, needlessly, while you pander your own Narcissistic Ego, mind boggling, how¬†dumbed down you have allowed yourselves to become. Satisfied with your material fallacies! Keep watching your scrying mirrors, keep swallowing your Blue Pills. Makes me ashamed to be part of the same Race.

Woah it looks terrible at the end. I honestly hated all the products i tried from the fenty line specially the foundation. I returned everything

Do I hear a cat purring towards the end of the video, or am I just crazy?
Oh my God ... You are not that pretty without makeup.
I still don't like Rihanna üòÇ for the same reasons as Chloe when she didn't. I don't hate her but I don't love her. No hate at all! I just don't see why she's so amazing
It looks awful after 10 Hours, though you have perfect skin! The eyeshadows stayed so well!

Although we didn't manage to get 7M view within 48 hours, I'm still proud of this fandom and our boys. üíö üíö \n\nTheir dance move is super great in this MV.

I love that all the guys started singing spice girls lol ü§£ü§£üòÇ
Love the Halloween opening!!!
You put a top panel on you middle tier. Did the gumpaste stay soft enough for the bubble tea straws
You guys are funny! (: JJR I always enjoy watching your vids!
Is that like a weird instrumental of ghost town in the background???
Honestly I think the spider would have been creepier if he would left it bone white and painted the top-tier gold underneath it. Cuz then I would look like a weird Fusion of the skeleton and spider
One of my most favourite video...if you wanna be my lover LOL üòÇ
My new favorite sound is the cutting bubble tea straws. Btw just found your YouTube channel from the trending videos.
This was one of the funniest episodes ever!!!  I loved watching this one!
Sorry, but I gotta love the singing and the Spice Girls references.  Totally liked for the Spice Girls stuff!!
I like the added Spice Girls üòÖ
hands down my favorite episode the singing and back seat caking make this too legit to quit. #backseatcaking
Their singing is beautiful
me and my best friend are thing 1 and thing 2
My best Halloween costume (or, at least, my favorite) was Eric Draven from The Crow. I was about twelve or thirteen, wore an all black outfit with a life-sized crow decoration stitched to the shoulder of my shirt (and of course I had the makeup). It was awesome, and we didn't even get to go trick or treating that year -_-
This is one of the most beautiful cakes I've ever seen! It's so elegant!!! I loved every detail... AMAZING JOB!
so is he a top or bottom
I absolutely love your work!!!! Please please please do a two sided cake!!!!!!
The Halloween intro is amazing

Hello I have a question. Is there a reason u don't paint before and touch up after? Just curious.
I wonder where all the cakes go?
The banter between them all made this more enjoyable! Not that it wouldn't be without it but it made me smile ü§ó
Loved the singing üòÇüòÇüòÇ,  your cake's look so yummy and beautiful ,  love you're show.
That wasn't a Halloween cake, it was a Wedding cake!!! but the two are not mutually exclusive so I will call this, Halloween Wedding cake üë∞üéÉüç∞,
My best costume was a cardboard refrigerator running
This channel needs more singing üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Best halloween costume was was probably han solo, my friends were chewy, luke and Leia
I want to make a hALloween  but I am terrible at cakes and desserts

#cakeslayer wouldnt It have been easier if you had used a pasta machine w the gum paste to make strands of hair??
üòÇüòÇüòÇ one of my favourite videos!
I missed the theme song :(
The cake is hauntingly beautiful. I love that spider,it's elegant and creepy. As a 90's kid who was (and still is) a big fan of the Spice Girls I just enjoyed when your team started singing the songs.
Their humor! I LOVE IT!! üòÇ FRIENDSHIP NEVER EEEENDSSS üé∂üéµüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I adore you Joshua for the cakes you make......keep on doing what you do...love it...just want more videos
Girl power - friendship forever \nGreat video üòÇ

The spice girl's singing was hilarious!!! Brandon is funny! Friendships never end!
I love when the others join in the video
Nice work making a cake i don't want to eat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean it looks nice but you put a spider on that cake then im not touching it
I subscribed for Brandon‚Äôs singing
I loved them for singing! Not a fan of spiders but the cake looks fine.
NO THAT SPIDER BETTER NOT EXIST NOPE NOPE NOPE
Thanks so much!!! You guys are so much fun !! üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª can you pls let me know the name of the spray you used to seal the spider?? \nCan't wait for more tips & tricks!!! üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº
Your shirt should have a cake with a huge knife/sword going through it with Raspberry jam oozing out of it
I am so in love with this cake!!
You and your crew are my favorite people
Helloüëç could you possibly do a Frankenstein cake?? And the original Frankenstein pleaseüòäüòä
Love your designs!  I took up baking cakes 2 months ago and found your channel.  I think I've seen all your MAC videos & this one has to be the best! I hate spiders but I so wanna recreate this cake myself. Thank you for all the inspirations! Go Team MAC!
Phantom of the Opera, clothing sucked but I'm proud of the makeup I did.
I HAVE ARACHNAPHOBIA WHO ELSE DOES
I'm sorry Josh, but i feel they should sing more
üòçüòç
Best Halloween costume: I was a gps
The spider looks almost like a jeweled pin.
When I was 11, I had two costumes.  One for the town Halloween parade and one for actual Halloween.  For the parade, I was a golf ball.  For Halloween, I was a munchkin.  Donut munchkin.
I absolutely love the crew! You guys rock! JJR you need to sing along man, singing good for the soul!!
People gold shame me all the time
I always like watching your videos. You make beautiful ckes
The bloopers and the singing kinda made this better... and that spider was awesome, this woukd an an awesome cake for someone getting married around Halloween ^_^.
This episode was hilarious! I feel your pain with that extruder that would make me crazy!! Lolllll. This cake is amazing! And yes I have a crazy fear of spiders but you made it look incredible! Great job as always!

This video is now my fave !! And not just for the cake or JJR, but come on!!! Guys who know and can sing the Spice Girls that well hahaha well done guys i love it!!!
Hey guys, does anybody know what's the name of the spray he used to glue together the spider?
you should collaborate with how to cake it
The intro is so litüí•
those are some great faces you made this episode
I want your shirt üòÇüòÅ

‚ÄúTem-plate‚Äù
2:31 meh hand
Little finger action?  That didn't sound right haha
I love Sean, but his knife technique is horrendous.
Mustangs didn‚Äôt exist until the end of 1964 nerd. No such thing as a ‚Äúround 1950‚Äôs mustang‚Äù.
He has so much pride about making sushi it‚Äôs very wholesome
Love sushi! Thanks Sean your videos are always making me hungry and teaching me simultaneously.
watch more great video on Indian cooking click photo
‚ÄúLike a 1950‚Äôs mustang‚Äù he says. Too bad they debuted in 1964üòëüòë
Next Hot ones we need Hot Ones: with ROADMAN SHAQ PLEASE LIKE THIS SO THEY CAN SEE IT
I'm going to pretend you meant a 50's P51 Mustang and not the car, seeing as how the fish on the rice kinda looks like the body of a P51!
You're such a good host
Can you invite Pewdiepie again?\nI know the first time you invited him! But he turned you down because he's busy!
What watch is that sean
Become a sushi chef in two months......... Lol
The mustang released in 1964 1/2. Damn Sean. Letting down the Midwest.
Hey Shawn hold the spine of the knife just above the handle with your thumb and for finger and wrap the rest around the handle  you will get better control of the knife
Mustangs fist got introduced in 1964 1/2 but I definitely knew what you meant üòÜ
Need hot sauce to eat it or what?
So we filleted our straight bass\nSean...it's striped bass.
So 1:30 in and already they are lying to me. That is not a a stripped bass. The lines are broken.
I want to eat sushi off of Sean, Fantano, and Binging with Babish's shiny bald heads.
0o0 when he chops the fishys head
When they're cutting near the beginning you can see how inexperienced he is just by his knife technique when cutting to the middle bone because he holds the knife with his finger on the blade.  Surprised the teacher didn't  point it out
I would be dope for them to have a video on traditional shojin ryori sushi.
Plot twist the Asian guy on the thumbnail is Sean.
I hope he meant p-51 mustangs, not Ford mustangs........
Ik he's not a car guy but a 1950's mustang is not a thing üòÇ mustangs became a car in 1964.5
Chef was a champ, seems like a cool dude
In school I used to always question why the things we were learning were relevant to our us. Now I willfully click on these kinds of videos...
The secret to good sushi is bad fish. C'mon, guys.
jheez that looks good
Hair net? What hair net?
aaaaaaah i need some sushi now
Sushi quality looks fetching terrible
That intro is what I like to call sushi porn
The justin Timberlake of food 
Sooo... There's an anime with this premise right?
It's still just a finesse game the chef is just moving forward...lmao I love Sean
Dude's such a sushi master that he has sponsor logos on his chef jacket
I feel like Sean Evans is so robotic and has no personality. He's like the Jason Bateman of interviewers
Gotta love those 1950's mustangs that came out in 1964 and 1/2.
as someone getting into blades and sharpening.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for a sushi chefs and how well they can sharpen their knives
Someone call Flava Flav Sean has the guy's clock on his wrist.
now kill a chicken next and make wings from scratch :)
that blonde girl... damn stole the show
There is not a 1950's Mustang. LOL
Sean's roll looked pretty dodge but I bet it still tasted nice as fuck!
Shawn Evans acts like a female.....jeeezzz
for some reason I've always thought Sean was a cook, turns out he can't fillet a fish LOL
I remember this dude from Ten Feet Tall. A true master
The entire time I just kept thinking I want to eat that entire slab of tuna.
What a brutal personality...just a terrible, terrible host.
Idk if I could dream up any sort of shittier hair line lmfao rip Sean
now that is a beautiful bit of tuna
This to me looks like a big piece of...tuna
Sean is really growing on me as a host. He should branch out more often. He might be a little generic at times, but he is genuine, and very well informed.
Watching Sean's knife grip had me cringing. Don't cut yourself!
A little finger action üòè
Sean's willingness to learn while asking questions is quite remarkable keep up the good work man.
why is he wearing a watch cutting fish
that is an art
at any culinary school or even trade school, you're only getting the basics. the rest is up to you.
Take off the watch smh
Sean, I love your videos, but your knife technique almost gave me a heart attack! Glad you didn't hurt yourself!

What I really like about this video is that, unlike Gordon Ramsay, the chef isn't blowing his lid because you didn't do it right. We need more chefs like this in the world.
1950's Mustang. Welp, I guess Sean isn't a car guy lol.
That‚Äôs some pretty massive rice 10^15 grams
The second two fingers is what takes the extra 1 1/2 months
That's way too much work for me to try at home Sean
If your taken the skin off the bass why in the hell are you taken the scales off? That's an unnecessary step in my book. I can clean a bass faster then that chef can. Been cleaning fish my whole life.
Woah this is a trip. I studied under Chef Andy Matsuda and graduated from SCI years ago. Hell yeah, Andy is an amazing instructor.
1:04 that's only four things.  Not five things.
Lol love it, 1950's mustang hahaha you killed it bro

sean is a genuinely cool guy
Great episode FWF that was impressive Sean. mad props. I would've have been eating the sushi..
I remember the douchbags from good mythical morning
Anyone else wanted them to eat it
should have gotten Dr Steve Brule to teach him
Stick to the wings
We only teach 5 things...  1. Sharpening knife  2. Cutting fish  3. Making rice  4. Rolling ... just 5 things!
I don't get all the hype over sushi.\nIt's literally just raw fish on rice.
The Chef sounds like Adam Sandler doing an Asian accent üòÉ
Great interview!
1960s* mustang, sean.
Hahahaha awesome.. tnx Sean this was entertaining :)
this was awesome!

That little stuffed rat was dark and feral

What's the song before I put a spell on you, at 9:51 ??
I laughed till I criiiiiiiied when you tried the masks on in the car! These vlogs are the BESSST!!
Hi Zoe! What car do you have? It‚Äôs so nice! Xx
I'd really crave a friendship like Mark's and yours omg, love you guys

You should look on party delights online they have brill halloween stuff!!!

Morrison‚Äôs must feel left out haha! And I NEED that creepy toy!
I wanted to make my Twitter name spoopy for Halloween since I've never done it before. But my Twitter name is Beeba K Smith. I thought of Boo at the beginning instead of Bee, then realised . . . Booba. Hi, I'm Booby, pleased to meet you XD
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE BIT AT 10:00 \n\nOmg it‚Äôs the best thing ever look at Zoe‚Äôs face !! üòÇ‚ú®

Are you making a Halloween haul of what you've brought? I hope so. Awesome
Anyone know where her black bag is from????xxx
I love how supportive Mark was being. I know having anxiety can make you freak out in situations like driving but he was so positive and was just bloody awesome :) Loving the vlogs recently !!!
little did she know that later on for their anniversary her sloth may not be enough üòÇ  (and that she was getting a new car!!!üòâ  )
Nooooo I wanted to see nala in the peacock costume

I seriously could watch a live stream of Zoe and Mark in the car. So funny. \n-Frey
zoella can you do a Halloween haul
Did nobody else notice the person that walked by on the right wearing a mask at 18:10!? üò≥üòÇ
What foundation and concealer does she use at the start pleaseee??
i don't understand how someone doesn't like this
Does anyone know what song was playing on the piano that Zoe said was her favourite ? X
Your videos always make so happy!! ü§ó
I really like your vlogs.They are never boring‚ù§ You inspire me so much
i love it when zoe and mark are laughing so hard that they do the same actions and laugh even more
Was laughing the whole time when you and Mark were in the car, felt like I was there with you. Love the banter x
These cold sunny autumnal mornings üòç I really like you with light makeup or without it üòä You and Mark are friendship goals!
The range and Morrisons are the best for haloween
Mark vlogs are the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love how this vlog started
Your vlogs always bright up my day. I had a really bad day today. And it‚Äôs only 11am. So thanks Zoe :)
It always makes me so happy to see that mark is in your vlog!
wow, did you chance anything in your skin care or how did your skin improve so much?? :)
I can't get over how good your makeup looks in this
You should do a haul to show us properly what you got and where you will use it
Did anyone else notice the black widow on Mark's shirt?? Wth üòÇ
Seriously your friendship with Mark is the best! You‚Äôre giggles and funny moments......You always act like you drunk üòÜüòÇüòÑü§£
mark in that baby mask going 'shhhhh' is sooooo creepy
I love all of your vlogs cause you're always on a great mood and you make me so happy‚ù§
Zoe your vlogs are some of the most relaxing things on the internet üòçüòä
Literally cry laughing at yours and mark's car banter hahahaha
Did anyone else think that Mark had a real spider on his Top üòÇNo just me,okay.üòÇ
I just love it when mark and Zoe makes videos together. They make me laugh so hard. Those two are so cute togheter‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Whenever I hear Zoe fake scream in horror, I immediately imagine her as a guest in supernatural either getting killed at the beginning or as a survivor.
This made me happy üòäüçÅüçÇ
That last mask had me laughing so hard üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Would love it if you could do an updated skincare routine (morning/evening)!!! Have a great day zoe!

Omg I love it when you and Mark are together, you have cheered me up immensely. Love both your vlogs so much and Alfie's, can't wait for vlogmas this year üéÑüéÖ
the song at 11.38 is Biffy Clyro - Many of horror (if anyone was wondering lol)
whats a jazz song?
what maaascaara is she using?
When Zoe eats it remind me of a lil rabbit eating it‚Äôs so cute!!!
To clarify: I never said I was definitely returning it (or the company took it back), I said we'll see if they let me! as a joke, knowing I've done a lot of stuff in it and also made a video documenting me doing those things, implying that they would definitely not let me return it. Sorry if that didn't come across or if anyone got confused! xox
Omg saf you should do a full face of wish makeup!
One of my favourite videos so far! Laughed so much Saf.
???? She goes to Disney in like every video????
I WAS HOPIN U WOULD SAY NUMBAH 3
oh she got moneyyyyyy. $700 just to spare on an ugly jacket
I love your shoes Where did you get them those white bootie heels are so stunning !
I LOVE HOW YOU ALWAYS DO A LITTLE HISTORY LESSON KEEP DOIN IT LOVE YA
Saf's dance moves!!
my own personal space designator.  I want one!
She had so many opportunities to say I've got something up my sleeve
This makes me think of Dopey the dwarf lol
Day 3 is the bestüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Lolol why does this video have a condom ad? üòÇ youtube thinks this jacket is gonna get you laid
I somehow knew that the blow up man would happen.üòÇ
There were many times throughout this video where I thought I would never be able to stop laughing ever
It's like a jean straight jacket. I kinda want to see you try to diy it.
You should do a romwe haul
oh my gosh!! I just came back from DIsneyLand an d I miss is already I went there yesterday
Love that you guys went to disney land!!!!!!!
The outfit that keeps on giving \nomg I'm done üòÇüòÇüíÄ
This is definitely one of the funniest videos I've watched from Safiya
This jacket was obviously made of slenderman , man he gets cold in the fall.
5:40 i was laughing my ass off
Y Project? More like WHY project
This has been my favorite video \nYou‚Äôre hilarious
NUMBER THREE FROM CODE NAME KIDS NEXT DOOR
you're the only youtube I trust to order from shien , please do a video on shien I really do not know if its safe or not.
This is your best video so far. I laughed too hard.
You could probably sell it to a fan haha, I'm sure there's someone who would buy it from you for at least several hundred since you did all this stuff in it
This video was hilarious!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Safiya you truly fucking know how to make content. Seriously this was such a bomb video out of a slender man jacket!!! I admire u
i cannot describe how strange it is to see Safia with an angry face at Sephora.
I actually like the jacket. Can't afford it though lol
You could have just bought 2 denim jackets, cut the arms of one and sew them on the other jacket if you love this look and don't have the funds haha
OMG the bit with the tube man was hysterical. Thanks for that.
+Safiya Nygaard What if u used a vacume inside the sleeves and pretended to be the teletubbies robot that has a vacume nose
Officially my fav saf video I actually laughed so hard!!!
Okay but how in the world do you justify SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS on a hideous jacket
when she stood in front of the floppy car guy i literally laughed out loud oh my god
I'm actually in love with this jacket when the sleeves are turned inside out
i love your videos so much
You should do the detachable jeans next!
DID YOU GO INSIDE MINISO??? SAF DID YOU???
Where did you get your jumpsuit? I love!!!
I kinda like it... But then I have a weird thing about clothes that make me feel small
Hey saf! I've watched all your videos cause you exactly like me Italian and crazy!  I wish my channel I just started could be as good as yours üò≠üò≠
And u always end up learning something from her videos. Somehow
Seeing Cristine wear it..and be ok with the jacket. I guess it cant be that bad, since the beauty geru of the year approves!
Please don‚Äôt return the jacket I see pure joy in your eyes when you‚Äôre dancing with that jacket on
This is your funniest video yet, I‚Äôm in tears üòÇ
Give her a like that was slot of money
when she blurred out her butt I started laughing so hard
I nearly died laughing when she was pretending to be the wacky waving flailing arm dude.
I took the jacket to see a friend Saf your sense of humour makes me die laughing every time
I feel like the people who made this just used leg parts of jeans and put a like jacket on it
I played the part when you say I took it to see a friend ten times.. LMAO !!!!!!!!! XD
im not gonna lie i actually kind of dig it
You should do a video where you pick out clothes based on your zodiac sign aesthetic
WAIT OMG U WERE AT THE AMERICANA!?
Just cut  the sleeves until they fit üòí
Saf, I would recommend writing the brand and asking for the jacket. You are an influencer after all!
safiya will never fail to be original üëåüèΩ
Looks like the ugliest shoes as well
You should do a week of trying the monq aromatherapy pens.
You Safiya, have done it all üòÇ the jacket and the way you styled it was actually quite good!üëèüèΩ
Hey saf can you please please please please pretty peter pettigrew please show all your Harry Potter merch or a Harry Potter themed video! Love ya üëì‚ö°Ô∏èüîÆ
This jacket is hilarious, I laughed so much in this video
As a short person,every jacket feels like this on me
You should cut the excess off so you can get your 700 dollars worth üòÇüòÇ
I don't need a $700 jacket. I can get this exact satisfaction from wearing my husband's jackets
Her jacket would also be good for swatting fliesüòÇ
Favorite video so far!!! You‚Äôre so funny !
So I'm only 5ft tall, would the sleeves drag along the ground? LMFAO!!!!
Casually goes to Disney land in a $700 denim jacket
I'm 5ft. This is me in every jacket.
I love that she wore it to the streamy's üòÇ
This is like a modern version of Mulans dress in the beginning of the movie
Next on saf: so the let me return it..... now it‚Äôs $900 cuz my scent is on it and they found my channel so....
This was fascinating
üòÇ
Do the fried chicken pants
Slenderman would definitely love this üòÇüòÅ
My name is Maybel
Forever 21 X Taco Bell please

AAAAAAAA CRISTINE AND BEN
I'm literally cracking up at the inflatable noodle arm dude part omg
youd make a great inflatable tube guy
Oh, god. I love ya, Saf. üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Simeons place in GTA 5 üëÄ
9:58 she blurred her buttüòÇ
The video was very entertaining, but isn't it kind of nasty to even try to return it when you've got pizza oil, amusement park ride water, and all kind of stuff on it already? The money you made with the views of this video should more than compensate that money, and I just think it's a little less than graceful
That smile when the default essential phone video is an MKBHD video. üòú
Man google products are f-ugly, damn !! Pixel 2 looks like a noname $100 phone ü§¢

Mkbhd thoughts on the flexible phone by Samsung. Samsung Galaxy X?
Playing your own video via Google home was so meta..... and badass.

Hey do you think the pixel and Google are ushering in a new era for android?
I swear, this guy is like a great teacher teaching all the important detail about these tech products.
It's time to stop saying 'OK Google' in your Google Home related videos, have to mute my mic every time lol.
Definitely getting a few for the house
This is the most entertaining tech review I've seen in a long time. ¬†Thanks! ¬†You're the man!
Can u make vlogs if u get the chance
Could you review the new Lenovo Yoga 920?
i'd buy one today if it had an audio output.
I'm really considering getting this maybe I'll gift it for someone if I find it useless
I've just moved house to a place with some awesome scenery, I love talking photos but only use my phone. I'm on a cheap budget to buy a camera ( $440 ) so do you or anyone reading this comment know a good camera I could get?
Hey Guys I'm Just Starting out my youtube venture a little bit of love would be appreciated... Like and subscribe to my channel and i would do the same for you... also like this comment..Thanks and have a great day!!!
My Google home can't find my phone!!!! She says that she doesn't understand, is this a new feature on the mini one?
Even if they'd give them away for free, I wouldn't want one. It's bad enough, that google knows everything I do online - it really doesn't need to listen to everything I do offline ;)
This is sweet, unbelievable for ¬£50
Can you connect it to a sonos play 1?
This is a cool device. Except for its fabric top. A surface that is designed for tap/touch will soon get dirty and the grunge buildup will not be easy to wipe clean.
What‚Äôs the point of this if your phone can do all the same commands?
I wonder what will happen if you ask whether it can lie or not (or just straight up ask it to tell you a lie).
Dude, my Home sent me away from your video when you asked it to show Essential Phone Videos!
umm.. isn't the trigger Ok Google..? Since when did it start responding to Hey Google..? Did Google assistant and Siri have a child..? lol..
Horrible sound!
LG v30 review coming?
Essential phone reviews.... LOL
Rhetoric limit badly truth die starter legitimate resolve responsibility complex.
Will we be able to do phone calls with bluetooth?
Google home mini vs Echo dot! Do
Anyone know what his ringtone was?
Have you noticed the ghost touch events that some other reviewer noticed causing the device to record everything it hears
Sharks have been on the earth for 420 million years. Coincidence?
I'll just wait for Apple's Homepod
Oh yeah I'm totally getting this
the intro sounds wasn't cool as previous
I have a AMAZON Alexa dot, who wants to trade with me for a Google Home Mini ?
Did I hear you say ‚Äúyo‚Äù
Do you have any privacy concerns?
MKBHD talking a bunch of specs, sees us dumb folk not understanding a thing and he's like: It's basically the size of a donut. \nUS: OOoohh, I know how what a donut look like.
What, a Marques Brownlee where he didn't complaint about the lack of 3.5mm audio jack? Is this real?
This video has triggered every possible response on my Google Home :)
Do you recommend buying the Surface Laptop?
or you could just get an echo dot, all problems solved
The new and improved SpyBastard mini
that like to dislike ratio tho
Yep, it's a thing I would like, but I don't need. We have a ChromeCast and a bunch of Android phones and tablets but we never OK Google them. (perhaps only my watch when i'm driving) For $70AU or so it's something to put on the Christmas wishlist!
I have Alexa, still not convinced about smart home just yet, much like VR it's still missing that killer 1 thing.
I still don't really know what the benefit of owning this device would be. Anybody own this or the bigger Home? If so how do you use it or for what purposes? (Practical usage)
This guy so rich he has his own damn studio
Basically it's for the lonely guys.. ü§î
What the name of your music
Can u do Alexa  google comparison
MKBHD and Casey Neistat are my go-tos for tech reviews.
Does Google home do advertising? I heard a story about a someone with Google home and then randomly stated there was beauty and the beast playing at the theatre.\n\nDoes it still does something like that now, and if it does, can it be turned off?
Could you do a review on Android's Moto X4 phone, please?
What's with the moustache üòú ?
There's no point in USB C for this product.  Once you plug it in you won't be unplugging it.  And at this time USB C is very expensive for manufacturers.  This costs $49 but if it were USB C it might cost close to $70.  Good choice going micro.
Was gonna get one but if it can't output to better speakers, it basically becomes a googling pebble and nothing more. Best pet rock ever tho.
Oh no....if you mute it with your voice you have to hit the switch a massive.....2 times...calm down guy it's a $50 toy.
Does the Home or mini support mute for X number of seconds?
The two switches room example.üòÄ
EF 11-24mm f/4 cap

sick intro
Noice!
I was about to buy it until you mentioned it doesn't have a headphone jack (For plugging in my own speakers)
Please could you do an update on the RED Hydrogen smartphone as we still have no idea on the release/ announcement date or a solid prototype etc. You're the only real you tuber thats covered it.
Would it pair with an iPhone 6? Like can I play Spotify with it or say, ok google, what's the weather today?
I do not give a shit about most of the products you are reviewing but still watching cause you are a cool dude.
Is it wireless????
So it's an echo dot just with less features
Does anyone know a Cinema Set or just a (micro) stereo set which allows:\n- Audio input from Audio jack (from monitor or tv) & Audio input from bluetooth (from phone)\n- AT THE SAME TIME\n\n250-350 Euro/Dollar\ntyvm!
What I love from this review it show the flaw. Hey no product is perfect
So crispy!!!!!
who is a bot ?????
I swear every time I watch a Google Assistant MKBHD video I have to mute my Google home. It's an unpleasant experience. Lol
No, I choose Mi AI Speaker
You will plug it once and forget about it. I feel you cry about USB port just to have something to cry about..
I want the charcoal mini, and the max to play some good music to
You haven't talked about your Tesla in awhile. You still have it right?
yes

Man. I love this channel, but the troop of turds lead by their cocks crying when Jessica isn‚Äôt on makes me queasy.
Maybe this mineral planet is rich with Kyber crystals
Kylo Rey will be the ultimate evil of EP IX xD
What about fin?ü§îhe was in the trailer
damn i know you warned me but why would they put so many spoilers in the god damn trailer
Jessica is moving away from nerdist news and nerdist live the same way Dan Casey has done
I was hoping you would explain what Luke was afraid from.
I dont like her voice sorry i found it hard to hear she spoke to quick
The death of the son of Luke will be justice against emos and Millenials.
Rey  is on the darkside suck it women
Her voice. I dunno. Something... odd. Out of place. Nervousness? Can't keep it outta my head, while watching the vid.
I want Luke to whoop ass.Just a little bit.
Ben is making friends.
When do the Porg sex dolls come out?\n\nerr.  I mean.  Toys.
Fuck Jessica\nShe's a thot
I am hyped for Carrie Fisher but it‚Äôs going to break my heart, and I want a nude scene with Poe and Finn... but that‚Äôs just me...
Amazing, Amy did great, even she has the same gesture of putting the arms behind her back!! üòç In general she's more cute and Jess more spicy, but anyway, good job!! üòä
is it just me or thi Amy Vorpahl is just too hot!! damn
Bb8 getting zapped from the back of Poe‚Äôs Tie Fighter, a nod to R2D2 getting zapped on the back of Luke‚Äôs Tie Fighter in Star Wars A New Hope???
#TeamCrystalFox If they're running into the base it's clear they've been domesticated and are being used somehow by the Resistance. For who knows what but they're cool!
Amy, dunno what you did with you hair but it worked. You looking damn fine.
I wonder is Rey was created by Snoke a'la Darth Plagueis with the purpose of mating with Kylo to give rise to the ultimate Force child?
Balanced Jedi are those who rely on the Light side of the Force. Anakin brought balance (restored the natural balance) by destroying the Avatar of the Dark side, Sidious. The Gray was never canon.
I didn't miss shit!
the scene between Brienne of Tarth I mean... Phasma and Finn is reminicent of the Revenge of the sith  cover with Anakin striking Obi-wan with his lightsaber inside Darth Vader's face
#teamporg but where is my girl Jessica!?
Porgs and Star Wars fans are words that will never go in a sentence together. EVER.
Basically its all white males are now bad.... You know, the majority of the USA... Now has to sit back and let 'minorities' take over to become 'equal' WHEN they wont show the same in countries they come from.... Thats how pathetic people are. Wont help each other in their own country BUT make white people PAY for their 3rd world country immigrants that want free stuff and to blame everyone else for their mistakes in life...... How pathetic.
How did the star go from being cute to unattractive in just 18 months
Jesus! Fuck! What is it with her eyes?
She reminds me a lot of Pearl from Steven Universe.
But what about Luke being placed on the back of the poster? Like all antagonists have been in the posters as far as I know.
Nothing about Phasma and Fin, but all about the Porgs? Are you taking Star Wars not serious? :)
#teamporg\nI hope I don't wind up regretting that.
The fact that they remembered the blast mark is amazing. So much attention to detail.
Where the hell is Chobot?
that prog is going to be annoying
spoiler warning after playing parts from the trailer. im sure anyone who want avoiding spoilers would not have click this any way. but still you made a shitty warning
Got to love myself a little Porg
I agree with Mark Hamill: They have totally fucked up Luke's character,and this trailer seems to be more evidence of that.  Also, they should retitle this Episode 8: Return of the Mary Sue
Chewie is a legend!! where does he fit in all this? are R2 and 3PO going to continue on their dumbass adventures? what about BB8 and the new evil BB9??? also, Phasma..... how sick does she look?!
Great breakdown because you added bits of info you know as a fan already knolagble about the Last Jedi
Je--Jessica? Is that... you? Wow. Star Wars has changed you
What's with Rey's white lightsaber or am I seeing things?
Loving that Vault-Tec top!!
I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\n\nMaybe when Luke says: ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt going to go the way you think‚Äù he‚Äôs either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\n\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey‚Äôs power while ‚Äòtraining‚Äô her with torture or whatever, and with the ‚Äúsomething truly special‚Äù he‚Äôs recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And ‚Äúfulfill your destiny‚Äù is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn‚Äôt kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he‚Äôs commanding her to do it now. \n\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him ‚Äúkill the past‚Äù after their familial relation (and her ‚Äòsuperior‚Äô bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that‚Äôs why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt going to go the way Snoke thinks‚Äù...maybe she‚Äôs so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‚Äòdie‚Äô that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we‚Äôve never seen. *excited face*
I'm on team Amy.
NERDGASM FOR THE CRYSTAL FOX!!!!!!!
I miss jessica\n\n
this trailer was the final piece that convinced me: star wars is DEAD.
Could Snoke's torturing of Rey be a force dream and not real?
Some of you guys give nerds a bad name. \nWhat does it matter who is presenting? It's the content I'm here for!
Love the trailer, but I hope it's full to the brim of misdirection like the Rogue One trailers. All I'm going to take from this is that it looks COOL!!!!!
Holy shit the blatant disconcerting reading-face she's doing is the most distracting thing I've seen in weeks, and the fact that you had to KEEP CUTTING TO HER RANDOMLY forced me to keep most of the video off the screen at all times because seeing her leaning forward staring at the cue cards/prompter made every word she said turn into those sounds adults made on Peanuts cartoons.\n\nIf you have to bring someone on that can't read without leaning in and making it obvious, at least don't cut to her at random frequent intervals so it's less of a distraction.
A bit dumb and logic jumpy. I think after that scene with the ships giant robot elephants warp in shooting nuclear bananas.... Could happen!
We are the Porg. Resistance is futile.
Jessica looks different
# Team pork deffinetly
Hate the Porg, super gross CGI!
- Hey Porg!\n- What?\n- Fuck you.

It's pronounced AHK-TOE. That drove me nuts the whole time I was watching. Jessica would say it right #TrueFan
Who the fuck is this?
Jessica? üò¢
Bring back jessica
I liked the part where Kylo Ren tells Rey, Wow you are The Last Jedi. Sorry I killed your dad, Luke Skywalker.
I looked up that thing on Kylo Ren's face. It's a skin bandage. It's applied over the scar, keeps the skin together, so the scar can heal. It's a futuristic band aid, basically. He pulls it off later, and you can see the scar healed in the last frame of the trailer. It's not under his skin or flesh. So relax! I hope that helps.
Kylo's scar is awesome. I think of it as part of this recurring thing where being sith = becoming a cyborg. But he's this kinda young modern sith with nice hair so instead of getting an iron lung suit or robot spider legs he's got this kind of low-key brillo-patch on his ronin face cut.
Wonder what Andy made her do to get her show. Didn't like it I guess with a lot of other people no season 2. Don't like her condescending attitude
BB-9e will most likely be in the actual movie this time due to how much they have promoted him outside of the toy market, including animated shorts.
Can you hold up the porg next to your face, there's a similarity!\n\nI thought that Kylo was just wearing a sticky plaster with little TIE fighters on it.
Is comedic genius in your genes? You never fail to crack me up, and I'm as cynical as it gets. You rock, Jenny.
This was the worst Last Jedi trailer reaction, which makes it...Awesome. You rock Jenny!
She reminds me of the babysitter from The Incredibles.
The black thing on the scar is probably a way to heal it.\n\nHe will probzmably wear it only in the beginning of the movie
AT-ST!\nAT-ST!\nAT-ST!\nAT-ST!\nAT-ST!\n\nIT BROKE NEW GROUND!!!!!
0:30 A teen's first attempt at finding the g-spot.
What do you mean no reactions anymore to new Star Wars trailers!! ü§î ... Another 2 months ü§£ ... and then ... üé´üòÇ
Noticed how Rey looks so awkward swinging a lightsaber! I think a lightsaber has no weight, they probably realized this w the originals and created that ball to shoot lasers at Luke so he wouldn‚Äôt look retarded.
I think it's a dark side band aid.
You guys know that carbon fibre was over his scar right? It's not prosthetic, it's probably a band-aid. you can see scenes with just a scar on his face in the same trailer.
Why were you fondling poor Porgs eyes while watching it!!!
Only channel that makes sense to me xP
She needs long black pipe
Jenny: ‚ÄúAll of this stuff is obsolete. Why did I buy any of this?!‚Äù\nMe: Because your a fan, and a nerd. Doesn‚Äôt matter which you are, because the good ones always support the stuff they like. And you are clearly doing that.
I like how she obsessed over a tiny detail no one else noticed.
Kylo's face mesh is gone at the end of the trailer, So it was either for healing or it was a piece of flare he was wearing to feel tough.
Is it me or does Jenny keep getting more beautiful? Anyway, great video. The commentary was on point.
Oh wtf, haven't watched in a while.\nShe blew up!
I thought the mesh on Kylo Ren's face was more of like a bandaid that covers the burn until it's healed, then it's removed. Not stuck under the scar.
So, there's no reason my name should have been on the special thanks list but I was disappointed when it wasn't there....why Jenny WHY?!?!
i saw the scar as more of a band aid, not a underneath prosthetic...
this girl is a real girl
I think I love you
I must ask: do you strategically place those stuffed animals on your bed before shooting videos or do you sleep surrounded by multiple fluffy items?
I want Jenny to massage my head like she massaged that porg. But no sticking fingers in my eyes. I think Jenny has nails and that looks painful.
Love how you sat there rubbing the porgs eye üòÇüòÇ
This chick gets it. Thumbs up.
Kylo literally looks like he's got a zipper on his face...
Best trailer review of all time
wow, first video I've seen of yours where you actually came across as optimistic and positive
He got his synth skin at the Emperor Palpatine Surgical Reconstruction Center‚Ñ¢
Dang it Jenny, you had to point out that Poe is on the bad guy side and now that's gonna bother me until December!!!!!!
I have no idea who you are, nor do I care too.
One who kills Han Solo can NEVER be redeemed!
I think Kylo's face is just bandaged... take a closer look.
All reaction videos fall short of the original two girls one cup.
The trailer reminded me of a fan film.
Pliff the Hoojib is actually Porg. I don't know about Snoke.
It looks like a space bandage- he took a light saber to the face so maybe it's some burn dressing that he has on for only part of the movie.
It's a Band-Aid, only with an edgy look because he's so emo. It's not under the skin.
I totally freaked out during this trailer for real! Hey I mean no offense toward you but by golly there is no need to criticize people for having reactions to things that are more exciting than others... it's fine if you don't but some people feel so connected to this story that they just flip out and believe me it's real for people! I'm one of them! I love Star Wars what ya gonna do?! Don't be pretentious about your boring reaction please all peeps are differentüê¢
I don't understand the issues with Snoke's appearance.
But Jenny you said it would be today as in before yesterday. :/
I was going to say something but then I forgot I was going to say?
I wish I was a pretty anime fox :'(
Honestly, Kylo Ren is the least interesting villain to me. He'll probably have some deep complex story arc. It's been done too many times before. The actor isnt convincing which certainly doesn't help. :/
Are the reactions fake cuz they're faking enthusiasm or cuz they look like they're watching it a second time, cuz I agree with the former ...
You should check out Adam does movies. He does a show called trailer trash that reminded me of this.
but the question i have, is that luke's hand from return of the jedi?
Mark Hamill ended up with a messed up face in the 70s and they managed to patch him back up without using a mess. I think Kylo wanted the mesh because he was so hungry for attention and sympathy.
Cute video....I laughed many times. Jenny is trying to seduce me to the light side. Sorry, no can do.
It's me, I'm a pretty anime fox hahaha I too want those foxes wth
Cracking bint! But here's something else funny I only noticed today... 7:01 Hahahahaha!\n\nLike when you spot it. 99% can't be far off ;-)
not gonna lie i thought the mesh skin was just a big bandage
S rank reaction right here.
You're right that Kylo Ren doesn't have that face mesh scar thing at the end, but my guess is that it's because that's some sort of vision sequence for Rey, like when Luke had that dream battle with Vader in the original trilogy.  So he may just permanently have creepy scar face.
I think it‚Äôs just tape like a bandage
Facially expressive reactions are lame. I maintain a poker face at all times under all circumstances. Except when pizza is being consumed, but what kind of weirdo doesn't piegasm?
2:50 wow. did not think she was going to say fox.
The only The Last Jedi Trailer Reaction comment you need:\n\nTrailer reactions are silly, you guys.
Hell yeah, are you pioneering authenticity coming to youtube?
It's hard to believe some people actually do gasp and laugh when they watch trailers. If you want to see a fake reaction go watch Angry Joe.
I'm not excited about this movie. Mark Hamill seems to be on an apology tour where he's sort of not decided whether he's saying it flat out is terrible or just trying to brace people for the impact.\nIt seems like they're just copy and pasting all the old Star Wars stuff and covering it up by making everything more intense and hyper dramatic and then appealing to a younger audience by making all these weird over the top silly, nerdy things so they can relate to it.\nThe prequels weren't great but they at least told their own story.\nI think if they really wanted to make a great film they would have done something different than the galaxy is at risk from evil thing.\nThe video game industry seems to be doing a much better job at capturing the essence of Star Wars and introducing new elements to the universe without breaking the cool factor of the universe.\nThere was a ton of cannon to draw from that made the story interesting that they could have drawn from that would have made a solid story without having to just appeal to movie goers and the younger gen.\nStar Wars when done well speaks for itself and doesn't have to cater to anyone and when you have a guaranteed blockbuster and you can do it well then why not do it well instead of catering to a certain expectation of what it should be.
I really liked the trailer. I do have worries this will be a repeat of The Empire Strikes Back. I was ok with that being the case for TFA, but to do the same thing again...
Two videos in a week sure is a treat
What am I supposed to feel after watching someone react to something else??? I'm Ray and you just read a comment brought to you by ROFL with Ray.
People buying into the merchandise before you know the quality of the film=part of the problem.
The actress is dead so they have to write Leia out of the script. So yeah, he's going to do it lol.
There‚Äôs a bandaid on kylo‚Äôs face. It‚Äôs not metal
I feel Rey will turn to the Dark Side
Dec 16: Jenny uploads a new vid about how awful the last jedi is, despite glowing reviews and positive fan feedback.
I love the little porg >\\\<
I swear to god this is my favorite reaction video ever just by virtue of the fact that it takes down reaction videos as the silly nonsense that they are.
I gasped when the shot changed in this video 6:44
It's gonna be great.
Snoke looks like Goldmember. Are we sure Mike Myers isn't playing him?
God you're obnoxious
jenny your fricking amazing :)
6:57
Man, the quirky dorkiness is so adorable.
Dang Jenny‚Äôs trending. Baller
r u hooking up with Tony Revolori?
I laughed because I think Snoke looks funny
Great reaction, subscribed.
ayy my boi jenny made it on trending yooooooooo congrats yeet lmao
How come I never have nice ladies like you who enjoy Star Wars in my life?  LOL
It‚Äôs just a band aid for goodness sake.
For Christ's sake... we don't care what Kylo's face look like... it must be a girl thing...
Complaining is boring. Bye...
I think the point of the mesh on is face, is for it to be horrifying, he is a villain after all lol.
omg you¬† are annoying
That last shot of Kylo, the scar is all closed up.
I feel like I'm the only person to just say meh to the recent trailer lol
Why is this on trending?
PLEASE vote for Lindsey Stirling on Dancing with the Stars she is currently competing and is doing well but she still needs our  votes! <3 <3 <3
YAASS GIRL!!
Finally, something on trending that is actually worth watching. üëåüèª
Thank You So Very Much For Sharing This Song. I LOVE IT. God Bless You and Yours Always! SHALOM
i wanna see more video game covers
Can you play the song of never forget you
You just are perfect package.. üòç
Wow! Thats plucking was FAST and what a cool song!
Been around since 10k subs, love this woman but this is just boring, too much going into the videos now rather than the music. Seems it's just a dancing with the stars promo.
Love the golden makeup and dress. Nailed it!
Good try with Indian..... But barely replicates indian music or environment...... But love the music
Shame Raja wasn't featured but I love the blond hair and makeup.
Lindsey you are the mother of violin
Her videos are always just so aesthetically and technically pleasing. Dance for days ‚ù§‚ù§
This is cultural appropriation.
Lindsey you are the best, with love from Russia
YOU ARE SO CLOSE TO 10 MILLION!!!
That's so far the best music video from the Brave Enough era. I like it, but still hoping in The Phoenix video, Lindsey, you can't miss it!
She is really thin I hope she is ok
WOW! Amazing love it all this should hit an easily 1M likes :D
Beautiful  great song and big artist
I miss her red hair.
I'm glad this was released on my birthday üò≠‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
You new thing is samely nice- over recanes!‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ:-)))
This is art. That was beautiful...
Could you do the Star Trek Discovery theme with Hollens? That would be amazing!
@Lindsey Awesome vid! Please make one about the tri-factor of health, ecology and ethical aspects, perhaps in the spirit of your great *Elements* music vid - for more info, please check out: https://youtu.be/lw3HE_UtJ1k
IM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF THATS LINDSAY'S VOICE OR SOMEONE ELSES
Neat. I like it.
I don't know why, Lindsey, but your music was squeezing me and I got tearful. üíóüíß
you are awesome, but Lindsey did you lose weight? You need to eat more, i can see your bones .
More impressed by her dancing. Way she moves.
I love the costumes and music
Awesome as always ..always love Lindsey's performances she's so amazing an this video was amazing üòúüòúüòç
I‚Äôve been waiting to see what music video she‚Äôd make for this song and it‚Äôs by far the most beautiful and amazing video she‚Äôs ever made love you Lindsey!!üíï
she dances really well. good job
this woman is amazing,wonderful
How can anyone be so talented üëèüëè..............\nEdit: can I pls got  pinned.....I never got pinned.......pls...pls
Lindsey Stirling is waaaaay better than Jake or Logan Paul! Lindsey Stirling is a role model in my eyes and is inspirational to me, thank you for being a role model to me Lindsey Stirling, btw keep up the awesome work
i know that the song is indian themed or something, but i kept hearing kpop.........and i'm not even a kpop fan xD
I think Lindsey did an excellent job in showing the Indian culture without relying on religious symbols which of course go counter to her own beliefs.  I have to say though that her stripe down her face look made me think it would fit in with the Star Wars universe. ;P
The only one& the best <3
a beautiful song or artist
Of all the songs on Brave Enough, this is the one I was most interested in seeing the video for.  I was not disappointed.  You're visions are just amazing.
I'm obsessed with this it's so good
What fun! Love it!!
I like it she's pretty and like that she can and play at the time
Her musicstyle has changed drastically but it is still good as anyways
Bollywood needs to do better.(¬∞‚óá¬∞;)
I like the vibe of this, she's so talented‚ù§

Will never look at my sign the same way again.
I am neither  not citizen of nor resident in the UK, but I'm willing to move just to help the cause
Not cool changing the sign like that just for a video. Someone could have gotten into an accident. I'm flagging this video for dangerous acts.
There are enough views on this video for the bar to be full of petitions but some people are just too lazy
Looks like we have ourselves a case of Parker Football geometry
Not something very important to be done in my opinion
I started thinking that this was a triviality. But you convinced me that it might help with math awareness and costs little.  Alas, am a landlocked USian without British acquaintances. But I liked your video. Good luck.
If the petition gets 100,000 it will be considered for debate in parliament
Is it just him or that how people in Britain pronounce hexagon and pentagon?
UK government be like\n\n\nWho's this hate letter from\n\nIt's the same guy as last week\n\nOhh now it's footballs ant it??\n\nYep\n\nWell,,,,,, just walks away angry
It looks like a circle of someone's bathroom tiles
That's a Parker football.
3:40  ...and a very proud tradition in mathematics....   Gotcha!  I knew one day your maths would slip and you'd realize the truth of the Yankee way!  Mathematics FTW!
Man! I don't live in the UK....
I thought this was going to be about directing traffic through a deliberately convoluted route to control traffic flow, but this was a nice surprise
I guess this is why democracy matters.
Perhaps they don't match because they are trying to represent a 3D shape in 2 dimensions? I imagine that if you take a 2D image of the correct shape you describe, it's not actually going to improve the level of recognition that is important for signage
This guy needs to get a life... I‚Äôm sorry but he just does
Signed... Let's push for 100k to be considered for debate in parliament...
he‚Äôs like that one maths teacher that you have in school that tries to make maths relevant in real life but it‚Äôs just bullshit anyway
*DON'T  YOU  HAVE  SOMETHING  ELSE  TO  DO??*
Almost 15k signatures so far. Wouldn't it be awesome to get to 100k so they have to bring it up in parliament
I saw this at the show in Warwick on Friday! Hope it gets to 10k
Who gives a s**t?
Could the ball have hexagons on one side (visible in the sign), and other polygons on the other side, and still be a ball?\n Instinctively I sense no, but can we prove that it is not possible?
I really hope they waste lots of money replacing all those signs. Nothing better to spend it on, well done, we need more like you üëç
I‚Äôm more concerned about the colour of the balls. The light hexagons are greater in number projecting white privilege.
The fact that nearly 15,000 people have gone out of their way to change road signs makes me proud to be British xD
African kid: mudda please can i have some water\nAfrican mom:no my child because there are hexagons not pentagons on football signs\nAfrican kid:Muddah i am so so sorrreeee i had no idea
When I lived in the UK I always appreciated the accurate graphics on the road signs, you always knew when you were coming up on a man shaking out an umbrella.
As important as the change in road sign is, my first thought was that they've finally finished that bloody bus lane!
That's not even a football! A real football is a prolate spheroid, usually colored (or coloured) brown. What you're talking about is a soccer ball.
I‚Äôm from the US but you best know I still signed this
Something similar happened at the company I work for.  We make geographic information systems so marketing asked a graphic designer to put a globe in some of our marketing material.  It was a complete mess and would have been an embarrassment if any geography nerds (As in a significant portion of our customers and potential hires) had seen it.  Thankfully some of us outside marketing got to see it early enough to fix it and the globe ended up being drawn correctly.
You have to much time on your hands mate
Please sign our petition to put pentagrams on road signs!\nThank you.\n‚Äî Devil worshippers of Britain
A well run democracy depends on public participation. Nothing is so small that it should not be fixed.
This level of extra is refreshing :')
So you've basically made football to do with maths.
For one very narrow definition of better. XD
Signed, at the moment there are over 14k signatures
And i thought people could not get any more obsessed with soccor \nUgh I hate soccor so boring \nI prefer motocross or skateboarding or any other exetreme sport
Why don't you call it a Parker sign if it's wrong
I'm a Yank, so I can't sign the petition. Great video and I hope that your petition is a success.
Someone needs to start a petition to change the ¬£20 note to a ¬£25 note. That way it will be a perfect log scale.
I'm not a british citizen. I'm french. f*** it !
If there are fewer accidents caused by mathematicians cringing at the mathematically impossible soccer decals, that counts as making life better...
I've always suspected the government didn't obey laws...
one i find this a bit too picky like i have always been in the uk and 17 years so far and i don't care if the sign of a football is a bit wrong like really man stop beening so picky so yeah like he says in the video to me its unlikely to put money towards something so stupid like who does that its not 100% art is it, its not like you have to look deeper in the meaning of this football image lol
This is a fucking joke I think there‚Äôs better stuff we could spend road tax on thank making signs geometrically correct
Considering where he was, I'm stunned the locals didn't run off with his GoPro
How many millions will this cost to fix haha
I can just imagine all the maths teachers who work near football grounds wanting to cry every morning as they pass these signs
Ngl there are more important things to spend money on. The uk spend millions on the signs and fixing it will just waste more money. Go bed
Now, granted I'm American, so my opinion doesn't matter in this instance, but are you certain you want to start the government debating the relative merits of different projections? Because, while it may be impossible to tessellate a spheroid using only hexagons, it's equally impossible to tessellate a plane using a pattern of hexagons and pentagons in any way similar to a truncated icosahedron. Your football signs are going to end up with problems equivalent to the horrible compromises of the Mercator or the Boggs eumorphic global map projections. (In deference to the UK subject matter (and the fact that I hate American football), I have chosen to use the European name for the sport, in spite of my own country of residence.)
Who said British people only drink tea?
Excellent!  I am all on Your side. By the way: the Logo for the Champions League is also a mess regarding geometry.
Government will respond - let's get it to 100,000 so we can maybe be treated to the spectacle of some MPs not understanding geometry.
The NHS is a bigger funding priority than replacing all the brown signs for football facilities, and somehow I expect the appropriate gov.uk division would find a way to make a symbol redesign cost tens/hundreds of thousands.
Parker square? more like Parker pentagons. except this time you are actually correct!
Yes I'd noticed this.¬† Yes I'll sign.¬†¬† Thank you for being the one to do something about it.
As a math enthusiast this bugs me. But being a US citizen I can't do anything. I don't know anyone that is British.
lost it at lovecraftian monster from beyond our perception
SPEND TAXPAYER MONEY ON MAKING FOOTBALL SIGN LOOK BETTER!!!! BRILLIANT PLAN
I have no problem with the change if you will pay for it.
Waste of money, but interesting video
It's gon, not gin\nHexa GON\nPenta GON\n\nNOT gin. I thought you were Australian
Well, they are technically correct: the football is printed on a flat street sign, after all.
Great way of spending tax payers money, redesigning a road sign
Is this a parody, or is he just a bit of a melt ?
If this is all you have to worry about in life, then you need a life.
omg it still looks like a football why does it matter its not like people mistake it for something else
Please tell me this is some kind of joke?
Guys! Go for 100,000 signatures and they might debate the problem in the parliament!
Need to get Ed Balls on the case.
Just change them to a rugby as punishment üòú üèâ
Is this a joke?
I always noticed something was wrong with that football image. But then I don't like watching football so not too bothered that football fans are being hoodwinked as they are being hoodwinked by the FA and Sky anyway
Anyone in the world can sign if you use your noggin. #Brexagon
Realistically it‚Äôs not a big deal we know what a football looks like as long as it represents that and people can understand that that‚Äôs all that matters just a waste of money to change signs to be geometrically correct when we‚Äôve got bigger worries in the UK
you only see the front of the football, not the back, so how do you know that the back is made up of different shapes than the front ?
Well over 10,000 now, so response guaranteed. Would love to see it discussed in Parliament - only 86000 to go!
i think this is very important and funny
They really ballsed it up! \n\n...and I've signed the petition.
Also the ball is not in proper 3d
You're at 15k. Congrats.

That face Steven makes when Adam feeds him. He looks like he can barely keep it together he's so happy omg haha
andrew is right, if you don't eat stack down you're doing it wrong
Need to do a worth it episode on haggis
8:50 there's a bunny in the store
Man, I've always said while watching these that I would NEVER fork up the cash for the most high-priced choice, that no one meal (except maybe your last) would be worth that much money.  I think this video changed my mind, though.  LAMB PASTRAMI.  CRAB CLAWS.  LOBSTER FREAKING WAFFLES.  Holy gods.  Also, that was the *best* Adam-smile in the world when he got the gigantic pancake pizza; he is adorable when he smiles.
when you have to say in a good way its never a good way
it's like baby thighs....so soft and squishyüåö
adam is the real star of this show
Is it me, or are we learning more and more about Adams personality!!! He seems really comfortable around the cameras now. (: Love the show.
They love each other so much now.
Andrew: Thank you for dressing up for once üòÇ
PLEASE DO ONE ABOUT COFFEE. I NEED TO KNOW.
Andrew: a combination of breakfast and dinner is called binner. Yeah I'm pretty sure that's called lunch üòÇüòÇ
When he bites into the doughnut he looks like such a child
Can we swap out andrew for one of the worth it lifestyle people?
This is steven's dream
These shows always make me so jealous of america :( i dont have cheap food in my country fml
lol I've never seen Adam so happy as when he saw the pancake pizza ü§£
‚ÄúYou need to dip the taco....in the queso‚Äù I have a feeling we‚Äôre not talking about tacos and cheese here. üëÄ 1:44
Does anyone else miss Adam eating alone at the end? Like, Steven you already had your camera time...I'm here for you and Andrew and all, but mostly Adam.
Adam is so cute omg his face when he saw the giant pancake
I love what the last chef said.. sounds beautiful
You should do a Worth It with Gordon Ramsay
Worth it is like my current favorite show on youtube.üòÇ Love Steven, Andrew and Adam‚ù§Ô∏è also Evanüòç
You are the best married couple ever. I love you.
Blueberry pancakes with half a lemon squeezed on top üòç oh and Adam has a doppelganger in Australia.
I'd rather have a nice giant breakfast at IHop
it's just roti with egg , everyday food of bengali guys haha 19 dollar this ? not worth it man
i really want them to go to New York and do a Lox and Cream cheese sandwiches
I need to stop watching these before bed...
That last one was amqzing .....Vegans r quaking right nowüòé
Has anyone made a Lamb Sauce joke yet?üòÇ
Ok. People need a little help here. My 10 year anniversary is coming up and I would like to talk my beautiful wife to the best restaurant in... Orlando FL. I'm in Ocala FL and have no clue about the finest restaurant in Orlando. Kobe's is a no go been there done that. I'm talking, the best restaurant in Orlando. Any help from experience is appreciated. Thanks. üá∫üá∏üí™
Are they a couple?\nIf yes, can I get proof?
this entire episode is like one giant date, but between best bros<3
this is adams world, we're just living in it
Adam is so fun to watch eating! Love it!
You know what the best brunch is? Dim sum
The definition of brunch to me is me waking up late so I had to eat breakfast and lunch..... so yea....... brunch
I'm going to have luner which lunch and dinner!
why am i watching this at 2am whilst starving
Andrew is a natural in front of the camera and will be a big star, Steven keeps the show together and Adam is the perfect foil for the pair. Huge things ahead congrats guys
All you can eat for only 15 dollars?
You should do worth it, ramen edition
International? daaaaaamn worth it got a budget upgrade like no other
I love Steven‚Äôs sweatshirt
The best part is BuzzFeed is so poor that these poor shmucks always have to swap food germs. Very immigrant -- I love it!
Adams face when he is presented with the giant pancake though...
a real cheese in usa DOESNT exist. remember that pls.
Do a worth it video on grilled cheese
Tell me why they dressed up when that went to Beverly HillsüòÇ. I just finished the video and now I feel dumbüòÇ
They kept saying Trinity and I'm like whose saying my name
I love that smile when Adam got the huge cake..
FREE FLOW CHAMPAGNE for $25 at the last place?? Count me INNNNNN!!!
WHEN THAT BIG PANCAKE WAS PUT IN FRONT OF ADAM HIS SMILE WAS SO BIG IM CRIEN
That last one is something i would absolutely love
They have the best job in the world.
I've never spent anything less than $40 at brunch. I spend anywhere 40 - $140 on myself easy.
Food has to be made with love ‚ù§Ô∏è
Her eyes pierced my soul and \nunlocked my deepest secrets.
You guys should do, worth it: HOTELS!!!!!
Seriously.  This drivel is in existence??
He described the Trinity so well......A babies thigh
THE TORTILLA IS LIKE A BABY'S THIGH üòÇ
Adam's face when they plop down that huge pancake!!  hahahaha
steven: when you're chugging...\nyou: (thinking) champagne?\nsteven: doughnuts.\nyou: good one steven. good one
Every time Adam eats their left overs or tries sumthing it's soooo cringey for me he looks soo awkward
Come to the Twin Cities and judge who has the best Juicy Lucy!
There is such a thing as pig jello. It's called pig bone marrow which is then crushed to what is known as Gelatin.
Now they going to brunch together, they slowly becoming more and more like a gay couple as this show goes on
They need to make one vegan edition
Really big shrimp!
vegan taco with egg? is that even vegan
I'm overeating brunch thanks buzzfeed.

Stop celebrating this shit . The elite will kill many children Halloween night . People thinks is a normal celebration but it is not . When we going to stop following Satan? For this shit everybody gets ready and get costumes but to follow Jesus teaching nobody move their ass. That's why the Zionist took over US because people here is already weak and brainwashed.

I can't even focus when she talks with that face dough
Instead of using 3D gel, just make your own gelatin and mix in the pigment. Glam and Gore have multiple videos on this technique and it's cheaper and easier

Okay. I cant get over the fact how loyal you two both are to each other. Y'all both have been together fpr 2-3 years, moved into a bomb ass house, got engaged,had a son, then move into another bomb ass house. Yall have the funniest little arguments but whem its ovet tell each other 'i love', you both make the craziest pranks on each other and you either get pissed or cry but in the end tell each other 'I love you' . yall can act totally ridiculous in public or not but never be embarrassed of each other. Yall both will do anything for each other amd it sets so much goals for people and its so inspiring.‚ù§\nYall just keep doing what yall are doing cause you both dont know how much you impact on yalls fans and set huge examples for love. You both are the best parents dominic will ever ask for and you both are going to raise him so well!üíï #wilsonfamily

The truth still lies in the X-Files, Mulder.
No more of those younger agents PLEASE! They were annoying and charismaless af.
Awe man! It's on! Can't wait
I loved that they brought the series back but it's almost it's own parody with some episodes. It's not dark like it was in the past. The fish man episode with the fake sex scene with Agent Scully really turned me off too last season. I mean when have they ever done anything like that with her character???
They all look great! Wow
That theme song never gets old.
makes me wanna take a knee
the rabbit hole just got a lot deeper than expected
Don't these two people hate each other in real life?
The X-Files, guaranteed to have more facts than fox news.
‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n*This Is True Love!!!  (Just ask Him)*
The Alien at the and is like Dude, what the fuck?
I love everything I just saw....everything...even the fact that they showed the same cut of Mulder looking around a corner twice to fill out the trailer.....
I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs watching this over and over again?
What cover of Zombie is that in the trailer? Should be a federal law to provide that lmao.
*HOLY SHIT THAT INTRO SENDS CHILL DOWN MY SPINE*
Does someone know the song? Or is it a new cover for the trailer?
If Mulder and Scully were real people they would have gone insane by now from everything they've experienced in The X files but there not real people so who care's, they almost die in nearly every episode but they carry on 'Where are going too this week Mulder?'
Love how both of you took a knee to support the NFL protest... JK you're dead to me now I destroyed my XFiles DVDs. I loved that show but seeing you two sell out like that.
0:47 stop right there I'm in \nI need friends
Who is the artist of the song we hear please? I love the version!
Uh huh, taking a knee, too, I almost don't want to watch. They don't realize how incredibly lucky they are to live in a country where you can get as stinking rich as these two, oh wait, she doesn't live here. Fuck off Anderson. Stick to movies. Besides, is she taking a knee against all the terror in Londonistan? I didn't think so.
2:04 nice! I love the flashback scenes.
So fucking excited for this!
Cigarette Smoking man turns out to be an alien in disguise who's been observing human activity!
This trailer looks better than all of the 10th season.
Does anyone know the link to this exact song cover?? Sounds like Corvyx but its not it...
Someone needs to get cigarette man a vape cigarette.
For those saying that Gillian is quitting after this season I did read that is not 100 hundred def if they decide to make and have a 12th season be the final one for sure and since the season will end on a cliffhanger it's still most likely to have a 12th season even without her as they did when David left for the original final season. Maybe they could bring back Doggett and Reyes or something but if there will be another season without Gillian it won't be as good of course but I just want it to actually finish with more closure than season 9 had
Cigarette Smoking Man is my favorite Character... I miss The Syndicate. The depopulation agenda never fails! üëåüèªüòÅ
I would allow Gillian Anderson to touch me once and only once
This isn't my X-Files.
ayy lmao's :D good i like / Excited for new episodes <3
i'm so excited to have this show back on
She gets hotter with age. Was my FHM UK pin up in the 90s when I was 17 & if my wife would allow me to have pin ups now, she would be now I'm 38. I never saw the last mini season & I thought the last movie was crap. This looks promising. I thought the way they finished the original was just right, but what a way to add to this new golden age of TV by putting in one of the shows that started epic episodic TV storytelling.
i hope the kill scully off
The end is near.
Wait a miniute mulder and scully' boy is allien???!!!
How is the smoking man still alive? He should've died from lung cancer decades ago.
Pause at 2:08\nOh... my... God.
Finally going back to orginial movie, the aliens are coming
I can‚Äôt wait! üëΩ
Oh, everyone is so old now... Only Scully is eternal beauty:)
well this was an nice surprise.
Holy s***! THIS! LOOKS! A.W.E.S.O.M.E.!!!!
Finally! I new it that will be next season. Can't wait.
Does Scully still not believe shit Mulder tells here like in the earlier series?
They Where Kneeling With The NFL So No More X-Files For Me and They Where On Jimmy  Cunt Kimmel
I'm watching this on the bus and looking like a crazy person because I'm just fangirling WAY too hard üòÇüò≠üò≠
I really hate the alien invasion crap, so I hope there will be some good monster of the week episodes. I love when they just investigate paranormal stuff.
I'M SO EXCITED
Oh my god thank you so much
Is that scene with the laughing statues shot in Vancouver? I remember that art peice, just don't recall which city it is, though I'm sure I've walked passed it several times.
i was 2 young for dis show b4 now i will watch it
https://youtu.be/c1_4SNLT2sk  N√£o sei se isso te interessa  Voc√™ se lembra deste video ?üòä
I've been watching the original X-FILES SINCE 1993-2002. AND in the recent episodes over a year ago. I always loved the X-FILES. This new series should be awesome.
Bad old smoky.
omg YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
tbh that trailer got me wet lol i was patiently waiting for season 11 and now that it is confirmed i am currently flooding my house
Simply go to google and simply type: *gamesecrx guide* You're going to get the only real working method fully FREE for the game.
Cancer man has to be a alien. How is he still alive???
If william b.davis is in it... things gonna gƒ± crazy bitches

They put everything in these shows and movies to show you exactly what they are going to do. Trust God! Call on him and today tomorrow is not promised. BELIEVE on the Lord  the he died and was buried for our sins and rose 3 days later. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4
Too bad the actors knelt in support of athletes who publicly disrespected the Flag.    If I boycott the NFL for spitting on the graves and sacrifices of our service members, then I boycott a show that I have watched since day one.  Too bad, it literally was one of my favorite shows.  Since day one.  If you want to protest, do not do it supporting the desecration of our Flag and Anthem, especially when it is based on lies and you are protesting the wrong people.

MASSIVE Thank you for everyone supporting me and making a dream reality! TG
The way Alan talks is like he doesn't know he's the top goal scorer in epl history
My Idol as well mate, watched him when I was younger on the telly. What an experience that would've been Geordie!
What a humble man Alan Shearer is.. He's also a straight talker, no bullshit and says exactly what he thinks. Not even a fan of Newcastle or shy of the teams he played for but so much respect for a good guy üëç\nMan I'd love a two hour podcast if you could get Paul Gascoigne on, imagine the stories he could tell lol.
This is a great interview.  Shearer is my favourite English striker, and the best that I have been play.  I am happy to see True Geordie interview his hero and keep it real.
Absolutely brilliant TG. Big follower anyways, but what a two hours. Gripping stuff. Mr Shearer is a true ledge of the English game and gave me fantastic enjoyment down the years. He put a 'shift' in here too. And he pulls no punches. Cheers guys. Manc Red since 79 n all. Keep up the gud work lad.
Absolutely Class podcast mate, congratulations on realizing a dream TG, as a Newcastle fan, this was amazing to listen to.
Holy Shit!!! Even as an American Toon Army supporter i'm giddy, and i only saw him at the end of his career. Thank You!
This would be better without Laurence. Guy knows fuck all about football. Loves the sound of his own voice
Shearer was a TOP class centre forward who scored all types of goals and was infact underrated.
It's all about money, tell me I'm wrong.
Shearer was a big part of why i started following NUFC, what a player. Great man too. Loved seeing TTG get the chance to meet one of his idols too. Great stuff. Keep at it fella. HWTL
Well in, TG. Happy for you. Being one of the realest youtubers out there, you immensely deserved this. The podcast was quite enjoyable and it was great to hear personal stories from Alan. Long may the King in the North reign. Your Empire shall hopefully soon have 1 million citizens
I am a Liverpool fan and I was so happy he turned down Man utd to go Newcastle and respect to him to turning so surely so many trophies to go to his boyhood club,he was a great player same never won a trophy with you.
As a fellow Newcastle fan, great to see you meeting your idol, such a nice, down to earth guy üëçüèª
Never watched a YouTube video for more than 15 mins.....until now. Shearer is a class act and great interview kid.
BEST VIDEO EVER!!!! nice to hear a few hope truths from wor al such a professional my brothers want to play for Newcastle and they graft there arses off every weekend please try and get my hero on Peter Beardsley for a talk  would be great to hear from him thanks guys keep the vids coming thick and fast C,MON THE TOON!
Class Brian how far you‚Äôve come , excellent interview
Fantastic inrerview mate i couldnt think of a questione you didnt ask.\nBig al a true gent as always......the toons no1 ......
Wtf I went off for like 2 months and they've got Alan shearer on congrats guys
What an absolute show today, loved this as a football, Lawrence and Geordie fan
I go to his sons school !
Gaz\n\nFulham fan. Shearer a legend! Watched whole interview and his  beard had grown an inch by end of interview.
Such an interesting & inspiring watch. Well done mate!
Intro song pls I need this
Could you get wayne rooney ???
First time listening, from Ireland and a United supporter haha, but was an unbelievable one, Id usually watch Joe Rogan/Fighter and the kid, dabble with cheeky sports the odd time, but this was unreal well done!
Who's the bird on the wall ?
What a sound guy .
This is one of the best yet, i feel like i say that every week. TTGP doesn't set the bar....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHEY ARE THE BAR!!
Very emotional last part. But so happy to see my favourite YouTuber make it even bigger than before
Being a Blackburn fan it was great hearing about the good old days. Fantastic podcast as always Geordie keep it up. #VenkysOut
Top player the Germans feared him! Seems like a top man too. Well done mate on a. Great interview ‚ò∫
Awesome player, awesome bloke, Humble, Legend for both Toon and England and even though in a time of Keane, Vieira and the rest,I can honestly say I can not remember anyone and i mean domestic or International would try and fuck with this man physically cos he would fuck you up and then score again.
the last minute of the podcast made me cry :)
Back on CM 1996/7 I was always newcastle due to Shearer (I'm a saints fan). Good interview.  Shearer is a nice bloke.
Brilliant interview - great insights. I picked up one error. Bobby Robson wasn't the manager for the Bowyer v Dyer incident - it was Souness.
TG ...you hit it out of the park with this one.
I'm a Sunderland fan. And I was absoloutely glued to that. Yea I couldn't stand shearer in a Newcastle shirt. But can't deny the legend that he is.
Who did Shearer tell not to come back to Newcastle?
Who brought their kitten to the studio man?
First one I listened to twice, awesome mate!
I know the answer to his question at about 1:03:30  It may have been midweek but there were many kids there and not in school because it was August lol
fuckin hell, now get benitez and mcgregor on
you guys are way too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n smart for football,  do so\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmething vital.. True geordeie is, the side kick is a moron
Georidie i fucking love ur content get rich but never change!!!! Also if u guys get a Gallagher brother on the podcast tht would be great
Just scanning YouTube and found your podcast just wanted to say not a Newcastle fan but really injoyed the podcast!
Arsene Wenger says what made muhammad ali so great was he got loads of people interested in boxing. \n\nsame thing applies to true geordie, he's got a lot of us hoping newcastle do well
This is just my opinion but I think where you're sitting is less of a sit down and talk and more of an interrogation. I know that's not what you guys are going for but it's what it looks like.
The True Geordie\n8 minutes in, if People think Alan is God then something wrong with them in my view. Yes Alan Shearer had great Football talents. He is just an ordinary person as we all are normal people. I can be a fan of his, i worship Jesus. I don't have idols. I will continue to watch the video. He was a great football player at the end of the day he is a normal person. I will also say this Alan Shearer has a great attitude in the interview.
I feel like an idiot not knowing match of the day is live
What do your daughters think shoot growing up with Alan sherear lol what an opening question
Blackburn team were underdogs? chelsea of there day spent a lot manufactured success and only won the league because cantona was banned.
WANKER OF THE WEEK GORDON STRACHAN!!!!
Get gerrard on if u can
Lads what a great video - watched the whole lot great work
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no club bigger than Newcastle‚Äù has shearer never heard of Everton?
One of the best football documentaries I have ever watched.  Thank-you.\n\nAs a 34 year old Palace fan, I would just like to say, I actually liked Newcastle a lot.  I also thought the team you had with Solano etc was class, and Solano is largely forgotten about now but he was one of the best foreign players I have seen.\n\nGreat video.  I will share it.\n\nI just ask one thing.  \n\nI am a Palace fan and I know we are in the shit now, but please stop rubbing it in. ;)
Cracking interview. Wonderful to see a proper lad doing well. Believe it or not, my non West Ham idol as a kid was Alan Shearer. Keep up the good work mate
Brilliant video deserve every penny you get

12/10/17 - #45 ON TRENDING !?!? lol this trending because of Harvey? lol
waaaaay fuck weinstein pizzagate is real boiiiis
I think they should host one of the games here in Houston Texas
Stuart Pearce losing a game as a manager? Where have we seen this before...
What's the song called  when the commentary said that ksi intressed
Tekkers was so op but still got destroyed
If billy was on for Cutting, Tekkers prolly could have won or tied
Hope ksi don't make a disstrac about tekkers city
How much did Spencer pay the F2???
chrismd :/
My Bad 14.34
Yes hashtag
There both Sunday leeeeagueee
Spencer FC
does anybody else get annoyed by geordie sometimes? something about him idek.
David James just isn't a legend, always been shot and still is now hahaha
Crappy defensive side for tekkers. Absolutely no chemistry and fitness for tekkers. This isn‚Äôt right üò°üò°üò°
why cant the amazing freestylers like daniel cutting and sian garnier and jezza just dribble through the whole team and score like they do in their videos
+F2Freestylers - Ultimate Soccer so funny when there was a pen for jezza and he was so serious when he scored but then he was like, this is just my job
Please do a Highlights video like last year.
david JAMES as they call him in spain lmao lawrence u dumbass lol haha funny mfkrs
Just finished highschool but already makes more money then you
Does anyone know the bouncin tune that was played as the teams came out?
If tekkers town had a single legend in defence this game would've been very different.
Geordie looking smart once a year for the wembley cup. üòä
without a doubt the commentary made this
Came and stayed for the commentary
I think Elliot let Team Tekkers down the whole game.
I went to the Match
As much as I'd like it to be true, William Gallas never won a World Cup.
country music these days is awful , I enjoy Billy currington  ,but I don't care about the others. our 1990s n 1980s music will not be played again unless there's a station that just plays the older music . it's too bad too, it took away a lot of good music!!!! if we have CDs of our favorites, then we can listen to them . but I think there should be a good amount of the older country played. the 1980s& 1990s really had a lot of good country. music worth listening to.!!.
Yo, I haven't exactly payed the attention i should've. Can anyone tell me why Billy ain't playing?
KSI and Joe Weller on the same team lol.
Anyone can tell me the score so I don‚Äôt have to watch the whole thing
Hi everyone can you check out my little boys football channel if you like subscribe thank you
Man True Geordie and Lawrence are to much!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Anyone know the song that was played when they scored
What's the goal song called?
Who saw Jimmy Conrad pointing where jeremy was going when he was taking the penalty
Pollock is quality
Aids :/
slaughter
Theo Barker??
Tekers guru
Don't know who I would prefer as a defence out of Liverpool's defence or tekkerz town's defence
is scott allowed to have that bottle......
They should make a tournament  with teams Facebook youtube twitter and istagarm
Geordie and Laurence's commentary was golden, had me laughing all game.
Seb is such a try hard haha and it doesn‚Äôt work.
Brain and Lawrence managed to make this game incredibly entertaining üòÇ
Well done to billy wingrove for coming on
isnt it funny how every year spencers team has won and when spencer went on sidemen team they won and when spencer went on youtube all stars they won
Why didn‚Äôt give JJ a proper pic? His face is photoshopped onto a black bodyüòÇ
Sub to my channel
Does anyone else hate Laurence? He's so annoying
If Tekkers had both the F2 they would have dominated this game, the extra training time would have been very helpful as well
I love spencer fc like if you agree
If Billy played the score would've changed
I focking love how k.s.i is in the same team as husky long time fans will get it hilarious.
Pollock looks like he cn score the goals by himself  he just pass the ball so nobody gets angry on him
Linesman should go in the kitchen and make me a meal
Everyone killing Jezza needs to realize chemistry kills talent every time...Hashtag play together all the time and it showed. TT never plays together and it showed.
The difference in that game was William gallass
This is the same Gerard that played for Liverpool ? Lmao
The other commentator is so bad unlike true Georgie
if the other team played as much as hashtag it would of been a different story
Pollock the man of the match should get signed by a pro team for the under 18 or something
No credit to Jacko for saving so many great strikes by Steven Gerrard?
weller and jj were on same team
Gerrard never nasty...just stamped on Herrera that one time after being on the pitch for 1 min ;)
It‚Äôs always hashtag
Wingrove?
Announcers only ##################
*theo barker üòÇ
Wingrove?
Theo Barker hahehe lol
Did joe Weller come on?
Spencer pin this if you love all your fans
Where is Miniminter?
Did Joe Weller even play
Geordie < martin Tyler
If only at the beginning jezza and Sean just dribbled they're so good but they don't dribble
I last my teams chance to wembley  cup 2017
wait! Joe Weller dosen't play?
SCOTTIE P MVP
Anyone notice theo barkerer
chamber bread chair oldrrzk controversial complex anywhere reporting northeast remark.
where is ferdinand
Did
F**k this game
This is unfair: you take a team that has already play a lot of games togheter and that is really fit and then a team that has never played togheter and are really unfit and then play against each other. of course the fit team is going to win and if you think that legends will help then no ok some of them were fit still but many of them were not so the legends will also not really help. Plus you obviously need a professional coach and do some training because everyone got tackled who ever got the ball and when some one was open no one else opened up so it was very hard to pass it is just un fair it is the same as real madrid and tekkers town played togheter un fair also the others from hashtag who were off camera during the challenges were obviously training togheter
Why does lynch never use his skill
Hashtag only won because billy was injured
commentary was on another level! hope you guys do it also next year! thanks for the laughs! oh, and the game was ok too
Heskey time
Houst, Tx
I miss this!!!! Noo
Hashtag should sign jeremy lynch and billy wingrove
lajk ako si balkanac
Who won
I wanted Gerard to slip again
The commentator who you talking about when referring to KSI... omg!!! Had me crying!!! You can tell he is old and doesn't follow today's celebrity's. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
i love this kind of video ! <3
hey thank you for making this video lucy ! it made me realise that i might be in a hormonal depression like you mentioned the pill caused for you, however i've been on depo provera / the injection for about 4 months now and my depression has been absolutely horrible. i got discharged from therapy earlier this year as i was feeling better about my depression but i had to go to back to therapy as i felt depressed again and it was also around the same time i started by birth control !!! so thank u :)
My doctor recommended me the Yasmin pill which I was on for about a year, and I found it cleared up my skin really nicely, however, I felt extremely hormonal and volatile in the off couple of days before my period. Because of this, I decided to go off of it and similarly, my skin became awful. It's taken me almost another year and a lot of skincare medication to get it back to the point of where it used to be, and I really wish someone had warned me about the consequences of going off of Yasmin.
for what it's worth, i know someone who is allergic to yeast! so it could be that haha
I've tried \nCopper iud (rejected)\nEstrogen projesten combo pills (had awful hesr attack like symptoms)\nProjesten only pills two different strengths (gave me same side effects combo pills did) \nNuvaring (again same side effects)\nMy partner and I would prefer not to use condoms so we are looking into surgical options as I am in a hetero relationship and don't want kids
Do you think your feeling of ‚Äòcraziness‚Äô was because you had a break up, maybe you were dealing with that too?\nBut I 100% agree with the hormonal depression, I was on a pill once where I felt so low, I changed and it was so much better
I'm not sure if I just don't notice my period symptoms anymore or if they're just very mild. My periods are generally quite uneventful--I may be slightly more irritated a bit before, but nothing ever noteworthy. They typically only last three days and the only symptom I've ever noticed is some heavy cramping my first day.
Before you do 23andMe or anything of the sort I would highly recommend doing some research into the fact that they can sell your genetic data to third party companies etc!
I switched from the pill to the implant then finally to the copper coil/IUD and honestly having something hormone free has changed my life. No side affects at all apart from slightly heavier, more painful periods but generally better skin, mood, regular cycles etc. Copper coil all the way!
I'm on the pill which has helped with me getting depressed a week before the week during and the week after so basically i had one week of feeling like me and that sucked however i still have body dysmorphia and i get very emotional and everything is very sensitive which i hate and this period it was bad i hadn't seen my therapist for a week everything was building up and people were being right dick heads this week and what made things worse is that teachers at my school still don't know or even try to know about mental health issues and how to deal with someone having a panic attack non the less my period can do one :(
I'm also having an unusual series of periods. I still haven't got it, but I'm already bloated, I'm super hungry all the time, and I've been feeling depressed for a few weeks. And that's weird cause I never had mood changes before due to my period. I don't understand why this changed. Can your body just change like that even if you haven't done anything different in your lifestyle? As for the pill, I don't feel comfortable taking it, so I just don't :) To me it feels too artificial and I'm not a big fan of hormonal treatments (anyway, that's just what I do myself, of course, I think everyone should take their own decisions on that and that it's ok other people decide to take them).
I was recommended Yasminiq when I was 16 and still take it to this day. I took a pill break from october-november 2016 to february 2017 and I got the WORST CYSTIC ACNE. It just wouldn‚Äôt go away and I didn‚Äôt want to leave my house because it looked terrible and my face hurt.\nI know a girl in the UK whose doctor told her she should take breaks every three months? But my doctor said that I could just take my pill forever? I don‚Äôt know what to believe.
I've been recommended to double pack my pill by many doctors because of my horrendous period pains (endometrosis) never once been told its unsafe.
You'd be surprised by how many people are actually yeast intolerant instead of gluten. It also might be worth seeing if you're intolerant to Malt - as it's in beer, but only some breads and cereals. You could get an intolerance test done from a nutritionist outside of the NHS and it really helps! Saves time with all the trial and errors of eating certain foods each month! :)
I haven't got my period in 5 months. How do i get it back ahh!!
Deep shades of lipstick look so good on you compared to just Dabbing on colour
I have a hormone imbalance. Probably have pcos due to most of the woman in my mums side having it. I started at 11. It was irregular, fairly light but very bad cramps. I have ibs so that interfered. After a year my period got heavier, began my descent into anxiety and depression, cramps got worse, acne EVERYWHERE other than my face lol. Gained an obscene amount of weight. I left my school and moved to a much better one. Two kinds of pills later I‚Äôm on sertraline and an anti acid with no pill. My periods are back and batter ish. I used to have them for 2weeks to 8weeks and now they‚Äôre exactly 7 days and only very very heavy for 2days. Zelest was great as it removed my periods completely but due to gaining weight I couldn‚Äôt take it. I went on the single hormone which really didn‚Äôt work. Bit babbly but you get the picture. Much happier now, still fighting my weight but I‚Äôll get there. Ly girl - starting conversations from day one xxx
i read a historic book and suddenly started to cry...yeah hormons are great
I swear A LOT on my period and I'm so emotional
I love these type of videos.
I don‚Äôt understand why you put so much god damn emphasis??? on using cruelty free make up but you still but from shops like H&M? Like??? Why don‚Äôt you care about your clothes being cruelty free? I don‚Äôt... understand??
I‚Äôm on the pill Marvelon to help my skin and my period pain and my skin is incredible, I went from having acne to completely clear skin but my period pain is awful.. I accidentally doubled a pill this month when I was hungover (no idea why) and I‚Äôve started my period early, usually I start on exactly the same day on my break week, but I am in agonyyyy, I need a pill that fixes my skin and my painü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è loved this video! X
I believe I have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. I also have really heavy, long and painful periods so that I cry from the pain and everything it is not a good time
I have REALLY bad cramps on my period, but I've just gone on the  rigevidon pill. I've just had my first period on the pill and I had NO CRAMPS!!!! I was the happiest person on the planet, so that's my story üòä
i‚Äôm on yasmin too!! i‚Äôve been on a few different ones after suffering from intense cystic acne and yasmin with antibiotics has worked a treat but i‚Äôm so terrified of when i decide to come off it and get bombarded with it again!!
About the food/diet thing, I'm suffering with IBS, which involves things such as bloating and feeling sick after eating. (Relatable to your symptoms)\nAt the moment I'm doing a diet called the Fodmap diet which is of course meant to help with the symptoms but the main goal is to find out what food triggers you by trying several categories of foods and keeping a diary. I've only started a couple of days ago, so I'm still very new at this but I thought of the diet immediately when you mentioned the foods that might or might not trigger you. It might not be useful for you at all but it is worth to google :)
I used to be on a combined pill that needed a 7 day break and it was horrible. The pain was unbearable (cramps) and I became depressed and also very angry. Kept lashing out at my family and then boyfriend. Changed over to the 30 day pill and I'll never look back. I don't have the same problems anymore, rarely any mood swings (my mood levelled out) and it helped calm me down and rarely any pain \nTrust your instincts on this stuff your body will tell you when it doesn't agree with something
I'm 23 and I've always had a really irregular period ever since I can remember. When it came, it wasn't too painful, it was ordinary length and everything, but there were months when it just didn't come. Once when I was maybe 16 or 17, there was an entire year when my period just disappeared, although I'm pretty sure that was due to the death of my brother which occured around that time. Now I finally did go to the doctor and I got a pill, I just started taking it, so I'm really hopeful that it will help me having regular, on-point periods again. If anything, it's really making me more focused and helps me feel a lot better, I've been down lately, but I've been much more balanced since taking it. Fingers crossed it'll work on the long run! :)
I feel like the pill is messing up my hormones or is it my mental health. I really don't know :/
I take Gedarel, as I was taken off Ridgevidon after my face broke out and I had lots of chest pain. It definitely cured the spots but the chest pain has got slightly better but hasn‚Äôt gone entirely. However, I‚Äôve noticed that with this pill my mood is lower generally, and my libido/sex drive is non-existent which is very frustrating for my partner. I think I will be going back to the doctors soon to see what can be done.
I have been on Yasmin for 7 years without a break. I have no bad side effects and everything seems normal and manageable (3 day light periods, no pain, no acne, no bloating and minimal PMS). That said - I'm worried I could be hiding my true self! What if I came off the pill one day and no longer loved my husband?! Wondering if I should TRY another pill just to see... or, should I not kill a good thing?
Period day 3 still living just about
My implant is really messing with me, and I should go to the doctors, but I feel like male doctors don't really understand, which puts me off, annoying because my first implant was great
My brother has a yeast intolerance so it's very possible that you could be allergic to that. He also lives in London where yeast alternatives are a lot more available for things like yeast free soy sauce and suchlike :)
I can relate to so many of these pill problems. Taking the pill was just not the right thing for me. I used to get headaches that were out of this world, and it was every time during my pill break (so essentially my period) without fault. I knew that two days after going on a break I couldn't schedule anything with friends because I would be in bed with all the lights out and no sound whatsoever. Now since I am off the pill and using a non-hormonal way for birth control I am so much happier. I can't recommend it enough to try and go without hormonal birth-control for a while, it's so much better for your body and your mind (I used to be an emotional mess whilst on the pill, now I'm totally fine)!
See im on Microgynon and have been for over a year and it really agrees with me so far compared to the 3 others ive been on. But i really wanna come off and try the contraceptive app, but my partner doesnt like condoms. EH. LIFE OF A WOMAN.
every time i watch her videos i feel so peaceful inside <3
You do make me consider going to the doctors to try another pill... Even if its just to see what it would do to me Hahaha
I mean your aesthetic is just goals
The food thing may also be fermented foods? All GI doctors get you to do the FODMAP diet, I'm sure you've heard of it. Maybe talk to your doctor about giving that a go? Kombucha is also fermented fruits and stuff hence why I suggested the FODMAP diet. It helps narrow down which food group it is x
a book i read about nutrition told me to find out for myself what i'm intolerant to and how differents food affect my body (cutting stuff out, trying new foods, etc) it's a looong road but i'm willing to try it üôåüèª
Also, I couldn't recommend enough picking up the book A Mind of your Own by Kelly Brogan. At least look her up on facebook or on her website
This video came at the right time! I have really heavy, really painful, super irregular period and I've been trying to research what kind of pill would help me. The thing is, my mom is against it. It's already been more than five years since my first period (it'll be six in April) and they've been getting progressively worse. This last period, I woke up twice at night because of the pain. And I was on a heating pad! I've been having to take two Aleve and an ibuprofen in the morning, then another ibuprofen at lunch or when I get home. I'm just tired of my super heavy periods and want some relief.
I'm having a very similar experience right now! I've been on rigevidon for about 8 months now, but starting in May, I began to have anxiety attacks about once every 2 weeks or so, normally in the evenings. Recently they've been happening way more often, and this period it's happened three days in a row. I know that rigevidon has caused similar anxiety symptoms in a lot of other women so I'm thinking of swapping to a lower oestrogen pill!
This was lovely to watch, especially as I'm on my period too! You're the only person I know of who has tried Cilest, it was the first pill I tried and I was on it for 3 years and the only reason I stopped was because it stopped effecting my periods and I just had irregular periods anytime instead of during my week break. I then went on Cerazette I think (mini pill) and I was on it for 2 weeks and it made me suicidal so I came off it and my GP was horrible about it but this was the same GP who didn't believe me when I came to her for help with anxiety and depression. I went on another combined pill for a while and then ended up back on Cilest and eventually on a cheaper version of it at the moment! I get awful PMS too I hate myself on my period. I get so forgetful, very irritable and impatient but also mega tired and I either want to eat everything or nothing. I can't believe some of the things doctors have said about the pill, taking two pills at once sounds mental! \nI take my pill 2 months at a time and then I have a week break because during the week break I get bad migraines and my mental health gets really bad so I try to avoid having a period every month and doctors have said it's okay to do it the way I'm doing it. I love watching videos about this stuff, I love talking about contraception and sexual health because it's a personal thing that I don't tend to discuss as most of my friends are on the implant and all tell me I should get it but no thank you üòÇ
After 6 years on the pill, most recent being Desogestrel, I decided to come off it altogether. I feel liberated üëçüëç could not deal with the constant flat moods and not really giving a shit about anything - good or bad. Now I watch adverts and cry when i think theyre emotional looool SUCCESS
I've had the ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel pil since I was 14. As far as I know it's been working for the last 5 years.
I don't think the issue is lack of training, but due to lack of research. Obviously research is being done, but how much of it by men? How much of women's health issues have been dictated, researched, etc. by men? And how many medications given to men for certain ailments are also given to women even if no research was done on women? There's a book written on the topic and I have no idea what it's called. \nBut this video is making me want to go back into Biology.
I was on cilest, and it was awful for me! I was so angry and so hormonal and irritated. I changed to rigevidon, which has caused no side effects and I'm thrilled! Just goes to show, it is completely dependent on each and every body. Don't just listen to what has/hasn't worked on your friend. We're all unique!
Here in Norway many doctors give you Yasmin to start off with, so I got that. It made me really down. I am normally a very happy go lucky person but on Yasmin i was almost sad. It took me a while to realize it, but when I did - swithing it made all the difference. Now I'm using Loette and have no side-effects. Well, right now I'm not using any pill, because I'm pregnant :) But I have been really happy and feeling like myself after switching pills!
I used Yasmine for my acne for about 6months and it did clear up my acne but when I got off it...my ance was worse than ever and I felt really bad in my skin. Now I'm off the pill and I'm looking for a non-hormonal way to not get pregnant haha! Hopefully some day the man-pill will come out...
ugh, periods are awful. for the first years of my period i only got like 2 or 3 in a whole year. I tried birth control but I have severe anxiety and depression and it just fucked me up so I gave up on that totally. Then a weird thing happened where i just started CONSTANTLY bleeding. like 4 months on. straight. tried birth control again and again it completely fucked up my anxiety and depression so i decided id rather bleed FOREVER than go completely insane. Then they found a huge cyst on one of my ovaries, the size of a fucking melon. SO had surgery and my periods seemed to get a little better, until i started bleeding forever again. THIS TIME my doctor was like 'listen, let's just give you a birthcontrol bill with no estrogen that we give new mothers who are breast feeding, really low dose of hormones.' I agreed and now I HAVE A MONTHLY PERIOD.\n\nCelebratioooooon.\n\nOf course the down side is that now I have 'typical' period things. I get really really emotional and cry a lot, I want all the sweets, I get terrible cramps and just lay in bed moaning and ranting about how unjust life is. Who cares. It is magic. MAGIC I TELL YOU.\n\nNow I just need to make up all the iron I lost when I was bleeding CONSTANTLY. Apparently blood loss really fucks with a person.
I have friends who take low-dose birth control pills for their acne. Not sure what kind, though.
I literally just got on the pill a couple days ago and had questions about people's experiences, so this video was perfect!
I have never used a hormonal pill however I do take a herbal supplement which has been LIFE CHANGING! I used to get the most intense cramps, back and leg pain as well as severe nausea and fainting episodes, every month! I had tried anti nausea pills from the doctor but they weren't always effective and did nothing for my mood swings and menstrual cramps. I visited a homeopathic clinic and ended up starting on 'agnus castus', a herbal supplement which balances my hormones throughout the month. It basically stops the huge build up of hormones on the first day of my period which was causing my body to go a bit mental! This literally cured me and if I remember to take my supplements everyday I can have almost no symptoms whatsoever - even less painful symptoms like breast tenderness has almost diminished! I know it sounds hippie and alternative and unlikely to work, but I have found the natural way far more effective than anything I have ever been prescribed. Homeopathy treats the underlying condition whereas, in this case with my periods, conventional medicine was just trying to treat the symptoms. I am now in the position where the symptoms do not occur. The only down side is you do have to pay for it however my supplements are about ¬£9 a bottle and I only use up about 3 per year so it's a small cost for the amazing benefits I receive. I really cannot recommend it enough!
I have PCOS, so I got my period for about three months straight and then not again for another year at a time (which had the side effects for bleeding so much), and then for two months and then not again for six months. the flow was extremely heavy all of the time. the pills would give me horrible rashes on my body and do nothing with my actual cycle. I tried about three different ones and then began the depo shot. i haven't had my cycle since 2014 but every three months around the time my shot is due, I do have serious mood swings, cravings, cystic acne and cramping. it's nothing compared to when I actually had my period, though. I have abnormal lower abdomen swelling from time to time and strong pain, but unfortunately I have not found a doctor that thinks that it's nothing more than yoga or drinking more water can change. I believe more people need to talk about these things because it seems like nobody knows what I'm talking about when I bring it up.
The pill makes me extremely depressed! I've been off it for a year now and my mood is more consistent, but I still get depressed/anxious during the week my period starts. Its really good to talk about this!
It is very possible you may have a yeast intolerance, there are circumstances that lead to an overproduction of yeast in our bodies that can lead to intolerance. Funnily enough oral contraceptives with synthetic progesterone can cause it. I am getting this off of the internet, but seems like enough of a reason to go to your doctor and get tested.
Will you do a video about bullet journaling?
Microgynon isn't often prescribed in Aus but I'm on a double dose of it, because while I don't have huge problems with blood flow, I often got my period two or three times a month for a couple of days (and yes, that included PMS symptoms). I tried many other pills including a lesser does of Microgynon, and my period would still come, just more clumpy and gross. Each to their own with taking pills but I'm so grateful that it got my period back into a normal routine.
Yasmin is the only one I've had problems on, HATED IT!!!!
I can definitely relate to this, especially when it comes to different doctors telling you different things! I was also put on Microgynon, then after about a year on that, the doctor I was seeing recommended I changed to a mini-pill, even though I was happy and healthy with what I was taking. I saw a different doctor for that appointment to actually get a prescription for cerelle, who seemed very confused as to why I was changing if there was no problem. Ugh! Now with Cerelle I don't get periods which freaks me out more than anything, so I want to change back... if I can even get an appointment before my next pack ends. Ahh, to be a person with a uterus :)))))))
I appreciate your candor! I wish more people would be open about periods--it would have made my life as a young teenager much easier! My worst period story is the time that I had cramps so bad that my mom called an ambulance and I had myriads of tests and ultrasounds only to be told that it was gas pain...none of the doctors even suggested that it was period related. Still angry.
I feel bad for all the people out there who have so many problems with the pill and /or their periods, I've been using micronelle for almost two years as contraception and I've been fine, with minimal to no side effects. I do get really painful cramps on the first day of my period and I get emotional and cry as well but other than that it's fine.
My period have started today, my mood is going up and down, i'm angry and in tears about basically anything. I took the pill from 18 till 20 and i have a copper DIU now. The side effect is that acne is there and ruins my confidence sometimes but still, i felt different (better) quitting the pill...
I'm on the pill and during my period I feel similar to how you felt when you were 16, like worthless, ugly, etc, I hate it but I don't blame the pill I'm on to be honest as it works well with me
If any of you ladies, have any advice on the pill, I would love to know, because I‚Äôve been told by friends to give it a try because my period tends to be very painful, and heavy on the flow side of things, but I live in a conservative state so it‚Äôs not talked about at all really....so I‚Äôm unsure as to giving it a try or not???
Just a guy passing through......
I wish that more people with female reproductive organs talked about how they feel not just on their period, but throughout their ENTIRE cycle, too. I have the most horrific cramps during my period, but when I ovulate, my skin breaks out and I have other physical symptoms, and it took me the longest time to figure out why my body was acting the way it was during a seemingly random time of the month because I had no idea I could be affected by my ovulation. Our bodies are constantly at work on this cycle, with our hormone levels varying depending on what time it is in the cycle, and I hope more conversations about hormones and periods also include discussion about how our bodies operate during other times of the month.
Honestly as a teenager I'm really struggling with my periods, the hormonal side and the pain thankyou for this x
Love the Chatty GRWM videos!\n\nI have endometriosis and adenomyosis which results in super painful periods. I have tried so many different hormonal treatments and it has left my with horrible side effects from bloating and weight gain to hair loss and acne. I now have a horrible relationship with my body because it has changed so often and I don't understand it. ¬†I know that not your experience but it's nice to hear someone talk about things openly.
I‚Äòm on a pill called maxim since i‚Äòm sixteen. It‚Äôs sooo good. My skin is great (and has always been), my mood is normal or good. My period lasts 3 to 4 days. Not sure if maxim is available in the uk, I‚Äôm from Germany. But maxim is great.
every time i'm on my period, i love making period jokes or puns to lighten the situation. i'm menstruating currently and i can strongly say that i hate this period of time
My mother gets scarily emotional during her periods. I have recently just been getting these same symptoms. For a week I beat on myself more than usual. I completely hate myself, and become self destructive. I even fall make into super bad eating habits I try my best to avoid. I scare myself during my time of the month. Does anyone have tips to help me not go to extremes, when I feel like I have no control during this time ???
so weird how its so different for different people! went on the pill for my acne, started with dianette then it got to 2 years so my doc made me switch to yasmin. yasmin made me bloated, starving, depressed and my hair fell out. came off then went back on dianette which gave me cystic acne and bleed for 3 months straight (ideal at uni first year ofc) then went on cilest and have been very happy for 3 years on it. I could never go on roaccutane because of my anxiety, enjoyed this vid!! X
the less sleep I get, the more hormonal I am and the more I cramp
I really enjoyed this video Lucy xx
Hey, everything you say sounds so familiar, I had a completely different anti-conception journey but still relate a lot to your story. Thanks for sharing!\n\nI feel like your right that we have to figure it out ourselfs never blindly follow your doctors advice when it comes to female issues.\n\nAlso a few months ago I went vegan! And I feel like this really helped me to get a more balanced cycle. My pms is better, I'm less bloated round my period, my boobs hurt for 2 days instead of 10. It really is a good thing!\n\nAlso I have been reading up on how the female reproductive system works into DETAIL :p and it made me so much more confident and insinc with my cycle!
Period experience-\nI had blood EVERYWHERE. It was appalling. It was like the alien (from the movie alien) made its way not through my stomach but through my vagina, I might as well have been giving birth- but i wasn't.
girl your cozy jumpers make me feel good about life lmao
Of course you would be all messed up after stopping the pill that you took for so many years! Why do people get so surprised by that? It's such a big change for your body, it has to remember how it is to ovulate and work properly. You should definately give yourself more time to recover.. Please try to go off the pill again when you feel ready and give your body some time. You are not a machine, you can't just press a button and be alright. I was on yasminelle (a lighter version of yasmin) for just 18 months, stopped it 20 months ago and I still have serious period and skin issues. My doctor said it would take as long as it needs but it will come back to normal. So please, don't give up so easily on something that is harmful for you
Just a quick note - you can take the pill indefinitely without taking a period/bleeding break. I have been told by at least 4 gynaecologists that it is perfectly fine and just as safe as taking a break (and none have ever told me it isn't as safe). I have endometriosis and part of my treatment is the Mirena coil and CIlest with no period breaks. Also about raised blood pressure with the pill, your GP is meant to test your blood pressure every 3-6 months when you are on the pill so if your doctor isn't doing this already i suggest asking that they do.
My periods are honestly so screwed. Day 1 - 2, I can't really eat, Day 2, I can't walk because everything hurts no matter what pain medication I've taken, and then I wake up Day 3 - 5 and I'm completely fine. I only tend to get down or sad on the weekends for some reason, no matter if I'm just starting my period, or halfway through or ending it. Worth mentioning I've nearly been hospitalised because of my cramps before.
I've never taken the pill and I'm 21. I'm thinking about doing it for the clear skin and all...but I HATE to put medication into my body *sigh* . Also I'm prone to depression and anxiety and I fear the slightest change in my hormones might trigger bad episodes. \n\nGreat Video Lucy!
I was on Microgynon for 3 months when I finally realised I could go on contraception to stop the awful, heavy, painful periods I was getting. I didn't notice it myself until after I came off it, but I became irritable, had terrible mood swings and had¬†a major decline in my mental health. It was by chance that they took me off this and gave me Rigevidon when I went back, and I had a much better experience on that. For me though, my periods are so bad I can't stand having them at all, so I got the implant a few months ago and have been period-free since. I'd really recommend both Rigevidon and the implant for people looking into helping/completely stopping heavy,¬†painful¬†periods. Loved this video, it's so great to hear others' experiences!
I break out really badly right before my period when not on contraceptive. So I just went back on my birth control hoping it helps clear up my skin. I don't take the pill I use a patch form of birth control which I have used on and off the last 6 years since I was 18. Wasn't very good with keeping up with it during college. It works great for me. I have very mild periods without it anyway but I still find it nice to have my period and hormones regulated so they're more the same every month.
Gentle reminder: Not only us women have periods and a uterus. Ily though Lucy
Also on YEAST thing, I can't eat yeast it really messes me up. I get tired and feel sick and like i and spaced out. I got it tested at a alternative medical thing and ever since I stopped or avoided it it made me so much better. I eat sourdough bread (specially with no added yeast) and just no pizza :( and some crackers/breadrolls and other baked goods. I don't drink alcohol bc of the yeast intolerance.
Yasmin sounds like a great pill, from your opinions. I would really like to research more on pills as I have not found out much about it.
Youre hair!' üòç
I really like these videos because it's a topic that isn't talked about on youtube that often.¬†I just got back on the pill after not taking it for over a year, because my skin and period pain got so bad. Originally I didn't want to go back on the pill because I hate the fact that I now take hormones every single day, but to be honest I also didn't find a better form of contraception for me. Regarding my skin I really hope to see an improvement, even though I'm not taking the strongest pill that is used for acne, because I'm too scared of blood clots. But in general, every friend I talk to either has problems with their hormones and skin after coming off the pill or doesn't want to take the pill anymore but can't find a better alternative. The struggle is real üôÑ
microgynon fked me up
Mmmm another GRWM? Feed me I need more Lucy
shit.
'Best' pill for hormonal acne?
It might be barley
girl theres gluten in beer
Ur awesome
I used to get so irritated every time i had my period, this was pre birth control and literally anything done by anyone, especially by brother, would make me so frustrated. but now i'm on the implant and that fucked up my periods so i went on a pill at the same time to try and figure that out but now i'm off the pill and my fucked periods have come back. (fucked being that i would get a really long period every 2 weeks) so i think i'm just going to get the implant out, maybe go hormone free for a while who knows\nbut i am absolutely terrible at taking a pill at the same time every day so i'm going to need something i can't mess up\nAlso i think the implant it messing with my skin as well plus i'm not really have sex so theres sort of no use having it \naghh but idk
The first pill i was put on made me bleed constantly (which was ironic since it makes a lot of women's periods stop completely). I didn't realise for a while that it was also making me slightly depressed. Once i was changed onto a different pill i felt so much better, i can't even describe it. My periods are still a tad irregular but they're getting there
yikes not a great trailer for a probably incredible series
Is it me or this trailer is just too noisy. It seemed like I was playing another video at the background whole time playing this.The dialogues and the music was just too much I guess.
Wrong choice of music for psychological horror.
Anna Torv üòç
I'm confident this will be great, but the music choice really fucked this trailer over.
Wait for stranger things wil be less painful now.
Im very excited for this series, it has great potential, but this is a shit trailer
David Fincher is a great thriller director
These are the types of shows that I subscribe to netflix for.... Not the last 50 netflix shows that I never would watch... Good,  highly entertaining shows like this one are the reason I will continue to subscribe.... Take these away\n... My money goes away! üòØ
I am beyond ready for this.
I loved the first trailer (teaser) but this one, not so much... I'm still looking forward to the release of this series though!
aaaa groffsauce üíï
Jonathan Groff and Anna Torv, friday come soon!
the music was really not well suited for this trailer
Friday the 13th this coming out!
What about the Punisher?
*G R O F F S A U C E*
That Jonathan can Groff me all night.
The song just didn't work, but just look at Groffsauce. Ugh, I'm so not ready, I might even cry. Hopefully I do so.
I'm tired of cop series. (Investigation, crimes and witness. I'm full of this. )\nI love Netflix, but cop series is boring.\nBut, Star Track Discovery Is simple amazing I'm waiting to the next episode.
WOW! A whopping 100k views?!! I can definitely see why this is trending. Its totally just suuuuuper popular and not just youtube making deals behind closed doors.
this trailer is so bad hahahaa still great potential on the series
The Cinematography has David Fincher written all over it

who chose the music for this trailer?  terrible.
First trailer was a lot better
Anyone know what serial killers will be featured? i can see obviously Ed kemper, Jerry Brudos, Richard speck and a shot of BTK in the last trailer, thats all i can tell.
Another show that glamorizes serial killers in some fashion
the track song ? Please
So like can we just call trending page what it is? Paid Promotion. k thanks.
Maybe I'm just super excited to get any new clips at all, but I don't think this trailer is so bad. I did like the first trailer better, but I'm guessing Netflix is trying to advertise to a different crowd with this one. The first trailer was for people who like psychological horror, this one is for people who like comedy. Looks like there's a nice mix of both dark and comedic elements in the show - I'm so psyched for this!
What a garbage trailer! Doesn't convey the theme at all like the first one did! Netflix should be embarrassed! Gonna be a great show but please do it justice by advertising properly
His name is Robert Pulson
It‚Äôs the Three Kings guy ! ‚ÄúWhere the hell did all this booze come from ?‚Äù
I'm sure the show will be great but yikes, this trailer sucks.  Whoever is in charge of promoting Mindhunter should be fired.
Bad trailer for a probably great show.
I like the dopplar effect like title
Anybody notice that this Oct 13th will be on Fridayyyy üëªüëªüëªüëª
David Fincher and Charlize Theron is on Producer of this show. Will be great.
Let's hope it will not become another disaster...
Silent Killer Soundtrack and a new David Fincher Show, already in love.
another buddy cop what a bore
feature length or series? either way it looks great.
Can't wait to see it.
It's like they googled songs with psycho killer in the lyrics and went with the first song they saw... fucking idiots need firing.
Enjoy the best
netflix plz adapt monster into a live action
I have one question...why trending

52 thousand views and it's on trending. Ya, ok. Nice ad YouTube.
What went wrong : the music is throughout the entire video and the tone doesn't fit, there's someone constantly talking, no breather, the scenes cut way too fast and there's no comprehensible flow. A trailer with mostly no talking and longer shots with no singing would've been better
Oh my god that is the worst fucking trailer...and that music? Dear lord I think I've turned off some people by recommending this. I'll use the old trailer, thanks.
Any other murderinos super excited for this??
waiting and waiting 4 days to go !!!! yayyyy!!!!!
It's beyond me why shows like this not get the hype they deserve.
wildly different trailer than one before. what's up with this music?
Been waiting for this one. Hope it is as good as I think it is going to be.
I can't wait
How much you paid them netflix
David Fincher, Yeah!
ugly trailer
Only on  Netflix Ha ! I don't think so
Wtf is the plot
who can tell me –∞ name of the song playing on background? pls
Is that harvey from suits?
Wait..no one told me that this show was a weird FBI Seth Rogen inspired comedy..I didn't sign up for that
That's Friday, yessss
I thought this was another Hannibal Lector show
Okay, is this a series or a movie, because it honestly looks like it could be either
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
You need to possess a high IQ to understand Rick And Morty.

You need to up your game, Netflix.
Are the Roman Centurion and Horus skins both available on launch for those who got the Gold edition or will they gradually be released after launch?
1:44 Ashraf said Glitch in the Animus so guyss i think this could be a hint about morden day ;)
This content should be in the main game, not be DLC for payment.
DLCs are not bad they revive a game and make ppl talk about the game more earning money and players in the process so for the most part there are good but there's a difference between an honest dlc and cut content that didn't make it to final game
Ever since I watched the hilarious viral video How the entire world was made, I guess I had been really interested in anything on the first few centuries where the Roman, Egyptian, and Persian empires were around. All of a sudden now this game has really peaked my interest.
Really excited for 'The Hidden Ones' expansion. \nI always love DLC set after the main story
i'm glad that I pre-order the gold edition then !! 100$ worth it 4sure !! thanks for hearing us UBI !!
YOU CAN FIGHT THE EGYPTIAN GODS?!
Will the seaaon pass be avaibllele on the PlayStation store
typical money greedy Ubisoft. If you have a DLC trailer for a game that hasn't even been released yet, then you can add the DLC to the main game and even extend the release date. End this Season Pass nonsense you've completely brainwashed most gamers with once and for all
So do I have to get it on day one to experience all the daily quests and god boss battles or can I always replay them?
this looks too awesome, i love it and cant wait for 16 days
Trials of the gods <3
Major props. The Season Pass for this game is actually harmless, thanks to the free content. I expected The Mummy(pretty much) stuff to be a Season Pass-only thing. But its not.\n\nAlso, I like that they're just going nuts with these time periods now. I mean really, the Egyptian Gods will be a threat? Thats awesome, and its used in a way that makes sense in the AC universe, a glitch in the Animus(I bet Juno's the cause of it).\n\nWell, Ubiosft's going to have to make an AC game set in Ancient Greek now, so the Greek Gods can be a threat. Or how about an AC game set in Japan, with Japanese Gods as threats, etc. Just go all out with the ancient time periods.
omg pls let the photo modus include videoclips! it will make the content creator side sooo much better if you are able to do own cinematics
Hopefully we can get like Japan or China next,show Asians some love man,and we could finally sneak around as a ninja lol
Can't wait
He looks life foseytube
Hoping it doesn't suck
Let me guess thier after king tut lol
I want to play as a female protagonist. Is this an option?
So is magic real in the assassin's creed universe now?
Did they liturally just spoil that bayek doesn't die and the ending in this is one big happy ending?
My guy. PC Day one, i'll be playing Mario Odyssey first but i'll be buying the season pass if this content is good.
Looks promising finally Ubsoft is sticking to there promise this games looks awesome
Ashraf's team should be the perminant AC developer team or at least takiong over the projects midway through for adding unique features and content i mean just look at black flag's features! this team literally changed the game for the better. AC2 still great though as a fan favourite game.
This looks really good and I have hope in AC for once
The game looks awesome and everything!! however....is going to be ever released to everyone the stupid mission locked behind preorder ? I was so pissed and close to cancel my preorder when I learned about that
I have a question \nThere's daily the nomads Basar, where you can earn daily a Weapon as Reward,right?\nAnd now my question:\nCan you get a weapon from a day where you couldn't Play the Game?\nSo that you can get every Weapon.
Already done the dlc, put it in the season pass instead of the game you havent released yet.
The most effort, time and relevant research  I've ever seen in an ac game
This game looks absolutely fantastic. And it's going to be hard to not buy it before I get my Scorpio Edition Xbox One X.
I don't know why after watching the trailer it reminded me of Price of Persia
Really, really not interested in a dlc that has mystical beasts.. thats not what assassins creed is.. originally I was getting the Gold edition, but I'll just have to pass on it. The main game will most definitely be a day one buy though.
I'm ready,willing and able
Only one problem... it won't run on my pc. üò≠
They didn't even launch the game & they advertise the dlc...
This video just gave me chills (in a good way) haha can't wait for it Ashraf!
Saw game add on theater scene today, it was gorgeous!
I hope they make a trilogy to this.
One word that defines these kind of developers, PASSION
Ok I'll admit, I'm still not gonna preorder or anything stupid like that, BUT this doesn't seem too bad and at least they're saying what all you're gonna get for the pass. Combine that with the fact that the lootboxes won't be purchasable with real money and this has me tentatively optimistic.
Horus looks nice  but Anubis armor would be better
I am jacks overwhelming sense that UBI is going deathmatch with this game I mean it looks like a all other game killer peace of EPIC goodness ... great job UBI
Let‚Äôs go let‚Äôs go let‚Äôs fukking go. Steel case edition.
Imma trust you now ubisoft but if you somehow or someway ruin this game I swear I will come to your office and go all out fuze cluster charges like if your a hostage
Will this style of music be in the game as well? Love the synth vibes.
I would bet both of my nuts that at the end is Liam Neeson
Ashraf Ismail sure has a beautiful smile!
maybe they should nerf the price in egypt - i.e where the game events occur - üòÇüòÇ
Love this game already! Won't be able to buy it until classes are over :(
OMGüôÄüôÄüôÄüôÄüôÄüôÄthis game is awesome I'm a creed member and I'm ready to fight,adventures,the story line,and above all to fight for justice and ‚úåÔ∏è‚úäÔ∏è‚úäÔ∏è‚úäÔ∏è‚úäÔ∏è‚úäÔ∏è‚úäÔ∏èüëèüëè
ashraf ismail ? you're the best thing that could have happened to save the franchise!\nat the moment it looks like that this will be the biggest game ever made after the witcher 3, or maybe better ?im serious. its more beautiful than the witcher 3 100%! but will the story be as sick as witcher 3 ? DLCs looking so great! pharaos! mystic creatures!!! man only the way this game looks. omg so beautiful. dont need holidays in aegypt anymore, just play this game. i hope the gameplay/story will be as nice as it looks so far.
Are these expansions free?
Gold edition here i go!
Bravo Ubisoft, BRAVO! This is how you do post launch content! All of these pieces of DLC are not an integral part of the core experience, we get a complete game for the basic cost (as if this is not a given.. well, not nowadays) and whoever is interested will get to have some great expansions that are well deserved to be paid for. And the free content is for some extra fun, as it should be! Also, Ashraf Ismail rocks!! I will be rewarding them with my hard earned money by getting everything they have to offer! I love AC, the setting, the new direction the series takes and overall how Ubisoft handled the game this time around! AC is back!
now this is how youre supposed to do season passes
THIS! Is how you lay out post launch content to keep fans interested and happy. Wish others would take notes.
I think there is nothing wrong with this game...this is made to perfection.Gonna be a epic game.
First i was skeptical about this game. But somehow now i am so hyped for this. Ashraf Ismail looks so proud of this game.
At this point I might as well give Ubisoft joint ownership of my bank account, smh. I NEED THAT SEASON PASS LIKE BURNING. TWO STORY DLCS, DAAAAAMMNN.
Props for the AC team and Ubisoft for telling people what they will get beforehand if they purchases a season pass. Looking forward for the game with a healthy scepticism :P
DLC done right. Thank you Ashraf and team, and UbiSoft for allowing this from a marketing perspective. :)
Can't wait to face RNGesus inside my loot crates bought with in-game money
It's beautiful. You have officially outdone yourselfs
I love this game already üòçüòçüòçüòç
Looks promising!
Epic Ac version
Platinum ? Here we go !!!!!!
This is going to be wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better than Syndicate !
DLC and the game isn't even out yet? How can I not think that they're doing that carving the game up to release it in pieces to make more money thing. Good to know that even if I shell out $60 I'm not getting the full game experience anymore.
So the animus is still a thing, then......
You told us there would be no content locked in Season Passes from now*!\n*Which was like half a year ago.\n\nMicrotransactions AND day one paid DLCs, no thank you.\nThe game looks decent and the place you've chosen for it is perfect but I don't think it's gonna be worth it considering all that.
You made this look tight
Take my money, idc I want it
post launch.....so the game is out already? idiots\n\npostlaunch in British\n(Àåp…ô ästÀàl…îÀênt É)\nadjective\nrelating to or occurring in the period *after* a launch
We want to constantly surprise our players - then don't go for the pre-order bonus BS, make all DLC free if it's integral to the main game (paying a little extra for something if it's a proper expansion pack is fine) and actually have a proper-length story with a rich mythos like AC1 & 2 especially like all the other studios that are determined to only see their players as wallets with brains - that WOULD be a surprise.
This game feels so about the brotherhood only i love it
this game is going to be killer cant wait for the 27th and ashraf is really proud for this game and im sure it will be wroth the wait
a bit less for a 50‚Ç¨ season pass or not?
Anyone know the name of the soundtrack in the middle that sounds like origins take on ezio family soundtrack from AC2?
ETZIO I MIss YOU
My god this looks incredible!
Looks like I'll be busy playing Assassin's Creed origins and next spring playing the new Red Dead redemption 2
Yesssssssss
Soaking wet.
The ancient Egyptians were Black Africans and this is not only disrespectful to my people but arabs have no right to make a mockery of our culture for monetary gain. We built pyramids and structures that will last the rest of eternity pay your respects.
So now we have gods in AC? Thanks ubisoft you sucks
Did anyone hear Ezio's family theme in the background?
GUYS DO YOU HEAR THE MUSICCCC?!?!?!! ITS LIKE AN EGYPTIAN THEMED VERSION OF IT!!! gooossseeebummppss and the game looks so promising
they should add like a survival mode o a very difficult mode, that will be awesome
Hate how this is cut content, but it's more sad ppl accept this. Where have the times gone.
Origin will unfortunately fail, Watch.
Ashraf Ismail, why did you brake this game to pieces? allah babah & many dlc done.
Are season passes sold separately as well? Or only with gold edition?
Wil there be online???
why does this have to come out the same day as wolfenstein :( Space out the games people..!
Can i just preorder the game with the season pass? I dont want the deluxe edition and get those good weapons because i wanna farm good weapons and armor
Dlc dlc and dlc. This is why i prefer piracy.
It's not free content if we're paying $60-$100. In fact, what you should be saying is Season Pass and Gold edition buyers will be receiving stolen content. Content that was intentionally removed or left out of the game, content that is supposed to be included. I'll pirate it and rate it zero stars from Amazon to Metacritic. You're greedy scum bags, I hope this game crashes and burns like Unity.
This sucks pee pee\n\nWell said, Joe
The only way gamers can stop this microtransaction disease is to boycott games like this. This is just unacceptable. EA already ruined Mass Effect, the Sims and Battlefield. No more!
So make sure the game dont do well.. Stop buying it!
just dont get the game
YEP ! Like certs in planetside ... if you want more spend money to get more
I myself am absolutely pissed off about this micro transactions crap! I refuse to be sucked in to pay to win shit. Joe I hope this is not the bottom line for this game. otherwise I will just hand over my hard copy when it's released to my friend and wait for the last of us 2 or God of war and abandon multiplayer for good. kills me inside to say it. I'm standing my ground. btw love the reviews.
Gaming in 2017-2018 is a fucking joke
On Joe's issue with the guns, the original Battlefront 2 had set classes with set guns (usually a primary and secondary) and that's it. Based on performance, you could get an upgraded version of the weapon you were using (Elite Rifle/Pistol) plus passive buffs. I feel like this system worked well and was really fun! This just may be my opinion, but having multiple guns in a shooter like Battlefield or COD, or in this case Battlefront 2, creates a gun meta that renders certain weapons obsolete. I would much rather have everyone have the same weapons, and be on an even playing field, with different modifications, than be playing against someone who has that one god-tier and only viable gun to use in multiplayer.
I won't buy another game that has Loot boxes. Overwatch was the last.
Battlefront 2 is looking to be just as bad as the first.... But somehow they managed to take the fun outve everything that made BFront1 actually fun for 2-3 weeks...
It is time for the end of AAA games. We don't need them. They have failed us.
I can already imagine all the AFK bots...
I don't know what to do about it ........ this sucks pee pee. lol!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is so fucked up. We need to boycott these types of games
If you get an average of 15 crafting material in every single loot crate and you wanted to get every weapon this way it would cost you $712.80 if the crates cost $0.99 and $1,432.80 if they cost $1.99 to unlock 12 weapons. Wow.
They can salvage this by doing a couple things, which I sadly doubt they'll do.\n1) Allow for the purchase/upgrade of all upgrade-able gear and weapons through credits earned after each match or by ranking up your account. This could require the credit reward to vary based on your performance in the game you just played, if they go with the first option. Or split the matchmaking to competitive and social to really vary the credit income people receive for how competitive they want to be against other people. This shifts the focus from grind, grind, grind, RNG to grind, grind, grind, what I want. I don't think a grind in a game inherently bad, as it can provide people for reason(s) to keep playing and working towards things, it just needs to be done the right way.\n2) Allow loot boxes and scrap to go toward cosmetic only purchases. Let these be purchased with real money or in game credits too. I'm pretty sure people will throw money at some awesome skins for their troops and heroes. Let RNG only dictate something that will not directly affect competitive gameplay. While I get frustrated with the RNG of Overwatch's loot box system, I can at least accept and be happy with the skins, sprays, etc have zero impact on the competitive play. Something I will gladly take over this.\n\nIf (competitive) progression remains locked behind an RNG that isn't like Warframe's, it's not worth it.
BF I no story mode.. pass\nBF II this shit ^^' pass \nI think I might never get to play another new Star Wars game if they continue that  trend ^^'\nFor years I hated mobile games for that stuff and now this greedy concept is killing normal games...\nGuess in the future, I'll have a looot of free time to spend on other things.
600 crafting parts is just to craft it early. You earn the guns normally through levelling the classes. I didn't notice how the class leveling worked but I know I had all the guns and definetly didn't pay any crafting parts for any of them
STOP PAYING MONEY FOR SUCH CRAP!!! that is the ONLY thing to do!!!!!!! \nLet em stick it up their....
welp im glad i only play F2P and indie games now that AAA games are just Cash Grab pay EXTRA to win\nill just keep playing the first game where i got all the content and base game for $5 lol
I like to play games before DLC was even made. PS2, PS1 shit.  That stuff's more fun to me than this shitty new era of gaming.
I once got a crate with three cards...and only two rewards. That's right once...ONCE...I received a crate with an empty card. I wish I would have screenshot it now. It's unacceptable what they're doing. But an empty card for something that you either work for or pay money for? That's just a big middle finger to the player base. Shame on EA for even allowing such a possibility to be coded into the system.
Which piece of shit fucktard even started all this microtransaction bullshit EA? or was it some shit with CoD.
Yoooooo joe. I didnt care for the game mode. Needs more freedom to pick ur own way. Loot box bs i wont he buyn this game. We have to stand up to this bs its gone to far. If we keep buyn shit like this soon ull have to pay for each death and each life$0.25 like old school arcades. Tht is their goal. Cuz fucking give me money. Im done with tht ea ill not give thm one more red cent.
I returned this game because of microtransactions. They can get bent.
Bet  you couldn't make this type of game
Guess I'm waiting a year+ for a possible good sale
I don't understand the 2k dislikes ?
has anyone read the deluxe edition? they literally say you get better class upgraded... look at this shit.. Pre-order the Star Wars Battlefront II: Elite Trooper Deluxe Edition and receive a range of bonuses, including:\n\nAccess to play Star Wars Battlefront II on November 14‚Äîa 3-day head start\nUpgraded versions of all 4 trooper classes (Officer, Assault, Heavy, and Specialist)\n4 epic ability upgrades‚Äîone for each trooper class\nExclusive Star Wars : The Last Jedi outfits for Kylo Ren and Rey\nInstant access to six hero and starfighter epic Star Cards\nKylo Ren: Power Reach and Solid Freeze\nRey: Far Sight and Deep Mind\nStarfighters: Enhanced Auxiliary Power and First Order ship upgrade\nInstant access to Star Wars : The Last Jedi Millennium Falcon with updated sounds and appearance
Honestly this pains me so much to say I will not be buying this game. I've absolutely had it with micros and it sucks but I honestly can't afford it and i'm gonna miss out on big games until they come out with my favorites that aren't using this poisonous model. I was so looking forward to this game and it is honestly deeply sad to say and do for such a good franchise. Thanks for all your reviews and honestly I was thinking the same exact things when I saw and attempted to play the beta. This one honestly draws the line for my future purchasing of games. This was the last game I was dead set on getting this year and it has simply been ruined by greed. On a brighter note thanks again Joe. Your videos and reviews have been awesome.
FUCK MODERN GAMING!!! and I just want a new Rogue Squadron game.
I'm glad I took up reading a few months ago. Not that books are more affordable than games, but if all I was looking forward to in the future was this trend of lootbox progression in all the new (even single player) games that draw my attention, I might be feeling pretty disappointed right now. Instead I feel liberated. I will not be a slave to this laboratory-mouse wheel orgy of ambiguous grinding.\n\nThanks be to EA for helping me save my money!
Yep, and now don't freak out :-q , if you buy crates, it also can be that it gives you some YOU ALLREADY GOT,¬†¬† LOL . First cheats are also confirmed. You know the CR 2¬† rapidfire gun ?¬† It 's like the TL50, weak shots but in a high cadency. So normally no oneshotkills possible. Me and some guy, we where in teamspeak, played strike mode, and both got oneshotkilled by CR2.¬† They came flying to you and , boom,¬† dead . No fight at all.¬†¬† Well, i already payed 59 euro at origin. This is no beta, it's a demo, no full game in beta status right ? Yep.
Dont buy the game dont let ea get away with this...iam not they can go spit!
Trash knockoff game that will die early because of the original getting multiplayer back.
Forza 7 is a bad example. There is nothing pay to win involved with it, nor is it ever essential to buy the crates. I haven't bought a single one and I have had the game since the Ultimate Edition launch.\n\nAlso, how come you never made videos for the shit Call of Duty has been doing for 3  years with supply drops? Not defending Battlefront 2 here, but this shit is not new at all.
Titanfall 2 has done it the best. No random crates, all weapons and gear are earned through normal play, and the only thing you pay for are cosmetics.
That's why I love Indy Devs they keep it old school put there hart and soul into a game with out micro trans BS! Another reason I'm enjoying the PSVR scene, a lot of Indy games not many AAA
I was waiting for YOU FUCKED IT UP!
I miss the old school unlock system. This is just another way to scam your money. Honestly, I'm almost about done with new games. This reminds me of BF1 battle packs = useless.\n\nWould you like a free game with your micro transactions?
Good god, at least with Warframe you actually know what your going to get if you grind. Well that's another 2018 hype train to cross off of the list...at least there's monster hunter world.
Socialism in a VIDEO GAME! Same points for all, regardless of effort! Do you know what that incentivizes? No effort from anyone.
i will not buy a single loot crate or any microtransactions in this game or any other game that has this system.
They need an actual progression system. Come one. Bring back normal leveling up and ranks. How hard can that be
old starwars battlefront 2 has even better user made stuff..
The weapons might cost more cuz it's the beta? (I'm not trying to defend this crap just saying you might be mistaken)
Lets not kid ourselves, mobile gaming started tgis trend that is killing the gaming community.
Honestly? We gamers deserve this. We keep spreading our cheeks wide enough for companies to screw us. The only way out of this is two ways: \n\n1) Gamers have enough of the bullshit and the game industry implodes in itself in the same way the comics industry did during the 90s, resulting in Marvel having to be bailed out by Disney after filing for bankruptcy.\n\n2) Gamers create a class-action lawsuit against any game that employs a pay-to-win system. These loot-crates are nothing more than a thinly veiled version of GAMBLING. Actual currency is being exchanged in the hopes of gaining goods on a BY-CHANCE basis. If that isn't the definition of gambling, then I don't know what is. Gambling is already illegal in many states. Since these games are also being played by minors, the FTC would have no problem cracking down the whip, much like they did with CSGO Lotto.
I some how got the secondary weapons for assault and heavy without using crafting parts. I think I got them through loot boxes.  Still shitty though. EA gotta fix this garbage, because the game is actually really fun. I love overwatch loot boxes but I feel no need to grind for loot boxes because they are not needed to play the game. Like I said EA fix this shit!!!
I was really looking forward to this game. Especially based on your early review. I looked like they had brought back something akin to Star Wars Battlefront for the ps2 and original xbox. These dumb microtransactions should not be allowed. We as gamers need to take a stand. We can do that by sharing *your* negative reviews of the loot crate system and just not buying the game when it comes out. Let them sweat a bit and have to rerelease a better version of the game. I HATED what EA did with the last Star Wars Battlefront game. They only know how to ruin games!!
No that is socialism at its finest
Its EA Joe, what did you expect?
This is pretty dumb, however you can get attachments and guns out of these crates, its just extremely rare..
We need another Video Game Crash like 1983.  The only thing that will bring change at this point is losses and bankruptcies.
GTA V is pay to win, and that game is fucking awesome.
Not buying this then
loot crates have fucked up the games we once loved. And i have a feeling that we will loose this war. As long as people who do nothing but put hundreds of dollars into games just so they can have shit to over power everyone, companies will throw the cancer microtransaction in. LET ALONE on how bad progression is in the game....like even call of duty has better progression than star wars bf2.......end the war, make games great again....
Thanks joe i wont but now
This is probably how it will go (I don't know the rarity types): \nCredit Loot Crate = All Rarity Types\n$$$ Loot Crate (maybe $1-$2) = 1x Guaranteed Uncommon and Up\n$$$ Bulk Loot Crate Purchase (maybe $10-$15 for x10 Crates) = 1x Guaranteed Gold Card
it's a conspiracy, devs are talking among themselves: '' well ppl got a brain so they dont want to pay for premium, hmmmm how can we milk the s*** out of them even more with a ridiculous sytem''shoulder Tap ''hey it's me free to play economy''. IN THAT F***ING IDEOLOGY ''F2P'' GAMES ARE GOING TO COST US MONEY AFTER THAT?geez
I hope EA will not put this loot crate bullsh1t in the future Battlefield game... :(
EVERYONE email EA, write them, Twitter them.  Whatever you have to do!
They should make unused battle points turn to currency. Wont fix the problem but it will award better players slightly
but how else am i going to get rapid fire on my tie interceptor and down an x wing in half the time as i would normally without a star card.
The only problem I had with Battlefront 2015 is that it was 1 era and it had no campaign. As you can see everything else was great and the progression system was 10 times better than this one.(The original Battlefront games will always be better though.)
well thank god disney brought back servers for the original battlefront 2 ill stick with the old game for now
In my opinion it's just a stupid business idea having pay to win in such game like battlefront. In my opinion the best it's to make lootboxes like overwatch, but also have some challenges to get boxed from quests, and have them just for visual customization, come on, all of us wants to make brutal clone guy with personal visual attachments that not breaking lore, yeah, everybody would look special, but its still better. Well, THEY CAN MAKE THAT UR SQUAD WOULD LOOK THE SAME LEGION COLOUR WHICH U CHOOSE AND EVERY GUY WOULD SEE THEIR OWN COLOR OF TEAM, something like this, its really cool, for example I'd prefer running as a heavy guy in yellow painting scheme and personal visual attachments from legion that killed green female jedi in forest of.... i dont remember the planner, or wolf like squad from Plo kun legion.\n\nIf u agree with me, lets go and assist this idea writing and creatinf it in a forum of battlefront 2. Stop being casual and wait till smb would do it for us, I DEMAND FORUM REBELLION FOR SMARTER LOOTBOXES SYSTEM
This guy still is around
Isn't it interesting? I do want this game to succeed, but I also want it to fail as well. Loot boxes belong on free to play games, nothing more than that
I wish there was a button that you can send one single message to the entire internet. ‚ÄúShut up about loot crates‚Äù.
Don't buy games that use loot boxes in full priced games.  Let the rich and the foolish fund these publishers for their Pay 2 Win games.
*E* N D L E S S\n*A* S S A U L T . . .\n\n\n\n...on your wallet!
C'mon Joe, anyone with a bit of knowledge about the video game industry knew what was coming the first time we saw that  EA logo plastered all over the trailers of this game. In fact, what was it called? Oh yeah, Star Wars Battlefront: EA
Cancelling pre-order, period.
Boycott this ish
Nein nein nein nein, HAHAHAHAHA... It's so hilarious
Love the ending LOL!  ;)
This sucks pee pee.
Lol, credit communism
Boycott
Microtans actions have ruined games now absolutely ruined
My momma always said,  Life is like a box of loot crates.  You never know what you're gonna get.
60$ dollar price tag on a pay to win game lol.
Won't be buying Battlefront 2. Played the beta and was instantly the turned off after navigating the menu alone.
Do more rants Joe there's so many games out with the similar shit
This bullshit is exactly why I would never be a game dev. Fuck EA and fuck all of the other AAA gaming corporations and their bullshit.
It doesn't matter what we define pay to win as. Making the objectives in your game a grind or harder to progress and putting out transactions to save your time is bullshit and the more we support it the closer we are to opening Pandora's Box.
I think they should have it to where it's only gun skins and character customization in the crates...
Ooh there's a debate going on right now on facebook about Forza 7 Loot crap and BOY! there are a LOT of people defending this fucking SHIT!!!! i mean HOW?? HOW does anyone sees this and actually thinks Thats cool, i'm gonna but this game! and they are arguin with if you don't like it don't buy it! ... it doesn't affect you at all, whats the problem! i mean JEZ that makes me angry, of course most of them are 14 to 18 year old guys who nows nothing about money and how hard is to make money nowadays... JEZ this really pisses me of, what's going to be on the future if this kind of people doesn't understand the damage they are causing by supporting this kind of practices... so sad
Remember people you vote with your wallet.
Dont get me started on how much of a letdown this game is going to be. The microtransactions aside, there are serious flaws in the game.\nAnd they also cloned real life guns for their blasters and not the good kind. The CR-2 for example is an exact copy paste of the calico sub-machine gun. Know to be one of the worst to ever be produced. Or the second specialist rifle is a clear copy paste of an M4. It even has a forward assist (why does a blaster need a forward assist?)
When they said no season pass, I was thinking great! They are making up for the garbage that was Battlefront....but nope, gotta be EA and fuck it up somehow. Let's throw in bullshit boxes. Typical EA. As much as I want this game it's a pass until it goes like 70% off. Sad thing is, all the sheeple and Star Wars fans are going to get this regardless, making game companies continue to do this shit.
I'm gonna cancel my preorder, thx Jo for the advice.
This looks like a serious disappointment and it's sad because its a $60 game in which it's game mechanics shouldn't have micro transactions so heavily integrated into it. The rewards system is abysmal you should gain more for doing better that's the whole point of competitive games. The progression suffers because of the micro transactions as you spend too many hours getting attachments for so little amount of guns.\n\n I'm telling you guys every game suffers negatively from micro transactions no matter how little it's integrated because even if it was for cosmetics you can't tell me  it wouldn't be more rewarding to earn it through gameplay. Its really the cancer of the gaming industry and I can't fathom why someone would indulge in micro transactions like this in their $60 game or even purchase a game that has them implemented like this. It's sad because I'm 27 and I love games been gaming since Super Nintendo and I can't imagine how games would of been like if they did this shit back then when I was kid.
I'm just gonna wait for the game to drop in price. I''l buy it when its $30
So glad I cancelled my preorder.
Apparently 2k people liked being Dicked with no Vaseline for anti-consumer loot crates.
2k dis Likes? Haters. Smh freaking EA
I don't care. I. Don't. Care. This game is so fun it doesn't matter.
In other words all you have to do is just sign into game modes and thats it. You can leave your system on while you do your chores and errands and you still get the same amount of credits no matter how many times you die or lose.

Dude,I was drinking something when you ask about getting something from school and your Nooooo's  are classic, i almost chocked and spit liquid everywhere....I can't take it I'm dead at pretty much every video.
There MUST be something that you got from preschool....üò•üò•üò•üö´üö´üö´...üò∑üí´...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I died when he sprayed her at the end
Is it selfish of me to say that I don't want her to grow up... She just perfect
Yeah she differently caught that cold from preschool it seems like my daughter has had a different one every week and she only started a month ago her first week she had one and I'm sure it was that little boy with that runny nose!
*There has to be something you got from preschool COUGH COUGH nooooooooo* üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2:40 that is so cute I forgot to count how many times I watched it.
This made me feel good and blessed üòÇüíôüíïüòákeep up the blessing seriously ‚ò∫Ô∏è
before I force you to drop out of preschool.... üòÇüòÇ
The Ending Tho When She Coughed üòÇ Keep Up The Great Content My Guy. She'll Have So Much To Look Back On & Laugh At When She's Older
I can't stop watching the dance üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Amahlah has a crush on a guy
Great great job! I really enjoy it!
AMALAH is such a beautiful little girl. she has matured (???) so much within the past 6 months. My niece was beautiful like Amalah at that age ( still is) and one little boy gave her his mother's ring!!!!! She was in kindergarten!!!!. Seriously Amalah dodges direct questions like a skilled politician. Maybe she will grow up to become President.¬† Nayele (although not in this video) is such a skilled and articulate communicator, she will probably grow up to become another Oprah Winfrey. You and Leah have two beautiful, adorable and very intelligent little girls.
Yep- I've been a victim of that Toddler distraction trick when my kids were young and now my grandkids try it on me ! They're so cute tho !
I died when she told you that you're talking too much!!! Almost peed when the water was thrown on you!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
My favorite part has to be the very end.... lol you are so silly...
That's all school is until about the 5th grade: germ cesspool ü§íüò∑ü§ßü§¢ Thanks for the laffs!
Hilarious! The cough says it all. Welcome to shared germs. :-)
I love how he broke charavter and everything to make his point about her only knowing the boys names.
Amalah is a pro now
This is the truth as if Jesus himself wrote it. Children only bring home illnesses and heartbreak from school. TRUTH!
Too cute. I really love your videos
Yup that's what they get from school
Love love love y'all.  Too funny!!
AS MUCH AS I LOVE BEING ABLE TO WATCH AMALAH GROW UP I WILL MISS HER PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE WORldüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠‚úåüèΩ
How could anyone hate this? They are so funny XD
She‚Äôs talking so clear now aww üò©üëèüèΩüòç

What an awesome way to end my night goodnight Cross family thank you for the laughter!
You should do a behind the scenes of the interviews! Would love to see what goes into making these videos.
Is she going through a stage
All she did was cough and you over here being a germaphobic!! Like you on have to spray lisol in her face like that!!
Watch out for them boys! üòÇ
Deep philosophical questions and blank stares will be the norm for now on. Threenagers are vicious!!! Good luck and protect ya life. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Omg, when she coughed & yo country tail started spraying the disinfectant... Kudos 2 y'all, your videos literally restore my faith in this wicked world. Be blessed Cross family!!! üëç‚ù§üëç‚ù§
Distraction killed me I'm crying!!!!\nHELP MEüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

La Guardia, when was the last time you had a conversation with another adult?
Distraction dance by Amala\nDemonstrator:la Guardia Cross\nComing to stores in your north American stores get it now 50% if you buy two CD'S NOW!THAT'S INCLUDING TWO WORKOUT CD'S,DISTRACTION SONG,AND THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFERTIME!*NOT REALLY JUST TWO MONTHS RENT WASTED*ANYHOW!üíøüíΩüìÄüìÄüíΩüíøüòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Im so bored
I guess Amalah has a lot of boy friends! Send her to school with the most messy hair do, and most ugly clothes, and I swear you‚Äôll never hear about those boys again !
Waiting for the day where its ‚Äúinterviewing an 18 yr old. Off to college‚Äù
I just wanna say ur a great comedian. The timing on the jokes in ur videos r on point and I laughed so hard at that last part where Amalah coughed
Wait uh until she starts cursing! Mothafu*k* seems to be their favorite! Lol!
I had surgery a week and a half ago on my stomach and I tried so hard not to laugh but damn...oh the pain! I guess I have to wait till I heal before I watch another video. Smdh
Call me crazy, but I got a baby b‚Äôgosh catalog yesterday and I could swear I saw Amalah on the cover. Was that her or do I watch too many of your videos?

Hey Amber, I was wondering if you could do a DIY version of Beyonce's MTV dress when she was pregnant (the second time) and performed Love Drought
Lowc
The bigger the hoop the bigger the ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶personality! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
So we just going to ignore the fact that we can see amber only wearing a bra & underwear through the mirror @ the background when she was showing us how the boots came out üòÇüòÇ  5:00-5:08
Windsor (a clothing line online) has a pair of shoes that are literally the exact same shoes Rihanna is wearing. They are $145 but still they‚Äôre cute
YES girl! Love this. So sweet so cool

Straight brain power a lot of human should learn from her if it‚Äôs expensive as hell DIY it I‚Äôve been doing that since I was 8yrs old when I saw something I like and wanted so bad but at that age I couldn‚Äôt afford it so I DIY it and what I wanted came true an possible with a lot of hard work I prove to myself that anything in life is possible well anyways it came out better than what I saw that I wanted people was like damn homie where you get those I told them I craft it FYI at the time I call it crafting so no DIY just crafting and now when I craft things I call it DIY
There were so many videos on these boots but i literally love watching amber because her personality is sooooo positive and catchy!

Hey I'm from New York and I would love love\nLove if your cosmetic line would be available in the US I'm so jealous of everyone who's able to get them! They look amazing. Love your vlogs so much congrats on your new line üíï
You make me SO EXCITED to have children! :) xxx
üòÇ She's up staged you! Lol!!  Yay!! for large families... take your time  give yourself a year in my opinion so you won't feel too overwhelmed... again I think that's fabulous!!
OMG those eyes!!! She is beautiful Anna.
What's the red patch in between her eyebrows? Is that a birth mark?
SHITTTTTT ANNA YOUR FIGURE & STOMACH IS GORGEOUS! Amazing body, amazing! X can I have it thanks? ‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíï
She has the peefect tiny nose ever
Omg I love Anna so much and the way she cares for her kids is amazing she honestly makes me want to be a mom!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
She is she the cutest baby ever! Shes gotten so much cuter recently, what a gorgeous little girl!
OMG girl you look amazing even with 3 kids you're still so beautifulüòç
Alessia's excited breathing/panting & little fake cough are the absolute cutest üíï
Aww you look so happy and glowing! And you two were so cute! Really loved watching this and glad you're back (dno how you're doing it though- amazing!!) <3 xxx
You look fit and healthy, Anna. :)
Tell Alessia I LOVE her! üòç
Her getting excited at the camera is absolutely adorable and funny
You are still sooo tiny! After 3 children you look amazing in my opinion absolutely no need for the gym at the moment!
I needed to hear this about being scared of having another if you think too much about it, I feel the same so thanks I needed that piece of mind that I'm not alone.
Another Baby? Ohhh yeah! Do it, Anna, don't be afraid. In the end, it's going to be worth it. As soon as you'll have your fourth child, you'll love it, won't you? A child brings so much love and joy into the world, every child that is born. I don't think you would regret that fourth baby once you can look into its eyes. And when they're older, these stressfull days will be forgotten and you'll be happy to have a table full of children and the adventures that a family brings. Every child of yours is blessed to have you as a mother! <3
You look perfect, 7 months after my first baby I am pregnant again and I didn't have the time and the discipline to get back in shape in the meantime :( now I'm carrying a life inside of me and feel ugly. And I'm 30, not 15...still... :'(
What jeans are you wearing? They look good.
You look sooooo good so much more important to eat and be healthy I think you look better now than before because you look so happy! Not fake happy either like genuinely stressed but thankful. Loved this video
Welcome back Anna!! Lovely video! Alessia is so cute!!

She looks like jonathan ... so cute
Dear Anna, you encourage me a lot  on those days, when life with my two little girls (3 years and 9 months old) is not easy breezy at all. And your we're not trying but we're also not not... really lifts my mood, because we also want to have a third one and you show the world that it all can work out in the best way possible. Wishing you all the best and definitally you ARE mom of the year. At least for your kids, no matter what.
When will the mark on her forehead go away?¬† You did say that Eduardo had it also right?
Missed you but am so happy that you took some time for yourself!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh my god she is way too cute she has the cutest smileüò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I vote for you everyday, you are the best mom!
How cute is Alessia?? Also, you look amazing Anna!
Alessia is so cute! Such a happy baby :) Makes me want to have another one! \nAnna, I know it's super personal and you will most likely not even see this question, but would you mind talking a little bit about body confidence after pregnancy, especially when it comes to being intimate with your partner again? I hope I'm not offending you with this question, and I'm definitely not asking for details or anything like that! This is just something I have struggled with ever since my first son was born. I miss my pre-baby body so much and I can't seem to gain my confidence back. Do you have any advice? Thank you so much for taking the time to make these videos! And thank you for always being so open.
Alessia's smile whenever she sees herself in the camera screen
I can't believe ur planning another baby. U and Johathon r like super parents ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
She is so cute!
Mine are 13 months apart and while it can be really hard work to keep on top of remembering things..especially with them both at school now they are growing up so close.Like best friends. Its definitely worth it!
Why the belly showing?
you look absolutely amazing. good for you and your healthy mindset! youre an amazing mom
Her little rant about energy, eating and exercising is literally meee and I have no kids. But seriously Anna, you're gorgeous no matter what.
Are you wearing hair extensions? üòÑ
You look amazing Anna! I always tell mummies that it takes a good 6 months to get back to normal in terms of family life. Everyone needs to adjust to their new roles, schedules and new normal.
Why are they moving?
Anna your body looks amazing!! Don't even sweat it you look healthy and great :)
You look so good Anna! <3
So glad you and Alessia are doing well! Also you look so wonderful!! <3
Alessia is so happy and her smile is so cute,her beautiful blonde hair ,she looks so much like you Anna a beautiful princess.
a lot of moms go back to work quickly because they have to.. you are very lucky to have the luxury of working from home, and making the money you do as vloggers. Its great too for the kids because they get to spend so much time with you, whereas a lot of kids don't get that. I stay home with my kids currently, I have 3. Only 1 is in school. But I have been back and forth to work at different jobs when we really needed the extra income. I'm getting ready to get to that point again, which sucks. I wish I could continue to stay home but maybe in the future I will be able to earn money from home. My youngest just turned 2 in August, so I really am missing these baby days. I don't think I will be having anymore children so its definitely bittersweet.
Oh Anna! You are looking gorgeous and seem so so happy, so happy things are going well x
When Anna said because I'm food üòπ I couldn't stop laughing oh I love you Anna xxx
Reminds me of emilia at that age doin the excited noises üòÇüòÇ cutie x
So happy you're back anna‚ù§Ô∏è
I can't wait until she's a toddler!!
I'm picturing her grown up sitting on the same couch with a baby of her own
Your belly looks amazing. It's so admirable to be that skinny after 3 children.
I haven‚Äôt watched the Vlogs since Alessia was about a month or two old because I‚Äôve been so busy, it‚Äôs crazy how much she‚Äôs grown and how much she‚Äôs Jonathan‚Äôs DOULBE! She‚Äôs his twin in baby form üòçshe‚Äôs adorable xx
Anna thank you for your new video !!\nCould you please share with us how did you sleep trained your children?\nAll of them seems to sleep in their room so well!\nI have two babies and sleep with them so I have no idea how to let them sleep in their own rooms. \nThank you so much! Glad you‚Äôre back & Love you!üíñü¶ã
Alessia is the cutestüòçhonestly don't worry about your weight you're so beautiful‚ù§Ô∏èI'm not even pregnant or have kids and I'm completely massive-you look incredible‚ù§Ô∏è
I really see Eduardo in her :) So sweet you two :)
My 4 children were close in age.  I preferred it that way, since I was already use to taking care of babies and toddlers.  Alessia is so adorable.  I love it when she makes that panting sound.
i love eduardo and alessias relationship, so cute
HOW IS SHE ALREADY 6 MONTHS OLD OH MY GOD
Awesome, video thank you for taking the time Anna
Awwww blue eyes. She's SO excited üòÇ

That the when you just ended the video I was like so scared I just like freaked out can you do it or throw challenge at 3 a.m.
When you said Annemarie bare but naked the name sounded familiar and that you were in Germany it all clicked because I'm reading a book and the girls name is Annemarie and was in Germany and it was about world war ll
I just jumped so high due to the last thing at the end like that scared me so so so much.
The music makes it way more scarier lol
I would have been terrified! You guys are so brave. I would have peed my pants. I jumped so many times!

You know, I miss when Annie used to shred the guitar on her earlier albums. I don't even recognize this as her work anymlre
Like a demented Julie Andrews song. Love it!
This chorus is horrendous (coming form someone who loves her with a passion) but the rest of this song is fire!!!!
Cara's voice is good :)
This is my happy pill!
I want to hear Mindless Self Indulgence do a cover of this
The beginning of the song sounds like that one Moana song tbh
I wouldn't need any pills to fuck her
Omg she is so sexy. Only girl I'd go gay for
Definitely my favorite so far from the singles released
Tasty guitar on a delicious track!  YUMMM!!!\nWhen it comes to St. Vincent, I cannot be satiated!
This song honestly not my style, too fucking weird
So far the album sounds like Annie trying so hard to avoid her feelings
This song is amazing and catchy as hell
I like how the song is kind of ambiguous about pills. The ending made me think that the problem isn't pill use -- the problem is the world
Check out LIVINGSTON CAULFIELD - Not in love (official music video) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyKs-DJJFvY
When I saw the notification I haven't read the title 'till the middle, so when I started watching thought she's gonna move... that's how I love u =)
Sounds like a blend of songs from Panda Bear, Bowie, Queen, Sufjan Stevens, and Bjork. Loving it so far üëå
One of the reasons i still want to live..
It must have a ‚ù§Ô∏è button 'cause I'm loving it!\n\nMASSEDUCTION's on fire üî•üî•üî•
Annie's requiem for a dream
I'm glad this turned out to be music instead of what I clicked on this for.
Holy shit this is the St. Vincent I've been waiting for
sounds like it belongs on masseducation
the 21st century's female Bowie.
Ugh I‚Äôm loving this new sounds so much
Wow. She just continues to put on bangers. So excited for the album!!!!!
Every other commercial on my tv is another one, and with each one the name sounds increasingly more like folk terminology for an affliction than a remedy.
Getting some real Marry Me vibes at the end. 4:13 reminds me so much of apocalypse song
I üñ§ Annie Clark. Girl needs a hit though. Hoping this is it!
Incredibly, fashionable talented woman. One of the best contemporary artists by far!
First one of her new singles that I love!!!!!! Oh my god
Today i have one of the worst day in work and this tune is what a need it to relax!
These lyrics are some Talking Heads-level stuff.
I want the outro on a loop. üî•
It isnt bad but i dont know what to fully think.
_play this at my funeral_
This song seems like to use for cheerleading or marching
I WANT TO MAKE SEXY TIME WITH THIS WOMAN NOW!
It kind of reminds me of Tune Yards
let alone find that kind of vocal range

this sucks so bad that im' done with youtube for right now.
Hello! My name is Malik Charles and im really just tryna get support for my music! I write music about Love,pain and life..please take a listen https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Ummmm this is so weird. It sounds like an ad St Vincent made. It is terrible and brilliant at the same time. The pills pills pills and a good stiff drink makes me nervous, but she redeems it towards the middle and the end with a classic rock structure. Maybe it'll make sense next to the other tracks.
Awesome song dead on commentary about how screwed up this society is and how we are all puppets of big Pharma.\n\nWhat one thing do all the shooters in all mass shootings have in common? They were all on multiple psychoactive prescribed drugs.
Am I the only one who hears life on mars at 2:50?
Annie, needs to do some work with Jamie Hince
i love this pic for.. reasons
Kind of Vampire Weekend 's vibe at some parts
Anyone else notice that Pink Floyd influence?
chorus is annoying, BUT DEAR GOD THAT SECOND HALF IS AMAZING! seriously that should have been the whole song. felt like modern day pink floyd
The melancholy finish is so Bowie Diamond Dogs/Low.
Not a very subtle message to this song.
I've never felt so ready for an album in my life.
Why have I never fucked on purple carpet before... POWERFUL st Vincent!
Pills to follow Prof. Oak back to the lab
I didn‚Äôt see that it said 'audio' so I kept waiting for her to move üòÇüòÇ
The outro interpolates ''Everyone You Know Will Go Away'', or the live song she played addressing mental health at David Byrne's show.\n(I am secretly SO happy for that)
I'm enjoying this new direction. It's not as heavy as the older albums. Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again. Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar. But I do understand sometimes people just don't dig something and that's fair enough. There's a beauty in difference of views and opinion.
I think we are listening an album about a beautiful talented musician girl who joined the high fashion scene and her thoughts about the things she finds ridiculous in it. Its just an idea though so we will see but It is ok beautiful girl, it is ok.. not everyone has the chance you have.. funny song though !
Sorry but it's annoying and generic
Pills pills pills to get a big stiff dick pills pills pills
i just nutted
Annie‚ù§
Sounds fresh AF.

Portrait of an Artist Selling Out
Weak lyrics, generic beat. I have heard three songs from this album so far and I can't believe she is trying to follow up her self-titled album with these mediocre songs.
this is beyond horrible !
I've really liked the way this album has sounded so far, but the social commentary has been lack luster. I definitely think you should put it in your music, but what does saying anything about plastic surgery or Fucking pills have to do? Yes there are plenty of people who take pills who don't need them, but I'm disabled and in debilitating pain and I need them to get out of bed. I need pills to wake and sleep and fucking walk AND eat because of stomach issues. Medical science has come a long way and I'm HAPPY for it. This song is catchy but the lyrics are a snooze fest. üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥
guys! been getting f ree gift cards everyday from here ‚ûú greensshort.com/giftcardsgiveaway?683888723
This will be a great show. Not just good. GREAT!
They float. They aaaaall floooat. And when your car goes into the water, it'll float too.
Did I just see my boy Cujo? And that Shawshank sticker? Ohhhh I'm ready for this.
I'm a simple man... I see anything Stephen King, I watch.
Now THAT'S how you make a trailer. Totally intriguing yet leaves out the details that spoils.
Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise) and Sissy Spacek (Carrie White) join forces with J.J.Abrams and thier master Stephen King
Wow Hulu with show is awesome \nbut  I would like someone or some channel to bring it back to The Twilight Zone and Tales from the Crypt that would be great
a trailer with Deadmau5 soundtrack...you have my attention Hulu
IS THAT DEADMAU5?!? I THINK SO. IS HE COMPOSING THIS?!?!!
Sissy motherfucking Spacek
what a time to be alive - Stephen King's Bank Account (Probably).
‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n*This Is True Love!!!  (Just ask Him)*
Holy shit, the kid who plays it is in this. It really IS gonna tie everything together.
Nice ! But only need access to Hulu from Canada you know, it can help.
Look out Stranger Things...Hulu has got you in their sights.
Is this related to Shawshank redemption?
Is this series lik free hulu or do we hav to pay?
Andre Holland = Bae, he's a talented actor too, ever since moonlight i had my eye on him.
even at $5.99 a month I don't want Hulu.  it's trash and I refuse to pay any amount of money for a service that forces me to watch commercials
Let me guess, this takes place in Maine?
An Emmy for Sissy Spacek?  She deserves one for this!
I couldn't have been the only one surprised to hear a Deadmau5 track on this trailer
What's the track playing in the background?
Soo happy its getting filmed in my town
Isn't Castle Rock the name of that place in Lord of the Flies? lmao
The viewers really win when Hulu and Netflix have to keep stepping their games up to compete with one another. Can‚Äôt wait for everyone to see how good Bill Skarsgard is outside of his Pennywise roll. Such a talent.
This looks awesome. Hulu did a great job with  11/22/63. The latest show based on Stephen King novels was The Mist and it was just okay.
I just want The Knick to return.
It's kinda weird bill skarsgard is in this lol
Newsflash: THIS IS HOW YOU PRODUCE A DAMN GOOD TRAILER!!!
Hulu is like what LoveFilm was to Netflix
Well it has my attention. Hate when trailers spoil whole movies or shows.
Let me guess, it is set in creepy town in Maine where everything isn't what it seems...gee, how original Mr. King.
When anyone writes something It's from their mind. From Stephen King's mind?
They're filming this in my town
I could watch Andre Holland cook beans and rice in a 3x5 kitchen for HOURSSSSS, I can't wait!
Based on the trailer, this movie gonna have some sick drops m8 and cubes
Does this link in with 11.22.63 that was a pretty dope show no one ever talks about
They caught me in the background lmao it's amazing the things they've done to my town though. They've fixed up a lot for this movie. Shooting is taking place in orange Massachusetts if you didn't know
Goddamn it. Make a fucking true Dark Tower show.\n*HOLLYWOOD, IT'S MAJOR MONEY IN YOUR POCKET A FAITHFUL ADAPTATION!!!!*
Castle Rock is a town in Colorado. One of many places King is fond of using for inspiration in his stories.
0:41  41 years ago Sissy Spacek performed Carrie in the adaptation of brilliant  Stephen King, this year surely will make a cameo in this series.
I used to live in castle rock, co
can we expect to see Johnny Smith in it?
Really looking forward to this. I'm loving this Stephen King revival, hes such a great storyteller and his books deserve great adaptions (we can just forget The Mist tv show happened tho).
even cooler when you lived in the town they filmed it in. walked over that bridge everyday for over a year
i used to live in Castle Rock.
This show is flimed in my home town I have watched it being filmed it's so cool!!!!
0:40 That old lady looks exactly like stephen king
deadmau5 on that score, definitely feeling it.
Marc Bernardian wrote some of this he‚Äôs perf
Oh no I live in castle rock
Mean this is not about castle rock in Michigan's Up? Pff...
Live in Orange, MA. Love what they did!
Its funny seeing the town you live in, in a tv show
Yesss and they filmed a portion of this in Moundsville, WV (my state) and was looking for background actors for it, I‚Äôm so excited.
I remember when HULU was free!
You Are Great - Motivation \nhttps://youtu.be/4R90ek4V7d8
The shawshank car at the end really did it for me, than one upped it with the you dont know what your dealing with do you? My theory about bill is he serves at shawshank because when he appears he is in one of those straight jackets. Guess i gotta get hulu now for this and runaways.
Wow. This is going to be great , I can tell.
Who can say no to this?
Hulu and Zikonightcore are my favorite channels , propably you dont know zikonightcore channel but it's  just Fier !!
That Deadmau5 track goes well with trailer üëåüèæ
I saw a Misery reference, a Cujo reference, an a Shining reference
DEADMAU5!!!!!!!
Guy from THE KNICK
Dude they‚Äôve got Pennywise AND Carrie? Stephen King Fest!
Giving up on Hulu. New interface SUCKS totally.
Andre Holland & Sissy Spacek... I'm there!!!
anybody catch the shawshank easter egg at 1:05
No captions?
DEADMAU5
Is Bill Skarsgard playing Andy Dufrense?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! dangit I have Netflix.

Deadmau5 sound mixing!
I really hope Carrie appears

*WILL YOU MARRY ME HULU!*
DEADMAU5!
What The Hell? Shawshank??
So this is the year of Stephen King?
Anyone notice the police car sinking at the end is from Shawshank?
Ah man I wanted a Fraggle rock spin off
I'm getting Stranger Things vibes.

Airtouch rotating makeup brush hsn
What about maybelline????
lol tati and better than sex
Tati, yasss girllll lol I use Essence Rock n Doll
It‚Äôs amazing that beauty gurus have an almost textbook memory for products they‚Äôve tried. Like Tati just rattled off mini reviews almost for like 100 products! It‚Äôs kind of impressive she remembers specific experiences with all of those.
TATI!! I would love to see you test out Ciate London‚Äôs new glitter flip lip. It starts out as a matte lipstick but when you rub your lips together it turns into glitter!
Hey Tati, can you do a review on the Luxe Glitz Palette by Jolie Beauty??
I love these videos!!
Tati? You don't have any Toofaced products? You should do a full face of Toofaced. üôÇ
do it again, any product loved it Tati xoxo from Canada
Tati, we need a makeup set up tour!!!! I wanna know how your organize your makeup drawers/ how you sort and store them.
You can buy Fiona stiles at their website
I love when you do these and go through everything, I bring a pen & paper to the table and write down things to maybe try. The only thing that kinda stinks is since you put the name of the products before you say whether you like it or not, I end up having to pause and rewind to catch the name again but that's okay <3 Thanks for a great video
I love you so much Tati ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
That glittery lower lash eyeshadow...and the red lip we and James love! üòç
I would like to see some recent skin care routine
Tati, can we get a perfume haul....PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!
lol I love when Tati came across the T** Faced products
Wowa, you are so beautiful today!
HI Tati, question, do you use like visine or something else to make the white of your eyes soooooo white?
Who's Taylor?
You look stunning Tati!
Please please please do a tutorial on your eye look!
Loooooooove your earrings where did you get them??
I hope you saved your throw aways. I can't remember the organization but there's one out there that cleans and uses the brushes to help clean ocean wildlife (like penguins) when there is a spill.
Tati. I do not see ‚ÄúDoll Lashes‚Äù by Lanc√¥me. It‚Äôs wonderful. I‚Äôve tried many also. It has a tapered brush that‚Äôs great.   Xo. üíÑüëÑ
Wishing I had seen this years ago before I started using Lanc√¥me ‚Äòs primer. After I use up the two I have, one was a back up before I moved and the other is because I forgot I had a backup, I‚Äôm trying the Wet & Wild one. I wish I didn‚Äôt need this step, but w/o it my lashes are invisible.
where better than sex at?
I love your lip colour ! Love you üíÉüèª
HOW do you even remember how they apply ... GOALS, goals, goals

I would love to know all the ones you like, especially the affordable ones! Thanks loveüíï keep slaying üíÅüèªüî•
Tati you should do this with eyeliners. Need a good drugstore one that doesn't run.

I like these kind of videos
TATI, you can send me whatever you don't want!! Lol
Love these kind of videos!
Did I miss CL? You did WTF on itüôÇ
How I've felt about too many men, Oh, you suck, but you're pretty. You can stay!
I need a video on that look plssss!!! üò≠üôè
Can you do a full face using Physician‚Äôs Formula makeup?
Lash paradise WAS so good... SOoooOo good. But dried out crazy fast and I don't even wear makeup everyday.
Tati‚Äôs whole look today is giving me ‚Äúholiday‚Äù vibes and it‚Äôs making me so excited for the upcoming holiday season üòçüòç
Where did you get the earings? Love them
YOUR LOOK IS ON FLEEEKK TODAY ! I LOVE THAT MAKEUP LOOK <33333 OMG
Oh good god I love this eye look, please tell me this is from cat's pajamas, I was already going to buy it but now I want to even more
I love declutter videos, they are a products review and a favorites video wrapped into one. Plus I'm nosy and like to see what other people's makeup drawers look like. üëÄ ha ha
got any of them give aways and do we have a chance of getting our hands on some goodies?
This was an awesome video! Can do this with lipsticks or foundations?
How the hell do you remember the results of all these!? Haha that‚Äôs crazy !
I would love to see more installments of these. So helpful.
My life goal is to have as many makeup stuff as Tati üòÇ
can u do a morning and night routine.
I think you should do a Tutorial Tuesday once a month. I would really love to see a video of HOW to get your eye shadow to blend. Maybe a eyeshadow for dummies, or how to pick the perfect shade of foundation. \nLove your videos. Keep up the great work
You can REALLY tell that she just likes one of the most affordable ones, Essence and then the OPPOSITE for Tarte ( basically a summary besides all of her critiques)
wow, you look so beautiful today!
Lash paradise has different package in Europe  ¬∞-¬∞
You look gorgeous in this video. Love the hair! Very Patrick Nagel...
where does all your makeup get donated too??
im trying to be patient, but please give us a pr unboxing
I like the revlon red lid formula but i didn't like the brush it was so scratchy.
Could you try catching it tho??? thanks¬†\nI died!
I'm living for her look!
You look stunning!! I love what you did with your eyes, and that red lip is perfect. <3
You‚Äôve inspired me to get rid of things. Thank you
I would LOVE if you did this 'spring cleaning' with eyeliners! I'm Asian, so I monolid horribly, and really really need a budgeproof smudge free eyeliner for my oily lids. It always comes down and makes raccoon eyes, and I've tried at least 6 different drugstore liners and none of them have done it for me yet.
Please donate the wands to wands for wildlife!!
who is taylor?
i love you but could you, like, make life easier for whoever‚Äôs helping you by not throwing stuff around and making them go after it lol
what are your opinions on merle norman?
I just ... ... ... anyone who has seen me watch WW or the mew GB knows the inhuman noises I made ... which were really loud.
Notice this act did not come before her Wonder Woman movie. This is because they needed to have her idolized by young girls. Then they make their move with their agenda. Mothers and Fathers protect your sons and daughters. Do not support Gal Gadot or this flagrant propaganda against your children.
This isn‚Äôt crazy....THIS IS LESBOS!- Mr‚Äôs garrison.
YES!!!!!! I CAN NOW REST IN PEACE.
For the first time in my life I feel envy.
lol at the Oooo okay, that burns. I-w-what is that? xD
WONDER WOMAN IS BISEXUAL THOUGH
Please help me what was that I found in my last video I'm
Everyone saying Kate's so lucky! No (I mean yes) but Gal is so lucky! I mean it's Kate Freaking McKinnon
I relate to Kate on a spiritual level here..
Double thumbs down and goodbye me watching Wonder Woman or Justice League.
Is Gal really that tall? ¬†Or is Kate really, really short?
Exactly, normal people don‚Äôt want any mentally ill faggots looking at the knowing the sick bastards would fuck you if they had the chance üñïüèªüñïüèª
Women trying to be funny is not funny
How I'd wish to get a kiss from Kate...
MADtv
showing how dikes sexualized everything ...finally snl you got something right....bravo bravo
Really? Ridiculous
Man, Gal Gadot just tasted fish.
thisis my proudest fap
Damn I wish I were Kate McKinnon.
DAMN GAL!
Oh, Kate..You lucky, lucky gal.
*WE NEED ANOTHER DYKE AND FATS SKETCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
Pure bliss and I'm not even Gay üòç
SNL is disgusting. So now all female superheroes must be lesbians? Great job perpetuating the stereotypes.
4:12 Kate got her motor running by Gal
In every sketch, Gal is obviously looking at cue cards.
I thought the make out session with Vanessa Bayer, and Kristen  Stewart  was hot, but this tops that for sure.. ‚ò∫
First face in Ryan Gosling's ass and now being kissed by Gal Gadot - she is lucky!!! üòÑ
Wow, they sure are lesbians alright... but aren't they also supposed to be funny?\n\nSexy, yes, but wow this skit was LAZY
I could think of a great Wonder Woman re-make, hell even the sequel
I, however, did feel something
People find this funny?  What part of any of that was funny?
I hope to find a male version of Themyscira .^_^.
This shit became more feminist by the day..fuck you.
Yep. This is what it's like. Every lesbian on the planet was watching sympathizing so hard it altered the rotation of the earth.
Lack of Hollywood cash they are having to reach out to good actress like Gal gadot ! Lol Mybe days of no talent will be over ?
I'll be in my bunk.
This video was stupid and disgusting.
I just came to laugh at the comments of triggered snowflakes.
damn im so jealous of Gal, she got to kiss Kate!!!
This shit was as funny as Saving Private Ryan...\n\nSorry, Saving Private Ryan was funnier.
This is such a realistic sketch its funny as hell
Dikes and Jew whores kissing!? SNL is going down hill
It would be funnier if the first guys to arrive were your typical 30 year old gamers who sit in their basement all day and play wow or dnd.
God I wish that were me.
Man, I was grossed out through the whole thing. I guess this means I'm not gay!
I don't like lesbian stuffs (except selected porn) but this was awesome
If she wasn't a lesbian before, she is now.
How in the hell did that kiss not make news?! I just stumbled onto this vid... I need another pair of pants...
What is that black girl lose her themyscira accent halfway through the skit?üòÖ
Did anyone else make the connection to the name of the island and the fact that the amazonians are all women?... Themyscira.....the mascara....mascara... Makeup?
Gadot should have went for  hair massage during the kiss.
So many people in this comment section are trying to criticize SNL for promoting LGBTQ propaganda, but if you were to look at the history of Wonder Woman you would realize that she was written as a bisexual Superhero and the skit was playing off of that. Also, can't a skit just have an LGBTQ character in it and not be seen as propaganda? They are just people, nothing to politicize so can we all just stop being so offended.
Kate got a HUuuuuGe lady boner at it!!!
Fuck when she said ‚ÄòI felt nothing‚Äô I would have crawled in a hole and died
what's with the dislikes?
I‚Äôm 2minutes in and still waiting to laugh...üòê
I would love to get kissed by gal
hey.. its fun to do this
Sexism at its best, you couldnt do this with 2 cis males hitting on the Amazonians.
I honestly couldnt decide wich woman I was more jealous of, Kate or Gal.
You know what else is evil? Ads that you can't skip.
A kiss to get ratings. sad
That one lady reminds me of a female version of Chris Farley. What a stupid loss that was... You will be missed, Chris!
Damn that just wasn't fair watching Gal with Kate!! Lol
Anyone else noticed one of them got the names mixed up when they said Megan and Dre? lol @1:21 @1:32
Women are not funny
Wait a second the word tits isn‚Äôt allowed?
Man this show is not funny..
Is it everyone or do we have a couple of hours. A half hour relationship lesbian relationships can be brief.
where u just kluupKluup drop the soap?? the bottle of body wash then put sweats on..
#GalGadot is too #hot 2 b #true, but she's so #fine, I wanna make her #mine! ;) <3 .. I feel #stronger now after watchin her #kiss like an #amazon! ...#sweet!
Isn't  that Wonder woman?
Holy lord, anyone can see that was a kiss anyone would like... yaozzzaaaa.... what a sight
The Lord of the Flies gender swap leaked footage
Kate you lucky bastard
dykes...
100% Certified TRASH...
Gal is so rediciously attractive
creepy
TRUMP 2020‚úåüèªSNL SUCKS üí©
Relateable.
Rhetoric sink proud front race perfect running accept.
Water water everywhere üòÇ
disgusting
fucking gross out right now
she is gorgeous...
Damn
Harvey Weinstein
Pathetic.
Here‚Äôs to hoping they make a male version of this skit with Thor üôè
Written by Kate McKinnon
I've had bare wanks over this
This was so cringe I almost had a spaz seizure
Need 2 shit on trump more.
Why is it when a lesbian or gay guy goes into a strait bar or gathering they thing they are going to hook up???? and just block anyone who say's hey i'm strait...
I'm old enough to remember when SNL was funny.
Even when Kate is dressed like a lez, she is still hot.
That awkward moment when you have depression, anxiety, anorexia, and OCD
The only yellow clothing I own is a single yellow sock. I wore it, though.
Maybe Dil is part of the photos üëÄ
I realise how lucky I am to have a supportive dad and go to a supportive school. They have assemblys and form lessons on homosexuality and mental health issues. ‚ù§Ô∏è
WOW FOOD WARS IS BACK???!?!?!!!
I like his nails ^^
Dan, you're so precious
I was told by my school u would get a councillor and they would support me because I‚Äôve only just spoken out about my mental health problems and idk what else to do because nobody is supporting me and I‚Äôm only young, but ur videos have helped me so much xxx
we have RUOK? day in Australia, glad to see that this kind of thing is international
Dan has an amazing nose
can we just talk about how amazing Dan‚Äôs fingernail shape is... \n\nBITCH.
Guys I'm gonna tell you a story and I hope it can make people not feel alone and I do not want sympathy okay so when I was 11 I tried to kill myself 3 times and self harmed I told some of my friends and somehow the hole school finds out including my principal she tells my parents and I went to a sicitrest and it really helped and today the mental health day I stopped needing to see her
Can you please stop being so attractive? It's annoying
PLS TELL ME THERE‚ÄôS ART OF PHIL PAINTING DAN‚ÄôS NAILS
Hahaha he listed Phil in the description as the cheese
Introduction to Korea, try korean englishman.
I got kicked out of my school two months ago, because I have problems and my friends left me, because of my problems.
Phil seems So Done with Life üòÇ
My shirt is BATIM which has yellow and black!  I'm supporting yet I have my own style for it! (Bendy and the Ink Machine)
The mental health services are underfunded\nOh tell me about it. They didn't even have provisions for ADD or ADHD when I asked 2 years ago. I'm no longer living in the UK now so I hope they've gotten better, but knowing Theresa May's administration and their hard-on for cutting NHS budgets chances are it's not gotten any better :/
Tell Phil not to open a nail salon anytime soon.
can we all appreciate how good they look wearing yellow wow
With all the yellow I'm still just getting a huge Winnie the Pooh vibe from Dan
üíõ‚òÄ This is great. As I've recently done a project on Anxiety as we are working on a mental health unit and I've been sorta using myself as example for how it makes you feel and how life is ‚òÄüíõ
41% of Transgender youth attempt suicide. Let that sink in.
Dan we love you no matter what üíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõ
my homecoming pep rally is thurs so i can‚Äôt watch the gaming stream üò≠
There's another Korean Horror that has recently made news because they are remaking it, it's pretty good. It's called 'Train to Busan'
When Dan said that therapists' are professionally trained, I got a flashback. I used to go to a school psychologist after my suicide attempt and she told me that I should visit a therapist. Y'know. The psychologist was fine for me, she asked me if she can tell certain things to my parents and stuff. The therapist didn't. After that one hour, she said bye and I had to leave. My mom went inside. The therapist told her absolutely everything we talked about :')))\nWon't tell anyone hAhaHA
fuck i love them so much
so im not vv smart about depression but i think i had it last year and idk if it has gone away because im not always sad like im very social and kind and smiling but my life is a mess like my siblings are so much better than me and i hate my body and my friends are not always there for me if i need them and i lost all interest for what i love. please help

You can truly see Phil's paleness in the thumbnail
*goes on Instagram*\nBoy oh boy Dan posted a pic-\nexcuse me is thaT YELLOW NAIL POLISH

This is so important so thank you for talking about this

Hello Dan, \nI don‚Äôt think you will ever read this but if you do I just want to say thank you. I had to evacuate due to wildfires in my home town on Monday and I fear that I may lose my house. This live show helped me to stay calm and feel happy. I thank you for that.
Dan, you and Phil should play undertale but genocide version
Yesterday I wore a pretty yellow shirt and I didn‚Äôt even know mental health day was that day until I got home from school

Remember, you can have any color nails you want, they don't have to be yellow or any bright colors <333
OH MAH GOD JESUS DANIEL YOU PAINTED YOUR NAILS ^w^ yes they look better than mine ever will!

dan you liking snape made me lose a tiny bit of respect for you
How about having Eddie Bravo on? He trains some top UFC/mma fighters and can promote EBI which is damn exciting for any bjj/mma fans. C'mon Ariel,¬†show Edgy Brah some love.
Please make the into screen longer next time
Ian McCall is transitioning into a woman.
Tony just rambles on....lol....love that dude though!üëä
Uncle Creepy spiraling...
MMA HOUR get Gegard Mousasi Fighting BELLATOR 185
DJ has been  gaming too much. He's calling Star Trek, Star Trak :D
Tony I went big bear Ferguson..
Ariel is so cringe. Stop trying to psychoanalyse the fighters, you say the same thing about the fighters you interview being completely different people nearly every single time. You look for depth where it isn't there.
It is what it is
Ian McCall is such a garbage fighter. He should be happy that UFC let him stay this long.
When you get home from Taco Bell 2:56:54
Man Condit is such a good dude very under rated...that Maia fight was a disappointment but I feel Condit still causes problems for anyone would love to see Condit vs Cerrone Condit vs Woodley Condit vs Wonderboy\n\nHope he's well off, dude was doing medical stuff? Sounds like he hated it cant go from fighting in the UFC and being top 5 to work a regular day job. \n\nGet in the gym Carlos everyone knows grappling is your weakness work on it and destroy 170
Show with sound begins @ 3:58
GooD To SeE HelwanI AnD CucuY BacK TogetheR <3
Can we please not have Ian McCall on the show ever again. Would be great.
Ian mccall wants 100k to fight on the fight pass prelims lol Thats a Lil bit of a reach dawg
so glad condits back. and so much respect to Alessio. awesome to hear from him and get some insight on how everything went from his perspective.
Tony Ferguson is so irritating and bodacious! Man, I can't wait to see someone knock this clown out.
Ian mccall is such a douche im gald he dont fight anymore
What's up with the lack of audio before 4:00?
Yes Ariel the pro Mcgreggor fans are very annoying. Good to hear I'm not the only one who can't stand them.
Tony is so intense he made a Starbucks story intense
Caldwell did not win that fight that's all he did was hold and stall
So Ian McCall basically is saying he pulled a wanderlai??? Usada came over and....wtf???
greatest my arse.guy beats no named cans, gtfoh
Man, Ariel checks his laptop too much when his guests are talking.
Tonys mind is bullet proof !!
Sensei Seagull is a fraud! He got choked & pooped himself!
Tony's been writing a book? What's it called Cat? And then you open the book and there is a picture of a cat and an arrow with the word Cat in bold. Then you turn the page and its another type of cat with an arrow and the word Cat!.  Just 50 pages of that. I'd buy it.
Tony the real champ
Tony straight up Ferguson
NBK IS BACK!!!!
Ric: Who said it was the best sub?\nAriel: OHHHHHH MMYYYYY,,,\n\nHAHA favorite part is when Ariel and Ric just talk. Both actually understand and know what is happening.
every time a bigger name fighter has a bad weight cut.....OMG we need more weight classes.   because you know that will end bad weight cuts.   Forget all the factors that come into play.
theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee mixed martial arts hour back in. your llife.  same time same place same blababalal until then i say peace......im outta heeeeerre
The mighty wizz bar.. really?
Tony Absolutely Ferguson
Tony Ferguson rocks!
lol @ ric thinking that push by GSP is real and that he's upset
Might need to re-upload this --- missing the sound first 4 minutes of Ariel talking :(
Was it muted in the first 4mim for everyone else too?
DJ and Max are class acts...
2:56:54 Excuse me!
slow day lets rattle conor fans... lol
too chinny for Conor
Sometimes Ariels asks the dumbest questions ever
Ian Mccall is ass
Tony is the real champ, Conor is a paper champ !!! Lmao üòÇ
Too many politics in this episode. I get it though. But lets not make a habit of it!
Stamp times, please? And how lazy that you couldn't even list the guest list initially - well, it's even in numerical order. And when they do the time they're usually erroneous. Ariel is the best MMA journalist and this is the best mma podcast. I do appreciate all the effort but just such significant things, but it's somewhat unprofessional. :)
LAS VEGAS WAS A FALSE FLAG
Was that a fart 2:56:54
Always good to hear from Frankie, also I agree Tony's demeanour seemed much more composed.
does Max have any idea how ridiculous he sounds when he speaks? Saying you know every 4 words makes you sound like a moron. I like Max, he's dope AF, just hard to listen to.
Straight up
Carlos Condit is the man. My fav fighters : Diaz Bros,Condit, Rory, Gegard Mousasi, and for sure DJ, TJ and Rockhold have a very well rounded skillset and a high fight IQ.
wtf no time stamps who dropped the ball
I keep thinking that max holloway is a really cool guy
So Ariel thinks the ufc's bantemweight division is the sister division to bellators version ayyt ariel i see you
2:56:54 Was that a cart from Tony?
Maybe in the 165lb division...AAAAAYYYYOOOOO!
What? Flying Suplex Armbar?? The next finishing move on DJ's list will be Zangeifs 'Final Atomic Buster'. You read it here first.
marissamal
DJ wants the easy route. Lame fighter. Retire already
Tony is gullible if he thinks Dana speaks the truth.
NY Ric better at pronouncing those names than Schaub is.
Mousasi the real lb for lb best sorry DJ.
I thought it was supposed to be RICS PICS not Ariel criticizing every pick from Rick. Rics picks is all I watch cause Ariel is beginning to annoy me.
no audio for first 4 minutes???
Dis, is not a terapy session - Ian McCall's Skype connection.
Ian McCall wants loads of money to fight but can't actually fight cause his hand is jacked LOL
Tony needs to take a chill pill lol
i did that armbar in big bear
Wtf ian hasnt fought in years nd he wanna get paid more wtf he just need to retire he a nobody lost to dj he doent want it to fight no more he should quit cus he aint top 5 nd he wanna get paid like he a champ no way
Condit is one of my favorite fighters and one of the most entertaining fighters I've ever seen. He's had a rough last few fights (as he said, the Maia loss was so ugly for him, he decided to leave the sport), but I think he's still one of the pound-for-pound best. Over the last half of his career, he's only lost to the best-of-the-best and only by the narrowest of margins. He was injured during the Woodley fight, Lawler was a razor-thin split decision, he avenged his Kampmann loss, and St. Pierre is St. Pierre. One weakness that he has is he doesn't fight takedowns enough. He's so skilled & active off his back, that getting taken down is almost a comfortable position for him. The problem is, even if he's not taking damage on the ground, the judges see it & tend to score against him because of that. Plus, he tends to brawl too much. If he had gotten a few takedowns against Lawler (nobody ever tries to take Robbie down) he would've won that fight and might be the champ right now.
Artem Lobov vs DJ. UFC let's make it happen
Tony vs Conor....Let's go! Hey....hello....hello....Conor? Conor?? where u at? :)))
Conor's are exhibition fights , ha, ha , ha good one Max
Condit is and has always been a fighter's fighter. Gotta love the guy, hope he makes a run and gets another crack at Tyron. #NBK
Tony is great fighter but if he's that hittable in first 5 min against Conor he might get ko'd.
Ferguson will desyroy mcgregor.
Tony might be weird and a genius at the same time.
The earth is flat
Saki vs. Roundtree is a dope ass fight.
I like Tony but he can be full of himself sometimes when he talks about how exactly he likes the fight to go down after a win.  Give me a break Tony....nobody wants a war like the fight you had with RDA.  And definitely you did not want to be mounted by Kevin Lee (you weren't getting out of that if it wasn't for the bell).  Just say it like it is Tony.  With that being said, you're a great fighter.  \n\nHope you get that Mcgregor fight.
2:56:55 ferguson farts
conor will destroy this guy
Caldwell breaking the record for most stoned guest of all time
Ferguson vs khabib this fight make sens for us!!üòÇüòÇ
LIST OF GUESTS PLEASE

El Cucuy. love the work ethic and your fighting style... you are a really great fighter, a top 3 lightweight in the world, but your striking game and movement. i can't see anything but you getting KO'd in 1 vs conor...and vs khabib...if Lee took you down that many times my lord the difference.
Max blessed will be the goat by the time he retires! His resume kills DJ's plus he grew up in the UFC
Lol tony is so lucky he loses weight so easy. Should be at 170 cheating realy
MMA is GAY.
I wish Condit will go into acting, the guy has something about him, I wanna see him in some movies
Im a musician of 30yrs. \n I must say Everlast's performance was VERYimportant, he grasped that and wasted nothing, he took that moment did Xactly what was needed, healing. Big respect to the man. BIG RESPECT!
You should of had DJ on longer
Lol Tony, delusional. Conor gonna kill him within 2. Lando Vannata had you doing the chicken dance and you think you can handle a combo from Conor?
Bloody Fantastic vid!¬† So happy to know that¬†Lance's 10 Meter Scream is next!!
I love Lance man üòÇ

Hi Tom,\nI Love you so much especially for the work out exercises. (Little less than Lance do). I know for a fact that you are not political person.

Lance and Sophie were gold!!! So funny
This video is way too adorable!

How does someone look that young at 43.. I guess getting creamed regularly is the secret?
Is he gay????
Wait toms gay?
Tom, you`ve become a little bit feminine.
I used to fancy Tom but he's too camp now...
i love him and i know hes wearing nice clothes and all but tom was a little whinny  you knew you where going to get creamed
Lance's snarky comments were killing me üòÇ next time mom VS best friend?üò¨

You are so lovely and natural in your videos its so refreshing!! I don't wear red...oh wait, i've got red on!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hello, my name is Jinny Anna. I am 14 years old and I want to ask everyone a question. How can a young ugly girl become a youtuber? üò≠
Love this Georgia! Would love a style/ look book style video! Or history or your style, fashion tips x
Really good video and enjoyed watching it
It's so lovely to watch your pregnancy journey. Love the pink and white t-shirt  I would totally wear that and I'm not pregnant lol
Loved this!! How long have you got now till Bump is a Baby? Bet you're excited!!!üòÅüòÅ
I loved this shirt u using. I would totally wear it too üòç
Hi Georgia! Loving the videos!! üòç I was just wondering if you could tell me where you got your big candle holder in the background please?! It‚Äôd be perfect in my living room!! üôäüòÜüëèüèª xx
Would totally be racing back to primark to pick up those pj bottoms but I already did my primark haul for the month, I think my bank would hate me!
I absolutely love this!!! Specially when you realised you're wearing red hahaha you're great and so lovely!!
Lovely :)
So glad to see Primark is in there I work for the company! Also so glad your s down to earth gal that always go for designer!! Well done Georgia on such a fabulous video , loving your bump xx
It would of been lovely if you tried the things on to show us what they look like and what you would pair them with xxx but still an amazing video ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Where is danny
üòçüòçüòçüòçüòôüòôüòôüòô Great video
Think primark and h&m do super long cami tops...primark do ones that are almost dress length, they are amazing for under shorter top
This is great to see! My bump has just started to pop out so I've been picking up a few bits of maternity wear but great to see some non maternity that will also work for bump! I've found there is a lack of maternity jumpers about so thanks for showing those especially!
Haha, you won't want to give your maternity jeans up, I had to put mine in the bin so I'd stop wearing them... they're so comfy! Xx
Great video Georgia - I just got the same red / tan M&S jumper a few days ago - already worn it twice! üëåüèª
Most fashionable pregnant woman I've seen! üíï
No stalker Danny since the last sighting..
Lovely remember to always do 'try on' as well. We are all curious how you look wearing these ;)
i loved that you went to all different stores and not just high end shops. as mums cant afford expensive things!! i lived in my over the bump leggings. soo comfy and kept bump warm as it always felt cold üíï
I love Primark!There are always so many lovely things to buy for yourself or your home!M&S do lovely Danish pastries and cakes which I am rather partial to,have you tried them?I am loving all your vlogs!Love the top you are wearing too!
Oliver: *cheeky assgrab at 9:14 *\nMe: *chokes on air*
does anyone not have a crush on oliver
Ok. I know I'm probably way behind the times, but why/when did the channel change names? I could have sworn that there was a (relatively) recent video where she talked about how she WOULDN'T change it because of the significance of the phrase It's way past your bedtime to her life. DID I DREAM THAT? AM I CRAZY?
I seriously think Carrie has the perfect voice. That is to say, if I could be Ursula and steal anyone‚Äôs voice it would be hers!üíúüñ§
''its like we're inside a jewellery box!'' that was so adorable :3
Oliver's monkey impression looked more like ZoidbergüòÇ
cant believe I missed the live where carried opened the presents :(
I actually went to see that in Belfast because we're doing the addams family in november \nP.s. I'm the granny \nP.s.s. I was the guy with the stupid laugh
Absolutely loved seeing you perform! Kinda raging that I didn't bump into you at all seeing as my work is directly next the Opera house.
So I watched this with my husband, and when the video ended his response was: Wait we have to wait for the Unicorn!?\nAnd now he is sad that there aren't anymore videos to watch till next week.
At the end of the tour, we need a full dance cover of crazier than you!! :D
anyone know the song at 0:25
EXCUSE ME BUT I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT BUM SQUEEZE
I'm so upset that you were in Belfast just weeks after I moved away for uni! üíîüíî
Now we all just wanna know what happened to the unicorn
I've just realised that Oliver reminds me of John Barrowman and now I can't unsee it. üò´
Absolutely loved meeting you in Belfast! Hope you liked the summer night fruit tea üíïüíï
I need to see the fully grown unicorn. This isn‚Äôt fair
Enjoyed this show so so much absolutely incredible!
The real question is, where on earth did that dragonfly necklace come from? it's gorgeous!
But what about the unicorn though? THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!!!
Can anybody find the jumper from Zara she is wearing and link it! Im in love with it! I see you on Friday night and I CANNOT wait!!! xx
why the youtube name change? I loved it :( xx
I saw you LIVE! I was skooked to the core. your voice is seriously amazing. well done!!!
It's the elevation is my new excuse! Hahaha
When she said end of the day ... is it ok if I sang ‚Äúend of the day another day over‚Äù les mis
Love the scarves! :) <3
Hey I was just wondering, how long do these musicals usually run for?
My ticket arrived last week so I‚Äôm getting more and more excited now and even have a sticker in my planner for the day 8 come to see the show. Yeah I‚Äôm a nerd lol
didn't even think to look for a catan app for my phone! Love the game. might have to go look for it now.
I actually can't cope that you are in Maggie mays like 2 minutes from my flat üôà seen you while you were here, me and my best friend had the best night, amazing show
Also your voice is a POWERHOUSE
you were amazing on saturday! love you xo
Ok I've always wanted to know the answer to this: HOW do actors in musicals not CONSTANTLY LOSE THEIR VOICES?!! That's so much constant stress on your voice omg
Anyone else find it hilarious that she was dressed as Wednesday talking about wanting a giant unicorn üòÇüòÇ
Scott has me wondering about his range. I had an oh snap moment when he took it up a free octaves.
But what happened with the unicorn??? ü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñ
I saw you guys in that theatre Thursday and it was amazing! 10/10
whenever you film onstage and show all the seats it makes me so happy :) you're my inspiration, carrie ‚ô•
I started SNORTING with laughter at 9:16 like OH MY GOD
What is the music for the signing clip?
The chemistry between you and Oliver is insane. Whether you may be together or not, you're definitely friendship goals and I envy it so much
Is the dear Evan Hansen cover (with you and Oliver) ever going to be uploaded? I NEED a full version in my life! üíï
I could watch HOURS of Carrie, Ollie, Scott, and the rest of the cast just having fun and singing their hearts out. I'm always so sad to see the vlogs end. I look forward to them every week and they always make me smile so much. Keep up the great work, Carrie! <3
Are her and Dan still friends??
Are.... are we sure they aren‚Äôt dating....?
Although they're in the same family, zebras make different barking sounds than horses do, so it stands to reason that unicorns would make different sounds as well. ¬†Something more lyrical perhaps?
Forget Oliver, I want to see more of the woman with the purple headband @6:40  :D
Maybe it's just me but you seem a bit wicked dressed as Wednesday, the character takes over and nice Carrie is no more.
So nice seeing the inside of my favourite place to work in whilst I'm across the water in Liverpool for Uni.
You where wearing that necklace today as well, very cool!! Where did you get it? And whoop for the Stitch pj!!
Love ‚Äúwatch me, Wednesday‚Äù xxüòÄ now which shop did you get that beautiful green scarf from??
I must admit, after being introduced to the new cast on Sunday night at the London Poladium, I wasn't sure what to think, since watching these vlogs I've found it quite reassuring that you guys are doing a great job at taking the show on!
It's like we're inside a jewelry box! üòç That is what it looks like!! I've always dreamed of being that little ballerina inside a music box... Carrie, you really were! üíï
so so excited for the addam's family in singapore!!!!
Oh carrie please do a full cover of somewhere over the rainbow that would be lovely
I'm loving the backstage dancing haha! So excited to see the show in Glasgow :D
I'm so upset I don't have the money to go to see The Adams Family \nI hope you have a really amazing and special time in Belfast! <3
Where is your long striped dress from please?? Xx
Can we have a full cover of one normal night pleaseeeee
I was at your last performance in Belfast on Saturday night! It was flipping amazing! \nI've never appreciated how pretty the Grand Opera House is until you pointed it out!
I was in the front row at the Thursday matinee in GOH and it was amazing. Thanks for a class show even if some of the guys in the orchestra pit got a bit singed by the rogue fuse from Festers rocket! Haha
I just booked tickets to see The Addams family in Glasgow after seeing it in Edinburgh I couldn't not see it in Glasgow!! I'm so excited
Was at the half 2 show on Saturday and loved it so so so much. Hearing crazier than you again makes me so happy!
I love you Carrie above and beyond
Carrie was 10 minutes away and I couldn't meet herüò≠üò≠üò≠
I was there on Saturday night... what a performance, it was amazing! X
What was the ü¶Ñ like?
I hope we get unicorn updates üòÜ
I was one of the very lucky ones who got to see you in Belfast! Absolutely fantastic, my friend went in not knowing anything about the Addams family and left a huge a fan! Was so surprised at just how funny it is, absolutely amazing show!!
I love that you are showing more video from rehearsals. Don't get the opportunity to see you perform, but get to see behind the scenes!
Love the snippet of blue Monday when you left Oliver before your signing
I grew up in belfast so this was a fun video for me to watch
I STILL get goosebumps every time I hear you guys sing Crazier Than You! <3
That unicorn is the biggest cliffhanger...
Can we please have a unicorn update? xx
oliver ormson doing the most casual pirouette ever is the reason I'm an emotional mess
I love seeing Carrie happy something about it just brings me joy on an otherwise bad day. My honorary big sister is killing it career wise taking on the book and theater industry it‚Äôs beautiful to see.
what's the deal with the unicorn, fletcher??? the people want to know
ok but did the unicorn ever get bigger??? asking for a friend...
Wait I'm in such suspense how big did the unicorn get??
I REALLY WANNA KNOW WHAT THE UNICORN LOOKS LIKE NOW!!
Omgg why I am being so awkward at that signing, I completely blanked and forgot to say I was coming to the Addams Family on the Saturday and that I work at lush, literally I'm such a freak at 2:55
What about the unicornü¶Ñü¶Ñ
Ey up, I saw that butt grab at 9:14!! Cheeky cheeky!
The moment Oliver said Slytherin my jaw hit the floor. Offensive much?
Ooo can we please please get a full version of Somewhere over the Rainbow? I've been dying to hear you sing it! Xxx
TRENDINGGG
YOUARESOPRETTYBEAUTIFULFUNNTANDTALENTED AAAAAA

And the Unicorn????
Are u dating Oliver?
Oli‚Äôs double jazz pirouettes üëåüèªüëåüèª
All these comments are basically the same thing üòÇ least Carrie has everyone's approval if she wants it üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs so funny how much different English (British) language is from American language if that makes senseüòÇ like Carrie says Beer Mats and in America we call them Coasters üòÇüòÇü§î
1:32 IM NOT IMPULSIVE (I'd never ask that of you)
I thought Rick and Morty fans were supposed to be of higher intelligence? They bee getting scammed
0:21 why is that the perfect representation of the rick and morty fanbase
The aspiring entrepreneur seems to touch the money and hold the nugget using the same hand. Not only the idiot will get the chance to taste the sauce for $10, he will also get E coli for free. Great deal!
0:05 you can see how the guy asked for his father to borrow the 10 bucks lmao
I had this sauce before. It was good, but not $10 a pop good. Particularly notable for the sesame sauce aftertaste that lasted hours.
I do not understand how can he sell something inside the macdonalds. Isnt it wrong to sell other things inside another shop
It's no scam, they got exactly what they paid for; what an inspirational merchant.
And people thought MLP & Steven Universe fans were cancer. R&M fans are super AIDs double cancer.
It's fake 4 guys set this up!
The idiots paying 10 bucks are stupid but that‚Äôs actually a good idea to get idiots to pay 10 bucks for it
i blame baby boomers for this shit
This shows the elites the true nature of people. They can watch this and justify there own actions since the first chance this dude got he started exploiting people, reassuring the elites that any of us they are causing suffering would have done just the same if we was in the same position the elites currently are. He had a chance to share valuable limited resources the sauce like people preach for the corrupt people to do but then we dont do it ourself at the first chance we get?
Somebody help me out, is this sauce expensive or rare or what?
This seshuan sauce has been blown way out of proportion
Half expecting Rick to walk in with 100 dollar bills in his hands.
Thank you Rick and Morty you proved our world is fat enough to pay $10 for a bit of sauce and nugget
It's my series arc Morty, 9 seasons morty
This sums up Americans in a chicken nugget.
How is he allowed to do this inside the place where it was sold
Capitalism has gotten out of hand
THE LOOK ON THE NERDS FACE JESUS MAKES ME LAUGH
Fucking retards
Rick and Morty fans: we're smart cos we watch Rick and Morty, the rest of you guys are fucking retards cos you don't understand the show\n\nAlso Rick and Morty fans:
The most American thing ive ever watched
-pays 10 usd for a nugget\n-eats it in one go
Please help me I am in great pain.
It wasn‚Äôt worth itüëé
That guy doesn‚Äôt seem impressed
That man is a genius.
He then sold them air for $20
What a fucking fool. The look on his face when he's asked if its worth it. Of course  its not fucking  worth it
Don't these guys know anything about hygiene?!
Its a scam a few people In on it and they buy and say its nice so other normal people buy like sheep
Is this in Canada
These rick and morty fans are so fucking cringe smh
you paid a man 10 dollars to dip a nugget in some shite sauce, if i was your dad ill slap the shit out of you and disown you for life.
Why did i watch this üòí
Is this a live action Ed, Edd and Eddy?
Capitalist at its best! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
you can buy szechuan sauce from the chinese down the road from me. they do it with seafood or meat
People in the comments will gladly hand over money for overpriced iPhones, celebrity endorsed makeup, cars, and sneakers etc but think it's dumb to buy a nugget dipped in sauce for ten bucks ......
The world is fucked.
Think for yourself, don't be sheep
Jimmy neutron in ten years
Stupid niggers. This is why you are poor.
Rick and Morty fans belong in concentration camps
That‚Äôs cheap as fuck!!!
Szechuan sauce? Tf??\nBruh that dude handles money and then your nugget and sauce. Good luck with all that faecal matter on the nugget, you probably got some other sauce too üò∑
ARE THEY REALLY THAT GOOD???
'Capitalism is the most efficient system at resource distribution'
You should all kill your selves
50% men don't wash their hands after toilet, so there's a 50% chance he touched a penis before taking that nugget.
Sooooo... would any of you recommend I watch Rick and Morty?
people are so fucking stupid oh my days
0:31 the look on that man's face just shows he wasted 10 fucking bucks on not even a 1/4 dipped chicken nugget
I like how everyone is crowding around him likes he‚Äôs the fucking messiah or some shit.
I don‚Äôt know why people are going mad for this sauce as it‚Äôs nothing to do with rick and Morty except rick referenced it in an episode and the promotion for the sauce isn‚Äôt even rick and Morty related
Look at all these troglodyte homunculi degenerates that the show itself mocks doing exactly as they mock others for doing.
That's a lot of Alexander Hamiltons
I'm selling a bridge if anyone wants it? \n\nFucking idiots!
Fair play to the guy hustling these idiots
All that guy could taste was regret...
Good for him. Just like people that pay $1,000 for a phone.
Well, time to stop watching rick and morty and associating myself with the horde of asshats that claim to be fans......
Lol the guy stuffs it in and crosses his arms like yes I'm a badass
:24 That is the face of defeated, beaten man.
What a stupid fucking video.
Rick and Morty is truly a show for intellectuals a fanboy shouts as he pays 10 dollars for a fucking chicken nugget...
That last frame looks like the face of regret
Fucking 10 bucks apiece for meme sauce
Bet you its soy sauce+ ketchup.
Goddammit Rick...

All these comments hating on Rick and Morty fans saying they can't be as clever as they think they are for spending $10 a nugget.....I argue the dude selling the nuggets is the biggest fan in the room and he's a fucking genius
He was trying to tell them they left their gas cap open. üòÇ
This is apparently not a wolf but a pet dog (malamute or husky mix) that got lost in the wild fires. If you live near there or know people who do please share and inform rescue organizations in the area. People might be looking for it.
If I was the people I would jump out swoop him up and keep him as my pet or if he has owners help find them
That's a dog. How can you not see that. Never seen a real wolf before?
dumassess its a husky ive seen wolves up close even pet them these people being stupid
Forgot to add that's a beautiful animal!!!!
Are they strong for not stopping or am i weak cause i would have?
people are stupid. why did this show in my feed? ugh
Regular wolves stay away from humans... It's obvious that the animal was probably a pet at some point and was abandoned or lost... They're so MEAN for taunting the animal like that!!! üëøüò°üò° they probably fed it, and that's why it was following them! Also, usually don't wolves come in packs? It's pretty strange to see one going on its own like that...
That is not a wolf!!  That looks like an Alaskan Malamute that appears to have been left and probably was hoping to get in the car!! How sad for this poor dog!!   I have had Malamutes for years and always get people commenting, Is that a wolf?  NO!!!  Not to mention, wolves are incredibly shy and would be highly unlikely to chase a car!!
Maybe the wolf is a spirit or guardian angel... that one of the family members lost someone that they were close to so the wolf is coming to say hi
It is not a wolf, it is a domestic Husky. Hopefully his owners find him...terrible sad.
Dude my Uncle has the Exact same Pet.Bro its a husky mix wolf and I feel bad for the poor thing these people are stupid tryna to get attiontion on YouTube this is a crying shame!
It's a dog.......... And this video has been used by anti-wolf media in France to demonize the wolf and increase the kill quota... So remove it please...
Undrcover cop, they were driving too slow, they got a ticket but the cop couldn't sign it.
Sorry to burst your bubble but the wolf was chasing you.
That‚Äôs someone‚Äôs pet, it‚Äôs a dog. You‚Äôd think after all the fires we‚Äôve had this year, instead of tormenting the dog to make a video, you‚Äôd stop and help him !!!!!!
i wanna murder the people in the car including the dumb ass baby. Am i psycho for feeling this way?
That's one of the littlest hobo.
WOLVES ARE NOT THE SAME AS DOGS
This is a dog
what you need to do is get out of the car and snuggle it
Not a gray wolf somebody's husky
Listen dum dum. This wolf is chasing you because it's hungry,  unless you plan on feeding it or sacrificing a limb to it then drive away because you're wasting all of its energy making it chase you...  the Ignorance is mind blowing.
maybe he is domesticated already.  maybe someone dropped him on road
EXCUSE ME SIR! SIR! EXCUSE ME SIR! DO YOU HAVE TIME TO HEAR ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOR PUPPER JESUS DOGO!? SIR! HE DIED FOR OUR TREATS SIR! THIS BISCUIT IS THE FLESH OF OUR SAVIOR SIR!
This is a husky not a wolf, someone ditched the poor thing
Wolf is like hey you forgot me
were ever they go hes going to track them haha
This is NOT a wolf it is a tamed dog which yes is like a wolf wolves don‚Äôt leave there packs like that to chase people they don‚Äôt hunt alone
It's a dog. I can recognize my own species.
He looks like he wants to play
Bruh that look like a dog not a wolf,looked like it was lost n tryna hitch a ride
stupid people should chkd at least if he was alerting u or he was hurt or in danger
Feed wild animals and they'll run into oncoming traffic until they collapse or get run over. Exact same goes for welfare recipients, but progressives want to expand the feeding until everyone is running into oncoming traffic. #SoMuchProgressiveLogic.
Thats a dog. Wagging tail mouth opened playfully\n\nWith the traffic instead of running away definitely domesticated
That‚Äôs someone‚Äôs dog!! Not a wolf ..
AWWWW\nITS\nSO CUTE. :,) I\nLove herrrr she‚Äôs so chunky! <3
I had a dream like this once
Rude! You keep making the poor animal run! And, that's very rare to see a wolf out in the open like that. Believe it or not wolves are more afraid of us, then we are of them! You were feeding him/her weren't you? You're even lucky to see a wolf! They are nearly extinct! Anddd you were leading in in the middle of the road, the poor wolf could've got hit by a car! It was obviously not chasing anything, it was trying to tell you something. They're extremely intelligent! The reason the wolf ran in the woods at the end is because he knew he might of nearly got squished by the beeping truck! And, doesn't it look to small to be a wolf? Well, just cruel... recording an animal nearly getting hit by a car? If you stopped someone would've came flying and hit the wolf... but, after all these facts it looks like a domesticated husky/ wolfdog. A wolf would be to shy to chase after a car like that. I would've stopped to check. Wolves don't attack people so, no worries. It sure looked like a wolf dog. It was probably dumbed, wanted food, water, and a home. Very selfish... poor little doggo/ wolf...
Or u just abandoned ur dog..hes following u
How dare u make that wolf hurt its legs just to make a viral video smh
Abandoned Husky. Too much in the juvenile manner for any wolf hybrid or wolf I've ever observed. Probably wanted food, water, and a home.
Screw you guys for messing with the poor dog you did not help it or anything hope you all crash on the way home
me : im gonna go to sleep early tonight \nme @ 3 am :
Say my name by Rihanna was playing in the background lol
Lol it's funny to watch an animal stupid enough to waste it's time chasing a car.
I would have stopped and domesticated it.
0:30 he looks before crossing gosh damn that wolf is smarter then some teens
Looked more like a husky looking for a home.
Crazy.. our DNA is being altered from silicon based to crystalline based and this is effecting the animals first before the human race.  Crystalline is love energies.  I find this amazing no matter what kind of animal it is.
That is not a wolf. It is a husky.
it's like be part of our pack!!!!
Some say he's still giving chase to this day...
He/she wants food and water or pups or a friend that needs help. :(
Lupin needs a ride back to Hogwarts!
Does anyone know who took this video?? This is my friends dog!!! Please comment if you think you've ever seen this animal or if you know the person in the video
My pet when I was about 4-5, was a grey wolf.
I KNO ITS A WOLF, BUT THAT WAS THE ONE TO KEEP.
Interesting, thou I would need some more information to understand what was going on. I do not know what kind of wolf this one can be because grey wolves in my country must have dark stripes on forelegs. Anyway this is nice video with beautiful animal.
Really really sadüòû I would stop and help the wolf/husky ,and figure out what's wrong. And how the people drove away from him leaving him just made him run for nothing,that's messed up. The video made me cry..... really disappointing.
Is not a wolf. It's dog !!!! shame on you ! poor dog left alone
Someones pet no doubt. Maybe theirs... Iooks like it was dumped and DESPERATE to get back with its owners...
He was cute But why didn't you stop the Car Hmmm??
The Killer Plot Twist !!!\nIt was actually this family's wolf-dog hybrid pet that they can no longer control,\nand they threw it out of the car and running away.
you were in a time crunch to go and do what? low iq bozos
Why the hell is this in the trending tab
Saw the baby - wanted lunch.
This is a  dod
This had to have been a domesticated hybrid wolf/dog and it's former owners had a car like theirs. This poor dog is probably heartbroken because it's owners (in it's mind) won't stop to get him/her. That wolf/dog doesn't look like it was meaning any harm. The poor thing probably just wanted to go home while it's scared and alone.
That really cool. Glad they weren't stupid and let him get close.
Can wolves be as good as dog pets ?
This is a domestic husky not a wolf!
Idiots!!! That's a poor lost dog üò°
Winter is Coming
That is certainly a wolf. No domestic dogs have large paws like that without being a breed that could not be mistaken for a wolf or vice versa. Only a select few dogs can maintain that speed with just over a gallop, none of which are the same size as a wolf, larger or smaller. The geographic area supports the claim of it being a wolf. What's more, I know of no domestic dog breed with a coat patern like this nor do I know of any with a straight bushy tail or a coat of fur that thick. If anything, this COULD be a wolf/dog hybrid but I am 90% certain this a wild Canadian Grey Wolf.
Domestic dog. Move on
BEAUTIFUL üåπ

I am 60 and watch you both
OMG YESSS! I'm so sick of every youtube channel being targeted to children and everything being censored and bleeped or not spoken about. I'm 20 years old and i struggle so hard to find people I relate to. and often even when I watch youtubers my own age, they still target their videos to children and do 'back to school crap and how to make friends etc. I was overcome with joy when louise did that big video about changing her channel and I think more people need to!!
Background music is too loud
Why wasn't Louise invited to the Janya wedding, tho?
The day Louise made the video announcing the change in her channel I hit subscribe so fast! I was so excited! Love when youtubers are genuine!
Louise and Tanya have never made a video together
I started watching Louise more after the end of an era. I loved her more whilst she was being herself- i could sense she wasn't truly being herself in videos before that. Love you Louise!!!

Three Men and a Little Lady! Fave film üòç
I got divorced, met a man on tinder and got pregnant YES YES YES LOUISE I LOVE YOU
Jim, most Christians don't believe evolution and Christianity conflict...
When Harry met sally!!
What does 'lowering the tone' mean? I'm in the dark here...
omfg the background music is so distracting, its like fake laughter in tv shows pls stop
i don't think the adam and eve story was meant to be like a direct description haha. most ppl take the view that the seven day creation thing is a v brief description of millions/billions of years of evolution. and the adam and eve story is to serve a purpose of telling the story of original sin and it explains well why the world can be bad. most christians believe that a lot of the bible consists of stories/metaphors that tell us something abt God. my idea of science is that is doesn't contradict religion at all, science is the study of God's creation! ^*^
I love that the content changes because we can grow with you and watch the creator make the cc content they want to create. It feels more natural x
This video looked so awkward. Jim does not seem to be on the same page/feel comfortable throughout this entire video...
Threw everyone I watch from Zoe all the way to Shane Dawson my mom has watched a least one video of ever YouTuber I watch. She has never complained about what they have been talking about especially how foul of a mouth Shane has. She realizes now they have all made me the person I am , she loves them all as well. She never once made me stop watching someone and it really helped our relationship and made it stronger with how much she trusted me. I just wish some parents would understand that , I'm not one myself...but it really helps the child trust me.
Eminem ripping Trump a new one isn't on the trending list, but this total garbage is......
Aww I‚Äôve missed these two together! üòÅ
Same thoughts re: evolution and Christianity.  Love Louise ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Irrelavant to the video but what lipstick does louise have on?
JIM What hairdryer do you use, do you use it everyday, what hair product/s do you use and do you style your hair everyday?
You look particularly handsome in this video Jim üòÅ
Was shookt when Louise said that Darcy was 6 years old!!! All I remember is itty bitty toddler Darcy üôä
I THINK THAT the only reason why Loise wasnt invited to the wedding is bcos of Tanya...
Pretty woman? The film??
my name is Jim too HAHA
Ohüòç Jim you are so handsome!
i love the film louise was talking about Talladega nights : Ballad of Ricky Bobby <3
See, the two of you touching on religion has made me want to see a video purely talking about faith and religion. Especially as you have a degree on the same subject. Xx
I really enjoyed you talking to each other even more than answering the questions - especially the take on being a realistic Christian and mature content. Good stuff.
Im a Christian and I believe God created the Earth and everything in it, in all its sciency goodness. Im not the only one, theres tons of Christian scientists. Be open minded about it, you will be surprised by your own wrong misconceptions.
the movie is Angus thongs and perfect snogging
Dear louise, \n                             I think you are a great role model. You might of made some bad choices but you are still inspirational because you have managed to make a life out of your situations. You now have a beautiful daughter so keep bing louise\nXx
Honestly I cannot focus with the music in the background. Maybe it's just me but it drives me mad
The vast majority of Christians believe in evolution. Religious truth and scientific truth have the same source and therefore cannot contradict each other.
Is the thing Louise said at the start monsters Inc. Xx love you guys
I'm 12 and I watched the lost condom video lol
On the science/Christian thing - my brother is a ‚Äòscientist‚Äô (degree in science and science nerd) and he‚Äôs a devout Christian - preaches a lot etc. I think it‚Äôs all about being open minded and tolerant of everything. \n\nGreat video guys :-) you‚Äôre awesome!
I totally forgot I added a question and just for the fun of it I watched this video, finding out you answered my question! How cool is that! Thank you lots and lots for the answer and for turning it into a conversation about porn, hahaha. Ohh and Jim, you pronounced my name best! It's difficult, I know. Just say it as you read it! Much love again, Sjarlie!
I'm glad your content has matured. I started watching you when I was 16 and I'm 20 now so I've been able to grow up with your content.
Science was originally designed to prove christianity. Just because it has gone on to prove the theory of evolution it doesn't and shouldn't effect a persons belief in any religion.
Music is too loud and beat-ey
Jim üòÇüôàüòÇ 14:33 ahaja poor Louise \nmaybe subscribe. but if you don't want to don't omg
the music was fucking annoying - clicked off
It‚Äôs so refreshing to see a Christian believe in something other than Adam and Eve, yet the way you explained it as thinking Adam and Eve is a metaphor is brilliant. It doesn‚Äôt belittle  the belief of Adam and Eve, but puts a reasonable sensible thought process to it.
You two are so funny together
Louise, I always thought you were younger than me, but we're the same age.
That end bit about subscribing to Louise made me laugh so hard.
I haven't watched Jim in years. I found the desperate to be a children's tv presenter vibe just too much.  Happy Louise has made a  reintroduction happen.
Louise and Jim are the best combination, neither of you beat around the bush with what you're saying and I love it!
Jim, you definitely have the gift of gab (a great asset for you).When are you and Tyler doing another collaboration?
What was the movie was Louise talking about?
I am proud for  my family to watch Jims channel.  He is a sweetheart and  very real, not like the others who put on airs and  fake
I am 10 years old and I watch both of them
When Louise and Jim were trying to call people my phone started ringing üòÇ
Would watch Jim and Tan in anything xxx such good videos!!!‚ù§
this is the best video
Is it bad , im 14 and i watch louises videos X
The ad on this video was your book on audible lol xx
I get my book tomorrow!!! So excited!
Louise has lost a good bit of weight go her
Subscribed to Louise after this. :)\nI looked at her channel AGES ago after a collab with Zoe or someone and didn't much like it but I guess that must have been towards the end of the old era. I like her stuff more now. Glad to have had her brought to my awareness again.
Right......... adult Q&A \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlet‚Äôs watch it anyway
I'm 14 you are both amazing role models! You make me happy! You make me less anxious! Your both great
HAHAH I want to hear Louise's story about losing the condom, anyone know which video that is??
Hey Jim! Please do more videos like this. I like seeing this side of you!
Barbera Streisand says that, is it funny girl or something?
I did love this video and what you guys were talking about! But the music was a bit annoying, I'm not sure if it was my headphones, but at times it was difficult to hear you guys :(
I thought I was the only one who believes that SOME of Christianity is a metaphor and doesn‚Äôt believe in Adam and Eve!
You two should make more videos! Enjoyed it immensely!
Is it talladega nights?? lol, great video :) x
That Ricky Bobby Talladega Nights reference at the beginning, though. :p\nLouise is so awesome haha.
I love this sort of content Jim! So ace üëåüëå
I miss your videos jim. Love when your doing collabs
When I ask my granddad anything he says youtube it.
No link to Louise's channel in the description üò¨
I also have the same belief about evolution as Louise. I believe in science, but I think God created it all.
I started my YouTube channel to get comfortable in front of a camera, I went to an acting school for tv and movies, and we were in front of cameras doing audition practice. So it was a way for me to get used to that. Now I love it!
Louise, my dad died when I was young. I think all the time about how in the future my kids will be able to watch my videos because I would have loved to have something like this of my dad. Im sorry about your mom, but I‚Äôm glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks about this
Love how real you both were in this, there should definitely not be more videos like this out there. X
Love Talladega Nights.
Three men and a little lady??? ‚ÄúMy hands? I never know what to do with my hands‚Äù xx
‚ÄúWhere can you go after someone mentions their dead mum?‚Äù that happens to me all the time. Whenever I bring up my dead mum everything is so awkwardüòÇüòÇ
Fun fact : I reasonly had a phone call from my son his school asking me about my job. Because my son said  My Mommy makes video's on the Internet  . His teacher wanted to know if it was on Youtube or if it was on a adult-site. So i gave him the link to my channel here on youtube and he reasonly used one of my video's called Respect in his class. He translated it to Dutch and told everyone that i was a great rolemodel to talk about Respect  and how to give Respect. And that the netherlands accepts people that speak there minds and how the people in the  U.S.A and  the people in England are more sensetive about those subjects. And he also talked about an other video from me 10 things you don't know about me  .. on Borderline Depression . He says that he loves the fact that i am so open to talk about this. And keeps on using my video's everytime i upload something that he can use in his class.
LMFAO when Louise was talking about the condom getting lost, Jim seems so uncomfortable with it. too funny. The ending seemed sooo weird
:))) lol
It's Madagascar 3!
PART 2 !!!!!
Beaches #9glitterpoints
Love Louise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ricky bobbyyyyy
Great video!!
RIP Louise's mum. üò™
This video seemed mega awkward to me..
i'm not going to leave one of those mediocre comments saying 'oh i wish that they were all close like they were a few years ago' because the reality is, they've all found their path in life now. some, successful authors and others working in the fashion industry. ultimately, i'm so proud of all of them. they're all doing their thing, and are smashing it. well done 'old crew' of youtube <3
I really think you should stop swearing
So Jim thought religious people aren't able to hear about or study evolutionary biology? That's interesting.
Christ she‚Äôs fat.
From a person who suffers with mental health issues I send you much love Simon. Thank you. üíö
This video is wonderful, thanks Simon. My mental health is bit of a dumpster fire at the moment and all these world mental health day discussions are catching me off guard, but I think are exactly what I need, if that makes sense. Midwinter was a book that destroyed me, and I didn't even have the personal connection you did - there's just something so vulnerable and beautiful about a book that expresses sadness that well. I read my favorite book (The Mill on the Floss) when I was going through a rough patch, and it just articulated things inside me that I'd never thought were important enough to be captured on paper. Anyway, going off on my own tangents now, thanks again for your thoughts
Great video Simon and thank you for sharing your mental health story with us. I absolutely agree that books can help with some mental health symptoms/ situations. I suffer from anxiety and depression, with some periods of my life the depression was more intense and others the anxiety was more intense. I still get anxious about work related things or personal relationship where I feel that I didn't do something right or good enough and will go over it in my head. I have learned that I need to debrief at the end of the day by having time to escape into a book and have a cup of tea. This helps me to get away for a bit and not dwell on things that can be irrational. I think this was a helpful video and was great to hear how books assisted you through some of your mental health situations.
Simon thank you so much for this video and your honesty in it. Books have definitely helped my mental health in terms of self help books building up my self esteem and resilience, but also like you say getting lost in fiction. The times when my physical health has been really bad I don't know what I would have done without books - I so needed that escape. Thanks again for this video xx
This was a wonderful video, Simon.  Thanks for your honesty in sharing your mental health experiences.  I often have suffered from hormonal depression, but never to the extent that is was an issue for me.  \nReading has been a lifeline for me when I have been through some pretty horrible experiences.  I don't have too many memories of before I was 11 when my parents split up.  Reading was my saviour then.  I was sexually abused for about 5 years in my early teen years, and later on my stepfather was a horribly abusive alcoholic.  Throughout all those years reading was my safe place - and it continues to the place where I feel least threatened by the world, where I feel the safest, where I feel I belong and where I don't have to do anything or be anyone but myself.  \nNowadays my own life is a lot less harrowing but my 31 year old son suffers from schizophrenia and my daughter has been diagnosed with clinical depression as well as fibromyalgia so mental health is very close and all around me.\nYou and I have vastly different tastes in reading - I am a popular fiction reader through and through, but your channel is such a welcome relief from all the noise noise noise that goes on in this world.  You are a lovely man and I always look forward to your name popping up in my subscription feed.  Thank you for your content and I wish you nothing but wellness and happiness.  Love from NZ
Lovely video Simon; I appreciate your honesty about mental health.  I needed this, as I am a bit shaky in the mental health department right now. I would like to hear your review of A Line Made by Walking.
Simon, thank you so much for this video! I've been going through a bad patch lately, and have been for pretty much this whole year, but I've found myself reading a ton lately and it has helped me so much. Books really can act as an escape and a way to not have to think about what's going on around you for a bit. I've truly found that books have helped me tons over the years I've been an avid reader.
Thanks so much for creating and sharing this video. I was completed sucked in, and enjoyed the bits you would have edited out - love seeing that stuff. On the topic of dealing with grief, have you read H is for Hawk? I own a copy, but haven't read it yet, but it generally comes up a lot on the topic of grief and processing change, etc. and comes highly recommended from the BookRiot gang. Anyway, I really appreciate this video, and generally, your videos are always a bright spot in my day no matter how things are going. Thank you!
Thank you so much for making this video and being so open. I work as a mental health therapist and I‚Äôm often talking to people about what they are reading and how it helps. It is definitely something people struggle with more than we know. I truly believe every time someone shares their story they make someone else feel more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Thank you for being brave.
So needed, great video.
This video is wonderful, I've been feeling down lately and your videos always cheer me up. It's wonderful to see more people talking about mental health.
Was having a terrible day today (just woke up like that) and this was great to see. Didn't even know i needed it until I clicked. Thanks x
I don't have a lot to contribute to the conversation, but I really loved this video.
Suffering from mood swings since going through menopause, I know exactly what you mean and you're right, reading helps!! Watching book tube videos helps. But I have phases when I can't read depressing stories or very suspenseful stories but there are a lot of other books I can read instead! Thank you for be so honest about your problems.
Thanks so much for doing this video and for being so open. I can relate to what you were saying about reading being helpful for your mental health and comforting you through tough times. although it's only this year that I have returned to reading & found book tube and it has a been a real comfort and life saver for me. I have read 80 books since May when I started reading again and I can't believe that I stopped reading for 7 years!!! Thanks again for sharing üòç
Thank you so much for this video!! I live with a mental health condition and at its worst it makes me very socially isolated (nature of the beast innit?) but books have always kept me feeling connected to the world, at least in some small way and have proved invaluable. I've always loved the Jeanette Winterson quote Art is an air pocket in an upturned boat,  that's what books have been for me. Also - sometimes if I struggle to engage with the world and have to retreat for a while, when I start to feel ready to re-connect I find spending some time knitting (other crafty pursuits are available! ;) and watching a backlog of booktube videos enormously therapeutic. It allows me that 'halfway house' of feeling like I'm hanging out with lovely people while not having the immediate pressures that socialising entails. So, yes, thanks, loved your unedited honesty - wonderful video!
Thanks Simon you probably just helped a lot of people.
This is great. I have a mental health blog and agree, although I am not a doctor, just sharing what works for me does help people so thank you. And thank you for talking about MH too! I would love a goldsmiths video and or a line made by walking video. All of the videos. ALSO. Can you tell us when the dates for the costa are? Like longlist and shortlist and announcements? I can't find it anywhere but I might just be being silly. Xxx
Thanks so much Simon, I found that really helpful. I started reading again because of grief, my daughter died. I found comfort and understanding in books. It helped me comprehend what my family and I was going through. I still look out for good grief stories.
This is wonderful. I needed this video right now.  Thank you thank you thank you.
Fantastic video. I've also had issues in the past, and often still struggle with anxiety, it's great to hear people speaking openly about these things. I also think books definitely help. I'm a bit of an introvert (like a lot of bookish people I suppose) and have a tendency to isolate myself. I went to a talk last night and Ali Smith mentioned isolation and reading, how you can feel alone and go and sit by yourself in a room, but as soon as you open a book that room fills with people.
Thank you for sharing your own experiences Simon .Reading helps me escape. üëçsleeping helps too. XXX
There was one book I picked up after my brother died that helped me a lot.  The best part of this book was being told to acknowledge your feelings and allow them to be...for a bit.  It was also good to have an activity to do, something that made me feel like I was doing something to dig out of my pit because the book actually has tasks to work through.   I still grieve for him 12 years later but it doesn't take me into the pit of hell when it comes over me now.  The Grief Recovery Handbook  by  John W. James, Russell Friedman
This is one of my favourite videos of yours. Thank you for addressing this difficult topic that's also been/is very present in my life, and for being so vulnerable and honest! I'm going to try and get my hands on a copy of A Line Made By Walking asap. Thanks for doing so much good, Simon! x
Thanks for sharing, I send you lots of love and hugs simon. xxxx
I wish I could 'love' this video. *massive virtual squeeze*
You are wonderful and life affirming and a joy! Thank you for all your vlogs but especially this one.  You said so much that i am going to ponder over. A couple of things about reading helping mental health in my experience: depression is exhausting and especially talking to people during depression is just too much effort. I crave silence at that time but as yiu say that can cut you off. But you can read, think, and in a way interact while being silent when yiu read. Also reading is like exercise or maintenance for the emotions and mind on a daily basis. We develop and hone our responses and capacity for imagination and empathy while we read and that pays off in hard times.
I recognized what I interpret as nerves near the end about sharing this, and I just wanted to say that I am glad you did.
That is such a touching story (I'm at the story of 10 year old Simon) and I'm sending you good thoughts.
Can I give this video like milion thumbs up...?
Wow, great video Simon. I loved reading A Line Made by Walking and Midwinter too and it's so moving hearing how you connected with them personally.
Thank you Simon for this video. I suppose it was really hard to talk about it, for that reason I even more appreciate you shared your experiences with us. Sure it will provide help/support to others. Thank you again :)\n\nPS. You are absolutely right, your channel  does bring happy moments :)))) (plus some serious added value as well)
A wonderful video thank you! I appreciate all you've done and said. Sending you love
Powerful. This is a video I shall return to again and again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you so much for your brave video. Really honest, vulnerable and important! Wanted to give you a big hug at the end :)
I am really glad you decided to upload this video. We do share some similar experiences, especially regarding grief, so, as you said, it‚Äòs so helpful to know you‚Äòre not alone.
This was a truly lovely video Simon. Thanks for sharing. Reading is generally speaking a source of stress relief for me, but as you said it can also be a balm in terms of finding others (whether fictional or not) that have had shared experiences. I have gone through one or two periods of intense anxiety and that actually makes it really hard to focus on reading. I've found that audio books are actually better when you have too much nervous energy so that you can take walks or run or whatnot and at the same time listen to a story. Stories can really help draw the mind away from negative loops and focus on something else.
You are such a good egg Simon, you really are. Talking about mental health needs to be continually kept relevant. I can't even talk about the things which have effected my mental health in the past ... you are very brave xx
Great video! And what an important topic!\n\nMy first major downward spiral was about 12 yrs ago. I had just discovered Audible and, wanting the biggest bang for my buck, I searched for the longest books with the best ratings. I stumbled onto Outlander by Diana Gabaldon and was instantly captivated by Davina Porter's narration and the main character of Claire. Davina's Claire became my best friend. She was smart and tough and I just fell into her story. Reading was definitely an escape from terrible things going on in my real life but also gave me a reason to hang in there through each day so I could listen to the next chapter at bedtime. That book is 40+ hours long so it lasted many many days. And there are a ton of sequels. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Claire saved my life. Eventually I made my way to therapy and a good doctor. But I'd never have made it that far if it weren't for that book that just hooked me. I hope everyone who struggles with depression finds a book, or many books, to fall into one day at a time.\n\nOn a side note, you are looking particularly handsome today Simon! (Swear I'm not a stalker. Just speaking the truth üòä)
Brave video Simon, and beautifully delivered.  I also like to be alone, but not lonely, and given my physical isolation, I feel like my Booktube family are my most important and easiest to access portal to a social life with like-minded people.  I'm in a beautiful place and mostly thrive on the isolation, but some days I'm so glad when you pop in for a chat.  You are funny and wise and self-deprecating, such good qualities in an imaginary friend.\n\nOddly enough, I've just begun reading a short story in bed at night before going to sleep and it helps enormously.  I'm currently reading 'The Day I Ate Whatever I Wanted'  by Elizabeth Berg and it's very good.\n\nIncidentally, I've also just finished Tin Man (recommended by you and others).  Absolute heartbreaker and I loved it.  Thanks for the chat.
Wonderful video, Simon. Hugs and more hugs.
Thank you so much Simon. This was a wonderful video! I truly appreciate your openness. My aunt introduced me to Will Schwalbe's beautiful book.  I've also read his more recent work, Books for Living.  He is a wonderful bookish companion. I cannot imagine a life without books. I find such solace in reading. Thank you again for sharing your own experience.
amen....to all the here's to's that you mentioned..and here's to sharing as best we can and here's to you simon for your generosity in creating this video.
Best video yet! Thank you for sharing your very personal story. I can relate. I‚Äôve had anxiety for a long time and my depression spurts come and go as well. I agree that books can be a form of escapism. Reading them as well as just wandering around bookshops works for me. I also have a rather large dvd collection if I need a quick escape fix. I also think is true that every once in a while we find a book that speaks to us and leaves us all a little less lonely. All my best to you!
It is an amazing gift you've given us by sharing your journey - calmly, kindly, warmly. With regards to the grief, A Year of Magical Thinking, by Joan Didion, made me realize I wasn't alone.
Thank you for sharing. I think we put so much emphasis on being yourself and uniqueness in general that we forget how important and comforting it is to be reminded that, in the end, we're actually not so unique. I am not the only person in the world experiencing a problem. Someone else has been there. You are not alone. Someone else has felt that. Etc.
Thanks for such a wonderful video Simon! Mental health is exactly what you said, something that we need not be afraid to talk about! I'm so glad to hear that you liked A Line Made by Walking. I was recently able to pick it up for only a few dollars as an ebook. I'm really looking forward to getting to it!
I don't even know where to start with this comment - I have been binge watching BookTube today and thinking about starting my own and I come across your channel at 1:30am - firstly it's lovely to find a fellow Brit, secondly, it's lovely to see someone my age and thirdly, I think you are basically the male version of me! ¬†(I should state I love ALL BookTubers, but meeting a Brit the same age as me has given me renewed hope that I can indeed give this a go!\n\nI smiled, I LOL'd and I teared up watching this. ¬†I haven't ben through anything like what you have but so much of your journey sounds like mine - I loved it when you said I don't like feeling lonely but I quite like being alone. this is something I have struggled to get other people to understand so it is refreshing to hear someone else say it. ¬†And I totally, TOTALLY have the paranoia thing too, in fact it's what caused me to lose a job 18 months ago .. well that an the panic attacks I was having almost daily (mostly due to the paranoia and anxiety I experienced in my role and at the place I worked,\n\nThank you so much for opening up so honestly and eloquently (tangents are fun). I shall stop here otherwise .. well it's nearly 2am now and I really should get to bed ..!\n\nPS - you have a new stalker ;)
Thank you for this heartfelt video. When my sin died I spent a lot of time with Jane Austen. I know those characters/people so well and they never let me down. I didn't want any surprises or mysteries just good writing and friends (well, Elizabeth Bennet is my friend!). Thanks again.
Excellent video, Simon. I'm sure that wasn't easy to share such personal moments but thank you for sharing your story with us. I think so many of us have suffered at one time in our lives with mental health, but it's so great to see so many people opening up about their struggles and breaking the stigma against mental illness. I can't think of any books in particular that have helped me through a particularly rough patch, but I definitely turn to books (and booktube!) as a source of comfort or distraction when life gets hard.
Thank you for sharing this video it really helped. I suffer with mental health and it's nice to hear that I'm not alone in how I'm feeling
thanks for sharing your experiences, Simon. I think videos like this always, always help! glad you decided to make it :)
Thank you for sharing! I think it‚Äôs hard to share something so personal. I have suffered with depression and anxiety for years. It‚Äôs been fine for awhile, but I lost my dad in December last year which triggered my depression. I have struggled all year. The reason I‚Äôve said this is because I‚Äôve tried to read for escape, but it is just not working for me. I‚Äôve been in the biggest slumpiest slump of my life since he got sick in November of last year. I‚Äôve read 30 books. I‚Äôve probably started and put down 100. It‚Äôs just so frustrating because I want to read, but I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm hoping to pull out of it soon because I agree with you that it is good for depression.
Thanks for such a personal video Simon, it's actually really refreshing. I've never really thought of reading and how it relates or influences my mental health before, but I now realise that I am someone who, when lonely or depressed, either obsessively reads or gets in the biggest slump ever. There is no in between. \nThe specific books I read also tend to influence my mental health, as some books really give me a real 'high' (mostly because they're just really good books), whilst others really depress me. And I don't even always know specifically why a book has had a negative influence on my mental health, so that's a bit annoying.\nI can see how this video (and others) may feel like therapy, as just reflecting on such things in my mind sort of felt like therapy, haha.\nI'm really intrigued by A Line Made by Walking, but I feel like I may relate to it more if I read it in a couple of years, so I'm in doubt whether or not to buy it..
I have the same issue. Some days are wonderful and my excitement is off the charts and others days its like the world is upside down. I know you were hesistant to do this video but I appreciated hearing someone say they have the same issues I do. Makes ya feel not so alone.
Thank you so much for sharing this video. It's really helpful to hear about others' experiences and how different people get through the difficult moments in life, however long they last. Big hugs from me and my cat!
Yes Simon, I feel the same way as you.  I like being alone alot but I do not feel lonely when I‚Äôm reading because ‚Äúbooks are my friends‚Äù.  Totally agree.  Thanks for sharing!
It's been really helpful to watch this semi-cuppa and a catch up/ reminisce with you Simon.
I suffer regularly with depression manifesting in self doubt, paranoia and manic spending.  Events over the last 2 years makes it hard for me to feel people truly like me for who I am or will hurt or leave me.  Recent health issues mean that more than ever my hobbies root me to reality and for this it is reading and art journalling.  I started Youtube last year and have done some book buddy reads and chatted with some lovely people.  I am so pleased you felt comfortable enough to be so open about something so personal xx
Thanks for this video. I work from home, which a lot of people think is the dream, and it is a really lonely üòî I miss out on socialising out of office hours because I have fibromyalgia which makes it hard to sit in a hard chair for a long time and I need my rest. Your videos really help me feel less lonely. I do worry it‚Äôs a bit sad that I feel I know you but it always cheers me up to see a new video from you no matter the topic... well I would draw the line at Simon goes hunting or something üòÇ I‚Äôm currently reading it‚Äôs all in your head. A guide to getting your shit together by Rae Earl at the moment which I think is meant for a slightly younger audience than me (I‚Äôm 40) but nonetheless is a good book on different facets of mental health and where to go or what to do to help yourself. Anyway thanks for the videos xx
Brilliant, Simon.  Thank you.
Thank you, Simon. <3 <3
My parents died in my 30s and i wasnt. ready.  I dont think anyone really is.  It wasnt books that got me though it was my Dads records the swing of Goodman and the jaxz of Coltrane and Miles. I wish i had Grief is a thing with feathers back then.
I completely agree that everything is spectrums, and that we should be open about our experiences when it is safe to do so.  Thanks for sharing, Simon.
Thanks for this video Simon, and sorry to hear about the difficult times you‚Äôve been through. I can definitely say that your videos - and those of some other lovely book tubers - have helped me an awful lot during some low times, so thank you! Also, books themselves have helped me to escape, take my mind off things and have sometimes reminded me that there are other people out there who have felt the same things as me, and have put it much more eloquently than I ever could. That‚Äôs the reason ‚ÄôA Line made by Walking‚Äô is one of my favourite books of the year too. That and the beautiful writing.
It's really amusing that americans get offended by this, while europeans love it. This is pure rock 'n' roll. A drunk former rock star who lost his once great voice screaming like Johnny Rotten and forgetting the lyrics of a song by his own favorite band, then inviting a random girl up on stage to sing and then ending everything stage diving. This is pure punk rock. Not some americanized plastic crap like Green Day.
Liam the last fuckin rock and roll star!
It's alright, he was just fuckin' drunk üòÇ It could have been perfect if he was sober. But it's not THAT embarrassing. People act like it was a huge tragedy ... don't be too serious pals!
He went straight for the chorus after the first verse and forgot there's a second one first, haha
Glad to see a bunch of positive comments about Liam on here. Lots of people at CalJam (I was there) were pissed off that he forgot the lyrics and Growl invited him on stage. As I was leaving a bunch of cunts were going Who the fuck is Liam Gallagher and why the fuck was he invited on stage. I'm from California but I've listened to the bands in the Britpop era and I love Oasis. Not a lot of Americans know how amazing the albums are, and the only song they know from them is Wonderwall, but Oasis records remain gold.
I love liam, but he couldn't have fucked that up any more if he tried.
Sucks up to the godsmack version tbh
Liam knows that FF concert is the only thing on the world you can do that. Biblical.
supposedly a big beatles fans... doesn't know lyrics to one of their biggest songs XD
Dave grohl went to the back because of embarrassment or rock n roll?
In fairness to the grohl he's well versed in school of rock. From voivod to supergrass/ gbh to oasis.... \n\nAnd in fairness to Gallagher he's just a lad! He actually approached me one night and made me feel like the fucking rockstar. Usually other way 'round, he's pretty grounded. Good bloke
O Liam √© bom demaaais! √â puro rock and roll, ele vive a m√∫sica, quando eu o ou√ßo eu sinto a for√ßa de um verdadeiro rockstar entrando pelos meus ouvidos
Super-great! But short pants are so passe
It would have been biblical if Joe Perry had knocked Liam out with his guitar.
Think what this needs is another guitar
Totally awesome, the best of USA and uk united on one stage.
Wow Liam is Rock n Roll.
Shame that twat Laim is in it
I was there... Liam is such a fuckin toolbag
crowdsurfing yeah!
So some douche bag comes up and talks in the mic ... doesn't sing.\nAnd this gets 1K+ thumbs up?\nLOL!\nFU
Zero Fucks Liam
Nice video thanks for sharing. please visit my channel for more videos like this \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6xNtP6pnfXXXXp7cvSTOw
How any one can watch this and not realize how badly Liam butchered both the timing of the lyrics and the lyrics themselves is beyond me
Mic cupping like a pro, Liam really fucked this up
Was hoping for something better. Dave should have done vocals...
Shorts and a hoodie? How old does the twat think he is? And he can't reach the high notes. And I don't care how hard he tries, he will never be Joh Lennon.

Liam reminds me of a softer version of Phil Anselmo in this.
Liam can't sing like he used to. How voice sounds like an old man trying to do a Liam Gallagher impersonation from the 90's.
Best part is I was there and HOLY FUCK trust me when Joe Perry got on stage\nI punched my friend in the arm and said This is gonna be fuckin AWESOME!
Why is he reading the lyrics it's a beatles classic?
This is my favourite Beatles song...\n\n\nShame Liam sung it
The funny thing is ppl here worried about he fucked up the lyrics. Hahaha.   LIAM.  A FUCKING LEGEND
When random crowd chick knows the song better than dude from one of England's greatest rock bands
Its a mash up but I liked it.   Not about getting it spot on exactly; having a good time is more important.
I love Liam but i'm seriously disappointed in him for fucking the lyrics up!!!
Oof how the mighty have fallen. He's too old to be doing the trainwreck dance. Be more like Noel. Classy, cocky, confident, delivers.
People taking Liam too serious are either Americans or boring.
It‚Äôs the 2nd coming....
this thing is a total nonsens haha
Lead guitar is so off...like liam...damn
I'm the like 1k üòé
Who TF doesn't know the words to this?
Didn't know gallagher liked aerosmith \nI know that the beatles originally did this
The video cut it off but right after this Grohl was laughing his ass off and just said into the mic yeah THAT was planned
Sounds like an old drunk
I fucking love this!  Kinda wish too see it again with Liam being sober haha but he's just being the rock n roll legend he is
Liam is the ultimate frontman, he just owns it
So talented!!!\nTrue Rock'n'Roll Star
Now we see how tough Liam is! He dares to come and present the song without knowing the word! Who else dares? 10/10
Pure Rock'n'roll Jam !!! Pure Legend(s) !!
That was rock and fucking roll
Sometimes shit don't go well and that's what makes it rock n fucking roll people. Enjoy it when it's great & when it's shit. Just laugh and rock out ü§ò
tan Liam <3
Liam fucking it up again.
gostosa
Jeesh look at all the sycophantic comments! Cringe.
Wrong lyrics!!!!
Legend has it liams still crowd surfing
HOLY SHIT
Hahaha
Manc cock
Did Liam get back alive tho????üòê
In Love
Iconic
Hi
Piece of crap.
Am I awake
This collab would just never happen
Pure trash.
Legendary!
Suena muy bien!! ‚ù§
Demasiado brutal
Fucking goosebumps
That was awesome!
F√ºr den Musikexpress ist es Fremdsch√§men,f√ºr uns ist es Rock n Roll...
Liam Gallagher is a massive prick. This was pretty shit. (I'm only here coz it's trending).
Warum ist dieser S√§nger so beliebt? Es ist eines der bekanntesten Songs der Beatles und er bekommt es nicht auf die Reihe sich den Text zu merken steht auf der B√ºhne als ob er ein Stock im A.... hat.
Can the Liam fanboys stop saying 'biblical' to everything? It's getting sad now kids.
I like this shit....Liam is 100% Rockstar...! Its real....\nI miss Grunge.....
Liam scum of the earth Gallagher. Move along Liam and let the professionals sing as you can't sing for crap and don't know the lyrics... can we say amateur much.
Liam Gallagher: Claims to be a massive John Lennon fan, doesn't know the words of Come Together smh
Liam was supposed to be a huge Lennon fan but he's f#ucking up lyrics big time. May he should have sang Obladi-Oblada or Maxwell's Silver Hammer. What a loser. What a tool.
Careful with the chicks Liam, you‚Äôll get in trouble again.
THIS IS ROCK N ROLL, SHIT MORONS
Am I the only one that feels it was kinda douchey that he had to have the lyrics in front of him, even more so to hold it up in front of the crowd? Liam seems beyond bored this point... His performance of Wonderwall at Cal Jam was sad, just blah...
Ladies and gentlemen. Liam Gallagher completely destroying a Beatles song.
What you don‚Äôt know what happened after üòÖ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XBs1wBMRDcY
Huge fan but this is awful
The crowd has NO IDEA who Liam was... sad state of music fans these days
Maybe try and get a couple of words in the right order.
Liam can‚Äôt sing for shit
Omg he doesn't even know the lyrics, he is supposed to be a big Beatles fan üòÖ
Liam ist ein riesen schei√ü Idiot.
You'd think for a massive Beatles fan and wannabe-Lennon that he'd know this song...
Liam Gallagher is a prick
ONE word - Disgusting.
KERMIT!\nOh, drunk kermit.
Looking at some of the comments on here - I just sometimes think not all Americans 'get' Liam Gallagher - in Britain he's like a God (for my group of friends/family anyway growing up!) loads of people commenting calling him a douche-bag or whatever - I don't think they get it - it's just supposed to be abit of fun and the guy was probably tanked up and just having a laugh with the crowd-surfing etc - long live the greatness that is Oasis! X stay young, love forever and don't look back in anger ;-) X
I was gonna be an all pro wide receiver But then I got high
‚ÄúI failed the drug test bc I was getting high‚Äù üòÇü§£üòÇü§£stay the course man hope they let yu back in. ‚úäüèø‚úäüèø‚úäüèø
Josh ma dude sometimes you have to hit rock bottom and be on your back so you can look up at your circumstances,find help and or pull yourself out,dust yourself off to become the best father,son,teammate you can possibly be...I'm praying for you my brother.To me your are the best wide receiver that I've ever seen play in terms of talent and physical abilities besides calvin johnson. So be humble.surround yourself with good people (people that can be an asset to you and your sobriety) and believe in your God given abilities.
Come to the eagles
Somebody has to say it! - How long until he is traded to NE? ....
7:27  Anyone know who that is on the back of Gordon's hoodie?
Going through same things dui in 2014 and still going but this helps me maintain
Hope my Bengals call and give you a chance
Great job Josh! Awesome to see a positive story in today's world! Keep up what you're doing bro! My BEARS could DEFINITELY use you haha..
I've have never seen a joint worth a million dollars
mannnnnn, i'll take him in New England in a heartbeat
I believe in you J.G.\nI sincerely hope you can become a father. Be blessed.
they need to make a full documentary series of this guy
damn son, this more than weed
Still love you bro! Miner set back for a major come back
Wait so the schools help athletes violate ncaa policy? But I thought it was all about amateurism and education?
From a long time browns fan i truly believe Josh Gordon had all the god given talent to be a hall of fame wide receiver and in 2013 he had 1600+ receiving 9 td's and went to the pro bowl, this has to be the most talented person I have ever seen literally throw it away, in the future I wish him the best but I think he will regret the decisions he made later in life.
Carolina go get this guyüôè\n\n#Another chance\n#KeepPounding
ill believe it when I see it
He would‚Äôve been on Julio, Odell, and Antonio‚Äôs level
So basically this is letting everyone know he‚Äôs going to the patriots next year
I failed the drug test because I was getting high. man this makes me change my opinion about him. hope he gets on the field soon. God knows the Browns need him
Good to see him working on him self ..
Bro holla at the giants we definitely need some help
Idk why but I get a Jon Jones vibe from this. I hope Josh leaves this behind and gets back to the league.
Weed should just be cool with NFL. Since 90% of them have brain damage retiring
I'm praying for this young man to succeed. It should start with being a good person first.
Iv done all these drugs that he said he's done multiple times before and never got addicted , he doesn't have a problem he's just immature
Can he play football next year?
*i want my Bears to somehow get him* üêª
What kind of camera does uninterrupted use ? Anyone know
This was awesome..See ya soon Flash..‚úåüèæ
I pray the Chicago bears get him üêª
I believe in you bro, always have always will. You still have the chance to be the greatest ever. #JoshGordon
All the best to him, he seems like he's really taken some huge steps forward. I really hope it all works out for him, from people I know in my life this is incredibly tough to deal with.
His drug use never effected his performance from what I seen not encouraging it when your making millions of dollars but I am not worried about him not being the same at all he got help\nAt the right time never showed he was washed now all he has to do is stay clean.
Give him a couple million and he would f up again
I hope he can make it back in the league!
The Bills need a receiver badly right now. ¬†Hope he gets reinstated and they take a look at signing him.
I‚Äôm rooting for you Flash! Keep working, get your life together and get back in the league!
Very powerful. A lot of these guys will lose their job and give up and give into the temptation that led them to lose everything in the first place. It‚Äôs good to see people make change from their past and give their all to right their wrongs. I hope I‚Äôll see JG on the field soon.
Come back to Cleveland young man .
I have faith he'll stay clean. And once hes out, come to phi, the Eagles need you haha
wish him the best i pray the brotha turns it around and heals himself football or not
Eli Manning needs you, the NY Giants need you #MakeItHappen üôåüèæüèà
I failed this drug test because I was getting high... Thats a very mature answer, I like that.
BECAUSE HE CAN'T STAY OFF THE WEEEDUH???
As a fan you never truly realize what someone is going thru...prayers up for JG üôèüèª
Fuck the NFL. Go to Canada. It's bullshit!! All this fucking trying to humble a player is bullshit!!! Fuck that!!! They play football!! They do not make laws, they don't do shit but play football. I am sick of Americans and their fucking contradictions. Expect more from a person who does nothing to impact my life than a person who can impact my life. I do not expect anything from athletes. I expect my President to not be a separator, congress to not be full of old white people, jobs paying people every two weeks or once a month. I mean real things. I wonder what did Kerry Collins have to do. What about Riley Cooper. Hmmm, yup, full of shit!
Man he looks lost. He needs God like us all
Alright so he said 110 days of rehab and the last snap chat he said he was at day 99. That was 16 days ago. Shouldnt he be out of rehab by now and submitting papers of reinstatement?
Stay strong my brother we all make mistakes keep the grind up don't look back
Man he went around the streets, knocking on people‚Äôs door, asking random people where he could find weed. All he had to do was knock on my door. I would have directed him to Johnny Manziel‚Äôs Twitter page.
He is obviously a smart dude with some internal issues. He has done no worse than most of the white kids I went to college with. They received a second chance though due to their privilege.
no, I failed the drug test because I was getting high taking responsibility for his actions, admirable. Keep it pushing Josh
It's crazy this made me really think and a lot of his issues weren't drugs, it was him handling the stresses of life. Grant it he didn't have a great start with drugs but if you listen closely you'll see. my college coaches taught me how to drink detox everyone thought i was a junkie, so i said eff it. It seems that was obviously his coping mechanism but no one helped this man, not even himself. To change you really gotta tear down the whole thing so you can rebuild. Everyone was giving him a quick fix, even himself. He looks great now and ability wise he's been a top tier talent. Hopefully he gets reinstated
You can see the effects of drug in his face.  Him using his natural supports like talking to his boy on the phone is real important. Glad to see that.
Best of luck Josh. Would like to see you back on the Browns, but more importantly would love you see you live a happy and healthy life and be an inspiration to others!
Give this man a chance!! He is a beast on the field and has shown growth off the field
I hope he's able to stay clean, anybody can get clean..the hardest part is staying consistent, prayers up to him üôèüèæüôåüèæ
Hey Josh, keep up the good work man.  You should give Green Bay a call, only thing to indulge in here is cheese.  Seriously though, I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre doing well
Make a move to the A, we will give you room to breath.  No stress no pressure.
Very well spoken dude, hope he can learn from his mistakes and come back even better
Much Respect, we all struggle but gods only gives his toughest battles to his strongest soilders
I want to see that kid do well.  The Vikings could use him.
I dunno if we'll ever see him in the NFL again, but its a blessing if he can get his life on track.  Life > game
Never give up! Great video ‚ù§
VLONE THUG
You got this Josh, you got this!! #onedayatatime
Giants watching like........üëÄ
Such a talent.
‚ÄúSTAY OFFFFF THE WEEEEEEEEEEEEEDD‚Äù
Stay OFFFF The WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDUUUHH
we all go through something in life and we have to overcome our demons and transgressions. I'm a Cleveland browns fan but and I would love to have him back even if not with us. i believe in given people chances. even if he has some give him another this may be the time he gets it.
God Bless him! I hope he overcomes his demons seems like a bright young man on the right path
i believe in you Josh , take it day by day and keep our heavenly father on your side.
It‚Äôs just weed wtf

He had multiple chances but keep fucking up
you cant keep blaming others for you mistake. SPOILED
He is an idiot. He has had so many chances already.
Josh imma need the name of these detox drinks
Am I the only one who was sweating the guy might fail a drug test before I even finished the video?? Thats all nice talk, but dude only wants reinstated to make money. Hes never seen his baby but wants to be a father? I grew up with countless guys like him, buddies who would talk about getting their lives together but never would. Always excuses. He will never stay clean for long. It takes a certain kind of personalty to conquer substance abuse. He dont got it.
Hes not changed, he's grown, but he is still expressing football priorities, so that shows his directive. I'm still afraid for him.
hope he gets a 2nd chance in the league.
hah what a joke.
This was/is strong...
Best at playing chess? Most people can‚Äôt even play
From the jump this video is dumb, the younger age learning languages better  thing is a myth.
Wait... so you're telling me I have to wait half a century in order to be decent at math... *sigh*
Such videos need evidence. scientific evidence or at least mention a research because this world has a media that is full of mistakes
Ok I will wait to get 50 and then deal with mathematics
Cant wait to be 60 or over so I can say whatever the f I want lol

Yeah I'm looking forward to having great math skills. You know, 30-40 years after school
why at the end did it say there's always one thing to look forward to then they all die
Well this wasn't nearly as depressing as I thought it would be.
Even though this isn't full on fact (or fact at all) this video is uplifting to people who are scared of aging.
I call bullshit on most of them
What a load of crap.
Dnt watch this just experience ur own surprises In the things that make you, YOU ! (:
ATTENTION :\n\nThe Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. THE PATH IS NARROW AND VERY FEW PEOPLE FIND IT!THE STRONG DELUSION THAT GOD SENDS IS SUNDAY CHURCH SERVICE, AS WELL AS THE PRIDE OF LIFE.PEOPLE WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO THEIR PASTOR THEN LISTEN TO GOD. EVERLEARNING IN CHURCH INSTITUTIONS AND NEVER KNOWING JESUS. NEVER HEARING THE FATHER VOICE.Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons DIDNT WE ATTEND CHURCH but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven.REPENTANCE,OBEDIENCE AND LOVE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. THE CHURCH IS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THEY ARE NOT IN THE INSTITUTIONS. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!! ACTS 7:48\n\nBE YE SEPARATE FROM THE WORLD!! BE YE SEPERATE FROM THE LOVERS OF THIS WORLD!

So these are just averages, you can‚Äôt really take anything from this video, at all
Well, damn, I'm 24 so I guess it's all downhill now.
Highest satisfaction at 23? That was the lowest point of my life.
Age is just a number or you can  ask my mom, who against all odds , came to this country, learn a new language at 44, met the man of her dreams at 46, got an incredible job offer at 66, at 77 yrs old my mom is still going strong!!\nstill works her full time job ( by choice), and has More aspirations than ever.\nabove all she is very grateful woman for what she  has done for  her life  and ours .\nage is just a number.
lmao the happiest is 23 years old, usually when people graduate college
I thought at the end it was going to say No matter how old you are...we are all going to die
Jesus goddamn Christ! Can I go one day without worrying about my future?!
No matter how old you are... remember, that one day, you WILL die.  Have a nice life :)
Well this brought my self esteem down

Who makes such stupid videos?
Shitposting.
Will you please please please do a review on 'American Satan' when it comes out. I'm positive it's gunna suck but I'd like to hear your thoughts on it and if it's worth my time.
I'm so glad you loved this movie as much as I did, it's definitely my favourite movie of 2017
I loved the movie. The art and cinematography is amazing. But I do believe it's a bit stretched out. Lots of just waiting around, a bit too long to concentrate on (maybe because I saw it at 10pm and was tired.)
If this guy pulls off a successful DOOM movie I think my faith in this medium will be restored.
Harrison Ford was perfect in episode seven. For what it was supposed to be. It wasn't eh, it was Han. It's probably one of the reasons Ford really doesn't like that character, because he has to act somewhat cheesy and at times kind of stupid. His performance in Crystal Skull was eh.
From an audio/visual perspective this movie is the apex of what film has done so far.
ADAM IM UPSET BLADE RUNNER ISNT DOING GOOD AT THE BOX OFFICE IM GOING TO WATCH IT 3 MORE TIMES
I recently watched Arrival for the first time and I can say with absolute certainty that Denis Villeneuve is the best new filmmaker working today. I didn't think I'd be saying that but after watching Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario and now, Arrival, there's no doubt in my mind. Arrival was smart, emotional and spellbinding and did something that is rare in mainstream movies; It provoked my thoughts. I can't wait to see Blade Runner 2049.
Funny I found the first one much more enjoyable and better paced than the new one. I actually had moments where I had to keep me awake in the cinema because I was nearly falling asleep because it was not only long but so slow paced like every scene. Even now that I am nearly complettly asleep I have trouble turning of the original but just one hour ago I ad real trouble not to fall asleep. Also the characters where much better. Especially this, whats his face? The guy who bought tyrell just sucked and I was happy when he was out of frame. He was okay but damn Tyrell was a genius this is just a Chickenhead of a rich dude.\n\nBut than that is how it is everyone expierence so I see YMS points and I consider them fair.
Maybe the engineers from Prometheus / Alien Covenant are replicants that created the aliens so that replicants could kill off all humans.
I nearly didn't see this on the basis that I didn't like the original Blade Runner, but the overwhelmingly positive reviews I've read/heard from reviewers and publications I trust and close friends swayed my opinion. So glad I did. Sure, there WERE flaws, but they didn't massively detract from the film, and honestly, if it doesn't sweep all the techie awards (Oscars, BAFTAs, etc. etc.), I will slap a bitch.
Do a yms review of screenagers
I've never heard him say 10/10
Lets give this director more money plz!!! Villenueve deserves it. His worlk has been impecable on every single movie he has been directing. Personally one of my favorites this decade.
Thank you Adam, I was going to skip this one because I wasn't convinced Blade Runner needed a sequel or that Hollywood would do it justice but this quickie made me do a 180 on that decision.\nWas not disappointed in the least!
I really hope Villeneuve and Deakins squeeze in Bond 25 before Dune
When i saw that you'd reviewed BR49 i was excited and a little worried because your reviews are usually spot on and you don't suffer fools gladly so i was pleasantly surprised with your very positive review. \nI watched BR as a 20yo and it really was my favourite movie for many years (not so much these days). It's so nice to see that the torch has been passed.
this movie costed $150m let's hope it'll surpass it's budget.
not a 10/10 I'm so fucking triggered reeeeee!
m8! do a review on IT pleez
Spoilers:\nI think the whole movie is about K finding his humanity. Throughout the movie, he constantly is belittled by everyone for being a replicant, he‚Äôs not real to anyone, not even to himself. But deep down, he knows there's something more, but because of his job and the world he lives in, he won't accept it. That‚Äôs why his girlfriend isn‚Äôt real either, he doesn't think he deserves a real one, and he See's himself in her. But as the story continues, and he begins to figure out that he may actually be this prophecy child, he begins to realize that maybe he is real. He starts breaking down, realizing that this whole time he was right, that what his girlfriend told him was right, that he is special. Because of this he begins acting human, he goes against what he's told, he lies, as he believes he really is real, that he has a soul. But after its revealed to him that he isn't this child, he loses hope. They tell him to kill deckard, and begins to act as he did at the beginning of the film, just following orders. But before he does, he See's his girlfriend advertising hologram, and then realizes something. He realizes this whole time, she was just as unreal as he was. But he loved her just the same. So it hits him, if I can believe she is real, why can't I believe I am real? He realizes that this whole time, he always had a soul, that everything he did while he thought he was this child the way he acted, that was just him. The memory of the horse was like placebo for him. You even hear the voice over say dying for a cause is the most human thing a person can do  which is exactly what he did. But this not only alludes to him, but to Joi too. She risked her life to help him, and died because of it. In this scene, he realizes that she was real. Him realizing she is real, is his miracle (like sapper said) that gives him a reason to believe he too is real. He then uses this freedom to go against what he is told, freeing deckard, reuniting him with his daughter, and then dying peacefully just like Roy. As he has now proven to himself. That he was always real. As he lets the snow land on him, just like the rain did on Joi when she discovered she was real. He is real. He is free.
Blade Runner is a great film, as is the sequel, which is an extremely rare thing...   but alas, I'm heartbroken. It seems that the general public HAS voted with their wallets and Blade Runner 2049 is not the film they want. They don't want excellent pacing, cinematography, directing, acting, etc. Most want their Fast & Furious and Transformer schlock. If there is one thing I want to see happen (which probably won't) is that even if it's not the financial success we'd hoped it would be, I pray The Academy gets one thing right, and that's for 2049 to sweep all it's categories...          well, if it's even nominated, that is.
huh. i watched this expecting you to rip it a new asshole not suck it off. I guess i need to see it.
I thought it was boring. Although I enjoyed when he choked that bitch out.
dune aside, I heard daniel craig absolutely wants villeneuve to direct his final 007 next year...
2049 is not a movie, seeing it in a theater is one of those experiences you describe to your grandchildren years later.
I knew I wanted to see this movie, but I so rarely see movies (just due to scheduling). This review was the kick in the ass I needed and holy shit, I loved it. Possibly one of my favorite movies of the past few years. Excellent.
Well I guess we gotta give Ridley Scott credit...
I completely agree. I loved this movie and do think it is an improvement over the original. I felt transported to another universe for 3 hours, and the story was decadent filled with characters that are well acted and that the audience grows to actually care about.
I love the theme of loneliness in the movie.
Oscar MUST consider this film during awards season. Reframed in that context I think it will finally attract the audience it was always meant to (i.e. people looking for long form art, not a blockbuster action film).
Oh my god, a movie that Chris Stuckmann and YMS agree on? Amazing. The only, ONLY reviewer or whatever that didn't like this movie was Cr1tikal and his opinion just comes from his lack of understanding of what Blade Runner is. His friend didn't even like the shining. Everyone else is in love. If even YMS is in love, then this really is one of the best sequels of all time. Alongside Aliens.
I saw this video the day it came out, watched the first five seconds, heard I thought it was phenominal and immediately closed the video to go watch the film. After finally getting a chance, I came back, watched the vid, and found myself in agreeance.  A lot of the things you said were things I happened to notice while watching the movie. You and other film critic channels (such as Ralphthemoviemaker) have really helped me learn about how cinematography works, and how to view films with a critical eye rather than that of the average movie goer. In many ways this has enhanced my experience watching films and I appreciate the lessons you've taught on the value of good film making.
I saw this movie and fell in love with it. I saw that you were reviewing it and my heart sank into my stomach. I respect and am heavy influenced by your reviews, but I was thinking ‚ÄúPlease, Adam, go easy on this movie‚Äù. I am very happy you enjoyed it too.
I just saw this movie today. The theater was mostly empty unfortunately, but it's so good I decided I'm gonna have to see it at least two more times. I want more movies like this, please.
wtf, this review was the most positive review ive ever heard from Adam. So much so that I thought he had to be kidding. I'll definitely check this movie out
Oh fuck I didn't know the person who directed Arrival.\nI'll watch this.
Instead of doing DOOM maybe the director who's name I will not butcher can explore a possible live action Cowboy Bebop?? =D
Too bad it couldn't captivate audiences enough to see it... like the original couldn't...
9? Wow, the movie rubbed me in the wrong way for some reason, I would not give it more than a 6 or 7. Maybe an 8. I also watched the first Bladerunner a day before, and it left a better impression on me than the new one. The new one has some similar visual elements, but in my mind the new movie has a different tone than the first one. The first one from what I got out of it was about the struggle of a lower class. I feel that the new one has some themes that are better illustrated in Children of Men, and Moon, with regards to a rare birth and memory implants. The first movie was much more subtle, and better developed than the new one in my opinion. I wouldn't say that the new one sucks, but rather it is a sort of fancy average.
Could you please do a more in depth review of this movie. Would love to hear your opinions on the plot, wich was my biggest gripe with the film. I may just be stupid, but some things were quite confusing to me.
The one sequel, the ONE good sequel, and it tanks harder than the Cleveland Browns. Yippee.
If u like a movie just dont make a vid bout it
Someone who actually gives Leto his due how about that.
m gonna have to completely disagree with you about the pacing.  It felt like 7 hrs for me.
I hope Denis gets Dune green lit.
I thought it was pretty good, bit slow and the rebellion plot was a bit unnecessary though
visually one the best movies iv ever seen, highly recommend seeing this in cinemas the sound made me feel like I was in a trance
Every time Ryan Gosling's wife rang, the Peter and the Wolf ringtone made me immediately paint a mental image of Kenny initiating a plan to beat Spenny at a competition.
K I N O
So amazing, denis is one of the best directors around, best fx ever with great music/acting/storytelling  10/10
Very Good film and a classic in 20 years from now , just a lot more times watching . Original at the moment still the best film ever made though .
You sure know how to sell a movie lol. Definitely going to see this now.
YES!!!!!!!! I SAW THIS AND WAS SCARED YOU MIGHT RIP IT TO SHREDS BUT YOU DIDNT!!!
Well I was on the fence and Adum once again pushed me off and said IT'S GOOD and I went oh ok
so this is what happens when a director who wants to say something gets an opportunity in 2017. I hope that people will support this with their $. denis villeneuve will never be unemployed anyways, but let's show that we, as general audience still have a good taste.
You sound like Force Gaming
Just came here for the first 4 seconds. Will come back when i actually watched it.
Am I the only one that found Luv and mister Wallace very boring? Luv felt kinda edgy with her oneliners and Wallace was just spouting some biblical mythology to sound deep. That's what I got out of it at least. Ryan gosling carried the movie for me.
Do a long review please
The original is more pure, it's never dull or slow cause it's telling the story at all times with multiple meanings to every scene, just think, he's continplating if hes a replicant during the entire movie and the reason for the pacing of the movie makes sense. That's how I see it.
Spoilers and theories ahead \n\n\n\n\n\nOk, am I the only one that saw Luv pop her head up after K supposedly drowns her? It‚Äôs during the last time K and Deckard look back at the sinking car. I‚Äôve seen it twice now and I‚Äôm like 85% sure I saw her. I may be crazy, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else noticed.
I don't know, it had too much hand carrying moments. When this happened the first time, I was like Oh yeah, by saying that thing Sapper Morton meant this, I should may closer attention to details. When this happened a third or so time with flashbacks and stuff, it was more of feeding you with processed information rather than letting you figure it out yourself, especially when I was starting to pay attention to those details, only to get frustrated later, because we're going to piece together all the information anyway. The ending was a nice break from that, but ultimately the presentation of the movie plot left a sour taste in my mouth.\nHowever, I need to point out that the score was pretty well done. I was afraid that it try to mimic some sort of version of vaporwave, since of its current presence, but instead I was presented with a more refined, albeit too sharp, version of original movie soundtrack. The first sounds I heard during the screening left me no doubt that I was in the right movie, and a nostalgic trip at the end gave me flashbacks of Roy Batty monologue.
Yeaaah, calling this movie better than the original is so wrong, so so wrong.
The plot was shit
You didnt go into spoilers, so maybe that's why, but like, there's a big flaw of predictability. \nSPOILERS:\n\n\nI'll start by saying I actually liked the film, for similar reason to what's said in the video, except for the flawless part, because the plot is part of the scenes, so even if they're well directed and shot, they are taken down by predictable writing, which isnt necessarily bad, but its not flawless. \nThere is problem with predictability. The big plot of who the kid is, was immensely predictable, maybe it was just me, but what, not even 20 minutes into the film, we see the sock and I immediately guessed they were setting up him to be the child, the second they mentioned it was a girl I figured out who it was and after the film I realized I picked up on all the set up to the plot twists, I remember thinking about the two identical DNA thing that it'd probably be a girl, idk if there was a shot that focused in on it or something, but that plus the horse toy which is not the usually associated with boys, plus the set up of the actual girl's auto immune disease, something that just isnt said it passing. \nAlso the prostitute/resistant synth, was also clearly being set up for something, I assumed she's get killed or talk the fall for him or help him in some way immediately when she was introduced and more so after the weird cyber sex, didnt piece her to the resistance/run away synths, but did predict that there'd be synths living in danger zones, because obviously they'd be about to endure it/not be effected by it as much as humans. And obviously there'd be a robo-revolution, because oppressed robots.
L E G I T I M A T E L Y
Pretty much the existence of this movie ruins that Deckard could be a replicant motif in the original, unless they just outright say / retcon that Deckard was an experimental replicant that could live as long as a human.\nNot complaining, just pointing it out.\n\nSpeaking of pointing something out, I think this movie's soundtrack broke one of the speakers in the theater I was in. About half way through, whenever there was an extremely bassy tone, one of the speakers behind me would get all static-y (which it hadn't been doing before). It wasn't overbearing, so it kind of added to the digital / analog hybrid tech style that Blade Runner has made iconic.
I don't have much money :(
I love how the director essentially took on this project because he loved the original and didn't want to see it fucked it by another director. \nLike, I'm not sure I'm perfect for this, but at least I'll show it respect and give it my best shot! Totally paid off.
I love this movie and that last minute of the video is really important. Aparently the movie is making a lot of money, just like the original, but we have the power to vote, we can have more like this instead of more Terminator movies! We have to choose with our wallets now that we can!
I'm starting to question myself over why I didn't like this movie ...
The opening scene have the extreme close up of an opening eye, just like the original. The ending have a replicant dying for the right cause, like the original.
Darn I missheard it as 'doom' and got very excited for a second
Please review Zoombies, i beg of you.
The Force Awakens was a garbage movie. Why everyone on the internet collectively sucked the movie's metaphorical dick is beyond me.
This movie isn't making enough money. Looks like it's more Jurassic World for us.
and they finally make the film the nerds wanted and it flops...HARD.
I thought this movie had something from Drive in terms of Gosling's storyline. And something from Her. And something from Ghost in the Shell. And the main villian replicant looked like a fem-version of agent Smith from Matrix
You're right, it looks exactly like a generic sfi fi desktop background, whereas the original looks like a classic painting most of the time, every inch full of character, world-building, and stimulating contrasts. There's barely anything to look at in this film and everything that is there is a reference to the original (cars, raincoats, umbrellas, dramatic lighting...). It has no flavour or substance. As far as this movie is concerned this city contains prostitution, big tech corporations and nothing else. You learn more about the world in the first five minutes of the original than in this entire film. This would be fine if the plot had any interest at all, but it doesn't; it's two dramatic twists fall flat as the possibility of them happening is explicitly presented before they happen, the enemies are straight evil guys with no charm, redeeming qualities, or anything interesting to say. Ryan Gosling is given a single motivation and a love interest, and pursues them both in a predictable, unchanging, generic manner. The love interest is given a lot of minutes without really serving to flesh out his character or advance the plot in a significant way. Hans Zimmer's obnoxious soundtrack steadily wub-wubs up and down, pretending that something amazing is happening every few minutes, but it isn't, and it's only emotional resonance comes from the bits borrowed from Vangelis' original soundtrack, which serves as a constant reminder that you could be watching a far better film.
Women in the sci-fi sequel are either prostitutes, holographic housewives or they die brutal deaths that we are forced to watch in horrifying detail.
ngl, didnt like it
Vote with your wallets, people
42nd on trending \n\n\n\n\nGOOD JOB
Wtf is episode 7?
hype hype hype ... beautiful visuals gimmicks already forgotten in 3, 2, 1.
I hate movie goers these days... they get a masterpiece in all cinemas around them and all they care about is a trailer for another shitty ultra remix star wars movie
Adam this comment is kinda gay but I just wanted to say that I love this channel. Your reviews are hilarious and aside from just being funny these videos are pretty in depth and analytical all things considered. I just wanted to say this channel is fucking great and coming from someone who aspires to be a director  I really admire what you do. so keep up the good work and remember cool cat loves you.
Denis didn't release a film in 2014.
This movie was so fucking boring...
I'm sorry, how was every scene necessary? There's legit a whole scene of him sticking his hand in a beehive for 10 mins. He just walks around doing nothing for most of the film.\n\nI actually thought you were being sarcastic at points. This movie was so long and the plot was so thin it should have been an hour long.\n\nThe story was really predictable and kind of disappointing. Compare this to an episode of black mirror and there's no contest. Blade Runner 2049 wasn't thrilling, it wasn't exciting. It was mildly interesting at best.\n\nThe type of movie is also done to death with Ghost In The Shell and every dystopian sci-fi franchise ever being already produced. \n\nIt has no suspense or drama and it had a typical mustache twirling villain that drove the plot of the film. I wouldn't even call it dystopian, the drive of the film had nothing to do with the world. The world wasn't oppressive and the protagonist wasn't fighting against human nature, he was fighting against some big baddy. \n\nI also had no reason to care about the characters. I just found myself thinking, oh so they're dead okay.\n\nAny other sci-fi film has explored the concepts in this film a million times better than this did.\n\nIdk, maybe I should watch it again but idk why people are praising this film so much.
It was bloody awful, dry, slow and anti climatic. I agree the cinematography and visuals with the locations and props was excellent, but everything else was below par.
I'm planning on seeing this in the theater, but i still have a question - would you say Harrison Ford's emphasis in the poster outweighs his emphasis in the film?
A few nitpicks I had with this overall amazing movie. The SONY advertisement crap was very distracting, not to forget about the Coca Cola that's in every Sony pictures as well. \n\nThe Final Boss fight was not very well handled, Trying not to spoil anything, but two dark clad people fighting in the dark, while the camera constantly swifts to a different person, only to return to the fight from the opposite camera angle making it hard to get invested in. Also the final Boss changed character so suddenly in the movie I had a hard time feeling motivated in the villains arc.\n\nThe fight scene between Dekard and K seemed a bit forced, like why not just say why you where there, really? And when the movie decides to kill off a character they made it very clear that, that person was going to die soon.\n\nLast thing is a small thing, but in a visual movie like this I wish they had recorded it on film and not digital, I know Sony would never allow Panavision 70mm in their movies, but the absence of pitch black and only dark grey is a real shame. (Now granted I didn't see it in a IMAX theater, but black was just not there where I saw the movie).\n\nAll in all these are small things, now go watch this movie!
I‚Äôm glad I watched your review for this because I grew up watching the original Blade Runner thanks to my dad so I got really excited when the sequel got announced. And hearing that it‚Äôs good gives me joy because I really wanted to be a success so thank you for your review
I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over
Saw it on Friday, awesome movie.
Excuse me but what is it to this particular movie that was not previously explored and shown in Her, Equilibrium, Chlidren of Men and some others? What is so unique in terms of themes, plot points and questions that it asks you? Anyone?
... Why is...\nWhat\nMy family and I went and saw it and it was the only time we were all in agreement about a movie.\nWe hated it, I can't find anything I like about it?
dude, this flick sucked...people walked out.

Thank you sooooo much for this video Jackie!!! The only sunscreen I‚Äôve ever used that didn‚Äôt cause the chalkboard look is Hawaiian Tropic sheer touch.
Auntie Jackie please review the cats pajama's palette by Laura lee. It seems very suspicious to me that I haven't seen a single negative review on it. She also seems to have only sent the palette to her close friends and really small YouTube accounts that wouldn't dare give it a negative review since they  would probably like to get on other pr lists. Idk it just seems suspicious since the searches don't seem very good and even the looks don't seem that good but the people who have tried rave about it. I need a trustworthy person aka auntie Jackie to review it
I always find myself going back to murad invisiblur but good lordt it is pricey
Woowww let me take my notes while watching this vid. this was so helpful!
Aunty Jackie üò©üò©üò©why wasn‚Äôt this done before the summer started üò©üò≠sis this could‚Äôve been SOO useful üò≠
Please review E.L.F new products. There's so many I'm interested in but afraid to buy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for this video!!! My mom unfortunately passed away from skin cancer and she was always SO careful in the sun. You are absolutely right, cancer doesn't discriminate. I really appreciate the work you put into this! So much love! üòô
I like the missha suncreams since they have high spf levels, don‚Äôt break the bank, and are a combination of a physical and chemical suncream
My favorite daily sunscreen + moisturizer is Formula 10.0.6 Picture Perfect Day! It's only SPF 15 but it smells good and feels great! It doesn't make me greasy either.
thanks for this helpful and important video! dark skin people don't need spf is the dumbest skin care myth ever and i still see people perpetuating that ignorance in 2017. just because our skin doesn't turn red & peel off from going outside to check the mailbox (like white ppl) doesn't mean we're immune from UV rays!!
She's a veteran but she's also not trying to break a nail - why I love Jackie üòçüòÇ
This video was a gooodseeend thankyousomuch!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
also do you have lash extensions or are you just that blessed? i'm in love with your lashes ‚ô•
As far as the cast tacha causes. I'm a medium light skin tone. And that type of SPF makes my skin look weird too. So I think that type does that to everyone...  except maybe porcelain skin lol
when you're as white as that tatcha sunscreen but is still watching
Tip to all: You might want to take a daily vitamin D supplement if you're wearing sunscreen everyday. It's easy to become deficient in this vitamin if you're minimizing all sun exposure, especially for darker skinned people. Sunscreen is so, so important for everybody though.\n\nThanks for this video Jackie, I need some of that bad and  bougie Murad sunscreen in my life now.
OMG my friends and I used to send each other the Big Miss Steak picture all the time when we were in high school üò≠ I miss them aw
Thanks for doing this Jackie!
I loved this video!!!! So so so informative and I really learned a lot.
La roche posay are famous for their sunscreens in Europe. It is a French pharmacy brand. Maybe worth trying out for some drugtore sunscreens?
Jackie Jackie Jackieeeee Living for the outfit Jackie!
guys just bash your head on the keyboard and see what comes up:\n\n\njackiejackieeekaklciiijackiieeejackiieeep[0\nicfhiodfikdddpio
Have you tried the Anessa perfect UV sunscreen aqua booster? It's great at mattefying :)
So do you moisturize, and then use spf or do you skip moisturizer?
I just learned there was a difference the other day in esthetics school. I need physical SPF, or I'll have to visit the ER.
i fucking love you
Wtf I thought the glossier sunscreen was soo much bigger, it looks so tiny irl when u hold it
Loving the new intro üò≠
there is no such thing higher than SPF 50 , they can say its higher eg. SPF70 but its a lie lol
I get rid of my Hyperpigmentation by using potatoes by 2 weeks my face was so clear of acne scars etc. and it helped with my face texture that I had going on and I know this is some random comment has nothing do with your video lol . P.s I love all your videos Jackie !!!‚ù§Ô∏è
I love how much I learn from Jackie Aina's channel! She's so smart, funny and makes learning fun!! Now I'm on the market for an SPF
A Chemical sunscreen for normal/dry skin is Aveeno protect and hydrate SPF 50. And it‚Äôs only $10. No cast, it‚Äôs beautiful üòç
Thank you so much for this video!!!
OMGGGG the Alba Mineral Sunscreen is AMAZING !!! Absorbs in completely üòä
AUNT JACKIE!! I found the Benefit Dream Screen as a mini in a skincare set on Macy's website!
This was really helpful! I was in need of a spf for my face!
I love you for being that Auntie! üíñ You've inspired me to invest in an spf outside of my foundation. I'm a pale little cave-dweller, though, so I rarely see the sun. üòÇ
You‚Äôre hilarious and so positive! Love your videos.
I'm a manager at ulta the most recent benefit cosmetics training they sent us to. They had us try different techniques with the dream screen. Mixing it with porefessional before applying to the face is a dream!!!!! You can also mix it in with their triple moisture cream if the matte sunscreen is too dry for you.
Can you recommend a sunscreen that does not leave your face looking chalky and works for those who are allergic to chemical sunscreens? I have been using the Coola Mineral Matte(?) and like it , but it does leave me a little casper looking
Well IBD! Chemical vs Physical SPF, learned something new today.
Jackie you have to store the colourfx bottles upside down.
Also for everyone, I want to recommend that the actual amount of sunscreen you should apply is anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 a  tbsp, yes, tablespoon.  If you apply anything less than that you are not reaching the claimed protection your sunscreen offers. This is scientifically proven, i am not  sure why  Western brands don't give that kind of  information :/ . Sorry I don't have the sources right now but you guys can google it if you want confirmation :)
Jackieee what did you use to lay those EDGES THOOOOO??
I use the La Roche-Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral with zinc oxide and and titanium dioxide. The feel on the skin is great, and there is minimal white cast if any on my MAC NW20 skin. It's $33 in the US, and feels silky and not overly greasy on my dehydrated skin.
I'm pregnant, so I can't use chemical sunscreens right now. I'm hating using physical sunscreens. I'll have to try one of these after the baby is born.
I click like every time I hear Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackiiiieee, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!!!!!
What would you recommend for the Body?
she's a veteran, she's army strong but she's still also not trying to break a nail LOL
I love this video it‚Äôs so informative. I need to look better at these ingredients, üòÇ
üòÇüòÇüòÇ What's good YouTube Square upüëä Get them notifications together. \nI need some SPF in my life. I never wear any smh. I'ma do better lol.

I just discovered u! I'm glad I did
i love the alpha h spa 50. its moisturising and ¬†smoothing too
HANDS DOWN MOST ENTERTAINING BEAUTY GURU! ADOPT ME!
Japan/Korean SPFs are where it‚Äôs at. I hated using SPF until I tried Asian SPF.
after spf 30 it really doesnt matter, u still have to reapply every 2 hours anyways...im sure they can invent an spf that lasts all day but....how will they make money? lol i dont think companies ever will tbh
....should i not be using regular sunscreen on my face then?
Yaaasssss! Thank you for being the plug, Jackie!! I‚Äôm still hunting for the Dream Screen. 6 weeks and counting üôÑ
A physical sunscreen that works well for brown skin is the Drunk Elephant Umbra Tinte Spf 30. It doesn't leave a cast, but she does have peeling issues, so I have to spray fix plus or water on my face to make sure she gets mixed in good. Also, when dealing with a greasy sunscreen, I just set her with some powder and it's all good in the hood.
Can you use spf as primer?
Can you please do a review on the best eyelash glues for beginners and overall I love your vibe and would really appreciate it xx
These spf's are crazy expensive üòÆ neutrogena has a great SPF under $15 I believe. The body shop has a good selection of SPF under $15! $65 for an SPF...hell to the nawww
You should try the Lancaster Sun Sport invisible face gel matte finish . A gel spf one of the best in my opinion
My auntie Jackie shouting out my auntie Evelyn üò≠üò≠ the Lord just keep blessing me
I appreciate this video. I‚Äôve been learning how important spf is and have been looking to find some that don‚Äôt leave that purple cast or the weird film on my face. Thanks Jackie
We're so here for this. Thanks for sharing the info!!!
Oh my gosh!!! Im latina with dark skin kinda...and i always turned purple with some sun screens ... Now i know!!!!! Thanks for the help girly!!!!
Omg Jackie! I love your spirit. üíï I've been feeling so down lately. and just watching your videos have made me feel so much better. God Bless you Jackie! ‚ù§
This video was very helpful! Great content, informative and entertaining! I always give you a thumbs up Jackio! You the best!
I haven‚Äôt seen many you tubers do a video like this. Now I know I should be wearing sunscreen on a daily basis lol
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre out here having fun while also taking time out to educate people and letting them know what‚Äôs up bless you Jackie üôå
Jaggyjaggyjaggyjaggy.....jaggyjaggy!!! Lol. Jackie you already have a song for your future baby to calm em down during tantrums. Oh how I wish we were in the same city or country at least. I love your energy level.....purely exciting. I've been using an spf15 and yes aunty jackie, before you even start to scream, I am switching to benefit dream screen after watching this video. YAAAAS!!!! I need another suggestion though if you don't mind. I have acne prone screen so always on the verge to fight these breakouts so my moisturizers are mainly for fighting breakouts. I wanna add an antiaging cream regimen that I could use before going to bed. Something simple to use, that one cream that will do the magic and yes, I am a chocolate sister and will loooove something that will be team choco. Cheers!
About a week ago!!!! One does not simply say ‚Äúabout a week ago,‚Äù without singing the song.
The number after the spf represents how many multiples of time you‚Äôre safe to be out in the sun before you start burning. So, wearing a factor 15 sun cream will give you 15 times the number of minutes before you burn, than what you‚Äôd have with no sunscreen protection at all.
Asian sunblocks work great, and the price is definitely super affordable! Japanese brands are usually the best, and you can get the gel sunblocks as opposed to the milk formula, which is more mattifying. None of the Asian sunscreens I've used have ever left a white cast. Try Biore, I know this can be bought on Amazon in Western countries, correct me if I'm wrong.
ONE THING TO CONSIDER: you HAVE TO use a certain amount of sunscreen for it to work.
I‚Äôm obsessed with my skin care because I have acne but I‚Äôve never worn sunscreen... girllllll I‚Äôm doing things wrong! Time to go to Ulta.
I'm a sunscreen girl everyday since I was 14 no matter what. People ask how I'd get my makeup to last all day and I swear the spf helps it to stay all day. I call it the original primer.
You are awesome!

Skinceuticals makes some awesome ones!
It's still trending. üòä
YES you know EVELYN
Biore aqua rich watery essence spf 50 is the truth. Amazing texture, no flashback, no weird spf odor, and great on oily skin.
From my own experience, if you have sensitive skin, extremely sensitive skin, maybe stay away from the chemical barriers. I've had even the best break me out. CeraVe and Cetaphil make decent oxide/physical barriers where I c an usually  get them to rub in mostly clear. If you  use a powder foundation you can actually tent it yourself as well. It's not usually that deep for me lol
I stand behind what I said about this movie, which is that I hated it. You don‚Äôt have to like a movie to do a tutorial on a look from it, & being that it‚Äôs the most popular movie right now, it would be dumb of me to not do a tutorial. Get over it üéà
5 min into this video tutorial and it's already awful stay tuned for updates
ok but fr why do you sound like you got shit stuck in your nose?üíÄ
5 minutes in and the tutorial is already terrible stay tuned for updates.

Didnt understand shit you said thru the whole video. üòíüòí
You look like you're fucking animated why r u perfect
he's hyped up on gazebos
Whyyy every time he talks he close his eyes for  5 seconds
‚Äú I hated the movie but loves penny wise‚Äù OKAY sit your congested nasally ass down
*5 minuets in and this tutorial is awful, stay tuned for updates.*
I hated the remake... Original was ok at its best as well though but this look ssllllaayyyyss!!!!!
0:16 seconds in, and i already hate it. stay tuned for updates!
I personally didn't like the remake very much and prefer the original.
I don‚Äôt think Pennywise was supposed to look girly... opps my badü§ó
Wait but I thought there was a thing called primer
James I love you so much don't listen to the haters. You don't have to love a movie to do a look... people need to stop being so rude... you said you liked pennywise but you didn't love the movie and that's okay. Keep being your amazing wonderful self.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
thinks recreating a characters look will be a great idea after exploiting the movie... nek minit gets dragged by a literal 14 year old... nice work James
you forgot to give credit to Andrew Michael for the music. Flames üëçüèª
lol I don't understand why everyone is getting so upset cuz he did not like the movie but created a look about it??? I personally did not care for the movie too much either, but I still think pennywise looked bomb af in the movie, and he took time to create the look, and did a great job at it too!!!
Who did you glam intro its amazing
Where is the costume from?
i don‚Äôt have enough space between my eyelid and my eyebrow to do a cut crease and have it look good :‚Äô^)
honestly idk how Finn dragged him he just said ‚Äúwhy are you on the phone during the movie‚Äù like how is that a drag like yeah it‚Äôs true you shouldn‚Äôt be on your phone but lmfao ok, and Jesus Christ everyone would lowkey do this if y‚Äôall were James for the money I‚Äôm not on anyone‚Äôs side but y‚Äôall really giving him shit for doing something other youtubers do snksnks
CLEARLY, for the the people who hating or saying it's for attention. The title SPECIFICALLY, IT Pennywise GLAM!ALSO, he clearly states he hated the movie but not Pennywise. So read and listen people.
This hypocritical ass, he sad he said he hated it, then just made this video for just views, what did your expensive basic merch, sorry ‚Äúclothing line‚Äù not do shit, so you had to do this. It‚Äôs sad to see the trash and laughing stock of the makeup community, is now the hypocritical trash and laughing stock of the makeup community. And yes his makeup isn‚Äôt bad, but to do this just for views, even though you didn‚Äôt like the movie. Get bent. That being said I watched this and the makeup wasn‚Äôt bad, but to do it for views. Come on now
All I'm going to say pennywise is glam
You can't post something that you don't like, and just post it for money.
Your on BuzzFeed but idc about the drama I have to watch your vids
this is why you were unhappy being on youtube and had to take a break. you literally just follow a trend instead of making what you want
I ain't gonna keep on watching bitch
Hey James, can you please do a mad hatter look. (I‚Äôm gonna be a mad hatter for Halloween with the colors blue and purple) thank you sooo much. P.s I love your vids and makeup!!
Omg imma be a scarecrow this year and if I could u would be the first person I would go to to get the makeup done.I LOVE IT!
exploiting the hard work done by the creators and cast involved with this movie (A MOVIE YOU PUBLICLY STATED YOU HATED) just because you‚Äôre money hungry is so fucking scummy, dude. Do you just not have any integrity as a creator and artist???
Yaass! I hated it too! But you slaaaaaaaaay the looküòç
I wish that's what penny wise looked like I'd go on set and kiss him
Don't even try to say and if you don't like my video you'll float you knew you would get a bad reaction to this
I loved the movie
Im sorry but you just ruined pennywise for me
Yaaaas bitchh. I fucking live for this. You nailed it
You're a garbage person.
Does he always talk like that?
you lost so much respect for ligit everyone okay goodbye sister. **brother
Your such a hypocrite you can‚Äôt just say that u hate the movie and then do a tutorial like maybe if you actually gave the movie a chance instead of spending the whole movie on your phone you would actually appreciate how good of a movie it is üôÑ
I'm so sorry pennywise honey
penny wise sweetie... i‚Äôm so sorry a bitch would even do this to you
Guys 5 minutes in and I already hate it. Stay tuned for updates
Oh my god guys, stop the hate. Stop saying its not original and shit. Makeup is something he likes to do and if he wants to do something someone else did,vlet him, the more the better. Its called a trend. So what if he didnt like the movie but he is making a tutorial on it? Maybe someone else who liked the movie wants to know how to do the look, and he is taking initiative to teach people how to do a look that is based off of a popular movie, like seriously.
At least the flashback won't be noticable
5 minutes into this video and this tutorial is already boring
5 minutes in and this tutorial is already awful stay tuned for updates
The official IT Trailer but with James Charles
I was cringing as soon as this video started
It was really hard watching this video. I hate James Charles so much but I wanted to see if he had anything to say about the it movie and the 14 year old that dragged him üòÇüòÇ
FIVE MINUTES IN AND THIS TUTORIAL IS ALREADY AWFUL STAY TUNE FOR UPDATES
how many kids did you kill
People love to drag this kid but he does it to himself in a way yknow? \nIdk I enjoy the vids tho
so don't get all pissy when ppl hate this video. hypocrite
WHO GIVES A FUCK IF HE DIDN‚ÄôT LIKE THE MOVIE IT‚ÄôS HIS FUCKING OPINION YOU PEOPLE ARE SO SENSITIVE TO A FUCKING MOVIE
0:07 seconds in and I already know how it‚Äôs gonna end
Woah, why you gotta do pennywise like that? He‚Äôs perfect just the way he is
okay five minutes into this makeup tutorial and it‚Äôs already awful, stay tuned for updates
Best it makeup tutorial I've seen so far üíÑüéà
All these negative comments are terrible. This tutorial is AMAZING!!!\nSLAYYYYY SISTER!!!!!!!
I'm so confused am I the only one that thinks the palette he showed us is 100% different from the palette he said it was?
Out of all the makeup tutorials for this he has the best and believe me I've seen alot
he talks like his teeth are too big for his mouth.
5 mins in to this tutorial and its already awful.Stay tuned for updates
It's bullcrap that everyone is hating, you have no idea why he didn't like it, stop hating because clearly he liked something from the movie since he did a look inspired by it. Leave him alone, he's doing his JOB! He loves his job and this is how he makes money
Does anyone else hate when he tries to be funny
I NEED YOU TO DO MY MAKEUPüíôüíôüíôüå∏üå∏üå∏üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•
I wish I had the money to get the makeup that is such a beautiful peace of makeup
Why am I laughing at 0:04
Why is everyone being complete babies and whining and complaining that James did a makeup look based on a movie that he didn't like! It's popular and he liked the makeup so just let him do it. His work is totally amazing so stop being so jealous üôÑ I'M HERE FOR YOU SISTER AND IGNORE ALL THOSE JEALOUS B*TCHES ‚ù§Ô∏è
SAY IT WITH ME NOW: HüëèüèΩYüëèüèΩPüëèüèΩOüëèüèΩCüëèüèΩRüëèüèΩIüëèüèΩTüëèüèΩE
i get why people are so pissed off at james, he said he came to the movie to get scared and it wasn't scary. If he knew anything about the movie he would know that the movie is supposed to be about the character development and friendship. He definitely should've at least done some research before going of and hating on a movie. But either way it's his opinion and he has every right to make a tutorial. That's literally his job, even wyatt said so.
Dear haters, the more you hate on this beautiful soul, the more you look like a dumbass.
not hating but why does everything have to be a glam just my opinion
you'll glow to you'll glow to you'll GLOW TO üíõüåüüíõ
I literally hate you
I hate youuu, I hate youuu this is awfull

Pennywise\nBut a *thot* version
Inspired by jasmine brown!
Wyatt and Finn snatched your weave
Great tribute to a legend.
I love Brandon for always paying homage to those that influenced him and came before him. I love all the music he always mentions and talks about. I guess I connect to him in that way. Great video and cover!
One of my favorite songs sung by my favorite band. Awesome!
I was thereüòä they were amazing üî•
For a cover, it's pretty darn good! Huge respect to The Killers for this amazing tribute.
this made me so happy that they did this
Watched this live! Great way to open to the show!!!! They should do this cover on their next Sawdust type album!!!
The Killers have always struck me as having Tom Petty and Heartbreakers' songwriting sensibilities (sure they may get a little more ornate sometimes, with Sam's Town seeming like an homage to Queen) and Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's energy. Flowers' voice forces you to focus on the heart before the head. He's got a gift.
Such an amazing way to start a great set. So happy I made it out!!!
That was awesome, thanks so much! Beautifully done!
They were absolutely amazing at ACL!!!!
And then segueing into Mr. Brightside. Perfect tribute
Hi there,\n\nDid you shoot this video footage? If so, we would like to use it as part of an article on our website Radio X - http://www.radiox.co.uk and also ¬†associated social media channels with a credit. ¬†Could you please get back to me asap and let me know if this is ok? Many thanks!\n\nCrystal
The sentiment was lovely, but the result was awful. I've heard better bar bands---not that I expected the killers to live up to the musicianship of the Heartbreakers to begin with.
Why is this trending.
everyone needs to put her out of her misery and not vote for her to stay another week.
So glad Bruno backed Shirley Ballas and told Brendan where to shove it. Utterly disrespectful, he's always had such an anger problem.
Charlotte doesn't have the technique or is even entertaining on the dance floor.... it's normal that her scores are low same with Ruth p.ex Susan may not be a great dancer but you can see she's enjoying herself..I much rather watch a bad happy dancer than a train wreck :(
Didn't enjoy this one. Charlotte just seemed awkward and uncomfortable through out. Also Brendan's comment was completely uncalled for. Well done to Bruno for calling him on it.
Firstly, Charlotte looks like a matured version of Taylor Swift. But quit trying to make her look sexy, Brendan. She's clearly not comfortable looking sexy. Somehow I felt she was not keeping to the steady tango walk (she went up and down against Brendan), I think she forgot to flex her knees. Not good still. 5
Dragged from pillar to post... poor girl. Nerves again got the better of her I think. Could have been dynamic and staccato with the right paring...\n\nI just don't think they are gelling at all. Charlotte looked MORTIFIED when Brendan had a go at Shirley... Not nice to watch on an entertainment show. These two clearly have beef off-set. We the public don't want or need to see that.\n\nI hope they go tonight, getting unpleasant again (he was ott on 'It Takes Two' last week.) sadly and no-one should display the anger that Brendan did there... poor. Bring on Neil next year and get rid of Brendan.
I think that the judges were fair and there was no need for Brendan to answer back to the HEAD judge like that. He was just dragging her across the floor. I didn't like it
The judges were quite harsh, but Brendan had no excuse to act like such an ass. \nI don't think she's enjoying the competition at all, would probably be relieved to go out this week tbh.
Yeah, that foxtrot seems a million miles away now. She's just getting shoved around. Also, shut up Brendan. 3.0/10
She has no personality... Such a boring contestant..
Bloody hell people, what's the matter with you? This was a perfectly acceptable dance for week 2. She had a few moments of rise and fall, but it certainly wasn't as much as Shirley seemed to think. Brendan stuck up for Charlotte because Shirley crucified her dance when it wasn't deserved; she'd make marked improvements and had many good points to praise. It's clear that Charlotte lacks in confidence, and I feel that Shirley comments were more about knocking Brendan than they were about critiquing Charlotte. There were other pairs that night who were spoken to far more kindly than Charlotte was and her performance was far better. I think the judges sometimes forget that they are speaking to other adults, not children.
terrble dragged around not good brendan was horrible to shirley 3/10
Can I get a thumbs up here folks? Hey @BBCStrictly - you know what makes for uncomfortable television? Not watching poor old Charlotte plod around the floor - but watching that angry, narcissist Brendan Cole. He can't take a woman judging him, especially one that knows more about dancing than he ever will and that also beat him to the judging position he wanted. He's rude, disrespectul, takes himself waaaay too seriously and should be warned that if he keeps this up he'll be off the show. Nobody wants to watch this angry man bring the show down. Tell him to shut it - or leave.
This had rise and fall, and her frame was not strong enough. 4/10.
Ah yes, there is a little rise and fall towards the end. Not down low enough and she is an awkward, self conscious dancer but maybe she can improve.
Charlotte looked gorgeous but unfortunately she looked prettier then how she danced this was a hot mess 4/10
Unfortunately, this dance didn't suit her. Her posture and her frame were bad. Her footwork was bad - no heel leads at all. In addition, there was no emotion, she didn't portrayed the character of this dance... she looked  cold and even nervous.... the choreography was great, her musicality was excellent and her standing spin was very good, but the rest of the dance (in terms of hold, posture, technique and performance) were disappointing. A 5.
She didn't seem comfortable at all and there was almost no sticatto from Charlotte. She showed promise in Week 1, but I feel like she's only gonna shine in those Waltz-esque dances.\n\n4/10
Who?
Awful he had to drag her to keep her frame up . And Brendan giving flack to Shirley since she started can he not take being judged by a woman? His snarky comments help no one especially Charlotte
Poor dancer..
Terrible dance and she's getting dragged across the floor! Also Brendan's attitude needs to be sorted, it's a competition but at the end of the day it's a bit of fun. He takes it too seriously, that's not what dancing is about!
she looks gorgeous every week but my guess is she was terrified again because she looked joyless out there :(
I think that Shirley was too harsh. What she said was right but she talks to some in a rude way rather than a constructive way! Brendan was a bit quick to argue back but I think he could hear the way she talks to others in comparison to the way she talks to charlotte and I'm not surprised he was angry! Charlotte was nervous and clearly just needed someone to acknowledge her efforts rather than just lay into her. It is only week 3
WHO IS HERE JUST TO SEE IF SHIRLEY WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE RISE AND FALL LOL
Poor Charlotte, looks so uncomfortable when Brandon back talks Shirley. She has a higher status than you, do not have a go at someone who clearly knows what their talking about
Brendan was disrespectful to Shirley. His choreography is not really that good nor is his teaching style. Remember what happened with Anastasia? He just couldn‚Äôt choreograph something that would make her shine or teach her basics. He gets sick and in come Gorka. He taught her and choreographed a beautiful routine which was her highest score. Brendan returns and they get eliminated. I think it‚Äôs time for him to go
That new judge is awful, she needs to be aware she is addressing the public, she has no respect from me, we know she knows her dancing and steps we do not want to hear it. She caused Brendan to react to her. NO professional judge should cause that. It is totally uncalled for her to make Brendan have to point out her mistake.To be honest I am fed up with Bruno shoving himself about I just wish he's wack that judge and shut her up. Bad move stricktly we do not like her.\n Brendan they do not need to tell you about dancing you are a professional judge yourself and this is week three.You did great getting Charlotte to come back.Try and let her make her own mistakes she is good and it will show. Don't rise to that nasty judge she is an embarassment to Strictly
Clear rise and fall - you don‚Äôt need to be a dance expert to be able to see that (and I‚Äôm not) - the judges were right, Brendan!!
Feel like Charlotte and Brendan don't get along... he takes it way to seriously and needs to relax a bit.  You can tell she is so tense especially when getting the scores
Brendan needs to learn to shut his mouth
Brendan had a right to stick up for his partner.its only week three she never danced before(unlike some people on the show )u can tell sheirly dosnt like Brendan tentoin onto nights show proves it. Well done u to u can improve each week.xx
The thing with Shirley is that I am actually learning about the dances. I like the detail she puts into her critiques. Brendan really just needs to remind himself it's Sat night tv. Laugh it off like Anton. He's making it hard for Charlotte to enjoy herself. She just looks scared and non enthused and unlike the second shooter you cannot debate the fact that there WAS rise and bloody fall!!!
I can understand why the rise and fall was there. If you look closely, you can see it's because she keeps quite low while moving in hold. When she straightens up in the dance to pose and because of her height it looks like a rise. I think Shirley is waay too harsh.
This woman can't dance
Are we still doing phrasing?!
this is disappointing i thought after her first dance she showed promise and potential but these last 2 dances have not been good she's in danger tomorrow i think Charlotte and Rev Richard will be in the dance off
She looks REALLY uncomftable
DANGER ZONE!!!
Welcome back old Brendan! We didn't miss you.
Surprising, if disappointing, lack of Archer related comments...
Well done Brendan for sticking up for your lady in a respectful way.  Shirley was unkind and Bruno joining in just made him look like a  bully
yasss the old Brendan is¬†back
Why the hell is this trending?
Why the fluff is this 11 on trending
If this was a dance that required 'Rise and Fall' the judges would probably have said that it was non existent. Bruno is the arch exponent of rise and fall, ¬†he can barely keep his posterior positioned on his chair.
i'm going to be generous with my remarks here. Charlotte definitely gets nervous beforehand and that affects her ability to dance. I think she played the character of the Tango very well actually. my mark¬†- 6.
A nice girl but a little stiff in the hips.
She should have gone home, just doesn't seem to care and no effort is shown, this dance would have been amazing if it was someone else
She is so graceful, but he pushes her about too much and makes the dance about himself. The dance would be much less stunted if he wasn‚Äôt pushing her around. Also do keep your mouth shut Brendan. You are the most unpleasant dancer we‚Äôve had on strictly, and you have no right to try and correct a judge, especially Shirley, head judge. Well done to Bruno to putting you in your place.
I'm surprised Brendan is still on the show as I don't think he has the spirit of it- too serious
I do see where everyone is coming from but brendon is just saying what he has to say because most peole just smile and nod their heads but i surpose everyone was being harah except charlotte
Charlotte is like a mannequin.
i like Charlotte...but my God...she is awful
Disaster, Charlotte is way too far to the right of Brendan which is distorting the frame. This seems like a rushed job as she appeases to be skipping along the floor which is creating the illusion that they‚Äôre using rise and fall which is not the way a tango should be done... Totally agree with Shirley. I score this a 3.
Brendan shouldn't have said there was no rise and fall until he'd watched the dance back. He'd made himself look a bit of an idiot after a few million of us had watched Charlotte rising and falling .....
As a dancer Charlotte is being throne round by Brendon because she is doing everything really bad like her frame no offence but also Brendon was very rude to the judges !
She‚Äôs just shit
Charlotte looks like  a homeless Taylor swift
They're through for another week
Charlotte gets nervous ,she looked great,but I bet she doesn't like showing so much flesh..that effects her dance routines..I thought harshly marked as much improvement...up to judges to give her confidence not tear into her.judges you can tell have their favourites...strictly possibly coming to the end of its run now!
Hm, I did like it though. Wasn't the best dance ever of course. But still enjoyable. I think the judges votes for them are more of a personal vote than a professional vote. They are really harsh on Charlotte.....
Beauty... But dead behind the eyes
Gosh i want her out, she's just not good
No sense of rhythm.
Mr I Fancy Myself Strikes again I really hate him
Why is this on trending? #8
Brandon is known to be hotheaded but for her sake he needs to be carafull. It's all about her, not him.
The problem with Brendan is that he is insufferable. Even if he is part of s fantastic dance I still don‚Äôt enjoy it.
She needs to feel more comfortable with Brendan, trust him and let him lead! Good week 1, but there is more improvement needed. 4/10
If she isn't in the dance off she needs to come back strong better than last week but not good enough that motorbike looks expensive, 5
Wow nice cute but the best
Change of the jacket and these two could easily play sandy and Danny üíô
I congratulate her on coming back from last week's display, but the potential of her Foxtrot in week 1 is becoming a distant memory.If she survives this week, I hope she starts a) enjoying herself and b)discovering some performance skills and characterisation-I think that would help her actually and Brendan for that matter.
better than last week but there is still room for improvement
A little improvement. Needs a little bit more improvement to get to week 4. 3
I wish the judges would stop being so harsh and having favourites!!! The dance was brilliant - I enjoyed it and I'm sure all #TeamCharcole fans enjoyed it as well!
I protect these two so much, Shirley may have been right about the rise and fall but no need to tear the poor girl to shreds. Feel like the judges have it in for team Charcole, Craig was actually the nicest! Well, despite it being 3rd from bottom, a HUGE improvement on last week, well done! Just keep building that confidence up, fingers crossed for team Charcole!
Most gallant of Brendan to defend his partner.  Especially considering that the head judge has a tendency to mark down the female contestants.
Wasn't impressed last week but was a big improvement however the judges were too harsh on Brendan but his comments weren't appreciated\n5
I'm disappointed. I said she'll pull it back with some ballroom this week, guess I was wrong. She could be in trouble. Not good. 4.
I don't see why people keep on hating on her ü§î I know she's not the greatest dancer there but can't u see the improvement from last week. Brendon's answering back has just ruined it for her Because now she's caught up between the judges and Brendon disagreement .From now on I'm only expecting low scores and I literally feel so sorry for her üò©üò≠.i just hope that the judges give her a chance to boost her confidence like how she was like at the beginning of the show
Trending? More like Tossed money at YouTube.\n\nYou really expect us to believe that this video that hasn't even hit 100k views in over a day is trending?\n\nGeeze just make a tab called  'Paid Promotions' please.
Brendon said he messed up....where in the routine did he mess up?
How is this trending üòÇüòÇ
Wooden horse comes to mind
I'm seriously annoyed with Brendan acting like that, saying Shirley doesn't know what she's talking about, but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
What's a rise and fall?
She‚Äôs hurtin‚Äô for a squirtin‚Äô
Someone please explain what rise and fall is?!?!?!
I no longer live where I can watch this live and am limited to the videos that are posted here on youtube.  A lot of the comments mention Brendan's comments.  What happened???
I'm actually on Brendan's side with the whole Brendan and Shirley conflict! I like how he defends himself. Not a huge fan of Shirley
Who else realises that Brendan has to make a speech every time him and his partner get slightly bad comments? - I can't be the only one. Right?\n\nBrendan was of course lying - that or he's a very bad choreographer. It had loads of rise and fall.
I apologize. Even though I'm a huge fan of the show, I don't know a lot about techniques of dancing and their names. What is a rise and fall? :)
Ok i seriously cant stop watching this and it's not just cus im a carat im actually obsessed with this
I just want to thank the person who filmed this masterpiece.
I wish seventeen was as recognized as bts like Exo and got7 are good but like SHINee and NCT and monsta x and seventeen there are a lot of low key kpop fans who don't know about other groups that are just as a good as bts
get this video to 1 mil !!
Sharing this song so far 2034 family and friends..  Shares thus far in Canada.  More shares thru Europe tomorrow.
the choreography is so awesome!\nSeventeen never fails me
What happened to little Dino why is he being rude
I came from watching 17project. They've really grown so much. Wishing all the best for Seventeen, they're really something else

F*ck this country. I'm done. The experiment failed. Thanks Cracked for showing this place is one running racist stupid insensitive joke.
We shouldn't let this distract us.  The most pressing issue we have is that we need to stop giving control over our nuclear arsenal to liars, psychopaths, and the mentally ill (I think that covers most of our presidents)
This is one of the best videos on YouTube. I've rewatched it a ton and shared it. Ignore the right wing people in comments Cracked, keep it up!
i honestly can't think of any way you'd convince gun owners to give up or even just regulate their precious, precious guns. doesn't matter how many people get murdered with them. anything that could possibly interfere with buying another sweetass firearm is too much, regardless of other people dying--they're just simply too selfish to give a damn.
Ok let's talk about gun control. Cars kill 10x more people yet more people want them. Why? It's it because it's useful tool? Now I don't go tell driving because it's dangerous and you have a chance of killing someone 10x more than guns. Also you say guns only kill. I'm sorry about what about sports shooting? Also let's look at NJ and CA, they are strict gun control states that also seems to have high gun crime for how strict the laws are. The best I have to say is it's a civil right. There should be no limitations as it states  shall not be infringed. The debate on if modern firearms count is stupid, they understood the concept of advancement in technology (they saw a musket go to a 15 round air rifle that could kill deer size animals). Lastly a quote that should mean something to everyone:  Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety. -Benjamin Franklin. So give up your rights, I'm not without a fight because without rights man cannot be free.
facts matter...and we need to be honest about them\n\nKill yourself.
Finally an American who gets it... great video
I think Trump may have been making light of a shitty situation. This vid is such nonsense I started rebutting things but thought I may get carpel tunnel.
I own guns to protect MY family. You call people with guns to come protect you...one way is immediate, and one way is slow.PEOPLE WITH GUNS SHOWED UP TO STOP A PERSON WITH A GUN IN VEGAS!! When you have a way to stop ALL people from killing in any way, call me (so how many people were killed when McVeigh used a truck and fertilizer, and not a gun?) . Its a mental issue problem, not a chosen method problem. If you wave your magic pen and make ALL guns in the U.S. disappear, you can bet your anything-you-want they will come right across the border. Drugs are illegal, kids. That fixed the drug problem and didn't make cartels rich and powerful, huh? Hey, sarcasm IS fun! Thanks, cracked, but I think I'll keep my tools of life protection!
If cops didn't have guns, the criminals woudn't need them!!!!
So guns are tools that can kill people. Congrats you only started the obvious but saying that we need regulations to stop mass shooting will not in fact stop a mass shooting. You can try and regulate or even straight out ban guns but what does it do besides put citizens who want to protect themselves or their families in a tough spot. Another thing is that you perpetuate the gun show loophole and say criminals can get their guns without background checks... Accept that's not what happens. It's already against state and federal law for license fire arms dealers to sell guns without checking the person first. What about private sales... Not many people have to get checked for that... Then in that case it is the individuals at fault not the tools. A little side note criminals don't necessarily need to buy guns from the gun show. They can make their own or steal from others. Your emotions show a lot in this videos and while feeling are necessary for life don't let you feelings misconstrue facts. Suicides is another thing you bring up, and yeah I agree with a gun they are more likely to kill themselves with a gun. However there are multiple weapons to kill oneself if not ways. The shooter was a coward and so are the majority of you for using that massacre to up your political agenda gun regulations and gun bans, because even in the end it's not gonna change a thing. You can regulate the gun or even flat out ban it. Criminals will find a way to do what they want even if it means taking the lives of some if not many.
The willful ignorance of some of these comments...is just...incredible. Like, did you even WATCH the videoü§î
So many people here are crying and complaining about guns in US. There are far more shootings in the EU! This is both in terms of frequency and annual death rate from shootings. They also last longer in EU. Most Shootings in the US last 5 minutes. In the EU they sometimes last for days. People in the EU are disarmed and more over, the police in EU don't have the proper tools once arriving on scene. The often flee cause they are overpowered. Not only can't the public protect themselves, the police in EU can't protect themselves. People call the shooting in Las Vegas that biggest mass shooting in modern American history with 59 people dead. But, in EU, shootings with hundreds of people dead is actually not uncommon, and EU is even smaller than the US! Why is it that when something in the US happens, the whole world will talk and hear about it in the media for long periods. When something happens elsewhere the media doesn't pay much attention to it! My Chinese girlfriend tells me often about hundreds, sometimes thousands of people, either killed or abducted in China. Why don't we here about that in the media. The Whole world is heavily controlled by media propaganda, including the US. Anybody who talks trash about the US has either never been here or maybe they only traveled to High Crime cities like Chicago, Washington DC, New York, Los Angeles and so on. These little hives and nests are not the whole of the US!!! I lived 20 years in Europe, in many different countries. I lived in China for 3 years. I now live in Colorado US and I have never been happier or safer than now. Please check out the link for facts! ¬†https://www.thejacknews.com/law/gun-rights/the-united-states-does-not-have-more-mass-shootings-than-europe/
I'm good with more gun control or limiting weapons to handguns, shotguns and small mag rifles.  \n\nI'm not good with Comedy Channels forcibly debating their opinions down people's throat and not properly titling their video so I can avoid it.   \n\nRight wing, left wing, liberal or conservative I don't care what you have to say.  Just go fight with each other on some properly titled political debate forum and leave your opinions out of media.
The magical  something bannr was a nice touch
is defense an argument?
What's it going to take?  Well I know what this guys gonna take...a big dick in his asshole because he's a sissy bottom fag that likes to be subjegated. I'm a hard hitting top because I like taking care of business and also like to be able to defend myself if/when something bad happens. Keep being a bottom sissy fag and bad shit will continue to happen.
yes, guns were invented to kill people. some of us don't want to be at the mercy of mobs which may or may not include governments. this is a classic example of how leftists only think in terms of solutions instead of what is actually possible in the reality place where all of us actually live.
All discussion leads to the same effect.  Infringing on rights, be it right to arms or right to privacy. Rehashing the terms Common Sense and join the discussion is collectivist, statist lingo and is part is why there are already so many over reaches on the fourth and second amendment in the country.  Its for the good of society! we hear, like in this video, but there actually isn't any evidence to support that claim one way or the other.  \n\nIf that is the case, loose opinions on effectiveness in either direction I'm going to side with individual freedoms in opposition of the mob.
I was right there with Cracked for once until I heard the spin about Cop on Black violence and how...Left out certain information was. Like how cops are more likely to kill white people than black people, or how black people kill more black people than cops kill black people. But its cool, we can pick out certain information and make it sound like theirs a problem when there isn't.
0:34 Tool invented for murder.\n\nThat's how far I made it. Calling a firearm a 'tool invented for murder' puts your ignorance on such fantastic display as to disqualify you from commenting further without being laughed at by anyone who actually knows what the fuck they are talking about. Remember to recycle, donate to your local charities, and shut the fuck up about things you know nothing about unless you want to look like a fool.
Planned Parenthood gives about 10 times the amount of money to Democrats every year that the NRA has given in the past several decades. Do organizations with private agendas donating vast sums of money to influence politics bother you or is it only a problem when they lobby for something you disagree with?
For all those citing Australian and U.K gun laws as an example for the U.S to follow, you have to provide a 'Genuine Reason/Good Reason' for a Firearms Licence. Self defence is *NOT* considered a 'Genuine Reason/Good Reason'...
lets talk about why the band and photographers never get pooped do they like pop and country do they want to be recorded no its a fucking hoax and I predict the band and photographer get pooped next hoax::)))may the farce be with you:dylan storm trooper king of the zionist whopper and promoter of boring star whores movies:)adam ass boogers jew lanza was the 2nd pooper on the grassy knoll::)))lmfaao don't hire idf security or buy gold
I know that this is cracked, and that it is a humor site, but if you stop throwing jokes into a topic like this, I might be able to take you seriously.
I have a 9mm and an AR 15 and I am a veteran. Guns are used for killing ppl. Target practice is fun. Although I have never taken mine to a range as a civilian, i get it. But guns are for killing. I learned how to fire my weapons at human shaped targets bcuz blood makes the grass grow  Bcuz..... they are used and made to kill
Well, to everyone saying glad I don't live in the US living in constant fear of being shot it's really not bad. I have never been afraid of getting shot by some random person and I live in a place where 4/5 cars have a gun in them. Hell, people carry weapons daily, there are 3 gun shops within a block of each other, and even the wal-mart sells guns! It's not the wild west, there aren't shootouts going on. The biggest issues are the drugs tbh, and those are illegal too so idk
Want to have an honest conversation? Start by being honest yourself.\n\nThere is no gun show loophole, or online loophole (not mentioned in the video). If you buy a gun from a dealer, you need a background check, even at gun shows. If you buy a gun online, it's shipped to a dealer so you can do a background check. Most states do not require background checks for private purchases. If your buddy sells you a gun or you want to buy a gun from someone you met on a local forum (and will meet face-to-face for the purchase) you don't need a background check. It doesn't matter if you're at your house, a Walmart parking lot, or a gun show. A private transaction is a private transaction.\n\nThe CDC is not barred from researching gun violence. They can't use federal funds to push for gun control. That was done because there were people in the CDC with an agenda that outright said they would do as many studies as they needed to find the evidence that proved their point about gun violence. That's not how research works. You find data and draw a conclusion, not start with a conclusion and find data to fit.\n\nThe NRA isn't even near the top of organizations that donate money to legislators. They win because gun owners go out to vote.\n\nPer the video, there is no correlation between guns and murders, but there is a correlation between guns and gun deaths. No shit. Just like places with more cars have more car deaths, or more pools means more pool deaths. It's just statistics. If you want to reduce deaths without taking guns away you need to be productive: safety education, mental health (to prevent suicide), so many other things like universal healthcare, a good education, a living wage.\n\nThere are dozens of countries with a higher suicide rate than the US. Guns aren't the only factor and taking them away from people that don't want to kill themselves or others won't fix it.\n\nRealistically, what will it take to limit guns in the US? If nothing happened after Sandy Hook or Vegas, nothing will happen. It would take huge political effort to amend the constitution and get tens of millions, potentially over a hundred million Americans to give up. And for what? There are hundreds of millions of guns in the US. More are manufactured to equip police and military around the world. Law-abiding citizens may give up their guns but criminals will keep theirs. Legal guns become undocumented.
Ban hand guns and semi-auto rifles. That alone will significantly decrease shootings. Enact a 5 year program where you can turn in those weapons. It would take time but it would help a lot in the long run.\n\nBolt action, lever action, double barrel, and single shot long guns (in other words shotguns and rifles) are the only ones that civilians should have access to. Also limit magazine capacities to no more than 10 rounds.
replace fire arms with zappers, and made fire arm illegal unless you are in an army. then. get better police. star to make trials to those politics that get money for corporations, they got a salary for avoid that.
to everyone who is for gun control and hysterically calls trump a Nazi in the same breath, do you really want the government to exclusively have the rights to guns? let me pharse that differently in case you don't understand; do you really want Nazis to exclusively have the rights to guns? you are aware of how that ends historically right?
This isn't an discussion it is a political stance being presented in a un-nuanced and emotional argument.  This is fine, but the article is about why we keep putting off the discussion.  The reason we keep putting off the discussion is because people on both sides are so entrenched that they talk about gun like this.  And you can't have conversations when people talk like this.  So to answer the question in the title, Why do we constantly avoid talking about gun control because people to discuss things they want to make their point.  Perhaps this article should be Why don't people agree with me yet about gun control.\n\nTo pretend it isn't a complicated issue denies the fact about how divisive it its.  Of course if all you want it likes from like minded people go ahead and make a video about people who disagree with you.
wow, you sound so scared...man up, buy a gun
I love you guys but y‚Äôall have a serious diversity problem....
if the¬†some prime figure¬†who¬†stands for¬†no gun control got shot.that would be game changer. and ironic.
Meanwhile your USA army drops bombs on civilians and hospitals, killing many innocents. Whoops, mistake is what you read in the media and you take it for granted and never speak your mouth about that. It's just the middle east right, not our people and kids who died, plus it was Obama at the top. You can't of course critize black presidents, that's racist right. Bunch of liberal hypocrits.
This show is the best thing on Cracked (after After Hours).
Ya know, it's too bad that the Vegas shooter was in a gun free zone, because maybe if some responsible gun owners were around for that, there could have been less casualties. But hey, just wait for the cops to save you. 73 minute response time perfectly acceptable..
I immediately stopped watching the video the second this dipstick condescendingly said, Oh so now you wanna ban guns? to even the mere words gun control even though regulated is in the Constitution in the part that's called the 2nd Amendment.\n\nThe words are, A well regulated *militia*..., which refers to a member of the militia, NOT a firearm. It's this kind of intentional twisting of words to make a straw-man argument that makes it so frustrating to have a reasonable discussion with people who want gun control.\nFor clarification, the first part of that sentence states the need for the State to draw from the populace an armed and orderly fighting force (regulated) under a command structure (the State). The second part of the sentence makes it clear that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon an American citizen, which is what a militia is created from (not to be confused with a standing army).\n\n\nIf people like this can't be honest about their arguments, how can we trust they'd be any better about finding an honest solution?
This is wrong on just about ever substantive point; the rebuttals of pro-gun arguments (some of which themselves are weak) are flaccid.\n\nso you want to ban guns? - um, yes, that's the obvious extension of your logic. And gun control advocates are on record as saying as much.\n\nOn regulated - yes, and if you knew how to read, you'd know that refers to the militia, not the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nOn knives, and the many other purposes - guns also have many other purposes. Lots of people hunt, shoot clays, participate in competitions, and other things. And let's not forget that sometimes, killing is an unfortunate necessity. Oh, and let's not forget, there are plenty of cases of knife attacks, including a major attack in China in 2014 that killed 31 people (not including the perpetrators) and injured 143 others (which is to say, the use from the 32nd floor bit is retarded).\n\nOn doing things that don't involve guns - again, this dismisses the fact that there are lots of legitimate uses of guns. Not to mention illustrative of your general hoplophobia. Or your willingness to sacrifice your rights when they have no bearing on your personal life (which is to say, you're being a selfish twat). \n\nPeople with guns frequently use guns to shoot people with guns - um, no. There are 300 million guns in the US owned by a fairly sizeable chunk of the population. The percentage of gun owners who commit murder with guns is vanishingly small. Talk about skewing facts to avoid truths.\n\nOn the gun show loophole - this is a misnomer. It's not gun shows that are the problem, but private party sales. Gun shows are by law gun stores, which means background checks are required for any sale on the premises. That doesn't mean, however, that you as a private individual can't meet another private individual at a gun store, then go make the purchase off the premises. For the record, Crowder is a moron, and universal background checks are one piece of gun control I agree with. But you'd get a lot further if you didn't use easily deflected language to describe the issue.\n\nMurders and suicides are completely different in almost every way, and the two problems are not solved the same way. In fact, murder isn't even a homogeneous category - gang-related murder is not the same problem as domestic murders, and again, won't be solved the same way. And on suicide specifically, there's really no evidence that stronger gun control will have an effect. Yes, there is the example in Britain with the changeover from coal gas to natural gas, but more relevantly, Canada experienced no change in the suicide rate when they enacted stronger gun control laws. Yes, suicide by gun went down, but it was simply replaced by other methods.
I am all for gun confiscation. Just pass a law where all the beta cuck liberals and tough talking cat ladies on Faceberg go door to door confiscating them. That sounds great. You don't have a right to a car. And no - the majority of gun owners do not want more gun laws. That's a lie. That's like saying dope fiends want more drug laws and the police to screw with them even more. There is Gun Show Loophole. Those are called private transactions.
There is ample gun control, nobody enforces it. Get the government to do their job. The firearms are already here, so more regulation takes rights from law abiding citizens. Don't forget when they pass a bill, they also sneak in other things and that is what concerns me. Bump stocks in my opinion gimmicky so I don't care either way. So regulating or banning them is fine nothing else. A highly trained person with a single shot bolt action could have just as much damage unfortunately
NRA members are so obsessed with the constitution and their right to bear arms, they'll NEVER change things in ways that could possibly limit gun use. They're idiots and they'll risk innocent lives in order to uphold (and take to logical extremes) their gun rights.
You mention bill clinton is a rapist, what do you think will happen when all gun disappear?
Is this the same Cracked that tries to compete with Mad Magazine?   Well you still don't understand what the purpose of the 2nd amendment is about, when you understand that then we can have a civil discussion about a human right
I am not really a firearm supporter, but I am a weapons collector. I do not think there should be any limitation on what weapons you may have with you, loaded or not, in public. I do however support weapon licenses. In fact I would much prefer a license/merit based system for most potentially dangerous rights.
No that's not Capitalism - That is Curruption !!

Great video
So, we just need to out-bid the NRA to own a government.
This is kind of a one sided argument this guy is making. Guns are here to stay and always will be. Owning a gun shouldn't place you in a category in which you are called a crazy person nor should someone who doesn't support gun rights be catagorized as a b****. Owning a firearm is not wrong. The constitution makes it very clear that a citizen has the right to own arms. The Vegas shooting and all other gun related incidents and mass shootings are real tragedies but putting the blame on a object and not the person is not the way to deal with a problem. The average person or the average Joe who owns a firearm does not have the intent of committing crimes with the firearm. For what ever reason a person wants to own a firearm. If they are able to and legally doing so then it is there right to own a firearm
Man Cody that smug asshole Marxism mentality will get trump elected again in 2020. Keep up the great work prick
The shots at Steven Crowder are pretty unfair. I'm willing to say that Crowder's investigation could be somewhat inconclusive, but to claim he's lying to everyone and then using an isolated incident to as your only evidence, without giving any extra context or sources just makes you look like a fucking propaganda machine. If you are going to call someone out, do it the right way. Not only that but it appears there is a gross misunderstanding of Crowder's footage as Cracked specifically pulled clips from the more over the top scenes. There are plenty of other scenes where Crowder is not acting suspicious. I want to give Cracked the benefit of the doubt, but no solid evidence is really given because we don't have most of the sources, we just have their word.
Lack of gun control is definitely impacting tourism. I for one am never going to visit the US until people stop carrying weapons.
Was great till the race thing.. Then it was racist.
you and every home-invader/ rapist in america agree; ban equalizers in self defense situations. Lets make sure victims can't fight back.
Boo! I'd kill for my kill sticks! Try to take my kill sticks and I might just kill _you!_\nkill
I am for gun control up to the point but not before where the Government looses it's fear of it's own People.
CANT TAKE MUH HI CAPACITY GHOST CLIPS...seriously, they're mine and you can't have them.
Laws don't prevent anything. Speeding, murder etc. So talk, complain, heck you can even cry. Americans will continue to vote for  their rights and against those who want to take them away. Assuming you are 100% correct...which is laughable...but even if you are...I still want my rights and will vote against anyone  taking them away.
shot for holding a toy gun\nyeah, because a cop could definitely tell a real and fake gun apart in a split second while his life depends on it.\nAnd by saying what will it take is just leveraging your point on a tragedy, which is shameful.
Because u can't control guns, u shouldn't, is not about control is about understanding, that a never ending problem no1 is whilling to talk about, so fuck u
+Cracked-- Largest mass shooting in modern US history. Many things; Prey tell,  what was The largest?  The fact that we are ranking them now? Any other countries with higher records? (at least we're still good at something)  Non gun owners represented in Red? (Foreshadowing?) Where are your statistics coming from if a collective study isn't allowed?    Ps You hiring writers? I sooo would have nailed that insert joke here bit.
Vegas shooting didn't happen, no one died. The shots were coming from the speaker. Nice try CIA but it was faker then Sandy Hook.
Cracked has cracked. More than a third of people in the US have guns. The VAST majority are perfectly responsible people. How about we don't try to paint every gun owner as a mass shooter, m'kay? I'm all for reasonable gun laws, but this video is more partisan than the KKK.
I‚Äôm tired of people holding up other nation‚Äôs violations of our fundamental rights as human beings as an excuse to commit similar violations in the United States.  It‚Äôs horribly fallacious.  Just stop.
You guys are getting just a liiiiiiiitle out of touch. I'm sad to say, the unsubs are coming.
Murder is already illegal. The inanimate object did not kill anyone.
People with guns FREQUENTLY use those guns to try to shoot people A little research would prove this incorrect. More guns than people in this country, but I'm sure we all FREQUENTLY use those guns to kill. Makes sense.
Well regulated back in the day meant, well supplied, well funded!! The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed! Amend the Constitution first, till then, it's the law of the land.
so it was bad to take the guns away from black people in the 60's right?  so its ok to take them away from everyone now?  not sure i follow.  so yes most gun control laws are racist and people dont support racist gun control laws so we dont need more laws against guns.
i love this so much <3\ntook the words out of my mouth
Part of the problem is that your bringing up gun control instantly lead into telling people not to own them at all. A reasonable discussion of gun control can't be had with idiots shouting shall not be infringed!, but it also can't be had with idiots shouting your hobby kills people!\n\nThat said, your auto industry analogy was very well made. Stick with that one if you're actually trying to be reasonable. I'm all for gun control, and for some bans... though I find it funny that these mass shootings of relatively well-to-do white people garner national outcry for weeks when they comprise a drop in the proverbial bucket next to urban killings with handguns. Black lives matter only until some crazy asshole shoots up a country music concert.\n\nYou want positive change? Stop lobbying for magazine size restrictions or banning certain rifle grips (both will accomplish nothing and alienate a lot of otherwise reasonable people). Lobby for more extensive background checks, waiting periods on handguns, mandatory registration at both local and federal level. Also, fund the ATF. Their budget has been neutered for decades. Reasonable measures, not fear-mongering ignorant bullshit.
I know convicted felons that currently own AK‚Äôs. They sure as shit didn‚Äôt get them from Walmart. This Vegas shooter had military grade weapons. I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt go into a gun store for those either. You can make all the regulations you want. It‚Äôs not going to help. This guy knew what he was doing. Nevada is an open carry state. If this guy unloaded down on the street, people would‚Äôve been firing right back. But instead, he decided to hide in a high rise hotel.  You can have all the laws you want. There‚Äôs even a law against killing people. Doesn‚Äôt stop anyone from doing it
7:03 I have access to a toaster and a bathtub, car and a garage and a fork and an outlet, public roadways, industrial sized Tylenols and rope and a ceiling fan
Guns can also destroy things that aren't alive, or that were just alive. Checkmate
Try to take gun rights and you will witness the largest mass shooting in all history. Unless you want to call it a war.
Well regulated doesn't mean gun control you dumbass. Regulate in the historical constitutional sense means 'to make regular'.

If my ancestors in Europe had guns then they would not have been Holocausted
The NRA and RNC both ban guns from their conventions. Why aren't gun owners first attacking them for banning guns instead of attacking people advocating for gun regulation (non-ban) discussions?
One thing that never gets mentioned. We've always had guns, for a long time. So why is it only now people are going places and shooting people? If it's not the guns, and it can't be if we've had guns as long as we have, what is it? Because in the end, if the Vegas shooter couldn't get a gun, he may have built a bomb, or something like it. Which is worse, at least in my opinion. I think we need to stop blaming guns (gun regulation is still a good idea, and should be researched better) for killing those innocent people and look at ourselves. What is our society doing to produce homicidal maniacs like him? Sure, there is will always be sadists and perverts, but why are there so many shootings compared with the past? I Have some theories, but it doesn't matter what I think. What matters is, while gun regulation is a good idea, that we focus on the root of the problem. Why are people all of a sudden blowing up buildings in New York, and waltzing into elementary schools with guns, and becoming neo-nazis, or how about putting porn in everything but kids shows? Saying curse words every other phrase? Why is this happening? Why is society choosing morally wrong actions, and then forcing everyone else (shooting victims, minorities, and literally everybody else) to suffer the consequences? That is the root of the problem. If you haven't already I suggest you read Fahrenheit 451. It's themes correlate with this stunningly. But, back on point, it doesn't matter what you do. Banning guns won't solve the problem, maybe in some ways, but it will cause new problems. The government can't fix society, and it's not fair we demand it does. It needs to start with us. We all need to make sure we live our lives with respect towards one another, and remember we all make mistakes and anger will destroy us, even if another person deserves it. We need to end political polarization and tear down private prisons. We need to look at the root of our problems. We can blame Obama for rising health care costs, or we can rightfully blame insurance companies for demanding ridiculous discounts, forcing hospitals to shoot up the price. Whatever you beleive, Obama was trying to help, and so are those that oppose him. (I fall into the latter category) we all want cheap, quality healthcare. But the root of the problem is lost when singular people, places and things get blamed. So let's find what the root cause is, and execute it with extreme prejudice.
Shitlib faggot. Our guns are the only thing protecting your free speech.  DUMBASS!!!  If not for our guns the jackboots would stand on your next and tell you to tow the line or take an ass raping.  \n\nEmotional liberal nonsense was annoying in the 90s with the rapist in the white house, now you commie Che Guevara cock sucking snowflake fucks are just pissing off the sane people left in this bankrupt NSA fap & war state. \n\nGrow the fuck up..
Australia did not had constitutional right to own guns. Mandatory buyback would start civil war. And also 80+ people were killed in France using a fucking TRUCK. Lets ban trucks
Congress can start with banning the sale of bump stocks and high cap magazines... \nI'll bet nothing happens... \nagain...
You managed to ignore during your guns only kill rant, the most important reason for the 2nd Amendment-  the prevention of a tyrannical government.
Correction - Cars drive and kill. Guns protect and kill.... to say the only use of a weapon is to murder, you're severely off base.
Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. How has that worked out for them?
Can someone honestly and seriously explain to me what the FUCK the CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL has to do with GUNS?! I mean, call me crazy, but I always foolishly assumed that the Centre for Disease Control dealt with such things as DISEASES: outbreaks, mutations, treatments, developing inoculations (which apparently a large percentage of you won't even use anyway because you're so fucking stupid you think that it's safer to not take the chance your kid might somehow spontaneously develop autism as a side effect of vaccination, instead of ensuring they have a LIFETIME PREVENTATIVE from contracting a highly contagious and DEADLY disease. Smallpox may not be the danger it was 150 years ago, but it hasn't ACTUALLY been eradicated and cases are still reported regularly in countries such as Africa.... but that's a whole other rant for another day üòÅ). \n\nBack to my initial question: as much as the American gun obsession has been referred to as a disease, IT ISN'T ACTUALLY A REAL DISEASE. You won't be bitten by some kind of radioactive spider or tick or mosquito, or be exposed to gamma radiated germs whenever someone sneezes, which will cause you to spontaneously decide guns are awesome, I must have more guns, I must have all the guns, I need bigger guns that can fire more bullets, dear god, someone give me more guns. So WHY in the name of all that is... well, not a bunch of hypocritical selfish fucking bastards, would a DISEASE authority being doing research into the safety of guns?!?! \n\nSincerely, \nA very confused Australian who was a teenager at the time of Martin Bryant's Port Arthur Massacre (world record holder for a decade, Aussie Aussie Aussie) and who was inordinately proud of her country for standing up and saying, take these guns away and make sure this never happens again and the Government DID (John Howard will be immortalised in Australian history none of us will ever actually read forever for this one decision), who was also HORRIFIED when the Columbine High School Shooting happened, and NOTHING IN YOUR COUNTRY FUCKING CHANGED. Aussie guy, injures and/or kills men, women, children, teens, tweens, grandparents, etc, whole country rewrites its gun laws. Teenagers shoot up a high school, killing and/or injuring mostly teens and some adults, and the best that happens is a guy makes an award winning documentary about it which is derided by the very people it's trying to help. \n\nSeriously, I just don't understand. What's wrong with you? Why do you care so little for your own countrymen? How can you be so selfishly callous? \n\nBut more pertinently, what the FUCK does the CDC have to do with GUNS?!?!?!?
I am a strong proponent of the 2A, but you have completely dismantled bad arguments by being blunt and intelligent, actually changing my opinion. While I will don't agree Australia is the arbiter of perfect gun control I do somewhat like the look of Canada's laws.
Mass shootings make me uncomfortable about going out in public.  So I bought a gun.  Multiple guns.  I feel better now.  I encourage you to do the same.
How do you prevent crazy?
Who the hell are you talking about?! The reason you don't hear about it is because you don't follow it! You have no idea how many gun laws get enacted each year in CA! As an actual gun owner that follows the law, we hear about the gov trying to take our guns ALL THE TIME!\n\nJust because you don't seek it out doesn't mean it isn't happening. \n\n better gun regulations doesn't mean banning more things or creating more restrictive laws. \n\nAnd yes, most of you all want to ban guns for private citizens. \n\nCriminals can legally buy vehicles, not firearms. \n\nJesus Christ. I wish I could actually have a conversation with you. You are arguing things that are inconsequential. \n\nHere's the bottom line; do you support the constitution or not? The constitution DOES. offer Congress the authority to add amendments, so the second amendment CAN be changed. Just remember, so can the first, because the founding fathers had no idea about the internet or tv or radio. So why should your 1st amendment right extend to anything further than your mouth and handwriting?
Insanity reigns.  Just checked and Bump stops are sold out everywhere or sales halted.  Prices skyrocketed to 400-500%.\nHundreds of people want a gun that can kill dozens and wound hundreds in a couple of minutes.  MASS INSANITY HAS TAKEN HOLD.
How about we take care of the mental issues that pretty-much EVERY mass shooter has demonstrated?
Wouldn't a better comparison to guns be bombs and how insanely easy it is to make them?
I enjoyed this video!
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
8:08 thanks for the fan service george
This story is a jewel. I have researched the history of computing in the Warsaw Pact countries and it is wonderful to see the quality of this work. I am grateful. Thank you very much.
7 minutes in and I still don't see the point this video is trying to make...
The animations were my favourite part, Dad Gorg continues to raise the bar for everyone.
Great, informative video! In Finland, we also had commodore programs broadcast over the radio so you could record it on a cassette.
I come close from Koblenz and i wondered why i could never find a NES. gameboy. SNES or any other console/pc on a fleamarket.\nThey didn't have that shit lol.
Great video as always George. I saw a cip from  Curse of the grey elephant at 6:40, did you watched it? Because i would be interested in your thoughts about it.
I spat my drink out when he pronounced comparison , instead of comparishon*
Surely Michael Gorbachev takes some credit for the wall?
I loved the music choices in this vid. And this was a very interesting topic.
That's some great parents.
Okay, seriously, why didn't it show up in my subscription box despite me having you subbed and the bell on?
imagine the games we could create if east germany rose again\nI'd be the leader of the new gdr and I'd allow war games as long as they where through perspective of eastern countries
Your videos keep making this political scientist smile. Keep up the good work
This is one of many reasons as to why I do not support Socialism/Marxism
Born in the GDR in 1981, I am one of those people who suffered from the lack of video games in the early childhood. My first and only gaming experience before the fall of the iron curtain was a few minutes of River Raid (shown in this video). Even after the reunion it took me a little while (christmas 1991 to be exact) to get my first console (the SEGA Master System), because money was short for most former eastern germans and electronic was very expensive (an empty cassette tape for example costed 20 Mark which is around 40-50$ by today's standard) . For a whole year I had only Alex Kidd and Sonic to play, followed by Sonic 2 the next christmas. I'm not really sad about it because I learned to appreciate what I had instead of being jealous of what others had. It had a unique kind of fascination to try out a new game back then and that's what I'm missing today.\nAfter all I (and the former GDR in general) quickly caught up with the latest technology and by the time the fifth generation of video games (N64, Playstation, Saturn) came we were on the same level as the rest of the world, if not earlier.\nWe may have missed some precious childhood experiences back then, but we also learned to respect video games in a way most people didn't :)
And that's why I dislike communism.
Everytime governments think they've controlled markets, people make their choices anyway. This is why black markets exist.
If only communism would've actually been a good way to run a country and not make everyone hate it and want to leave, because ultimately it's not in our nature to behave that way.\nI was born way past that time, but it does sound like a fucking nightmare. By the by, I never learned stuff like this in school. All we ever talked about was how bad Hitler was and nothing else, like what our country was actually like.
With people even resorting to broadcasting source code to each other over the radio... \n\nLook at what lengths these people went to make games work back then! Meanwhile publishers like 2K can't be bothered to get 2K18 under freaking 16 GB for the Switch...
btw dendy is a chinese system and was simultaneously on market with sega16bit and ps1 (n64 and snes too but no one ever cared about nintendo)
This is 44th in trending right now.\nNever expected you to be there but I'm glad nonetheless, great video George.\nBut when's next TOVG podcast bruh?
wow this video made it into youtube's trending, well deserved in my opinion
I strongly recommend to the people who liked this video to watch the Dendy russian video about an angry russian dude (acting like the AVGN) talking about his childhood playing those NES knockoffs and ports of newer games on that nes hardware. It's very interesting and fun to watch!
When it worked.\n\nIt never worked. That's why the lines and the poverty were so different when the unification happened.
But nintendo is eastern.
So this might be an influence to why Yager made the most prolific anti-war war game to date?
I had never thought of, or even thought to think of, gaming in the Eastern Bloc.\nExcellent topic choice, and as usual, excellent video.\nThank you for this!
That museum was very cool. Really liked seeing the old games and tech.
lol, my mum didn't see a pineapple till she was 18, let alone video games
I visited the museum last year with my college class it was extremely interesting(The pain station was the center piece of our whole time there, did you play it bunny?) but they never quite went into how the machines etc. were programmed that was very interesting finding it out from this video. \nDid you manage to get to the DDR museum bunny? I found it very interesting as well.
Haha communism really suck. It will never work out, ever.
was fun to hear about my  homeland on this channel ^.^
I dig the sad Tetris theme
It is shocking that East Germany were way behind Poland (my homeland country neighboring with former East Germany) in video games field. In Poland were not produced home computers in late 80' nevertheless they were imported from West Germany (Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and later Amiga). At these times on flea markets you could get many games (of course pirated but back then in Poland were not defined anti-piracy law) therefore we could play many different games from the west. In Poland video game consoles became popular in early 90' when communism was overthrown and one of Polish company imported Taiwan famiclones (Famicom/NES clone) known today as Pegasus. To be honest I miss these days, it was really good times.
It depresses me to know that my parents and other relatives back in Romania had to live and grow up under these conditions and I only narrowly avoided being born under Communism.
But games aren't political though.
What is this? WHAT IS THIS!?? An American talking about something from beyond the Iron Curtain? And doing proper research on it? And presenting it in a bearable manner? my compliments go to that!\n\nWhen I clicked on the video I seriously expected it will be all like HUHUH, they didnt have NENTENDUH, HUHUH, they suck!
Hi, German here. What do you mean by Hasselhof was not responsible for tearing down the wall?
The Hudson river, two years ago...
This is also the case in all of the former soviet bloc countries. Taping software/games on cassettes in order to share them to the few people who had some sort of bootleg commodore 64 was common practice.
I am glad that Marxism did not prevail in the free world.
The Stasi secret police museum is actually not very far away from the video game museum. It's 10 minutes on the train system they have there.
It's not that related to the topic at hand, but that museum is great. In there you can have a chat with one of the first chat bots called Eliza, created in the 60-s. When I was there I told it it's 2014 and it told me I'm insane.\n\nThey also have the weirdest arcade pong machine called Pain station. You move the bar by rotating an analog tumbler with your right hand, while your left hand is pressed against a metal grate with electric contacts. If you take your left hand off that grate, you lose. The gist is - every time you miss a ball, random danger zones appear on the screen. If your opponent, who is in a same position as you, hurls the ball into those zones, your left hand gets either slapped with a thick rubber band, heated with really hot air or zapped through the contacts. We've had enough after like 5 minutes. The record holder, as we were told, has managed to endure this for several hours.
amazing ingenuinity on part of east german programmers, even if their gaming industry never kicked off\nimagine playing western games for hours so that you can make your own copy from scratch and discussing coding with other programmers through (non-electronic) mail\nhats off to people like andre wei√üflog
Channels like this are making youtube more serious planform than a national tv. But than again there are much more stupid stuff on youtube.
1:06 I live in berlin and never knew about this sooooo....yeah ;)
Thank you great video. Much needed.  We are still susceptible to the temptations and failed promises of socialism.
Man.. I can't watch this anymore. It's too depressing.
Sounds like current year gaming politics.
4:45 very interested in this but I'm having trouble finding more info about having software on a vinyl disc.
Dude, you really have a lot of talent. As cliche as it sounds, this really has a lot of meaning in the scientific community as it stands in america. The government holding back its citizens in scientific discovery is mind boggling.
Thats a new subject matter. DANKA  I am makeing subscrib to wonderful YouTubes channel.
How can Cloth Map be making 16 grand a month to visit Eurovision and you're hear making amazing content like this and selling George Socks to survive?
Eastern European countries actually were making imitations of zx spectrum (commodore) and we had them all over the USSR in the 80s. We had all the games on pirated cassette tapes sold all over the street markets.
I think your video is on trending, at least on mine it seems. \n\nGood to see hard work pay off.
I wish I were employed and not just an intern, to support you on Patreon >_> Hopefully I can do it in the future, you totally deserve it!
Makes me feel blessed to live in a time where I can buy any pc or console and any game for it...
The Soviets were going to make a Nintendo knockoff called the Dendy?\nNot the –î–µ–Ω–¥–µ?\nI'm not doubting you at all, but that is so weird...
Your work is so good and very appreciated.
Now I want to see a period film about a ragtag but lovable group of young game devs living behind the iron curtain in the 80s
Holy shit my boy bunnyhop made trending? So cool to see!
When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
This is pure ideology.
When Clair de Lune started playing at the beginning I stated tearing up, god dammit Danganronpa V3
It is true the COCom list made it impossible for us as teenies to get hightech from western Europe, but these rules did not aplly to electronic scrap. Friends of mine in West Berlin sendet me vie postal service carefully seperatet/cutted parts in several packages and we buildet and soldet everything up again. :-) These C4 plus/ C-64 looked a little bit strange afterwards, but we had a working computer at the end. We were creative :-).
Makes me think of the gaming history of my own country somehow - especially the ripoff part haha
MY GOD!!!! Those animations are so realistic its uncanny
You've got to wonder sometimes.\nPart of the Soviet Block's problems were just a severe lack of industrial capacity.\n\nAround the time Communism took hold, if you compare Russia to the United states, one has massive amounts of industrial infrastructure, the other is still dominated by rural farmland and relatively little industry to speak of.\n\nYou might think it sad that all they managed is inferior knock-offs of western computer technology, but when you really stop and think about it, the fact that they could build semi-decent clones of this stuff at all was a major accomplishment in it's own right.\n\nComputer technology requires a LOT of resources to do effectively.\nSo much so that the most critical components are the product of maybe a half dozen factories at most.\nAn earthquake in a single country a decade or so ago, which crippled only one or two factories was enough to cut the global supply of RAM chips by 30%\n\nEast German computers huh.\n\nI guess given those restrictions, if you had the connections and wealth to get a machine imported in the late 80's it seems pretty clear to me you'd want an Amiga;\nSince you weren't allowed to have software... Yeah, that seems like the most impressive thing you could get if you had to make all your own software and tools for it...
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
This is REAL games journalism. We got SUper Bunnyhop here investigating cool as shit history on videogames and digging up contact info of developers from 30+ years ago, while Kotaku just says you're sexist for playing Minecraft.
This is some real games journalism bruh
I live in east Germany. :) The video is very good as always.
Amazing work George.
Man socialism sounds fun.
This is right-wing propaganda!!!!!!
great video

ICH BIN EINE GAMER!
Living in an Actual Communist Country, I can say a computer/laptop/video game console is worth several months of complete salaries. A desktop computer like 8-14 months, a laptop 3-20 months, VG console 12-13 months
>Capitalist Luxury
I remember a time when software companies would release a game, then not support it, then release a new system so that you would have to re-buy the game, AND the system.¬† We have it pretty damn good as Elite Dangerous gamers!¬† THANK YOU Frontier.
cant wait for the EXPLORATION YESS YESSS YESSSS !!!!! Finaly
Very happy with what is planned, I think the best thing they have planned is the codex, badly needed and will add way more depth and content to the game. Well done FDev.
NPC crew for small ships! !!!!
I don‚Äôt care what everyone else says, I am looking forward to this and am VERY happy with the announcements.
So THAT'S how they made the thargoid noise....never would have guessed!
Brace for cancer In the comments...
good to see them crack down on the core of the game finally, wish it happened sooner but hey.. better late than never. Also really excited to see this new generation of ship design we will be seeing!
Please please PLEASE overhaul player factions. This game desperately needs an end game which player-made factions could easily fill the hole.
Space loach bobble head?
Please no more rank grinding
All promising content reveals. My hope for ED is that it continues to grow & is supported through the next couple generations. The foundation/the palate to paint-upon, is there. But like the 1st explorers of our galaxy, we must find a patience within us that keeps our desire for it all, at bay, as to not cloud what already is there.\n\nIf you can find that place, you'll enjoy ED for what it is currently, while having realistic dreams about what is to come. \n\nWhich looks like an Alliance fleet & more dynamic planets (Yay!).\n\nQuality of life improvements on the core gameplay, especially to and from distant destinations, will help immensely. Like Galnet Audio.\n\nSimply listening to an engaging story about the Guardians, Thargoids or the Human race would be quite enjoyable while frame shifting through the black. We've all experienced reading something hud-related, only to be interdicted or miss a signal. I think the audio concept will eliminate that possibility while simultaneously keeping the player engaged. Not to dissimilar from driving today-Keep the eyes on the (neutron) highway while filling the ears with information.\n\nAlthough not mentioned, any HUD customization options Frontier could make available to consoles, would be greatly appreciated. I enjoy the orange aesthetic! But once saw a PC commander with bronze colored shield rings...and it looked SO right. Just a thought/suggestion.\n\nThank you for creating Elite dangerous and continuing to support it. It truly is a journey.\n\nSincerely and Respectfully, \nCommander Voltron IV (xbox)
Just popped back on after half a year away from the game. Took a passenger tourist mission worth 2.5mil for a few hundred ly. The last visitor beacon was 250kls from the main star, so I pulled up the Steam browser and Googled Elitge Dangerous Sucks while I waited. \n\nThis game just isn't for me. Too little challenge spread across too much time. It doesn't really sound like that's about to change.
I really like the game and bought horizons today. What i really don't like is the fact that i have to pay for a simple jacket for my hologram and ship skins after i did pay ‚Ç¨65  (77$) total for the game. I could understand that if it's a free game to play but this is just greedy.  Even the deluxe edition give some free skins and i did pay more cause i already bought the Mercenary Edition. Pay some respect to your customers and give them some skins and goodies for free.
Ah thanks 3303 but I've already died in my vulture a couple of times, I'm gonna take a break.
I wonder if the planets I have already explored will appear in the codex. Also loving all the content. I think i'll drop a few ¬£ in some cosmetics to make it clear. The way I see it my expansion pass is pretty much payed in full already.
Amazing narrative? You mean the bland blocks of text you call Galnet, amrite?
You know what? With all the thing they added inclusive the Thargoids beeing rather op for one ship alone this game can really be good soon. DOnt get me wrong I love ED but most of my friends stopped playing cause of the grinding, long mission where you just need to Jump 1000 times or emptiness. I would love to get my friends back in the game and with this stuff commin I bet you will get alot new players aswell.\n\nThe Thargoids alone are a reason for my friends to help me out they feel like a small Boss Battle I love it. If I would have a daughter you guys at Frontier would get the honor of taking her flower!
I think I would have been happier if Elite was only now being launched.  Having bought the game and the Horizons pass Elite is only now beginning to be a full game worth the money. Hopefully it can attract  some of the players that gave up long ago to give it another try.
Get rid of the dam warping mini game what a huge waste if time!!!
I waited over 20 years to play Frontier again!  Teenage years spent playing Frontier Elite 2 in UK it was a great game.  The one reason I bought a PS4 Pro was to play Frontier Elite Dangerous (the wife was not keen on a crazy priced laptop for one game!).  Now a 36 year old in New Zealand and still loving the atmosphere the game produces.  I sneak in about 4-5 hours play a week = not much but it's time well spent!  Thank you Frontier for a quality product.
I'm really happy with what I saw. I wonder if any of my old wingmen are still flying.
I'll believe it when I see it... late next year....
I'd like to see additional surface vehicles, and outfitting for them as well.
A Ship launched miner would be awesome with multicrew !
The amount of RNG in engineer mods in the game right now. If those personal narrative guns are as unique as told, then they worry me a lot....
I would love to see my crew onboard my vessel. Perhaps sitting on the bridge, or using npc spacelegs walking about.
Did I hear that right? Did they say that all of the content mentioned from the 2018 roadmap was going to be _free for all Horizons players?_
Does all look very nice and shiny, just a shame we have to wait a year for it all.
They are improving a bunch of core game mechanics such as better multiplayer interaction, improved exploration(I'm hoping this means they are adding more variety to procedurally generated nebulae and maybe even improving known nebulae) improved planetary exploration, better engineering, the type 10(what do you expect it to look like? Obviously it's gonna look like the type 9 it's a part of that series). They have gave you a reason to grind rank for the alliance, and obviously some bug fixes. So now they can work on either atmospheric planets or space legs. Or is there gonna be a problem that is just you and not the game? (Don't say I'm saying the game is perfect)
exploration carriers that can scan several light-years and give the probability of life in the systems it scans?
why are these expos always so cringe? why are they always so nervous? everyone is there for the same reason so relax and have some fun, especially the audience! The host had to work so hard to keep it intact... if your at the expo then maybe you should all be jumping out of your seats and be excited, it would put the developers at ease more and its a lot less awkward to keep telling the audience to settle with humor than having to encourage them to clap??? what is wrong with this world these days??? Why is everyone wound up so damn TIGHT? chill out, laugh, relax, its a game, not a un summit haha
As a clarinettist I'm going to making spot of Thargoid noises.
So...\nWhat about space legs.\nWhen are we going to see them or you know...\nBE ABLE TO WALK AROUND ON DOES FUCKING EXPENSIVE SHIPS THAT WE GRIND LIKE A MOTHERFUCKERS FOR. \nI'm just asking out of curiosity for a friend.
So, Thargoids = shitty space flowers? I'm really disappointed. This devs have zero imagination.
Why is it taking so long to overlay a simple optional wireframe grid on a planet surface, to help with navigation when it's dark (or for bad weather)? Even films as old as 'Alien' managed to portray that!
Whats your Gpu for run the game like in your teaser?! I have a 1080Ti and its not looks like that! We need more graphic option :/
Thanks for that FD!
Any mention of 4k option for the PS4 PRO and at least support for the PS4's camera for head tracking.
Cmon,i just need to know where the Monolith is and how can i see the You Win Screen at the End of the Grind(Game).
I'm only watching this because I like Sandy!
I really hope that the trade changes don't just come with stuff to make it easier, but also balance it out to make it more challenging with markets that respond to player action. So like, when some one or a group discovers something lucrative, there's a limited amount of farming they can do on that market before profits drop, so that a good trader will constantly be on the move looking for the best profits
Great stuff, I love passion for a craft!
Love the road map & where we are all heading CMDRS! Keep up the sterling work Frontier.
So if I find a thargoid base the location will be saved at the codex?
It's great to see continued support for this game,  great work guys.  Ps4 player
PvP fleet battles would be a fun addition
Lots of cool stuff the part that im most exited about is the update to the planets and the ships¬†computer Reading the news.
I was waiting for this because I missed the livestream. Thank you
Branching mission tasks someday with decision nodes ?
Elite: Dangerous = heavily slept on game
Sandro likes trex jokes???
MAKE POWERPLAY FUN (AGAIN, NOT)
Quality
I've got one thing to say to the Devs, grinding is not game play.
Thats gOOD! space legs can w8!
Ed lookin dapper AF
SPLENDID! <3
üëåüòä
The main problem FD have here is the impatience of the general public. Give 'em a rest guys.
Hello thargoids
Okay no space legs.... but hot damn I bloody like what I saw and heard here... good job Frontier üëèüëèüëèüëçüëçüëç
Sorry, expand what narrative? Maybe I missed it in my many hours of playing the game. I have yet to see any in game narrative. The player is dropped into the middle of nowhere with no direction given and if you never search the net you would have no clue as to what is going on in the game. So I ask again, what narrative are you planning on expanding?
What is that thing on his shoulder?
tbh, i only want 2 things from ed atm; i want at least another 10 yr on the jump range of my python, and the ability to equip at least one fighter. of course, that would shift the python from, arguably the best ship in the game, to, undisputedly the best ship in the game.
Chieftain requirements-aquire rank legend in alliance navy. mission grind incoming!
Personal narrative = massive grind
I would like Galnet Radio to have funny fake ads like GTA radio stations
again BLA-BLA-BLA(( Where CONTENT???
Very excited for Elite in 2018! Thanks FDev!
I really hope the exploration update improves jumping.  It's the exact same particle effect with the exact same sound, which you get to watch a hundred times during a gameplay session.  It needs something to spice it up, or it should take 1/4th the time.  I understand it's doing the Stellar Forge thing as well as finding sessions, but systems can be optimized.
Hopefully the Mamba, Moray and Boa find their way to ED too.
CLAP CLAP
i love the game, i have played this game in 124 on  3 mothns
everyones excited everyones passionate .. but none of them actually play the game ...
Hum... maybe this new lighting of theirs will allow the Mac version to have planetary landings?\nThe main thing holding back a Mac version of Horizons was, if I'm not mistaken, a shader incompatibility in the Mac's OpenGl library, correct?
I feel like Q4 2018 will be the day ED meets a lot of the expectations people had when it launched. Can't wait!
Coming Soon.... The  Narrative Expansion
Ed looks like he's cosplaying Peter Dinklage.
I take it we are going to have to pay for all these somehow? Cant say I am massively impressed. Where's the atmospheric planetary landings? Until we get that it just feels like half a game.
I got the feeling that ED's roadmap presentation is like watching a Microsoft keynote.
Maybe the team needs to take the quarter off and actually play their game .. On second thought one week off should suffice.
Just give us atmospheric planets that we can land on and I‚Äôll be happy... thanks bye
I can picture the q4 release already. It won¬¥t come in q4 2018, but hey... they didn¬¥t explicitly say that it¬¥s not going to arrive in 2018... so... they are still on time... I really enjoyed how the game started. Especially the amount of insight FDev gave us into the dev-process. but now, their newsletters are basically galnet, new cosmetics and a picture of a child touching a hotas. I miss when they actually seemed to do something :-(
They could of saved this for next year ..we waited to hear stuff for next year smdh I couldn't believe when they said it and the end of it at that..wow I'm so happy..not just like why talk about or bring up t10 if it's not until next year and who really going to fly it..I hate the 9 slow azz
If those new Thargoids aren't called 'Angels' then there is no justice in the universe.
i wish i could play this game, i realy like it, i have tryed it on a friends accont i love the sounds and the graphics...
4 dots on a screen don't equal a roadmap. Welcome to season 3, Elite: Dangerous Maintenance Mode
Please guys in 2018 we need be able to...walk everywhere! PLEASE!
If I hear narrative once more, Ill kill him.
Samarco looks like he is having some health problems..is he?
In game group organisations like guilds and a carrier FUCKING FINALLY, well i guess i will start playing ED again in 2019...unless SC comes out.
In other words, no need to come back to ED before Beyond update.
Too little, too late. Star Citizen's still in alpha and has more to offer in v3.0 than the glorified puddle of a game you've put together.
All I wanted was jump gates,  NPC wings, Holo-me crew, and also using that second SLF with an NPC crew...
Why is this video 360p only? isn't this the main youtube channel for ED\n?
I turned on\nmy post notifications I‚Äôm Lauren christie and I‚Äôm from dundee Scotland
WE DON'T SAY 'PUT A SHRIMP ON THE BBQ

Easy Jake Pauler: person that less like Jake Paul but accept people opinion. The most rarest species.\n\nNormal Jake Pauler: likes Jake Paul but doesn't accept opinion.\n\nHard Jake Pauler: Likes Jake Paul in a sexual way and want to kill the haters just because of a opinion\n\nEXTREME JAKE PAULER: The most common species. Can be founded in a kid-friendly channel, doesn't accept people opinion, wants to fuck Jake Paul and want to kill all the haters for no reason\n\nHARDCORE JAKE PAULER: Type everything in caps on, use shit ton of emoji and waste money for Jake Paul crap merchandise.\n\nAUTISM JAKE PAULER‚Äã: The extremely most common species, wants to lick Jake Paul tits and dick, use Shit ton of emoji, disrespecting parents and waste data just to watch Jake Paul\n\nAnd here are the list of Jake Paulers that you should be careful!
Thanks for making videos everyday you are awsome

When you play ASMR but the people around you are too loud
Having to choose between charging you phone and using headphones
I CAN RELATE SO HARD
I had never felt so identified with a video üòÇüòÇ‚ù§
OMG THIS IS SO ME
ASMR with AirPods = the best.  I have to search for them every morning, but totally worth it.
I just watched pj's useless facts video
When you fall asleep watching a 3 hr ASMR and don‚Äôt wake up on time bc your phone died mid video üò∞
The dislikes are from all earbuds
I find the way Brittney talks very relaxing. Brittney roleplay when? :D
This is me every night.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Mother fricker is going to be my new saying
that was so true.  i see ur past a mil subs :)  congrats.  always love watching u
Do more videos like these! These are funnyüëèüèªüòÇüòÇ
Totally truth! Those things happen every day \nLoving this video
M O T H E R F R I C K E R
Why is this all true? Like she got everything right
The stragglers are real ever night üò¥ waking up üòñ
I deal with all of these
I watch asmr without my headphones literally all the time. That‚Äôs the only way I watch it hahaha.
love your video jeje my first language is Spanish but I speak a little English and if everything you said is true haha ‚Äã‚Äãgreetings from argentina kisses
I have all of those problems
*D o Y o U b E l I E v E i N G e T t I n G t H e B e S t k I n D o F c A r I n S u R A n C E!!!!!?*
THE AD AT THE END ALWAYS HAPPENS TO ME AND I HATE IT
Friend: can I borrow your phone to watch a video?\nMe: quickly deletes phone history
Finding a comfortable position is always hard for me. Even when i sleep.
I don‚Äôt always get jump scared by ads when I fall asleep listening to ASMR. But when I do. I swear multiple times and throw my iPhone across the room
Anyone else feel like they laughed at this to much?
Every time when I wake up with my headphones around my neck I get a panic attack because I think about how I could have died.. so I watch asmr to calm down.
Ahaha I can relate to the one where the other girl wanted to use her phone. My YouTube history/subs are all ASMR üòÇ
THIS IS SO ACCURATE
The one that's so accurate to me is when I can't find a ASMR video to watch, either I can't find one I can't sleep to or there's tew many..(it's not In the video but It would of been a lot cooler if it was.)
harder for people w glasses
When an asmr creator and memes get combined you get this video. . . xD
This was so funny and so accurate üòÇ
the forgetting to charge my phone was me last night üíÄ
when the ads is in the middle of asmr video, THAT'S GIVE ME HEART ATTACK ! üòÇ
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE THE BEST CAR INSURANCE!!!!!!üòÇ
Its funny cause it's true
This is the video that explains me!
You should have included eating while watching asmr
earbuds fall out of my ears and I somehow end up sleeping on them. I usually just wake up in the morning and wonder what's poking at my back.
My entire life in one freaking video
I too have these struggles
Because I want to show you this LOL OMG WTF video on YouTube\nWhat the heck? üòÇ
I don't really watch asmr I listen to it :I
THIS IS SO ME
Such a funny video
omg,this is so true :))))
how has she got more subs than gentle???
DENIS LOVES YOU! So Applecake HATES YOU!        Plz go say hi to denis

Oh my god, me everytime!
WATCHING ASMR WITH OUT HEAD PHONES SUCKS
So relatable!
WASTED
Or when you set an alarm clock on your phone, because you have to get up early, but you don't plug your headphones out, because you fell asleep to an ASMR video and then in the mornig, the alarm goes off in your headphones and you obviously don't hear it. This happened to me so many times...
When your studying while you are watching asmr , you wake up the next day on your book, you have fall asleep and you haven't study for your exam
I never have headphones
MOTHER FRICKER
Kys :)
Shoutout to all the ladies getting a pedicure after this.
Am I the only one who's embarrassed of having a foot fetish? üòî
I want to suck your toes Kate
0:06 Man, that's a huge housefly! Someone's getting a reprimand!
‚ÄúYou know how I feel about feet!‚Äù ‚ÄúBunion‚Äù - Junior Soprano
that's Kate Winslet?   I was thinking, damn, Emma Thompson looks GOOD!
I keep forgetting that Kate is British, she's so good at doing an American accent.
Kate looks incredible in those fishnets. Wow...
I was smiling and giggling the whole time but the last two lines had me in splits
I to have a foot fetish ha
katie really needs some botox under the eyes
Well.. Idris Elba is younger than Chris Rock..
I love Idris. Can't wait for more Luther
Poor old Idris clearly nervous about  the sex scene and promoting this movie, Kate bailed him out with a story about a foot fetish
Stringer Bell does it again. \nIdris is the coolest.
Idris is a foot guy - YUP we're meant to be ;) LERVE Kate Winslet and Chris Rock!!
Am the only one around here who noticed the fly in Graham's wine?
The non-verbal communication between Idris and Kate is interesting... she grabs his hand and he does pull away...
I've just done films with a lot of guys.\nTHAT'S NO EXCUSE!\nOkie dokie, that's beautiful.
Love Kate and Idris. Not being nasty but Kate looks so tired eyes here, prob jet lagged! Wondering why she chose those tights too.... sorry Kate but you look silly in those tights. Idris is a dish üòçü§£
''Hi Guys I'm Karlie Kloss and I've just create-----A WEBSITE?? YES!! WE KNOW!! WE ALL KNOW!!! CONGRATULATONS!!!!  WOW!! GO YOU !! CREATING A WEBSITE?? WHATEVER NEXT!!
i really don't why there are fly's in the studio 0:08 graham's glass ...
I thought that was madonna
Has Winslet done surgeries on her face? I didn't recognize her to begin with!
I thought i was the only one with a foot fetish
I would never have guessed that Chris is older than Idris.
im so glad luther is returning for season 5
The guy literally directed a short for Sky which was centred around a woman and her love of shoes because he likes feet that much. The signs are all there haha
Idris I want your baby
If you don't know what Chris Rock meant by 'Hammertime' watch this and all will be revealed https://youtu.be/NP7_SIRfo-c
I think Kate Winslet is a bit of diva.
You can tell Idris can't stand Kate and to tell her to keep her socks on really shows the lack of chemistry considering he loves nice feet. From how bossy Kate is I can tell why he doesn't like her.
i dunno...still think Idris is faking that accent...
There's a fly in Graham Norton's wine glass at 0.07
Idris: I've done a lot of films where there are a lot of guys.\nChris Rock: That's no excuse.  \n\nSmart and funny - LOL!
Idris is my boy and Kate looks great. Chris is the one true rock.
there¬¥s a fly on Graham¬¥s glass
Anyone else notice the fly on Graham‚Äôs glass?
Can you imagine Chris Rock is 7 years older than Idris Elba
Chris Rock is looking good.
*Movie guy voice* Chris Rock, Idris Elba in: Brokeblack Mountain.
Bet he dose you know how them black men get around white women
Ok I already liked Elba as an actor, but I just noticed his hand tattoo I totally didn't know he had, just hours after I got my hand tattoo aaand he just admitted havin a foot fetish, which I also have, on national tv looking cool as hell, Elba just turned into one of my fav celebrities lol
I love Kate's hair!!!!
Did anyone else search Kate Winslet feet before the video even finished playing?
He's going to get so many feet pics slid into his dm
I can not say  it often enough - I LOVE  Idris
These 3 had brilliant chemistry together
109 thumbs down. Why? No, wait, I don't know why. You can keep it to your self.
Guys, he's only human
Idris is black so that makes him cool... White people in these comment are so funny!
Kate looks beautiful and she never really ages! amazing! Also, who else noticed she had Invisalign?
Stacker pentacost has a print of every kaiju's feet in his office and now we know why
This is trending but Liam Gallagher isn't?
Chris looks like a little boy lol
Omg I just watched Ryan does something every week his videos are hilarious check him out and share
This man is perfection
Theres a FLY on the wine glass at the start of the clip!!!! Did Graham drink from this glass later on?!?!?!
'I can't wait to see this movie' LOL
In the comment section: foot folk.
just watched their movie , I am yet to recover from that love scene where Ben(Idris) sweeps Alex(Kate) off her feet to bring her to bed, so perfectly savage
Now I'm picturing Idris doing things to my feet.....
0:06 There is a giant fly getting drunk off of Graham Norton's drink just over his left shoulder.
Idris please be my second husband!!üòÇ
I love how idris took his hand back reallll quick üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Why is Chris Rock naked?
0:34 same Chris. Same.

BLACKED
Idris and Chris can broke black mountain!!! :)
I respect Idris Alba even more now..\nUs feet lovers have to stick together lol
Having a foot fetish is no longer creepy now a famous rich black man likes feet
well. if idris has a foot fetish, i guess now i have a foot fetish
I bet he has another foot in his trousers.
Was i the only one grossed out? xD
Guest: I like to keep myself clean, head to toe, you know.\nGraham Nortons YT channel: GUEST HAS A FOOT FETISH
Ewww nasty
Foot fetish is gross
I hate feet
I hate Idris Elba ever since he came on the office. He's not even a popular actor and has failed in all his mainstream movies.
Foot fetishes are disgusting. FEET ARE DISGUSTING!
Always thought there was something wrong with that coon
Why hasn't Idris done many love scenes?\n\nPerhaps because he's black and and the only people who want to watch negro and white woman get intimate are degenerate SJWs and Jews.
So sick!
how is this trending it only has 14k views, youtube is rigged
Hey man! I'm a small filmmaker that really wanna share my content. I would really appreciate, if you guys could give me a chance, and check my channel out. I hate promoting, but I stand 100% by my content, and spend a lot of time on it. I hope some of you would give me a chance :-)
this was just top shelf stuff. that hero 6 in the gimbal was rock solid and looked great
I daydreamed through this whole video.  What'd I miss?
0:39 think gopros cheating us a little on the capabilities of its slow mo look at the front wheel looks like they are using a time warp style plugin in post to generate that slowmo. Either that or YouTube's player is getting shitter and shitter by the day.
The motion capture scene 1:20 of this video seems to have been corrected. \nI have a Sony Mirrorless camera. But it does not get the same neat motion capture effect as this video.\n I think he used masking editing.  So I put this on my channel.\n I hope you can watch and review.
heck yes!! some sick shots with the go pros
I have two GoPro hero 5....been trying to get a microphone for it...for interning someone for my channel...what would you recommend for me to get?

https://youtu.be/Wa5IT8oHfZM\n\n\nHey guys I'm 16 and I've recently made a video about life's philosophy with a very low budget equipment and I would really appreciate if you can check it out.thanks
Man, those big airs 1:22 are mesmerizing. Can seriously watch those over and over.
Does'nt his rap music make him enough money?! üòÖ artist name patchy
weird morphing frame to frame in first jump...which gopro was used? Not Hero4K obviously, or why is there no 4k playback?
I hate how you guys removed slow motion editing from your software. I have to buy from somewhere now. Ughhh why did I get the hero 6
i have good videos i just need a shoutout https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mqz-h2EgIXcCMs1y0c7Sg
Hey, guys! I have a new travel video I hope you guys would check it out. Thank you https://youtu.be/Ve7_P38jbDc
I have a hero5 but i don't know how to do the thing at 1:19
some blockiness in some parts, pretty good for such a tiny camera though
Go pro hero 6 is just godlike no other way of explaining it
SIGN UP --> ENTER CODES --> GET PAYED!!\nI made $150 just last night XD\nTrying to get referrals! Help me help you! Thank You!\nhttp://pepiredrsa.win/3522403659458/
Makes me wish we had a decent mx vs atv game
all cool but the avverrage gopro user doesnt have a drone for all thkse sick shots. You should do a tutorial on how to make the best video with your gopro by yourself
Wahhhhh is it made by the hero 6 or fusion it so bieutiful üòçüòçüòçüòç
Any small time youtubers care to support each other? Comment if interested
Hello from Reunion Island. Nice video
someone make video better to go pro ? I dont think
Meeehhh.. \n\n\nHold my beer. \n\n\n\n\nI can't do that!
compared to release videos of hero 5 and 6 quality of this one is very bad. Oversharpened and full of moire and false detail. Did they not use protune ? why is it ? quality looks imo as hero 3 or hero3+ at max. @gopro #gopro please explain.
Nate has so many backflips under his belt he‚Äôs got it mastered!
For the idiots who think that the slo-mo clip at 0:39 is native to the camera, you guys are wrong. You can obviously see that Twixtor (or another similar effect) has been used
The new Trials game looks pretty good.
Best part was the slow motion in the air
Are GoPros image really that clean?
my pipis
hero 5 or hero 6?
Espectacular como todos !!!
Super video üëåüôÑ

If you dont mind me asking,  what was that pole like device that he had attached to his Gopro,  have never seen that before,
these videos are so inspiring, please go check my new youtube channel
GoPro cameras are garbage. I bought a hero and the not replaceable battery died in 3 months. Not a scratch on it. Total ripoff! \nAvoid buying any GoPro!
I Love Your Channel

fckin idiot I can't stand him
Cr1t1kal brought me to this retard.
Faggot called a cop who actually did something for the people a retard fuck him
I bet he is already talking shit with Joe Rogan . Pathetic bitches
Is he mental did he ask a police officer if he needs help
He was lucky the police officer didn‚Äôt shoot him
When you're a narcissistic wanker, well... You're just a narcissistic wanker. üòï
I WANTED TO SEE THE FUCKING DUDE SHOOTING, I WANTED A MAN STANDING THERE WITH A GUN GONG GAT GTA GRAAW SKRRT ALL THAT SHIT BUT NO ALL I GET IN THEM STAIRING AT SOME DUDE WITH A COWBOY HAT ü§† LIKE BRUH
I don't know who the fuck u are haha
Help get me to 1k no vids üî•
What was he holding?
FUCKING BS IS WHAT THIS IS!
Dan 'i ran toward the Vegas shooter' Bilzerian
Dude, don‚Äôt you know? This is all about me! WHAT A MASSIVE DOUCHE
dan i have all the guns and hoes but not when i need them
Stupid fevking idiot thinks he's a hero .. Look at me Iam getting there
To bad this waste of skin never got shot
I could've been the 4,500th thumb up...instead I chose to be the 19,260th thumb down.
If they have turned on the lights on the hotel rooms maybe that would have cause poor 7 vision
hahahhahahhahahhahhahahhahhahahhahahhahahhahhahahhahhahhahahhahhahahhahaha. I love idiots!! Even during an event as horrible as this they still give me a good laugh. I don't even know you hahahhahahhahahahha
hey Dan if you see this fuck you you pantywaist dumbass piece of shit. A child would know to go provide first aid instead of trying to bum a weapon off of an officer. you should be arrested for interfering with police business clownass
The like to dislike ration reminds me of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare
it's a shame this useless piece of crap did not get shot that day. what a fucking shit-stain self-absorbed trust fund baby publicity whore. fuck you for the cunt you are
That's not running tword the shooter, that's cover and concealment.
This.... This here in 55 seconds is everything wrong with American gun culture. A nutjob with an arsenal many African warlords would be envious of, and a narcissistic nutjob who thinks the best way to combat it is with more guns and to just go in blazing.
If only the gunman aimed closer to him
O    M   G !!! Thank God Dan was there ..  a lot of people has been saved all because this super heroe was at the good place in the perfect time!! Thank God he had a camera too!
He's a cunt
he's an attention whore. c'mon there's a guy filming him. he thought this will be a great way to get attention
Wanna be.. That's all he is. Coward who runs away instead of helping others.
I have no issue with Dan Bilzerian, but why the fuck would he put this video out? He gets a strip torn off him by a cop and only looks like an asshole here.
This idiot is lucky he was not charged for interfering with police duties. He was probably drunk or high and should be ashamed.
well he stayed well away from the field of fire and never got to close. who did he put up to filming him? that cop sure put him in his place, lol.
Everyone wants to be a hero these days
If I could to dislike this video again, I'd do that right now!
Oh sure a white guy asks cop for gun. He only gets yelled at but if a black man asks cop for gun...
We can all agree that the shooter was a funkien dumb cunt
What an idiot... sweet creds bruh
Coyote Peterson
Fucking idiot
Faker than Pam Anderson's tits
BRO I GOT SUCH A GOOD VIDEO IDEA!! Get a shot of me running toward the building acting like we're gonna be the hero's that end this, it'll go so viral
Officer - you know better.\nWhelps!! I dont think Dan does tbh.
So ppl complain when he ranned. And complain when he wanted too kill the fucker... keyboard warriors at the finest.
Fucking dumbass is telling a real cop to give up his gun?  Since Dan is some big star?  Moron...
Cop handled it like a boss
As far as I'm concerned the cop who REFUSED to give the douche bag a gun is the HERO!!!!!!  The only method this dude Dan has is trying to get himself noticed even while in the midst of tragedy .... still trying to promote himself.  All you virgins find yourself another hero.
He went through seal training twice
if you come under fire you get to cover not to go straight towards the shooter with empty hands don't you know that as a Seal?
In all honesty what the fuck is he going do?
What a ball bag
It doesn't matter how much money you got, a douchebag is still a fucking douchebag lol
This guy is a good example of a dumbfuck
This guy seems more like a Brad or some douche bag kind of name like that, you know
Honestly this guy is so stupid. Running at gun fire. Bruh
Why is this guy having to go running for a gun, and not have one on him? Especially at an outdoor venue, surrounded by potential drunk people and an increased chance of getting into an alternation with another person.. in a state that has little to no legislation against open carry? Gun lobbyists like to use defence and protection as excuses to allow themselves to own, store and use small arsenals, at their home.. but when in a situation with the potential for actual bodily harm, with no law saying you can't.. they suddenly forget to pick one up?\n\nThis is one of two things; negligence or stupidity.
Our policy is not to run ads on videos about tragedies
He is just getting in the way and annoying people.. look at my creds pretentious prick
He did nothing, he can live doing and spending money however he wants, but in the end he, just like the rest of us is nothing and will return to nothing. Don't let the antics of individual retards like this guy get to you.
This guy is the new chuck Norris
That room full of guns did him fuck all didn't it?
Get the fuck away from me..... I don't care, I don't know who you are....... I don't know who the fuck you are. My thought too.
YouTube thinks they're funny putting this vid first on trending
Ha what a tool
How do good youtubers get there good videos taken down by youtube, but! this shit stays up.
Did you want an applause, Bilzerian? Cos you are getting none from me.
What's wrong with him tryna help tho?
the hero we need, not the one we deserve
This guy is a Chad, Chud, & Choad all wrapped up into a ballbag burrito! Gargle on a big toe you waste of oxygen.
This where you come to see a set of tiny steroid afflicted testicles pretending to be a big man? What a fucking waste of oxygen.
Brave but dickens stupid tho calm down it‚Äôs one way to get on the trending page lol
What a douche tool. I wish the cop would have pistol whipped the wanker.
And what exactly was his plan, give me a gun I'm sure I can aim for the guy high up in the hotel? Fucking dumbass, I laughed when the police screamed at him and said I don't give a fuck who you are üòÇ
Whys does money make someone so fckn self righteous. I bet this guy thinks his shit doesn‚Äôt stink.
The ting goes skrrrr
Aye fuk this guy aye
What an absolute fucking hero.
achieved zero
lmao
Fkn pathetic cunt
my favorite dc hero
Publicity stunt piece of shit
Haters gonna hate.

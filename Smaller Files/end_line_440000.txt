That was fun!
I love her.

DRINK THE JUICE SHELBY!!
yeah actually pretty good video!!
Luvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv!!!!
I love Julia Roberts, such an excellent actress
love this, well doen! love Julia
Her mouth is Yuuuuuuuge
I’ve heard of like two of these films. Julia Roberts is trash holy shit
La mujer más hermosa en todos los sentidos!
Así me doy cuenta que he visto todas sus películas 😍
His kid is gonna be well educated. Russel is a smart man. 👍🏼
'How dare you insult our culture' 🤣🤣😂😂
Get them to the Greek all over again love it
I love the way he talks about Katy Perry :)
I've always found him unattractive, sleazy and seems to  like the sound of his own voice.
I love how he throws Wendy off and takes full control of the interview.\nMade me laugh when he answered the 100degree question though.
I say pick up messiah now, ask her if you want to be free now ...
man really drilling him on the ex wife shyt.... TF .... O.o
I thought i never said this, but he actually is funny!
Love this love him. He had a little 😢 in my eye. Cool dude man. Yes he handsome his personality wins!!!
It's great to see Russell Brand again on talk shows
Awww this actually made me like him . I use to think he was such a nuisance 😩
I have a great story about this guy but I don't want to dox my friend. I'm just tell you that in real life he's a genuinely nice man. He treats everyone the same no matter who they are 💯 Respect!
This dude has good humor ! I enjoyed this interview !
I’ve always enjoyed when he talks about politics..anarchism, his anti-pornography stance etc. Really disappointing to see the guy he really is: a huge douche womanizer. He should not take lightly his abuses of power over women. His exploitation is not funny or cute it is repellent.
He went to the Ricky Hatton vs Mayweather fight? He's right, Ricky Hatton was badly beaten in that one.
A lot of people dont know that at one time Russel was a sex addict.
Russell Brand is 100% the kind of person to molest his children. He's fucked up in pretty much every way. It's quicker to list the things that aren't wrong with him. He seems like he somewhat has his basic body functions still working and he has a decent amount of motor control. He can speak but not well though he does have a larger than average effective vocabulary. That's all I can think of that isn't completely fucked up about him. That guy's brain is burnt as hell. He's completely lost the ability to perceive reality and due to his political leanings, he's such a complete pervert.
Russel brand is a humble intelligent man
I think he isn't as sober as he would like us to think
I didn't like Russell brand, at first, but now,I do. He has integrity. He is legally entitled to  20 million dollars of Katy Perry's money. He refuses to take even so much as a penny. He has openly said he can make his own money and doesn't want hers. That's a real man.
Love his quick wit, his honest and intelligence. It clearly threw Wendy off because she wanted control and wanted to dig but he owned this interview and showed us what he wanted to know about him. I like it!
He really is attractive!  Tall, dark, handsome, extremely well spoken, hilarious intelligent and trying to make a difference somehow... makes me jealous of the ivanka  donald and melania.
OMG....best show ever!  He is hilarious :-)
I fucking love this guy!...... what a legend!
Thanks Russell tell the sheep
I had no idea he was married with a kid wtf lol
Woah he was like a ray of sunshine 🌞
He is so amusing!!
This was so much fun!! 😂🤣
There is NO WAY that man is sober... And IF he is, I'd hate to see him high. Dear God! I felt like I had just smoked crack, watching him.
He’s actually so intellectual
I loved this interview. Couldn't get enough of it
love russell, love his youtube channel. it's great to see someone working to improve themselves everyday. very interesting guy who breaks down a lot of complicated topics for us regular folk, lol
I love how he answered the question Katy Perry question. He's hella odd but I respect him
Hands Down the best Interview that Wendy has had in a long time; sometimes, the interviews with can be uncomfortable for the guests. lol
This is not his core audience.
I LOVE Russell. He's hilarious. Because of him when he actually got a thumbs up for this video. Wendy went fishing for dirt and came back with nothing.
Lol he is so funny! He totally throws her off with the gossip talk. It is great! I’m way down for his book.
Wendy has no sense of humour
I love him he is crazy
I love love love Russell Brand! Everyone needs to check out  The Trews with Russell Brand on youtube
he sounds like Jack Sparrow
I love Russell... Watch Russell´s youtube channel !!
He should host the awards shows....he's either very charismatic or high as kite
So far one of my favorite Wendy guest,  he really is just great!
He was so out of it 😂😂
I swear comments are filled with people saying how they'd have sex with him and it's so fucking gross. 🤒🤒 Literally gagging at these comments. I kan knottt *in my Joseline Hernandez voice* Y'all gotta chill. #ThrowUp
He is not right amount of weird... he is a lot!!!!
You can't help but like him. He's so funny and endearing.
This man is amazing. So brilliant and entertaining!
I believe he has slept with Donald Trump goofy a**
He's a clown
I thought he was dead. Must need drug money . Trying to revive a dead career
A refreshing interview to see  -- a guest who knows how to take control over the direction without being awkward and can still have fun, and Wendy seemed to be in better spirits with the interview.
Wendy was exhausted after this interview 😂
Love this guy!!! I see why he had sex with a 1000 women...he's super HOT!!!
Can never decide  if he's pure brilliance or sociopathic
He's seems very intelligent and can express himself very well. When he spoke, it kinda felt like poetry in a way lmaoo. BUT IK CORNY AF
I love Russell
I love Russell!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
a thousand people ?
He's God
#WokeAF
yo he said crackheads and smackheads LOL
Russell smart Af....an awakened soul
This was Overwhelming!😂😂😂
I love him ❤️
0:46 that screaming yo 😂😂😂
He is outrageously funny n clever
Love this guy
That guy.
*Unique gifts*\n*New Year gifts*\n*https://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira*
Simply. Hilarious
The trumps 😂😂😂😂
WWF actor
Miss Amy so much...
very sneaky and smart
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove him!
Stroke the furry walls!!!
I love Russel
The way he says 'Sean puff daddy coombs' 😂
Wendy William ‘s show is not my fave
Funny and profound at once.
I love that he was like I know we playing this TV game but I got real stuff going on. ..ask me about my mind bruv.
He’s so awkward
He's so charming!! 😍
Imagine what it must have been to be his parents
Is Wendy Williams a demon? She looks like one.. look at her face
This was much funnier when I watched it 2nd time.
I love him so much 😍 lol
he's a mess
I don't think this crowd understood Russel's humour.
He's So funny! :-)
Great aura! Love this interview! Lol!
i didn't want to watch this interview because something in me said that i don't like him but I asked myself why? why? and I couldn't come up with a reason ...years and years of avoiding his interviews not knowing what he's like,  but I'm so glad i watched this, he's funny,  extremely bright  and i love how he puts his words together, you can tell he's well read...
Get 2.5 more hours of his fascinating ideas in his recent chat on the Joe Rogan Experience.
I ❤️ Russell Brand ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lol I love him
Who do you think did better?!
I literally can't wait to see the Jaclyn Hill annoying Nikki Tutorials for 1 minute straight
I really want to know Nikkie's trick on hiding her double chin! 😂 \nShe puts on makeup and that goes away for real! 😂
Omg I love both of you so much!!!! So grateful for the video
who's that man standing in the background with the tourist shirt!? haha
Nikkie theres no need to look like a ghost omg her foundation is just too white
That was honestly funny as fuck!!
Does anyone know where Nikki’s shirts from?
You two did great! I literally lol’d!!!😂😂😂😭😭😭
Jaclyns makeup in 10 minutes is what my makeup looks like after 45
Hahaha I’m over here dying like HURRY UP BI**H PUT ON YOR LASHES OR MASCARA!!! 🤣 and it’s about time you guys did a collab👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
tbh i don't think it was entirely fair and people shouldn't judge nikki because jaclyn already has very nice eyebrows that she barely needs to put in any effort to fill in, while nikki obviously has a disadvantage and filling in her eyebrows will take away a lot of time. each person has their own makeup needs and if you're judging their makeup skills by this ten min challenge, stfuuuuu
I totally loved that Nikki threw on sunglasses to mask her eyes  <3
Where is your necklace from ?!
I love you both!!! Having you both on one video... Fuuuuccckkk yes
Where are those sunglasses from?!? 😍
best video ever xoxoxox oh Jaclyn I love your expression after you  applied highlight on your cheek hahahaha
Well\nJaclyn skipped about 10 steps. Orange foundation looks bad
This is the best collab you two have ever done together. You had me dying laughing the whole time and Jaclyn was throwing shit and Nikki was just cracking up. For just 10 mins the makeup could've been a lot worse. Love you both!!
Does anybody know what necklace Jaclyn is wearing?
Thank you for the 10-min smile!!😂😂
I LOVED seeing your competitive side come out Jaclyn, you killed it! 💋💋💋
Jac won, imo! 💁 I'd rather have lashes/mascara than eyeshadow & no lashes/mascara! 🤔 But you're both amazing & beautiful. 😍
Nikkie’s laugh is so contagious. Like after she saw Jaclyn’s highlight?? Omgee 😂😂😂
I laughed my ass off when it cut to nik with those glasses, I clapped like a damn seal !
*actual footage of me getting ready for work every morning*
this video was my favorite do more of these with guests😤😂❤️
Their 10 min challenge will always look better than the 1 hour it takes me
Should have just used a timer for 10 minutes. Lol like an alarm
this was the funniest video 😂 Jaclyn is me under pressure 😂😂😂
i thought she was like 27. i view her a bit differently knowing shes so much younger then i am lol
I don’t normally enjoy Nikki but in this I really enjoyed her 💖
Y'all are so cute. Jac rocked it
Lmfao this is the greatest thing ever 😂👌🏼 love you both 😍 I love how you slid that Clueless quote in there Jaclyn! Hahaa I've used that so many times lol
omg she said my name omg freak level over 900
Nikkie with her glasses needs to be a meme
The could've just restarted the timer and done 6 more minutes but they waited until 4 minutes and started again 😂
Hey guys head over to my channel https://youtu.be/e6g1u1z1u5E for my new Vlog 💕❤️🙏
Seriously...LIP COLOR?????? GORGEOUS!!!! I NEED THAT COLOR!\nAnyone know??? I thought maybe it was Anastasia's Tulip color like she's worn in her previous video, but i'm not for sure...
I liked your look better Jaclyn. I loved watching you freak out and throw brushes everywhere lol
whats the makeup spray they used? the black bottle
I loved this video! I wanna hang with Jaclyn and Nikkie! looked like a lot of fun.
They are like manny and jefree😍
Why didn't Jaclyn use the timer instead of stopwatch?? GIIIIRRRRRLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!
Is she still uploading the video she did with Kathleenlights?
Jacklyn hill, your makeup is on point!!!
I died watching this!!!! I’m so tired after a 9 hour shift, but this video made me laugh so hard! 😂😂😂
why didn't Jaclyn just use a timer instead of a stopwatch and waiting for 4 minutes
you guys are both so beautiful 😭
❤️👍🏻👍🏻 I laughed so hard during this video..I actually cried 🤣
best collaboration in the whole youtube history
Best collab ever!! I love y'all! 💜
Omg you guys are so much fun!!!!!! You have to do this again 💕🙌🏻
Loved how this video was edited you guys are so funny 😂😂
What did you use on your lips, Jaclyn? Loved it!
I know you’ve worn that lippie before in another video but I can’t remember what it is!! Is it Carina from ABH??
Why did you wait for 4 mins.? U could have just restarted the time and ended at 6...
I love you both!!!
Omg Jaclyn your face when you talked about pooping 4 times!! Literally dead here in North Dakota 😂😂😂😂
Bahaha I just about died!!!😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you both!!
Jaclyn’s lipstick, with her skin tone and the color of the shirt are all so stunning put together 😍
I've been following Jaclyn for over 5 years now and I've asked countless questions and for advice on lots of make up related things on here and Instagram and even more recently through Snapchat and she has not responded to me once!! I'm obviously still a huge fan but it's just so disappointing that she claims to be so appreciative and active with her subscribers when I feel like that's just not true. Not trying to bash her just wondering if anybody else has been completely ignored???
What was that lip color you used? I love that!!
if you smack your weenie around hard enough somethin weird happens
Does anyone know what lip nikkie was wearing?
Anyone know what lip colour Jaclyn uses???
Finally fiiiiiiinally!!!  💜 you two are just.. amaaaaazing. 👑👑👑

That highlightterrrr❣❣❣❣❣❣❣

This isnt Julien. Why he looks so different.
I absolutely love you guys, no one on YouTube makes me laugh the way you guys do. 💕

LIL SEBASTIAN 😭😭😭😭
So much propaganda in one video.
#1 Rule of being a prepper, don't let anyone know you're a prepper.
nothing funnier than two flaming homos criticizing 95% of the rest of us REAL Americans.  \n\nDefine far right extremist?
Stop saying super rich as if it’s a bad thing these people worked their asses off to make the money that they did and your trying to make them feel guilty about having the money they worked for
Fuck these two guys, they’re assholes who hate people with money
I live in New Zealand 😆😆😆
That white guy is an embarrassment to men everywhere.
The rest of us crumble.\n\nNo, just you.
Uh, I hate to be the one to awkwardly point this out, but your political bias is showing.
After the revolution comrades shall go to New Zealand to rid the world of what is left of the capitalist class.
Rapture my friends 💕 Our Lord is coming soon! God bless you all! 😄
You don't have to suffer the great wrath of God. Put your trust in Jesus and salvation is promised. I overdosed in 2013 and was brought into the glorious presence of God. Jesus Christ is the truth! God is Love and Light. I made a testimony video if anyone wants to watch. God bless you all in the name of the Lord, Jesus.
except that there are waaaaaaaay more poor people who prep for disasters than wealthy
3:48 but.... I can't whistleblow..... guess I'm just gonna die then
With Trump, natural disasters, North Korea... Jesus Christ, I don't even like the guy but the number of people finding every excuse to put him on the same list as a fucking hurricane is pathetic.
Haha Trump bad! Right guys? Please give me likes and views because of my left wing opinions!
This type of prepping, with stockpiling and stuff will only last a certain amount of time. However, developing skills will keep you going indefinitely.
this is a trash vid
Just need a Vault.
This bunker company, is really getting me a vault tech vibe, like the bunker is going to do experiments...
Atlease now I know were suzan collins got her idea for district 13 from.
Watch a video on my channel CJ Collins
This is what we can do to survive Armageddon.\nhttps://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/watchtower-no6-2017-november/survive-armageddon/\nI guess it's getting closer as more of us are getting aware of this :o
Money is the least interesting form of wealth.
The music is a bit loud / distracting
lol you can't escape A.I. no matter how rich (obv different story if you're the one somehow in control), the main reason for the fear is because of growing income inequality and the resulting frustration. The government favors corporations and rich individuals while neglecting the rest, making it an inevitability that some kind of uprising or political revolution will eventually occur unless something fundamentally changes. Unchecked greed . . . what a sad way for a great civilization to come to an end.
If it starts to look _that bad_ I'll just kms, fewer people will help all those formerly wealthy people live, since wealth won't matter once they get to their islands as money will be obsolete.
background music is too loud and annoying!
I agree that preparing brings control into peoples lives
Vault tec must be busy right now
Does anyone know why Americans use the word oftentimes? It seems a strange case of a word that sounds antiquated in Britain but is widely used in the US.
The\nRich are the ones keeping us under control if they are preparing for this is because they know something we don't
I am not prepared at all! I'll probably just kill myself before the radiation melts me. Maybe mercy kill my cat before.
All these ideas are cool yet so crazy!
if I were rich I would give my money way to all of you liberal cry babies so you can stop crying about he's not my president or I need other people to do this for me and I need more rights because this or that happened to people I don't even know hundreds of years ago so SHUT THE F UP
obumer is the one who well help bring do America. obumer is not only a LYING TRAITOR PIG, but he's also a minion of the Antichrist. Lol, which is probably why he's a LYING TRAITOR. EVIL PIG!!!
Why is Trump a reason for people to prepare for societal breakdown? I think liberals fucking everything up is good enough for me...
Re: the reddit guys eye surgery--as someone with such bad eyesight that I would be disabled w/o prescription eye wear,  it totally makes sense to think about being able to see during a disaster. I've definitely thought of it, and I'm just a regular person. I'd be dead super fast if my glasses broke or couldn't be replaced in a disaster. Surving as a blind person is probably next to impossible in the wild. Just playing devil's advocate on that one...
IMHO these guys are overly flamboyant, a real turn off.
This video is very anti trump
LMAO fantastic garbage video from guys who oddly made a survival topic video have weird political undertones. This was incredibly hard to watch. Maybe you guys so stick to topics you actually know about lol.
Who’s the bottom?
Y is everyone talking about apocalypse nowadays??
I don't know why, but I don't like these guys, they are bashing on these people for their money, like what the heck! Some way or another they earned it
Oh you are preparing for the apocalypse and you are not rich, RIGHT WING EXTREMIST SPOTTED! \n\nR u fucking retarded? Like actually this is a medical question.
0:55\nIs that picture supposed to be Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us?
God, this is super cringe
NZ here: STOP BUYING ALL OUR PROPERTY PLEASE
Blaming trump smh 
What's with all the apocalypse stuff on trending ;-; it's scaring me.
Super poor person in Silicon Valley, we out here too
Its suspossed to be on october 12th but a scientist said that its fake.
What can I do?  \n\nAccording to the experts you should:\n1. Garden with sustainable agriculture techniques (less pesticides and fertilizer (organic or better yet permaculture)).\n2. Buy food and manufactured goods made locally\n3. Pay down debt\n4. Learn skills they will be useful in the future and make friends that have useful skills you don't have (related to providing food, water, shelter, and medical care.  A necessary skill is organic/permaculture gardening/farming).  Very important: medical skills are the best way to ensure your survival.   All others will gladly sacrifice their life to protect your life, so you are around to use your medical knowledge to keep their  families alive.\n5. I recommend to invest some money into technologies to increase the carrying capacity of the planet (high risk investments);\nA. decrease environmental impact per capital \nB. alternatives for our food system input to improve production\nC. alternatives to our current living arrangements, \nD. alternatives to our plastics industry, \nE. alternatives to disaster capitalism\nF. Savior technologies, ie faster-than-light travel, game changer technologies, ie Cold fusion energy & delaying technologies, ie deep drilling technologies.\n6. I also recommend you inform and prepare your family, friends, and others.  It is best to initially suggest people have an emergency kit... for any emergency such as flood, earthquake, tornado, hurricane, loss of electricity due to a winter storm.  Then, if the friend or relative puts together a disaster kit, what I do is introduce Peak Oil (by telling them of the 43 second movie trailer http://m.natgeotv.com/ca/2210-thecollapse/videos/collapse-of-earth  , the National Geographic Collapse movie on YouTube, & free book downloads;\n7. For the truly motivated, a community based organization to mitigate Climate Change and Peak Oil is: http://www.transitionus.org/\n(For non USA; https://transitionnetwork.org/)\n\nGoogle 2052 free book summary download, &\n\nThe free book Plan C workbook download; http://www.communitysolution.org/newsolutionsreports/new-solutions-11-plan-c-curtailment-and-community?rq=plan%20c\n\nSee the Facebook page: National Geographic Collapse movie
The guys in this video would be totally fucked in the event of an apocalypse, no matter how much money they had
Oh yeah! Let me hold this fish and check its fucking power level on my scouter... Oh shit this one is a Super Sayian Blue one shit...
Quite the condescending attitude you got there, and with almost a million $ubs it's not like your living hand to mouth yourself.  The New World Order is real, the propaganda is real, prep people, prep for the worst and hope for the best. Anyone trying to make preparing sound crazy does not have your interests in mind.
There A bunch of selfish assholes!
New Zealand is an island... surrounded by woater..big woater..ocean woater...yea all these rich fucks are only gonna help themselves and maybe other rich fucks
America needs a civil war
Wait are they saying rich people who prepare are selfish?Like how is that selfish.
But if the world was ending the rich wouldn't really matter anymore
seed bank and a bunch of books and bunch of tools
yes because rich people knows what the fucks going on and the peasants no
Poor people are more likely to survive, if the currency system falls they are doomed, you can't eat money hahahah
Fuck all that shit. I'm going out with a bang let's parttayyy
My own point of view is that I would not want to go to all that trouble and expense in the hope of living on, in an artificial bubble surrounded by worldwide devastation. Couldn't travel. Stuck with the same people. Boring in every way I can think of. That's not living to me. I'd rather enjoy life now, without all that angst and stockpiling and obsession and expense, and if the world as we know it is destroyed, frankly I wouldn't mind going with it (given the boring alternative). My love of living is greater than my love of life itself, if you get my point.
Lol \nAll the comments are salty.
There would absolutely be no way of surviving the apocalypse(doomsday) everything will collapse, the whole universe will be destroyed.\nSo if you think that there is any chance any of us would survive you’re dead wrong.
All i can do while watching this is think about the 100....
Good luck rebuilding society when all of us poor people are dead.
I was in Amalfi Coast 2 days ago haha
Not gonna lie, this video sounds like you guys whining about rich people than actually outlandish prepping. Your statement of them worrying about themselves while the rest of  us crumble makes you sound like you can't handle your own life, like you're children in constant need of watching. Learn how to be self reliant rather than just trying to blame everything on society.
New Zealand is not a good place to go during the Apocalypse. They have frequent 6.0 earth quakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. New Zealand is literally on a fault line.
You should do a video on Warren Buffet, his house and safety room is pretty amazing.
wow. someone thinks they are holier then thou.. Maybe they are prepping because they are smart and not guilty.
We're gonna get purged.

The point is that certain accessories for guns need to be banned. The gun system needs to be re-evaluated. That way, you can keep your 2nd Amendment right while people can't get a gun to cause a massacre like this one again.
What’s even worse than a gun or physical damage... mentally damaged and caused by humans around the person.
I don’t understand why it’s so hard to grasp the fact most of these shootings happened from an illegal firearm. so why aren’t we cracking down on gun trafficking?
Problem is mental illness not guns
You can bump a gun without a bump stock \nThe stock just makes the rate of fire more consistent but certainly not any faster
So much bad info here.. fully autos weren't made illegal in 1986.. they were heavily regulated and taxed and it became illegal for one to own a full auto made after 1986.. that's just scratching the surface of the bad info provided in this video
You should also mention that the bump stock is unregulatable. I mean you can ban the part but people will just machine their own.  It would be like banning ice. Even if I can't buy the premade stuff, I can still make my own at home pretty easy. I don't own a gun and am not particularly invested in the second amendment but I don't want Congress to waist time on worthless feel good legislation that will have zero impact when there are laws that can be passed that will make a real diffrence. \n\nFor starters can we get off the background check band wagon. Every mass shooter in the past two decades would have passed a background check easily. Such a law would have zero impact on mass shootings. You know what we should do instead? Psychology evaluations. That is something nearly all mass shooters would fail and they'd have a hell of a time getting a gun as a result.
*They should make murder illegal*
Then how come the good guys with guns didnt stop the bad guy with a gun?
There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of Wednesday, June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.000000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\n\n• 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws\n• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified\n• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – gun violence\n• 3% are accidental discharge deaths\n\nSo technically, gun violence is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation?\n• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago\n• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore\n• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit\n• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)\n\nSo basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\n\nThis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.\n\nNow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\n\nAre 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. That's why they are criminals.\n\nBut what about other deaths each year?\n• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!\n• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths\n• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide) \n\nNow it gets good:\n• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!\n\n• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If Obama and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides......Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!\n\nSo you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It's pretty simple.:\nTaking away guns gives control to governments.\n\nThe founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\n\nThus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs. \n\nSo the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force at the command of Congress can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.\n\nRemember, when it comes to gun control, the important word is “control, not “gun.
??? So many incorrect statements in this video. Fully auto guns are still legal in certain states including Nevada, just ones produced after 1986 aren't sold to the public.
You know what, gun laws in a statistical sense have been almost completely ineffective at reducing gun related crimes. Especially in Chicago which has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation yet also the highest crime rate.
Gun control laws will never work
Holy hell, you could have called one FFL dealer and he would have given you any information you wanted.
So you are blaming the bump fire stock then the person. The bump fire stock has been around for years one idiot does something stupid with it you want to  get rid of them makes no sense. So who do you blame when a drunk driver kills a person do you blame the vehicle or the person. Because if you blame the vehicle let's ban that particular vehicle that the drunk driver was driving. If you want to ban something how about ban cigarettes they kill more people in this country then so-called gun violence but you don't want to hear that do you.
So this is trending but Steven Crowder's Expose Antifa video isn't? Ok....
nice, thank you for informing me on how to increase my kill count.
its sad that we spilled blood on are American soil America is about peace are president talks but never does anything if we expect a brighter future let's like at each other light a candle insane as one
Thank you for the video!
automatic weapons are not illegal...theyre just so expensive its almost impossible for most people to buy because theyre atLEAST $10grand. there is, however, a manifacturing ban. no automatics been made since 86 in america.
Corrections/Notes:\n0:01 They have not released detailed information on models used (though this is a fair assumption we cannot be sure)\n0:10 Rates of fire vary dramatically and most rifles are practically limited to how fast your trigger finger pulls\n0:15 The mechanism of the gun is not altered only how fast one can pull the trigger\n0:20 This is way to general of a number. Not all automatic weapons are the same.\n0:46 This is statistical abuse. While muzzle loaders have been around for *most* of The US's 241 years, semi-automatics have made up the vast majority of firearms since post WW1. Semi-automatics also include handguns, most shotguns, and most/many long rifles.\n1:00 10 round magazines have only been normal for a few years now. 30 round magazines have been standard for decades. \n1:26 The 2nd amendment does not imply use for hunting or home defense. The 2nd amendment is explicitly for the application of citizen militias and an armed population in response to the confiscation of weapons by the British government. \n\n\nAll and all the fault of this video (aside from incorrect facts and lack of citation) is in not understanding what differentiates a semi-automatic assault rifle from any other style of firearm. Any metric you mentioned in this video could also be applied to handguns, non-assualt rifles, long rifles, and shotguns. In fact, handguns often have higher rates of fire, with higher caliber ammunition, with larger available magazines, and account for hundreds of times more shootings than what you're mistakenly referring to as semi-automatic rifles rather than assault-rifles.
No bias in a Vox video. That’s... refreshing.
I just want to know why the hell any kind of GUNS are legal there.
Vox, why are you impartial on your information, you are not restricted like news companies - so why?
Soooooooo much misinformation in this video. Typical liberal vid, no knowledge on guns whatsoever.
Vox is missing some key facts here. A rifle of any form, including semiautomatic, is not deadly. Neither are standard capacity 30 round mags. Nor do bump fire stocks make a rifle more deadly. The person using it does. Their mindset and intentions make a rifle deadly. This is the same kind of linguistics used by democrats pushing gun control laws after every single shooting, please stop.
Oh and in 2010 Obama was president. It was his ATF at that time who Ok'd the Bump Stock. Vox twisting things again.
One you cant compare semi auto rate of fire to full automatic rate, because the rate of fire can differ from manufacturer to manufacturer, and model to model, two, full auto fire arms are not illegal, they are taxed and heavily regulated by the government,  three the bill had no proposal for bump stocks and the highlighted portion of the bill you specifically show says detachable, which even hunting rifle have detachable stocks because you can seperate the action, stock, and barrel for most every firearm, four you canot compare magazines and clips they serve two seperate functions one is used to aid in loading a weapon, and the other is used to house the rounds befor cycling into the action, 5 the man had ten guns, at that point magazine capacity is not an issue, even if every gun had one five round mag thats 50 rounds without reloading, and to that if i had 10 5 round magazines for one weapon my reload times are a few seconds not enough to hinder most acts of violence,
I would have hoped that a channel with over 2 million subscribers would have actually done there homework on what they are making a video about instead of just putting out trendy fake facts
Because $100 gets you 25+ guns and tons of ammo, and a lifetime of experience on evading the police, that take an hour to get to you. Sure....
Are semi Auto rifles called 'semiautomatic shotgun(s)' in US legislation? Otherwise you might want to reread that final Screenshot where the whole folding stock thing clearly applies to shotguns and not as far as my understanding goes, not rifles. Also the kind of stock used is not described by those 3 terms and would not be banned by that legislation. Not to mention you wouldn't put a 'bump stock?' on a shotgun anyhow.
Tell all your friends to buy bumpstocks and semi auto rifles with the standard magazine of thirty rounds
Anybody who disagrees with me feel free to respond with your opinions but I feel there is no need for anything other than a handgun or hunting rifle. It’s called an ASSULT rifle for a reason.
Incoming people who think they know about guns saying it wasn't a bump fire stock
I wouldn't tell people this that didn't know now they can easily do so
Also, for those of you complaining that there’s so many factual errors in the video, maybe you need to brush up on your fun facts. The comments about standard magazines is based on state law and not the common people’s choice, so 10 is the correct number.
I just want to say this; unless you are a hardcore gun enthusiast, you most likely had no idea what a bump-stock was prior to this horrible shooting in Las Vegas
The law wasn't voted on because it would have made removable stocks illegal.... It wasn't about bump stocks, it was about ar style rifles.
But the real problem is that the concert was a gun free zone so it's impossible for the shooter to kill all those people. So this is all fake
This is disgusting. Semi automatic weapons are pretty typical actually. Pretty much every handgun with the exception of revolvers are semi automatic. All it means is that it fires one shot per trigger squeeze and it uses the force from the discharge to cycle the action. Slidefire stocks do increase rate of fire, but thousands upon thousands have been sold, and this is the first time they have really been used maliciously. Why don't we stop talking about guns and gun violence, and start talking about stopping all violence. Because when you take the gun out of Gun Violence you're just left with violence. Who cares what tool is used?
banning something doesn't make it vanish into thin air, nor does it wave a magic wand to make every ones boogieman fears go away. remember when we tried that with alcohol?
Semiautomatic just means that you reload one bullet per trigger pull and fire one bullet. Most guns are semi you idiots.
The gun did it!!!! We figured it out how do we lock it up though? Case closed
The best comeback for the NRA is arm everyone (criminals/ civilians) and they will defend themselves.. How would you defend your self from bullets raining down from the sky
30 rounds in 10 seconds LoL what 85 year old man did they find to shot that slowly. way off on the rate of fire. An average shooter with a fair amount of training can get a rate of fire of 5-6 rounds a second. a bump fire stock(mechanical advantage) can bump that up to 10 rounds a second. and before anyone calls bullshit, you are literally on YouTube. just type in 30 Rounds in 3 seconds and watch any one of the hundreds of videos of people clearing a magazine in 3 seconds.\nbut in case you're to lazy to type it in for yourself here you go.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqFZOguWBCk\nhere's another \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVOTRrnRkYU\nwant more? too bad, go look it up yourself. lazy ass bum.
Any insane idiot can do as much damage or possibly more with components online or from a hardware store. Remember the Boston marathon or 911
Not for nothing but you highlighted a subsection referencing shotguns.  I don't really care about this opinion piece but you should at least read the proposed legislation long enough to get to the correct place.  While you are at it you could mention the other things this legislation proposed to ban. My $.02.
How to make any American angry starter pack:\n1. 911\n2. Gun Control\n3. Partisan politics\n4. Climate change
I say ban something, make it at least harder for people to do these things with guns and stop making all the good people with look bad.
Do you know anything about guns besides pew pew?
Instead of banning guns can we ban criminals instead?
The CIA involve this mine control responsible for the massacre
You can ban bump fire stocks, but they are 3d printable, so you won't be able to stop a person who wants to kill alot of people. Again more policies being pushed that would accomplish nothing.
The only people this LAW is going to affect is LAW abiding citizens.\nLet's just remember what happened in the 1920's with prohibition...
I find it ironic that people want to restrict or even ban guns altogether. Yet, most movies and TV shows glorify guns. Why don't we start talking about this issue. It would be a lot easier to have this discussion.
well no duh the bill never came up for a vote,  she wanted to ban all stocks, not just bump stocks
Or it’s because he made a modified sear to shoot ACTUALLY fully automatic, and the fire rate differs in gun to gun.
This is full of incorrect, misleading statements.  It reads like you started with an anti-gun conclusion and then twisted facts to meet your goal.  Before you write an article so based on various gun details, you should learn more about your subject.  \n\nYou aren't alone though.  It is all to common to find such sloppy articles aimed mostly at an audience that also doesn't realize all the errors.
Why can’t vox stay neutral every video they make is very liberal and doesn’t show other viewpoints and can be very misleading
Vox is so iffy with their topics sometimes. Gun Control is like the War on Drugs, no matter how much money and effort is put into it, maniacs will still get weapons to kill other people. Whether it's a homemade explosive, an illegal street gun converted into a fully automatic, or if it's a scoped hunting rifle from the top of a building.
It is legal to own a fully automatic weapon depending on state law and if a class 3 FFL is acquired.
Bump stocks don't kill people.
Didn't King Liberal Obama approve these bump stocks as a non threat.  Liberals should dethrone the King after that failure.  Spending too much time with Ellen  and Oprah to actually pay attention to what his administration was doing.
Vox stop posting only part of the story, how about you tells us the the bill wasn't just about Bump Stocks but all sporting goods attachments for firearms, which is why it was never voted on because it would never pass. Left wing nut job, but please Vox keep feeding the mass half baked news
5K dislikes, because rednecks with Internet access can't handle facts.
Conservatives like to push the narrative that guns shouldn’t be addressed, but mental illness should be, while they support politicians and policies that gut mental health coverage.
All of a sudden everyone is a gun expert.
Rip vegas
Nice one America
So petty
FALSE FLAG IDIOTS
#vegasstrong
, simple people kill people
We should ban planes too. And Ryder trucks, and propane tanks, and fertilizer. And gasoline.
Facepalm
Raw sauce, no ketchup.
Vox you such garbage.
wrong.
FAKE NEWS!!!
Just use a modded controller
All liberals will be eradicated shortly
Pulse gun
FAKE
Thought I was watching buzzfeed for a second with all this false information!
i sense multiple levels of autism in this video
FIRST OFF IT IS NOT ILLEGAL TO OWN A AUTOMATIC WEAPON. YOU JUST HAVE TO PAY 200 BUCKS AND GET A SPECIAL PERMIT. \n\nAlso I have a bump fire stock and its fun af to shoot. \n\nLaws against firearms will only hurt lae abiding citizens. Criminals can an will obtain illegal weapons.
For anyone that doesn't understand much about firearms, regardless of your viewpoints on guns\n\nVOX lied about 80% of this video. Straight misinformation and lies
The video mistakenly says that automatic weapons are illegal. This is false. It still possible to own and transfer automatic weapons that are registered and were made prior to may 1986. Why do so many people fail to ask a gun expert about the laws????
Jesus Christ! This is the worst video I have ever seen. There is so many wrong statements in this video.
I'm a simple man, I see a vox video, I dislike
You are Fake News
Stupid liberal fools! Y'all ain't gonna stop until we're a third world hell hole with zero freedom!
Typo correction - Firearm\nnot Weapon!
Misinforming
For defense purposes, why not just buy a pistol?
All this crap about needing stricter gun laws and banning stuff is just ridiculous. If anyone for any reason wanted a gun to do harm regardless if they were illegal or not would obtain one. People that have their minds set on hurting others will ultimately achieve it unless there is someone able to eradicate the threat. It’s truly awful how many people died in Vegas, but just think if he didn’t have a gun and walked in the middle of that crowd with a bomb strapped under his clothes. It would of been worse. I believe more people need to educate themselves on guns and actually carry. It might not of helped in this situation, but with police needing time to respond we as citizens should defend each other when the first few minutes matter most.
I'm seeing a lot of Vox is wrong, but not what they're wrong about or more importantly, what's a better solution to the gun death issues?
I thought this video was going to go on longer. But it didn't. There is alot more info that could've been presented for informational purposes about bump stocks. Not looking for an argument but let's present all the information instead of just leaving it at, well we could've done more but we didn't. Not only is it cart infront of the horse logic but the argument at hand is much more complicated than that. There are always gray areas that need to be discussed. Give us more to discuss. This leaves me with more of a one-sided feeling. When we should be working toward more of a I understand your position try to understand mine.
You know what.. for an outlet like Vox, this was not that bad.  I'll allow it considering
People who say this video has misinformation, why don't bother correcting it?
We are a blessed nation. Everything works out for the best. You have to break a few eggs to make an omlet.
This video is so dishonest and skewed buy a left-leaning liberal agenda what a bunch of BS
wow white people are so racist and i thought the 60s are over
I feel like this is a lot of half truths
Better go give $500,000 loans to everyone in Chicago. Probably a great return in investment
I mistakenly thought this was a comedy channel. Turns out its just a deceitful or misinformed leftist propaganda channel with a dopey fat virgin failing to be funny or clever.
All this video does is make people living in the suburbs feel bad. Also it gives a bad mentality for people living in the poorer neighborhoods, since you are telling them it’s society’s fault for their situation. This can make them pity themselves and say how they’re poor because of racism, rather than trying to change their situation. And yes I do agree about how it is important to remember the past, however I think you should do so in a constructive way instead of just complaining.
Well If we worked on having a small government (cut all government/social/public programs, restrictions, etc) & used a free-market capitalistic system instead of the democratic capitalism then everything will be a even playing field. \n\nEven without that there are other facts, like single parent-hood, poor decision making, lack of personal responsibility, low financial IQ, etc & all these things are within our control. Not matter the race those things play the largest factor in your wealth.
What's funny here?
What do you know, another 'dear white people, 'cause that's not trendy right now. Downvoted 'cause it's supposed to be College Humor not College Sermon.
Lies my school has blacks and latinos at most and not many whites and we have avid iv and other programs
*Scrolls down to comments, grabs bag of popcorn*
how many drive-bys happen in the suburbs  ?
Well, this video is actually quite right. However it works on the same principles as if I told you the benefits of burning trash, but neglected the negatives.\n\nin 1968 racism was officially illegal, it is therefore prosecutable to do racist things (such as not allow loans to black or white people). However since 1968 we have passed laws into a different direction. Under the pretext of fighting racism - we have created racism. Today an asian must score much higher on their tests to get to the same university as a black person, black people get much more gov’t subsidies/help under the idea of everyone is the same, so we MUST pay for the one lacking...\n\nThe point is this. Today america is becoming racist to its founding race - whites. You can look it up, there are cases when some people dyed their skin black to get into college. I hope that with the rise of BLM and antifa (and their inevitable massacre under the pretext of “terrorism”) that these policies will be lifted. \n\nRemember - does the descendent of yugoslavia (Serbia) pay the nations that seceded? They commited many atrocities, yet they dont pay anything... does Austria? Austria controlled Slovenia for 1000 years, is slovenia supposed to get money from austria? Where does this end? Will the US get money from the UK? Or will the UK get money from the US?\n\nRemember that the triangle trade only happened because blacks themselves sold their kind for european technology - it was their choice, knowing full well what would happen. Should blacks pay whites because they got them to america?\n\nAs you can see this is where this eventually leads. This video should be taken as propaganda. Using past justifications for the policies of today is extremely close to what the nazis believed in.
'Insufferably black neighborhood' is what you meant to say.
Well I'm IRISH white with blue collar veteran heritage dating back hundreds of years. Here I am living my legacy in a single wide well water fed trailer in a trailer park. (We share the well) let's talk about how the blue collar community is intended to stay blue collar. How we were told that all you have to do is go to college or join the military and you gab reap the benefits. Well here I am! I have an associates degree in telecommunications, an associates degree in precision machine technologies, and a once proud career in the UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. Businesses turn me away because I'm over qualified or I didn't earn my degree through their own training...
Make America great again 🎩🤠
all credibility lost after bringing in a nyt reporter.
17k dislikes... Must be that guilt kicking in LOL....
I don't think the whole point of the video is to my white people feel bad. \n\nIts just teaching us facts we would never learn in school.
this is a shit ton of bull shit!
I live in the los Angeles area, and I'm glad to say, without regards to the housing issue, I have rarely experienced racial discrimination. That's not to say it doesn't exist.\n\n The KKK seriously went around the affluent (white) areas of the city of Whittier, and left notes saying make Whittier white again.  The middle class areas are very diversified though. All different kinds of races.
This is bullshit 😂 go around Dallas and surrounding cities in Texas. For every 3 white families there’s an Asian, Indian/middle easter (I know they’re Asian, just bare with me) or black family. Given the percentage the population of each race, I’d say each race is more than fairly represented. And I’m not talking about average houses, these are in the range of $200k-$600k houses.
Butthurt asf youtube Nazis all up in this comment section I see lol.
You can't already ruin what was awful to start
ya know, when I first heard of this video people were accusing it of intentionally pandering to further divide between race.\nbut that's /pol/ for you of course.\nsitting comfy in my slumlord town watching this :3
It was the democrats who created this whole thing from the beginning. Jim Crow laws were created by democrats, democrats themselves were the ones who were against the Civil Rights Act in the 60s. But republican leaders were able to convince some of them to help pass the law with LBJ signature.
I live in Sugar Land, Texas and my neighbors are Chinese and a Indian family lives just down the street from us and I had six black classmates in my elementary days. My grandfather's doctor was even Puerto Rican!
OK if you're black or Hispanic then work hard so you don't have to live in the bad neighborhoods. Im Hispanic my mother and father have worked really hard and I have a very nice house a nice neighborhood. Stop using race for stupid shit it don't matter. You don't like then work hard it's the land of the free. You become what you work hard forZ
Bull Crap! You not only skipped like 50 decades of affirmative action and minority incentives, but you also dont talk about Republican push for... School Choice! WHY??? Your segregated Crap schools, spend THOUSANDS more per student, yet are admittedly ineffective, inferior to more suburban, and now apparently racist! Well Betsy Devose should be your hero! SCHOOL CHOICE FOR ALL! LIBERALS WAKE UP! These people LIE for a living!
So I live in rural Canada and attend a high school that has ONLY TWO people of colour it, and every year there has been threats of our school shutting down due to lack of funding; however, larger schools in the city that are predominantly middle eastern, so much so that they have more signs in Arabic than English and French combined, are receiving grants from the Gov. for expansion. Weird.
Everything is about racism, to a racist.
At the end, Adam was trying so hard not to use the term White privilege to describe the privilege that guy had lmao....snowflakes wouldve been so triggered
I'd rather the opposite than what a queer thinks he knows
Some of these suburbs were literally named with Green in the name. Greenbelt, Maryland; Greendale, Wisconsin; and, Greenhills, Ohio, where my mother was born and raised.
Looks like people are finally getting tired of race-baiting. That's a good sign.
So Gideon from Gravity Falls is real?
Why do all the black celebrites and sports stars live away from other blacks?
And here we are again.\n1-hate América(im not american)\n2-hate white people\n3-cast terrible actors(yes, they are atrocious)\nDoes any episode of this Season do not do this?Its Like antifa itself wrote the script.\n\nFirst Season was wayyyy better.
In a Nutshell: Black neighborhoods are a cesspit of crime and violence
Wake me when the humor starts... Unsubbed due to I get enough political bs watching the NFL.
Insufferably white, glad we know the kind of folks who wrote this.
THE EQUITY AUTHORITARIANS MUST BE STOPPED
Hahaha, I went to both the blackest and whitest highschools in my area. The black highschool had the best ap courses, the best athletic field and best technology... By far. The white school still had better ranking in grades because of parent involvement.
white ppl are the most sensitive ppl on earth holy shit. they call you racist for saying the past was racist 😂😂😂
Thank you for bringing light to the truth! I loved the whole thing
I don't understand. If shitty neighbourhoods are 100% due to circumstances and not race, why are poor black neighbourhoods riddled with crime, but poor white neighbourhoods have almost no crime?\n\nGee Adam. Its almost like your trying to paper over racial differences in intelligence and psychology, by blaming all differences on circumstances.
Look at how many people dislike the video. If you don't like to hear stuff like this stop voting for, and creating racist policies.
What happened to comedy? Can comedians please go back to doing their jobs?
Children from White families who have a combined household income of less than $20k dollars score the same on their SATs as the children from Black families who have a combined household income of more than $200,000 per year.
hahahaha.....it's funny because this video is a pile of horseshit.
Nowadays they'll use anything from the past as an excuse to hate and attack white people. I liked this video up until the very end... The guy said he didn't know that this was still happening, and he worked hard to get his house, but their response to him was cold and what.... apparently he has to feel white guilt?? For what? So he doesn't deserve to have a nice house he got because 80+ years ago it wasn't fair?? Give me a break! \n\nA black person can make a great living and afford a house in a nice suburb, and there's nothing stopping them. We just moved into suburbs and we have a black family move in down the street. Brand new construction. These houses are NOT cheap. I'm not bragging, just pointing that out. So it's not impossible. But like the guy in the vid said, he worked HARD to get that house. HARD WORK. It's gotta happen. That's the key. His skin color didn't give him that house. His work ethic and money smarts did. I imagine the new family in our neighborhood's father has a really nice job to afford their house. Handouts won't get you a place in these types of neighborhoods. They just won't. No matter your race. Or they unwisely purchased it with outrageous amounts of debt and will most likely lead to being house broke or foreclosure.\n\nIf there is unfair or illegal discrimination, it SHOULD be stopped. Discrimination is HORRIBLE and I most certainly condemn it. But blame the individual or company that does it, not all white people.
This comments section gives me hope for a peaceful future, filled with interracial harmony.  It seems as if this video is universally hated, yet somehow it has a 50k to 17k like to dislike score.  Youtube has a female CEO, and the platform has gone downhill ever since she took over the company.  Maybe women don't belong in positions of leadership.  Sure those positions can potentially offer the greatest rewards in life, but most leaders are defeated, and I have yet to see a woman who can handle defeat.
While everyone's talking about race. Anyone else hear the Sims 3 music?!
I want Adam to make an episode on IPhone and show how Apple copied technologies from the other brands.
The hard truth of today man
college humor??? did i miss something?? this wasn't even close to being funny! why is it that all these comedy shows are getting more and more preachy, and less and less funny?
What I got from this is that poor, stupid people should stop having kids. I don't see how this is a government problem.
Insufferably white\nSo progressive!!1!11!!!\n\nHow about I go and call Detroit insufferably black?  LOL you people are the exact opposite of self aware.
Oh man I guess my award winning Californian school is underfunded
lol i wonder if they turned off the likes.dislikes i bet it was when dislikes started spiking
why don't they just build close communities and help each other out of poverty? us Jews do it all the time.
I suppose it would be better than living in an *insufferably* black neighborhood.
You'd think that if a people were punished, burdened, hated and oppressed by this much by the host nation they would start to accumulate around a specific area -- in the size of a single or multiple states -- slowly displacing the original population with their own where they are able to practice their own culture where, live among like-minded people and try to secede, to leave the oppressors. hmmmm....
thats weird i live in a suburbs that have lots if hispanics and indians barley any whites
What's wrong with a suburb being mostly white?
Why are y'all playing Sims 3s music lmao
This is liberal propaganda. Look at Detroit. Their school systems received much more funding than the average student in the US. This video is nothing but a lie.
is this CNN?\ni can't see the screen anymore\nits just covered head to toe in lies and fake news\nwhere is the video? where is the Humor? ....Hello?
So jews are the most racist race then?
Litter the suburbs with minorities and watch the low trust, crime rate skyrocket.
I hate having to feel guilty for being white😂
I love that guy. From the dog show with stan.
It's amazing to see how many people have woken up against college humor.
Nothing a red haired feminist cant fix - Not Gay Jared
I love how these people act as if everyone is not one pay check away from being homeless.
'member when CH was funny?
Nothing wrong with white people living together. What is wrong is that banks, like everything else in America during the early and mid 1900s were racist toward people of color (mainly the blacks). Thus, the blacks didn't have the same opportunities to get into good neighborhoods or schools. That just the truth of the situation. They weren't given a fair chance to own property or make business adventure. And the impact of that racism is still felt today. It's only been 1 or 2 generations since then. A lot of the people who experienced this are still alive. And they were definitely disadvantaged by that racism, which led to them not doing as well in life, and then they raise their kids in that situation, who go on to raise their kids in that situation as well. Yes, it is possible to work hard and break the wheel, but that is not the case for most people in the world. Most people end up being in the same working class and in the same environment as their parents. Raised in the hood you probably stay in the hood. Raised in the trailer park, you probably stay in trailer park. Raised in the suburbs, you'd probably stay in the suburbs. The wealth that  parents and grandparents had/have does impact the children today.And it is a fact that white parent's and grandparents were afforded more opportunities than minorities.  Very few people rise above, become wealthy, do well and aren't a product of their environment. Those people are few and rare. They are exceptions, and you all expect every person of color to be an exception. Why is it so hard to even consider that other people weren't afforded the same opportunities as you? Does it make you feel like you accomplished less? It's not 100% of the time, which might be why you are so quick to retaliate against the truth that people of color weren't given a fair chance, but sometimes (sometimes-SOMETIMES- idk u caught it yet, but ->sometimes<-) in America, life is easier if you're white.
Once again, the government causes the problem. Only solution in a democracy? More govt. It's an endless cycle of incompetence
When whites move only to white neighborhoods they call it redlining, when we move to black neighborhoods they call it gentrification. I'm sure they'll come up with a way to claim being homeless while white is somehow racist next.
how is this humor?
lol my neighborhood is all Indian and Asian and there are no white people
I don't know why right-wingers are so angry about this. Go ask any informed small government advocate, and they'll tell you Adam is 100% correct. \n\nAdam has just described how big government housing policy was used by racist politicians to secure their votes, and crush those who didn't vote for them. Then, because public schools only admit children from certain zones nearby, the schooling also became massively segregated.\n\nIt's obvious the solution in this case would be to end any remainder of that terrible government program, and start a school voucher program so black children can attend schools in other areas.
This guy is super racist since he is implying that white suburbs are better.
Id just like to say that saying a place is EITHER too white or too black is inherently racist in the first place. Maybe if we weren't taught to view everything as a race issue it would become less of an issue.
Yay America
ok libtard
You're insufferably cucked
My guy.
horseshit!
Adam Ruins Facts.....everytime
Not in canada!!!
Sims ost?\n Nice
Are you Buzzfeed?
This is Marxist propaganda.
SJW filth.
Louder With Crowder #240
No college, no humor. False advertising.
Let me take a WILD guess...  the suburbs are disturbing because white people are evil and you hate America right?
Guess what? White families get ripped off and hired less where I live. You know how many places turned my away when looking for jobs because We don't hire white people? Also if I don't want to get attacked, I have to live among the elderly Mexicans. If you look like you don't belong in most areas, you will be targeted.
Did you notice any banding issues with the screen at low or mid brightness?
The non xl pixel is actually fucking disgusting.  The bezels on top and bottom are just unacceptable.  But you know, undisclosed paid promotion from Google prevents reviewers about speaking up
this still have the fingerprint gesture/swipe? i dont think any video ive seen mention it
How much will this be in Canadian dollars? I debating whether or not to go back to Googles flagships or remain with OnePlus and money is certainly a factor.
From a usability point of view, i appreciate the thicker sids bezels because it seems it's the most area i hit my mistake on my gs8 + . \nLong story short : you would be a happy camper with your pixel 2 xl.
Pixel 2 XL nails all the fundamental aspects of a great smartphone brilliantly except design. While the design is certainly good, it doesn't seem very refined and some elements of it are quite bothersome. I wasn't asking for a beautiful design but at least it should be polished to look premium, something which I can't say about the thick and unsightly top bezel that causes asymmetry and the noticeable side bezels. I'm hoping it's something that'll grow on me by time. But aside from that, it's still the best overall smartphone right now IMO. But why can't it or any other phone be just flawless (by realistic standards)? Why does some annoyance always have to exist on every phone? Waiting for 2018.
To the folks complaining about the missing headphone jack. Technology is constantly changing. When are headphone manufacturers going to change their headphones to the c style. Adapters are available so it is not complicated.
white and blue look like plastic ...? is it plastic?
+Marques Brownlee I'm sorry to bring it back to 2012 but \n\nY U NO MAKE MORE INFORMATIVE PIXEL VIDEOS@!?
Love the design on the back. But that is personal prefernce. Also love the location of the finger scanner. Otherwise I will stick with my note8.
Oh boy, I can't wait! The new Google phones are out! It's time to take a look at what --\n\n**realizes that they got rid of the headphone jack**\n\nAhhhhhhhh SCREW YOU, GOOGLE
ugly design ...  what a shame  google ..this phone will lose against note 8 and iphone x .. stupid company
That's one fugly phone! I didn't expect this from the creators of Nexus series, which had one of the most trendiest designs of its times.\n\nI have owned multiple Nexus devices and this is a real disappointment.
$850 for a phone? FUCK NO!!!
Do people really care that much about assistants? I've never felt the need to use mine.
it is as ugly as shit....
When Google is so incredibly dense they don’t understand that 2 lenses are for more than just bokeh. I think optical zoom is the reason people want dual lens Google. Being able to fucking zoom in at 2x without a loss in quality. Jesus Christ.
Boring.\nEDIT: Thick side bezels!?\nWhy are we all so damned spoiled. I mean shit, its still just another slab of glass and metal that calls and texts.
I feel like complaining about side bezels is a problem unique to tech reviewers.
What color is your phone? It's kinda blue
No headphone jack... Useless to me.
I want that background! pls someone :O
Bezels, the smaller version looks like it was made in 2006, no headphone jack, no expandable storsge, I'll pass. \n\nAlso nice of Google to diss Apple for removing the headphone jack last year.. then they pull this shit.
take the case off
The Pixel 2 is one of the most ugliest 1980's, Toys 'R' US, LEGO looking phone I have ever seen.
Did you think the best smartphone in this year is not the most futuristic aspects but is the classic futuristic aspects?
711 was not an inside Job
i dont like the design
Looks like an amazing phone. But no headphone jack? I will stick with my V20 and my quad dac.
Kind of blue with the teal colored power button reminds me of the Air Mags
This photo is plain ugly as shit, smaller one has bezels bigger than screen
Looks like an old iPod touch.
What happened now? The great Google runned out of ideas it has to follow Apple? What a shame 😂
Does anyone notice the Android authority dude at the start of the video
Have to admit Samsung's Galaxy 8 has really been the best this year. I'm in love with it
That is one ugly phone 😝
The bezels actually make it more durable. From experience its really worth it! Dropped mine a billion times and all i have are a few scratches and no broken sceen
marques could you gift me a phone
The phone does not get me want to have it. Sorry Google, you are boring.
First LG, then Apple, now Google? Why is everyone trying to copy Samsung lol.
anyone saw Joshua Vegara (Sorry if I misspelled your name ) in the intro??
Oh look, a black guy with a new phone. Did you give up child support or your Jordans for it?
Does the Pixel 2 come with an unlocked SIM? I live in China, and I'm wondering if I can drop my China Mobile SIM in this phone.
the design looks dated....super ugly af!
The edges are basically there to accommodate the squeeze feature of the phone. And coming from a galaxy edge phone, squeezing a phone with edge screens would be such a nuisance.
Lg V30 is d way to go!!
You had to know some people watching would have a Google Home, so how about not saying the wake word?
ffs, don't say ok google in a video
I will get it if it has headphone jack.
NSA and Fbi  can listen thru the mic 24/7
Google should bring back Nexus phones at Nexus prices
Have you tried snapchat on either phone yet? Curious to see how it translates.
Hey Marques.\nI like this phone. Some complain about actual bezels... for me, I need something to actually hold on to, not just goofy side-wanna-be screen edge.\nAnother thing, stereo speakers! Finally a PDA (personal digital assistant), with proper audio output without playing around with additional cluster-crap cables.\n\nGood video Dude.
Seen that piece of shit Vegas shooter on the news feed example
Interesting but too expensive compared to the Samsung and LG flagships and no wireless charging. Pass.
-Not bezelless\n-No headphone jack\n-No microSD card slot\n\nFor that price, I'll pass.
Marques Brownlee nice video I love it please sub back I put you in my subscription I like all your video. But your video not help. Because my old account YouTube zamgamer v9 ik how to make software for phone so I can help you make one for the note 8 for the s7 7.1.1. Nice video bro keep it up with a good work brother. Help you out if you help me out. Not with the software. Good work thanks you bro. Talk to me. Bye nice video.
Of all the companies who will eventually follow apple and remove the headphone port, I didn't expect google to be one of them.
Thumbs up for front facing stereo speakers it's the best place to put them on...thumbs down to everything else,starting for the price,where is it made from???Germany,Japan??? We all know where these devices are made from, how much does the Pixel 2 XL actually cost???Stop overpricing phones!!!
Can you comment on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL screen differences?
You gotta do a review on the Nura headphones
No headphone jack, bezels are still too big, camera bump, I prefer the original pixels white with silver and I don't like coloured power button. Seems like a downgrade to me. \nOnly positives are the slightly smaller(I know) bezels and waterproofing.
that design is as bad as google's logo
When they attack apple over the head phone jack then they do the same😂
Can your next video be on chrome os?
Keep up the great work, watched u since u first made windows xp on android phone!!!
So they just called Lens Blur from Nexus 5 portrait mode
Idk, I have the original Pixel and this looks like an enormous improvement. I only use wireless headphones now so the removal of the headphone jack doesn't exactly bother me a whole lot. I think I might exchange my pixel for a discount.
He keeps implying that the old Pixel phones were not OLED, Which they were.
Downvoted because you've been disabling auto-closed captioning for several of your videos now..
It's literally what a phone should NOT be.\n\n- Ugly design\n- No headphone jack\n- No wireless charge\n- Thick bezels (especially the small one)\n- Expensive
am i the only one that doesnt like the rounded corners of the screen? :s
looks like a prototype design on Pixel 2 XL
Hit like if u find it ugliest phones ever
How ever I don’t like Androids
Huge let down, I was hyped for this phone but those bezels and design, I think Samsung and Apple are still in the lead for best Smartphones.
This looks so much better than the IPhone8....
Can someone please help I have been deciding on buying some bluetooth in earphones and I Am having trouple deciding. Right now im debating on the beats x, jaybird x3, and jaybird x bluebuds. I have never owned a pair of bluetooth earphones.what do you guys think. feel free to recomend other brands of bluetooth earphones preferably no more than $160
So...the squeeze is a gimmick on the HTC U11 but a nice feature on the google pixel?
Very ugly and expensive
Its expensive
R.I.P headphone jack
No headphone jack ? Pfff.. note 8 here I come
but not dual camera
No 3.5mm, no buy.
eh ?why camera pop out again
Ugly
No Headphone Jack? Fuckkkk 😑
No headphone jack, no thank you.🤦
Pixel 2 has bigger bezel than OnePlus One. Just sayin.
Good video, but no headphone jack, smh.
Lame.
ANOTHER GOOGLE FAIL
Water resistant?
Feels totally like an iphone
Too much bitching
Awesome video dude
Wonderful!
Very ugly
New Screen Vs Old Screen
If you think about it, it is messed up,  that they told him they were gonna change his voice to make it more menacing and did nothing to it :/ I don't  think its a smart Idea to lie to your talent like that. Especially, the really famous talent.
Wow I feel bad for him... 4:59 this is bad voice over and I think he knows it judging from his cringe.

This dude was awful in Mass Effect Andromeda and sounds like he is awful in this game too...why do these devs keep paying him to do this..? Its embarrassing.
I just realized Conan and kumail look really similar in some angles and lighting
Kumail: ...and the voice acting?\nConan: So anyways. Shadow of War...\nHahaha part killed me.
I miss the days when it would just be Conan failing at a game and abusing Aaron, now Aaron's barley in it and instead they have some celebrity guest that Conan is nice to. I like mean Conan, if he's not insulting someone's character I want him to be beating on them mercilessly.
Are they really using that in the game? 😂
You should keep doing Clueless Gamer with funny people.  The weird ones where you're just creeping on socially awkward people are painful to watch.
Best thing I've seen all week. Easily.
I wonder what Tolkien would think of this.
Why no Elijah Wood here? Good guest though
I don't know, I like the character. Doesn't take me out of the game at all (is what I assume I'll be saying after I've actually played the game).
The textures and lip-synching don't look very promising at all...
One of the better CG episodes. They should really get more celebs that actually have played some games before (or have VA in the game)
Lord of the rings the return of the king will always be the best lotr game, then the two towers.
One of kumails line should of been show bob and vagene
Was not even that interested in this game but kumails voice is great seriously thou they didnt need all orcs with low deep voices good pick up even if it wasnt the greatest acting
Conan’s dynamic with Aaron reminds me of the one Norm Macdonald has with Adam Eget
Who is this Near Eastern man?
Scurried in like a rat he totally did too ahahaha
Kumail you're an amazing gamer\nAnd the voice acting\nSo anyway \nOh burn lol
I never knew PC stands for personal computer. I thought it was some special type of computer
How do they have thus already.  Fuckers.
Finally a Pakistani Hollywood actor
Wasn't gonna get this game but now I thinking I might
I heard Kumail recorded his lines on his phone while he was aimlessly strolling around his local Wholefoods.
I love these things. Conan should guest start on all the gamer YT channels.
Where do I put the credit card in this slot machine?
Dunno who this i guy is but i like it
This looks exactly like shadow of Mordor. But with slightly better graphics.
I cant wait for this game.
This should be every week. Clueless gamer is great
Day 1 buy. A game you can lose yourself in. Those orcs...
So which is better? Kumail as a Salarian or as an Orc?
Mmm always a blessed day when clueless gamer comes out
Kumail is AWESOME!\n\nI met him  at a show in Atlanta a few years ago. What happened next I couldn't make up if I tried. I GOT PULLED UP ON STAGE TO PERFORM STAND UP COMEDY!!!!\n\nI was taking professional lessons on how to be a stand up comic. We had homework as you would in any class. Go see someone live or you cannot perform. The rules could not be more clear. About two weeks before I was supposed to perform I decided to go and see Thomas Middleditch and Kumail Nanjiani as my watch a comedian perform live homework.\n\nThey were awesome and after the show they had a little Q and A. I asked for advice on how to perform stand up comedy. They pulled me up on stage in front of THEIR sold out show of 500 people. I got pity laughs there is really no other way of saying it. The material I performed wasn't finished but some people found it genuinely funny. I got to talk to Kumail and Thomas for a few minutes afterwards.\n\nTwo weeks later I performed on the exact same stage they had when I was supposed to. And I killed it. The only reason I did was because I performed on stage with them first. That was absolutely terrifying to get pulled up on stage at their show but because I did performing my own set a few weeks later wasn't difficult at all. I really got into comedy and genuinely want to pursue the profession. Then I got sick for 2 years within a few weeks after that one big performance. It's been well over a year now that I keep saying I will get back on stage this month I haven't yet though ><
Laugh Tracks in the year 2017 LUL
All I hear is Prismo.
he looked like Jimmy Carr in the thumbnail
It's funnier with him alone on his own or with his tech guy
It's funny Conan mentions phoning it in because that's exactly what he did for Mass Effect Andromeda
Wow Aaron lost a lot of weight
Lmfao I thought he sounded the same like way back on the agonizer behind the scenes
his voice is not changed at all.
More like Shadow of Microtransactions!
that jacket Conan is wearing  is old as fhck
I miss aaron and conan playing🙁
Ahhh I've been waiting too long for another Clueless Gamer video...now I can die in peace
Do you want another bottle of Hennessy?
Keep politics out of comedy
Please just play more with Aaron Blair. Those clueless gamers are so much better.
To bad Conan didnt get to the part where you have to grind 40 plus hours in the final chapter doing tedius grinding for the true ending or speed that crappy unfun process along by buying LOOT BOXES! Prepare to get scammed each playthrough by Warner Bros.
So I just found out about the Shadow Wars endgame.....\n\nReally thinking about canceling my preorder after seeing this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-61uMtjcSz0&t=0s
The white head guy is the best! I love him!
Seriously tho. Why didn't they change his voice??
I cringed when I thought I heard Conan give him an Orc name:  Kumail the Non-Jihadi.  Only through the comments did I learn his name was actually Kumail Nanjiani.
Not as funny as I was hoping. The Clueless Gamer bit is much better and funnier with Conan's buddy Aaron!
Personally I'm glad they didn't change his voice. he's hilarious.
One of the better recent Clueless Gamers. Thank god. I was getting scared there for a bit.
When you realize that’s mike from the streams
Conan stfu, no one want's to hear you speak
I looked it up on IMDB, Kumail actually is in the game as The Agonizer. That makes this game even better!
I would love to see Conan do Comedy Night. That game is amazing.
Battlefront 2 Classic with Aaron and Jordan schlansky , Battlefront 2 2017 with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley
I feel bad for Eren 😅
it sounded good when he was yelling
Kumail was good as Jarun Tann but the voice doesn't fit here as well
That voice lolol
game looks flat
Prismo?
where is aaron
Pied Piper needs funding!
Hahahaha!!
best clueless gamer.
Wow an actually entertaining celeberity
Assassins Creed Orgins
Hahaha! Great video, Conan.
Kumail the Nanjiani
Where's Aaron Blair??
is that LIRIK?
Conan, worst gamer, best entertainer
I like kumails orc so damn much
gold.
I miss Aaron Blair!
*Unique gifts*\n*New Year gifts*\n*https://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira*
So Conan, if Euuah is bad and MMMMmhmmpph is good and Ooof is amazing, how is Grrrr?
I miss Aaron
7:32 i'm dead!!😂😂😂😂
An Indian orc?
U need to try Injustice 2!
Still excited for the game, even with the worst orc voice in all of existence.
Conan got a new leather jacket finally
why does he bully white hair dude, he seems cool
The worst part is that this looks more like a dlc for shadow of Mordor than an entirely new game... I hope I'm not disappointed.

If one person reads this, it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Texas and I'm aware people post comments like this everyday... But I genuinely believe that I'm an artist you'll actually be glad that you heard. If ONE PERSON gives this a thumbs up, you'll be an important part of helping a persons dreams come true. I promise my music is good and you won't be disappointed. I just need a chance and 3 minutes of your time to check out my music on my channel.
You seem to be a class act...if you are...record this and give all proceeds to the victims. They are/were what put you where you are.
Thank you for this. We would have been there if we had gotten tickets. We were there for another country music festival about a year ago and the footage I saw after the shooting showed exactly where we were. We are all loving on each other and getting help when needed including me knowing my military man who would have run back to save people had we been there. After deployments this just did me in emotionally so thank you for this therapy.
Why am I, as a Combat Veteran, Lawful American Citizen, who has served many tours of duty on the front lines, in defense of my fellow Americans' Constitutional Rights, that the moment I return home, honorably discharged, when yet another Radical Leftist shoots up a bunch of likely Liberty Loving, Gun Rights Advocating, Trump Supporters, that no longer do my Constitutional Rights apply? Especially in the most dangerous, high crime, gun free, jurisdictions that have been run by Liberal Democrats?
Wow Eric, you just gained one more fan.
Every person that survived are going to have such a difficult time surviving this horrendous massacre. Prayers to the living that each day can be easier, one day at a time.
I have not heard of Mr. Church until watching this video, but already he has earned my respect. Mr. Church seems to be a true American. God bless you Mr. Church, and God bless America!

Amazing. Eric Church is by far my favorite country singer and this is just another addition to that
Eric,\nYou'll probably never see this message. And that's okay. \nI'm from the same town as heather. My family is friends with hers. Thank you for sharing your soul with us. It. Is. Beautiful. \nYou definitely gained a fan right now. 💜😘
This is why I love music, and music in particular. It can really help ease pain. Beautiful song and thank you for posting, Opry.
Beautiful song Eric Church! May God bless you and Heather Melton! May God bless all who had to witness the tragedy!
Powerful Mr. Church! Thank you
Lived up to its name.   Sin City.
I am mexican. But, viva United States!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I personally do not believe in any God. If you do, I respect that and I admire it. I wish that I could, too.
I have a problem... the most important person in the entire world to me is my cousin. She has this one friend that is jealous of how me and my cousin are better friends than her. She is a massive bully and once even talked my cousin into getting in a fight with me. Me and my cousin are ok now and were back to bring friends but she it's having a Halloween party and of course I'm going... but the bully is too. Yes I have talked to an adult but she didn't too anything about it. Does anyone who sees this give me advice?
so much respect for him
Jesus is coming back soon for His church.  Are you ready?  God bless!
How can anyone give this a thumbs down...
GOD BLESS YOU ERIC, WE LOVE YOU. WE NEED TO UNITE AND PUT OUR LORD AND COUNTRY FIRST. WE LOST LOVED ONES HERE IN CALIFORNIA, AND FAKE NEWS DID NOT CARE !! IM READY TO MOVE TO NASHVILLE!! THERE ISN'T A LOT OF SUPPORT HERE FOR GOD LOVING , COUNTRY MUSIC LOVING AMERICA PATRIOTS. PRAY FOR ME COUNTRY FAMILY!!
Wise words. Thank you
Superb , this is why you are the best.
Eric you rock man.
God Bless You! Much 💙 from Louisiana

If you think that nf is like eminem, your not a true fan.\nAlso if you guys didnt know and your new here, hes a Christian rapper. Thats why he dosent swear at all. He also hates being compared with eminem.\nHis past is also very *very* dark. Im not going to explain, but listen to all of his albums then you'll understand.
This guy needs to collaborate with LOGIC'
damn, this shit is crazy good. gotta say after this album I truly look up to NF and see him as an influence. if anyone cares...

To me it seems that Black Mirror is all flash with no substance. The writers are very good at coming up with imaginative scenarios around technology and it's possibilities, but they all boil down to the same overused trope. It's lacking in the nuances and details that make a really exceptional show. I really think the draw of the show is less that it's genius, and more that it is avante garde. \n\nBasically, the draw of black mirror is the same as under age drinking. It's only fun because it feels rebellious.
I love your videos!
The episode with Domhnall Gleeson ended happily. She was able to put her feelings for him away like a box of keepsakes. She still loved him, her child as well, but they knew that the 'man' in the attic was an approximation.
Pleasure is not the only human motive
REVIEW BLADERUNNER 2049 PLEASE I LOVE YOU ABSOLUTELY
At 0:56, Fifteen Million Merits is credited as being the sixth episode in the third series; it's the second episode of the first series.\n\nI think it's telling that there were few, if any, clips from The Waldo Moment used.  To me that's the only bad episode of the series to date.
unrelated, but please do a video on BLADE RUNNER 2049... I just watched the movie and would love to hear your opinion on it.
Blue Apron is fucking bullshit. Just buy your groceries it's so much cheaper.
How can bb and got still be spoiled at this point.
I dont say thank you because, because of you a what all the black mirror, with, at the end, a bad taste... but it work
Black Mirror is not a tragedy, unless not getting what you want is tragic. It is about the darkest implications of technology, the limitations of using technology as a substitute for reality. Comparing it to Game of Thrones is just odd. Black Mirror is not about tragedy so much as it's about trying to overcome loss and the limitations, shortcomings and consequences. A better comparison would be that it's about the future after the downside has been revealed: Facebook, not when it was hey! I can stay in touch with all my friends, but Facebook with algorithms for advertising to antisemites, it's use by Russian intelligence to undermine American democracy. If I had to write a Black Mirror episode that was five minutes long: Someone finds the perfect mate using an advanced online dating app, they meet, everything is amazing, except one person likes Grand Theft Auto, the other person asks on the way to dinner, 'Can you wait while I run into the bank? then robs it, starts a shoot out and as police close in hops back into the car.
It wasn't to underage kids, that what the other guy did and Kenny was too shocked to disagree and clear it up before they fought to the death
Is this like Outer Limits?
Maybe now that you can cook you could stop using Blue Apron b/c that company creates so much waste.
My favourite episode of black mirror is the Christmas special season 2 because it makes you think the most about how blackmailing can be used for good but the consequences of it to
Black Mirror seems to me like a good example of cyberpunk, with the emphases on advancing technology and the resulting dystopian elements, especially in regards to economic class. However, I think the more plausible sub-genre of science fiction is a sub-genre known as post-cyberpunk, in which the sheer number of issues stay the same; some problems are solved with technology while new ones arise. This, I believe, is what we've seen with past advances in technology. For example, the development of antibiotics was a profound achievement in medicine, but it is also because of those antibiotics that we now worry about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I did recall that the various iterations of Ghost in the Shell are an example of post-cyberpunk, especially the Stand-Alone Complex series. I think the sub-genre of post-cyberpunk has a lot of potential, perhaps even involving stories analogous to other sub-genres. Imagine, for example, a space opera, except instead of being set in space, it's set in a vast sea in the distant future, where the design elements of the sea-borne vessels and the marine life can often overlap...
I actually really regret watching black mirror, it just lingers as a dark spot i my mind. I think that if we want honesty, there is plenty to go around, but in entertainment this is just not for me at least. (Not meaning all honesty, but the total display of parade of tragedies) This does not make the show inherently bad, but I do think that for many people like myself, we just do not want or need to occupy our time with it. I don't find it challenging or developing in any way, it has just conjured grief and unease. \n\nI still loved your composition of the video, and I am a huge fan of your content. I just wanted to give you maybe a (less intellegent, less researched and shortly formulated) different view on it.
FUCK YES, I love this show. Thank you for this.
Fifteen Million merits, one of the greatest things written in decades. I love the fact when you start an eisode you dont know if it is going to be funny, happy, sad, set in the future, or the now. You dont even know a story. So few things are like that these days, most things you know at least somethign going in, so you prepare yourself for it, but not Black Mirror.
You should give a spoiler warning at first
Can you analyze Mr. Robot season 2 some time? It's one of the most psychological things I've ever seen and deeply felt
It's dark because it's a twisted reflection of us. I dunno, it's almost like a blackened mirror of a sort
Luther and shows like touchwood are much darker than blackmiroor in my opinion be cause blackmioror is a reboot of twilight zone it’s supposed to be creepy scary and thought provoking however it’s not truly as dark as other shows out there it’s more of a realistic take on how most humans would react in the instance of a bad event like the episode where the girl become a porn star to get out of her slave like lifestyle on a bicycle she isn’t evil she just gives in to temptation and who hasn’t done that this show is dark but their are darker shows out black mirror is creepy but it’s not a horror show
Any one started to think about our tech culture beside what it makes us feel? These shows were critically designed to bring conversation over our technological development with a critical eye. Beside all the great and convenient lives tech offers, how wrong can it also be used?
What’s the music that starts around 4:58? If someone could let me know I’d appreciate it
I've watched this channel rise to the cream of the crop. Really impressed man keep going.
Future?\nI thought it was about the here and now.
Evan - wondering if you've seen the reddit theory that San Junipeiro doesn't have a happy ending. It's pretty compelling: the gist is that they don't both accept the upload.
you're gonna carry that weight
I personally watch it because it reflects our own society through a distorted lens (a black mirror, you could say)
We don't like hearing about tragedies in real life.\n\nYou know that's a lie. People get amped up. News outlets go crazy with all the sensation. It's a circus. People LOVE tragedy, it's just faux paus and socially damaging to admit it.\n\nYou don't admit it because being a personality is how you eat, and how people perceive you determines how well you eat.
I'm sure Nerdwriter is not unaware of the irony of the content of this video and the sponsor of the video. \n\nI hope people can learn to go to the market and find their own ingredients. Perhaps think for themselves.
Very disappointing analysis. It's like the guy didn't capture any of the ethical implications in any of the episodes within black mirror
the add at the end was disgusting. promoting something that produces so much garbage in form of plastic bags for produce that needs no wrapping makes me sick
Spoiler alert for the following: Season 3 Episode 1,3,&5, Season 1 Episode 3 of Black Mirror as well as Oedipus.  Hopefully you’ve read it by now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think anyone is actually going to read this but if you would like an opposing viewpoint to this article, please continue. I’ll try to keep it brief, this is a youtube comment after all.\n\nSo I feel like you’re slightly off on your point. When you talk about Catharsis around the 1:10 mark you say that Black Mirror only has Catharsis when the characters in the story experience relief which happens in season 3 episode one and season 3 episode 6. If you look back at Oedipus for example you actually don’t have that experience, when Oedipus experiences his anagnorisis he has blinded himself and is banished from Thebes. My point is, to evoke Catharsis you don’t need a moment of relief or a happy ending, you need peripeteia where the protagonist’s fortune changes from good to bad and an anagnorisis where the protagonist has a shift from ignorance to knowledge, which Black Mirror has, for example the ending of “Shut up and Dance” when Kenny is caught by the police.\n\nAlso just to throw my hat into the ring about the meaning of Catharsis. If you take a look at Greek society when they embrace the idea of ideal forms. This part of Greek society did not believe in an afterlife so they believed the only way to achieve immortality was through being remembered which typically meant through wars. The idea of Catharsis was to purge emotions such as pity and fear from the audience so that they were not seen as weak and could become ideal men. \n\nAll of this being said I would assert that Black Mirror has a closer resemblance to the roman playwright Seneca as opposed to Aristotle. The first big difference between Seneca and Aristotle was that Seneca allowed violence to be displayed on stage. For example in his version of Oedipus when Jocasta realizes what has happened she rushes to the front of the stage, cuts open her uterus and bleeds out on stage as opposed to Aristotle having her hung off stage. As we have seen in several episodes throughout the series, they are not afraid of horrific displays of violence on screen, they even make reference to this in “Men Against Fire.” Seneca’s plays would also have moral harangue which is similar to season 3 episode 6 of Black Mirror where Bing gets his own show at the end of the episode where verbally assaults his audience about how they participate in the society they are all in. Also on an unrelated note, Seneca had a fascination with the super natural, much like Black Mirror's fascination with technological dystopias.
you should try the leftovers.\n\n\n\n\nso goddamn depressing..
Warning! Game of Thrones spoiler alert. Almost threw my phone at the wall when I saw it. I'm only on season 3 of G.O.T.
All people are asking for is a spoiler alert. No one is asking you to move a fucking mountain. Damnnit Evan. And I really liked you and your content but if this is how it's gonna be from now on, I will never watch a Nerd Writer vid ever. Unsubbed and disliked. Fucking asshole
Why would anyone wanna watch this?
This made me start watching it, and I love it soooo much ❤️ its awesome
How come you never made a video on Wild Tales (Relatos Salvajes)? Contrasting Black Mirror is a dark comedy delightful to watch
On the topic of television series you should definitely cover twin peaks
It's the kind of tragedy Dostoyevsky wrote - very human and very universal, while incredibly in tune with the darker potentialities of society and the world at the time of the writing. He predicted the terrors of Communism that befell Russia almost 30 years before Lenin with incredibly precision. \n\nWhat really screws with my mind about Black Mirror is that it is probably an accurate prediction of the future in certain aspects - and now things change much, much faster than in the late 19th century, so we can see the full-blown reality of some of the predictions the show makes extremely soon. \n\nIt taps into the depths of out psychology and I love it and fear its predictive power because of that.
its probably because its black
Can you PLEASE do a video on how women are portrayed and/or represented in movies? PLEASE
Why do we watch black mirror? Maybe it's not interested in catharsis. Sometimes there's this curiosity within us. To see these unseen tales. To experience this fresh dose of emotion maybe good or bad, Like to be carried on a Rollercoaster. Yes  we are prompted to think and recollect. But why do we watch black mirror... Sometimes it's that morbid curiosity we all have. Something I believe should be controlled. There's lot of good that some shows bring us but here in these tragedies if we just look for a story to tell at tables because its raw, its curious. Then that curiosity will lead you down the wrong road.
You think black mirror is just about entertainment through tragedy? Not mirroring our societal flaws? Human psychology that can be scary
that blue apron ad at the end was jarring as hell man. wtf
I hate black mirror! It's too too dark for me
Fifteen Million Merits was the second episode of the first season. You have it as the 6th in the 3rd
Book fans should be angry at how Robb Stark's story was in the show cause he never married for love in the book, he married for honor cause he was trying to be so much like his father to be honorable that it killed him
Idk how you guys see this as a spoiler for GoT. Everyone in that show dies anyways so it’s not that big of a spoiler
Make love to a pig? Dude, just say it. He had to fuck that pig. Don't say he made love to it. That's just weird.
I think this video approaches Black Mirror with the wrong paradigm, one of pleasure or aversion of it.\n\nI think Black Mirror is popular because it's a shining example of good science fiction: it makes you really think about the scenarios, their implications, their plausibility and their ethical aspects. It's a philosophically stimulating show, and that makes it an enjoyable show. There are very few like it, the original Star Trek being slightly similar although a lot more optimistic.
I do view it because of the morality of it all, though. It's a slice of life, and let's me see how the ethics of all the characters interact. I get to think of who was the most right or the least wrong. It's like Aesop's Fables, to a degree, only with a more general focus.
This video only talks about what happens (Tragedy). Black Mirror is about how it happens.
what is your mate's name? Did you say Lasette?  I'm buggin out because my girlfriend's name is Lasett, sounds like its pronounced the same!
Great vid but I couldn’t enjoy it after Game of Thrones was spoiled
Why do so many people love nosedive it's literally just meow meow beans but worse.
meh black mirror feels too predictable to be interesting for longer than an episode or two (gee wow I wonder how THIS episode goes wrong! almost every time), at least 15 million merits had an interesting enough world but that's where the show peaked for me. yeesh, already heading downhill from the second episode lol\nsan junipero's okay but not mindblowing in the slightest
This video came out right as I finished the series, and it made me clearly aware of why I felt so connected to it. Thank you for this piece, well done.
Brilliant video, however, t's interesting you analyse a show which ridicules themes like invasive advertisement and then force an advertisement at the end of the video. Hypocrite.
I don't think the false catharsis is the main reason people watch the show; I watch BM because it creates a new reality every time, and creates a story in that reality. The reality is eccentric relative to ours, and the story is eccentric relative to that reality. So it comes off really mind blowing or interesting in the end, if you are less affected by the sadness stuff
I would argue that the genius of Black Mirror is that it rips away humanity's power over itself, depriving us of the comforting lies we tell ourselves that it will all work out in the end regardless of how we choose to live, even despite our best efforts. It's draw comes from the deep gravity this truth has over us despite what we want to believe. This show is self-flagellation, despite our progress and best efforts of intellect and modernity, our humanity, when indulged, is our downfall.
hell yea i saw this was a trending topic and i am so keen to see your perspective THANKYOU
I LOVED BLACK MIRROR!!! I'm waiting for the next seasons !!!
Yooo, you didn’t have to show the red wedding clip, that was hard to watch lol
But where is season 4?
Probably why San Junipero and Nosedive are my least favourite episodes. I still prefer Nosedive which could've been so much darker, it really felt like a missed opportunity, imo.
This channel is among the best employments of my money. Seriously.
Please add some sort of warning to this video. This is potentially-triggering material. I only had a vague idea of Black Mirror's plot so to speak and found some clips extremely disturbing. Typically I love nerdwriter's videos, so I am disappointed.
Black Mirror is unlike any show I have ever watched and I think much like The Twilight Zone, it'll go down as one of the most creative and engaging shows in history and one that is unlike any other dystopian or anthology series. I loved your Passengers rearranged  video, this was a brilliant analysis!
Love this show and I can see all this really happening.
Man everyone makes these faces of tragedy (infinite reincarnations!)
*Makes video about Black Mirror*\n*Spoils three other shows in the process*
In many ways, its actually substantively closer to greek tragedy, in the way the later plays reflect the place of human endeavour in the face of a capricious god. In that way, it completes the causality of a lot of Greek tragedy (see: oedipus, the orestaia, and most works by Euripides), with out the clearfully defined resolution of the moral chorus, a framing device both in the twilight Zone and in early tragedy. Game of thrones provides causality through the logic of human folly and fate explicitly. Black mirror through the evidence of our powerlessness in the fac of the new, equally capricious, gods.
I love your channel, but if you’re going to be dropping spoilers of unrelated tv shows I’ve haven’t watched yet, I’m going to have to unsubscribe.

I know you probably thought you were being clever by incorporating spoilers involving scenes of tragedy without warnings, and thus robbing future viewers of catharsis, but, man...this episode really crossed a basic line of pop-cultural decency. I've been contributing to your Patreon for years, but this episode really blew it, man. I'm cancelling my per-video contribution effective immediately.
I recommend putting SPOILER ALERT at the beginning
Anyone else notice that the episodes of Black Mirror with the happiest endings are the ones set in an American society? San Junipero and Nosedive are, in my opinion, the least dark** episodes of the show, and they are the only ones set in North American populated societies. (Men Against Fire being the notable exception; while the soldiers are American, the location of combat is unknown.) \nCould it be a comment on British vs. American cultural perspectives in story telling? American television tends to favor happier, more positively fabricated endings; while British television majorly yields toward much darker, morbid endings with no ultimate silver lining.
DUDE! I was only on season 2 of GOT! SERIOUS SPOILER 3:34
Duuude I'm on season 3 you just spoiled me Game of thrones!!
Disliking because of unrelated show spoilers. Luckily I just finished breaking bad but I would’ve been pissed. Just put a warning, it’s not hard.
I'm gonna pretend I just did not see that Breaking Bad spoiler.. I'm finishing Season 4 and I just don't know if to watch it anymore. Ugh. I came here to see a Black Mirror analysis not a spoiler thread.
Black mirror is a show for stoner millennials to make them think they're smart.
I can't imagine how much fun this Dad must have been when he was younger, I have a feeling he liked getting into trouble. Haha. I Hope Nile realizes how fortunate he is to have someone like him around. \nI shouldn't even be supporting this channel, I'm from the US O_O, but I don't know if we have anyone as interesting to watch as Nile. Actually, I never looked to see if their was, I just happened upon this channel and stuck with it. \n'

Man like Niall defo watches Logan Paul
CONGRATS ON SIXTH PLACE !!
Theta bars routine was absolutely astonishing. When it was your dad and mum filing it was so funny but you dad deserves the name “THE YOUTUBE SENSATION” anyways Nile your my inspiration but sadly I’m not aloud to do gymnasts 🤸‍♂️sad times haha. I have a few questions to ask what’s your most difficult move to do? Has your mum done any gymnastics (if not maybe teach her)? Anyways cya later Nile
Wooooo go Niall ps I actually love your dad so much he’s hilarious
Honestly never cheered so much watching you compete today Nile! Smashed it!!! You've done yourself and the entire country so proud xx
anyone know how he did!??
Gymnastics Sport Good joke.
I swear I could hear your dad when I was watching the stream.
Nile, it is very interesting to watch you compete. You are very different during competitions. Quite intimidating to watch. I'm so used to seeing this sweet funny guy on YouTube and then during competitions, I watch you stare down the Pommel Horse like you're gonna murder it (who doesn't want to murder pommels tbh). Congrats on your sixth place finish in the AA. Incredible work!
You are so inspirational, I started watching you at the beginning of july and I got so motivated to stretch and work on my handsprings and tucks, and eating healthier and in a week I'm trying out for cheer team, wish me good luck, and keep up on the good work!
What’s the intro song?
Props your edit became  way  better in last time how did  you do  that ?
Do you have any footage of what happen to the floor?
Wait, I thought they were sisters. Now I'm conflicted.
Ice powers all the way! Duh?! Do u know how much of a drag 10 tonnes of hair would be?! Great video though!
I don't understand the Tarzan is Elsa/Anna's brother theory.\n\nKing Agnar didn't have the cool mustache that's starts from his nose and connects to his sideburns when he left...\nAnd even if we go with the theory that he and his wife stayed in Corona for Tarzan's birth and is now finally coming home after Tarzan is old enough...there is a simple fact that the eye colors and hair color of both parents don't match. \nTarzan's parents: dad had blue eyes and mom had green. \nHis dad's hair was also too dark and his mom was too...ginger. Elsa's mom was a brunette. \n\nWhile the theory is cool...we have to change the character's color scheme too much to fit said theory. \n\nBut Elsa, Anna and Rapunzel being cousins...completely plausible...and would be kinda cool. >.<
I feel like it makes more sense that Elsa and Repunzel  are sisters rather than Elsa and Anna. In terms of the movie, you could say that they look completely different from eachother because symbolism. However, in terms of genetics it's makes no sense for Elsa to have white blonde hair while having a ginger sister, a mum with brown hair and a dad with dirty blonde hair. In Repunzel you can make the argument that her hair is only blonde because of the golden flower (it's shown in the movie that if her hair is cut, the magic leaves and her hair goes to the colour her hair should of been genetically.) Even if I am right, the fact that Elsa has a weird ice upgrade doesn't make too much sense. :/
Wasn't the original theory that Elsa and Rapunzel were sisters and Elsa was adopted by Anna and here parents??
I would definitely chose Elsa's Powers as she is HOT!
Anna is fire and Elsa is ice. A song of ice and fire = frozen!
Please look up Film Theorist's Ana and Else not Real Sisters?!
3:12 - 3:17 there is an editing error; Ben says todays problem is.. twice, in different tones and with a jump cut between the two. Lil easter egg of a sort (:
Was your editor asleep? You were kinda repeating yourself
FROZEN IS NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE\nFROZEN IS NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE\nFROZEN IS NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE
Ben repeating the point he just made stood out to me; they don't usually do that. He introduces the topic with a picture or video or whatever, then we get a shot of his saying the same thing.
I thought Rosie was the Queen of Corona
You are so late.. Why is this on trending? 🤦🏽‍♀️
Way to steal matpat's film Theory video
Could you have chosen an older theory? It's literally been confirmed by the director. Like 2 years ago
At least you don't think they are sisters and Anna isn't related.
For temperatures, in mythology we could say that Anna and Elsa represent two opposing elemental forces. But they're not OPPOSITE forces, and in fact, all five elemental forces -- earth, air, fire, water, aether -- complete the power that consists of the universe. Now, Rapunzel seems like air to me. Her mother could be earth, mothers usually are. The sisters are fire and water. So who's aether? Which witch? (The one in the forest in Brave.)
If I lived in a Disney universe I'd want ice powers. If I could use the power in real life, healing hair.
Can we smush this with the game theorists theory and say that Elsa is repunzels sister and Agnar and Iduba adopted her, unaware of the power she got from her mother? It's just a different power than repunzel, but still power. Love this thought
Also the fact that elsa has cold powers and repunzel has warm glowing hair. Kinda like sun. Maybe their parents had powers like that too
The first time is saw Moana, I was with my best friend and we both saw the flower and we almost screamed
You guys need to do a collab with Matpat (film theory)
Did anyone else notice the editing was a little off today?
I would definitely have Ice powers. Elsa is my most favorite female character ever in any franchise on earth.
All about the ice powers...
I LOVE disney, but.. Ben? How old are you?
Even though I like this theory it cannot be, both Anna and Rapunzel are 18 in their respective movies,  since they exist in the same universe we know they are the same age.  So 3 years ago The king and queen of Arendel would not be headed to Rapunzel's and Flynn's wedding.  Three years Anna and Rapunzel would have been 15, and Rapunzel would still be living with mother Gothel.   I suppose they could be cousins, but the King and Queen's trip wasn't going to Corona.
These theories are pretty good but some are just plain weird. Next thing you know,someone's gonna say that Arianna(Dumbledore's sister) is the same person as Rapunzel's mother
All I can think about right now is how some people could claim that Elsa is an obscurial because her father forced the obscurus to form by making her conceal her power
OH MY GOD I SAW THE GOLDEN FLOWER YHE FIRST TIME I SAW MOANA AND I KNEW IT WAS FROM TANGLED AND AHHHHHH
In Beauty and the Beast 2017 how does the Enchantress' spell choose which servant is what object? Why are some objects alive and some objects aren't?  Some are obvious like Mrs. Potts and Plumette.  The footstool is a dog.  Why aren't the chairs or the hair brush alive?
magic! I choose magic I love MAGIC! #Hogwarts And Harry Potter Forever. if you didn't notice I'm a HUGE harry potter fan. : )
I'm gonna be sub-zero
I think Film Theory already did this like, a year ago...
Id choose ice powers. When i was like 7, I ave always been fascinating by ice powers and hydrokenisis
Film theory did this already
I'd chose ice powers if I was able to heal so I'm not sure
Dude, The Film Theorists By Matpat Already covered rapunzel being related
Ice powers. The cold never bothered me anyway!
OKAY GUYS SO LISTEN UP HERE BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO RANT. OKAY SO BASICALLY I WAS DOING MY THING AND I WAS GOIN' ON MY PHONE ON YOUTUBE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING NEW THAT I WANTED TO SEE, NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING CRAZY EXCITING. And then BOOM. I EXPLODED AND DUDE I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVERRRRRRRRRRRR TO SEE THIS THEORY. FOR. EV. ER. AND THEY FINALLY MADE IT! GUYS, THIS IS THE THEORY I FOUND APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS AGO (OH GOSH THAT'S... THAT'S... APPARENTLY THREE YEARS IS A THING NOW) THAT STARTED OFF EVERYTHING!!! EVERYTHING!!! Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but GUYS LISTEN UP IT WAS BECAUSE OF THIS THEORY THAT I HAD THE INSPIRATION TO WRITE A FROZEN AND TANGLED CROSSOVER FAN FICTION AND I WROTE TWO BOOK PARTS TO IT AND I WANNA WRITE A THIRD BUT I WROTE THE FIRST TWO BEFORE MY LIFE GOT CLOGGED UP WITH SCHOOLWORK. AND THIS! THIS MADE ME GROW AS THIS WRITER PERSON THINGY AND NOW I DO MORE WRITING THINGS THAN JUST FAN FICTION BECAUSE MY SCHOOL REQUIRES ME TOO BECAUSE MY SCHOOL IS PRETTY COOL AND MADE ME SO HAPPY AND GUYS I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO. CHOCOLATING. LONG. FOR SUPERCARLINBROTHERS TO MAKE THIS THEORY (and yes I have been watching them for a while and have not subscribed I am sorry I just haven't subscribed to anything at all I think and I dunno but I'm gonna subscribe now please do not kill me I am the only one causing deaths because you know I write things and having deaths in stories is cool because plot and actually there's a pretty emotional death in the second of my fan fiction book story thingies and I wanted people to cry when they read it so yeah ANYWAYS SORRY GUYS YEAH). THANK YOU SO MUCH. THESE MOVIES ARE QUITE POSSIBLY LEGIT MY FAVORITE EVER DISNEY MOVIES AND MAYBE MY FAVORITE MOVIES OF ANY COMPANY EVER (TANGLED IS HIGHER OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S JUST BETTER IN WAYS) AND I AM SO VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY HAPPY THAT YOU MADE THIS VIDEO AT LAST AND YEAH MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO READ MY STORY JUST A LITTLE SELF-PROMO HERE HAHA SORRY GUYS BUT THE FIRST ONE'S CALLED 'ICE MEETS FIRE' AND IT'S ON FANFICTION.NET AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY COOL I HOPE AFTER YOU GET PAST THE CRINGEY PARTS AND THE SECOND ONE IS WAY BETTER AND HAS DEATHS IN IT SO YEAH IT'S PRETTY COOL AND IF YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT ON FANFICTION.NET YOU CAN LET ME KNOW AND WE CAN BECOME BEST FRIENDS ON THERE. SO YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH, SUPERCARLINBROTHERS!!!!!!! YOU MADE MY DAY AND I AM A VERY VERY HAPPY PERSON RIGHT NOW I AM VERY EXCITED AND HAPPY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Ben, have you seen the Film Theorist video on this?
Wow, this is something completely and totally new and i can't believe someone hasn't figured this out earlier.
Ben! You HAVE to watch this! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhf9dekzyq4
You all should watch the game theorists video about rapunzel and frozen
I would want magic hair.
yes love the theory. you've tied together two disney princesses in with the disney queens, lets just find a way to tie in all the other princesses, it would be the ultimate disney theory\noh and i'd choose the magic healing hair, um it pretty much makes you immortal, but can you choose how young it makes you, cuz i'd wanna stay like an 8 year old.
You just figured that out...... Watch film theory he did it along time ago
Ice! Hair is annoying. I cut all mine off haha
I know this has already been a theory, but check out filmtheory !!!, I love your stuff!!!
Ice powers all the way.
I would want ice power instead of golden hair because with ice powers you could always freeze over the wound, and then heal it at an actual Hospital.
Can you do more cars theories and stuff please??
Just not today's problem my favorite line
Hey Brothers! I would love to see some more Marvel content from you guys! Specifically your opinions on The Winter Soldier (villain or victim) and theory’s around the MCU in general.
Film theorist all ready made this video... but did it better
Why does he keep repeating stuff?
M\nI would pick healing hair. I have several physical issues, and so does my dad and stepmom
Magic healing hair would be amazing.
Ariel and harry potter are related. He turned into a frog in hp 4
I would want ice powers, but not because I like frozen but because it would do much more than just heal people.
I would use my ice powers to heal people.\nBoom.
But that's just a theory, a FILM THEORY!! Thanks for watching \nIf you like this video and would like to see more in-depth analysis of film don't forget to like and subscribe
Ummm i thought we all knew this already? You are a little late to the parties
Dude... where have you been? This theory has been circulating since rapunzel and Flynn made a cameo in Frozen
If they're related then was all the porn i saw them in actually incest?? Idk how to feel right now...
Also because both of there children have magic powers
That Rapunzel, Anna and Elsa… and Tarzan are cousins.\n\n(I kept adding that even though I find that theory so unbelievable)
Love the theory. I always love theories about Disney characters being related to each other. Which kind of makes this a sad theory since if it is true, the part about Arianna travelling the world and finding the golden flower kind of disproves that theory about Hercules BEING the golden flower from Tangled.
in England the groom to the queen gets the title of a prince.
Theory idea- You know how Anna is supposed to represent the summer, Elsa for winter, Rapunzel for spring, and... Merida for the fall?? What IF (with Anna being a redhead) the family are descendants of Merida's family? They were introduced to magic as well. \nJust a fun thought :D

Go to film thory there ilrs
I LOVE YOUR INTRO
trending trending
Healing hair.
Ice powers
I would chooses healing
Correction: Anna, Elsa, Tarzan, AND THEN Repunzle are cousins.
Somehow Ben of House Carlin is cooler..
hooooooooooo
Woooooooooooo!!!! It's TRENDING!!!!
Do something on Ducktales
Anna and Elsa are sisters to Tarzan, cousins to Repunzel and I'm guessing next they'll be step-sisters to Aladdin, and Moana's half-cousins.
SISTERS NOT COUSINS COMFORMED ON FILM THEORY and cut Im not trying to be rude but elsa and rapunzel are twin sisters they both heal people they love in the end of the movie and the king and queen of arendell are trying to protect elsa from being kidnaped like rapuzel
Game Theory already did a very similar video to this about a year ago:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhf9dekzyq4
Do a theory on how Elsa got her powers and why
Who’s Eugene? I thought she got married to Flynn?
King Ben does have a pretty nice ring to it 😁
Film Theory did one on how Elsa and Rapunzel are sisters.
What about the note found near the body - WTF is the media suppressing this information?  They keep saying no suicide note or anything - yet clearly there is a note on a table right near the body!
Admiring the fact that it is fall and in Canada it's freezing but there you see he has his sleeves rolled up
were are the body cams of the SWAT TEAM when the breached the room???
When a cracker does something wrong, he was pushed to do it....if you're non white, no matter how innocent you are, you're in the wrong....
Media is either ignorant or complicit in the conspiracy. There were shots fired at the Belagio hotel over a mile away from Mandalay Bay. There were two people registered as being guests in that room !!!!!!
Cops told niggas to stay within the festival fences. Hm
I wonder if this happens in Denmark....
I don't understand why people want to hurt others life just because there not living an amazing life
My heart goes out to the shooter's family. They're the real victims in this shooting. If only the shooter had shot the fucking  redneck performer of the horrible music, I wouldn't have complained. It's funny how it's always white Americans that carry out innocent mass shootings.
Steve the shooter,  had 2 planes, I would like to see his flight records, flight paths, States and Countries he visited, petrol consumption, service maintenance recordes, who were his PASSENGERS ?? the passengers list. This would be in all aviation records. Perhaps he leased a plane overseas, this would be in global records, he would need to produce his licence, ID, PASSPORT, to lease any plane ABROAD, then there's the payment records to do all of the above, follow the money and his carbon footprint.
Are semi-auto guns cheap? is that why so many people have them?
Um, why an hour later after the security guard notified police?
There goes all the fake ass Russian bots arguments that he targeted country music because he was leftwing.
Good on those cops love it
Go to: Movie BREACH - THAN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
an hour later? Thought it was 10 minutes
Jesus is the second shooter !!!!  He shot himself to look like a victim ! And his buddy ran away
Is it necessary for George Stephanopoulos  to teach me how to subscribe on YouTube at the end of every single video?
shooter? i would call him a terrorist, oh wait, he's a white caucasian.
Thankful for all of the brave men and women who risked their lives and saved many. <3
An hour before they got to him!! Are you fucking kidding me!!!
this guy sure did his research.
Did he just say the correspondent's name is Matt Gunman?
False Flag does not mean nobody was hurt. False Flag means that the official narrative has nothing to do with the truth.
Inside Edition said he never checked into any. This all is insanely sad.
This is proof that Hillary was involved in the LV shootings, look at how poor of a turn out for her book sales.
Sense when did they start filming these tragedy's?
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for you? He had no criminal background but look he carried out a massacre!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLkruVqQLEM \nyou have to be REALLY, but REALLY stupid and retarded to think that there is only 1 weapon shooting at a time. 5:00
Now whitey knows how it feels to be shoot at for no apparent reason, like innocent Native Americans , Blacks and Mexicans have endured for many many moons!
Where is the hotel security camera footage?
HOW MANY TIMES IS THE AVERAGE DUMBED DOWN IDIOT AMERICAN GONNA FALL FOR THE SAME BULLSHIT TRICK. IF YOU BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL STORY YOU'RE NOT FIT TO WALK THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
100 round clips? those are 30 round clips. Only way for 100 rounds is in a drum.
Or they had multiple hotels in his name because they were shooting out of all of them! Quit lying MEDIA!!!!!!
Chicago Illinois was next Google it,
2:02 Just in case we suck at math... and common sense...
I hope he rots in hell for all eternity.
People tend to a build a wall when they have their own issues.
2:30\n\nWHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING IN ROOM 135\n\nhttps://www.cuteonly.ru/223394
alright so basically \nStephen Paddock wanted to kill himself, but since he was messed up he wantedto kill as amny people as posible with him\na clever plan. but not so clever if he kills himself
Wow ! Silly me!! I just got it !! It's like a dick extension having a gun and having a bigger gun is a bigger dildo!! It's only just occurred to me that this old dude probably can't get it up any more!! I mean look at all the younger spree shooters who did it because they couldn't get laid, well we know this dude had money and a girlfriend but he probably lost it cos he's now a limp dick!!\nYou see that is what you need to do now America, tell the truth about why a man would need a big gun , let alone 40 of them!! You need to let young kids know how deeply uncool it is to need a gun. What man needs a gun ? Over here in Blighty we would consider that being a pansy as tis old school to have a bloody fist fight and guess what? Nobody dies.
The sad thing is that these hotels have little to no security he could have done the same at any hotel bring all those weapons in ... also what did he have against country music instead of rappers? Hmmm....
There had to been two shooters. He couldn't have done it alone.
Thank the lord he didn't shoot up the rap show....

This are all fucken lies the media is reporting. Tell us the truth . Just let's us know the truth . He had help and let us know who help him .? Everything is fishy
Guns were placed previously in the room...the guy just walked in and got the keys at reception...inside job.
false flag perpetuated by the demonrat libtards to take away muh guns!
The conspiracy theorists are not the only ones u gotta watch out for now lol anyone can go nuts
Look for the photo released/leaked that show the dead lone wolf on the floor. \nThen take special note that there is a rifle on a bipod OVER his left leg. \nThey reported that he was killed on breech, then they said it was suicide, now they are back to killed on breech. \n\nLooking at his body position with the rifle over his left leg...... hmmmmmm>\n\nI hope you can find it, but the pic of his face shows he spit up a lot of blood, but you can see he was shot in the lower chest to stomach from the front. \n\nWith the rifles position and his final resting spot, that means he was shot by someone else standing in the room at the broken window. \nSWAT didn't enter the window and they did not have a sniper shooting into the room. \n\nFor all those who say the 4th floor muzzle flashes were the reflection of a strobe light, tell me how a moving cab wouldn't have fallen out of the reflective line of sight of that distant strobe reflection. \nNot to mention other camera angles showing the same muzzle flash. \n\nJust watch all the first shooting videos.....where the guy was still singing on stage. \nYou can hear shots and echo, but then you will hear overlapping fire. \n\nHead back to the pics in the room and look at the shot with his legs in the photo....top left of that photo is the window he was shooting from. \nThere aren't nearly enough empty casings on the ground for this to make since
He should've uploaded the videos to YouTube before he killed himself.
Who else flinched when they demonstrated the ak
WOW  Lone gunmen don't need several spots to shoot from,  Teams do.  Real deaths, real injuries, bad reporting.
What will be next step for USA government.
If we don't want this to happen anymore we shouldn't be creating more gun laws. We should just have metal detectors added to buildings. Going in and out. That way they can keep track of the firearms better. Concealed carry is ok. But you can't have someone stockpiling weapons in any building. If you bring a weapon in you can't bring another one in until your other one is out. Its called being smart and caring about what goes on.
Chicago people still being killed by gun men. No outrage there, the hypocrisy is real!
a sad moment in history
George Stephanopoulos is a little bitch, I remember he called this monster Mr Paddox fk him. Call him the killer or evil man, not mr you stupid ass news anchor. What a douche say what it is politically correct ass hole.
IT'S GOVERNMENT SETUP AND HE GOT FRAME FOR IT BLAHHH
what is that odd piece of furniture around 00:25 with giraffe print? strange, appears to have sections and cracked on the outside. anyone have an idea?

Cnn and the MsM are The real terrorists all the yellow journalism and all the worst things under the sun ! Americans are waking up to you traitors
More Deflecting LIES from the truth YUP NO ONE IS BELIEVING The MSM or LEO !
Inside job. Doesn’t make any sense
Quit looking for motives. Some people are just pure evil and want to kill.
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO DESTROY THE WHITE CHRISTIAN RACE IN AMERICA WITH ENDLESS MULTICULTURAL IMMIGRATION SO THEIR GIANT GLOBAL CORPORATE DONORS CAN EXPLOIT DESPERATE CHEAP IMMIGRANT LABOR TO MAKE EVEN MORE FUKING MONEY!
I wonder what those “fuck the Police“ people think about that when they need some one to save ther ass the police are ther when they don't need them they just talk 💩.
It's only a false flag when a white person does it but if you're not white you're a terrorist
That jackass modified his AR to fire as if it was a machine gun...

..Gathering people who wants to be a part of building a network of stable, fully self sustaining and self sufficient communities (a.k.a. life-boats for the coming social & environmental collapse).  Peaceful communities that are built upon foundation of : love, spirituality, mercy, generosity, tolerance, intelligent, and wisdom. If you are interested in becoming a part of this grass root efforts, I encourage your reply.\n\nThis Community ARK Project is looking for peaceful, patience, humble, and kind-hearted people who are awaken and aware of the coming social & environmental collapse; who want to roll up their sleeves and participate in preparatory efforts. One cannot pull someone out of a raging river standing on a muddy slippery slope. In order to pull someone out of the river, one must stand on a firm solid foundation. A fully self-sufficient community is that solid foundation, upon which we stand in order to rescue other less fortunate who will be affected by the collapsing environment.  If people are struggling to survive as the environment collapses, how can they help others?  People need fully self-sufficient communities to shelter and nourish them, in order for them to reach out and help others.\n\nWe are gathering people from all spectrum of professional background: engineers, scientists, architects, biologists, farmers, doctors, nurses, artists, etc. Both skilled and unskilled people. Those with knowledge will teach those who lack them. Those not in the know will listen and learn so they might in turn teach others in the community. We have spent 6 years researching technology that were designed to allow Mars colonies to thrive in a desolate environment. We are now planning on using those very same technology to prepare people for the coming environmental collapse. If you are interested in helping out, we could use the help to reach the ears of people who are awaken via social media, or you can read our blog titled Generalized Plan of Action for a list of positions you can volunteer for.\n\nWe are speaking to those of like mind who do not need convincing; in their hearts and in their thoughts, they recognize the catastrophe that lay ahead if our modern societies continue on their current path of promoting competition, strife, ignorance and scarcity. This Community ARK Project is lighting a beacon so that those with similar mind set will know that they are not alone in their thoughts and impulse; that there are others like them out there who desire to come together to pool our effort in order to extract ourselves and place ourselves on a different path.  One that promote cooperation, harmony, foresight, and a nurturing environment.
Notice the WHITE media keeps showing MANY pictures of the non-white Filipina who didn't even commit the crime, but the WHITE man who's the perpetuator has only 1-2 pictures, yes, mostly ONE picture of him with EYES CLOSED.\nNo doubt they are trying to WEAKEN the image of the WHITE barbaric man in the head of viewers. \nDirty white bastards strike again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The ignorance of the media regarding gun terminology is ridiculous. Sensationalized, uninformed garbage.
If it was not for that security guard (JESUS CAMPOS) the casualties would have been greater. The terrorist had to change his focus on the door and not the crowd. I truly believe the terrorist killed himself shortly after he shot at the security guard, believing the end was near. JESUS CAMPOS is a hero and should be recognized and rewarded for his efforts. He is a savior and truly earned his named that day.\n\nhttp://ussanews.com/News1/2017/10/05/hero-jesus-campos-mandalay-bay-unarmed-security-guard-who-got-shot-after-locating-stephen-paddock-before-cops-arrived/
Why the hell do they use a picture that someone likely toke when he was off guard, every time they show him on the media?
Mr. Paddock just wanted some shut eye.

Real news
The C.I.A is getting sloppy
1 on trending?
Flash hider??
It's only fake when a white person does the crime... gtfoh you sick bastards.
Don't worry folks, we will see the hotel security video as soon as they release a better video of what actually hit the Pentagon
How is someone who put this much planning and effort into killing hundreds of people not considered a terrorist...
The AR15 should be banned
There is no way that a 64yr old senior citizen with no military experience could plan and finance that attack alone
This is why we should be slow to judge others and ourselves.
Am I the only one here that actually prefers to be alone for an extended period of time?
We might be in different struggles but for anyone going through this I know for damn sure you dont hate people and just want to do good and do good for others dont make life's mistakes fool you because those mistakes speak louder in your head than any other insult people would say . For anyone going through any kind of self destructive depression I have a clear goal for you be selfless , the more you do to help others, the more you set aside your trials and failures, the more you have room for memories and moments you will enjoy life
Reminds me of we judge others on their actions, and judge ourselves on our intentions
Uhhhhh I know I'm odd... I have sex with dogs... that's pretty disgusting in everyone else's view points... but I find that eating animals out of enjoyment is disgusting... I could never eat pork or pig... I do eat chicken but I always feel sad and guilty while eating it for needed nourishment to help my skin disease.. :(
What a bunch of Garbage!
This describes me too  well
I feel lonely because I lost all my friends when they left to different colleges.
This explains why I'm honest and blunt with my character.\nMy character helps people be more comfortable being themselves around me.
This video gives points that are completely subjective. How does this shit get on trending? Who did you pay?
social media doesn’t help with this in modern times. we need to understand a lot of thoughts aren’t put into words, and everyone has felt negative emotions. you are not alone.
the sketch was kinda depressing :/
man, I don't know how you choose your topics, but please keep up what you're doing.\none of the best channels on youtube.
I have spent 5 years listening to the inner reality of women's lives. http://www.collectingconversations.com Our stories may differ but we are very similar.
Truly beautiful animations! I loved when the lead character turned off the light to reveal everyone else’s deep, neon mysteries.
Life every day is happy or sad thats your life you should choose to take one of this in your life be successful and dont forget me
Is it ok to think that we should act fake so we don't put others down or bore them? I feel like we are our own individuals and that we can choose how we want to feel, but a lot of people do not think that way and expect others to entertain them or serve their interest the way they want.
I feel lonely because I decided to ditch my toxic friends and ex-partner. Now I'm too busy turning my life around studying uni via correspondence in the small rural town I live in to make friends with people I have nothing in common with. So for now, until I meet other people passionate about Science, I am lonely.
Moral of the video. Don’t care what people think because we all go through the same inner battle we try to fight
I deeply and truly appreciate these videos and this narrator's work.
I'm lonely cuz most people are retards.
Can you do a Literature episode about Balzac?
I don't agree with this silly generational we are all ultimately the same, share the same experiences, the same thoughts and feelings. I talk to people lots and meet very few who have same or similar thoughts, feeling and experiences as me.
worship 1 GOD, \nVerily only with the remembrance of god do hearts find peace-Quran
ive learned i enjoy life a hell of a lot more on my own.  im happy being lonely!!
What a coincidence. I just watched a video from SciShow Psych on a very similar feeling. They called it imposter syndrome. It's a feeling of inadequacy in successful people and thinking their success was only based on luck and that other people deserve more admiration than they do. I think you mentioned it at one point in the video.
Birth we come alone. Death we leave alone.
I AM NOT LONELY! I FEEL SO ATTACKED BY THIS
Another pretentious video. We feel odd because life is fucking strange it's that simple.
Because we have no God.
I will have to rewatch that several times to really get the idea behind this animation. For now I can tell, these are some beautiful illustrations!
I feel like you guys are rehashing your old stuff
no because of society
because we are odd and alone
This is so accurately and beautifully expressed
Hello friends, have a great day, love you
This is why reading introspective literature is so important! This is reading Kafka, ladies and gentleman! Then you can easily imagine what others in you life are going through and how they are in the inside, which is very much like yourself, which is very comforting.
Really? But I use mINS reading and individualism. I simply don't care what people think and expose my true self as much as possible.
Well shit... looks like one of those solutions is hopeless for me... -_-
It's hard to make new friends when you have none because you forgot how.
Hi School of Life. Can you write an essay regarding gratification excesses found mostly on social media usage? And idenitfy newly adoptive practices of communication influenced by rapid tech advancements? Since you emphasize that well being is so important, I believe you ahould begin to study this behaviours.\nP.S Your videos always help me understand human weirdness. This is a positive thing, haha.
i’m so in love with this art
YES! I relate so much! Thanks SOL!!
I tend to not talk about some stuff like anime and video games (two things that are a big part of my life) with people I don't really know well just because there can be a negative connotation that comes with people who like that sort of thing. I've never been bullied or criticized for liking that stuff, in fact, all of my close friends are into at least one of those things. I'm just afraid of people thinking the wrong thing about me I guess.
Just told somebody how I'm still struggling with feeling lonely where I live and this video awaits me in my sub box. Impeccable timing once again.
That was some trumpy handshake right there...
So the person with a Macbook that's got Harry Potter stickers on it who's wearing a Normal People Scare Me shirt and whose hobbies are Netflix, food, and sleep is secretly quirky and different in the inside? I doubt it. People vary in terms of their tolerance/appreciation for strangeness.
You've got to love psychology. It opens a window to the things we can't understand about ourselves and it also let's us in on the minds of people around us. \n...Very enlightening.
*Is life repetitive?*\n\n\nIs life a pattern?\n\nPattern of lies no matter how you try to prove it’s not..?\n\nPatterns of *”types”* of people? Feelings? Thoughts?

Absolutely the best video you've made yet. This made so many thing click in my mind. Wow. Thank you.
AALIYAH MADE THIS FROM BEYOUND THE GRAVE........
Holy shit this just opened my mind
this video could've just been summed up with don't compare your behind the scenes with someone elses' highlight reel
Thanks School of Life, this video was timed well.
Tis is probably the best channel i found on YouTube. It truly speak loud and effectively .. thank you.
Could you do a vid on self-hatred? I experience it periodically. Like today.
I enjoy my loneliness a lot, but at times I feel I want to be honest and truthful to someone. Art helped me get through accepting and understanding myself. But I do not feel the cycle would be complete until I find the love or someone I can confide in. It's tough, art just feels like a temporary place holder that is slowly losing its long-lasting effect
This was awesome. This is what I'm feeling today and then I saw this video and felt drawn to it. Such an answer that I needed in this moment. Thank you God and universe for pointing me to this.
Holy shit people feel this way..?\n\nYeah no way this is representational. Ugh. Pop-science.
Thank you everyone working at The School of Life. These videos touch me just about every time, and this was felt even more personal. I've been watching your videos for so long but have never contributed. I've got to buy some of your books, to support the group and to hopefully grow a little bit more as a person. Any recommendation for the first book of yours I should get?
I think this video depicts a realistic answer to why we are lonely. But we keep looking for solutions on how to stop being lonely. Loneliness is a human thing, it's what makes us distressed but yet creative at the same time. I say the only answer to get rid of loneliness, is to indulge quite intensely into it, instead of pushing it away. It will always be there somewhere deep inside of us, nothing, nor a human being will ever subsitute our empty hole. I want to talk about how capitalism makes us even more lonely but that needs another entire thread for that.
Eh, I don't get lonely. Myself as company is the best company.
This was a major problem for me...thanks for pointing this out!
I'm feeling lonely because I had my period and I am not in good mood but if I was in good mood I will feel like I don't need anyone because lots of people are annoying
I’m always lonely even with people.....
This is me 100% I just need to experience love and a point of safety.
Why is this me
I kind of feel sorry for those out there that never got to experience growing up without cell phones, fb etc.. Life was way more connected then and sadly only a distant memory.. but like many on here are saying, look up, call someone, talk to a random person.. it just takes a little bit of effort and you will feel soo much better for it I promise!
My problem is that there are people that i truly love and that are important to me but i can't handle and i don't want their love because i think they don't see the full picture of who i am and so i feel like i shouldn't have their love because i'm not as good as they believe me to be? Is this normal or weird?😂 or does anybody feel the same?
Thank you for this
I feel lonely and odd because I'm lonely and odd.
Dear School of Life,\nPlease stop stalking your subscribers, you are always uploading videos exactly when we need it to the point where it gets a little eery.
Because Jesus isn't in their heart without him you'll feel empty. Triggered comments put below👇👇👊
you think youre cool i just watched this on mute so i could look at the pictures top that smh
The way he says sex makes me want to have sex
This video made me feel so relaxed for some reason
Meditate!
Thank you.
As french people, this title does not mean anything... I guess you wanted to say Pourquoi nous nous sentons SEULS et étranges
Lovely animation!
Beautiful.
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaasssseeeee subtitles in Spanisssshhhhh

Yeah this explains me
wow best video ever
Socha
Just be symmetric ;P

https://youtu.be/sveDWml3PHs
I have nobody.
No one likes me, especially in school. When I was doing math today,  we were told to check our work with others. I had no choice but to look around. Everyone had a partner but me, then I sat at my desk. I watched people that looked like they were heading towards me, but dodge me. Heading to the person behind me. at that point, I was in a disappointed state. I looked over my work, pretending to fix a big mistake I had made on my paper. But i had really made the big mistake of even thinking, someone cares about me.\n\nExcept for one girl, she has been talking to me since last year, filling me in on what I've missed on days I was absent. And talking to me about her day. I really appreciate what she is doing. I hope she won't stop, but my shyness may draw her away from me.. It really seeps through.\n\nWhat makes me sad, is that she has been the only one nice enough to talk to me, in 5 years. \n\nThat, is what I call, a miracle. \n\n\n\n😭
I guess I'm not as special as I thought. Might as well end it. 😔
Don’t do drugs and you will be fine
To be fair,  people you know could also know you better than yourself.
Jesus knows you completely and loves you unconditionally. Have a moment with Him and ask Him to live in your heart.
Pretend like it's Lucifer talking.
I just create a group where we can talk! https://www.facebook.com/groups/621711011551051/
it's not complete without kelsey
YB and Evan are two of my favourite Buzzfeed members! Just behind Shane and Ryan (Unsolved), Zach and Keith (Try Guys), and just ahead of Stephen and Andrew from worth it!
Damn, only in America 😂
I'm not assuming bc I wouldn't know- but I feel like YB may have an eating disorder bc she can eat so much (binges) but shes pretty skinny...?
Why am I watching this? This is literally a vegetarian's worst nightmare.
Do buzzfeed people only hang out with other buzzfeed people?
As a vegan, this is my worst nightmare
Evan is from heaven 😍
Just wondering if YB actually has hyperthyroidism... She eats a lot but is too skinny even if she says she exercises every day.
Buzzfeed is trying to fucking kill these 2. They always do the eating challenges
When the said 100X100 I thought it was like 10,000 so step it up buzzfeed
I wonder how many times they impregnated the cow that provided the feast, before they drove a steel piston through her skull.  Aren’t you glad that you’re on top of the food chain?  That animals don’t have an impulse to fear?
It looks like a caterpillar 🐛
At least hire someone who can actually eat not like these 2... wtf buzzfeed
since when do you put fucking gloves to eat burgers
There are cheaper ways to take your own life u know
I luv in and out...
As someone who is trying to calorie count, watching this hurts
What employees should we pick for this eating challenge. Literally the smallest people we can find.
At least the food didn’t go to waste.
Poop is going to be gigantic.
Replace the bun with rice and something something RiceGum is a phaggot.
Hell.\nI got the heart attack after watching this.
If you invited me it only would have took three people
100X100 African kids could have ate that instead of wasting it \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFucking Americans
This was actually disgusting to watch. Made me a tad sick to my stomach
the inn and out diabeties  challenge
Hahahaha they spent thousands of dollars to get him six packs and now making him do this. What is this, global warming to ice age?
Why does Evan have an accent? Was he born in Korea?
Matt stone would eat all that like it’s nothing
Wait this came out yesterday? Wow I was just wanting to see if anyone did it. What a coincidence.
How is YB so small. I love her btw
I haven't eaten In n Out in a *B* *R* *I* *C* *K*
This is what is wrong with the world
I have a husky too! And best dogs ever, but they have a ton of energy.
... Well, this is my 16\nI think i'm in love with her hahahah
The girl is a fucking savage!!!!
She always says things like Oh I don't know if I can do this and ends up eating the most in every video
I want in n out
I would have literally gained 20 lbs from what YB ate in one sitting. Life is so unfair.
What about kids in Africa
I wouldn't say that is a surprise. I worked for Panda Express. I knew several managers who made $100,000. It isn't super common but enough
did you know in and out burger dyes its meat?
You know what really grinds my gears? When they use the person who was featured in two fitness videos and that had  eat healthy for so long, And now their doing challenges like this. SMH 🤦‍♂️
YB can put down some food! YB!!!
Evan is so lucky for having YB and vice-versa
In n out is nasty
Way to get diabetes
6 figures for being a manager at IN N OUT?
2:27 \nEvan: HELP MEEEE\nYB: 😂
Meat is murder
In n Out is overrated. I  prefer Wendy's or Shake Shack any day over Inn n Out.
After 3 or 4 burgers I wouldn't be able to move ,these asians can eat !
YB is perfection. Evan's cool too
Jesus Christ yb you are the real boss dude!
there goes evan's abs
Who eats utensils on the burger?
Everyone: that is way too much!! \nMe: that looks quite um... Good. I say Breakfast and Lunch... Maybe Dinner.
how does she eat so much and so fast?
Everyone who gets into buzzfeed would get fat
If she's eats like that. You know what else she's good at eating.
i wish i could be like yb she loves eating but she has good body  😦😦
Its a good burger for a party, but not two people lmao
love these two,  expecially YB, seems so nice
How is this a challenge?
Evan is soo freaking HOT 🔥 🔥
heart attacks 24/7
Gloves??????
Best leftovers ever
they better be eating healthy for the rest of their lives
YB is a monster!! I wish i had her metabolism!!😅
I want to pipe her
i could eat this all my self
I can relate to YB. I eat more than my friends but I'm the thinness and i don't exercise ever.
I want in n out right now so badddddd bruvz!!
I'd need half a bottle of tequila for that.
Meanwhile, in Africa...
I ship them!!
is it possible?..
Both will take huge craps
Yb can chow down lmaoo
T

Ya need Matt Stonie.

Date already.

LOVE YOU GIRLS <3
Carlie has such a perfect nose \nI know that's random, but I notice it everytime lol.
Dark hard times make the amazing times even better :) life is about learning, sometimes we learn things we don’t want to but it’s worth it in the end.
One day I want to be this carefree
I absolutely needed this today because sometimes it's hard to remember that we won't always be at our worst... I love you ladies and thank you for having these chats with us. I feel like you three are the sisters i always longed for. \n\nAlso a Friday show that would be amazing: How to not lose yourself when becoming a parent/wife?
so glad this is back 😭💗
Welp. If Susan watches it then it must go to the trending page!
Cathal love ❤ all girls Cathal like you girl \nI a am little sissy girl mistress
I love Carlie's top where is it from ????
I'd love if there was a self-help video like this every week :)
Carlie! You have no idea what that did for me. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart .
Omg I literally cried I needed that thank u
I really liked the exercise Carly!
Ugh this is why I love you guys. ❤️
As I did the exercise with you girls I was so taken back by how differently I viewed my best self and worst self. How they almost seemed like completely different people. Thank you for this and for helping me reconcile my worst and best self. Self love is something I am working on too!
That was.... unexpectedly emotional! Jeez! From an overweight, suicidal college freshman to a happy wife, mom and fit triathlete. I've come a long way, and sometimes it's hard to recognize that through all the daily details!
I loved this exercise. It made me so incredibly emotional because I know my younger self would be so proud of who I am today. Made me want to go back and hug the little girl that thought things would never get better and just hold her and tell her it's all gonna be okay.
This exercise was interesting.  Because as I am  urrently at my lowest in self esteem right now. It felt good to hug my old fun self and have my fun self hug my new sad self. It's weird to say, but it made me feel like I was being a friend to my new self as well as my new self felt relief for having a friend to hug and admire.
Thank you Carlie! This is a life saver! You're the best!
In love with Carlie's top! 😍
Oh mom's view gals, I needed this more than you know right now.
Wow, it's been a year since I was at my worst. Suicidal, unmotivated, etc. I'm doing so much better now. People keep telling me that I look different, beautiful, and happier without even knowing my situation. Improved mental health shows on the outside too, I guess! What a great exercise!
Carle I did it with you and it was great. Thank you
Does anybody know the name of this exercise or who created it? cheers :)
Thank you this helped a lot! high school is such a struggle for me competition in seat placement in music , being a clumsy/awkward lab partner, mediocre grades, parents saying I'm a failure and other insecurities I have. I feel like if I pay attention to the good times all the bad times will gradually vanish away and I will become the person I see myself as in the future :) at one point last year I was considering suicide because of all the academic and social obstacles I've been going through. I hope I inspired someone today and that the bad times are what make us a better person today :)
Hey an idea for next Friday could be to update us on all of your kids and maybe bring some guest stars (the kids)
I'm not sure this would work for me. I can't imagine meeting myself during the darkest time, because I'm currently in the darkest time right now
Thank you!  This was so great!  I'm leading a bible study for women called Broken, and Im going to share this video as one of the exercises we do during our time together.
Dont mind me being immature but this remind me a TON of Joy & Sadness from Inside Out! 😍😍😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm going to try this. After Vegas incident, I dont feel like a good role model for my kidsk as i come undone. If I can stop and say the chances are small and find the best me that knows through prayer and what I've learned I can pull myself together. I'll try anything. :(
Nice exercise thanks for sharing! Sweet lady's.....💞😊
Carlie I'm obsessed with your shirt!!! Where did you get it?
Can you guys pleaseeeee do a nother challenge
Love this exercise! Thanks for sharing! What an awesome perspective!
This is beautiful!!!! Thank you!!!!!
I loved that exercise!
The BBQ at the back makes so much more sense! Last video it created a weird person shaped shadow :)
Thank you so much for this exercise. I haven't been feeling like my authentic self lately, and this has just made me step back and reminded me I'm a strong individual.
Thank you! Yes, the exercise was  helpful, I got teary eye.
That helped a lot thanks guys 😊 I looked at myself two years ago when I was self harming and hateting myself. Then I put the person who I am today with her. Today I am happy loved and pregnant with a baby boy. I had them hug each other and the one who was self harming  was so happy to see the me today and was happy to see me/herself pregnant.  God had a plan for me and today I finally realized what it was supposed to be.  Thanks again ☺❤
That was wonderful. The exercise; Carlie's explanations and advice were so on point and just so good. I will remember this, use it, and share it. Thank you.
So simple but so effective. I cried a little just thinking about who I used to be and how far I came.
I don't know if I can be my best again, but ill try my best. Thank you ladies
Amazing. Made me cry when I did this. But in a good way. Thank you so much 💕
I think it’s so important for people to realize that you can be at your highest and lowest in different seasons of your life multiple times. Don’t forget and try to bury your lowest self, embrace it. It is what makes the highest times in our lives that much more blessed. It’s what makes the experiences in our lives worthwhile. Especially the hard ones. It shapes us continuously. If you stifle your pain and suffering, you won’t ever truly be able to experience and attain self love.
I cried. I seriously cried. I loved this exercise
Love you all ❤️💛💚💙💜
so love you guys!!
Definitely got teary eyed through that <3 thanks mums!
Selp helf
needed thay Thanks Moms!!!
Love this exercise!!
Kayla, you’re wonderful! 💕
I loved this soo much!
It would be fun to have moms on the loose again! Especially for The Friday Show🤗
When are shaytards back missed them so much ❤️
Wish you guys would talk about body positivity more.
these are the videos that make me wish youtube had a 3x or 4x speed setting
what is the brand of pants that colette is wearing? i want a pair!!!!
this is actually very therapeutic. i'm a master of clinical social work student right now and honestly might bring this technique to my class and see if it would be good to do in a therapy session. thanks ladies! 😘
I lost a friend that meant a lot to me due to suicide,he's friend committed a crime but the loyal friend he is took the rat for him... was in prison and decided to hang himself...It kills me everyday thinking I want be able to see him breath again..He always told me no matter what you do in life, do not  cry because he didn't like people being upset. I am so upset it had to end this was...please give me some advice im very upset and dont feel right. For those that lost someone that means alot to you i will always wish the best for you and your family...HOPE SOMETHING GOOD OCCURS IN MY LIFE\n\nFROM an upset teenager  X
More exercises like this but invite a psychologist 😚👠👏
This is too much 😢😩😭😔
That exercise was amazing! ❤️❤️
Maybe you can talk about how you would handle a teenager who wants there way. An who makes you feel guilty when you can't give them what they want like everyone else.
After losing my father & then losing my sister (who was my best friend) bc of greed on her part from my fathers house and belongings it's sad to not have someone to talk to. I also moved back to a small town by myself and going through all of these hardships all on my own has been very hard on me. \n\nThank you for this Carlie! I see myself as a bigger better person in the future and knowing that I just have to push myself and be my biggest supporter. I want my kids to be in a better place and the only way we can get there is ME! \n\nAll the love ❤️
That was totally awesome. Thank you ladies
Love you guys so much 😻😘🎈♥️❤️😍
Thank you for this video. <3
This looks like an awesome exercise! Happy Friday ladies, hope you have a great weekend!! 😊
Loved this, very good reminder to know that if a person wants something bad enough, they can rise up and get the strength to do it and overcome, but the Big thing you missed mentioning, the major source lacking is how Jesus is the source, the one who actually gives a person the genuine Strength and peace they need to grow, a person can only do so much on their own, without Jesus they'll find themselves unhappy somewhere in their life cuz he's the only one who can heal their soul by becoming their peace. Leaving Jesus out, would be touching base on new age propaganda, gotta be prayerful in all things. I'm not speaking about church or religion I'm talking about the real spiritual battle that takes place daily in the mind and heart, (Satan vs self and Jesus) Jesus Himself was the one holding me up during my worse time, and it's Because of HIS encouragement, strength, and friendship/love, that i was  Strengthened to overcome alcoholism, drugs, severe depression and sucidial thoughts. I could never have done any of that all on my own. Love yas
I love it! Super short and simple yet so inspiring and motivating to help anyone get through a rough day or rough patch in their life. Thanks!
Amazing! I love this.
I needed this
Love this idea 😊👍🏻💕
BABY UPDATES!!!!!!
Stay natural beauty guys ,
Love this!

I loved this!!
Y’all are awesome! 🔥

Haha I love the nose prints on Carlie's windows. Can totally relate to that! 🐶🐶
Loved this!! Annnnd Colette's pants are super cute :) \n\nXOXOXO
Carlie you are excellent at this! Great exercise and really well delivered ✨💕
Love the exercise. I even shed a tear while doing the exercise.
Great first week of shows! I really enjoyed each day! 💗
Yay, motivational speaker Carlie! 😊 And her hippy dippy-ness! Lol 😄
I didn’t even know it until now, but I really really REALLY needed this today! xoxo 😘 ❤️
Thank you. I needed to see this video
I don't know why but when I closed my eyes, tears just streamed down my face as I remembered my hard times. But it helped as you kept talking. I wish I knew about doing stuff like this when I was in that place of sadness. I love you girls!💕
That was so nice. I cried to be honest. I've been going through a rough time and this helped. Thank you.
That made me cry when I did it!!  Beautiful exercise and a great reminder!
I love carlie! Love her voice
Carlie I love this I'm crying!!
Thanks for this Carlie, Ive had a hard week and to do this just now has made me happy and I know I can get through it. Great video! :)
I thought the middle girl was the mom from shaytards
I love you guys! ❤️ I think it would be so cool to one day to have a moms view podcast! I know when i tune into the moms view, it's nap time and I'm doing house chores and listening over my speaker.
I’m in a dark place at the moment. I am 22, just graduated. I don’t have a real place to call my “home”... I’m jumping from house to house and really struggling to find a job. I keep getting rejected over and over again. Yesterday, I was in pools of tears and I could see my boyfriend comforting me but struggling to see me so down. I’m sure I’ll come out of this.. but at the moment, every direction feels so lost and empty. I might try this exercise. Hopefully it will keep me some comfort and help me push forward. I’ll need it, because I’m barely holding on 😞
Has Carlie had plastic surgery or something because her skin looks so tight!
Life noggin, you should do a collab with Meet Arnold
Ive been wanting this video since i was 4
All insects can die except bees and butterflies
FLY DIE YOU LITTLE CREATURE
Just get rid of cockroaches, Mosquitos and flees/insects. I forgot to mention AND FLIES.
Humans will be free
Why can't we make robot bees that does the same thing?
fine can we just get rid of mosquitos then pleeeeeease
If all of the bugs are dead wouldnt games be better?
Kill the flies KILL THEM ALL
Me answering before the video even loads: nothing but happiness
Do one on what happens if all black people disappeared! SPOILERALERT: the world has 50% less crime and all ghettos are now habitable, and Africa isn't as stained.
What happen when you put every single microorganisms in just one places?
I don´t know if why would someone even consider eliminating all the bugs in the planet.\nIt common sense that bugs are on the planet for some reason.\nIt's like dog's poop. It is disgusting but it exits because dogs need to poop XD.
I want house flies and mosquitoes to go extinct tomorrow!!!!
Hey, why don't we keep the useful insects and kill the ones like mosquitoes, and others that spread malaria?
just kill those bees and wasps and hornets, those are all little fuckboys i dont give a shit if they dont rape flowers butterflies can do that
If all Bugs Died then I will be celebrating
Why was the farmer black? U racist?
Whenever i see insects\nlike cockroaches or lady bugs\ni cringe soo hard
I don't want all bugs died, I just want stupid f**** mosquito dead, this motherf***** exists even before prehistoric human civilization exists.
The only bugs I like are bees
How about we just kill all of the mosquitoes
Die you annoying pests and let me enjoy the outside.\nOh I am sorry I said that now.
The real answer is that gonta would be sad
It seems it wouldn’t be so bad if they all went splat
If every bug is killed yet we still managed to keep tye earth's ecosystem alive\n\nThen i would be the happiest living shit in the whole world considering my phobia of bugs (͡; ͜ʖ ͡;)(͡; ͜ʖ ͡;)
At 3:00, it should be insight instead of incite
Hard to take this video seriously when you don't know the difference between incite and insight!
I don't like killing things.
Watch my video Join the fight against cancer on my channel CJ Collins and see how to help CANCER panties
I love bugs. It makes me so sad how irrationally hated they are.
please answer if blind people can dream!! I hope everyone else agrees with me
Kill all insect except bees and worms that eat the body of human because they cary heavy problems
What about cockroaches, they don't do a damn thing
So what about cockroaches and mosquitoes
What would happen if bugs didn't exist? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. I would throw a party \n2. I would be soooooo happy \n3.i won't be scared to go  to my yard \n\nUnfortunately they are important 😒
My program or app would work like it suppose to  ;-)
1:29 as soon as this scene started, I thought of the Bee Movie
I don't think there would be any effects on nature if all the mosquitoes extinct
What would happen if there was no moon
we need no mosquitoes thus kill all mosquitoes you see
The only creature this world can do without is humans.
You're taller than your ANIMATOR?!? Wow. 😮
What if everything you searched up on the internet came true?\n\n\n\nMom : Have you done your homework?\nMe : Just a sec.\n*Searching up **_answer_** on google*\n*_Answer on ma homework_*\nOr you just search up fake cockroach and give it to your friend.
What happens if the earth was a 2 dimensional
*reading title* we die the end....i hate spiders
Im not scared of roaches, unless they fly around over my head
I hope Bill Gates finished that death ray for mosquitoes
I always think every little thing in this world has a purpose
How I feel right now \nhttps://youtu.be/JAYj2vjKmLo
But what if we would eradicate only the asshole ones?
Do can a human create wireless charger? or Is there anyone out in the universe? Pls do it :)
If all bugs died, everyone would be happy
i wnat the next video to be what happens if you ate dog food?
I’m all laws of aviation, a bee cannot fly
ahhhhh why do I watch this while  I am eating
*Hello channel, i love you, sub back lol*
I love your voice! You sound really cute : 3
Don't hate me for this but I don't like insects
Bugs are nothing but calamity for us sapiens! Nothing good comes from them. I say: Let's GET RID OF THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL!
Cool video Hey I’m 51 subscribers away from 1500 can you guys help me? I’ll dub back just comment
I have never been stunt by a wasp or a bee
Can't animals adapt without bugs??!?!
I think you meant insight instead of  incite.
What if mosquitos were dead wiped out population
I want the bee's to be alive. I want barry to stay...
Hey blocko I have an idea.\nHow does a new species start?\nIf you can't do that , I have another idea.\nWhat causes boredom?\nOr\nWhat happens when you drink your own blood?\nOr maybe...\nWhat do enzymes do in the human body?\nOoooor!\nWhy do we need to blink?
Misquitoes and flies should just die, flies and misquitoes carry most diseases and sometimes viruses, and I hate them, especially cockroaches take them out, rats and mice they have really no purpose of doing nothing
I want you to do, The difference between anxiety, and shyness.
I live in Florida. Aka mosquito haven
As a programmer I got exited when I read this title for some reason.
1:33 wow blocko beans
I would only remoov spiderz and mosquitos
the farmer looks like lugui
HAPPY TRENDING #47!!!!!
We need bees
Kill all cockroaches😁
We need TechRax to kill those damn cockroaches
1:07 BLACK LUIGI?!?!

#40 on trendin mai good boi xD
I think those insects are still cool but; what do cokroaches do to help the planet and mosquitos too? I think bees and maybe some other bugs that roam in trees and bugs that lay eggs in dead corpses/skeletons should still be alive. But cokroaches, centipedes, mosquitos, and all should die out/go extinct. Besides that what happenes to your body skeleton if you die? Will it always at least stay there for a couple of 100 of years or will it just....disappear somehow. Plzzzz make more videos I love all of them eventhough I just started watching them one or 2 days ago, I try to watch as much as posible but i cant just sit in front of my computer all day. It'll hurt my brain or ehmm... something like that, maybe you should make a video about what happenes when you spend all your day in front of your computer? Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee make another video and hopefully a suggestion from me PLZ.
can we talk about how i just got a f ree gift card from here! ➜ lythu.com/giftcardsgiveaway?749513672

GUYS did you also hear Im going on TOURRRR!!! Tickets for Melbourne are ON SALE NOW! There are very limited tickets left, Vip sold out in 5 minutes! https://michaelfinch.com.au - I will be doing a video soon talking more about it! xo
That Mecca primer is an EXACT dupe for the Becca backlight primer... I compared the two today and the Mecca one had just a teeeensy bit more pink pigment to it. But they pretty much look, perform, smell the same except one costs nearly $80 and the other costs $20. Ps they both have 30mls of product
That makeup look with that hair.. yas mama!👏
Giving me Katy Perry but 100x better!!!
You legit look like Pink the singer with that hair I can't deal
That little “HMM” after the pro glow concealer 😂😂😂
Could you do a full face first impressions on sports girl makeup. I really like watching your first impressions love you ❤️❤️
Yaaas the Lancôme has been my fave for years! It's the best!
Thank you I love your videos ❤️
Michael you are a gem 💎
Love the way you styled your hair looks really good on you babe❤😘
Hey Michael, just wondering if you preferred the top faced loose powder or the fit me one? I want to buy one and don't know which! Rock on love you!! ❤❤
hi michael i love you so much also please could u do a makeup look one side using the hits and the other side the miss' thank you xxxxxxxxx
Love this!!!! I'm going to Mecca now!!!
Love your hit or miss videos!! Keep them coming!!!
You look so good Michael 😍
Looking good girl.   ....But I really hate these YT vids that are just basically adverts for cosmetic companies.
fucking living for your honesty with these products, it's so helpful
So much shit Aussies cant buy... story of our lives 😐
You can buy physicians formula at Priceline in chermside ✌🏼

Wats On Ur Lips 💋
what lipstick are you wearing?
I feel like I am the only person in the entire world who HATES real techniques brushes! I wanted to like them so bad but they just leave my makeup looking wierd.
Hell yes with that physicians formula contour palette. I use the middle shade as well and its the first thing I have used that completely mimics an actual shadow on my face. And for $14.99 you can't beat it.
Im in the UK and I have used those grapefruit wipes.. oh my they stung like a bitch! Never again! Great video as always :)
ok but why does he look exactly like my mom if she had blond hair and makeup skills?
I don't like it, I fucking hate it. CYA! Holy shit I died 😂😂
The neutrogena facial wipe are only met for your face on the back of the packaging it says not to use around eyes.
I miss your silver hair doll!!!
Why in the hell do u not have 1mil
love the lesbian look
I feel like so many beauty channels shy away from saying negative things about the brand TARTE and I appreciate how honest you are about why you didnt like the product... (i.e. not just bashing a brand or product but giving a reason behind it so we as consumers can see if the product might not be a good purchase for us!) Sending love from the U S of A lol
The burning with the makeup remover wipes happened to me too!
' I don't like it, I fucking hate it, move on, cya ' 😂😂😂😂
Yes i want to see more hits and miss!!
 I dont like it, i fuckin hate it, move on, cyyyaa  😂😂💀 when I tell you I laughed way too hard
I always love seeing these kinds of videos, please do more like this!
Your hair looks amazing in this !
I love your fucking hair😍💋
Any other youtubers wanna support each other? Comment if you do!💕
Omg!!!! Please please please please please please please please please do some tutorials using the Sephora warm pro palette....it’s soooooo beautiful!
Your makeup is stunning. Love the eyes.
watching you daily is a MUST qqqq
You're the definition of seductive, don't fuck with me, I own fall, look. 😍
Every time I watch a tutorial or a video and someone says that the L'Oréal pro glow concealer burns their under eyes.. I'm like WHY DOES THAT NOT HAPPEN TO ME. It's literally my fave, I wear it everyday mixed with tarte shape tape ( the glowy concealer helps hydrate my undereyes while the shape tape provides the coverage I need) I WISH IT WORKED FOR U BC WE BOTH LOVE SHAPE TAPE AND I KNOW YOUD LOVE TO MIX THEM
What's the shimmer on your eyes? 😍😍❤️
I love your videos. I've had an awful day dealing with homophobic people making fun of me at school and your videos make me smile and forget all about the bullying.
I fucking love you and your honesty. ROCK ON
Michael i saw the loose Maybeline powder in Coles tonight :)
Your eyes are so beautiful
You look like pink today I love it
I love how your outfit and backdrop match the colours of Mecca Max branding hahahahahaha

I love your channel Michael your the best and such a hero to me!

No sabia que la paty maldonado era youtuber
Did anyone else see on shani's channel where she tried the Natasha palette and called Michael and they were talking about the shit quality aha lol makes more sense now Q
You are 100% giving me Great Aunty Louise vibes. Like the cool Aunty that travels heaps and always brings you back a gift, and drinks wine out of a water bottle at the gym, and says things like ‘diamonds are like dicks... only good if they’re big.’ Rock on dal
I totes agree with that crappy concealer. Just imagine what the poor animals that l'oreal test on with that crappy concealer go through, if it burns our under-eyes!\n :'-(\n L'oreal are not cruelty free - WTF? \nYou are a hoot MF - you say it how it is- no bs. I enjoy your vids and like your new haircut, softens your face and makes your eyes pop even more! :-):-)

Omg i just find you guys like a day are two ago and I live each video and song OMG
That's Scotts actual car in the beginning. I seen him in it after a concert before.
sCOTT RICHARD HOYING OMFG ARE U KIDDING ME
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You killed me, guys. Hope you're happy now. Can't stop watching thiiis!!! <3 <3 <3
This is the best song and best video out of all you released! love it! The thumnbail though isn't encouraging people to click I think there could've been a better one
But Why Can I only hear mitch sing? Sorry but i want to hear scotts Voice equally.
Mitch I do love you babe. But please get that wurm of your lip! 😂
Shave that disgusting mustache. It doesn’t suit you at all.
WE LOVE MITCH BUT WHERE’S SCOTTIE I CAN BARELY HEAR HIM EXCEPT FOR THE CHORUS AND I DONT THINK HES SINGING MUCH ELSE
is it just me or do scott's vocals on this track make up like 2% of the song?????
Over produced, under talented pop garbage. What's new?
There are no words for how obsessed I am with this album. Can’t wait for a video for GUY.exe 😉
i felt all kinds of weird
I haven't been able to stop watching this!!
This dude trying so hard to be Freddie Mercury lmao
What the fuck this is so good girl
MY FAVORITE SONG IS NEXT!!! OMG. I'M READY FOR GOODBYE FROM LONELY!!!
In all the songs all I hear is Mitch. They should try some solos
Years from now (months from now? weeks from now?) Mitch is going to look back at that mustache and there will be regrets. I feel like this entire video was a thirst trap for scomiche fans to fall down into and drown. XD
This is one of my favourite video because you see the soft side of Mitch Scott you nee to stop hunting Mitch head lol❤️❤️❤️❤️
Round of applause for their creative team, because damn this was well done - everyone behind the filming and conception of this video should be very proud!!
Mitch and Scott are always so good looking in these music videos..
I've replayed this song over 10,000 times already 😍
First off, damn Scott. But why are y'all doing this to us?!? UGH!
I haven't wanted a gay man this much since Matt Bomer hit the screen in Magic Mike... Damn, Scott!
These two have so much chemistry and it's ripping out my scomiche heart
Mitch and his acting is goalzzzzzz 😍😍😍 someone give him the damn Oscar ❤️❤️❤️
all these videos are fire!
*i don't really get this video,  can someone explain?*
this was my favorite song on the album and my FAVORITE VIDEO I'M SHOOK.
Mitch giving us Freddie Mercury vibes with the mustache and I'm not mad about it
SCOTT IS  SERVING LOOKS I'M CRYING UGH\nMITCH IS FUHKING PERFECT HERE HELP ME
Okay this is so freaking weird cuz they're always like haha scomiche but we're best friends and now Mitch is legit all over Scott like omg idk what to do 😂😂
THIS IS A BOP
Mad Vid! Loved this song from the first time i heard it. Been soo looking forward to this video! MAAAAAD!
Laganja voice: This. Is. Too. Fucking. Much.
Y'all why are they teasing us, why they teasing our schomiche' addiction like this !! Quit play with me my Queens  my poor little heart can't take this!😱😍😍😍💀💀💀❤❤💓💓💗💗👍😄😄
I'm always shook after a Superfruit video
STOP PLAYING WITH MY EMOTIONS
The guy leaning against the car smoking a cigarette in leather, as Mitch walks past and later walks through the back of the scene in the bar,  came up with the video concept. If it upsets you, blame him.
i think this'll be on repeat for about 3 more months for me??
Future Friends or Future Lovers?? You guys keep making us confused
mitch's facial hair is growing on me
Jesus Christ when did Scott become so hot 😫😫❤❤❤
Will you guys hurry up  and get together already?! Love the video and can't wait for more!
All of this is perfect and I'm crying
I know...Scömìche is hard to deny
MITCH YOU KILLED IT BUT THEN AGAIN WHEN DO YOU STOP KILLING IT!!!
one of my favorites so far!
Daddy Mitch is the bees knees
To those of you pressed over Mitch singing lead:\n\nA. They obviously intended for the song to be this way. On most of the EP they sing together, so there's a reason why they put Mitch in the forefront.\nB. They share leads, just like in Pentatonix.\n\nWhy y'all acting brand new??? lmao
Great vocals aside, this is some really great acting by Mitch.
Scott is giving me Making A Murderer vibes tbh...
I'm getting real strong Freddie Mercury vibes with mitch's mustache, hair, and fit
put this shit on the radio huntyeeeee
Scott is serving LOOKS in this video. SLAY QUEEN
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING WITH US BUT SHIT THIS MADE MY HEART SQUEAL
bmrebdfmkldf,lv,lbpoa;l      8O   8-)    whyyy can i only like this once\n\nthis is... so blasted PASSIONATE.  I know they only dated a long time ago, but the fires in those eyes are *burning*. If you've got a friend who scoffs that gay men are all one-night stands and casual, show them this...\n\n--Dave, feeling more intensely just from watching. thanks, you two!
There are Scomiche shippers who are awesome and nice because Scomiche is adorable. And then there are the delusional people who think Scott and Mitch are actually secretly in love and dating that are the cancer of the Superfruit fandom tbh.
WOW so proud of you both #25 on trending!!! Been with you since the beginning and loving this new music so much
omg they are both so hot
Do you have behind the scenes?
these music videos give me life !! look forward every week to them :))
This song is so real and relates so much to my personal life. Thank you guys so much for creating a song which really resonates with me. I love this and the rest of your album! Your hard work really shows❤️💞
So good. I looove that they release so many music videos.
All these comments about scomiche got me so excited and i havent even started the video yet
I almost cried. I was watching this like 😭
well there goes my lil schomiche heart.
Recommended for you

Mitch is going bald 😫😫😫😫😫
Man i need a strory mode between Ryu and Akuma!!\n2 V triggers \nNew stages\nNew characters\nBonus stages\nArcade mode\nExtra battle mode\nCAPCOM YOU ROCK!!
Are characters gonna be free too?
I can't believe it's been 30 years for this franchise
If I buy this version, will my christmas Juri dlc transfer
We were sold the beta version, so MVCI I will wait for the free update and not buy DLC
This is what Street Fighter wanted, Dhalsim's brother Dhalsim said paint.
Just one question.I have season 1 pass but not season 2,will this effect me if i cant get it for a free update?.i got season 1 pass on day one of release with the collectors edition.
The update it's free, but the season 1 and 2 characters not. Right?
It's obvious that all of those dislikes are from people who didn't buy the game.
still feels incomplete if you ask me
Whos coming for season 3 tell us Capcom
So, the DLC characters will become free?
*Phone rings and Sagat answers\nSagat: What? \nCapcom: We aren't doing too well.\nSagat: .....on my way
Nice only 2 more years for ultra sfv
There's a misconception that's every is free. IT'S NOT.  For the people that bought the original SF5, you still have to pay for the season 1 and 2 DLC characters....that's not included in this update for you guys
It's about darn time we got a arcade mode for this game! Good work, Capcom 👍
Sad no new critical arts are being added
finally, evil Ryu is here to stay
The game is finally complete ? Hype boyz
Meh.. Gonna wait for the ULTRA HYPER CHAMPIONSHIP TOURNAMENT SECOND IMPACT RAINBOW EDITION. With even more characters, even more stages and even more modes. It's gona be glorious.
I find this cause literally about a day to a few hours ago Max was talking about Capcom coming up with an apology for street fighter 5 and MvC Infinite... seems they're apologizing on one front.
battle damage and evil ryu hinted?
Ryu with red eyes? Hmmmm Ryu 2nd V-Trigger is Evil form I hope similar to Necali with infinite time!
thx, sold it like a year ago.
I have a Xbox.
Remember the SFV will not have the same shit treatment as sf4/ssf4/usf4? ... look at this
Ehh should have released a complete package in the first place
HOPESTAR OF CAPCOM\nGIVE ME THE FAME, THE MONEY, THE GLORY OF ARCADE EDITION
Except I as a day one player still have to grind endlessly to unlock all characters(or cave and pay up) while Arcade buyers get a code to unlock them right away. One step forward 2 steps back seems to be par for the course with Capcom these days.
i love street fighter
Nice games almost out of beta
Best fighting game e ver!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well I'm guessing I'm head to the arcade, cause tk7 arcade ass I'm huge tekken fan myself but come OK harada just 5 matches tk6 arcade was a lot better but he well learned, I bet sense ono put arcade in it harada going to compete well sure as hell love competition 
If the leaks are true, people who buy this will actually get bamboozled because they'll have to grind Fight Money to unlock the DLC characters instead of having them right away, a grind which of course (Capcom being Capcom) can be dodged by just buying the currency directly.
Yay another beta game being sold for $60
Hey look, more content that should've been a launch. Why are we excited again? Because it's free?
wait they're not making an xbox one version..........................\n.................,............................,\nFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
This game has been out for almost 2 years. Like it's great that it's getting a update, but street fighter 4 was a better game.
Too fucking late, this turd died a year ago and still stinks up your fan trust Capcom.
Ok, I think I get it. So my $40 that I spent when it came out doesn't get me s1 and s2 characters. But if I had waited two years, my $40 would get me s1 and s2 characters. But at least everything else is free.
Do i see graphics Update Textures & no Polygons? \nNow that something i need to buy SF5 with all DLCs & extra contents
there's more,  SUPER Street Fighter V: ULTIMATE NEW CHALLENGER Edition
Ok cool now im going buy street fighter i figured I would wait till this came out
If they put a Tekken character in....\n\n\n\n\nThen I'm all ears Capcom.
I know that it's a free dlc for people who own the game, but are we all gonna forget about capcom saying that they won't be making new physical versions of the game? This is the first step guys, ultra sfv will be a thing, and don't be surprised if they charge for that one.
Judging by the description, this wasn’t clickbait, the subscriptions were also obvious.
SF 5 arcade mode 😱😱,oh its true ,its dam true
I like that the  WHOLE fight  between  Ryu  and Akuma ..happens...  inside  Ryu's  head   as  HE MEDDITATES
I'm just curious to know who will they pick to add to the roster, Sean? Sagat? Fei-Long? Oro? Necro? maybe Gill?
No way I'm buying this shit
idiots, another $20 season pass is coming. this is just a way for Capcom to keep you paying $60+ total for a game that should have released with all the content from day one
Is this coming to arcades?
because you need it..
Oh boy, it's leaving early access!
You mean we've been playing the beta version all this time?
Damn \nNow i should cell my sf5
Will there be free updates in the future? For example will we be getting free characters
Even the trailer feels 'arca-dey'? Me like!
Will grab it on PC for sure. Sad to see that this updated version of the game is still not going to be pushed out on the Xbox One with the Xbox One X just around the corner. Game will fall behind other fighting games due to that. A lot of money being lost with that decision.
Please make it where the character select screen comes up when we are playing online matches.
At first I was like naaaaah but then it was all FREE UPDATE AND I WENT ALL *HELL YEAH*
Finally the full game that should have been realeased 2 years ago.
I need more than this weak trailer if you want to compete with DBZ.
too little to late capcom...
It's a *completely free* Update of a game that cost 18.99-$20 max in stores.\nTake that damn dislike off the video, Capcom did okay with this one.
GOT DAMMIT CAPCOM, YOU GUYS ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO GET US BACK HYPE. YOU GUYS MOLDED MY CHILDHOOD. YOU GUYS ARE SO DOPE. THIS TRAILER BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES IM FREAKIN HYPE. THANK YOU CAPCOM. I PLAY ARENA FOOTBALL BUT DONT LIKE MADDEN MORE THAN MY FIGHTING GAMES. STREET FIGHTER ALL DAY BABY. ✊💯
*meh✅🙄*
When's Sakura?
Getting Tekken vibes from this
I have Xbox 😭😭😭😭
EVIL RYUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
cant wait
Too little too late
Meu Deus ♥ ♥ ♥.
plz dont fuck this up
Too late Capcom....too damn late
BOUT DAMN TIME, GOOD JOB CAPCOM
evil ryu bitches
I want oni...
Still no Joudan Sokutogeri for Ryu smh
haters gonna hate hate hate hate im just gonna play play play
Far too little\nFar too late

FUCKING GARBAGE. LET XBOX PLAY STREET FIGHTER !!!!!!!
新しいVトリガーくるのか！
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
0:32
I switched to tekken 7
Little bit too late
About fucken time
I knew it.....it begins......
Damn January?
I am gay
.... but there is no arcade cabinet
2 vtrigger are good but you are late Capcom more hype please you need to work seriously on your game ...maybe you need to try for  this game on 2v2 ...(just try it  :) ) not like sfxt but like Capcom fighting jam !!! believe me try it on the next beta with more dlc
Are we getting the S1 & S2 characters free? I have sfv since day one
Anyone remind me what was the point of Necali?
You need to pay for a arcade mode shit
When such videos come, I always think: I'm up to date. And then over half of the products are new to me... 😅😀
In case you plan to breastfeed you are also not supposed to used retinol when nursing :(
I love Tartelette palette 🎨 so stunning. Very similar colours to Too Faced Chocolate 🍫 palette👌🏻
The Tartlette Toasted Palette is a must for christmas gifts. Loving the Paris book also....such an amazing  idea.  Is there one for London also? That would make a great gift as well.  Thanks for sharing your New in Beauty with us!

Your under eye concealer has looked very cakey in your last few videos - what is it? 😳
Clinique skincare is a hit IF you find the right product for your skin type. I have super dry skin (not dehydrated) and Moisture Surge Intense Skin Fortifying Hydrator for a moisturizer and All About Eyes Rich or Repairwear Anti-Gravity Eye Lift Cream for the eye area are my favorite skincare products that I've tried from the brand. I like the Dermalogica balm cleanser 10x more than Clinique's since it's in a tube and it doesn't make my vision insanely blurry like Clinique's does when I take off my eye makeup. There have been some definite misses in Clinique for me as well but the Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief is my ride or die moisturizer for when my skin is at its absolute driest and tightest so I would highly suggest that if you have dry/dry combo/very dry skin.
have been expecting for this video for so long!!! love your new launches video Fleur!
What lipstick are you wearing?
Thanks for posting Paty InStyle-Decor Luxury Lifestyle http://instyle-decor.com Beverly Hills

Ahhh I love your reviews! You’re quick, honest and hilarious. Excited about the ouai spray and that toasted palette- I love tarte.
Did you know the Estee box is sold out?
Could we have a best candles / Reed diffusers video. Not the Xmas candles, just a general one. Thanks
You look great in this video Fleur!!! Thanks for bringing me up to date! Lancome stick foundation seems great! Would love a more thorough review on it!
Aw, the beauty box isn't sold in the US, but all the other Estee Lauder companies pink products are :(
Remember when trying these new products out Fleur, that you are taking prenatal vitamins which are full of so much nourishment. That can contribute to your hair being so wonderful right now. Happened to me darn it.
I’m not a girl but I wear makeup and I like acting like a girl! Awesome video and I love the tarte palette!
Shut up Zoe’s friend.
That Tarte palette looks so frickin' amazing! Please do a tutorial on it x x
Hi Fleur! Since it's breast cancer awareness month, I would really love to see what you think of MÊME cosmetics, which are supposed to be formulated for women who are fighting cancer!
The Estée Lauder box is still in stock on the Clinique website!
Wow I want to try all of it! And you know me and my obsession with Tarte! ❤️Lol 😆
This is my favorite series of yours!
Always love these videos! Where are your earings from Fleur? They're lovely
your voice is the best i have ever listened to :-)
I was so happy when I discovered the Ordinary! I cannot afford fancy serums but I swear the Ordinary serums have seriously changed my skin!
Gutted to have missed out on that Breast Cancer box!!
I have yet to try The Ordinary, but the serums look promising. These overview videos are really so helpful!
Always wanted to try some Ouai products! I love the sound of them and the package is gorgeous! Definitely going to pick up some of the new ordinary stuff! I'm obsessed xox
Fleur- what are your thoughts on the new Charlotte Tilburry pallet?
Hi There Guys! This Is Awesome! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 $𝟚𝟝𝟘 𝕀𝕥𝕦𝕟𝕖𝕤 ℂ𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Claimanygiftcardfrofree
that tarte palette looks amazing! I'll have to check it out, it does look more wearable than the naked heat palette
Hope you can make a Drugstore Makeup 💄 video next. All ur videos are mostly high street and high end. 😔 thanks!
Your face is radiant as usual, Fleur. Can't wait to see how the baby will look like. It's going to have a face like a flower or like the sun. Cute!
Are you using all products during pregnancy? Or have you changed anything in your routine?
The ester lauder box is already sold out. Boo!
Well that's my Christmas list sorted! Thanks FleurB. Hope you're well x
Love watching an intelligent woman with good vocabulary playing with beautiful frivolous stuff  I'm 36 and get a headache from the omg babes channels lol .. I love that you try enough of the things to give an opinion rather than just a basic show what's out xxx
Your hair looks incredible, I definitely need to try those Ouai products!
Your videos are ALWAYS informative and fantastic!!!  P.S. Pregnancy looks great on you!! XOX
Hi Fleur, today in France, we're celebrating everyone named Fleur so happy name's day , happy Fleur's day 🎉😘 tc !
What nail polish are you wearing? 😍
Hi Fleur I really enjoyed the October update so many interesting new things. I'd love to know which of the Ouai shampoos you used and enjoyed I was about to take the plunge. Also I had read about the smoothing product you mentioned but haven't been able to find in the UK so thrilled it may now be available.
Hi fleur are you wearing maternity wear? Could you do a video on maternity wear?
Smashbox has sold out of the charity boxes on your link but Bobby Brown still has some in stock :-)
Love your top ooh new products
Your hair in this video is amazing!!!!
that brown sparkly shade in the tarte palette STRESSES ME OUT hahahah IMAGINE THE FALL OUT
The toasted looks amazing and supporting a good cause, I always love
I never realised you still made YT videos! I’ve missed them; I used to watch you way back in the day! Hey girl!
Hi Fleur, what did you think of the new Chanel perfume- Gabrielle? X
I love what you're wearing Fleur! Where is it from and can you get it non maternity? It's so cute 😊 Love your videos and hope you're enjoying your pregnancy. Can't wait for #babydeforce
You look so beautiful you are glowing 🤗😍
Love that box for breast cancer! Great idea. Another great video, Fleur :)
Love these videos Fleur, really respect your opinion and appreciate work you put in to research and try all these products out x
Fleur whats wrong with your undereye concealer, it doesnt look as good as always. Have you used another one ?
some nice looking products there
I’m looking for liquid lipstick version of mac velvet teddy that’s going to last all day. Any help??? X
I love the smelling sound not in a creepy way but its not gross....
Would love a drugstore haul for autumn /winter
Hi fleur love watching to see what's new in.your hair looks amazing.xx😀
Thank you for this informative video, Fleur!
Love these types of videos! Do you have any recommendations for liquid eye liner? I’m on the hunt for something new because my favourite one has been discontinued. Also, waterproof would be an amazing plus ❤️
So happy to see your video Fleur! I am in love with the Tartlette palette and the Erborian mask I'll definitely look into. (Before this vid, here I was trying to whittle down my makeup stash for some while 😂)
Love it all and you are lovely! xoxo
Love these 'new i beauty' videos☺️
Awesome idea for the breast cancer box 💕and looking forward to trying the new Ordinary serums!
Lovely choices as always, Fleur. :) Hope you're feeling well ; before you know it your Favorite Beautiful Lead Item of All Time will be ... *Baby DeForce.* :D
I am so sad the toasted palette isn’t out yet 😩 it looks amazing
I'm not loving that UD mascara either.  The Perversion mascara is one of my favorite from them, though!
The tarte palette is so beautiful😭
I am definitely going to pick up the Tarte  palette. Curious about the Eborian mask since I enjoy their BB cream. The bubble mask looks fun! What would you compare the Clinique  overnight lip balm to? Oh my gosh! Nooo replica! I adore their fragrances & I don't need to because they are pricy but that one sounds good. Beach Walk is my all time favorite scent. It's pretty much been my signature scent for the past couple of years. Hope you're having a lovely week. Hugs, Summer xo
Urghhh the breast cancer box is sold out. My mum just finished treatment a few months ago and would have loved it! Hoping they'll restock
I'm so excited and ready for the tarteltte toasted pallete 😍😍😍
i have to look for that beauty box for breast cancer, that's nice! i will look for and try the clinique double bubble mask is available in the US for $24.50
My favourite and what I look forward to most are your Vlogtober and Vlogmas vlogs. I, of course, totally understand why you are not doing them but I am still a little heartbroken. Hopefully next year.
OOOOh I love the breast cancer box! Sadly it's not available in the States and they do not ship internationally from the UK site
Gutted that the breast cancer beauty box is sold out. Is it a one off or do they come back in stock?
It's a shame that the Estee Lauder box sold out in minutes! Would have liked one....
The tarte palette looks so good but idk where to buy it from in the uk
Does Tarte ship to the UK ? Or how else can we get this palette?
Are you a male to female transgender? Born a man?
Love your hair Fleur. The new growth looks so heathy and shiny. Natural color looks so flattering.
no shops in the UK stocks tarte make up !!!;( if anyone things i'm wrong and know the place pleat let me know!!!!) there is one place like a pharmacy and let's say for tarte eyeshadow palette charges like 149 pounds!!!????🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🙄
Wear us your top from?!
It seems a bit odd that Replica are releasing a summer/sea scent in October...  I love the Lipstick one and By the Fireplace for winter :)
Your explanation of hair memory :) haha.
did anybody misunderstand fleur saying sweat proof as 'sex proof'??
Hi Fleur! Question! Where/How do you get Tarte in the UK?! Thanks for answering love! ❤
Your hair look gorgeous in this video xx
Loved this new-in-beauty video as always!  You always give great reviews/first impressions
I am a camera, I didn’t want to learn this truth
Dan I can watch you do anything and love it, literally when I feel down I binge watch your videos and it immediately makes me feel better because you're so honest in every video, I love it ❤️
I love videos about people's BELONGINGS and ROOMS and SPACES. It is the most fascinating thing what everyone has, what connections people have to the things they own and how they arrange them. What crumpled receipts people have in their bags, and their favourite cuddly toys, and the things they keep as mementos. The things they can't throw away and the things that remind them of, say, 2007 specifically. The colours and light flow and the arrangement of furniture in people's rooms. How people organise the same stuff in a thousand different ways. What we consider necessary, or a part of our identity, or a tangible expression of some facet of ourselves. Anyway I want you to know that I own 20 plastic frogs.
I mean you have 4 suits that you have worn so talk about being an adult 🤗
Not to be captain obvious but you take your dry cleaning to the dry cleaners.
Yeh but is it even a Daniel J Layton video without the Harry Potter books in frame???
this is one of my favourite “series” i guess idk i love the two videos you’ve made about this it helps so much.
Dan. I would hands down date you. Like no joke.
YOURS WILL SOON BE NOT AS NICE
Does anybody really know what dry cleaning is? A good place to go for dry cleaning is Timpsons, and they might be able to fix boots as well. Kill two birds with one stone. Potentially three birds with one stone, because there are Timpson branches at some supermarkets like Sainsbury's and Morrisons, so you can do food shopping as well.
HAHAHAH the Janet posters even in ur uni halls.\nYou already knew who you were. I'm proud.
Dry cleaning is a process of soaking in a chemical solvent rather than water. It's for fabrics that would degrade in water, or for pieces that are too delicate for a washing machine.
Well done for getting this far in it! (This is genuine and not sarcastic btw)
But you forgot about room tour!!!
Ask google to find you a decent dry cleaners. You haul your stuff to them they work their magic and then you get it back clean pressed and on hangers. If you want your stuff starched make sure to ask. I liked a really stiff chefs coat back in the day. Like turn it sideways and it doesn't budge. I'd ask for hot press and triple starch. Then I wouldn't have to iron it as hard to keep that nice line. It shouldn't be too expensive either. I mean less than $20ish per suit. Usually they can do it super fast too.
I moved in august, the bedroom is a disaster (the rest isn't much better but that isn't my point). Soon very soon there will be bought another closet for the bedroom, so at least 40 % of the floor will reappear from under bags of towels, table cloths and bedding stuff - I hope.\nVedo is nice, I have missed these short interactions, like back in the old days where you challenges yourself to do a video every week :)
3:29 babe you could never turn me off.\n\n\nhahaha.\n\n\n\nlol.
Wow, I'm fairly confident that me and Dan shared the same student halls... and I can confirm they really are great!
OMG Tell me if you have figgured out the Dry Cleaning! I have a dedicated place in my bathroom where I hang my dresses for weddings... and they stay there, I buy new ones. I love the old ones... they need dry cleaning.... I don't even??? I am good at grown-up stuff (thats half a brag right there!) but Dry Cleaning is an actual mystery...
Stoff
M8 where are your fairy lights from? 😂. The really important question
Hm... with all of the stuff you still have, I'm not sure I'm convinced that you ever actually got rid of anything. Lol. Dan, at this rate you are going to end up on that show hoarders!
You're so right about spending all your money moving that you have none to actually decorate. I found this out when I moved to edinburgh and ended up buying two leather recliner sofas for £50 in total. They look like shit, but are comfy as hell. I also bought a wardrobe and chest of drawers for £40 in total as they were ex display. It is these kind of moments when I realise that I am truly an adult.
Not knowing what dry cleaning is--too real.
Wall of memes i love it
Dry cleaning is cleaning using regulated and toxic chemicals instead of water and its so expensive its not economical for anyone to have a private dry cleaning setup which is why you need to go to a storefront for it. Also water will shrink suit fabric which is why you need to do that.\n\nJust google dry cleaner near me, bring your suits, and maybe ask how much its gonna be and how long its gonna take.
I am moving house at the the moment, so I can feel this video really well.
Please make more of these. Mainly because I love the way you pronounce stuff.
I relate to this so much. I started uni 2 months ago and I'm still decorating my room!
Were you in Lincoln courts because that's where I am right now.
LEGIT HAVING THE EXACT SAME ADULT PROBLEMS. I have a coat and a dress that need to be drycleaned, plus a pair of boots that desperately need a fix. So please update us on when and how you solve these issues.
Your VEDO is my favorite VEDO, I could honestly listen to you talk about anything.
Been in my place for 11 years now.   Still not done.
This video was the perfect length for me to watch while I took off my make up. So THANKS DAN!
So excited for your vid on my birthday (25th october, pls give me a shoutout am too excited <3 )
I moved to uni a few weeks ago, and it took me about 3 days to put my polaroids up in my room. And oh mY GoD did it make a difference. Literally 15 tiny little photos from holidays, SitC, parties etc made my room instantly feel more like home. Today we printed a load of flat photos and hung them in our kitchen/dining area. It's crazy how much difference a few photos and fairy lights make
In the time between when I was 11 to 18 I moved house 9 times. The thing that mad my room my room was all my posters and drawings. Every house they moved with me and made it the new place a home.
As a kid I used to love going to the dry cleaners with my mum/dad. The front desk was at a level above my head but it had a sort of ledge on it that was child level. I thought they were the best place caus they remembered that little kids like to see the top of a front desks too. I was a very easy child to please 😁
Okay a little tip for the drycleaning suits. IT'S expensive. This is something a lot of professional instrumentalists do. They wait until it's really cold out, like freezing overnight and they just put their suits outside to get the smell of sweat out of their suits. Apparently this is supposed to work, don't ask me how, I'm a girl, but I've heard this so many times by different people. It's worth a try.
Talking about things being familiar and comforting, sitting in a new uni flat and just hearing your outtro makes me feel so much more comfortable in my own skin. Thanks for the video today Dan :)
Lucky, my uni doesn't allow me to hang pictures or posters on the wall, not even with Blu Tack. However, there's a huge corkboard along the wall, so my grandad undid a couple of the screws and that's where my pictures hang instead.
I started uni about a week ago and this helped me a lot :) thanks Dan
I legit want to do a big tidy now... I suppose that is procrastinating as I have SO many essays due in
This spoke to me. I feel like I am in exactly the same place as you. I love the chill clean up time!
Go to the dry cleaners for your suits And the cobbler for your boot.
‘How do you amass glasses in such a fashion’ *stares disappointedly at the piles of glasses and clothes scattered all over my war zone of a room*
I have your videos to keep me company while I'm doing my evening routine. :-)
clothes on clothes on clothes on clothes...... on a *chair* \n\nnever thought I'd relate so much <3
Lovely vid Dan, hope you're settling in well! I really enjoy your I'm just a normal person doing normal things with a sarcastic yet hopeful British attitude brand. It makes me feel like I'm not the only one, you know?
I love you Daniel J. Layton!! Xxx
I love that you guys live so close it really is like you're living in the Friends building because you have your friends close 😊
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR
I love when YouTubers make videos of them just talking about life and doing everyday tasks like in Dodie's vid where she makes pasta and talks about her love life or now when Dan is just cleaning his room. It feels so personal and I feel at ease and so comfortable in this one sided conversation.
1:05 i now have defying gravity stuck in my head cheers daniel j
i cleared so much shit out of my childhood bedroom a couple of months ago and dear god CATHARSIS
Literally just stopped everything I was doing to watch this video I love all your videos Dan but these are my favourite just listening to you rambling is in a way comforting just feels like we are two friends hanging out and just talking xx
The not feeling settled and 'at home' until you've decorated it to make it your own personal safe space is SO TRUE. You discussed it in your August PMS too and all of the chaos of my mental state suddenly made sense: I recently moved to a new city for a year long work placement.. I'm living with people I barely know who know each other better, I'm away from friends who in the past two years of uni have become like family, and as a result am missing my beloved family more so than previous years away from home. We can't decorate our rooms, so I have large expanses of white walls surrounding me and whenever I'm in my room I never felt quite fully relaxed.. It's not MY space, it's no ones space and as such it feels like I've in turn rented my brain out to so many feelings that I can't nail down and think through freely. Thank you Dan for helping that fall into place, your videos are one thing that does feel homely (if that can be not a weird choice of word) and calm my racing brain xx
I have exactly zero suits, and I also do not know what dry cleaning is ;) sorcery!
I do the same but instead of tidy because effort, I alphabetise my dvd collection and when I say collection I mean I could single handily re open blockbusters
I'm just moved and THANK YOU. My house is like almost there now at about 2 months after the move in date.
@daniel J. Layton Can we start a patrion to get you money to buy a bookshelf because the books just sitting in the corners are killing me.
That was my room then I moved out from my parents and left it all because it didn't fit in my suitcase
I love your videos you are an inspiration <3
i love videos like this :))
I have just cleaned the three mugs from my room. And I now have a clothes bench at the end of my bed. I will never really be an adult.
Did... did Dan go to Canada recently? He really didn't mention it much if he did ;)
free shirt when you're buying a suit
Your hope framing and focusing makes me feel relaxed

Omg I love your Harry Potter poster 💛
Lol dan is adorable
I'm enjoying you VEDO immensely! ^_^
Stoff stoff stoff stoff stoff
YES DAN
STOFF
oh ma goodness
Relatable
bit echo-y innit. still great tho. still great.
That Janet Jackson poster though
SPOTLESS
It takes a talent to entertain people with the bare minimum. I mean, i've just watched 4 miutes of you folding clothes and it ended too soon. Looking forward to tomorrow's vid :)
Wow I actually want to tidy now, thank you Dan I am going to tidy now
Even though I'm literally a teenager right now, I'm already pretty house-proud and 'Monica'. I have two things on my desk right now - both anthologies for uni - and then there is nothing else messy in my room.
Yay, i got the first like.i love you're videos thank you for them i was just in a really bad place, exxellent timing\nDry cleaning is getting a person at a laundromat to do it
Your gonna laugh but British Heart Foundation is great to cheap furniture.
Really not a fan of wire hangers. Hate to break it to you.
I am sitting in my uni room as a first year with the exact same Friends poster on my wall. Love that
Cleaning has become my relaxing thing as well, whenever my mental health gets a bit shaky and I feel like I can't achieve anything, I just do a bit of cleaning so I know I've got something done, it's lovely!
Cleaning is  so calming sometimes and I agree, cleaning with something like a movie playing in the background is so cathartic
I clean my room to procrastinate then procrastinate cleaning my room :/
I'm a hoarder too, I keep leaves and rocks and things, mostly paper from school... it's clogging up my room. there is stuff everywhere in my room... I am probably, sadly the 'typical teenager' who just hoards plastic bottles. plus I love your poster... 😁
im gonna be dragged to pieces for suggesting this, but i think you have to start buying ebooks instead of physical copys of books until you have more space
hi
This was a better love story than Twilight.
For me, you two are the best comedy duo I've ever known. With content like this, there's no way you don't blow up eventually.
God these guys are fucking brilliant
Woke up to this, great morning.
How do these guys not have more subscribers?
See fam if you guys had millions of subscribers I dont know what you'd do because the production value is already SO GOOD
Ok, that rock scared me.
F is for friends who do stuff together!
Posting a day late? Forgiven
Production quality is suprisingly good for being a small time YouTube channel
This has become one of my favorite channels in a short amount of time
Who HASNT had their best friends wiener on their forehead? Not true best friends is who
It's funny, for that entire exchange I thought all they had to do was just push the door open. Like they didn't even try moving it at all before they started talking about their friendship. Would have been a heck of a punchline.
this was one of your better sketches, loved it
Huge thanks to 20th Century Fox and YouTube Space LA for letting us shoot on the incredible ALIEN: COVENANT set! That is awesome dudes!
GUYS. 👏🏼 you're killing it.
I was dying throughout the whole video! keep it up you guys!
This was so funny and so well done!
i love you guys
I think a good way for you guys to get more views is to do a more frequent side series or something.  I'd love to see more of you guys even if it's not your usual big production videos
Man you guys are a true inspiration, every single video is straight fire and so quotable. Beautiful \nI strive to make our channel as good as you guys. One day
Well wiener on the forehead IS a classic prank, just saying *shrug emoji*
Better acting then twilight as well. Hell, its easy when its true.
The production value alone on these is absolutely incredible! Paired with the chemistry you guys have and the HILARIOUS writing, I'm honestly hooked! One a month is just unfair! Keep it up guys, you're amazing ❤
Damn, you guys are good at this
This is why we bring pickaxes and tnt on expeditions
There's something really wrong about these guys not having at least a million subscribers. One awesome video after the other!
Always a great surprise ending!
You guys are so creative! KEEP IT UP!!!
You guys covered so much ground with this one.
Like we haven't ALL taken a picture with Chris' weiner.
I can't think of a funnier duo than these two, not Jake and Amir, not Jack and Dean, not even Rick and Morty.
These are always so inspirational! And funny.
SO GOOD, as always !!
Put on headphones in the middle of a lecture just to watch this. \n\nI'm in medical school.
My question is where do you get the budget?
The smallest channel i'm subscribed to but also my favorite, I love it keep it up and it will pay off!
seriously where are all your subscribers guys? like every video is gold!
>Best comedy duo on youtube\n>only 64000 subs\nWhat the fuck.
This was amazing! Really proud of you guys! 😚
Jesus this is amazing
Okay wow! so this is the set of Alien Covenant. Was there scenes in that location in the movie?
Ahhhhhh so excited to see you guys upload!!
Please don't encode 21:9 with black bars. Otherwise great video!
I once too put my wiener on someone's forehead.....
Who is bankrolling the productions of these videos?
How do you not get more views?! Keep up the good work!
Im so surprised that you guys don't have more subs, you are one of my favorite channels
How do you guys come up with these awesome crazy sketch ideas? xD
Shared this with my two best friends. Boy, that's going to cause some issues. Someone is getting left in the Scorpion Tunnel.
Slow and steady you’re growing, keep it up guys!
Thank you Jack and Chris for another awesome skit!
I jumped terribly at that last trap. lol poor jack jack
The month does not pass fast enough!  I want more!!! Love these guys
I knew it. But damn it was good.
I just found your channel the other day and you guys are honestly so funny! I'm definitely gonna show your stuff to my friends, you deserve a lot more views and subscribers!\nA lot of love from Germany:)
I'm not your friend, guy!
I am going to show it to all my Best Friends.
Sent this to my best friend right away! Your videos are so good and i get so excited when the new ones come out!!
Please never stop making these videos. Even if you may not have a huge amount of subscribers, eventually someone in the large productions business will notice you guys 100%
How, how have you guys not blown up yet
I love this unique humor you guys have.  I feel like this is more of a series than a youtube channel, and it should be called The Infinite Realities of Chris and Jack.\n\nI remember meeting you guys at FilmQuest a few years back and saw Movies in Space.  I thought it was the best film at the fest.  I've been following your channel ever since the first video you posted.  I'm a fan. Great job guys!
Damn, I never clicked on the thumbnail of a video so fast before in my life
Damn, the production is getting better and better.\nKudos guys! You are the best (friends)!
Favorite channel on YouTube hands down
Would have been funnier if after the rock fell, the guy who got squished goes, Uh, best friend? A little help here? Please?
The real treasure was inside you all along!\n\n...now let me get inside you.
liked? check. comment? check. subscribe? check. share? check.\n\nWHAT ELSE CAN I DO. YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.
This is like high school reunion levels of awkward mixed with that weird moment your calls you out and asks which of your friends you like more in front of them.  Absolutely loved it!
Your writing is so good!  I show people the White Room all the time!
Don't worry. Dick on the forehead pictures are all the rage right now. People line up at parties to have them done these days.
I'm so happy because of this video right now😊
The cinematography in their videos is ever so awesome
That door is racist
Beautiful. This deserves more views! Subscribe to these guys and help them out!!!
Who hasnt done that classic prank to a few drunk friends lol

You guys are amazing.
Amazing as always :)

It’s Friday.
Your videos are amaaaaaaazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE MAD WITCH OF THE TOY SWAMP CASTS A CURSE OPON YOU!
Classic Chris Chan for the modern era. Absolutely fantastic
PLEASE SEEK HELP. YOU'RE DESTROYING YOUR LIFE!
Seeing as I'm not superstitious or a total fool I'm not at all moved by your melodramatic attempt at cursing others.\n\nYou have to either be spectacularly naive or incredibly thick to think that such a childish display will put fear into anyone seeing as this sort of nonsense hasn't been in fashion since about 1400,
If I had 100 million dollars I would give Chris a million. But then again he would just spend it all on toys and mcdonalds in the first week and then ask for donations for a storage unit to put his new toys in and claim he needs even more money for food and Barb's atkins books.
What's with his eye?
Honestly, it seems as if Chris is the one getting the last laugh. People keep asking why he keeps feeding the trolls, but then again, trolls are the only form of social interaction he can achieve. The trolls are only giving him the attention he desires.
0:53\n\nChris Chan was Sofa King: confirmed.
One of my dreams is to kick Chris Chan really hard in the nuts and see how he reacts.
I'm starting to think this guy might be retarded.
How do you get this good?
Sounds just like Sonny the Cocoa Puffs bird
Chris seek medical help you might actually be having a stroke, at least get a professionals opinion
I've been following this story everywheres, its amazing how far Chris is taking this.
I want to tell him to stay away from the internet, but its pretty clear he loves the abuse.
I'm tired of this
Reminds me of character from a Ralph Bakshi movie in this one.
You need to clean your room, young man!
This is the lowest I think we have seen Chris so far
This video is giving me brain damage. Make it stop.
which monty python sketch is this?
Was Christine helping that guy in Vegas?
His voice is getting more shrilly each day.
Yes and the sagas goes on \n\nJust when you think its over too
That is a sad, pathetic display of an adult human.
What did he mean by this?
That Curse-ye-hame-ha was so halfassed. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I expect more from you.
Glad to see Chris is doing well.
the videos we really want, finally
Okay I'm really not sure what's going on but that was funny. Haven't seen a Chris-chan meltdown in years. But it looks like his magical thinking hasn't changed and he can still curse people through the internet. \n\nA shame he didn't use his Curse-Ye-Hame-Ha. I guess this is the short version of this then.
Well... this saga end really fast
HE TURNED INTO ADAM MACLNTYRE FROM DEAD RISING!
Face of a broken man
goodbye horses, they're coming after you
Wow, The Disaster Artist is looking great.
This isn't even his final form.
Reminds me of the mother in Life of brian.
Every day we stray further from god's light...
You look like a witch
I turned on CC for some potential extra larfs, but all it could pick up was the Financhu Crisis theme music.
Hahahahahhaahha you sounds like a sick bird I can't hear what you say 😂😂😂
The next voice actor for Toad. \n\nYOU HACKED INTO THE PRINCESS' FACEBOOK ACCOUNT!! YOU REALLY BLEW IT THIS TIME, MARIOOOOOO!!! I'M THE BEST!!
This is insanity I tell ya.
The humanity was a mistake
Noooo, don't curse me, Chris, I have to eat my Chipotle! D:\n\nP.S Chris' voice is reaching that frequency. You all know the one.
I haven't laughed so hard in such a long time. I love the pseudo-acting too. You didn't care, Chris. You cared because she had a vagina and didn't detest you.
need captions to understand what my god is saying
This season is just getting weirder and weirder.
Update on Chris; apparently Jessie’s Facebook is back up and she “cares” about Chris, all that nonsense. But I’m sorry, I know Chris won’t listen, I’m not a troll but weren’t you supposed to meet Jessica today?? And all this coincidentally happened a day before? Suddenly she comes back after? I don’t know man, pretty sure she’s trolling you and doesn’t care. But you’ll never listen to us because it US that’s the problem. Yeah there are trolls but there’s also people online actually concerned about your mental state. If you’re going to keep feeding into this Jessica Saga nonsense, you truly are a lost cause.
I wish he did a video review of the sachumo documentary instead of a text one on facebook just for this kinda stuff
Just end it all at this point
Imagine this being yelled by an insane bag lady on a subway platform....
Fake rage, fake crying. It looks like those binaural beats didn't cure your autism, because you're still unable to express genuine human emotion.\n\nIf you'd get a fucking job, you'd have something to take your mind off the breakup. Too bad you're useless.
Chris....you need a kit-Kat
That fake cry tho lol
rip
Stop
someone animate this
What happened exactly?
Sofa King Wrong.
Somebody burn that room
OMG I HAVE RETARDISM TOO
Clean your room
https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif
Eat aids.
Chris turned into Miss Piggy. :P
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
bruh
Here we fucking go again.
People seriously need to leave this person alone. This is sad and won't end well.
STANDING
haha
girl who hurt u
Abysmal acting.
Good.
Inaudible screeching
1:41\n\noh no!!!!
He's back!!
Sounds like a walrus diying
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
SHE SOUNDS LIKE MICKEY MOUSESTJIAJFKAFA
This autism fuels my dark harvest
hes turning into barbara
1:12 turn on subtitles
He's back.
Sofa King™ wrong
Poor, Chris. He never learns from his mistakes.
Is it wrong that I keep coming back to this?~
transcript please...
I really hope he has fixed the infected wound he had between his legs...
Love it. He's trying to hold back the male voice, and keep this horrid shrieking going, but he slips every so often. He doesn't look well either, look at his eyes, and he looks like he's in his mid 50's. Awesome tard rage though. The only thing that can top this is if the lad fully tards out and cuts the hair and gives away being a tranny.
You're not a woman. Grow up. Put on some pants. Cut that nasty hair. Get a job.
Chris in this video looks and sounds like a witch npc character in an RPG game.
Aww, cheer up! Just ignore those trolls, I'm sure you'll find another gf eventually. Also did she just curse-ye-ha-me-ha us? That's fuckin' epic
hhmmm. The irony. Werent they supposed to meet fot the first time today, October 6th?
He looks like a swamp hag in this video.
I thought Chris Chan is in jail right now? Help me out, please... What did I miss.
I wonder if ever Chris's curse-ye-ha-me-ha backfired and he cursed himself with extreme bad luck and misfortune.
Just imagine: Barb will die soon.  Only way to get Chris to do anything is to be Bob/Barb or wiggle boobs in his face.
He has turned into sammyclassicsonicfan
I am going to post some short videos on Instagram (@ChrisFixit) answering some questions like if I was able to make a U-turn instead of a K-turn now. Also I am almost at 100k followers on Instagram so be sure to follow! Once I hit 100k I am doing a giveaway of ChrisFix swag with 7,000 winners!!!
Welcome back Chriss missed ya alott
Looking forward for your Spacers video
Great video bro\nMah man
Just what my Jeep needs.... a tighter turning radius.
Mention scrub radius in your spacer video plz...
'a little tit'
4:44 a little what
Bro you are awesome man. 100 Mil coming right upp..
Chrisfix for prez.
Genius
hey chrisfix can you do a vidio on a drift plz
The back wheels are gonna look ugly it looks fwd
What an awesome video you did it bro! Thanks 4 sharing ur knowledge, greetings from México !
change your name to ChrisMods
And it's bone stock :P
I thought you were going to explain the angle of the dangle! LOL
is this safe to do? I've got an s10 this would work wonders on (maybe) but I'd rather not do it if my steering components wear out 10x faster or i risk damaging things i dont know how to fix lol
Anyone remember the project  police interceptor it more look like a unercover
The moaning you hear from the power steering pump is a bypass valve, however, it's still not good to hold it on the locks because that's 900-1200 PSI going through that little bypass valve!
That reminds me. My car needs new tie rod ends.
Make a video on the air intake!
What about on solid axle front end
in many cars the steering limiter is there to prevent damage to the steering rack and to prevent the wheel from running into the wheel well housing
Is that your mustang's tongue?
If you haven't done a video before on it, can you show how to wire after market speakers/subs?
I hop i will remember this when i get a car
or or hear me out you could always just loosen the bolts on the tire itself and bam half the work, half the tools, half the time, same results(don't take this comment seriously, may result in serious injury or death)
i cant believe you actually used a torque wrench on your lugs..... \nsure....its a good idea to do......because people on youtube might not have the feel that comes with doing a lot of mechanic work\n\nbut ive never used a torque wrench....i just learned by doing it....and then having my dad make sure they were tight enough\neventually i got the feel for it
Did you put spacers on the rear to widen the track on both axles?
You've made the front wheels wider but you left the rear wheels in stock that will effect the handling of your vehicle it will cause it to understeer which is bad for a drift build like yours
Will this put your car out of alignment ?
crisfix quick question, I have a 98 f150 4.6l, when she warm start chugging bad like a misfired but the check engine code say is the oxygen sensor 2 I test both sensor and the result was fine do you think is the idle or the egr bad? (I delete the muffler and then a couple days turn the check engine after that)
Probably not a good idea for some high center of gravity vehicles.  Neat anyway.
chrisfix faster than the whole nascar pit crew 8:05
What does it mean when I turn my wheel all the way I a start to hear a pop
Thank you so much for posting videos they have helped me with my build so much
What's your opinion on steering reducers that go on the steering shaft?
Next video you need to upload could be the nrg quick attach steering wheel because it is very easy to install
Are you going to put wheel spacers on the rear so that the front tires aren't sticking out further than the rear ones? I only ask because I have a similar car only its the V6 and manual but I don't really like how far in the rear wheels look.
Im new to this channel. Does chris fix bitches?
Hi I am a senior in High School and to graduate I need to complete a senior project. For my project I want to do some upgrades for my 1998 Chevrolet s10 (4 cylinder manual transmission). Unfortunately due to circumstance I do not have the budget to purchase all the necessary parts. I want to start by adding performance exhaust and a cold air intake to boost horsepower. I know what you are probably thinking, why don't you get a job? Well I have a job, but as a senior in high school making minimum wage, and having school work to do, I simply do not have the income to put into this project. Any help at all from the good people of the internet would be most appreciated! Thanks and best regards, Christian\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/4jikkyw
Man the cinematography was jaw dropping!
Nice editing work on this one, Chris.
Your brake caliper is touching your suspension arm. When moving it will destroy it. Not enough room on the other side too. The tire will move a bit when loaded on a hard turn... Poor and dangerous tuning...
How do you make your car safeor set up for driving on a track ? Thank you
0:20 Wait, you had a perfectly fine ebrake you could have used to help you make a tighter turn!
Lol..why are people bitching  about his work..don't like it then don't watch. He's chrisfix..he can do what tf he wants
First dodgy advice I've seen on this channel. These modifications can lead to less stability in turns especially in wet weather. I would not do this to my car except if it's a pure fun car and I'm not driving it on the street.
i wish i could skip time to see a new #ChrisFix Video....
You live in grove street \n1:48
i also know how to turn a mustang tightejust give it sone throttle ler the clitch go and turn
Congrats on trending for almost 24 hours so far Chris!
sounds like its time for ball joints or tie rod ends with that classic ford squeek.
Good luck doing that on a quattro audi😕
I’d add wheel spacers to the rear too, car looks funny with more front track than rear
Serious shopping cart angle I laughed so hard on this
This is very important if you drive an American car. They love sloppy stearing.
so wheels with negative offset, are just (deep) dished wheels, right?
Man this vid was so well thought out. One of your best thus far. Well done my man!
FINALLY HES BACK!!! I thought i was going to have to watch the exhaust video for the next month :)
Put some fender flares on it :D
 some serious shopping cart angle 😂😂😂😂😂 funny bro.
Get a new steering wheel
# 48 on trending CONGRATS
YOU'R THE MAN!!!!!!!!!!!
Great video
love this guy
You should do a video on how to replace a tie rod, control arm bushing, and ball joints. I'll even give you my truck to work on lol
Good to know how do that
Hello Chris, I actually just got a Mustang, Exactly like yours! Except mine is black and it is automatic :( but thank you so much, your videos really help me understand what needs to be done when I buy new things for it.
Fantastic as always! You can pick up SCH80 pipe which has thicker walls to match the original limiter.
thats really cool lease repond back to how to make one
hey wait wouldn't doing this put a lot of strain on your powersteering pump and cause front wheels to slide sideways ?
Nice job on the video Chris.
Please go drifting more
Seriously...   Please put Sub Frame Connectors on the car! =O  Your chassis is literally flexing as the suspension because everything else but the chassis is stiff.  You NEED Sub Frame Connectors on this car, and you need them before you tweak the chassis to the point where it can't be fixed...
Carefull because some cars if you take the rack limiter out you can pop the seals and have a major power steering leak. For best results what I found is extend the steering bar along with respective parts necessary.
None asking why they put the spacers there in first place ?🤔
How do you change how much you have to turn the stearing wheel for turning
Wow that's the first time I have actually heard anyone talk about the groan of the power steering at lock. I always figured it was normal, but no-one knew what I was talking about
Yessss about time
My car has a pretty crap turn radius... but it's also old, so I'm not sure if these limiters were used when my car was made. Only one way to find out, I guess... well, I could Google it, or I could get under the car. So, two ways to find out.
haha #shoppingcartangle
you should make a series to fully explain a car and its parts your videos are the best and I actually understand when you explain.
Why do car manufacturers not put thinner ones on to begin with?
Chris plz start vloging
Thanks Man ???
Would this work on my 2002 ford ranger?
Stay tuned! Meaning wait another fucking week
Thanks Chris will be trying this on my Oldsmobile Aurora the front of that car is way too long so anything that can help me make sharper turn is awesome.
Really looking forward to seeing the wheel spacers video!
8:05 Chris been practicing for that NASCAR pit crew spot.
chris..just a quickie..what equipments (camera and stands) do you use for recording these awesum videos
Any chance for a video for removing ABS? And repiping those brake lines? Much love from u.k
Bru this is some seriously sic shit. Great job bru.
that car was lucky to be bought by you
Shouldn't you install wheel spacers at the front and the rear if you do not want to change how the car drives?
Gotta love American rear wheel drive cars and their simplicity. On an Audi Quattro, not only should you not even attempt something like this, you should avoid turning your steering to the point of locking as a rule. Audi is German for just drive around the block and save your rack/pump/control arms/CV joints. :)
Not doing any of these mods, still really enjoy watching it.

God dude that's pretty fuckin accurate. Just gotta say, I'm a new fan, and been browsing through your old videos, and just gotta say even then your animating and edits are amazing. Now they are phenomenal and more seamless. Just so cool, please keep doing these!!
The final where he put's the frying pan on his head is awesome ... hahahaha it made me follow.

Don't let him leave the room and make him sign a new contract😂😂😂😂
I have met Emre before! No noke. I went to Liverpool v Arsenal 4. March 2017. The day after I took a train from Liverpool to London. I met him on the train, he's a really Nice guy btw!
Do one with Coutinho. I like this series as release a new hip hop quiz with Sturridge, Gomez and Ox. It'll be funny.
Let him go dony need him i always sell him on fifa and get loen..saul ... kimmch or renato
This guy is a former Bayern player. It's no surprise that half of the team are Bayern players
Yes,we are living in Ronaldo & Messi era.We must be proud of it.
Too many bayern plyr
Bayern Munich!
No Toni Kroos?
I thought this was Emre Can's dream team not the bayern starting XI
Can your one of my favourite midfielder
He has chosen players from four clubs only, namely:\n1) Bayern\n2) Liverpool\n3) Barcelona\n4) Real Madrid\nAre those his favorite clubs?
Bro he should just said Bayern
Algum brasileiro q gosta do Liverpool e assiste esse canal?
And he's leaving in the summer ... Total shame to the board if he leaves
he want to bayern :) bitch
Not biased at all.
RB Philip lahm yes great banta can 😀😀😀😂😂😂 nah but being serious it will be bad to see him leave he seems so nice 👍
Jurgen is going to Bayern so is Emre Can.
Choses an ex Liverpool player and a player who wants to leave Liverpool great side🤣🤣🤣
To many Bayern players in my opinion
he just want is bayern move to be done soon
Chill, he's German and came up at Bayern. His picks are not shocking at all.
So all bayern munich players are in his dream team and his Liverpool teammates. I can understand GK position and forward but all other guys 😧😧😧
Mignolet no goals in should surely be ahead of Neuer.
liverpool have to buy carlos lampe, bolivia goalkeeper
Looks like Emre is pushing for a move to Munich 😂😂😂
maybe a move to bayern?
People complain about Emre choosing so many Bayern players, but keep in mind, they are all some of the best in the world in their respective positions. I totally understand him.
Just gonna take a wild guess here, he wants a bayern move?
Damn. That's a good team.
This shows can have his heart on Bayern m
Frank could have been better but still good
So basically, Emre Can is joining Bayern Munich for free in the summer.
Stop making him to videos and make him sign the contract lol
Half of the players are from Bayern Munich
That would be a beast team, and suits, the big beast himself emre
He just picked all the best players
Hope he signs new contract
That is one hell of an awesome midfield Emre, glad to see you know what you're talking about.
this is just a German/Bayern hybrid
Please sign a new contract Emre!!!
KLAVAN is god. One of the best defenders in the world. He’s strong powerful great tackle. He is a proper leader and legend
Although it's mostly bayern players n players he play with it's a pretty good team☺
Stevie G providing to Ron and Messi...just imagine 😍😍
Sounds like he wants to come back to Bayern
when did he play with ramos?
I think he likes Bayern
I love you ❤️ can \nOne of the best players in the premier league
Never mind who he picks, sign a contract and focus on the games.
I'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm…
He would like to sign for Bayern??
Lowkey emre wants to be in bayern again
Does Can just love Bayern, or does he just love Bayern. I think he just loves Bayern.
OK, Ronaldo's good and all, but Danny Ings??!!?!
Funny how most of the the team is munich
*Emre Can chooses his all-time eleven from the stars he's played with or against, for club and country.* , please read the description before talking trash.
He choose Cou & SG8 because he's Lfc player, if him not from this club, he's don't choose them😁👌
Well he wants to go back to Bayern again lol
He just named the Bayern team tbh
This is a bayern team
Send him to bayern. His heart is there
Clearly can is a Munich fan
Sign the fucking contract.
Emre can 😳
I think Emre is eyeing a move to Bayern....
Title is misleading, It should be Emre Can's favourite Bayern Players and some other players as well. 😂
Unsurprisingly, no English players in the back 5
Play Can at cb
Where is ox
Sign new contract!
Where's Rickie Lambert?
Too many Bayern
No lord bendtner 😥😥😥🙄
Go play for Bayern jeez
To many Bayern Players
Not lovren as CB? Wtf
Where is Moreno??!!
All about Munich 😂😂
Job application to Bayern?
#KloppOut
picked half of Bayern Munich
This dude a bayern munich fan LOL
Bayern Munich Confirm
completley agrreee
ALL MUENCHEN  😂
messichan !!
Gerrard goat <3
WTF no lovren at CB?!! Man got robbed
only bayern players
Bayern XI?
No Suarez??! 😕
Eeeyyyy emre can u know man
Loved this video
Sign da ting Emre!
Robben>Mané Emre think we need a word mate!
Emre Can selects his ULTIMATE Bayern XI
RENUEVEN A EMRE HIJOS DE SU PUTA MADRE. GIVE HIM  A NEW CONTRACT  MADAFAKAS
Mo salah
I feel we should stop disrespecting Lovren. He's a Liverpool player and we should back him despite the errors. Ridiculing him will only break his morale and brings us no good.
I'M ON THE PHONE!!
love the video, but I don't know if I'm being stupid, while watching another video an ad came up for sportswear and it had the image of lips from one of your EPs (distance) ... i was like wtf? But I don't know if they can do that or not? It might just be a small thing but I thought i would mention it...sorry if I'm over reacting :D
The sad thing about this is that the phone that is your FIRST PHONE is the most up to date phone my grandad has ever owned
I wounder why her daddy loves her, shes got a charming personality.
I called it that it would be a nokia
I wanted to see old phone not new one\nEdit: NeVeRmInD
“I’m gonna become a tech channel”\n.\n.\n.\n“I’m gonna make a gaming channel”
The chat function was for AIM!!!
I literally love Emma so much
This was my first phone too... I loved changing up the cases! My Buffy the Vampire one was my favourite 😂
I'm surprised that still works considering analog vs digital technology
Are you a fan of Sonic Youth? \nThose phones are sick though.
Jaysus Emma if that airbag goes off you're going to be hurting
Imagine opening a box expecting an overpriced shit apple iPhone and finding a genuinely alright phone. Would rather a brick than an iPhone.
I read this as you getting a phone for the first time
3510i was my first, I was 10 and people my age were having flip up phones, camera. Now 13 years later, iPhone.
Omg the Nokia tone brings back so many memories! 💜📱
WE HAD THE SAME FIRST PHONE
i used to have one of those phones and i loved it
She completely ruined the joke at the beginning
Emma with every beep a past channel of yours dies and some one unsubs due to Demma I'm off to dans dieing channel
I love this lol
Why did you steal Luke's intro? Not cool Emma, not cool.
That reaction to the Nokia instead of the iphone went on for an uncomfortably long time 😂😂
You, I mean you emma, you can dye your hair what ever color, and you would still look amazing.
We now know what she uses as a vibrator
I love Emma so much.
You got your first phone when you were 8 years old and ur 25?! Jeez ur family was well off, it was rare to have a phone that early when we were younger
That is the same ring tone as my grandad has (the one her dad plays on his phone)
This was my first Mobile Phone, Too! :D I was 10. memories!
I'm using my first phone. It's a second hand iPhone 5s. Shoot me
I worked at Nokia in the 90s. Memories. <3
Is no one gonna make a comment about the vibrator comment...
I love your dad 😂
Glad you got back to normal emma lol love u!!!!!
Emma, I really love the new video format. You're re-inventing the channel and I love it. Keep up the good work!
HELLO? YEAH I'M IN A RESTAURANT! I'LL CALL YOU BACK!
The game of the serpent was the Agar.io of those days
This brings back so many memories! Did anyone else have any of the following phones? My first phone was a Nokia 3310 with a tigger case. A few years later I got an LG 8110 with a rotating camera 😂 third phone was a classic Motorola Razor in pink. Then my first ever phone that wasn’t handed down to me was an LG KS360. Literally the best thing to happen to me at the time and I’ve honestly never been more excited about a phone than when I got that phone! Ever since about 2010 I’ve only ever had iPhones and couldn’t imagine using anything else now.
Omg nostalgia in the first 4 seconds! This gone be good :D
When I was on the bus the revren of my town (i'm not religous) was on the bus too. I was trying to enjoy a peaceful bus trip but no. The revren decides to go through all of the ringtones on his nokia phone. Bless him.
I'm too young for most of this nostalgia. It just gives me jurassic park panic and I feel immediately in danger
YOUR HAIR IS SO NICE OMG I LOVE IT
The only thing i I can see is a murder weapon
My first phone was the Nokia 3310i (handed down from my sister) and I remember it being the cutting edge of phones cos the i meant it had a colour screen 😂
okay but your eyebrows look great here 10/10
I think everyone's heard the Nokia tune too much to feel the nostalgia while listening to it
4:55 guys! she leaked music from her new ep!!!2!1!!1
You probably shouldn't stand in the middle of a bank and say I really wanna set it off in here
I’m going to the concert in Wembley and your going is this true
i thought it was her first ever time using a mobile phone
Anyone else really liking what Emma is doing with her channel?
Tbh I live the life that Emma was experimenting already considering I don't own a smartphone. I have an iPod Touch for all the apps so I literally can't do anything on it unless I've got wifi access and for phone calls I have a standard Samsung phone that only does calls and texts. \nWhen I'm out and I need to know information I do all the research at home beforehand so I know where I need to go and what I'm doing ect. You'll never see me outside with my face glued to a screen lol.
Honestly if I saw the phone I would wonder what you were selling
So I'm not the only one who thinks Auld Lang syne is a bop
You sound like my young English teacher
You filmed in the car on my birthday :D
I could google it but.. “old” cellphones didn’t have airplane mode right? For a little game of snake on the plane...
Please do the Ebay mystery boxes Id wanna see your reactions😂😂
I would have been really disappointed if there had been an iPhone in the box. This is so much better!
I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 right now !!   I had a Philips 301 origionally in 1997, then upgraded to a 3310e when it came out.  I had that phone for around 10 years. :P   moved on to a Nokia N95 and then a N97...  Finally got a smart (ish) phone in 2013 !! lol
fking love this and omg the memories or the nokia phone i had a light blue one but it did look thicker and more heavy  than your one
The original is always better... well it actually comes originally from Gran Valse by Francisco Tárrega (which is a beautiful piece).
My first phone was the Nokia 6010
If you ever think you job is pointless, just remember they made cases for those phones lol
I loved the description and THROWBACK is everything
Emma, I'm confused... The thumbnail is you with the Nokia. The title says I used my first ever phone for a day ... Was I actually supposed to believe that there was an iPhone 8+ in that box?
Does anyone know where she got that killer denim jacket from???
Isnt that front panel supposed to come off so you can have a different colour
Comment what ringtone you had on your Nokia 3310 my was knick knack
*watches this video on my samsung* Yes. Yes I need a smart phone.
I just have to say that I love watching your videos and I was too scared to listen to your Music I was afriad that it whould wreck your videos but I absolutley love yout music aswell . Love from Sweden <3
Gonna watch you at big gig!!!! Xx
I remember my Nokia :D x
the first phone i got was a burner flip phone, it didnt last 2 months
I love your dad and yours relationship
Better battery life for sure or more durable. I only had to charge it once a week when I was 14, and I used to play snake on the sports bus
Next step, make this a science channel, and test the durability of the Nokia!
No offense but I like you hair I just think You should change it to brown...\n\nThat made me sound like I hate your hair. I dont but I just think like yellow dosnt suit you 💟💫
My first phone was a vodaphone branded flipphone with butterflies on it and I used to dream it could record videos lmao

Are they both drunk? 😂😂😂 it looks so fun!!!
WTF! How old are these people? This would be something we did in HIGH SCHOOL! Time to grow up people. These two should be laughing and carrying on with their GRAND CHILDREN for Christ's sake. Dispicable 🖕
Ellen seems so fun to hang out with!
Oprah' s product placement ruined this a little for me. 😕😒
It’s never too big.
Omfg the lady with the brussel sprout is MY ENGLISH TEACHER AHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Who's Oprah and Ellen?
That looked like a lot of fun shopping with you two. thanks for sharing.
Ellen is so childish and I love that 😂😂😂
I wonder if the Ellen show could help me find my biological family I was adopted at birth and I always wanted to meet my real mother
That guy gave the whisky to his kid XD
1:43 that's my teacher 😂😂 with the blue

Look at us we are so rich from interviewing trailer trash that we make fun of people who have to actually shop heee haaa heee haaa
I just love this kind of laughter and friendship if the world functioned at this level on a regular basis this would be a better world. Keep laughing Oprah and Ellen two great women I love u and I'm praying for u too God bless  D. Pitts
*Ellen and Oprah get into a random person's car to go to their house* \n\n\n\n\ncasual
Commercial excuse matter recover those fitness article together initially numerous.
What a nuisance x2. Would leave the store right away if these two walked in.
Ellen is so funny 🤣👌🏿👌🏿 Just love them both🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿👑👑👑💰💰💰
Are people really that privileged that they don't even go to grocery stores?!?!
Oprah has her own food? well I know what my next diet will include.... love these ladies
How come the screen is black for me?
“You have 2 kids you might need that.” *passes the bottle of liquor* 😂😂😂
Stephanie is the luckiest person at any grocery store ever
Do you know how much money is in that store right now,
“Ellen bring my money back” lol I wanna be that calm about someone else having my cash bruh
Why do they go into these upscale grocery stores? Why not go into a grocery store in the hood?
Shocking. Thought Oprah would have more than 40 dollars .
I love how Oprah just goes with it and has a laugh 😂
Ellen copied jake paul 's idea of talking on the mall's phone
No wonder why they haven't been to a grocery store in years. Christ!
Could u imagine running into Ellen @ a Grocery Store??? Wowsies!!! Mind. Blown.
Josh is quaking
That was hilarious!!🤣👍🏾👍🏾
I could use some groceries.

I could be the 1000th dislike😱should I?
I'm British and I'm falling in love with the future president and vice president.... Oprah and Ellen...😀😀😀
This is absolutely disgusting. The pinnacle of human depravity
What store is this ?
show some support for a new YouTuber help me to 1 k
When Oprah and Ellen go to your store when your not there 😨
The old lady that Oprah was talking to about the Brussels sprouts is actually a teacher from my school! She hasn't been at school for like about 5 weeks. While her students are suffering, she's out trying to get on tv without knowing!!
And who says money can't buy happiness. I mean, there must be fifty bucks worth of groceries in that honda.
My vote for 2020 election.
When oprah laughed at Ellen for shopping for cucumbers because the inside joke is that she's a lesbian and people usually buy cucumbers for Dildos 😂😂and the funnier part when Ellen asks Oprah what size cucumber she should get and Oprah says it's too big and the other is too small 😂😂😂
Did anyone noticed the girl covering her daughters eyes the girl who Ellen paid of
They have cops there in case Josh Peck hits her with a car again.

Ellen your amazing, like your such a great person, and your amazing at what you do. Love you so much!
Oh sure, when Ellen and Oprah take over a store, they don't get kicked out, but when Logan Paul does it.... lol

So this is the movie Ashton Sanders told Denzel on the red carpet of the Oscars that he was gonna do with him! Too bad Ashton had to drop out of the project :(
writer and director of NightCrawler, alright, i'll give it my attention.
Even denzel gets that feminist bullshit
I'm tired of doing the impossible for the ungrateful.  That's fucking beautiful.  This looks like a great movie.
Bout time this trailer dropped! Can't wait for this performance by Denzel.
Denzel can play anything.Cant wait
Test it but not repeat ?
I know a guy who's a local pimp, can I report him to the cops for cash??

Definitely will be seeing this. November is shaping up to be a good month for movies.
Sony Pictures Entertainment, you guys should team up with LEGO to make a LEGO GhostBusters movie for all of the long-time GhostBusters fans and all of The LEGO Movie fans out there and then make a irresistibly fun LEGO GhostBusters film franchise out of it and it'll be THE greatest film franchise Sony Pictures Entertainment has ever made in recent memory. The long-time GhostBusters fans will even say it's right up with the hit TV show, The Real GhostBusters, itself on so many possible levels. #LEGOGhostBusters
Each one of us is greater than the worst thing we've ever done.
Where are the trolls? This movie looks good!

NO Oscar for Washington. No nomination. Nothing. This movie is awful
I'm feeling pretty constipated
Now we are asking real questions.
WTH, The Squat Toilet is Indian and it does have a flushing mechanism.
Who told squat toilet doesn't have any flush mechanisms?? It has everything a western toilet has except it's squat toilet. And ya squat toilets are also found in india as it originated from here
Think about it. In the future the kids will be even more depressed and stressed because they will have to learn more history. Because things that happen after we go to school....and they will have to study it.

Crap is a swear word in every English speaking country except America. Also, I don't where on earth you got your research from but we (The British) do not call that water gun thing toilet roll. We call toilet paper toilet roll, you literally had them in the same frame, they are the same thing.

I'd love spraying water on my ass. Imagine how clean you'd feel after. I hope the US adopts this...

My longest piss was about 1.5minutes
pacing's not ass, sad thing is, in the real future the world is fueled by instant gratification and not having ADD is the minority. and this is coming from someone who was diagnosed with ADD in the second grade
This movie was extremely slow and boring.  Some scenes were way too dark and that twist at the end didn't really work.  The only standout performance was from love
What a fucking awesome movie. Villenueve is the new Christopher Nolan.
I watched the first movie last week and hated it.. probably if i watched in 1982 would have been awesome unfortunately i wan't born then.. I fell asleep for 2049 for like 5 mins due to slow pacing but the rest of the movie was awesome.. like 2 way better than 1..
Will we get a spoiler review for blade runner 2049
I bet in 2049 people will be like Wow this is what people in the 2010's thought we'd be like? Fools.
Great movie! I recommend everybody go see this movie.
Weak.. stick with the first one
A friend just told me, GO SEE BLADE RUNNER 2049. He loved it. But I didn't even like the first one. I thought it was just weird and slow and kind of dull. Would I get anything out of Blade Runner 2049?
I want to see this so bad, but nobody I know has watched the first Blade Runner. Welp, looks like I have to introduce them to the original!
I like 2049 better than the original. I really liked the pacing of this one. I enjoy a slower film.
Liked both. The music was better in the 1st for me. Gonna watch it again maybe tomorrow.
I can't say I'm a big fan of the original, but I loved 2049
This movie has plot holes everywhere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best film of 2017. They have managed to improve over the original which is really surprising. Phenomenal cinematography and plot. It will attain a cult status in the future like the original.
3 hours!!!! THIS FRIKING MOVIE WAS THREE HOURS LONG!! WTF!!!\nI don't know if it was because i didn't see the original one, but I understood half of this movie, i though there were too many plots, the pacing was killing me AND all scenery was identical to Ghost in the shell...
i agree with Jeremy review more when compared with chris review of this movie.
Was gonna see it in theaters until I heard 3 hours long.
Did anyone else rewatch this review after seeing the opening of the Mountain Between Us review?
so what's a better rating, worth watching and worth buying on blu-ray?  or Worth watching no alchohol required.  And then what's worse, alchohol required or T-minus 2 seconds.  My guess is that this is the Jeremy Jahns rating.\n\n5 star = Awesometacular\n4 star = Worth Buying on Blueray\n3 star = Worth Watching, no alchohol required\n2 star = Watch only with alchohol/only when drunk\n1 star = Will forget in T-minus 2 seconds/minutes/day.\n0 star = dogshit\n-1 star = dogshit^2 (only movie to get this rating was Fifty Shades 2 as far as I know)
i love oringinal blade runner had this as most anticipated movie of the year, i loved the shit out of it fantastic movie
just saw it! enjoyed it actually! was sad at the end :( but beautiful effects and sounds and scenery loved it👌
Just finished it and I loved it!
Didn't like original blade runner but I thought this one was great. Have to agree about the pacing
This movie blew me away. Completely. It's amazing on every level.
Blade Runner 2049 movie review...Let me know your thoughts!\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKtsySkbfGQ
I am still digesting Blade Runner 2049. I'm leaning toward loving it, though. The pacing worked amazingly to me. There was only 1 spot in the film where I wondered how much longer and it was a brief one. I was not a huge fan of the original. I didn't connect to the characters at all but in this one, I was SO invested in Ryan Gosling's character from the first scene onward.
I disagree on the length. I though it built up nicely. I thought the last 20 minutes was the weakest part of the movie.
Overall I enjoyed the sequel but the original is still better in my opinion. My only complaint is it drags a little at times.
Original was a classic, and is beautiful - but was slow.  This movie was perfection! Not just blade runner perfection (which it was), but cinematic perfection
This movie was a convoluted mess and made me sleepy
i did not like the first one. it was a snoozed fest, i almost fell asleep. however, i adored the cinematography, it was the only good thing about that movie. but my biggest issue was the acting. omg ford was AWFUL. and the love story between them was just so stupid and out of place, he nearly raped her for god's sake.\nthis new one in the other hand i liked it so much more. the cinamatography even toped the first one, it was the most gorgeous visual experince of my life - like wow. and this one had an actual story! yeah it's still slow and simple but at least it was a story. and the acting; thank god for ryan gosling! i've never seen him doing a bad perfomance. actually everyone was great - even ford.
Have absolutely no idea what he said in the first ten seconds of the video.
You really may have answered a mystery about why Harrison Ford is doing all of these franchise reboots. If I don't do it now, someone else is going to screw it up later.
I think I would like style of this review if I had ADHD. But I don't.
An actual great movie from Sony. Shocking
Maybe don't give the replicants super strength. It'd probably be easier for blade runners to deal with them. Just saying
Didn’t like the original but actually enjoyed the sequel . Just felt more for it.
I knew this movie was going to be dope as soon as I saw the trailer during IT.
didn't like the original.... and i didn't like the sequel :s
Just like Dunkirk, this movie /review showcases Jeremy's inexperience with real cinema.   It's considered a masterpiece already by most critics and that rare, actually great, sequel.
Love the movie even more considering how against the grain it is to the typical Hollywood action sequel tendencies
I'm a fan of the first Blade Runner and I thought this one was very average.  Way too long, pacing was trash.  Story was very mediocre.  Acting and dialogue was good.  Visual were fantastic.  If you aren't a Blade Runner fan you will think this thing was absolute trash.  Just saying.  Bring a pillow to the theatre.
Guess we'll fIND OUT. The only thing I really liked in the first one was the speech towards the end in the rain and just, that guy's scenes in general? He was interesting to watch and I liked his scenes in regards to 'what is humanity?'
Have you seen the movie?\nIf yes, then you have found the best waifu we need. When i first saw her, i felt sad for K. But still she is the best waifu.
Count me as one of those guys who didn't really like the first Blade Runner (no matter how they cut it), but liked 2049. Don't get me wrong: I appreciated the original, the presentation, the effects, the deeper meaning it tried to convey, and how it influenced sci-fi. But it didn't entertain me. 2049 entertained me.
Really hate these kinda reviews.  Speeding through bullet points doesn't a review make.
Ngl I didn't like this movie
I haven't seen the original but I thought this was a good movie
It's so good. Can't wait to see it again.
how come you don't review all black movies?
Awesome, totally awesome! Buy that extra long buzz weed though, eat some hash maybe. Long movie. The kids won't have the patience for it.
AMAZING MOVIE. I haven’t even seen the original yet
Just saw it.....what a waste very disappointed  it suked
Jeremy has the type of hair you just can't stop staring at
fucking movie was a giant red herring!!!
I wasn't a fan of Blade Runner. I love Blade Runner 2049.
can you go see this movie without having seen the first one?
Thank you, Jeremy.  You are too cool!
Do I NEED to watch the first Bladerunner in orden to understand the secuel?
Just saw this! I need spoiler talk!
That piece of hair was a rebel! Vive La Résistance! ✊🏽😂
If there was an original cut that was four hours long, they should release it. As in now. Please.
Maybe I'll wait for it on dvd. The pacing in the Ridley's one killed me. I don't think I finished it. I fell asleep. And I tried so hard. I don't have high hopes for this one and I don't even like Ryan gosling. :(
Was anyone else distracted by Jeremy's strand of hair in the first half of the video? It's a like a windshield wiper for his forehead
me and my friends are all 20, never seen OG blade runner. after about 2 hours we realized we still had a long time to go and we got up and left
Jeremy, I hated bladerunner og and I LOVED blade runner 2049. Does that answer your question? The single most immersive IMAX experience I've ever had. I agree the pacing's ass and it felt 2 months long, but oh God my senses were absorbed.
Anyone else some here after Jeremy's opening to the mountain between us review
Masterfully shot. Lacking in the story department. A sheer disappointment.
OMG. I watched the review of The Mountain Between Us and I was curious about the reference in the beginning. Now I get it! It is distracting, lol.
I haven’t watched the first, but I really liked this movie! Yeah, it’s long, but I still found it enjoyable!\nThe only problem I had was that some scenes didn’t really needed to be there and a few others could have been shorter.
My own review and take on the film just went up for anyone interested
Lol.. This is the first movie that had me like.. When the fuck are you going to end?
If you need a 3 hour nap, go see this flick zzzzzzz
Blade Runner is in my Top 5.
One of best the Film Noir movie that they use to make back in 1950's.  Hollywood is back doing what it use to do best giving us a gritty detective trying find his own moral compass in a dystopian future of humanities own making.
I rewatched the original before going to see the new one. The first one is timeless, a masterpiece. The new one gets the atmosphere and the technical aspects right, but as you said, it has pacing issues and the story is not as well-thought as the original, also the ending feels kind of rushed and they leave one of the biggest plotlines unsolved. Does that mean there's gonna be more Blade Runner movies?\n\nEdit: I watched it in 3D, it was amazing...and the soundtrack is superb.
Blade Runner 2049 is far from perfect; it has some very high points (Ford, for one) and some meh...Leto for starters. If Ridley Scott was directing, he would be far more economical with scenes.
Would you say that you need to watch the original film to understand the sequel?
If you're not a fan of the original movie, can you be a fan of this movie? We'll find out tonight! I didn't hate it, but I would not say I'm a fan.
My opinion, I thought it was horribly paced and I don't think I've wanted the theater to turn down the sound volume so badly in my life...like the polar opposite when I saw Mortal Kombat for the first time during the opening sequence. Many scenes felt wasted and pointless once the end credits started rolling and to top it off very anti-climatic ending. Action scenes were great and his investigative ability was no Batman but decent. It was interesting but left far too many questions and asking myself why did it veer off into a different direction so many times that it made the previous scenes seem like they never happened. Theater was quiet beginning to end when there's usually discussion just made it that much more saddening.
I loved the first movie, but thought this one should've added more than just the one additional twist that it did and the pacing really was ass. However, it was visually stunning, fantastic acting, especially by ryan, his character was very compelling and it was a great film, but I felt that it had more potential.
I liked it. It just felt it had more of that way quiet parts more than the first Blade Runner. Which made it unnecessary for me.  But non the less I enjoyed it and liked how meta it was for the characters in the movie especially recounting the first film :3
Fuck you buddy this is an A+ masterwork.
I'll be interested to see how I feel about this movie. First time watching the original I really enjoyed it but just recently tried watching it with my wife and it felt so incredibly sloooooow.
Didnt really like it, had high expectations after hearing how good it would be.\nAs said in your review it asks similar questions part 1 already did but it was done more subtle all around and less explainy in your face than here.\n\nPart 1 had a simple setup. Here are some bad replicants search and take em out and became a movie where it asked and presented many things from the viewer to think about in a very subtle way.\nFelt here it wanted to shove it in your face it had no subtlety.\n\nThere was however an interesting hook with the digital being and I wish the movie explored that more/further instead of answering stuff from 1 which could have been just left alone.\nFlesh life of part 1 versus digital life in part 2 ..again sad it wasnt explored further.\n\nIn the end I found it forgetful, slow and bloated. \n\nAlso please stop with screaming antagonists when they are angry it feels so childish and cartoony.\n(Also boss police woman badly acted)\n\nAll in all meh. Not a bad movie but not anywhere near the original and doesnt bring anything new to the table.
Looked for comments about the loose hair. Wasn't disappointed.
Oh, good review by the way.
Just saw it...sooo good.
good movie
it was pretty boring
More satanic transhumanism propaganda
Visually stunning borefest, plot was predictable and unsatisfying
Nice review👍🏽
Terrible movie.
Horrible review!
Dat hair tho!
Cure for wellness review?
Blade Runner 1982 - 7/10\nBlade Runner 2049 - 7/10\n\nGood movies, probably both influencial but definitely not masterpieces.
Just saw it and very disappointed. So bloody slow , the plot hardly moves, focusing on the same thing with a few characters running around. Most of the audience was restless. What on earth did these reviewers with such high praises saw????
i'm sure this cupcake will taste much more exceptional since there is jemma in it (like literally, since she kinda grated her finger into the grated apple XD)
I've never matched apple and blackberry...I can't wait to try it!!
Yummy!!! But I am very anxious for halloween videos
Ooooh that looked sore! I always grate my fingers!😁
Honestly I just would like 2 likes that's all:)
Just got back from visiting the UK: I got C+D cupcakes, they were sooo good!
Everybody's good at cooking something and I'm good at cooking crumble \n\nI've got one in the oven would you like some?
Hi Jemma do u always use selfraisng flour for cupcakes and plain flour for big cakes?
Jesus Christ I missed your recipes
Planing to make ur AMAZING Oreo cupcakes
Oh my!  These look fantastic!  😋
Yum 😋
you're amazing Jemma

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do you know how to make mashmallow fulff buttercream frosting

*Unique gifts*\n*New Year gifts*\n*https://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldWorld*

No salted caramel?😔
Im earlyyyyyy!!!
Wow
Holy moly looks delish 😍👌🏻
Love from India
36th, love your chanel
To all continental Europeans who can't get treacle: I like to use sirop de Liège (boiled down fruit juice, dates, apples and pears I think) or really dark brown muscovado sugar or dates soaked in water and blended up. If someone has another idea, please tell me! \nPs: Golden Syrup is Grafschafter Goldsaft to my fellow Germans :)
Omg 😍😍😍 I need these in my life
In the southeastern US blackberries are ripe in late June-early July.
I love your shows
Hi jemma im going to visit your shop tomorrow in london. Im soo excited!😍 Gonna buy some cakes
IM NEVER THIS EARLY CAN I GET LIKES NOW?!!?😮\n\n\nno.😑\n\n(I'm kidding... this never happens and i need dem likes guys😕)
Think this one will be as popular in our house as the jammy dodger one, fruit crumble cupcakes winner winner. Thank You Jemma.
Hi Jemma! Thanks for all your videos, they're great inspiration for me. I wanted to ask you whether you could do a basics series. That would be awesome. Thanks again.
These look so yummy! And the potato ricer trick is inspired!
Oooo I hope the thumb was fake and the start of the Halloween series
Hi Jemma could please do a video on how to make macron's or if you've already made it please send a link
Lovely recipe Jemma. Cannot wait to try it. Looking forward to your video next week!
Thanks so much - now I know what I will bake at christmas for my family. Better start practising :D I I love your videos. Really happy I found you when this channel started. Ist still the best cupcake-channel out there :)
Can I use raisins instead of BlackBerry
You're everything right with YouTube.
I thought treacle and molasses were the same thing?
They look delicious and right up my alley.
I was just craving for some apple crumble!
Does your mixer have light on it?! Oh my goodness..I need that!
Jemma has sacrificed her thumb to the baking gods! This means we will have good bakes for a brief moment until the next sacrifice by someone else!
OMG those are gorgeous and I bet they taste AMAZING. Totally want to make these!!
Looks yummy! Owww on the thumb--I'm always grating my fingertips, so I know how you feel. I have to try putting apple and blackberry together--don't know why it never occurred to me before.
Hello how would you make that recipe in to vegan
What a yummy looking cupcake!  I do have one question for you Jemma, in the recipe you did not list how much flour you used in the cupcake part. Can you please update the recipe. Thank you!!
I think that the quality of the video is not as good as before
You know she's a pro because her mixer has a ring light
Poor thumb! \nI feel a little better about slicing my hand with a French mandolin now. Not by much because it hurt like a mother. But a little.
Hi Jemma! I am a huge fan, I recently started a small baking business and you are an inspiration. I am always surprised by your flavor combinations and I have tried dozens of your recipes, they always turn out splendidly! Thank you!
These look yummy! I've never mixed apples and blackberries before so I will definitely give it a go..\nBut I have a question: instead of apple, could I use raspberries or other berries for this recipe or do they have to much water? I'm a little worried that I would squeeze out all the flavour (I hope it makes sense because I'm not that good in English)
Is there an American alternative for golden syrup that isn't corn syrup?
good job need to try someday
Hey Jemma, love your vids. I know you love using tea infusions. Please try using Rooibos tea. South African product, it's life changing.
hi jemma I like apple and i love your cupcake
I love love love this yesss, so beautiful and I bet it taste AMAZING. never thought about blackberries and apples!
Gemma cupcake do you have any recipe with fresh pomegranate or maybe custard apples please
I'm having a shitty day, Jemma. Hearing your voice and watching you bake brings me joy. Thanks for being you.
What a brilliant idea to use a potato ricer!
I love your top! Where is it from?
these videos get me through the week !! thanks jemma for your baking creativity and expertise ♡☆
JEMMA THIS IS TRENDING IM SHOOK. also this look so so so yum
I won’t lie, a ring light on the arm of a stand mixer seems like the most extra, ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen, that’s probably a huge improvement on user friendliness.
Can someone convert the ingredients for me in US metrics?:)
I love your straight forward approach and quick format!  Keep on baking!
(Silently cursing why I live 1 continent away from C&D).. This looks sooo amazing, I want 1 RIGHT NOW!!
My favourite dessert in cupcake form! 😱 x
Hey Jemma.  How do you stop all the fruit sinking to the bottom
Hey jemma, you didn't state the quantity of flour in your cupcakes in the description box.
I visited your shop on Saturday, and I was so happy to see all the cupcakes! Thanks so much for such a great experience😘
Gemma!!!! Please make an amazing coffee cupcake!!!! I beg you!!!!!!
Hi Jemma, how do you find the Kenwood mixer compared to the Kitchen aid?
hi Jemma i just wanna ask if you can also feature on how to make a french macarons..=)
This looks so cute ❤ I love it !
It took me longer than i care to admit, to realise that it wasn't a siren that was going off in every video, it was Jemma opening the oven!
Can't hear Black Treacle without thinking of the Arctic Monkeys. Such a good song. I love apple anything, I'm excited to make these!!
Yes!!! You're back!!!
thats amazing thank you ,, i have always wanted a good recipe for black berries !! most appreciated !
The best as always! 😊👍
Yum! The compote filling is such a lovely addition.
Do you think this recipe could work with peaches and blueberries?
That’s looking delicious! Will give it a try👍🏻
Did anyone else think the pink buttercream looked like ham?
Hi .. I’m make buttercream but I’m failed
How could I make this vegan?
Jemma I heard recently that you don’t do apple picking in the uk, and I am devastated for you. But.. do you have apple cider donuts? Because that’s the best part of apple picking, the apple cider donuts. \nWhat I’m saying is you should make a video on apple cider donuts. 😊
I reckon it would be a great cupcake Jemma but too much work for me. I might make the cakes and ice them with a caramel buttercream ( your recipe of course). I love your channel. And your carrot cake is THE BEST.
Why on earth would a person (2 people) dislike this vid?
Omg yummmmm!!! I never would have thought of that combo with the apple and blackberries 😲💯😍👐👏🎉
Oooo I can't wait to try this!
All these added sugar is bad for your health please keep that in mind when consuming such creations
could you make something like gratin fruit cupcake. love from America
She is looking good. I luv her when she is not drunk and crazy She is a beautiful chick and talented singer
She's so pretty 💕
Teirra has been around for a long time, she's not just from love and hip hop @comments
she looks soo good, keep working hard gir !
TT out here looking like the 2005 TT, SLAYYYYYY boo yasssss.
yesss TT 😍😍, I'm really rooting for her
No shade but are they going to get any real Celebrities this season? I don’t know who the last five people have been 🙃🙃
Gorgeous!! I miss her music
I hope Teairra and Moniece can repair their friendship.
Looking good teairra 👍
She lowkey looks like Naturi aka Tasha from Power
She has lost a lot of weight and looks darn good. You can tell that rehab has help her because she looks very healthy & alert.
I felt bad when they did that but I know that they were trying to help. I was an alcoholic myself I just stop myself before going to rehab. I used alcohol to escape from reality. I would only drink on special occasions New Years, my birthday . That's about it.
She really looks bomb ❤️
every time i see her i think of mac and devin go to high school lmao
Omg! She look a lil more slim.
Y'all wasn't complaining when they had Love and hip hop Atlanta cast members on the show 🤔 it's only a week, stop complaining! She looks great and I'm happy that she was able to get herself together.
NIA AND FIZZ TRYING TO GET THAT CHECK LOL
She is one of my favs from lhhh
Awww I'm so happy for her she starting to look like the old teaira Marie
I hope she find a fine a man who a boss to treat her right
You felt like they did it for a check yet rehab was one of the best things that happen to you? Stop blaming them for your problems... it wouldn’t have been filmed if there was nothing there and I think it was helpful for ppl who are going through it. If moniece wasn’t her friend I don’t think she would have wasted her time lol I hope they become cool again
Teaira is my boo 😘❤️😍
I thought Moniece and Nikki actually cared tho
She’s so gorgeous!
is it me or are these clips just getting shorter & shorter ?
I'm rooting for Teairra. The woman has been through a lot. She is beautiful and has a great voice. I think her music post Roc-a-fella was much better, she just didn't have the right promotion behind her. I think if she gets with the right label and management to promote her, she can make a terrific comeback. If Tamar can do it, so can she. I also think that people need to be more aware of mental health, its no joke. Teairra also needs to be around more positive people who bring out the best in her. Leave toxic people like Cisco alone. I believe ppl like Nikki and Moniece really do have her best interest at heart.
funny how no one talks about the domestic violence  teairra Mari committed when she was beating on ray j multiple times? #DoubleStandards
I liked that Teairra actually spoke during girl chat and interacted with them without them having to call on her everytime. I hate when they have guest host who just sit there and don't say anything.
She had no daddy when she was growing up \nThat's why she  wild and she don't give a f**k
Please don’t turn this into a Love and Hip Hop show
Ya'll are so fucking disgusting in these comments. I'm so happy for her she is doing better and shining brightly her new album will be out this month.
I remember when her album came out with Make her feel good Phone Booth New Sh*t & etc. I use to play her album non stop. She has such an amazing voice. I wish she would've went further back then.
Teairra Mari was once protege for Jay Z back in the late 90's early 2000's.   And would have been the next big artist.  Just a few years ago just started to look up some her music just to see what she was about.  And found a lot more specially that she talented and can sing.  She can back it up and there still a lot of her tunes online.  From singles to EP's through the years.  Very impressive and she's absolutely beautiful.  You see there's more that meets the eyes about Teairra Mari she can act and does her writing if I'm correct she's  got that potential,but got shelved.  Dismissed from the industry for not being that person to do what not good for her brand.  At the beginning of her career it's like she was that it girl for a moment. But her intentions was to be an artist a triple threat who could act,dance, she even did independent stuff even major labels past on her.  She seemed like just when things were setting off for her then it's like it never happened.  Teairra Mari is like most who have the talent,but just didn't get enough push or promotion for her work.  I have admit I just started listening to lot of her early work and recent. A single titled Deserve. Which came out a little after the first season of Love And Hip Hop Hollywood ended it's season one season.  I have to say there's something about Teairra Mari she's  very talented and underrated artist in the music industry.
Some of y'all are just saying who for the likes. Like damn, the woman is opening up about rehab and this is all y'all can say. Foul..
I'm just proud to see two Detroit women on the panel at the same time we go through so much  ladies and to see that reminds me that I can make it out too
I hope she gets a permanent spot on The Real that would be nice platform for her. She is so much more than reality T.V .She is the total package she is commerically beautiful and can sing. JayZ & Def Jam records hung her out the dry over 12 years ago hopes she gets a 2nd chance in the spotlight.
TT great job!  Love her! ❤
She done lost weight and everything yasss!!! Can't wait for the reunion! #loveandhiphop
danm my bae looking so danm good so happy for her team TT
What am I supposed to do with these short ass, tiny bity ass clips? I understand you don't wanna lose TV viewers, I understand it's about money, but I live in Switzerland and if it wasnt for youtube I'D NEVER had heard/seen/known the real so can you put some respekk on our names and upload longer clips? Otherwise, I hope YOU understand when we all go back to watching Wendy.
Good for you teirra on getting help. You look better too.
What type of rehab did she go to? I don't watch love n hip hop.
Looks like she lost weight too.  Liquor can add some pounds
Right on tierra good for you I'm happy for you
Good for you Teairra 👏🏾👏🏾 And she looks like she lost a lot of weight. I was always a fan of her first album
I feel like the only talk show that has A-list celebs nowadays is Ellen so if u checking for that this the wrong show
Since some of y'all have to be schooled, I'll explain. She is Teairra Mari (her name is in the title you can Google it), Jay Z signed her to Rock A Fella the same time he signed Rihanna. She had Make A Girl Feel, her hit single from 2005 and Rihanna had just put out Pon De Replay (completely different Rih Rih from who we know now). Teairra released her debut album by then called Introducing Teairra Mari (Princess of The Roc). However, Rihanna took off more than she did. And she was eventually let go from Def Jam (this was when Jay Z had his position at the label, he was not the one who let her go). Again, this was 2005, y'all can't be this lost and dumbed down.
Didnt recognize her. Only know her from Girl Feel and that was MY SONG. still is.
Who is she lol
Who are this people? 🤔
Love Tierra and she looks beautiful   ☺I'm really routing for her success and happiness because she's so talented and extremely underrated. #itsyourtime
Hasn't changed since the movie Lottery Ticket with Bow Wow.
Put u on a pedestal for wat?
I'm happy you found help 😞
she should have gotten her hair done.but she look pretty
She look like she need to go back she look tired in the face
Why do they have whack ass love and hip hop bitches on this show. Tierra is not worth being a guest on any show. She is trash af
i wish Teairra Mari was on radio.. she's kinda kookoo for cocoa puffs but she has such an amazing voice.\nP.S people who doesn't recognize she most not have grown up in the 90s listening to R&B...
Seriously who are these random chicks?  Am I missing something? I rather they bring someone they've already had.
I just remember her doing the Destiny Child's cover with Rihanna and Amerie. And Beyonce was looking at 'em side ways. I love Amerie, but only one of them from the 3 still relevant...
She looks different and beautiful
I still listen to her first (and only?) album.
Her teeth look different, is it just me?
Y’all we need to give a big shout out to her her best friend moience for pushing Tierra to go to rehab
I remember her for being a very pretty pop singer signed to jay-z label.\n\nI next saw her on LHHNY where she was the one trying to stop the other girls from fighting.\n\nThis was crazy to see her acting out on LHHHW I almost felt it was fake. It was like she acted like a completely different girl.\n\nBut I guess was real once you end up in rehab.\n\nGlad to see she doing better.
Tt look like she need a drink no shade.. bad hair day
Stop with the love and hip hop guest
I miss this show today did she  talk about her MUSIC or is we waiting until next season again ????
Lol I thought she was Naturi at first in the thumbnail 🙂💅🏾
Only 59 comments its to early ill come back when swaggpro and glitzygirl around they messy but great
I love her 💙💙💙💙 so proud
Please Subscribe To Me !
yesss TT 😍😍, I'm really rooting for her
TT keep pushing through love.
Who is this ?
Good for her ❤
TT kinda looks like Ashanti right here!!!
Gorgeous lady
I'm glad Teairra overcame her struggles. I understand why she may have turned to alcohol. She had a few bumps in the road. Her Warner Bros deal didn't work out for her even tho she had a hit with Sponsor and releasing several successful EPs, then her situation with producer Rico Love fell thru (after releasing U Did That which also was a record that was gaining steam). Then going thru her tumultuous relationship (s). I'm glad she overcame all of that.
Second 🙌🏻🎉
Second😍
First 🙌🏾
TT doing & looking great❤❤❤
please i don't care about these irrelevant z listers. bring on the idris interview with loni! and you better upload it all!

She kinda look different 🙃🤔
Yes Tearri Mari.
She looks great!
this chick is crazy!
Oh darn, gigglyfitz isn't here yet...anywho, You go Teairra!!!
I guess losing to Rihanna really hit her hard. Well, glad she's better!
You guys should have a Bad Girls Club week! That should be interesting
Looking beautiful TT
She's be drinking by next week
Please be Careful Leaving her on the Bed on her own.. I'm only Saying as a first mum 5 years ago I left my son And he Shocked me and fall off!! So just a tip from mother to mother. Not Judging as I have done it.. She may be Young atm but she could also Shock you. I love you're little family! I would hate for her to shock u and she fall  or something u will feel Horrbile I know I did :( xx

Jack's dab isnt good enogh
.
this is the sort of cancer i signed up for
Lol the birkenstocks tan on his feet
The dab is dead
0:33 FUCK U HE CAN DO IT
i loved the millionaire music
2016 called, it really wants to keep dabs in the vicinity of its time-line, and every time a person does a dab a baby rabbit gets snatched up by a hawk. The longer you do it, the longer the pain and torture of the baby rabbit until its demise. Donate at least 1 cent to the stop the dab foundation STDF in short, to really make a change in our unintelligent, thought dwindling, baby booming psychotic society.
i'll only be impressed if he does it for an hour
obviously fake, there's no way.
*who wants to be a millionaire music plays*
Some things were not made to exist
Is this the prequel-sequel to My Longest Yeah Boy Ever
I can do it better
Well I just wasted 58 seconds of my life
can he do it;can he finish the dab,i don't think so and neither does anyone else; fuck him XD
Can we have an unedited version?

THE PERFECT GUY DOESN’T EXI—
How does this video compare with other YouTube videos you have watched this week?\n\n☑︎ One of the best videos\n☐ A great video\n☐ About average\n☐ Below Average\n☐ One of the worst videos
I watched a 15 second ad for this? ... Worth it.
This is the funniest criticism I have ever seen😂😂😂😂
I want to die. Dabbing is the worst fucking trend to ever exist! I love Jacksfilms, but I cant stand watching this. I have never dabbed and fuck whoever does it
anyone else notice the tan lines on his feet (they look like they're from sandals)
Who gave this kid a camera
Can we get this to be an Olympic sport?
John what the actual fuck.
YOU DIDNT HIT THE FLOOR JACK
So this is considered comedy? Huh, thought comedy was supposed to be funny. Maybe try to milk that emoji movie more that wasnt funny either but hey at least its a little better than this.
He's not fast enough?
Honestly he already at like the second mark
This video was sponsored by Calvin Klein!
WHOMST WANTS TO BE A DABILLIONAIRE?
waste of my f@@#king time!!!!
Why are you like this?
My gosh. I can only dab for a short 12 seconds.
Hey Jack, what are your thoughts on Jaiden Smith's new anime?
What brought me to this side of YouTube...?
Even your dog is ashamed of you
I looked away he almost died, what a hero.
This is literally impossible
I enjoy the fact that the channel keeps trending towards shitposts
Just why did I click on this
Omg I have that same rug 😂
I really hope you do more skits like these, this was pretty clever. Top 10 videos with Erik are the best too
He’s getting a Vac van
can't believe I just watched this
My ad was longer than the video 😂
He's not fast enough
Bambam is going to have to step up his game.
Well darn, the big boy did it. He diddly-done did it.
The way your dog looks at you with disappointment is how I hope my kids look at me one day when I do cringey memes.
Shit I looked away. Did he do it??
But what if the habbers bad dack?
This is why I'm subbed
Men we have made it to the final frontier

Question: how did you guys meet on 2009 and Louise was 4 months pregnant when darcy is 6
I love these videos, love the spontaneity❤️ ‘DON’T..I’VE WEED A BIT’

Re watched the part when Joe scares you over and over again. It's hilarious. 'Ive weed a bit'😂😂
I loved this video so much hahahah
I was cry laughing at Louise's reaction to Joe scaring them 😂😂
I LOVE the not-worth-watching videos.
Love watching videos of both of you! xx
This is honestly one of my favourite videos 😂
Such great video with lots of Cameos xx
I've missed you both together
I miss these types of videos. Shows you don't always need the fancy cameras, background set, lights and a challenge
MUKBANG (the word Zoe mentioned) is a Korean word meaning 'eating show', where you eat food in front of a camera and talk usually
This is one of my favorite videos of you guys😭❤️🙌🏼
What do you use to do your thumbnails xx
This takes me back, the two of you make me laugh so so much
Watching a video where you both listen to K pop would be epic
You need to do more of these!!!
Love that this was unedited! So fun

Um....this was the best video ever wtf. Lol.
This was so funny 😂 and does anyone know where zoe's yellow coat is from in this? Its rly nice
I enjoyed this so much. I rarely see youtubers that dont edit their video for a main channel but I honestly love it! Love how natural and comfortable you guys are together ❤
This is my favourite gleam video ever
you guy used​ to vlog to each other
I hope we see more candid videos from youtubers. It becomes a revolution . It's original because it's genuine life which is different to others
I WEED A BIT! OMG I LOST IT
i love you gals so very much ♡♡♡
When Zoe started singing the only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage I squeal like the little fan girl I am
If Louis wasn't expecting, I'd think that you were smoking the funny cigarettes 😉
Uhm, question... If they first met in 2009 and Louise was pregnant. How come darcy is born in 2011? Did she have a miscarriage I don't know of?
Lol joes so funny and such a nice guy too 😊
Please put up that video Zoë!!

That shit was hilarious!
caw
SAY YOUR\nSWEARS &\nDRINK YOUR\nBEERS,\nMOTHER\nFUCKER!
Avgn should review snes oscer
my favorite Nerd episode
Amazing!
MONOWAR
Nerd is losing hair :(
STRONG BAD!
EPIC OPENING LOL
i'll give you one fuckin guess
So that's where Homestar Runner got that..
James my friend it's getting close to the time when you have to stop combing it over and just buzz it nice and clean.
Which one had the NWO on SNES?
Intro song really reminds me of Trey Parker
I'd argue that SNK is the king of fighting games. :)
Please do a part 2!!!
All those bad wrestling games and NOT ONE MENTION of The Simpsons Wrestling?
Lol nerd u the best
The front cover of Wrestlemania Challenge it's sad that only 1 out of 5 wrestlers on the picture are still alive..
i’ll give you one fucking guess
My and my buddy used to play the hell out of that LJN SNES wrestling game LOL
Doink as It…\n[ I got no words ]
RAW is actually a decent game with a lot of different modes. Plus it had a good roster for the time(Luger, Yoko, Shawn Michaels, Diesel, The Hart Bros, Luna Vachon, Bam Bam, Undertaker, 123 Kid, Doink, Razor Ramon and Crush as unlockable) all with signature moves and the themes were always fun to play. It's aged kinda bad but it's still fun and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAy better than Wrestlemania on NES
We all know the best wresting game was Def Jam Fight for NY
Was that a Homestar reference?
Nerd u should've reviewed N64 wrestling games as well.  They had some pretty good ones like WCW/NWO Revenge and Wrestle mania 2000.
Wow he's got a flat screen where did the CRT TV's go???
Who _are_ these people?
So you use a Stone Cold line but no n64 games? You need to do a James and Mike Mondays with No Mercy for N64.
You could have looked up the controls.
Tbh my favorite WWF wrestling game is WWF Attitude! My child was spent playing that shit even after I got a ps2, I had to let it go after smackdown hctp.
Is he going back to a bi weekly schedule? if so that would be amazing.
I cannot believe you prefer WrestleMania The Arcade Game. It's complete garbage. You really aren't a wrestling game fan lol.. Royal Rumble and RAW for SNES and even Sega are some of the best wrestling games ever. And the best by far until Warzone. My friends and i still play them.
Tecmo's wrestling game was pretty fun, but you had to pick the character with the most moves in order to win. They should have made it so that you design your own character who can learn more techniques the more matches he wins. That's it! I'm copywriting my idea and taking it Vince McMahon!
Saturday Night Slam Masters was the best game! I wish there was new games for that series
I think the only LJN game I ever had growing up was Roger Clemens MVP Baseball for SNES. It's a solid game for the time.
Is the AVGN's finisher the ASS Bomber?
Winner is strong bads!?\n\nI'm getting home star runner flashbacks here...
Is the tattoo real?
he's really pumping them out lately, its been awhile since that's happened.
I wonder how much that cartridge suit is gonna go for at auction
Wrestlemania Royal Rumble and Wrestlemania the Arcade Game for SEGA eas pretty good! I spent a lot of time playing that games =) in 2000s =)
WCW Superbrawl had good characters, just the gameplay was terrible
I can’t believe you still get this many views, good for you damn
MAH ALL THE GODS FUTURES IM BALLS LIVE LIKE  A WINDRAMMER AS YOU FUCK
those SNES ones were great
Great episode glad a new one is here watched the making of an avgn episode a couple times and really appreciate the work.
I wonder if the AVGN videos get demonetized?
If James doesn't want to use the old theme song then  he and Kyle should just write a new one. I think it could be even better than the original.
I remember renting saturday night slammasters when i was a kid. had like 120 dollars in late chargers. I loved  it. I got blisters on my thumbs from all the mashing that game required.
The ending was the best part of the episode.
Nerd , you forgot a wwe game that glitches the fuck out. But nice vid and keep going
When you started talking about Strong bads, I was kind of hoping you would make a joke about Homestar Runner.........
WWF Superstars arcade from the 80's is the best wrestling game I've ever played by far, kinda plays like double dragon crossed with slammasters.
Thanks for the production qualty, raising the bar for youtube here.
Me: Imma watch Nostalgia Critic's new episode.\n*Sees new AVGN episode*\nMe: Fuck the Critic.
YES! Saturday Night Slam Masters. i used to rent that game all the time as a kid.  T. Hawk is in it too.  but his name is Titan.
what happened to the Rolling Rock, :0 !!
CAN YOU DO EOE EVE OF EXTINCTION FOR THE PS2!!???
I almost got pissed that Saturday Night Slammasters wasn't included and then I heard that awesome title music
Saturday night slammasters was my shit back in the day!
I have super wrestlemania if that is....good
Why didnt you play WWF no mercy or any of the Attitude era games
I have the same dragon tattoo JAJAJAJA
Damn that hairline is depressing. I been watching him since day one and just crazy to think how many years have passed by
Wrestlemania the arcade game was the worst. I hated that game with its unrealistic bullshit. Raw and Royal Rumble were the best
Winner is Strong Bads... Seriously? What's next? Winner is Homestar Runners?
::CHEERS WILDLY:: me and my friend used to play Tecmo World Wrestling and pretty much MST3Ked the whole thing.  we'd name ourselves things like PigDung and the announcer would go HE SINKS AN ELBOW INTO PIGDUNG , which of course brought gales of laughter.  i so hope this gets brought up (haven't watched yet)
N64 had some of the best wrestling games.
the THQ N64 series of wrestling games are easily the greatest of all time. Fuck outta here with here comes the pain and the other PS2 smackdown sequels. the worst is WCW Thunder on ps1 by a mile. look it up for clarification.
How about the next episode is about crappy knockoff consoles like the PolyStation and X-Game360?
South park and avgn are back
Hogan always had his necklace and cross charm on. That's why it was his powerup.
Royal Rumble and Raw are actually good games on the SNES.
I’ll give you one fucking guess.
Play Pac-Man please everyone making play Pac-Man get angry at Pac-Man , if Pac-Man's new adventure get mad at it really angry. Please.
Remember the 1 LJN game that didn't suck? Spider Man remembers :3
Monday night Nitro on ps1 was pure ass compared to N64 wrestle mania! But GameCube wrestle mania still kills every game to this day... you could actually hit people while they’re grabbing someone else which made you pay crazy attention! Imagine working hard to get your special and while you trying to use it another player knocks you the fuck out of it!
The Undertaker shooting out ghosts and slamming you with grave stones.\nYou have my attention. Okay, I definitely need to play this game some time!
Oh god james, you're losing your hair so bad....
those NES games do look pretty bad, LOL
Never giving up my second amendment tho
AlJaazera im Disappointed in You Guys ,Im going back to RT
There are more the two shooters!!!! Show the countless videos with two distinct and different distance gun shots.  False flag for gun grab.
No one is talking about the woman who warned them they were going to die that night weird?
A.J., be the first network to demand the hotel security video footage, of him loading up the room with 20 AR modified full auto rifles.  and the entire 2 hour before- during -after hallway cam, on 32nd floor.  You could gain credibility as a network. simply demand the footage, till they turn it over.
This is unacceptable let's drop some bombs on Afghanistan and teach them a lesson!!
What about the flashing lights on the 12th floor?? Plenty of videos showing it
Sin city
americans who support owning automatic  weapon - seem to have the wisdom of a conesnail
Will you let them rest my god. I'm sick of hearing about this. None of the news networks care about the people who died all they want is ratings and to exploit and profit from their deaths.
He wanted to be on the fbi most wanted list, like dad  who betrayed him and his family bank robbing
she very old woman she .my grandma just 55year's old she is 64..she is from Philippines..??
I live in Las Vegas it's was not only one shooter and why the news not showing or tell the people that there are 3 windows busted out on different floors
He wasn't alone in that hotel room. Media is hush about this
There's no shortage of conspiracy fuckwits posting in the comments. Sad.
Weapons aren't the problem. There is very manipulative, smart, evil people out there who will go through any means necessary to kill a large amount of people for no real reason at all.. Most people who do mass shootings like this are patient and they plan ahead, if we were to SOMEHOW stop EVERYONE from getting hands on a automatic rifle then these crazy people will just learn how to make Bombs to kill people instead. Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\n\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.
That is pretty weird that multi millionaire would go on a shooting spree so randomly
Excuse me but I need to puke!! 😷 This makes me very sick.
NO! The CIA did
What a time to live in.
How sad! My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims. I knew some people and celebrities who attended the Life Is Beautiful Music Festival. Scary to think what he may have had planned for that Music Festival.
The type of people who used to rant about Pizza Gate now have a lot of theories about the Vegas shooting.
if we don’t change gun regulation laws. this will only get worse.
I think there was more than one shooter. Always will
Comments on videos like this remind how stupid so many people are
On 4chan weeks before the shooting an anonymous person warned against a big attack in Las Vegas. This man is a patsy. No motive because he wasn't motivated. He somehow carried 20 guns into a hotel room by himself. Many say there were two shooters. He was probably a gun runner and got used as a patsy, killed before the shooting ever took place. Look it up.
This title is annoying😂😂
stop referring to this terrorist as the gunman he is a terrorist say it a radical white terrorists
White policeman's jobs and not hard you're never in danger. When all your job is to do is shoot down black people you're not human
Who chooses these events next to buildings like that how do you not see that as a security nightmare
the woman knows something  Hould her  till u get the true form her
My heart goes out to those in Vegas
Notice the reporters head is perfectly covering the shot out windows? But why?
Why aren't reporters asking, why he chose a venue full of T🤡rump supporters, red necks and nationalist??? As he obviously didn't attack the other concerts full of hippies, minorities and gays!
White guy killing white people.  No problem.   Great news.
BUMP-STOCK, bump-stock !! not quite so sexy .  IT'S A START !
more media bullshit, trying to take our minds off other questions...
This was far worse than September 11th, because it was no way an attack on government, but pure murder.
The Shooter is dead, just drop the investigation, you will get nothing but wasted time
As I read on Moore and more I think we might need more of these shootings just to bring the stupid lvl back to tolerable.
Wait the title of the video doesn’t connect to the video
Living a secret life... \n\nSo privacy is secret now??
The patsy was a likely innocent too. If you don't say this was a false flag you are either lying or you're an idiot.
This is MSM trying to make the bullshit somehow more plausible. Consservative type guy, owns 20+ guns attacking a country music festival? He really doesn't seem the type to be targetting the patriottic White people associated with country music festivals. Things don't add up in the slightest. Then there's the report of a woman that got carried away harrassing people saying you're all going to die. Why aren't we hearing more of that? Have they found this (apparently hispanic) couple thatt said that yet?  I think this is a massive false flag or cover up. Someone from a (((protected group))) targeted White Americans in the most savage way and they don't want to deal with the backlash of people realizing where it came from ad what goes behind all that. Some Antifa J$w or Black guy. They then framed some old White guy they had scoped out. This is speculation. Of course. But it seems more plausible than what is being told. Look at the Lavon affair.
I encourage those interested in this event to evaluate: is it real? Are we being presented with a fictional reality TV event? \nHow would you know? You could watch the interviews with witnesses, survivors, and victims' families closely. Are their actions and behaviors indicative of real people showing real grief and emotion...or do they appear as bad actors repeating a script?
Don't let them take your guns
Go back to bed America. You are free to do as we tell you. -- BH
Yearly 30.000 Americans get killed by guns. More than in 44 European countries combined. The US also has the highest Infant mortality rate of all modern industry countries. America can be proud !!  👍
Government planned the attack.
This could be like that movie shooter ! Gov set uo
No rime or reason to this madness. Whatever his motives were he took along with him.
Where in the world can you find mass shooting become a regular occurence? Almost all shooters were white. But no one blamed their white families. Now you have a white shooter with a non-american, non-white girlfriend who is on the other side of the world when it happened and yet her photo is everywhere like she was the one holding the gun. Hmm.. something is NOT right.
This channel is liberal propaganda
I gained 2 IQ watching this and lost about 5 after reading the comments and an addition 5 pressing view all replies. -.-
Kill hitler or stop the Mad Man
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist
Government set up
Al jazeera is ISIS propaganda
Why is a terrorist news channel trending ? Just more proof that Youtube is completely biased towards Democrat causes and fakes the whole trending thing. It's not an algorithm, it's the extreme leftists at Youtube manipulating views, likes and your perceptions.
No but his brother did.
God forbid but imagine if he had a Gernade launcher or other explosives
I'm still waiting on the footage of him checking in the hotel and walking around the casino to see if he had with anybody else (accomplice) with him.. there's no way he could have done this completely on his own
Sad to say... This topic will blow over in 2 weeks and we'll be talking about the kardashians again
Such great jihad will take place in the next three weeks, and within a year, there will be at least five times, Pado, the great hero! Great holy warrior! Heaven has your place!
Something definitely seems fishy about all of this. This has inside job written all over it
Calling this a false flag is so incredibly disrespectful to the friends and family members of those who were killed in this terrible event
Scripted.....
Madsteven
🏴
Gun control..
la la muchi la la muchi midnight
Nobody died , no body cried 🐧
Multiple shooters
Al jazeere trending wtf
Bullshit news
FALSE FLAG
FALSE FLAG wake up America
Yes He did
Terrorist

Fake News
silly clown.
omg...
Catalonia\nPalestine\nScotland\nKosovo\nKurdistan
She knew.
Sin City style
😔😔
🚫BAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!\nBAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!🚫
What happened in real was an FBI weapon deal with ISIS went wrong, Isis found out paddocks with the government and decided to either take him hostage and carry out the shooting or killed him and carried out the shooting...wondering why they not releasing cctvs of the casino.? Imagine if the public find out that it was an FBI -ISIS weapon deal gone wrong. SO now that paddock is killed he became the suspect for a while until the videos of multiple shooters came out. WAKE UP PEOPLE
So the killer was 'white'. Hope you know that Trump.
a 64 yearold man didnt carry 20k rounds of ammo and weapons up to his floor. plus one of his mental issues where from mk ultra. how i know? because various peoole who have been put threw it also had same issues.
Stupid whites always doing mass shootings
Why was she stacking her belongings on top of her as if she were moving, as reported by her neighbors
Conspiracy theories are simply a way for mouth breathing retards to feel like they're smart.
Maybe the guy was annoyed by the music and started to kill everyone! Maybe he likes rock
He was white . that's enough explanation
wait! Isn't Al Jazera the terrorists main channel for getting their message out? Why is this allowed on YouTube?
Way to good statement I know philipinos don't talk the way that lawyer talked
Chance the rapper concert??all he does is help others tho!!
Why is there even a thumbs down button on the comments? Somebody... please explain???
Still a waste ! Nobody's buying Chromebooks !
My old Nexus 10 has a higher res screen. Feels good man.
Can it run (insert any pro app)? Oh ok 😒✌️. Crazy over priced for what it's capable of doing in real world use. Specs and design are irrelevant if you can't do much with it. May as well get an android tablet. Don't buy something on the promise of what it MIGHT be able to do in the future.
Dang, I wish I had waited before buying a Samsung Chromebook Pro earlier this year! This thing clearly has better specs and subjectively is much more attractive than the Samsung. Then again, would it really do that much more as a Chromebook?
My Acer Chromebook works fine for $240. I'm all set.
if Google would release a google branded version of desktop linux on a chromebook and get developers interested in developing more mainstream apps for linux (photoshop, etc) then this would DESTROY apple and wintel machines
The pixelbook looks awesome as it is really suite for a terminal use. The ability of running android app makes it good for light-weighted entertainment need. It would be a plus if it is detachable, but i'm OK with current design. The only drawback to me is the price is too high compare to other Windows as it lacks the ecosystem windows established.
Can we write a letter\sentences (in English) and have something convert it like OCR.
100% copy of the Microsoft Surfacebook and that Pen is all a copy of Microsoft. Hp Spectre looks very similar, too. No SD card slot. Lol. 😂 🤣
It is as sexy as useless.
God damn those bezels are huge. If you buy this and want to resell it down the road good luck convincing someone to pay you a fraction of the cost.
No!! It's ridiculous and expensive... It's only for rich dumb kids!!! No thanks!!!
Everything is book now a days
Seriously, who wants a touchscreen on their laptops? I will never get it, screen wobbles, it gets fingerprint smudges in no time, and you'll always be more precise with a mouse anyway.
well if phones cost 1000 dollars now, why not this laptop just because there are companies out there making extremely over priced products does not mean every procuct should be over priced dipshit. What a terrible video.
now I can play cool math games at 144 fps
Overpriced laptop with unusable OS.
Song @2:15 please?
B E Z E L S
Omfg hungry truly    looks  deeply way-ryx reserve
Can anyone plz tell me that, whether a video editor can be installed on the pixelbook... like final cut pro or similar software
Is this video an ad for google? It sounds like one especially with all the new google-products placed. Smells like product placement.
Looks neat! But the price...
that glass surface looks good
what about strength and durability?
Am i the only one who feels like if the ChromeOS is perfected and can run Android apps smoothly then Windows is in trouble?
Always some compromise or another. Missing SD card slot and too powerful (yes) CPU. The Acer Chromebook R13 get +12h worth of battery life with a Mediatek ARM CPU. It's powerful enough for Chrome OS. The Samsung Chromebook Plus is half the price (but is unfortunately not sold in many regions) and still carries a stylus, can be used as a tablet, etc.
If it can't run Adobe,\nthen it ain't fo me.
Great product your presentation is fantastic just the perfect balance between facts and your expert opinion.
How does this compare to Samsung Chromebook Pro?
Can you say thermal throttle???  You will never see high performance from chip
chrome os is famous for and hallmarked by its lightweight and affordable. fulfilling people's simplest and most labored daily task, like tediously typing, web browsing, sometimes video streaming and light gaming--I don't do games even on my smartphones but people do, many folks would compensate and yield some laptop's functionalities for a little bit better experience of basic performance, I think that's understandable because I tried several chrome books before and they all performed well in terms of aforementioned things. however, misjudging from their ideal concept that people will buy some so-called high-end Chromebooks they are fond of in the past is just an absolute mistake. personally, for instance, I only do care Chromebooks because it is cheap and stable performance, therefore I would not even have a glimpse of thinking to buy a Chromebook if the price is barely equal to a real laptop, let alone this pixel book's astronomical overpriced AF. aesthetically, this book is gorgeous looking but that's it. unless chrome os or, you could generally say android app store can evolve someday to catch up with windows os, there will never be any reasonable logics to get a Chromebook over a real laptop at this price, ever.
for what is the storage if you cant download movies on it or use with applikations like Android. there are some Android Apps that support RAW files example LR or PS.
Why does a Chromebook need an i7? Who would spend $1600 on a Chromebook?
One thing that people fail to notice is the longevity of these things. Yes they are not as productive as Windows or Mac, but they will easily last you for 7+ years without stuttering on what they do.
Don’t understand why you wouldn’t compare it to the existing laptop books on the market. Also the pricing is a bit extreme, you can get an XPS, Surface Pro, our MacBook for close to the same price.
Does the Chromebook support Photoshop the same as Windows ?
Biased ... why is he not mentioning the damn screen, and mos def the humongous bezel!
if it only was run by Win10.....
Why put a mobile grade i7 into basically an enlarged android with few extra features. No one is gonna render their video or play graphically intense game on this. Although I do dig the aesthetics
Why an i7? What possibly could you do within chromeOS that needs that power?
Like he said, if a phone can cost $1000, then why not a Chromebook? I can see this being amazing in the future.
Am I the only one drooling over the fact that it has the potential to become an amazing Linux convertible?
Do you reckon I could play pc games on that thing? 😂
Isn't it annoying when you touch the display and it bounces back like that all the time?
I want it give me pls ;-;
Why use an x86 processor? If you want the best combination of power and efficiency, then ARM is the way to go.
What's with that glossy screen?
If I cannot do development on that Device, I am not buying.
That bezel can handle a Aircraft
That's one sexy lappy🙄
I think the reason why Google chose to do this is because this is their way of revamping the Pixel C and the Chromebook Pixel 2 in one product. That price though. $1,650 for the maxed out model. The second option of the base Macbook costs $1,599.00.
I have sold countless laptops and the biggest question to ask yourself when trying to understand a product before selling it is: who would buy this and why? I have not come up with any answers for this laptop other than: an idiot and because they’re stupid. i5/128gb for $1000? It must have great design and build quality then! Oh wait nvm look at those huge bezels and chrome OS? What a joke.
No multitasking with an i7 and 16 gb or ram? Lmao...
Too wide of a bezel for laptops in 2017, and a pretty much useless kind of laptop that revolves around the world of Google Chrome browser alone. Remix OS (which is an Android-based desktop computing OS) is still way better than Chrome OS. Not gonna compare this to Windows because that would be unfair. Chrome OS does not even beat a laptop operating on Windows Vista.
About as useless as an iPad is. There's no reason to have a fast desktop-class processor just so you can run dumbed down mobile apps designed for fat fingers.
It's great... for a Chromebook.
The design is wow! It's better than pixel 2 design. But.... Still I think not good for most people from inside
$99 on a pen! B R U H
Beautiful laptop, but sad is runs Chrome OS.
if your 2k$ pc don't run all games due to odd software, PASS!
The Surface Pro keyboard is 1.3 mm travel...
WHY?! Why not throw windows on it. I would throw my money at google. Stop pusing chrome OS, its for emerging markets and low end laptops, not a powerhouse laptop like this.
Not useful if it's not windows 10
Anyone know where to find that wave desktop wallpaper?
you can get a good ass pc for half the price, but whatever
Now that I've finally found a lightweight windows machine, I very recently started hunting for a Chromebook, once again. \n\nThis machine evidently looks to have excelled in all the areas the Samsung Pro failed, all except for one, ironically, its power.\nWhy couldn't google release a core M chip variant, after all the different notebooks and hybrids that have successfully incorporated the 6th and 7th gen core M's? Going with a core M would have captured so much more of the market, and even as a Linux user, via crouton, I'd have been very happy with as low as an M3, never mind an M5 or 7.\n\nI understand this is following suit of the Pixel Line(As fuzzy a line as it may be), but the fan-less trail blazers that are the Core M chips have come a long way since 2015, and I can't imagine why, as a bottom tier device, the core M wouldn't have sufficed. \n\nIt's incredibly frustrating how this looks to be so much of what I, and as I imagine a lot of other people, loved about the Flip C302 and the Samsung Pro, all thrown together into one expensive device.
Can I install Linux on it?
somebody plz help, why are ppl or companies buying chrome books? particularly, ones that are more than a real laptop... do these ppl know that chromebooks cant do anything their phone cant? or can chromebooks do something? I honesty want to understand.
99 more dollars for a stupid stylus I'm mostly going to loose lmao
This would only be good to buy if you want to use it as a linux machine
It is pretty, I'll give them that.
But how are these apps developed? Certainly not on a Chromebook.
Those bezels and that price tag lmao this is garbage
Microsoft working hard to release its apps to chrome OS and Google does nothing to bring its apps to Windows 10 store
There are no Fans.....so I guess it'll fry in a year tops
Suddenly, MS Surface Laptop seems more attractive now....
You'd be better of with the Lenovo yoga book 10.1
Google can't mine your personal files/data if you have an SD card slot silly >_>
Not worth spending $1000 on a laptop that runs chrome os.

Guys, you're missing the potential. This would make a great Linux machine.
you know it'd be cool if they can help chrome os with installing programs like iTunes, files, etc... then chromebooks would be way more worth it.
Thats a lot of money for a tablet
so it's like a MacBook Air, but with a better resolution and a touch screen
It's a  5 watt Core i7, the one Intel rebranded Core M to, so not really eyebrow raising to have no fan.
Them bezzels are THICCK AF!!
mac
Woow look asesome!
Ugly
Why Google and Apple loots us?
garbage
Waste of money
Ugh ugly ugly uglybook. What a $1000 joke.
Chromebook? Ewww...
Stop copying Apple!
Comparison with the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro?

As a doggie mom I can't stress how important grass is for puppers!! obviously it isn't a necessity for dogs, but it's so much nicer for them to play in. Please get a house with some grass in the backyard 😩 so happy for you!

3:25 hero 5 looks better!
The 5 is better
The microphone definatly improved
Pause at 5:00
give me the gopro hero6 plzzzzzz
Iphone 8 plus wins
why are the pictures of the gopro hero 6 so dark
Test the new Sony RX0 plz!! 👍🏻
The hero six is realy dark
that not a _Big _*_Hero 6_*
Is it just me or is the audio on hero 5 alot better.
i think the hero 5 captures more light
The iPhone looks _way_ better in the slo-mo... and just in general. Hmmmmm
spend as little time as possible in preparing for shoot. is this a vlog? didn't realize that. I need to prepare myself when I watch this channel.
Way better on the iPhone
The hero 5 is freakingly better\n\n*my opinion
The iPhone is sooooooooo much better, crazy how phones are now better than cameras 😂💜
I prefer the 5... THe audio seems nicer
You make the go pro also look bad with your shit reviews..stick to your ishit #theoverreatinapplebitch
Has a video on the hero 6, brings in hardware from 1 year ago to hate on it and acts like a fan. Makes it on trending after google releases their camera thats going to fail, and then has horrible production quality. Just doesn't add up as I love how the absolute worst video on this camera that could of been made was used. Thats why it made trending
Hero 6 looks darker! Could be a setting or something in post editing causing it.
worse review ever.
it looks so nice😍😍😍😍
Dose anyone know her youtube channel?
slow mo is choppy ... iPhone better?
4:27 song name??
I have a couple of the GoPro sessions ( the older version ) what GoPro needs is to have a zoom option the camera is great wide angle but sometimes it would be nice to zoom in a bit to things
This was a iPhone 8 is better the GoPro Hero 6 video in disguise
I vote for go pro hero 5 (like)
I thought I unsubscibed from your channel 4 years ago....wtf??
What do you suggest to buy GoPro 5 or 6 ???
Hello I ask you since 2011, do porn
Since I bought my Sony xperia XZ I want everything USB C too but I've had like 6 devices since, all micro USB. Nooo!
Why the hell (Sorry) do you play it back at 25% 😂 To take advantage of 240 Frames in a 30 FPS youtube Video you have to play it at 12,5% (240/30) this already made me klick away the iPhone Camera test so please fix it please 😁
بدي الترجمة عالعربي😭😭😭
iPhone takes better images and videos
nice job -- and who knew IJ had juggle skillz!
*Unique gifts*\n*New Year gifts*\n*https://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira*
I prefer the iPhone 8 plus
Ciao ev best
React to the Google pixel 2
Worst video ever
Oooohh
yay trending!
The slowmo in the gopro is shit
A big hero 6?
Eh, I'd smash.
omg it's trending
You are chooooo cute😚
Hero 5 has better lighting
I am big fan ofu
radddddd
I love you💜💜💛💛💚💚💙💙💟💟❤❤💖💖💗💗😃📷💎💒💐
So GoPro is the new Apple, same design 🤔😅
The Hero 5 and Iphone look better than the Hero 6 LMAO Wtf #GoPro
The Iphone8+ footage looks a lot better, but come on, the iphone8+ cannot be used in similar conditions where a gopro Hero 6 can be used!! But Its great to see this comparison!! Good job there IJustine!
How's the stabilization on that six versus the five?. I still have my hero 4. I'm also starting my vlogging with the GoPro.
Without makeup Justine would look like an ugly old bitch. Damn this old bitch still does tech reviews😂😂 LOL can’t believe YT pays her so much for this shit..
The Go Pro Hero 5 looks better then the 6
Do something with ro
It sux lk u
Iphone 8 looks a lot better tbh.
HERO 5 looks better

Why does the Hero 5 camera seem to look better?🤔🤦‍♂️😂
My god Justiiineee! I love it when you look straight into the camera, it's like you look directly into my eyes. It makes me blush a bit though :P Great video!
cool video, i love making videos with my drone, also do GoPro vids, going to be uploading my next hand slap video in around a week :) thanks for sharing 👍🤓
I love this place!!
Hello ijustine great editing what do you use and what's good for a beginner to edit videos.
The crazy go pro lady 😂😂😂 love you Justine
Make a what is on my iPhone 8
Don't you need to add a review?
In my opinion, not sure if it has to do with HEVC quality for the GoPro, but both the iPhone and Hero 5 are far better than the Hero 6.
Adding to your comment about being USB C charging.  If you kept all your accessories from your Samsung Note 8 unboxing you can use the the small dongle adapter with your old micro USB cable.  I use my old micro USB cable with the dongle adapter.  It's a 5 ft cord from my note 4.  I hate the short cord that they give now.
What happened to the contrast on Hero 6?,the IPhone 8 plus camera looks way better than Hero 6.The Hero 6 fps is pretty nice but thats about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORfeupQnEZo&t=187s like video for a free GoPro hero 6
I noticed the color on the 5 if better than the 6. Is that Protune? or other settings changed?
I wish she could toss my balls around like that.
So its a bigger version of the GoPro 5 then?
What will be new in cooking videos. :) Most of your cooking videos are full of horrors. We are very used to it so let's see... \n\nP.s. They are fun.
The hero 5s video was better
The 240 fps on the Hero 6 looks really bad.. not sure if that was conversion or something?
I think the GoPro hero 5 is better than the 6
I hope for the sake of the Hero it was the codex conversion. There seems to be a lot of artifacts and even maybe some frame drops on the Hero 6. The iPhone was smooth and captured the video with much more clarity and brightness. I guess we’ll see with future videos.
Gotta love how simple and nice her videos are
what's the music name?
waiting for the review on the fusion!
Can you do a darker background? Like UnboxTherapy, it's much more relaxing for the eyes!
The hero 5 looks better to me
Hope they have longer battery life
Wow, the Iphone 8 seems way better than the GoPro 6, I mean the GoPro 6 has a wider view, but the color on the Iphone is just superior to the GoPro6. The GoPro5 also seems to have better video quality in most of the shots she showed, except for the slo-motion.
in the gopro 6 its much darker..
Why aren't you dead
Did converting the Hero 6 codex make it come out darker then the Hero 5? Because the Hero 5 come out brighter then the Hero 6 but the I Phone seemed better then both Hero's. But is the Hero camera's more for action video?
i like iPhone 8 and the hero 5 better..
Hero 5 is better then hero 6 and iphone 8 better then hero 5. Hero 6 footage looks like dark
Not at the iPhone looking WORLDS better...
I think I like the hero 5 better
Is anyone watching this bitch anymore?
ecuador: empezar las eliminatorias con todo para valer verga las ultimas fechas.

Great videos Mikey!  I especially liked your visit to Shirokiya in the Ala Moana Shopping Center...my favorite stop.  Next time you're in town, you gotta try their Kulu Kulu custard filled pastry....onolicious!  Thanks for the tours!  Aloha!
The food looks so good that I actually got chills while watching it!😁😌
Those steamed noodles in the second place sound right up my alley.
Mark Wiens has a million subscribers; and the Food Ranger just reached one million subscribers.  Time to get this channel to one million subscribers as well.   It would be dope if you would do a collaboration with the Both of them.  I think it would definitely get you over that million mark.
You're in my area!
How sad, disepointed, destroyed, mad, upset, lifethretendly hart broken would he have been if there would have been western broccoli in the soup.
BUT WHEN IS MIKE ACTUALLY GONNA GO TO CHINA
That place is 28 miles from my house. Guess where I'm going Saturday. Thanks
My hometown.
The meat juice!!
Go to ISIS base
I just moved from LA to Little Fort, Canada and I'm already missing the food
try the kitchen sink at fair oaks pharmacy in south pasadena east of los angeles!
@13:35 No stuffed sneezes so your not full!
The noodles are my favorite
No buddy cares if you go round  their restaurant
You would like more pork on the back of your bun???  9:00
Making this video available in Colorado where nothing close to Xian food is available, is a crime
Get out of LA wtf!!!    Find something with ambience and class.    You are losing it bub!!!!
I'm hungry, i want to eat
Those gooey noodles look amazing....wish I knew how to cook something like that
Spicy means burning butt when on the toilet 🚽
I do the same thing whenever I eat food from my country, especially specialized regional and provincial cuisine..
U should go New Orleans and go to try the special number 2 which is from Orchards Ramen restaurant.
That is not soup, its jello.
please try Filipino foods...  :)   love your videos...  the secret taste of every food I eat!!!!  stay cool!!!
Mike, make a Live Stream 🤤
Oh my god, I miss the food
this channel always makes me hungry
Definitely one thing I miss about LA is the MASSIVE variety of foods you can get.
Can you try Japanese food in LA? Cindy’s kitchen was 2 minutes away. Can you do a meetup at Westfield Santa Anita?
Hi Mike, when you order several dishes, do you eat all of them at one sitting or do you taste each and take the rest home...smile
Mike, I am so happy you got a taste of home! That is an important thing for people who have moved far from the the place they grew up. And thank you for the education! Watching your videos has taught me a great deal about places and cultures that I am not familiar with.
Would love to see you go to Xian
Mike omg I'm so happy I did not know you had this channel, I love Beyond Science. You are the man!
I can give you a few places to eat at since your in my home town
Did he say my wife's friends recommended it
It's a motel for Chinese food
The consistency of the soup looks like snot. 😶
You should  try the hat in la  san Gabriel yum good  eatting

You know what's funny. You are the girl version of Chucky. And Kristi is of course tiffany. So it's like a girl girl couple. I don't want to give any spoilers for the new chucky movie so just watch and when it's the end you will see why I think this is a funny coincidence.\nYou both did a great job!!
I love you with red hair! I know it's wig but if you ever decide to dye it red, it would look amazing on you! Such an amazing tutorial
Always liking even before I watch! I love both your channels and videos 😭😍
here from rawbeautykristi's channel. subscribed! your channel is amazing! love this collab. can't wait to see more.
Your lips 👄👍 need to do mine !
Thank you for this!  I plan on doing some sort of creepy doll look this month.  This really really helps me out!  I love that you involved your bestie in this video!  Im heading to her page to check out her stuff now.  <3  loving all of your halloween looks!  Keep kicking ass girl!
You guys are just THE BEST! you're both fire.
Some advice for the freckles: dont mix eyeshadow with water ! The water will evaporate and leave powder which will move around and be dirty looking. (Trust me, i learned the hard way). Use a mixing liquid or setting spray instead.
voted xo I hope you win girl, you are the most creative person on the toob! lmao!
horror move i am affected
Can I just say how absolutely excited I was to see this in person collaboration with my 2 favorite youtubers! This is amazing and hilarious!!!! Yay!!!
I was planning on being Tiffany for halloween for months now everyone’s doing it

I didn't know Chucky was a lip-pouter.
You earned my VOTES! I didn't know we could vote multiple times! And ticket prices are amazing it quoted me $44.75 that was on the site.
You already KNOW I love this shit. Buttttttt, as a girl new to SFX AND WHAT NOT I would love to know which editing software you use for your intro and videos!!! \n\nXoxo Love ya betch
Hey Mama Hanz!🤗 This is my 3rd Hanzoween and I LOVE your work! Its so detailed and you always learn something by the end! I think your looks using sfx like your Jigsaw and mummy are sooo amazing but can you also do lots of looks that use just body paint? I absolutely love watching you create such deatailed and dimmentional looks with just different paints! Its truly a joy to watch and to learn from you! I soooo look forward to the rest of Hanzoween! Its my favorite time of year on YouTube!!! XOXO💜😘
This is such a great partner look I love it omg

Ur intros always scare me so I jus skip that part.. Yea I'm a sap..lol.. Love ur work!!!!
This is soooo fitting for you and Kristi! I love  this so much💘
Seriously, think you two could be sisters. I, at first, during the intro, was like, hmmm, which one is Jordan....then I'm like...duh, Chucky....Jordan is Chucky.
I don't know why, but black lipstick is sexy af
I'm so happy to have watched the two of you together :) The two of you are amazing to watch absolutely amazing artists and can't wait to see if you both collab agin through out the month of hanzoween..... :)
Literally thought Jordan was Jaclyn Hill in the thumb nail! 😬
The Lady who played Chucky looks more like Tiffany tho lol
There aren’t enough thumbs on YouTube for how much I like this video
Jordan looks like a scary but somehow still pretty Jennifer Lawrence 😂 and Kristi is a bad ass as always
I loved this video😍😍😍😍
how do you not have more subscribers?? i’ve honestly never seen a more talented artist 😍
How can I be you ??!!!¿¿
*takes out notebook* \n“raw beauty fuck face” \n*writes down*

Monopoly guy is great but what does that equifax CEO shine his head with?
Wonderful work.
This video missed the best part. When he wipes his brow with a stack of money.
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
I am so relieved he had a Monocle... I thought for a moment he would fail but HE DID NOT
quality troll
How did I do guys?
Oh this makes my day.
That monocle though!!!
This is amazing.  \nAnd this man is fucking HERO.
this dude is my spirit animal
When the monocle came out .......dead
That's a woman btw
The hero we need
hello there, fellow redditors
This dude's head is brighter than my future
Plot twist... that's actually a woman in that costume
Seem to be two kinds of people here, those remember him having a monocle and people tha think it is some sort of conspiracy! It is not an effect, you just never played the game!
And a new hero emerges.
The fact that the disguise didn't raise any alarms says it all. He fit right in. 😂😂
That person is a Female, get yo facts straight y’all
Thanks for the Free Parking. -_o
This is world class trolling
This is trending???
Is there a black man behind the monopoly guy?
Hahahahahah this should be #1 on trending that's epic
The monocle puts this over the top.
And another thing we will not honor the flag it was not for black people because it's the same as the Confederate flag. It's just a raggedy piece of material. White people tell us all the time we're not American. So don't expect us to honor the flag with the racist song that go with it
fun fact!!!!\n*the monopoly guy doesn't wear a monocle*\n👀
Get that woman a tv show!
now that's how you fucking protest,  take notes people
if this is considered trolling then the women's march was a successful protest
i didn't not know wade wilson was here.
This is the reason why I want to attend these meetings
Thumbnail looks like a bald Ryan Reynolds
Modern Breaches, a why to say we sold your information to the highest bidder.
And YOU must be the Monopoly guy...thanks for the free parking.
But what if they hired her to distract you from the real issue??
Jews control America's Federal Reserve and foreign policy.
Just because they wear a top hat and cardboard mustache and wipe their brow with fake money doesn't mean they are trolling... 😃\nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I wish for a interruption. But anyway nice job !
Hilarious and original!! Love it.
It’s funny that this will be trending and plenty of people will write comments here but how many of you will actually call or write your representatives to protect your life and livelihood?\n\nTake 30 seconds to contact them: \nCopy and paste:\nPlease federally limit personal and small business liability for fraudulently used identifying information and replace the social security number system.\n\nThen sign it and mail it your representatives.\n\nAlternatively google your state for your senator/house representative and call them at the number on their website to say the same as the above message.\n\nIf legislation is properly implemented this could literally save your life, your child’s college saving, your family’s lives or your local small business for an investment of 30 seconds today.\n\n(Flagrantviolations.com)
He's practicing for Halloween x)
I have never laughed so hard at something in my life before. Hahaha, well done good sir. Well done.
This is how Trump got elected people dont know how to do their jobs and screen and check peoples identity properly hes probably a russian spy
It’s not just the freeze part.
These guys sell all their shares prior to making their WE BEEN HACKED announcement and yet no charges for fraud? This infuriates me.
Apparently the Mandela Effect suggests the Monopoly guy NEVER wore a monocle? What do YOU remember?
Baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors application has the particular fun and nonmedical objective. \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
He had a monocle in a different reality I'm 100% sure its the Mandela effect in action.
I guess everyone's doing a side show now too
Now this... this is nice.
Crazy part is thats no troll. Thats actually Sam Walton founder of Walmart reinvigorated and given a new body to live out immortality.
Best laughs I have in weeks :'D
This is why I joined the internet.
Wait the monopoly guy never had a monocle though
This is the best thing ever
so funny I forgot to laugh
After many days I found a quality video
Thats really funny
Oh and by the way black people. Notice how for 50 years they've been telling us where 13% of the population think about it they've been telling us that for 50-60 years don't you think we have grown by now
Mr pennybags doesn't wear a monocle
lmao
at least it was a humorous protest 👏
Lmao
lmfao
damn that, Pennybags! lol
you're doing great sweetie
wilford brimley's office please

That guy’s head is brighter than my future...
I looooove him. Thank you dude!
Hey YouTube black people will not be silent. You will not shut us up. We are God's chosen people from negroland no such thing as a white Jesus. Black people don't support banana Republic they want to try to tell people black people what to do with their hair

Fake. Cute edit though.
ah yes very real
dina is the best mum
Sid is so funny especially when he pops in at the end of your videos also great video thanks for sharing peace
You made some great decisions. You do you boo!
Your teeth does age u a bit but still beautiful
Do what you want, simple :)
Good Dina, always put your family first, you won't get that time again with your daughter when she's already a grown up. Btw love the lashes, what mascara dear, looks good like wearing the one with fake lashes. OMG... That what every girl wishes for a good mascara !!!
Hey Dina, I was wondering could you please do a video about your gay friends? A lot of bad people say Muslims hate gays and don't want them to be gay, and definitely not marry, and it would be so great if a Muslim could just explain that it doesn't have to be like that. It would also be good if (without it being weird) we could meet some of your gay Muslim friends. I know gay Muslims! But only two. But I though of course you must have gay friends, and of course you wouldn't mind them getting married. I really enjoy your videos and I know you wouldn't hate gay people so it would be so great if you could just tell us how it's ok to be gay and especially gay and Muslim. Anyway thank you x
Dina your lashes look bomb💣 what did you do to them and what mascara did you use????????? x
Dina whats lipstick you use? i like it
Can you pleaase give a house tour to see details and  interior etc. Beee so much inspooz❤️
What foundation are you wearing dina👌🏽😍
I totally understand & relate to this so much Dina! thanks for sharing <3
We love you Dina! Totally understandable having anxiety.. same here as a musician. Xx
It's ok to reprioritize!  It's great that you can honor family time and when you are tired and over extended.  No apologies or excuses needed!
Dina!!! you dont have to attend events as a blogger to get attention from us your followers. Honestly you being yourself showing us the real you is the reason you are loved so much do what makes you happy spend time with your family and vlog when you can cos gurllll your vids are absolutely hilarious and tbh im always looking forward to watching your videos and particularly the ones you film while your at home it makes it seem like your one of us. You are amazing at what you do!!!! xx
okay but gurllll what mascara have you got on
Salam go check out my YouTube channel and enter my giveaway!!
Dina swore! 😶😂 then later in sha Allah. loooool
Hats off to you Dina... .love you sis !!!
Mom instinct you’re doing amazing sweetie 📷
Follow @noor_aj giveaway at 10k followers!
Love you dina! Xx
Good for you gal!! Do you!! If I could stay at home and spend more time with my little one, I sooo would. Maybe one day Insha'Allah...anyway stay happy and sane! 😊
Hi Dina it's very understandable. The opportunities are good but just do you. Hannah will grow up and you won't get the time back so it is ok for you to find a balance that works for you. Please do what you feel good doing and don't stress too much. Also so happy that you will be doing stuff with your sister so you won't be too lonely. ☺️
properly because this is not the right way maybe you don't know so I am just saying and any non muslims who don't know anything about Muslim I don't want any of your reply thanks 🙏🏼
R E A L T A L K ❤️
I think you're just an introvert and get naturally tired after extending yourself too much, there is nothing wrong with that
Absolutely love how brutally honest you are.
Where's the makeup tutorials
The fact that you feel guilty shows how much you care. Hana has such an amazing mother who thrives to make a better change in society. Well done and you deserve a break! We are all human 🌹
You see so many hijabi you tubers begging it to become famous now days so they jump to the opportunity for abit of lime light for this dunya. Dina on the other hand has always remained grounded and raw when it comes to YouTube that’s why no one will ever top her in this game. My fave Muslim YouTuber you are amazing at what you do & a great mom. 💕
I never really comment, but I really felt for you when I watched your video. I've got 4kiddies my eldest is 13 and youngest is 3, and mummguilt is something we all struggle with. At No matter what stage of life we are at. Just wanted to say Your doing an amazing job. Your great at what you do and it's a blessing to have a supportive husband and family around you. Whatever your doing is for your family as well. So take solace in that. Your videos are so genuine, nothing fake about what you do, which is why I love watching your Vlogs. You show the true side to you nothing made up with fairy dust over everything. Where everything is hunky dory in Lala land. Your show the good and bad (nothing too bad) and that's what life is. Do what your happy with. Regardless of what other people are doing. It doesn't matter. Good will come it's self. But it's only worth it as long as your happy xx sending love
I get it. I don't have a child so I don't have the mom guilt but I get the anxiety. It prevents me from doing so many of the things I really want to do. About the mom guilt I think it's really important to remember to sometimes put yourself first. I don't care what people say, you CAN have a career AND a loving family - especially when you have a husband that supports you. So good luck :) and hopefully one day our anxiety wont stop us from doing what we love.
Plz remove ur vineers they dont look good on u, u have good teeth and r pretty the way u r
Can you tell us more about your anxiety & how you cope with it? A lot of Muslim people don’t know how to deal with it. :/
why are you and Sid in back hoodie alot my sweet? new looks?? I love it! ill call it the bank robber look!
Thumbs up to you. Time with your daughter and family is more important than money. You can always make money but can never get time back.
Love the fact that Dina is one of the most normal people ever!!  Love it!!!
Alsalamu Alakuim Allah bless you and protect you.  Love your makeup and turban and black sweater. I want to meet and be your friend so much and love you sister. Your soo cute 💎💎💎💎😘😘😘😘
dina, do you feel part of your anxiety comes from being a Muslim woman? I remember your bafta vlog where you talked about how you had been treated at the afterparty and another event which was supposed to honor ALL women but you and your mother were the only ones having issues getting into the event, tho you had the invite and your ID....I’m sorry if that’s part of the reason and people make you feel that way cause of your religion. I’m not Muslim but I am black, I get the being the only one in the room mentality.
nawww your a great mom tbh, and yes I feel like this when I dont spent time with my siblings/parents forget even the guilt of having a child. Dina your awesome, and hana is super lucky to have such a humble and warm mom like you. Love watching you
Everyday and family-related content is much more interesting than any fashion week :)
Anxiety is a bitch isn’t it. Fair play though if you don’t enjoy them as much for whatever reason. Define your own success you’re doing amazing <3
Your makeup looks awesome, do you mind sharing what you're wearing (specifically foundation and lip stick)? Thanks :)
Your make up is stunning today
Dina your makeup looks flawless! Also, I'm gonna copy that outfit, one day, when i master the art of styling a turban.. one day..
Awe Dina,  I would go places with you if I didn't live all the way across the ocean! I too get mom guilt. We could sit around sulking and feeling guilty together!😁
Youre a good mum and wife, for now put your family first then you do your job, because you have flexible time to aranged, loved to see you doing that 😊😊😊
I know some people might say oh you don’t have to explain yourself, and you don’t, but I love how you keep it real. Even if it’s just these little tidbits of letting us in. You are someone I have looked up to and I also get bad anxiety. So I really appreciate when you put stuff like this out there. Makes me feel less alone, more normal. 💕
I love your videos! Thank you for sharing about mom guilt and anxiety. I feel the same way as a parent. I also felt this way when I was pregnant tge anxiety and more so exhaustion. Keep with awesome work!❤😊
Just follow your intuition and everything will always be ok 💜 I feel like you are more awake than many people. What you feel is real.
I always feel this way when I'm going somewhere new or meeting a huge group. My anxiety plus the guilt of leaving a child at home combine to stop me from going.
You keep it so real! I love that about you :) Don't feel bad for it, I feel you should do what you feel comfortable doing and what makes you happier! ❤️❤️
Why don’t you and sid take turns or with tousey...love u doll
I hate going to academia related conferences where I don't know anyone, my anxiety ramps up to the max, so I totally get it.
Ok firstly.. your makeup and whole look here is beautiful mashallah.. secondly.. you really don't need brands or events to add value to your channels. You have integrity, creativity and control of your content. Quite honestly that is rather refreshing!! \nUltimately though you are a mother and a human being first and foremost. Do what fulfills you and gives your heart joy and contentment sister.  \nLife's short.. live it with no regrets! May Allah bless your home and family always inshallah xx
I get mom guilt all the time. I don't like going to events at all, I avoid them like the plague.
I prefer someone with me most of the time too if it involves social settings, especially if I don't know anyone! Like what am I supposed to do? Stand around awkward, eat by myself? Like dude, I ain't equipped for dis haha
Dina. You are amazing. You need time for yourself and this is your time. You are young too. To be a good mom you need a break. Have fun ❤️❤️
You are a pretty cool human ☺️! Keep your head up 💜.
OMG I'm the same. I don't like to go to events. And I'm a fashion designer and need to. I love to be on the stage, showing off my designs, but being behind the scenes and on red carpet with all these ppl who show off so much, gives me anxiety. And those who go a lot are like highschool cliques.
You don't know me I don't know me. \nI don't live in London I live in spain an most of the time I'm solo, in my case sola. \nI deal with anxiety for everything I do.\nI totally understand you Dina. I hope we could go together to have that cup of tea or to talk about plans and stuff. \nWho knows.\nAll the best.\n\nW salam.
It's like you're speaking my mind. I bet a LOAD of people know exactly where you're coming from x
Omg why couldn’t you and 2c start a podcast together??😍
Dina in you’re heart you basically missed Hanna which is good and sweet family always comes first becz in you’re heart god has put love there for you family then any other things before being out and socialising like other women’s do and I hate that they put everything else first before families there own child’s Dina I actually love you xxxxxxxx
@DinaTokio  I understand how you feel Dina,  your resins are valid being a mum pulls at your heart strings, anxiety is like a brick wall that’s hard to climb at times I live it 24/7 so I pray you over come it insha'Allah. Your content is more then we can ask for from a mother of a young child, stay true to yourself only do what you can manage and never do anything that likes you sick be it work or otherwise manage. I respect the loving caring mum that you are. Take care hugs Margaret 😘
You don't need to do it so slow down do part time work????
Can I just say, your skin is glowing masha'Allah! And those lashes as well as the minimal makeup look are on point!!!!! \nTotally relate to ur anxiety and stress of meeting new people btw.. ugh
That's just normal. I know it's annoying to miss opportunities but in the end we are not robots. Hope you're just happy for yourself and your loved ones, that's all that counts
Well I think you’re making good decisions.
I know how that feels Dina, I'm like that as well ... I just chicken out .. or more like feel why do that too tiring xD\nI GET IT, I think WE ALL GET IT ... so relax ! :) \nWe love you as you are .. as we try to love ourselves as well xD
Love how brutally honest you are. No woman you are my favourite out there. You are so normal 💖
I saw you and Hassan on the train at Ealing Common...but I was to scared to say Hi.
Mommy to mommy, Mom guilt...it's a real ting 👊 Family always comes first 😊
more God related words in this video...I like it
Hana is so lucky to have a mum like you ❤️🙌🏻
I totally get you Deena
Dina. ☺

To all those people out there who live in Bradford hit the like button\n#hometown

Don’t yell at me, but your teeth look way better now! I hated it at first but they’ve settled..... or is it better lippy? You look GORGEOUS ❤️,
Could you make tutorial of your last Instagram busy mom look HIJAB style?
Dina, Don’t mistake what uv been made to believe is ‘anxiety’ or ‘Mum guilt’ with what is in-fact u fighting against ur natural fitrah as a woman.\n The things u mentioned that u feel are because of the way Allah designed women to be. U will always revert back to ur natural fitrah no matter how much u try to fight it. Society has made a name for  these feelings and called them ‘anxiety’ so that u stop there and don’t look into deeper meanings as to why u feel the way u do. So u don’t look to religion and Allah for guidance. U just say I suffer with anxiety. In fact u don’t. It’s just an internal battle with ur innate feelings as woman to want to be at home with her family where Allah prescribed for is the best place. And to be modest and conservative in every way which is why u find these events so uncomfortable sometimes. \nUr not meant to find it comfortable to be around inappropriately dressed people, alcohol, music. So in fact what ur feeling is complete NORMAL and what isn’t normal is what ur doing and trying to convince urself is a problem with urself called anxiety. Don’t fight ur fitrah. What Allah designed u as. U will never find true happiness that way. Go with what Allah has prescribed for u and only then will u  taste the true sweetness of happiness. \n\nI’m not one to leave comments ever, but I saw this short clip and felt compelled to say something. I get how u feel coz I was in the same position few years ago. Feelings I couldn’t quite explain. An uncomfortable feeling being in certain places. It’s because it’s not what Allah has prescribed for us as women. \nAnd By the Way men face the same battles with ‘anxiety’ as they go against their natural fitrah too. By becoming less protective towards their women. Society has completely changed the roles to make it that men who accept their wives free mixing and dressing inappropriately are viewed as confident in themselves and those who find it uncomfortable for their women to be speaking to non mahrams as insecure men. But no. Men should feel a natural jealousy and protectiveness over their women. Be it their mother wife sister or daughter. When they fight that, they also have these ‘feelings’ that  they can’t explain and name them anxiety. They feel frustrated and can’t explain it. \n\nI hope this didn’t read too bluntly but that’s how text can be sometimes. Compared to actually speaking about stuff. \n\nAnyway I just wanted to help u with the way ur feeling. I know exactly what it feels like and I am now free of that. Alhumdulilah. TabarakAllah. Happiest Iv ever been. \n\nAs Muslims we’ve been given the gift of knowing what’s to come and if we truly claim this to be certainty then how can we justify the actions we knw r wrong to be ok.. what will u say to Allah when ur standing infront of him.. that’s the question that changed my life. What will I say to my creator..? What will be a good enough reason..? I wasn’t ready? I tried my best? Not good enough. \n\nHope U read this and it helps in some way  inshallah. At the moment Allah has kept some form of guilt in ur heart when u do something u knw isn’t right, don’t let that small portion be taken away from u. Act upon it before it’s taken away. It’s not too late. U have a daughter who will lead by ur example. True love means wanting jannah for those we love x

I had those headphones and they were my absolute favorite. Apparently they were my dog's favorite, too. he chowed down on them in no time.
I got that shit right
10 hour loop of Roomie saying Cello with a confused face please.
I got all of them. Perks of being in high school pep band. There are very few.
I got them all right but I don't feel confident that I would have guessed cello without hearing cello guessed. certainly I would have failed if I didn't know what the instrument choices were ahead of time, wow
Great idea just no time for audience participation\nYour so clever Andrew\n🤔
100%! I'm so proud of myself! Where's my A+, Andrew?
I got 100%
6/6 boys
*whispers* cello...
Got all 6 right, yay
I have people texting me rn but it's really confusing because the text tone is the same note as the samples!!!
only one person got them all right... it was me xD
I got like 3/6 right
I don't get the challenge, I named them all correctly without much trouble.
I got them right, except for switching round the cello and the trumpet - and I'm not musically trained at all!
If they weren't talking for it, I probably would've got some more of them, they kept making me doubt myself
I got all of them right, and my hearing is bad, so I'm just smugly satisfied right now
It's cello, not jello
So I got these all right, but first I had to look up what a nylon guitar was. I figured out it was just a string type of acoustic guitar, other than that the test was fairly easy. \nI don't mean to brag or anything, I am actually confused myself, maybe its because I like to do this sort of thing a lot. A lot of the time its to find the original sounds that were modified to fit an EDM type track, or what a sound from an NES/SNES/N64 is supposed to be mimicking. I mean this is the only logical reason why someone who doesn't know a lot about music would be good at recognising an instrument. (I mean if you asked me to recognise a pitch or note just by hearing it I wouldn't be able to do that.)
It could be an electric guitar if you took a new born yak and threw it into a vat of nylon
it was clear, that rob win this
I wasn't really expecting this but I got them all right. I had thought that the piano sample was the nylon guitar until I heard the nylon guitar at the end then switched my answer.
Woohooo I got them all right! 😁 I paused the video before hearing any other guess so I didn't cheat. 😊
I actually went through this test, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I got all of them correct. The one I had trouble with was the cello because, out of all these instruments, it's the least of heard. I'm proud that I know my tones as well as I do. c:
Well....that test was weird-ly easy.
This video could be a nylon string guitar for all I know
I gotta thank my sponsor from the inside of this Unicorn head.\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!\nI haven't laughed like that at a dumb sight gag in a long time! Thank you Andrew! :)
Actually got them all correct
I got 5 out of 6
Would have been good if you could have played the entire note at the end to really hear the difference.
It could be an electric guitar if... Rob Scallon 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's make this a meme, People!!
Well, I failed miserably. And I play the clarinet. At least the piano is unmistakable.\n1: It's an electric guitar.\n2: Wait, that's an electric guitar. The first was a clarinet.\n3: No, that's an electric guitar. The second was a nylon guitar.\n4: That's a piano. Definitely a piano.\n5: I have nothing...\n6: Wait, that's a nylon guitar. Wait, then what was the second one?
Guessed all of them right!
I want a test WITHOUT an answer sheet.
I play trumpet and literally that blew my mind. 😳
Nailed it. 6 out of 6.
I got them all right. I wouldn't of guessed cello but because all the rest I was confident on the one I didn't know was cello.
I don't get it, this test doesn't seem that hard to me
I got them all right but I work with the middle of sampled instruments all the time.
I got em!! But only because the choices were so limited.
Got them all right but definitely wouldn't have if I didn't know what instruments there were...

There midi samples but I love this challenge I would like to try it with the natural instruments. it was like two challenges in one for me .thanks  I enjoyed it
got them all right! but I reckon that’s luck rather than skill
I have not went to any musical school and I still got everything right
I’m so surprised that I got all of these.
I got them all right! :3 it's easy if you use midi samples often
I thought that was actually quite easy, to be honest.
I get ir all
They could all be electric guitars if...
The chemistry between these three is amazing.
Wow, I got all 6 correct and I'm not even a musician however I listen to music 18 hours a day.
That was really, really bloody difficult. It would've been even more difficult had I not googled what a clarinet sounds like before.\n\nIf they weren't samples, I might've actually had more of a difficult time than had they been real instruments.
So youve done it before and you did it again and got them all, weird.
I really surprised myself and got all them correct haha crazy
we had to pass a similar test in 6th grade to join band the following year.
who else doesn't know shit about music but still finds andrews videos interesting?
got them all except the trumpet that i had to re-evaluate after i heard the cello :D
Wow I actually got all of them right
yuh i got all this right on the first time
I got them all correct after I switched which ones I thought were piano/nylon guitar. After I heard the last one I relaized it was the nylon guitar. but 4/6 isn't too bad for the first try...
6/6 and I still can’t write a good song 😐
UGH why do you have boyintheband. Hes so emo he should be in the back of a school room hiding his ugly face. But yourblucky you have the impressionist and you, i liked.
I got all of them right! I thought the piano was nylon guitar at first, but when I heard the last one I figured since you let Roomie change his answer, I could too. So I guess I got 5/6 right if I weren't allowed to switch, but I'm still proud :D
I got them all right
It would be an electric guitar if... that'd be a funny meme. Get on it people who are more talented than I.
i had this idea a few weeks ago lol
Not that anyone cares, but I got 100%
I got it all right! (Id hope so since I’m doing music at uni)
I got the cello one wrong
I got them all right!
I got them all right!
I got them all right!
The only ones I could make out perfectly were the cello and piano because I play the two.
It could be an electric guitar.... If it was tuned to drop C
Cello 5 \nPiano 4\nTrumpet 6\nClarinet       1\nElectric guitar 3 \nNylon guitar 2
Hey 100 percent
Clarinet✔\nTrumpet❌\nElectric guitar❌\nCello ❌\nNylon Guitar❌\nPiano✔
4/6
i got 5
4 out of 6, missed 2+5
they made this awesome vid together --------------> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQe9w6awkU8&t=0s
please start vlogging
Got all right
ez
Use a speech jammer app!
100%!
I got 6/6 😎
I got all right thankfully
Got em all right
Clarinet, Electric Guitar, Trumpet, Piano, Cello, Nylon Guitar\nRight, Right, Right,  Right, Right, Right.
Pleaseeeee do the instrumennnntttttt!!!!!
All right. ;)

Didn't really like the song much until 3:38, would've liked a whole song based on that idea.
I hope this album is front loaded with all this dank hype shit and then back loaded with chill shit like Czech One
I need this king Krule album to drop soon, so I can accommodate my depression properly...

The Aquarium looked like a date 😉😆. Poppy is hot! Best wishes gabs x (im probs misreading shit but ah well)
Omg one time I literally pushed my laptop off the table because there was a spider on the screen
I really hope this doesn't come across as patronising because I really don't mean it to but can I just say how fucking amazing it is to see you out the flat so much recently and especially getting out to see friends. As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression I know how hard it is to even leave the house, I struggle to even take my daughter to nursery most days without feeling sick at the thought. I'm proud of you for even your little trips to the beach to read or sit and think. Hope your doing well babes, you really seem to be getting there with things and I know it doesn't mean you are but I hope you are. Love you loads xxxx
I feel like there is sexual tension between poppy and gabbs ahaha

Go watch what channels Boogie has subscribet there is Vanosgaming
Damn that scene really made it tie together
When I first heard this song I loved it
Damn a boogie heading to the top
kodak aint wanna get his nappy head ass in the water so they had to switch the video up during his verse lol
The fact he did all this underwater in a 15 ft pool💯
Check out the hottest song of the year, 💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🎧🙌🙏💪🙌🙏🤘🔥🔥🔥💯👌💪👀😎💖💖🤘🙏🔥🔥💯💯👌💪💯🙏🙌🎧🎧🎧🎧🙏🤘🤘🤘🤘🔥💯👌💪😋\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OftnNjRzX9c
This could've been better man, your editor went to crazy with the stupid money graphics b, and the overall artistic quality was pretty shit man. The song is good but the video was somehow super dry for being completely underwater. Try being more metaphorical in your next one man, add some type of meaning or story, hope this turns into an oppurtunity to learn what works and what doesn't.
How is he not drowning
Kodak wasn’t in this shit so I left
I don’t think people actually realize how amazing his flow is. I haven’t heard anybody doing it like this in years
I'm so fn pissed Kodak isn't in it
old song new video
This aint as good without kodak
He’s singing pretty good for someone who’s underwater drowning
Don't worry y'all Kodak just got lost on his way to the filming
This music video was recorded underwater in a pool 8 feet down
Wtf  happen to kodak u trash as bitch
Who else is salty Kodak not in the video?? Smh
Kodak sunk right before his verse came in
Wow y you do my ni**a Kodak like that
Every where I go its a light show I'm surrounded
This is my favorite song is so lit everything  about the song and e videos is awesome
This song is for me when I’m old and rich and I’m dying 😵
Who's here before this song becomes Famous?
Dam he can hold his breath
He shouldn't even made a video bruh. \n😡👎
He’s brave for doing this shit cuz my ass would of died 5 seconds into the video 😂
Could he actually play the piano though? Because he always on the damn piano 😂😂😂, but I love it
I love this video
No Kodak ??! Fuck this song
Where’s the book Kodak lol
Fake asf for not waiting on kodak
I really just came to see Kodak but this cool 2
Why did he delete the audio version that was on a 100 million
That's one ugly ass nigga

Remember Steam users, please!
I love how this is trending with only 80k views.
I hear Spielberg is in talks to direct the 3rd season opener. Really hope he does it. Would be a [literal] return to his 80s roots.
Is this an actual game or just a fun little animation?
*I have to play this, thank you for the video because this is the first time I have heard of it*
See the gameplay of this in\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z4sjJJnFjy4
This is an app for android and iOS.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bonusxp.legend
I need this to happen
To everyone asking, the game is an app, available on iOS and Android.
Is this gonna be a real game?
I need this in my life.
Its hard to search for it in the play store. I downloaded it after clicking links that directed me to it in the store. Uninstalled it because im werry of its access.
LOL this trailer just spoiled me a lot, I just started watching
If they make a stranger things game, I don’t want it to follow the shows plot. I’d want it to be a completely original story.\n\nedit:unless this already is an original story
Lol wat I have more subs than this company:0
this looks just like Zelda!
I almost blew up my hand playing with dry ice.
Here before this blows up, it's only a matter of time. This looks awesome, but please, please, PLEASE don't make a bad game adaptation! We all want to see a good quality game and not something rushed and thrown together just to earn some quick money.
Omg want.\nDoesn't it come out Halloween?
I wish they'd do a Stranger Things TellTale game instead
I want a stranger things game similar to Friday the 13
where can I find it and bring it to the Nintendo switch
Less than 300 likes and 27 comments but it’s on trending?!?!??! \nOk YouTube
Looks great! But please...pretty please. Bring it to the Nintendo Switch?
Please be real.
Hi
Who else hit start.😁?

wow cool
this video was not good
From which countries does he have fans from? Comment. I'm from Finland.
I have $800 burning a hole in my pocket for a new device and they had to drop the headphone jack. Fucking dumbasses.
I wish Google would keep its hands off hardware so the devices could be diversified. That was supposed to be the point of Android-that Google would be hands off. Betraying that stance might have a very large cost. If Samsung and Google go at it, Google may be forced to get out of hardware forever. Which maybe is okay anyway.
Speak corridor oral award basis doubt possible architect career.
Wireless headphones?????? Samsung don't do it.
Google is now Apple but worse.
Oh... Does it have a head phone jack? Or if Google now giving head to Apple
what does it have to do with league of legends ?
01:03 - A pair of 4-1/2 subwoofers? Really? I'll bet those'll rattle the neighbors' china!
Check Out this MIND BLOWING Inspirational Speech by Carl Sagan -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hopg6027Ac
The future is wireless  pixel phones don't have wireless charging 
Apple fucked up for real now.....
The real question though is can I make the Google Assistant voice in the Google Home sound like HAL 9000?
Snooze fest. Only thing to impress me was the always on song detection
US is in chaos under Trump, Europe is falling apart and turning into an Islamic Union(Terrorist attack everywhere, Brexit, Independence of Catalonia, Massive muslim immigration), China's economy will collapse soon, India will be the only superpower in the next decade.
The Google Home Mini is going to be by far the most successful product there. Pixel 2 is cool but not that special, and the lack of headphone jack - no matter where you say the future is going - is a bummer for a lot of people right now.
i dont want to have to charge fucking headphones. I wont ever buy a phone without headphone jacks and when they stop putting them on all phones i will just stick to out dated phones that have them. Samsung s8 plus will be my last new phone i think.
time to invest in alphabet stock
They needed to add wireless charging before removing the headphone jack. Car doesn't have bluetooth? You can't charge your phone and use an aux cord at the same time.
02:51 That's why they don't have wireless charging.
160 bucks for earbuds made by google? For Senheiser or AKG maybe, not Google though. The prices are apple-level ridiculous.
No headphone jack? Screw you Google. I'll keep my Pixel XL 1
I love google but that Pixel 2 design is.... Arrgghh
and now compare the recent iphone presentation with this one. wtf has apple been doing in the last year???
If only the companies would look at how many people hate getting rid of the headphone jack. It's not as good quality, drains battery life faster, more expensive headphones, oh and you'll have to charge the headphones too, which will probly only last a day of listening for good in ear ones
A device to capture photos for you. Damn, future is not for the paranoid.
You're a year late google. \n- Apple
The present is not ready for a wireless future. #ifyouregonnamakeitwirelessmakeitpractical #bringbackthejack
By wireless you mean wireless until you have to plug them in
Whats everyones deal with a headphone jack ????
Future is wireless!!!!!! Or all wired up. A headphone charger for that head phone an conventional headphone a dongle for conventional headphone. First they standardize all the headphone jack to 3.5mm now they are removing it.
The NSA loves wireless devises , in the not so distant future people are going to get arrested after some jokes about killing the president in there homes because of devises like this, keep giving away your privacy...1984 is not that far away!
Any one, who can test, how the game Ouchy Bird works on new Pixel?
I don't care for wired headphones, ever gotten them caught on a door handle?
Lol, people say that apple products are over price, this shit is over priced too.
I was really hoping the next Gen Google home would have aux out looks like only the $400 version will have it, going all in with Alexa then, anybody want to buy a used GHome lol
In the future everyone's phone will have a little tail sticking out of it because no one's phones actually have headphone Jacks so they're going to look like my friend with his iPhone audio jack adapter.
is it only me or sounds like Google try to become like Apple? Selling overpriced stuff and collect your private information too. Who pays 100$ for a pen.
pixel 2 doesn't come with headphone jack because they are now selling pixel buds, which are wireless devices.
Sweden translation and designing team!
I hardly ever use my headphones. So when I do, they'll be discharged and there's nothing I can do except wait for them to char- [tosses them in the garbage]
Ready or not the the future is coming and it is dongles
Takes the piss when apple removes headphone jack, Google does it all of a sudden the future is wireless hypocrisy!
People complain about simple shit..where moving towards the future..get a pair of wireless headphones and stop bitching
Instead of making Good quality cheap wireless accessories, these companies get rid of the headphone jacks and name it as future is coming. They're just in it to make money. Make cheap, good quality accessories and research and develop such tech and the future will be here in no time.
Google...Like Apple, but a lot more dull and boring
Maybe beverages I have an IPhone 7 plus lol I don't see the issue without the headphone jack 😂 this may be my second phone
Overall disappointing presentation... Just a bunch of overpriced gadgets that most people would never even think of forking over money for... Clips camera at 250 bucks? Ya ok Google lol... I would have been interested in a decent pair of wireless  buds that worked well with the pixel 2 if they weren't so fucking ugly! Those things look atrocious, and at 150 dollars, no thanks! The difference in this year's phones to last is barely even enough to upgrade, idk, pretty disappointed.
159$ FOR WIRELESS EARBUDS???? JUST GET 2 DOLLAR ONES. i was a apple sheep. Then a google sheep. Now im a samsung sheep.
Pre ordered the 2 XL in black... says it should arrive by October 25th. The removal of the headphone jack is a complete non issue. Everything I own is wireless, headphones, speakers, Bluetooth in the cars.
No headphone jacks... No sale. I'm Poor, my car does not have bluetooth.
Holy fuck googles goes full nsa. They listen to you they film you and now read the messages from your mom. I'm willingly to pay with my data (It's not a free service) for the nice cloud service, google docs and e-mail service they offer me, but i kinda don't want them to take the perfect picture when i stand under the shower.\nBut productwise they didn't show any inovation at all. even the earbuds use their all ready in use tech. Goolge is today known for buying inovations than develop some.
Eventually everyone will follow apple but apple gets most number of haters as they are the best. Look at price fucking hell. 399$ for a fucked up home device. 999$ for a less powerful tab than iPad pro. AirPods are way better than that piece of shit
Why did you call it a Chromebook when Google is clear that its a Pixelbook?
Is it an Apple event or Google's?
No headphone jack???? Who is making these decisions????
So the only thing they changed about the pixel is removing the headphone jack? Steve Jobs ghost haunts us still
So be prepared as jacks off
The Google Pixel Buds translate a lot of languages, but not Spanish, Really?
Hey! Does the Google Pen work with the Google Pixel too?
I really dont see why people are complaining about the Pixel 2's headphone jack. It looks like a VERY promising phone, like more than 3/4 of flagship phones the past year or so have been without a headphone jack and the phone as a included USB-C to Headphone dongle. In my opinion, google really nailed this phone
Look at all these technologies I can't afford.
what did the translator say at 3:46 in reply to the question ?
The only good thing coming out of this (in my opinion) is the earbuds
$400 dollars for a speaker? Dang, I put together a legit home stereo for less than half of that :/\n\nAlso...seriously, no headphone jack? Sigh.
Some great tech but why do I not like style and design?
Is that the girl from nigahiga videos??
1000 dollars for a chrome book?
Expensive bus still cheaper than apple \n\n\n\n\nAnd better
The xl isn't shipping in mid November, it goes on sale at the same time as the regular pixel 2
am i the only one that clicked because of rebecca in the thumbnail??
Seriously if you are plugging headphones directly into your phone Without a real DAC, you're not an audiophile, so stop crying, and pretending. If you can afford a $900 phone you can afford a good pair of $100 wireless headphones.\nAs a side note, if you don't like wireless stuff you are not Google and apples demographic.
Wow..  So you're telling me that for a mere $450 I  could DOWNGRADE from the Pixel XL, which lets me use SQUARE and any headphones I choose?\n\nRemoving vital features and then charging more to get them back is Apple's game plan, and it's already put them on thin ice with their faithful. Google (guess what) you HAVE no 'faithful'. At least not anymore. See ya!
The future is wireless... yeah, and the future is ALSO bringing even better corded headphones.
They were literally just making fun of Apple for no headphone jack last year wtf
google buds look cheap and crap

Nothing new, Augmented Reality, Smart speaker etc..
Screw wireless. I prefer sound quality.
Wireless can suck my 3.5mm jack
And as a last note... *fuck Bing*
Buy bluetooth headphones you cheap fucks
Now this is how you fucking make a trailer
This could be a good show. But where's OA Season 2????????????
The first german series on netflix. Lets see ....
This looks epic; is it in English tho?
An article called it 'noir', i'm in!
Now this is interesting! I love mystery kind of movies/show so yeah
Ok 1953, 1986 and 2019 - there's a pattern here, a 33 year gap between these dates. This definitely means something, maybe these timelines are running parallel to each other?
I'VE BEEN WAITING A YEAR SINCE THE FIRST TRSILER I'M SO EXICTED
Like it If you are also watching this video in 2036.
As a person who loves shows like Stranger Things, I still don't see the resemblance and it feels more like IT (and just a tiny bit of Riverdale) to me to be honest...
So kids go missing\nWith Netflix that means only one thing,\nThey're trapped in the Upside Down!
This reminds me of a book I've read Black River by T.J. MacGregor which the antagonist kidnaps children from different timelines.
Kids are looking forward to this Christmas flick... oh wait..
That looks like some good shit right there. Good shit. Right there right there If I do say so myself and I say so
OK, guys, before the movie is released on Dec. 1, guess the answer to the question: When?
When has kidnapped the children?
I'm pretty sure the question of who kidnapped the kids is gonna come up a few times, and be important to the plot.
Love the use of typography!
This is what tpicals film
FNGHD DGTD BD
I wish this was just a trailer for an episode of new season of black mirror
damn son. please find some nasty asian movie, those are hardcore too.
Really? First, a move called Bright. Now, we have Dark. Can they film Dim?
Yo. Netflix gets a standing O from me. They are killing the movie market.
Nope, too late at night for this, Netflix. I'll come back in 10 hours.
I pressed like before I even watched the video
fun for all the family.
So, is this produced in English or will this be subtitled?
Its giving me black mirror and the returned kind of vibes don’t know why though
Can't wait to watch both Dark and Bright on Netflix!
Okay you have my attention.
It looks like Saw 😱
Yeah my birth day........... does that say something
sold. I'll have to read this with subtitles
Anything with time travel, I'm in.
Netflix has a lot of horror films coming out this month and I'm excited for all of them
Okay, you have my attention.
What If Doc Brown was a Weeping Angel?\nSOLD!
Now this looks interesting.
Could be the next stranger things or it could be shit I'm gonna give it a chance
I've been waiting for this for quite sometime now
The question is is math related to science
something that stephen king would write
I will give chance,looks good
This looks interesting
interestinggggggg
Jigsaw reborn...😁😁😁
Oeh Nice
Es geschah am hellichten Tag, ich bin mal gespannt. (I'm curious.)
twin peaks vibes
Uumm, yea...
Fucking Pennywise.
Dammit! Another Adam Sandler movie...🤔
Netflix is straight ass
This is fucking good damnnn
You got my attention!
Um, what?
This looks sick!
Stranger Things + time travel

Can't wait !!!!

Gosh darnit Netflix I can't take your awesomeness any more!
FUCK YES
Wunderbar!
JOLLY TIMES

ZZZZZZZZ
German Broadchurch? Yes please.
Looks promising
I'm in.
Mixture of The OA and Stranger Things
Are they implying a ginger gone missing is a bad thing?? 🤔😬🤐
Getting Twin Peaks vibes from this.
This looks happy and delightful
seems good
Woah this looks visually stunning!
I am ready!!!
طريلر
Netflix is now basically 100% series about homosexuality and homosexuals. And in EVERY Netflix series there are scenes which can be enjoyed only by gays, and are extremely disgusting for everybody else! I cancelled my subscription long time ago.
Stranger things + It
Netflix movies usually look the same for me. I hope they stop making such movies or use a different editor at least.
Looks Finchery im game!
Can people not compare every supernatural show to Stranger Things. It was alright but definitely overrated
When you really want to empathize that you're show is DARK
Netflix I have an idea for a great show it could bring you more subscribers but nothing is free so wassup
Is this going to be in English?
Movie or series?
So... Stranger Things with time travel stuff?
The question is not donde esta la biblioteca...
Song??
Stranger Things 1.1
stränger zings or ït
is this a german production?
I don't get it..
anyone knows the German song ?? the one at the end
Anybody know the song at 0:34?
congratulations Netflix on another piece of shit
Netflix, why you're doing this to me? Too many great shows, i can't keep up , my older cousins can't stop talking how their 90's childhood were better compare to mine , Niggas please,  you didn't have netflix back then

This actually looks like something I could do 😂🙌🏻
No matter how many videos i watch I never get tired of Her accent. And she's just awesome and so talented
Your face lost 10 pounds with that contour
Not the type of drugstore I meant
You make it look so easy 😍
Love it!  Love everything about it!! 💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️
Love this ur such a talented makeup artist I just love ur videos Jamie n ur such a beautifull person inside n out ;) xxx
Rimmel London has SO many cool products out, just not available to us in the US. I wanna try so many things, the main one being the Contour Stick! I seriously have been thinking about saying fuck it & ordering it from Amazon bc I honestly don't think it will EVER be available in the US!
I can still remember finding your skull tutorial on halloween and discovering your channel! Love you x
‘ just because we’re dead doesn’t mean we can’t highlight ‘ 😂😭💅
Just cause we dead doesn't mean we can't highlight 😂☠
seriously you make black shadow contour look good. \nalso. i live for the weeeeeeeeee when you zoom in. \nperf.
Such a good make up artist love all your looks!
Hey Jamie!! Just bought some Zoeva brushes and I would love for you to make a video of how you clean your brushes. I don't want to ruin mine so it would be great if you show us how you do it!! :*
You are just the cutest!!! loved the looks
Loved his video! Defo scary but glam at the same time
You're accent is fucking E V E R Y T H I N G. UGGGH MAWMA 😍😍
honestly when i die the highlighting trend is going to be something that people look back and cringe at (lookin at you overplucked brows) but im gonna demand in my will that they highlight me to the gods bc just because we dead doesnt mean we cant highlight
Celebrate death. Dumb people buy products to help the zionists
Thank you so much for simplifying this and making it actually seem doable! 😊
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT EVEN I CAN PULL OFF THE 'MAKEUP SKILL-ADVANCED' SKULL????? Why in the hell does every other tutorial make it look like it requires 33 full hours and half a dozen hands to accomplish exactly what you just did? Thank you for the simpler tutorial!!!!!! \nP.s. I don't plan on letting death stop me from highlighting either.😂😂😂😂💥💥💥
Such a cool look
Simple but absolutely incredible!! I'm doing this for Halloween!! loooooove!!!
This was amazing!!!! So good! You should do an actual day to night makeup look. Like how you'd fix up your foundation/concealer and everything too! That would be great to see!
You're gorgeous and have stunning eyes! Quite frankly, you make me sick! Lol! Kidding. You really are very beautiful, though. :)
I want to know how you did the makeup you started this look with!!! It’s gorgeous!!
Keep doing what you are doing!  Love it! Mmm....

French all the wayyy❤
Arabic vs American makeup please!!!!
like makeup up.. 👍👍👍💄💄💄❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Less is more!❤️
😍😍😍😍
The French one ❤
French side
Yasss
Hello from\nFrance !!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ #naturel#simple#belle#jadore
French
Do American v/s Brasil
#Quadfamily
Both sides are gorgeous 😍😍
❤️❤️
OOOO I LOVE THIS!
What was ironic about this is that for the “light” or French side she used an American brand foundation, and for the “extra” or American side she used a French brand for the full coverage 😂 \nI like both sides, and usually just depends on the type of mood I’m in 🤷‍♀️
That's my everyday make up like French
American girls look all the same because of layers of makeup. French ladies keep it feminine and classy not trashy
Love the french side omg
We are just so extra hahah\nFrench side is very very beautiful and simple💫\nLove you darling and am so excited to see your palette😁😁❣
Good lord, that eyeliner is so perfect!
This is so true ... I am french and this is so truuuuue haha both of those looks are amazing
Please do a asian/middle eastern bridal VS american bridal makeup!
Does anyone know what brand of contact lens she's wearing?
What shade are you in the ysl foundation
Wow, I’ve been doing French makeup my whole life because I don’t like a lot of makeup unless it’s Halloween.
More and more, I’ve become obsessed with the French side of makeup. Fresh skin and just enhancing my natural beauty ❤️
Who thinks she looks like Veronica from riverdale
i think she looks ABSOLUTELY gorgeous in that French side, and it just goes really well with her new hair, this video just made me see the beauty in natural looks.
i love the french one it so simple yet so elegant 😍
Thank you for doing these. I love seeing how people do makeup around the world. I love the French look on you so much. You are gorgeous! I usually do my makeup very minimally but I love the way people cake it up. 😍😍
I prefer a Fresh look, because it looks nature.
French side is so fresh and healthy looking!
Does anyone know any French Makeup artist youtube channels?
It's weird because I am American BUT I do my skin (in reference to the video) like the French wide but with American eyes and brows 😂😂 I'm a lost soul
Love both sides!!! Love you gurl!!! Your gorgeous! And I think for work I’m going to do a look like the French side 😁
You're so beautiful. l've loved the way you look in the French style side.
I really do love french make up ... So natural ...
Wow this is amazing! I think I would be more likely to wear the French makeup but it would be fun to go full glam every once in a while! Subscribed!
After Seeing This Video I Realized That I Do My Makeup Like The French 🤔❤️
I'm watching this with my boyfriend and all of the sudden he said 'woah she's good at that' when you were doing your eyeshadow 😂❤️
Wow your so incredibly amazing,thx you for always being so positive!!!love you!!!😭💗😭
I just found her and she seems so sweet and real. WAYYY different than other makeup youtubers I have watched. SUBSCRIBED!
The French side is so pretty
Love the french look 😍😍😍
I love american makeup than french and korean
I really like the French makeup even tho Ima cake face 😂😂💕
I love the French side. Looks so natural and beautiful.
I really like the French side, I'm not a bold makeup type of girl 🤷🏽‍♀️
Does anyone else think American makeup is way over the top and the French makeup shows off her face not the product?
i dont get, what does the quad family mean? or what is it suppose to symbolize? i dont understand and ive always wondered in every single video.
That is so not true, I'm French and I do my makeup just like Americans. If I want something natural, I'm gonna do the right side. It's just a feeling, whether you want something extreme or natural.
We are just so extra 😂😂
French makeup suits you well 💗
Hope you had a great time in our country !
What contacts are you wearing? So pretty!
American vs. German make up
You look amazing with both but I really like the way your eyes look with the French side ☺️
Ahh I just love the French side 😍🌹
Wow love, love, love the French side!! Will definitely be trying this asap! Thank u for always spreading positivity.❤️😘
Definitely love both but the french side just looks so much more mature and sexy. In my opinion. Love this!
Im French and let me tell you this is SPOT ON !! Congrats 🎉
I like more the French makeup
Her eye color is the exakt same as the background
Can u do an American vs British tutorial?
I love the french makeup side❤️❤️❤️❤️
lmfao NO!!! french people do like american people that's NOT true AT ALL (im french)
French all the way.
I'm going to start wearing French style! So simple and natural look. I love it. So elegant!
I'm french and it's crasy that you know everything about the french makeup.\nI love brushes but I use my finger for the concelar. Red lips is my go to! Love it so much and really funny to see an american explain this
You look good on both sides though!
The French makeup really brings out Christen's eye color. She has such a nice eye color 💞
what is your contact's name? Please answer I've been searching for a contact like this for a long time! 😢
Can you please Made an Video German vs American (I'm from Germany)Love youuuuu❤️
looovvvvvveeeee the french side. love, love, love it! the american side is very pretty but the french side is beautiful !! oh my god!!
Please do American vs Nigerian makeup
You remind me of this one spanish actress haha
The French side I think appeals generally to most western Europe. I'm Italian and literally wear my make up like that (just like the people around me as well)
I definitely love french side because I don't like a ton of makeup on the face. Then faces look like coloring books with a lot if shimmer 😁 Your french eyebrow looks like mine 😊
I'm French I love your makeup! Both sides are beautiful even though I prefer the French side haha it's pretty accurate we like our makeup natural even tough we are more and more influenced by American youtubers
OMG can you do an American vs Arabic makeup???
What brand and color are your contact lenses? So pretty!!
French 😍👍🏼
I love the French side!!
The french side is more classy but the Amercian side has more coverage.
i love that you actually have acne and skin scars because it shows youre human and you are beautiful in that naturaul way where a lot of beauty gurus want to alter themselves to be 'perfect'. i just appreciate your genuines and down to earth approach to beauty
Can you pleaseeeeeeeeeee do a video on your fitness routine and what you eat in a day/week? Your body on Instagram is wow!
French side is so sexy!!!!!
the amount of times i rolled my eyes at this video is unreal. i usually LOVE Christen but i notice how you're trying to speak for America as a whole, but i never see anyone with makeup so overdone. yeah maybe for instagram people do that, but it's definitely anyone's 'everyday' look. it just doesnt make sense how you do an everyday French makeup look but a very extra and extreme look for American everyday. hmm. not trying to hate because i do really love your videos, it just doesnt make sense
The French side looks the best! American makeup is very vulgar and cheap looking.
it'll be amazing to see the frensh side with the korean side !!!!
You are naturally beautiful! 💕 I absolutely love both sides but the French side is gorgeous even though we know you love your cake side 😍😂😘
you have the most beautiful eyes
I love to French side omg so elegant
When you realize you love both styles of makeup and can’t decide 😩😂
so pretty!!! i really love the french side especially!!!!
imagine breaking into this guys house and seeing all this...
Someone do me a favor and beat the fuck out of this guy
This could be a porno tbh
One word: what the fuckkkk ( -,-)
This guy and the car fucking lunatic along with the enabling mother figure needs too take a long walk off a short bridge.I don't care if it's their personal life or they aren't hurting anyone etc..they are a fucking disgusting part of the human race.
he looks like he hasn't slept in 31 years
this is disgusting and fuck this girl for doing this with this retard guys fucking disgusting and should be killed
I wonder when the crib is gonna break
Imaging if a kidnapper thinks he's a baby and then look at him...
This is fine. He's minding his business.
I don't judge
Cant help but think Stanley just wants to be loved
That's a big ass baby lol
BruH I'm so high rn and this is not ok
i’m too high rn how’d i get here
I would like to see him and pinkie princess play together
At least it makes you happy
this is why you don't abuse children. they grow up into people like this
Diapers are like pads. Random, I know.
I ate baby snacks like puffs and yogurt melts when I had my wisdom teeth taken out
He likely a adult with Autism
This bitch need to get his ass up and get a jod😂
Why Is This In My Recommendations
Tbh Being in that pajama suit and sleep in that crib looks comfy af
This is one of the weirdest videos I've ever seen.
Go to www.areyoumymommy.com to find your mama today.
I feel like when I wear the diaper it's like a constant hug from mommy I NEVER CRINGED SO MUCH IN MY LIFE 😷😷😷
He isn't hurting anyone, I don't see any problem with this. But, he clearly has some sort of underlying issue.
I can kinda tell he had a bad child hood so ya but the diaper is to far for me and the baby food just no i Dont really agree with some of this
If that guy lost like 300 pounds and got a haircut/makeover he could probably clean up really well. He has a decent face other than the eye bags and chins
Its not called baby role play, its called little space! \nI am an adult baby, but no way would i show the entire world my room.
I still don't get it why psychology and counselling degrees are considered the most useless college degrees in 2017. Hmm!
He seems like he isint sleeping well in his crib😂😂😂😂 the dark circles are very visible
I need to do this.
It might be weird but he wants to be young again. I don’t blame him
This man obviously had some undealt with trauma in his childhood. Stop being a baby and get therapy for your own good :(
He seems smart if he can build a chair and crib
Remember about that girl who lives like a baby
He looks like a big baby cuz he's....chubby I'm sorry but it's true
The girl that acts like a baby and him should hook up lol
People, let's be understanding. No matter what age you are, you have the right to want the proper nurturing of a mother and to feel secure. There's nothing wrong about wanting to confide in the strange obsession to make himself feel safe , he's grown up without a mother.
It’s not hurting anyone, everyone has their comforts and if that’s his then let him be, he seems very sweet
Guys, I doubt he goes out like this. We all have something we like to do, I think this guy is pretty sweet.
Is that normal at all
What the hell i with the U.K.?!?! God they fuckin messed up
Bruh the girl wants it sexual. She wants to fuck a toddler.
Well it's called ABDL
Sad knowing he'll never have a gf
WELCOME TO MY CRIB\n\nA whole new series on MTV xD
There's no way that guy only eats baby food.
How am I on this side of YouTube  gaming to this
Crack a cold one with the boys
Holy fuck that's his mom.........not lucky.ok I know u thought I was gonna say hot.dont judge a comment by your reading
I like to pretend to be a rabid hamster, so I run in a giant wheel, poop in my cage, and randomly escape my cage to run all over the house. Then I slobber all over the floor and attack any people that walk by. Then I am a dog and stand at the window, and bark. I then rent cat costumes, dress my dogs in them, and chase them around the house barking. I find great pleasure in hiring dog walkers, and then biting them on their shin if they make me sit at the street corner. For some reason I get strange looks while doing these things. I think I can be whatever I want. -the perfect example of a liberal.
When you were once a baby and you loved it...you wanna be one again lol
This is how a weird porno starts
The comments are not ok. He probably had trauma like me and age regresses. His care giver seem very sweet. It’s weird yeah, but I mean it sounds like a coping mechanism.
He should date the riley girl
Where does he work? Just curious.
I have had my Passafire since I was 5
Surprised that pack and play hasn't broken yet.
if someone ropped his house they would be like (what the......)
WHY DOES THIS WOMAN REMIND ME OF A PORN STAR WITH THE SLUTTY OUTFIT AND BLONDE HAIR AND THE GLASSES AND THE WAY SHE SAYS STANLEY. OML FUCK.
I think this is a way to avoid thinking about getting older and trying to avoid the thought of mortality. Just an idea but I've read through some of the comments and some make sense but this is just my opinion.
Am I too deep in the weird part of youtube?
I honestly would like to be like him reliving my childhood days but we all have are strange addictions mine is pickes
Honestly I don't really have a problem with this. The dude says he had an unsafe childhood and that this lifestyle makes him comfortable and happy. Leave him alone
Him and the woman that acts like a baby should get married
I would never look at him the same when he came back to work
Plot twist: there's alcohol in the baby bottle
I bet you he would piss his pants and act like an actual baby when he is alone and there are no cameras 🎥
What the fuck is this child doing???
I bet he is still a virgin
see this what we not gon do.
💕'When you hear Melanie Martinez once'💕
You could see he's a \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIG BABY
I'm sad for him
I have a friend and he is 14 years old and has a bedwetting problem but it's genetics because some teens have a parent who has a small bladder and during the day they can go to the bathroom with no problem but when you go to bed and fall a sleep they can't control it and that's when you start bed wetting again. Most people with this problem can control it when they are adults but when they are teenagers they can't because they don't know how yet. This problem starts for many teens when they hit puberty but it's a genetic thing so most teens won't have this bed wetting problem but kids really don't resort going to diapers or pull ups there parents will most likely try to help them control it like my friends parents do.
if someone were to break in, *time to steal some money* —*WHO’S MANS IS THIS*
This girl must be rich, feeding reading books, playing with cars and singing to him, this girl must be making bank
Definitely turned on now.
Who changes your nappy
Breastfeeding time?
Disgusting
This. Is. So. Uncomfortably creepy.
Is this transage?
Annnnnd this is why everyone hates tumblr
Same man 😅
He need PUSSY
I kinda wanna bully him...but he's not harming anyone.... FUCKING-- *breathes* Idk
Why is this adorable?
wtf did I just watch
... Whomest mans ?
I’m speechless
Old idiot
What a fucking weirdo def a virgin
I CANT BREATHE, IM SCREAMING
Bro grow up
Yeah fat ass baby!
who pays the bills
Oh wow burning sun done over. Good song. This album has a nice rhythmic sound.
Much, much better than the previous 3 singles. Still scared for this album.
This is a great Weez tune. Has a White vibe and Green vibe. Ranking high on my Weezer overplay list. The previous 3 were flimsy. This one's strong. 
Wonderful verse, weak chorus and OK bridge.  6/10   I'd rather listen to the Green demo than this unfortunately.
This has a modern yet classic 60s pop sound. Between this and Weezer's recent use of the 50s chord progression in Go Away and Endless Bummer, they are bringing back great things. This really reminds me of Weezer combined with The Monkees new song She Makes Me Laugh (written by Rivers, of course.) Buying the new album at release.
Weezer is probably my favorite active band. I've really liked the past 2 albums and the first 2 releases from the new album are good just not as good as most of their past work. This song however sucks.
Best single they've released for the new album by far
this is actually good
Really good. I'm enjoying the change, especially from the White album.
Must be a big album
This song is more Beach Boys than Beach Boys
Not 1 single mention of Mary Tyler Moore. Disappointed
sorry, but in my opinion this is not good...
Not a bad track... the more I think about one of my top 10 Weezer tracks, “Eulogy for a Rock Band,” the more I think it’s about them and leaving rock music behind 😢
Melody sounds like it was lifted from an earlier B-side called Burning Sun.
I'm a Weezer fan..went on first Weezer cruise..this song is pretty lame..most of the recent releases have been lyrically pretty crappy..almost like Rivers lost his edge for writing good pop singles. The alliteration is great.
what a good song
he sounds like the dude that sang rude
still stucky in my head
I swear, when I first saw the title, I thought it was showing Wonder Woman, anyways, great song!
This is a really good song!
This video made me fart.
This is the only song I like off Pacific Daydream but still lower the Pop taste just a but please.
thought I was looking at the ocean man album cover from a distance
Best single so far.
is weezer going to hit the trifecta of 3 good albums in a row...\nman i dunno if i'm ready for this
The melody/harmonies and the arrangements are just beautiful <3
These new songs aren't bad. Not my jam though. This one is actually really good compared to the others though.
Use more vocal melodies and songs Rivers wrote from the 90s and we'll talk.
Best single from this album so far imo
For me this makes 4 great summer jams on this album so far. Very happy with how this is turning out.
Nice one!  \nSpecialy when this began: I still believe your beautiful lies
Amazing to think that Rivers has been holding onto a melody this good for so long, unable to finish it until now. And now we've ended up with one of the absolute best modern Weezer tracks, with new lyrics and an incredible arrangement. I'm glad it's finally finished and out there, because this song is excellent.
Finally we got a good one
I miss Weezer so much. Will they ever come back, or is fluffy beach stuff all they're going to churn out now?
*My personal rankings so far*\n1. Feels Like Summer\n2. Mexican Fender\n3. Weekend Woman\n4. Beach Boys
yes, if you're trying to figure out that youtube is an algorithm based on previous video views and snapshots of thumbnails, yes, it is true.
I feel like nobody brings up how creative these lyric videos are!
Much better than burning sun imo, this takes everything good from burning sun and enhances it, burning sun has the same problem that all Green songs have (i critique green for being solid but extremely safe and the songs follow a generic and identical formula)
Best song you guys have released so far! Love it!
dig the song! here's a brief write-up I did about it https://zumic.com/weekend-woman-weezer-youtube-audio-single
Finally, a good song. This is what I was hoping the whole album will be like. Here's hoping that everything we haven't heard so far is like this too.
2 3 la rola
My new second favorite song first is only in dreams
This might be the second album I have ever gotten
los amo, hijosdeputa!
Best one yet, loved the burning sun rework
This is so sugary its great
Good to see that the fans seem to be receiving this song well, because it's great.
Not bad definitely an improvement from the other singles but it's so just ehh compared to ewabiete
stop
O c t o b e r 2 7 t h
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD
New Weezer, Liam and Noel Gallagher album! What a time to be aline 💕
Sounds very 80s prom to me lol
Oh yes this is amazing
This is burning sun
Thanks for being a consistently incredible band. So far this album has a very different vibe but it's amazing. Looking forward to the concert tonight!
FINALLY not a beach single!
4.07 minutes of happiness
meh
Always late
weezer manda mtoooo!!!!
Is gud
Thats a tune!
The Shins sound great!
Burning sun anyone?? B sides little bitches.
love weezer always
Booo make weezer suck again!
no
Damn.
Burning Sun from Green Era almost exaclty.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Good job, Weezer!
Good
Reminds me of Hot Dad
me gusto esta cancion
<3
This is Burning Sun remade, cool
Burning SUN!!!!!
Awesome.
YEESSS weezer DOING IT AGAIN
Wow!  Crisp, tad different, love this song!
Argentina is still waiting for Weezer!! =w=
When did Weezer become another lifeless pop act?
Even the B sides off the white album are better than this. Missing the rock sound.
At least he doesn't do that awful rap-singing thing in this song
1 for 4 is acceptable enough in baseball I guess
Why do I keep checking if weezer has found that good sound again from the 90s/first two albums? I need to let go.
Even beach boys was more interesting than this, this is just boring
Sigh. More overproduced pop rock from a beloved band with which I grew up. What happened? No band will always remain the same, but WHAT IS THIS?!? Where is the authenticity of Pinkerton? Where are the harder riffs?
Weezer is one of the best bands ever, with some of the worst fans ever.  So negative, always picking apart every note of every song, forever comparing everything they do to Blue or Pinkerton.  Where's the loyalty?  Where's the love?  Honestly, the worst Weezer song is better than nearly every song that gets played on the radio.  Stop complaining and give Weezer the credit they deserve.
Wish there was just more fuzzy guitars and less church bells and reverb. 🙄
Huge Weezer fan, definitely not a fan of this one though. Beat and melodies are okay, but the lyrics make me wanna gag.
More and more bullshit. Just retired already Weezer, you haven't had a decent album in 11 years!
Meh
*Snore*
is the Black Album, Pacific Daydream? Or is this just a separate Album?
Rivers, just stop. Weezer it's over!
Sorry its not in spanish for you spanish speaking people.
Estoy 100% seguro  q el comentarista es chileno
I think Chile can make it to at least the semi finals in the world cup.
Me da gracia, hay mas perucas que propios Chilenos, como siempre pendiente de su padre.
Me pareció bueno que Chile gane. Pero ni Ecuador  ni Chile recuperan su nivel.\nMe pareció un poco pobre el partido.
Que buen relator este chileno jaja broma, saludos de Paraguay, muy buen partido.
ya llegaron los chilependientes, perucas de mierda
jejejjeje ese es mi chile el bicampeon del mundo
Las clasificatorias sudamericanas sin duda las mejores del planeta.
Chile great team... we wanna see it in Rusia!
Jajaja Brasil los va hacer mierda!!!
Chile gano sufriendo , gracias a ese defensa bruto de Ecuador q se resbalo😡😡, y colombia estaba celebrando y burlándose de otros y ahora esta en riesgo lol, estas eliminatorias sudamericanas ya nadie es local , cualquier cosa puede pasar en cualquier minuto , solo se respira cuando el arbitro diga Fin
soy peruano y trabajo en Chile hace cuatro años ...quiero a mi pais y quiero ver a la roja en el mundial ...viva chile carajo !
Bien Chile, se que va al mundial.  Lo que me da mucha rabia que siempre veo comentarios de personas incultas, que se dejan llevar por los medios de comunicación y se tiran mierda con comentarios, yo soy Chileno y amo mi patria,tengo familia en Argentina y amigos en Perú y Colombia , pero si mi selección no va al mundial, sin lugar a dudas apostaría por mis vecinos Sudamericanos :)
que me hacen reir los chilependientes
espero que chile no juegue sucio  porque ya lo hicieron antes en BRASIL https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maracanazo_de_la_selecci%C3%B3n_chilena\n\nЯ надеюсь, что чили не играют грязной, потому что они уже делали это раньше в БРАЗИЛИИ
Siepre q gana chile saltan los monos peruchos diciendo q compraron el partido preocupence de su seleccion mejor q colombia los clava de visita y uds se cagan una vez mas
SI NO QUIEREN QUE TANTO NOS OCUPEMOS DE USTEDES, PORQUERÍAS, SIMPLEMENTE NO TROLEEN NI COMENTEN HUEVADAS EN VIDEOS PERUANOS, NO PIDAN DEMASIADO, PORQUE IGUAL VAMOS A SEGUIR JODIENDOLES MIENTRAS NOS SIGA DANDO LA PUTA GANA, VAMOS PERÚ CARAJO, EL CAMINO A RUSIA TOTALMENTE DESPEJADO, CARAJO!!!!

Chilenos el martes lleven su bacelina q brasil se las va a meter doblada rotos hijos de perras :) ! Peru y argentina en el mundial fuera chilenos indios :)
error del back ecuatoriano
Esperaba mas de esa seleccion pero la victoria que han tenido contra ecuador,no fue tan merecido,ya que sus dos goles fueeron regaladas por los defensas ecuatorianas .....veremos con brazil ahora!!!
Pobre Chile, Brasil lo va a violar en casa
tanta gente insultando a los países vecinos y creyéndose el cuento de que pueden “predecir” de que uno le ganará al otro...en serio digo , no se pueden calentar por un juego...que inmadurez más impresionante , pero bueno , de mal en peor van todos . Que gane el equipo que mejor juegue , ya fue .
cholo, deja de estar pendiente de tu padre, entro a ver los goles de Chile y solo veo a cholos picotas comentando
Les regalaron el partido a los chilenos.
Argentina y Chile quedaran fuera. Firmalo.

uds creen que brasil les regalara algo o se dejara ganar o empatar , brasil se perfila como primera potencia futbolistica y quiere recuperar eso . mucho menos quiere cerrar con derrota en su propia casa que ingenuos. ya fueron chilenos.
Es increíble como los peruanos culiaos andan mas preocupados de Chile que de su mierda de selección jajajaj
TODO ESTAMIS IGUALADOS POR UN PUNTO CADA UNO EL MARTES SE JUEGA SU FINAL ASI DE SIMPLE. AQUI YA NO ESTAN LAS MATEMATIKAS ETC.. EL MARTES ES UN PARTIDO PARA CADA SELECCION SU PASE ALA FINAL..
Por la culpa de quinteros no pasamos al mundial:( pero ahora ay que pensar en catar
ROTOS Y LA REPUTA QUE LOS PARIO...
Dicen que Chile perdera ante Brasil, nunca hablen despues de tiempo. O quedaran como Argentina, decian que les iban a ganar a Chile 3, 4 a 0 a Chile en la Copa America 2015 y 2016 y que paso? Nunca subestimen a NADIE
SOLO EL CHILENO EN EL SEGUNDO GOL NO LO MARCÓ NADIE Y SEGUNDOS ANTES OTRO CHILENO HABÍA HECHO FALTA
Waa genial ver como muestran estos partidos en Europa y en Rusia en especial
se viene un partido difisil que es brasil
3:15 que emocionante el relato😭😭 claramente lo dise hdjndidjdjdbĢuiűű§😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hello Neymar tengo lubricante para el martes
4:05 \n*voz de Homero*\nEs que es mi primer dia!
Me gusta como otros paises le tienen miedo a chile y ven los videos y todo, siempre atentos a los superiores
estos peruanos que llegan solitos a humillarse, les gusta decir que Brazil nos va hacer mierda, les gusta escuchar eso por que su selección nunca lo hará xDd
NADA MAS CON ESTOS TRAIDORES DE ECUADOR!!
una cancha que parece un patatal pero no es culpa de la gran seleccion chilena, es el Estadio Nacional y sus putos conciertos de Guns n Roses y Def Leppard, una pesima pesima organizacion.  Coordinacion mediocre.
El arquero se entregó en el primer gol
chicos pasen por mi canal, tengo videos interesantes que les pueden servir como bajar sin límites por mega, hackear wifi , juegos y otros trucos y programas , saludos
increible como lo perdio ecuador,estamos meados por un dinosaurio
Jajaja lo bueno q Brasil de local no a perdido ni cagando perderá con los chiliindios.\nVa mejorando el idioma chiliindio entendi al comentarista cuando dijo ecuatoria jajaja
Buen partido, saludos de Perú
puta que son feo los chilenos weon, la cagó XD
Ecuador se puede ir con la frente muy en alto si elimina a Argentina del mundial.Sera recordado por los Argentinos eternamente.
Ahora con Brasil moriremos peleando hasta el final. Muy buena eliminatoria.
rotitos por los ingleses para
Puta madre! Renovaron Ecuador completamente y si mejoro el ataque pero la defensa de antes se tiene que quedar. Necesitamos Ayovi, Erazo, Mina, y Ramírez. A chillier también está bueno en Mexico
POR FAVOR UN EMPATE EN BRASIL Y DESPUÉS QUE SE VALLA pizzi Y LLEGUE PELLEGRINI
EL UNICO MILAGRO PARA CHILE SERIA PERDER UNO POR CERO EN BRASIL Y QUE EL RESTO DE EQUIPOS EMPATEN TOOODOS...
Brasil en tus manos encomendamos nuestros espíritus(Colombia,Peru,Argentina,Paraguay)
vidal hijo de puta sige diciendo que por culpa de los que juegan en mexico la seleccion esta mal por eso vargas t mando a callar!! pendejo
Super Duper Bonus TurnOver Bulanan hingga 60juta lebih  hanya di JPS POKER
Que asco con ecuador como regala ese segundo gol así , se nota que querían favorecer a los rotos por que Perú los dejó fuera del mundial
Mala suerte para los chilenos😡😡😡xd
grande chile ,,siempre la envidia de los hermanos del norte ,
victoria merecida...pero q mal viene jugando chile... y si no es por los puntos q le regalaron en los despachos no estarian ni en repechaje...es la verdad
si le hubiesemos ganado a paraguay de local o ha bolivia de visita estariamos clasificados.😑
Chile sufrirà la venganza brasileira de haber tenido la osadía de quererlos eliminar en su mundial. Si creen que Brasil por no tener nada que perder jugarà por compromiso, ni lo sueñen; seràn su saco de arena para desquitarse de todo lo que les sucedió en 2014… van a ver.
Difícil estas eliminatorias, esto se putio porq ganó Paraguay, chilenos diciendo q ya clasificaron. Acaso no ven que se van a enfrentar a Brasil, selección que jamás a perdido en eliminatorias  y que está hecho una máquina para jugar al fútbol? Argentinos, ir a ganar en la altura de Ecuador? Colombianos y peruanos que partido más duro, y paraguayos, acaso no han visto los últimos tres partidos de Venezuela? Esto está jodido
Que se siente que ningún país de tu continente te quiera ... Afuera chile
ECUADOR 1  - CHILINDIOS MARICAS LAMEHUEVOS  DE LOS INGLESES   2
Chilenos hijos de puta
235 COMEPERROS LES GUSTA ESTO :V
Que sospechoso ese segundo gol
Monos de mierda echándose a favor de los rotos
Like si crees que este partido estaba actuado como juegan los ecuaterianos....???? este partido está comprado por chile...observen a los de ecuador cuando chile tiene la pelota..
en el segundo gol de Chile fue falta, empujo al defensa.
ese ultimo gol de los culo rotos parece comprado..... Defensa ecuatoriana=cagada
SOY CHILENO ME ENCANTA EL PERRO AL HORNO Y LOS BRASILEÑOS NOS VAN A DAR UNA MANO POR QUE NO LES GUSTAN LOS ARGENTINOS  PERO NADIE  ME  QUIERE SOLO POR QUE ME ADUEÑO DE SUS COMIDAS Y SUS TRAGOS  OJO COMPRO ARBITROS Y DIGO QUE SOY EL CAMPEON DE AMERICA
Pinches chilenos roban siempre cabranes los partidos pero brasil los hara mierda
CHILENO MAL PARIDO HIJO DE PERRA FEOS HDP NO IRAN AO MUNDIAL BRASIL LES METERA PINGA CON SALIVA BRASIL 6 CHILE GAY 0
si a Perú también le regalaron tres puntos
su primer gol de chile acepto pero el segundo no no saben jugar pasaron no se lo llevaron mierda maricones asieron trampa con uruguayo
Juegan con el arbitro a su favor, así cualquiera gana :v
si ganamos en brasil   meo en todas la banderas de america puta , si perdemos cago en las misma puta
Espero que el pueblo chileno se haya dado cuenta que este partido fue comprado... basta con ver el error del defensor ecuatoriano seguido de la marca del resto de los defensores ecuatorianos que se quedaron mirando al linea pidiendo offside
Buena come perros.
incredible el error del defensa de Ecuador que se cae solo y le quitan el balon y de ahi cae el Segundo gol..
para todos los putos que dijieron que ya estabamos eliminados chupenla jajajajjja aparecio el campeon de america hijos de puta a tragarse sus palabras jajajajaja
Kevin looked st that scale like it was the electricity bill
kevin lost a extra half pound of water.. he will gas out now lol... lets go el cucuy snap down city round 4
Tony Gonna Crrruuuuush Kevin Lee's drained out ass
i think the scale was a lil bit off, think they just needa go straight digital rather than that oldschool hand shit cuz he went from 156 to 154.5 idk about that
Tony already won the fight, u can tell. Beating the scale was prob harder than it will be tomorrow.
Let's GO Ferguson ;).
Hey pussy are you still there? - Popeyes
El Cucuy going to whoop that ass. No homo
Why are these fuckers still using an old ass weight scale that was probably built by Adam and Eve.  It's 2017 people.....Geeeeeze!
Cover your ass bitch ! this is a conservative country
I'm a Kevin Lee fan but man he just doesn't look so good at the weigh in
(Eventually) you get a second chance i title fights. Come on stop making it a big deal
you guys hear the predator in the beginning
Tony probably had a tough cut too judging from his reaction to making the weight.
Are you sure he was 156..? It only took you a full minute to figure out the fucking weight...
The way the title is worded makes it seem as if Ferguson was the one with the issue.
EPIC TRILOGY IN THE MAKING \n\nMARK MY WORDS GUYS
Tony makes it look easy JS
For those who missed my predictions on the UFC channel, i recommend betting on Lee. I'm dropping a couple hundred on it. And DJ is the obvious choice in the other main event. Borg has too many wins by decision and he isn't winning that way against DJ. I could see Lewis potentially KOing Werdum in the first round but if it goes past the first, Werdum wins. I would bet on Werdum.
Gj Lee but man you looked drained.  Gonna be a tough one tomorrow
lets go tony fergusson kill this bitchh u are the man
Ha haa Kevin Lee showing his black ass walking back!!
Tony going to knock the got a.isu outta Kevin 😂😂
U don't play with the scale and double check triple check when somones on weight . It's quick , he missed weight both times
Why don't they use like electronic weighting scales?
TEAM LEE!!!
Awesome. Good job Kevin :D.
Kevin looks drained....
' fuck luck ' love that comment
Lol Kevin Lee ass exposed
Weight-Cuts are bullshit
Kevin bouta lose
He looks very drained
Look at his face he looks dead!!
Nice lol
Tiramisu outta Kevin lee
Kevin will win
Motherfucker you missed the deadline.  You lucky they gave you an hour.   Wont matter.   Tony is nice and hydrated.   Enjoy the ass whoopin
Kevin FTW all day sorry peoples =)
If he didn't make the weight you know ferguson would be fighting Connor for the real belt
Nice ass
I don't know what I would do . My sack itself is 10 lbs .. move up a weight class ???
Damn he is too skinny. Cutting weight sucks. Missed it by a pound. My guess he'll shave his head and sit in the sauna for 40 minutes
Lee cuts a lot of weight,he walks around at 190 lbs
Making weight is such a stupid useless and gross primitive practice. I hate watching these guys and girls look all sucked in just to make some fucking dumb arbitrary number that means fuck all
That weigh in guy must take some serious under the table money....
Untill when the the new weight classes????? UFC fucks fighters health with this brutal weight cuts.
Hahaha wtf?! GAY KEVIN LEE forgot to remove buttplug before weigh ins 😂 you can see it poking out when he was walks off after first attempt. That's a big buttplug 😳
Missed weight fix title
Fuck that old bald white guy controlling the scale
Pay Attention To The Little Bumps On Kevin’s Stomach You Also See Those On Canelos, Jon Jones and bodybuilders
Why dont they just use normal weighing scales that tell you the weight instantly, fucking idiots.
Kevin will embarrassed Connor if they fought
WTF is up with the guy doing the scale? It's 155 right?   Why would he even ask? That'\ns not his job and it doesn't affect anything. He's just supposed to read off what the scale says.
Tony is going to get stopped in his tracks and realize a couple of things
be basic finally some useful advice !
I love autumn and am (shamefully unashamedly) kind of enjoying how it’s becoming a brand or thing. It’s cosier, I want to be spooky but in a joyous way. Ha. I don’t buy any thing pumpkin spice but I do read gothicly and kick leaves.
Yes. I am pro joy.
This is interesting because I am someone who gets really heavily affected by SAD, and autumn has alwayyys been my least favourite season as my depression seems to hit me the worst during it. But in recent years it's started to grow on me, and I think a lot of that IS the grandeur that comes with the commercializations of autumn. Before when summer ended all I'd do is dread the lack of sunshine in the coming months, the rain and my seasonal affective disorder inevitably kicking in, and even though that's all still true, it's like my brain can be distracted like yeah it's going to get gloomy out, but pumpkin spice lattes are back!! Halloween decor! Cozy spooky evenings!! and even though it's all done with the intent to sell stuff, I can't say I mind it for what it's worth.
I love you Lex. Never change. (Unless you want to it's all cool man it's your life)
this is the only comment section which is fun to read and has no awful comments! Good children
They only meet our needs and what we demand. I dont hate commercialization. Seasons give people inspiration to switch things up to attract customers.\nThe only problem I have is that small business dont really benefit from it as  much as much as large corporations.\nI love small business. too bad nobody cares about it anymore & just runs to their local starbucks smh
I was so convinced there was a window to the left of the fireplace but now there's all this space there...and objects...I don't know who I am anymore
I dislike autumn but I respect people's rights to celebrate and enjoy it with items. :P and I agree, who am I to deny someone their right to make themselves feel better with socks and things? if those things worked on me to convince me that this is an enjoyable season, hell I'd be doing the same!
You look like that one girl from that black mirror episode
I just don't like the fact that people associate buying things with being happy... I love autumn but I hate consumerism
I have never heard a convincing argument for Autumn's commercialisation till now! .. \n\nJust one problem in my context. Stop trying to make Halloween a thing in Australia (at companies). There is no justification for it. You want to know why?....... Because it is freakin SPRING!
See in florida fall is the end of terrible weather and the beginning of pleasant weather
I love your hair!
Interestingly it's because of this commercialisation of Autumn that I feel most disconnected from the world just because I live in Australia. We don't really have any of the stuff going on now when it's Autumn for us, which I'm guessing is because it's not a big enough market. Or maybe it's because it would clash with the majority of what we consume, which is American and British trends and media. We already have all of the winter-geared Christmas stuff when we are melting in 40 degree Celcius weather.
I love autumn and glumglum sadness season! I'm born in autumn and have always associated it with happy times :)\n\n(Unfortunately there's no pret where I live and the seasonal starbucks drinks aren't vegan)
It's always odd for me because summer is always the absolute worst for me, I don't sleep, my depression is a lot worse and I have nightly panic attacks. Autumn is like a 'thank fuck that's over' for me.
Run my children! Be basic! I love it!!! Hahaha
I love autumn (or fall because America), but I live in Texas now... Fall only exists inside my apartment. :'(
The suggested video after this was Zoella's autumn homeware haul
I was just thinking the other day about how strange I find it when people aggressively autumn-decorate. I love cosiness but I'm also lazy...
I used to only enjoy spring, but since I found proper medication and don't get depressed anymore, I've started to warm up (get it) to autumn and winter. I still hate summer as I can't stand humidity and heat and am a very sweaty person, but without the prospect of crippling depression inching closer I'm just relieved I can finally cover up in big sweaters and ridiculously huge scarfs and not sweat the whole time again. And the (admittedly scarce) sun this time of year is actually enjoyable and nice and warm instead of something to avoid at all costs.
I definitely agree that celebrating every season including the miserable ones is a good thing. Part of living in the now and enjoying the present instead of always hanging out for summer. However being in the southern hemisphere it is very confusing when everyone starts getting autumnal while here we are getting 25+ degree days again!
Somehow a three minute video from you leaves one with the impression of having absorbed at least 20 mins of emotionally charged, informed, and relevant content. More so than most actually 20 min long videos. How'd you do that, Lex?
Be basic, be merry in the leaves is going to be my motto for the season.
A bit off-topic: it’s SO nice to see that your home is not all blogger-y, with fairy lights and matching decor. It’s cozy! And lived in! And just a normal home. ❤️
Unrelated but I do appreciate your eye-makeup and thats saying something because I usually dont notice makeup or care for it much... Anyway its lovely.
And like where is all the fall themed music? Everyone sings about summer and winter and spring but why doesn’t anyone sing about the best goddamn season we get?!
I'm from central California and it is ALWAYS AND FOREVER hot except for the bless-ed few cold weeks we get between early November and late January before it turns stuffy and hot again, so I've always loved autumn because it's the only time I'm not boiling hot or sweating slightly. The first excuse I get to wear a cardigan and not sweat to death I am THERE. also I was born in November so autumn time is in my nature.
Please don't say you're not young! I'm only a year or two younger than you and you feeling old makes me feel old!\n(You thought this was going to be a kind uplifting comment but really I'm just selfish hurrhurrr)
i had just started thinking about this this autumn, thanks for putting it in words!
I love autumn and I love cozy socks and scented candles, and I love everything about it. Sorry. Take my money.
I don't get the big fuss about autumn. Like sure, the leaves turn orange and it gets a bit windy. No need to go conkers over it.
Autumn rules, I love cracking out my coats and jumpers. And if people want to buy flavoured coffee and warm clothes, is that such a bad thing?
See, I'm not a fan of sunlight. So Autumn is a boon as far as I am concerned. Heck, I was married on Halloween.
I feel like you and Noel Fielding would be a dream team
this is slightly ironic, given the video but...where did you get your jumper??? I need it in my life
Thank you, I will ♡
Do you have a source for that spooky statistic claim? Fascinating.
Thank you for raising S.A.D. Lex, it's a pain in the arse to say the least
IT'S COLD SELL ME WARMTH AND COMFORT PLS THX
the commercialism of autumn doesn't really bother me that much. \n\nit's mainly cos I can't get behind the products/campaigns as a lot of them aren't of much interest to me like for example pumpkin spiced latte's (I absolutely hate coffee and milk)
One thing I'm not keen on about the commercialisation of Autumn is after one cooler day you're inundated with ads about cosy jumpers and instead of enjoying the last nice days of summer it imbues it with a sense of desperation?! Mind you I am one of the people for whom worse weather means bad times so I guess I'm not the target audience. Love your videos Lex!
I don’t think it’s deep, just how the world is, the market sees that people enjoy cosy socks and hot coco in the colder months, to pay the bills this month they sell cosy socks and hot coco
Did you dye your hair pink? x
Absolutely dislike autumn, strongly hate the cold. But nothing beats a dark autumn night, lots of rain and wind, when Im sitting inside my place with coco, next to a radiator, reading a book, wearing knitwear hugged by my teddy and a blanket. Still want summer back tbh.
This is a v interesting topic which I probably should comment on but also where is your jumper from?
Spring is the best season handsdown
I hate capitalism. :( I prefer being cosy with my wife than luxuries.
I'm thrilled to have less humidity and bugs and more autumnal colors in the trees even if it means my tomatoes are dying and I can't make fresh pesto anymore.
I love the shattered illusion tbh
(Also Over the Garden Wall has REALLY helped me romanticize autumn)
CAT
LOVE the description
KITTEH!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3fZU9awMFU
Toy Story 2 was alright.
Autumn's a filthy casual.
NO
You live in central London? I thought that was impossible....
Honestly I love commercialised autumn/christmas.
See this is why I love springtime. I know that it can get categorised as being 'Easter', but on the whole, aside from pastel colours, spring is left alone more so than summer (BIKINI BODIES SUMMER HOLIDAYS THERE ARE CHILDREN EVERYWHERE), winter (Christmas and New Years) and Autumn (Halloween and Bonfire night etc). I feel extremely rejuvenated during the transitional seasons of spring and autumn, and I find myself craving the change in my environment as I live in the countryside so I get the full scope of the season change in trees and such. I do love autumn, and will wear cosy jumpers and nestle up by the fire, but the commercialism of Autumn is getting a little wearing. If I have to see another Instagram post which is a list of things to do in autumn like go to a pumpkin patch and buy an autumn scented candle in a cute pair of boots, I will scream.
Either the compression in YouTube is off the charts or you appear to have aged more than 15 years in a short amount of time
I hate the cold. Summer is the only time I feel cute and able to look like my body is mine. I hate the cold and I hate having to wear layers that make me feel fat and frumpy and I hate chapped lips and raw noses and my eyes tearing from the cold and the wind and I hate the rain and the snow and the wet socks and frozen fingers. \nBUT!!! Commercialization of autumn and winter (which is just Halloween and Christmas, lets be honest) is actually getting me excited for the season! I am looking forward to autumn dresses and christmas sweaters and going to a Harry Potter themed halloween party, and getting and giving presents on christmas and pumpkin pie and cinnamon things. the whole shebang, I'm excited.
Up next: Autumn Homeware Haul. Loving Autumn: yay, pro-joy. I have noticed more Autumn (insert capitalism here) vids on Youtube. I kinda don't like the idea that we have to change our whole wardrobe and decor when the seasons change. Surely most people just get out their jumpers/jackets/scarves, put away their summer dresses and leave their interiors pretty much the same. I love decorating my house for xmas as much as the next person but I don't change the cushions or the bedding... Where would I keep the spare stuff?! I ain't got space for storing this stuff when I'm not using it, let alone the bother or money to buy it all.
I love autumn and it's getting hotter in New Zealand now but I'll be in the USA soon and I'm way too excited to see how they do autumn and buy into all this shit hahaha
but I do not understand how someone can enjoy the cold. IF THEY CAN, GOOD ON THEM, but I can't, it's too cold. I hate this season xD
In the end, everyone did, Chester...
It’s haunting to think this is the last time we’re going to hear his voice
Thinking about the all person that i am missing very badly..\nLoveFromIndia.
We all love you chester! Rest easy my dude. You're my role model and one day i wanna be like you! for Chester💔😞😭❤❤
Who cares that his light went out? We all do... 💔
I can't stop crying. I care and I can't believe what happened. I hope you can see how much people care for you. People who didn't even know you personally. People who wanted to know you. To be just like you. You didn't deserve this and if you think you did than you're wrong because with every person that hates you there's another thousand people who love you. I deserve to die more than you did. You were more talented than most people could ever even dream of being. RIP Chester😔

Chester will never actually be gone, his memory will live on. His legacy will continue on. He will live on in our hearts and through us. His fans, his family, and his band
My first introduction to metal was LP so I have to give major ultra respect to the band. \n\nRest in peace Chester. You're the reason why I started to play guitar. \n\nMaybe when I pass on Ill be able to tell you how much of an influence you were to me. \n\nRIP Brother
Not even watching the video and I'm crying. 😭
R.I.P \n;( \nthe light flickered in that sky...
M really glad that they showed indian fans😄
He saved many but we couldn't save him     #R.I.P  CHESTER
The pain, it will never go away.
I listen to linkin park but I was never a huge huge fan but The news about Chester broke my heart and this is so emotional
Man fuck y'all, crying n shit... y'all didn't give a fuck when he was alive, he was forgotten to all of you. Now he's dead and everyone wants to act like he was always on your mind. Bullshit.
im crying and im not even a huge fan of there music, yes i like there music but i dont listen to it 24\7
I miss you so much Chester. Your light will never stop shining in my sky❤️
Really beautiful and emotional I want to cry
Just cause you cant see it, doesnt mean it isnt there just like Chester.
everyone press F to pay respects
Im crying so much right now. The fact that he's gone right now, it's to sad to even think about
never forget he's up in the stars watching over all of us in loving memory: chester bennington, fly high we love you dude, you've got me out of hard times but to see you go torn me apart...But I know you're in a good place.. ~Benno
I've learned that depression can't be fixed with medication. Medication leads to more medication and more depression. We need to find alternative ways to fix depression, holistic methods. #StopThePills
Chester for ever in our hearts
this made me cry 😭
i feel VERY LUCKY to be born in the era where i could listen to linkin park.....the era where linkin park ruled music.....the era where linkin park ruled our hearts...
Sadness is watching that one line disappeared from their logo!
1k people don't know how hurt it is
This made my heart break,  I see how so many people from different backgrounds feel and love the same way. We need to come together and embrace our differences and love one another, for those differences, are what make us special.
there are indian people too.
1k people have no heart at all.

thanks all the guys, you guys made this too much better. Obrigado todo mundo que participou desse video, era essa alegria que ele sempre admirava, verdadeira e simples.
Linkin Park is like ice cream... They go good with everything :') R.I.P. Chester. May you forever be in out hearts ❤️
Linkin park really helped me while growing up, I just wanted to thank you Chester for all those amazing songs and awesome years you helped me go through....\nWho cares if one more light goes out? Well I do....\n#RipChester
💔😢 CB...in my heart forever.
Too bad he had to go out on a bad album
Almost as sad as the music video 😭
I adored him since I was just 11 years old... his music helped me through depression and suicide. I'm now 23 and loving life. I'm working hard to be a medical assistant. When he passed away, it felt like a part of me went with him. I'll forever listen to his music like I always did. ♡♡♡
I'm crying wach this video. I'm always cry if i hear chester voice :'(  i think i can see mike and crew in indonesia
It's hard listening to Linkin Park. It's not the same . Every song has much more meaning than it did .
The Transformers movies introduced me to Linkin Park. This band was a big part of my childhood. I will never ever forget those memories and will continue to listen to this band.\n\nLove you Chester❤️\n\nRest in peace...
Fuck those 1K haters, they don't respect Chester Bennington's death or they're just following their haters friends demands. FUCK THEM! I LOVE LINKIN PARK AND NOBODY WILL FORCE ME TO HATE LINKIN PARK
R.I.P Chester <3 We Love You and care about that One More Light\n\nSending love and support from me and the UK
This is so perfect and sad ofc at the same time.\nI'm fucking crying
I wish chester can see that
This makes me sad... :c

We freaking did it, 10M subscribers! Linkin Park will be proud, including Chester.
Cameras are dope
tbh portrait mode looks like a photoshop
That ISSA 21 savage ! 👌🏾👌🏾
$399 nope
That's awesome
Just awesome
21 savage a banger🤙🏽☝️
The specs are a bit to low for me but the front firing speakers make up for it
does it has status light??
Am I the only one that likes how the smaller pixel 2 looks? I mean honestly I'm in it for the front facing speakers, great software experience and optimization. I'm also tired of phablets as well so there's that.
the smaller one has only oled, the bigger one has poled
we want camera comparisons!! like if u agree
Waiting for full review
It looks ugly
BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL
Colorizer? I think you mean circular polarizer.
Ugly crap
Shit... You had me till The removal of the headphone jack :(
I heard you stole a seat from someone at the conference?
My reaction....... booooorrriiinng.
3:43 fuck face
0:20 Pixel 2 has AMOLED display i think . XL has POLED.
Bank Account?
Pixel 2 XL, here I come.
Snappy Snapdragon...
Pixel 2 xl or note 8?
Pixel 2 is hideous. Pixel 2 XL looks alright.
Nice  video 👍 😃
LG V30+ > Iphone 8 Plus > Iphone SE > OnePlus 5 > Iphone X > Pixel 2 > RAZR flip phone > Nokia brick phone > SCAMSUNG S8 and Note 8
I wate for IPhone x 📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱
Ok this might sound dumb but what’s the difference between usb 2.0 and usb 3.0
Apple: We got the ugliest phone ever. Google: Hold my beer
Instead of making the thing thinner, google could implement a headphone jack, wireless charging, maybe a better battery and the camera wouldnt be sticking out..
Any of you guys think this phone beats the iPhone x? It has a pretty fair price
im gonna have to try it out myself too. the way it sounds is that google blew apple out of the water given what has been revealed in the past few weeks. if i heard right then pixel 2 has fast charing straight from the box, nothing additional to buy?! wow!
Does both phones have RGB notification light or not? I cannot find a concrete information anywhere.
Kinda Blue = Manatee. Come one Google, get on point with the color names.
Neither
the smaller pixel 2 has an AMOLED panel not a POLED
Can i get that iphone 8 please i still got a iphone 5s , my instagram is vstacks_
What about HDR 10 or Dolby Vision support? Google didn't say a word about it.
Lol evidently you need to memorize more of your music library. :P
The phone isn't that impressive unless you're into stock android. Its like all the reviewers are forced to say positive things about the device. If any othe OEM released a phone with similar features they'd butcher it. They practically did already tho... HTC, Bixby button etc.
These phones are way better than the iPhone 8
Pro-tip: Better sound quality with Bluetooth on Android O is already possible. Thank you Sony. Activate developer options and you will see the new LDAC codec as selectable, which allows audio streaming up to 990kbps. You can also now select the sampling rate and sample size.
So savage to blur out that other guy (his army is coming to get you)
I have an s8, I feel like getting these phones isn't really an upgrade. But your getting fast updates, pure Android experience but no headphone jack, no face or iris scanner, less water resistance..... Decisions decisions.....
No. Only LG phones have a 18:9 aspect ratio, that's why the top and bottom bezels are bigger. The s8 and note 8 have 18,5:9 displays, thus utilizing more of the space on the front
Did anyone else notice something strange at 3:09-3:10 with the blur that it applied in the third portrait shot where he was standing _behind_ the camera? It looks like it kept him in focus but blurred the camera out. :/ Technically both he and the camera should be in focus while everything in the background is blurred. I'm guessing it's probably because the machine learning looks for a human and keeps that in focus while making everything else blurry.
The phone sounds great but I don't think the display looks that appealing, it looks washed out. The tech in the phone sounds amazing!
Easily the best preview on the Pixel 2 and 2 XL! Still on the fence whether to get the Pixel 2 or 2 XL.  I have a red iPhone 7 plus, but not a fan of the size.  The smaller Pixel 2 would be perfect, but will the dated look bother me - hmmm
so the only complaints i see on this phone are with looks and headphone jack. So like, the least important aspects of a phone are what people complain about. LoL
I’m wondering which one is better between LG v30 and pixel2 XL in term of daily performance.
That’s a lit phone
Great informational review. Like always, great video.
Astute watchers will ponder whether he got coffee with Kyle or not...
This phone looks like a winner. Sure, it has a little bit of bezels, but it’s functionality and camera make up for it...And that unlimited photo/video cloud storage. Hyped.
Fantastic video ! I'm not even going to buy the Pixel but I enjoyed this. Thanks.
No headphone jack🤔 I thought they liked that thing.I guess they’ll be copying Apple from now on.
The normal one would look and prob just feel alot better with curved edges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is coming from a g6 user
I am excited about Pixel 2 XL, but damn, I live in Latin America, and here, they don't sell those phones.\nFor Google, we are so poor and we do not cover their needs, that's why we aren't gonna see Google in a near future.\nGreetings from Mexico City, Mexico.
Blah blah blah. If you want great camera, get a DSLR.
I'm I the only one who doesn't get the sudden obsession with bezel size?
It's called a polarizer my dude
please someone tell me the diference betwen this and the samsung s8. i mean even google lens= bixby vision
Why is the flash and the camera swapped on some, but Normal on others?
I'm buying! Was going for the V30 but saw it today at Verizon and it's much wider than i thought. The V30 wasn't a very comfortable fit in my hand.
Honestly, i dont really like the new design i kind of like the old design better but thats just how i feel
Best thing is the front firing speakers 👍
Personally I would love it if you do a video showing and comparing a few sound options. E.g how does audio sound using regular corded in ear earphones over the provided dongle? Would buying a different dongle improve sound? How does audio over the dongle compare to audio from the 3.5mm jack on first pixel. Perhaps also test some native usbc headsets and Bluetooth options so we can get a better understanding of sound quality across the different options we now have.
The front panel on the Pixel 2 looks really cheap compared to the XL.
XL looks ok, but Pixel is really meh~ 2015 looking. First iPhone then Pixel, I don't appreciate they are doing this. Just give us the best only!
Definitely looking forward to the in depth review. Also get a hold of Google's new headphones and do a review on them.
Honestly if you’re upgrading from an older phone with big bezels then the bezels on the smaller pizel won’t be a big deal. I just got an IPhone 8 Plus and I’ve never been like “wow this phone is so unwieldy”
Why do people keep whining about no headphone jack? Like really it has 2 stereo speakers, the reason for a headphone is to make it sound louder or to stop people from hearing what you hear, if you use headphones to make it louder, you don't have to now because of those 2 stereo speakers
I can’t wait to get my hands on this phone.
I have the first Google pixel and it's utter garbage, so im definitely not getting either of these.
I want the iphone! Please!
Can anyone comment on why every video of the XL the display looks washed out.
Why are the names so dumb?
Wow was planning on getting one but it is ugly
chin and forehead are too big on the pixel 2.
That fast charging is using Power Delivery 2.0 standard that is a part of the USB Type-C spec. In order to use Power Deliver 2.0 you need to have a USB Type-C connector on both ends of the cable, so both the phone and charger need to have a Type-C port.\n\nI have no idea why Samsung and other manufactures are still using Type-A chargers and QC. Type-C Power Delivery is the way to go for charging since it can provide much greater throughput... hence the reason why some laptops are now using Type-C for charging.
2:36 your chain was proper fuckin your audio up 🤔
1:44 all of the phones he mentions here are a better buy than the pixel xl. Also, who in their right mind would buy the smaller pixel? The front looks like a nexus 5x
Good work and thank you. Can't way for mine.... hurry November
Finally people don’t have to make fun of Apple because of the headphone jack
Worth an upgrade if you have the Pixel 1?
It's nice to see Android phones getting caught up with live photo's and portrait mode. LMFAO. Next up: wireless charging and dual camera setup. Grabs popcorn
Looks like a great phone, but let's be realistic, the squeeze is a gimmick, a ton of fast ways to get to assistant, a song's name coming up on screen off when your listening to the radio (without wanting to know) is nothing short of annoying, design is not good, dual speakers are excellent, will be the fastest android, but to say xyz is excellent = not true
Yea no headphone jack no go I don't care what else it does. Sigh looks like all the new Smartphones are going to start following the dumbest trend in the industry.
It's called a polarizer, not a colorizer.
I’m a massive Apple guy, always have bought iPhones, but this pixel 2 really tickles my fancy
i'm sorry, but why do people keep criticising phones with bezels? It doesn't affect the performance of the phone and i don't see it as a significant factor? Who is going to be deterred from purchasing a phone because it has bezels? This new trend of 'bezel-less' phones has only come about over the past year, i think it's ridiculous
Pixel 2 XL is a no brainier
Men like it big too 😂😂 no homo
Pixel is better than iPhone 7. And they have a headphone ja- \nOh. Never mind.
No headphone jack, No micro SD card slot, Not water resistant = Pass
Well that was very disappointing. When I saw Google mocking Apple for removing their head phone jack i thought this would ensure the jack to stay in the pixel 2.   CONS: No head phone jack, added camera hump, thick bezels are my deal breakers. I'll stick to my Nexus 6P for another year.
The XL is obviously the cream of the crop.\n\niPhone X is essentially an upgraded app launcher with nothing new to offer except a $1,000 price tag and a rediculously ugly unibrow. Oh, and fast charging that will cost you an extra $49 to unlock.\n\nS8 with TouchWiz, Bixby and bloatwear? (need I say more?) yaaaaaaawn ..no thanx.\n\nV30? Don't know why this phone is even in the conversation. I know you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but the fact that it looks like a cheap plastic piece of crap doesn't help.\n\nAnyway.. I think the Panda XL will be the one most sought after, after all.. it is the sexiest.\nWhat do you guys think?
taco bell would NEVER do this\n\nare you sure about that rhett?

달고 느끼하다는 느낌이었죠...
로이스 초콜릿중에 감자칩에다가 초코 코팅해서 파는거 있어요! 한국 브랜드는 아니지만...
더블초코소스도 맛있지만 맥도날드감자튀김은 스위트칠리소스에 찍어먹는게 제일 맛있는듯
단을 보고있다가 생각이 났는데...\n한국의 전통주는 마셔보셨나요?\n마트나 편의점 같은곳에서 파는 소주가 아닌 \n안동소주, 이강주, 면천두견주, 한산소곡주 등등\n맛과 풍미가 가득한 전통주를 마셔보는 영상보고싶어요~^^\n지금까지와 다른 한국의 술맛을 느끼실수 있을겁니다\n아!! 상품화 되어있는거말고 기회가 된다면 직접 찾아가서 맛보는걸로~~~

so are you suggesting you'd put chocolate with kimchi??
I’m from the Midwest USA. And we sometimes dip our fries in milkshakes so chocolate sauce on fries is not a far stretch...the quality of chocolate sauce may be the issue ƪ(^_^)ʃ
This reminds me of a food I ate A LOT in high school. Dunno if you guys have Wendy's over in the UK, but if you ever happen to be in the States again, you gotta try their fries and chocolate frosty. Together. It's flippin' amazing~

Sometimes reporting on these things hits me hard. I know I've said it before, and I'll continue to say it but please call, text, email, or better yet tell someone in person you love them today. The world can be so cruel and our time isn't guaranteed. In case someone hasn't said it to you today, I love ya, Nation. <3
I'm really sad that I can't donate blood because of how small I am.
When you act like a good person by saying you're not monetizing this video, but it's against YouTube policy to monetize a video of a tragedy in the first place.
What's really starting to upset me, is the fact that this stuff is no longer getting to me. I'm rapidly reaching the point that I just don't care when this stuff happens. Nobody wants to solve the problems. It's just hand wringing, defenses from gun fanatics, pressure to do something, thoughts and prayers and then nothing happens. We turned flying into one of the most anguishing experiences after 9/11 but after how many mass shootings we still won't do anything about this problem? We're gonna keep making better and better guns while making them relatively easy to get and defunding mental health services at the same time? Yeah, no. Nothing could possibly go wrong with that.
The number 32 will always be my favorite number because it always seems to pop up in the weirdest of ways, but sure wasn't ever expecting to hear it was the floor that a mass murderer was shooting people from. Thats definitely one of the top weirdest ones.
DUDE YOU MUST BREATH THROUGH YOUR EARS CAUSE YOUR NEVER STOP TALKING . . . . .
1. Steven is not a mass murderer he is a victim of the Las Vegas 'set up' to push gun control legislation on Americans.... he is the 60th victim of this deep state massacre!!\n2. Giving up your guns when you have a psychopathic untouchable deep state prepared to lay waste to your people in order to acheive their political agenda is pure insanity!!\n3 The factual inconsistencies in this narrative are irreconcilable with this man being an antifa lone wolf mass muderer.\n* What about the 2 women who ran through the crowd telling everyone you are all about to die. \n*What about the footage of light given off by rifle fire on the 12th or 13th floor and the lack of it on the 32nd floor\n*what about the footage captured by the female taxi driver where you can hear gunshots coming from different places simultaneously and basically on top of each other...impossible for a single shooter to be two places at once \n* How convenient for him to shoot himself and not have to be questioned or even hold up in the room keeping authorities at bay for any duration of time.\n*what about FEMA who just happened to be holding a terrorism drill that weekend -(who knew holding a terrorism drill was code for staging a mass shooting)\nNote to self - stay away from wherever FEMA is holding 'terrerorism drills'!!!\n* what about the photos showing a chest wound in addition to his head wound\n* why the gloves for a man with ZERO interest or knowledge of guns\n* how could a man without gun knowledge and training use the rifle so well first time\n* how did he get all those guns and bullets passed newly installed metal detectors\n* what about the 3 news stations who began reporting the incident BEFORE it began...let that sink in...ready🎥 ....and action🎬!!! \n* What about his neighbour and drinking buddy who said he was a TRUMP SUPPORTER with ZERO interest in guns and the friendliest guy on the planet. \n- That's why he's dead btw they needed someone accessible and trusting enough to befriend a stranger and take them into their hotel room and be set up and that was all this friendly social affable guy did wrong...he walked right into being the perfect patsy!!!\n...more footage from security cameras inside and outside of the hotel and eye witness acounts from staff and concert goers are going to lead to even more inconsistencies, the official narrative is an unsubstantiated insult to intelligence!!
gabby giffords and her nasa freemason astronaut husband are also part of the fake deceptions!!!!)
People in main steam media love BAD and TRAGIC news.  It increases their viewership
This is the new normal
I listened to an old interview with Kingsley Amis today and he said in that interview he was just glad people could love who they wanted and the era of wars was over and the world is a safer place and then I saw this.
I honestly don't think the actual killer is dead. Why do something like this for fame if you're not going to be around to bask in the glory of your accomplishment, being that was his goal. I am not saying I agree with what he did because that's f@%#ed. All I am saying is if it's soo easy to frame an innocent person and send them to prison. It's actually easier to frame a recently dead guy. he killed 55 people before police found him, yet I would bet money that the evidence to convict said would be killer was just another victim.
HOAX
The recipe of shootings like this is pretty set in stone. Big shooting happens. Everyone runs around like headless chickens spewing anything that could even be remotely connected to it. Or at the very least may appear to be connected. Then there's the crazies and idiots that deliberately lie about responsibility and spread false info. And then about 2-3 days follows of a giant clusterfuck of all sorts of bullshit floods the info lanes. Slowing down the real information getting to the forefront. Then it starts turning into the same old song and dance called gun control where the usual suspects scream at each other from the safety of their little internet fort.\n\nQuite frankly, its rather annoying. Wish people who have no fucking clue what's going on did some basic legwork before spewing nonsense. And those deliberately lying just stop. Also, if you want to talk gun control. How about you focus on making it harder to obtain illegal weapons, or obtaining weapons illegally in general. I get it, you want some regulations in place for how to legally obtaining weapons. But you're never going to be able to properly adjust for that unless you deal with the illegal side off it first.
More gun control, thoughts and prayers, banning things, government control and making more laws is NOT going to stop massacres. If someone wants to kill a mass amount of people, they will find a way to do it one way or another. I really wish people would stop believing that more government control needs to be established, I couldn’t think of a more wrong way to go about horrible situations like this.
I wish people would stop making videos on this attack on my city before all the evidence comes out.   Today the local news is saying paddock might have accomplices and he had explosives in his cars and may have had an escape plan to cause more harm.   But go speak more about guns before we find out more of his motive and if he has  people that might be on the run that might cause something more heinous in the near future
Look this is a horrible situation, but i have a suggestion Phil, you have a great news channel but maybe instead of not getting the money from these videos, just get them and donate them to charities that involve that tragedy.
I live in Las Vegas, and the morning after this happened I got 4 texts asking if I was alright, and I read them before I even knew this happened and I was terrified.
If this is what the US is, I'm glad not to be American
Trump visited the fake actors this don't look good for him if this really fake.
it doesn't make sense.... why all the guns and not more ammo.... this stinks of false flag.
Your neutrality on the news reports is such a breath of fresh air in this bullshit world. All I've seen since this tragedy is conspiracy theories and gun control squabbles, as well as people blaming things totally unconnected. Almost nothing about the victims. Thank you Phil, for giving them the respect they deserve and for not giving the animal who did this the spotlight. I appreciate you so much.
Argument: Gun control wouldn't work on criminals, therefore there's no point.\nCounter Argument: Making murder illegal hasn't worked on criminals, therefore there's no point in keeping it illegal. \nIt's the same argument. Can someone please take a 1st years philosophy class and learn about fallacies.
I I think you're a great person with a great channel, but by not giving the identity of the perpetrator's name, you make ppl only more curious. They are less likely to search him up if his identity is revealed.
it hits me hard that murica kills zivils in the east like in syria everyday. Everyday hundreds of woman, children, babys getting killed from american bomb-carpets. Noone gives a shit. I mean, its sad that there was a man shooting 50 innocent people in las vegas. but this country is doing even more shit in wars they started by themself. wake up guys.
My mother was in Las Vegas for her one year anniversary with her new husband and they were in an Uber when all this happened. She called me at 2 AM letting me know she was OK. All I can think about is if she Uber to a little bit earlier maybe she would've gotten hurt and I feel so blessed that she's alright
It took over an hour to get to the shooter?! That just seems so wild to me. Even wilder is the fact he had 10 weapons on him. 10. Disgusting. My heart hurts so so badly for those killed and injured. Mental health evaluations in order to buy weapons is proving to be more and more important everyday.
Condolences to everyone affected, My heart goes to all of you and I wish you the strength for the hard times to come. This is my opinion but in a DUI we blame the driver, in a bombing we blame the bomber but why in a shooting do we blame the gun? even if guns were banned entirely bad people will find a way to get them, like most illegal things. Yes gun regulation needs a look at but if someone good has a gun at the right time and the right place that's lives that could be saved. Bad people will find a way and D-bags will be D-bags, nothing changes that, this guy might've been sick or whatever, doesn't change the fact he was a bad person and that he just needs to be forgotten, we remember the people affected and will honor their names but not the d-bag.
I feel like there had to be more then one shooter... & I definitely think there should be more control over what weapons are being sold...  I was just at a county music concert a few weeks ago and I don't even want to imagine how it was to go though sometime like this, It's so sad , so many inocente life's gone 😕
So if you can't stop acts of violence  completely there shouldn't be any gun laws at all?? Someone explain that to me. if people don't have guns they'll find another way. So let's make it easy for them???
The news said that Isis said they denied any involvement in the Las Vegas shooting. But the shooter said otherwise in a book he wrote in along with other guns in his hotel room. How did he bring in such big guns without the hotel noticing anything weird
its a normal day why coz its not you know who is not init.thats why its not all over in the news
3:33 wow... The child of porn legend Johnny Sins' took one of his behind the scenes glamor shots and tweeted it out as a fake missing persons plea. He must be so embarrassed right now.
The Nevada legal definition of terrorism is different from the actual definition of terrorism...
Philip DeFranco \nGREAT JOB PHILIP!!!!!!!!\nON TELLING THE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH!!!!!!\nYOU DID A GREAT JOB POSTING THE FACTS AT THE TIME YOU KNEW WHAT YOU DID.\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE YOU MADE THIS VIDEO.\nTHAT IS VERY VERY GOOD ON YOU, AND YOUR STAFFS BEHAVE!! \nKEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!!!<3
Big question: Who are the ones disliking this video? Is there literally 3,000 trolls watching this video just to dislike it?? He's merely discussing a tragedy and giving information in order to help the victims. I'm so not clear what is there to freaking dislike?!?!?!?!
I need to make money off a tragedy buy masking it with a fundraiser is the true title.
ISIS trying to be responsible dat fuzzed up \n\n\n\n\n\ncause they want to save the shooter \n\n\n\n\n\nS.M.H
Imagine if a muslim did it.\nThe media would have blamed my religion.
But Is he a Terrorist  yes or no?
The American people need to stand up to this continual gun crimes - Start marches and demonstrations -please keep them peaceful  but make sure the government gets the message monthly demonstrations will be great. \n\nI suggest americans  have marches and ensure  that the government pass new legislation to have  more gun control  since without marches more shootings will occur in the future. \n\nThe  Trump government or any other american government will not be able to help you when new shootings begin.\n\n I feel great sympathy for those shot in Las Vegas, but the only way to stop more shootings the american people must demonstrate otherwise the government will continue and allow guns to be sold to any one. \n\nThe best way is to stop all guns being sold - why doesn't the american government act  now---or have a referendum  let the people
Yo Phil open your eyes it's a false flag attack by the Cia
I will say what I've said since leaning the difference between Canada's gun laws and Americas gun laws. \nYou can't act surprised when a weapon of war is used to kill people.\nModern automatic and semiautomatic rifles, pistols, machine and sub machine guns are weapons of war.\nThey are designed to do 1 thing and 1 thing only. Kill and harm human beings. That was their main design and not only that but they were designed to be user friendly. To be efficient in live combat.\nThere's a reason you didn't have mass shootings in the wild west. All they had were revolver pistols and rifles, bolt and lever action rifles and barreled or lever action shotguns.\nThose guns are not designed for war, they are designed mainly for hunting.
All these attacks happening in the world but VEGAS? Beautiful place and no high security? Just makes you wonder that nowhere is safe anymore. Heart goes out to those who lose their lives ❤
I get not showing the killers face so you can deny some notoriety but showing a flag that has flown above hundreds to thousands of  brutal executions is doing the same exact thing. Anyone with knowledge of liveleak and a strong stomach has seen  human beings killed in the most brutal fashion (ie beheadings w det cord/having a car w prisoners shot at with an rpg/ drownings in a swimming pool/thrown from buildings). The Kurds I work with call ISIS 'dogs'. Don't say you won't show this guy and still raise the IS flag up shortly after. My 2¢, thanks.
If you think gun control doesnt work you you are just ignorant of all the evidence. It works, its as simple as that. It reduces mass shootings, violent crime, suicides etc. countries with gun control are often just flat out better places to live, not some messed up oppressive regime
If you want to shoot in Chicago guess what you do, drive to Indiana. Federal laws are needed.
Have we figured out a profile for all these terrorist in America?
You need to make your videos about gun control because you say that there will be a big debate over the next month but there won't!
If I fell off my bike I'm pretty sure isis would claim responsibility.
This guy is an ignorant corporate puppet not able to comprehend the situation and how he is contributing to the downfall of his country. The government wants to abolish the second amendment for obvious reasons and if you would research outside of mainstream media you will find the lies fed to you are quite disturbing. Don't believe anything you are told, consider all information available and form your own opinion, Phillip de Franco is not qualified to give you any of this information.
Phil, it's motifs and videos like this is the reason why you've had rock solid respect in my book after many many years of watching.
the mass shooting was differently a false flag shooting im from texas and live in texas and they are already say more gun control fuck that if you try and take my guns my whole state will shoot.
This just proves the point that terrorism can not just be accredited to foreign factions or terrorist groups. We need to understand that the threat can come from anywhere. Its so sad to say that we need to be vigilant about our own safety.
Was the said man as a shooter, framed or scapegoated? It sounds really strange, like Oswald.
false flag, there were 2 shooters and its been caught on camera and on phone calls that were to at least 2 because gun shots sounds were coming from two different directions and i bet it was set up to disarm the american public.
I'm not one for conspiracy theories but in the videos I've watched of the recent Las Vegas shootings you can clearly hear multiple automatic weapons fire from multiple different locations and it begs the question, why are the mainstream media trying to cover up the truth?!
Gun control vultures always swarm on tragic events. Funny how a guy targets a conservative majority event and conservatives get blamed.
There was no spent brass on the floor in the shooter's room.
I don’t want to be a part of the divisiveness anymore. I feel regret from taking a part in it. I’m done.
Not terrorism. I get that you want to place that on something for someone so evil but use the definition as intended so that we can distinguish the differences.
yo phil the best case i can give you for proof of gun control working just look at australia
You're a good dude, Phil. Always appreciate your reasonable level-headed stance on things, and I agree with not showing the name/face of the killer and focusing on the victims and people who help.
Your very impartial I really enjoy your style of news presentation you try and cover all aspects and not swing left or right
Remember: The demographic of people responsible for the most deaths of human beings is governments (just in the 20th century we had Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, the Kims, Mussolini, and Saddam Hussein, amongst others) and gun bans don't apply to them. Gun ban = assigning wolves with the task of disarming the sheep to protect the peaceful sheep from the violent sheep.
Thank you, Philip. I'm saddened by the fact that so many are using this situation to spread more theories and dramatics about things unrelated, unprovable, and unnecessary when we should be focused on the real topics at hand. When we should see an event like this and come together as a nation, as a people and make changes happen to help prevent this type of thing in the future.
The fake victim, 3:33, on the right is a porn star i believe.
Bump fire stocks dont sound like that. Sounds like a M240 Bravo. just another deep state bullshit.
Finally a guy with common sense! I hate how the media seems glorify these acts of violence!\nGun control, isn't the problem! Mental Health issues and society itself is the problem!
You would think that Aldean would have told people to run over his microphone. The POS, p*ssy.
Too bad no one believes it.
Why gun control isn't a thing I'll never understand (apart from the fact gun companies sponsor the government)\n\nBut look, Australia banned guns after their worst massacre, haven't had one as bad since.
I really can’t stand this bullshit anymore. I feel like a parent who’s disappointed in their children. Every time some shooting happens I usually brush it off and forget, but good god damn this one just hurts. I can’t understand it. The more I see and read, I mean, it’s just rough. I can’t understand why anyone would do this to people. Innocent people just going to listen to some music. I hate what the world is becoming. I hate that I have to raise my son in such a fucked up, unsafe world.
Las Vegas was a false flag.
Loved how he had the humility to leave out the like and subscribe part! Love ya Frankie ❤
Yep the world is dying. There no peace without conflict. There's no love without hate. Those were Thompson guns being shot out. Halloween massacre. This is why i say it was a Thompson https://youtu.be/x4QWrha3HLw it's the mafia. They usually hang in casinos. My whole life is based on nightmares so i don't care. We did terrorism in the past by blowing up Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Vietnam.
lone wolf my ass , pure terrorists evil white man
I called my Grandma at 1am... She was not happy...
Gun control will work, because everyone knows criminals always obey the law and will turn their all their guns in; because it's the right thing to do. #thoughtsandprayers
It was a falseflag
who cares where going to have never ending terrorism in future anyways. alah akbar
So here's some evidence of the effectiveness of gun control laws, summarizing this article from a neutral source: \n\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/gun-control-australia-updated/\n\n-Australia suffered a gun massacre in 1996: 35 dead, 18 injured.\n-The National Firearms Agreement was passed as a result. Some semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were banned and stricter registration/licensing policies were implemented. There was also a huge amount of buybacks, and 700,000 guns were sold to the government. Laws were further tightened in 2002.\n-There were 23% fewer homicides in 2013 than there were in 1996, though some fluctuation in between.\n-13 gun massacres happened in the 18 years before the NFA, 0 gun massacres in the 18 years after.\n-“In the seven years before the NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate per 100,000 was .43 (range .27 to .60) while for the seven years post NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate was .25 (range .16 to .33).”\n-“The number of homicide incidents involving a firearm decreased by 57 percent between 1989-90 and 2013-14”\n\n*This doesn't prove or disprove anything*  Whatever your opinion, I encourage everyone to do their own research. Have a great day, stay alive |-/
I can't really comment on the laws and gun control in the United States as I have never been there.\nThat being said. Being an Australian and living with our gun control laws that were implemented after only ONE mass shooting, I can send my nieces and nephews out in public without the constant thought of if they will be shot to death by someone who got their hands on a weapon because background checks weren't carried out correctly.\nI have never understood why anyone would need Semi/Automatic weapon as personal protection and it shouldn't be allowed. \nA small hand gun is good enough for your home and that is where they should stay. Locked up in your home, to protect you in your home.\nEveryone spewing that any change to the laws regarding weapons will remove your freedoms... why do you need guns to be free? If you do, clearly you're not free and you should probably look at why you need a weapon to feel it.
The shooter had no criminal record and was cleared of all background checks.  He purchased most(or all) of the guns legally.  Tell me, how could you have predicted that this one person would've committed the worst mass shooting in the US to date? The fact that he was able to get his hands on SO many weapons without a blip in the system goes to show the weakness in our system.  Yes, people kill people but guns facilitate the killing. A valid reason to have a single or limited firearm would be for instance, running a jewelry store. But the fact that this scum of the earth got his hands on so many guns without raising a red flag is the issue here.  If he had just a single handgun, there would be far fewer casualties.  \n\nIf other countries are able to implement effective gun control, eliminating future mass murder cases, why can't we? \n\nThe second point that Franco notes is also very important - the media is glorifying these killers. There should be laws for these criminals to remain unnamed and to focus solely on the victims.  People who commit crimes like these want the attention in their own very sick ways but we should wipe their existence from our minds and memories asap.
American people deserve to see the note left behind in the hotel room.
I don't understand why its so hard to have an honest debate in America about gun control. A blanket gun ban has helped many countries become safer. I understand that the issue of black market guns would be a huge hurdle - but America is far from being a civilized nation with it's current course. \nThe whole country is propped up on superficial industries (much more so than most first world nations), and the gun industry is one of them - I understand losing it would be a huge economical blow, which is what the right is afraid to admit - just as the left is afraid to admit that they do indeed want an all out gun ban. \nWatching from the outside it seems like the spiral in the U.S. is just continuining, with major issues like distaster relief and the education system, the rehabilitation system for criminals, taxes and practically every major political issue being subverted to enhance the lifes of a few powerful people (left or right). The debt to China is massing in amounts that will make the U.S. a surrogate state with practically no political influence over Asia - and instead of having an honest discussion of why the American Dream has fallen so low, it seems like you squabble like children about who can read document from 1787 the best. \nIt really is disheartening to see such a great country fall so low. I truly and honestly hope America finds its way back to a strong and just nation, looking out for its people, and the people around the world - but right now the dream of being the best country in the world is an illusion with practiaclly no justification behind it.

Free fisherofmen.
3:33 nope.
Here are the facts.\nA man gets 400 pounds of equipment up 30 floors, past casino level hotel security, without being seen on camera, sets up a sniper nest, removed  a window that is composed of over 800 pounds of hurricane proof glass, then laid down fire for 10 minutes straight, with inconsistent weapon and bullet types based on sound, sometimes shooting two distinct successions of fire at the same time, using an illegal full auto weapon, that he apparently got from some gun store, despite his family saying he never even liked guns. \n\nThose are the facts. That is what apparently happened. If you think that sounds suspicious then you're an insensitive biggot.\n\nAlso, he somehow got rid of all the bullet casings. And the people he shot somehow bled bright red, almost pink paint like substances. None of the videos showing any bullet wounds.\n\nAlso somehow he got some people from other tragedies like Baltimore and sandy hook to show up. Same people. Doing the same things. Crying on the phone, playing dead, etc.\n\nHe also placed an ad on Craigslist far in advance advertising for an actor crowd. And was then led to a website where you can hire a crowd of actors for basically any purpose.\n\nYes. Those are the facts. Thank God every Hollywood liberal and government official didn't even wait until the bodies were cold to discuss gun control. What perfect timing.
Tulsa Oklahoma???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
They should ban automobiles in europe cause obviously they can be used as terrorism
Gun control doesn't work, except in Japan, Germany, England, Canada...
To all those Americans who feel their “freedom” will be impacted if their guns are taken away think of all the freedom you will gain being able to go to school and public events in peace. Starting to think Americans will never learn from their mistakes. Come to Australia we have no mass shootings and Sephora its a win win.
I'm glad I don't live in America
Instead of them introducing Uncle Benjin during this time and having a reunion with Jon, they decided to spend thousands if not millions on a stupid ass polar bear. They could have sent Benjin to the wall to get Davos to send ravens instead of having gendry run 30 miles an hour to get there.
This scene was unnecessary, why didn't you use it to build up Benjins return instead? The writers of this season was stupid as shit, people didn't start liking GOT because of the crazy action but because of the characters, and although action is awesome, it gets tasteless if you don't have a good plot line to follow it. Please get good again in the last season thanks
Dear Game of Thrones: FYI, for S8 we would rather have the direwolves over war elephants from Essos... Sincerely, The Fans\nP.S. No one wanted a fooking polar bear when we could have had scenes with Ghost!
Quit bragging about something that is literally the biggest waste of time and resources in the entire show. I still liked this season, but it's no secret the writing has taken a nosedive recently, and when keep seeing you guys talking about your zombie polar bear you had to work so hard as a team to get in, it makes me realize just how much worse at writing compelling entertainment the Davids are than George.
Of all the things in season seven, this bullshit is what pissed me off the most (besides Littlefinger and the Jonerys buffoonery) This story is supposed to be about people. It's supposed to be about treachery and relationships and the complexity of human nature. It's not spending millions of dollars on a fucking zombie polar bear. D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island). This is really long and congrats of you got to the end but in conclusion: D&D can go fuck themselves. We don't need these fuckers in charge.
We didn’t even see Ghost in season 7! Sansa only mentioned him :(
I appreciate the bear but would have preferred Ghost . Atleast once in the season.
Why the fuck is a zombie polar bear cool again??? \n\nD&D are fucking idiots.
If somebody ever asks me what's so bad about being mainstream, I will point them to this fucking polar bear.
i prefer ghost over this unnecessary wight bear scene
Just saw the 14 minute version of this...simply amazing 😊👍
I'm glad we got this polar bear that nobody remembered or talked about after the episode was over. I mean, we had to trade off ghost, a super important character to the story that carries loads of symbolism, so we didn't have him during the uniting of the two biggest characters of the entire show, no matter what kind of symbolism could have been carried through him, but it was all worth it in the end for this epic polar bear. The one that nobody remembers. The one that had no narrative purpose whatsoever.
Its a real shame the show seems to be giving in to what the fans want e.g 70% action episodes. It may be what people want but what they want may not necessarily be good for the show. The drawn out discipline and diplomacy of season 6, skipping out what could have been massive action scenes (such as Stannis at Winterfell) lead to the final 2 episodes being the biggest pay offs in TV history for many viewers. I feel game of thrones is just been rushed now, like this zombie polar bear contributed nothing to the plot. No one important died from it, it didn't lead to anything they just killed it and moved on. It was just action for the sake of action. Smart, thought out intelligent screen writing with good pay offs and twists made game of thrones great. Not pointless action like in the walking dead.
This is why we didn't see ghost. They spent all the budget on Toby the bear.
Hey Guys! This Is Brilliant! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 𝕏𝔹𝕆𝕏 $𝟝𝟘𝟘 𝕡𝕣𝕠𝕞𝕠 𝕔𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Topfreegiftcardsin2017now
Why Polar bear? Where is the spiders big as hounds. Disappointment!
Loved that scene, it was epic 😱
Hit the play button, fluffed my pillow behind my back, sat back to watch the Zombie Polar Bear - video already finished.\nThanks fooking Game Revealed!
Not gonna lie... the thumbnail of the zombie polar bear shit looks like Rap Monster😂👀
Youre not a bear, your name is Toby
This reminds me of Ralph the movie maker
FUCK THE ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR!!! THE CGI MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO BRING BACK GHOST!!!! I WANT GHOST!!!!
I didn't even know the bear was a zombie until right now, thought it was just a strange Westeros beast (which anyway it was) now I don't know if I should feel dumb or if I should just blame the directing because this episode must be the most unfocused of the series (like with the bunch of characters dying that weren't even shown before their deaths)
Thoros Of Myr died for a stupid Polar Bear -.-
This bullshit sums up the terrible transformation this show has undergone. I first fell in love with this show not because of pointless spectacular cgi like this, that was basically nonexistent in season 1. I fell in love with the incredibly rich and complex story, the likes of which i had never seen before. Now the story is pretty simple and straightforward, and terribly predictable, and instead of putting effort into the story, the very soul and heart of every show/book/movie, they give us pointless shit lile this.
Can someone address why Kit always has white gunk in his hair in those interview scenes? lol
Your name is Toby ! :)
can't believe Thoros died for this shit
I don't think any of you really like Ghost, you are only here to use him to feel cool and accepted on the internet. No offense to people who really do like him
honestly such a waste of budget
No more shirts and trousers and jackets? RLY?!\nThank You! Thank You from the bottom of my heart!
What do you people want Ghost to do? I wants Ghost for what? Just to walk around? Only few episodes left I rather see the main struggle and such than a diré wolf. Wait for rr to write about Ghost.
I guess they dont film everything on location
Guys, the zombie polar bear wasn't just for the theatrics, it was to give a hint to the audience that animals too can be turned into wights, foreshadowing what happened with Viserion.
Smh guess I'll watch the episode again!
literally nobody gave a shit about the zombie polar bear and you guys are still trying to hype it up... waste of budget :(
DnD just seem like idiots, mostly all the fanbase want ghost to have a more prominent role but no, ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR COS WERE IDIOTS WHO LIKE SEEING SPLOSIONS AND FOIRE
Game of thrones is fucking gay
Any one else think that in season 8, bran is going to tell Jon about how the night king was created and Jon is going to order them to  make him into one in order to stop the NK. Jon will do anything to stop the night king, and if that means giving up his life to save his family and westeros, he'll do it. I don't know what will happen to daenerys but she's for sure going to die some way.
They wasted an episode worth of money on a fucking bear.
Twd should do something like this a zombie animal
all that effort for something so fucking unnessary
I think that title needs more grammatical errors
Should have used the money on writing!
this scene was so confusing to watch honestly I couldn't really follow it the first time I saw the episode I didn't know what was going on
Why are these mini documentaries behind a paywall?? Just upload it to YouTube for fucks sake.
That's right. I stabbed it on the head while it's on fire
And, yet, it would get the shit kicked out of it by a zombie gorilla
It was the blurst of times.
What a fucking shitty scene that nobody wanted.
Head too welove_gameofthrones on Instagram to receive funny memes and theories on game of thrones and it's upcoming season 8 🐺🔥❄️
One of the worst parts of the worst episode of last season. Great use of money guys.
Is that a remix of lollipop.
Why do people think ghost is dead, if we've learned one thing from game of thrones it is that you have to see something die before you know it's dead, and we haven't seen ghost die. Last we saw him was when jon was brought back to life
It was pretty weird, to be honest. -Rory McCann and many GoT fans
Common sense: Why don't you do Ice Spiders as big as hounds? The things that have had multiple mentions throughout the show.\n\nD&D: Nah, just do a random fucking polar bear.
so the polar bear was idubbbz
That polar bear is taking revenge for REVENANT
bear was unnecessary, Where's Ghost? :K
Funny how much they hype this bear but nobody watching really gave a shit
GoT was my favourite show ever and this season ruined it. Thanks to the lazy writing, plot holes and general stupidity and carelessness of DnD. Ruining something so good takes a special kind of stupidity. And you guys proved to have it in spades.
Behind the scenes on how to waste budget
i was very disappointed with this season, i was hoping that the 7th season was going to be the season we were finally going to see Arya in a very graphic sex scene, and seeing her coming across all those Lannister soldiers thought that, that might of been the moment where it was going to happen.
Damn if only all the effort that went into animating the CGI bear went into the actual writing.....
A zombie polar bear? How is this related to, let's say, dragons and all that from ancient history?
as soon as they deviated from the novel I instantly lost all interest
So they swapped Ghost for a\n\n\nMotherfucking corpse of a polar bear?
These scene was very memorable, because that bear was truly terrifying! Cheers HBO one of my favorite moments of Season 7!
Dont get me wrong, i love GoT. But how the fuck is a video with 100k views and 3.5k likes is on trending again?
that polar bear scene was a waste of money and time in my opinion
I really enjoyed season 7 overall, but a zombie polar bear sounds a lot more interesting on paper than it actually is to watch. By far the biggest moment of man, what happened to this show? I experienced in any of the seven episodes.
Fantastich Wonderfull
...That's all?
Rory the cutest!

People are seriously upset with this? Geez, there's no pleasing anyone these days
You guys whine more than 13 year old girls
Any critics of Game of Thrones now; I suggest you go write something 10+Million people are watching , stealing to watch, buying series of the books, making multiple You Tube channels on the topics of the HBO series just about what you write. TRY IT ! I bloody bet nothing you sprawl out will equal half of the people Loving or even just mildly curious how its all going to turn out that watch Game of Thrones . Game of Thrones is not what it once was but it is not a regular t.v. series ....it has to come to an ending ; Game of Thrones has broken t.v. history records . The series is Lovingly and excitedly talked about on talk shows.... even when the series is off season and no one from Game of Thrones is scheduled to be on their talk shows. It wasn't up for any EMMY'S this year due to timing of Game of Thrones being later in the year as usual ; the series was given a Thank You by Stephen for giving other t.v. series a chance and as well as the series being mentioned in the beginning of the EMMY'S song introduction it was mentioned a few more times in praise . The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.  They have their own and one day maybe they will write it .
I've never seen this show in my life, is it good?
I posted a video last week about my love for second hand shopping! If you didn't see that, then here is the link for you! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNjqAaNNgcw <3
Oh, I loved the outfit you were wearing while showing the watch! :)
When will you be posting your hoarding documentary?
make a video showing how you sterilize jewelry?
Floral dress fits you like a glove.You look lovely in all the clothes you've chosen. Love the haul vlogs.x
I own the small sleeping cat (or rather a similar one), but paired with a bigger mommy cat!! Maybe that's why it was such a good bargain :)
Has anyone ever told you you look like lady Diana? At least in my opinion haha. Lovely video as always by the way :)
You say you live very far from minimalism with your hoarding and collecting, but I'm glad you offset that with thrifting!
I think selling a pair of 60 or 80 pound shoes for 20 pounds is still a good deal\nI don't expect those to be sold for 5 pounds
I recommend St Helena hospice they have a wide range of specialist charity shops around Essex not the cheapest but have seasonal sales.
So many of these are seriously so cute.  You may not follow trends (neither do I...why bother) but you seem to have a good sense for things that look good on you.  I love thrift stores!  Found many of my favorite articles of clothing there.
Lovely vid, and such a pretty gal <3
I love the dresses!! You have a great style! I have loved watching you grow and change over the years. You're so lovely Bex!
You truely found some amazing pieces, the dresses suit you so well! I also loove the pants (and the outfit in general) you are wearing in the splitscreen when showing off the watch <3
The charity shops in my area are horrendously expensive :( They sell 2nd hand Primark clothes for more money than Primark charges. \nI loved watching this video :) You are great at modelling!
This has actually inspired me to try thrifting! X
I love aaaall of the things. Beautiful. You look fantastic
Why is this on Trending at 9K views?
Thank you for this video! I love thrift-stores and secondhand clothes; I enjoyed this video a lot, and I would love to see more of these in the future!
YAY <3\namazing video! I LOVE thrifting, most of my clothes is also preloved and i love it.
Those clothes look great on you Beckie!
Cute cat. What happen to your right hand palm?
your jewelry is always amazing!
you sound a bit  breathless hope u are okay
I love the necklace that you're wearing!
Looks like you found some pretty good things. I love the blue skirt and shoes, super cute 😊
Looking gorgeous in your blue floral dress. Have a great day!
I hope you do more hauls in the future! xxx
Lady Rebecca is absolutely beautiful...I dare anyone to object...
I don’t normally watch haul videos, but as someone who when growing up frequently visited thrift shops, I find this quite interesting. You should make more.
I am so jealous of your finds!  Anytime I try out charity/thrift shops I rarely find anything good.  You have a great wardrobe filled with so many lovely finds.
You look amazing and have great modelling skills.  We have confidence in you. :)
I would love more of these videos
That blue dress looks amazing on you. I don't really like wearing second hand clothes, it's just the way I am, but I do get DVDs, old computer games and books from charity shops. DVDs especially, since I am old-fashioned and like physical copies of my films. If you're patient and don't mind being a few years behind the film industry , you can find them in their original plastic cover for no more than £2.99, depending on the area and shop. Jigsaws as well. You never need to buy a jigsaw at full retail price either. The other day I found a sealed copy of SimCity 3000 for £1.25 from a Cancer Research shop.
OMG I used to live in front of the Isle of Wight 😍
I live in Portsmouth so it was great to see someone else loving some of my local places :)
This is such a great video! I would love to see another one of these! Greetings and love from Germany!❤
Hello from the Isle of Wight! I'm a bit of a clothes hoarder and my things have been donated to charity shops all over the island - it's funny to think that you were probably flicking through rails full of my donations, haha!
One of my favorite thrift stores where I live is called Lifelong and they support HIV/AIDS resources in the area in many ways including hosting testing days. I enjoy knowing my already cheap purchase is going to have a bigger impact than shopping fast fashion
I didn't realize shoes could be that inexpensive. I don't think I own a pair of shoes that cost me less that $100.
Beckie, there's a woman working in my local supermarket who looks exactly like you!! You're both beautiful!
You're looking so well in your recent handful of videos. It's lovely to see.
Hey Beckie, I'd just like to recommend a series on the BBC Three YouTube channel, it's called Overshadowed. If you haven't watched it already, then give it a go! I love it and I'd also love to see someone review it! Love the new video and love you, stay strong, beautiful xx
I never watch hauls but I really enjoyed this! I'd love to see a favourites video :)
I love the floral dress and the coral blazer, especially together! ❤️ Really I love all the things you’ve shown today; you have such good luck with thrifting!
I went to Portsmouth too! It's lovely there :)
That floral dress is gorgeous on you. It shows off your figure and I really love it on you. You look beautiful.
I love your patterned trousers where did you get them from?
ahh i love thrifting too! it's like treasure hunting! regular shopping is exhausting and dreary for me but thrifting is always like a little adventure 😊
You dress very well, one thing I hate in modern fashion is Grey baggy tracky   bottoms, they are awful.
You don't need to be completely bound to the steasons.
Wow, that charity superstore must've been a dream... I bet they had to drag you out of there at closing time, haha! :D
Theres nowt wrong with your modelling skills 😉\nThe floral and the blue dress are excellent finds. \nMy weakness in charity shops tends towards pewter tankards (the older the better) and cufflinks (more pairs than you can shake a stick at), with the odd tweed jacket thrown in if its the right size/colour/pattern and make lol
YES. Before I even watch! LOVE!
Loved everything on you.
The dresses at 4:50 and 6:30 really suit you :D
You should do more fashion videos I loved this x
I love thrifting as well we have a big shop where the proceeds go to charity some are last seasons clothes from high street stores and other stuff is secondhand. It's amazing what you can find I buy clothes secondhand on eBay too, as student I'm always trying to save money.
Beckie I love you so much ❤️
I love the watch and mint skirt. After watching this I realized we have similar taste in clothing :)
I loved this! Such a wonderful, positive video 💕
I love thrifting and I would love to see more videos on this topic! Great video! I love all your videos!
I absolutely love listening to you speak. Your voice is so beautiful! You did well on your purchases good job!!
That blue dress is so hot.....(6.25)
Beckie, my feet are a half size difference and I totally know your frustration! But instead of always squeezing your foot into a shoe that's too small (or having one shoe be too big) you can get insoles that bridge the difference! It seriously made a huge difference for me and now I love buying shoes :)
More videos like this please!!!!
The blue dress is my favorite, but I also love the earrings and choker that you have on! Blue is my favorite color and was the color of my bridesmaids dresses at my wedding 13 years ago! My daughter has always had a hard time finding shoes. She also has skinny feet, especially at her heels. Finding her shoes when she was a kid was an absolute nightmnare.
That floral dress fits so well it looks tailored. You look fantastic
Absolutely nothing wrong with your modeling skills, Rebecca. Very nicely presented. The blue at 4.50 looked great! Your 10+ years of making YT videos is indeed showing. You're doing an excellent job filming and editing!
I like the wooden cat, My GFs grandpa used to carve little monkeys out of peach pits for her and now that he is gone they feel so precious. I wonder who carved your cat.
You look absolutely stunning in those blue dresses!
Wow I have that same wooden cat!! I wonder where they originally came from... 😮
Good Morning from America Rebecca <3
I love it!
<3 <3 <3
#45 on trending!!’
Your trending
More Asmr i pray , x
Your voice is so damn calming.
Wow you're super Cute
Beautiful beckie I LOVE YOU beckie🍎
You look very elegant.
You're trending! Well done :)
Everything is so cute 💖💖💖
Awesome Rebecca!! Great finds & you look super cute 💖
Te diré eres hermosa desde una lengua que no entiendes xD
BECKYYYY you don‘t have to use silver cleaner! Just put a piece of aluminum foil and some normal salt inside a bowl with warm water and add the silver jewelery. Let it sit for 10min no longer than 20 - et voila!
I love the trousers you were wearing when you showed the watch, but all of the thrifted stuff looks great too
Ive noticed that ur not running your hands through your hair like u usually do
Terrible modeling skills.  You take that back!\nYou are amazing!\nAll the outfits were spot on!\nI've said it to you before. You should pursue modeling and/or spokesmodel jobs.\nYour voice is incredible. That smile. To die for.\nThat hairstyle. Awesome! No one would know about your condition.\nDoes anyone else out there think the same thing?\n\nGreat video Beckie!\n👍👍
I love the blue skirt ! Also, you look amazing un the blue dress !\nHave a nice day Rebecca !
I used to do pricing in charity shop and it all goes on brands, the better the brand and the hight quality/condition the higher the price
When did you go to the Isle of Wight? I live there, the charity shops are quite expensive which is a shame. :)
Beckie, I feel you my feet are exactly the same too long and thin , I walk weird and i have small ankles so most shoes are too big around the ankle .
the Thrift Shops are so expensive where I live...
I wish I could thrift like you do! But as someone who’s considered ‘plus size’ for most clothes it’s harder to find clothes at all
Hmm that wooden cat is brilliant and has given me an idea to try to make a dog version
I love bracelets but it is hard to find a bracelet that fits without running up and down my wrists cause I have thin wrists like you.
Are charity shops like antique stores? Sorry I'm not too familiar with the British lingo :P hahaha I've just never heard them called that! Great video as always Rebecca! :)
Did you say Clacton and Jaywick?!!!!
Like when you see the vid before he gone viral!

Hahaah waarom ik wil winnen? Ik ben de slechtste voetballer op deze aardbodem, ik vind de sport geweldig en het heeft een grote invloed op mijn leven maar ik kan er niks van. kan miss wel wat extra geluk gebruiken met deze geweldige schoenen.
Fred vara på dig och Guds nåd och välsignelser min vän Sufian Tuzani följer allt nytt om du vill uppnå något som du hörde i videon du vill vara bäst Mitt förslag är att besöka séan granier
Ik zou die schoenen heel graag willen winnen omdat ik voor Messi ben!😱😂
Aqui do Brasil assistindo seu vídeo 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Christiano in slomo... 😂 true respect
wow! That is an excellent video, I imagine these was a great experience but is very very difficult obtain those opportunities, great video bro! I`m sorry for my bad English, I am in progress to learn ;)
So many genuine laughs from this. Good on you, very hard to do these days.
Asexuals laughing
Ya know I think we've all learned something from this \n\n\n\n\n\n*WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE*
Wow this is the best sketch I've seen in a very long time. Hilarious. Thanks Tim.
bloody great!
0:48 That reminds me of one of Tim's really old vlogs in which he says I'm so confident in my sexuality I could fuck a guy and it wouldn't be gay
I love how somehow it's always Jack that ends up being exasperated with his friends' ridiculousness, whether it be Dean or Tim and Dom lol
Watching this video? We've all been there
This is what I come to YouTube for, snappy, witty sketch comedy. Bravo!
holy fuck i have the biggest crush on tim
billy jean, not my lover\nfucking brilliant
My oh my I love this one! Well done.
Itd be cool if tim liked this comment
I AM DYING THIS IS AMAZING
the acting and comedic timing was spot on in this!
A helicopter, tranq dart, and a seventeen-hectare corn maze filled with scorpions. Yeah, we've all been there.
Quality work as always
Been so long, Tim!! :) good causal acting
There we've all been
Hello Tom. *cocks head* \nI fully expected you all to accuse Jack of having sent his ex a Howler when he mentioned a letter.
Little bit too long and repetitive for a weak punchline
Clever as always. I laughed so hard.
HOW DO YOU EVEN COME UP WITH THIS I HAVENT STOPPED LAUGHING FOR HOURS
i mean i've surely been there. everytime i break up with one of my boyfriends i make sure to hex him and then section him off from his family and slowly start causing disasters between him and everyone he loves.\n\n\nwe've all been there.
Oh god that Billie Jean joke x'D
Finally! A video. Still great. We've all been there.
pls dont steal my little brother, man. no matter how relateable the urge is....
this is bloody brilliant oh my gosh
Dom Fera omg I totally forgot about him. What a contributor to classic YouTube. Glad you're still alive, man. 😅
Aaahh I miss this content! had a smile on my face through out the entire video! :D
I snort-laughed on the bus...
I was thinking about you the other day this can't be a coincidence right
Corn maze? Was that a throw-back? :o
I agree, I mean, I cursed my ex, and now his house has burnt down and his otter is dead - Kathleen Raine 1968 (commenting on her ex Gavin Maxwell who turned out to be gay...)
What’s better than this? Guys bein doods
*W E ‘ V E    A L L     B E E N    T H E R E .*
wanted to know what was going on in my ex's life so i figured it was just easier to kill him and become him
this is very good
i liked the spitted WHATHG at the end good touch
Take a shot every time they say we've all been there.
*gets notification* do my eyes deceive me it can't be I'm not ready
So happy that he posted another great sketch
Jack neglected to mention the anthrax he dusted that letter with.
Literary uploaded at the exact time when my gf of 6years left me
This is me compared to all of my friends\n\nI'm Jack
I hate beer but it's very satisfying to see them drinking a good ol' Belgian Hoegaarden. \nThis was fucking hilarious tho.
did you get a bunch of bats?
ASADAFADF THANK YOU FOR THIS
I mean to be fair I did get all of his siblings to like me more than they like him, BUT WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE
HAHA THIS IS GREAT! I love it!
Tim's back for real? Yess
Amber?\nSurgically removed her hands and now they're mine\nMe: well fuck...
I think I'm now too used to the old school UK youtube comedy sketch formula. I found myself counting down to each punchline. Appreciate the water drop though, good call back to the old days :)
Trying to come up with a witty funny comment to show you guys how much I love this, but I can't think of anything... but I guess we've all been there.
Tim I love the new work!!! Great to see you back again
omg fantastic\n10/10 \nim laughing so much right now \nthe delivery of each one just gets me\nbrilliant
Really a letter to tell her how you feel?\nWhy didn't you send her a letter bomb or I don't know send her a paket of high quality kokain and give the police a tip.\nYou know something a sane person would do you sicko.
Hi, I'm new here! YouTube suggestions is killing it! This is funny!!!! 👏👏👏
this was so well written lmao
Billie Jean?\n\nNot my lover.\n\nDEAD
I surgically removed my ex's eyes so I could see what she was up to. We've all been there
Oh man, this is brilliant 😂 Hilariously funny. Where do you even get these ideas from!?
YAY! Every time you upload you consistently raise the bar and never disappoint and your honestly one of the best creators I've ever had the pleasure to come across
Rip to all of Tim's future ex-girlfriends
He’s mine now \nHeS MY SoN
i fucking hate myself too
This is classic
CORN MAZE
0:16 roll credits

Occult following continue

Haven't seen a video from you in a while, but man, this was worth the wait
Billie Jean, not my lover.
My jaw hurts from laughing now.
This was absolutely brilliant
This was amazing!

Hahahahaha great video!
YESS, THANK YOU!
Jack Howard and TimH and Dom reunited!

Tim you're alive!
1:35 ....... @House
That beer is awful clear
Damn I love your videos
Is LaVar Ball the worst sports parent ever?
Jealousy is apparent here and I would like to see these pundits children so we can compare and contrast.  Lavar is black and that's the problem period, non of the other stuff...ESPN reaching...Even Liberal whites secretly hate black people and wish for their demise...In a world gone mad are we really judging Lavar for being an outspoken parent and involved....Even liberal whites still want black men to check in with white authority before making a decision. Black men are not allowed to think independently, that's the real problem
This chick molly can never get a word in 😂😂
Fuck lavar ball. He ruins the image of basketball. His annoying ass just wants publicity. He's an egomaniac.
fuck nancy a woman cant say shit about a father
Worst sports parents that keep saying his son will never be good or things like that.
Let’s see hmmmm ....\n\n#1 Married to the same woman\n#2 All kids by the same woman\n#3 One son in the NBA and is a multi millionaire \n#4 One son attending UCLA\n#5 One son rank #7 best high school basketball player in America \n#6. None of his sons have a mug shot.\n#7. Started his own shoe and merchandise company \n#8 MAJOR AMERICAN ARTICLE NAMES THIS MAN THE WORST SPORTS PARENT IN HISTORY\n\nThey said the same thing about Venus and Serena Williams' dad and Tiger Woods' dad.... Do you see a pattern❓🤔 \n\n***
She's spot on.
NANCY NEEDS TO STAY IN HER LANE
Is it just me.. when this will cain guy starts to speak. I immediately turn this crap off..
Why does will Cain have a job
I don’t even think he’s obnoxious. I just think he’s a professional troll and knows how to take advantage of the media with his antics.
She better stay in her lane.
Wow just don't talk about LiAngelo
This is such BS. The kid is being home schooled for his last two years of high school. SO FUCKING WHAT? there are so many kids home schooled especially famous kids who go to school and it becomes a distraction because they are so famous. Y’all act like he’s not fuckin rich and they can get the best tutors and so on. People so busy worried about the wrong thing when they kids ain’t shit.. BBB
Well, it's funny limited resources but make it is classic white folk tales as they are extremely strict in the South especially if your a QB but whatever. Lavar is a marketing genius period!
I don’t hear these people complaining about the 1000’s of kids pulled from school to work in Hollywood etc. the problem is LaVar is a minority who happens to be outspoken, conservative, opinionated etc. hypocrites
Fuck them I wish lavar ball was my pops
LeMelo doesn't have a high basketball IQ compared to his brother. I don't think he will make it in NBA in the future. He just chucks bad threes and is awful on defense... It's probably best for him to be home schooled though considering how famous he is now.
lavar can do what he wants, its HIS kids ffs. wat business is it of the liberal sports media?
3:16 When you tell your girl you're not cheating yet she got screenshots of your Dms....
Lavar Ball is the greatest sports parent
Him being there for his children automatically disqualifies what the fuck she's saying. There's plenty of deadbeat niggas who don't even know their child's name.
Molly u dumb bitch stfu with nobody gives a shit bout ur stupid point
Lamello is a celebrity now. He can't be at a regular high school. It's that simple. Too many distractions
Why are they talking about someone who isn’t even in the nba yet 😂 calm down and talk about actual professional sports players in the nba or nfl
Molly please stay in yo lane... And I aint apologizing like Cam Newton!
Whats wrong with creating your own brand? Should he have some other company exploit his son...i say marketing at it's finest
Max's hair got it's color back.
Russell Westbrook - I'll Be Champion Soon\nhttps://youtu.be/7HjB3xPjN60
Why would First Take give this article so much TV exposure? Lavar is a genius and he know the new coach is on some BS. When you tell my son you want be shooting 50 times, instead of saying we going to have more ball movement and assist a game.
Ban will cain from first take
BULLSHIT....Lavar is a great Father look at the results
Imagine LaMelo attending Chino Hills H.S... rolling up in his red Ferrari... music blaring... television camera distracting the other students from properly graphing a parabola in Algebra 2 class? Not to mention the envy and jealousy of the other boys as he (Melo) attends prom with 300 gold digging vixens... This could all lead to some serious issue ESPN and Sports Illustrated dim wits. Now, go THINK ABOUT IT!
Molly needs to shut the fuck up and stop trying to insert herself into the conversation. Nobody cares what she has to say
School really isn’t that important
Hmm lets go to ESPN for parenting advice... said no one ever.
the worse or perfect? I swear we can never win... If were unsuccessful its because we have no dad , we have a dad & now hes the worst...smh
Get off Lavar dick and let yo bitch get on it
“A lot of people would kill to have a father” -whatever the female hosts name is
i want to hear Kristine Leahy's comments on this. I havent heard anythign from her since she got put in her lane
Why Molly always feel like she has to yell her way in? 😂😂
Stephen A. Knows it all
I'm on that big baller shit forreal
LeBron James had no dad I would put his dad on that list Ball is fucking the game up and yt ppl are pissed
I'm pretty sure Julian Newman's father is a lot worse...
Worst sports parent ever? Sounds like a bunch of ignorant jealous people voted this.
Who the fuck is the washed up bitch who made that statement anyway. No one cares about her.
This probably coming from people who have no fathers
Lavar is doing fine with his whole family!!! I can give you a much better example of parents who screwed up their kid. Tiger woods parents! No normal kid grows up on a golf green. And at the end Tiger messed up his marriage and career.
If you guys watch their reality show called Ball in the Family, you'll see that lavar is the best father and husband you could possibly have
that is so STUPID to pull him out of high school, you should be learning at home to anyway
Lol half of all these black athletes had father's who ran away... I might not like his antics but to have those 3 kids who are as good as they are takes real parenting.
They want to build him up to break him down
Molly really needs to keep her mouth shut...always interrupting...she needs to follow Joy Taylor's example and only comment at the end of the segment....no one cares about her opinion...she is simply eye candy
The only thing i can say about lavar is that good or bad  i would be ashamed if he was my father
Why do people care how LaVar raises his kids SMDH worry about your own life
MOLLY SHUT UP!!! Please bring back Cari Champion 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
The real problem is hes breaking all the traditions and restraints.... No shoe deal create your own.. Stream lining from a unknown highschool to a major college ..and now homeschooling and personal training instead of highschool ball
max you did say the end justify the means you said lets see how it shapes up
1) Not gonna lie the optics of crying about 2 coaches in a row, to the point of pulling the kid not only from the team but from SCHOOL...\nDoes seem a bit much\n\nDoesn't = worst ever but being 'real' it is a bit over the top, to yank the kid outta SCHOOL a month in...\nThe basketball team...ain't biology and math class\nI got ZERO problem if dude say my boy is done with THIS coach and thus squad BUT in all fairness and no offense to LaVar but how you all of a sudden 'qualified' to home school the boy, dawg 😂\n\nI mean, what's wrong letting the boy GO TO CLASS...Pops?\nPick him up at 3 o'clock and train... \nIf class time and homework wasn't getting in his way or Lonzo's way...why pull him from 2 years of school...\n\nI'd have LESS issue had they came back from the summer and said dude is just going train and forget about school altogether but to be REACTIVE about totally pulling him out of school over just the basketball coach is bush league overall as a REACTION, sorry that's child-like.\n\nHim and his wife NEVER home-schooled the first 2...why 'experiment' on the LAST kid's LAST 2 years of h/s over the b-ball coach....that's my issue\n\nDude could absolutely go the school and not PLAY for Chino High...whatever class time and homework time wasn't an issue before and hadn't been one for the first two so let's not go there and nobody's saying SCHOOL was in the way so x-ing out ALL school/educational development = unnecessary\n\nWhy all of a sudden, he needs what now all day training...No that over-reacting \nThe kid 'could' have been a 'student' at Chino AND trained privately for b-ball = not a problem\nBut pulling from chemistry, social studies and English class over THIS ish one month into Jr. year is (no offense) is chick-like, little crying girl-like to be 'real' with you.\nCertain decisions you map out properly, especially when it's your kid's actual childhood, they only get ONE...as an adult you can muck around for 2-3 years and say, man I messed that up, shoulda done this way I'ma change it up NEXT year but kids only get 1 Junior year, one shot at being 16 in high school dawg...why be flippant and take it away from the kid over a hissy with a coach, \nWhy ROB him of ALL his teachers and the possible good influences THEY may have been on him?\n\nReal talk, I had some cool teachers in h/s that I quote to THIS day, that were way, away from the court, the field or any squad I played on...my parents were great, coaches were cool but the texture one can get from 'learning' and being around other adults during one's formatives years can be invaluable\nI'm thinking of a couple cool as teachers right now from 30 years ago that I'm glad I got to know cause they helped round out my experience, being at HOME with Moms N Pops especially STARTING all of a sudden at the END of schooling seems like giving up, throwing in the towel\n\nLaMelo's two older brothers got 'better' than that\n\nIf THIS is the 'best' way...Why NOW... how come the first two didn't go this no school route\n\nNah dude, you mad ( which is cool) but you don't arbitrarily pull the boy out of structured schooling over THIS issue, \nTransfer him = ok\nBut to say my man is OUT of school, when you and Moms had obviously planned to leave the educating to the school system ( like you had been doing and did in allowing the educational system to make the other 2 academically qualified for UCLA) why 'play' with my man's educational preparedness, off the whim?\nThat's silly\n\nIf it was he's not playing this year and just training and then skipped Senior that be another thing because one could see and understand the planning...this ish right here is just getting mad and kicking rocks in a hissy fit...that isn't foresight, that running away like a girl, hastily\nYou don't 'play' with kid's childhood off momentary 'feelings'... handle the ball playing how you want but in fairness, dude should have left the schooling in place...he never said the school wasn't doing it's job educationally, again the first two had no issues qualifying for UCLA why rock the academic ⛵, the kid's social ⛵ over obviously the non important basketball squad?
So whatever happened to education first?
Typical & not surprising at all. The corporate mafia doesn't control him nor his son's career, so what do they do? Get a lame writer to put a hit piece out on him.
5:48 shut up Molly. Men are talking. 😂😂
Who's the fuck is she lol
Lavar Ball is the epitome of how a father should be. How many black fathers you see pushing their kids like he is? He's out their supporting them, going to their games, trying to tell the world that they have potential. What more can a parent do? Sure he says obnoxious things at times when he says stuff like beating Jordan one on one. But all in all I see a man who believes in his kids potential and is doing everything he can to get them where he wants as a parent. Dude is a genius and knows what he's doing and people are going for it. If more fathers did this, it would be amazing. It said you don't see it. But when you do, people are quick to say the wrong things about a man who's just trying to be different.
molly shut the fuck up
Nice to see this comment section is full of race baiting.
I like Will Cain he's like a Fun Dork with savy wordplay almost Skip Bayless to a degree He's enjoyable no homo ya dig
You guys are stupid.... This MAN rise his kids the right way, NO DRINKING OR SMOKING. 2 kids that went to college and this Melo NOT Stopping SCHOOL. But still able to homeschool, and still have a bright future.
Will Cain always come across as a total shithead!...
The caption is really sickening. Here is a parent (African American dad) that goes all out for his kids. Tells them they are the best, builds their confidence, secures them endorsement deals, shoes etc....all these so that they don't lack in any way. Very rarely (and I stand by my words) do you see a parent especially a Dad, do these sort of thing. And after all these is labelled as a Bad parent...GTFOH. Now this is why i dont watch , listen or read Mainstream media. If i hadn't known anything about Ball, i would have believed this bullshit. SMDH. I will give anything to have a DAD like Ball. Thankfully, i tell my kids everyday to believe in themselves, i tell them they are the best, they are beautiful and that no one can bring their confidence down.
he's raising all stars and doing an amazing job at it and its black thats the problem
thing is lavar is forcing HIS values down his kids throat...he's living his dreams through his kids, cause he failed, its god to have after the believes in you but not the way he does with reality shows, him always trying to be in the spotlight etc, outrageous things he does and say is horrible example for his kids when they get to the real world! i can go on and on..he takes care of his kids, but does alot of messed up stuff as well, so he def isnt the best parent or the worse
just the most obnoxious parent ever.
Never I've seen much worst
How is the media getting in on someones parenting? Smh...
All made very good points for this segment to me
who the fuck is Nancy Armour. that bitch needs to eat a dick, why do people have a problem with homeschooling, she's acting like Lavar is sending him to a Nazi concentration camp or some shit, have several seats you fucking cunt
I think he's a good parent helping out his kids to be successful. No one should judge that.
Another White racist cracker ass Bitch who needs to stay in her lane.
Oh...we must be back to Lavar Ball as 'nigger of the week'....OJ got out, so he's next week....
Will Cain Is On Cocaine. Don't take anything he says seriously or you're a Headass🤦🏾‍♂️💯
some would even argue the education system isnt optimal so home schooling might even be better, albeit unconventional
Lavar wants their family to be like that of the Kardashians. YOu know, rich with no brains.....
I wish my perents knew what im got at in youn age and did all thay can to push me 2 the top
whites have to remember in america when you criticize a black you will be portrayed as racists. but when blacks criticize whites its justified
White people always want to tell black people how to raise their kids. Now if all his kids had criminal records, and no father around they would love to use these kids in prison.
The FBI's investigation into a college basketball corruption scheme alleges that a top-rated prospect, Brian Bowen, took a $100,000 bribe to join the University of Louisville .\nDaddy Bowen ,  Louisville , High school athlete .  hhhm Maybe homing schooling isn't to bad of an Idea. And playing international for a year. College is as bad as the so called bad sports parents.
A father that raises his children is not to be commended, its to be EXPECTED. Have some god damn self respect and stop idolizing a loudmouth idiot that will say anything to make a dollar, whether it makes life harder on his children or not. Hes a disgrace and while its sad Blacks illegitimacy is at 70% that doesnt grant an attentive father a free pass to say what he pleases with no consequence.
LaVar is a genius!!! Greatness attracts Haters.
She's jealous
Haters gona hate.

RESPECT THE DAMN GOAT
What about liangilo
LAVAR IS A FUCKING GOAT
This is why I love Celine, she's pure & good & has such a big heart that is brave, solid & consistent, giving and so much more!!\n\nIt's not about her talent, it's about how she touches humanity, and is able to really connect with us that sets her apart from the rest.\n\nIn the UK 🇬🇧 we have a monarchy, and they live a public life, but even my own queen has no comparison to Celine. There has been only one other woman in my lifetime , who I can say lived for people and touched them in her way; and that was of course the beautiful Diana Princess of Wales. \n\nCeline is not all about fashion, money, and blasting out note perfect rifts during concerts.  She gives back something far more significant that cannot be measured in $ £ € signs. \n\nShe gives something she will never get back that is far more Valuable and that is of course her time. Time is the most Valuable thing we can give anyone, it doesn't stop, we can't go back in time, and none of us know exactly how much of it we have.\n\nCeline does this because she WANTS to do it, not because she HAS too!! \n\nShe gives love, support and comfort; and shows solidarity, at a time when people are scared,  lost and hurting. \n\nIf we all took a leaf out of her book, and were able to love one stranger each, no one would be alone in this world.\n\n And if we give a little of our love away, it will sure make a difference every night and day, and if we hear the whisper of what the hearts trying to say, \n\nWe can sure make a difference, in some small, in some small way \n\nBravo once again Celine & thank you for everything you have done and continue to do for humanity, through your music and your ability to bring people together from all corners of the world.\n\nYou have always remained true to the people, your family and most importantly true to yourself and dear René. This is why we love you and this is why we have kept loving you for all of these years 💜\n\nI just wish there were more women like you and Princess Dianna in the here and now and in the further, when our time on this world has long been spent. \n\nI feel we all need too understand that the only thing that we can do to improve the future, is to take action NOW, we need to look after one another, love one another, and protect our children and teach them correctly and go back to older values of respect trust and strength. It all comes back to time though doesn't it?\n\nYou have one life, one chance to make a difference. And you have a choice! \n\nWhen your clock runs out how will you be remembered? \n\nAs someone who made a difference to humanity and looked after their community, family, friends and complete and utter strangers and give them the most expensive thing you own TIME!'
My name is Alex, I'm a producer for KTNV Channel 13 news in Las Vegas. May we have permission to use this video on our newscast?

That confused man who did this horrible thing i believe as the bullet entered his head realized he fucked up.  To late
What a beautiful angel Celine is. God Bless you
Excellent choice of words, spoken from the heart. There's nothing phony about this, I'm so sick of the hateful comments about this woman. Why would you seek out and spend time watching someone you hate? I've never been that bored. It's sad.
Incredible. She is beyond awesome.
Amazing Celine your a angel truly. ❤️
USA got what it payed for. ISIS I mean. You gave them money you got shot
# All states strong
I can't stop crying ...
Thank you for your generosity.  God bless you, Celine.
I admire and respect everything about this woman and I always have.
QUEEN OWN A PURE GOLD HEART💖💖💖  We Love You Queen Celine Dion
Amen! This woman is an example. RIP beautiful souls🙏
Truly an angel ❤️
Belo gesto. Parabéns!!!

This song is excellent and it is friday night....haha.
That is no fair being that beautiful and talented too. I love everything Annie does, she is a rare talent. She could skate by on her beauty, but she is a hard working woman. She has totally earned everything she's got.
She’s gunna wreck us so hard with this album omg
I miss the era of St vincent’s “Marry Me”. I ve alwwys wanted the dark humor yet poignant side of her. Witty and just haunting . Same with “Landmines”. Plsss stvincent!
Such a sexy song and video. Amazing stuff!
I like the fact I'm sponsoring Annie by drinking redbull, thats a good deal !!
The A E S T H E T I C on the video makes it even better. So ready for Masseduction
in partnership with my blue balls
3:14 makes me to imagen the perfect sweet & nasty fantasy.  Yeahhhh!!!
I can’t wait annie to win like 20 Grammys for this album
What Goldfrapp should be sounding like today.
Sarkistic talent with taste. Such a mess)) but I feel in love ... I'm going to masturbate ...
my WIGGGGG
god
Sweetest kiss in warsaw 2014 <3
Totally got the vision
1:29 is that who I think it is?! OAO
this sounds so much like The Kills, so good
lol i love redbull
If I were more of a lesbian Annie would totally dig me.  I saw her last year, killer
if trent reznor had been born xx instead of xy.
Did any notice the Brazil (movie) reference in the video or is it just me?
her normal person costume is great
St. Vincent's songs Also music videos are pure art !!!! 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
A E S T H E T I C
at the very end, meeting David Byrne did not help out
Man, she's really serving on the aesthetics this era
kind of a chanel advert from terry gilliams brazil
She can punch me in the face and I'd thank her.
I love how when she winks it's just a blink. <3
Well that was artsy. I want cake now.
This song explains my life in vivid detail.
Hot damn what a track
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER (WDSLM) youtu.be/MYm9bJUHN08  #stvincentfan
somebody knows which are that glasses??? pleaseee
Definitely her biggest chorus, this one might be the one to cross over to pop radio
Our queen, Annie, is just one of those people that just looks better with age. Annie is only 35 now but she looks amazing!!!
It would be an honour for St Vincent to step over my face in those heels
How do you describe this unique guitar sound??
I kinda miss when Annie used to shred on her guitar. I don't really hear any of her in the music anymore beside her humor
all I need in life are more white musicians that aren't afraid to use bass😍😍😍😍
why is it only new music that trends on YT, get some old music trending!
best finest surgeon\ncome cut me open\n\n\nam i the only one who thought of that song watching the video
This particular video clip contains huge procedures.Search for: rubixcube magxxx in google.

No #Orange. Better that that ass pic!
Excellent!  ...But I did want see you play the guitar solo from the studio track!
Let me write 'Los Angeles'... oh shit, forgot the 'N'... oh well, let me just write a 'S' at the end... 'Los Ageless'... phew, that was a close one, amirite?
i demand a collab with helen marnie of ladytron please
St. Vincent did that. \nLos Angeles = cancelled \nEveryone ageless and shook
Beautiful. This is one of the best music videos of yours!
enjoying very much how the colors remind of the digital witness vid. even though this is awesome in so many different ways.
I love her guitar. One of the coolest new  guitar shapes in a long time.
She’s having so much fun
good
I repeat: http://christtoandandrew.tumblr.com/
Amazing
i love you
She has a strange sex appeal. Don't get me wrong; she's attractive of course.  Very feminine but when she rocks the guitar, she combines a unique blend of femininity and masculinity (if that makes sense). Love her music, especially her last album.
3:04 Live giraffe birth
her videos get weirder

Slick. Sexy. Cool.

Me explicas la faNTASIA DE VÍDEO
Ola st. vincent estoi mui triste porque no me dejan ver tus vídeos porque no e echo la tarea
She'll end up eating her own words with this one. 35 years old is a wonderful age....anyone care to bet at what age she'll succumb to Botox ?...facelift ?.....nip and tuck ?.... increase in popularity = increase in vanity.
This is very unhappy music
She seems more focused on cultivating the St Vincent persona than writing great music\n\nGreat chorus though
Face stretch scene is from Brazil. It's good but I like St. V older stuff.
the irony here is she is becoming everything she hates
The production is awful. The song writing is here or there, but getting Taylor Swift's producer wasn't worth it. :(
A little too close to Nine Inch Nails.
0:49 BRAZIL !
2017 is the year of pastel
A 165K view music vid and it's on trending? Yeah, this is definitely not promotion... definitely not...
she sold out

i hope Jim Carrey lives many more years, hes an awesome person!
how can jim carrey think anyone else is bad when he knowingly gave a woman herpes and then abandoned her while she killed herself
If you could get Mr.Nobody to post his Bulletproof coffee recipe kind sir, that would be great.
Chris Kattan and Richard Lewis at the same time.
There must be a thousand ideas going through Carrey's mind every minute. Very talented.
Add Eric Andre to the list.
Norm didn’t know how to handle a Jim Carrey interview...he kept interrupting any of Jims stories.  It was a very ADD interview all around...he was taking Jims “I’m not really me schtick” a little too literal... which in turn made Jim push it even more making it kind of uncomfortable.  I have to say though it was still great Jim and Norm both had me laughing so hard multiple different times!!!
I've always taken them for granite. I'll be upset for a long time that that joke delivery got interrupted by the producers
This show was not funny or interesting but you have to remember Jim Carrey was not there.
...and keep it up Norm, it's a great format.
jim carrey looks like if kevin bacon was in the walking dead
You know, I like Jim Carrey and think he's funny as hell and really do think that he's trying to remove his ego as a spiritual thing, but damn... he cannot allow anyone else to get a word in edgewise. It is pretty annoying when you have Norm, who is the type of comedian whose genius comes from a slow, subtle, methodical, build up sort of timing. Jim is blowing all of Norm's genius. Damn it anyway!  A word to Jim: do your shtick and give the people what they want, but please.....figure out when to shut the fuck up! There is nothing more entertaining than two greats who can play off of each other. Learn how to do this.
Holy moly, I always wondered what Jim Carrey was really like. He's insane! I really like how he called out Norm Macdonald being fake and told someone their little dog was a football. What else can he do? Eat our children?
Jim Carrey does come off as a bit of a douche. He should listen, too!
This was brilliant. All of you who don't get what Jim is doing need to just watch some of his more serious speeches lately. We all could learn something from his state of being. We could all benefit from being little less repressive about expressing ourselves. He has had a spiritual awakening of a profound sense, he's next level. If you can't recognize it you either don't know his spiritual story or haven't had an awakening of your own to this depth.
So many are eagerly waiting to point fingers, but shiver at the thought of their own reflection. Always start with empathy, your life and everyone else's will be so much richer.
I think I about passed out when Norm loses control of the show at 51:30...
dude isn't so much funny as annoying, and really aggressive with his quasi-spiritual bullshit.
That Deep Rest thing really spoke to me in the very end there. Holy shit.\nJim Carrey, woke AF.
Don't believe jim we do matter everything does
It kind of makes sense that Carrey is like this now. His messed up childhood and working so hard to ahead in life then realizing how hollow and meaningless it all is.
Cacao is chocolate in its most natural raw form. It will open your mind ;)
A quick summary of this interview:\nJim Carrey, once a talented and entertaining performer, now spends his days smelling his own farts.
Part of me wants to think Jim has become some enlightened being, but when he says these things with far away eyes and looks to be about 15 pounds underweight, it's hard to not be worried. I also can't tell if he's bullshitting, because he's a bullshitter. There is no him, but he's hamming it up like classic Carrey, so obviously there's the footprint of something. It's like, why bother with work? Why bother with interviews? Why bother trying to make people laugh?
Does he talk about his recent interviews?
It's weird, I had this real dark moment watching this... and I just defined life and all existence as just these three people talking in a room telling stories. Like imagine if that was all life was. But everyone just watching this and doing nothing else, that is what life is for the moment. I'm not describing this well at all
ok, jim is annoying now....thought i would never say that
I wanted to hear Jim's take on the Gnostics too. The spigot thing made it all the more interesting though. We have a man Jim, ready to lift up the world and take the throat chakra out of its slumber with fearless devotion to the supreme. The throat chakra has trouble in this world, hence the lack. It will not flood, but snow.
This is incoherent.  Who can listen to jim carrey for more than 5 minutes?
This one is almost as chaotic as the Mike Tyson episode.
Tommy Lee Jones is scum and a shitty actor. He needs to retire
Have you thought about my cock today?
I was cleaning my room, picking up trash that had been on my floor for months, and I found a fortune from a fortune cookie. And I read it and it said, oops, wrong cookie. Let that sink in.... Dafuk u saying Jim Carrey?
I have to say, this new Om MacDoald show just keeps getting better and better with every episode.
Where do I get one of those mugs for my CACAO?
this was like watching someone vomit in intervals .
I got the 'taunt' joke right away with Jim, and I'm familiar with the truly disgusting Albert Fish and If i was in that audience I would have been running away laughing, and probably go on a jog. I like Jims dismissive property to that joke, especially was he the first taunter?, Is brilliant. Its utterly brilliant and Im not just a jim fan boy at all, Im just a normal dude who knows of Jim Carrey. \nI can actually thank god for the comedy brilliance in this world, and I think having a REAL funny bone is a true blessing. And ive been blessed in that way.
these men are speaking of danny feeling so guilty about his Hollywood pedophile antics that he founded st. jude childrens hospital.. carrey is a Satanist high priest research it. also they bring up jimmy Saville. the worst pedophiile in the history. I seriously  hope u people are waking up. they might be drinking deluted kids blood. wake up research it,, good covering up jim carrey . he trys to change subject so muchy. u sick fucks
5:30 God bless her I would've went nuts.
Is his sidekick American, he sure laughs at everything like an American
What is this there's no me shtick he keeps repeating? It doesn't get more self-absorbed than that, ironically. He doesn't need anything? Except constant attention and $10,000 per person to see his art work which apparently is painted by no one. OK? What's the point of this? How about just say I've lightened up and am just enjoying myself because I can afford to?
Wow, if I was on the crew I would not have drank from that mug.
deve ser divertido ter carta branca (dinheiro) pra ser niilista em um nível tão profundo.
Well that was very uncomfortable to watch
I don't have an ego at all. When people say this they do not know themselves.
Someone needs to level that desk.
So thoughtful of Jim to donate his beard to Rosie O'Donnell.
Great show, but if I could change one thing I would get rid of Adam in a heartbeat.
Do you find that since you're afforded this luxury of not having to work, it gives you more free time to think up these fucking batshit crazy ideas you have?\n\nDamn I love ya Norm. After an hour and 11 minutes of hearing someone ramble how they aren't real he finally let's let drop.
STOP INTERRUPTING ME! hahah...what a weird fella. That Carrey fella aint Norm-al either.
i saw jim for the first time in the 70s early if i remember right...early 70s....he was a kid 15 i think...this was on the allen thicke show from and in canada at the time..he was at his most funny....the transformation is remarkable..hes done now...hes into bad things..i can tell..oh well ...he did live the dream tho....you wont find his appearance on that show on the internet..btw...
Jesus christ what a two buzzkills are this guys...
So you have the clown makeup, and -- whaddya do -- do you bring a crawl space with ya?  44:10\n\nNorm is the best.
Before this even starts and ends, Jim Carrey has be my idol since I was a very young girl. \nPeople change, people do this and say things and have this done to them.\nWe only know what the media tells Us.\nTeam Jim until I die.
I repeated the words Om..Macdo...Ald over and over for 24 hours and blew the most incredible Tantric load. Well, not me, but somebody in the general vicinity of things that happen in an area of my perception. Anyway, thanks for the trip, Norm. You're Quebec's  Dalai Lama.
He is playing a character. Obviously he is pretty good at it.
this episode is total OM MACDO
After further analysis I realized it's two guys notorious for fucking with people in their own way, canceling each other out, although Jim's neurotic to the point of irritating energy clearly wins by sheer fact that Norm is incredibly lazy with his angle
In a simple word: Jim got old & loses his fucking mind
I guess pedophilia is a hobby now.
Been a Carrey fan since I first saw him.  He's almost unwatchable here and lately.  His hyper activity was funny but now it seems neurotic.
Jim seems to be the opposite of what Eckhart Tolle speaks of. He is a shallow, self diluted, self loathing, angry, egotist.
He's quite rude and easily offended for someone spiritually enlightened
Had no idea Norm has a show. This is grrrreat news.
Carey is the bizarro version of Rust Cole.
Adam Egret is the best. Brings everything to a screeching halt every time he opens his mouth.
Funny synchronicity, I was listening to to the old episodes and had just finished the russel brand interview and my immediate thought was he should get jim carrey on here , I like when the guests can really get norm off his center of balance
I swear that Adam Eget guy looks so familiar, like I've met him before.  I doubt it, though.  He's the manager at the world famous Comedy Store and I'm just some punk who lives under the Queensborough Bridge.
wow, what a show/experience/class... i dont know what to do next, how the hell do you top that?!? Jimmy my boy!.. please write a book on philosophy and put me down for 5 copies
Fuck all you people in the comment section.its just jim being jim.and jim is great.
Funny to read all these internet judges. You have no idea what really happened!
Here in San Antonio when Tommy lee jones is sighted around town EVERYONE knows to stay away from him.
I saw Mitch Hedberg destroy the lettered sign at Caroline's in the week before his death.
Jim starts to look like Kevin Bacon
Richard Pryor was funny, but to say he hasn't been eclipsed is just a preference statement. Doug Stanhope stands equal with any comedian, past or present. :)
hey Norm, you're in psychoville and Jim Carry's the mayor!
Man he was stepping on so many jokes with his horse shit.
Did he leave the illuminati
Someone dosed his water supply and not everyone understands that
he trashed Norm's set like Keith Moon in a hotel room
This episode deserved multiple views.  So many funny things happening.
36:40 talking pure narcissist here. The way he comports himself is like it's all about me
Ha! Says he doesn't need anything.  He's not here.  And then starves for attention.  *eyeroll*  Love ya Jim.

5:07 wow it didn't take long for this to get dark...
its nice to see jim being the man he wanted to be
Old definitions of crazy/nuts are truly complimentary in this day in age. Why would you want to be another sheep, sharing the same thoughts and feelings as all the other sheep never questioning what else there is to plug into the equation of life, never finding answers. You'll never know anything other than what you've been told, and that's just sad. Putting your blind trust into an all powerful source is a recipe for manipulation and deceit of the masses. Knowledge and truth are capable of providing all the power one could ever wish for
Wow

Jim carrey 😏
Jim Carrey is hilarious!
Jim Carrey. Holy shit man. Yikes. However, that Bruce Dern face cracked me up.
Philosophy 101 cringe
JASON IS A BITCH FOR THE COMPANY!!!!
It was probably too loud.
Im repeating this because I didn't even get one reply.How could this Jason dude ever face anyone after deserting his fans in the way he did. He did not even say ONE WORD let me repeat myself not even ONE WORD to the bewildered crowd.How could he leave his fans for dead?How many paid good money to come and see him and look what they got in return.His fans needed him to say at least something,but got nothing.SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!
Everyone complaining about the performer running off stage, is he not allowed to protect himself? Shots were going off like crazy and he's in the damn spotlight! Was be supposed to stand there in order to warn fans about something he has absolutely no clue about or what was going on and pretty much ask to die in the process???\nWas he supposed to somehow save thousands of people from something he had no fucking control over?
This is the scariest thing I have ever heard, the concert goers are going to have severe trauma even if they were not physically injured.
what song is this?
Hotel high rises should have airport security type baggage scanners to screen whatever bags get taken upstairs and make people secure any firearms in the hotel arms room while they're guests especially in casinos where somebody might get a bit upset losing their money gambling.  That's the only thing I can see that could have possibly stopped this from happening.
#Why For Las Vegas Strong Survivor Songhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6SS6f3upHs&sns=tw via @youtube
How did you get 2000 ppl to like this when there's nothing here?
This is not part of the show.  People, seek shelter.  KILL the lights.   How long does it take to say that?
Very sad and unfortunate but I can't say I'm surprised about a culture, people, and society that worship guns and violence. There are probably hundreds of thousands of normal white guys just like him out there lurking. How many white guys named Joe Schmoo are in America? Yeah. Millions. How many of them have guns? Millions. Apparently he wasn't even one of the assholes. Suck on that for awhile. What did you expect? This is 'Merica. How ironic that it happened in SIN CITY as well. The sad reality is that the chickens came home to roost. This is the new normal. Get used to it or move to the middle of nowhere and live in a cave somewhere.
This makes me want to cry I’m sad and devastated
Jason Aldean is a coward, knew what was going to happen and bolted. \n\nEnjoy the media and government lying to you. It was the fbi+cia+mossad that did this. Prepare to be subjugated by the jew world order.
It was at the Mandalay hotel not Whiskey
The gunshots sound remind me of the Paris nightclub.  You can hear the terror in the victims voices.
NOTICED!! His last words of the song was no show  and he ran off after stage.  #illuminati 🎰🏟🏰🎆🌃📺💵🔨🚷
The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” MLK \nJason “Bolt” Aldena wiithout so much as a word to the ~22,K fans standing there not knowing what is going on and being shot down. He had loudspeakers and the attention of the concertgoers, he could have and should have crew to kill the lights, we need first responders, stay calm and move to the exits, take cover, say something - say anything. He said nothing and ran. \n58 perished, 489 people injured. Prayers to the families who've lost loved ones'.
Cant blame him for not stopping immediately, lot of people thought it was fireworks at first...
That ain't no Goddamn 'bump fire'. That is belt fed Army shit.
Every shot you hear is a life changed forever. Sickening to watch.
This video shows nothing, you can hear.
Im kind of mad at how the country singer on stage runs off to seek shelter like a scared child. Leaving fans thinking WTF. Just my opinion if anybody feels the same speak out.
I can't help but wonder how much of a difference it would have made in the shooters' ability to aim at and hit the crowd if the stage lights were not shining upon the crowd during the second volley of fire. \n\nIn this video (https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c96_1507108754), they finally turned the lights off - several minutes after the shooting stopped. As the guy filming the video states, that just made it more difficult for the EMTs to find and help the wounded.
Our world is so messed up
makes me not want to go to concerts.
what is the name of the song he was performing when the shooting began?
What is so unsettling is this\n     These homeland attacks are going to keep happening. The media, certain politicians, and a select few branches of government are responsible for the poisoning of our minds, and the taking of our financial security are just two of the things that are pivitol in the breakdown of the shooters state of mental health. I am NOT WARRANTING what happened, however unless ALL OF US don't stop being hateful , and getting involved on a municipal level attacks like this are going to keep happening. To me this was just a small version of 9-11. ALL SECURITY MEASURES ON A PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL SHOULD BE TREATED AS IF THE PRESIDENT IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. ANY PLACE WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PRESENT , THERE SHOULD BE A PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL OF SECURITY..... IN 2004 when Dimebag Darrell Abbott was killed on stage in Columbus, Ohio during a concert should have prevented any security fails such as this
What a sick world we live in.😞

Leave it to TIME to leave a subscribe reminder at the end of this horrifying video.. classy folks, real classy
Im glad i live in a gun-controlled country... Its so safe and peaceful here..
This is absolutely disgusting what happened, now if he was a Muslim the first thing would have been ‘terrorist’ but this guy is a ‘lonewolf’ and ‘disturbed’.
What song is that
i have goosebomp all over my body...i cannot understand the acharment of this mass  killing ,not shooting once but repeativiley. twisted  mind  and heartless monsters. . whos behind it? i do not believe  anymore in appearance. and what medias say. who ever is behind that atrocity  will face karma
So they turn on the floodlights so the shooters can see who to shoot! Wake up people ! there are three or more shooters!
Why would anyone like this video
Hey Guys! This Is Great! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 ℕ𝔼𝕋𝔽𝕃𝕀𝕏 $𝟝𝟘𝟘 𝔾𝕚𝕗𝕥 ℂ𝕒𝕣𝕕 Here – >  #Likefreecardsgetitnow
Johhny Cash on stage:  Shoot at me Devil! I'm the man in Black!
Not a terorist eh? I wonder why ?
Call it for what it is Terrorism
How could you even play his music now? You saw how his  beta ass ran off stage. I'll smack the shit outta him if I ever saw  that chicken Shit bastard
He runs off stage like a little bitch! He doesn't even warn the crowd! THEN they turn all the lights on the auduence! What? So the killerS can see their targets? WTF???????
I think Islam is behind this.
The sad thing is I didn't even feel shocked hearing the gunfire.
I hope that guy suffers for all eternity, to take a life is to sin.. to take that many lives.. fucking coward
This is what World War Three looks like.
Hmmm Are we already in Hell?
Time just ended a video of a mass shooting telling me to sub? Holy shit
Sounds like the OTrauma and The Dump Administration are not doing anything on those Gun Laws!
the panic in their voices...
Hey everyone don't get mind tricked by the elite group they want us to lose
obviously the two shooters in mandalay bay hotel were distractions. there's no way they could inflict that much damage; wound 500, & kill 57 from 400 yards in the dark at an almost impossible angle shooting down with sniper precision wake up people!!!!!!!!!!!! To me, and this my opinion that second  flurrie was return fire. but here's  the real this probably the most surveyed city in the world meaning cameras are running and recording 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 a year 10 years a decade. To me the real question is where's  the footage and what about the other shooters at the other hotels?\n\n\nAnyone who was really there or has footage that hasent been edited get at me  \nthere may be some money for u.\n\n\n\nfatboi3025@gmail.com
So sad 😭what kinda a world we are living right now huh ??? Can't even felt safe anymore these days don't know what the heck will be happens next 😢
But not all the light..... red light ok
Why tf would you get down? Like do u want to die?
You would think that someone would get on the mic and say people need to exit or something. Because it took a while before people realized what was going on.
WHY DIDNT THE SINGER SAY RUN OR GET DOWN. HE JUST RAN OFF ONLY CARING ABOUT HIMSELF
No idea whatsoever who this Aldean fellow is, or why anyone would want to watch him on stage, but to each his own, I guess. Also, seeing as this is a false flag op, isn't he in on it as well? Pretty cowardly how no one in charge gave any direction whatsoever.
Wish trump was in this crowd and hit
I hear tickets are on sale now for the next country music festival feauturing jason aldean wearing a jogger suit and running shoes (poor Jason almost tripped last time running in boots)
Problem is noone knows what actual gunfire sounds like.  People, it sounds like fireworks from afar, you get that cracking sound the closer the bullet is to you.  These days, DUCK AND FUCKING COVER, then locate the source and evac.  Arg, im so mad..   fucking asshole.
My question is why they turn the lights on so the shooter can have a clean look?
He really give him self for free will to Evil Hell sick man 😠😠
This guy Aldean is a coward in my eyes. He gave no warning, no hint or clue as to what was happening or why he ran; he just left... kinda like to say, screw this and screw you guys... I'm out...! Boycott his country ass...!
Oh my God!!!!! What can I say, I am just so heart broken and in deep pain and thoughts how people can be so evil to perpetrate such heinous act. I can't even watch the video and my heart is so bitter and heavy for  innocent children who now have to live the rest of their lives without parent. OMG!!!!!! My heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved. May the almighty comfort them and keep them safe.
My sympathy to all victims and their families  from iran
Holy f.ck I didn't know it was a full auto assault rifle
This is not what Jason wants to be remembered for omg
Nanny nanny boo boo!!!
*EVERYONE* who always shooting up places full of innocent people & have commited the biggest massacre in American History? \nA) Muslims\nB) Mexicans\nC) Blacks \nD) Whites\n*No.2 Pencil Only*
if live bullets after 1 min stampede. Crisis actors again.
HEY TIME !! YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT -- RIGHT ?? THE VIDEO OF THE 2ND SHOOTER ON THE 4TH FLOOR -- AS CONFIRMED BY THE LVPD DISPATCHER. DON'T EVEN TRY IT -- OK ??
ban all guns, america would be a lot safer place 100% guaranteed or your money back
Fucking scumbag

Bet that guy quit hiz job
Thanks God

Chills down my spine
An american terrorist
Americans killing Americans.
That's disturbing
this is bullshit......if a gunman sprayed a crowd, where are the casualties? The band leaves and nobody does anything because nobody was shot. If people were being shot down, there would have been way more panic and way more screaming as people died.
Aldean had a responsibility to warn his audience of the gunfire and to take cover  before running for cover himself.
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for ya?
MY QUESTION IS WHY DID THE LIGHTS GO ON?????????????
Body armor is gonna gonna be the new fashion
I don't know much about weaponry, but does that sound like a paintball gun?!
So fucking disgusting . These days people can't even go to concerts with their family. They went there for fun and then they get killed , That's so sickening
What was the song Jason started to sing ?
Wow i want to see more.
neil is killing it. his brain is on fire right now
This is the Best thing i have seen in my life...what a Vision...
I think it is time for some updates. Episode 2?
was this meant for VR or something?? i felt like i was getting sick watching this for some reason
He is showing us the power and influence that can be manipulated...
plot twist: IT WAS A LIE.
I feel this'd work out better as a game than a movie. Reminded me of SOMA.\n\n Regardless, many things could work with this. I hope they do the right thing!
Thank you so much for continuing this project!!!!!!!
imagine the time to render all that
A game or movie of this would be epic
When will ADAM: The Prophet be ready?
yes! i'd settle for this to be made into a series of clips, i just really want to know the story! you guys are awesome!!
If I was ever a legendary/mystery guy in the post apocalyptic world, that has all the knowledge and stuff, I would want to walk on digi stilts, wear a really big cloak and a badass old guy mask.
Tfw you realise games will never be this good because the entire AAA games industry just exists to make money and couldn't give a fuck about plot and or artistic integrity. \n\nSigh... Please save us oats
that was as fulfilling as sex without cumming
Chapter 1 and 2’s render so great but this is not. Rooms, doors and all area. İ dont like this chapter it’s not good. Modeling, texture and render
Yes a follow up
Damnnnnnn! I love it! How can we make this happen?
Will there be an executable for this one? Youtube's encoding makes a mess of the black levels and introduces crazy banding even at 4K.
A videogame about this would be awesome
So, first videogame by Oats approved?!
I get a SERIOUS Dark Souls vibe off this. Definitely want more.
Come on Oats, make the smart move and start a crowdfunding campain to get this moving in the direction of a full lenght movie! This could also be the stepping stone for you guys to move into the movie business, expand, diversify. You already have the attention of a big crowd here to start the fund raising.
All of these productions show me that Blomkamp needs to be handed the reins to the Alien, Mass Effect and Fantastic Four franchises
If this series continues why do i feel that ADAM is gonna wreck some shit for this dude. Its implied at the end that he will be very useful to some cause due to the fact that he is a terrorist and political dissident
How about a movie? :o *-*
release date for this game???????? xD
you guys are redefining Cinema. GREAT work
This is bugging me, and I can't find her history page, the voice actress for The Mirror, what else has she been in?
The consortium doesn't really sound like a bad thing at all. They harvest organs from criminals to save the lives of many, plus they exile the convicted with a second chance at life, reborn if you will. What more could you ask for??
I want more of this one the most! Stunning and cool story!
Não entendi nada! Mas gostei do poder do Unity!
I was hoping he would carry the other.
What the fuck is this? Is it a movie or what?
This could be a great movie.
Make it a full game
The music though people the music @ 4:11! Mood set.
Their logo looks like the frostbite engine's.
ok listen here, im working my ass off right now to become a storyboard artist and working my self up to be part of directing, gonna start soon college in Germany. \nStuff like this makes me fly on a cloud like crazy, i swear to god if im done with my studies ill try to be part of a production like that, even if i have to bring coffee or do weird shit XD
HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!\n\nMAKE THIS A MOVIE NOW!!! DO IT!!!
this is so bad ass super stoked to see this. when I first saw the first film i was blown away
They are prisoners. Their brains have been transferred to robot brains. Those people will suffer and sad in robot bodies.
GIVE ME A GAME NOW!
That was fucking amazing. I need this to be a game, or a movie. Fuuuuck.
They are all terrorist and Adam is their leader. Now they ready to roll!
Any plans to make this something we could view in engine? It would be amazing to watch this in VR, and I can't imagine it would be a crazy amount of work to do.
Stop giving me blue balls and make some movies xD
For those who dont know: This is a sequel to Unity's tech demo ADAM
For me, a tone if not all of charm and magic of the first film was irreversibly lost with this movie. I can literaly feel that way less work and heart was put into this one than the first film.
This would be a freaking awsome game
PLEASE KEEP THIS STORY ALIVE!!!!!
i'm sure that you could do a movie if u keep doing such an amazing work
So they're all criminals and that's the way they get arrested.
NOW DO A MOVIE !
Oh my god??? I thought I'd never see that again
They walked from the middle of nowhere to China. Now I want to know what happened during that journey
I loved the first part and I love this. So much said with little to no dialogue? Perfect example of show don’t tell.
4:35 jesus what are those eyes, now i cant unsee them, those are weird.\n\n\n\n\n\nwait how the hell does she see from that...
I want a game now.
I accidentaly Skipped this add and instantly regretted it.

Warum bringt ihr so was nicht als Game das wer sooooo geil
Can't wait for crash zoom!! 💜
YESSS. my friend is also in that catherine tate sketch and we never let her live it down.
It may not mean much, but since you announced Last Week was ending I got super busy with school mostly, and life, so when I used to watch on Monday or Tuesday, I now usually watch on a Friday (I think) because I'm behind on my subscription box.
Rik, no C.... omg wait, is he named after Rik Mayall of Young Ones, Bottom and being an amazing comedian fame? 👍🏻
LOOK AT THAT CUTE LIL BB OMG
hey tom.  I think crash zoom should come out on last week #90
You cant end Last Week...you are a part of my life now
no wonder I'm sick, tom got me infected...even from approx. 5000 miles away...bluuhhh
I wonder if Rik will watch this in 15 years…
Last week you dead -_- jk
Tom,\n\nYou need to shoot all those problems away.
Re your thoughts on the views, i personally watched your last weeks the day they came out, but nowadays things are too busy and it takes me a week to catch up with you youtube - so maybe it's because school's started (I'm not in school tho) and generally people are more busy now? I still care tho and I love watching these!
Tom, regarding the viewer count reduction, keep in mind there are other factors.  Here in the states, public school just started a number of weeks ago.  Right around when you made the announcement.\n\nCorrelation/causation and all that. :)
I've started watching last week more since you said about it finishing
About the drop in views, I know some people are the opposite of you with shows - when they know a show is ending they stop watching, because endings, even satisfying ones, are sad to them.  If you don't see the end it feels infinite and full of opportunities.
I just came here to tell you I had the weirdest dream about Tom, he was the joker and he was throwing apples at people. That was it.
Don't know whether you've considered this, but in regards to view count, a lot of university's have been going back over the past few weeks, so people have had freshers weeks, and I know a lot of my friends who have just moved into new builds have yet to get internet connections set up, so maybe that has had something to do with it. Just bad timing maybe?
Zack? Zak the doggo is as old me
Cannot w a i t for drunk uncle tom
Haha, I have that I am actually in my thirties shirt as well and became father of a little daughter a couple of months ago :D
Now that eddie has his kid, what's about you and charly?\nwanna have a baby as well?
Tom what happened to your diet? Wanted to ask for a long while now if you don't mind.
Tom if I could I’d give you a lot of views. Your channel is hilarious and funny. You deserve a lot more.
Your killing the hair style XD\n\n\n\n\nYou have gon back to the pedophile look XD
There's a box WITH A ROCK IN IT
So Tom will be in the next YouTube Rewind as a principal YouTuber, right?\nI hope it's for Last Week and not Beep Beep.\nBecause I want him the be the last one we see in the Rewind and say:\nI'll see you last year ;-)
It's because you broke up with us. It's easier to stop now than be heartbroken when you decide to go. I'm actually sad about it. You're the only vlog I watch and you're part of my little weekly ritual.
I know I can't be personally responsible for the amassing of thousands of views, but admittedly I do sometimes feel bad I don't catch your uploads the day of like I used to. A lot more lately, I'll wait a few days for multiple creators' content, and then binge all of it at once, because that totally doesn't reflect on my life at all haha. \nBut no, seriously Tom, while I can't say some of that chunk isn't due to the announcement, I'd argue that it's also just ramping up towards the time of the year when people aren't as free to watch as consistently as usual. What do those numbers look like after two weeks, for example? It could be that the viewerbase is just a bit slow on the uptake (I know I can at times).\nI hope things turn up soon though, I know it can be really disheartening and frustrating to feel like the ending won't get to be satisfying for everyone.
0:52  *mY nAMe iS jEfF*
my little brother is named Rick But He has the c........
EDDIE IS DADDIE AF I LOVE
But I've already eaten my cinnamon and gooseberry yoghurt!
no its not your announcing the end of last week entirely anyway - I, and a massive proportion of your subscriber base, have just gone back to school, college or uni, and its quite busy. Ive just started uni and I have missed a few episodes but I'm catching up again now. views are gonna be inflated for summer holiday too! its all goooooooooooooooooood
THAT BABY IS CUTE. I WANT THE BABY. IM TAKING THE BABY.
I think a lot of people share your sentiment: I think that now that we know it's ending, a lot of people want to wait until that, so they can binge it like a regular TV show.
is this the reupload? cos the glitches are still in it for me (other than that - loved it!)
You should get baby rick a pickle costume to wear before Halloween, and he will be pickle riiiiiiiiick!
I saw the thumbnail & title and thought he deleted Where's the Baby? from his main channel.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Tom, your camera is dying, you need to fix doze glitches.
My guess is that lots of the viewer base has gone to uni and have been enjoying freshers week 😊
It was so cute seeing Charlie freaking out over the dog crayon costume, literally laughing like crazy
Is anyone else getting the weird artifacting?
The last last week should be a one hour special
Charlie is a treasure
See now that's why you don't dress your animals.
I HEARD ALESTORM IN THE BACKROUND OF THE VIDEO!!!\nFUUUCK YEEEEAAAH!!!!!\n\m/
I’m almost 31 and I’ve never looked forward to the next in a series as much as Last Week in my life, absolute lunacy people would stop watching!
Hey Tom! Use Taxify instead of Uber when it comes out. :)
15:10 what is that game
Congratulations Eddie! Way to be an adult! (Has anyone called buying a man-sized bag of popcorn for the christening?)
It's not like a school disco, no one's getting fingered... \n\nI take back everything I said
It's so confusing that some people can't cope with finalities, even if they are inherently harmless, like a series that has a predetermined ending. It has an ending? How fucked up is that?! It isn't. I don't get this mindset, but on the other hand I know people who didn't finish Cowboy Bebop. Still, if you avoid good byes, you will miss some of the best moments of your life. It's dumb.
well if the views are dropping cause there is comming an end to this amazing series. THEN DONT STOP!!! PLEASE!!! I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE!!
Tom, you might be over analysing your viewership drop off: I think it's more likely that your audience are mainly school/college/uni students, and we're all back to work, we still love your work
People left because they didnt want to suffer through the last episodes knowing that it wont continue
I know I haven't been watching as much/as soon since I'm drowning in exams and homework. I'm having trouble remembering what math looked like not being made of 50%+ Greek letters.
TOM I JUST STARTED MY FIRST YEAR AT UNI AND I HAVENT HAD TIME TO WATCH YOU :( \n\nIM SORRY BUT I TRY TO WATCH WHEN I CAN AND PLEASE DONT GET UPSET BECAUSE OF IT BECAUSE I STILL LOVE YOUR CONTENT AND LAST WEEK VLOGS <33333
Tell them to have another baby and name him morty. That is all.
Tom should get braces, dunno ehy but it looks more obvious this last week
Seems like an interesting choice of music for a ship at 19:49 - a tune with the word 'road' in and based on a location inland, being played on water. I should get out more.
Charlie and I realised what the letters spelled out at exactly the same time. \n\nAlso if you’ve stopped watching Last Week cause of the announcement then go have a bad fuck
Your second pronunciation of Tobias was right btw, if ya didn't check already
That giraffe thing looks like a toy for Eddie's baby. Also EDDIE HAS A BABY, CONGRATULATIONS EDDIE.
I think we might have caught the same virus. And my flatmate too, but he's the one who was in Glasgow and probably infected me haha. Godammit Scotland!
You should name the last episode “The Last Week”
I don't care about the thumbnail or the title I watch it because last week is my favourite youtube series because it's funny and I am sad that it's ending but I appreciate his decision .
19:18 IS THAT FUCKING KEELHAULED IN THE BACKGROUND!?
Tobeeas is indeed the German pronunciation.
I know the reason I can't keep up with Last Week during this month is due to college. Don't know if it's the same for others.
Can you upload the skits from last week by themselves
I saw you at Glasgow and almost fainted because you're real.. YOU'RE REAL
Glitches, Glitches everywhere
Loyal Weeklings unite!
Baby!!!!!
Subtle Alestorm
YES THE ALESTORM KEELHAULED!

29:36 It’s tiny rik!
ARE WE ALLOWED TO NICKNAME RICK TINY RICK
What kind of youtuber blames themselves for a drop in views when there's a wonderful faceless 'Algorithm' just waiting for everyone to yell at it!
Was this video only recommended to me because I searched for Diane NGUYEN from Bojack Horseman, recently?
DO NOT GOOGLE THIS
Was the sonic hedgehog gene named after sonic the hedgehog?
I just got a Ted ad on this Ted video
Robotnic is responsible for this
I will say it again , this channel has thought me more then my school
Saw the actual photos. I need to keep an eye out for nightmares now.
They forgot to mention the Sonic Hedgehog thing with the girls sonic comic
0:45 Hence the reason why Rick is afraid of Cob World
Me: How did you find out this medicine could be used for cancer?  Doctor: Cyclops sheep ................................................................................ *crickets chirp* ....................................................................................
is this real or a riddle?
Hedgehog gene?  As in the sonic hedgehog gene?  I'm not joking.   That's its actual name.
Those sheeps can deal extra damage!\nTOO BAD! Because their range is lower!
you guys should do a vid on mike the headless chicken\n(rooster)
I love the conclusion at the end. SO beautiful
Sounds like the farma corporations wanted to get a hold of the profits so they declared the cyclopamine not safe and instead they developed a drug that does the same thing but I bet with worst side effects...way to go America letting corporations run wild.
Did the sheep blink or wink? The world may never know...
Is Wild corn lilly also called  western false hellebore (Veratrum californicum)? http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/44550/title/The-Cyclopes-of-Idaho--1950s/
Good work on the animation
Tien voice over is the best
So that's what my dick's been eating
please make a video on discovery of zero.
The stranger case I actually find how to pronounce that freaken name. Nuguyun? N-guy-en? ..
Too bad Tien wasn’t talking about three eyed sheep
We watched this in class
Baaaaaaaa....
Why do these sheep have vertical pupils?
I have a hedgehog.....
I have a feeling that whole video was build up for that pun at the end 😂
Loved it, Thanks
Sonic the Hedgehog gene
K
popopopoppooorotiyo d
anyone love the animation? \n\n\n\n\nme!🙌
Cyclopamine... is that where Cyclophosphamnide (cancer drug) synthesized from?
This is the link for that kinds of sheep in real life.... https://youtu.be/vLHc5PKJyAc
The end music was interesting
Anyone thought that sheep is a reference from the odyssey in which the sheeps are in the cyclops islands?
In the cyclops greek tale with Odysseus there are sheep.. hmm..
More than meats the eye\n-TED-ED 2017
the scientist in orange looks like a teen stanford pines
The real question is does the gene make you run faster?
Ok, why does the cartoon cyclopamine have two eyes???
I was kind of expecting a Polyphemus reference, but the pun was way better
sonic the hedgehog+Gene=hedgehog Gene ... That's good to know.
Nobel prize for best farmers should be given.
I have one tiny comment: the DNA (1:19) is drawn incorrectly (it is left handed but should be right handed). But as usual, the video is lovely and I very much enjoyed it :)
your new animator did a stellar job. please keep him.
Everybody if you're reading this please like this comment and subscribe to my page n check out Treble - No Competition. Everybody deserves a chance to at least get heard.. I just ask u give me mine.. Please n Thank you
If your high asf don't watch this
And then they realised that they were looking at the wrong end of the sheep.
Says it's a non profit organization and has a add
Your voice is not clear
Your voice is annoying while listening to this.
Not even 2 seconds in and you're already pushing your atheist agenda. Screw off.
Don’t look up cyclops sheep if you wanna have a good day
why is cyclopamine in corn lillys and why do they bind onto smoothened?
sonic the hedgehog is bad
I bet Nobody SAW that coming
what ever you do, never, EVER look up cyclops sheep. its nightmare fuel.
It would make sense someone named tien talks about some thing with three eyes
Aww thank you farmers and scientists 👍
Amosc: @itsbandzbaby
Don't Google Cyclops sheep!
Damn dem cyclops sheep be cute
toddler
So this is why sonics eyes are conjoined...
Sonic the hedgehog
I have a question, how do we know that the nucleus of the earth is hot?
that pun at last
Dont google cyclop sheep the drawing looks way cuter than it should
When you reallize Soinc the hedgehog has joint eyes!!! :O
Anyone else thinks the Hedgehog gene cell is cutely drawn?
Аниме на аве твоя мать в канаве
Anyone else slightly annoyed that the cyclopamine animation had two eyes
they took 4 decades i took 4 min knowing about their 4 decades
Cloud sheep
More riddles!
No click bait, a unicorn
Those sheep looked like dogs
Da D
Same animator as troll face adventures
Do they shoot mega tears
Stranger than fiction.
btw..you talk a lot!
it's sonics fault
*_PAY THE TOLL_*
Creeps me outtttttt
Use the full nomenclature. \nSanic hedgehogggg geeeeeneee :D
Singular deformity XD
🥁
EVO-DEVO\nHOX GEEENNNNNEEEEESSS!!!!
That ending tho lmao
evolution or defect?
Oh gawd the puns...............
DAMN THAT HEDGEHOG
01:48 spooky!

Hola teacher ether soy empieza con C y acaba con R ❓❓
Happy Hump Day, everyone! Coming atcha with a fresh episode of favorites! Let me know what you loved or tried this month here. 😊
I love that I can relate to you. For horror movies, I have an active imagination as well. If I see or read anything scary, I remember it forever. In addition, I LOVE LOVE LOVE subtitles as well 😂
The 'extra' at the end of this video though! LOL
Hey Jen! I was wondering if you could try to do your favorite nail styles! like just a video about what kind of nails matches specific oufits, preferred shape, colors, designs, etc! thank you!!
Hey Jenn😊 \nMay i know where can i buy your necklace, it looks gorgeous!!!
your eye makeup is beautiful !
THAT BURP. OMG haha it took me by surprise :P
Please do a tutorial for your eye makeup!!! IT'S AMAZING ❤❤❤
Your makeup is popping! I always love listening to you describe books or movies :)
Jenn! I really would like to transcribe your videos<3 Since I've got lots of things from you, I'd want to give you something back!! I tried to transcribe the last video you attached, but I couldn't find the 'add more language' button, why??
I really cannot wait you to read the entire Death Note!!! And watch anime ver and talk passionately about the finale of each ver ;)
Wild is also a movie starring Reese Witherspoon. One of my favorite adaptations. You should check it out!
I swear by Death Note! One of the best manga ever!!!! Your bro got good taste!!\nI love the movie and series too but as they extended it, I didn't watch it anymore.. usually sequels disappoint me but I might watch one day..
Cheryl Strayed (author of Wild ) has a podcast called Dear Sugar that I think you'd enjoy! Her and her cohost's voices are so soothing and I love listening to it when I'm getting ready
PLEASE do a makeup tutorial for this look!! Amazing!
Your eye makeup is always popping' love it Jenn! <3 Can you do a tutorial on this eye look? :)
Makeup tutorial please! 😍 love you! You're so beautiful!
There are a bunch of anime and manga with interesting storylines. Let's just say you'll hardly get bored of it and there are bunch of genres you can dip into.
Thanks for the book recommendation!
Whoaaa, super happy that you've got a chance to read Death Note. It's a bit scary how a high-schoolar decide to kill people very easily, but I read it just because I like the unusual story-line. It's very old manga though, I read it like 8 years ago.
I've never commented a video, but I love your eyeshadow soooooo much ! \nLove from France, C. \n(Sorry for the bad English)
Watch the movie for Wild!!! So good
Hey Jenn! My fav right now is the Laura M. Tinted Moisturizer. The coverage is great and lightweight while I've been living in Spain! Also the app Blink gives great daily bits from self help books. Def look into it I think you'd love it.
If you're interested, Wild was adapted into a movie of the same name with Reese Witherspoon playing Cheryl, that's my favorite movie, you should watch it !!!!!
Omg whats with that last part?! The burping whilst having the dior lipstick up 😐
Hi Jenn!💎 I just submitted my Japanese translation of your confidence video for review 🇯🇵😀 That video is one of my favourites and you've been such an inspiration to me ever since I discovered your channel, so I wanted to give something back 💞 I hope more Japanese viewers discover your channel!!!
Jen... both death note and wild had a movie. U should check it out🤓
Jenn! Do you wear contacts? Your eyes are especially alluring in this video *.*
love this eye makeup so much!!!!!!
I've always heard really good reviews about DeathNote, but have yet to read it. Now I am VERY tempted. Also, your entire look today is so cute! Love it.
Ooooh Death Note! You should watch the Death Note movie! I'm not one for horror movies either but my friend dragged me to the theatre when it came out and it was actually not as scary.
OMG!... you have a korean subs too ! I love it, Thank you
Can any body tell me how can I translate it and add the subtitle on?
You look so pretty. Your eye makeup is on point girl! And you are so damn hard working. How can you post so many videos in such a short time. I couldn't catch up with em all with my new college schedule. But I can never afford to miss your favorites video, can I? Love you sista!! Keep rocking!!
sooo weird, I just finished watching death note! loved it ofc! 💕 ily2 Jenn :)
I came here for the pretty face....I hate myself.
Love that little blooper at the end 😂
We have the same birthday!! 💖 Belated happy birthday twin!
uuugh jenn, this video was tooooo short! Plus it was your birthday month!!
Jenn, I always look forward to your favorites! :)
Love your eye make up!!
You have the cutest friggin face.. I can't even.....🙈
i love how you did eyeshadow! would love to see a tutorial how to do it!
I recommend the Beautiful Anonymous podcast by Chris Gethard
Yes Jenn!! Woo you need to get on that manga and anime train ASAP ☺ and continue on!
Jen, you have been missing out on mangas all your life!
Please tell us what eyeshadow you used
I might be able to help with Japanese translation! If there is 2 people did the translation,how would you pick?
I've got that exact copy of Death Note lol my friends gave me it as a birthday present one year!!
I am similar when it comes to scary movies the visual stays with me. 😣🙈
I had to pause the video because I'm laughing too much at butthole lips
I have the absolute same thing with horror images
The movie for wild is also so good as well
They made death note a movie!! You should check it out I think I watched it on Netflix with my boyfriend maybe about a month ago and it was really\nGood!! I didn't even know it was from a book
I translated pose video in korean <3 because that hour I spent on transcribing the video is nothing compared to how much you inspired my life :) Love you Jenn
i want to help with indonesian subtitle but see someone already did that ^^ glad a lot of indonesian likes you, and also you include you perfect imperfection video in your top5 videos! one of my favorites, it really encouraging me to accept what i already have :)
My brother also pulled me in this manga world and now I'm rolling deeper than ever before. It's good to have a brother <3
Ruff Haus Blouse isn't back in stock :( so sad
Hi Jen! Just posted soms Dutch subtitles for this video. I love your videos and am happy to give something back.  Greetings from Belgium!
There is a series on netflix based on death note, maybe since you like the book you might also enjoy the series :)
OH MY GOD THE BURPING AT THE END. I just..... you are perfect 😂❤️
Can't stop staring at your make up! So pretty! <3
Yes! Death Note is sooooo good and trippy! They even have the anime on Netflix! Don’t recommend the movie though. 🙅🏻
Loveeee your recommendations, like every other month! I've been watching your favourite videos since 2014 and I'm still enjoying it loads! I really liked how you described the fear you have for horror movies because I feel the same way too! However, I've watched IT and yes I think it's watchable, even for me! :)
Death Note is pretty good tbh. You should watch the anime, it's dramatic. Btw, love you Jenn!
I swear you don't age at all ❤
Who was burping at the end 😩😩😩
Omg Jenn I’m so happy with there’s Korean sub!!!! 😍🎉💓❣️I’m Korean,  so sometimes i couldn’t understand English....😭
You should really try to do backpacking, 6 months ago with my school we did a religious walk about 140 km during a week we had to carry our bag with all our stuff (bed, food, clothes,..). That was the best experience a never had. Every night we sleep in church, school,.. In the morning we couldn't talk because this was a walk to know more about ourself. That was really amazing to have the chance to do that. I really push myself and learn so much. I hope you will have the chance to do something like that. <3
make up tutorial for this look please~ it is so beautiful! <3
makeup tutorial on this look! so pretty!
OMG imagining those scary things when you're washing your face? same! i thought i was the only one!
I absolutely love Wild! It helped me get through one of the most difficult times of my life... definitely inspired me to want to hike the Pacific Crest one day :) One of my favourite movies this month was First They Killed My Father, a stunning take on Cambodia's Khmer Rouge takeover during the 70's. And it's all from a child's point of view!
Love your makeup in this video!
Please do a video on how you stay fit❤
Thanks for your recommandations I want to read so much  books rightnow lmao💓
I think maybe I will help translating for Portuguese from Brazil ^^
I really want to do a Chinese caption but my English is no that good.. Actually I has been watching your videos for more than 2 years I think, and from your videos especially monthly vlog I really learned a lot! love you <3
the Death Note anime is soo good! Make sure you watch it once you've finished the manga. Also, please tell me what that purple eyeshadow on the centre of your lids is ? I'm absolutely living for it 😍😍
And I love love your make up and look !!! God!  You are gorgeous Jinn
Can you please tell us what you use for your eye look? Thanks :))))
Nooooo to horror films! Not at all!! 😖
I hope that can change the international shipping becaus I wanna buy that hoodie soo badly😆😆😆 and your whole clothing line🤗🤗🤗😆

People hate for no reason. ....ok maybe the guided Arrow is a sure dumb nonsense but come on its a game where ur playing a dude jumping from buildings and landing on his feet with no problems
instead of curving a bullet where curving arrows now In a whole new way. sponsor by Ubisoft
So this is Assassin creed combined with far cry and metal gear.
Please don't suck.
Hidden blade only playthrough\n 😉👌
Cool
Worst sideburns i have ever seen.
Without present day, AC is bullshit.
they should rename the game in AC: the magic arrow
Directing Arrow - Nothing is True, everything is permitted! :-)
Arrow looks to be a game breaker. Hope I'm wrong.
Cant wait to play this game!!
Looks fun, but seriously, the ability to tame predators and a controllable bird, think it should be named Assassin Creed: Primal
Ubisoft said the same will sell better than syndicate but worst than unity, this has me worried as I feel that whether origins is good or bad, it will never sell as much as previous games and the ac franchise will only keep going downhill. Until Ubisoft lets it die quietly.\n:(
remote controlled ammunition? in ancient egypt? really?
Don't think my 1050ti would be able to play this
so i guess im turning off the hud and not using the arrow for the best experience.
still waiting on a World war 1 or 2 assassin creed game that or a cowboy one.
I'm so happy for games like MGS V and this one it seems. They are GAMES. It doesn't need to limit itself.
Well I guess I'm hyped, I just won't know where to start. People will do amazing things in this game and I'll just sneak around in those bushes.
ok 2 major problems. 1) Steerable arrow? This is even more WTF then the cloaking device from the last game. 2) You have a lone guy walking at night and have your bird attack him and yet you just pop out and put an arrow in his head. Why even use the bird.\nAnd WTF is with the giant MMO pop up damage numbers?
This game is very good in graphics,but if i try to buy and  install it in my pc ,it will blast...
WOW looks freakin great!!! I wanna buy this =D
I want and assassins creed in ancient Japan with Ninjas and Samurais.
Here is my one key question: is an enemy ever too high level to be stealth-killed?
I don't get the part with the controllable arrow. HOW?
La baguette has very good english
so everyone will use bow because it more easy and more stealthy because ai is dumb
Many choices to the player. this is i like!
Looks promising but they better have fixed the modern day story. Another deaf mute character running around the place hacking computers and i'm officially done with AC.
First time I'm going to play assassins creed more then 5 min.
02:30\n\nNope. No thanks. I won't upgrade into that. No challenge at all. But the taming ability is cool tho.
Why can't they make a modern day assassin's creed please man bump this RPG I want a real arrow type assassin's creed
The combat looks so plain.
So i can control the fire arrow? :O
that large enemy type assassination animation needs more work in my opinion....
wow you can change the time\nnew Prince Of Presia confirm
Are the PC specs out yet?
please turn off the numbers when you hit someone  😕
I absolutely cannot wait for this! Every vid I see on it makes me more and more excited! Long live AC!
Take my money and give me that game right now
imo, theres too much control on that arrow, arrows turning corners is just -- wat.
Damnit... This video just made me drop $60 on the pre-order. The hype is real!
Esse jogo vai ser incrível!!!!
I wanna be hyped but the last AC game that was properly optimised on Pc was Rouge please do a good job on Pc i really want to love this game but i still can't play AC3 to this day on PC cuz there's 20fps in cities
I hope theres a way to turn off those big annoying yellow numbers.
Why is everyone complaining about the controllable arrow, it's like the best thing I mean if say if you don't have a great aim then you can control the arrow into where you want it to go..I mean stop complaining people!!!This game is so awesome I can't wait!!!
Games is fantasy,its just for fun.so lets enjoy it gamers!
Not a fan of the cruise missile arrow. How is that logical?
Everything looks amazing! Hope it will be as great as AC 2 :)
Guided arrow ? Is it Missile ? Why Ubisoft.
A demo for PC would be real good....I have some doubts I can't run it smoothly. I saw the System Req. , but still I want feel it with my mouse.....I think you should consider this...
Also delete the damage calculations, this AC not dota's nor fighting game
Even Ubisoft is making a better Metal Gear then Konami...
The number hitpoints that appear above of the ai's head are just too big, they need to get rid of it or make it smaller
BTW,can I aim the arrow at the guard's private parts as I please?Just like we do in sniper elite?
we took a 2 year break so we have more time to copy and paste from other developers
I only have 1 issue with this game. Where are the damn corner kills?! Petition any1? Other than that.. game looks sick
I have ever seen a game like this 😎
Did they change the controls again? As soon as this series went to Colonial America, they changed the controls for no reason and it sucked. Did they change them back to the original version or something new again for no reason?
I wish they made the climbing more interesting than just climbing anything effortlessly and at unrealistic speeds. It feels extreme in this game. I don't like being reminded i'm playing a game in games like these. I want them to be immersive -- To inhabit the world and interact engagingly and believably with it. That's what I loved about these games, but they seem to be going in the wrong direction to me with some elements of this game
You can control an arrow, but cant pick up bodies?
My only concern with the predator bow is not how unrealistic it is but how overpowered it looks. I'm afraid it'll make the game too easy.
Nothing is true, everything is permitted
controllable arrows . that is ridiculous .
Looks like their combining a little bit of Metal Gear 5 and Skyrim stealth.
They should have done controlable throwing knives instead of arrows if you ask me
Please tell me you can get rid of the stupid fucking points that come up every time you kill someone. It looks like they took it from borderlands or an arcade game
Can Bayek kick in Fighting in Battle like Run fast an  fly kicks Medjay Warrior kicks combination of kicks in his Medjay Fighting Style The Medjays Also Train in Different hand close combat like fight kicking his way out fights that what This Game is Missing Can Bayek do combination of Kick Moves while Fighting in Battle Incredible Epic
Why is there no cover system?
am i the only one who thinks that moving arrow is stupid?
For the most part I'm not a big game purist, I'm not sitting here saying no, it has to be like the old AC. In fact I love most of the new things. But I just can't get behind the controllable arrow. If they give a legitimate lore reason as to why you can control an arrow mid flight, then I'll accept it, but I'll probably still never use it. Feels like cheating to me
so no PC on 27th ?
Senu distracting the guards kinda reminds me of DD from Metal Gear Solid V :D
MGS V +1
No double Assasination?
Far creed primal
No multiplayer?
Assasins call of predator arrow
WTF Arrow !!!?
i am so hyped <3
Dat AI
Excellent.
Heavenly Sword?!
Assasin's Souls
Hacer un juego que se parezca lo mejor posible a Egipto, que se vea muy real y luego le meten flechas que se controlan con control remoto. Claro que sí. 🙄 bien de época.
Controlable arrows? Wtf???
Stealth is life :D
Far Creed Origins :v 1:53
Chris Watters!
take out controllable arrows please
looks amazing asff
Can't wait to see how unfinished this game is when they release it. Broken animations, robotic movement, terrible combat, no social stealth, blending into crowds?\n\nWhat ever happened to Hiding in plain sight?
Seriously? Still no cover Animations in a stealth game. \n\nAnd after assassination kills the Nov just falls straight through Bayek?\n\nSoft cover in this game looks like you crouch down staring straight into a wall. Look at the last of us if you want a good example of soft cover. Even did it fairly well in Syndicate. Why is it gone???
Sorry to burst peoples bubbles, well not really. Any how, the truth is that no blacks were not ancient Egyptians. Recent research (yes it is true, look this up people, don't believe, listen and look up, believing in superstition is bs, same with the concept of belief, that's why we have science) has shown that indeed ancient Egyptians were not blacks, instead that ancient Egyptians were more closely European. However knowing that production of the game was some tike before the recent studies, the representation of ancient Egyptians will be inaccurate, or simply for diversity sake, yes it is mostly the first thing, however we've been going backwards for so long in the games story that we've skipped eras, so it's probably as well that they did his for diversity sake.
So a homing arrow is too much but a Pope with an energy manipulation staff, a Master Assassin who can make 20 of himself with a magic ball, an alien super civilization and an eternal reincarnating mad sage are totally fine????.... Go pound wet dirt with your unrealistic arrow comments guys
Please add freeroam
I don't see why people are hating on the predator bow. On every assassin creed game after you kill a guy it's like time freezes while you have a whole dialogue with each other. Can't question logic now
I hope that their is no downgrade. Because almost every Ubisoft game is downgrade
I just wander if you can make the arrow fly in circle forever.LOL
Nissan GTR S2

Marzia During Fall: *makes fun cute autumn video*\nFelix during Fall: *screaming at screen*
I love marzia cause she is so trendy and cool and nice and sometimes we see her butt :)
This video was named after me 😂  my name's Autumn
WHY EVERYTHING IN HER VIDEOS ARE CUTE AND SMOOTH AND MAGIC AND UNICORN 😩💕💕💕
I love your hair
Always makes me happy! Love your videos~~
You make the cutest and most stylish videos on youtube ❤
This legit looks like comercial material. Good stuff.
I want Felix to marry u already
I have no idea if Maria will see this, but I want her to see this comment and know how she is an inspiration to me and probably many others. A couple of years ago I stumbled across her videos, I wasn't  the happiest person ever, I have very bad anxiety, depression, and a very low self esteem. When I watched Marzia videos I felt inspired, she was happy to be who she was and I wanted to be like that, so I started to talk to more people and even started to express who I was, I met a boy and we been together for almost a year now. I still have bad anxiety because of what has happened to me this year, so I wanted to let her know how much she was an inspiration she is to me. So, thank you Marzia :3
You're so lucky it's Autumn. We just had a hot winter and are heading for an even hotter summer. We're all gonna die 😳
I love how perfect for autumn ur hair is!
I love it...\n\nalso this make me sad in the part of felix and marzia pictures, they look so cute...  i feel alone :(
With all do respect you're hot. Pewds must have a huge 50 inch cock to make you stick with him or you both are just a cute happy nice couple. I prefer the first one.
Marzia and Felix Birthday is soon coming up!
OOF
queen
Is this hipster style?
Alternate title: Brilliant aesthetic and calming music = succsess!

Watching marzia's videos always makes me wanna clean my room for some reason. Probably because they look so fresh and clean all the time. 
Felix can you just marry her already
Does someone knows where this is? It's gorgeous 😍
i feel like you alone can do the job of whole commercials studio
My soul is at ease watching this video
She's so beautiful ❤️
feel like you in the fantasy.
Who else thinks that Marzia kind of looks like Natalie Portman?
I wanna know more about your tattoos, can you tell us more about it ?\nIf you want too like my comment so marzia can see it !!

Hi marzia!! Ummm.. ice cream makes me feel sick. No I'm not lactose intolerant it's just the cream specifically. I was wondering if you could make a video about how to make no cream ice cream. I know it sounds stupid, but you gotta help a girl out!

IF YOU WANT MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS SCREAM LOUD IN THE COMMENTS AND HIT LIKE ON THE VIDEO BECAUSE OTHERWISE I LIKELY WON'T I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOUS ACTUALLY ENJOY WATCHING FOR UPLOADING BETWEEN BIGGER PROJECTS OKEIS? Okeis :) ENJOY! xxx
Personality is definitely a huge reason as to why I subscribe to people. Also, I love this video, Melanie - it's like when you go out with your friends and you all get ready together, it's really nice. ❤️
LOVED THIS!
He's not gonna wanna ride me 😂😂\nMan I miss Ireland 👌🏾
You were on the same hotel floor as Prince Harry.... the envy is freaking real. Love that little ginger pr*#k. \nCONGRATULATIONS on winning such an incredible award!!!!\n\nYour short film was absolutely stunning Melanie. Plus I JUST finished your book, my Goodreads review is already up and I cannot wait to review it on youtube either!! RAVING about it I'll have you know :) \nThink your hair will look lovely long again. Yeah it's definitely all about a personality when it comes to subscribing to someone. Like with you as I mention in my book review of Fully Functioning Human (Almost), I love watching your videos because you are so open and honest, sometimes a bit too open but that is why we love you!! You're like the best friend we all wish we could have. And you cocked the Jenga up hahaha
I love all the videos you do but I do miss your makeup and skincare stuff. It was what made me start watching you in the first place and what helped me clear my acne. I really enjoy the real news of them and also find them super relaxing. Your spoken word videos are so powerful and my absolute favourite thing you've done.I hope you do a lot more of those too.
i couldnt explain how much happy i am seeing you putting makeup on..<3\nnever stop making them..
Tony didn't rape u  you lying bitch you slut
Another great video! Any chance of the hair brushing video I requested appearing soon?
I only follow people that I would want to be friends with. I don't know if that's weird
Melanie channel 4 unreported wold is doing an episode about the vote for choice in Ireland!! Watching it now 7.30 Friday night xoxox
me too ! i watch videos for the person and their personality i just like it when they make different videos otherwise its boring the same thing over and over again, i totally agree with you .
LOVED THIS! Congrats again on the award Mel! I was giggling because of the tipsyness that was shown ;P
what colour is your poo?
I watch people for their personalities, I like hearing their perspectives on life and the world. I enjoy some beauty stuff as well but talky and arty videos are my favourite :)
I love your videos and you!! Your short film made me cry!!! 👌🏻❤️
Congrats on the award!! you are amazing xx
I love this video!! I love it.\nAlso, you surprised me in a Dodie video! It made me smile.
So I couldn't see any comments that said what I wanted to say. \nYour film was powerful and F***ing awesome, you definitely deserved the win and I hope you had a great time at the award show.
SCREAMING FOR MORE LIKE THIS!! <3333
Congratulations!!!!!! So happy you won!! To be honest, I'm from Canada 🇨🇦, and I had no clue abortion was illegal in Ireland until your film! So glad you are bringing more attention to the subject!
Im so proud of you for winning that award for your first short film cause it was bloody brill and such an important topic that needs addressing!!! Xxx
I subscribe to people for their personalities mostly. It almost doesn't matter what type of videos for me. If they draw me in and I find them interesting then I'll sit through whatever content they put out! I really like channels where it's not always the same thing, but you get to see the people being who they are
I am definitely going to try that hair trick with the straightener. I am terrible at doing hair. That's my next skill to tackle. I'm getting better at makeup but hair is still way over my head. No pun intended. Haha
Your staying in the hotel I stayed in when I was in Canada!!!

I follow people I honestly think I could be friends with
Loving these types of videos, and I agree, I follow people more for their personalities, cos if I like them as a person I know I'll enjoy all their videos.  Congrats on the award, you really deserve it! xx
I like your chatty grwm. It's a good balance of make up and personality
I absolutely lurve these chatty grwm's where you talk about life and stuff and would love to see more!
A 58 year old couple in the US watches you because you're a lovely young lady who helps keep us in touch with what it means to be young. \n\nDuring your hair prep my wife said I didn't know you could do that. Not sure what. Think I'll find out.
Melanie you look bloody gorgeous! Well done on your film you super talented lady. Could I please ask where your earrings are from?!xx
I got ready while watching you getting ready and I did my hair while watch you being drunk on red carpet. Gotta go to school. Love you drunk! Love you forever! 😂💕

CONGRATULATIOOOONS IM SCREAMING JUST LIKE YOU SAID!! Though I follow YouTubers because of their personality tbh . Hannah, Lindsey Doe, Calum, Michael Rizzi, Jessie, you...
Love your vlog style, it'd be awesome if these were commonplace :)
Congrats Melanie on winning your award! I absolutely loved your film!!! Hope you had a blast in Toronto!! From one died red head to another, I feel your pain about the fade out. I product that I use and swear by the keep my red bright is the Ice Cream Hair mask. I don't know if you have it in Ireland. Literally put it on your hair (dry), leave on for 20mins then wash out as normal. I always get asked if I've re-dyed my hair after I use this stuff. Much love from Toronto!!!! <3<3<3   http://www.inebrya.it/en/products/special-treatments/kromask/cherry-red

Congratulations, you really deserve it!! You never fail to amaze me! ❤
If the people knew...: *cut*\nWe will never know... 😔
I follow youtubers for their content and humor mostly, and i subscribed to you cuz your videos somewhat have a calming effect, understandable cuz you have anxiety and you understand what's needed for us to calm down. And your enviable foods from your Food Diary Fridays. Plus, that accent 💚 who wouldve thought you've got all these interesting stories, and the causes you fight for ( physical and mental health, sexuality + lgbt, etc) made you one of my fav youtubers.
I am so proud of you for your work and for winning and ughhhhhhhhh I wish I could hug you!\nAnd yes, I too subscribe and follow people mostly for their personality. You too. <3
I love your chit chat make up. Best ones love youuuu
I just wing this every time. EeeEHHHHH!!!! LOL\nI can't hears yehs...you're not talkin to me. OMG LMAO\nCallum should announce all the awards shows. LMAO
this made me laugh so much :D
Knocking over that tower could have been drunk me as well! You are my spirit animal! :D
Loveeee this type of video, it feels more personal :) I tend to follow and subscribe to people who have similar interests too myself and people who if I met them I would deem as someone I would have as a friend :) xxxx love you Mel, keep doing you
Congratulations!! Super happy for you - really, really well deserved!! ❤️
Congratulations on the award!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Love it congrats you deserve the award 💚 🙂
i was watching your video and thinking 'my god she's the same as me: get late putting make up on, gettin drunk just before an important speech, soooooo true' Thank you for being so real. And by the way, your film is amazing
Well done Mel! You smashed it. There are lots of jealous people out there, and you acknowledge that you ain't perfect (nobody is), but damn it, you put in the effort and for that you deserve it x
I'm so happy you had a lovely time and you won an award! How amazing is that?! :) I thought I recognized your outfit as I work at Coast so I'm glad you like our stuff as I love your style, it's so quirky which is what I like :) Also I subscribe for personality, I get bored easily so personality is what grabs me to a person and yours is so down to earth :)
you are such a natural beauty xx
would you ever consider only using cruelty free makeup, not trying to be rude or anything I am just curious :) love your videos
You, Dodie and Hannah are some of my favorite youtubers. I just love all of your personalities!
Yess, love those videos!! more videos like this!
Wow congrats on your short film Mel!! I've shown it to my parents and gran to start discussion for the referendum next year since I can't vote!!

Congrats Mel! You deserve it babe 💚
Congratulations Melanie! You totally deserved it!

My favorite movie is Titanic  , it did look like it in the movie !! Love video
Hahaha I'm so glad you liked the chocolates! Sitting sick in bed coughing my brains out and watching your vlog is the only thing making me feel better. LOVE YOU GIRLIE!
oh shit, i’m sorry i was so awkward when you were filming!!! but it was lovely meeting you, and you are quite hilarious when you’re drunk. 💖 congratulations again on your big win!! you’re so deserving. sending lots of love your way!
I first subscribed to you when you first did your beauty videos and I do still love beauty videos (I find that they're weirdly calming and good for my anxiety, almost ASMR-like) but I've always been subbed to you for your personality.
To help more dogs like Lena find their forever home, you can support the Takis Shelter: http://thedo.do/takis.
I have 5 dogs. All rescue dogs. They are all great. Love them.
That is sooo amazing!!!!! That man is soo kind!!!
Thank you for saving her life.
Whats good!!!! love watching you guys!! You guys always have good videos. Check us out Home of the XL Pitbull's in HoustonTx  WE are Ultra!!!!!
That’s a shame that is just a shame lord have mercy what made people do that to dogs😭😢😡
How was that dog still alive? GREAT JOB
Do you see the dog in my pic? Her name is Lena to❤️🐶
Sorry to ruin the vibes but anyone who thinks its acceptable to not only abandon a pet, but to tie it up and deprive it of a chance to forage and fend for itself needs to be hanged.
who lets their dog  get like that? just happy she was saved
48 dislikes? I already love my dogs more than human beings. The dislikes prove it.
That's one hell of a transformation. It just shows a dog doesn't hold a grudge.
Made me cry. Well done for keeping going. Sometimes animals bite out of fear.. you can see when they are going to do it by their body language if you pay close attention
Awwww this made me cry lol happy tears! Lol great job! She is literally smiling 😀
Just so people know, you can make super cheap liposomal vitamin C from recipes online. This type of vitamin C is great for daily health or rescuing dogs like this one that were starved. It helps provide nutrients that they need and get them back to health.
She is such a beautiful and interesting looking dog. 🙂✌️
I feel like the person who left her their couldve been a homeless person that either left without her because they couldnt take care of her, was arrested maybe and never was able to come back or might have left one day and maybe died, leaving her orphaned. Those are the most likely choices seeing that there was a bed next to her and some supplies.
I personally think this channel is a lot better than PETA's
0:01 when your anerexic cousins tells you they’re not hungry
All dogs, even the one person types, will be loving if given half a chance, then lots of patience and love.
Well done in restoring her back to fitness and emotionally being able to connect with humans again. an appalling thing is in the UK you can torture an animal to death and the maximum sentence is a pathetic six months imprisonment.
48 people have no soul.
She still seemed like she needed to gain some more weight. Unless, of course, she's just one of those skinny breeds.\nEIther way, she definitely looked so much healthier and happier. So glad she got the help and love she needed.
How wonderful -- it's amazing that dogs can learn to trust again if given enough care and nurturing.
Oh my Lord that poor thing thank you godbless you for saving the  dog
Poor baby I'm glad she was rescued.
She's so beautiful , glad there's people out there like. That guy that gives they poor little angels a second chance. Big respect
If we rescue these precious animals they will return that love😍 She is sooo beautiful
Avoid chickens also (KFC)...etc.\nSave all animals ! Both are equal to human 👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👏👏👏👏
This channel always lets me know that there is help for humanity. God bless
She looks like some idiot cut her ears half off with scissors. I'd be snapping at people too.
The righteous one cares for the soul of his domestic animal but even the mercy of the wicked is cruel proverbs 12 10
you are awesome that video made my day  God bless you
What a beautiful dog... whoever did that to her should have the same done to them!
Oh thank God! Thank you all for saving this poor sweet INNOCENT darling. It is NEVER the animals fault. WE are supposed to care for them-not just eat and abuse them. I am having trouble seeing my phone. Some crap in my damned eyes..thankyou Dodo.🐾😇😘😘
That's what I like yes gain more weight!
I want that dog. She's beautiful
Awesome job! Thank you so much for taking care of that dog and restoring her confidence and giving her a life. Much respect to you.
What kind of sick mofo would leave a dog and abandon it
NICE
its suprosing that this man is greek im greek and most ppl in my country are so ignorant
THANK U SOOOO MUCH FOR SAVING HER U ARE A HERO XXXX
I am so glad there's still people that helps these poor babies thank you rescues.for helping them God bless you
I hope the people who abused this poor creature ....are never allowed too own an animal again ...she looked sooo happy in the end ...God bless the rescuers xxx♡♡♡
Fantastic video, i am so pleased that she pulled through, i am really happy for her. No dog should have to go through that, but it happens all the time. Owners who buy dogs and abanden them like this should be fuckin shot, it annoys me so much. I am just glad that she made it alright thanks to the guy who took her in.
So i give her some whey protein to gain more muscle..
These transformings are amazing to watch!😍
For this dog to recover and even become social and loving is a testament to the good found in ALL dogs. Great job Takis Shelter folks!
You are a good man , God bless you with eternal life.
Wow, I wonder if that dog was fiercely protective of her rescuer.
Its so sad to see animals like that 😭
God bless him for not turning his back on her like whoever did this! This world is a better place because of rescuers and people who try to right the wrong done to so many animals! Thank you for what you do and who you are. Seriously.
i love this channel and his lovely stories so much.
IF SHE GOES TO BITE THE HELPER SHE BITE AGING.
😪 bless this kind soul helping her
Poor baby! So glad he saved her... an amazing transformation x) 🐾💚
Great vid. Kudos to the rescuers!!! One thing I would suggest is to allow dog to smell your hand and if possible start petting under the chin vs. On top of the head. The hand over head bit can actually be quiet stressful because they dont know where your hand is going. When its under their chin it shows them what your doing...less stressfull for dogs.
God bless the  man who saved her !And rot in hell the scumbags who left her  in that  condition!
she was smiling for the camera at the end of the vid. awesome! so glad for her
it's surprising even this video got dislikes. Cant understand such people's mind.
I wish my country have animal recue or shelter. Even if I volunteer to rescue stray dog/cat people wouldn't care and I bet my kidney they wouldn't want to adopt one
Treated well a dog will be faithful forever.      Semper Fidelis
Im in depression... I needed to throw some kittens because of my dad and i think one of my class mates saw me😞 help me please
You, sir! Had my big respect!!
Brought tears to me eyes! 😢
Damn, thank you for existing
We need more people like this man in the world.
I love these kind of videos...don't stop posting them
Animals have souls and feelings too. I hate how humans think were godly enough to just even take an animals life no problem... #vegan is more than just a lifestyle, it was meant for us.
Persons like this guy can make this world a better place.
I am crying now, I hopefully this poor dog will be happy and good place. he was a good person on the world for helped.
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A CLICKBAIT. THAT DOG LOOKED FAKE. . NICE HEART FOR THE GUY THAT GAVE HER LOVE AND A SECOND CHANCE IN LIFE ❤
god bless you for doing such things. #respect
love these videos great job in.helping that dog out 👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
What a beautiful baby! I want to kiss her sweet face!

You guys need to seriously stop hating on Pepsi and Kendall. They both would appreciate if all of the world stop giving them a crap. Here's a solution: Everyone can shut up their rude donut holes and get it over with. You should be glad it's not you going through that
because you are stupid...
When are you going to apologize for the Vogue India cover BITCH
How is this shit bad? I seriously don’t understand
But you knew what u were doing like da fuq u mean?? She's not the only to blame...to all the people that participated in that ad from the Pepsi team to the actors in the ad are just fucking stupid
Aww cmon leave her alone, I know what they did was wrong but cmon it’s just a Pepsi commercial. Go flame the CEO who made trillions of dollars instead of the Victoria’s Secret angel.
that fucking lip job is ugly as shit
What the hell was wrong with the ad?
I’d cheer her up😋
Umm.... shouldnt the person who made it not star in it apologize? unless she made the damn commercial, funded it, wrote it, etc seems like she just wants it to be about her... actors never know what the story is or full script, theyre just given lines and told to act
Everytime they do something wrong (like putting their faces with music icons without asking or being a part of a stupid commercial) they don't apologise they just say oh it wasn't my intention i'm sorry *fake tears*\nthey need to stfu and thank god if they are famous and rich without doing anything.
oh my goddddd life must be so hard :'(
Who cares. Men just wanna see the booty
Why would anyone blame her and not Pepsi? It's not like she's the one who wrote the commercial. \nIt's like blaming Harrison Ford and not Spielberg for kingdom of the crystal skull.
My heart breaks when I see her cry..😗💔
Kendall is one of the shadiest people ever. She made fun of Kylie's lips yet look at her now! Lmfao what a joke.
Wth she was so pretty before but she doesn't look good anymore.
She doesn't care about people's safety or if anyone gets hurt or not... She forget we've seen her driving?
Not a fan of Kendall, but wtf it's just an ad. This generation is so fukin retarded, making issues everyday about something.
I feel so bad for her
I watched the pepsi commercial and I don't understand why it's so bad and a scandal? Someone explain?
The kardashians is what everything is wrong with the world
This commercial seems to be more innocent than people are twisting it to be. If your automatic thought is racism, then maybe you're the racist. all I saw in this commercial, what I CHOSE to see was the fact that something so simple can bring people from all sorts together. This isn't a hate commercial. Seems more like everyone is really sensitive.
Kim  ''This is the first time you had a scandal''
As a British person who doesn't know who this girl is I would just like to say god bless America!
Instead of empathizing with those that felt this was wrong, the chosen approach was to cry and make this about her.
why should anyone feel stupid for cracking open a cold one with the boys ?!!!
MAYBE SHE JUST NEEDS SOME PEPSI 😂😂
Kendall it's ok pepsi will solve everything, even your lips.
Nobody needs anything everybody is beautiful   ....... remember  that Kendall darling 😏
everyone: “THE PEPSI COMMERCIAL IS SO OFFENSIVE!!1”\nme: “yeah ok but why though?”\neveryone: “......... THE PEPSI COMMERCIAL IS SO OFFENSIVE!!!”
This was so funny I shed a tear
What was wrong with the commercial?
How did it affect anyone though?she just gave some geezer Pepsi and fucked off
Fucking kardashians thinking they are so cool \nWhat's the difference between my family and there's \nNone \nThey are as average and boring as us \nThese twats get money for just living for no fucking reason \nDo I have a 10 Billion Fucking Mansion No\nDo I look like I have had so many Botox injections I look like mickey Rourke No \nWhy am I not famous \nBecause they are Totally interesting\nFuck them \nI have more of a life than those kardashian cunts
I don’t feel bad. You looked at the script you saw what the video was going to be about, yet you went with it. Cry me a river but I wouldn’t give a shit.
To all the people defending her, I think people do have a right to be offended. She appeared in an ad that did take the topic of police violence a light topic. So people are gonna get mad that she thought this ad was okay to be in.
Oh for God's sake leave the girl alone!
Oh life is so hard for you!! Bless your Armani socks !
honestly, kendall, people were not offended.. but why the fuck didnt nobody thought the symbolism of trying to use minorities concerns in the US  showing them just doing stupid shit in the streets, trying to sell the ideogram of capitalism  ( coca cola, pepsi)  in the hands of a very privilege girl that is the epitome of  vanity and everything wrong in entertainment... might be STUPID!!????
Her apology is so fake and pathetic.
Now let’s make a Las Vegas ad
For everyone saying she got her lips done look at her photos from fashion week Ker lips are normal
So since she was a part of she the ignorant bitch? But none of the other hundreds of people in it are? I think she was so excited because Pepsi asked if she wanted to be in a commercial wouldn't  any of us be excited?
At the end of the day she STILL makes way more than you guys make in a day! 🤷🏻‍♀️
I liked the ad. her giving the cop a Pepsi acknowledged that he's a human being too
Umm here was a mass murder a few days ago.. let's try not to worry about some pathetic over privileged celebrities.
Cool what acting classes is she taking?
honey this is months too late
looking forward to day this fucking family fade away like a bad case of the clap\nalways looking for sympathy all the time\nwhoever looks up to these idiots needs a good smack around the back of the head
Why are people lying like if they were gonna get paid 1000 they wouldn't do the commercial ? Foh .
Was my first time watching and thought who gives a shit lol
Why is it such a big deal
Someone PLEASE tell me what was wrong with the advert.!
I mean... there is some real negativity in these comments. Especially around 'who cares' clearly you because you watched the video. Why does everyone need to be nasty nowadays?
Oh no she wouldn't hurt anyone on purpose... Remember this TS thing.... This fam is a bunch of liars
I literally saw nothing wrong with that commercial. People are just WAY to over dramatic, y’all need to take a Xanax or something 😂
To all the people this is relevant to.. Please get a life.
Someone should have gave those shooters in las vegas some pepsi.
First time you've had a scandal LMAO
Sounds like she needs a Pepsi.
She didn't even apologize 😂😂😂 all she's worried about is how dumb she looked to the public. What a joke
Really, Pepsi is at fault. She is just a paid model.
She's a model, not the producer. Tear them down and not her
Meanwhile in Africa. Oh the problems these plastic people have. The problems...
I don't know if I blame the Jenner/Kardashian family for being so stupid and tone deaf. You got a group of girls who have lived in a completely different world than the rest of us and have no idea what life is actually like and what is really going on in American politics. Listen, they all got famous because they are rich, stupid, and have ton of plastic surgery which makes them perfect for all the idiots who love reality tv. Why such high expectations? Isn't the whole idea behind their appeal is that they are so far from reality that we watch them like some form of circus freak show? Personally, I hate reality tv and had not heard of the Jenner side of the family before this happened. I knew that there was Kim Kardashian and that she had some sisters but I didn't know their names. I watched the Pepsi ad and thought Yep, that seems about right. I had low expectations as these people are only famous for being idiots, so why all the hate? You are specifically hating them for the reason why you all watch them in the first place.
The ad was a moronic piece of shit that should not exist.But crying over it is just pathetic.I've never respected you because of how you make a living, the type of person you are and your family.But the respect levels are In the negative now.
I'm just waiting for someone to do a leave kendellll jenner alonevideo #leavebritneyalon
Did she have lip injections?
Didn't she tell Kylie not long agothat her lips were too big? I think she said Nobody needs anything, everybody is beautiful. Right...
Her lips are clearly done lol
Fuck this fucking bitch
never have i heard her apologizing for the things she's done, only her playing the victim
Fake fake FAKEEEEEE
Good
LMAOOOOOOO
lol Skendall
Scandashians. .. what a life.
Lol shut ur talentless ass up bitch
Love kendall
Her lips :(
Poor lass
Crocodile tears lol
no...kendall... your lips.. I mean, whyyyy:(
Give em a pepsi
Drink a pepsi
Poor thing <4
Grow up
Famous for fuck all useless fuckers
Why it cause controversy?
Bullshit
0:19 glad you understand something
Oh, fuck off.
OH BOO FUCKING HOO
Lol
Fuck off
Comedy
Congratulations on the show getting picked up!
Trae! Love yer stuff, buddy. But I have to take issue with one small thing you said. \nLiteral arsenal. Tell me please, how many weapons does it take to justify the use of the word arsenal? I have about a dozen. Is that an arsenal? My collection is actually paltry compared to some. To me, an arsenal would comprise hundreds of weapons. \n\nI know. This is a petty point compared to the loss of hundreds of lives. But when I hear the news describing any amount of weapons more than a few as an arsenal, it rankles. \n\nLove yer stuff, buddy. Keep it comin'. Oh, by the way, I have thousands of rounds of ammunition too. You need about that much to have a decent beer can shooting party.
What's your plan? What are we gonna try?
Wow. That was pretty intense, love it.
Amen Brother..! Clinton & Obama held office for 16 years.. & not a single gun was confiscated..   still everyone in my State shake in their boots over losing their guns..
There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. The U.S. population is 324,059,091 as of June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.000000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\n• 65% of those deaths are by suicide, which would never be prevented by gun laws.\n• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified.\n• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – better known as gun violence.\n• 3% are accidental discharge deaths.\nSo technically, gun violence is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Now lets look at how those deaths spanned across the nation.\n• 762 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago\n• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore\n• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit\n• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)\nSo basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\nThis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.\nNow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equal, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\nAre 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault are all done by criminals. It is ludicrous to think that criminals will obey laws. That is why they are called criminals.\nBut what about other deaths each year?\n• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!\n• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths.\n• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide).\nNow it gets good:\n• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer walking in the worst areas of Chicago than you are when you are in a hospital!\n• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If the liberal loons and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total number of gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides ................ Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions! So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It's pretty simple:\nTaking away guns gives control to governments. The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\nThus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs. So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed. We now know what they're trying to do
This bro a true OG
Thank you, John Wayne Jr, well it's  how I feel when someone stands up for what is right. Thanks for using your talent and humanity to help all of us. Take care
I cant wait for your bump fire ban video so i can make u look like more of a  fake redneck fucking idiot where's your heart felt message when 102 where shot on a 4th of July in Chicago yea wasn't a white shooter watch 1st 48 if u want to know where most violent gun crimes come from look at my NFL protest video I just went and got a brand-new jersey do to the fact I didn't own one everything about you is fake u can only pass this of on sheep libtards that can't think for theme selves I know you were sure as shit safe because you wouldn't be any where near a country concert
I'm surprised that bump stocks and drum mags are legal. Literally no reason for either aside from enabling mass shooters. Bump stocks are only used for rifles and the only reason for a civilian to own a rifle is for sport shooting and hunting. Bump stocks are used for full-auto fire which ruins your accuracy. You will not hit a clay target with a bump stock. You will not hit a deer with a bump stock. Unless you're suppressing multiple targets or engaging in close quarters combat (which won't happen outside a war zone), you don't need a bump stock. The odds of America being invaded are next to none. You will never need to use a bump stock.\n\nHigh capacity mags aren't needed either. If you need more than 30 rounds with a rifle, more than 15 shots with a handgun or more than 8 shots with a shotgun, that makes you a terrible shot. There is literally no reason to own a 100 round magazine other than to kill innocent people.
And again you nailed it to a tree. But one question: Why is your t-shirt on wrong side out?
YES! Thank you for this,  gives me hope.
I'm up here in Canada, horrified, yet again. I live without guns, in an area where most folks don't have guns. I know that there ARE Canadians with guns. There are folks who like to eat what they hunt, so they get the huge assault guns to take down moose, big deer, caribou. Some people who farm out in the boonies have no choice, they have to carry weapons because of coyotes or bears. Sometimes they have to put down an injured cow. But most of us just don't care to have them on our person, or in our homes. \nGuns just aren't necessary. We somehow get through our day to day existence without them. Imagine that.
Thank you for being the voice of reason.
Guns kill people, so do food additives, pharmaceuticals, as does many other items, but when the deaths are in your face we ignore all but guns. Yeah lets ignore the chemical genocide perpetrated by people like Monsanto, and cause shit for the anomaly.
The GOP is constantly yapping about being ProLife.  Yet the legislation they support, write & pass is anything but.  From denying climate change, to H.J.R 69, to Healthcare, to trying to rid The Clean Water Rule, The Migratory Bird Treaty Act, The Antiquities Act,  to DACA, to lead bullets, to this horse manure & etc., etc., etc. .....................defecating where we eat, is okay, as long as a GIANT corporation is making a buck.
consider this ...the extreme death toll in the civil war went out of expected proportion for one reason...no one understood the kills per minute the new models of cartridge amo could produce....same with any mass attack....if guns don't kill but loonies do, then remove the automatic weapons and let the looney go find a rock or a stick and see how much damage he or she can do in nine minutes at close range.....Australia has it right...that crowd of criminal's kids are some of the best fighters in the world and know when silly turns into stupid...just sayin'.
So, what's your solution?  SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED.
There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. The U.S. population is 324,059,091 as of June 22, 2016. Do the math: 000.000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\n• 65% of those deaths are by suicide, which would never be prevented by gun laws.\n• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified.\n• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – better known as gun violence.\n• 3% are accidental discharge deaths.\nSo technically, gun violence is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Now lets look at how those deaths spanned across the nation.\n• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago\n• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore\n• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit\n• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)\nSo basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\nThis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.\nNow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equal, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\nAre 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault are all done by criminals. It is ludicrous to think that criminals will obey laws. That is why they are called criminals.\nBut what about other deaths each year?\n• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!\n• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths.\n• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide).\nNow it gets good:\n• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer walking in the worst areas of Chicago than you are when you are in a hospital!\n• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If the liberal loons and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total number of gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides ................ Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!

It must be preserved at all costs. So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed.\n\nAnd also....In 1933, the ultimate extremist group, the National Socialist Party that's the actual name of the Nazi party led by Adolf Hitler, seized power and used the records to identify, disarm, and attack political opponents and Jews. Constitutional rights were suspended, and mass searches for and seizures of guns and dissident publications ensued. Police revoked gun licenses of Social Democrats and others who were not “politically reliable.”
Thank you, thank you, thank you Trae. I've tried to reason with people al week and it's exhausting an painful. So reassuring to hear someone mirror the same commonsense logic we know.\nSadly even liberals are giving up, even when they could be the next victim.\nIm not American. I'm from NewZealand. When I was eleven this guy went berzerko and dispatched 16 people. I wa lucky, as a kid it was pivitol. When kids think How can people do that to people? The grown ups FUCKING MUST deliver for those kids that they have the right to a world without mass murders.\nThen we just bit down on the belt and cut off the gangrenous limb. It was strightforward and done in under 6 months. Common sense Gun Control. A gov buyback and amnesty got rid of all the now illegal guns. Hunters could still get license for rifles and shotty's. Farmers all still have'em. But the licenses mean business and they're not to be fucked with. No BS joytoys aloud but. No pistols no semis or full autos.\nThat was33 years ago, we haven't had a triple gundeath since.
You're hilarious on your podcast. Peeps should go check it out 💜
Love it, Trae. Agree with you 100%!
I think you're HILARIOUS !!  It is TRUE that 74% of Domestic Terrorists are WHITE MEN.  Check Google.
Over 500 people here in Vegas got introduced up close and personal to the 2nd amendment...I think the right to live out weighs the right to be a toy soldier....
your right, it ain't funny. it's so sad. w
I agree we need to do something
Guns don't kill people... people kill people.
Amen, little brother. When a nutjob shoots some congressmen, will THAT be the right time to talk about it?
What gun law would have stopped this man?
From Australia.wonderfully said my friend.
90+ people die from gun viloence *every day* in the US. More than 200 are injured.\n\nIn California, in order to drive a car, you must spend 25 hours of classroom time and six hours behind the wheel with an instructor. Then you must get a learner's permit and are required to have an adult licensed driver over the age of 25 with you whenever you're behind the wheel. After that, you must take a written test and flawlessly pass a practical test before you are legally allowed to drive on your own. You are also required to carry liability insurance for each passenger vehicle you own.\n\nIn 36 US states, there are no legal requirements for gun registration, no permit needed, no license necessary to purchase and own a firearm, and nothing compelling owners to carry liability insurance.
WHY NO GUN CONTROL? THE GIANT KOCH OWNERS OF THE USA DON'T WANT IT, THAT'S WHY\nWhy would government by the rich and for the rich care? -- it's poor people, the future Soylent Green, gettin' shot. Not until Alistair or Wellington shoots up a Billionaire party that takes out the Koch brothers and Isle 9 of the Walton owners will the corporate owned government be told to actually allow gun controls to be a thang -- and this all because madam Porsche thinks reasonable gun control might be a nice present for Natasha's sixteenth birthday since her family got shot up and all.
It's insanity every responsible gun owner I know already hates when morons get a hold of guns why can't we come to the table on this
You just expressed exactly how I feel.
And one more thing....can I have my own personal nuclear weapon?  Pleeease?... What?  Why not?  What about MY freedom  to do whatever the hell I please?  It's my adrenaline rush, baby, I love blowing shit up.  Don't worry, I'll go to a bombing range and only launch them at targets. I know what I'm doing.  I'm pretty sure no one will break into my house and steal any of my bombs when I'm not around.  Besides, nuclear bombs don't kill people, people do...
gun license should expires like a DL, and a psych test be mandatory each time. Mental health has a bad stigma attached to it. When a person is on the edge rarely is anyone there to help..make guns illegal to stop the carnage, the war on drugs has worked SO well. (sarcasm) if you want to know what its like to have your cake but no right to eat it, take a trip to Singapore..disneyland with a death sentence.-look it up... -End of ramble.
Holy shit did you really get the go on an ABC show?! Yay!!! I hope it's true. Can't fucking wait!
From the Department of Homeland Security website: The number of Americans killed in acts of terrorism – both on U.S. soil and abroad — between 2001 and 2014 is 3,412 (including the victims of the 9/11 attacks). During the same period, 440,095 people died by firearms on U.S. soil (homicides, accidents, and suicides). In 2014, for every one American killed by an act of terrorism in the United States or abroad, 1,049 Americans died in the United States because of guns. http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20161005-comparing-u-s-deaths-from-terrorism-vs-gun-violence
Man if only we pass the right policy people won't murder people any more. You're retarded dude. What exactly are we going to do that'll stop it? Yeah lets #stophate because it's completely feasible to legislate away the human condition.
I love you, Yeah, this IS the time to talk about it. Like Naomi Klein said, the ONLY time they want to talk about any issue is when nobody's listening.
Shooter was also a liberal. He specifically targeted conservatives at that concert.
They don't miss a beat to make it political when its a person of color or a Muslim as the perp.
This guy's a fellow liberal but a redneck and understands his people far better than me. Perhaps I'm more well spoken and college educated, but this man is profoundly smarter than me in several areas that I'm not remotely well versed on like he is. \n\nI love guns, when I go gun shopping what do I look for? I play a lot of L4D2. So I look for guns that I'd want in a zombie apocalypse. The next gun I have my sights set on is an RPK, with a 200 round belt belt fed magazine, and a bump-fire stock or a trigger hand crank. A bipod, a foregrip, and a scope, and a flash suppressor so the zombies can't see from which direction I'm firing from. I can have all this for less than $2,000.\n\nBut even as a lover of these weapons, I do find it somewhat absurd that any jackass off the street can get one of these, no questions asked.
You are trying and I appreciate that. Thank you.
The majority of gun deaths in America aren’t even homicides, let alone caused by mass shootings. Two-thirds of the more than 33,000 gun deaths that take place in the U.S. every year are suicides.
My favorite is when they say such and so is already in the law!  Oh yeah?  I guess this doesn't affect you then.  Get the fuck on board.  If it's law, we'll overwrite it with the same law and nothing changes except people can't say we didn't try something.
As a card carrying, hippy, commie, pinko who doesn't own a gun I couldn't agree with you more. In order to get my card I've had to wear a beard for 30 years. Always hard finding a good pair of scissors to occasionally trim with. Right next to my Kroger's is a salon supply store. They have REAL nice scissors. But you have to have a beauticians certificate to buy scissors at a salon supply. But I can go to one of the many pawn shops near my Kroger and buy an assault rifle or seven with my driver's license! Nope, nothing wrong here.
As much as I like your channel and content, I have to strongly disagree with you on this. You're a smart guy and have thought about the logical journey of we should just try to keep guns out of the hands of deranged people. In all cases, the deranged behavior was not noticeable in advance. You and I would be strongly against instituting Minority Report-type laws in this country. Our Constitution prohibits such laws.\n\nPeople, whether politically, religiously or mentally motivated will continue to kill people . . . some with firearms. This is a fact of life , not just here, but everywhere. To expect total safety is a stupid notion.
If a bunch of toddlers torn apart by gunfire didn't do the trick nothing will. Y'all are doomed to relive this nightmare over and over again.\nWith every new incident the chance of somebody you love being among the dead increases.\nFrom Holland, with love I wish for all the sane ones among you to be spared.
I just found you, via a thread on FB. Awesome stuff. I have a question and request...because I can see how you resonate well, could you do some over your more poignant pieces (guns, kneeling, etc.) in a cleaner version? Personally, I don't care, but I do think there are folks in my circle that would miss the message because they'd focus on the vulgar language (convenient, and true). Just a thought...you make such valid points
The Vegas shooting was, if I'm correct, the 273rd mass shooting in 2017. The day after was the 275th day of the year, so my question for those saying it's too soon to talk about it is...when in the ever-living fuck CAN we talk about it?? At this rate, there will NEVER be a right time and at this rate it will ALWAYS be too soon. Proposing common-sense solutions to prevent tragedies of this magnitude from happening in the future is NOT heartless, it's quite the opposite. What IS heartless is offering thoughts & prayers while continuing to do NOTHING. (and this is coming from a christian, y'all.) People can continue to say it's too soon to talk about it, but for thousands of families who lose their loved ones to gun violence every year in this country, it's too late.
I have an idea for a starting point: how bout we start at the top? When we can demilitarize the police, and stop our military from illegaly invading every country with their highly- advanced weaponry, then we can start talking about regulating the weaponry of the citizenry. Until then, it's ass backwards to talk about limiting the citizenry. Should the police and military be more heavily armed than those they supposedly serve? I have asked so many people about the global evidence: how many of those countries which have disarmed their people have standing armies and militarized police? Nobody has been able to answer this. \nAnd, yeah, this shit stinks to high heaven, white, black, purple, green, i don't give a rat's ass...\nI also don't believe a bunch of brown people highjacked some planes with box-cutters, and flew them into buildings unassisted, knocking down 3 towers with 2 planes and yada yada yada; but everyone just emotionally reacts, understandably, and starts talking about we need our heavily armed, aggressive, invading government to regulate our choices. \nIt's topsy-turvy, yo
Your points are so valid. People need to hear this. Gun control doesn't mean take ALL guns away. It means limiting specific guns that have no need to be in civilian hands.

Intelligent men are so sexy.
Dear Americans.\nWhen you visit Europe, do you feel unsafe on the streets? Do you feel you must carry a gun for your own protection?\nNo?\nWhy is that?\nCould it be, that, because no one (NO ONE) in Europe walks around armed to the teeth? (It's illegal to carry as much as a knife in most countries) In some countries (UK for one) when you walk up to a police officer on the street, chances are they do NOT carry a gun. (They do carry tasers, so don't mess with them)\nUnless you go to some very shady areas, chances are you are 100% safe from the general population. \nAnd, frankly, I would like to point out, I've visited the US many times over the years. I've never felt the need to carry a gun, or any other weapon. Anywhere.\nSo don't give me this BS that you need a gun for your own protection. You don't. No one does. And if you do, then you better be in the Armed Services, because THAT is what your second amendment refers to. Not Joe Public on the street.\n(And btw -- most Europeans think the Americans are complete nutters when it comes to guns. It doesn't do you any favors.)
Trae is awesome as usual, but unfortunately most RNs where I'm from won't listen to him. Great guy!
well what would you consider a practical solution that doesn't involve screwing over the rights of millions upon millions of American citizens?
If people are hung up on armed citizenry/militia to stop 'tyrannical government', an argument that doesn't hold any water in modern warfare, civilians can not win against the military even with comparable weapons because training matters more then weaponry.  200 years ago 'training' consisted of pointing a gun in the direction of the enemy and being ballsy enough to not run away when the other side started shooting.  In other words it was not about skill so our revolutionary era minute men could fight without be utterly massacred by the Red coats.  Try that today and you get Syria.\n\nEurope is noted for having virtually no guns but their is an exception,  Switzerland.  They have UNIVERSAL militia memberships, everyone is ISSUED a gun and trained yet they don't have mass shootings because gun ownership is treated as a civil responsibility, recreational shooting is also popular in Switzerland but no one considers that a right.  Anyone serious about militia's for purposes of national defense and civil liberties would be all over the Swiss model, but no one in the Republican party is interested.
I love your words but something in this video made me stop and go Oh hell no, he didn't just say THAT! It seems the FAVORITE excuse for White Shooters is that they are/were crazy. You NEVER hear that being said regarding Black shooters. Please consider that the White Shooters are indeed sane and knew what they were doing.
Thank you Trae, for NOT making this video about laughs and righteous indignation.  How many more horrific events have to occur before we engage in honest discussion about keeping our families safe?  I ADORE your rants and laugh my a$$ off every time I watch but the death and injury of 500+ people warrants a sincere approach.  Well done.
When a toddler at a in-home daycare shoots two other toddlers with a gun in the house...then something is WAAYYYYYY beyond FUCKED UP!
Watching this from Germany, and couldn't agree more with what you're saying. Thank you for making a point here, particularly with your personal background. We need more people like this standing up for the cause.\n\nOh and btw: I'm not saying that German gun laws are perfect, but at least we have some mechanisms in place that make it considerably harder for anybody to obtain firearms in the first place.
Trae, I wish you lived near me and were my friend. It's hard to find friends who make sense like you where I live.
you're foundation is broken man....
Background checks for Bump Stock devices would be a good start.
Mmmmmm mmmm you are way too clear in your mind and way too objective with your views on what the truth is about this topic. You are a libtard fella!  Just like me!  I have been thinking that someone should try to start a reaction to this shooting that could put pressure on American business to move against this insanity by forming an organization to support the prevention of anyone entering their premises with a gun. Put up detection and screen the people entering your store, theatre, or any private property that can make their own rules. Once enough business has joined it will finally bring some competition into the market place to provide safety for customers!  Tourism industry should also be a part of it!  I am pretty sure international travelers are going to be affected by this because there are a lot of them in LV. Remember when the MGM fire happened?  There was just a little movement to encourage installation of sprinklers for safety in hotels. It turned out that so many organizations threatened businesses with only placing their conventions in safe locations that almost every major hotel made the change. And that is a lot bigger investment than some scanners at entrances and a few sign, maybe in some instances even a security guard to stop anyone who sets off the alarm. Hell, the business could even threaten the offender with civil action and have the offenders pay for the cost. \n\nWhat do you think?  Why don't you use the idea in your show and on your channel!  As I have said before you are a breath of fresh air and I would like to see you become a major influence for better things for Americans!  Hell, you could have a way better America First policy than the Donald!  And I mean it. Plus he doesn't even rate in the excitement of young chicks department!
I'm in the extremely unusual (on the Internet, at least) position of being a dedicated, dyed-in-the-wool gun nut who HATES most Republican/rightist stances.  I consider myself a centrist/progressive and normally Trae here is my *man* ...but in this one instance I feel a desire to voice...not so much *objection* as conscientious counterpoint?\n\nPassing laws will not stop criminals from obtaining guns illegally, because criminals are people who do illegal things.  People have the strange notion that Cracking Down on Guns, making it incredibly difficult or even impossible to get guns, will stop gun crime in this country.  There are a number of reasons why this stance is flawed, and why I feel like blaming the guns for these shootings is missing the point.\n\n1.) there are already a banananillion guns in the U.S..  We don't need to be able to buy *new* ones in order for there to be plenty of firepower around for people to do each other in with.  Other countries can get away with no, our citizens will not ever be armed because they were never armed in the first place.  This country?  Not so much.\n\n2.) Firearms manufacturers have been making it a point to end-run firearms control laws since firearms control laws have been a thing.  Create a newer, stricter set of legal standards to define 'Assault Weapon', and firearms manufacturers can, will, and *do* figure out how to kajigger a new firearm such that it doesn't legally qualify as an assault weapon under those laws.  Whatever method is left for people to purchase Regular Sporting Guns with, firearms manufacturers will find ways to make those guns as close as possible to being the things people actually want to buy.  because that's how you make money as a firearms manufacturer - you make guns that people want to buy.\n\nMost importantly, 3.) The Vegas shooter's *guns* did not decide to kill dozens of people and injure hundreds more.  The Vegas shooter did.  As Trae himself pointed out, this is concrete evidence that the man was deranged.  And yet, rather than seeking to improve upon this country's *disgusting* infrastructure and methodology for finding, helping, or even restraining if no other choice is left to them, people with mental instability and other issues...folks want to lock up all the guns and tell perfectly healthy law-abiding citizens like myself who simply happen to enjoy shooting sports as a hobby that we're *all* deranged psychopaths who need our guns taken away and for all the other guns in the country to be melted down into commemorative spoons.\n\nControlling guns does not stop violent people from doing violent things.  Could gun laws in this country use revision?  Oh my GAWD yes; not only are they ineffective for the purposes that terrified/furious anti-gun citizens are asking of them, they're a confusing contradictory *mess* that's almost impossible to keep fully straight.  They've needed rewriting for decades.  But we shouldn't be talking about getting rid of them or making them impossible to own without jumping through hoops so high and on-fire that no one bothers.  Gun ownership is indeed part of American culture, one of the things that makes us *us*.  \n\nCan we do better?  Absolutely.  But I never shot anyone or anything that wasn't a target on a range post.  I don't hunt, I don't carry, I don't actually support the NRA despite my deep enjoyment of the hobby because those guys are just...no.  I'm a regular, sane, everyday Trae fan who can't figure out why Trump hasn't been impeached yet, has no idea why people can't get over their gender issues, and who just also happens to be into hobby shooting.\n\nWhy should I suffer, lose access to my favorite outdoor hobby, and suffer the same condemnation and scorn as a deranged criminal whose actions I detest and condemn as much as every one of you?
Thank you for always straight shooting it and not coloring over anything....
Keep up the good work Trae.
With you all the way, Trey. Keep proving all of us Southerners aren't all alike. We're not all GOP Trump/tea party supporters. Some of us believe in gun control. Some of us aren't racist. Thanks!
It's only important to ban guns when white people die. Black lives don't matter.
Just saying, but criminals kind of don't follow laws...
Go far enough left you get your guns back.  Do you really want to disarm the left when Trump sits in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave?
I like your comments. However, I have a suggestion for you to consider. Record a monologue without vulgarity.
Why is your shirt inside out Trae? Love you Trae!
So refreshing to hear someone with a southern redneck accent and a background with guns say it like this. Thank you.
Amen.  Nice to see someone with common sense.  New subscriber.  Fact is both sides need compromise.  10 round clips and one gun a month.  Whats out there already stays out there.  The ATF needs to bury manufactures of these automatic conversion add ons.  You want 30 round clips and full auto, sign up and serve in the military.
I love this! I posted a rant on FB that says a lot of these same things. Thank you.
What I find so disturbing about pushback against common sense steps to control access to guns by those unfit to do so is the total lack of empathy on the part of those unwilling to compromise. I'd imagine that any 2nd Amendment advocate who lost a child, sister, mother, father or other loved one in Las Vegas would have a hard time arguing against closing the loophole in gunshow sales, internet sales and person to person sales today. Would have a hard time arguing against the outlaw of devices like the bumpstock or trigger crank, disallowing the sale of drum magazines or extended magazines. These are just common sense steps against items that should never have been allowed in the public domain in the first place. But until these people suffer through a tragedy like that in Las Vegas, Orlando, Virginia Tech or San Bernadino, they can't even begin to have a little empathy for their fellow human being and say, how would I REALLY feel if that happened to me or someone I loved. It can't alway be about ourselves and what we feel is best for us as individuals but needs to be about what is best for us as a nation and human beings. Great video, new subscriber here.
You make some great points and relate enough to start a conversation, I do disagree though ..only because it's not that the government won't tyrannically take over now it could happen years from now a century from now .. and it might not even be the government but an overthrowing of a country or a civil war of sorts or a revolutionary war ...but yes something has to be done !
Satan has been cast down to earth.  Greed and lust have always been with us, but what we are seeing right now is about impossible to explain any other way.  All the gun control in the world, and the cops still have guns.  This man could have easily qualified to become a police officer, had he set out to do so at some point earlier.  And he is not deranged.  This was planned years in advance.  He committed himself to serve Satan early on, and he did exactly that until the very end.
Nothing will change. It will be thoughts and prayers everybody will look appropriately solemn for 10 minutes, then screw that back to normal.
It's more attitude than anything.  Take, for example, when your grandfather was young.  Guns were not glorified nor was violence, most people hunted, even city folk.  This is the difference of today when most don't actually know how to handle firearms safely nor are the people who commit such tragedies getting the mental health care they need to prevent an horrid crime such as the Vegas Shooting.  That is where the line should be drawn.  Gun control just slaps and band aide on the symptom and does not address the underlying disease.  That and manufacturers should stop producing such overly powered firearms to begin with, if they didn't exist, they wouldn't get used.
( This guy had explosives because he was rich are you people deranged? Guess who else is rich and has explosives and doesn't mind collateral damage involving innocents....hmm which group of people could I be talking about?? )
You hit the nail on the head! \nCant get any more obvious that we have a huge problem with not only guns but racism, being bias, and simply covering up the truth. Unless  and until we admit there's a problem we won't ever be able to fix the problem. We must start with... Hello, I'm American and if you have one drop, I'm not gonna like you...
Preach it brother man!!!

Thank you, Trae Crowder.
Amen
Thanks
We love you, Trae!
I keep hoping
Fakest accent ever makes sense with all this #FAKENEWS
Alright I'm definitely pro gun. The problem is criminals don't follow the law. There going to do what they intend to do no matter the tools they have to do it. In my opinion it's just as easy to go buy a vehicle or make a bomb as it is to buy a gun. In the case of the Vegas guy he was extremely wealthy and could have easily obtained the same fire power through illegal means. I understand the want for more regulations but then there's 3rd party sales. Even if everyone had to go through an ffl dealer for 3rd party sales what about all the ones before the new rules. It would limit the market to guns pretty new laws but it's pretty easy to make a fake bill of sale. And a full ban isnt economicly viable. Millions of jobs lost and not to mention the amount of money tied up in the weapons industry. Who's going to cover that bill? Either way it's not a gun problem it's a people problem and I don't think there's really much that can be done untill people evolve past petty hate.
Knocked it out of the park!! Great tribute song. R.I.P. Tom Petty. You will be missed, but your awesome music lives on.
Thank you for showing support to all the fans and respect.. to a great artist as such yourself.. thank you
Great tribute guys! Rest in peace Tom.
Was never big into Coldplay but they sure are good Respect 🤘🏼✌🏼 Great tribute
Tom could really hit those top notes, consistently, brilliantly, every time. Such a talent, all those great songs and that special voice of his.
One hell of a cover !!!
You never heard anything bad about Tom Petty he was truly one of the 'good guys' and mega talented songwriters!
now I'm a fan of them. HUGE respect
Bye Mr. Petty!!! We’ll miss u...
What a wonderful tribute to an American legend..Tom Petty
Everyone recording vertical lol!
Props to Coldplay. Well done!
Ok this is cool. But I guess since tom petty didn't kill himself he doesn't get the same recognition and playtime as other selfish band leaders. Mental anguish or not....
I'm sick of this rule in pop culture that dictates you must hate coldplay. Fuck that. I like coldplay, I like their music, so suck it.
Great cover, Coldplay. Nicely done. Tom would be proud.
Not sure if Coldplay does this for every big name musician that passes but they did one for the Beasties MCA.
That was so terrible 🤢
Respect!! Love you cold play
😪❤️
Just saw Tom live in May this year. Glad I didn't wait. Thanks fpr the memories Tom. And im not a Coldplay fan but much respect to them for having the balls to do this last-minute tribute. They did a great job
He is FREE and making more music for the world above.
It was so wonderful to hear this. My wife and I hugged each other through this whole song. So glad I was able to take her to this show. It meant a lot on an otherwise very shitty day.
Lovely...teary watching this...Tom Petty and The Boss wrote the lyrics to my life growing up...
Where’s the bass notes?
Thank you for sharing that.
Fantastic tribute to Tom Petty.\n\nGreat work, Coldplay.
Essa música é show! Valeu Tom Petty! Siga sempre na Luz.
Too many Goodbyes. Too much to take...
I hate Coldplay, but this is alright!
Tom Petty one of the best nobody did it better now your really free rip thank you for everything
I wanna go to their Concert at Rose Bowl this October 6th but no one wants to come with me due to the shooting in Las Vegas.
I was there! SO GOOD! It was SO emotional - they came out very solemnly, asked for a moment of silence for Vegas, then went into Free Fallin'. It was SO emotional! <3 <3 Love them!
RIP to everyone lost their lives in last few days
Thank you Coldplay.  You are a good band honoring a legend.  I can't believe Tom is gone, it was like he never aged.  Anyone who didn't like his music was no friend of mine.  I imagine him meeting Elvis, Jackson and half the Beatles and imagine the jam session.
Not a Coldplay fan but a very nice cover & tribute.
shout out to Coldplay great tribute to the great Tom Petty!!!!....R.I.P TOM
Most emotionl version of Free falling I have ever heard. I am so heartbroken over the loss of Tom Petty, his music has been the soundtrack to my life. He was by far my most loved. I cannot believe he's gone. RIP Tom :(
I was there, and it was absolutely incredible. Chris is such a great guy :)
a  aweosme tribute to Tom Petty...oh my wht to  say about Tom    just a man  of  many great songs   reminded me lot  of the  Bob  Dylan  style,,, i   so remember  all  of   his videos  this one   def sticks in ma head,,   RIP Tom you will be missed!!!!!
Not hitting the high notes but lovely tribute anyway.  I miss Tom Petty already.
RIP rock legend, Petty's the greatest.
Loved him and his music.  I listened to him for 40yrs.  He was great in concert.  Better to have seen him once, than not at all.  RIP
Rip Tom Petty ,wonderful music over the years.
Chris Martin - star choice song for a legend x
Man, you can't do it :)
Mad respect for all of you on stage and fans. One more light just went out...

Ah wonderful. Looks like a really special moment. Lucky Portland. Miss you Tom Petty.
Two major losses in 2017 with Chester Bennington and now Tom Petty... RIP legends.
Heff wanted company up there, and who better to share a space in heaven with than Tom.

That was an amazing concert last night and a wonderful tribute to a rock and roll legend. RIP Tom Petty.
Rock the heavens Tom. You will be missed. 💋
That last part gave me chills, man.\nNo, I'm not crying right now what are you talking about
I was at this concert

I guess he learned to fly when he got his wings R.I.P 😇😇
What a beautiful tribute. This is amazing.
I SAW MY HANDS IN THIS VIDEO

RIP Tom Petty
RIP
que lindo  espacio que deja la gente  , en los conciertos afuera, , para poder llegar  hasta el borde del escenario   :)     en Argentina eso no pasa   :)  :)    ;)
Of course the corniest band ever would choose this song. Of fucking course they would.
Peter buck is the man!
He fucking butchered this if you cant sing that high dont try to
Stop disrespecting by butchering the death people song. You have done enough, Chris Martin.
Nice sentiment but poorly executed.\n\nTHERE IS ONLY ONE TOM PETTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nRIP Tom!
I hate Tributes swimming on the wave of fate for PR. Guys you going too one day don’t forget that! ColdPlay 👎🏻
This video raises the inevitable question, is there any corpse that Chris and the boys won't fuck the shit out of? That lumpen drum sound, the guitars lacking in any kind of feeling, the walking vagina and embodiment of middle class liberal guilt Chris 'the plagiarist' Martin, unable to hit the fucking notes. Had he even heard this song before? When this bunch of washed out cocks die they'll no doubt release own posthumous tribute to themselves to grab a few more quid from beyond the grave.
Peter Buck?
Coldplay always have to be the bride at the wedding and the corpse at the funeral,take a back seat you egotistical fucks
Not a fan of Coldplay.....and a big Tom Petty fan......they did an average cover of his work.
That has to be the most chill reaction to people freaking out over nothing ever. Calm down internet, it's just a way of saying that you should try to accept yourself regardless of your flaws. There's plenty of people who do say awful things, there's no need to try to find those qualities in someone who has a track record for being mostly positive all the time.
Love this video. Great topic. One question is the background music The Doogie Houser tv show theme?
People don't love unconditionally, otherwise they wouldn't get upset - if you are coming from a place of love, there is no place for anger. So your original message was correct, but broken people react the only way they are able to at that time in their life.
This is a really important topic, and I think you handled it really well.  It was really helpful to hear what you had to say about it
I just learned a LOT about myself
Fill my void \n *That's what she said*
every move a sphinx kitty makes looks like it is planning to take over the world.... even climbing on a shoulder
I love that you came back and made a video about this important topic since there was so much frustration about the topic within your fan base. Appreciated! Good content!
Thank you Kati because this is so true and so people just disregard it
I wouldn't worry about the twitter experts. Folks on that app like to think they know everything about anything that may roll into their twitter feed and they are required to spew their knowledge in the most unsavory of ways. YOU ROCK HANNAH :)
It's true that you definitely can love someone when you don't love yourself, but it gets so much deeper and more beautiful when you love yourself first.

This is an amazing video! Thank you for allowing us to sit in on such an important discussion
Good on you for taking the input and deciding to talk about it, especially with a professional. It would be easy for you to say Ah, screw it, shut up! but you chose to have this convo and dive deeper than 140 characters. Awesome, Hannah! 💚💛💜
Self love is awesome! It’s one of the first things you taught me about, and I for one do agree that you can have a relationship before you love yourself but in order to give yourself completely into loving someone else, you’ll need to love yourself so you can tell yourself that you can do that. But that’s just me, I understand other perspectives💖💖
oh boy here comes a giant  too insightful comment! so i realize that i am 22 and i'm young and i think i know everything but really i know shit so take my words for what they are. I hated myself for the longest time, i started lately to begin trying to be less critical, which is not working out great but it's a start, and i have to agree with the fact that you have to love yourself to love someone else, not in the sense that you are incapable of feeling love for others, i fell in love and hated myself, it actually made me feel a bit less worthless, but it was a disaster, it wasn't mutual, i felt loved back but i wasn't and it fucking hurt, made situation even worse after. Before being with others i believe you have to decide who you want to be, maybe my mind is too old for my age but i worked out who i want to be, and i'm trying to and even if it terrifies me i'm now tired of being alone and i want friends and i want someone whom i know loves me back. Sorry it's a really interesting topic and i'm not having the best week, and i overshare on comments cause i kind of don't know if they get read or they disappear in nothingness. I'll shut up now, good video as always, hope you're doing good guys ^^.
Lovely video\nI love how mature you are, Hannah 💜
I've been struggling with this a lot recently. Just got out of my first ever relationship, which lasted 6 months, with a guy I knew I wasn't right for but who showed me love when I didn't love myself. I've had depression and anxiety for basically forever and have consistently struggled with loving myself for years. Even though we wouldn't have worked out if I was healthier, we probably would have had better times and I wouldn't have cried to him so much, asking him to show me that I was worthy of love. Got to figure out how to support myself so I don't put myself in another unhealthy relationship.
Calling Hannah neurotypical is eh... An interesting choice. Y'know, since she has ADHD, which is a neuropsychiatric disorder? I use the term neurotypical as a way to describe the alienation I feel as an autistic person in abled groups of people. I doesn't really apply to mental health overall, since that isn't necessarily related to neurodivergence.
Hanna I thought your tweet was honest like where you were at. I appreciate the video and found it very helpful, Thank you you are an impressive young lady-
Funny. I was just journaling and read some of my old entries, where I found this from a year ago: ... By self-love and self-respect, I learned to speak up. I actually learned to feel love. And let myself to be loved. I learned to open my heart, to give and to receive. To make the room for myself and for others. And forgiveness. You cannot love if you have reserved a place for hatred. \nNow, these are just my feelings, not marginalizing all people. I had a relationship before I learned to love myself and I loved my SO, and still, do even after a breakup, but it was not enough. I was never able to utter the words I love you, was always insecure about every of my movements, sentences, decisions. And it was a very childish way of the relationship, more of a friendship with occasional sex. I understand, what others come from. You can love even you hate yourself. But at least for me, you cannot love unconditionally, without fear and with comfort. There will always be some skeletons in the closet, which will burden you and your partner, therefore your relationship. Now I'm happily in love again, with the feeling stronger than me, making me say stupid things like my SO is the most beautiful person on the planet. I was never able to say such things, now I'm not ashamed of being in love, not scared of being vulnerable. Just happy to have an awesome partner in life :)
People need to get over themselves. You can't say anything on the internet without someone jumping down your throat for no reason. It's obvious what Hannah's tweet meant. Use some basic critical thinking skills and stop inventing reasons to be offended, people. #Smh
Thank you for bringing attention to something that is so important. I recently was thrown in to caring for my grandparents and the stress is unbelievable. I constantly remind myself that it's all for them to be happy. It's stressful but worth every minute I get to spend with them. And yes... We all need to take a day or an hour or a minute just to hit the reset button
This is a wonderful reaction to that tweet, Hannah. generally i've seen you handle it very well. It's lovely that you're willing to listen and modify an opinion!\nI've learned from this as well. I was quite opposed to your tweet seeing as my girlfriend would probably say she hates herself, definitely not love, but I also really see our relationship (by now) as a very healthy one! \nWhat Kati said about self-care being maybe a more important factor in that makes a lot of sense to me though. My girlfriend does work incredibly hard to take good care of herself, and I don't think we could do it without that. \nthis has been nice. i love you both <3
Thanks for the clarification. I knew what you meant when you posted that, and I agree with you, 100%. I've seen firsthand how insecurity and self-doubt can affect relationships in my own experiences over the years. But it's always good to clarify :)
On some days I self-love my brains out.  HAHA j/k thank you Hannah and Kati great video
My thought response to your tweet was that you’re absolutely right and that’s because my immediate thought was about those in abusive relationships. I myself have never been in one but I know people who have and what’s gotten them out of those relationships is realizing they deserve better. So I thought you do have to love yourself enough to know your worth and if you’re giving your love to someone who just makes you feel worse than it’s okay to walk away from that.\n\nSpeaking more from my personal walk of life, I have depression and anxiety and more often than not I will have days where I see myself completely worthless and I hate everything that I am but I know despite that my heart is so full and I am capable of loving someone else. \n\nHonestly Hannah I think it was a great tweet as a reminder to yourself and others who may struggle in the same way. And after some of the response I think you handled it very well. Thank you so much for this video ❤️
Wish I had two friends like you!
Great conversation! I think something that can get lost in this topic is what it seems like you were referring to a little bit in your tweet. The world is a mirror to our internal experience, and if we don't cultivate self-love we can react really negatively to facets of ourselves that we see in other people. So, while we can love others regardless, there can be pieces of them that we struggle to find love for because we are too preoccupied with our own self-loathing.
She said something about love wells. Now I wanna hear y'all talk about love languages lol
There was nothing wrong with your tweet .i think most of therapists I've seen have said this to me soooooooo............. love to ya Hanna you're awesome
I was one of the people who was hurt by your tweet but after this video I realise, I actually agree with you on so many points. So thank you for this great video :)
I think 'neurotypical' has just become an umbrella term for anyone who does not suffer any type of mental illness. Not sure if it is scientifically correct, but that's the common usage these days.\n\nalso i really liked this video, i think that quote (you cant love others til you love yourself) could definitely use some adjustments to clarify its true meaning. Kati is so great!
If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else? RuPaul says it all the time 😊
im so happy you guys made this. its sad and very surprising that you got negative feedback on your Tweet Hannah, but i love this video because I've been trying really hard over the last year or two to do exactly this; love myself (and love myself before i love someone else). its really important to me personally because I've never felt that way about myself before. thanks again guys!
Thank you for this Hannah <3 I am a firm advocate in loving yourself, but sometimes it's difficult to practice what you preach. Thanks for the reminder <3\n\nAlso I've seen people use Neurotypical to describe people that don't have any mental illness or cogntive/learning disabilities so maybe that's what they were referring to? I don't know, but I heavily disagree with wanting to promote self love as 'neurotypical'
Oh wow, this hit so close home I had to pause the video around 2.25 because it was making me cry. I'm gonna watch the rest later at home where I can cry 😂
Love this, such a good message to send out to the world <3 I find it strange some get mad at being told this, however some people find it a hard fact to accept. Thanks for making a video on this Hannah! :D
you need to learn how to love yourself before someone else trys to live you or love them
I love Kati!! And I love this collab. You both are my YouTube mental health gurus. I only see my counselor once a week but I get my fill in when I need help from you both. Much love.
Thank you for showing how we all have love surrounding us in some shape or form and that we can do attitude x
Heyy I think the problem a lot of people had w the tweet (me included) was that it seemed to simplify the issue wayyyy too much. And that it could easily affect some of your viewers who admire you and may be in self-hate places right now by making them feel defeated if self-love seems far away from them right now even if they’re on the journey. This was a great video which really gave the issue the time it needed.
I love me so much that others can easily learn from my behavior on how to love me.
i feel like what people usually mean by this comment/phrase is that people who are unable to love themselves or even find anything positive about who they are as a person usually wont accept love from another person, often pushing it away stemming from the thoughts that they arent worth it.. idk but it makes sense to me as someone who has struggled with it
Awesome, I'm not sure I can truly love myself, good to know it's not necessary to find love
A couple of points I'd like to make.\nFirst being that you are in the entertainment business first and foremost. Please remember you cannot please everyone all the time. It's impossible so that being the case please remember to give yourself some grace and professional distance from the comments you see otherwise I feel you will be second guessing yourself all the time. \nSecond point. When you have guests and/or your friends on to help illustrate a point that you point out somewhere their credentials. The whole video and in the description i kept waiting for something like, 'Hey, this is my friend _________ who is a __________ and/or is a licensed ________ who is with us today to discuss ________.'\nWithout that information to me it's just two like minded people trying to reiterate a point.\n\nAs always Hannah, luvs you since the first day I saw your videos and will continue to do so. SMOOCHES!
I think it is hard to love somebody if you can't love yourself. Cause not loving yourself will lead you to make choices that hurt yourself and therefore the relationship. You WILL hurt people.
Neurotypical is a term I have seen a lot on the internet and from what I understand it means if you are giving advice regarding mental health then you have no idea what it's like to struggle with mental illness. Being called neurotypical in this case is essentially in the same likeness as someone advocating for veganism telling people with chronic illness that they will be cured if they partake in a plant based diet. That if you drink water and get fresh air, that will cure your depression forever, that would be considered neurotypical in this case. Unfortunately that develops a very unhealthy rhetoric for people actually trying to gain self worth and recover from very self destructive behaviors. No, practicing self care is not going to cure you forever. It t won't suddenly fix the amount of dopamine or serotonin your brain may not produce on its on its own, but it can make day to day life more manageable and maybe even enjoyable. This internet culture of needing to actively be self destructive and that if you aren't your advice or experience is invalid is highly damaging. Whatever you can do, however small the act may be, to bring yourself some peace is worth it. And as someone who struggles with PTSD and depression, I can say that and still be valid. You are not broken for wanting to feel better in your own life and experience.
Great video and great message! Of course you can't fully love someone (without negative strings attached) until you love yourself (and, additionally, have been loved by others - not necessarily in the romantic sense). Someone who says they love you, when you hate yourself (not necessarily to an extreme) may be just in it for their own gain; there is a difference between reciprocal love and codependency. The *vs* part (the title) is a bit...off? To me if you were to compare the two there is already a clear difference as one is based on one person and the other is based on more than one person; love can be one-sided, reciprocal, or not love at all but a feeling that is confused as love. All of this is okay! We live, we learn. Keep 'em coming chickadee!
GIRL! ME! So true. Glad you spoke about this!
I am really impressed by the way you've taken critique lately, Hannah. I felt like your take on the subject was wonderfully nuanced and I appreciated your ability to take on other people's thoughts about self love and refine your understanding. As someone struggling with mental health issues who is in a healthy relationship with another mentally ill and also chronically ill (CFS) person, this video was a great reminder of some important things for me personally and I will definitely be having a loving conversation with my partner about this subject very soon. Thanks for the timely kick in the bum and the great video ^_^
I appreciate that you took something you said that people found controversial and did a constructive deep dive on it. You clarified without being defensive. It was a really beautiful way of communicating. Thanks :)
Kati's karma necklace tho <3  I never take mine off!
great video!.. but... is katie's shirt a bit offensive? i just got the feeling someone is going to say something bout it haha
Hannah I’ve recently accepted my sexuality as part of who I am and I want to come out to friends and family. However my family is homophobic and I don’t know what to do. I have four years until I can leave and I don’t think I can not be myself that long. I just don’t know what to do and need help.
I go to eat chocolate.\n\nLook in place.\n\nChocolate not there.\n\nRemember ate yesterday.\n\nMe and Myself are still coming to terms with loss,\nbut I love Me and Myself will forgive with time.\n\nWe both love chocolate, but must remember next time.
I love how you took a slightly questionable tweet you made, apologized, and turned it into a teaching moment! ❤️ Love you, Hannah! This video is soooo important. Thank you. 👏And thanks Katie!
Neurotypical was used by autistic people to refer to people who were non-autistic, but I have recently seen people who have other uncommon neurological conditions using the term, generally referring to those who not only aren't autistic but who are not neurodiverse in general.
Thank you for this video Hannah! I was there for all the kerfuffle over that tweet and I was torn between which side to be on. This video does a fantastic job of explaining your feelings and I gotta say you're completely right.
This is the greatest video you have ever made.
Hannah, you always put out videos when I need them most. I have always struggled with self loathing and I am trying to change that way of thinking and its really hard...do you have an tips?
Brene brown's book the gifts of imperfection has been helpful to me. She says you can only love someone as much as you love yourself. You can only accept someone's imperfections as much as you accept and allow your own
I'm so basic I shoulda been named Norm
You are so true!
What a great video💖💖Thanks for your advices Hannah,you're the best
I am constantly saying that you cannot expect others to make you happy, that it is something you have to do for yourself, and self love is a big part of that. Any love and happiness you gain from others should be a bonus, not an expectation. I also battle my own mind every day, and PMS makes it far worse (so fun when I forget to check my calendar), so this is definitely a struggle for me, but also something I try to be an example of, as much as I can, for my kids.
Sooo... Well thanks for mentioning this subject about Neurotypicals... I'm a psychologist who works with people in the Autism's Espectrum. They think I'm a NT but I don't. 😅😅 It's difficult to understand and this isn't the way to exchange information, but you were so correct, respectful and polite... Thanks. 👍🏻
Thank you. I needed this right now.
I really love this video because it talks about what I’m going through and it helped me to realize and learn what I may be feeling or experiencing. So thank you both! 💕 This is a really good topic to talk about.
I love this so much! Thank you for posting this
love is important, and this is a serious video, thank you hannah for bringing  up such an important topic.
What if we find ourselves in a relationship like this? I think both me and my gf have self love problems, and I think I'm the type that Hannah described. I go into the relationship giving and giving so I can feel fulfilled, but my girlfriend is more how Kati described it. She doesn't love herself so she's in the relationship to feel loved by me. Basically, I've found myself in a situation where I'm giving and giving so I can feel fulfilled, but she seems to just take and take and not give much back. I don't know what to do, because I honestly love her, and I love who she is, and alot of the time when we're together I have alot of fun with her. It's more like she's this amazing friend that I cherish so much, but she's a bit of a selfish lover. I don't know if that's because of her own self love issues, but I really need some advice.
What is love to you?
I despise how frequently you are forced to feel bad for speaking your thoughts and opinions. :(
i had no idea u filmed together until i got home and saw the notifications of both of ur channels, made my day
absolutely love every time you guys collaborate!!
that cat is so adorable...
Is it just me or does she talk similiarly to Lili Reinheart?
Go Hanna! I know you were nervous about this vid but I think it went awesome 👏
My mom walked past and asked me if you were Miley Cyrus, Hannah. XD
I'm like i wanna make others feel loved and put them first. It's hard to learn how to love myself. But I am working on it. 😊
I self love myself at least once a day, usually in the morning before a shower. I usually try to love the one I m with and since I am usually alone. I love myself. \nSorry YES you need to not love but at least like the person you are or who you think you are. If you cant be happy or satisfied with who you are as a person yourself then you really cant love someone like that person should be and you really cant accept other people. Yes a true relationship is give and take and true love is when you will do anything for that person. \n\nnever mind I am not one for giving advice. \n\nSemper Fi
It's a constant struggle, and often we word things wrong without realizing how others will take it! It's never your intention to offend, Hannah and I think it's really sweet that when you make a mistake you apologize afterwards (even if it's not necessary) ❤ love your videos! Makes me happy when I watch them!
Great video. It's actually super easy to love other people if you don't love yourself, but it's almost impossible to be in a healthy relationship if you don't. Important distinction that I'm glad was made.
Thank you Hannah & Kati. I needed this today.
This was really uplifting video and it helps people like me that struggle with self-love and self care to remember what I can do to love myself and others
Kati's making the rounds on YouTube! She's everywhere! And yes, that's a good thing.
OMG I LOVE KATI MORTON! GREATEST COLLAB!
❤️
This!! THIS!!! Wowie!!
4:06-4:24 favorite part 😌
I love kati!!
..what is your cat? O.o
You said something wonderful sistas :)
sorry, no malice intended but good Lord.... blah blah....
my two fav youtube people!!!!!!!
Look at these beauties
Really liked this video. Thank you for continuing to put out good, informative messages into the world. I hate that you were nervous to post this. People can disagree but they shouldn’t do so in a hateful manner and if they do, well, it’s best to try and ignore it because it’s not coming from a constructive or healthy place. There will always be people disagreeing with everything.
The thousand likes on this video compared to the 11 dislikes are supporting you and encouraging you, Hannah. Don't let the trolls get you down!

Read this message from the top to the bottom. Even people that have sold their soul to the devil can get the contract broken by JESUS CHRIST. Even if you didn't, JESUS CHRIST loves you and HE wants you to become a Born-Again Christian for it is the only way to Heaven. To become a Born-Again Christian, you pray to JESUS CHRIST, apologize for being a sinner, ask HIM to forgive you, and follow HIS teachings of the New Testament and the Ten Commandments. Even people that have gotten microchiped have to get them removed as soon as possible,( even if you have to remove it yourself)

Hey #VIPs & #NotificationSquad!! So, I'm gonna be honest.. I still can't get over the fact that I accidentally created a pencil with *eight* sides instead of six. 🙈😳 But, mistakes happen and that's all a part of learning! 😊 So, to help me feel like I'm NOT alone, share your own cake horror stories with me BELOW! 👇👇👇
hey Yolanda, do you know Yolanda is a name of big storm that struck Philippines and that storm had earthquakes, hard rain and is the strongest storm which struck Philippines.

@how to cake it , I have tried Italian meringue buttercream 3 times and I don’t know what is going wrong! It’s beautiful white fluff before I add the butter in, I made sure everything is room temp I beat the sugar water mix and egg whites for about 15 min until the bowl was cool and yet it still turns to soup 😩😩😩😩
I've just recently gotten into baking, but my worst fail was trying to make raspberry buttercream last year. I still don't know what I did wrong but it was so runny. I had to work quickly and keep the cake almost frozen so it wouldn't slide off. But, it tasted delicious. Dark chocolate cake with raspberry compote in the center and raspberry buttercream icing.
I loved this cake! pencils should have 8 sides!! Especially the gold part looked so real!
A coconut cake with a flag in it
I watched all your videos and liked all of them. But i honestly didn’t like this one. That’s so not like you.. the tip of the pencil is so not well done, that’s not how a pencil tip looks like... while watching the video, i expected you would put both fondant on top of each other and then cut the waves so that they will be perfectly aligned, also the black part ... eh, well!! I’m just saying this because I’m so used to the perfection in your videos...

The video was still amazing despite the eight-sided pencil. In fact, I thought it was a display of greater skill to make a cake with eight sides. Also, don't worry. I was once asked to make a cake for a ground braking event for a church in my area. I had decided to create a cake that was in the shape of the new building they were putting up and even had a detailed sketch that described how to make it. This was a year or two ago, before I discovered your wonderful tutorials, and I wasn't very skilled at creating cakes. I had bought about 10 boxes of cake mix that I baked, cooled, and started to stack with store bought icing. It was a disaster! The morning of, I was still making this cake. The different colors of cake mixes were all in a jumbled mess. Hardly even stacked. I decided I would take it anyway for I had agreed to make it and couldn't back out now. The cake, in its 3ft by 4ft messy glory, and I arrived. I really couldn't bare to look at it so I just sat it down in the dessert section and left it. While trying to be anywhere but where my cake was, I wondered over to the other side of the dessert section and low and behold, there was the exact cake I had wished to create for the event only smaller and made by some other lady. It was perfect. Straight sides, nice frosting, and a beautiful little roof to match. I did find out later that the lady had used rice crispy, but that is beside the point. She had made this wonderful cake and I had made a large mound of cake and frosting. I went back to my seat and tried to forget about it. Later on, I came back to my cake to see if it had sparked any interest. Turns out that people took the term ground breaking literally and thought of my cake as the actual ground breaking part. You know, the actual digging of shovels into dirt and pulling up soil. Despite this, they thought it was reallly good and were eating a good deal of it. This was not really what I was really going for but it worked. This all goes to show that we all make mistakes and that in the end they can still be great. Making a pencil cake with eight sides instead of six is nothing compared to serving a mound of cake for a public event so don't beat yourself up about it. Your cake was amazing regardless of the sides and I'd pay for a slice. Thank you for all your awesome videos, they truly make me laugh. \nP.S.-Maybe in the future you could make a giant pumpkin cake filled with delicious pumpkin and other fall flavors! You're the best, thank ya for your amazing cake tutorial!😄

O Brasil se entristece com essa perda. Mais um rockeiro amado por todos q se vai. Os  céus se alegram com sua chegada, Tom. Aqui sentiremos sua falta.   : (
Two words.. The Best...................
No one over 30 yrs of age can't say that a piece of them didn't die with Tom Petty. He created America's soundtrack.
RIP to one of the greatest musicians ever!
American Girl seems, to me, in the spirit of The Byrds.  He was great at adopting a style for just one song e.g. you'd be forgiven for thinking that Learning to Fly is a George Harrison-penned song, a big friend, icon of a man let alone as a personality and performer, who also liked 50s music, and fellow Travelling Wilbury of course.
Thanks for the history of rock and roll
I m going to miss him.
I've listened to Tom Petty sing since I was 18 years old; I'm 59 now. I'm saddened to know the rest of my journey on this earth will be without him ... but I still have all of his previous cds to listen to along the way. He made my life - and this world - more beautiful and bearable with his immense talents. Thank you for sharing your gifts with us all. Rest in Peace. You earned it. <3
*IVO`s MAGIC WORLD* presents *MUSIC HISTORY GUIDE -  FAMOUS DEATHS* - *HOMAGE to TOM PETTY* - *R.I.P., DEAR TOM!!! (OcToBeR 2nd, 2017)*
Godspeed man- You were well loved!
Who are the mindless, shallow dickheads that gave this a thumbs down? Really?
Just saw him in Boston. Didn't sound any different then 20 30 years ago. Amazing! You will be deeply missed
one of the best sad to see him leave us so soon great   spirit love  his music
Your music got me through some really tough times Mr. Petty. Albums like Full Moon Fever, Into The Great Wide Open, Wildflowers, Echo, your earlier music and of course the albums you made with The Traveling Wilburys. I could always count on you just like an old friend. I'm going to be sad for a while, but who knows? Maybe I'll get to see you again at the Great Rock 'N Roll Concert in The Sky.
sorry all I think about is it puts the lotion in the basket
R.I.P. and thanx for all!!!
Good by tommy you hearts❤
farewell big friend, see you in heaven
I think he looked worse at that time (2002) than the later videos I have seen.
Tom Petty.........one of the greatest artists.  He left us so many gifts and treasures in his music. A story teller with a  brilliant way to tell them.  His music will be enjoyed forever. 💔
Tom was the man. Quick tribute to him https://youtu.be/URvULdzvdmU
Words can't describe his talent and PASSION for what he loved.  A great legend will be missed. Thanks for all the songs that we can always listen to. Thinking of his family also.
Agradeço de coração o trabalho realizado por Tom Petty nos final dos anos 80 com a banda The Traveling Wilburys. Suas músicas ficarão eternamente em meu coração. Que o Pai Celestial receba sua alma com muito amor.
Six, six, six the number of the beast.
Dedicated to Patrick MicCarty from Redlands (sorry for the horrible spelling)

Rest in Peace Tom Petty (1950-2017)
Rock and Roll heaven just gained another great one.  We will continue to celebrate you and your wonderful songs and music <3
So many great songs!!  You will be missed!!!
I had tickets to see Tom Petty and the band for a special show next week, I wonder if it will be canceled?
He already looked so aged, and this was fifteen years ago. Somehow his passing makes sense. RIP
Mary Jane's Last Dance \nI hear Crosby, Stills Nash & Young, The Beatles & Dillon Wow!!!

Eight of us travelled 6000 miles (us 2 in an RV) to see Tom Petty and The Heart Breakers at Red Rocks,  May 30th, 2017. Not sure we'd do that for another artist. RIP Tom and TY.
saw him at the Forum in LA, Steve Winwood opened for him. BEST CONCERT EVER!
Tom Petty, my heart is so broken. You will be missed, but never forgotten!! You were the best there ever was and that's for real. \nI just wish he hadn't picked you so soon. \n                       RIP  Tom
Thank You Tom Petty! \nWhat you've left us will rock on in our hearts, in our souls, (& in our ears! ;-)
You really did break our hearts this time :(
Thank you for being the best road trip companion a girl could ever want!  nothing beats rolling down the windows, singing American Girl, open road ahead
Every American boy's dream:\nOh yeah, all right \nTake it easy baby \nMake it last all night \nShe was an American girl\nTom, you were the American Boy for me. RIP my brother
I miss him :( this is just makes me cry💔

I like my girls just like I like my honey; sweet\nA little selfish\nI like my women like I like my money; green\nA little jealous\n‘Cause I’m a beautiful wreck\nA colorful mess, but I’m funny\nOh, I’m a heartbreak vet\nWith a stone-cold neck, yeah, I’m charming\n[Refrain]\nAll the pretty girls in the world\nBut I’m in this space with you\nColored out the line\nI came to find, my fire was fate with you\nHeartache would stay with you\nFly great escapes with you\n[Verse]\nI countdown to the clock, saw you awake\nDon’t walk away, or would you wait for me?\nI go out to the bar, f*ck hangin’ with the stars\nDon’t even have a car, but you would wait for me\n\n[Refrain]\nAll, all, all, all the pretty girls in the world\nAll the pretty girls in the world\nBut I’m in this space with you\nColored out the line\nI came to find, my fire was fate with you\nMy heartache would stay with you\nEscape with you\n[Chorus]\nI like my girls just like I like my honey; sweet\nA little selfish, huh\nI like my women like I like my money; green\nA little jealous\nOh, I’m a beautiful wreck\nA colorful mess, but I’m funny\nOh, I’m a heartbreak vet\nWith a stone-cold neck, I’m so charming, oh, oh\n[Bridge]\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nDo-do-do do-do\nDo-do-do do-do\nDo-do-do do-do\nDa-da-da da-da\nDo-do-do do-do\n[Outro]\nIs it love all we need?

Come back to Arsenal Cesc, a lot of us miss you
Barcelona Reject... TWICE!! 😂😂😂
LEGEND
lol, imagine if there was a twist in this story and we found out it was actually van Persie who not only managed to frame Fabregas for throwing the pizza, but also went on to play under the man he threw it at
What a fucking legend!
Only a la masia graduate can deliver a threaded pass with a slice of pizza. The true playmaker!
For all those triggered Arsenal fans, it’s just a joke. Relax 😂
To those who were bashing on Fabregas, He said he didn't mean to throw it to SAF.The situation was so intense back then in the tunnel.He saw both team players were fighting, He went back from the locker room and decided to join the party by throwing a goddamn pizza.But instead the pizza landed on SAF ,He did apologize to him though. Good guy SAF is still covering Fabregas's ass till this day.\nREPLY
wtf
bring him home
😂😂😂
This guy has no class whatsoever.
😂😂
I'm an Arsenal fan.. But I can't find anything funny to cheer febregas like that for what he has done.. Dude do u think throwing a pizza to a respectable manager in the premier league is pretty cool??  U should ask for apologies not admitting ur fault with this joyful face!!
fuck fabregas dat disrespectful bitch.
Fooking wanker!
your speech is sounding and flowing so much better!! i’m glad you’ve recovered so well!
She has started referring to herself as We. Not sure if it was directly from the surgery because i don't think she was doing that until the last few videos
I'm so glad I live in the UK where all our health care is free.
Ugh, on top of her dad's surgery and his treatment and then a funeral?? My heart just dropped. sending so much love to this girl and her family
This makes me want to cry I had medical expenses this summer 25k for everything in three months I think as Americans we should be able to do better this is so sad
Absolutely crazy, here in the U.K. everything you paid for would be free
Yes it's ridiculously expensive, but my god it was worth it wasn't it, because we have you and you're healthy and loved by so many!
If it threatens your life it should be free anything else I can understand paying but if it's life or death it should be free I'd hate to think the amount of people who died to avoid all the debt..
The American health care system breaks my heart. I'm from Australia and a medical student and feel so blessed to have free medical treatment.
I am lucky enough to live in the UK, where everything is free. Everything !!!! \nI actually had brainstem tumour surgery 4 years ago, and actually used private medical insurance to have my op exactly when I wanted it, not waiting till I was an emergency with the NHS system. My entire op, physiotherapist sessions, speech therapist, MRIs and surgery team, drugs and private ward stay came to about £25k ($32k). We were shocked how cheap my brain surgeon himself was. One of the best in the UK, and the only person brave enough to tackle my tumour. He charged just £2,500. That was for 7 hours of nerve racking, life changing skills !!! \nI think there is seriously something wrong with the US system. And sadly I think our NHS is not going to be sustainable for the future, as when you are in hospital now, it seems the rest of the world are in there, taking advantage of our generous system. Who can blame them. \nIn fact if you'd had to have your op here Courtney if you'd been even just been on vacation, the chance are you also wouldn't have been charged a thing for everything. It's mind blowing ! \nLook forward to see you continue to adapt to your new normal and go from strength to strength 😘
Wow! Your speech sounds so much better! You can definitely tell that you have been working hard at speech therapy!
If we all donated $1 we could easily cover her expenses and more!
Thank christ I live in the UK and it would be free.
It’s also paying for all of the surgery team’s salary. But it is outrageous that there is not a lot of help. Praying for you. ❤️
I'm guessing you have insurance? Just think of the people who don't have insurance
Omg, didn't the insurance cover anything?!?!
I have never been so grateful to live in a country that provides a free health service. Donated and shared- what an inspirational lady you are!
You are back to normal with your speach!!!
Wish I could help but I’m poor
USA is insane, everything costs so so much. In sweden we don't even  pay 30 dollars for surgeries or healthcare. Medicine can cost more but not compared to the US. \nIts crazy!! But as long as you feeling better its worth every penny!
Thats so crazy..😱😱😱 Where I live we have public health care and you would have to pay only about 34€/day spent in hospital no matter what they do.
OMG... How can they make you pay that much!!  I'm very lucky I live in Australia. We don't have to pay.
USA healthcare system is terrible. You would not pay for needed brain surgery or radiation in Australia under Medicare.
im so sorry your healthcare sucks im in Australia and we are lucky to pay any money at all 😣 you should of came here for it
This is so sad, that you have to ask for this help! Being from the U.K. The NHS is free to every person. I can't fathom why you have to pay for healthcare!!! We pay our taxes, but wether you pay taxes or you are unemployed..... the NHS is free to all, no matter the trauma. Us brits don't know how lucky we are, we don't have the worry when it comes to our health!!! \nYou take care and hope you raise lots and lots xxxxx
To all of the people saying, How does America do this? I don't understand; who can pay that It's just like that here... it's kind of a gimmick because nobody expects you to pay that; instead they loop you in on payments with interest so that their income is secure... pretty genius if you ask me, though evil. This is exactly the same price as our education. College system is a joke here.
Girl just my brai surgery and everything I needed for the hospital stay for the week was $176,000 ! That didn't even include my therapy and aftercare. It's insane!  I'm 31 and my life has been turned upside down
The cost of all this is insane.\nBut on a happy note, you said radiation properly!!! I'm so exited for you! You're doing so well!
I'm so glad you made this. It's SO ridiculous that this kind of thing is so painfully expensive. For many people, being strapped with these expenses is life destroying; you were saved from the cancer/tumor only to be killed with debt. This is RIDICULOUS, and we need to do something about it. \nI wish you all the best and look forward to watching your continued recovery. You're a delight to watch, and your brightness despite adversity makes me feel like I can make it through my troubles too.
You're doing so well with your speech!! You've made so much progress!!! You can say radiation really well and I can really tell that your speech has improved!!! You're such an amazing woman and you're doing so well!!! You're Such an inspiration to be strong and keep pushing through life!! Simply incredible!!!
Courtney I wish I had enough money to pay it all off for you with everything you have been through but for sure I will go & donate what I can..take care hun!
I had brain surgery last November and my insurance was billed 165,000!! Thank god for insurance I only ended up paying 4,000-5,000 of that bill. Being chronically ill is expensive :( I hope you are starting to feel better. <3
Fuck America. More money spent on wars. Glad to be in Australia
America has third world mentality. I am lucky enough to live in Canada, but I hope the USA can get into the first world soon.
You did so well reading those numbers! Congratulations on your amazing progress! I am constantly praying for you ❤
if this aint reason enough to move to canada.....
Danggg so expensive..but glad ur doing well!!!!
I work in medical billing and this is a normal bill - not great news for the patient but the doctors and medical professionals have to go to school for so long and carry so much malpractice insurance that they do require a decent salary. I hope that someday health care insurance changes and we can all have a right to it, but for now it is just BIG business.
Omg I am mortified at the cost of this treatment and it makes me more greatfull to have the NHS here in the U K thank you for letting us know the costs I did get a reality check I hope your doing ok xx
this is crazy to me, living in the uk, money and healthcare are so disconnected for your average joe. We receive free health care here, I’ve never been so grateful for it.
Your speech is soooo much better!!! 😱💕
Get her on Ellen so she can pay it all for her . I wish I could donate but I'm too young for a bank account yet 😩
This makes me extremely grateful for having our free NHS system after watching this 😢
This country is a sickening joke. I hope you get your bills taken care of <3
Wow, I can't believe that?! That is god awful. Just to let you know, you are my sole inspiration, I love you. \n// Side note; Oh my word...this treatment [or any tbf] if free of charge to any patient in the UK, woah.
That's crazy 🙁
and thats also a lot for a brain surgeon to make too lol
I had to have two liver transplants which cost just over 1 million dollars. So crazy. My dad said that if we didn't have insurance we would be homeless right now. So sad that life saving procedures cost so much.
Wow, here in Scotland everything is free. All medical costs. All education
Thank goodness for the NHS. Anyone from England ?
Your recovery is just impressive ! I wouldn't have guessed you had a brain surgery so not long ago ! You are such a strong and inspiring woman, I'm not used to letting comments but I think you really deserve to know how powerful you are. I think you should really be proud of you ! \nA French viewer :)
That’s so crazy! My back surgery cost $365,000 but then my insurance covered all but $15,000 of it. \nI am so glad that you were able to get the surgery done. I wish that you didn’t have to pay for any of this. It isn’t your fault that you had a brain tumor!!
My elbow surgery would've been about $30,000. But insurance had me pay $2500.
it would be amazing if she'd worked with any brands in the past if they could make a donation?
I'm thankful for the spanish social security. This is CRAZY
I couldn’t imagine how expensive my medical bill would be. I had to go to multiple drs appointments, specialists, MRIs, CT scans, my liver surgery, 3 more tube surgeries, hospital stays, X-rays, ER visits and ambulance rides. I was told it’d be around half a million if not more. I’m beyond thankful I am in the army and didn’t have to pay for any of it. I will definitely help you with what I can. Hope you keep getting better
This is unbelievable. If this exact scenario happened to me in Australia I wouldn’t have to pay for of it... My pop is on kidney dialysis, free. My nan just had a knee replacement, free. Treatment for Leukaemia? Free. \nI’m so confused America what are you doing
come to canada.
Hi sweetie  I'm so sad you live in America cause if you were here I. Australia you probably wouldn't have to pay a cent. You are such a beautiful special girl and I'm happy to hear your doing a gofundme   I'm heading over there right now to donate cause you are sooooooo awesome. You should also put ads on your videos   We will all click them so you can get cash faster 😂 love you girly  huggggs from #niki 🤗❤️🤗
Oh wow that is so scary in the UK we wouldn't have to pay for any of that! Just comes off out taxes
So thankfull that i live in Switzerland 🤘🙌 with a good health care system
your speech is PERFECT
So glad I live in the UK where health care is free
Your speech is getting better! Stay positive girl! 💕
It is unbelievable how the health care system in the US is working. Here in Germany EVERYONE has to have a health insurance. And they pay almost EVERYTHING for you.
What is up with the healthcare system in America? It's unbelievable! I feel so fortunate to live in the UK where we have the NHS. I hope you raise the funds you need hun. If I'm ever in a position to donate money I will definitely think of you x
how does it work in USA? for example i live in South Africa, we join and pay a medical aid company, you can choose a specific plan that suits your finances, however when you go into hospital for a surgery etc, if you havea hospital cover you do not have to pay for anything that is carried out in hospital. For example when i had my babies my C sections and total was about R30 000 (about $3000) which we never had to pay for. Do you have to pay monthly in the US? I know you talk about insurance but is that like medical aid cover?
That's scary how expensive it is. America definitely needs to change their health care system :(
Omg it's Soo expensive but it's worth  this is only way for you to live.. Am always impressive by your attitude .. thank you.. god bless
Thank God I live in Canada. I'm sorry your medical system is so screwed up. No one should have to pay that type of money for a surgery/treatment that they need to stay alive.
Wow I feel lucky we have the NHS and don't have to worry about costs ect.. should be the same everywhere x
Crazy, im British and this would have cost £0. The only thing you pay for is parking at the hospital.
in belgium chimo is free to all
Are you trying to raise the full cost on your go fund me page ...or did you have health insurance to cover it?
British people, we’re so lucky to have the NHS!!!
This is what I really hate about America. Here in Italy it would have been free
YOUR SPEECH IS GETTING SO MUCH BETTER LOVE!!
omg I didn't know radiation was that expensive...I moved to australia and am doing radiation right now and will be done on monday (35 treatments total) America's healthcare system is a mess...
That is so expensive what the hell!! 😪
Reminds me if when my ex got sick and racked up about that much. Insurance reduced it to $4250. We ended up paying about $1000 of that after talking with the hospital. Now after telling my story I'm just going to say your really pretty and your freckles are awesome.
Oh. My. God. The United States medical care is so backwards. In Canada, all this treatment would be free of charge with the exception of prescriptions, which are usually reduced by 80% with most insurance programs. You also might have to pay for parking at the hospital... I'm so sorry you're incurring these costs, as if being diagnosed with brain cancer wasn't enough. Just awful.
i don't want to scare you or anything but it's better to be prepared right? cancer can or MIGHT come back ya know so maybe transfer to another country with better healthcare system or something IDK.. i guess what i'm really trying to say is to make a plan about financial stuff to prepare yourself in case... anyway i'm glad you seem to be doing great! 👊^-^
I have pretty good insurance thanks to my dad but after 2 emergency rooms visits ( I had to go a second time because they sent me home when I shoud’ve been admitted the first time) and I was diagnosed with a kidney disease called mgn and needed a kidney biopsy. I go to a nephrologist now and have to take chemo pills and prednisone as my treatment. After the bills started rolling in the total cost for everything was over $20,000 but after insurance I only have to pay a little over $4,000. But how is a college student expected to pay for that? It’s insane!
Here in Australia you wouldn't have had to pay 1cent towards it. I can't believe that on top of having to deal with having cancer and surgery you have to also worry about how you're going to pay for it all. My heart breaks for you.
You can file for medical bankrupty. Healthcare here sucks
Insurance company should cover all of it 😔 it’s not her fault she got cancer, why should she have to pay for all of this? It’s pretty bad you have to pay to keep yourself alive.
So brave! I hope everyone donates! Amazing!:)
Ridiculous.
Courtney may i ask you a question do you have a boyfriend
OMG!!!!! I had my brain surgery 2012 followed by radiation and chemo. Thankfully I am from the UK (Scotland) and we have the NHS ( National Health Service) so it cost me nothing. \nWith everything else you need to worry about the last thing you should have to worry about is how you are going to pay life saving treatment. \nStay strong X x
Why don't you make a go find me page ? I am willing to donate you and help you out and I am sure I am not alone :) ! Please ,like my comment so she can see it .
I am SOOOOOOO GLAD A I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA ....my mum had cancer twice and had aggressive treatment and it cost her NOTHING ....no insurance either .....we have medicare here and we pay nothing .... I live in the lucky country for sure
I'm from canada and I wish people up here would stop complaining that our health care system sucks because they have no idea how lucky we are we don't have to see those types of numbers when we have surgery if any numbers at all. I'm so sorry Court. I would donate if I could, I'm a student currently and having to borrow money from my mom and friends. Much love always
This would've all been free where I'm from (EU). I'm giving birth in a month, won't pay a dime. Of course it's not literally free, we pay taxes so everyone can have access to healthcare. Gladly. The US system is sick.
Is this in US dollars?
Hey Ms. Warner it's dayshaun we all miss  your might head still love you dramatic self
I think it is shocking to see how many people in America struggle to afford even the most basic health care. Luckily, where I am from, healthcare is universal
The american health care system is disgusting. How can you suck money out of dying people. If you don't have the money will they just let you die in from of the hospital or what ?
So if you're sick and poor you're gonna die?
Darling girl, I so wish things were the same for you as they are for me in Canada. Once you are through with kicking cancer's ass I hope you are a strong voice and advocate for a decent public healthcare system in America! I have heard horror stories about Americans having to choose to die simply because they could not afford to live. It's horrible. So horrible. We will see you through and then we will work towards seeing everyone else through as well. I love you and keep staying strong.

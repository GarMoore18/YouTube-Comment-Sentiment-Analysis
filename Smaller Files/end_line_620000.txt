I think they should host one of the games here in Houston Texas
I hope tekker town win
I was there

When harry threw the ball to the keeper isn’t that a pass back?
No sound...
2018 Barcelona fc vs hashtag united
Tekkers kid went to this
They speld Baker wrong
Gerrard ❤
Stuart Pearce losing a game as a manager? Where have we seen this before...
What's the song called  when the commentary said that ksi intressed
Tekkers was so op but still got destroyed
If billy was on for Cutting, Tekkers prolly could have won or tied
Gerrard is the man of the match
Hope ksi don't make a disstrac about tekkers city
This is unfair: you take a team that has already play a lot of games togheter and that is really fit and then a team that has never played togheter and are really unfit and then play against each other. of course the fit team is going to win and if you think that legends will help then no ok some of them were fit still but many of them were not so the legends will also not really help. Plus you obviously need a professional coach and do some training because everyone got tackled who ever got the ball and when some one was open no one else opened up so it was very hard to pass it is just un fair it is the same as real madrid and tekkers town played togheter un fair also the others from hashtag who were off camera during the challenges were obviously training togheter
Why does lynch never use his skill
Hashtag only won because billy was injured
commentary was on another level! hope you guys do it also next year! thanks for the laughs! oh, and the game was ok too
It is boring when spencer fc/hashtag united always win like if you agree😊😊😊
Anyone can tell me the score so I don’t have to watch the whole thing
Hi everyone can you check out my little boys football channel if you like subscribe thank you
Did joe Weller come on?
kieran brown really bad on the pitch should stay with his tricks and freestyle
I mean gerrard
Crawford sucks
Hashtag united sucks
Heskey time
chrismd :/
Gerrard never nasty...just stamped on Herrera that one time after being on the pitch for 1 min ;)
does anybody else get annoyed by geordie sometimes? something about him idek.
David James just isn't a legend, always been shot and still is now hahaha
Crappy defensive side for tekkers. Absolutely no chemistry and fitness for tekkers. This isn’t right 😡😡😡
why cant the amazing freestylers like daniel cutting and sian garnier and jezza just dribble through the whole team and score like they do in their videos
+F2Freestylers - Ultimate Soccer so funny when there was a pen for jezza and he was so serious when he scored but then he was like, this is just my job
Please do a Highlights video like last year.
david JAMES as they call him in spain lmao lawrence u dumbass lol haha funny mfkrs
Just finished highschool but already makes more money then you
If tekkers town had a single legend in defence this game would've been very different.
Geordie looking smart once a year for the wembley cup. 😊
without a doubt the commentary made this
Came and stayed for the commentary
I think Elliot let Team Tekkers down the whole game.
I went to the Match
As much as I'd like it to be true, William Gallas never won a World Cup.
country music these days is awful , I enjoy Billy currington  ,but I don't care about the others. our 1990s n 1980s music will not be played again unless there's a station that just plays the older music . it's too bad too, it took away a lot of good music!!!! if we have CDs of our favorites, then we can listen to them . but I think there should be a good amount of the older country played. the 1980s& 1990s really had a lot of good country. music worth listening to.!!.
Yo, I haven't exactly payed the attention i should've. Can anyone tell me why Billy ain't playing?
How much did Spencer pay the F2???
My Bad 14.34
Yes hashtag
There both Sunday leeeeagueee
Houst, Tx
I miss this!!!! Noo
Hashtag should sign jeremy lynch and billy wingrove
Wingrove?
Theo Barker hahehe lol
Did
Spencer FC
Man True Geordie and Lawrence are to much!!😂😂😂
OMG HESKEY AND KSI ON THE SAME TEAM XD HESKEY HATES KSI THOUGH
Anyone know the song that was played when they scored
What's the goal song called?
Who saw Jimmy Conrad pointing where jeremy was going when he was taking the penalty
I love spencer fc like if you agree
I focking love how k.s.i is in the same team as husky long time fans will get it hilarious.
Linesman should go in the kitchen and make me a meal
F**k this game
Pollock is quality
Aids :/
slaughter
Theo Barker??
Tekers guru
It’s always hashtag
Wingrove?
Announcers only ##################
*theo barker 😂

How beautiful to see Sharon and Charles interacting.  Thank you for this intimate glimpse into her world.
Yes! Sharon and Charles together!  Miss them both.
Brought a tear to my eye, seeing Sharon and Charles living it up, having a good time, doing what they did best..... RIP Sharon and Charles.
Bosco and the team- Thanks for making and posting this, it's a beautiful tribute. I still can't re-watch the documentary yet, I just miss this woman and her energy. This made me cry like a baby... She will live forever in the music, thanks again, can't wait to hear her final album.
Rest In Power Sharon!
I miss her so much, everyday. Sharon and Charles have left indelible marks on all of us, and the music world. I know that they are jamming up in Heaven with Prince, Tom Petty, DB and so many other musical heroes we have lost. Thank you, Daptone for this incredible video, and for producing real, powerful soul music!
This moved me in so many ways. I'm sad that Sharon and Charles are no longer with us, but their art will outlive us all and for that I am so very grateful.
I'm also writing this message with tears streaming down my face.  Glad to have had the opportunity to see Sharon last September when Miss Sharon Jones was playing in Brooklyn.  I'll always cherish that moment.  So grateful we still have her music and movie!  Great video!
Nothing but Love & Respect for Charles & Sharon R.I.P x
The Queen is back... Forever!
Man, I miss her and Charles.
The best performer I've ever seen. Still can't believe she's gone. What a beautiful song.
Maravilhosa!❤😘 I love her!
A beautiful tribute!
I love this! What a great voice!
Sharon and Charles were taken from us much to early. Timeless soul music great performers.\nThey are missed
One of the most beautiful souls ever to grace a stage. Wherever you are Sharon, we love you; we miss you.
I'm feelin' this song
What an amazing tribute to Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. My heart breaks for the entire band-they lost a sister in soul, and quite frankly lost their livelihood. One only has to read about the trials and tribulations the band went through when Sharon fought cancer the first time to realize if they don't tour, they make no money. Thanks to everyone downloading music or using these free services, there is precious little money in recording music and selling it.\nDo the band a favor, do Daptones records a favor, and buy 10 copies of this CD for your friends and family. There will never be a band quite like SJDK again. Bosch/Gabe, thanks for making this all happen.
Beautiful, what an amazing energy!
Sharon forever you'll stay in our hearts !
This is a lovely tribute. Bravo, Daptone.
I loved her and the great band plays with Amy too. This clip it's a dream...
I'm not scared to grow old now
Even in her last days, she still full of energy. Definitely one of the best that the world ever seen
more than music Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley .... Never Forget
Not one dislike. As it should be.
I miss her every day. Thank you Daptone!
Chilling to see both Sharon and Charles together.
Thanks, Daptone!  Love and miss you, Sharon and Charles.
Sounds great!  Can't wait for it to be released!  Wow...in seeing Charles Bradley in this video.  RIP to them both!!
Rip
True Gem!
Forever Legends RIP † @2:21
Miss her.
Beautiful
Loved it!
💙
Only time I got a record signed and a kiss smack on the lips to go with it! Miss you Sharon, rest well.
oh yeah! love and miss Sharon
fabulous!!
I STILL get goosebumps every time I hear you guys sing Crazier Than You! <3
The chemistry between you and Oliver is insane. Whether you may be together or not, you're definitely friendship goals and I envy it so much
Oliver: *cheeky assgrab at 9:14 *\nMe: *chokes on air*
does anyone not have a crush on oliver
Carrie, I got to meet you last week and I didn't get a word out of my mouth because I was so starstruck and nervous🙈  But I managed to put all my thoughts on you into words on my vlog of that day, so I would love love love you to see it! 💕 Also, Scott and Oliver take over my vlog and are absolutely adorable so check that out! 😄🙌🏼
I saw this in Glasgow and god it was amazing live, she is SO talented and I actually didn't know it was her at the time but I watch her video Fleming and I love her so much, realising I was really near her is amazing. Bravo, she was the most talented singer there in my opinion <3
100% confused if she's with pete or Oliver
Just got my letter back from you, thank you carrie💖💖
Hey Carrie! I love you and your videos sooo much, you're a huge inspiration! My middle school just finished the production of the Addams family young@part, in which I played the 50s ancestor. I love you sooooo much!
Just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the show this evening. My husband and I came to watch it in Glasgow. You were absolutely fantastic!! You're voice blew us away. Great job, I'll be recommending it to friends and family 😊
Can you do a video with mortitia I love your videos and it means a lot for you to make them I belive having a chanel has a big impact on your life i have just started a performing arts group and I would love some tips plus I just think you are amazing I hope you take this message into consideration because I guess you have a lot of people saying this stuff to you but I door belive it would mean so much to me thank you so much Joe xx
Watched Adams family last night at the kings thearter ! ,😀😍❤
Wait. Carrie. Why did you change ure name. It was perfect
Saw you in belfast, you all were insanely good!!\nThank you for an amazing show 💙💙
Will they be realising a soundtrack for the Addams family, I would pay so much to get that
HEARING YOU SING ONE NORMAL NIGHT AGAIN MADE ME CRY
Carrie, I'm not commenting on this video to tell you how good it is or that you and Oliver would be an awesome couple. I'm commenting to tell you just how awesome you are as a person, please never change even if people tell you to. Xxx
Are her and Oliver dating???!!!
Heyy Carrie!! Please please could you and oliver record a version of 'crazier than you' im obssessed with the song but noone else sings it as well as you guys! Xxxxx
There's a Catan app???
Olly, you need one of the Newt Hufflepuff scarves from Fantastic Beasts. They sell them and they are much more subtle.
MORE SCOTT!!! Miss seeing his beautiful face xxx!
Hi I'm coming to see the show in a few weeks time yay
Great video! Do you happen to have a business contact email?
Does anyone know if there are going to be any more tour dates after the Singapore trip? My sister and I wanna come see the show but we have to fly in from Holland so have to plan it because of school and vacations
My boyfriend and I had one of our first dates in that very Maggie Mays ❤️
My sister did the same thing with my birthday present. I was planning to buy some shampoo/conditioner the week before (luckily i didn't) and she got me the EXACT TWO I wanted (I love Juicy and American Cream)... even though they weren't the same as the ones i just finished. Love it when that happens :)\n\nAlso, as ever, love your videos, always put a smile on my face!
Will you guys be doing a cast recording of the show? I just saw a play of it at my college and I loved the show! I would LOVE to have the soundtrack with you in it! 💜
I will be there this Saturday at the Kings Theatre Glasgow and taking my older sister, as a treat because she is an amazing sister.  I can not wait.  Been following you on here Carrie and the time has come to see the show.  Hope you enjoy your time in Glasgow x
I'll be so so sad when tour is over bc I love the Adams family vlogs :(
Saw you in the opening night at the Grand Opera House, you (and everyone else!) were awesome!!! It was my friend's first ever time at the theatre and she really, really enjoyed it :) Had to dash for a train so couldn't wait and stage door to tell you how much I enjoyed it in person, but hopefully I'll see you again in the future and can tell you then!
OMG you and Scott’s rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow is beautiful😄
So weird seeing you in places that are so familiar to me! Loved meeting you Carrie, you were so sweet as always
I saw you perform last night at the Kings theatre it was amazing loved the show , you were all great 💖💖
CAN NOT WAIT!! UR COMING TO ME NEXT WEEK AND IM COMING TO WATCH!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COME TO STAGE DOOR!!
Ok. I know I'm probably way behind the times, but why/when did the channel change names? I could have sworn that there was a (relatively) recent video where she talked about how she WOULDN'T change it because of the significance of the phrase It's way past your bedtime to her life. DID I DREAM THAT? AM I CRAZY?
I seriously think Carrie has the perfect voice. That is to say, if I could be Ursula and steal anyone’s voice it would be hers!💜🖤
Oliver's monkey impression looked more like Zoidberg😂
I actually went to see that in Belfast because we're doing the addams family in november \nP.s. I'm the granny \nP.s.s. I was the guy with the stupid laugh
Absolutely loved seeing you perform! Kinda raging that I didn't bump into you at all seeing as my work is directly next the Opera house.
At the end of the tour, we need a full dance cover of crazier than you!! :D
One Normal Night is one of my fav songs from the Musical and you totally sing it the best ! wish could hear recorded version.
So I watched this with my husband, and when the video ended his response was: Wait we have to wait for the Unicorn!?\nAnd now he is sad that there aren't anymore videos to watch till next week.
Now we all just wanna know what happened to the unicorn
I've just realised that Oliver reminds me of John Barrowman and now I can't unsee it. 😫
Absolutely loved meeting you in Belfast! Hope you liked the summer night fruit tea 💕💕
I need to see the fully grown unicorn. This isn’t fair
Enjoyed this show so so much absolutely incredible!
The real question is, where on earth did that dragonfly necklace come from? it's gorgeous!
But what about the unicorn though? THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!!!
Can anybody find the jumper from Zara she is wearing and link it! Im in love with it! I see you on Friday night and I CANNOT wait!!! xx
why the youtube name change? I loved it :( xx
I saw you LIVE! I was skooked to the core. your voice is seriously amazing. well done!!!
It's the elevation is my new excuse! Hahaha
When she said end of the day ... is it ok if I sang “end of the day another day over” les mis
Hey I was just wondering, how long do these musicals usually run for?
My ticket arrived last week so I’m getting more and more excited now and even have a sticker in my planner for the day 8 come to see the show. Yeah I’m a nerd lol
didn't even think to look for a catan app for my phone! Love the game. might have to go look for it now.
I actually can't cope that you are in Maggie mays like 2 minutes from my flat 🙈 seen you while you were here, me and my best friend had the best night, amazing show
Also your voice is a POWERHOUSE
you were amazing on saturday! love you xo
Ok I've always wanted to know the answer to this: HOW do actors in musicals not CONSTANTLY LOSE THEIR VOICES?!! That's so much constant stress on your voice omg
Anyone else find it hilarious that she was dressed as Wednesday talking about wanting a giant unicorn 😂😂
Scott has me wondering about his range. I had an oh snap moment when he took it up a free octaves.
But what happened with the unicorn??? 🦄🦄🦄
I saw you guys in that theatre Thursday and it was amazing! 10/10
whenever you film onstage and show all the seats it makes me so happy :) you're my inspiration, carrie ♥
I started SNORTING with laughter at 9:16 like OH MY GOD
What is the music for the signing clip?
Are her and Dan still friends??
Are.... are we sure they aren’t dating....?
Although they're in the same family, zebras make different barking sounds than horses do, so it stands to reason that unicorns would make different sounds as well.  Something more lyrical perhaps?
Forget Oliver, I want to see more of the woman with the purple headband @6:40  :D
Maybe it's just me but you seem a bit wicked dressed as Wednesday, the character takes over and nice Carrie is no more.
So nice seeing the inside of my favourite place to work in whilst I'm across the water in Liverpool for Uni.
You where wearing that necklace today as well, very cool!! Where did you get it? And whoop for the Stitch pj!!
Love “watch me, Wednesday” xx😀 now which shop did you get that beautiful green scarf from??
I must admit, after being introduced to the new cast on Sunday night at the London Poladium, I wasn't sure what to think, since watching these vlogs I've found it quite reassuring that you guys are doing a great job at taking the show on!
It's like we're inside a jewelry box! 😍 That is what it looks like!! I've always dreamed of being that little ballerina inside a music box... Carrie, you really were! 💕
so so excited for the addam's family in singapore!!!!
Oh carrie please do a full cover of somewhere over the rainbow that would be lovely
Is the dear Evan Hansen cover (with you and Oliver) ever going to be uploaded? I NEED a full version in my life! 💕
I could watch HOURS of Carrie, Ollie, Scott, and the rest of the cast just having fun and singing their hearts out. I'm always so sad to see the vlogs end. I look forward to them every week and they always make me smile so much. Keep up the great work, Carrie! <3
That unicorn is the biggest cliffhanger...
Love the scarves! :) <3
TRENDINGGG
YOUARESOPRETTYBEAUTIFULFUNNTANDTALENTED AAAAAA
That riff at 5:56 ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So cute
Wonderful 😍
1:32 IM NOT IMPULSIVE (I'd never ask that of you)
Can we please have a unicorn update? xx
All these comments are basically the same thing 😂 least Carrie has everyone's approval if she wants it 😂❤️
I get the feeling that u and Oliver are dating
Are Carrie and Oliver together
EXCUSE ME BUT I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT BUM SQUEEZE
I’ve never met someone else who knew that coaster (or beer mat as you said) flipping trick! So awesome 💕
''its like we're inside a jewellery box!'' that was so adorable :3
anyone know the song at 0:25
cant believe I missed the live where carried opened the presents :(
All that guy could taste was regret...
I thought Rick and Morty fans were supposed to be of higher intelligence? They bee getting scammed
Supremely practical recipe's for winners looking to lose Wight http://bit.ly/2ykskXe
Where did this happen? Phoenix?
how is this trending
Even Sheeps are smarter than this 😐
Is this the Krusty Krab?
LMAO. WHAT A SHAMEFULLY EATEN NUGGET, He looked so depressed with himself for just spending $10 on one dumbass nugget.  Then the regret kicked in when he realized he was being recorded.  😂😂😂😂
*_T O   B E   F A I R ,_*
What's so special about szechuan sauce?
Mc Donald's \nIs soo A typical that this is NOT even funny . this global company literally is making money off this . Quasie attitude you post regardless because they are so stable in the market. It would actually be funny if you just got an outfit an started working there. Ha
Mmm supply and demand working at its finest.....
his face says it all... it aint worth it
THAT FUCKIN NUMALE CUCK TAKING THE MONEY FROM HIS FATHER
If only the guy selling looked more jewish this would be perfect.
A sauce that has been nearly forgotten for 19 years, suddenly blows up in popularity because of one show
Eat from a strangers hands for 10$. Did he wash his hands?
i fucking love how his face shows the worthiness
0:21 why is that the perfect representation of the rick and morty fanbase
Why are People so stupid these days
0:05 you can see how the guy asked for his father to borrow the 10 bucks lmao
I had this sauce before. It was good, but not $10 a pop good. Particularly notable for the sesame sauce aftertaste that lasted hours.
I do not understand how can he sell something inside the macdonalds. Isnt it wrong to sell other things inside another shop
It's no scam, they got exactly what they paid for; what an inspirational merchant.
And people thought MLP & Steven Universe fans were cancer. R&M fans are super AIDs double cancer.
Dumb kid. \nThey were selling for 800 dollars on eBay. \n\nCongratulations on missing out on a fortune.
It's fake 4 guys set this up!
The idiots paying 10 bucks are stupid but that’s actually a good idea to get idiots to pay 10 bucks for it
i blame baby boomers for this shit
This shows the elites the true nature of people. They can watch this and justify there own actions since the first chance this dude got he started exploiting people, reassuring the elites that any of us they are causing suffering would have done just the same if we was in the same position the elites currently are. He had a chance to share valuable limited resources the sauce like people preach for the corrupt people to do but then we dont do it ourself at the first chance we get?
Somebody help me out, is this sauce expensive or rare or what?
This seshuan sauce has been blown way out of proportion
Half expecting Rick to walk in with 100 dollar bills in his hands.
Thank you Rick and Morty you proved our world is fat enough to pay $10 for a bit of sauce and nugget
It's my series arc Morty, 9 seasons morty
This sums up Americans in a chicken nugget.
How is he allowed to do this inside the place where it was sold
Capitalism has gotten out of hand
THE LOOK ON THE NERDS FACE JESUS MAKES ME LAUGH
Rick and Morty fans: we're smart cos we watch Rick and Morty, the rest of you guys are fucking retards cos you don't understand the show\n\nAlso Rick and Morty fans:
The most American thing ive ever watched
-pays 10 usd for a nugget\n-eats it in one go
Please help me I am in great pain.
It wasn’t worth it👎
That guy doesn’t seem impressed
That man is a genius.
What a fucking fool. The look on his face when he's asked if its worth it. Of course  its not fucking  worth it
Don't these guys know anything about hygiene?!
Its a scam a few people In on it and they buy and say its nice so other normal people buy like sheep
Is this in Canada
These rick and morty fans are so fucking cringe smh
you paid a man 10 dollars to dip a nugget in some shite sauce, if i was your dad ill slap the shit out of you and disown you for life.
Why did i watch this 😒
Is this a live action Ed, Edd and Eddy?
Capitalist at its best! 😂😂😂
you can buy szechuan sauce from the chinese down the road from me. they do it with seafood or meat
People in the comments will gladly hand over money for overpriced iPhones, celebrity endorsed makeup, cars, and sneakers etc but think it's dumb to buy a nugget dipped in sauce for ten bucks ......
The world is fucked.
The aspiring entrepreneur seems to touch the money and hold the nugget using the same hand. Not only the idiot will get the chance to taste the sauce for $10, he will also get E coli for free. Great deal!
Think for yourself, don't be sheep
Jimmy neutron in ten years
Stupid niggers. This is why you are poor.
Rick and Morty fans belong in concentration camps
That’s cheap as fuck!!!
He then sold them air for $20
Fair play to the guy hustling these idiots
Good for him. Just like people that pay $1,000 for a phone.
Well, time to stop watching rick and morty and associating myself with the horde of asshats that claim to be fans......
Lol the guy stuffs it in and crosses his arms like yes I'm a badass
:24 That is the face of defeated, beaten man.
What a stupid fucking video.

Mc Jewed
What is szechuan sauce lol
Please meme gods make 0:25 a meme
All these comments hating on Rick and Morty fans saying they can't be as clever as they think they are for spending $10 a nugget.....I argue the dude selling the nuggets is the biggest fan in the room and he's a fucking genius
The only good spider is a dead spider
Largest in mythical creatures video?
Military ideas.\n\n-France vs. UK\n-EU vs. China\n-Saudi Arabia vs. Iran\n-North Korea vs. Japan
Godzilla is a Kaiju not a dinosaur
I've seen wild elephants at Mole National Park, we were fine as long as we kept our distance and didn't scare them
Brings up the 5 series, uses images of the 6 series GC.
Idubbbz forehead....
Calling Godzilla a dino triggered me...
Can't wait for King Kong vs Godzilla
Malaysia is not Indonesia
The blue whale is also the largest creature that has ever lived on Earth
Blue whale is the boss.
Just remember there's always a bigger fish
donald trump is biggest creature in america
Can you do a comparison on tiger vs lion this will be amazing and world's strongest man vs a Gorilla
Where are the Feminist
Ah u forgot Barney he’s much bigger then all these animals
That was a bad pun, spiders are not bugs.
what if bloop really is an animal amd still live today?
You forgot to add the largest reptile
The fact that the Komoto Dragon can run as fast as a healthy human is terrifying.
The weight for the Mini Cooper given comparing it to a blue whale's heart was for an original Mini (1960's to 2000) not the 2000 and later model that is illustrated.  The later ones are about a thousand pounds heavier.
A mini cooper is only 600kg? seems legit
The modern 3rd wave feminist weighs an estimated 1.2million metric tons, it eats an estimated 69 tons of ice cream and cheese sticks every day. Their large fat bodies allow them go last years without food, giving them plenty of time to post shitty pictures of themselves on Tumblr.
Being eaten by a snake would be so horrible, it's so slow.
i dare to press read more\n\n\n\n\nwell i wasted your time haha
My mum is the biggest creature ever
I got bitten by a Komodo dragon in 2016
you know what...titans are coming
A tarantula can live to how long?????
Americans are the fattest creatures that exist right now.
A man eaten by 10 years old .... how pathetic .... !!
Please tell me there is a largest creatures of all time video coming up?
What about the saltwater crocodile? Or the Argentinosarus?
HAH\nDAT PUN\nthis is why i love this channel lol
When you realize a spider can live longer than a snake
Military comparison\nIndonesia and Malaysia
I hav been up close to the golathial bird eating spider once,the whale shark and that's it...or is there more...idk...oh wait the elephant and a ostrich
Ostrich can run up to 60mph?
I wish I could have seen a blue Whale but life doesn't always give u what u want
In the USA, the biggest animal is Donald Trump.😂😂😂😂
I've been  close to a whale shark
What about the anaconda there is reports that some are 60 feet lads
all the fatties are in this video
A 9 meter Sucuri was captured and they leave the animal in his habitat, this was last week in Caçu, Goiás, Brazil.
I ride my Godzilla to work
Anicondas dont get close to 25 feet they get really fat and like 15 feet
where are the country comparison vids???
Why are none of those snakes anacondas
Do Godzilla vs King Kong next i mean obviously Godzilla would win because he’s an extra 200 feet tall and weighs 10 times more.The older films portrayed Kong winnings because he was the same height and weight which wouldn’t work because last year he was 100 feet tall so he grows 50 meet every 40-50 years so Godzilla will be way taller then him still
Loved the video, would have liked to see a human resemblance or size compared thingy :)
Yes I've meant one of these creatures and it was staring at me like a rapist and then tried to bite a persons hand\nIt is the mighty ostrich
What about he biggest land predator? The polar bear BOI
This video was published in 2017, a Mini Cooper now weighs 2600-3000lbs. You meant it weighs 1300 kg.
Africa doesn't have water because of the elephants
Wrong the biggest creature to walk the earth is trumps ego.
I've seen a Blue Whale up close, although it was dead and washed up on the coast. Would have been about 25m long and you could smell its rotting carcass from about a kilometer away. Standing right next to it the stench was so strong that you could taste the air....and it didn't taste nice. Quite a few people made the trek to have a look at it, tho some turned back vomiting from the odour long before getting in sight of the putrefying mammal/fish :)
How about the clock spider?
OK... How do you convert 33 foot into 400 kilo????
Everyone knows Godzilla is totally *REAL* ...
Why isn’t my ex girlfriend featured in this video?
Everybody knows the largest creature in the world is your MOM
Y’all should do mars facts and statistics

Trapped in a snake MIGHT??? Be scarier than an ostrich catching up with your car???
Ummm why did he not but Jake Paul's  balls on there?
You should have included the polar bear, it’s the largest land carnivore and the largest one on record weighed over a ton
The largest toothed carnivore and predator to ever live is the modern sperm whale and the largest invertebrate is the colossal squid which the sperm whale hunts

A moment of silence for the Indonesian guy who got eaten by an anaconda...
I absolutely love watching the videos on this channel while eating a casual meal. Get super stoked whenever there's a new upload. \n\nPlease continue pumping out great content!
ahahhahahahahahahhhahahahaahahahaa 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I'd just surprised that The Infografic show is talking about Indonesia btw like if you are from Indonesia
Ive been up close to a Cappyberra and I love guinea Pigs! Like if you like guinea pigs!
Please use the metric system.\nI don't understand the 'feet' and I don't want to open google to convert feet to meter every time you give a value.
How about having Eddie Bravo on? He trains some top UFC/mma fighters and can promote EBI which is damn exciting for any bjj/mma fans. C'mon Ariel, show Edgy Brah some love.
Please make the into screen longer next time
MMA HOUR get Gegard Mousasi Fighting BELLATOR 185
Tony I went big bear Ferguson..
Tony just rambles on....lol....love that dude though!👊
Uncle Creepy spiraling...
Ariel is so cringe. Stop trying to psychoanalyse the fighters, you say the same thing about the fighters you interview being completely different people nearly every single time. You look for depth where it isn't there.
Can we please not have Ian McCall on the show ever again. Would be great.
Ian mccall wants 100k to fight on the fight pass prelims lol Thats a Lil bit of a reach dawg
Show with sound begins @ 3:58
GooD To SeE HelwanI AnD CucuY BacK TogetheR <3
Ian McCall is such a garbage fighter. He should be happy that UFC let him stay this long.
When you get home from Taco Bell 2:56:54
Ian McCall is transitioning into a woman.
It is what it is
Man Condit is such a good dude very under rated...that Maia fight was a disappointment but I feel Condit still causes problems for anyone would love to see Condit vs Cerrone Condit vs Woodley Condit vs Wonderboy\n\nHope he's well off, dude was doing medical stuff? Sounds like he hated it cant go from fighting in the UFC and being top 5 to work a regular day job. \n\nGet in the gym Carlos everyone knows grappling is your weakness work on it and destroy 170
Tony's been writing a book? What's it called Cat? And then you open the book and there is a picture of a cat and an arrow with the word Cat in bold. Then you turn the page and its another type of cat with an arrow and the word Cat!.  Just 50 pages of that. I'd buy it.
Yes Ariel the pro Mcgreggor fans are very annoying. Good to hear I'm not the only one who can't stand them.
Ian mccall is such a douche im gald he dont fight anymore
BOBBY GREEN. ON THE MMA HOUR ARIEL MAKE IT HAPPEN
Tony is the real champ, Conor is a paper champ !!! Lmao 😂
2:56:54 Excuse me!
slow day lets rattle conor fans... lol
too chinny for Conor
marissamal
Straight up
Tony straight up Ferguson
NBK IS BACK!!!!
Too many politics in this episode. I get it though. But lets not make a habit of it!
Always good to hear from Frankie, also I agree Tony's demeanour seemed much more composed.
does Max have any idea how ridiculous he sounds when he speaks? Saying you know every 4 words makes you sound like a moron. I like Max, he's dope AF, just hard to listen to.
NY Ric better at pronouncing those names than Schaub is.
I thought it was supposed to be RICS PICS not Ariel criticizing every pick from Rick. Rics picks is all I watch cause Ariel is beginning to annoy me.
no audio for first 4 minutes???
Dis, is not a terapy session - Ian McCall's Skype connection.
Ian McCall wants loads of money to fight but can't actually fight cause his hand is jacked LOL
Tony needs to take a chill pill lol
i did that armbar in big bear
Carlos Condit is the man. My fav fighters : Diaz Bros,Condit, Rory, Gegard Mousasi, and for sure DJ, TJ and Rockhold have a very well rounded skillset and a high fight IQ.
wtf no time stamps who dropped the ball
I keep thinking that max holloway is a really cool guy
Sensei Seagull is a fraud! He got choked & pooped himself!
So Ariel thinks the ufc's bantemweight division is the sister division to bellators version ayyt ariel i see you
2:56:54 Was that a cart from Tony?
Ian Mccall is ass
Maybe in the 165lb division...AAAAAYYYYOOOOO!
The mighty wizz bar.. really?
LAS VEGAS WAS A FALSE FLAG
Was that a fart 2:56:54
Tony is gullible if he thinks Dana speaks the truth.
Wtf ian hasnt fought in years nd he wanna get paid more wtf he just need to retire he a nobody lost to dj he doent want it to fight no more he should quit cus he aint top 5 nd he wanna get paid like he a champ no way
Condit is one of my favorite fighters and one of the most entertaining fighters I've ever seen. He's had a rough last few fights (as he said, the Maia loss was so ugly for him, he decided to leave the sport), but I think he's still one of the pound-for-pound best. Over the last half of his career, he's only lost to the best-of-the-best and only by the narrowest of margins. He was injured during the Woodley fight, Lawler was a razor-thin split decision, he avenged his Kampmann loss, and St. Pierre is St. Pierre. One weakness that he has is he doesn't fight takedowns enough. He's so skilled & active off his back, that getting taken down is almost a comfortable position for him. The problem is, even if he's not taking damage on the ground, the judges see it & tend to score against him because of that. Plus, he tends to brawl too much. If he had gotten a few takedowns against Lawler (nobody ever tries to take Robbie down) he would've won that fight and might be the champ right now.
Artem Lobov vs DJ. UFC let's make it happen
Tony vs Conor....Let's go! Hey....hello....hello....Conor? Conor?? where u at? :)))
Conor's are exhibition fights , ha, ha , ha good one Max
Condit is and has always been a fighter's fighter. Gotta love the guy, hope he makes a run and gets another crack at Tyron. #NBK
Tony is great fighter but if he's that hittable in first 5 min against Conor he might get ko'd.
What? Flying Suplex Armbar?? The next finishing move on DJ's list will be Zangeifs 'Final Atomic Buster'. You read it here first.
lol @ ric thinking that push by GSP is real and that he's upset
Tony the real champ
greatest my arse.guy beats no named cans, gtfoh
Caldwell breaking the record for most stoned guest of all time
Ric: Who said it was the best sub?\nAriel: OHHHHHH MMYYYYY,,,\n\nHAHA favorite part is when Ariel and Ric just talk. Both actually understand and know what is happening.
every time a bigger name fighter has a bad weight cut.....OMG we need more weight classes.   because you know that will end bad weight cuts.   Forget all the factors that come into play.
theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee mixed martial arts hour back in. your llife.  same time same place same blababalal until then i say peace......im outta heeeeerre
Tony Absolutely Ferguson
Tony Ferguson rocks!
so glad condits back. and so much respect to Alessio. awesome to hear from him and get some insight on how everything went from his perspective.
Tony Ferguson is so irritating and bodacious! Man, I can't wait to see someone knock this clown out.
Tony is so intense he made a Starbucks story intense
Caldwell did not win that fight that's all he did was hold and stall
So Ian McCall basically is saying he pulled a wanderlai??? Usada came over and....wtf???
Tonys mind is bullet proof !!
Might need to re-upload this --- missing the sound first 4 minutes of Ariel talking :(
Was it muted in the first 4mim for everyone else too?
DJ and Max are class acts...
Holloway dating a hot model? His ex was just a couple of notches above that
I like Tony but he can be full of himself sometimes when he talks about how exactly he likes the fight to go down after a win.  Give me a break Tony....nobody wants a war like the fight you had with RDA.  And definitely you did not want to be mounted by Kevin Lee (you weren't getting out of that if it wasn't for the bell).  Just say it like it is Tony.  With that being said, you're a great fighter.  \n\nHope you get that Mcgregor fight.
Saki vs. Roundtree is a dope ass fight.
Lol @020:28 StarTrek s***. - Demetrious Johnson. What a great analogy. Haha
EL CUCUY!!!
Tony might be weird and a genius at the same time.
The earth is flat
2:56:55 ferguson farts
Ferguson will desyroy mcgregor.
conor will destroy this guy
Ferguson vs khabib this fight make sens for us!!😂😂
Sometimes Ariels asks the dumbest questions ever

Stamp times, please? And how lazy that you couldn't even list the guest list initially - well, it's even in numerical order. And when they do the time they're usually erroneous. Ariel is the best MMA journalist and this is the best mma podcast. I do appreciate all the effort but just such significant things, but it's somewhat unprofessional. :)
DJ wants the easy route. Lame fighter. Retire already
Mousasi the real lb for lb best sorry DJ.
El Cucuy. love the work ethic and your fighting style... you are a really great fighter, a top 3 lightweight in the world, but your striking game and movement. i can't see anything but you getting KO'd in 1 vs conor...and vs khabib...if Lee took you down that many times my lord the difference.
LIST OF GUESTS PLEASE
Man, Ariel checks his laptop too much when his guests are talking.
Lol Tony, delusional. Conor gonna kill him within 2. Lando Vannata had you doing the chicken dance and you think you can handle a combo from Conor?
I wish Condit will go into acting, the guy has something about him, I wanna see him in some movies
Im a musician of 30yrs. \n I must say Everlast's performance was VERYimportant, he grasped that and wasted nothing, he took that moment did Xactly what was needed, healing. Big respect to the man. BIG RESPECT!
Lol tony is so lucky he loses weight so easy. Should be at 170 cheating realy
MMA is GAY.
I stand behind what I said about this movie, which is that I hated it. You don’t have to like a movie to do a tutorial on a look from it, & being that it’s the most popular movie right now, it would be dumb of me to not do a tutorial. Get over it 🎈
my grandma's makeup tutorial came out better sorry...
Why is there so many negativity in the comments 🙁 Don't stop doing what makes you happy, James. Us sisters are here ❤
Your freckles are so cute and you beautiful anyway. Make up doesn't make you look better...you make the MAKE-UP LOOK BETTER! SLAY!
don't listen to the hate sister ❤️😘
you guys need to stop being so mean to him. he is so talented and you probably couldn't do half the stuff he does. he if fabulous and if you think otherwise than I will snatch your weave.
Why so much hate? I love it James!
Love it !!! 😍😍😍❤️❤️ came out great! 🖤
The tutorial is awful but everyone gave him views??? Makes no sense
i don't think I've ever cringed so hard in my life at the intro
When you were doing this it kinda gave me some flashback\nMary vibes lol♥️
What do you mean you don't enjoy the movie? But love the look tho.
Yessss sister ❤️❤️❤️ I've been waiting to watch this and I love it! You did great !
He lowkey proved all our suspicions that he was jealous of Pennywise. 🎈
i just saw it and it was amazing you have a terrible movie taste
You should do a Morticia Addams look!
Don't ruin everything I love
ok so finn and wyatt DRAGGED you on twitter let’s see if they can do it o youtube too
My question is, who would do this? The theme and point of Halloween is scary. No one is gonna go trick or treating as Glam pennywise. What's funny is, yeah he called out It. And then made a fucking tutorial on it. His excuse is That it's the most popular movie right now, it would be dumb of me not to do a tutorial, I'm honestly so shook. That's like if I were to talk shit about this girl at my school and then the next day be exactly like her. I really think its all for money.
Pennywise doesn’t want you to float too
I'm sorry, but your voice make me want to be deaf
Why is everyone hating on this?
i love how you got dragged by 14 year olds on twitter. i'm rooting for the losers club
Credit the music artist which you used for your intro 😡
The cringiest intro I've ever seen
I think everyone just came here to drag the shit out of him😭😂
Everyone is doing this tutorial, but James did it the best ❤️
Honestly mother fucker. Your comment honestly means nothing. You hate the movie so much, so, what gives you the right to then gain publicity and views from making a tutorial on the main character out of the movie you hate so much? If you hate the movie, then why are you publicizing yourself that you don't? your comment means nothing, we all know that you're doing this for views, like fucking hell. People like you make me sick lol.
His nonexistent career was ended by 14 yr olds politely on twitter lmao btw check out my IT movie edit!
his face structure is literally perfect oml😍😍😍
A 14 YEAR OLD DRAGGED YOUR ASS LMFAO
CLICK ON THIS IF YOU DARE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWO3_1wwG3c
can y'all tell me what happened that a 14 yr old dragged him what did they say?
HOLY FUCK THIS IS SO CRINGEY. WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?
You look better without make up
You look like wet news paper
Why is everyone hating on him??
Ok five minuts in this tutorial and it's aweful Stay tuned for update

Does anyone know where the costume is from or what the costume is called lol
Slow the frigggg down Jesus Christ . Pronounce your words . BREATH
You’re the reasons Stanley killed him self 27 years after you came
You should make a Halloween intro
Do you want to get shit faced and pass out? Take a shot Everytime he closes his eyes when he talks at the end of the video :))
you’re gAZEBOES
James you look bomb asf 🔥🔥🔥😍😍 🍯🍯 Idk why there are so many dislikes but fuck it upppp sis 👅
I thought my phone was on fast forward!!!!! What in the actual fuck. Whoa
This is why I DONT Stan
I love James and Finn and Wyatt but their beef was literally the funniest thing ever
How does it feel to be dragged by 14 year olds? 😂
I love how finn has double his subscribers on Instagram
All love from Brazil❤️
Why do people spend so much time hating or saying some dumb behind comments about James, like he still making more money , he probably living wayyy better than you but whateva people always steady gonna be mad.
omg!! i am literally stoked by that intro!!
You did great with the makeup and stuff but I don't think it really embraces everything Pennywise is...
I always come here when I help with a certain makeup look, but this, it has to be the best one, you are an inspiration to young girls with makeup
THIS VIDEO IS GAZEBOS, IT’S BULLSHIT
OMG YOU ARE SO GOOD AT MAKEUP I WISH I  CAN DO THAT
Um sorry boy but um PENNYWISE DOES NOT HAVE GIRL EYES WITH THOES EYELASHES
Amazing! This look is sick. Definitely my favorite pennywise tutorial I've seen. I didn't like the movie either, but I will admit I thought they did a good job w pennywise as far as the looks & acting go. Other than that I thought it was a pretty corny movie!
Why does he talk so fast jfc
The it movie got so sad at some parts
I LOVE YOU JAMES CHARLES🎃🤗😎
You looks so good without makeup👌😋
Your channel is literally the best! I love all of your tutorials and your so inspiring and so funny:) I love youuu❤️
Can someone please explain to me what happened between him and the cast of It?

Walmart vs Gucci 😂
Hiyaaa Brothersss
*Brother**
YYYYYAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS QQQUUUEEEEN SSSSLLLAAYYYY
Really nice vid ☺
HIYA SISTA
It's crazy this made me really think and a lot of his issues weren't drugs, it was him handling the stresses of life. Grant it he didn't have a great start with drugs but if you listen closely you'll see. my college coaches taught me how to drink detox everyone thought i was a junkie, so i said eff it. It seems that was obviously his coping mechanism but no one helped this man, not even himself. To change you really gotta tear down the whole thing so you can rebuild. Everyone was giving him a quick fix, even himself. He looks great now and ability wise he's been a top tier talent. Hopefully he gets reinstated
hope he come back to the browns
If he’s seriously done with the bullshit and just wants to ball he should come to philly. Gordon and alshon😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
You can do it flash , we  believe in you
let the man play!
blaming coaches .... he is blaming other ppl.. he will relapse soon
I hope he comes back and is better than he ever was. God Bless You Josh Gordon!
You got this Josh. YOU can make it! And we still want you in Cleveland. You have the fans behind you.
he had the shakes in the interviews from drinking and drugs the nerve damage --wow
NIGGER
My Bears need him ASAP
The Browns need you.
Marijuana actually is probably rather helpful to NFL players.
The sane human inside me loves to see his growth. The Ravens fan however hates the fact he may be back on the field.
We love you here in CLE Josh
I still cant believe a guy that smokes weed is being punished more than abusers and animal killers. Vick is on tv as an ANALST! A fucking analyst, that we look at and listen to in hope to gain some perspective. Think about that and look at Josh. I get what he is going through too. I can smoke weed once a month and never need anything else, but it stays in your system so long you get your fix through more harmful ways like alcohol to not get in trouble. With that said and we literally look at people around us, if he is such a drug addict how can he be so healthy? The NFL is wrong for doing this, the suspensions only make situations like this worse fir the individual. His legal problems are fixed faster than his NFL problems. Unless there is a performance enhancement issue/violence then the NFL should stay out of it and support it's own assests. ☝
Now all he needs is to get out of Cleveland
Him talking about his dad is so sad. He still loves him and hasn't even talked to him for 12 years.
At the end of the day he has no one to blame but himself, there are plenty of people who came from rough neighborhoods but decided that drugs were not for them, and that they wanted to make something of their life. It isn't like Josh Gordon did not have second, third and fourth chances, because he has had plenty of chances. I say he will never play for the Browns again and probably will never play in the NFL Again.  He made the Commissioner look like a fool when he reinstated him during the 2016 Training Camp, because ultimately Gordon chose drugs over the NFL.
Really proud of the work you have done big guy, can't play ping pong though!!
He’s a beast, the browns need him back and hope he can stay clean. At 26 he has a lot of good football left In him
Why do we have to listen to Steven A Smith coon ass before his interview? Did he intentionally want us to listen to the naysayers are what? Steven coon ass don’t have the right to be done with nobody but his own children if he have any?
And the Browns decided to draft that enabler piece of shit Manziel, who fed Josh more drugs. \n\nFucking dumbest franchise in all of sports.
arguably the most talented receiver I've seen not named randy moss
This man is a freak on the field. Hope he gets the chance to come back.
Let’s go falcons pick this man up just makes us that much better
Inspiring! Way to be a complete man, Josh. Time for you to put up over 200 back to back yards on your demons. You got this!
NFL time to give him another chance! Good luck JG
He must be broke now
This guy hasn't learned anything.  He doesn't need to be worried about football, he needs to be worried about his life and about his daughter that he has never met.  I guarantee that if he gets back on the football field and suffers a career ending injury, he will OD soon after if he doesn't get his head right.  Football is a privilege, not a right.
When life situations transcend sport and the game its related to ,... It reveals the most beautiful aspect of sports in general. Specifically in this all too common story of addiction. When a man is stripped of everything he loves and forced to confront his demons head on, its a defining moment that will break or rebuild his life, not just in his sport but his life as a whole. Josh Gordon speaks eloquently and direct about his experience so well thats it gives me hope that he can come back. I cheer for guys who can lose it all and fight their way back. Its a test of the human condition. Now that's a player and athlete i can root for.  -Eagles fan-
I’m rooting for you Flash! Keep working, get your life together and get back in the league!
Very powerful. A lot of these guys will lose their job and give up and give into the temptation that led them to lose everything in the first place. It’s good to see people make change from their past and give their all to right their wrongs. I hope I’ll see JG on the field soon.
Come back to Cleveland young man .
I have faith he'll stay clean. And once hes out, come to phi, the Eagles need you haha
What kind of camera does uninterrupted use ? Anyone know
This was awesome..See ya soon Flash..✌🏾
wish him the best i pray the brotha turns it around and heals himself football or not
Big Fan of Gordon!  Even more now listening to him and can see he trying whatever it take to change and step up to be a father. Hope Cleveland want to trade him. Jerry Jone need to watch this and trade a 1st round draft for him.   Best of luck to you J Gordon.
Hes from texas , of course he sippin lean 😂
Countdown waiting on you big dog stay on the path
The Bills need a receiver badly right now.  Hope he gets reinstated and they take a look at signing him.
Go Browns!
Give this guy a chance fuck wasting his potential
7:27  Anyone know who that is on the back of Gordon's hoodie?
Going through same things dui in 2014 and still going but this helps me maintain
Hope my Bengals call and give you a chance
Great job Josh! Awesome to see a positive story in today's world! Keep up what you're doing bro! My BEARS could DEFINITELY use you haha..
mannnnnn, i'll take him in New England in a heartbeat
they need to make a full documentary series of this guy
damn son, this more than weed
Still love you bro! Miner set back for a major come back
Wait so the schools help athletes violate ncaa policy? But I thought it was all about amateurism and education?
Carolina go get this guy🙏\n\n#Another chance\n#KeepPounding
ill believe it when I see it
So basically this is letting everyone know he’s going to the patriots next year
I failed the drug test because I was getting high. man this makes me change my opinion about him. hope he gets on the field soon. God knows the Browns need him
Good to see him working on him self ..
Bro holla at the giants we definitely need some help
Idk why but I get a Jon Jones vibe from this. I hope Josh leaves this behind and gets back to the league.
I'm praying for this young man to succeed. It should start with being a good person first.
I pray the Chicago bears get him 🐻
I believe in you bro, always have always will. You still have the chance to be the greatest ever. #JoshGordon
All the best to him, he seems like he's really taken some huge steps forward. I really hope it all works out for him, from people I know in my life this is incredibly tough to deal with.
His drug use never effected his performance from what I seen not encouraging it when your making millions of dollars but I am not worried about him not being the same at all he got help\nAt the right time never showed he was washed now all he has to do is stay clean.
Give him a couple million and he would f up again
I hope he can make it back in the league!
Somebody has to say it! - How long until he is traded to NE? ....
trustingod
Dry told on baylor..
I've have never seen a joint worth a million dollars
I believe in you J.G.\nI sincerely hope you can become a father. Be blessed.
Can he play football next year?
He would’ve been on Julio, Odell, and Antonio’s level
Weed should just be cool with NFL. Since 90% of them have brain damage retiring
*i want my Bears to somehow get him* 🐻
Stay strong my brother we all make mistakes keep the grind up don't look back
Man he went around the streets, knocking on people’s door, asking random people where he could find weed. All he had to do was knock on my door. I would have directed him to Johnny Manziel’s Twitter page.
Lamar high school proud 💯
6:39 Tyrone Biggums sighting
Hope he can redeem himself. Fantastic talent.
Fuck skip bayless
Good luck Josh...
VLONE THUG
You got this Josh, you got this!! #onedayatatime
Giants watching like........👀
Such a talent.
“STAY OFFFFF THE WEEEEEEEEEEEEEDD”
Stay OFFFF The WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDUUUHH
Raiders need him
https://soundcloud.com/tyje-king-872067018/flyguy
Prove em wrong!
ayeee shout out to Turbo Taylor
There is no detox drink that works as he described. Too bad this perennial failure has to try and attribute his mistakes to other people. I see no growth.
hope he gets a 2nd chance in the league.
Josh imma need the name of these detox drinks
From a long time browns fan i truly believe Josh Gordon had all the god given talent to be a hall of fame wide receiver and in 2013 he had 1600+ receiving 9 td's and went to the pro bowl, this has to be the most talented person I have ever seen literally throw it away, in the future I wish him the best but I think he will regret the decisions he made later in life.
He had multiple chances but keep fucking up
Iv done all these drugs that he said he's done multiple times before and never got addicted , he doesn't have a problem he's just immature
He is an idiot. He has had so many chances already.
The dislikes are from Costa for being pocketed by Per in FA cup final
Wow his English is pure fluent better than Kane tbh
I feel proud that we have such a fantastic club captain!
If Arsenal FC was a man it would pretty much be Per 👏
you can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice that he cares. it's great that he cares.
Per Mertesacker, a true leader in many areas of life. A good example, strong but humble character. He is an example of what we lack in today's society, not just in football, for a man to stand up and be a leader and but remain true and humble. What a brilliant man.
More people need to be like that. Including me.
now i know why wenger chose him to be our club's captain
Per really looks like a young Arsene Wenger when he was young lol
Class act on and off the pitch 👊👊
Please don’t retire. Ever.
I honestly love Per Mertesacker. He will always be a legend whilst he retires.
I'll always love this guy. Always. What a legend. Humility builds great leaders.
Big _Friendly_ German awww
What a guy per mertesacker BFG⚽️. My G
Why not make him assistant coach for next season?
BFG is a leader and born motivator
Such a gentle giant. Per you beautiful soul. Keep up the good work!
What a genuine and lovely person respect per
WOW...Incredible stuff!!!!
All young players, from ALL clubs, watch & learn, BFG, top man,
I just love this club so much
manutd fan here, have to admit I have always looked up at to him both on and off the pitch
The depth of character of this man...geez Louise.  It's an absolute honor to have him represent The Arsenal on and off the pitch.  I hope he remains with the Club in various capacities long after this final campaign.
Proud to be gooner fan and proud of him..coug
This man has went from hero-Legend-God
Big Friendly German!!! Top Guy I reckon.
What a great man! Let's keep him at the Arsenal.
Gary hurt Per's eye 😭
Values of this club were always top , love you Per.
Mertesacker should be Arsenal Manager by 2030... Remember me...
What a great man.\nReally hope he can instill the same values he has on the younger lads (not saying that they don't have it) and raise them to be leaders, not just football players.
Proud to have him at arsenal
Remember who you are, what you are, and who you represent.
PER!!! What a GUY..!! 👏
Well done and nice video UP THE GUNNERS🖒
What a good day for me. Inspired
Respect! It's good of Arsenal to keep hold of him
I love this guy man.. what a legend.
people who dislike this have no heart
The fans captain\nInspiring
John Terry might have every single trophy for club out there and perhaps superior to the BFG but he ain't won a World Cup has he
A perfect club captain for us.
Per is a one of a kind.
I can't wait until he takes over the Arsenal academy. He is going to be such an important asset to youth development. Legend.
I'm a simple man, I hear Per Mertesacker giving his perspective  on something, I listen.
Hi  i love the guners please can play in your team  please 😢 🙏
Hopefully his last game with Arsenal is winning Europa League trophy! #Respect #Legend
Now that is how you really serve your people and country not a never ending war in the name of peace, so much respect for you Per
I just dont understand people these days how can there be 4 dislikes ,what is wrong with being honest and wanting to highlight a important condition in many peoples life's. even if your not an arsenal fan or admirer of per there shouldn't be dislikes
Wow. Such an amazing role model for Arsenal. So much respect for Per Mertesacker.
Fantastic!  Hope to see you on the pitch again soon.
He gives so much back to the community. Could do with a politician like him tbf
You cannot hate Per Mertesacker
Legend💪🏾
Love this guy
our captain! <3 :')
He's such a great guy.
Per is somebody that you just can't hate.
Big f****** German - Top guy. A really nice guy.
A gentle giant and a great man.
Well done sir!  Respect to you!
The man's so elegant and refined he's even starting to look like Arsene
You are a very good man Per. Big fan. A man who is really down to earth, loves the club and fans. A true leader and real captain. Thanks.
Can see this guy becoming manager of our great club one day 🔴⚪️❤️
Hope Per always stays around the club, he's such a gentle, intelligent kind-hearted guy
We can have this great mentality.. and all the other great mentalities that Arsenal have AND buy top class players that might not meet the humble footballer and change them to be more humble once they're brought to Arsenal!!
my favorite player since he played his first few games at arsenal. what a guy
I hope Per stays in UK and with Arsenal for many years.
I don't even like football, what a great guy
What a great guy Per is.... really pleased he's staying on at Arsenal after he's finished playing. He has all the right values.
We're lucky to have this kind and thoughtful human being at our club, your a credit to your parents and country
Proud that he is our CAPTAIN :)
We Love You Per. You have opened my eyes. God Bless You
Announce Thomas Lemar signing in January

Per mertasacker blond hair
He truly stands tall among men.
Honestly i think i would be confident as fuck if were to make it past 65
I am 12. Nothing interesting. 💩 I dont want to believe this. 😂
You feel most comfortable with your body between the age of 75 and 84? I would think that your feeling like shit because your back hurts your cranky, music sucks so your ears hurt, all this pain and anger is giving you a headache you can't pee normally anymore, like I see nothing good in all of this and it will transfer to your psychy which is the next thing saying you feel the best at 82, so with all this shit going on and the idea that your body is near its limits and you are probably gonna die soon how is my psychological well being at its highest? It's stressed as fuck
I haven't even finished and I know I'm going to feel down after this video D:
0-2 years old you can get away with ANYTHING
Why do they say that Math skills are highest at 50 years old but show Physics stuff instead -.-
Best at playing chess? Most people can’t even play
From the jump this video is dumb, the younger age learning languages better  thing is a myth.
Such videos need evidence. scientific evidence or at least mention a research because this world has a media that is full of mistakes
Ok I will wait to get 50 and then deal with mathematics
Cant wait to be 60 or over so I can say whatever the f I want lol
That's for middle class , what about the other humans?
Did anyone see Pogba in the last few seconds?
Im Was The Best At Skateboarding When I Was 10 Now Im 47 Still The Best At My True Sport
Women's peak strength is earlier than 25
i one year over least likely to die, *sigh*
Anyone know who the music is by?
Or just go smoke a blunt
Women make highest salary at 39 and met at 48 wtf are the feminists talking about
I actually felt the most alive, and my future felt the most promising at 23. By the time I turned 24 though, after a few failed job interviews and rejections later.. realized this life thing aint easy.
this is the most depressing video ever
i am least likely to die :/\n*W H Y*
I haven’t begun to peak
I just want to know when will be my peak dick size.
I'm 18. I guess this is my last year of not being retarded
Age 31, when your metabolism says “fuck you”.
Lol, so you are at peace with yourself and your body just before you die.....
Does anyone know the song?
75-84 most comfortable with your body???? Are you freaking kidding me????????????
It would make my day if someone could tell me what song this is.
When you dont fit any of the above 😂😂😂
This explains why i keep getting straight F's in my math class....cant wait to get 50 and boom....
Well ain't this video all BS
Some of these don't make sense.
Yeah...just can’t wait until I can play chess well.
Yeah I'm looking forward to having great math skills. You know, 30-40 years after school
why at the end did it say there's always one thing to look forward to then they all die
Well this wasn't nearly as depressing as I thought it would be.
Even though this isn't full on fact (or fact at all) this video is uplifting to people who are scared of aging.
I call bullshit on most of them
What a load of crap.
Dnt watch this just experience ur own surprises In the things that make you, YOU ! (:
ATTENTION :\n\nThe Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. THE PATH IS NARROW AND VERY FEW PEOPLE FIND IT!THE STRONG DELUSION THAT GOD SENDS IS SUNDAY CHURCH SERVICE, AS WELL AS THE PRIDE OF LIFE.PEOPLE WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO THEIR PASTOR THEN LISTEN TO GOD. EVERLEARNING IN CHURCH INSTITUTIONS AND NEVER KNOWING JESUS. NEVER HEARING THE FATHER VOICE.Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons DIDNT WE ATTEND CHURCH but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven.REPENTANCE,OBEDIENCE AND LOVE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. THE CHURCH IS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THEY ARE NOT IN THE INSTITUTIONS. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!! ACTS 7:48\n\nBE YE SEPARATE FROM THE WORLD!! BE YE SEPERATE FROM THE LOVERS OF THIS WORLD!
Highest satisfaction in life 23? Well, the rest of life is going to suck haha.
But I thought no one likes you when you're 23?
I'm 18 and i noticed I'm faster at reading and reflexes this year compared to other years no joke. Lol.
Great....Ill die before the things I need happen lol
Did the really do women are most attractive and not do men are most attractive?
What are you the best at RIGHT NOW? \n.... sleeping.
They forgot:\nThe age when you are best at popping a boner: 12 years old
So these are just averages, you can’t really take anything from this video, at all
Well, damn, I'm 24 so I guess it's all downhill now.
Highest satisfaction at 23? That was the lowest point of my life.
Age is just a number or you can  ask my mom, who against all odds , came to this country, learn a new language at 44, met the man of her dreams at 46, got an incredible job offer at 66, at 77 yrs old my mom is still going strong!!\nstill works her full time job ( by choice), and has More aspirations than ever.\nabove all she is very grateful woman for what she  has done for  her life  and ours .\nage is just a number.
lmao the happiest is 23 years old, usually when people graduate college
I thought at the end it was going to say No matter how old you are...we are all going to die
Jesus goddamn Christ! Can I go one day without worrying about my future?!
No matter how old you are... remember, that one day, you WILL die.  Have a nice life :)
Well this brought my self esteem down
Wait... so you're telling me I have to wait half a century in order to be decent at math... *sigh*
What if I say, I don't believe this crap ....
Quality of life is highest at 23? I feel like there are so many social determinants and lifestyle dependency factors...
You Are Great - Motivation \nhttps://youtu.be/4R90ek4V7d8
This is fake I enjoyed life the most when I was 24
 I'm Proven this video Very Wrong !     🔮
23 is typically when most people are out of college with no job.  That doesn't sound like a satisfying life.
Going back to college at 50 I guess
Bunch Of Nonsense
Nothing
This is BS
Brain activity fastest at 18. Well fuck 😂
wtf is this based on ? buzzfeed polls ?
All BS
That shit’s bullshit
0:42 BOII!!
Horrible
23 most happiest lmfao
Nothing

lockheed martin
Not true
FUCK MY LIFE
Peak procrastination age - 15 to 20
Nice music
Anout to be 25 💪💪💪💪
TIL that the average person, doesn't know what an average means...
Yup, we can all look forward to death!
This video is complete bullshit.
Oh yeah?....., well whats the age you get a shitty roll of the dice and get cancer and die well before most people?.... \n\nFuck off!
I'm 19, time to see how shitty the rest off my life will be :)
so they looked at a bunch of statistics, calculated averages and then proceeded to make a shitty, useless video. bravo.
When are men most attractive to women? Da fuk.
Get this trash off trending!!!!
Who makes such stupid videos?
Did Donna Karen really use the asking for it excuse...
its true women walk around with there boobs out and shit
WHY ISN'T HE IN JAIL?!?!?!
So. On one hand you got them demanding Muslim women don't cover themselves head to toe, then now you get women dress to proactively and it's their fault they get sexually harassed???!
Weinstein is a pig; more than a creeper being a rapist and so fucking ugly inside and out. Donna Karan is an idiot.
Donna Karan is that typical woman that thinks prettier women than her deserve to be treated badly. What a b****.
i hope ricky gervais will present golden globes again and make fun of this situation
Donna's got a point, tho. Have you seen the way they dress in Hollywood? Like sluts. And if it walks like a slut, talks like a slut, dresses like a slut, how would it expect to get treated anymore than like slut?
Does Donna Karen have some kind of neurological disorder? Her smile was weirdly rhythmic much like Tourette's
subscribe my channel. i give you my sell phone number. with sex free
Watch your mouth you liberal cuckold faggot. You’re the biggest disgrace in newscasting. Dropping the F Bomb doesn’t make you cool. We all know you represent the OTHER F-Word every day though- A FAGGOT! A FUCKING FAGGOT
Oh I’m done watching foul mouth piece of shit cock sucker I don’t have to listen to your dirty filthy fucking words Oliver you’re a piece of shit
The behaviour is troubling...just one question...Harvey is a predator and these women are victims...but what do you call women who took him up on his offer?
All I have to do is go on these actresses ig and I lose all sympathy.
Donna Karan's response is an insult to all women. How they dress is of no importance as if wearing certain clothes beg for their wearers to be used and abused. Also, look at the outfit she is wearing. Is she begging for it? Somehow I think not, since she is neither sexy or appealing no matter what she wears.
Where were you late night Comedians when this story broke? Silent with your Leftist buddies. Meanwhile, you all jumped on the Mandalay Bay story instantly to condemn our Second Amendment Rights as Americans. Disgusting. You should be ashamed.
Harvey is no different than any other liberal Democrat. They're all perverted hypocritical liars. Everything they falsely accuse Conservatives of being they actually are.
Why did you and all the liberal media pawns wait so long to adress this? I mean come on, your liberal audience were dying to be fed atleast SOME form of biased coverage over this scandal. Oh dont worry, John, give it a week or two and the only thing on the menu for your audience will be trump jokes and how he is so sexist towards woman. LMAO
How many dicks did this limey pinko fairy suck to get this shitty tv show?
If these fat, perverted, creepy, pieces of shit would hit a gym or diet then people would naturally be attracted to them. What's the hold up?
He should’ve went into more depth of how Polanski legit raped a 14 year old girl and all of Hollywood backed him up and Meryl Streep even gave him a standing ovation when he won an Oscar
2:30 for this story. 2 years on Trump.
Oliver is only getting 400k views despite being pushed to #1 trending over and over\nTelling
Weinstein is a creep and worse. But he got away with it because lots of men and women decided they wanted fame and fortune over integrity and safety. Anyone who was a target of Weinstein's harassment could've reported it to the press or police. Those who didn't must've thought their future prospects wasn't worth stopping the guy from harassing someone else. For 100 years we've heard stories about lecherous suits and immoral actors harassing and selling to give or get what they want, respectively. The real [gross] question is: How will movies get made now that suits and actors can't force or trade sex for good parts?\n\nWould Jolie or Paltrow have gotten a job if someone didn't think they could bed them?
Donna Karan is asking for a punch in the face
Donna Karan make me confuse is he or she ??
Funny how the men think it’s disgusting, and the women defend it.
Casey Affleck. \nThat Oscar was a slap in the face to every woman, not just in entertainment, who has ever been sexually abused and harassed. Basically saying Yes, we know. but we are giving him an Oscar anyway. But hey, look at the way they treat Woody Allen. \nI hope whoever wins best actress ignores Affleck and refuses to touch him. \nThe easiest thing would be to have the best actor from the year before, or have the best supporting actor present both best actress and best supporting actress awards. \nBut I guarantee the academy will be too cowardly to do that.
Lol. Jews.\n+We own everything You’ve now been educated about as far as I'm willing to take you' = Paul Heyman. WWE Newscaster. Jewish blood.  To Stone Cold Steve Austin when questioned how come you control everything
John Oliver looks like he's been penetrated by the HARV!
That's a man baby !
I  post the *RAREST* Snapchats on my channel check them out on my playlists (Only real savages)🔥💪🏾
If you wear a hookers uniform, don’t be surprised if people treat you like a hooker. Just sayin. Women need to stop playing naive about the effect “modern dress” has on men.
Weinstein thing should be discussed on Golden Globes and Oscars next year
All the liberals riding the anti-Weinstein train. Laughable.
What Donna Karen means is skanks who use their body to get ahead.Flirting,advances,dates then  act oblivious when they attract creeps.Yes there are creepy women who will go to a hotel do questionable things even sleep with a fat ugly guy jerk to be famous.
It’s a good thing that Hollywood, HBO and other major entertainment companies didn’t know about Harvey Weinstein’s sexual assaults for decades and cover it up just to make money.
Thank you John Oliver for mentioning Casey Affleck
1st thumbs up I have ever given this guy.
Lol. 3 minutes. Glad he gave so much attention to this.
Fuck, the bottom of my ass cheek is itchy
I hope with all this shit being exposed people don’t forget Andy Signore is also a colossal piece o shit
Lets not forget all the girls forced to suck Bill Clinton's cock.
Donna Karan looks like reboot Pennywise wearing the skin of a mid 2000s MILF pornstar, with the sort of clothespinned smile she plasters on every 5 seconds that gives the ever-so-delightful vibe that she has an entire log shoved up her vagina.
And people are surprised by how much I hate this fucking city
it must have been a challenge for the writers and producers of show to air this episode without slanting this in a way to make trump look bad
When I saw the hat at 1:34, it makes me think of Doug Dimmadome Owner of the Dimmesdale Dimmadome.
you never know, Donna Karen might have harassed a few women herself, maybe even some of her employees
Casey Afleck is presenting best actress? Yikes... what a fucking joke
Watch my video or your mom will die don't forget to like comment and subscribe too
another libtard rapist from hollywood. we need to investigate hollywood and expose all the democratic rapists that reside in it
Really Donna Karan  you are a disgrace
I just posted a new porn video! Check it out!
Donna karan needs to be shot in her fucking face
I guess I never knew Donna Karan looks so much like Ben Kingsley
look how Donna Karan is dressed, guys go get her -- she asking you to.
Something liberals and conservatives can all get behind, Harvey Weinstein is a dirtbag
Why the Eff did John not bring up Woody Allen near the end there? Especially how his defensive remarks towards Weinstein were even WORSE than Stone's...
Umm...Donna how do you know anything?  Use the plastic surgery you’ve been getting to open your eyes.  How dare you victim blame!  So according to Donna, Angie Everhart sleeping asked for Harvey to enter her room and bust a nut?
I'm angry that in a video about a powerful man sexually harassing women, the main takeaway for a few people seems to be something along the lines of, Can you believe that ugly woman? She's so wrong!
DKNY all up in your eye
So David Crowder and Ben Shapiro did a segment on Weinstein and got millions of views way way earlier than this clown and yet their vids is not trending. Now, when Hollywood cannot do anything other than condemn Weinstein, this clown suddenly grows some cohones and start to tell joke about him? Where were you a week ago when the story about his sexual abuse broke? I urge anyone watching to youtube ben shapiro, or David crowder, or andrew clavin for some real news commentation, not this cuck bs. And shame on you YOUTUBE for suppressing any vids that are not in line with your propaganda. While we are on this subject, everyone, please search project veritas by john o'keef and open your eyes.
Finally a fucking clip not about Trump..... And that fucking Donna bitch looks like a fucking shoe
The wildfires' is God's way of saying fuck California for enabling the disease spreading faggots.
Donna Karen is a fucking retard
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fL-1kHxsavI
Did it feel good tho...?
🤣🤣🤣🤣 too funny
What about expelling Polanski?
Wut did casey do?
Jesus christ, please fuck off already
So, typical liberals....
#satire  #take no bullshit
2 minutes on Weinstein\n2 billion minutes on President Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8EIR8754_Y
Synagogue of Satan strikes again.
Harvey Weinstein belongs in an oven
she's not wrong. dress like a slut, get treated like a slut.
Donna Karen looks like a transexual witch.  No diss to transexuals.
So now that the truth is out, everybody is eager to condemn? How convenient. Seth MacFarlene, the creator of Family Guy which offends more people than it should, had enough moral fiber to shed light on this in the best way he can.\n\nJohn Oliver (and others) are enablers to sexual predators UNTIL it becomes expedient to their careers to lambast them.
Sub to me.and you'll get great videos
Why does Donna Karan smile creepily at the end of every sentence?
You can literally watch Oliver's dink get smaller by the second!
Wow such bad things going on
i like how this is trending
Am I the only one who thought it was Mr Wonderful 😂😂😂
Harvey Weinstein is a Democrat donated 10-13 millions to Hillary Clinton, Harvey has more in common with Bill Clinton he Raped Several woman as well
why is john oliver always trending with so little views lol
Stop stealing content
The left took for ever to discuss this pig after the truth was revealed. Too busy talking about that fake Russia thing there's still no evidence for
Who did Oliver blow to get his propaganda pushing position?
164739 × 0 + 16 ÷ 4
How can this be so high on Trending. Maybe they don't use math.
Gawd almighty, shut the hell up.  Either entertain people (YOUR JOB) or go into politics or policy, but only a TINY FRACTION of people want to listen to some entertainer with ZERO credentials, knowledge, or experience in well, ANYTHING and EVERYTHING meaningful and important.  I bet he has never even read an entire piece of legislation.  Has he read the unabbreviated version of the Federal budget?  Has he read anything longer than a MENU?  He doesn’t even dress himself.  Someone else writes his jokes, people.  Is he even a citizen of this country? How insane for someone to despise the country of their birth so much that they have no guts to stay and fix it but they move to America to tell Americans how to “fix” their country.  Really???  Can you imagine the drivel spewing from this self-important blowhard that must come out of his mouth from dawn till dusk?  Hell would be defined as being married to this ass.  Go. Away. Now. Here is the truth:  No matter how much you spew out your useless views on the myriad of coffee break issues daily, you will NEVER, EVER have any real impact on anything of meaning.  You’ll never make a real difference.  The only person you will truly help is yourself, by lining your pocket and puffing up in front of the world as if you really matter in the grand scheme of things.  You will never get a law passed, or change bad policy, or improve the world for anyone but yourself.  I am quite sure that you are just fine with that, you hypocrite.
donna karen got some serious traction alopecia girl
I thought a person was not guilty until proven so.
I didn't even know about Mel Gibson's controversies before this
Lol Mel Gibson? Woody Allen fucked and married his stepdaughter
While im not condoning harveys behavior rape is not cool donna somewhat has a point girls do dress scantily sometimes so that theyll get laid
this is the reality. and people need to pay attention to it, no matter what. if anything bad happened to any of these women who are chiming in now.. it only happened because they gave their assent. how do you not give your assent? you fight him off. you yell. you run. and if you can't do anything, and he rapes you.. or does anything to you (including anything that you had to try to hit him or yell or run from him for).. you go and report it the next second. these women didn't do that. they gave their assent. they are to blame. the first is to blame for what happened to the second. the first and the second are to blame for what happened to the third. the first and the second and the third are to blame for what happened to the fourth.. and each one is to blame for what happened to them if they could have done something to stop it, like scream, run, hit, and did nothing. there is no greatness in coming out now and saying, he did this to me. all you are saying is that it is your fault for not reporting him and for this happening to all the other women down the line from you. THIS IS REALITY. ANYONE WHO SAYS IT IS NOT IS EVIL.
Humble god Taemin.
his arms his dance his eyes but damn that sweet voice!😭
TRENDING NO.2 IN THE UK. TAEMIN DID THAT
There is just something about Taemin that makes him different from the other idol dancers (definitely not discrediting other idol dancers because I appreciate them as well). The way he moves, his expressions, and the feel are just on another level that moves me. Anyone can learn to dance but not everyone can bring the strong and passionate feel that Taemin brings to his performances.
lol i remember when hater said, Taemin cant sing and he just can dance, he is just a trash in Shinee...but look at him, Now!! He will be the great solo singer from sm!
At the end.\nHe dabbed.\nTaemin dabbed.
wow i really like this 😍
YOU ARE A DANCING MASTER!!! TAEMIN YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE AWESOME TOO.
I CANT THIS IS ILLEGAL
I love how dancers always get a big role in Taemin's videos
OUR TAEMIN HAS CHANGED \n\n*in a good fucking way*
Taemin has this way of moving his body so fluidly it's intoxicating.
Did he just dab at the end
I feel so attacked right now 😫😫
I like it \nand Plz sm I want sehun solo like this. \n#sexyconcept
This dance MV has me feeling all sorts of ways. Taemin and the dancers rocked this choreo!! Well done!!!! 😍❤
Our TaeMinnie grew to become a really good, healthy and handsome man😭 I can't help but remember him as the baby he was during their dubut times, but look at him, all grown-up, so sexy and even more talented. His moves are more and more smooth and erotic as time goes by, and his musical style keeps getting more... defined. This sounds so TaeMin. Flame of love is so TaeMin, too. I don't even know how to explain it, but the beat and passion of his work are unique. \nKeep makin' mom proud:')
*Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel he has that Michael Jackson's vibe :D Also, he moves his hips way better than me xD He is goalsss*
Finally a new type of music in kpop! Well done!
THE MICHAEL JACKSON OF KPOP
HE MOVES SO SEAMLESSLY WITH BACKUP DANCERS THAT THEY ALSO STAND OUT I AM SO LIVING FOR THIS
Can somebody tell me names of the third and second girl from right?
I'm OBSESSED. \nI LOVE YOU TAEMIN\n❤️❤️❤️❤️
Taemin, a man, showing us the power that can come from femininity. It's a yes from me,
You know you guys; think about how hard those shorts are to put on and take off, especially when wet #AppreciateBackupDancers

#2 on trending? Awesome!!
The moment when you’re stuck in the toilet at the Emirates because they’ve run out of paper for your crack 😂
Fail to prepare, prepare to fail
Love the way DT shut that mug up lol.
‘We’re a top 6 team’ shut up😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish I was as tough as DT he's so dangerous
I feel bad for Sanchez and Özil, they deserve to play in a better team. They are world class players
ha ha ha ha ha he comes from luton  why ent he sayin fam and blood anymore non stop i thought he was from jamaica the other week
This guy is such a mug
BMT HE DOES NEED TO STOP TAKING LACAZETTE OFF AFTER 65 MINUTES, ITS SO JARRING, LET HIM FINISH THE GAME
this shameless creature called robbie my name is desperate larry no no bob smith
Tell me how this guy actaully had some pretty good points and then he brought up Arse Wenger
Fat Robbie he always put the blame Ozil for arsenal lost thanks DT for defending Ozil
DT just imagine how good it is to be a tim winning every single week fucken amazing also up the ra🇮🇪🇮🇪
It's not just Wenger, It's Ozil, and every other player on that team. All garbage, Sanchez playing like garbage on purpose because he's stuck in a trash can of a club. complete overhaul needed.
The thing about Arsenal is there to flat, they need to use there big name players to attract more talent. That’s why Arsenal need to spend yeah Lacazette decent but is he really going to attract world class players? Cause the CL looks miles away now
To be fair its not just Watford fans who are laughing at you hahahaha Muppets.
#4 on trending. Robbie is laughing his head off haha
How can someone be so evil... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo22Al8H7GU
Amir kahn in the background
So what is an arsenal fan. I don't think I have ever seen a real arsenal fan. They diss there own club
what is this role reversal at the start\n\ndt defending players robbie going hard\n\nwat
Not sure why this is such a surprise!, said last season, pre-season and the start of this season Arsenal will be a mid-table club by the end of the season, possibly lower than 10th!...nothing has changed or will change!..which is good as I can't stand Arsenal, but I am been impartial in this, as a football fan of 41 years its easy to spot those clubs and the teams they have who is serious about winning leagues and European trophies and Arsenal are nowhere near that level and have slipped down the pecking order for the years now.\nSanchez and Ozil will be off on a free, possibly more will follow, Arsenal will not get European football next season and this will not attract big players but Sanchez and Ozil, they will l leave and suddenly they will be the world class players they are meant to be at another club, because Arsenal is an easy club to play for, the players are wrapped in cotton wool, they can under perform without the fear of being dropped from the team, paid a decent wage for doing nothing to earn the money as the fans keep paying more and more for season tickets because they won't say enough is enough...
2:05 \n\nWhat a roast. Take a bow son. Take a bow.
#2 on trending? Arsenal Fan TV is amazing, i've been watching robbie for like 4 years
Arsenal is doing shit tbh but so is Chelsea :(
Arsenal fan TV is bigger than Arsenal FC lately😂😂
something is wrong with DT. guy needs to smoke a bowl or get laid or something.
These whiney gooner fans are the laughing stock of the football world..embarrasing little cry babies
Man like lacazette needs to play full 90, after giroud come on there was no attack. Ozils form is shite and this is the worst midfield on arsenal history.
They lost 1 game, so what, get a grip, stop crying bitches. This is exactly why people say stuff, because they know so many people react so big to it.
My God he has a point
Iwobi is working harder than any arsenal player
Great players make a team great... Pirlo zidane ronaldo ... if you are not great then you not a great team ,... crying baby Sanchez can change as many teams as he likes ... up to him to make team great.... let’s face it Arsenal sucks
Dont watch this video .... \nI repeat its a trap. Dont watch this video\nhttps://youtu.be/W7GY8HPG-pc
It’s so so true wat DT says we need change
What a disgusting human being. Everything that's wrong with the world and England in particular. Dumb fat chav.
So how much is Özil paying you DT? Özil should have put that chance away.
You know what as a man untied supporter who use to take shit from arsenal fans taking the piss out of us in our bad years after fergie left, now we the shit and arsenal are trash I absolutely love this. Nothing better then watching arsenal supports suffer
I seriously Ozil doesn't get signed by Manchester we do need that piece of shit and we dont need to pay his ridiculous wages
DT this is my first time not agreeing with you on Ozil. Apart from the miss chance he didn't looked interested Period. That's a man with MAN UTD on his mind not ARSENALFC
DA talks a lot of sense wenger is holding you all back
DT  u are on point man......the way u analysis is real fact!...i like dt.
I agree with DT...
I love this guy
Dt is a fake hard man. What a joke.
I love the fact that this jumped up knob has a constant idea on how Arsenal should perform, if he knew that much about tactics and managerial decisions why is he on a parody YouTube channel? 🤔
This DT Guy was born angry.
https://youtu.be/TltKWHiBZ1M its true  what his saying
DT keeps saying deliberate miss...FFS !! no miss is a deliberate miss....its not like every once in a while a player 1v1 with keeper goes tell ya what, imma try and hit goalie's chest this time
Also you are always very disrespectful to Robbie, you wouldnt be shit without the big man dont forget that Dick Taster
Lol this bloke talking is such a bell end 😂😂 Ju'nart I mean?
hahahahah look at that self loathing wigger.  Must be awful being a minority amongst 3rd world animals
DT says I'm from Luton...so why do you support Arse Nil then? Support your local team, would call him a Glory supporter but this is Arse Nil we talking about
Arsenal are the best
Elneny played like crap. Iwobi was misplacing passes left and right. Wenger made questionable subs and team decisions. Xhaka was picking his nose as Cleverely buries the winning goal for Watford. \n\nBut blame the loss on Ozil for the chance that he missed (which was not a miss, it was saved). Seriously, the hate that he gets from the fans is beyond comprehension. He created two chances, that's nothing now?  \n\nHonestly, if Ozil went somewhere and shows the quality that he has that is underappreciated and mismanaged at Arsenal, I would like to see the look of these lots faces then.
Hi, i am a new fifa 18 youtube gamer, fifa 18 and i'm trying to grow my youtube channel SUBSCRIBE!
We got lots of underlying problems and özil is one of them
Dt public protests banners planes will never solve the problem.mass pitch invasion needed kroenke out first then wenger then transition period.he will sign another contract after 2 years remember what I said
This guy should concentrate on having a wash then cry about football you tramp
Trying to reach 20k views I’m on 17k please help,me get views by watching my videos please 😆😆
All I can say is Arsenal have been stung yet again by the Hornets , Teams ain't nervous about playing the Arsenal any more they know they can punish them. You going to be a 8th place team this season .
It’s not ozil’s fault arsenal lost, players make mistakes including the very best that have ever existed. The fact is arsenal conceded 2 goals against a shit team, that’s way more worrying than a freak miss from a good player.
He was as offside as your belly shut tf up class comeback fair play to ya
First comment on Cannon Fodder Tv this season, where should I start......   the banter during 2015/2016 was great the banter last year was laughable at best and seen how you've  started the season off pretty much were you  left off from last season there not much to say from my end that hasn't been said , however the same old nonsense is dribbling out the mouths of this circus act once again, this is no longer a rivalry anything Spurs fans say from now on would just be classified as bullying. COYS
DT = dickhead for backing Ozil. Robbie right world class players don't play!
I don’t get how DT doesn’t understand the point about Ozil. Ozil is demanding more more money saying he’s the best player otherwise he’s going to leave. The point is how can he demand that he’s a world class player if he throws the biggest chance away when it should have been a goal, and by missing that chance Ozil has contradicted himself by missing an easy goal and isn’t worth his demand. Not that hard to understand.
Arsenal. Arse nil.  Lol
Sub plz

Ozil is wank... Robbie is right ...  DT then says nah its not about Ozil its team selection ...  So why is Ozil even starting hes fuking garbage... Robbie is right especially when your uming and ouring about a new contract and more money ...
She can sing, she can dance, she's pretty, and she's unproblematic. Absolute travesty that she's not selling out stadiums all over the world
No offence to Alexandra- she’s amazing, but I can’t help staring at Gorka. That man is beautiful....
#1 on trending!!!!! Yeeeesssss!!!!!
“All my ladies you can do it. You can do it even better in broken heels” LOVE ALEXANDRA!!!!
Great performance from Alexandra. I wish she’d return to music . I miss her amazing voice and music.
It's impossible for me to watch this and not have the biggest smile on my face ❤️✨
As a huge Tina Turner fan, she definitely did her proud!! Amazing!!

ALEX BURKE!! YESS!!
Addictive, can't stop watching it, that was superb. 👏🏽scd I agree routine was hot.
One question, why did the BBC cut Alexandra hair in the thumbnail?🤔🤔🤔
why does she have different hair in the thumbnail?
best evil dance ever seen... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo22Al8H7GU

OMG
Honestly, all these judges in the comments section are cracking me up!
Best dance so far by a mile, no slips. She's joined the group of great jives up with Scott, Jill, Austin, Jay and Ore. 10.
This is everything 😚
Trending number one!! Slay
Wow #1 on trending
SHES GOING TO WIN!!!! 👑👑💕💯💯💯 trust me lol
Hi, i am a new fifa 18 youtube gamer, fifa 18 and i'm trying to grow my youtube channel SUBSCRIBE! MY BIRTHDAY CAN I GET SOME SUBS PLEASE
Thanks to the band and singers for keeping it tight...
Definitely a great performance from Alex and partner but I hope Craig was on his feet in disgust about them not sticking to the '10 second rule'!!!
Hey guys, I've been making YouTube videos for a while now and I'm really trying to reach 200 subs, I would really appreciate it if you subbed ❤️
THEY LOOK FAB! I'll be so upset if they don't win they are clearly the best
Good afternoon
Who remembers the days when X Factor was better than Strictly ...
Definitely Alexandra is my favourite - she dances like a professional
what is dis
1like = your person of choice will win\nSubscribe=you’ll be on strictly
Dont watch this video .... \nI repeat its a trap. Dont watch this video\nhttps://youtu.be/W7GY8HPG-pc
I want her to win but strictly and dailymail have already decided to be Gemma. You can tell  by the way DM are trying to assassinate alexandra character and putting stories about her and gemma feuding over some guy.
She's down with the swirl 😍😍😍
Good but not a 10\n9's all round maybe.
Go girl, you are killing it 💖💟
Look at the two of them go!
Absolute knockout....which i am glad Gorka hasn't been...he left too early last year,dancing with the wonderful Tamika!
Outstanding! I couldn't take my eyes off her xx
I takes a lot for me to take my eyes off Gorka and she certainly did! Absolutely phenomenal dance, especially this early in the competition!
PRO ENTERTAINER BEING GOOD AT SOMETHING WELL WE NEVER SAW THAT COMING DID WE
That was awesome.  \nI might start watching this show now.
Her husband disliked the video 127 times
By ccr not tina turner
She’s an amazing dancer. But to pretend this is a 10 is misleading. She clearly has sickle feet. Aston (as much as I’m not a fan of his dancing, forcing as much hip hop moves in to the dance as possible), got railroaded for having pigeon toes. Not fair this was given a ten. But her energy was awesome and she is clearly the strongest dancer. Still a winner.
OMG I remember watching Alexandra win the X factor years ago when I was a kid! It's great to see her more!
Diva!!
Alex and gork, absolutely amazing, Sue 💞 🎶
great
https://youtu.be/6JYSrbqMUGg
She looks amazing !!
https://m.youtube.com/my_videos
Serious talent right there
The footwork is incredible
Alex girl you absolutely killed this performance.\nWell done you!\nGorka what can I say choreography was on point as usual.\nPower house couple. \nOne of my favourite couples to win \nRouting for you both.\nKeep it up guys.😍😍😙😗😙👌👌👌👌👌
reminds e of Alesha and also Nathalie gummede    and all the fuss because shes ccouldnt t do her jive  to this song and she was the favourite at the time
Do a good deed today and click the link to my video to help me reach 10,000 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO8EnOeMrRI
Song is by creedence clearwater revival...tina only covered it
John Fogerty was such a great songwriter.
Her legs were hypnotic! I honestly thought one of her shoes would fly off she was that slick and speedy!
That was amazing!! Perfect timing, excellent routine, choice of song brilliant - couldn't have been better!
Search reaction time and compare tal to gorka
Absolutely fantastic, said from the start Alexandra will go far, everything crossed she is in the final and wins it xx
Wow how fantastic was that well  done alexandra  and  gorka I loved it amazing
wow \nshe looked like she was enjoying that \nchannelling Tina Turner with the legs!!!\nnot an ounce of wobble!😨\n#keepfitgoals
Alexandra deserves to win this series! That's only if people stop voting for Ken & Barby!
My Grandma is obssessed with strictly come dancing
She's so sexy 😍😍

Oh dear oh dear, choreographed by Craig Revile Horwood in Sister Act and you say she's not a professional?? Shame that the comments have been removed from here regarding this.
Trouble is she ain't no amateur. West end show, coached by Craig, cheater!

Na the ex jls will be this years winner there just playingit down so he dont get top points every wk or there put him 2nd cors every one end up clocking what there up two in being winner all ready before end it all soz but no 3 tens for that i dont think so come on now
🐰If you subscribe to me and i will  subscribe back 🐰plz 🐰
Was her dress unzipped at the back?
She's been trained in dance before yet nobody's here moaning about that
Its a shame sumats going on backstage between Gemma and Alexandra all becous Gemma is sleeping with gorka noticed they are never at top with other celebs at same time sumts not right
Here is your winner boys & girls and i tipped her from the very start.
This was an ok performance but not worth the 10s given. Picking a winner at week four is both biased and a little premature.
shes a trained dancer though!!! it'd be like David Beckham playing in a celebrity football match¬!!!\n\nthe fake tears every week dont help either!
Brilliant energy, but the slide between Gorkas legs wasn't as smooth as it could have been and where were kicks and flicks ?  Also why no comment on pincy toes that seems a big deal with certain celebs?  Great dance but not a 10
She annoys me like hell. Just her face is hard to look at. She was acting stupid when she got the ten's, I wish my mum was here! and dramatically thrashing about like a lunatic. Yes, it's sad that she's lost her mum. I did sympathise at first. But someone normal who loses their mum wouldn't go on and on about it for attention on TV.  I was hoping she wouldn't be good, but there we go. She's won. The first couple to get a ten always wins. How sad.
I didn't like it...
Can you imagine the janitor comes by minding his own business and there's just some little girl with a buzzcut covered in fuckin amniotic fluid and shit crawling out of a hole in the wall

Does anyone else hate themselves for watching this
HELL YES!!! our Eleven is back!! i can't wait for season 2!
I’m here before anyone else sees it. But it’s so cool!!
my best guess is that Eleven spends the next few months in the cabin in the woods and hopper checking on her every few days and eleven keeps saying “I want to see Mike! Please let me see him!” And hoppers like “not right now it’s too risky for you to be out there again!’’
Ahhhhh OH MY GOD
Like the symbolic imagery of her being born again.
She looks like Ripley... Aliens for intro and Alien 3 for the clip... she could be in the alien reboot as newt v2.
ok clown movie you had ur spotlight, now its stranger things season and things are about to get spooookyy
YES!!!! MY badass girl is back...YOU GO EL!!!!!!

Not a fan of the super CGI red floaty bits but my god i'm excited for this! Millie is just amazing in the way she can say so much without saying anything at all. Argh I can't wait :)
This scene is so badass omg!! I can't believe they released an epic footage so early
At 0:49 I was laughing cause it’s so fucking funny how el makes that disgusted sound and continues to slowly wipe that shit off onto her dress lmao I love her 😂💞

Millie is a funny name. 🤣
The kiss blow at the end was kinda... weird... considering she's a really young kid\n\nNever change Hollywood?
Did nobody notice she looks like will in the beginning and put on a accent
I just watched a minute of some one standing by a road
I'm curious how many new Weinstein's, Cosby's are out there and still doing their thing in Hollywood but people, for now, don't say anything
For everyone to know *this video is from 2012*
0:54 - Damn that hug just screams desperation. So this basically proves most actresses prostitute themselves to rich producers just to get famous! \n\nHOLLYWOOD IS FULL OF GOLD DIGGING SLUTS JUST READY FOR THE CHANCE TO FUCK AND SUCK THEIR WAY TO THE TOP!
Storm Ophelia just blew the roof of my local football (soccer) pitch!
Number one on trending in UK is a fat pervert standing next to a road talking to two women........fantastic
THIS WAS FUCKING 2012, SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW BACK THEN!!!
Someone explain why this is trending? I know about that cunt and everything he’s done, but why exactly is THIS trending?
This video shows nothing incriminating, just Harvey looking like a creepy old man
God, Jessica is all bullshit, she's so hypocrite. My respect for courtney, she has the face of I don't wanna be here . But in the end of the day, she was there, so, her fault too.
The CIA is using this Weinstein drama to cover up Vegas.
Harvey Weinstein may be an asshole but all those hollywood actresses are just lying fakes. They literally whore themselves for a role.\nOf course not they act all outraged on twitter because the dude served his purpose.\n\nFAKE WHORES.
Y’all know this clip is from 2012 right? Before any of Weinstein’s victims came out about any of the abuse? It’s really sad seeing all these people in the comments talking shit about Jessica, especially since it was BEFORE the allegations.
Have to be honest here, Jessica Chastain  is extremely over-rated as an actress & for a shit actress she is in so many big budget Hollywood films & as the open secrets in Hollywood are coming out on a daily basis, I can see how she has been cast in so many films, the mattress on her back helps, hence the uninvited hug for Weinstein.
FFS SHE IS LITERALLY SMILING AND LAUGHING WHAT IS WRONG IN THAT OMG IT WAS IN 2012 TOOOOOO
The only reason an attractive woman would ever touch or flirt with a fat and disgusting man is if she's after his money.\n\n\n\nI know this from experience.
Paedophile who travelled from Southall to Slough to meet a 13 year old girl is caught...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqD2CDI84z8
It's easy with all the women claim to be molested by Weinstein: you fuck me, you make me famous. That was the deal. Now they feel regret and claim sexual abuse. Gimme a fucking break. I hope the entire dregs get pulled up. Destroy Hollywood
HARVEY THE DOUCHEBAG GOT AWAY WITH ALL THIS STUFF FOR SO LONG. I BET HE SAID SOMETHING TO UPSET THE ZIONISTS WHO CONTROL HOLLYWOOD SO THEY HAVE EXPOSED HIM TO RUIN HIM. WHAT GOES AOUND COMES AROUND, THATS JUSTICE. HE WAS SCREWING PEOPLE THAT DIDNT WANT IT, NOW HE IS GETTING SCREWED AND DOESNT WANT IT
Why is this on trending if it was uploaded over 5 years ago?
Hollywood whores will suck a small, circumcised kike cock for a role but cry rape when it suits them.\n\nHarvey Cum Shot for the Plant Pot Weinstein did nothing wrong even though he's a nasty kike.
Looks like he’s landed a 4some by promising lead roles for all of them #mogulpaedophile
why the hell 5 yo video is trending? wtf, YT broken again/still?

A lot of women gained their fame by being nice.. their Masters didn't mean it would be a 1 time deal though.\n#GoodOleDays

How is this 1st in trending
He’s good \nBut he’s not quite jimmy savile
Yeah but when was this?
Any context? When was this filmed?
Okay this guy abused his power no doubt but got laugh at the sluts who willingly gave him what he wanted to not risk damaging their career. Obviously their dignity and self respect went out the window with some of them

Hos still want the Weinstein weiner guess it doesn't matter what you do as long as you're rich enough
Pot calling the kettle black these dirty Hollywood perverts don't no if they are coming or going.that also includes these actresses coming forward where were you when he first did somthing why not go to the police like a normal person. You chose not to because you sold your self . Now when your other pervert masters have gone sour with Weinstein they have asked all the perverted actresses to step in all the same thing a bunch of dirty sexual preditors and hoes
How old is this though
YouTube's algorithm is awful. This should not be trending
Can not judge what happened by watching this.
Dont watch this video .... \nI repeat its a trap. Dont watch this video\nhttps://youtu.be/W7GY8HPG-pc
YouTube is a shit platform
Good to see him enjoying himself.
video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.
theres a minute video thats 5 years old of someone standing by a road on 1. trending\n\ncome on youtube get your shit together
HONESTLY YOUTUBE WTF IS THIS ON NUMBER ONE TRENDING
Woah. A video on trending that has nothing to do with Anti Trump
*The shit youtube make trending...*
Whats the meaning/point of this video?
Who are these people and why is it first on trending?

All these celebrities that have been SOOO full of virtue were ALL complicit with the sexual deviancy of Holywood. They all knew what was going on and did nothing until someone else had the balls to speak up. Actors and musicians = Hypocrites! ...Golywood is DEAD to me now.
I hate drump supporters they do shit like harvey weinstein did(rape women).. its cus of trumps attitude for women grab them by the pussy and how they can get away with this sh*t because they are rich. disgusting
What's the point in this? Like he's surrounded by women. Omg what a sinner
Why is this trending. Nothing happens, its just some people standing around...Fucking great!
Courtney Love is just like me, does not know how to disguise
Can someone do a Bad Lip Reading edit on this? Lol
Please tell me Chastain wasn't corrupted by the fat man??
0:22 when Harvey gets his cock out and starts waving it about - such a cunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou no you was looking for it though

#HarveyWeinsteinIsOverParty
Looks live Courtney Love cuddles him there... i think thats sexual harassment and she should do 25 to life...scumbag
Gross. Harvey may have raped some women, but think about the hundreds actresses who whored themselves out for movie roles and fame. Hollywood is so disgusting.
They all let it happen when they want awards/contracts and start crying when they don't need him anymore. Typical women. Doesn't change the fact that he's a weirdo and a pervert.
Now it makes you wonder did these actresses get to the top from their talent of acting or talent of sucking cock... 🤔🙈
So that's how Jessica Chastian climbed up the hollywood ladder
Luis Suarez scores late for a point! Griezmann to Barca in the summer for 100m € release clause? 🔥🔥

Ronaldo is king of football!
wtf why Gomez to starte the game because of Gomez we can't win the game we have better player dannis, deloufae n Roberto to starte the game instaed of Gomez this is first time varvelde make mistake in the squad to lose the point I hope he won't make a mistake again in the next  many game to play otherwise barca derserve to win this match
I feel the commentators were trying way too hard to pronounce the player's names in a Spanish way.
its the death of football the ball is so light and fast the keeper cant see it you rarely see anything spectacular from keepers because the ball is so fast they only can block it by instinct \n90s produced amazing players in all positions now they try to benefit attackers and dribblers as much as possible but the real highlights belong in all parts of the game\n90s and early 2000 teams used to be a lot more complete but now football is dead because all they care about is goals
Commentators are trying way too hard to pronounce the players names correctly.
Deulofeu should be starting almost all matches right now along with Denis and Roberto. Rakitic should be benched imo and give Iniesta a rest often times. Andre Gomes should also play more against weaker teams to get more confidence and keep him going. He can improve.
Why cant this commentator pronounce their names correctly😂
4.12 was that pronounced correctly? Xd
That last pass by Andre Gomes was really skillful. I wonder if he meant to bounce it on the ground
gotta say i love the commentators in this match!!

Wow this is almost as great as pubgswag.com
Wonderful class of football all round
barca had 2 great opportunities to win the match. saurez tap in and his shot that he could have passed to messi in front of him
Suarez great player but what a cunt

Atletico Madrid vs Barcelona 1-1 - All Goals & Extended Highlights - La Liga
12:55 Really?  like come on!
Barca coach is a fuck.. He like bring in paulhoo very late in games .. It just  making Great messi effort use less.. He needs to get his ass right moving forward.. Well done World Best  Messi
1 point a piece... Good
Barca Should have won that but Oblak has to be there all the time. Why is he so good
Most evil tackle... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo22Al8H7GU
/watch?v=yjgL5hVzq-o Goals \nvery nice video (Y)
It was an excellent job, congratulations team
this draw match feel angry to me viva Barca go forward
Pls coach Gomez's is 3rd player for our team Congrats to Suarez
The was he says Griezmann is annoying
This commentator is annoying
I don't know what's wrong with our couch he has given 90 mins match play for Gomez and left on the bench the likes of Paulinho, roberto and gerard delafou
Barca should have won 4-2 because griezmen goal that he begged pique was suppose to be in 2-1 Messi freekick 2-2 Messi has a chance on the edge of the 3-2 and it went couple inches wide from the post and that was a easy chance Suarez had 2 chances I will only count the one that he tapped it but oblack dived to the left and saved the one on one and the other one he slide tackled it but he arrived to late one of those so 4-2 and then the two penaltys 6-2 and Messi first chance in the first min he almost scored but went hit the side netting and there were a shirt on of players surrounding him 7-2 but that was a hard chance and we don't know what will happen after those penaltys probably a goal but lets say 4-2 u can't disagree and don't say what about griezmens shot that he shot to the right and ter Stegen saved it and hit it out for a corner that's shot wasn't going in it's really rare seeing those goals so overall game should have ended 4-2 but if I count the other ones I said 7-2
This is why i hate la liga
Barcelona is the best ever!
Didn't know Messi was such a little bitch... crying over every damn touch
we played against atletcio de madrid, one of the greatest clubs in the world, and tied to them in their new stadium. Real madrid played getafe, a small team that is barely coming back to la liga, and barely won 2-1. Real madrid fans sure are nervous when they see barca still isnt in second place lol.
No like Messi in this world

FO.. BARCA...SUAREZ A BITING DOG AND MESSI A MESSED UP MAN.... U CAN SCORE ONLY ONE TO ONE... AND IN 100 GOALS IF AND IF SCORED FROM LONG DISTANCE COMMENTETORS AND PEOPLE SHOUT LIKE CRAZY.. IDIOTS..WHO HAD WORD.... I WANT TO BE IN TEAM WHERE RONALDO IS THAT FINISHESSS ALLLLLLL...... HAHAHAHAAAHAHAAA
Barca is different from Argentina. Messi isn't always good and nice to score and be a Messiah to carry his team from disappointment. It's just a simple thing, because Messi is human. He needs to be relaxed to have the best manner. At Barca, the players around can score without Messi, but Argentina can't. This makes me so sad and unhappy.\nHope Messi will always have the best emotional before every match! <3
The Ting goes Skkkkrrrrraaa

Really looking forward to this, but they need to step it up. It shouldn't take this long to put out a season. It's not like it's cutting edge CGI and post production work. Great show, just get them out.
looks like I'm getting netflix again until this season is over
Awesome show Damn I miss the 80s!
Why am i always thinking the secuels completely ruins the original film? I hate this feelin!
I've seen Stranger Things to be honest.

instead of trick or treating in my neighborhood i will be trick or treating in the netflix app and Stranger Things season 2 is the motherload
Am I the only one looking foward to the soundtrack more than the actual show?

Im an Arsenal fan and he's not wrong with anything he said about us.
who gives a fuck what a bloke called troy thinks...shit cunt
This guy also kicked an already unconscious guy in the head on a night out.
Is the guy in the ponytail a real person ? That voice with that hair with those clothes is a peculiar combination
Man sounds like he has mucus in his throat😂😂
Omg get him on as a commentator!!! Never heard anything so real- us fans relate to guys like that- he needs to be on match of the with ian wright
Deeney says hes the man with no ego - come off it Mr self proclaimed hard man.. Also his ego has just told the arsenal defence how to play them in the return fixture...man before team
fucking humble bloke hes a perfect example for young footballers
Who is this guy?
i can just imagine Roy Keane in this arsenal team,he would be sent off every game for hitting his own team mates,this was a case of men against jelly babies
Arsenal is a failed state. They need aid and water and urgent  restructuring. But they are held captive by an evil dictator.  There's only one man who can save them.  Trump.
Deeney obviously loves his son more than anything, and I get the feeling that because his son loves Arsenal so much and is so sad when they lose, that he actually gets pissed off himself at the way Arsenal are, and the way they let the fans, including his son, down.
I dont watch any football games but I love wathcing this talk show its great
Hi, i am a new fifa 18 youtube gamer, fifa 18 and i'm trying to grow my youtube channel SUBSCRIBE! MY BIRTHDAY CAN I GET SOME SUBS PLEASE
Lol troy deeney jus told them brum style!!! Their not on it!
Way to go Troy......he is great inspiration in so many ways :)
He invited his prison friends and scored an own goal Last season
Arsenal fan but Deeney told it true. Props to him
Damn, this nigga fucked Arsenal hard. Fucking Arsenal man makes me have a heart attack every weekend
Troy is a smart guy.
Watford are doing a great job, everyone though they was going down. MARCO SILVA.#
state of savage's haircut
Respect to you Troy
Nice to see a footballer actually give a true opinion on something instead of a textbook answer. Refreshing to see!
Pillow bath European here defendant violence wave bitter down best so
How dare you Troy! Arsen just bought a packet of KPs.
If Troy Deeney can sit there and point out these flaws not long off the pitch, surely the Arsenal players themselves know that they've not got the grit or fight to ever win the league. I've never thought Wenger's failings were tactics, it's always been in his lack of mentality in leadership to incite a reaction out of his team.
is it jus me or is deeney speaking like an arsenal fan
Deeney isn’t even being a prick because he’s such a lovely guy. He’s a great leader and that’s clear.
Big up to troy. Only if more footballers were like This!
Deeney just saying everything arsenal fans have known know for a while now
Can't even get mad it's true
Bolasie scores the winner against Arsenal, then trolls arsenal on twitter by saying hes going to enjoy arsenal fan tv, Troy deeney scores against arsenal then goes on National TV and says Arsenal dont have nuts and he loves playing against them, Arsenal have been hammered by big teams so much times that now even smaller teams like watford and palace want a piece too
Deeney a Watford player is finally the first player to say what all fans think about a modern day but mostly shitty arsenal back four
90% of the likes on this video i guarantee are from Gunners
I mean yeah they won but cmon acting like Watford beat arsenal all the time...1 win yet come end of season arsenal will be around the top Watford will be nowhere near it
such a normal bloody person not some marketable twat. big up deeney
I want a mouthful of egg fart
Since when do current players come on the show? This is great. Cojones
I swear Robbie Savage has been on the drink.
It’s true the players of that club care more about their hairstyles
This is humiliation for Arse'nal Training Centre. Nobody players are telling them how they bullied them during the game and how they will bully them in future games. The best run club in the world?
Arsenals problem isn't lacking physicality Barcelona dont have physicality arsenals problem is mental all of their players r mentally weak u look at barca similar types of players but mentally strong all r winners they even get dirty busquets for eg everyone talks about his passing understanding of the game nobody talks about his defensive skills or that hes got a nasty side as well he lets opposition players know whats what everytime u play him messi iniesta mindset of winners thats y they r so successful over such a long period
He is ranting coz he does not have the skills to play for big clubs,
Love the honesty of this session.
Still a better team than Watford though
Thick as two short planks is Troy Deeney glorified pub standard player he is stealing a living
Not sure why this on my recommendations, but this dude talks way to much. Not a good look.
he backs his shit up in teh field and is hard working and honest fellow..I wish we had more players with mentality like that in Arsenal..The last goal just shows how pathetic our players are in terms of as a unit...fcukin disgrace
Deeney thinks he's it but he's right about the arse.
Do football pundits don't think that other people can read the game better than them. Worse when it's a few minutes of highlights then pundit billowing crap talk for ten minutes afterwards.\nRobbie Savage was like Vinnie Jones a mouthy gobby hacker. \nHe`s a embarrassment for humanity with his face splattered over bookie windows to encourage people to gamble into the dark lower pits of life.
Mans not hot
Stfu Deeney ur trash.
He’s excellent
Go an buy Deeney wenger  to liven your girls up
no, they don't. he f@cking ate them all by the look of him!
Fuck shade, this nigga threw the whole tree!!!!
Deeney's actually coaching Arsenal better than Wenger right now
well thought out guy
Arsenal need to step their game up! I'm a huge arsenal fan, arsenal wenger doesn't play out best striker in any games, it's disgraceful!
Big flattering ram
Someone had to say it.
Troy is running around trolling up the opposition but he's kind of right that Arsenal need to be a more ruthless team on the park. It will be a fight to make top 4 again for Arsenal I think
You know your bad when deeney scores against you 😂😂
Come on... Roast Arsenal, so they f***ing start playing to the best
fantastic getting him into the studio. very insightful, really enjoyed it. from an arsenal fan :)
Fuck off deeney you can't chat shit just cause you have won one game which is the first win in 3, years at your home ground Hahaha, 30 years at home embarrassing Watford football club
I'm an arsenal fan and I wholeheartedly concur with Troy's sentiments. yesterday's performance and result was dreadful. This current team are so mentally weak and have no sense of leadership.
This man speaks the truth 👏
1 lucky win and he gets so cockey
deeney will make a great manager ...or pundit
Brilliant interview, analysis. I'm a Deeney fan now.
As an arsenal fan this is so good to hear. Great insight. I hope the players watch this!
When an average player says Arsenal are shite, then you know Arsenal are average.
As a gooner myself I must admit that he is spot on, my club are mentally weak and for me that trickles down from Arsene Wenger.
Deeney talking big after a gifted penalty. If anything relying on the softest touch to gain a penalty is not having nuts!
Deeney for president

Troy Deeney very eloquent
Seriously though Troy Deeny plays for watford how can he be criticising arsenal like arsenal are bottom of the league? Jesus... talk about getting gassed..
Deeney needs to shut the Fuck up. His side got a gifted penalty and all of a sudden he's the guru of Arsenal futbol club.. this is a man who is starting on the bench for Watford, has never won shit and has never been good enough to play for a big club, let alone represent his country, now he's running his mouth about Arsenal and Ozil? Shut up mate.. !
loool man scores a goal afta 14 matches and thinks his the best in da leahue fukin watford bencher
this swollen drake needs to pipe down
Troy Deeney Hey nigga come to emirates bitch...We will show whose have nuts\nWinning against Arsenal B team and acting like won the epl

By looking at evidence for the Big Bang, and by studying things like neutron stars, the scientists are in fact learning something about fundamental physics.
Could've done a better job explaining, but cool animation.

Congratulations to NASA ESA ESO LIGO VIRGO VLT INTEGRAL TEAMS for this outstanding breakthrough 👍🎉🥇
Wonderful illustration
How fast do gravitational waves travel?
This is really cool. I wish it had some type of 1 second=X years indicator to showcase the sped up timeframe.
è una bellissima ripresa ... grazie di questa connessione con l'infinito.
@Nasa Goddard, Does it mean we have entered a new era of astronomy ??
The flat is earth.
The earth is flat
I can see it in the clouds🕵️
Now we have the 2nd light.
i got a qeustion correct me if I'm wrong in the 1970s we launched deep space satellite voyager 2 and i know there was a interstellar map of the location of earth with the two neutron stars now gone is the map now out of date?
From a non astronomer. If this stars are 100 million light years away does that mean it happened 100 mil years ago and the light is only reaching us now? Do not understand how they are getting sound and light at same time.

Sweet Jesus!
Veritasium video was excellent.
So much Win
i must say  Gravitational waves in the context put forth here are a clumsy  derivation of physical the  phenomenon gravitation,   gravitational waves whilst claiming to intercepting waves of hundreds to millions  of  miles in  frequency  length @ distances and time scale of hundreds of and even billions+ light years ,,  the detector is unable to show the  physical   phenomenon of earth moon sun tidal distortion  ,which according to theories of gravity generate heat(not electrical induction?) in the earth  by distortion of the entire body of the earth  a wave function of the proportional to tidal movements and spherical diameter of the earth , larger at the equator diminishing to the poles  , on the plan of the rotation of the body's,
The universe is electric. Stars, galaxies,  and planets are all formed through electromagnetism. Gravity in the sense the standard model (Relativity) presents it isn't real. If Einstein had been around for the direct empirical observations of stars forming like beads on a string in extreme high current filaments then his idea of gravity would have been much different. But now it is dogma, and physics has lost its way so so badly.
this is CG...
Somebody had to sit down with a video designer and explain what happens for visual effects, just let that sink in.
when can we hear the rendered sound it actually makes?
Kilonova?
Good morning Sir, Why neutron star collide
NASA why don’t you redeem your self by disclosing the total truth to the public. You are well known for lies omissions and deceit. Because you are under Satans gag order. Blocking the truth about the angels about celestial beings and about Jesus Christ coming to destroy the wicked and evil like your selves.
how are you able to detect these signals (gravitational pulls I think) and what does this mean for the future?
a time stamp would be nice so I get an idea of how long something like this takes, nice video though
Has the existence of a neutron star been proven ?
How long would something like this take to happen?
Is that a real image?!?\nNo. No.\nIt can't be...
There is no space we live in a box
Thus proves the earth is flat...
Congrats from a Benfica fun you are going up \o/
Diogo jota is incredible
As a portuguese is nice to see portuguese youngsters shinning on Wolves especially Jota..Wolves are going up for sure!
What a game, what a performance what a result! The wolves are going up! \n\n#COYW
You're team is far too good for the championship, definitely going up
I hope we can keep Jota...
WOLVES AY WE🔶⚫️🐺
im a aston villa fan, well done wolves good game.
It was a scintillating performance with technical ability that tore villa apart... a long way to go but that has to be a bench mark performance which if way sustain will see us promoted  !! WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS FOOTBALL CLUB  - pride of the black country  😚😚😚
Signing Jota on a permanent is the most important part of the January tranny window !
Absolutely battered them! Could have been 4 or 5 ! COYW

For the first time in ages, I watched a Wolves game and couldn't help but smile. It was like watching Brazil at times.
Clicked like before the video began. Well done Wolves! Put these wannabees in their place.
We are to good for championship COYW🔶◼️🔶◼️
Hi ho wolverhampton
TRENDING!!! COYW!!!!
premier legue 2018
🔶⬛️
Wolves aye we 🔶◾️🔶◾️
Wolves for the championship. I am a Villa fan and I have no problem in realising that wolves are just too good for this league. Then ran the game, we had no chance. That Jota guy was immense, he would just pick up the ball and instantly turn on are defenders. Looks like a mini Griezmann.\nEven though people were predicting Villa as champions, I honestly saw us as playoffs, I do think we will achieve this but it will be hard.\nI know this might sound weird, but I would love to see us, Wolves and Birmingham pack in the prem, because them the derbies would be in a league where they do belong.\nFair play Wolves, you are a lock for the championship, great team, great fans, great coach.\n\n#UTV\n#COTW
champions league football... here we come...
Nice one Wolves from a baggies fan 😀
I`m glad Wolves are doing well but I`m really sad David Edwards is not at Wolves anymore. What a great and committed  player for Wolves he was!
Could we get this without the fake after-the-event commentary? Someone who knows the players' names and can at least feign some interest?
The force is strong in these lads! 🔶⬛️🔶🔝
John terry is a bawbag
DIRTY SCUMBAG HUTTON KICKED CAVILEIRO ALL OVER THE PARK AND WE ALSO HAD A STONEWALL PENO SHOUT. WE GOIN UP ANYHOW, C'MON ME BABIES ;-)
Wolves squad is too good for the Championship, they will def lift the trophy in the end, can't wait to play in the Molineux in FIFA 19 ~~
The commentator is great at stating the bleedin obvious isn't he? it's headed over.. it's...just wide. I know you have to tailor things to your audience but even your average Wolves fan can see that!
Proud of these boys, ay we?
Well done wolves proud of you
I am a walves  fan we are going up this season don't think we're finished top second place I reckon and we are going to the Champions League bring on Barcelona and Real Madrid win them all
We will give City a run for their money
Second goal was handball surely. Deserved win though
I knew it was 2-0 begore video probably because i went and watched it at the stadium #WolvesForever
WOLVES AY WE - who are ya who are ya , thought you were gona crash our party - COME ON WOLVES our time is coming
Wolves aye we
Portugies all players are so good in wolves club the club have so many skillful players thanks the club it makes portugies team better
Completely outplayed them this is our year 🐺🐺🐺
Great win guys can you check out my little boys football channel little superstar thank you
Done me proud yesterday keep it up wolves ☝️😃😃😃😃😃😃
Good game, awful commentator, he barely even mentions any of the players names
WERE WOLVERHAMPTON, WERE TOP OF THE LEAGUE!
Just the best football I've seen in a long long time and that includes Premier league and Champions league. Diogo Jota and Ruben Neves are world class players and the whole team is superb. Fantastic football and a wonderful time for Wolverhampton Wanderers FC and I love it
Well done wolves shitty villa fans

Resultado injusto, el Barca mereció ganar el partido :v
Porquería de resumen: en que no viera el partido parece que sólo jugó el atlético. No sacaste más jugadas del Barça como el penalti a Messi. Dedícate a panadero, esto no es tu fuerte.
Piqué debería salir y pedir perdón a toda España, sería la única manera en que los pitos cesaran un poco, por que esto tiene pinta de que en cada provincia que vaya serán pitos y mas pitos
vaya puta mierda de miniatura un payaso provocando a la grada que inutil

Solo ponen las ocasiones del Atleti o que? Y la primera de Messi en el minuto 1?...
Cuidado que pega como cotto\nNo sé cómo llegué aquí
Bien por Suarez callando a los españoles xd
Fue un buen partido y el resultado lo vi mas o menos justo por lo que se vió, en los últimos minutos si hubiéramos aprovechado varias ocasiones de gol probablemente hubiéramos ganado el encuentro.
Que pena el barca estuvo a nada d ganar
Bonito partido 👌\n\nMuy buena segunda mitad del Barsa :D
Vaya Criticas a la celebración\nA sido igual que Messi al bernabeu o Raúl al Camp nou\nCada uno celebra los goles como quiera

Cruz Azul y el barca están igual
Puto vampiro de mierda que se vaya a comer pollas el jugador mas guarro de la historia de la liga y hasta que no acabe la mafia de la liga con sus presidentes corruptos siempre recibira ayudas este mierda club
Soy del Madrid y hubiera merecido que ganará  el barca  porque el Atleti es una mierda verlo jugar marca o algo y a la defensiva,eso no lo hace ni el Málaga xd
*HALA*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MADRID*
Suárez es dios
Common play torres at the start not as a sub.. Torres is really ruining whatever career he has left by staying at athletico.\nThe playing style of athletico doesn't suit torres a bit and that is destroying torres
Jaaajj Luis Suarez is a boss, shut the fuck up wanda
Que grande Suárez mandando callar para darse un poco más de importancia por que actualmente no está entre los 20 mejores delanteros
Messi el mago ,,desaparecida buahahaha 😝🖕🏽
Estos culerdos son un disco rallado,son tan aburridos que solo saben decir que Mezzi es el mejor de la historia,aunque empaten
Como siempre el atletico es griezman y el portero y 9 mas
Fursbol,deporte de niñatos campeones en tirarse y fingir,de ultras,donde todo vale,piedes subirte a una valla con un nene de cuatro años a decir bobadas que encima de aplaudirte te sacan en el dia despues,donde once pisa praos de octava categoria reciben mas ayudas que auteticos campeones de otras disciplinas olimpicas,que ademas,al llegar los juegos y quedar cuartos a todos estos fursboleros que no empataron con nadie a nada en su miserable vida les parece un fracaso de la hostia guiados por esos iluminados del marca y del chiringuito,esos Hermel y Roncero,archi conocidos por sus exitos y conocimientos(e imparcialidad :) ).Si un deporte de mierda,con una inmensa mayoria de aficionados de mierda,con unos valores de mierda,para una sociedad que apesta a mierda.Eso sin mencionar lo ladrones y defraudadores que son,ni de los MILES de millones de euros que deben estos hijoputas a Hacienda(o sea,a todos)Un delirio,pero como por el fursbol la masa traga lo que sea,desde pagar un dineral por un partido de ful un lunes a las diez,hasta justificar lo injustificable(peleas de ultras,jugadores delincuentes,presidentes defraudadores )una joya el futbol,vamos...
Hala Madrid!!
Man city are buying Messi
Madre mía Griezmann...
Barsani hər halına sevirəm
AUPA ATLETI
Atleti demostrando otra vez las sucias ratas que son. Su fútbol es de vergüenza y que la afición lo apoye es denigrante. Así NUNCA serán grandes. Que fútbol más SUCIO.
El hándicap es real
00:53 si eso entraba ... 😱
A quien ace callar el payaso ese de suares es un empate y lo ace ni que ubiesen ganado la liga le falta mucho para acer callar que payasos por favor esos cules que payasos an sido siempre y son por eso tienen 5 champions y nosotros 12
Messi ya no juega como antes pero cuando esté en la selección argentina juega bien pero cuando está en la Barcelona no juega bien habrá que pasa a Messi con ganas Messi
El Farza tan sortudo como siempre 😂😂😂

Joe's fans are some of the best and most loyal fans on YouTube!!! If any of you have time to check out my vids I'd appreciate it so much 🔥
video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.
i can see pink and white
Too bad you didn't get an infection and die. Aw well, your career will die way before you do anyway so there's at least that as a silver lining.

Everyone has demons.
Probably the first marvel movie I won't watch
That can't be sunspot in the laundry. His powers only work when he charges up from the sun.. wolfsbane and Magik look wicked. I thought Cannonball was gonna be blonde 😂 he's an ok actor. Love stranger things.
w8 is this xmen sorry if i get it wrong
lol i thought this was x men
Make sure to dislike the video\nProbably the worst marvel film
Is this a Horror movie or a Sci fi action flick? I didn't like what I saw.
I didn't know marvel was in the horror industry
Looks really interesting, too bad that its a horror movie.
Is that bjork in the thumbnail
What have they done to the new mutants
I figured this would be about Laura and the other X-23s. still looks pretty cool tho
An X-men horror movie? Hmm I dunno about this one
About time we get a horror super hero movie i was waiting for venom but this will suffice
Real question are these suppose to be the mutants that survived Logan??
I thought trailers were meant to induce excitement, not total indifference.
I'm confused is this suppose to be a horror film or a movie about the new x-men mutants?
Looks like a Horror Film 😞😞
I know James Mcavoy is the only one returning from the first class crew . I think Mr. Sinister is the villain in this or it's Dark Phoenix
The New Stranger Things | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX
Now let me quickly explain the four meanings of the word Dark\nDark-----as in a dark color or lighting\nDark-----as in Batman type of Dark and Brooding\nDark---- as in expression such as They are currently in the dark of what's actually going on\nDark---- scary and morbid such as this movie trailer
Am I the only one sick of these superhero movies coming out. Logan was a nice end to the genre.
Could be decent. I dont know. I do think the concept of a horror superhero story is really interesting, though.
pink floyd another brick in the wall if any of you are wondering
With this, Deadpool, Logan, and the tv show Legion, thank you Fox. Thank you for making weird, experimental, no artistic limit superhero/comic book films. Let Avengers do them, just continue making films that actually have a possibility of getting nominated because they're actual art instead of regular blockbusters.
I'm a simple man, I hear Pink Floyd I press like...
Just deciding to throw away all that good will from Deadpool and Logan now Fox?
if there going the horror route with this, does that mean in New Mutants 2 or 3 if this does alright, we might get to see the Inferno Story line since Illyana Rasputina was in the trailer.   were She rules over the Horror demons from hell.  that would be kind of cool.    \nanyway, Dani Moonstar is one of my favorite x-men so i am really looking forward to this, and I heard the demon bear saga this is based off was pretty good..
if there is a line in the movie like i dont need  no arms around me or i dont need no drugs to clam me im going to walk out of the theater
I wasn't expecting horror. But I am so into it! ❤
What happened to the uplifting and fun xmen this just looks like another basic horror film.
Idk how i feel abour this its a horror story about the kids it is a cool concept of what the mutants have to go through as kids but i feel like the movie is going to drag the story along and not have anything meaningful happen until another movie if they have one
The freakiest thing is that one of the teenage mutants is unknowingly causing a great deal of the horror in this
So dumb question maybe but does this have anything to do with the x men? I just can't tell
Is this a tv show or a movie?
Looks awesome to me, great cast too!
I'm here because Pink Floyd - Another Brick In The Wall sent me.
interesting...looks like they are going for a Horror Vibe instead of the superhero thing
Can we confirm that's 23?
So Thomasin finally went to hell.
hes not even buckeld in on the road...
Not sure if this will be good or not from the trailer. >.> i hate boring horror's and for some reason im getting that vibe. But Logan was by far the best superhero movie ever so, i'll wait! don't disappoint ;)
Overdramatic talking, edgy remix of a popular song as a soundtrack, jumpscares, jumpscares, screaming. I'm bored already...
WOW thats marvel!\nNever thought marvel would ever be horror not even fox
Is that Pink Floyd I hear?
Definitely going to see this.
This is a xmen movie???
Ladies and Gentlemen, we bring you.... X-Men: Days of Future F*ck That
I wanna go inside the mind of the guy who hears Pink Floyd and says you know what, this would be great in a trailer for a horror movie but only if it were sung really slow and creepily by a children's quire
Well. Now that that's over I'll go back to praying Fox somehow gives Marvel their franchises back so we can have more comic movies to watch and less comic movies to skip.
I wonder if this would work as a Netflix show rather than a movie?
Wait, so is this going to be a horror movie?
Can't wait for this season of American Horror Story to drop! American Horror Story: X-Men, looks lit!!
Jumpscares do not equal horror. Horror makes chills run up your spine, and only up, not down...they'd be too afraid to go back down.
Tbh at first, I thought this was a new TMNT movie.
So that's it huh? We some kind of New Mutants?
A horror story angle as an origin story works for them. There's a demon witch, a werewolf, 3 pryokinetics, one possesses people, and one turns people's fear into an illusion. I like it.

arya stark is a warg
Xmen in horor version
What?
Interesting horror-styled trailer.
Weird
deaaaaam is so sad, -0 hype
American Horror Story: X-Men
Looks like Stranger things
Dude is that Arya??
Series or Movie?
:/
Jump Scare the movie...
Spoiler.  It's Magik.
More like Stranger Mutants
SERIOUSLY?!??!?!?
What you do now Netflix? :v
Are they\n\n\n\n\nTeenage mutant ninja turtles?
New mutant saga being !?
Llama llama drama mama
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!
Pick another song already!
I didn't see Magik. The new mutants without Magik is blasphemy and I spit on this trailer.
I don't think I have seen marvel do a horror movie.
It's framed like a horror movie?\nI mean I guess. Still loses 2 points off-the-bat for just being Fox. The best I can hope for is an 8/10.
It will be horror movie
I would think We don't need no thought control would be a better quote from that song...
So what, a horror movie?
do the children actually have powers? or is this just another horror movie with kids in a haunted house?
A Marvel horror thriller starring Arya Stark and Jonathan Byers? Count me in.
I want a Super Hero movie, not some shitty horror film. This is only relevant because it had the Marvel seal of approval slapped on it
Este trailer es de una película de terror, no de una película de Mutantes.\nEl título está mal, espero y no sea lo que parece.
looks like a cheap cashgrab
Maybe blaming all men in your title, just maybe, divides us all even further and is 100% sexist and misleading? Just fucking maybe? Are you part of the problem just because you are a male? No? Huh thats interesting...stop promoting sexist bullshit.\n\n\n(This only applies for the title. Not watching the video because of that) \n\nFor the record...it's a human problem.
the episode is needed but the Petty Joke thing is lame.
im caught between ideally we ought to live in a world where men and women have equal power vs realistically youre just whining about the problem but not accomplishing anything beyond getting likes on facebook.
lol..but what happens when you don't do things like this? you get accused of being gay? it's called a paradox of fuckwittary. you have to have sex at some point is that correct, but maybe they could stop stealing all the women. what code do you live by if this is the case. are you interested? no..going to get loads of no's.if they say no though do stop.though they should stop the peado's..
I'm so glad that Cracked is here to remind us that this issue has absolutely no nuance, just like every other issue.
What about all the pedo female teachers you heard about all the time. Seems like there's a new one every week. What about all the fake rape allegations that women use to get what they want, seems there are plenty of warped people of either sex out there.
This host is the hardest thing to watch without cringing. Terrible shit.
Go fuck yourselves. Not all men are rapists and sexual perverts you pieces of shit. Im not. Hollywood IS the fucking problem, the place is virtually organised fucking crime. Jesus h christ is guy at Cracked incorporated a fucking beta nu-male who whines about how evil and le mysoginist their sex is. Go suck on your girlfriends' cocks you pathetic excuse for men. Your show is nothing but a platform for the mainstream liberal establishment.
Rose McGowan's twitter is amazing. She's my new hero.
Very well stated Cody!! This is a horrible, pervasive problem with victims of all genders, ages, and cultures, nationalities, & races. Victim blaming and shaming has GOT to stop, and every single person has to take responsibility for their actions.
This video is awesome. Favorite show on youtube.
Hard hitting, thank you for your hard work.
The women allowed it , greedy fame hungry slags
Closet Homosexual male tells Straight Males what to do and what not to do around Females stay on your side of the fence and shave that beard no amount of facial hair will make up for that whimpy Estrogen laced voice you little bitch to many empowered little fluffers like you bringing other males down these days with your weakness.
I was hoping that title was ironic. Couldn't have been more disappointed.
That's it. Final straw.  Batman is dead to me now
Stop saying it's about power in a financial or influential sense. Broke ass men harass and abuse too, because of their own insecurities and *doot doot* lack of power.\n\nGreat vid still.
The duck joke is a nice touch. With any luck he doesn't also have a 9 inch exploding corkscrew penis too.
Cody Johnston is going to commit suicide if you make him keep doing this show.
Funny that. \n\nTerrorist attacks are a majoritively Muslim problem: its not all Muslims!\n\nMost murders committed against black people in the US are committed by black people: its the white man and the police! \n\nPoor immigrants rape Women in Europe: not all immigrants! thats stereotyping and generalisation!\n\nOne rich white executive gets caught out for sexual harrassment / rape: its all men.\n\nMy age old motto: Equality - only when it benefits you.
It's a power problem not a men problem. The Right is defined by power. Hollywood is a major institution of power and thus inherently part of the Right. A minority of the Right will occasionally hold views simpathetic to the Left but that doesn't make them part of the Left. Not that they need to be. The Left can certainly use support from the Right.
only america could give itself a 5 billion dollar debt
As a man I have to say I have been sexually assaulted by a woman >=[ She grabbed my dick, no consent, I enjoyed it lol Still happens to men tho! some probably don't enjoy it.
I love how Cracked acknowledges why it's so hard for victims to come forward. Yet totally drops it when it comes to bystanders who have the same fears.
Liberal Hollywood is the problem not men you cuck.
90 per cent of powerful people are psychopaths.
Yeah just felt the need to throw out the idea that maybe Rose McGowan doesn't belong on THAT high of a pedestal, Cody. I mean she did willingly work with a convicted pedophile and that open secret wasn't even a secret.
As someone that has been sexually assaulted by a woman, I think I can safely say, fuck your sexist bs
Being petty ironically is still being petty
Actually it IS a Hollywood problem - and by extension a Liberal Problem. Liberalism is the Cancer of Western Civilization, the sooner America gets rid of it the better. And quite frankly i could care less about most of those women - apart from the fact that most of them are trash - they pretty well knew what they were doing, exchanging sex for roles.
Petty Joke Junction = Lazy ad hominem jokes = Par for the course
It’s a JEW problem.
I like how you make this about the Weinstein story about Trump then hypocritically complain about people bashing Trump when it's not related.  Also for misreporting someone being banned from Twitter for sharing someone's private number, I mean speaking out . . .
9 out of 10 people approve of gang rape.
Let us forget for a moment that American 'Females' commodify their own bodies and don't believe in subjective relationships anymore but prefer the trade for trade of objectivist capitalism over romance. Let me guess, no one has seen a single attention seeking post on media apps where 'females' are asking how do I look? I'm ugly that's just smart 'females' getting losers to appraise them so they can figure what they're worth. It's men try seeing the whole picture... it's humanity's fault.
Yes is a Hollywood problem you really think he is the only one doing this? pleas\nfull of predators and this is not men problem woman do it too
No it's a Hollywood problem.
hannity looks like he's more interested in little boys
Why have i never seen this channel before, this guy everything everyone needs to listen to
It's a power problem, not a men problem.\n\nIs crime a black problem because  minorities commit more prime proportionately in comparison to whites (ignoring the rather large issue of street culture)?
just looked at the like/dislike ratio. i see the gamers have arrived
Also this is the first feminist propaganda piece I've seen by a man
How dare you drag Scrooge McDuck's good name through the mud like you have.
Look at all these sad boys pretending to be men and getting their feelings hurt because someone made them feel bad.
Oh no I just entered an echo chamber !   \nCUCK !.........Cuck, cuck !  \nCUCK !.............Cuck, cuck !
An aggressive overture sounds like something Mahler would write. Am I right?! Wakka Wakka?\n\nI had to make some joke that didn't involve all of the awful shit, and sadly that was the best I could come up with...
So if you're a victim of Harvey Weinstein and you don't speak out then that's okay for reasons like conflicts of interest, but if you know because it was an open secret then you should use your platform to speak out. Okay, well whats missing is consistency.
Despite the depressing nature of the news, I'm now tuning in religiously every week.  Cody rocks the house.
Ben Affleck? The asshole from Fashionable Male? He looks like a date raper!
If it's a men problem, then why do I see female teachers convicted for this shit in the news on a regular basis? God damn Cracked, you're good on comedy but terrible on politics. This is what happens when you choose loyalty to a political party over the truth.
Savage! Love you guys. Right on the nose with everything
Just a man problem ballshit rape and pedophilia is rife in Hollywood,Hollywood is a sick predator unit to rape and kill woodbe actor's and actresses for satanic rituals everyone know it it's been going on for.over 40 yrs fact. And you are an apologist for the pedophile elites of Hollywood Weinstein is being sacrificed to keep others out of the lime light
This episode was so laced with inconsistencies that it makes me glad I don't get my news from cracked.
No, it's a scumbag problem. You idiots who try to lump all men into the scumbag category only reveal what disgusting monsters you are. \n\nFuck you, Cracked.
Maybe so many woman didn't speak out because he got them parts in movies. \nSo it's more like a: Ok, I need to fuck this guy once but I'll make a few millions of movies and get famous. \n*Almost everyone has a price* .
Any male who's ever rented a Lambourgini or a Ferrari will tell you of the army of sluts that throw themselves into your path, make their way to be in your way, then into your passenger seat uninvited....they are simply wealth groupies....and if you tell them you are poor or simply say NO!! ...omfg...HELL HATH NO FURY.!!...truley.
People are saying Men problem when it should be Man...grammatically the video title and everyone commenting sound awful.
why isn't there a 'terrorism isnt a western problem, its a muslim problem.' video?
I don't like being outlined as a supporter of rape because I'm a man. If there are people that are supporting weinstein regardless of the evidence please don't put me in that box. It's uncomfortable and full of rapists.
Hahahah it's definitely just Hollywood you fucking shills cracked is ran by LEFTIST SJW trash and now oh it's not all those rich pricks in Hollywood it's just men hahaha yeah suck some more corporate dick you fucking garbage
This episode made me realize this would work really good as a comedy series. You all should hire some comedy writers and make it funny instead of annoying.
Such a shit channel with a cucked audience speak for yourself you sexist cunt
Yes, it is my problem that hollywood is filthy den or rapist and peodfiles, that why i support them by watching there movies. *looks at pirated movie collection* oh, wait....
holy shit, Louie CK?? noooo now I need to look into this and now I'm gonna hate him forever
Wow, you don't pull punches. Nice work.
If you read this, don't go down in the comments. There's pissbaby men down there actually taking the talking point of the majority of people who commit sexual assault are men, and society overwhelmingly has men in power who are complicit but can also do something about it, so if you're a good man you'll at least speak out and help stop this culture, as saying all men are personally rapists and evil. Which is extra weird cuz if someone calls an adult something they know they're not (sexist/racist/an alien from the planet Xxylorpb), they get confused but move on. The adults that get mad.....kinda look guilty.
Every day is another trip up the river into the heart of Darkness.
Literally one the best things I have ever learned from this channel that was also covered in another video is the fight,flight, friend, freeze, flop thing. Nothing has helped reaffirm my self worth through my own traumatic experiences, than learning that fact, in these videos. This channel is a gift.
Kudos news person. Obviously the best Cracked series currently available. Keep making me laugh at the tragedy all around me!
That moment when Cracked becomes more depressing than the news...
Actually it's not a men problem.  It is not the fault of every man on the face of the Earth if some disgusting asshole never learned how to treat other human beings with the respect they deserve.  It is the fault of that disgusting asshole.
I agree, we don't need so many actors and comedians ranting about how much Trump sucks.
Shaming men for this behavior is like shaming woman for skimpy outfits. Fuck off! People are assholes and both genders do it, and both even cry wolf about it at times. This IS a Hollywood problem. I will get personal here.. when I was a teen I groped a girl while drinking with her. She told me to stop and I did... but she told everyone! It was the best thing that could have happened. I learned my damn lesson and was an social outcast for a while. I decided to be a fucking man and never do that again, to be a protector and not an animal. Its been ten years, and not once I have I done anything even close to that again. To add to that I also have stories of when I WAS the victim of sexual abuse by females. I was a good looking guy, and a few times at parties I used to be grabbed at or grinded on without my consent. So again its both genders. These Hollywood guys are habitual though, they know they can get away with it and if caught wont face shit.. and when you have power they let you do it.
No one going to mention Howard Stern?
Can we all just agree people with money & power are total immoral assholes and stop worshipping them already?!?
If men are the problem, why hasn't the smarmy excuse for a journalist on this video shot himself in the head to help resolve the problem?  Liberals are the most divisive racist group of people in history.  When liberals keep losing elections, remember, it's because their financiers and leaders are America haters like Soros, pervs like Weinstein, pedophiles like Podesta, criminals like Hillary, rapists like BILL, failures like Obama, and absolute losers like this douchebag on the video constantly preaching trump hate and anti-American propaganda.  Someone please take this douchebag to Chicago, St. Louis, or Baltimore, at night, and dump him out of the car, so the blacks can show him how much they like a liberal who is 'down with the cause'.
In defense of Twitter.. they did not silence Rose McGowan for her words, she either intentionally or mistakenly published a private phone number in one of those tweets. That was the reason, they were in touch with her team and they removed the number and the account was unfrozen. The whole thing lasted 12 hrs. Yes, the optics were horrible as Twitter took too long to respond as they just put up the generic statement on the account.. but they were not wrong, it just looked wrong and all is good. It was just unfortunate.\n\nI was angry too when I first saw it happen to her for speaking out when so much goes and is fair game on Twitter already.. So I had to come correct a similar mistake here.. doxxing, even accidental, is a line they should not allow. So at least in this, they are not at fault in my humble opinion. Yours may differ.. and that's fine.
The only time certain groups seem to think rape matters is if it's by muslims or US liberals in power.
I remember when I was young I used to watch Animal Hospital with Rolf Harris, when I was older and he was arrested for molesting children, I was shocked... But people the generation above me weren't. One person said to me oh yeah Rolf has always been on the fiddle (I live in a society of poets, you know)\nIt was so jarring to see how many people knew that this man was a paedophile and how accepted that fact was. As if it was just another fact of life. The sky is blue, fish live in water, there are known paedophiles on children's T.V.
Isn't it a power problem? Let's not be sexist here.
This isn't gendered, stop trying to make it one. Your point about Terry Crews destroyed the whole video, in this very video.
Fight, Flight, Flop, Freeze, or Friend.\nThank you. I didn't know about this until now.
This guy is PC principal? I swear that South Park based their character on this clown.
Fuck all other comedy news shows & news outlets, Cody Johnston just slamed them all to shit.  G** Dam it!
I thought when I clicked over that the dislike ratio would be sky high thanks to the title. Instead, this video honestly blew me away.
Why didn't these women just beat him up and knock his ass out? I mean all things being equal # feminism.  How weak are these woman? In the face of feminism they should be ashamed to be victims ! So men and women aren't equals? I'm confused you want us to hold the door for you or knock your asses out when you get physical?  The guys a Hollywood perv. What's new? I'm not blaming these people but the tip off was  come to my hotel room to negotiate your contract.
Louis CK is a piece of shit who literally uses his power as a comic, comedy writer, and successful Hollywood producer to sexually assault women, while also using his comedy as a means to get away with saying terrible shit on stage like the N word, FA***t, and others and get laughs.
I'm pretty sure the guy isn't trying to shame man for being man. The thing he seem to be focus on was shaming men who sexually harass women and those who known about it and did nothing. But I think the thing is most of us don't want to acknowledge these sort of things unless there are some cheap political points to score. I hate to think that one of my favorite comedian (CK) is doing horrible things like that and would be easier just not to think about it and that's an problem. It's so much easier to say that these women are just trying to get money/fame/attention/ ruin the man career/etc. we need to condemn those who harass other instead of making excuses for them. Like he said, instead of talking about how much trump sucks, an actor should call out those in his own industry. Sure Harvey Weinstein is being condemn but what about those who aren't but just as guilty as he is. In fact, one of them is in the White House and another one was in it before him by a few decades
Pro Tip: Don't complain about Ben Affleck preaching to the choir about Donald Trump when you're preaching to the choir about Donald Trump.\n\nBoth of them can go fuck themselves, but come on. Hold yourselves to the same standard.
Also I love petty joke junction....but it makes me sad that this may be the only roasting these trash piles masquerading as humans.
I can't express how much I love this series.
Awsome (the vid, not the subject matter) ;)
Came just to dislike
Oh aren't men terrible!
Cody is sexist.

These petty jokes
#notall
Actually it's a power problem
I love how triggered you alt-right fucks got over this one. Trump's 100% guilty as are all those other right-wing assholes.  As you would be, if you could ever touch a woman.

Amazing voice, never a disappointment. Can't wait to see her next year in So Cal.
This woman is such a inspiring person \nLove her
She is and always true to herself. She is who she is, she is strong, she is a mother, she is a wife, she is a badass, she is so talented and she is what girls should aspire to be like!
Please don't leave me, P!nk.
My god I love her. She has a powerhouse vocalistm she is a wonderful human being. She I'd bad ass. I am seeing her live in May and I fucking cant wait
She's always been great!
Her hair is effortlessly amazing all the time.
I like Pink because she can sing WITHOUT auto tune, meaning she has actual talent. As far as what ANY singer or actor has to say politically, economically, or socially, don't care and don't want to hear it in any manner shape or form, any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
*_PINK IS THE BOMB!_*
My dream is to sing on that stage one day....
didnt know she was a Somalian pirate.
I know this is random but her guitarist back there looks just like Kristen Wiig! Lol and of course Pink is amazing as usual. 💓
Love her so much❤
Do a good deed today and click the link to my video to help me reach 10,000 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO8EnOeMrRI
god damn this song is annoying, they play it on the radio constantly
Can't believe this shit is popular, music and politics should stay separated
She kills it every time. She can't do any wrong in my book. She is amazing
Legit thought snl was about to make fun of pink and I was like how tf are u gon make fun of a great song
And I want that outfit!!!!
Pink is amazing all her songs are amazing LEGEND 💜💜💜
I don't like it when stars plagiarize the King MJ
I'm just back from holidays in Spain where I heard this for the first time and I'm obsessed with it by far my favorite pink song.
WHERE IS THE JAY-Z SNL PERFORMANCE? UPLOAD IT.
p!nk4ever
p!nk💕
She’s awesome😀...the colour...not so much haha
That voice...........!!!!!
My heart. ♥
P!nk for president! <3
❤
fukin love this so hard
Pink for president!
GETTT ITTT!!! Yasssss!!!!!
She sounded flawless
Ugh! Yes, Alecia!
Pink is SUPER butch
🌎 earth vs trump !
I had no idea she was that good. Wow. Great band. Really great backup singers.
Love this amazing, freakishly talented lady. Saw her on tour in 2013 and hoping to see her again! I love the fact she sings LIVE, no auto tune BS!!!
P!nk is such a M!LF  #SNL43
You should sing opera, Pink.  Great band.
gawd almighty-- what a set of pipes.....does play an instrument?
A great singer and songwriter. Love her
Damn...I'm 33 and P!nk has been badass since I was in high school.
Does anyone know what she's wearing? That coat she has looks amazing.
Incredible voice.
Speechless.
How does her voice just keep getting better?
Brittany Mariah and all the other fake ass singers this is how you sing live and not lip sync
Is that her real voice ... Because wow.
Can't wait to see her in Abu Dhabi 2017 F1. X.
Beautiful song from a  beautiful lady,
Thats how you own the SNL stage. amazing
UMMMM... 😮 amazing performance...! I can't help but feel like there is a deeper meaning to her lyrics and she's talking about how we as global brothers and sisters have been lied to and deceived by the few elite who are actually in power... F U, ROTHSCHILD, ROCKEFELLER ZIONISTS BANKERS ETC!!
The way she interacted with her backing singers nearly brought a tear to my eye. What an authentic beautiful inspiring woman.
P!NK is the new black)))...breathtaking, amazing, real, timeless...just superb!!!
that's what i call music
2:38 WOW.... just awesome combo ✌👏
👏👏👏👏
Real non fake pop star.
And I love that all but two members of her band are\n female.  Empowerment!  Women can rock!

Not a lyrically diverse song, especially when the title of song makes up 48% of the lyrics.
I thought Pink was gonna do Michael Jackson's earth song. Bummer.
This is so dad...:(
#atheism
Poor Floptina.
Whoa - Pink got beefy.
There is no us, don't take it personally
Turns into Walter White at 4:10
Oh God, he is so damn good at telling stories!!
He didn't play Hal from Malcolm in the middle. He IS Hal from Malcolm in the middle!
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.
Who else read the title as Bryan Cranston Got Caught Having A Sex Tunnel In The Alps
Anyone else notice Colin Farrell has his Fantastic Beasts haircut? I hope he comes back, he was one of the best parts (Much better than Johnny Depp).
Hitman really let himself go
He reverted back to the hilarious Hal from Malcolm in the Middle days
 Say no more 
Graham is better than any American talk show host. Easily. Stupid scripted yanks.
Wow his story telling skills are great.
Maybe the travel agent said 15 and hopeful Brian Cranston heard 50 xD
Cranston always tells the best stories. Had Cumberbatch and Redmayne on the floor last time. That countdown to the sex tunnel was hilarious! 😂
Bryan Who?
Just how?
Best story teller ever! love him!
I could listen to Bryan tell this stories for ages!! XD
So night shows can talk about sex but invidual creators will get punished for it?
hasn't the guy got any shame? if I caught someone exposing themselves in front of my kids, I'd beat the granny out of them.
I'd love to see Bryan and Colin in a movie together
Colin Farrell: Hold my beer.
Such a likeable guy.
Recycled by Colbert interview.......
He is a great story teller!
HELP! PLEASE HELP ME GET TO 10,000 VIEWS WITH NO SUBS!!!
What a legend celebrity of our times a one worthy of celebrity title

How can you not love Bryan Cranston
That was a really good train noise
I’m just seeing and hearing Hal
Robin??? His frank underwood's wife claire his real life wife?
His voice is amazing!!! A la morgan freeman
And then he took meth.
The description is legit.
i like how he is pants in america but says trousers in the uk..
been watching Graham Norton since V Graham norton on channel 4 , who remeber when Big Brovaz came on
So you could say, he found a stranger in the alps..
norton show best
Should of have had him on the red chair!
What I love about ‘The Graham Norton!” The guest combinations , I came to see the guy from breaking bad , also got Nardole (Matt Lucas)
I'll take 15 minutes with Colin anywhere under any conditions.
Thank God for Collin's reactions lol
You know what would be funny, if we found out he had sex with an alp in a tunnel.
I would invite him to my party!
he told this story in a interview like a year ago
Tunnelling a tunnel in the tunnel.
Maybe the agent said 15 minutes, but he heard 50.
I Love You So Dam Much Graham Norton!
Hahah he’s so good at story telling 😂👌🏾
I can't stop laughing at his impression of italians 😂 so on point expecially the gesture at 3:59
Mute the sound. Bryant's visual action is more interesting and easy to understand lol
Bryan really knows how to tell a story. He is brilliant!!! :D
SEE WHAT HAPPENS\nWHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS
I can see the memes
best story teller, him and Chris Pratt
Colin’s hair looks awesome! Very 90s. I love it.
Bryan is not Walter white but he really hal
Guys who play serious roles on TV are the most funniest people irl
Dont watch the video, just watch 1:50
Say no more. -Bryan Cranston 2017

Great story. Xx
Amazing story :D
All hail Bryan Craston for this story XDXD
Awesome
Say no more fam.. 😂😂😂
Say my name
Say no more 😂
lol hes a natural...
What a weird story to tell lol didn't think he'd go into details lol god damn it Hal! Lois must've been mad
He is the one who knocks.Makes sense 😂😂
What does Colin Farrel say at 4:38 ?
I love how he told this story word for word on Conan a couple months ago. Cranston you dirty dog
Or did his wife say stay out of my territory!
Ukh that farrell such a hillbilly... doesn't know how to act in public... go dig up some potatoes 🥔....
Must say ., Brian's 📓 makes a great *read., \n\nSadly, no bits @ v% 🌹🎦 event., or London specifically., wit 'Malcolm [ the Middle 📺🎬'. \n\nGlorious last line by moi Total *mC2F by Colin. 💙😎
This would have been an awesome if they hadn't had Bryan Cranston on the show. He is intolerable.
Bryan Cranston is a SOCIALIST LIBERAL QUACK who wants to DESECRATE places because he’s a LIBERAL and LIBERALS destroy everything and want to destroy a generation of proud Christian republicans like myself.\nNO TO SOCIALIST QUACKS\n\nTRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP
The Heisenberg part of Bryan's brain kicked in when he said Get Off Me
From his gestures and that cross that he made I can totally belive Colin is gay
Argo w Ben
SATANIC HOLLYWOOD
Too short, I wanna know more
Such a beautiful, talented and humble man. I wish him the best.
He definitely has no more charisma than Paul McCartney had in the 60' or even nowadays so he will never be the new Paul McCartney thank god. 
My baby is using lipstick 👄
Zayn is the real inspiration here. Remember
6:16 My heart just melts completely 😍😍😍😍😍 He's soooooo cute
They didn't need to rehash the One Direction story. Why not focus on more of his solo work
I just fell even more in love with him. He’s so genuine and sweet and just an absolutely amazing artist TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS EVERYBODY PEACE OUT
Only Directioners know exactly what it feels like to be proud of someone like Harry, and be sad at the same time. lol #DirectionersAlways\nI hope and wait for a 1D reunion, but if it never happens we know that the guys are always together in ways and that 1D will always be a part of them as much as it is us. I'm always so proud of Harry, Niall, Louis, and Liam because they've always been supportive of 1D and never regretted any of it. They show such respect to 1D and its fans and that's so admirable. Even if they don't reunite, they still bring us amazing music.
It's just beautiful!!!!💚
The One Direction clips had me crying wtf😩😭😭😭 proud of my boys❤️
Really good interview simple, forward yet told engagingly.
When I heard that x factor music....my heart......not again....... I cant😭😭
I'm only 23 I rolled my eyes so hard my head hearts.\nHARRY YOURE NOT 23 YOURE MY BABY SHUT UP
I am so grateful to have been able to see him this past week in Austin, he's so passionate about music and you can clearly see how much he loves what he does. Such an angel.
oh my god it's my dad 😭💓
Bring back the one direction feelings already!
this interview lays in my heart and will accompany myself till the day of my death
When they showed the 1d clips with all five members It felt soooo nostalgic
i don't think you understand how many feels this interview made me feel. Im so proud of him and how far he's come.
I'm not a 1d fan, i casually listened his album and got caught up. I really like his album, it's like a combination of the 70's and 90's. I'm was raised in rock and roll, so i know what i'm talking about, I have never in a million years thought i'll have become a fan of his. So, bye.
hes so cute im 11 im a big fan of one direction and harru
6:16 \nHES SUCH AN ADORABLE LITTLE BALL OF SUNSHINE I-
So refreshing to watch... not like a lot of celebrities out there who thinks they know it all. Wish everyone will follow his ways of handling his fame...
Love you harry till the day i die :'( <3
Harry didn't like being in the band Well excuse me
So glad to call this man my idol
dear god he's so charming
Why does it feel like Harry Styles died and they’re doing a tribute to him???
Somebody respond me this pls: is he officially out of 1D?
He's so pretty ;(((
I love him so much!
He is so humble and that is one of the many things I admire and love about him
I'm obsessed with Harry's eyes and dimples 😍😍😍
Finally a little documentary about him. He deserves all the love and probs he gets.
I always knew this kid would be the breakout star. I'm starting to really enjoy him and what he's doing.
I’m not crying, you are
i’m so in love with this man
Okay when lul baby harry said he was gonna sing isnt she lovely by stevie wonder ya girl started bawling thanks
the beginning reminded me of the 90's idk why
what is the font they chose for his name???!!
i miss these boys together so much
I cryied all the video
The narrating is so agonizing to listen to
I really love him and I would always love I loved him since 2012 so I can't just forget him\nI don't care if he's going solo I will love the boys in their own way.\nI really want one direction back but if they can't than I'm okay with it, because there are people who lost their idol and mines are still alive so I'm gonna enjoy it.
I stan a legend.
7:22-7:24 is sooooo good. my favorite part of the whole album\ni wish he would sing it like that live
Styles has been ducking and diving like that since before he could drive True
I fall in love with h
is there is anyone like me , crying ?! 😭❤ any true Directioners ?!
I like his shoes though.\nit's so expensive.
Thank you for this interview with harry 😘 wonderful 💝
he's such an angel and i'm so  in love
I'm so in love with this man, god I would die to find my future husband exactly like him
ALL THESE FETUS ONE DIRECTION CLIPS ARE CUTTING MY HEART OPEN
Such a good documentary of him! \nI am moved after watching this.
If you’re having a bad day, skip to 6:15
Interview was amazing. Thank you Sunday Morning for showing him respect and not using the standard assumed pronouns. Evolution in media is a wonderful thing. Sunday Morning is the best show on tv.
*Who's so Proud of Harold as me?*
Harry has such a beautiful soul. so mature and empathetic. This is why I adore him. and his music brings back some rock to mainstream which I appreciate. Incredible album. everyone should check it out
OFC THEY WOULD PLAY STORY OF MY LIFE IM ACCAULLY GONNA CRYD
I loved the interviewer. Not asking too private question, letting harry finish is sentences, being respectful - that is how you do it
He is so mature for his age ,love u harold!
I love him to everywhere and back😍😍
He's such a genuine human being. I'm in love with everything he does♥
Me- *sees title and instantly starts crying*
His not in the Band anymore??
I love listening to his voice..talking and singing
I went from laughing about his pants falling down on stage (ah, the good old days) to crying because of how proud I am of him in 7 minutes
it's so scary how you can be one simple guy with his friends and family and from one moment to another you become part of the biggest boyband of all time. it's just wow i'm so prouf of him, of all the boys
This show is so old fashioned
Please come back ONE DIRECTION.🙏🙏🙏🙏
I love him so so much! What an incredible person. He's priceless. ❤
I love his music and him so much shhs
This interview makes it sound as though his connection with Holmes Chapel was a long time ago. He still regards it as his home. Are Americans trying to claim him as one of theirs now or something.
His hairline is already going :(
so fond so fond so fond
Proud of my frog
1:32 The. Chills. Literally.
4:44 🎶😣💕
My precious, precious boy ❤️

A good fella indeed
Crying 😭😭💕
This is wired
Very talented !
He is amazing!
Sooo are we gonna pretend that they werent flirting : ))))
wow
Gracias por organizar los conciertos de Harry. Tengo 67 años y amo a Harry. Es una persona maravillosa. Soy de argentina y gracias a ti puedo estar en sus conciertos. Gracias
Props to this interviewer for being very polite and laid-back but still  professional. You could tell Harry was comfortable.
I hope they all come back soon. I wanna hear new 1D music ;-;
looool who else just found this btec arsenalfantv channel
This guy has some good points but he sounds like KSI and it's off-putting
Anyone else think this guy seems like a massive nob?
This white man looks black
3:17 is what your looking for!!!!!
That brown guy probably celebrated like made when batman scored the winner against athletico, Fucking plastic hypocrite!
Plastic fans, plastic club, always will be
These guys are laughing like they've never heard that expression before... it old, guys. My friends were saying that in secondary school back in the late 90s. As for Chelsea... yep, you said it, no leadership, no strength in depth and no recognisable and proven striker.\n As for Palace, c'mon chaps. Only way is up now. Fans were terrific as always. There is a team spirit, a positive one, at Palace that can't be emulated or obtained by any other team. The day we lose it, is the day we no longer exist.
He's trying cunt of Willan I can't see why love child I guess.
Chelsea’s fan base is a joke.
Straight up I think this dude has autism
You need a hole in condoms, it`s where you put your knob in.
I can see G.Hiddik replacing Antonio before Christmas in emergency. And then having Mussonda a regular starter and Willian going on loan to Fulham or something.
This is just lol
Shit club very little history 😂.
You will never be Arsenal fan TV
All condoms have holes in them. That's how you put your dick in them.
City and united for the title, pep vs jose
Costa and Matic were missed. A Chelsea fan was mocking me a few weeks ago when I said Chelsea would miss him\nChelsea do not play to Batshuayi's strength, it is sad. If you play Messi as a Target man he would be shit too\nBatshuayi is not Costa, he is probably better as a wide forward or when playing with two forwards
Bet you didn't think he was useless when he got the winner in Madrid.
Fucking palace 😅😅😅😅😅😅nice to see the scum be put in there place'''
If we can win one of the cups, and have a decent UCL run, then it would be an ok season
Hammering willian?! I would gladly take him to man utd. You guys missing matic so badly but do not even know it.

100% agree with this guy
Are these the people that live in London these days? Fuck me what a third world shithole.
3:18 was why you came here
Lol that must hurt..palace not scored and then they beat Chelsea omg Chelsea are shit
Perhaps try interviewing a real Chelsea fan & not a kid who has only known the success of the last three years.
Call me delusional but I still think we can win the title, Man City always have a great start to the season, yes this year they've been pretty explosive but there's no chance they will keep hammering teams the way they are. UTD are playing garbage football recently so I expect them to drop more points, morata will be back this weekend hopefully and our season can restart from there. We had a worse start last season so there is hope.
Stop interviewing this guy. He speaks anger and not football.
One of the worst Chelsea proformances since the founding of the club all the way back in 2003
He talks like Mo from AFTV
Doesn't a condom already have a hole in it?🤔
Where do these people get time to rant like this? Son, you're a Chelsea supporter. Not a board member.
No bus no party. Why does conte inisist on playing on the counter. Why not commit instead of comitiing after you go down. They are not man city. Less than 60 percent possession which is disgraceful. 70 percent easy and if you have the ball. You will score. You have the quality in hazard.\nTo stop chelsea is easy. STOP THE COUNTER ATTACK AND CONTE IS USELESS.\nWhy play with so many defensive players?
Shit team shit supporters and thats the sample of it
Why do chelsea fans moan just because they've lost one game?You lot win trophies year in year out and your fans are cocky after you lose 1-0 or 2-1.you lot have a problem...
This guy is bigger than DT.
why do all these random cunts keep stopping by and thinking they can give their 2 cents whenever they feel like it? mad disrespectful.
I hopw to god ancelotti replaces conte this summer
I don’t know why black and Asian people support chelsea are you guys deluded they’re deluded. A bunch of middle class snoby asians and blacks support them don’t know their roots uncle toms
Lewis someone called in sick we need you to come in early
Fucking hell that chant at the start might be the worst chant in football history
he can't even make won successful dribble, the moment i saw willian on the line-up i knew we were going to struggle. charly came in and his first dribble had a better chance at goal then willian attemping 100 dribble and failing 99.
It really feels like the team can't be bothered, rather than Conte being to blame. But then again, the team, and manager didn't show any passion. It feels like the Mourinho disaster is happening again, only with Conte at the centre of a shit storm.
Fab was the only starter who actually played, he wasn't excellent, but compared to the rest he was ok. Mosonda should be starting ahead of William until he fixes homes himself up
You was singing his name when he scored to win you the league 😂😂
Hahaha ... :D \nBatsuayi indeed is very mediocre.\nBut let's hope Chelsea could bounce back. Let's support our team instead of mocking them shall we?
Zappacosta should start now that Moses is out injured
Why conte thinks or believes he can go 2 seasons playing one formation still baffles me! This chelsea team is easily predictable because the manager has failed to keep opponents guessing.substituting a striker when u need one and Willian starting games ahead of Pedro!!!!!!
Ppl can't even handle  one bad result. This is the beauty of premier league. Last season conte was magical this & that now suddenly he is this & that. Give some time we don't have proper 11 now due to injuries. Keep calm & support. Dont b glory hunters like man utd , arsenal. We don't have history but we are making in the process. Keep calm. KTBFFH.
Conte is becoming a bitch because he is not like he was at juventus. And if he gets the passion, ruthlessness and desire from juventus we will win the efl cup because we are shit cahill that anus, willian that anus,bastuyai that anus, they don't know how to play willian and bastuyai went from Messi to a Sunday league player. We need to sell them and buy better players but we all know it will never happen because our board is also shit and the fucking owner doesn't take matters in his own hands and sack fire and kick them (board) out of the door.and the last one we need to stop trying to get fouls and man up and aim to get a goal.
what a shit from Willian everytime when he gets the ball he loses it freely why. Batshuayi is another fucked up player being overrated what a shit. every time we start batshuayi and captain its a lose Why. are they committed to the team or they are being paid to fix games. Willian, Cahill and Batshuayi should be benched no matter what those players are fucking useless. Rudiger and Christen are much better on the back than what this old guy is doing for us. \n\nYeah Batshuayi is like a broken condom
Title is over man. Summer transfer was underwhelming coupled with these type of performances. Best we aim for top 4, try to win one of the domestic cup n maybe a decent run in the ucl.
If we can’t beat Crystal Palace and Burnley, what’s the point.
These southern fans need to get a grip imagine if you supported a club that actually struggles.
Batshuayi should just get outta club asap...willian has really been shit of late though...cahill should just be like JT and admit its past his time and settle for a spot on the bench but he is probably selfish thinking of a spot in world cup...i have a feeling this season will be like the season after we won the league two years ago....
City are light years away from any team in the PL right now. The top 4 is the real competition
You spoke the thruth all the way we better fix up or else watford is gone win over us like Arsenal.  No joke start making a transfer list of players we need now NOW AND I MEAN PLAYERS NO BUY TO LOAN OUT FFS
we really need to calm down! these things happen
he talks like Moh from ArsenalFanTV. same talking style
We won't win the league for sure bcoz our squad depth is just totally shit.For Man City even without Aguero they are thrashing teams left and right bcoz they have another proven striker Gabriel Jesus.For United if Lukaku gets injured they have Zlatan , Rashford and Martial.But we have useless Batshuay.When he plays we become so shit that we can't even beat fucking Palace!!!!!!
You completely made my day mate. These words are 100% Chelsea now 😡😡
Trending with 9.2k views, well then I guess that Russian tycoon even bribed YouTube mods then.
i love this guy
Every time Michy gets a chance he absolutely blows it and has a shocker.We need to move Luiz into midfield and play Christiensen while Kante is injured
Exactly mate that was the best thing you have ever said lol, batshuayi needs to fuck off he is worst player in our team and if we can't get another striker in January we atleast have recall Tammy Abraham cause he has been brilliant so far for Swansea.

Looool Chelsea fans are autistic and gay

Somalian is a chelsea shirt 😂😂 man these leeches are everywhere
lewis talks sense
Always crying like a baby back bitch, no shame in losing to the mighty eagles. Were due a win.
A black Chelsea fan? Must be a paid actor
He is trying to act like troops # AFTV IS BETTER
This is way more hilarious than arsenal fan tv
still undefeated for the season hehe
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Arsenal lost 2-1 to Watford.
HAVE YOU SEEN CHELSEA LOSING TO CP ? OR ARSENAL TO WATFORD ? HELLO THIS IS REAL FOOTBALL NO ONE CAN CONTROL IT LIKE YOU DO WITH ALEX HUNTER'S JOURNY IN FIFA !
BORRRRRRRING GAME . WORST game this season
Klopp has spent 34 Mio overall in 2 years , Mourinho 254 Mio 2 years
All of you lot are fools, and bandwagoners who dont understand football, I'm sick of seeing this shit Oh Mou ruined the game - Who's the manager, who's won the lot time and time again, you fools were let down only by your expectations, and as a man utd fan, was I happy with the performance? No. Happy with the Tactics? No. Because like most of you I've been spoiled by the Sir Alex Era, so no I would never be happy. But do I understand? I do, I do understand, even though I don't agree, I understand, and I will support Mou as long as he is at the helm. The league will not be won and lost in October. If the opponent can't score they can't win. As for as many goals city have score and all the stats you like, we've score the second most, conceded the least, and let me remind you a Man City loss, just one, and a United win on any given weekend, and we're top of the league, now hows that for perspective ?
Fair play Jose altho im a united supporter Liverpool are a decent team but we still not defeated yet this season (bpl)
Nobody realizes he was trying to do a Chelsea v Liverpool at anfield 13/14......... sadly no one slipped
People don’t notice that Mourinho is scared of Klopp teams.
You always have to make the best of what you have available, OK united midfield was weak but this should have been compensated with the best attacking players.  I would have like to see martial, rashford and lukaku in the starting 11.   this takes pressure away from the weak midfield and would have forced liverpool into more defensive tactics.  I do not think mourinho works with a game to game plan.  seems to me that he thinks one game tactic fits all.  We should have burst out of the gates against liverpool and put them on the backfoot from the start.  Im not a big mourinho fan, I wanted giggs :(
Dont worry is stil way to go
we draw? arsenal and chelsea loose and am happy
Everyone is complaining about Jose parking the bus, yet here he explains brilliantly how Klopp is no different. Klopp basically matched Jose in substitutions and tactics, refusing to make the first move to actually threaten United's defence. Especially for someone at home, lying 7th in the table and 7 points adrift, you take out Salah, Coutinho and Firmino as soon as Lingard & Rashford come on? Is this what heavy metal football looks like? It doesn't matter though. Hugging your players on the pitch instantly makes you a better manager.
Man Utd fan here. I agree with what Mourinho was saying. Watching the game, Liverpool had more possession and pressed higher, but they could not unlock our defense. Both teams were trying to nullify each other's attacks. Liverpool tried to keep the ball and pressing high when they didn't so they get the ball back. Man Utd were defending in numbers to counter-attack Liverpool, which has been a weakness of theirs. Klopp didn't risk removing a midfielder to reinforce their attack, because it meant that a space would form in the middle which would help our devastating counter-attack. He knew if we countered it would be over, so he played it safe. Both teams were defensively strong but Liverpool were poor in attack and we were waiting to attack. \n\nI don't mid the defending in numbers. What frustrated me was the sloppy passes and possession loss when we did have the ball. Our midfielders gave the ball away too much. This is why Pogba is good in counter-attacking. He has the best range of passing arguably in the world and would've been better for possession when we had possession.\n\nNevertheless, coming to Anfield is tough so a point is enough. United will be happier with the point though, especially with Liverpool's shit form. 1 win in 8 games, are you okay?
I sink man u gonna sink
I see united fans on here saying that we played defensive! Lol and they call us deluded
Klop should just Thank Jose for not attacking that shity defense atleast he has another day to improve his shity team. . . .sacking is around the corner.
With the attacking power we have, I still don’t understand why Jose insists on playing so defensive against the top 6 away. It’ll be a problem for us to battle the best teams in Europe with this sort of play
Liverpool fan should listen to this interview.  it shows that klopp is slowly adapting his pressing style to be more defensively solid.  It shows that slowly he is heading toward a balance where he can keep creating and no concede to much.   If he carry's on and then adds a Van dijk and a proper striker we could be challenge.  Possibly next season. especially when you add keita to that midfield a defender and ma better striker
Chelsea united....as a Bayern Fan i lost all respect for manu... history and tradition means nothing to you i guess...never understood why they signed mourinho...
Soo... basically he regrets that he didn't have Schweinsteiger. :P
I don't care what anyone says. But Liverpool fans who say deffo our year and try to prove that Coutinho is worth over £60m are a disgrace to football. They're just a bunch of chavs who have nothing better to do than cringe out everyone... like fuck.
Jose has found the keys to his bus I see
The truth is this, Van Gaal would not have played difensive against Liverpool neither would SAF have. Liverpool defense was shit and Jose made them look like class. As a United fan if you are not disappointed with the display and the fact that Jose went for a draw even before the game then you need to be his assistant.
Tot you'd be happy with losing 2pts against a cheap team you are a real idiot and we don't need cowards.. No chance to go to France?
The English press talks too much. Sometimes it unnecessary. He (Jose) had a game plan and he did exactly that based on the way the opponents played. A draw is always better than losing
So he waited for Liverpool to give him a chance to attack? What kind of a game plan is that???
WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN U
ramicoo bro liverpoo fans are honestly living in the past. Wake the fuck up its not 70s anymore. They are just pissed off cause they were waiting for a battering and didnt get it so they thought utd are there for the taking and even then they managed a 1 proper chance on goal by their defender for crying out loud. Where is your 120 million super star that u now wish u sold him to messilona after his memorable performance yesterday especialy the cheap dive to get a pen. FUCK OFF SCOUSERS
Mkhtaryan was useless he had no effort in him! Overated and our worse buy in 4 years!!
This result proves the only reason man utd have been on form is because they have played bottom half teams. They will lose every game against top 10 cos they're fucking shit with an arrogant black stinky cunt for a striker
Jose Borinho complaining that he doesn't have enough players haha.....Give him another £300m to spend.  He hasn't spent enough yet lol
Valuable point, against a difficult opponent away from home. For me, as a fan, it wasn't an exciting game, but I'm happy that we got a point. I'm expecting a lot more dominance from United in the Old Trafford fixture though.
If Tony pulis, sam allardyce or sean dyche play like this and they are ridiculed and called out for ruining the game. Yet this horrible cunt mourinho does it and he is praised master tactician, genius bla bla. Get a fucking grip and pull your tongues out of his and man utd’s asses. He came for a draw that is it. Tell me any top team in the world goes out to a direct rival to get a point. I thought big bad man utd where running away with the league smashing teams? Oh ye thats right they have played nearly everybody in the bottom half of the table and the first good team they come up against and guess what they hardly got a kick of the ball. Fucking frauds
Chelshit fans ranting about United parked the bus again. Chelshit played good football and got 0 points. You coudlnt simply beat Zaha. Mourinho is one of the best managers in English football. Salute from an Arsenal fan.
Liverpool fan here, of course Jose didn't play attacking here, why would he? We press high an aim for the neck, he sheltered the neck. Sure it wasn't exciting but there is 22 players on the pitch that can change that, all the managers can do is set a base, United were not good but we could not score either, they left with a point. I would take a point at OT too. Next game, let's go YNWA
This man is ruining what used to be the best fixture in the world, Liverpool vs United, he come in with a squad worth 250 million and parks the bus, its rlly depressing
am a man u fan he didnt park the bus he park a double decker bus
Klopp was the pussy if you can’t see that u have got problems
Jose had a good game plan, our players did not turn up for the game. Lukaku is a very good striker but is not that clinical for me at times. A game away if you get a single chance you must score twice. That could have changed the game completely. Liverpool could have broken up the mid 3 and played right into Jose's game plan. We were easily giving the ball away, I miss Pogba and Fellaini they dont lose the ball unnecessarily
Ryans Gigs criticised Moyes for being a 'respond to the other team' kind of coach, rather than being ManU and doing things their way. Jose does the same as Moyes, complains that the other coach doesn't let his side play, and he is some kind of super coach? Amazing.
he sends andreas pereira on loan and moans for having no midfield playes on bench.....pereira would have been great value in this squad.
He definitely go for a draw.. i can feel jose had a lot of pressure after last season.. he could have been sacked if he didnt win europa league after all the money  he spend.. so now he tried the best to not losing by parking ke train and not sacked by the bus..
People complaining ?? Looks like draw but it's beautiful 1 points, kloop worked on defending I think
Man that's an ugly shirt.
Jose Jose jose. Guardiola is playing de bryun and Silva both number 10 in midifield if Jose wants to really control the game he could have payed mata but he didn’t want to take risk. However as a Man U fan I think he did the rit thing by parking the bus. Fergi have done it, so why not Jose ?
Played for a point and can't even admit it
How is this on trending?!
LFC there for the taking and he bottled it
Fucking dickhead blaming his midfielders instead of his shite tactics. This man is a coward. Liverpool are shocking defensively, take the initiative and put them to the sword. This is cowardly. He played the same vs Southampton in the second half after going 1-0 up. Coward.
Man United manager doesn't care what fun say or think .\nThat what I like to morinho .
Everytime Arsenal depresses me, i always remember the mighty united spent 90m on a walking haircut to finish 6th and celebrate a EFL cup.
I'm a big fan of Jose but that performance today was irritating. For me he should've used a 3-5-2. Just no attacking threat today, our momentum has slowed down after the last few games.
Could be worse -- just look at Chelsea
İ am not Liverpool fan but Liverpool was better team
Arsenal lost, Chelsea lost, & b*tches complaining about Mourinho & United
come on!!! why should he give you opportunity to counter attack????? you say they were very defensive??? come on!!! who was more defensive???
lol these reporters are out to wind up Mouringyo
One team wanted to win this game, embarrassing it’s hard to break down 11people behind the ball
How is 9k views in 6 hours ‘trending’
best mourinho
Park the bus cunt.
He's waiting for Klopp to make the first move. Such a counter attacking manager against top sides. Even with the absences he had more than enough talent to take the game to them.
Jose fucking coward
Good job Mourinho!
Haters - liverpool didnt win.... man utd didnt lose ==== what shit r u talking about
mourinho is a liar
Mou is classic.
1 point is still 1 point. no pobga no fellaini.
Calm down guys, Chelsea lost today......
Get a grip Jose!
Trending?
Terrible game
without retracts please !!
👿👿0/0:(
Shark is waiting to gobble moron mourino.
manu lack creative mid fielders
Jose you are talking BS. I have followed United for 28 years, and this is what you give back to our tradition. Sir Alex would never have done that. He would have gone for it, in the best of traditions of United. This is typical Jose play...
Mr. Parkinho!
DrawchesterUnited😂😂😂😂
GGMU  win lose or draw man united till i die, 20 times Champions!!! many plastic fan's (kids?) 😡😠 If you can't win, draw is good. J.M won more at Man Utd than J.K and P.G at loserpool and SHITY 😂
Back in the days he did it at Chelsea it worked because he had Drogba, who would have finished that one ‘Lukaku’ chance. Fact is he still parked a double decker! If Salah had left that ball for Coutinho this story would be different.
blah,blah MU didn't win bcoz pogba is injured and klopp did not go out full attack! \nmou is a shit manager!
where was the 200 million buget team offensively? if he couldn't win this liverpool, in this form, in this period, he will never beat it.
Garry Neville is full of shit.
Did not do the job needed during the transfer market. He should have bought 2 or 3 midfielders and atleast 2 more strikers. He bought a holding mid, a defender and a striker. Terrible mismanagement for a “topmanager” at a big club as Manchester United is. \n\nManchester United will run into the same issues as they’ve had last year. When injuries and suspensions show up the club has no back up, which will cost points. I am pretty sure that we will see more of these kind of matches if they won’t do their job the next transferwindow.
Liverpool were all over you, \nU prick.
jose,jose, here ,over here, boring as fuck jose,man united charlatans again jose. here jose .millions spent and no joy jose. chelsea what jose, liverpool better .yes that is true. united found out again .
am so glad this bus parking man get out of my club.
Chicken-shit manager with chicken-shit scared defensive tactic. Nothing new from arrogant shit. Big game against big opponent and he goes defensive. His explanation is BS. He is a reactive manager. I hope City smashes them 5-0 like Barca did his Real M in 2010.
Why didn't Mourinho envisage the possibility of the formation that Klopp chose and have a mid-field  player on the bench to deal with it. Isn't that what coaches do especially the Special One? Of course he didn't come for 3 points but just the 1.
When you play a quicker team. Start trying playing first more italian. Then play like Barca.
A 0-0 draw with Liverpool means Mourinho has now gone ten straight games without a win at Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham or Saturday’s opponents. His sides have drawn five and lost five of those games, conceding 15 goals and scoring just four times. Just one of those away goals have come since he was appointed at Old Trafford.
Meanwhile city keep bangin goals. Thats the diference between Pep and the bus driver.
KLOPP SPENT 120M SINCE OCTOBER 2015\n\n300M SPENT SINCE JULY 2016. HE'S A PATHETIC NEGATIVE FRAUD
Klop and jose are far to smart for so called journalists with their negative comments
Mourinho and utd..... SHIT!!!!!
Special one👏
What makes me mad is idiots that do not understand how deeply depleted the team is at this period of time, which Mourinho is trying to conceal as much as he can. Get it: no Bailly, no Rojo, no Carrick, no Pogba, no Fellaini and on top of that injured Rashford. Why Mouhrinho played defensively and Lukaku did not get service, because Mouhrinho is realistic, he got the maximum today and Lukaku had his chance to score. That is all Mkhitaryan's fault.
*LONG COMMENT BELOW*\n\nWatching Highlight in their new MV goes to show that even they all are too, human beings struggling day to day like us all in many different obstacles. But, even with all those tough paths we live on. We all keep on fighting, and pushing through no matter what even if we fall down. You get back up, and keep trying. Listening, and actually reading the lyrics really ups my mood.\nI just want to thank you, Highlight, for that extra push that you guys give through this comeback, as some of us may be going through some rough times. I hope you guys know that this song really does make me, and all the Lights around the world happy.\n \nHighlight definitely has come a long way, and you guys will continue to only go up from this point on. <3\nI will always stan as a B2UTYs/LIGHTs. <3\n\nP.S. I know you probably won't get the chance to read my comment, but I hope that you all keep on striving for the greatest no matter how hard it gets. Struggle together, succeed together, and motivate one another just like you all have always been doing from the start. <3\n\n#October14th2009 #8yearsandcounting

yang yoseob, fighting!\n\ni never be a fan of somebody for this long. and i will always be a light forever for highlight. highlight, fighting! 😘
Can't stop watching this vid
their song always different from others group . they have their own specialbility and that are the main reason why i still alive now. #NoHighlightNoLife
have u ever seen an mv and literally could not stop smiling. i lovw them so much and they make me so so happy 💖
i just listened to the whole album and it's giving me some feelings. 10/10
they deserve more! pls stream more :(
I upset when i read someone comment that Junhyung should stop produce and ask another composer to produce Highlight song. She sound mad and blame Junhyung cause the song did  not doing well on the chart.  Junhyung got a few song hit under his name such Caffeine, Good Luck, 12.30 and Plz don't be sad. So if the song did well we praise them?? if not we blame them?  we need to support them not to blame them. The purpose they made this album they want to convey to all light who have following them since 2009 and they said if the album will get a good response then it's added bonus to celebrate and enjoy together. Rather than thinking that something they can't help they will make a good memories instead. They comeback with cool dance move for us. They want to sing for us in along time. So many group disbanded already.  We should grateful we have them and not to blame them when worst result came out. Let's just enjoy and celebrate guys!
This is like YeY era all over again. People say the comeback flops just because it doesn't do as well as the very successful PDBS. Just like YeY that was preceded by Good Luck and 12:30. 😣\n\nHonestly, out of their 3 releases this year, I would pick Can Be Better as the best. Because:\n\n1) The song message. It's relatable and uplifting. It's not them simply saying don't be sad or we're young and invincible etc. But they're actually giving us an advice that life is like a wheel, sometimes you're up and sometimes you're down. Life goes on and that pain will pass. 😳\n\n2) The MV. It's fresh to see them doing ordinary jobs but being so extra. Heck, I don't know what they're doing in 70% of the MV, but it looks hella fun and I was entertained the whole time. 😂\n\n3) The intention behind this comeback. This whole comeback is made for fans to celebrate together with the boys their 8th anniversary. It may sound simple, but remember that just one year ago the probability of Beast disbanding was very real. And now the boys are giving their all for this comeback despite their schedules never been empty since they become Highlight.\n\n4) And how can I forget.. The song. It's catchy and addictive. Each member gets to shine. I'm really digging Yoseob's rock voice in the chorus. A solid anniversary song. 👍👍👍
Yoseob looks so handsome with that blond hair
This whole video is so fun i wanna hang out with them 🤣
why is the chicken/meat(?) censored tho? 😂
the lyrics does heal me inside
wow i need a new wig

I am so happy that u guys are still here. U have no idea how much I appreciate this. No matter how much Kpop changes I'm positive that u guys will be with us here forever❤️
To be honest, I preferred the first two Nerd Crew videos, where there was a clear effort in making the quips and irony sound as authentic as possible, like you almost couldn't tell if they were being sincere or not (obviously we know it's satire).\nI feel like it's being lost in these past videos, which is a pity because it's what made those first two videos so clever.
Me personally, I loved this review. It broke new ground!
rich evans with that intimidating hat game 😳
Does anyone else hatewatch Nerd Crew like me? I love the movie news channels, but this Shit is funny. Like I'm laughing and saying I hate you guys for being accurate at the same time. 😂😂😂
I want to see a spotlight or Re:view episode on Motel Hell now
Huh, they really don't like Screen Junkies....    Can anyone clue me in as to why?
Anyone else wanna see RedLetterMedia review The Fairy Odd Parents Live Action Movie?\nCause I wanna see RedLetterMedia review The Fairy Odd Parents Live Action Movie
I love how every episode the table gets more and more overdone with toys
That Star Wars jacket would be perfect for mike to wear at plinketts wedding!  It'd give him prequel flashbacks more disappointing than Andy Signore!!!
Ahh Rich Evans... handsome for a man.
you guys are my spirit brothers.
These are three of my favorite homosexuals on planet Earth!!!
How did I know we would see Rich Evans in that helmet and Porg by the end
This was fire! Well done RLM! Is Mike doing an impression of Grace Randolph?
Who else watched with the hope of seeing Rich Evans jerk off to Star Wars?
I want Rich Evans to explain the Time Travel Theory used in Star Trek IV
I like how they make fun of nerds, yet they buy all this merchandise...
Ngl... my reaction was probably pretty much like that 😂
At this point I'm no longer even watching the new trailers and this fake podcast is my only source for star wars news.
This is so well edited
CGI has come really far, that CG Rich Evans looks so real
Rich Evans porn is the best porn. It's so dense, it has so many things going on.
Anyone else noticed the edit in the trailer at 5:41 ?
Her: you seem distant today. what’s on your mind?\nMe: huh? oh, nothing.\nMy brain, loudly, over and over again: Thanos. In the hoooooooouse
It's a sad state when I enjoy anything on this channel a thousand times more than anything Hollywood puts out.
This shit is too sarcastic
Is this Star Wars or Star Trek?  The series has become like a Star Trek episode where they screw up time and keep repeating events over and over and over.
they are still missing the Nerd-For-Pay hot girl to make it a true stab at all those sellout nerds.
I saw that a CGI Penguin was replacing Han Solo and I clapped! I hope Kylo Ren doesn't stab it, before we find out if it or Rich shot first.
Don't forget, while you're waiting for Nerd Crew Episode 7 to come out, there's Half in the Bag 134!  Rich Evans in the house.
I love you guys so much.
Mike, Jay, Rich... Its like poetry, they rhymes.
I enjoy your comedic work, but I much prefer your serious/honest reviews of movies and trailers. So, of course, I loved this. Your intellectual and academic approach to what most people consider mindless entertainment is greatly appreciated in this age of fast food and the pill. Keep it up with your straight-forward, unflinching critiques and reactions. In Trump's America, we can really use some news that isn't fake or hashtag sad. You deliver the heart and the information that we need; no punches pulled and every square inch of those college film minor degrees being put to use. You're doing The Lord's work, and the people dig it. Smiley emoji.
8,ooo and something'th! That high huh?
Porg Porn in da houuuuse!
It's craptacular
Sarcastic/Ironic humor is very cool. Very cool.
HACK FRAUDS\nTHAT REACTION WAS CLEARLY SCRIPTED!!!
Very fucken cool. 05:43
porghub.com
Brilliant satire
NSFW! Should upload that last clip to PorgTube.
V e r y  c o o l
Very cool
This was fucking genius.
Holy RLM masterpiece. If you released the outtakes of making this video that would be VERY COOL.
Rich Evans in the House!
What... the hell is Mike wearing...?
Holy fucking shit. That was gold.
You guys are THE best of the worst.
Watching this high made me feel like i was going insane.
That intro sequence was so cringey, very cool.
I LOVE THIS BIT!!
Me personally, I love The nerd crew.
This is becoming so good it's now hard too watch.
U frauds should've waited till the Black Panther trailer comes out.
0:24 Are Ya Having That !
pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease, be the first to coin the phrase: star-core!!  XD
this makes me feel alive and able to go to my crippling job at the tax office. Thank you Nerd crew.
I legitimately and sad that MrPiggyEats isn't a real channel.
God damn that suit is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.
Rich's fast food review channel would do better than this one.
Oh my most beloved manchilds on the internets. Although i never saw The Force Awakens, Rogue One and never will see The Last Jedi, everything RLM regarding these movies i watch multiple times. They are so veeeeeeery cool!
You guys pay a lot of attention to sound design. I really like that.
Rich Evans.. in the houuusee!!!
10:52 Man you can really feel how unenthused Jay is about that movie.
You guys caught lightning in a bottle when you thought up this idea of parodying all the tools on Youtube promoting corporate products...and you keep bringing the social commentary so hard like it's nobody's business.\nAll power to the Nerd Crew, now and hopefully forever. Darkseid...in da houuuuuuuusse!
This is the second best thing on The Internet.
I rewatched this more often than the trailer.
We need more dark and dramatic lighting when you guys are discussing DC movies.
this was annoying as fuck, why not try for comedy and entertainment instead??
It's like poetry, it rhymes
SERIOUS QUESTION: Do you guys get most of your (star wars) props and costumes donated to you or are they paid for thru the RLM budget?\nYou guys seriously have the best props...some of them are genuinely spectacular (probably meaning you bought and kept them from your childhood)
For real, though, Mr.PiggyEats just got me to buy a Monster. It just sounded good.
I just wanna thank you guys for nailing these millenials and their reaction videos that plague Youtube. It's unbelievable just how horrific and popular they are. Thanks for pointing out their restless meaningless  bullshit.
VERY cool
Very cool. Very cool. Very cool.
VERY COOL, AGAIN!
cool very cool
OOOHHHHHH MYYY GODD ITZZ STARWAARRZZ!!!!!
9:00 so Lynchian...
Very CRUEL. VERY CRUEL.
Best show on JewTube
These guys are so awesome.
Gotta clap!
(Mid-way through video) aaaaaAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
“In the howwwssss!”
0:30 Wooo! Rocket Beans!
very cool
Sweet tie and jacket.
PORG MY GAAAAAWWWWDDD
Jesus christ, these guys are getting a little TOO pretentious now...I get that the stupid hype wears out very fast with these big-budget movies and how idiotic fanboys and girls flip out for every crumb of information and postulate into eternity about what might be, but come on, it's FUN to get excited for a movie. Don't fucking kill that innocence of actually enjoying a movie trailer and getting naturally excited for a movie. I hate Kathleen Kennedy and what Lucasfilm has become and what The Force Awakens was, but as long as this is Luke's movie, I'll be pretty happy if it's a decent film. Mark Hamill's acting so far in the trailers reminds me of the serious/earnest character he played in ESB with Yoda and it seems very genuine, I'm hoping for his best performance yet.
do you ever think that this has gone too far? Like, at what point does this stop being parody and it just becoming the same kind of pop culture podcast being mocked here, but with so many layers of irony that people who would otherwise hate those things instead choose to watch it?
Fuck reaction channels !!!!!All u The reel rejects crap!!
More Nerd Crew!! #MNC!!!
This is genuinely annoying. I'm sure there's a punchline hidden somewhere deep in this video, but it's still annoying. Probably this is some kind of built-in punishment for clicking on this video in the first place.
Is being a predictably cynical prick still funny? Not to mention this is hardly this first time they have done this joke. Originality indeed.
Oooohhh.. you are SOOOOO edgy! You think starwars are overhyped. Sooo Edgy!
*...but Batman says in the film We're stronger together.*\nDoes this mean that the corporate hacks at DC/Warner are _still_ riding Hillary Clinton's shriveled-up futa dick??
I need to find a way to filter out actual reaction videos. They make ruffling through stuff like e3 trailers a bitch.
Luke yes baby
Luke Evans is sexy hot and gay...Yay!
User's voice is just smoother and more dexterously controlled than Luke or James
Wow, Luke can sing and act!😲
First time I have seen Luke Evans and he is a talent......amazing.  But all of them are.
Am I the only one who click this when LUKE'S NAME IS THERE?!!!
How about riff off with 5 seconds of summer
Sorry got to be said don't use Usher's 🎤 after.....needs to be clinically decontaminated
First of allure Mickey, would you please stop, cease and desist from using my cellphone?! You are hacking my cellphone causing me many problems with misspelled words in my dictionary for spelling. GET YOUR NASTY 🤢, SELF OUT OF MY IPHONE LIFE, AS I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU AND THE MANY OTHER PEOPLE, EXAMPLE: HANOI ROCKS, A VERY UNKIND, ONLINE ODDLY ENOUGH ‘NOT MY KIND OF FACEBOOK EXPERIENCE I WOULD NEVER/EVER PARTAKE IN,’ ANY KIND OF ‘SOME CERTAIN ‘STRANGE,’ WHICH HAS NOTHING BUT VIRUSES, TROGANS, and SPYWARE ATTACHMENT’S! YOU JOINED ME INTO THE HANOI ROCKS ROOM A FEW YEARS AGO YEARS, HACKING MY IPHONE INTO HANOI FROM YOUR ILLEGAL DEVICE’S YOU SO PROUDLY HAVE. I’M NOT PROUD OF ‘EVER,’ WISHING FOR YOU TO NOTICE ME. I HONESTLY CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ARE THE MOST VILE / EXTREMELY HATEFUL, MEAN SPIRITED ‘IT OR WORSE YET,’ DISGUSTING SOON TO BE EXTINCT VICIOUS MONSTER I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THE WORDS ‘HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED,’ BECAUSE I WAS WRONG WISHING FOR YOU TO JUST ‘NOTICE A TWEET FROM ME, BECAUSE I WANTED A HELLO, from a, ‘what I believed you were, and I was way off base, a nice frontman of my ‘Favorite ever,’ rock band. I’m not a nut however, you told me you loved me and I knew better than that! Again, I’m not a nut but, I really held those words ever so tightly, to my heart. I’m an everyday person... not a star, and not a 6’ plus, amazon model. I’m not what you live for. I’m Angie. I am somebody. Actually, I’m a very polite lady, who reached too far and believed I could have a conversation with someone with her ‘favorite gorgeous baby gentleman.’ I could not have been more wrong, stupid, and grossly text lying abused. Since then, my Facebook experience has been horrible! I DO NOT KNOW YOU, NEVER HAVE I WISHED TO MEET YOU, NOR ASKED TO MEET YOU! I BEG OF YOU SIR, TO PLEASE STOP CHANGING MY, (‘MY,’ equates to... you changing my texts to suit what ‘you only wish I had texted about you but, didn’t!’). I do not like, want anything to do with you! I loathe your image, conceited self, as I do not spend my life online in Facebook or Twitter. You are violating ‘your’ terms of agreement with Facebook, hacking me, waiting for me to become extremely upset, unhinged, invasion of my privacy, listening to my mother, my father, ease dropping into our ‘private conversation’s,’ on so many levels, THAT IS SO DARN WRONG, watching me making coffee, unaware that you are able to see me, in a tee shirt only, (That was my OMG AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE THIS iPhone ALLOWED YOU TO SEE WITH YOUR ‘BLACK MARKET’ device’s, as I am questioning if those devices are legal or not, seeing me through my ‘RealTime Camera,’ was never aware that someone could do such a hideous ‘thing’ like listening to a ‘families very private conversation’ ,’ because you have hacked my iPhone to suit your personal needs and desires! You are a cruel person, Mr. Grinch! Not to mention violations, my mom gained your attention last week by telling you ‘Mick! You better put those pictures back.’ You listened and you put them back. It has only excelled from there, and that didn’t have to happen. I have deleted you from my iPhone photo’s, The Rolling Stones offered to everyone to ‘Save Photo.’ I legally saved them only for you to illegally delete them, take them out of my camera. You don’t want me to have Rolling Stones photo’s and the most amazing and legal way to handle that was to ask for me to delete them, not to hack me and take them yourself. You have made me reset my iPhone to its original version, ‘when I purchased this iPhone,’ taking me hours of my life and time to change everything I set up with my ISP, changing every single Apple email addresses, password’s and passcodes. To no avail, you were right back into my iPhone, ‘I pay for,’... me and ‘NOT YOU!’ I’m in my own private Hell because of what you have accomplished.., ‘embarrassment explaining to other’s who read my Facebook texts that I’m having an on-going problem with someone who wishes for me to have ‘no peace, like you own Facebook,’ at a certain point it becomes extreme bullying, emotional abuse, emotional stress, I’m paying for your abuse at my expense. You have issues! You just don’t want me to be on Facebook, as if you own Facebook! You are a superstar and you are someone and I’m not important enough to be on Facebook. May I ask... DO YOU OWN FACEBOOK? Last time I checked, you didn’t own Facebook. You relate to me by using YouTube and band song’s. You feel you are right. You are very cruel. tc.
Ushers voice is good he sounds like he did when he first came out usher won in my opinion but I respect other people's I'm not trying to start a fight though!!😱❤️😉
damn ok gaston i see you
This straight up reminds me of the plots on wwf. Donald Trump and Vince McMahon are fighting via proxy and the winner gets to shave the losers hair!
daymn if Luke Evans was straight i'd tap that
Corden takes the Late Late to a much higher level than before. I like Ferguson, he was hilarious but he just didn't have the showmanship that Corden has. Corden's shows have that Grand Production feel to them that is a pleasant change from the usual late night fare.
i think ur brilliant  but ur axdick money hungry sell out too apple
My teacher VJ in the middle!!!!
oh how I love Usher!
Usher clearly has the best vocals, he just didnt sing the best song to showcase it.
Luke oh my god. Wow just wow
My God they all very good 👏👏👏🎶🎤
This was one of the best!!
Usher why not come out of the closet before you start giving dudes herpes? Trash music, trash persona.
Damnnn Luke where have u been 😍😍. Lol in real life Usher will win
It’s always the same thing
I Didn't know usher was that small lol
I make beats please check me out
luke man , pants down ( i mean hands up !!!! hihi)
The James Corden show must really only be surviving off of YouTube hits if they're doing adds before and DURING the video. I like James but let's face it, no one is staying up to watch the show. They're watching clips on YouTube.
Nothing better than a Welsh man singing!
Usher just melted everyone in the audience...including me
I see usher wearing that LV box logo
it took 3 of them clowns to get closer to the original voice of the singe.they can't sing like the old singers.....no great voices anymore !!!.its all about the bling
Well. That was unexpected from Luke 😍
I feel like James really does think he can sing though😕
Amazing men!!! 👏Thank you so much
Where is Ne-Yo
You know they fucked
Dude luke's like Michael Bolton.
Luke LuK LUKE...super sexy dancer
hahaha
Where was Neyo?
What a comedy.
Usher still got the pipes maaaaaaan
I hope usher gives James Corden herpes
luke evans.... SWEET LORD...
YASSSSS LUKE😍😍😍😍
Luke 😭😍
Luke u are WELSH why are you dropping your accent. It’s insulting!!!!
I've been a fan of James' for so long now. I've been a fan of Brit tv, movies, and theater all of my life. It is so great that he is here in the states infecting us with his smooth sauce!
Where’s Taron Egerton?? Although Luke Evans is by far my favourite and the sexiest man alive
USHER your not sexy with all of that VD
I see you with the supreme x LV usher
dammmnnnnn
I loved that so much :D
WHEN LUKE RAN OUT I WANTED TO WATCH THE HOBBIT, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST AND EVERY OTHER MOVIE E IS IN BECAUSE HE IS PERFECT.
LUKE EVANS CAN SING???!?!!?!?!? I have been living under a frigging rock!!! FM, I can't deal with this level of awesome.
That dude from the nationals has a pretty sexy voice (they aren't that famous), to bad he is no that attractive.
When will corden ever lose his weight?
You don't want to get caught up in our beef  7:43 LMAO!!!!  Sausage fest!
Piglet
Luke Evans is my husband he just doesn't know it yet 😂😂😂😂😂 come through Gaston, Dracula, and Shaw.
Look at The Filharmonics’s  intro.... It’s amazing 😉
Anyone else think James is a crap singer it annoys me how he’s always singing cuz he can’t tbh
I don't even know a Luke James and he is hottttt
question for singers- do they look at each other so much to like give each other cues?  like i notice on award shows and other tv performances  singers are not singing a love song but they  do a lot of eye contact or touching. is this for cues to sing lower/higher, faster/slower, stuff like that? asking cuz bands never seem to do it or i not as much and they seem to play flawlessly together even when improvising.
Well what alot of testosterone booming on my phone. Sexy cordon...

This was better then majority of music today!!!!
Am I the only one who thinks usher looks weird without sunglasses?
why was he singing to usher? gay
I knew Luke can sing, but this 8:13 I mean, I was not ready for this, my body was not ready for this
LUKE, LUKE, LUKE is the best :)
When Luke Evans sings 🙌🙌😍😍
you look behind the catchphrases and there's nothing there. spot on.
2000 views, clearly trending.
Spot on as usual Kier. I can get used to reasonably detailed but straightforward answers.
how much do you have to pay google to be trending?
That was fascinating. Find it a real relief to listen to someone who has their head screwed on about this.
Trying to kick the can down the road.   Still face stark future post brexit.
Yawn!
Peston never used to act like that, Where's he got this exaggerated persona from, he seems to have flanderized himself.
All political parties continue to sell the message that there are only 2 options,\n1. Get a good deal. \n2. Leave without a deal. \nBut there is clearly a third option, \n3. To stop Brexit now and then negotiate with the EU from inside the EU club backed by a strong leave mandate. \n\nThe precipitous lodging by the May government of the Article 40 notice was clearly aimed at solving internal party problems with no real consideration given to the interests of the UK or the EU.\nAt the same time the opposition parties allowed the Article 40 notice to proceed without a great deal of opposition or question for fear of losing support from Leave or Remain voters. \n\nThis was and is the state of the political process in our parliament, which has lead a government with no clear mandate to enter UK/EU negotiations in an unplanned, uncoordinated and unduly optimistic fashion. \n\nThe present state of the negotiation is now generally accepted to be unlikely to result in a beneficial outcome for anyone. At the same time our parliament is more divided than ever and the political parties continue to follow a path which could lead to the breakup of the UK and the destruction of our democracy.\n\nWe (the voters) need to save our country from our political parties and our political parties from themselves.\n\nTo this end we ask our Members of Parliament to put aside party loyalties and Pledge to serve all our people in a Unified Cross/Party National Government mandated to stop Brexit now.\nhttp://www.fvvra.org/the-fvvra-pledge\n\nGordon Middleton\nFVVRA.ORG
Nowhere in Article 50 does it say 'With a view to a future agreement'!
Strange because Keir Starmer said on BBC's Daily Politics that if The Government chose to leave without a deal, The Labour Party would vote to keep us in The EU. The talks should have been trade based instead of firstly focusing on Citizens Rights, The ECJ and Divorce Bills. I, like many others, voted to leave and if this is stopped for any reason, then democracy is dead.
It's disrespectful not to refer to him as Sir Keir. He is a knight after all.
Establishment traitor.
Keir is an Agent of the EU.  Be careful Briton, many traitors about.
for a moment he sounds like a monkey lul
ah a wild brazilian
I like the screaming, all unarmed players should do this when being shot
honestly neck yourself for picking up that coat instead of backpack/redbull
That monkey was infected, you had to put it down.
this is the shit that should be on trending, not fucking soccer highlights or SNL or vevo

On my laptop I saw it as grey and blue and I showed my parents and they only saw pink but I didn't see pink? But looking at it through your camera it does look pink?
I see it grey and mint
i’ve always seen it as mint and grey, but now that i looked at it through the phone i saw pink and white, but whenever zoe would move the phone i would see the mint and grey so it kept changing with me
Joe I think the same as you
It's pink and white
I TESTED IT AND IT'S GREEN
It's not a shoe. It's a trainer
Every time I look at it I see pink and white at first and then it turns grey and teal after looking at it for a while 😂
Blue and grey but the other pink and white
Type in 'P' if you think it's pink and white  💖☁️\nLike it if  you think it's blue and grey 💙🔩

And, to think...SNL never said a word for 20 years after Billy raped and assaulted dozens of victims, and most recently, during the 2016 campaign never even brought up how Hitlery intimidated, threatened and coerced Bill's victims.  Pretty f*cking sick, SNL.   But, since SNL is a hive of liberalism, rape is okay if a liberal politician does it, right Seth?  You sick f*cks.
OH my fucking god , he just said a woman of color, just say black...if she was white you would of said white, being called black isnt offensive..by saying woman of color you are practically saying that there is something wrong with being black
Weinsteins problem was and is: he didn't approach women who like bizzarre sex practices. All in all it is harmless what he did...for you hypocrites it is of course...then show us your real browsing history...
And you Seth Meyers have built your career, as sad as it is, on bashing the President of the United States. Go spew your Global Community ideas in Canada. Justin Trudeau is more your type. Take your Mama Hillary with you, you big baby! You suck!
This guy is your typical lefty. Can't deal with the story at hand without spinning it about somebody else. How about bringing up weird uncle Bill Clinton.
Seth Keyers is really hitting his stride with the Closer Look series.
Seth Meyers such an awesome comedian.   You should learn to speak Spanish and broadcast on UniVision.  My people love your platform to kill Trump at all cost!
Tired of anti president crap. Tired of Seth Myers. No longer funny. He should move on and give us a break.  Too much of repeated sameness.
Remember when late night was funny
Obama took down the Republicans twice.  They'll NEVER get over that.  That's why they attack his legacy.
The lawyer Bloom is the one that made the dinosaur statement. She also has been accused by Rose McGowan of bribing people to cover for Weinstein.
Where is Bill Clinton's pic ?  Hiding the truth like always,  When the women complained.\nHillary RUINED their lives.
Hollywood hates Trump because he's not part of their clique. Simple as that. That includes you late night hosts too.. Kimmel, Colbert, Stewart... You're all part of the same apologist, elitist, Hollywood crony, agenda pushing system.
this is bang on
um, dinosaurs got smoked by a big honkin' rock about 10 miles across that hit the planet at 40,000 miles an hour.\nain't no adapting your behaviour to that, baby. mind you, extinction is a fitting consequence of being a friggin' pervert, but still, no ice age involved for them dinos.
great, now lets get to those pedofiles.
LOLITA EXPRESS SETH- YOU  KNOW ALL ABOUT IT SETH YOU ARE TRYING TO SEPERATE YOURSELF FROM HOLLYWOOD??? YOU ARE HOLLYWOOD ....SETH AND ALL THAT HOLLYWOOD STANDS FOR YOU P. OF S.
I see r/The_Donald has finally discovered Seth Meyers. Finger on the pulse as always!
all proud Americans should boycott all these trump hating anti us traitors. they are just doing lip service for hillary and all the snowflakes .they are not even funny.
lol @ you putting Weinstein and Trump in the same sentence. How about bill Clinton? LMFAO
Nothing will happen except punishment for the brave women who spoke out. The US won't change.
Where's bill Clinton??? How come you pussys don't him on the list he was a president
One is worthless and One is lowering my taxes and healthcare
Plenty to say about Trump, who merely *said* something bad in a locker room setting among his friends, but NOTHING here about Bill Clinton, who raped and molested dozens.  Nice.
Go look at the connections to this guy and the Democratic party \nOhh and now CNN is blaming Pokemon Go for Russian conspiracy theories now\nNot kidding. \nLate night television and media is a damn joke at this point, both are complete propagandists, at least I get a good laugh from all the mentally ill people who put on the show lol. Freaking dumb dumbs
lol seth the idiot think he can say trump and harvey in same sentence to try and put more negativity on trump so his friend harvey weinstain get some room to breath, pathetic\nseth should just admin how many victim he raped together with harvey
Liberal elitists trying to shell game Trump into Weinstein isn't going to work. We know what a swamp Hollywood is. No one is fooled by these shows.
More proof that YouTube controls the like/dislike ratios.
You fucking idiots can't help but bring trump into something he has nothing to do with
Can you go over how awful Hannibal the show was. The acting, the characters, the lack of respect for the books' storyline! There was never a string of serial killers in the history of humanity!!
😂❤️😍😂❤️😍😂❤️😍
Jon snow just died
¡¡ Harvey  for president  2020 !!!
It is clear this monologue is agenda driven. Had the discussion included Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, LBJ and JFK as examples of the problem Seth would have come off as someone who was really concerned. Instead to any reasonable person he comes off as ignorant.
Seth is going to throw his back out reaching so damn hard!
This show is unwatchable.  I haven't had cable for some time now, but it's amazing how lazy the industry has become.
Seth try some honest reporting for once.  Anyone with intellectual honesty and morals would know that Bill Clinton is the comparison to Weinstein.  Not Trump.  But hey, keep up the fake news.
Idubbz gets 10 million views on newest content cop not trending \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal comedian blasts trump  gets 200k views and on trending \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you see the narrative here
Looks like 7500+ bots detected in Seth and Steven Colbert's video comments and everyone knows the reason. No one likes you bots. Please like each other's comments and die without payments. We just ignore you! Bye!
LOL!!!  Every elitist pedophile ever known is a friggin Jew.. just ask Seth Meyers...he likes em young (and male..) and he's as kosher as a gefilte fish in a pickle barrel.
1:40 - Trump is so unqualified for his job?  \nYou mean, American voters are so unqualified for their job.
Where is Bill Clinton in your lineup asswipe?
What is this supposed to be funny or just impotent.
I wish Seth Meyers would get eaten by a cat. I mean, he already look s like a rat. Why can't he die like the rat he is?
Systemic misogyny - again, you are stupid. It is about power - not gender. Because of the past, more males currently have power, but powerful people always expect their desires to be fulfilled - male or not. And of course right wingers used this for political gain, because it is one of the very few areas where you are a moron. The right has been feasting on such stupid reports as this for quite a while - so thank you for helping give us (gag) President Trump.
It's a disgrace that this piece of garbage would take the case of Weinstein sexually assaulting women for years and use it as an opportunity to slander Trump. You take this horrendous case that has affected the lives of so many woman and prostitute it out to take a shot at someone you don't agree with. Really? You disgrace those women and disgrace yourself.
So who is missing from the picture? You guessed it, Slick Willie, good ol' boy Bill Clinton himself. A man who raped Juanita Broderick, payed $800,000.00 to shut up Paul Jones, stained Monica Lewinksy's dress with his semen after she orally copulated him, Jennifer Flowers and countless others. This is why the media and late night shows have absolutely no credibility. They pander to a  mindless, ignorant mass of people who believe anything they hear.
Good boy, Seth. Keep it up and you'll host the Emmys! Such a good little liberal.
Bill Clinton is a serial RAPIST!  Not to mention child abuser!
Whole bunch of nazis, skinheads, KKKlans, and various other Russian bots and racists just scuttled from the woodwork and crawled out of basements here and in Russia/Eastern Europe, pushing Goebbels-like propaganda below, using black and Hispanic men/women as names or images, or Pepe the frog—all completely haters of America. These foreign and domestic terrorists are working together for anarchy; who is the Site Administrator?
I think it's funny how billy's call out bullys.make no mistake Trumps a piece of shut but so is the left.
Excellent review of the situation on Males doing bad things ...
Comments full of russian trolls
HEY SETH GO SUCK KIMMELS DICK......ASSHOLE
This Seth guy is a typical leftist. Hey hypocrite boy, why not include serial philanderer Bill Clinton in your comedy piece? You suck! Your show sucks! FO!
Scumbag low life comedian shifting the blame to Trump as usual. Brain dead script writer low on IQ
BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST
Hahahahahahhahaha❤️
Cruze is a crook.
its not a joke
Seth Meyers' opinion isn't worth the hair on my ass. He's become on honorary resident of Obscurityville!
SnakeOil Sethiii is a messenger for the Bilderberg Group. #hashBrown# clayFace, LOSER. PS only girls cry btw.
WoW after one month jewishMedia is (probably forced) reacting on the Weinsteincase, and still no (jewish) Prossecuters go after him.....
trumps has nothing to do with this....you puppet fake propaganda b.s.....
Late night propaganda
More SJW bullshit
KciD
System
Why the hell do people watch this guy. All those talk show host are saying the same, they are alike. But this dude is so not funny.
Liberal YouTube promoting liberal garbage. This show is crap like the sexual predators in Hollywood oh that this joke Seth Meyers is a part of.
The US is a horrifically sexist country.
You are boring.
Abusing their power to silence bully and coerce, Said by the media. It's amazing how no complete facts ever come out of this.  All bits & pieces put together by the media so they can abuse their power to silence bully and coerce. Trump pointed out the systemic corruption within PR and it seems like the millennials are to dumb to get the hint. Everything PR needs is available to them right at the dock!! The people are driving because they want more money, cargo isn't moving because the stores want money,  those in power dont lift a finger without a camera being present!! Look it up people.  as a matter of fact instead of agreeing with the media like mindless robots why do you just look it up? Use more than one source! Actually use more than 2 sources!! Good luck!!! Oh and Weinstein shouldn't even be compared to trump.  He's just nasty.
Seth Meyers has some funny material here, but he's going down the wrong path with the systemic male entitlement and misogyny claims.  The problem isn't so much about gender as it is about money and power.  Women will abuse their power in the workplace as readily as men, in my personal experience.
Another self-loathing white male.. what an ass!
This belligerent stupid so called TV host have no clue what is sexism is. He sees Trump with the same eyes to see Harvey but he doesn't even try to mention what His GodFather Bill Clinton did to women. There is a sky-to-land difference between locker-room talk and serial rapist in the white house.
this passes for comedy? this gimp can't even put together a proper offense when he just miss-quotes and miss-interprets recordings.   Apparently Trump derangement-syndrome STILL hasn't gone out of style.. get a life.. Seth, you make fallon look like will smith in the mid 90s.. get fckude..
You knew this whole Weinstein thing came out just so they could veer it into a Trump issue.  It's pathetic and won't work.  Liberal scum are just being scum as usual.
Shes not attending the meetings, nor communicating with FEMA???.............nothing gets done. Yes *TRUMP is right* again.\n\nThis dufus is *wrong again with inaccurate information* (propaganda). Search brock long puerto rico \n#FakeNews
I really don't think Trump's feud with Cruz has to do with sex, its because someone challenged him publicly, he would have done and said the same if it were a man.
6:37 Just to split hairs, but dinosaurs did learn new ways and did not go extinct. They managed to survive and in the process took over the skies, and are still with us to this day. They're birds, which are better understood as avian dinosaurs. :D
Who's this cuck? The newest neoliberal retard on the trending tab?
Male entitlement? That's so Bullshit.
Hypocrite  Hollywood ..Biliary lost GET OVER IT SNOWFLAKES
*SETH MYERS IS A RAPIST*
Wtf does he have to do with Harvey Weinstein? Liberals are soo dumb.
Seth your an idiot
😂😂😂😂اي يمني يحط ليك🤠
Sexual assault! (((canned laughter)))
Your such a slimy scum
Seth thank you for addressing this, your sign off on this video was by far my favourite in months. Keep it up please man!
Our toxic culture of male entitlement is such a sexist statement.
We get it Seth. You are still butt hurt Trump won. All you do is talk about him and have been for months. Can we now have some late-night comedy please
Trump has abused no woman. Harvey has. Big different. Yuge.
Seth Meyers diddled me when I was 2.

I visited my grandpa today and had to think about your honest and deep thoughts about old people and how they're feeling lonely and have nobody to talk to. \nI love helping other people and i hope to find a way to get involved here in Germany. \nI love how you always say what is on your mind, wether it's funny or sad, positive or negative. \nI find that very inspiring!

Alife to stop spiders coming in to your house you can either cut up lemon and put them by your window or get some peppermint oil and mix it with water and spray it around your windows and door by the way spiders tend to hide in the corner of rooms because they are the warmest

Bruno sounds good in any language but that's no surprise.
Daddy Yankee el mejor :D
Marc Anthony wow man.. no words for your last performance, and even less for this amazing event and your love and support for your Puerto Rico.
Selena Gomez receiving calls and also introduced Ricky Martins at 2:33:37
Great！！ Stevie Wonder!
Bruno though 😍😍😘
I had been living in here for 30 yrs and I haven’t seen this before. This was amazing I’m very proud of all of you. My heart was pounding of joy. Congratulations and thank you for all your efforts to help our island PR, Mexico, US Virgin Islands and other parts of the states. Goose bumps and proud to be Boricua!!! In special Marc, JLo and Alex thanks for join forces in this event!!! Also, all the American artists that came to help in this cause thanks for the bottom of our hearts!!!
Porque pase lo que pase yo seré PUERTORRIQUEŃO 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Es hermoso ver como las personas de todo el mundo se unen para apoyar una buena causa 😊❤
Beautiful show💖 Puerto Rico, you are loved!! Prayers to everyone that was affected 🙏 god bless u all.
DJ khaled was really turnt up and loved his hype and performance 😍😍☝

Where is everyone singing to big puns song....
Wonder how I can get a cd/dvd
Man i love Bad Bunny so much

I watched it on NBC last night and made a donation. Reminded a few friends to watch and they did in turn made donations as well.  This is a reminder to all latin people that we have to be united if we want respect from politicians and to make sure that our voice is heard in Congress and in the White House.
#PrayForTheWorld #PrayForPuertoRico❤ God is with you Puerto Rico! 💚🎈😕
I am just watching this and I have goosebumps all over my body!!! God bless
Does anyone know if I could still donate? I missed it live but would love to contribute.
Maroon5❤
Demi and Bruno owned the night <3!
Why are there celebrities on phones?? Like what are they answering to
I wish I was there with you all! thank you to all that donated. what a great show! God Bless all my family in Puerto Rico.     $$$$$$ donate and pray for all the ones suffering
Sorry but why would you post a Spanish dubbed version of the English spoken parts. It makes it hard for people who don't speak Spanish to donate. This was such a beautiful event by the way and much needed with all that is going on in the world today to show that there are still people who care.
My thoughts and prayers  not only go out to our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico who have been affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria but also to everyone in the other Caribbean Islands   who were affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Bruno Mars Melhor parte ❤😍👏👏👏
Marc Anthony in the last performance.... WOW!!... Heart and soul pure Boricua that bleeds nothing but his land.... - It could be you tomorrow, it could be you tomorrow.. and you know what?? WELL BE THERE!!!... - Que viva la raza Latina!!.. PUNETA!!!.
This breaks my heart..I'm from the Dominican Republic please let's help Puerto Rico get back to normal they got hit bad..my prayers go out to the Puerto Rican Community...
What an amazing event, Together we are one, Puerto Rico God is with you!!
I think that all their performance was Great
thanks to jlo , RIcky , Marc , Bruno., Mars. the biggest talents from my beautiful puerto Rico !!! always greatful for this Music icons ! coming together for this Disaster relif , hands down to all the most Amazing and beautiful humans beings ,

En honor al descomunal cariño afectuoso que mucha gente le tiene a Selena Quintinilla debieron haber realizado un homenaje con sus canciones en contribución a los damnificados. HUBIESE SIDO INDUDABLEMENTE ALGO ESPECTACULAR.

Suave Freddie\n\nThose who give out of their hearts, are giving towards Houston, Florida, Puerto Rico, the small islands.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
What happened In Puerto Rico is a terrible!  However, Lopez took the stage again doing dance moves, or stripper moves that should be left for a Vegas Show!!!   This is a time of sorrow for these people that are suffering, not showing your rear to the whole world!!  So Sad.....
Did anybody notice that all three men JLo had a sexual affair with including A-Rod we're all there Under One Roof LOL I don't know that's kind of disgusting to me but I'm glad they did it it's all about Puerto Rico shake that ass Jennifer Lopez Shake Your Money Maker I don't think Selena Quintanilla Perez would have needed her to shake her ass to raise money her voice and her beauty and her character and her personality and charm is all she would have needed and her love for the people
what song is at 2:07:00
Chiquinquira le dijo Mario a don Francisco? Jajajaja
Marc anthony was so into the song he played at 2:57:15 , that he screamed at loud PUNETA!!!!! lmao
It would be nice if Mexican artists did something similar. These artists were mainly PuertoRicans... so they focussed more on representing Puerto Rico.\nFuera bueno que artistas Mexicanos hicieran algo similar para representar a Mexico...como\nHa-Ash, Lucero, Gloria Trevi, Pedro Aguilar, Pedro Fernandez, Talía, Alejandro Fernandez, Alejandra Guzman, Maite Perroni, Ramon Ayala, Gerardo Ortiz, Banda el Recodo, Duelo,...todas la bandas y grupos! \nay muchisimos artistas que pudieran hacerlo por Mexico! 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Why didnt they did this for Mexico ? You all bunch of hypocrites!
fucking jlo showing that ass like a puta and after talking about dead people dying lol 😂
The fact that the world number one diver does cheap Halloween costumes while living in prime estate astounds me. I feel so blessed to be living at this age and time.
The sound he makes when he takes the box off is hilarious
Let me just say that, Lance has his hands full with you!  LOL, what a clever boy you are!
Cool outfit for a party Tom, but I'd suggest you might make a slight front flap adjustment 'cause if gotta take a leak during the party it's going to be a challenge!
Oh my God. I'm so in love with you
Legend has it... Tom is still trying to get out of the finished costume. :)
I don't know why, but listening to you say flappy bits just cracks me up.
wait until you try to sit down, LOL.  I did this one year, dressed as a bottle of aspirin-could NOT sit, haha.
AHAHAHAHAHA 515k 😂😂😂😂😂 I don’t think you should be on the internet
Is it possible to sit down in this costume?
That's actually pretty cool and creative =)
When ever he comes out with a video, it reminds me of swimming. ♥

The editing was hilarious.
I really want to see how you got out of the full costume again without cutting anything because I would be stuck forever
em lego is play good in danish learn sumtin new every day
flappy bits, lol.
That looks dope costume Tom
such a little kid at heart - love it!
You need a mesh where the mouth is so only you can see out, but people can't see in.
Too much effort.  Tom really should have done something with a g-string and some body paint.
so cute i love it
In a more professional than it needs to be way, if anyone tries this in the future, grab a product called Gesco. It goes on before the paint and helps the paint stick on better and is generally a good underlying coat for any absorbing product (cardboard, paper, etc).
You could have a cutout eye and glue it or something on to yourself as a cloud to make the 'iCloud'
this is so cool, so clever Tom
The music is on point Tom!💃🕺👍
and you can breathe, which is nice -Tom Daley 2017
This was so funny! Not very scary but a good idea 😂😍
You’re like 20 bro stop making costumes especially roblox people
Good and Terrible....
This is your most environmental friendly clip!! We do not need to buy everything, it is much more fun and environmental friendly to make our own costumes!
Dude!! that was impressed... I had fun with your video about HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN COSTUME.... lol\nGreetings from your fan from Paraguay!
He is too sweet. I wish there were more gay boys like him, dating is hard.
Tom, I met you on the London Underground Train in and took a picture with you and so did my sister! Sorry that I forgot to say thanks, but you are a great diver!
I enjoyed listening to the Thriller cover music in the background.  Good choice, Mr. Editor.
YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR VLOGS TOM DAILY
This is so cute and hillarious=)) i can't omg lololol
I have such a crush on Tom 😩

How did you get the arm holes even?
so creative Tom, I love it!
He is so cute. Like lil brother :))

Just get a can of black shoe polish to paint your face and a sharp kitchen knife. You can be OJ Simpson and the costume only costs about $3.

Attention the real, keep Ayesha pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Makes me sad for my horrible looking feet
Idris Elba out here making foot fetish okay 😩😩😩

Cavs in 3
Men who are turned on by feet are weird to me.

The ONLY way I'll watch the real again, after the shameful way they treated Tamar, is to bring her back. I'll also settle for Ayesha Curry cuz Tamar is booked!
I like that though very unusual but kind of cute too.
I want to go ham on her but I'll be nice but it's crazy stuff  but if I'm Steph then he needs to talk to her like asap.
I would love for Ayesha to be a host!!!
These show's are perfect for my low IQ. \nOnly 4100 views and this crap is trending?

Lana är så fin
You would knock that bitch out cold when she get home
Black Fat bitches!!!!
Fucking normies infest everything and now they are heading for the fetishes 🙄
Yeah that's nasty
GSP is extremely dsngerous. He is like McGregor but quiet and stealth. The 1 Huge advantage GSP has over Bis. Is brains. Bis doesnt have the vision like GSP. 1 wrong move and your either tapping out or knocked out.
Fuck hem..he is a bully!!! Not a fighter..all this fightdrs are bad for the sport..!!!!diaz is a bully..cooner is a acktor!!!tony is a gangsta not a fighter!!no respekt no humble no sport..this are All punks!!!
Poor gsp...he felt bad cussing in front of the kid you could tell. I'm a bisping fan but hes takin it a bit far
gsp looks like hes gonna kill him with a knife if he touches him lol
i hope gsp shuts up bisping. dudes the only one trying to start anything between them for ppv buys. wolf tickets
you Go GSP!\nbisping is a coward and loser😁😂😃😄\ntotally fake and doesnt know how to fight what a loser bro
They’re trying their best too hype this fight lol
Great example for the kids. Where's the sportmanship gone. Oh yeah it will miracously reappear when the fight is over. They have milked the chumps for their money time to be friends now
Best not to get gsp pissed off
Gsp saying fuck off is actually badass hahah I wish gsp cusses more. Now I really want tos we the fight after this video😝
The kid was like i don't want a picture anymore your crazy maaan🏃🏻
I hope GSP fucks up Bisping's other eye so he'll look normal.
Yup Bisping is getting knocked out. After GSP wins he should say I'm not impressed with your performance.
Bisping loves being the dick, but if you have half a brain you can see he is trying to get georges riled up because he isnt as aggressive as most opponents so its all mental game plan, bisping has said many times he respects the guy so all this is an attempt at breaking him down before the fight
Bisping is pissed because GSP knocked the wind out of him with that sharp push to the gut (he admitted it on his podcast) and he felt GSP's strength.
Bisping is a fucking joke, worst champion in UFC history, talking shit to GSP... hope that one eyed fucker gets his face kicked in.
Love the new GSP........imbecile Brit has no chance against the GOAT
Bisping trying to be relevant even though he hasnt done a fkn thing in the ufc in his 13 year career besides win the belt 1nce then talk about retirement lol what a fkn loser
This shit is stupid! I'm a huge GSP fan and I'm pissed he's even coming back to fight Cyclops bisping....should have sailed off into the sunset with his millions and transitioned to action movies...no need to come back GSP has nothing to prove and this fake drama shit is so beneath him...i don't even want to see this fight
Old news, old pillow hands was always a cunt, but his moment has come. So he's enjoying it like he would. Either way it's almost over. If he does get by GSP i foresee whittaker retiring him, otherwise his next fight would be against yoel or jacare lol which would also retire him
Shut up Bisping!!! Enjoy the belt, you got a little less than 3 weeks with it!!
They're selling the fight.
These two assholes had a phone conversation all polite talking about how bad they want to fight each other
Bisping KO'd one guy and thinks he's a wrecking machine..
Bisping is such a fucking asshole, the less deserving champion. Ran with the belt after he won that pussy
Kid: i want to take a picture\nGSP: FUCK OFF KID! You think i am scared of you? Are you crazy in the head man?
Bisping said he wanted to finger the lizard tongue of GPS.. yes.. I said GPS, and lizard tongue
Bitchpig is a low life
Has Bisping taken too many blows to the head? He seems like he doesn't know what's going on. He's instigating, and then acting like he's not doing anything. Something is seriously wrong.
Bisping is the one that needs to control himself.
This needs to be retitled to Bisping vs GSP. Dudes earned the A side here
I see only one idiot with no respect and it isn't gsp. Knock this clown out for good please
that poor little id ran away because both cant control themselves in public :( Not really great is it for a role model and fighter to leave that impression on a 7 year old fan .. hope its a double KO
Lmao @ the lil kid running away from George at the end
Did u see the kid run!!! lol
bisping is fucking embarrassing. you've fucking run from the top contenders at middleweight. you only fought Silva et al. when they where past it.
Bisping: Control yourself you little etc.\n\nMichaels making himself look bad. Maybe it's his one eye, but can he not see that he's the one that needs controlling?
pisping is a real piece of shit and worst shit talker.
Bisping is so triggered when he talks so much shit.
Bisbing. Being Such a dick. Save all the bs for the cage. How bitter sweet and poetic Justice will it be when GSP kicks your English ass.
Before everyone gets their panties in a twist, Bisping is just hyping the fight for fuck sake. He's making it seem as though he has some beef with George, when in reality he probably likes and definitely respects him a great deal. But the fact is he's fighting him, and the more interest he can stir up for the fight the more money he makes as champ with a ppv percentage..
Better than the press conference. Yea....fukk u mannn
The kid running away is not only hilarious but makes a statement about how kids know things we forgot. He wants nothing to do with people that act like that. Hyping the fight, people keep saying. That's just someone being a turd of a person, repeatedly.
Where’s the casual fans thinking that Bisping is copying McGregor??
There just trying to hype the fight
We finally got to hear GSP say Fuck!!...It was everything I hoped it would be!...Lmfao
Mike, you look stupid when you act tough, not GSP, who doesn't do that. You have no idea how silly and retarded you sound.
Why are ufc fighters above the law? If you threat someone in public, thats illegall. Yes, we all know its an act, but common people dont know, like that little scared kid in the store!
Yeah?  Fuck off man. I am not afraid of you.   GSP 2017  go George!
Haha GSP having none of Bisping's fake shit tough guy act. Nailed it. No one's buying ur bs Michael The ducker Bisping.
I guess the kid at the end wasn't interested in a photo with GSP anymore! Lol!
Reminds me of that time Wanderlei went there with a camera to talk with Chael Sonnen
Bisping is full of shit he goes on about GSP touching him. Moron you touched him first
Fuck off.... I will break you!!!!
Bisping is the one touching george first! He's a fucking antagonising prick! I think everybody would react the same by pushing Bisping away after being touched, Practice what you preach Mr Bisping.
The name Michael Bisping will always be remembered as the British scumbag that represented himself, his country and his family like a disgusting disgraceful piece of shit. Pure dog shit. His kids are gonna turn out to be pieces of dog shit just like their scum father.
Damn gotta give it to bisping hes selling this fight but anyways hope gsp wins hes the original ppv king without all the talking anyways so this should be quite lucrative
i sincerely think he is afraid, those reactions...dont touch me dont touch me! trowing punches and shit.. this is real bully stuff.\nAwkward and cringy moment with the child at the end of the video by the way, soooo many embarrasing moments from this guy, @TMZSports how about a video? cheeeeers
What a fake world has become ufc
GSP isn't backing down. He's standing his ground against this bully Bisping.
There is a video I remember I watched few years ago about Gsp and karma watch it
Can't wait for Bisping to flatten this french speaking cunt
Everyone should love George. Great example Of choosing to be a great human being by never sinking down to another person’s level, Treat those with dignity even if they’re ignorant enough to not treat you with dignity.
Come on people, Bisping is hyping the fight! He’s generating interest by doing these antics.
How does Bisping have the gall to tell a guy not to touch him when it is a direct response to Bisping putting his hand on GSP.  Is Bisping getting dementia from the head shots he has taken over the years.
Pathetic.
Yah fuck awf man
bisping is a flog
Suck each other off already
HEYYYY FUCK AFFFF MAN ! XD
I Must Break You - GSP
fakk off man
Such class
Bad acting...
Busting is scared man!!
 Fuck off man  .... brilliant
Promo shit that's all.
bisping is a fuckin clown
Fawk awwf maan
Yo GSP cussing is the funniest shit ever
Don't touch me maaan
GSP is a legend
Fuck off!!!
Ay fack off man !
GSP's easiest first!
BISPING YOU BITCH YOU
Gsp va casser sa geule!
Gsp reminds me of karate kid
Yea fuck off man.
show.but its ok
Gsp scared the hell outta... A kid... Lmao
GSP cussing makes me keep grinning
Delusional bisping.
Mad respect to GSP.
Bisping is such a whiney little Bitch
Lambs eye
bisping is fucking cringe
BISPING IS A ROUGH LAD AHA
Fuck tmz tho still
bisbing is a brittish cunt i hope george does to bisbing what he did to koshcheck in there second fight.
To clarify, just because you can find an image on Google doesn't mean it's legal. This law is very loosly enforced but still is a law.
What about Soarin’ at three Disney Parks: Disney California Adventure (Disneyland Resort Anaheim CA), EPCOT (Walt Disney World Resort Orlando FL) & Shanghai Disneyland (Shanghai Disney Resort Pudong Shanghai China) where the Eiffel Tower is shown at night
So if I turn off those lights i can probably have the only eiffel tower legal commercial video on the internet? YouTube's ruby here I come.
So it's not so much the tower, but it's the lights on it that are illegal to photograph.
You blurred the Eiffel Tower at night but we can Imagine what it really looks like at night
Don't use square space for illegal copyright photos ok i will use it to advertise illegal drugs, thanks
It really makes you wonder how many times you've probably broken stupid laws without even knowing it. But I mean it is only illegal when you get caught. And you probably won't.
A bollywood movie has a scene of two friends visiting eiffel tower at night and it is clearly shown in that scene .
I have a video of the eiffel tower at night. Made it myself, everybody did it
There's a korean drama where they filmed at the Eiffel tower at night =-=
Ended up learning a lot about copyright. Thanks Suho.
That is so dumb, I mean I get why copyright is necessary but, c’mon.
Funny I took like 50 photos of it on my trip oops
So you can copyright buildings now..
I am as capitalist as I come, but this is ridiculous.
The earth is flat and up is simply up. Water rolls down hill
Thank you that was informative
Me: *searches Eiffel Tower at Night*\nGoogle: *comes up with a lot of images*\nMe: well.
*Disney puts Christmas lights on Mickey Mouse\nOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS SAFE
So we cant take photos and not post it?
Kind of scary, but I guess it makes sense.
What a load of shit
So u cannot take pics and vids at all? For Ads and for just personal memory?
So when they lit the tower red white and blue and people took pictures and posted it on social media it was illegal?
This video is just fake shit i go to paris almost everyweek , me and millions of other's take pictures of the museum at night and no police gets on me for it
I'd take my chances against this law.
Weird and over spesific. This video was about copyright law\n\nSkip the clickbait example next time
stuff like this is why i hate humanity....wish we would stop being retarded....thx for the vid tho i didnt know this until now
I literally have a picture of the Eiffel Tower at night hanging on my bed right now😂
How about the rata touei in Disney movie? It has the Eiffel tower at night
what happens if u taka a pic of it and post it?
didnt that dodgy webdriver torso yt channel upload a video of the Eiffel tower at night (called '00014')
What if you're not from France? Are they going to come to North Korea and come get me for taking a picture of a building?
waaait, and the movie American warewolf in París?
That's another retarded law for ya.
Happy now that I've watched it, Youtube?
Who else searched up Eiffel tower at night on Google
The censorship looks like I'm watching Japanese porn. lol
Opps I have a night pic....\n\n\n\n\n\nHahahahha hahahahha jk my mom does
Welp, I’ve broken the law
Now you make me want to take and share pics of that tower at night. I am going to Google pics right after this statement.
Dude fuck copyright for buildings it litterally requires no skill like makr a giant rectangle there fucking building also fuck France where american id like to see them try and persacute an american for that shit have america say nope and if france starts war we win and pillage there resorces or they just move on and we all get along
People don’t generally go to jail for copyright infringement
Is this a prank?
but didnt show it to anyone
tell that to China :)
SUHOoo bad mom set a example for your children.
*ILLEGIRL~* \n\n\nsorry I just have to
or instead of sqaurespace you could learn to code for free
Bitch I'll go to France rn and take all the pictures I want at night
Anyone can take a picture of it at night ur just not allowed to use it for commercial use.
Well search up Eiffel Tower Night View On Google:P
What if you're from a country that doesn't give a fuck?
I love this series. But it's a little different than twl. But I still like it
The message from 0:39 to 0:41\n\nWhat the jiminy crickets did you just flaming say about me, you little bozo? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Cub Scouts, and I've been involved in numerous secret camping trips in Wyoming, and I have over 300 confirmed knots. I am trained in first aid and I'm the top bandager in the entire US Boy Scouts (of America). You are nothing to me but just another friendly face. I will clean your wounds for you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this annual trip, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying those shenanigans to me over the Internet? Think again, finkle. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of MSN friends across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the seminars, man. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your bake sale. You frigging done, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can tie knots in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in road safety, but I have access to the entire manual of the United States Boy Scouts (of America) and I will use it to its full extent to train your miserable butt on the facts of the continents, you little schmuck. If only you could have know what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your silly tongue, But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goshdarned sillyhead. I will throw leaves all over you and you will dance in them. You're friggin done, kiddo.\n\n-The Animator.\n\n(Honestly, this took me around a few minutes, lol.)
I didnt even know this
I'm too busy sleeping at night to break this law\n\n\n\n\nNeither do I live in France
Same is true for the Atomium in Brussels, Belgium. \nThat you should have protection from someone building a duplicate of your building I can agree too. But if you put your structure into a public space then photos & videos of it should not fall under copyright law unless someone makes a movie or documentary about just this one structure.\nBut a Travel docu about Paris for example, with clips of various buildings etc, should definitely not be protected. Have them put their oh so copyrighted work of art into a Museum, then they can set house rules regarding photos and video :-)
They aren't...\n\n*the end*
Google it. There's 100s of returns
So basically if your not a business owner you can still take a picture this video is such a waste of time
what the fuck are these laws? they're in the fucking public, they're meant for the public
1:05 that was a panorama of Edinburgh!! I feel like I have gotten a feature in this video..
Actually I just looked up Eiffel Tower and the very first pic was at night
fuck that! I'll take thousands of pictures anyway, they don't have jurisdiction in my country. Light waves and photons CANNOT be copyrighted!!!
Look at this bulls-t law in France
It may be illegal to take the Eiffel Tower at night but you will not be arrested and put in jail, I'm sure the police are not even aware of it
Bullshit let’s put videos of the eiffel towers and put so much ads so we get money 😎😎😎
1:25 lol the top comment is boring video...
nice ad
Thats shit omg
sell out lol
Lawyers are slowly killing society.
We're lucky miraculous exists😂😂
That’s fuckin dumb

Ok I'm going to say it as a female....Anna's boobs look great. As well as her hair.
I totally agree with not worrying so much about having the house neat and spotless and worry about spending time with my daughters.
So glad you've found yourself again. Be comfortable in your own skin Anna because you truly are an inspiration to others. Keep up the brilliant work as a human and a mother x
who is this beauty trending on Youtube???Who is this milk of magnesia? What does she want with me?
😂😂 omg your response to plastic surgery, “we daily vlog” like hello people, she couldn’t hide facial surgery if she’s vlogging everyday. Haha! You look beautiful, so proud of you being so real and honest
I just want to thank you and Jonathan for choosing to document so much of your lives with us. I cannot express the love and joy you bring to me and all your fans every single day. You are just so raw and real it's refreshing. I hope more people become like you, don't listen to haters there just the scum of the earth. Little low lifes who want nothing more than to be where you are xx
Anna your eye makeup looks so nice xxxx
Your long hair makes you look so much younger omg !!!!
You look stunning Anna 😀
Love this video <3
Please do a video on how you're not going to do videos any more. That would be great.
Crazy to think Anna is only 3 years older than me and she’s got her whole life sorted out. I don’t even have a boyfriend/husband 😭😂
Annnaaaa! So nice to have an update. Ignore the silliness of people talking about you having had 'work'. They are just in disbelief that you are such a beautiful woman. Keep on doing you. Watching you guys from here in Uganda. Have a lovely week xoxoxo
Hello Anna! Have you ever heard the name Audra? We chose that name for our first girl and just love it. Thought of you when you were talking about A names. Plus you can really use a tongue roll with it. Haha.
You are so pretty and I wish I could meet you and the others ❤
Who is the youngest viewer
How cool would it be if Jonathan would let the camera film Emilia and Edouardo interacting with Alessia when they know you're not watching them.\nLove u guys<3
Omg you want a 4th baby?? 😍❤️
really love your hair here!
Let me be your 400th dislike...
Anna, you’re so beautiful, I’ve been following you for 5yrs now and you get better with age x
Did she say: she has 3 and wants another.😭\n👧👴👶👶
Anna, you are just gorgeous, and so sweet and real--so happy for you and your sweet family!!  💕 Lisa
Anna, thanks for sharing your Q&A! I always enjoy your chats. The story about Emilia and Eduardo was so funny. 😃 Never a dull moment with kids! BTW, you look so beautiful, and I love your hair! 💖💖
You really looks stunning, looks so happy and amazing! 😍 I have never thought about this before but you look like Jennifer Lopez, love love love your hairstyle and the color 😍 keep up the good work Anna! ☺️💕 love from Sweden
What's this channel all about?? Kids?? 🤔😁
Going to show this video to my hairdresser cause I need this hair color!!! Its beautiful!
Who cares
Anna and I are literally the same person 😊♥️
Are this the person True geordie is talkin about
I love you so much Anna, you are incredible 💗so beautiful 💕✨🌸☁️💗xoxo
Your whole bit about how you deal w keeping a tidy home made me cry 😢 thank you! That is such a good way to look at/deal with it 💞💞💞💞 xoxo
A lovely video Anna I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):)
Wow u look so much like j lo there
Wait, Anna's only 29?!  Huh!
YAY
I'm half Italian and my siblings and I all have French names! So does my mum!
You start to look like JLO 😊
Your eye makeup is stunning !😍x
She has a bit of a irish accent am i right??
I love the name Alessia :)
Hi Anna, thanks for sharing a little tidbit of yourself. I wonder what Emelia & Eduardo’s newest adventure code will be..lol.. Just wait till they get Alessia involved when she grows up..lolI don’t have Snapchat or Instagram so thanks for sharing this vlog. You&your family are lovely. Take care & see ya : )
Rumours?! Clearly I’ve been blind to everything...
Francesca is my middle name. Also a family name. ❤️
Does anyone know the song at the end?
Do you walk all the dogs at the same time? Id like to see that in a vlog :D
I love your hair in this video! You look stunning xx
U have a brother? Never saw him
I think people think you have had plastic surgery because you look so different from when you guys first started vlogging. Your makeup is drastically different, the dark eye color and orange hair made you look older. People change, you can change your makeup and hair color and look completly different.
can anyone tell me how to open up description/info box on desktop with the new YT interface? :(
Aw Anna! You're such a lovely lady! I love watching your videos!!
I love that your doing 3 videos a week. Missed you Anna
Are you going to show your Fall/ Halloween decorations? I always like to see these.
Girl, you look so gorgeous! Like a greek goddess! Is it creepy if I say your curves look fabulous?
Seeing her childern with that pout I believe she has not done any lip job 😘😍
You have Grown into Such a Wonderful Lady.. So many Changes Anna, in you Attitude and Really matured beautifully.,💖💖
Could you PLEASE share some insights on having a family in the spotlight, like especially because you are mainly social media based. How do you protect them? Do you get threats? Could you be real about your struggles? For all the moms thinking about blogging but torn about how much exposure to give their children? Any advise?
Would love you to do a skin care and/or hair care routine video!!
Anna you are a RAY OF LIGHT! <3
Keep it up, Anna! I love your hair, you look beautiful!
Filled with so much gratitude that you are back to uploading AND blogging! <3
Your foundation looks amazing! What foundation is it?
I am glad you're back.  I've missed your vlogs!  You're one of my favorites.  :)
You know how people think that you have botox, in your face. should take it as a compliment.
I’m i the only one who thinks she looks like Jennifer Lopez?
I think people forget that Anna is still only 29 and also is natural beautiful. Not every body needs or wants Botox!
Literally made me feel 100 times better today. I have two kids one is a month old and the other 3 and she has the worse cold. No washing done and no cleaning I feel so guilty but seeing this made me feel so much better
You're so sweet, Anna :-)
Love this video so much😍😍Well done Anna😘😘
Hi Anna so glad u came back and you don't have to explain yourself to us and love u see u guys in Glasgow
👍So happy your back Anna😗
When you're so pretty they think you've had plastic surgery.
That earring story was SO funny! My girls were 3 years apart and they used to scheme. But more often, my littler one would prank or mess with my older one.
Tits
Oh pls stfup 😴
You look so pretty Anna! I do think you look younger but I think it's from the kids being around you have so much more energy!
Anna, you look a little like JLO😊
Anna you are So beautiful❤️
I stepped on a pack of good lads too...lol
Yeeey excited for a new video! Your skin and your hair looks so amazing!! 😍\nBTW any small youtubers wanna support each other? 💪🤗💕
I agree when you have a little more weight on you it does make you look more youthful I also think you look so much better now a lot more healthier and also realistic to every women our there and being honest about juggling children , work  and workouts and something had to give we all do this as working mom's and I'm so glad your honest about this issue also .keep doing you and what's best for your family we are just mommy's trying to keep it real 😀
Halloween 🎃 House Tour?😍
U look beautiful
The earrings trap story was the funniest!! 😂 looking gorgeous Anna 💕
Great video x
love your video anna
You are stunning
Rock On !!!!!!!
You're so stunning Anna!
Welcome backkkk :)
Your Hair 😍😍
really enjoyed this x
So gorgeous Anna😘X
PPD isn't because you have time to sit around and be depressed....I had my 3rd child in December and let me tell you, I'm struggling with the worst PPD ever. So good for you who doesn't have time to be depressed because I don't either but it happened. I cannot control it.
Alessia sounds like a name my 4 year old would make up during playtime.
Had no idea Anna had a brother?!
How do u afford 3 kids while UK is so expensive and you want a fourth one hehehehehehe
No cos you said we only film a few bits a day. Your cheeks are huge . Liar
Funny how when you talk about plastic surgery you say you didn't get your lips filled or Botox but you don't talk about the things you DID get done because that would be outright lying.  Anyone who used to know you (wink wink) knows you got your nose and your boobs done.
you look 40.
As usual, I underestimated how long the podcast would take to upload, but it's already available at www.showmakers.fm, and will be on the youtube channel soon.\n\nPlease check out Brilliant too, it's a fantastic site and fits my channel perfectly: http://bit.ly/2xDcRNe
When created, RODS FROM GOD.
Sellout Mr. Theeta?
https://goo.gl/rM7CTt
might as well just further improve long range laser beam thing thingy turret thing
Most likely wouldn’t be heard in the comment section but this is how I would solve for the rods constantly destroying itself.\n\nConductive oil/lubricant. Or even lubricant or oils.
Ey mate I like that you introduce all this cool science stuff and even give US a Chance to try it out. Almost majes me feel Bad that im such SMA dumbo
Does not seem like rail guns are the solution to much of anything. Rail guns require an impressive power source, whereas chemicals are so much more simpler. In fact the good solution seems to be liquid propellant. Also you get such diminishing returns in high velocity because air resistance goes up so fast relative to velocity.
why do u need this when i could just flick a coin up and make a finger gun
This gun is the armor killer
This technology was already used in Final Fantasy 8. Esthar  scientists shot Squall and Rinoa into space to Lunar Station.
Your voice reminds me of someone from FNV: Honest Hearts, Follows-Chalk I think
cowardice america needs desperate hype advertising-we need minimum of 50 allies or no war =cowards and hype to cloak lackey truth
us ships will crash into each other as always...not a prob\n\nor on island\n\nor on pelicans\n\non basically everything
REGION LOCK THIS FOR KOREA!!!!
Is It just a metal stick or does It have any gunpowder in It?
One EMP blast and its useless
The second biggest boondoggle after the F-35\nLiterally the heat is melting the rails...limiting the rail gun to a few shots before it breaks...LOL
Isn't easier to make stronger bullts
What about a tungsten coating or alloy to offset the thermal problem, or even using a liquid nitrogen cooling system?
Real talk for a sec, without even watching the video i can tell its bullshit because the actual most powerful gun is secret.
Could something like this be applied to a rifle design?
Late to the party. China has bigger better faster guns then US. Which explains why American just floated around SE chinasea and now just talk w NK. Lol they are laughing like the rest of the world. Funny how Americans just talk and no more walk.
Going to the last part of the video (the advert)\nAh yes- something that is missing in pretty much all schools:\nIf you made a mistake- be told why it's wrong.
I want to learn more about engineering. I don’t know nearly enough.
1:13 the explosion is from an underwater nuclear test (1946)
CLICKBAIT
soon: solar powered renewable warfare
Narrated by Tom Branson.
the LaWS is wayyyy coooler
BAE Systems 😩👌
okke
False: Chuck Norris is most powerful gun
who the hell needs universal healthcare anyways?
Shoot Someone with it
Yes, I understand some of these words
Forget railguns. we already have the technology to finish operation: Star Wars
I have a rail gun on gta 5
Whether you love the US or hate the US we are the best chance Ally countries have at surviving war regardless of how crappy our leadership is at the moment. I'm so glad I live in the USA! Very interesting video btw!
Make it like the mini gun roataing barrles. In masseffect there guns use two barrles to help cool the gun before it overheated. So make our rail gun like a mini gun.
Most powerful pfft my farts is the clear winner
Okay but when will we be running around in Power Armour carrying a small one of these at our waists and ripping through aliens and shit like in Halo
BAE systems is not from usa DUH
Fuck this
Dilbert would be proud
Neat

video on hypersonic rockets?
1:27 why did you use Angola as target example, that's very rude and offensive
Make a video about Gas propulsion Engine
Nice video.\nInteresting how you showed bombarding Angola during the range comparison
A railgun? Now all you need is a Metal Gear to carry it.
Effectively a rail gun is the Justice League Space Station that orbits earth. Using the Stations mega gun requires the entire stations energy, and once fired, shuts down the station of all electric power for the next hour. It only retains orbit via emergency backup generators. Wow.
*generic comment about the US military that makes me an expert
Subscribe to my channel CJ Collins
Trump is America's most powerful gun, because he destroys anything he gets near!
At least it's not 1.21 gigawatts.
No better catalyst for technological advances than war
Yes..... The perfect thing to wipe out humanity from the face of the earth.
I think all guns bombs and weapons *not knifes* should be thrown away crushed and then thrown into the ocean for a long away generation to find then blow up the planet and not us :) im **copyright cannot show** and i think the government are stupid in some ways
Their most powerful weapon is not confront strong countries. Only peasants in Afghanistan and Vietnam.
I need this for protection
Knew it was a rail gun I'm so dumb
They'd be amazing in space. No air friction. I'd be bad-ass. You could even destroy entire buildings on the surface with such a thing. The moon, mars, even the sun. Space forts. Rail-mail  People are strange.
Leave Angola alone!
The US military's most powerful gun... built and designed by the British.
5:28 We'll also need them for the covenant.
now do Germany
Lets make a mini dearh star!!

Considering there's talk about an asteroid the size of a country has a chance to hit us, having a giant railgun in space isn't a bad idea
I used to live like 50 steps from the military base that they shot this video at dalgren naval base in Virginia
I wish this guy is my physics teacher
2:45 fuck that screen
Was that a nuke 1:17
25 megawatts of power. 25 megawatts, 25 megawatts. \nOh boy Einstein....
You said the current rail only lasts a few shots, that is incorrect.  It lasts hundreds of shots but it is short of the qualitative requirement for 1000 shots.
A rail gun?? What’s next a metal gear
I'm sure it can be built in less than 50 years.
The U.S. militaries technology is at least 20 years ahead of a US regular folks technology. Of course THEY want THEM to believe this is the best THEY have.
Add 0.1th of a gram of antimatter on the tip of a round and you can practically destroy a tank or a house with one shot from a handgun.
Why, when on restricted mode, can't I view this video? It's more about math and magnetism than war, and destruction.  Come on youtube!  Keep working on these, Real Engineering! Your videos are awesome!
Similar to the MAC cannon from halo
Except there are treaties about the militarization of space, as in you can't, and railguns wouldn't be allowed most likely
Be care full not to explain it to deeply otherwise your enemy will use it against you
So...the man-portable railgun from MGS4 is probably not practical in the slightest, then
Say don’t rail guns also work in space because no explosion is necessary?
I would consider the atomic Annie to be the most powerful gun to be honest.
Can you do an episode about different was to extract oil/gas from the ground? Feel like you would like learning about it, if you don't know much already
Anyone else notice the Canadian flag at 0:51
Wouldn't the acceleration at the moment of the shot destroy a satellite that was to be sent to orbit by it?
A Certain Scientific Railgun. Always comes to my mind whenever I hear, or think of Railguns.
Imagine this going through your body *ROBLOX OOF*
2:25 wrong way around, the current should be flipped. Fleming left hand rule. This isnt a generator.
What is the effect of a massive EMP on one of these railguns?
Still can't win the war in Iraq or Vietnam though and many others lol
It fires 100 dollar bills (USD) fashioned into ammunition.
Good job! Should have talked(more) about its vulnerability from heat seeking missiles and counter-measures taken, too.
I love the cabinet and the way you've organised it. 😍
It’s not the table. I think it’s the picture above it. You should leave the table and replace the picture with something smaller.
can you do a scrapbooking vid🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Boy cats who wee a lot in the wrong place even though they're fixed might have kidney stones.  It happens a lot to fixed males and he could be trying to tell you something
Also could you do an updated video all about your scrap booking?
Omg that carrot cutter is GENIUS
Whenever I cry when I’m being over emotional my mum and brother always laugh at me 😂
9:00 what is that song?
Hey gab you think you can help me out with a lil shout out for my channel to get started?

Cats like plastic because it has a smell to them that’s like cat pheromones. I know a boy cat called Snickers that CANNOT be trusted around plastic packaging.
Hey Gabriella, I usually don't comment, but I watch your videos all the time... I thought that if you turn your leaf print to portrait instead landscape it might look better with a smaller cabinet. xx
you're both so cute can i pls join your squad
Your the first person who I’ve heard that is exactly like me! Literally the week before my period I can never get full! And I crave everything! Of course not healthy stuff lol
Gabby your literally me when I am pms crying to my friends on FaceTime and them laughing at me, usually I cry about wanting pizza 😂😂
honestly, your videos literally make my day i love watching them so much<333
Gabi I’d love to know if bean is gonna stay with you or live at your mums ❤️
I don't know why I'm crying - legit me last week outside of college before my period on the phone to my mum.
Something about your vlogs are so addictive!
Loved it i am glad youre vlogging more!:) \nAnd i love the 2 of you together;)!  Xxx
When I last went to Brighton early sept and was so windy along the beach I had wind swept hair. Also went to the pier I see u did so much better at the arcades than me as when I went only won 4 tickets but no prizes and as didn't spend long enough or have enough coins that could use in arcades I didn't win any prizes but now I'm saving all my pennies from 1p to 50p to have a big bag for when I next go back to Brighton hopefully next year now in about April time
You know things get serious when you put your hair up in a bun

Whats the name of the website that the print is from of the sky above sheffield??
Are the walls in Gabriella's living room purple or grey? 🙈
Don’t usually bother commenting on videos but this is my favourite vlog this year! ❤️
U should put like small tables on either side of the cabinet to fill the space up. Just an idea.😉😄
I normally get really upset when people cry, but cause she said it's PMS I couldn't stop laughing bc same 😂
Those adverts are really annoying.
I need the link for the print!!!! OMG I need that in my life right now!!!
What the heck is with the carrot scissors!? That's ingenious 😍 so much easier than them pinging off the chopping board. Wow. Need that haha
Non

I wanted to go to your concert but I couldn't because of my brother
Lyrics:\n\nWhatever It Takes\n\nFalling too fast to prepare for this\nTripping in the world could be dangerous\nEverybody circling is vulturous\nNegative, Nepotist\n\nEverybody waiting for the fall of man\nEverybody praying for the end of times\nEverybody hoping they could be the one\nI was born to run, I was born for this\n\nWhip, whip\nRun me like a racehorse\nHold me like a rip cord\nBreak me down and build me up\nI wanna be the slip, slip\nWord upon your lip, lip\nLetter that you rip, rip\nBreak me down and build me up\n\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do whatever it takes\nCause I love how it feels\nWhen I break the chains\n\nWhatever it takes\nYa take me to the top, I'm ready for\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do what it takes\n\nAlways had a fear of being typical\nLooking at my body feeling miserable\nAlways hanging on to the visual\nI wanna be invisible\n\nLooking at my years like a martyrdom\nEverybody needs to be a part of 'em\nNever be enough from the particle sum\nI was born to run, I was born for this\n\nWhip, whip\nRun me like a race horse\nHold me like a rip cord\nBreak me down and build me up\nI wanna be the slip, slip\nWord upon your lip, lip\nLetter that you rip, rip\nBreak me down and build me up\n\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do whatever it takes\nCause I love how it feels\nWhen I break the chains\n\nWhatever it takes\nYa take me to the top, I'm ready for\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do what it takes\n\nHypocritical, egotistical\nDon't wanna be the parenthetical\nHypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of\nOut of the box an epoxy to the world\nAnd the vision we've lost\nI'm an apostrophe\nI'm just a symbol to remind you\nThat there's more to see\n\nI'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe\nAnd yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half diseased\nAnd when I am deceased\nAt least I go down to the grave and I happily\nLeave the body of my soul to be a part of me\nI do what it takes\n\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do whatever it takes\nCause I love how it feels\nWhen I break the chains\n\nWhatever it takes\nYa take me to the top, I'm ready for\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do what it takes
I WAS AT YOUR CONSERT IN ST.PAUL!!!! YOU GUYS DID AWESOME!
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH

CUZ' I LOVE THE ADRENALINE IN MY VEINS, I DO WHATEVER IT TAKES!
I do whatever it takes to make it \nBreakthrough anything im... oh wait wrong song
Listen to what the Lord God says, God of the Christian, God of all the earth: I AM come -- be there, son. You. You -- and the others will follow. My son -- I see your heart. Will I reject a son? But come! Come to Me -- and I will bring you to drink from the fountain of life -- My Fountain -- My river flowing directly from My throne. I see -- I am a seeing prophet, according to my God. -- I see: You, your BROTHER -- then the rest who know of your sincerity in all you do -- turning your eyes, raising them up from the cinder you stand in, allowing the light to shine upon you as the building you're standing in caves in around you, leaving you unharmed.
Dude i wanna meet this guy not including Live preformance ill do Whatever it Takes
There are 4k thumbs down 😱any buddy who put a thumbs down has no heart 😑best song ever 🙄

Imagine Dragons is on fire this year....Dan Reynolds sped up vocals are too good and the music by the band members shows how much effort goes into creating a masterpiece like this...... Keep it up Imagine Dragons for this one 👍👍👌👍👌👌👌👌

your grandad is a joy to watch haha
Bent him over the machine and gave him the finger treatment cause he were paralysed and crying I honestly lost my shit 😂😂😂
Tom, your grandad got it the wrong way around.  If the royal standard (the flag that was above Buckingham palace in your vlog) is flown, the queen is in residence.  If the Union Jack is flown, the queen is NOT in residence.
Your grandad is Amazing! We Love GORDON! ❤️
*Britishness intensifies*
I was in absolute hysterics from the phone call at the end. GORDON FOR PRIME MINISTER!
Had the time of his life :D
*Before watching this video.*\nAw hes so cute, so awesome. Keep it up Gordon!\n\n*After*\nYoo Gordon a savage! Bashing heads, finger treatment!
gordon is so adoreable! i love this vlog
@___b.en__
Im suprised he hasnt punched you
@ronanmcmahon740
How can none of them know the national anthem. That's ridiculous.
don't mess with Gordon or he will smash your face in.
Man like Gordon😂.. what a savage Legend!! ❤️😎
I went on the hms belfast on a field trip when i used to go to school in england. I didnt remember seeing all them statues of people there tho
Best grandad in the world!

The flag that was flying means that she is in. They fly the British standard if she isn’t in . Mainly she lives in Windsor palace

Really enjoyed this, I love your grandad. Subbed X
Legit saw a ghost on the HMS when I was there a few months ago
£2.50!! for a cone? jesus
I have subscribed to your instagram and I am @aideen1970
Every Vlog from now on I am going to write this ♡ Day 196!
Oh you mean this carl😂😂 I laugh so hard😂
Hate to say it but Gordon is wrong! When the Union Flag 🇬🇧flys above the palace the queen is NOT home, when the Royal Standard flys  above the palace like in the video it shows the Queen is home
@rodria040526
Gordon is the best!!!
6 ads 40 minutes
Gordon is a LEGEND!!!!
Old people are the best
Man like Tom on trending and all that.
The queen is in when the royal standard is flying like the one in the vlog, not the Union Jack
Tom you should take your granddad to la with you
Your granddad is so freaking adorable!!
You should go on a helicopter ride and fly over London, it is the best experience ever.
Dude you have the coolest Grandad! Plz make more videos like this!!!!
So this video has barley 200k views and is in the trending section and has 8 ads in it... okay...\n\nThis guy also conned his fans.
▒█▀▀▀█ ▒█▀▀█ ░█▀▀█ ▒█▀▄▀█ ▒█▀▄▀█ ▒█▀▀▀ ▒█▀▀█ █ \n░▀▀▀▄▄ ▒█░░░ ▒█▄▄█ ▒█▒█▒█ ▒█▒█▒█ ▒█▀▀▀ ▒█▄▄▀ ▀ \n▒█▄▄▄█ ▒█▄▄█ ▒█░▒█ ▒█░░▒█ ▒█░░▒█ ▒█▄▄▄ ▒█░▒█ ▄
I think you’ll find the queen and royal family bring in money too Tom. Lots and gives our country a identity and shows our tradition and history.
Your Grandad needs his own Insta!! Who cares about people's cats and dogs, I wanna see a page about Gordon!❤
#10 on trending tom
That is exactly what is wrong with these kids nowadays.. look there is drake. Who drake the rapper?.. no.. Drake who saved us from the  armada. Even when you google drake its the rapper ffs.. wild.
And this is the place where I killed many police officers and royal guards in Assassins creed syndicate
Did tom just say why do we need a Queen... Does he not realise that all changes to the UK and all changes to the law in the UK she has to approve or disapprove even if the UK Prime Minister wants it or not. The queen out votes them all
The flag above the palace was the Royal Standard meaning the Queen was in residence. The union Jack is flown when she is not.
Your grandad is the cutest!!! 😂😊
I didn't know Tom knew boulevard of broken dreams
That ending tho! 😂
Seen how many ads, skipped the video, wasteman.
I HAVE THAT BATMAN V SUPERMAN POSTER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel so happy that I have something in common with tom (apart that we are both from Manchester)
Your right tom about the pendolino or technically class 390 its max speed is 140mph but only goes 125mph
I remember meeting tom at Euro gamer 2013 outside the building in front of the surgeon van I was wearing a Minecraft creeper t-shirt
i think toms business syndicate original should sell a light grey jackets just like cordons. id buy that shit! gordon is a legend
Why is this guy so unlikable?? His mug on the thumbnail and his voice fnbA b
Some of Russia is in Europe some of its in aisa it's weird
I FOUND AARON RAMSEY!!
Russia is in Asia bro...
Is Tom's grandad from his mum's or dad's side?.
I love how liza keeps advertising for Calvin Kleins woman sports bra every now and then
This is me talking to my Cousin...kind of... or myself in general!😂Luv U Liza!
I like your young self Liza 😍😍😍😂
Liza like the new beats ad didn't skip lol!!😂😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Lol when baby Liza at the end said ohhhhh u watched the whole video! THATS DOPPEEEEEEE UUHHH
Hi Lisa I really love your channel and I just finished watching freakish on hulu and wanted to tell you its an amazing show waiting for season 2. And are you cheating on David with Grover?
Best video iv'e seen in a while
Rap:are you sucka mc's got a fetish with me cause I'm cute and I'm smart I'm a little baby ahuah
You are brilliant, beautiful, hilarious, perky, and beyond talented, even though if we’d gone to high school together I was such an introvert and would never have been able to be your friend. I wouldn’t be surprised if you did a great deal more television and bigger media in the immediate and foreseeable future. I love you tons!!! Let’s be friends! Yeah.... I know... I’m dreaming.
IF YOU ARE READING THE COMMENTS BEFORE WATCHING THE VIDEO MAKE SURE YOU WATCH THE END ITS THE BEST PART 😝😝

Lizza you fucking scared the ever living shit out of me oh my god i was just watching ricky and twaimz scary video and then i watched this with a headset when the vid starts it felt like someone was next to me talking btw im in the dark thats why it was scary 🙂
Why doesn't this video have more dislikes?
I remember when she has like 5 million subs and now she has ALMOST 15 MILLION \n\nMy lil brown girl is so amazing
Hey, ask Helga if she had to chose, if she would chose her donkey or Jet
I don't get it. It says Wednezzdays with lizza but I never get her videos on a Wedenzzday. \n\n\nI wonder...
Liza:whats your favorite toy...?\nLittle Liza:story.\nLiza:whats your favorite show...?\nLittle Liza:and tell.\n me: thats so me
I can’t say this anymore times, Liza is an amazing beautiful talented girl. I can’t believe she makes videos instead of being a model she has the perfect smile perfect personalities but I’m so happy she uses her life to make others happy what a perfect person she is, if you are saying that I can’t know this because I haven’t seen her in person. That’s not true I have been with Liza since she started YouTube and since she started vine\n\nYou r awesome and keep doin you boo boo

This is so funny. You always  make me happy when I'm sad.😄

It's four am, my boyfriend is sleeping next to me and tomorrow/today he need to get up early and I'm here trying not to pee myself and wake him up while looking at your video. Seriously you are the best, love ya and please keep going!
When Liza asked what is the dirtiest letter in the alphabet baby Liza should've said u ohhhhhhhhhhhh meme
Why does baby Liza remind me of Fez from that 70’s show
“ *gasp* you watched the whole video? DAS SO FWEAKIN DOOOPAAAHHH!!” I love it 😭😂😭
What is the difference between a peck and a kiss? \n\nThe difference is tongue - Kim Namjoon.
Is it just me or Liza's videos are TOO short 😭😭😭 I wait for them but they pass like lightnings 💔
Does anyone else scroll through the comments and you read an awesome comment and you wish you were the one that wrote it?! \n\n\n\n\nugh... it sucks 😂🙄😢
I omg i love the very end😂😂thats so fricken doppeeaaaa
U look like a joke before you make a joke
You should to “ask preteen Liza” (see early Halloween video)
I wish all of Liza's characters were all real people
Can yall sub to my channel😄 it would mean a lot💪
Baby Liza : you watched the whole video?! THAT'S FRICKEN DOPE!! 😂😂😂😂
I want to see you, David, Kristen, and Scotty all do the best friend vs boyfriend/girlfriend challenge
That rap at the end was legit
Liza,  you have Russian fans, know this!!!!
2:49 did an army ask this question
I'll bet you 727273636E82 $ \n\nThat u didn't read the number or saw the letter I want my like 😁

Colab with Georgia Production
You watched the hole video! THATS SO FREAKING DOPEA!
You guys...y'all literally have me in tears right now. i just read the comments and most of them are about DK and i am just really really happy. People talking about him and his visuals is a very rare occurence and now it's finally happening. i am so freaking happy. I am DK and Jun biased and in their units' MVs, carats have been talking about things that they rarely talked about them before (Jun's vocals, DK's visuals). Since early this year, my biases from other groups have been getting more and more recognition and I am so glad it's happening for my biases in svt as well. This has been a year for my biases and I can't thank y'all enough for hyping them up. They deserve this so freaking much. <3
If the unit songs are this good. Imagine the title song, its gona be lit! \n\nGet ready to get a new wig on nov 6 yall 😆
I want to be as sharp as DK’s nose🙏🏿
I'm not regret to be a carat ❤️ I'm not regret to slip into diamond life ❤️ They are my first stan of kpop group ❤️ Their songs make me feel comfortable ❤️ I know many famous kpop group, I like their song I like their dance but I'm not interested on them ( I dk why?)I think it's because I hate to recognize many members name and face at the first. But seventeen gives me the feeling that I can't see in other group. I asked myself , why the hell I recognizing 13 members face and name rather than 5 6 7 members? I dk ? Seventeen makes me can't control myself for knowing them. I'm just regret that I didn't went to their DE WORLD TOUR TT^TT I know them few months before DE WORLD TOUR. I thought I won't fall into it so I didn't went to their world tour , but I'm wrong .. I fall into diamond life very deep now. TO KPOP FANS THAT HAVENT FALL INTO DIAMOND LIFE . I CAN SAY THAT YOU WONT REGRET TO FALL INTO IT ! LET'S STAN TALENTED KPOP GROUP !
Even though I don't know the language, Everything about this was perfect! From the opening lines of the piano, to the vocals, the layering, the emotions and the mv and its visuals....ugh, so so good. Thank you as always, Seventeen!
Woozi's style and concept are just like mine, that's why I love all of Seventeen's song. Woozi is the best producer plus Seventeen being a very talented idols. This group is perfect. I love how every members are unique and have their own role in the group. SEVENTEEN is a group like no other. Just like what Hoshi said, their energy is different than others. I'll stan them for life.\n\nThank you Seventeen for debuting. I've been stan them since Adore U and never leave them since then.\n\nI must have slipped into the diamond life too hard, or maybe I've drown.......hehehehe
SVT is getting bigger and bigger. im so proud
Those 183 who disliked this are deaf. Let's just pray for them lmao jk
LEE SEOKMIN SERVING US VISUALS JDNCVDSCKNIDHSNCVF MY BIAS OMG
Omg dk visual isn't kidding '0'
seoksoo did that
Woozi looks so menly and cool with vest. Oh, he is gentleman
At first i wonder why scoups really like this song.. now i know... svt never disappoint us if it comes to music and talents... aaaaaa really love it.. sounds of heaven
I love you forever my precious 17 and Jeonghan oppa!! I just wanna marry him and live happily ever after!! I will love our 17 oppadeul till death!!
the end asmr sounds more like the sea than the rain or the wind... it's nice...
I never knew what heaven sounded like until I heard this.
i don't even know what the lyrics mean but this makes my insides ache ajshsjs
Every song that vocal team releases is SO GOOD and I love it but I wish Pledis didn't always make them sing ballads and try something more upbeat for once :/
1.46! Isn't that Hoshi voice?Correct me of I'm wrong 😊
this song is makes me cry T.T
WOOZI'S VOICE ♥ ALL OF THEM- this song is just so soft and nice and breezy and beautiful- it's just such a sad, feel-good song, if that makes sense. :)

Carats love you Seventeen ♥ everything is so beautiful
i love them so much ;v;
One day after I slipped into the diamond life for one year♡♡\nBut I feel like I've known them forever🤣\nI wish I could've slipped into this diamond life when I was born 🤦🏻‍♀️
RESPECT!!! A BIG RESPECT TO SEVENTEEN👍👍👍
Such a beautiful song to start my day with 💖💖💖
ilove themm all because they are so perfect
This song is so good I got my non-Kpop friend humming this constantly. She both hates and loves me for it.
jeonghan is seriously art. seventeen is art. \ndang, i wish i found them sooner. good thing i woke up and stopped sleeping on this group, hope everyone does the same thing.
I should always have tissues beside me when I watch vocal unit, they always leave me teary eyed thinking about memories that never existed, they're so powerful <3
I cried all night listening to this song. When I lost my current self to depression, this song rescued me and made me smile for the next day until now. All the negativity I felt before were all gone, thanks to you Seventeen! For those who feel sad for this moment, please remember that you have others love, including me and all the Carats~ I'm glad that I'm stanning you guys since debut until now. ;)
Okay so after I got over my general fangirling I started thinking about how heavily this video (particulary the ending) correlates with the Al1 teasers from before. I also earlier (probably stupidly) assumed that these songs were the bridge between Al1 and the next comback, but I feel as if it's obviously a prequel of sorts. I was confused that it was 0.5 when 1.5 would be more accurate if it was the bridge between chapter 1 and 2 but if it's set before Al1 I wonder how that fits within the narrative. Woozi is shown holding a stopwatch, likely the one Vernon was holding in his teaser, and the one DK was using when he was trapped in his time loop of sorts. Joshua is by a phone. In the teasers it was Joshua who left those sad voicemails. I'm not sure when/how this video fits into the narrative, if it's set before or after the teasers but either way there is something going on with the plot here. My memory might be a bit hazy about some of the details of the teasers and i'll re-watch them before we get new content but honeslty I think it's really clever of Seventeen and that we are stanning the right group. Thanks if you read all this, lol

In short, drugs are made from fungi 😂😂😂
Just went to talk at the University of Minnesota with Dr Salomon presenting about this stuff. Extremely interesting and innovative.
Every time my mom puts a banana in my lunch its smell and taste gets somehow infused with the rest of the lunch. If you could make a video explaining this that would be great. Thanks!
From the cute 11 year old boy next to my house\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm 91
Evaluation is not blind.  Fungus (and all life) use resources gathered to best suite their needs.  Purposefully.  Even if that means evolving chemicals to ward off threats.  Perfect mutation is what leaves me to believe it is not random.
Is it just me, or do they use Dutch Haagel Slaag alot in their vidoes?
So hot!!!
im allergic to penicillin

Answer: my friends
would you do a video about wolves and their mating
From third world countries.
From the drug store, bruh
I dont know why but i get the best chills watching minuteearth and even get my eyes wet...
One teaspoon of soil a day will keep the doctor a stone's throw away.
The power of natural products
Simple - they come from mexico
Where Do Our Drugs Come From?
00:02 to 00:10\nThe REAL question is WHAT the hell is it in the remaining medications?
i think antibiotic or antimicrobe that bacteria pump out have another purpose. Some journal say it used for signaling neighbor microbe with chemical substance rather than killing them.
I just get it from that sketchy guy behind Walmart.
wait Minnesota!? thats the state i live in
How come researchers don't try mutating fungi to target the MRSA bacteria common in hospital? \n\nLike put a certain type of fungi that's enemy with the staf bacteria and see if it mutates after several generations to become resistant to the MRSA.
Hello, please provide translations, thank you.
Sooo...The ice cream truck isn't the only place to buy drugs?
The CIA is where they originally came from. LSD
Mostly colombia and Mexico
You're looking for a guy named Heisenberg, you didn't hear it from me😑
They came from the pharmacy, duh.
It’s from that Ugandan warlord
The world is brutal by nature, killing is a necessity to live.
It's a me a MaRIo...
Imagine the really useful ones they don't release to the public.
The art of XKCD and the voice of Marzipan from homestarrrunnner, it's a winning combination!
1:59  right hand column 4th one down,  we discovered aeroplanes from leeks?
Oh I thought this was about drugs like cocine, meth or others
We should get rid of the current education system and instead replace them with a movie like experience, where all the students get like ridiculously comfy chairs, a big screen with everyone in front of it, popcorn or snacks of any kind with drinks, and just play minute earth and minute physics videos. Guarantee you this, whatever the official number is for the amount of students that succeed through their lives will skyrocket compared to how it has been. An 8 year old could watch this and learn without confusion. This world is very far behind where it could already be, people like the people here at minute earth are what we need.
my plug, Kevin. shoutout to him
Easy drugs come from hell
Yes, the University of Minnesota is a major source of knowledge regarding medical research (I will get treatment there for chronic tmj)
penecilin dosnt exist anymore... newer and newer antibiotics have to be made all the time because with every new antibiotic comes resistance and adaption by the bacteria. Good luck this will be a massive problem eventually and everyone will get infected.
nice
1:05 - 1:26 *Cough cough* I am allergic to penicillin
Video wasn’t a minute long. Reported.
God like all things
I already have the smelly socks one :P
This was a waste....
In another universe, fungi and bacteria are taking Guns and Nuclear Weapons to treat their infections of humans.
So live in forest and start pharmacy!
My dealer usually makes me jerk him off, but never gives me the drugs. Why is that? He even pinky promised.
When theyre really imported from government officials
I thought you were gonna tell us ur dealer
What about the remaining 3/10 chemicals?
Biggest opium plantations are guarded by the military. Take a wild gues, DUURRRRR
2:20 This bacteria with stinky socks, made me smile;p
What about the other 3?
I'm now more curious about the other 3/10 drugs
Don't get me wrong, I like Kate's voice, but there's something... unusually high and squeaky about it. Does the recording software not do her voice justice? Or does she really sound like a chipmunk?
What do they say about the guy who brings mushrooms to the party?\n\nHe's a real fungi!\n\n**rimshot**
I live in mn
Thank you MinuteEarth, for always making content that keeps me excited about science and the subtle complexities of our world.
That was really interesting learning how those 3 drugs worked
I love you guys!
nature has created very cool things^^
I thought this was going to be a video about El Chapo
Just say no to drugs!

I like the disintegrating cars.
rocket man hit that car like he was wire guided
Dear Russia your not exposed to have kids with your brother or sister cuz it sure seems like you guys do
@5:02 they steered into the crash. So dumb
Russian insurance must be at a premuim
they should just ban driving, there
Damn I would hate to live in Russia
One schmuck is leading the green and the other is trimming the red--what did you THINK was going to happen?!
The drivers may be retardet (sic), but your spelling is retarded.
Russia love car crash.
2:53 yo...  \n3:01 YOOOOO!!!!
2:28 got what he deserved BMW driver !!!
What idiots learn to drive
WTF😱😱😱😱
But yeah it’s true automatic cars cannot be controlled @ higher speeds when braked in emergency 🚨
wow... the fuck is wrong with these people?
I am just wondering from where do russians get their driving license
Every single one of these accidents could have been avoided.
How many fucking ads are you going to put on ur shitty video
Thank you so much to Quidd for sponsoring us! Go get some Ryland, Drew, and Shane STICKERS here!!!!!! it's free!! http://bit.ly/2xs3Evj
awe the man at the door was sooooo sweet
*Gasp* There's three pieces! And there's three boys~\n\nBut one of them eats three pieces every time.\n\n😂😂😂😂
if your poor then im actually dust x,D not even dust i stopped existing
Shane is literally the best friend ever. Spending 1k for his friend's favorite food. Drew is damn lucky.
This video made me laugh so much. I love shane and drew so much. All of the little comments from drew make me laugh and that valet guy had me rollin.
I'm not a perfect person, theres many foods I wish that I had chewed, but I continue learning, I never meant to throw that pie at you.  XD
I love everyone in the video so much omg.
Those were under armor shoes
I'm the pile of grease😂
I gotta try that pizza if it’s good then. But I love me some good ole Papa Johns.
AND THE REASON IS FOOOOOODDD 💖💖💖
Drew is seriously my favorite in these videos 😂😂😂
Who else is watching this while eating pizza? Lol
I expected a bigger pizza
SHANE I HAVE A CHALLENGE FOR YOU - 100 WIO CREAM PIES AND CHOCOLATE IN THE FACE
i was deadass eating dominos while watching this and i have no regrets
$1 pizza? Sign me up girl, I'm broke. Like litterally me
He showed the minions on quid and I was waiting for the draggg👑👑
I downloaded the app so Shane will get more sponsorships lol 😂
The only thing shane will buy that is 1000 dollars or more for youtube is food... *honestly me though*
I love how sweet and happy everyone was in this video!!!
Shane, update. No one calls it pre-gaming anymore it's pre-party now.
Collected all the emojis from your collection before even watching this video lol
How does Shane not have the money to afford that without a sponsor? Or is that just a joke?
I'm so happy Shane got a sponsors, I wish he would get ads and much more so he can keep making videos
We're not allowed to film in here so i'm gonna take my phone.. -Shane Dawson
It's ridiculous to me how hilarious Drew is... like fuck get this bitch a comedy show
Me when I name candles\n\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When you rich but still a fat slob
You guys just made four new friends within a couple hours. It literally takes me eight months to make friends, actually singular, friend.
When you don’t skip the ads because you know Shane needs that $ back from that pizza 🍕 😂
That pizza looks so amazing... if only I had $1000 dollars to spend on a pizza
i LOVE how humble the employees are there. they could’ve easily been snippy and whatnot, like most restaurants that i’ve been to (that aren’t even nearly as expensive as this), but they’re all pretty sweet.
You should do a collab with the waitress
I LOVE SHANE IN HIS FANCY OUTFIT OHHHH MY GAWD BITCH I'M SHOOK ❤
Isn't it for iPhone???
I would actually be so awkward in a fancy place like that.
Shane: THE REASON IIIS FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD\nMe: have I found my twin .000.
Me at my funeral 100%!!! Btw you inspire me so much Shane!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
when drew is buttoning up his shirt in the car at like 7:07 he actually looks like a gay version of a vampire from some really low budget vampire romance movie 😂😂
it looks like someone just projectile vomited on a pizza
I barely got my mom get get the $39.99 dollar pizza.... Quid.... you already know
Smh you said you wanted to be vegan. Common shane you can do this! Your fans and freelee believe in you!
I have quidd it's  cool it's like a texting app into a game #notsponsered
lmao i was gonna skip the ad but i realized shane could use the money to get out of debt...
I bet that waitress makes bank
Honestly that pizza looks kind of gross… I’m gonna stick to Little Caesars
BOY I CAN FUCKING GET THAT A FUCKING DOMINOS
Honestly queen, I love you so much, but I must say your hair is usually purty lit,  but now, young JB gonna snatched your weave queen...
This was so funny every second was so funny. Thank you for hanging out with Drew on camera again I love you both so much
Is there a love button ?!
And the reason is fooooooooooood\n\nWhat 10 seconds in and I'm already crying with laugher. 😂
Tomato is a fruit though....

MY DOG LOST HIS BALLS RECENTLY TOO!
When he said he likes the spooky conspericys i was screaming spooky scary skeletens😂😅
Jk his friend has a turtle
I actually just downloaded quidd so you don't go broke
Freeze it at 3:18 and you see pieces of food on Shane’s teeth and honestly I’ve never related more
Something edible cost as much as the iPhone x !!?!!!??!!!
Why is it that people who get to do things like this seem to be completely unprepared for the experience and how to behave during it?
6:18 I spit my soup out from laughing
imagine having a thousand dollars to spend on pizza
I LOVE THAT GIRL WITH THE PAGE AND THE DOOR MAN OMGGGGG I CANT SHE IS SO SWEET AND SO ISHE
Who else is watching this after watching one of his scary videos
DUDE SHANE IS SO NICE LIKE HE SHARE IT WITH THE HOSTESS AWWWW
I thought it was going to be so much bigger 😂😂😂😂 I would never 😂 I barley want to pay $8 at papa John's  🤣
Shane:i barely touched it so you could eat it later.  Drew: i actually will
0:02 pause... Me when I go to the dentist and they say open wide! 😂😂😂 and I have like 10 cavities...And they say Never mind close your mouth 😂
Did anybody notice that that turtle in Drew's room is gonna die because it doesn't have something to get out of the water on...?
Firdt you say youre broke and now you use 1000 FUCKING dollars on a P I Z Z A
I got all your stickers shane!
Aw...thats like the nicest thing shane has ever done 😂😂😂😂\n4:04 aw that poor fish

Please tell drew that his turtle doesn't have a basking spot or really anything he needs to live and will probably die so please tell him I hate to see the turtle in only a tank of water
woman crush #1
What if that's just the way Jimmy Fallon laughs? 🤔
The one song I HATE (and deleted) is the next single. 😣
Jimmy you have 2 more year as the host... You're starting to feel fake, like super cringe!
I LOVE HEERERR SO MUCH!!!
Her son isn't the only one crying when he hears her awful songs.
I don't know about anybody else but She is still beautiful. And still married to the man who did the first backflip on a a dirt bike!!!😀
This is some normie shit.
How can you cry on such shitty music she is just like crap
Pink+Eminem
Go 'head, Big Sis. I just love P!nk. I love her personality and her will to not give in to trends.
Their pictures with them all bending the gender lines to push the filthy marxist luciferian hollywood agenda of post-genderism and ambiguity is digusting.
Love her!! This album is underwhelming but she is amazing!!
I like their song together on Recovery. I would have been shocked if Eminem said no to her after she’s been on one of his tracks.
Does she love Eminem after threatening to drop all his fans if they don’t drop Trump.  Thug...
Maybe coz her music has lost its edge? Just kidding but I really do miss the early 2000s
Гуф Умер!
oh  so sweet !
Jimmy loves everything lol
i have't seen a Pink Eminem... nah!
Pink suit to the VMAs is literally LIFE!!!
I'd like to see Pink's bean.  I'd also love to play with her bean.
She's so great, god, I thank the universe for people like her.
I love to hear her lagth, I think I would tickle her for a long time just to hear it.
Fire Starter,.....lol, priceless,....and actually, she does, lol, and that lip synch part, ha, amazeball's!!  Love her, and her new album is amazing :D
Love it!! Check me very fast bass player https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfjY1UtIWmDN4sDXtpt2hIg?sub_confirmation=1
The part where she talks about Revenge and how she was drinking wine and wanted a Rap Grammy and asked Eminem and whatnot-- she gave that interview on the radio here in New York VERBATIM like to the point I was just wondering if they edited out Jimmy and put in Elvis Duran's voice like every little joke she made and EVERYTHING. Until Jimmy interrupted her joking along about the email it was EXACT. Like, I get that they have to tell the same stories over and over and shit when they're doing promo for an album and especially for one specific single BUT usually their answers are slightly different seeing as they're talking to someone different etc... this literally like was weird and made me feel like she's a robot HAHA. Seriously google the interview if it's up and you'll see... so weird. Ver-bay-Tum. Lol\n\n  Incidentally, Revenge is my favorite song rn like I LOVE it hahahaha it's just different and cool and funny. Also I love Eminem so there's that. Two thumbs up. (That song, plus the interview, actually made me DL the entire album and so far I've listened to like half of it and it's great, I highly recommend it).
If you sub to me I will sub to you
Ughhhhh STFU and let her speak
Pals rate Anyone  identify bigger  this case? laxghing
I cry whenever she sings
Pink: Hi\nJimmy: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I think Jimmy has a little crush on Pink and who could blame him!!!   xox great interview
She's an amazing woman!
#get rid of jimmy fallon because he's not funny
I cry when she sings too and at my age I'm nearly deaf.
Time is a heartless bitch to me,,but Missy Pink is holding up really well.   Funny stuff.   Meatball and Firestarter,,Ha!,,,  Kids have a bright future,  so long as their mom has a good heart, which she does.   Good luck Mom!
who cares? this bitch is ugly
P!NK has been around forever, yet I notice she's only recently been really famous, I don't get it.
what a brave transgender pink is. and what an Adonis belt!
Too bad cant afford to see her live
Pink should do next super bowl halftime, cuz she's is awesome!!!
March 1st is my birthday!!!!!!! I will be 18!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU PINK
He cry’s because he hates her voice.
Pink is cool. M&M is a douche-bag.
Me too, she's not very good
I see Eminem in the description I click.
P!NK went to school with my mom in highschool
Pink is ugly,  and her music is bad, and shes stupid.
Shes so genuine and beautiful..good on you ms lady!
have u guys thought of P!nk doing the Superbowl Halftime show?
She’s fucking awesome! \nCan’t wait to see you in New Zealand
why at 0.28 does he always do that fake laugh?
Yo is she the one, Simon said was trash??
Give leading please export potato offer site treatment identical category.
I died when she said Eminem
P!nk and Em? Never even imagined it but now I can't stop wondering!
I love this woman! So excited for the new album and hope she brings her tour to the UK!
I cry when she sings too. Because I miss the old Pink. Now all of her songs are practically all the same.
I was psyched until I heard little Marshall was belching out his stench on her album.
Fallon just doesn't seem to connect with his guests. He's like an over excited kid on Christmas morning. Is that from smoking pot?
What do you see in your mom's hair
Wow, she's really cool 😎
*There have never been a pink m&m*

I would be honoured to have anal sex with PINK.
Jimmy is so sweet!!!
Such a nice Person :)
pinks awesome. Jesus this guy is cringe to watch tho. So fake with his laughter. Are all american talk show hosts this bad?
Jimmy tries too hard to relate with his laughs and comments. Lots of guests just seem to smile and put up with him.
So, I've emailed Marshal...\nThats a different level xD
She is so cool...
She is lovely.
I love pink
pink is not her real  name but she is good i love  her
She’s a legend 👌🏾
I want her to be my Mommy. :D
I thought this was going to be a really sweet story about how her son loves her voice so much he cries when she sings... oops XD
1 minute long ad before the video WHOA
She should be a teacher of celebrity's behaviour.
This lady is such full of shit.... Jesus appears when she sings too
Love me some P!nk. ❤ #Awesome
Ugh I love her dress. Ugh I love her.
That colour suits her
carey is so handsome
YOU'RE fat ! He cries because you're a bad celebrity.
If she didn't look so damn stupid we might actually pay attention to her voice.
I love how even in low light you can see that Nic has really beautiful and well taken care of skin, not just throwing some moisturizer on like most gurus who sctually have awful skin without their 1000 watt, full coverage and filter trickery.
This was a fantastic overview--I was laughing at the sheer volume of products that you managed to slap on but it was great to see them all in action!♥
Great review as always, please can you do NYX thanks xxxx
A video using several Clinique products would be great. I rarely ever see videos with their products included, and I'd love to know which of their non-foundation products are good!
love your take on makeup. told myself I wouldn't watch anymore fenty reviews but had to watch yours because I knew you would have a unique stance
Love you and your videos!! Would love to see you do a Bobbi Brown review xx
Eeeeeeeeeeeek. So jealous jealous jealous. I ,over her products. U look absolutely stunning. I loooooooved the eye makeup.the stick blush kinda thing and  the lip gloss. But all too expensive. But absolutely amazing makeup . Absolutely love u nic. ❤️❤️💕💕💕💋💋💋💋🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Love the lipgloss and the eye colours, however am not a huge fan of the base xx
Would love love love a tarte review
Yes!!! Thank you for being one of the few people who used these products to their full potential. I love that you weren’t limiting the product to one specific use but you used your creativity to use the products the way you wanted. Love this!!
Like that you take the time to play and understand how work the products before you show to us ;)
I have oily skin and this foundation broke me out really badly. I loved the finish and how it wore on my skin but I cannot use it. Does anyone have the same problem with the foundation?
Hi Nic, Thank you for the awesome review. So much hype on this one that it became so confusing... Btw, can I request you for a review of Huda Beauty's new foundation lines? Thanks a lot!
I love that she didn't just gush over Rihanna for being Rihanna. I'd like to try the matchsticks!!
I watched this feeling like I learnt so many new things!
I LOVE the lighting here!! I am so tired of overly bright videos that everyone else does. xx :)
Pray the rosary everyday and quit the vanities of the world, because the world is passing away and the life of the soul is what is everlasting
Nic - I'd love to see reviews on all of the upcoming Holiday collections!!!!
Nic could you do a Fall/Autumn makeup routine video 😙 Love your videos!!
I would love to see a review on Kjaer Weis or RMS Beauty! xx
please review the ordinary serum and coverage foundations!
You girls are beautiful inside & out.
I'm obsessed with this look, stunning make up as always. ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
Hi Nic - I know you ladies tend to review/use more high end brands (not a criticism) but I was wondering if you would review the Primark range. X
To me the foundation matches your skin tho
I got the gloss and it just looks like clear gloss on me. The pretty color...disappears.😢
honoring the men in makeup too! Thanks Nic so much, this means so much to someone like me. much love from Orlando! xoxo
This is my favorite review of this brand!
one of the most adventurous full fenty beauty looks i've seen! i think the glowy, natural-looking look most people create with these products are lovely, but you really used her products in the versatile way that rihanna wanted. and you did it really well!
Jesus Christ, that’s horrible 😂 She looks absolutely fine, but that over the top makeup is just too much. Sorry guys, but is it just me?
Really like the Brand reviews n seeing all the products used
You should do a review on Jeffree Star cosmetics! The brands Vegan I believe and available on Beauty Bay
Her hairline goes way back like the 1980's
The lighting was so much better in this video! :)\n\nAlso great review :) x
Best review of Fenty I've seen! Love the unique ways you used the products.
I have always loved you!!! Been a subscriber to your channel since your PixiCut hair days! But I love more how excited you get when you show in the products that would look great for darker skin. ❤️
I have to be honest, the contour looked very muddy! Maybe it was because of the lighting? Other than that, the cheeks and eyes looked gorgeous
its 2k 17 \ni cant recognize humans any more
Wasn't she menta shake the foundation first
I wanted to comment on how this has been the best review of the Fenty Beauty line, but everybody has already said it. This is why I've trusted Sam and Nic for years now. Their videos are so informative that they have helped me pick which MAC, Estee Lauder, and Clinique foundations would suit my skin type. Moreover, their reviews are so positive, it's always pleasing to watch them.
I wanted to love the foundation but it sank right into my pores with and without a primer. Good thing I only got a sample.
Would love a review on jefree star products. Thanks x
Out of all the Fenty Beauty reviews I have seen... I feel you were the most honest and transparent... but you guys always are.  💟  This was super informative... Thank u.  Well done!!
Love what you did here 🙌🏼❤️❤️ showing the versatile usage really helped me 😊
I think it's great that you did a full face using the highlighters as eyeshadow! Clever!
Love that you used Trophy Wife as an eyeshadow, and not a highlighter like other light skinned girls have done on Youtube.
Love this look so much!! 👌🏼
Would be great if you did an update skin care video. ☺
Any time you like something I just want to run out and buy it haha! I would love to see you review an affordable brand like Sleek or Nyx please, for those of us who need to rely on cheaper products most of the time...
What colour foundation did you go for Nic?
I love the look you did with it. I haven't seen anyone else use the highlighters as eyeshadow or lipstick
I like the way you do makeup - I don't understand contouring the forehead though.  It just looks like everyone has a dirty forehead.  You don't of course.
The foundation made me break out in little red spots (not pimples/active acne, almost like an allergic reaction as opposed to a breakout) but I really liked the way it looks when mixed with a luminous foundation for my dry skin - I used Koh Gen Do Aqua and the two seemed to play nicely together. If anyone's bought the foundation but has dry skin and finds it isn't working but also own a liquidy dewy foundation try mixing the two!
I have really dry skin and the formulas just did not work for me. I got the foundation as soon as it was released because of the color selection. I have a strong yellow undertone that is hard for me to match. The foundation and primer just made my skin look even dryer. I looked like I had more texture then I actually have.
Celebrity make up . I shall pass
Please review Le Mètier de Beautè. I am very curious on your feedback for a high end brand.
Thank you for always including us darker skin girls in your reviews and recommendations.
I'd like to see a tutorial on Pat McGrath's new eyeshadow palettes.
Fantastic review Nic! Always enjoy listening to your honest thoughts and loved the look💗
Looks great nic.  Would love your opinion on Glossier.
I love but please cut down on the Botox your eyebrows didn't move the whole video!
Could you do a nyx review/tutorial.  I have not used there stuff but have heard good things about it. Also I have extremely pale skin with really dark under eyes. What would you do with that as I have never found a concealer good enough? I love your video. I like how real you are. Keep it up.
This is by far the best review of Fenty Beauty that I have seen so far. 👏🏼
I wasn't sure when I saw it at Sephora last week, but now I want absolutely everything in this range! My poor, poor bank account! lol Thanks for the review, Nic!
Thanks for the review Nic, I love how you showed the versatility of the products unlike the rest of the video reviews.
You're 37 ?! Wow, that's goals aha x
Great review,\nCould you review the Claudia Schiffer’s ?\nThx
This video showed me how much lighting & editing make a difference in makeup videos....the line doesnt seem that great without heavy editing?
I would love to see a review of the new Pat McGrath Labs shadows and liners!
aw I love how you have Tanyas  Burr\ns book in the background
Just started watching you! You are lovely x I am 37 also. I really enjoyed this review. I learnt so much thank you 💕
Hi Nic, nice Fenty Beauty review!\nSince you asked, would you please consider reviewing Kjaer Weis products?\nThanks a lot and keep up the good work,\nEve from France
I really like the look of the blotting powder. can it be used as a setting powder?
absolutely love you so much!
Brilliant video. Would love you to review the new Bobbi Brown exclusive to selfridges sparkle palette. X
love
Awesome review
Best review so far
Do you still use Lilash?
I thought you said 'ginger minge' 😂😂
CT please!!
Do NYX!!!!!
Best tutorial of fenty beauty. Thanks Nic
that finishing powder.... wow!
NARS would be great! Please please!
Please review Milani
Love your makeup looks, but could you do more makeup looks on brown eyes please! Your eyes stand out a lot with makeup especially because they're light, it takes effort to choose a natural/ish look for brown eyes. Kim Kardashian does this beautifully at the moment, but I can't seem to create the look or pick the right shades. Would love a video on that. Thank you! <3
Love the lighting
What moisturiser did you use?
37??? you look great!
Your right side looks fantastic!
Please review Dolce & Gabbana makeup! Thank you!
while tension male wbrozx conviction seemingly fish touch start overall.
Omg this makeup is so gorgeous 😍
Great lightning!
I so appreciate the more natural lighting, Nic.  I think many of us feel alienated when we watch videos where the person's skin texture is totally bleached out.  You still look absolutely gorgeous, but you look human.  Beautifully so. X
You knew you’d be applauded for making special mention of men and makeup. Nothing is stopping men from wearing makeup. I came here like most, to relax and watch a makeup tutorial. Instead it’s like everywhere else you turn- politically charged and obsessed with political correctness at every point where it can be mentioned.
Would love to know what you think about the new Nars Luminous weightless foundation and how best to apply it!
lighting is a little bit dark!
Please come up with a new makeup pallet...😚😚😚😚😚
bout to be broke
I’m going to be broke spending every dime on this collection 😭😍
So excited to order today
The only things i can afford are the chokers #brokepeopleproblems 😂
Wait, she's a UK size 2? I can never get my size right for UK clothes lol
Omg everything is beautiful! Including that closet - can we get a tour? :D
Congrats on this beautiful collection girl! Please extend your sizes on more of your pieces.
Congrats babe!😘 Yayyy so happy for u! Love the whole line*💜
I actually love every single piece I can't wait to become completely broke when this line launches !!!!!!!!!!
Ugh wish I could afford every single piece of this collection ! ❤️😩
So excited for this launch!!!
My mind is BLOWN. Carli great minds think alike because I absolutely am obsessing over every single product you bring out and I wish I was filthy rich to just buy everything you bring out multiple times!! You are so original and I love it. If I could make my own clothes they would be exactly like what your bringing out! Keep going harder girl your a revolution 🌷🌷🌷🌷💭💭💭💭👄👄👄💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 #carlibybel #magic
WHERE IS BRETT! MY HEART IS SAD
Watching this literally made me broke!!!! I want everything😩😩😩
ugh i wish i could buy everything!! each piece is so gorgeous
I love it all!!!! I need that second one to drop so we have some embellished pieces for those October birthdays!
Super happy for you. But I won’t be buying as it looks suuuupee tacky. Fashion Nova 2.0
I wish I wasn't so big so I could wear some of this stuff. :(
So much stuff this time omfg. I hope i can get my hands on some stuff
FYI, Carli does not design these. Missguided gives her options to choose from the manufacturer and she puts together the collection. Most of her items are on the website already, either in a different color or style... for example the sock boots and the chain shimmer top, are already on the website, and for a cheaper price.
YAY! Congratulations! This is all Fair Trade Clothing, correct? :D From what I could tell it seemed like it but most Fair Trade companies say it somewhere on the site... I just wanted to make sure before I bought EVERYTHING!!!! :D
Babeeeeeeeeeeeee it looks amaizing... All the way from Venezuela: Lots of love<3
carli I love you girl but the whole collection is so expensive.. didnt think of people who arent rich and cant afford to spend $75 on pants and $50 on a shirt 😂 ill just stick to fashion nova but love your makeup
Oh my god I want everything. I'm about to spend my entire paycheck on these outfits! \nPlease make your next line corporate clothing bc ya girl works in an office & I would love your designs for that environment
can't wait to order some things....you do a great job showing the pieces and the prices!! Thanks❤️
I feel like she was thinking about herself when making these clothes..
I can't help but notice how curvy she suddenly got. She went from very petite to very curvy hips ! Whatever it is she looks fabulous 😍
I would wear each item, this collab is screaming my name
I need to know about the camo pants/jacket that was on the insta
Will you have a tall range? I'm 5 ft 10 and i have trouble buying coords because the trousers/bottoms are never long enough but I absolutely love the collection!!
All of these beautiful outfits for birthdays. What if I sit in my bed and eat cheese doodles on my birthday?
what about the dress you have onnnnn omg
Carli I need a try on video I love the Jean jacket but Iam completely confused on the size I should get 😢🤔
The collection looks really amazing and the 2nd drop looks even more amazing! Can´t wait to see the try on video 💕🙌🏼✨
What time are these dropping tomorrow ?
Does anyone know the time it goes live? 😩😩
well done carli! the collection is insane 😩😍😍
When is the next video with the rest of the collection coming?? Need to know about that sparkly jumpsuit 😍😍😍🔥
People complaining bout the prices are broke ass haters. Y'all know shes high maintenance, tf you expect
I love you & these clothes but girl, those prices are insanly high... A $30 us top costs me double in Canada & shipping is insane too :/
This. Is. Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Literally need all of this in my closet! I really hope I am able to get some pieces even if I have to “go to the bathroom” at work tomorrow hahahah! Need the camo crop top with the sweats and the gold corset 😍😍😍
This is the perfect collection for Kim Kardashian... so not affordable for us normal girls 🙄
I need to get my hands on some of those sweats! the plum color is to die for! Congrats on this collection! Every piece is so beautiful!
That green Khaki dress has a space in my closet already. So happy for you and your successes. Thanks for doing all you can do to make the clothes so affordable. ❤
I WANT ALL OF THEM. OMG They're all so beautiful! ❤️😍😍😍😍
Wasn’t super interested (never watched you before) but you pulled out the most incredible silver top first and you gained a new subscriber and probable buyer (silver is my favourite colour-the best way to win me over) 💚
Congrats carli love the collection and i will def try to support! Dont let anyone take this moment from you!! 😍❤️
Could have done a try on 🙄
I'm really happy for you and I wish I could get something!!
Carliii girl you slay. I will be buying a few pieces like I did for the last collection. You’re the reason I started shopping at missguided in the first place.
Carli is the only YouTuber in the make up and fashion industry that I appreciate and has all of my respect!  Love you Carli 💓 you really are the beauty bybel !!!! 😊
love the nudes, such a cute collection xx

Congrats!!!
This is a beautiful collection, But i have to say those trousers at 8:56 look cheap af
I need that golden mini dress for my birthday! Even if i just stay in my apt. It's so beautiful! 😍
As much as I like you Carli.\nI think these clothes are very last season. \nI already have a lot of these types of clothes from last year/early this year.
Is it just me or 4:15 she looks like Cristen Dominique??
Please do the 2nd reveal asap!!🙏🏼
Wish this was try on, really hard to get true idea of pieces but congrats on the collection.
Can't wait to order so many things!
OMG! this collection is so beautiful! I want to buy every single piece! I love your style and you're such an inspiration. <3
I couldn't wear any of this lol, but it is so beautiful and on trend with the badgal style that's so hot rn. If you don't like it, I don't know why you are here. Go look elsewhere. Amazing work, Carli babe!
What dress is she wearing?
I am so glad you are including plus sized options  :)
Is that an engagement ring I see?! Lol not trying to be nosy but I love you and Brett! Cutest couple and couple goals!♡
Y'all just because you don't see her man doesn't mean that he isn't her man anymore he's got his own career stuff going on too love the collection girl and my birthday is around the corner too 👏🏽👏🏽
I feel like the prices are all over the place and very overpriced. Especially the chokers and some of the tops. The collection is beautiful though and i love the embellished jean jacket.
Hi Carli, I've been following you forever. Im so happy for you and all of your success . Im gonna do my best to get my hands on some of these pieces, your collection is gorgeous.  Im fairly conservative in   my style but a little fairy dust never killed anyone right?! Xx
I'm so proud of Carli! She is so amazingly talented and truly has an eye for fashion so happy to see her come so far ☺️ can't wait to get my hands on her collection !
May be in the second launch you can try them on so we can se how they fit. Btw I'm so happy for you and this pretty collection
Very beautiful collection way to go carli 😲
YASSS gurl can you pleaseeeeeeeeeeee do a lookbook so we can see how all the pieces fit ? So excited  Luv ya k bye

HAPPY BIRTHDAY CARLI I LOVE YOU SO SO SO MUCH ❤❤ have a good day
I absolutely love your style its soo unique and beautiful 😍😍 congrats girl im soo happy for you❤️❤️
When you don't read the title and think it's a Kim Kardashian closet tour...
On a side note, hey is that an engagement ring on Carli's finger?
just came here for a toss
So is this not coming online in the uk? I'm confused
WOW! Love everything!👏🏼😱🎉💞
Congratulations!!
Omg I need those boots 😭😭
Is it me or does she look thicker 😍
Is this a fall collection or summer collection?
Carli, love the clothes but I wish the MAUVE jacket came in a larger size.. just like the matching cargo pants. The plum sweatsuit  is also giving me lyfe.
God, watching this video made me anxious
I’m 18 and my boyfriend was just in a terrible car accident killing his best friend and leaving himself in a coma. I was wondering if you guys could do a video on traumatic brain injuries? More specifically diffuse axonal brain injuries please.
Hey I'm new here so I'm not sure if you've done a video on this but I think it would be really cool if ya'll could do a video on how experiences in childhood affect your life and relationships later on.
I developed anxiety attacks over a long period of time that came to a head many years ago when I had one of several panic attacks.  After dealing with this for over a decade, a new thing happened: agoraphobia.  I now don't leave my apartment unless I absolutely have to.  I no longer grocery shop nor do even go for a casual walk as each of these cause anxiety and panic - and for no known reason at all.  I take an SSRI daily but that doesn't do much except even out my moods so I no longer feel particularly happy or overly sad about anything as a result.  The worst part about this: I'm not alone.  There are so many others in the same situation as I am where our quality of life has been dramatically compromised.  I've lost most of my friends (since I can't visit them nor can I go out with them anymore for fun).  I certainly haven't met anyone that I could share my life with (how could I).  I buy most of my food at a convenience store because it's close by and I can quickly go there, grab something and come home again.  This is my life, or more accurately, my existence.  Anyone that thinks those of us that suffer with this _want_ to be like this are the ones that need to have their head examined.  Often, we are told that we need to pull our socks up, man-up, get over it, etc., or are asked things like What are you afraid of? Do you think people are watching and whispering? What is your problem? and don't understand when they get answers like I don't know what there is to fear: nothing, as far as I know.  This just happens.  No I don't think people are staring and whispering; I'm not paranoid or suffering delusions.  If I knew what my problem was do you not think I'd have addressed it already head on?  Then they wonder why we get upset and don't want to be around them.  To make this problem even worse, none of us experience this the same way.  One person's experience with anxiety and panic could be radically different from my own.  Sadly, we're all treated the same way.  Broken.
i figured i was going to comment along the lines of what a load of bollocks!\nbeing somebody who suffers anxiety for a host of reasons, along with depression, i get a bit sick of the whole change your diet, think positive! type of crap that appears on the net. \nyou didnt do that. \nthankyou!

QUESTION TIME!!! XD\nWhy do I love doing puzzles since I'm terrible at them?\nAlso where did all of the stereotypes about women wanting Make up and cars and hot boys more than gender equality or even common sense?\nIf you answer any of these then I will be the happiest person on earth. Thanks\n-Ozeroo

WHAT THE HELL Man?!?!?!... I've always dealt with anxiety from Childhood but somehow your video makes me feel terrified about my Anxiety now ! Now in addition I'm increasingly afraid of the compound effects for my future and physical health too
My anxiety came back while watching this video.
You should make a video of your brain lean
I hate when people try to discredit my anxiety by saying, “It’s normal! I get super anxious all the time too!” 😐
Talk about how society started using the word triggered all of a sudden...
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
I have severe social anxiety and I can't take it anymore this is too painful I just want to be normal
Sir please make a video on intermittent fasting and its effects on hormones such as testosterone and growth hormone and such for bodybuilding as i have seen many people claim that testosterone levels boost on intermittent fasting. Thank You in advance

I was just asking myself this.

I got anxious watching this video :s

What always amazes me is that I'll have these thoughts tormenting me, and then suddenly they just disappear--poof! My brain is calm.  It is like something pops, and it is over.
I feel like you guys read my mind sometimes and your like, alright he is now Anxious, lets give him some tips.

this video gave me anxiety
can u make a video on   why do we slap people ? i was always curious about that i think it would be a great topic
the hottest fashion trend of 2017
I am so anxious  not to say something wrong in class because it will make everybody laugh... I am the only child in my class to be anxious with all the test and even daily lessons because I feel like I will not have study enough and in this way I would dissapoint my teachers... Once I got a 17 out of 20 in a test and I did not want to go to school for one week because I felt useless and that if somebody sees me, I thought they will laugh at me...
i make A S M R  relaxation videos to help people with anxiety.. hugs hugs to all that have anxiety problems.. I have it badly too   :(
What are those floaty things you see which are transparent and move as you shift your gaze. Is it just me who sees it? Pls make a video explaining that
Thanks Phil!
His voice cracked at 2:05
Really enjoyed this video! so many facts about anxiety
because of my teacher
Some of u people need to stop feeling sorry for yourselves and get on with it lol
We're all gonna die one day :(
i live with panic disorder. much like the chipotle kid...  Omg Anxiety is my life. lol
i felt like crap these couple of days back. Now i feel better. I stopped smoking I think this is from childhood.
I think my anxiety stems from never feeling like I've done good enough so I think about ways I messed up. And if something does go my way I feel like I just injected heroine and I'm a rock star. And then I crash again
I watched this video to try and understand my anxiety. Now I ish understand it but now I'm terrified of it. Fml
Was recently diagnosed with severe reoccurring Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I didn't even think I had anxiety to begin with. My day to day life is a lot better now since treatment.
So thats why white people make me nervous...
I was hoping this would be a fun cartoon, its more of a drawing thang tho...
This video just gave me anxiety
I get anxiety when I'm in line and the cashier gives me coins.
Started meds after 1st and biggest anxiety attack. It stopped the constant anxiety the 1st attack triggered but i didnt want to be on meds my whole life so i weened off it after like 6 months and started probiotics and eating better which helped some but the biggest help so far has been magnesium spray. Ive only been using it a week but its helped a lot. Apparently magnesium deficiency is hard to diagnose in blood work so worth a shot.
does any one know how I could make a video with this similar kind of style? any free programs or tutorials any one knows of?
I honestly wish people treated mental illnesses the same as physical illnesses. Just because it may be invisible doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It can be just as debilitating or worse. \n\n- a girl trying to cope with GAD/MDD

2:02 Dat voice crack
Whos here from Philly D?
Excuse me but your brain picture with the hypothalamus and amygdala is totally wrong. Everyone knows that they're part of the limbic system and that the hypothalamus lies just below the thalamus duh. I feel offended that you would even allow this into your video hmmpf.
Anxiety is  basically just excitement with low self confidence. I don't have any science, but if you think about it it makes perfect sense. I would assume that it's different for people with disorders
Got lost in the comments and then heard them talking about rats and strawberries and was like, what does this have to do with anxiety?!
When you drew the muscle I thought it was an almond.

Without Eriksen Tottenham are nothing trust me. Any striker who plays week in week out will score plenty of goals for that team, maybe not as much as Kane but Eriksen just runs the game.

Black people are so dramatic.
What a fag!
Well, that's just great. You hear that, Ed? Bears.
The opening takes place in the town Crystal Lake. Alice has come back there to face her demons. They mention this in the phone call to her mother. So... Jason walked into town.\n\nThe whole sequence with Adrienne King was improvised. There was no script. She and Steve Miner just made it up on set. She didn't even know she was supposed to die until way late in the game. That's why it's a lot of even more happening... they just put the camera on Adrienne and let her be an actor.

Wheres my penis? Wheres my penis?
Did we not point out the black dude who appears in the beginning a little bit and then disappears and never is killed or acknowledged ( He was one of the counselors and can be seen in the scene where Paul  is explaining everything to the counselors)

#1 Trending
I bet this hurt Trump's fragile ego, especially the fact that this got more views than anything Trump has ever said. lol
What a cringe fest.... Eminem is doing anything to try and stay relevant and showing how he is just like every other power out there jumping on the politics will make me popular again bandwagon. Lol.
All these Dislikes need to get a life
EMINEM IS ON THE VALIUM AGAIN.GEEZ,YOU JUST AIN'T RELEVANT ANYMORE.
If this was about obama people would've called Eminem a racist
I've seen Eminem at so much better, this was kinda bad, cause we all know how great he can be. I don't like to bring in politics to music, I love Green Day and I'm a Trump supporter and they openly don't support the president, which I'm completely fine with they have every right to their own opinion, problem I have with this is that he completely alienated half his audience including me so guess I won't be listening to Eminem any more😪
That's not disrespecting the military lol
this dude was known for being controversial. he certainly left that behind. playing his cards safe these days.
Eminem is the Boss
Why is Shia Le Beouf rapping about Donald Trump?
I like that he went after Trump, but he needs to junk this flow.\n\nHe used it in Campaign Speech and it fell flat there too.
Omg!😱 Why did the greatest rapper ripped of Trump?... Phenomenal
im so sick of rappers trying to take. a stand on things. do they realise all the harm they create through their violent music . they degrade women, talk about shooting anyone who dares disrespect them. and promote all kinds of drugs. they all need to sit down and shut up. stick to what u do best. destroy young minds. especially snoop dog. he is not as great as he think he is. go smoke yr weed and shut up
was that Conway the machine? ILL
BizWIz, educateme professor. Inform me .....oh wait You can't because I don't have my head so far up my ass I require a plexiomety to see where I'm walking. Phhhhshh. Dumb dumbs.....
Omg this was horrible to watch. 🤢
I thought he was not mainstream...\nbut he is turning in an average celebrity. shame
It's not Trump yall should be hating on
Eminem you don't live in the real world, keep your political opinions to yourself
I understand the left's butthurt after election day, however, I didn't expect the butthurt boo hoo to go on this long... lol pathetic
Hey Marshall.  How does that Clinton dick taste in your mouth?
This was Trash coming from Eminem
Wow that sounds really great but we bad because Donald will fire back
Marshall looks like a pedophile
I'm not expecting you to listen but if you do, thankyou i'm just a new artist on the scene trying to build an audience for my music i understand if you see these things all the time and you couldn't care less but you never know it could be different this time and you might actually like what you hear its pure too ❤ \n\nCheck the link below and if you like give me a follow because there's a lot more to come \n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/loverboyleonaitasi
I used to be a huge Eminem fan. But not once did he mention the trans ban on the military. He only focuses on racism. What is Eminem's ideals on the ban of transgenders in the military? If you listen to his older music it would lead you to believe that he is against transgenders and in that sense he agrees with Trump. I believe everyone is equil and anyone has the right to serve this country.
What a shit weak freestyle\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cLslNlzAAtI <---*anyways guys check this out!!!! eminem is now on President Trump side* 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kim jong un does not pee or poop he does not have a butthole
Bruh a beard can make a big difference
Why he look like Jesse from bf vs gf
This ain't meant to be his best.\nIt's meant to be a message.\nYou ain't no real fan.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMINEM..!!!!(The King Of Rap)
PLEASE SUB TO more. Inc BEST CHANNEL EVER
eminen for president the unidad state
Yes trump is orange but Eminem's a lot of other colors\n\n\n\n\nIncluding orange
#ProtectEminem. He is the only one brave enough to speak out, and for that he earns my respect.\nP R O T E C T E M I N E M!
I love u man you’re the best motherfckr you the best @rap god
Slim when a new song nice one with trump bro
I love Eminem but this was disappointing. Politics aside, the rap sucked.
Snowflake in the house.  Go see a Dr. for the cure for Liberalism.
He sounds like he's going to cry.
As inspiring as these lyrics were and this message is, reading the comments was equally uninspiring and disheartening. It's terrifying to know that no matter what Trump does his supporters will still back him. Eminem used his platform as one of the most well known artist ever (not just rappers) to bring to light issues that are incredibly important and need to be talked about. Charlottesville happened, Vegas happened, The terrible response to Puerto Rico happened, Trumps support of the kkk and obvious racism happened...ohhh and that little thing in North Korea is happening right before our very eyes! Yet you still support him, there's so many more terrifying examples of Trumps awful leadership and yet you still support him no matter what. I so desperately wanted to put a question mark at the end of that last statement but at this point I know it to be fact. Maybe that's why Eminem felt it necessary to draw a line in the sand. I will say it's a sad day when any line needs to be drawn in the sand.
This is cringe and whack as shit and this is coming from a former long time fan.
trash...no wonder kids now a days grow up having no respect for authority.  Donald Trump is the President of the United States of America. You may not like or respect the man because of whatever reasons, but you should have respect for the title he holds whether you feel he deserves it or not.
Was he on drugs? He's breathing like he's on speed.
Eminem the bast
barely bussn a sweat & breathing so    HEAVY    Marshall
LOL
J-Roc the microphone assassin
Jea Eminem
Lol this isn't eminem tho😂😂
Fool cant even rap
Truth
Sucks
7 days ago lol
Biggest waste of 5 mins.
Cringiest thing  x 1000
very bad unoriginal MSM brainwashed fool
Im with you Eminem!!!
What a joke
this is utter shit
trump sucks fat dicks

he aint even trynna spit fire he just preaching
Happy birthday Eminem

WACK
I loved it
#eminemfornextpresident
180k trump supporters disliked the video, they chose poorly
Part of the 200 billion raise budget to the military included cutting retirement benefits for soldiers and pensions are practically a joke if you join now that has pass. Yet stupid Mothafuckas still support that garbage. Ain't that something.
Search where the calm before the storm quote originally came from, it's a strong warning.
This guy is cringy af but ya have to give him points for trying, try something better dude, not edgy enough
Washed up.................... LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nOnly car worth a shit there is the old caddy LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bet racist whiteboys who supported Em no matter what now thinks he's not the best anymore. I've heard diehard fans saying all his albums are in the garbage right now.\nIf you were never a fan, Eminem won't miss you. The truth is, you were never a fan, you just hopped on the bandwagon because, it was another opportunity to spread your racist whitesupremacist agenda. There has been way too much black rappers and even latino rappers who has outclassed Em's style but you didn't care, but all of a sudden a Whitman pops up and all of a sudden he's the best. Just like he himself admitted, if Em was black, you wouldn't have shown so much support and and now that he shows he stands for equality, your true agenda just showed up. Racist white supremacist bastards.
yo M...rather than just trying to be part of the propaganda negativity Media train that's fueling more hostility and Division\n\nPositivity United through peace is what should be the mission but just because you have a platform in your famous doesn't mean that people will continue to listen when you ranting and ravin\nstand back take a look Now Understand we all know government of the crooks I'm self-educated and Behind the Walls for years I've read many books but I don't do this for kicks if it looks or for tricks or just for the hell of it to bullshtttt....\nTrying to get your attention and by the way also I meant to mention\n\nAlways Remember that united we stand divided we fall \n\nyo M... if you're down for the good of all... then pls recognize that love is the weapon you're coming with too much hatred you need to get to Steppin \n\nN anything else you're going to Try\n\nFirst start by apologizing to America and correct yourself\n\nor\nya gonna wreck yourself.\n\nlol trudat ... Jus sayin :-)
Awful.\nI choose not to vote.\nI knew Hillary was an evil baby eater witch, and Trump was gonna flex on the world, hard -keep up the MAGA front to the American people, while running proxy wars in the background, just like Obama, Bush, Clinton, Reagan, etc. \nI refuse to have any of their blood on my hands.\nAmerica should have an America First mindset, as should all other countries that want to take better care of their own.\nEverything Eminem is rapping about is pure propaganda mainstream narrative talking points.\nLyrically, this was impressive, but the message, like many Eminem tracks, is awful.
He rapped too long about Trump\nShowing off his retarded fist pump\nNow his car battery needs a jump\nI'll give his punchable face a lump\nBut not before I finish this dump
*YouTube is scrubbing negative comments!* I've seen many disappear. \nThis is bullshit. They've deleted TWO of mine.
crack is one hell of a drug cuz
Eminem is #officially #Black
And when someone with a voice speaks up you guys criticise them like that's what people with power and shit are suppose to do you dumb fucks everyone saying we need to kill this and kill that,  just a bunch of depressed insecure cry babies # death to the white race were all one now
Check out 4:10 best apart to me
I'm guessing he voted for Hillary Clinton.
Also throwing it out there. I like Eminem. I'm not a fan of Trump.\n\nThis was weak shit. No nuance, no fresh or interesting point, no beat, nothing special about it. It just comes off as corny pandering to people who hate him but don't know what to do with their emotions. Eminem's a talented guy, but this shit was just phoned in.
*sips cup of coffee that I don’t have* nothing like watching people throw a huge hissy fit over a freestyle on trump. it’s one thing to comment how this is a dodgy move but to hate Eminem entirely for one thing he did just proves that you’re no better
What a pathetic butthurt snowflake loser, i can't believe i used to like a couple of his songs back in the day
This fool dont know what hes taking about
This sad shit feels like a new he will not divides us shia labeouf bullshit\nVery bad eminem veeeery bad ....
This is pure cringe...the worst wannabe hasbeen rap I've ever heard....even Eminem doesn't know he himself is washed up, just fade out...loser
Trumps obviously got balls though.\n\nAlso in regards to trumps racism and history off not employing black people, this shows to me that a few hundred years ago, trump would not of been the type of who would of wanted Africans kidnapped into slavery.\n\nEminem, the enemy is not the diplomatically racist trump. It's the white people above and below you who preach liberalism and diversity yet practice division and racial profiling.\n\nAlso Eminem, some types of the black lads that your defending are the type that rob, prey on and detest white people. They pimp girls, hate white girls and I could on.\n\nIt's about time someone in power spoke out and stopped beating around the bush.
Wow Damn Fire! 🔥🔥
Finally.been waiting for this a long time.eminem may be the most inteligent american alive.respect man.
Trump Sucks
Oh and what better way to fight racism by insulting a person because the color of their skin?
I think the drugs are finally catching up with you.
Piece of shit
I'm not sure I've ever commented on a YT vid before (even though I've been watching you for hundreds of years now) ...I just felt totally compelled to tell you that you look absolutely especially stunning here, just such a babe! X
Do you ever shop in Pull & Bear? I just imagine a lot of the stuff being things you'd wear!
I LOVE your makeup! Minimal face makeup and eyes and a bolder lip. Very different than a lot of looks that you rock, but it's perfect and I want to try it!
was gutted when you didn't try the urban outfitters dress on :(
Helen you look stunning in white! 😊
That pink jacket screams Dolores Umbridge 😂 but I love it
Those shoooeees!!!!! 😍  And I love the toned down makeup look!
I can’t find a good pair of jeans anywhere!! I’ve tired topshop Jamie jeans (last 6 months) tried new look (sizing is so bad), asos again sizing issues (always falling down) superdry jeans (too pricey & fake pockets) so any suggestions I’m open too XD.  #help!!!
Loving the simpler make up on you ..so pretty
I've just found you through Megan and I'm SO CHUFFED! You're wonderful! New fan :)
Why didn't she try on the dress?  I wanted to see it :(

Can you consider signing up and selling on Depop please!? LOVE most pieces you wear.
You are literally the girl in me before you. You look and sound the exact same
I dont want to say that i like you way more without much eye makeup or in general makeup, but you LOOK SO GOOD and fresh without heavy makeup! It looks so natural and ..just great! :)
Crazy I never noticed your eye colour before! Must be your makeup today -  😍
You look AMAZING in everything 😍😍😍
That white jumper from Zara looks\namazing on you! Reminds me of Christmas!!!
LOVING LOVING LOVING you in minimal makeup you look so fresh and Parisian!

Omg you look so pretty with minimal makeup!!!! ❤
You are so beautiful Helen x
Loveing the makeup! You have beautifull skin and don't need foundation :D
I love the way you manage to make everyday or more casual outfits look really interesting and glam. You have the best style :)
everything about you is perffffff xx
You are so beautiful. Your lashes are just INCREDIBLE.
Just wanna say how much I love your videos and the effort you put into each of them. Got a little bummed when I didn’t seen “try on” in the title, but alas! You tried things on (I hate when hauls aren’t try ons, you don’t know what things look like!) You never disappoint.
OMG, babez, you look so cute today! What is that lipstick you're wearing in the try ons? It looks so beautiful on you! Pls let me know! xx
Always find it weird  I see stuff I already own in hauls
ahhhh I’m trying to save money😩😩😩😩😩
Where's the jumper ur wearing from? It's amazing
This could've potentially been a very expensive video for me to watch, if I didn't have to shop in the girls/teen section of every store! 😂😂😂
That top at the end went with everything you put on! Love it 😍
Actually loving the lighter makeup on you, looks so fresh! And that white jumper from Zara wowza! XX
@Helen if you want to revive your old face jeans you can buy some dylon dye that you put in the washer, worked a dream for me! hope this helps!!<3
i looove the lace up kinda jeans so much!!
As soon as you said that you’ll love this jumper I knew which one it was before it came up, saw it the other day and fell in love 😍😍😍
On the white boots, the right foot has a stud missing.. unsure if you noticed?! 💗💗
I love the fluffy sleeves from Zara - such a statement piece :) xx
I bought a mustard jumper just like that yesterday but in Primark, fucking LOVE it!! So warm and incredibly soft 😍 \nLove, love, love your sense of style! 💞 xx
The v neck on the rusty/mustardy jumper looked really flattering on you, Helen! Really lovely. Love your hauls :) x
Your pink coat YES I'M IN LOVE
You didn't show us you in the yellow dress!!
I absolutely love how mustard colored clothes look with your purple hair 😍
Love love love that you have your own style and that you aren't like all the other you tubers that are carbon copy's of each other. So refreshing 💕💕
Those bright pink trousers look so good on you! I'm loving everything you've gotten in this haul 😊 x
The slight rumbling makes me think of paranormal activity when the bass comes up when crazy shit is about to happen
They do the coat in grey as well - bought it a few weeks ago it's amazing!!
You look so lovely and fresh without lots of eye make up!
You look AMAZING in the cutaways!! I don't know if it's your make up or weight loss but your face just looks incredible, and obvs just love this video because what's not to love 🤙
Hel you look so cute and fresh faced in the cutaways where you’re trying the stuff on!
Love your style Helen- so fun which is what fashion should be !
looking so cute with this make up 😍😍 great video Helen 😊❤❤
On the white boots there is a big stud missing ( right side of the screen)
Helen, how do you like the UO top? I've been eyeing it forever and am on the fence about buying it because I'm plus size so I don't know how well it'd fit me.
Do a video with all your favourite new looks!
The fact that I can kinda hear the music but not really is making me crazy
I love this makeup!!!! Like the minimal eye and brighter cheek makes you look like a beautiful doll!!!! Love u <3
You just ooze beauty and are so stunning ☺️ I genuinely dig your whole aesthetic ❤️❤️
I love white boots! I have a pair of white platform ankle boots with a three inch heel, the entire thing made me five inches taller! I wore them to death though and I think they only have about two wears left before they really fall apart!
I was watching this intro thinking what have u done different your makeup looks so good and fresh!! Then u said u had hearsay any on 😱 man I wish I looked fresh with no makeup lol
Can we just talk about how everything fits her perfectly?
Miss Helen I think you need some Freddie's of Pinewood in your life and Vivian of Halloway
Really digging the minimal makeup and that you can see some of your beautiful freckles more! Love the vid as always Helen!
That's a Helen coat 🍉💜 Love the whole haul. Xoxo

I love your style! ❤❤❤
Loved this? Where’s the cute blue tie up top from? xoxo
I am seriously considering a full on genderbending dragqueen lifestyle when I see half the clothes you buy and wear. Like that floral mustard dress, good lord, I'd be living my Janis Joplin at Woodstock-dream 24/7!

this old cunt is going to kill me.
WENGER IN
fuck this guy
Lol Donkey! Please stay at Arsenal forever. Laughing stock of the league.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
First... fuck Wenger
Xhaka was terrible playing out of position ..giving ball away ..why not play wilshere  instead ? Arsene clearly lost it ..
Scandalous decision! Bit like offering you another 2 years then Mr Wenger!
Full of shit. Whining about decisions ... did he see the pen West Brom were denied in the last game? That was what u call a scandalous decision. \n\nArsenal bottled it, deeney came on and it was almost constant Watford bombardment... they hit the post n had other chances too. Deserved win in the end for Watford
Jesus christ just go, every decison you make is a WTFFFFFARE YOUDOING!@#@@#@ decision.
Welbeck just back from injury ..why play him instead of Giroud ?
Not a penalty terrible decision!!
Wenger in
Look aaahhh
WENGER-IN
hmm scandalous decision? We did score twice... and they didn't. Silly Mr Wenger your team is slapdash at best.
All said at exactly 0:10...
Europa League club. Facts. \n\nFeel bad for Wenger. \n\nWas it raining? Ty definitely gonna muster something banterful at another Watford defeat.
i cant listen to him anymore
This man face is horror film scene, worse than hell fire.. fuck off here
Wenger in! Fuck your you modern day football fabs
pack youre bags and fuck off!
Stop the rot, you are the rot. LEAVE!
poor man. players are shit! Ozil is overrated. Sanchez thinks he is messi.
Specialist in failure
Carlos anceloti is still available
Hahhahahahahahahahahahaha
Bahahahaha! xD
Donkey!!!!!
🤣🤣🤣
Please please sack wenger. He is clueless. Past his time(15years ago in fact). Im a gooner and glad we lost. We need change and we need it quick
Excuse after excuse after excuse MAN THE FUCK UP give us the answers we deserve to here we deserved to lose penalty or not
Is this the squad to compete for major honors.....? I don't think so
arsene wenger is too old for this.
*Specialist in failure.*
Wenger Out !!!!!
Spineless...coward
FRAUD
piss off
I bet Trump will tweet that rap thinking it is in support of him.
white guy thinks he's black.\nSoon he will think he's a lady.
Mackle is a bitch....Eminem is a Warrior you idiot
I bet that trump diss got Stephen Colbert’s knickers wet
this is #40 on trending and i am so glad
yeah macklemore who has 90+million facebook followers mfs......
You know your terrible when even Rappers feel comfortable mocking you
out of touch middle class, funny
Aw man, I was expecting them to honk more and Eminem would tell them Fuck You! What a missed opportunity
Eminem being used by Hollywood to distract people from being disgraced by Harvey Weinstein.
All of these idiots saying Trump is unqualified because he hosted the apprentice and now they want an ex-addict washed-up rapper just because he agrees with them...has all logic been lost?
so now that em bashed Trump, the faggot left is cool with that. Back in the day I remember when Eminem ripped on homosexuals and was against exactly what's he's doing today. you cockroaches will never succeed in life and even after death. the joke is on you useless fucks.
will the real macklemore please stand up please stand up
eminem broke? (((they))) are getting desperate...
Why are those Black gentlemen just staying there? DEAD! 😂😂😂😂
When did Slim become parody of himself!! Edgy stuff LOL
Watch Trump tweet  loser eminem is failing and he has low ratings.
Im really glad that guy is working for Colbert. He was one of my favorites on Conan
Who's Macklemore? Never heard of him.
I have no clue what I just watched.
I wanted the horn beep to be timed to censor some of the lines with cussing in them, that would've been fantastic. You missed your one shot, and that opportunity comes once in a lifetime
That's no Macklemore, that Vanilla Ice obviously! The nerve of some people...
True, Em is eerily quiet on Trump compared to Bush.
Come on now, that ain't Mackelmore... that's Dan Smith from BYU.
i get that it was scripted but what the fuck was this??
Subsribe me i will subscribe i back
Woah, woah, woah.... Slim shady, take a rest, old man. Catch your breath before you keel

Funniest thing on Late Show in a while
This is more entertaining than the real video
Americans are good people. They have no aggressions against us and they like us as we like them. They must know I don't hate them. I love them. I hear it is a complex society inside. Many Americans don't know about the outside world. The majority have no concern and no information about other people. They could not even find Africa on a map. I think Americans are good, but America will be taken over and destroyed from the inside by the Zionist lobby. The Americans do not see this. They are getting decadent. Zionists will use this to destroy them.\n\nAmericans are good people. They have no aggressions against us and they like us as we like them. They must know I don't hate them. I love them.

Awww so disappointed they didn’t honk whenever he cursed and make it look like they were in the actual video and the reason for the beeps

Is this all YouTube is now, just a lefty, liberal diseased platform?\nThis crap and pointless women, make up video's. \nPlease to all libtards and lefty freaks; paper cut your eye's open ffs.
This new trendin' genre spoken word with a pre-recorded base that's harassin' us since the '90s is gone too far! Now it's even without pre-recorded base, it's just spoken word!
Sometimes I feel bad for Macklemore cause noone says his name right
I don’t know if I’ve enjoyed a literal minute more in the last year. Solid gold
Eminem thinking he's black.
I have deleted scenes on my channel too :D
People find this funny?

This is stupid...
Lmao
Kkkkkk
Em is whack
Run him over......

What about the scene where Eminem was still relevant? Or right that was 15 years ago.
Eminem is cringe !! 😂
My comment was NOT edited
I was waiting for Stephen's reaction to this 😂
Eminem is cringe, he was best staying in hiding.
It's just not funny tho is it
My apologies for the long post... had to get a few things off my chest.\n\nStill can't understand (for the life of me) how/why Black folks are quick to take knees; whine about Republicans/Conservatives/Trump/Police; how poorly (they think/feel) 'The White Man' is/has been treating them (while begging for their attention) and White Supremacy but quickly OVERLOOK ALL of THAT whenever they get the attention they CRAVE/BEG for from White People. \n\nThese fickle Black folks will show love to ANY/EVERYONE who panders to their feeble 'struggle/opression' Group Hive think and will IMMEDIATELY vilify/try to destroy anyone (other Black folks included) who break away from that fatuous mentality and/or chooses to think for themselves... Damn shame.\n\nOne last thing... These athletes/celebrities who constantly whine about the POTUS are weak. Whenever they're given an opportunity to meet him face-to-face to address their concerns, they act like BRATS, refuse to meet with him (runaway) and choose (INSTEAD) to name-call/disrespect him on social media. ALL because it's cool and will get them clicks; likes; retweets; reposts; followers and attention. They're NOT role models/revolutionaries/leaders, they're 'Hive Think' FOLLOWERS and COWARDS.\n\nThey're not looking for solutions to problems, they're looking to stay in the good graces of their 'Group Think' peers and fans. All they do is WHINE about 'stuff' (built upon emotions) but FAIL to BRING LOGICAL SOLUTIONS to ANY of it. \n\nKneeling about 'stuff' (WITHOUT ACTUAL LOGICAL SOLUTIONS) DOES NOT bring about solutions it just brings about attention to kneeling.\n\nHow about we focus on teaching our children to become doctors; lawyers; scientists; engineers; teachers; public officials; police officers; fire fighters; politicians; business owners; entrepreneurs and the like INSTEAD of Entertainers (i.e. Rappers; Actors; Athletes and the like)?\n\nHow about we teach and show the IMPORTANCE of education, ownership and growing LEGALIZED wealth in order to better one's self, family and/or community?\n\nHow about we WORK to improve our neighborhoods? How about we demonize/vilify the drug dealers, gang members and people (INSIDE) who are ACTIVELY/CONSTANTLY/DELIBERATELY DESTROYING our communities? How about we WORK/FIGHT to remove THEM?\n\nNAW... Let's keep kneeling and blaming EVERYONE ELSE INSTEAD. YEAH, that makes MORE sense; that's the solution.\n\n'Butthurt' Group/Hive Think individuals... Feel free to childishly insult me with You Bitch Ass Nigga; House Nigga; FuckBoy; Race Traitor; Coon; Token; Troll; Black Impersonator; White Boy; Agent and/or whatever insult I forgot in 3... 2... 1...
He sounds right cunt on this
What car company is *LS SC?*\n\n\n                 ⬇\n\n\n\n\n\n*Late Show* with *Stephen Colbert*
BRUH! This freestyle have Trump supporters, you knowcloset racist so mad. They calling him everything but a child of god. That goes to show you like Trump said QOUTE: I can shoot a man in broad daylight and not lose 1 supporter might even gain a few. Trump called men expressing there rights sons of bitches but has yet to condemn the Las Vegas mass murderer if PEOPLE TRUMP supporters is the problem they will not call Trump out on one of his lies! That my people is SCARY ASF? He even lost the VOTE but all you hear is he won? That's like the Patriots winning the Super Bowl but lose cause the NFL P.A. said no we're giving it to the Browns JUST CAUSE. This my folks is why we should not vote next election everyone in America cause obviously they gone pick the candidate who will distract the American's the most why they do there dirty work.
Embarrassing just totally embarrassing. \nNo flow, time to retire Em. I loved ya back in the day. But it's time to hang it up man.
that bitch in the car is ugly as fuck!
was this supposed to be funny? you failed
The wigger queer looks like he's got Aids
Has Eminem dissed Weinstein?
One migrant offspring moron bigot dissing another migrant offspring moron bigot
That was lame af lol
Eminem is worth 10 Macklemores. Just saying 😝
racism at its finest liltle jewish cunts
what a role model. eminem is trash.
How is this comedy this isn't funny at all
😂😂get a proper job😂😂
this is the most unfunny thing I've ever seen
Urgh, how is this show still on tv...? It's fucking propaganda bullshit... Same with Fallon, Kimmel - all that shit.
I am personally offended by this
Excuse me!
fucking wank stains
I love Star wars
Now no doubt this will causes some opinions and before is start I would like to say I don't dislike the people I just dislike what they do but that's there choice I don't have the right to judge. \n\nMy comment is.. is anyone else hoping they don't put a homosexual in this film. Reason I'm asking is I just watched the new ep star trek discovery last night and once again we are forced a homosexual even tho the story didn't need or benefit from there being one. There seams to be this trend at the moment where a person of that sexuality is shown off as a amazing person who we should all love even tho it's takes away from the story think back to the last star trek film what dose everyone remember from that film bet it wasn't the story I can't even remember the name of it all I remember is the fact that zulu is a homosexual and that because it was forced even the original actor of zulu said it was too forced. When you do that it takes the whole focus of the movie off the story and on to them. \n\nNow this is far from being star wars but downtown Abbey did it best that show had the butler who was a homosexual but it wasn't forced in your face he was just a part of the story and he wasn't shown off as this amazing person infact he was the villain of a number of episodes so if your gonna add someone like that in do it so the people who don't care can still enjoy the story without it being forced in your face. \n\nPersonally I would like it of they just stopped adding them in to movies or storys not becuse I dislike them but because it takes away from the story.\n\nIn ten years we should look back on this star wars as having a great story we should not look back in 10 years as this being the first star wars with a homosexual that's not what star wars was about.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is if you wanna have a homosexual in a story add them on the first ep or first movie don't add them half way through just for the sake of it. Star trek was about the crew saving the galaxy exploring the galaxy and getting in to trouble it was never about who likes who but that's what it's like today. Star was has always been about good battling evil and that how it should stay. \n\nIn a nutshell don't add them just for publicity or just for the sake of it if your gonna add them do it so it dosnt come across as being this big part of the story.\n Now please don't send hate all I wanna know is dose anyone else feel the same or is it just me. I will delete this comment if it gets to much attention. And I don't dislike homosexual people I just don't agree with what they do but what they do is there choice and I'm not judging because it's not my place
I know this is going to lead to a lot of hate but I really don't care
THE JEDI ARE TERRORISTS! The first order is crucial to peace among the galaxy
Hi me and my friends made this channel two days ago would you make our day and give us a subscribe thanks have an amazing day
They're both gonna go grey aren't they? Only, Kylo with a touch of more evil and Rey with a touch of more good.
if you leave now, an agent of darkness you will become\n\nprophecy fulfilled.
What about the droid attack on the Wookies?
When kilo ren place his hand out to ray
The Porg look so cute but then you here the sound
Bruh still sad that Han died man.\n\nAlso I'm not really into Star Wars but am still crazy hype for this
I hope Rey doesn't lose her hand like Luke did.
I literly felt light headed when I watched this the first time
Please let it be the last one! This franchise is the old Fast And Furious.
I'm ready, bring it on!
I hope this won't be a copy of the original like, what it did to force awakens. But other wise I'm excited for this movie :)
fulfill your destiny......wait,I know that line!!!
im shocked and ashamed they are still allowed to call this star wars
What do you guys think will Rey join Kylo Ren or will it be the other way around.
Smoke is talking to Luke, when I found you referring to when he discovered the location of his new academy. I saw raw untamed power referring to all his students..or just Kylo,  something truly special when he saw beyond and discovered Rey there. She was a trainee there with Kylo and Luke and the others. Calling it now
Well, it doesn't look like a copy.
Love it the trailer is awesome and explains the movie a lot
DID YOU SEE THAT THING NEXT TO CHEWBACCA?!?!? THEY DIDNT LEARN FROM JARJAR
What if Snoke is talking to the Lightsaber in the beginning. When I found you.. Raw, untapped potential... I saw something special... BOOM Rey *holding* THE Lightsaber
I found Kylo Ren more interesting before he took off his mask.
Spoiler Alert:  It's a scene by scene copy of the Empire Strikes Back. LOL!
Rey will NOT TURN INTO THE DARK SIDE!!!!!!! BEN WILL TURN LIGHT
The last bit is just a misdirection, like how TFA's first TV trailer made everyone think Finn was the hero and was going to become the Jedi and such with its ending.\n\nAlso, if you notice, Ben's face doesn't have any scarring in that scene like it does in the present, so it's most likely from Luke's memory or something.
Oh. The moaning kid is back.
Remember in Ray visioning the past, present and the future. Visualizing Kylo killing the Jedi in the rain. Where and who are the surrounding Knights of Ren?? Remember a bunch of dark knights around Kylo?? Where are they?!?
I will cry in the theatre haha
This should be a good movie
Looks great but Star Trek is still better.
I'm ok with the jedi being a girl. I'm sure everyone is. What I'm not ok with is girls being allowed to be boy scouts.
Imagine if at the end of Episode 9 Rey is bad and Kylo the good guy :O
Let the past die ( The Phantom Menace ) . Kill it.
Did you ever hear The Tragedy Of Darth Plagueis The wise?\n\nI thought not. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create...life. He had such a knowledge of the Dark Side, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from dying. The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilites some consider to be unnatHe became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power...which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death...but not himself.
Rey is going to kill kylo. When Kylo says I need someone to show me my place, he kills Han. When Rey says it, she will kill Kylo.
Rey won't join Kylo she will cut off his right hand and he will become darth Vader.
hope they get it right this time and give us a story some where close to empire strikes back.
should I watch it? is it spoiler?
I know it's unlikely, but what if Rey would actually join Kylo Ren, we could see those badass Luke scenes we were hoping for, a 2v1.\nRevenge of the Sith was a great movie, if The Last Jedi's Rey follows the same path Anakin would, I'd guess a Vader/Anakin force ghost would tell her the mistakes she's making, that would be completely badass.
Now I really want to watch it... but  we may not be able to... Cuz of money...
Hopefully they all die in the end so we don't have to endure this anymore.  They can all crawl inside another deathstar and have it 'splodey 'splode
Can’t wait for the new han solo movie movie after this
This Is Going To Be The Longest 2 Months Of My Life😩
I am not such a thing. I am Ancallius, King of Serania.
That bird thing is tho :3
As long as they don’t kill off Poe I’ll be good because I love him
Let the past die kill it, if you have to it's the only way to become what you were meant to be. Kylo Ren
the empire strikes back 2
Does Rey remember what happened to Han when Kylo did that!? Like what are you doing!?
Listen to my story, this may be our last chance.
why are the people who are complaining even here
Did anyone believe that Kyle is coming to the light side? Because I think that is to big of a event to be in a trailer and they just edited it to make it look like it.
Why do trailers always spoil the movie?
Luke refuses to train Rey who goes to the dark side. She leads smoke kilo and all the sith to him who defeats them all. After almost losing to smoke Rey saves Luke who kills smoke. Luke takes the force from Rey and finally succumbed to his wounds. The last Jedi.
but this only the second teaser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Already preordered tickets the day after it comes out
Red Letter Media! I can't wait for their review to come out! I am so excited!!!!  I am going to watch every Star Wars related video they've put out!!!!
looks like its gonna taking over titanic box office
PLEASE SUB TO more. Inc BEST CHANNEL EVER
film is the best..
Who will also sit in the cinema at release?
Rey and Ben will both turn.
Leia is going to get killed by Hux
WOW A NEW JEDI AGAIN :D
Rey better turn with kylo which would be FREAKING AMAZING! If this doesn't happen I'll keep reading the fantastic star wars comics and books, watch the kenobi spin off but not Ep 9. Also WHERE ARE THE FORCE GHOSTS!
I love Star Wars my family love star was
I dont know why so much people say that kylo is a bad villian (probably they are shocked because is the first antagonist in star wars that dont have the face horrible and burned)\nI dont know what do you think but for me is a very very good villian (not yet better than darth vader obviously) and i loved his voice.
I LOVE the PORG!!!!! That little creature is beautiful!!!
ITS RAWWWWWWWWWW
Omg
Semst
Sračka
Impressive....most impressive
How lame...
Kylo's Scar is Fake
The finale

I thought leia died?
Way too excited
10000$ says laya dies
I absolutely love Andy Serkis’ voice.
All dislikers are stormtroopers
No joke I cried
I cant wait!!
Raw, untamed power!
2017 star wars dies of political correctness. RIP
Meh, all I see is incoming disappointment.
Just give John Williams the Oscar now
One thing to notice, that I really didn't know until I saw this trailer:  When we last see Luke in Return of the Jedi, he had an artificial hand, yes, but under a glove, and he seems to handle it well.  He got the artificial hand after fighting Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back and getting his right hand cut off.  In this trailer, he has a robotic hand.  Where and why did he get the robotic hand?
*Cough Cough Cough* Disney give me a cameo in this movie! *Cough Cough Cough*
hmm spark of thought. wasnt r2d2 held in his low power state by the resistance for years and years? if we see him and luke witness the temple/building burn could that have been like 10 years before rey finds him?
So um... The Last Jedi... The last movie too? I mean we all know that its typically trilogies but the red text is Spoopy. Gives suspicion. Just doesnt seem like they would do that and break the Triple Trilogy chance they have. Better buy tickets quick!! :/
Palpatine : Now fulfill your destiny! ( The Return of the Jedi )\n\nSnoke : Now fulfill your destiny! ( The Last Jedi )\n\nCONSPIRACY THEORY!!!!

Instant Happiness check list. \n1. Walk off the Earth\n2. \n3.  etc....
You've come quite a long way from your cover of The Backin' Up Song, eh? I've listened to this about 15 times in a row now. I can't get enough of the awesomeness. Thank you for doing what you do!!
I watch Walk off the Earth videos all day lately because I'm in the mental hospital currently. Yay for WOTE for making my stay at the hospital more enjoyable! 😊

Well the film will be rehashed shit but at least we got this out of it.
Meh . I didn’t hate it but I didn’t love it either . It’s just meh
I feel that if done correctly, you can make a genuine horror movie that will make you scream and jump, but with music just like this. I envision that around 2:00 is when we know that Michael is near but we, just as the main character, do not know where, until the second the music hits 2:09 and she sees him and screams but you hear nothing but the song, before she continues to scream and run.
Finally something I can fall asleep too
Who would be the ideal director for the next one?\n\nMy votes either Darren Aronofsky or Nicolas Winding Refn
This Halloween Michael Myers is coming home Laurie Strode is coming home for the very last time to finally  kill Michael Myers once and for all can't wait to see the new Halloween 2018 can't wait
Master of the ambient background noise
Nothing like perfection! Anything Trent touched is a masterpiece....especially when they work together. Fucking love this! Reznor and Atticus forever!🖤🖤🖤🖤
Trent Reznor came thru with the jams this Halloween 🎃
🖖 I'm slowly peeking with one eye.
Amazing additions to a classic! Love it.
350 people do not know genius when they hear it.
20+ years later and that  parts that starts at 2:10 still makes me shiver. Love it!
It's $ P 00 K Y  S E A S O N
Nothing beats the original
With Trent and Atticus, of course it's brilliant.... ❤👌
So will there be a laurie's theme too? It's my favorite.
The ending part is dope! Should be longer.
I expected more, but this is good.
now this is scary! Love it.
I don't understand why the Halloween theme needs a techno version. But whatever.
I've been a fan of nine inch nails, have to say this is fuckin awesome!
The blackest eyes, the devil's eyes...
Is this is going to be in the upcoming sequel? I heard that a new Halloween project is coming next year so I'm expecting greater things.
What a shit show. This isn't even as good and powerful as the original theme and it's a nutless rendition that's bordering on elevator music. Hard fail, for fanboys only.
I KNEW when I saw Trent's name on it, it would be freaking amazing!!!
I heard good things. Will post my reaction after I watch
The most remarkable thing they captured was the dissonance of the original score.  I'm sure the low budget and technology at the time prevented Carpenter from editing the music properly, which created flawed, out of pitch notes which, coincidentally enough, added to the sense of unease that the movie imbued within the viewer.  To capture that essence of imperfection shows how much love and dedication they put into this rendition.
Ehhhhhhhhhh......... These guys ripped off that Lincoln Park song!
Did anyone else have sort of an ear shutter in the last few seconds? For me it seems to happen when music gets so chaotic, and then suddenly calm. It's so strange that music can trigger something physiological and involuntary.
How the fuck do they do THIS?!!
This must be what it's like inside Michael's head😶
wasn't sure at first but i dig
I need this on vinyl..Maxi 12 or 7
Halloween The Game: Sega Genesis
Secret Chiefs 3 does a fantastic rock version of this.
This is  as good as the outcast themes
I wonder what Profondo Rosso (the original) would sound like?
So much better than the original. The original was ok but this proves that adding a whole bunch of stuff could improve it. I like Halloween. Hopefully they'll remake the original movie and just add stuff to make it better. I like stuff that makes old stuff better.
Is this official for the new one ??
Not as good as the original :/ i don't see why so many people like this version better.
Was enjoying it till all that noise interrupted the mood, i'll have me some 78 please..
At 6:31 I can imagine Michael running to get his victim
Where you at John 5?
I can only imagine what Reznor and Ross could do with The Shape Stalks
I think i just came...
That hard shit at the end !
Fuggin awesome!! If you like this check this out https://youtu.be/5_9uBaRJ2eA\nA full thematic journey into darkness
This song is for the new film? I love it. Very creepy and oldfashioned. Cool final.
:49 to get to the start of the song #YoureWelcome
Thought I was playing METROID for a minute, there.
When does it start?
Fuuuuuuu... I wish i could hit Like more than just once
Halloween still works because the story is simple.  Michael Myers was a psychopath since birth and we don't know why.  One night he escapes and walks among us in suburbia picking us off one by one.  Simple yet brilliant.  Done by the right talent and filmmakers it can be and could always work.
Meh. \n\nI wanted to like this, but meh.
There's a real David Lynch vibe in the sound mixing!
Pretty much what I expected. In a good way.
I just gotta say, all the nay-sayers and haters simply just don't fathom Trent's genius music. I feel sorry for them. But not too much, I'm too busy listening to this epic fucking song right here 😁🙌🏻
Don't fuck with originals.
Excellent rendition!! Truly captures the dread people get when Michael shows up.
Good.. pretty, pretty, pretty good. but.. Disasterpeace and the It Follows soundtrack, which was clearly influenced by the original Halloween theme a lot.. that's pretty damn awesome.
I guess you could say he nine inch nailed it.
Grammy! Love it. Like a grammy means anything anymore.
Is this for the 2018 film?
FUCK ME UP BITCH MY WIG IS ALL THE WAY IN HADDONFIELD
Anyone know if this will be in the next movie?
That bed sheet Michael would make an awesome wallpaper!
Sorry, but all I hear is a bunch of white noise with the vague sound of Carpenter's theme within it. Too bombastic.
this is super Impressive it makes me wonder what Trent version of a Halloween remake would be since Rob Zombie is such a white trash hack and damaged Halloween to the point of no return....... 
*gay*

21 can change the world (Africa, Namibia)
Damn cops need to stop shooting everybody white or black
Gone from bank account which is straight fire to such a deep but it’s still fire
Hi I like your channel how about I sub to you and you sub to me answer if interested
good way of speaking up for black live 21, Dis deep and one of yo best songs
What’s amber rose feeding 21 ? he looks like he’s putting on abit of weight.
Sad part is it’s a guy named 21 savage singing about this . Not much of a role model
The law enforcement or government doesent treat ANYONE like slaves since equality and so on. Whoever got themselves into that cage aka jail, is not due to their race, but their fucking actions, which is crimes
despite the fact i am white, this is an extremely powerful message for the black community. Us crackers are fucked up
Mamma own that diet food , I´m like NANNU .. XD
All these guys saying ohhhh black lives matter nigga stfu all lives matter racism spans over to EVERYBODY stop feeling sorry for yourselves for making dumb mistakes and clean up your act and stop playing the victim card
Subscribe to wolfietitan117 m for gta livestream every night 😂🔥😅 thnx
This song so true and kinda sad
savage don't just make murder music
slaughter gang presents a fair and unbiased approached to slaughter
Anyone else see that kid as a young ty dolla😂
This is somethin new
Damn 21 is getting good I can understand what he's saying and his rimes are good hopefully he keeps it up
This need to get 5b view for people to get this 😭
I liked him before but I got a whole new respect for him
Best song from the album imo. Top 3 are\n\n1. Nothing New\n2. Bank Account\n3. Numb
Real fans have already heard this song (album)
Why all the auto tune tho 😩 great song doesn’t even need the auto tune the message alone is enough
This is real shit
21 savage has a soft side??
Listen to No Heart and you'll realize how much of a hypocrite this man is 😂😂😂😂
Nice video but I ain't downlaoding this 😂
ANOTHER NIGGA MADE THE NEWS IT AINT NUN NEW 🔥🔥🔥
Really doesn’t sound all that good... mumble mumble
This side of 21 is deep‼️🙌🏽
A this stuff right here true af...And people think that he talk all about is just gang banigin
good song just wish it didnt have autotone
That’s some tur shit
It would take cops 40 years to kill as many black men as have died at the hands of others black men in 2012 alone.
bruh, I've been listening to this song way before it even blew up, shout out to my boy 21 savage, he really does deserve all the fame, after all the pain he's gon through in his life

Was that XXXTentacion at 3:33
African Americans are responsible for 50 percent of Americas murders yet represent 15 percent of the population stop blaming causion for problems. Most if the African American teens getting killed are getting murdered by their own race
1:39 singing with the song and I said BANANA
With the ending i'm not sure if the girl dead or not, cause she put the gun back. So does that mean that the video was just her thinking about what will happen if she takes the gun. But still that was really moving, like i was to distracted by the video to listen to the lyrics, but i listened to it again and i feel 21, for real.
Black lives matter, except when its black killing black
We hate black people because of how they act and how disrespectful they are toward anything and the only ones who steal end is not by their skin color is more because of their attitude their acts the why they are so hated
*Hey look another muppet in the great COINTEL PRO scam being propagated to us!*
Ys the cop look like hitler
you can see the pain in his eyes💔
-They thought I only rap about murder and pistols \n*next verse \n-my nigga got that heat ready to gun you down
Wow that's a very deep song and the very saddest part is that this is real, still today too. Very incredible music video probs on you I think we can ALL feel what you feel👍👏👌
Where's his lean😰
If you're a real nigger you would slap ricegum for being a bitch
damn, Savage dropped jewels on this one, we gotta get it together, that's 4 sure
On me this white niggas saying nigger
Savage: I done lost too many people.\nCharlamagne: All to gun violence?\nSavage: Every last one of 'em.\nCharlamagne: So when you see that in your life, do you feel like, You know what, maybe I shouldn't rap about these things...Do you think there will be a point in time where you don't rap about that stuff, cause you know what it does to the community?\nSavage: One day I will, but, if 21 Savage didn't come out rappin about those things then who would be listening to me? Would I even be on this platform to be talkin' to you if it wasn't for me saying ignorance to catch people's attention?\nCharlamagne: Damn, that make me feel bad. - August 4th, 2016.\n\nYou got my attention.
If you think about it people kill black people for no reason (not to be racist) example MLK MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS KILLED CAUSE HE WAS BLACK SOCIETY  IS HORRIFIC ESPACCIALY LOOK AT ME XXXTENTACION (the vedio) DONT WHATCH ITS SAD PLEASE LIKE PLEASE LIKE \n\n\n\nread more
Damn a fucking god of these new rappers because he made a song with actual truth and a message
Sophie here! Apologies I meant David Luiz back from suspension not injury! Besides this, I do feel our title hopes are unfortunately over. Our rivals are displaying much better performances. Thoughts??
Dont play Cahill for Ffs i said in my line u play C.Ap A.c Rud \nPlay david in mid we were so rubbish its unbelievable honest why did we not keep the ball bats had his chance i would have played Ped from the starts instead of William our team needs to do some much hard core training we playes a team that have a game since the start . The 2nd goal wtf wtf wtf come on he runs past u and score . Please we need to play A.C Rud at the bk . We have serious need of players . Simple
think we should concentrate on europe, man city are looking on another level this year.....
Michy isn't a premiership player we are playing as a mid table side
Bakayoko was the best player. Michy was the worst. And there were some people who said they prefered that formation over the false 9...
Just a shit day. Big players like Hazard, Azpi who are consistently brilliant were completely out of it today. It's clear to see why Michy isn't rated by Conte. We've got Tammy banging them in for Swansea, infinitely better than Michy who imo plays better with a second striker. No Kante, no Drinkwater, no Morata, Moses goes off, just a shit day. Happens. Conte should rotate? With what?\n Hasn't got the players or quality to rotate. We move on and we put it right asap. COME ON CHELSEA!
Things that went wrong for me. Willan ,Alonso,michy. No quality in backup. Board didn't back Conte he was calling for it all summer. Probably a cup top 8 or top 4 in champions league and see pep take the league when we could have build on a winning season
Hazard is not a world class player..
Its not the end of the season just yet and just like last season chelsea will start winning their games and get more points 2 win the league . 4 this season , I think Chelsea might become first and do what they did last season
Stunning Sophie would love to tie you to that bed and do torturous things to you~ \n\nOut title race is over, Hazard will leave for Madrid because of Willian's wankstain ability.\n\nCahil still starts, Christiensen dropped for no reason. \n\nConte still the stubborn old bag he is. Michi needs to fuck off the Twitter merchant cunt.
I can definitely see you Sophie 💦💦
This always happens with Chelsea. Those who run the club run it like a business so they do not invest to maintain the momentum. The root problem is at the top with the board who in turn have to do what the Russian Oligarch says. The incompetence at board level is breath-taking. They do not get behind the manager at Chelsea by investing. You can win the Champions League or the title at Chelsea and still get the sack....that is a dictatorship that demands success yesterday. And yet despite being a business rather than a football club, they can't even run a frigging business properly. The Mancs and the North London lot must be having a right laugh. Mourinho must be so very relieved to have moved on from this Chelsea board. They want success quickly that's why the youth team will never get established in the first team. It gets so very weary and exasperating supporting Chelsea which I have done for nearly 50 years. I knew of the 31 August deadline day that the inexcusable indifference of the Chelsea board to reward Conte for the title was a sign that the lack of depth would mean yet another exasperating season after winning the title. No loyalty to managers from the board, no heart, no steel, no true leaders. And to think some people think they will have a right good go at the Champions League.... It's helpful to not hope too much from Chelsea and why? Because they NEVER LEARN from their mistakes. In the real world those board members would have been sacked long ago. But not at a Business run farce like farce like this lot.  Have something else substantial in your life apart from Chelsea Sophie is my advice.
The Kante rumour was meant to trigger you guys. Kante wouldn't get in to that PSG midfield.
Sophie babes I wish u was mine so peng 😍❤️
its about time tammy abraham next season should be first team regular next year man on form in swansea he should play with alvaro mrata week in week out charly musonda shold be given more time
As a city fan I was felling like this when we lost at Leicester and Everton so really Chelsea fans welcome to reality I'm enjoying heaven with city. Secondly best was fabregas and worst Mr invisible hazard
You  are better pundit than some at Sky sports, keep it up . Chelsea will come back
batshuay out. call Tammy Abraham, Even if he is not going to score but he has good movement than Batshuay. I hate Batshuay
Michy isn't as good as other strikers. He doesn't make runs or give defenders a hard time. It was his time to shine but he never. Now I understand why conte doesn't rate him. Just a shitty day but I hope we bounce back against Roma.
the problem with chelsea is your overconfident conte prick! you shouldnt change your winning comibination be it any sport! the guy let costa, matic leave who were key players for you the last time so it shouldnt be a shock to you!
Conte didn't even  commit long-term to Chelsea and he was allowed to get away with offloading Costa, our top goal scorer, one of the best in the PL. Now we're seeing the effect of that. Chelsea is done for now and the next 2 years, we won't win anything. Conte will not attract any top player with this attitude.
Bakayoko and fabregas were the only players showing any real passion but weren't good enough like the rest of the squad. Cahill needs to be dropped completely we have 2 centre backs on the bench who are better and have passion. Willian isn't the same player he used to be which is a concern as he has been so good in the past. Zappacosta looked good when he came on. If we are that desperate for a striker then we should recall Abraham? He needs to work alongside people like Morata to show quality. Simply not good enough.
i don't think you can retain your title. top four/cup is the best for you, but even if conte is not at fault, he would get the sack if he doesn't do much this season. that said, he IS at fault for you lot, sicne he's got shit tactically wrong.
If we still have Costa and Matic in that match .............
Best performance was Cahill , worst was azpilicueta , all the rest were awful
Conte of late is making a habit picking the wrong squad....cahill,willian keep strolling into the team when they are clearly out of form.....rudiger,pedro,christinsen keep warming the bench...why??something is going on behind the scenes and conte needs to sort out the issue.
Conte needs to just fucking get over it. work with what u got. we still have enough in our squad to beat a shit side like Palace. He needs to get he head in it because he is obviously distracted by something.
Can someone tell this chick that its not about the selection its about the whole team... We needed reinforcements in the summer.. Maybe Cahil shouldn't start but having Willian and Alonso with no replacement... Michy aint a  footballer!! \nAnyone that thinks Michy is by any chance better than Arsenal's Yaya Sanogo then you're deluded!!!\nI don't know why i'm commenting here...fuck this shit hahaha!
I think Tammy Abraham is better than Michy. 4 Epl goals in 5 game is absolutely good talent.  We need to back him because off we need him.
we'll be okay against Roma
Unless Man City do an Arsenal and crumble spectacularly towards end of season, then the title is surely theirs.. This Chelsea squad isn't as good as last years. Sell Matic get Drinkwater?! Transfer window was a joke, Morata is good but he's just one player. We're gonna be fighting for a top four place for sure!\nStill early days, gonna reserve full judgement until around November. Echo other comments would like top four finish with stronger emphasis on Champs league.
Babe shows us some cleavage when Chelsea looses as it will at least help a bit
Oh Conte's a little bit rubbish now.. Just go do one Sophie ffs
Please popularise this comment to conte. Some improvements: buy aubameyang to play him up front with Morata. Also, get Sanchez. His skill works amazing with hazard and pedro and Willian. Imagine that. Sanchez. Aubameyang. We have the money! Cmon conte!!!!!
Yeah, concentrate on CL That'll help.......
Can u dress like u did in soccer am
Well firstly Rory never has a clue! Didn’t see the match today first one missed in ages , I do agree we won’t win the league. Man City will easily but we should try and at least push for 2nd or 3rd
We need Jamie Vardy pay the 40 or 50m
Got a phone number ?
It’s funny coz I was getting clothes for my holiday and there was a palace supporter severing me and I was like I think palace will win as a joke and he was like nah Chelsea will smash us and here we, I was right even though I didn’t want to be 😂
Drinking water,)\nToday in Liverpool vs man United\n one  player\n he looks like a big STARS on the making.. unbelievable \n.. 11..⏳👌👏
Batshuayi looses the ball so easily, he just can't hold up the ball. On top of that many players underperformed today ( don't want to pin point them ). Yes after this game the title hopes are realistically over, unless we pull off something great.
really dislike michy as a player
4 min in and your analysis is....what is it exactly? You are not consistent and you are too emotional. I will chalk it up to thinking with you heart. \n\nGive credit to Palace and the position they were in. They don’t want to break the record for worst start to a season. Zaha has always given us problems and was running riot on Cahill and Alonso. Townsend and C are quality and the ball and luck was with them. \n\nChelsea was looking forward to midweek obviously. The analysis is quite easy for an educated footballer/supporter. I know you have it in you. \nI recommend writing up some outline notes and maybe watch highlights to refresh you memory. I support  you and your Channel and I love you as a fellow fan...and of course dem tig-o-bittties heheh 😏\n\n#COYB
Hellooo gorgeous, u look healthier than the previous video..I think baka n ces should not play together.. agree w/ u Rudi, Andreas n Azpi as the back three.. and why Willian Conte????
I want to see only two things this season, and you know it...
Sophie is class,speaks a lot of sense. - Manchester Utd fan.
Fabregas was world class that match, it's a shame he was the only one who was half decent though. Even Bakayoko was average because, apart from his goal, his performance was sub par. I still have faith in Conte to bring us back into the title race however. COYB
You just got beat by the *CRYSTAL PALACE* football club, formed in *1861* then founded in *1905*
This season is all about the Champions League. If we finished 4th, that would be fine considering our injuries and lack of depth for now. Roman is all about the CL and unless we take points from Roma, it's going to be ugly. If we don't make the round of 16, the season may be the Mourinho year we didn't think possible. Would back-to-back losses to Roma be the end of Conte? He looked pretty angry in the post-match press conference. Too bad there's not an October window.\n\nMitchy showed what no one is willing to say, and that is he doesn't actually create anything and he's scored his goals almost accidentally. Better as a sub when nothing else is working. I wasn't surprised to see Musonda. I expect to see him play v. Roma, even if Conte says Morata will play.
You are going to be very happy I suppose when Conte leaves !! Mitchy suuuuuucksssss
I hope you manage to decipher that I am a real Chelsea Fan amongst the idiots in this comments section, born and raised Chelsea Wharf and Worlds End.\n\n1.What's the big crisis? We lost to the current premiership leaders 1-0, and lets be honest they have been killing all the competition 4-0, 5-0, 7-0 etc.\n\n2. Palace away , who lets not forget are great going forward.\n\n3.A depleted squad with an own goal to boot.\n\n4.INTERNATIONAL duty meant players got injured and fatigued.\n\nCmon you Blues!!
Everyone was just bad, no one did any good.....
Not only were Chelsea the first team to concede to the one of the worst premier league teams ever (not scoring for 7 games straight, losing all) but they also lost to that team.\n\nWow....
I want to be with you in your flat Sophie
Embarrassing...nothing more to say.
Llorente didn't want to join Chelsea, prefered Tottenham anyway.
Highlights | Live Match Review?
😍😘😗😙😑
Bring back Tammy, play Christensen, Rudiger, Azpi! :(
Hazard was terrible
who's zara?
except bakayoko nobody was good without kante
Best - Zappacosta Worst - Luiz
You missed MATIC !
Fuck u guys
Poor game
Title hopes are gone :(
bring back tammy ffs
Ur so beautiful baby girl
Chelshit
can we play you every week......and didnt we beat you last season......get over it
I fking called it.. if rorey stops doing those 5 reasons that we smash crystal palace and such bullshit and jinx the damn team always against these minnows it would be appreciated. lol
The Atletico was one of my favourite performances ever from us, we actually attacked. City was back to normal, just trying to sit back and defend, and a poor team choice from Conte, then this game was just embarrassing, we had players missing but still.
Now you see why Michi should not start.
We are missing a leader up front, which is Costa.
Wahey! Hahahaha fucking palace the Geordie's will show you's southern cunts how it's done next week!
Yes Sophie we had an arguement few days ago about  this game, as we all worried  about it, as we all can smell problems in our team. Palace is not an average team, they are loaded with some very good players and a very good coach. Zaha  is probably better than most of the Chelsea attackers, and Townshend is a better  winger than any Chelsea's wingers. Conte is very upset, very angry and probably will not sleep for a few nights. he knows he made mistakes, and he is a very good learner. Let's hope  he will do his homework well. Problem is not just a debt. We have now 4!!!! injured players and at least  2-3  completely  out of form. We do have Musonda and we do have Kennedy. maybe Conte should  give these two  a fair chance
Let's be honest.  Conte is going to leave. The board are clearly pissing him off and it's effecting the team.  Not contes fault.  Fuck the board
Truth. Conte is rigid. Christensen can play on the LCB.\nTruth. Trust a woman's intuition, Rory. Your positivity is on plastic levels.\n\nBest performance is Cesc. Worst is the whole team.\n\nNo chance of League. Don't dream of Cups (except Sophie's). Conte's record in cup competition is abysmal.
I tried to troll Chelsea but then realize we have just lost 2-1 to  Watford
fuck off   chelsea
The difference between us and the Manchester clubs are why we are not as good as them, our squad is just as good, if not better, but we mess up against teams like this, and when we do win we sit back and defend when the Manchester clubs go to destroy every team. We need to play like we did against Atletico every game, we need to stop this sitting back game plan now.
Exchange batshuayi for Zaha in January
I only hope Christensen goes to a better team that will value him, why on earth are we not playing a class young CB who will be the best defender in the world.
Hazard is inconsistent for us but for Belgium he bangs in goals all day long
We will still win the league

My goodness, waving your hands in front of the camera does my head in.
hey doug could you review death sentence starring Kevin bacon
Of all your skits in this one, the Jewish boy, your round table of ITS, and the chart men were the best acted and the most enjoyable.
I freaking love the remake of it
These suck since they stopped using footage from the movie
yea i get the end they have a group sexthing
I'm surprised Walter wasn't playing Patrick also. They look very similar.
Unless its the Lorax walking in front of a red curtain. Then your gonna watch a pretty good movie.
If we used jokers for comparison, Tim Curry would be the Joker by Jack Nicholson and Bill Skarsgård is more like Jared Leto
how can you not bring up how bad the new pennywise's voice is... it's like the worst scoobie doo impression ever
Wait what happened in the book that bev does
Given that i never watched either version of the movie, IT is just confusing.
Penny wise loves trolling those kids. I wish he would have rick rolled one of them.
Dont they know that like, the adults have been infected by IT?\n\nLike, the balloons around them and their creepy demeanor
But not in slow mo! I fucking died
Anyone else think Doug looks like Dr venture?
thats a butterfly knife with a red wood or a polished wood handle
When I saw that dance part I instantly was like that was definitely made to be made into a meme
Does Doug not know what a synagogue is? Jewish Temple? The jewish faith in it's current form is sort of defined by the fact that they lost their temple.
The leper guy wasn’t just sick, he was very deformed and gross looking, and I think he had a lot of bursted blisters. It still worked cause he was a creepy exaggeration of what a sick person is like.
I've never really like scary shows so I never saw the movie, but I know how disappointing an overly hyped movie can be. When Dragon Ball the movie came out years ago all my friends were ecstatic to see it... only to be completely and utterly enraged by it to the point that they cornered me in the lunch room and flat out forbade me from ever seeing it. And these were hardcore Anime fans too, not exactly a good idea to disappoint them.
Moss might be more well known, but Dean Learner would have been more fitting due to the Stephen King link.
about Bill Contorting his body: Skarsgard can ACTUALLY contort his body without the use of digital effects. that's a Talent barely anyone possesses.
I loved the tie in to the Batman: Animated Series. Almost Got Him was one of my favorite episodes!
So wait, you don't like jeff dunham? He's pretty good.
Hey nostalgia critic can you do back at the barnyard
They tried too hard on the movie. But hey appently to the internet Pennywise is hot
Damn, props off to the makeup crew, you guys looked awesome.
holy shit, this fucking review. NC, you never disappoint.
One of the bullies floats in the original It.  The scene is in my It Dance Remix video.  \n\nHe lied though, they don't all float down here.
Hi Nostalgia. You forgot the part about the projector scene. That was creepy as hell. I liked all the good points you pointed out but I wanted to know your thoughts about the projector scene. I liked both versions. Although I'm terrified as clowns. But it had a good plot.
Hi Nostalgia critic. I'm an enormous fan, but i must say you left out one sequence to talk about in the new it, the projector scene. I will agree though the are both good in there own right
In case you have been living under a rock and never watched this sexy, weird, scary? video... just google ME! ME! ME! RockoCullen feat. daoko TeddyLoid
I agreed with a lot of the critiques but I was absolutely disgusted by the leper and freaked out too.
Man , the dance in the end I just need it in my phone right now XD.
Huge fan of NC. This was terrible. Please find other actors to play important roles. Doug, you cannot act.
The absolute best part of the entire video is when OG Pennywise said “we’re friggin clowns!” I mean his voice sounded like he was in a crisis, and I love it. Like he desperately wants the new Pennywise to know there clowns as if he new one denies it to the point of insanity and he really cares for the new one. Of course I’m reading too much into it. But that’s what it sounds likes to me
I got a tooth pulled this morning and I kid you not I ruptured the clot  from laughing so hard 😂😂
They all fucked in the book
Why do I feel like Hollywood just wanted to do Stranger Things as a Stephen King adaptation?
Whats the beat used during the meme me part?
Nice!!!!!  =)  Thanks to all involved in this remake of a remake <g>  Very fun!
Okay I understand why Bowers was picking on Mike because he was Black, but in this version I'm guessing that's Victor, he Black, but I still like the video.
i love this review and i hope you'll get 1 mill soon because i know you deserve it
Gotta say, you actually acted out both IT personalities very well during the whole review. Impressive
Woooow. Love how he based this episode off that one Batman: TAS episode! Even the surprise character reveal.
gotta disagree with you on the leper scene. the guy looked a lot more... leperish (i guess?) than how you portrayed it. this scene took me by surprise.
IT 2017: ANY ONE WHO HATE IT IS A MOVIE HATER\nNC: well\nIT 2017: YES MOVIE HATER?
If i were in charge of the leper scene he would have looked more like a guy with the flesh eating virus. Half his face would be rotting/gangrenous and the other half would be just his bare skull.
I laughed through most of the movie, including the headless boy seen. But thank you Nostalgia Critic for pointing out something I have been saying since the trailer, when Pennywise runs its hilarious
damn you all really look like the characters it's kinda scary...
Single handedly the BEST video Doug has ever made. I mean, I could watch this video over and OVER again more than I could the movies. XD
I like both its but my favorite is the 2017 version
While the review itself is good, the main problem I have is when describing problems the movie has visually like the sound being really loud, the scene being acted out isn't scary either way and if we could see the actual scene from the movie it would help us understand better. The scene about how pennywise is to scary bothered me to since the actor looks ridiculous and I feel it undermined his points. If we could get the scene right from the movie or even just some images it would help your point a lot more. I know its because of copyright but I feel waiting longer for the risk to be lower and you freely able to show it would help a lot. This also hurt his Jurassic world review a lot for me to
Am I the only one who sees a speck on the lens sometimes? XD
Oh yeah, I'm not doing that
Im 11 and I like the original was better
I can agree with most of these points but I personally (not at ALL a germophobe) found the Leper VERY unsettling, and the dancing scene made me extremely uncomfortable, admittedly mostly because of the focus effect they put on his face so everything was moving around it. Overall tho, I loved the movie but I agree.
This just like the batman ep
but dident tim curry play the joker in BM animated series?
(I just want to say this because it’s been bugging me for a while at how he doesn’t get this) the reason for Tim Curry’s Pennywise Head turning into a dog was supposed to be scary is because people have a fear of dogs, it’s actually in one of the top 5 phobias, and Pennywise is a shape shifter who turns into your fears.
Where is the Rose Red Miniseries review, or  The Stand? Too old?
I don't like the new It. It scared the holy fuck out of me. Fucking terrifying
Well I liked Leto's Joker and both IT films equally. And Walker, Simpsons Season 6 is past your time as are the Transformers.
Loved the new IT movie!! Take it
Hey nostalgia critic you know scary godmother it had a sequel.
what does bill bev and ben even do in the book?
I'm married, i love my wife
You're book reference at the end actually makes me wanna read the book now.
Can I just say I love the who's on first reference at the end
I love this video its hilarious
So kids, how's your sex life? Let's go eat hah.
Ruined my new fav movie but still a good review \nxD

Beep beep Critic.
“Exactly you dumbass.” XD
Balloons.
WAHAP! WAHAP! WAHAP!
Fear my running sqwuaaaa
Meme me!!
Whatched this, like, ten times lol
Voted 2017 most ad freindly show on youtube.
We’re friggin clowns
Food! Town!
It was just a prank, -Han- Woody!
i predict strong 5 out of 10. watchable
I love this studio...
I'm a bit disappointed that it isn't La2er Team
TBS or Adult Swim will likely air this after AT&T complete the acquisition of Time Warner. RT is co-owned by AT&T. Bring It On! (I have go to watch the first one though).
How long before It's not a DeLorean! becomes a shirt?
I can see that the writing hasn't really improved much...\n(JK, I love you guys)
Oh God, does this mean every single RT video is going to start with the teaser This video brought to you by the new movie Laser Team 2. Coming November 22?
Lazer Team is slowly becoming SuperStore. Can't wait for Dina to be in Lazer Team 3.
I really do hope it's better than the first one.
change the name to razor team and slit your wrists..
Gavin couldn't film because he was in Britain the whole time The Movie
Didn't they lose like $800,000 on the first Lazer Team? Hope you can pull it off with the sequel Rooster Teeth...
I legit just watched lazer team again before i saw this! We doing a fund for this one too?
Man did she get down in shameless 🤘
There are jokes here about Gavin still never being at work, and Across the Galaxy is really just across the ocean in jolly ol' England
Is that Emily from Until Dawn? It looks like her
nice gavins gonna be present for 5% of the movie just like how hes present 5% of the time already
With each Lazer Team movie, we slowly replace all the original cast with the Superstore cast
What is it with Rooster Teeth and rifts
How come this community doesn't understand jokes or sarcasm?\nThat's all this channel is
aye they got emily from until dawn
im so happy right now!!!!
I bet it's actually a DeLorean.
Why is Gavin/Woody not in that thumbnail?
Is that Emily from Until Dawn?
This one looks wayyyyyyyy better then the first one
End of lazer team 1: \n*Ice cube's voice*\nyall motherf*ckers is going to space
If there isn't a Delorean in this film, so help me....
THU CUT OFF HIS HEAD\nYOU KILLED HIM
Cant wait to see that sweet sweet Delorean
Amazing also I feel like Michael just plays himself in these movies
Lol Gavin is lost! That makes so much sense!
I think I'm more excited for this one because now I know what I'm getting myself into lol
sir they have locked lasers onto us
I watched the 1 now I am watching the second when it comes out
So there going into another dimension...ok\n(Silently hops they meet the reds and blues)
soooooooooooo....... no gavin for more than 65% of the movie???\n(Also I'm just guessing how much of the movie gavin won't be in )
Well... I'll be waiting for the Blu Ray
Okay but real truth here, when does the blu ray come out?
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going.
I can already tell it's gonna be hilarious.
I actually liked the first one for some reason.
I have yet to see the first one, and you're already bringing out a second. Bravo, dudes and dudettes - bravo!
...I see the writing is still clever.
first one was meh, but I liked it just cause of burnie, michael, and gavin...this one looks meh, but I will watch it cause of burnie, michael, and gavin
*AND YOU DIDN'T BRING ANY EXTRA PLUTONIUM?*
I hope the dialog volume is a bit higher in the movie than in the trailer, some of the texts were hard to make out.
all aboard to the HYPE Train!
IS THIS ONE PLAYING AT TORONTO AFTER DARK TOO???
Reviews for the first one weren’t good, because people never watched roosterteeth, the jokes were great and I loved it, this looks even better
Is that emily from until dawn? if it is and you didn't make a joke aout the butterfly effect i will be disappointed.
They got that one girl from shameless.
This and the first Lazer Team are the main reasons why I have my YouTube Red account. I'm so hyped!
Really hope this is rated R...
I hate to say it, but i'm kind of surprised there doing another one after the last one did so poorly.
The first one was really bad, and this one looks worse from the trailer only.
I feel bad about Gavin, he is poor when he got stuck across the galaxy, but I like the girl's hairstyle.\n👏🏻🖖🏻👌🏻👍🏻✌🏻️😃
I can't wait!
Lazer Team 2: Finding Free-mo
Can anyone please tell me the name of the song playing? It's so goofy I need it.
Oh yes
From the thumbnail I was worried they cast Lindsey as the scientist.  thank god it didn't happen.
I am really happy this is coming out soon! way to go RT, I'll see you in theaters next month
So this is it, huh, we're some kind of Lazer Team?
is that amanda from shameless?
I'll be honest, I REALLY liked the first movie and I'm looking forward to this one. Maybe it's the fanboy in me talking, IDK.
I feel there going to scale back on the sequel. But I'm still excited. The dynamic between the team and the scientist might be interesting.
*when Gavin is taken* YOU BASTARDS
Jesus wait, I haven’t even seen the first one yet...I want to if you wanted to know
Can't Wait!!!!!
Ew
I'm excited
ITS NOT A DELOREAN!
Anyone wander why this is on trending with 200k views and h3s video with 10mil in one day wasn't... YouTube there's other ways of advertising! Which are fairer too
Lazer team X
Looks good
No. No. NOO. NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Laze team 2 =  Big hero 6
Ahhhh!!!! Yes!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Woo!  (•̀o•́)ง
lol
I CANT FREAKIN WAIT!!!!
Hot garbage 2: dumpster fire
YES!
RWBY İS COMİNG TOMORROW
oh no

Yayyyyyyyyyy
This looks good
Beutumis
Haha haha so funny
NO GAVINOOFREEEEEEE unsub
Lazer Team 2: Git Lazerer.
IS ThAt Max
It's not Delorian!
This is going to be a fail
im kinda surprised since the first one bombed
The first one was meh at best and the ending was terrible was make a second one
Wow I love the rhythm. Good song for dance. Btw John Legend looks so much younger with all that outfits and eyeglasses. He is like 25 years
This video brings out so much anger and frustration in me because of all the injustices it portrays are so real and relevant
John Legend doesn’t get old
I'm not even gay but I'd let him fuck me
Bro this made me cry. That red hat only means one thing. Referring to Donald Trump.
omg the message is so extraordinary. The penthouse floor is a symbol.. for..... I guess at this point we can all guess what it is....This was heart wrenching and just at the end when everyone is crossing the lines and coming together. DAMNNN
here because of chance the rapper. they did a good blend I kind a like john legend again
I was here oct 16 2017. Before all y’all 1.8 million. \n\n\n\n\nBanger track btw
Another Enlightenment period in American history.
Who else came for Chance and stayed for John?
Was Jess wellens the photographer at 2:24?
John Legend is like... The worst employee. He clocks in, picks up one tray of hors d'oeuvres, but like, doesn't even serve it, dicks around on the piano, and crashes a photo shoot.
Some rookie mistakes in terms of cinematography
Go to the penthouse floor 🎶🎶
John Legend is Legen, wait for it... DARY!!!
hit like if you're listening to this 2069. I may be dead that time but 2069 pal will see this post. hehe creepy ayt?
woke up this morning got yourself a gun
This song makes me wanna eat my shirt for dinner
Is he throwing shade at Travis Scott
I'm confused is chance a woman?
Last week,  Penthouse Floor by John Legend.\nThis week, Bedroom Floor by Liam Payne.\nNext week, Whitewash Floor by SNL!!😂😂😂
I'm still waiting on that Fiona Apple collaboration! This had elements of Fiona's sound in it. Please make it happens?
Chance the rapper sounds the same in every song
Don't usually comment on YouTube but I love this song and I'm happy it got a video! This album was great!
Yesss the john legend is back
If only John, if only...Beautiful video!
here because of chance
I love the shot with the people in the dining room. It symbolizes everyone having a seat at the kitchen table, or in other words, everyone has an opportunity to have the power to be heard and influence the world in a positive way. This kitchen table was so full that people are even standing around it. But, that doesn't matter because even those people are welcomed with the love and respect they deserve.
New phone who dis? :') reminds me of 'You're the worst' lmao.
liked it and didnt even watch it yet
Chance has a bobble head.
EQUALLY A dream ☝️day will be true
That beat is smooth as hell
Everything about that was WOKE AF. Brilliant, true brilliance.

Just playin'\nJust me, new phone, new hair, new era\nI'm in the penthouse baby\nHandpicked from bad apples and bad eggs\nHeld back, I had to grab crab legs\nAnd then there were only but a few\nConversations held with patience, what a party what a view\nWhat a dress, what a song\nWhat a beautiful time\nMy folks still downstairs waiting in line\nThey never been in these rooms\nThey never stayed with these folks\nNever laughed at the news, never hated these jokes\nSo was I fly in my suit, in a group, on the cover\nForcing a smile, then he tells me another\nHe said what happened to the boy that climbed in the trunk\nHe pushed me off the top he said Jump nigga jump!\n\n[John Legend:]\nOh don't bring me down I need a room in the clouds\nI wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate\nOh my favourite mix\nA little ignorance and bliss\nIn the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse\n\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nLet's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for\nWe'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nThose penthouse doors\nWe'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nBaby, I'm in the penthouse floor\nBaby, let's ride the elevator\nTil we can rise some more\nGo to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go let's go let's go)
✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽 we can do it✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽
bruh this song is old asf. i dont know why people didn't know it already
If you're going to comment, comment something useful or an opinion. Stop saying here first or who's here before 1 mil There are billions of people out there who don't have access to the internet, I'm pretty sure if they were given a chance to comment they won't say First or Here before this blows up. Open your eyes look how you're blessed. \nJohn Legend, you did a great job. The message is very powerful and important at this time. Thank you so much.
god bless whoever makes a perfect instrumental of this
That’s the future I wanna live in
In B 4 2 Mill Views!!!!! means I am chill right?!!!!
He came back to reality at the end of the video...

Nice Vocal, nice melody, nice video ❤ \nGreat work! 🎶
Great work guys ❤️
Very cool track, I'm not so fan of this generic future house drop but the melody and Vassy's vocal in particular are amazing :)
Afrojack in armada , who cares as long he bring best music

Afrojack 💯💯💯💯💕💖
What a song! 🔥🔥👏
Afrojack_The King!
Afrojack!!\nLet's Go!!

The piano is legit!!!
Me recuerda a los viejos tiempos :') Esencia pura.
Esta hermosa la canción con un buen ritmo <3
Tá show é a melhor vocalista do mundo ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
the quick if i had to get doesn't really fit but besides that its a fine track.
I'm not sure why Afrojack is releasing on Armanda. But considering the other songs he has released they wouldn't fit on armanda very well. But I'm just happy this song exists.
That piano feels out of beat...
Afrojack, Dillon Francis , Borgeous on Armada ?what’s next Martin Garrix on Armada ?
where is afrojack :D
Look my new video in my channel help please
Nahh ....... Future House isn't Afrojack at all ....
Amazing.

no me gustan los videos con logos
No hay la opcion me encanta no? Buena Musica Un gusto haberte visto por Perú Afrojack (Y)vuelva pronto
que grande!!! afrojack and vassy sigan asi saludos desde argentina!!!
La música, lenguaje universal. - Music, universal language.
Μπραβο VASSY πολυ ωραιο κομματι
Swedish House Mafia vibe? anybody?
Afrojack is dutch so my reaction is gonna be dutch too. In Nederland zijn de dj's veel beter dan in De Verenigde Staten (veel succes met vertalen) (much luck with translating)
Uwielbiam takie kawałki i ten głos.. Vassy
Vassy is really awesome cool vocal and we by Tiesto song same cool groove 💕💕💕💕💕✌️
VASSY, you should sing more, your voice is awesome! Youre doing really well.
Vassy's voice is simply made for EDM 😍👌
Ten utwór jest mało ambitny, taki radiowy pop dla plebsu!
This song has me missing people I haven't even met before 😳 Loving the new tune 🔥🔥🤘
its meh
banda de latinoamerica y el mundo pasen a mi canal esta semana hay mucho drop
LIKE SI AFROJACK ES UN PVTO AMO
Am I the only one who thinks that the vocals of Vassy started at a weird point  of the instrumental? It just seemed off to me :/\n\nEdit: Also her timing right before the drop hits is weird to me.\n\nCorrect me if im wrong :P
AXLE IS A BLOATED SHADOW OF HIMSELF, AND THE BAND IS SLOPPY. SELLING A FADED DREAM OF DAYS GONE BYE NOW IS ALL!!
Slash still looks hot under that hat, hair and shades
Love it.  Axl is clearly whistling with a backing track, but it'd be impossible to pull that off ive every night.
Great video quality! What camera did you use?
Welp...... my life is now complete
Wow what's on his waist ??trash bags?? love the group but why the shaggy stuff hanging??? They still sound AWESOME!!
This band sucks.  Axl Rose is a complete tool bag.  And Pink??  WTF?  Real badasses!  Your street cred is gone.
What camera are you using to take the vid? Great quality for how zoomed in it was.
Thank you for sharing. You've got an excellent camera, what is it?
I had such an awesome time at the concert last night 🤙🏼☠️ sickkkkkk
I hope the it ain’t easy guy keeps his desire for a drug free life. Lots of temptation.
pinks voice works so well with the singer's voice
that was kool man
Axel's trying to turn back the clock, he had a great career going in his younger days with GNR but his whiny self-absorbed or for me attitude ruined it. When he finally grew up and by the looks of it grew out he wanted to capture what he lost in his youth, that never happens. There's plenty of singers in their 50s that still look good real good so age is not an excuse. He's just a shell of his former self a star that faded out long ago. His ego ruined his career pure and simple. I really like to listen to them back in the day slash still has all the talent in the world one of the best guitar players ever my opinion.
Great as usual. Never disappoint
Damn axl even whistle like Mickey Mouse. Welcome to Disneyland city where the voice is lost and the vocal chords are ruined. ....
Damn, sure Axl ate a fucking lot of halal food outside the msg
Sorry.. it would have been the best if axl sang the whole thing. I mean pink did ok but the song is axl's.
lets face it . .she didn't exactly do a lot did she . .what was the point ?
So many wasted years with Gnr glad to see axel finally came around

Why are the guitars so high in treble..it hurts the ears
Lol..He is so bad pink had to stop singing so she wouldn't show him up
Which is pink a nd which is axle
Agh 💕 much to love to axl rose 💕💕 saw there this past summer and never rock n rolled so hard in my life 💕💕
Dam, Axl has gotten a fat belly. Guess we all get a little older and thicker around the waistline. Lol
Omg. At least pink can still sing. Axle sounds like shit. Maybe thats why it took so long to get the balz to try again. Original GnR was the best.
at least PINK can sing--damn guns did you forget how to use the vocals??
I can not love this enough
I love you Pink
Yea she was always a huge fan! Good for her man!
Até que ele se tornou um senhorzinho simpático depois de sequestrar o Axl Rose ... Rsrs \n\nBrincadeiras a parte, o vídeo ficou mto bom !!
It seems for her, was a dream come true ...
GnR was a great band. 20yrs ago. 💛
My favorite band back when. Miss those days
She said stuck in the ground should be stuck in the crowd but overall she sounded great.I'm technical is all so don't mind me.😉
Shame.... I grew up with this band when they were the hottest thing going...Axl Rose looks like a tele tubby and should just sit down
Duff looks good,  straight edge gets the ladies,  blow is so eighties
Axl n Pink....Lets get this party started !!!
Please someone get a personal trainer for Axl
Even the god is smiling
G & R is a legendary rock band. Best time of my life was when they were at their peak in the 90's.
A lot of cake has been eaten by these two...
Duff seems to still be sexy af...
he is losing weight
GnR are actually relevant again! ÀND KICKIN ASS! just stick to the hits though we don't need another spaghetti incident
in the old days they would have had  nothing to do with her  type, pink , man o man, what happen
*_THANK GOD, that Axl Rose isn't a douchebag Trump supporter._*
Holy crap that was cool!
НИХУЯ СЕБЕ! Неожиданно!
love
pink messed that one up
Meravigliosooooooo....axl e pink♛♚
Axel looks like any fatty seating in a white trash bar...pffff!!!!
pity she couldn't sing in time with the music
Tão lindo ver o trio parada dura juntos❤
I'm a huge pink fan but that sucked :(
Pink is the best female entertainer in nay genre\\\love that lady!
God .... Axl needs to drop about 30 pounds
Pink is a huge fan of GN'R. \m/
Ok, I knew Pink was cool, this helps prove it.
Never thought I'd see that happen. I like the new Axl.
My life has been restored.
Wish he would have done this song when i saw him at soldier field  this summer!
Ela canta muito, só não sabe o que é tempo e andamento.
Love Pink. Her voice is amazing.

With all the flagship models, most cameras do great and you're right, it is difficult to tell the difference. After all, in real life, nobody is going to sit and compare your travel photos taken with the Google Pixel 2 or the iPhone 8. The best camera is the one we have with us, and more often than not, the most important element of the camera is the one who's pressing the shutter.
Right on. Thank you.
Dope video & and thanks for dropping some knowledge.
I love your show. You deserve all your subs. Well done Sir.
how did Pixel get a weighted average of 99 when none of the individual values are as high as that
I'd get it if it had a headphone jack - _-
Anyone know where that Engadget video is? Can't seem to find it.
Are you going to do a full review of the Lg V30?
My man's video roasted Engadget so bad they removed their video from their channel 😂
Apple better pick up their game and make their designs and customization features better
thats why we watch mkbhd instead of paying attention to the press
The only one with the highest score! \nThat makes sense alot of sense...
Yo Marques, whats that bracelet you wear on your hand (the long one, covering your forearm and hand)? Pretty neat
Well benchmark tests are also 1 number so this is pretty much like that. I still use this number to determine if a camera on a phone sux or not
all the dislikes, I didn't even know Engadget had 1000 employees damn
It’s like car brands they want to succeed on the Nurburgring, not on the road .
If I purchase a Cellular Ipad (AT&T)  - will I be able to make and accept phone calls on it through AT&T??
Is the Apple WATCH  LTE WORTH THE EXTRA VERIZON COST?
And it makes sense for it to be a linear thing rather than an out of 100 rating because what if a phone camera from 2011 got a 95 and then in 2017 a phone with a clearly better camera gets a 95 then was there an improvement?
Great insight about DXOMark ratings. Makes me wonder what other ratings these companies are using as a marketing edge.
Consulting for their scoring systems? Clever girl..
Bruh i totally had it with them wack  was phones! Review some more camera's/computers/tech!
This Benchmark isn't the most important
This video is a BIG SLAP to whoever bashing Dxomark ratings (including Google) lol...
Who else went to the DxO website after this?
I really wish they'd put small bezels on the pixel 2 just like the pixel 2 xl
where is the galaxy s7/s7 edge? That should be listed
Much appreciated
Great video!
basically u r telling they r fraud withing saying it.
Good vid
well explained !!
Respect!
nice video bro...........
bujo in the bg. bujo styled dots in the theme 🤔
That's why it's called marketing strategy
I only know who you are, cuz a dude at work recognized a whole bunch of your intro tracks, as music that I play at work.  Now I have a massive hate-on for you, for having early access to Wednesday's track. HOW AND WHY!?! I don't care about your tech reviews...how do you have early access!??!?!!?!??!?!
Quality of these videos are next level.
I Like your videos and all But most of them are about phones. Maybe look at good gaming lapots as I'm looking for one atm
iphone got 2 point less because single camera compare to the Plus, so they are telling that the pixel is a 100 point camera? ahahahah i think they took much much money
One day (God willing)you’re going to walk into Best Buy and see (((“MB”)))certified or reviewed on the box that you’re buying..just watch
Marques is usually so neutral (expect on dear Apple videos), it's funny seeing him go to town on tech press for their clickbait and superficial articles.
One of the best reviews I've watched concerning any aspect of smartphones! And I've watched a thousand of them.
iPhone is nowhere to be seen
You're not gonna get S8 for portrait photos. You're gonna get a proper DSLR for portrait photos. You can't get proper pictures with phones. Instead of buying a $1000 phone for taking pictures, buy a $200 phone and a $800 camera.
marques banging out awesome videos as usual. I remember when you were younger man. Man have you grown as well as your content. and you NEVER sold out :)
Well said! You are really a perfect techTuber I have ever seen! Love u mkbhd❤️!
I'm a sociologist and i found your video kinda awesome in an epistemology and methodology way. I make a lot of researchs in different areas and also work as a consultant for financial entities. Sometimes we have to weight the results in order to achieve a) the measures the universe is suppose to have or b) to put priority on what is important for the client. As a sociologist i know that measures are always artificial and imperfect  but if it is done rigoruosly, and that's the key word, it can help to achieve the objective (not perfect or universal but helpful). We have to understand that we, as humans, can't measure things in a pure objective way, there are always a lot of variables that aren't included in the researchs and the tools we use to measure are relative to our perception. So always grab investigations, researchs or reviews with a grain of salt, or better try to understand how the research was done.
stop it. Get some help 😂😂😂😂😂
Any Nokia android phone review coming ? At least think about it, please:)
i agree with you
It's like the nurburgring ring for cameras. Smh.
Lg 30 has 100..\nBest phone camera yet
Good info
DxOMark is just a number. -Navi Dendi-
Respect.
Great info, easy to get the point and very well presented.
Can u pls review the LG V30 now that the retail version has been released
awesome! Marques
Yesterday I had a weird dream. I dreamt about Marques and I were friends and we had an adventure together. He looked like a brother to me and like someone whom I admire a lot. Then I woke up. What a fucking stupid dream.
One of the best video.... oh wait  it's the best explanation video i have ever seen @Marques
thanks man, you exceed our expectations in neutrality and information
Can you please do Google pixel xl vs Google pixel 2 xl
Can you say lies, more companies just lie cheat and steal, it's rampant! Thanks for exposing them MKB
dude really! respect nowadays people just flow whatever they hear ;) .... keep the great work
Please make a review about L16 *16-lens camera*
Apple has ad marketing that makes chocolate ice cream out of shit. Well maybe not shit but definely not the best product ever!
Getting clicks, marketing hmm....\nThat's how you call making money?
Can you review the lg stylo 3
DxOMark: “Why are you playing us like this MKBHD!? 😩”
The Dxomark site loads like absolute shit. I also don't see LG V30 in their list at all? I can't load the full list so who knows.
I don't know any popular  techtuber who would have the courage to actually make this  video...
DxOMark seems to have found a really sly way to cater the smartphone industry towards their ratings
Thank you for making this video!
nice video
Thank you!
Great...
Cute. YouTuber tries to explain things. Right.
best explanation ever
Just... Wow.
Stay woke
quality of smartphone camera - dxomark\nquality of youtube videos - MKBHOmark
Wait so how much does the red cost and how much does the Pixel 2 cost? All that money for only 10 dxo marks higher? Mind blown
Wow! just awesome facts... great job brother... can't be more specific  and critic about tech news and ratings...
Don't you partner with smartphone manufactures for their reviews?
Which one do u love \nThe galaxy note 8 or Google pixel 2 xl ????
I HATE DxOMark! They are PAID! If a consulting company like this REALLY wants to make a mark (did you see what I did there) then they would do the testing for FREE and make it widely known that they are in no way PAID for doing their testing and reviews and have no affiliation with the manufacturer of ANY item that they test. The LAST place I would go for test results or rating is DxOMark!
Thank you for this Marques!
One of your best videos to date. Keep up the good work.
it is a known well known fact that any number greater than 100 is a violation of the laws of physics and should therefore not be taken seriously.
I need that Alltta song. I can't find it
Jinno plus done
This was very enlightening, great info and video
All hail MKBHD hitting me with the right knowledge.
Ok... So I'm in need of advice,opinions or about anything else you can throw at me! I'm looking for a all around good sounding earbud (earphone) for daily use. I've been debating between A) Shure se250s B) beyerdynamic iDX 200 C) ma750s D) sennhieser momentum E) 1more triple driver... I'm kinda a audiophile (honestly 😉) and so I want the best rounded headphone on all categories without totally busting the bank. If you share my love for music and wanna help me out, everything is appreciated! Y'all have a good day
Very informative 👍🏻👍🏻
it should make sense to most people when they see that a camera strapped to a phone(808) is getting a lower score than yet another iphone
Hahaha that was awesome 108/100
savage level 100 fuck cnet lol
Dope👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Please share your experiences/relationship with alcohol in the comments section below, we'll both be reading them all! xxx
thank you so much girls for talking about such a sensitive subject 💓x
England is the same to be honest. I’m 17 but there are a lot of places that will sell to me and the first time I got drunk was at 14. I don’t have an alcohol problem I just drink at parties and occasions which I think is healthy
I just realized I love Irish girls!
Came from Dom aka the womb  raIDER
I saw a docummentary on Netflix called The truth about alcohol where they said the more muscle you have the higher your tolerance will be so you will need to drink more to get drunk.
I'm currently sober, been so for 4 months! Quit drinking, smoking cigarettes, weed, and doing other drugs since I wanted to become a better person I guess. It's going good, I like it! I started drinking when I was like 14 or something, it seemed so cool! I used to get really drunk, so drunk I passed out, and I enjoyed it. Now I'm 20 year old, I want to live my life to the fullest and I believe I do so (currently) by being sober. I used to always be looking forward to the next party, now I enjoy them but it's not the reason I'm alive if you get me. I sit there with a cup of tea or some water instead  ^-^
Thank you so much for this video Melanie! Absolutely amazing ! The drinking culture in Norway is the same way... a lot of pressure to drink in many situations
It's probably hard to believe, but I'm 27 y.o. Russian (lol, stereotypes) who never tried any alcohol and not going to. I was just never interested and I believe it causes more harm than benefits you.
Last time I got drunk was about a week ago, maybe a little more, I drank so much vodka and whisky that I got alcohol poisoning. I'm such a small person, and once I have a bottle I don't know how to stop. usually. this time I didn't stop and even though people took the last bit I had left, it was too late and I had an awful time and I harmed my body in ways that I don't think anyone should ever expose  themselves to. im not saying drinking is awful , but if you are like me and you do not know how to stop then there is a problem. I don't think I'm an alcoholic but I did have the time to self access and realize I was drinking for very very wrong reasons. I can't say if there are right reasons to drink but I know of people who enjoy it and who can control it and that has to say something about the habit.
I'm Irish... I've grown up with an alcoholic father and put off drinking until my 18th birthday (when I had some West Coast Cooler). I was always afraid of becoming like him so I don't push my limits. I can get a little bit tipsy and then stop, that I'm having a good time but it never gets messy (and no hangovers either). It's only since my younger siblings have grown up that we've been more exposed to his alcoholism and the resulting stigma from the problems he attracts to our house. It's pretty shit! On a different note, I've watched my bf's younger brothers start drinking and secretly drinking since they were 13/14. What is the country coming to?
I watch your videos only because of Irish accent. P.S. your sister doesn't look like a teenage
I don't drink like I've only ever had sips of other people's drinks in my life, I'm going to University soon and I'm scared about how people will treat me
As someone who doesn't drink, has never drank, and doesn't plan on ever drinking(I'm 17, so that might change, but as of now, I don't plan on it), I found this so interesting to watch. My mother and my grandmother were pioneers, and have never drank, and my father is french, so he grew up surrounded by the idea that alcohol is a kind of delicacy. My dad drank from the age of 14, but he never binged on drink/ It was always a glass of wine at the dinner table with my granddad. He often comments on how dangerous the drinking culture is here in Ireland. How, when you turn eighteen, the biggest thing you think of is 'Yes! I can drink now!'. I'm very lucky because I haven't grown up in an environment where drinking is seen as an essential or as something that is part of life, because it doesn't have to be either of those things. Thanks for your insight, I really enjoyed this!!
I live in Australia in a small town just out of Melbourne, I'm 14 and I've never had a drink. A lot people will probably look at that and be like oh thats good and normal. But I can tell you so many people I say that to literally look at me like I'm an alien, where I am it isn't strange for an 11 year old to be drinking, the legal age here is 18 as well and for good reason lol. \nAnyway but when I was twelve I knew kids were dropping out of school because they were drunks and addicts and I mean that was just normal. The adults around me even often try to pressure me into drinking but I just I can't, I think I've seen what its done to those around me and it makes me so bloody anxious, just the thought of drinking gives me so much anxiety its dreadful.
I am from the Netherlands, 21yo. I started drinking at 14.. back then the legal drinking age was 16 (since then it has gone up to 18). I used to binge drink at every party I went to and sometimes we would go into a park at night to drink, so our parents couldn't find out, so not a very safe environment.. I don't think I've ever had a problem with drinking, besides feeling peer pressured into drinking loads at parties. I think when you get frown upon when you don't drink, that is when social drinking stops being fun. I am currently trying to stay sober till christmas, I havent craved any alcohol whataoever and I couldnt care less, but with social gatherings it can get quite hard. Wondering if people can relate?
I never had a drinking problem and the only few times I ever got tipsy was when I just wanted to see what it felt like or because I felt pressured to drink because of other people. But when I get tipsy I always get pretty down and tired. In Germany you can legally drink with 16 and you are able to buy stronger liquor with 18. But I have seen and heard of 12-13 year old kids drinking and I personally got tipsy for the first time with 14. I never thought of drinking in relation to culture, but since we have the Oktoberfest it probably seems to be rooted in our culture.
If I go out with the intent on drinking, I'll go for beer most of the time. I do enjoy vodka and rum too. Not together obviously lol. I have never been drunk in my life. My brother has a dependency on alcohol so after growing up seeing what being drunk did to him, it made me realize I never wanted to feel or be like that. We've tried several different ways to help him. None have worked. Guess you can't help someone if they don't wanna be helped.
First id like to say I love your videos! Im 22 and live in the US. I usually drink maybe one shot of chilled cinnamon whiskey or gold schlager a year maybe...usually around my birthday. My parents always were very open with alcohol around my sister and I. We learned about it early on and how to to be responsible while drinking. I tend to not drink though because when I have drank before my negative emotions came out worse. For example if I was sad the sadness just became more apparent after a little bit of alcohol.
Thanks so much for sharing your experiences! It was really interesting to me, as a teenager who gets a lot of these talks from school and has friends who I know are partying and drinking a lot.\n\nI'm 17 living in California. I'm from a family that discourages drinking, plus my mother and older sisters hate the taste of alcohol. Because of this, I've always been the goody-2-shoes who never drinks. I've mostly been okay with that, until now. I don't always want to be afraid of drinking and never try drinking at all because I'm afraid to get too drunk or binge drink or something. I think I have a healthy relationship with alcohol because I'm so aware of all of this stuff, and I have supportive people in my life. Also, I would never hide my alcohol usage. I would tell my parents, even if they weren't happy with it, and I think that's what matters. So now I want to allow myself to be free and have drinks with friends because I trust myself and the people around me to be aware of how I'm using alcohol and keep it safe and healthy.
I'm not a big drinker really and not bothered about the taste, but if I don't choose alcohol people sometimes get uncomfortable as if I'm therefore judging them.\n\nUK is the exact same. UK and Ireland are the binge drinking capitals of Europe I'm sure. I started drinking at 17.5 and that was LATE. My siblings have all started at about 14.
The one on the left = ♨️
How much is a pint of beer in Ireland? Just out of curiosity because yous mention it's so expensive
This is amazing. Thank you so much for talking about this!!! Also, all I want is to be your friends!!!!
I'm currently in college and drinks are as cheap as €3 for a double vodka!
what do you think of changing he legal age to 16? do you think it would benefit irish teens in a way that they would be safer with it or do you think it would have the opposite effect?
Hi to both of you,\n\nI personally think that the reason countries in the northern hemisphere particularly in Europe drink more because going back a few hundreds years, I believe that we would drink to keep ourselves warm and with English pub history, men would go to work all day (wives at home), then go to the local public house to relax before going home for tea. It's how it was in those days.\n\nFrom my own experience of drinking in England and in a hot country, I could drink the same amount or more but feel in control of myself in a warm country whereas in England, I'd feel ready for home. I think this links between the different environments, haven't quite sussed out the reasoning behind it but there is my theory. \n\nHope this makes sense...\n\nHazel
I think Germany is almost the same (but I also think I don't even have to say that because Germany is pretty popular for their beer and the Oktoberfest and stuff haha) with the drinking, its starts at a really young age, you are allowed beer and wine at the age of 16 and harder drinks at 18 but to be honest loads and loads of young people already drink with 14 (one girl had to get picked up from a halloween party in school when we were like 13 because she had alcohol poisoning!) So yeah, it is pretty bad over here as well but I have to say I grew up in a small village and was never really interested, I never really went clubbing before (I am 19) because I feel uncomfortable around a bunch of strangers being drunk. The only thing I really enjoyed was back when I lived  in Ireland when you go out with a few friends and drink a few drinks, I tend to get sick quite easily but if I drink I LOVE baileys or cider (one of them is called orchard right) ! But else I don't really drink, even when it is very common here in Germany and a huge social thing, if you go out on a weekend you get massively drunk and tell your friends the monday after how fun it was to be that drink (or at least all my classmates do haha)
I'm from the north of England and I feel like the drinking culture here in the UK is pretty much the same as what you've described in Ireland. It here is also a part of the culture, it's a lot more rare to find people who don't drink in my opinion. :p
I'm of Irish heritage in the US (I'm a McD.). I remember as a kid seeing the stereotype of the drunk Irishman and how stupid he was. I went the opposite way. I only have drinks on my birthday (usually 2 margaritas) and none the rest of the year. It's actually really easy to do if you have the right friends. Great video, Melanie and Jessie!
1) U BOTH LOOK HOT\n2) NO REALLY SO HOT\n3) THIS IS IMPORTANT
I’m from Australia and there is a huge drinking culture down here. If you are aged between 15-25 and don’t centre your weekends around binge drinking “you aren’t having fun”. It’s even more prevalent in 18-25,  especially at uni. I don’t like who I turn into when I drink so I stopped at 22. Have felt so much better since.
my biological dad was an alcoholic and even though I havent lived with him since I was 2 I think it's still ingrained in my memory somehow. Ive never been one to drink, Ive gotten tipsy once (I was about 19 at the time). However I can't drink a lot as Ive got epilepsy and drinking too much can trigger them. there is not a lot of drinks I like/will drink but I have started to have a drink now and again, mainly if I go out for a meal or if we have a special occasion, so I feel I have quite a healthy relationship to alcohol in comparison to the majority of people my age (I'm 23)
Us in Scotland have a massive drink  problem too. I am the same as Jess. I drank most at 17 to 18. Now 22 I rarely drink. Drunk stories are funny and scary but it's good to get it out of your system so then you can respect alcohol :).
Im from the uk where binge drinking is also a pretty big problem. I like to drink mainly socially but i know i also have a bad relationship with it where i'll drink on my own in my room because im depressed. So it fluctuates
Le me say this.. I enjoy watching beautiful creatures talking non-stop
I don't drink it makes me so sick straight away not tipsy just so poorly! So just don't bother but I would like to be able to enjoy a few! I think I got out of lots of drink between 16-20 from the sickness the morning after too I would throw up all day long! Xxx
This video came in the right time
I rarely drink now but when I was much younger (14-17) I would drink so much and I think that's why now I just would rather not get drunk. Sometimes I do but as I started drinking so young it's completely put me off 👌🏼
I actually basically don't drink much at all,  when I was younger sure there was a drinking culture when was a teenager in the 80's so its been in OZ for a very long time, I stopped most of my drinking when I had my Kids and Believe it or not lost the taste for alcohol.  I am also a Muso so drinking is pretty standard in my world, however i choose not to drink and don't care what anyone else think.  I also think our drink driving laws in QLD have made a difference to some people as well,  as far as their drinking habits, more people drink before they go out now.   alcohol is expensive and I rather spend my money on other stuff.
Jess your makeup is beautiful. Brings out your natural beauty
I LOVE HOW YOUTUBE KEEP PUTTING YOU AND LUCY INTO TRENDING OMG YAS QUEENS YAS
Melanie, your hair is the epitome of Autumn. I love it!
i come from a family of alcoholics and can honestly say that this is so important and an excellent video- thank you guys for being honest about the effects alcohol dependence can have and these issues!
i rarely drink but when i do it's small amounts with family around the holidays
I'm 15 in the suburbs near chicago in the U.S. I have never drank. my friends don't want to, and neither do I. some people at my school do have drinking parties and shit like that. It just depends on who you are and who you're friends with. There's 2,600 students at my school, so it makes sense why our culture is so varied.
I only drink to savor the flavors. I've never got drunk before. I love nicely brewed beer, tasty wine.... One of my favorites is umeshu (Japanese plum wine).
We definitely have issues with alcoholism here in America. think part of it is the up bringing. Here in the states you can't drink until you're 21 (legally) so most people do a lot of binge drinking when they're young because they aren't 'taught' to drink they're sneaking it. Then another part is maybe the attitude of work and play... Americans are still pretty concerned with 'the American dream most working crazy long stressful days. So to unwind they maybe have a few at the end of the day. So now you drink to relax and have fun. Happy? Drink. Sad? Drink. It's Tuesday? Bottoms up.
The Portuguese have a very similar culture of drinking. The stereotypes are old drunk farmers.\nIn Canada though, the legal age is 19 and places are STRICT about this. \nMy first drink was when I was 14 and from then on I would drink and get plastered at parties occasionally.\nI grew up in a house where my dad was an alcoholic and because of that, I don't have a very good relationship with alcohol. My mom has been afraid I'll be more inclined to that behaviour. I have a low tolerance and I try to stay away from alcohol when I'm sad or lonely because I don't want to indulge those feelings with something that can really harm me. My friends binge drink a lot and I actually had a discussion with a few of them and it's scary. \nWhat were you parents like about you both drinking?
Why do you drink in the first place if you believe it harms you?
I am from Spain. We start drinking early, my first drink was when I was 13. I have drank a lot in my life, I am 30 now, but this year I have started to quit. I would have maybe two or three beers when I go out but that's it. I can't deal with the shame, the anxiety and the hungover anymore. But the pressure even from friends is huge.
I started drinking just before I was 16 and that was 100% my choice. Like a lot of people have said in Australia we have such a similar situation with alcohol where there are 15 year olds getting drunk and tbh it’s not right in a way but it all comes down to the person, if they want to get drunk at 15 they can have that choice to do it
Not even on my 21st birthday did I drink. I've never had alcohol and don't really plan to. I'm just not interested. What bothers me is how people react when you simply don't drink. Its like people need a reason as to why you don't. I remember going to a bonfire when I was 18 with my new college classmates. One of the girls I was hanging out with asked me if I wanted a drink. I told her no, I didnt drink. When she asked why, I told her, My uncle had liver failure when I was 15. It put me off alcohol. She said she respected that but proceeded to go on about how she thought people that don't drink for no reason are f***ing losers. My uncle did have liver failure but I hate that I feel compelled to use that to get people to leave me alone about alcohol. Alcohol is a personal choice. Drink if you want to, don't drink if you don't want to. Lets respect everyone's choice :) love this series. Love you Mel. Love you Jess 💚💚💚
I'm from Germany and I started drinking and binge drinking with 14. I don't know why, I think I just wanted to distract myself from my problems. I am 16 now and I actually don't drink that much anymore but I still can't control myself when it comes to drugs. I wish people would talk more openly about drug abuse instead of romanticizing it
I just saw this vid and its funny because i have been hanging all day because last night I went to a party and normally im not that bad drunk but i was sloppy and kissing people i shouldn't have and alcohol is such a depressant for me and raises anxiety so much that i was crying in a car park for over an hour... but i kind of know my limit but all my friends were drinking loads so i did and its so unhealthy :(
Both looks so good in this!! The natural makeup looks so amazing on Jess!😍
I rarely ever drink only on occasions. I like being in control of myself haha I get drunk so easily too 😂😂
Thank you for talking about this, my mom passed away this year due to an alcohol addiction so I've never really had a good relationship with alcohol. I've done all the things you've said; been out binge drinking then not remembering then things I'd done then next day. Moms addiction made me see alcohol in a different light, it went on for over ten years and destroyed her life. It can be so dangerous! I would never tell people not to drink as I still drink every now and then (not currently cos I'm pregnant!) but my eyes are so open to the dangers xoxo
I didn't start drinking until I was 19 due to both my parents having somewhat unhealthy relationships with alcohol as I was growing up, and I think I'm glad I waited. I'm from the US but studied at a uni in the UK for a year and also worked in a pub after and personally enjoyed the binge drinking culture. Not that I think it's positive overall, but for me I knew I didn't like the idea of drinking everyday and letting it become habitual, but having one night every couple of weeks when my friends and I would get kinda messy was actually really cathartic for me (I can be pretty anxious otherwise) and there were only a few times that I ever regretted it. Fortunately I'v never turned to alcohol as an escape, and I can see how those habits plus a heavy drinking culture can be a harmful combo. Now I'm back in the US I very rarely drink. I feel there's much more judgement around it here, like people are quick to hand you a beer but also quick to tell you that you're too drunk and should be ashamed a few hours later (not so much from personal experience as observations of others). Plus you have to drive everywhere, and I'm small enough that even one strong drink could put me over, which really limits options for social drinking.
Where is Jessie's top from? It is absolutely adorable !💛
The reason why these bad things happen when you drink alcohol, is because it's a warning, God doesn't want you to drink it! Well why did He create it then? To test you, what do you love more? Him or the demon drink?
I rarely drink, but I usually only have fun and am in control of myself at all times so I think I'm okay :-) However in my teens I think I really had a problem... In school, I remember all I could think of was the next party and the next time I would get to drink... It was bad, and also dangerous! I'm glad I met someone who hated drinking at the time. They distracted me away from it. I'm very thankful about that :-)
Tbh, I think in Spain we have a very close drinking culture and we definitely binge drink while being young. Like you said, alcohol here it's quite cheap and accesible and it's common for very young people to start drinking and even binge drinking. Also since we party until so late in the morning, i feel like we drink more to stay high all night and it can get pretty unhealthy easily. I feel like a lot of us can't party without drinking (or withouth getting drunk) and it's a bit dangerous.
I sort of disagree with what you were saying about spanish drinking culture, amongst teenagers at least, it's really bad. I am a teenager in southern spain. The alcohol is so cheap and basically everywhere will serve people who are very underage. I have been served since I was 13 years old in shops,pubs, clubs etc. I know lots of teenagers who have issues with drinking. Including myself, I had a terrible year when I was just 15 where I was binge drinking heavily and I wouldn't remember any of the stupid terrible things I had done. I have noticed though that it is mostly us foreign kids, British, Russian, American etc who have the issues and not the spanish which is interesting... People here as young as twelve go out drinking and when it gets to the age of about 14/15 everyone in the year group starts going out, it's ridiculous honestly.
I'm Dutch, 23 years old. I've never had a bad relationship with alcohol, but I know teenagers are still drinking up to a point that they get into a coma. Some real alcohol-poisoning...\nI myself rarely drink and when I drink, I don't drink a lot. I drink because I like the taste of some alcoholic drinks, not to get drunk or tipsy. I usually drink no more than about 4 glasses of alcohol on an evening and I like to mix it up with regular drinks in between.
I don't drink alcohol at all these days - less than one drink a week. I had to stop completely two years ago (back injury - painkillers that react badly with alcohol) - but even back at university, I tended not to drink much normally. There was the occasional night of heavy drinking, of course, and a night or two I regret now, but I don't think I'll ever drink that way again.
I'm 17 and from Greece, although I was born in England and have also lived in Ireland and in my opinion what contributes to all this binge drinking in the U.K. and Ireland is the taboo that surrounds alcohol and peoples attitudes towards it. Like, in Mediterranean countries alcohol really isn't a big deal and children are exposed to it from a young age, usually through their parents/grandparents. My parents always let me taste their drinks and we talked open.y about drinking and so now, most of my friends and cousins who come from similar backgrounds mainly just have a drink or two when we go out to bars and get maybe tipsy at parties, just bc they like the taste (I don't drink). Also where I live now, in Cyprus, he drinking age is 17 but anyone at any age can pretty much buy alcohol and be served at bars and it's not an issue and I think that's a good thing bc teenagers will drink anyway might as well do it responsibly and in a chill way
Jessica looks so much like Amanda Peet in Something's Gotta Give. If you look up that movie and see pics of Amanda Peet in it let me know if you agree lol
I’m from Slovakia, alcohol is very cheap around here and almost everybody drinks so so much. It’s just normal. Nobody thinks it’s unhealthy and I just don’t like it. We shouldn’t have this as a norm.\nSaying that I do/did have an unhealthy relationships with alcohol. I started very young around 11/12 and I was binge drinking cheap hard liquor few times a week to run away from depression than I thankfully got treated and got drunk only once in a while in parties and the I stopped all together for a while. Now I only drink wine most of the time, i’ll have a glass with dinner or get tipsy but that’s it. Saying that I know I’m lot more sociable person when drinking and that’s why I often drink when in uncomfortable situations. I get a lot more friendly, happy and communicative..
I drink but only occasionally and when I do it's in a chill environment at my house or with my friends eating a meal. The last time i drank was about 3 weeks ago and before then maybe a month. I'm also quite a lightweight so the most I'll ever drink is 2. Another reason I don't drink often is mostly because of price so when I buy myself alcohol it's easier to get whatever wine I like at the grocery store that's on discount. however, when I've traveled to other countries I drank more often because it was part of the culture and much more chill and normalized than here in the states.
From England (but Irish family) and my bad years were 15/16 maybe 18 but now I never drink. 21 and have not been drunk in years!
Thank you so much for this video Mel. Looking back, when I was 17/18 I had such an awful relationship with drink. I'm only after realizing that after watching this video. For me, it was because of a bad break up aswell. I just had it in my head that I needed to go out and get locked and have 'fun' to make it seem like I wasn't hurting. I didn't want to come across weak so I wouldn't miss a single party. I would drink a 70cl (nearly a liter) of Lidl vodka at house parties and I got alcohol poisoning a couple of times. I would also mix this with taking drugs/smoking weed. It was so unhealthy and like the girls, I put myself in some extremely dangerous situations. Today, I still love a drink but do it very rarely, once every couple months probably, and stay far away from drugs. I'll never go back to that place, it was an awful time and really enhanced the symptoms of depression and anxiety I was feeling at the time. If alcohol wasn't such a huge part of Irish culture, I would probably give it up all together.
i think the drinking culture in england is much the same--especially at university age. i basically don't drink at all, i don't like the taste of it and i rarely feel safe drinking it in a party situation. but i don't think i'd be wrong when i say the majority of university students have a drinking problem. i've watched people move in first year, acting like childish sixth formers, going out every. single. night. and come year three, they're still doing the exact same thing, and surviving on no sleep so they can still pass their classes. i genuinely think a lot of people our age feel like to have a good time you need to drink, not just drink, but do it to excess. it's literally all they talk about. and people are so cruel and pressurising about it--myself and my flatmates were having a game night where we played cards, had a small amount of alcohol each but not drunk, and had a laugh. a friend of theirs dropped by, and they introduced a debilitating drinking game which meant consuming an ungodly amount as quickly as possible, and i felt so uncomfortable. i remember saying 'i'm just gonna drink water' for the challenge of 'downing your whole glass if you lose this round' kinda deal. their response was 'no you HAVE to drink'.... of course i didn't cus fuck that, but see what i mean? it kinda destroyed the night for me and became quite depressing living in constant fear that i might intake too much. if the behaviour of young students in britain were seen in middle aged adults, it would no doubt be alcoholism, so why is it so passable when we're young when it negatively affects you just as much?
I live in Portugal and the drinking culture is quite different from Ireland. I would say most people drink, but few binge drink. Most adults have one or two glasses of wine or beer at dinner but no more than that, maybe a gin or whiskey in a speacial occasion. For us teens though, it's so easy to get alcoholic drinks, almost everyone from 14 up does it. Bars sell drinks to anyone, no IDs requested, no question asked. So a lot of us start drinking early and at 17/18, you're an exception if you haven't already been drunk/binge drink.
The legal drinking age where I live is 14 with parental supervision and 16 for everything expect liquors. I started drinking when I was 15 but that was just on some parties and I didn't drink much. I rarely drink at all now just when I go out with friends I'll have a few drinks but in my friend group it isn't common to drink a lot so we can also just go out and not drink anything. Also I feel it when I start getting tipsy and then I'll just stop drinking and drink some water...
I'm 26 and I moved to England three years ago. I'm from France and before moving here, I had never touched a drink, never. I started drinking here as I felt completely out of place when going out with people. Over time though, I didn't feel pressured anymore however I would keep binge drinking because I just can't face the idea of socialising sober. I got very drunk last night not because I enjoy it but because I'm way too anxious to be around people without it. I don't find it fun to poison myself but I have to if I don't want to stay isolated at home.
I am a 19 year old Irish person and I don't drink; I am the only person that I know of my age that doesn't  (except one friend for healthy reasons, she can't). Primarily because of the fear of it leading to alcoholism because that is such a strong feature in Irish culture and in my family in particular, so I have avoided it. I also have just never been that interested in it and have always seen only the bad from it and heard bad about it from people who continuously drink heavily. I feel I don't need it either though because I experience that feeling of a buzz just from the energy of others like ye were talking about, I get in the spirit of drunk but feel that I do not need alcohol to assist me to get there.
I'm an Irish 22 year old and I've never had a drop of alcohol and I don't plan to. I hate it when I meet people on a night out and they ask what I'm drinking and I say a coke or something they automatically assume that either A) I'm pregnant (which I'm not) or B) that I used to have a drinking problem (which I haven't). When I tell them that I've never had alcohol they all go Fair play to ya or they look at me like I've got ten heads! Last year I was out with my older brother and his friends at his birthday party in a pub/nightclub in Dublin and when I told when of his friends that I don't drink he literally started to question me for the next 45 MINUTES! He was in shock that I never had some cider down the park when I was younger. Also, as a student living away from home for the first time in a different city, I find that I'm not invited out with my friends from college because they automatically assume that I don't like pubs or clubbing. I'm half Irish, half English I LOVE going down to the pub and having the laugh with my friends! Just because I don't drink doesn't mean that I don't like going out with friends on a night out. I find it really sad that we have such a big alcohol problem in Ireland and no, neither of my parents are alcoholics. The reason why I choose not to drink is A) It's WAAAY to expensive! I'm a broke ass college student! B) I don't need it to have fun. Also I'd like to say that no, I don't shame my friends for drinking or anything like that. If they want to drink, let them drink! Rant over.
When I was younger I thought the German drinking culture was bad...then I spend some time at a British Uni and now I think differently. I know people who sometimes get quite drunk, but not too many. I rarely drink. When I do it is usually a drink or two at a bar with friends, very rarely I get a bit tipsy before going out. I like the taste of some alcoholic beverages, especially cocktails, but I also get a bit sick of the taste quite quickly, so drinking a lot wouldn't be easy for me anyway. I also never felt the need to. Most of my good friends don't drink that much and even if I am at a party where people are drinking, I just stop when I feel like I don't want to drink anymore. It is sad that you then sometimes have to justify yourself for not drinking. I also find it shocking when I hear people as young as 18 say that it would be a challenge for them to abstain from drinking for a month. I really have nothing against a bit of social drinking, but I find it disconcerting how something as harmful as alcohol plays such a big role in society.
I live in portugal (which is in the top 20 countries with the most alcohol consumption; legal drinking age - 18)  and I am 16. I can't even count how many times I've gotten  like really fucking drunk. Around my circles of friends it's pretty normal. I've bought alcohol as a 15 year old. It is not allowed but I did it in a self-service place and loads of more local/small shops sell you if you don't look too young, without carding ya. My father incourages me to drink (not the way I do), but since I was little he'd let me drink from his glass. I don't think that had to do with how I came to drink more heavily but idk just thought i'd share that. It´s not just drinking, I don't think I've gone to a party where there wasn't any weed and some other shit. Everytime we're going out it's always with the minset of like let's get fucked. BUT besides that I don't really drink by myself, I don't really feel the need to. And I've never got drunk to solve any problems, it's always been in good fun, I guess. Plus I somehow have never gotten a bad hangover and haven't had any too bad experiences with it, so it has never been a problem for me. the worst that's happened was not enjoying the party cause I was passed out. \n(We mostly drink vodka but anything will do really, also alcohol is really cheap  €6 for a bottle of vodka black for example.)
I'm 15 and have never had any alcohol (other than a glass of prosecco sometimes at family dinners), and have been in quite a few situations where most people are drinking but me. As I have a lot of friends who are older than me (around 18-20), I am generally one of the only ones who is sober. I don't mind not being drunk but I do feel a bit left out, although I've never really had the urge to drink.
in sweden binge drinking is also prevalent. like, we don't drink during the week but then on the weekends and holidays p much everyone drinks. the socialising culture is centered around drinking much, but at least it is a bit more restrictive in stores and like i started drinking at 16 and i think that's pretty common.
Great video by the way. Generally hearing about hangovers reminds me of shitty times but this video was spot on. Keep it up!
When I started drinking I drank very little but when I got 16 it became really bad because I had problems and started binge drinking to forget about them and even if I still had a hangover I couldn`t wait till the next party. \nI did some really stupid and dangerous things while drunk because I didn´t care about anything anymore, like walking on the quay wall and jumping out of a window or stuff like that and I got drunk because I really desperately needed to talk to somebody about my problems but couldn´t do so sober. I always drank on an empty stomach like not haven eaten for 12 hours (I ate very little at that time because I was really down). One time at a party I got really really drunk to the point where I was nearly unconscious and they had to call my parents because it was so bad and I didn´t even recognise my own father. On the next day I didn´t even have a hangover because I puked everything out that was in my stomach. \nBut I had a total blackout and could only remember little bits from a certain point on. \nSince then I have been drunk a few times but I don´t drink as often anymore, mostly because I don´t want my friends to have to look after me when I get really depressed and do stupid shit or when I puke and stuff.  I hope I wont get that bad again but at the moment things aren´t really going too well, so I´ll see, but I´ve learned a few things since then.\nI also always get really depressed the day after.\n\nIn Switzerland you can buy beer etc. when you´re 16 and vodka etc. when you´re 18, but of course most people drink the heavier things before they´re 18.\nBinge drinking is also quite common here but it´s also common to just get a bit tipsy or not even that, it really depends on the occasion. In my city it´s also very common to smoke weed. There´s a quay where all the pubs and bars are and if you get there you can always smell the weed XD. It´s not that everyone smokes weed, but a lot of people do it and they don´t really hide it that much (even though it´s illegal). I know people who have an alcohol problem but I also know people who have a problem with weed (like 3 joints a day, which is just too much regularly).\nI think that most people here are generally quite tolerant if someone doesn´t drink but of course there´s still a lot of people who will make stupid comments etc.\n\nI forgot about fairs where after a certain time just everybody is completely smashed. (also about 40ish/50ish adults)
There's 13/12 year olds in my school getting drunk  at party's and drinking in school and I always get weird stares when I get offered a drink and I say no cause I don't want to drink yet X
I'm Spanish and people start drinking also at very young ages and without any control. But once you're an adult I'd say they usually just drink some beers or wine (or whatever) whenever you feel like it?\nI started drinking when I was almost 18 and that's really weird. I wouldn't really go to clubs or anything bc being there from 1 am to 8 am and sober wasn't ideal... At the beginning I just couldn't understand why anyone would drink, but I feel like in the end it was just to make me feel special. And nowadays I drink when I feel like having a beer or when my friends and I meet to have a coffee or so in the evening. I guess I'm just lucky I don't wanna spend my money in alcohol, I hate spirits and I don't enjoy clubs. \nI wouldn't say I've had a problem with alcohol, but when one of my exboyfriends broke up with me (without telling me a clear answer) and his grandma and father died of cancer I went a bit wild. Once I even went to the cemetery to drink and draw... But all I did was really sporadic and just my way to seek for attention and try to keep myself busy. \n\n\nAnd yeah, they say in the northern countries people drink so much more, and that in the south we have more prostitution... 🤷🏿‍♀️\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Beer's amazing. Especially Belgian beer.
Hi :) I'm from belfast,  started drinking at 13/14 a lot, but when I hit 18 I had no interest in it at all, now at 24 I don't drink, maybe the odd cocktail on holidays but that's it! Completely Agree the culture here is crazy!
So glad I can across this video. I've had a bad year with alcohol and it also kicked off with relationships ending. If I have a bad day or feel stressed I do turn to wine and often don't know when to stop. I'll have a glass of wine and then want another, and another and cannot tell what is too much. I also have the same bad relationship with pizza, on bad days I want to buy pizza and have wine but just because I think I will feel better. This video has made me so much more aware of my alcohol consumption and why I turn to drink. Loved this video and you guys are awesome
Watching this before a night out😂
never drank alcohol and don't plan to especially after seen my dad drunk
I'm German :) And we can buy beer with 16 and the hard stuff with 18. Now I know a lot of teens start with 14/15 when they are hanging out with their friends. Some just drink beer while they hang out, some choose like harder stuff. It really depends. For me, I HATED alcohol up until I was 17 I think and I've never really drank I guess. Now, 21, I do drink, a might get drunk here and there but in a moderate manner. But I am a lightweight so I do have to be really careful with the 'let's have a bottle of beer or a glass of wine while we talk'. But yeah. When we have social gatherings we usually pop a few bottles of beer :)
Legal drinking age in Germany starts at 14 for beer, champagne and wine with parental permission.\n16 and up: beer, champagne and wine without parental permission.\n18 and up: all other alcoholic beverages (without parental permission of course)\nOur laws are designed to teach kids and teenagers a healthy approach to alcohol and it works according to the statistics :)\nI started drinking when I was 14 and never had a bad relationship with alcohol. Coming from a small village, I drink quite frequently but alcohol abuse is very uncommon between my friends because we learned from the beginning what influences our body and mind in which way. xx
I find alcohol such a tricky one because I personally can always choose to stop or not drink so I would never say I'd had a problem with it, but, I just love drinking? 😂 especially at uni (I'm in 3rd year) there's just opportunities to binge drink with friends every other bloody night and obviously, it's so unhealthy, but just no one questions it because everyone's getting drunk 3/4 times a week
If you are interested on the differences between Northern European and Mediterranean drinking cultures, you should read 'Social and Cultural Aspects of Drinking' by the Social Issues Research Centre (1998). I wrote an essay on the topic and it is super interesting! Greetings from a Spaniard in England x
I did the bulk of my drinking when I was 15. I would have only a couple of drinks then I would turn into a completely different person. Violent. Angry. The worst part was I couldn’t remember anything I had done past the first few drinks. I made the decision aged 16 not to drink anymore. I’m now 24 and haven’t touched a drop since making that decision. I’m from Wiltshire in the UK.
This 👌🏼❤️
💚💚💚
I am hangover rightnow
In England it's also terrible!! I am 17 now and my friends at my school and even myself started heavily and I mean heavily drinking at 13, every single weekend. I know I'm my self have become very dependent on my self with alcohol, I don't wanna go out at all without it or did when growing up. It does take a massive hold on your life and I wish I wasn't addicted as I am now , but I don't fucking love it at the same time .
I feel like binge drinking is a massive issue in UK university culture. In my first year at uni I drank far too much for my size to try and keep up with all the guys around me and to overcome shyness. What made that worse was that I never ate before I drank. \nAlcohol itself causes your blood sugar levels to drop, and as mine were already low I experienced symptoms of Hypoglycaemia - aggression, confusion, personality change, pale skin and I would have mornings where I would wake up with no memory of even leaving home and drinking at all...\nThe complete lack of memory is the scariest part. For that reason, I've given up drinking - because unfortunately I know that Im still not in the right mental state to have full control over it and maintain a level of moderation.
The people on Hollywood know about all the sex and pedophilia and didn't do shit. Screw them all

This comment section is fucking disgusting. Can none of you scrotum licking cuntshits not think of ANYTHING to call people than 'faggot' 'nigger' and 'feminist'? Go back to licking Trump's anus.
with jews, you lose. Non jews are literally referred to as cattle (goyim). Chief Rabbi of Israel Ovidi Yosef, The only reason to keep non jews alive is because they are donkeys meant to serve the jews. Had a million jews attend his funeral.
Just makes you wonder if an actress got to where they are on their own merits or because they conformed to the Casting Couch!!!   How embarrassing for someone like Ashley Judd to make an ass out of herself calling Trump out for something WAYYYYYY LESS disgusting than what this PIG did to so many women.   Amazing how many twisted women like Meryl Streep continued to praise and bow down to this Nasty Creep, KNOWING his reputation with women and perhaps her own experience with him.

All hilarys friends are rapists... And now we know why hollywood wanted her in the white house.
Fox news is full of rapists and sexual harassers, but no one said anything for years until the final lawsuit came out.\n\nThe president has been accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and rape, yet we reward him by giving him the highest appointment in the land.\n\n\nStop acting like this is some Hollywood oddity. This isn't a problem that is unique to one industry or country. Everyone has to face it and come to terms with it  to come up with a solution. At least the much maligned mainstream media is talking about it and not down playing it like every right wing news organisation does about the Trump, or Fox News stories. Accountability isn't only exclusive to the left.

Come on man, it was all just lock room talk.
But no one knew right meryl streep?
Seems more an acknowledgement that he knew it was happening and believed that these women were the types to give it up and is the reason they got their parts.\n\nHe almost seemed to shame the women instead of harvey lol
I had the best advert ever, 2 African kids wanting money for food,1 other African man with money says no,he drops the money,the kids steal the money and buy food,the rich man starves to death
Liking a place you live has something to do with how people in that society treats you. I am a taxi driver in Toronto, this person who got inside my taxi seems like a setup. It seems like someone already pin point my taxi cab number to verbally attack me. Someone backstabbing me using different people. He was swearing and insulting about different nationalities. Also, saying how he hates different nationalities. They were laughing loud inside my cab making me uncomfortable and finally one person started to verbally attack me. All three of them spoke Arabic language and they claim that they were from Kuwait.  I do not support any movements or individuals who are a threat to someone else freedom and existence. I came to this country to live in peace and without discrimination or harassment. After been unemployed for 6 years, this is what I am getting? I don't have the freedom to work without harassment nor freedom to live without others interference. How do you expect me to like the place I live? Lastly, I didn't come to this country to live a poor miserable life, I came to this country to live well so does everybody else. I am not a high school or university drop out nor a low street rowdy who speaks shit with the rotten personality.
There is something about Seth's expression at the end that is oddly reminiscent of Bill Burr.
Seth's look at the end says: Yeah, you guys laugh it up, but you know it's true.
He knew and kept his mouth shut
so basically this'll blow over in a few years and Weinstein gets the last giggity?
And Hollywood dares to take the moral high ground by protesting against Trump and preaching feminism, while knowingly turning a blind eye to this behaviour. They're femininsts and social justice warriors when it suits them and they have something to gain. Absolute hypocrites with no standards
And you people kept watching the shit that Hollywood makes and you call them “real movies”
Funny how everyone seems to think this Harvey thing will help put an end to the sickness that is Hollywood....ahhh no it won't,because you same people still buy and watch their garage....iam proud to say i don't....its all shit.Even if Harvey does properly go under theres just another sick pedo to take hos place and you can bet on that.Fuck Hollywood hey!!
She's so ugly
Using the full range of MacFarlane expressions. Both of them. I mean, have you SEEN The Orville.
unbelievably sad that it's so normalized that they are joking and laughing about it. it's one coping mechanism to deal with the vile industry they are a part of.
Alex Jones was right. What now bitches?

I mean 4 years ago we had YouTube. Yet this was never in news! Thanks to Wikileaks and people who are leaking hidden secrets.
I wanted to know who won bro
Weinstein been doing this kind of thing for years yet nobody, including and especially the women said shit because it might have affected their careers negatively, so they played the game. Hardly a position deserving of sympathy.
This proves that Weinstein's behavior was well-known in Hollywood. Nobody spoke up about rape because they're all profiting from keeping their mouths shut. They're all complicit.
And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  Matthew 5:30\nAnd if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  Matthew 18:9
Insert Morgan Freeman 'he's right, you know' meme here
They laugh because they all knew, but since Seth is a creator he has the balls to say it. Other actors are worried about losing their jobs so they stay silent. They knew...
The look on his face. He fucking meant it.
In the end he’s like “Yea I’m joking but.. come on..”
People on here seem surprised that Hollywood is full of hypocrites and fakes.They're actors for crying out loud. They are professional fakes. It has been well known for at least 25 years what that perv was doing. Everyone turned a blind eye until it was made public.Now they all come out and tell us how surprised and disgusted they are. Actors are the most useless people on the planet. Got the shits? Call a doctor. Leaky tap? Call a plumber. Dodgy hair? Call a hair dresser. Persistent boner? Call a hooker. There is no possible scenario that could occur in everyday life which would require you needing an actor. They're fucking useless.
We've stayed silent until now. We feared. We were threatened. We needed to rebuild our lives. But we can no longer sit back and let the monsters who sexually assaulted women and raped girls to roam free. Please check out famous actress Kate del Castillo movie about her abuse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOX3tjTVgQc
This harvey weinstein is your typical kike sheeny yid piece of shit!  He should be thrown in a concentration camp and be rapped in all holes until he dies from it!
I'll rape dat
Seth MacFarlane = Dillion Harper
Good
SMH
GOOD ONE, SETH MacFARLANE!!!! #LOL
All go checkout my channel :)
Hahahaha yeah dude, he knew man, he sure showed Harvey! hahahaha\n\nPure idiocy.
yikes
Harvey Swinestein!
Dark shit
*Videonun Perde Arkasi* http://youtubem.video?1OwdF267pI79h8tS=VVuGEVkGtYgkbwA
made in usa
Yet Hollywood claimed they knew nothing....nothing.
OMG called it!
heez a purve
GODDAMN thats not a burn, thats a fucking NUKE lol
Oh boy
U guys should watch open secret documentary...Harvey is harmless compare to these guys
I'll suck Harvey's dick for an oscar
Lol i drink fluoride aswell.
He Knew
Weinstein is a victim of Jewish Hollywood infighting,he must of upset some powerful members of his Tribe and they are simply settling scores.
*Emma Stone looked like she wanted to laugh at the dig but still had to be careful for her career...* What a vile industry!
Ooooooh
Wow
They knew Harvey was a perv but nobody dared do anything
The Chosen People had to much Shekels
I think I am starting to finally get that Family Guy scene where Peter takes Stewie to Disney World and Stewie gets captured by the “it’s a small world” ride people and made to in there as a slave with the other children from around the world. I had no clue at the time what the scene was about until I saw it again at a friends house here over the weekend. Jeezo, we spoke about it and prayed that we are still just guessing at its meaning, but the scene now seems creepy second time around ....
I will fight sexual abuse with women every step of the way but women have to do their part as well. First start off by NOT wearing yoga pants 365 days a year everywhere - to hospitals, schools, stores, out and about. The crutch of freedom of expression and comfort has been broken, you cannot tell me you will walk out in public wearing white/grey/tan/green yoga pants with your cameltoe hanging in broad daylight and tell me you are doing it for comfort and NOT for attention. Start respecting yourself before expecting others to respect you. A grown fucking woman should know better!
Why do people applaud this? It was common knowledge for people in Hollywood to know Harvey was a beast, everyone knew. Seth isn't calling Harvey out hes making fun of what Harvey does to woman. Does Seth look serious? No. He told a sick joke and expected everyone to laughed at it like they did. Everyone in the room knows about Harvey and they still laughed including Seth smh. Seth never reported Harvey to the authorities so i wouldn't say he called him out.
He made a joke about it, then never mentioned it again, so you can tell he was serious about pursuing justice.
One of the creepiest aholes in the business, called out the soon to be retired, creepiest guy in the business. Sounds like someone wanted Harvey's spot.
So Seth McFarlane like most of Hollywood knew this was going on and instead of using his power and influence to do something instead  made a cheep in joke about it at a ceremony. What a fucking hack piece of shit douche bag
hey that guy sounds like the dog off family guy hohoho
I'm glad that Seth took a swing at Weinstein and can see in his facial expression the disgust he has for him.
Does anyone know if Harvey Weinstein was in attendance at the Oscars that year? I know he usually attends. I would of paid big money to see his reaction... 😂😂😂
It's been an open secret for some time now.
Everybody knows it too.
I love Seth.... Marry me.☺️😍💕
Called him out; or knew and didnt say anything about it publicly -.-? Just saying.
I don't need another Soulsavers album with Dave, I want new electro project with him !!! This song is simply perfect.
Just what I needed on a Friday night! Does anybody hear this man singing? His voice is mesmerizing!
OmG💙 Gahan one of the most beautiful voices ever !
Best DM song in years!! Ops... :D
Holy shit, how fucking good was that.
Fucking amazing. Dave still got it.
DAVE GAHAN is a music god, a champion with no one else in his league! Just as good with his solo projects as with Depeche! He's the best!
Great song!
Fantastic!
Perfect! Thanks Kurt+Dave+Tim Team
Perfecto love this song 🤙🏻👌🏻
Отлично, Дэйв!!!
Awesome!
Reminded to “Suffer Well”
matrix
Put Gore behind and you have the Depeche from 87-89-93. Sounds really great and very well produced!
I am really really loving this! Its sounds a bit like Black Celebration era Depeche Mode!
Wow wow wow!!! I can't explain how he makes me feel amazing vid so electronic beautiful mind blowing.They've done a great job together long live Dave & electronic music!!!
dave's divine voice kills me 💙
Dave could sing the ABC Song with this soft voice and it would sound sexy to me...wonderful song...pure electronic 🎹
so beautiful. love it. thank u.
Fantastic ...Dave's voice is like a dream...music is so good and deep. A perfect collaboration. It's make you travelling in your mind and soul....Thank you for moving us so much
The best song of '17 until now
great  track, that  woman  is  really   Tall..  niice
perfect description and personal evaluation...very successful,both the video,and the lyrics...❤️👑🖤
What the sound, what the powerful song was this. It will be becoming more popular  than i think.
just he voice dave it's so so nice
Dave could sing every song and make it famous and wonderful.. but his best is ONLY with Depeche Mode... from 1981 to 2017...
Oh Dave oH Dave   i 'll be waiting you
Your words were spoken Carefully chosen For me Each one a msg And insight To some degree   When I wake up My eyes are open I can see I can hear you All around me I feel free   There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through   Why am I nervous My hands they're shaking My heart it beats Your specter haunts me And taunts me I can't breathe   When I wake up My eyes are open I can see I can feel you All around me I can breathe   There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through   We're moving on We're moving on
I loved them a long time ago but fuck me! As pretentious and as same as an album full of DM songs as you are ever going to find.😴
This sounds like a B side from the SOTU record that should've been the first single 😐😧😳SHEEEEEEZE that was good
What's the matter with all these morons commenting on Dave's demonic side because of the video??!!? Are you f..ing crazy?? 1) Dave has nothing to do with the concept of the video 2) his voice is a gift from God for all of us who have a soul 3) with what he's been through, no one - NO ONE - has any right to comment on his personal life 4) anyway, WHO CARES about moral implications??? Just listen and appreciate the music for what it is. Long Live Dave <3 And thax Kurt!
Amazing! Dave should be the front. It’s different then Depeche Mode by tons. This is the future
is it trevor or something
Sounds like real synthy Depeche Mode, but here is very feeble non-catching refrain.
Electronic Music brought me here ✨
Masterpiece guys ! This is it !!!
wow amazing song with felling dark i love
This Sound is very deep. \nThe Beat is very dark.  \nSometime we need dark and deep things in our Lifes.  \nBut if you sell yourself into the Darkness, you will never be the same Person anymore. It's your Choise, when you even sell your whole body and soul to the Darkness. Sorry Dave Gahan, but this is not my music and not my World. Satanic, Diobolic, whatever. Not every deep music is so dark like this Song, but l will only listen to the beauty of music itself. You have dissapointed me.
What a magical Song!! Kurt Uenala and Dave Gahan are a wunderful Team for pure electronic music
and THIS is what I expect DM music to sound like. perfect electronic stuff!
I have an absolute obsession with this song, I have no words  awesome
Great! I would like to be the deep underwater dancer for the next Dave Gahan video!!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coh2Pwj6H6k
I just love it!!!!!!
Absolut Perfect voice of Electronic music
gorgeous and very sexy melody to this! i just saw depeche mode at the hollywood bowl and this fulfils my post concert sadness lol great stuff :)
I really love this track. If I didn't know I could have sworn that this is a Depeche Mode single!! So good absolutely!!
Love it Dave Gahan  the master voice.
Pretty nice and peaceful song. Especially the voice of Dave Gahan too, makes this even better 🎶
I love Dave Gahan and the versatility of his deep dark Baritone 😍. However, i do not like the video at all (saved only by the shots of Dave himself) . Disturbing....but not in a good way. I shall just close my eyes and listen............
love at first sight. :)
why not in the spirit album?
Spectacular video, I love it, and well Dave, as always so flawless, is a pleasure to hear ... and watch it .... @ beautiful!
Они не умеют делать плохую музыку и все тут! - They can't make a bad music and thats all! 
Красота!
INTRYGUJĄCE , \nA ZARAZEM PIĘKNE ...
Sends chills down my spine
Dave's damn sexy voice!!!
ME ENCANTA !!
Excelente 😁
Incredible!
New songs​, eletro pop, synth pop.
Beautiful song
The outro is perfect...great !!!
Sweet !
wonderful
Good sound
Fantastic Sounds !
Excelente, la voz de Dave exquisita y sensual y la música oscura pero muy fresca. Me encantó más que los singles de spirit
ДЭЙВ РУУУЛИИИТТТ!!!!!
Очень похожа на Precious! Luxury music.
KOOL!
peccato per un video cosi' fuori luogo e truce
Love it ....
Very nice indeed!
Neo noir atmosphere.
Impresionanteeeee!!!!!!! ♡
♡
Nice job. Perfect
Veľmi profesionálne spravene👍
Very Good!
Świetny kawałek...
That tune is f*cking perfect!
j'aime D.M
my ring tone since 2 weeks .....
Amazing
<3
this slaps
WOW Very nice sounds
Bellissima la musica è la voce di dave sempre grandiosa e sensuale!! Questo pezzo è  travolgente! Lo adoro dal primo ascolto! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Słucham i słucham całkiem to dobre
LYRICS pleae. I love this song
I WANT THEM TO DO ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE SOUNDS OF THE UNIVERSE..  or another song like fragile tension or in symphony they really need to go back to that sound or speak and spell to bring the 80's sound back at least one song like dreaming of me that was a real good song
Klingt ein bischen wie And One. Geil aber nicht einzigartig. Da wird sich doch wohl der Meister nicht etwa was von einem seiner größten Fans etwas abgeschaut haben...?
Dave genual!!!!! Mais no me gusto la violencia del video!!primera vez en mil años.que no quedo contenta.
worst song of 2017
are you ppl all crazy? i think that if dave sing about raping your mother youll like it too bcs its dave...you are all sick, really! i loved dm, been fan 30 years but these is just weird...very weird...if you like what you see in this video then you must be very sick in your head or very evil...dave already sold his soul to devil...thats why hes still alive otherwise he wont be here ya know...get ur shit together ppl...and THINK!
Que video tan horrible !
Hands down nothing more attractive than a intelligent male/female. Aslan is the walking definition of why it is so important for our generation to READ books, gain on that general knowledge. You guys are hands down one of my favourite YouTube couples followed closely by Fleur & Mike Deforce xxx
In this video, Estee=perma-grin☺
whys it so dark??
Hey! What camera is she using?
If I had to pick the best part of the video...well ok..how about all 18 minutes of it?  Yes, sure does seem like paradise.  This is akin to visual utopia.  Well, I'll pick just one highlight.  @13:05 when you were showing off that lovely outfit.  The background, the sun setting behind you.. the colors and everything...beyond breathtaking.  Also doesn't hurt that we have a wonderful couple responsible for putting such a brilliant vlog out there.  BTW..I have watched this more than once.
GORGEOUS
New de_santorini remake looks decent
That absolutely says Sexplorer!
Nice vlog. Nice place. Thank you. Good luck.
Haha loved the shoit part! Good lookin’ couple 😍
beautiful..
omg Aslan's bouche pink velvet shirt is soooooo nice!
You in that flower dress and the background.. So beautiful <3
If you want a parfume that smells like that fresh salty air in Santorini you should try Jo Malone Wood sage & sea salt. It's just the best 😍😍😍😍
Hey Estee, seeing your vlogs for years now. Aslan n u are growing so beautifully!
Feel like I need to book a holiday now
Beautiful hotel, sadly out of our budget 🙁 but thanks for sharing
Aslan's crocs though. yasss bisshh slay all day. 9:47
this is so immersive, I've been to Santorini and the places you've mentioned including a visit to the caldera (Santorini is a volcanic island) and it's so beautiful! the people are very nice too. I love you guys :-))
This is amazing! This video just re-confirmed that I want my honeymoon there!
Made me so happy I have to go now
i really love your vlog, especially with aslan on it! xx
Oh my goodness! The pool! I cried! I adore your dress ❤️️❤️️
Wow, Santorini is stunning!!! 💦💦💦
everything was lovely!
More Asland OOTD please! So sweet!
The audio quality is insane!! Huge thank you!
Ohhhh my goodness. It is my number 1 dream to go to santorini. 😭😍 Sooo lucky.
So lucky!!! Makes me want to drop everything and go somewhere
So beautiful. Thank you for sharing!!!!!
Oh the memories! We went there four and a half years ago on our honeymoon and also stayed in Imorovigli. We were like the fourth to last hotel, you would have walked right by it. Man it’s beautiful. We neeeeed to go back! We did the hike right when we got there and were NOT prepared. We just went out, only brought one bottle of water, and were wearing flip flops. Whoops! We did the sunset in Oia, our hotel, and Thira and it was so amazing. Thus makes me nostalgic... thanks for the video! Shout out from Red Deer, Alberta!
I love you guys! Couple holiday goals💖
Omg looks beautiful😍💙💙💙
esteem I'm sorry i just need to say that you are a beautiful classy lady:)
Those views are what dreams are made of!
Estee, you should really try the Korres body lotion/ shower gel in Santorini Vine! It's my favourite scent out of the whole brand, which is greek and natural ingredient based! They're amazing!!
You picked the best time go. I will say until September Santorini is packed. Enjoy!
Santorini looks like the most beautiful place 😍 xo
There's a shower gel by Korres called Santorini Vine and it genuinely smells like Greece, I really recommend it! It's amazing.
what a beautiful video! this made me really happy <3
16:28 Estée has the most beautiful smile ever!
So happy you two visited my country!!!!
Estee, you are glowing. Love to see you and Aslan having such a wonderful time. Some of my favorite people ever, live it up in Santorini!
was thinking you guys both uploaded the same thing! I like the part 1/2 idea. Did you both edit the vlogs together?
I need to go right now, omg, so beautiful!
googled the hotel in case one day I go to Santorini - a little outta my price range 😳
This video is amazing , you guys are adorable
It looks AMAZING! Firmly on my Greece Trip list for June xx
Oia is pronounced Ia! Have fun in Santorini from a Greek in the UK :)
Honeymoon destination.....check!... No doubt about it Santorini it is!!
Estee,try the Korres Santorini vine line....I'm sure you are gonna love it!!!!First time I tried it ,I swear to God I felt I was there......also, Oia is pronounced Ia(not aia  but ea)....(oi in Greek is called difthongos, and is one of our 5 different Is)💖
If you loved the air in Santorini, I’d highly recommend going to iceland! You’ll love it, the air is so fresh
Hey random person scrolling through the comments!\nI hope you have a great day! \nFrom a Danish singer who's dream is to hit 10k subs🍀
I was in Santorini last month! It is so beaufitul place, thats true!! :-)
The fresh air they were talking about reminded me of when I visited Oregon...such clean fresh air!
It is pronounced IA in greek. Weather in Greece is nice till almost Christmas time.\nBut July and August it is very hot.
I went to see how much money it would cost for me and my boyfriend to go to this hotel at the end of august next year. A week for 5.500€. So... That isn't happening. :D :D :D
In the name Oia, the O is silent so you pronounce it as if it was written Ia (capital i not l, lol)!! I am a big fan of your videos! Hope you enjoy your time in our country! Welcome! If you need any tips, feel free to contact me!
Awww, Santorini is my absolute favorite place. Love every piece of it. Have fun. xx Linda
The trail has a lot of wild oregano growing along side.
Why do you all watch these Fucktards!!! Get your own life.
I'm so glad you visited my country and had such a wonderful time. You should visit again and discover the unique beauty of many other islands as well! Lots of kisses!
You are such a cute couple.
The prices for the hotel are absolutely ridiculous!
I really really enjoyed this vlog! Now I want to go there too!!
Please break down your trip to Santorini on your blog! I do want to visit. The hotel room looked extremely claustrophobic though, so not sure I could stay there even though it looks beautiful. 😳
this trip of yours was amazing . One of the best vlogs!!!!!  loved it 😘😍
you guys are so damn perfect together UGH want.
The thumbnail is so so sweet especially you guys rarely kiss in front of the camera!
I can't stop smiling! So gorgeous.
Wow i wanna earn that much money via youtube so i plan this kind of trip as well
So glad you two had a great time in my homeland! Next time you are in Greece go to Chania. Aslan will love the history and you will absolutely love this adorable little town.
Ok, it's time for me to finally go to Greece! I've done a bit of research, since I watched your videos, and the end of September, beginning of October is a great time.
Hey Estee and Aslan! My fiancé and I visited Santorini last spring, watching your vlog made me wanna go back asap! Thinking about maybe getting married there... Who knows!
Glad you had a wonderful time, just amazing views. You just cannot beat beautiful Greece at dusk. Great video
Love all the extra information Aslan provides!!! Thank you
whoa i did the hike at the end of july and let me tell you i feel your pain! i pasted your hotel a bunch, i remember those chair with the blue cushin! ugh i want to go back
8:23-8:50 “how do you even know this?!” with your face expression haha! reminds me of my boyfriend. what a lovely paradise !
OMG what a hotel! Santorini is stunning.\nI really enjoy this video cause you two seem so happy... love both 😘
Also, your room is actually a cave. Most homes on the cliff are built inside caves which formed after the volcanic eruption thousands of years ago. It's practical because homes are sheltered from the strong winds which you probably felt at times!
the French Connection floral dress is cute! Like Aslan's pink corduroy shoyt too :0p. The Santorini sunset was so lovely. Gorgeous place!
I love you as a couple guys!!! You are the perfect match!
So glad you both enjoy this gorgeus trip, thanks for sharing.
That's one place my husband and I are dying to go soon!  I'm hoping it'll be one of our next getaways! My sister-in-law and her family (including her 3 year old and 10 month old) are in Greece for 5 weeks!! So Stunning there!
That French connection dress is divine!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 it looks like you had the best time! :) definitely need to get myself to Santorini <3 xxxxxxx
You guys do the BEST TOURS!! I am always relaxed after I watch them! THANK YOU!
I have developed a serious crush on you guys! Your vlogs are so pleasurable to watch, funny, interesting and beautiful. Are you returning to Norway anytime soon? Maybe Bergen? :D
I almost didn't watch this vlog because I want to go to Santorini sooo bad! IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
Honestly, this was one of the loveliest travel videos I've seen. Of course the views, sun, nighlitghs and the sea (and oh the food!) helped, but it was your chemistry that truly made it magical ♡ haha sorry I'm just a romantic
this video was so calming to watch... dreamy
this was absolutely incredible! My boyfriend and I are now looking into planning a trip here! So gorgeous! Thanks for sharing estee :)
Thank you for this beautiful vlog, I would love to go there! And also, you look so gorgeous in that red dress, damn girl!!!
What a surreal looking place! So dreamy. A random question but, were there any bugs? You guys ate every meal outside and I didn’t see one insect. It truly does seem like paradise.
I’m so jealous ... stuck in my workbooks for school... seeing this thinking...FUCK maybe when i retire... anyone else? so beautiful.
for 800 dollars at least , the hotel has to be iconic hahaha
Stunning place,and an amazing vlog :))
Can't wait to see the boat trip it's so so beautiful I want to be there now! Xxx
Fat chinky and a flabby girl....fuck off
The colour is sooo off in this video it's a shame
She's gotten bigger
Yay, Ryan's Cooking Show! 10/10!!
omg Ryan's Cooking Show pls make this a thing!! with cheesy music and everything!
I am REALLY impressed by that transition at 5:07 Grace, well done!\n(I genuinely love you guys' creativity and content in general, but this one just really stood out to me...)
I see Ryan likes spices, garlic and basil. An handsome englishman who likes mediterrean ingredients?\nActually that nice pasta is some kind of Amatriciana, rather than Carbonara. They both have bacon inside but they are totally different; i adore them both anyway.
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Big spider??  It's so spindly!  Just a cellar spider; totally harmless.
I think He is good at cooking. Great
Good day to you madam
Mmm, I want Ryan's cooking
Love you guys! Xx❤️\n\n\n\n\nAnd your vlogs! Xx❤️
Ur vlogs r so cool
4:00-4:08 vibes 😂 same
ryan's so funny :D
Fumbs up!
Wow!\nHow old is the building?\nLooks quite old.  Lots of work.
Yay, food! but what is 5:23?
What's that white paste he squirts out of a tube? He used it last time too. Mayo? Some UK thing?

Jaclyn I love watching ur videos I learn so much from them wanted to ask a question that has nothing to do without the makeup\nI love ur chain would love to know where I got it from  ?
Wow. Some of you will attack anything and everything she does. Just leave her channel if you don't like her. Keep your hate to yourself
Hey, so I've been a really big fan of yours for a long time (through multiple phone changes-and therefore YouTube changes) and you really started my passion for makeup. You literally taught me everything I know. But here lately, you're very different and not so much in a good way. From what I see, everything has gone to your head. I think this whole Morphe, ULTA, repackaging thing was the last straw for me. I personally don't care, I don't feel jipped, I care about the shadows, not the packaging and shade names. But I feel like alot of your other fans do and they are hurt by it. I feel like you now care more about Morphe and making money via that route rather than your subscribers and building yourself up on YouTube. There are huge opportunities here, larger than what you've already achieved and you're more concerned about putting money in Morphe's pocket hoping to make a cut than furthering YOU and the platform that has given you the opportunties that you have. Just my two cents.
Jaclyn, I’m not sure if you have seen it but Courtelizz1 did an amazing video on your morphe collab. She had brain cancer, a tumor removed and it was her second time doing her make up since surgery. she did so amazing. I’m sure it would be amazing for her to know you watched her video. She had such an amazing story.
You can’t fight that Hocus Pocus focus, girl. Can never multi-task when that’s on!  Love this look, and feelin’ the background. But mostly love how YOU’RE feelin’ the background 😉
I know you're going through such a crazy ride of life right now, but i truly wish you use your pallet more and create more videos for your loyal subscribers who bought your pallet. I know you get haters, but please ignore them! They thrive on your reaction while your fans suffer from the lack of videos. Just remember, we're watching YOU. Not your haters. We're here because we love you and your art. So please girl, slay us with the glory that is your hard work- your pallet!
Who else heard Hocus Pocus in the background 😂😂
Love this make-up look it's Beautiful... I'm new to watching YouTube make-up looks and not sure you have done this ? Different Bridal looks ~ Classic look ~ Glam Bride ~ Over the top Bride ~ and things like that.
So pretty 💜\nAlways love your videos girl you are the best ❤️
Fall is the time of year where Hocus Pocus is a mandatory watch.
i will never understand why people hate that you use morphe so much. i personally love it because they’re such an affordable brand idk
back and better than evaaaaaaa ! Always a fav babe <3 (side note: not a huge* fan of the backdrop, I found it way too distracting)
Really enjoyed this video and feel inspired i also just purchased your palette xx
I'm not sure if I missed it but what are these lashes?! 😍🙌
i swear there is NO ONE better at these type of looks than jaclyn
She looks like a fucking mannequin
Yes! Finally woman thabks for posting a video. Brush off the negative comments your talent is what makes us want more 😉
Eat some of that and be pretty on the inside
I love this look! I'd really love to see an eye makeup look using the bright colors in your palette!! I'm obsessed with the palette but just can't put together a good look with the bright ones!! Help please!!
I love you Jaclyn!!!! Literally have been watching your videos for 4 to 5 years now 😎😄😁 your sooooo fucking amazing at what you do and you have taught me everything I know about makeup. Your such an inspiration 💚 f**k all the haters and negative people. You are beautiful with and without makeup!  Love you 😍😍😍😊💚
Great video!! \nJust posted our review of Huda Beauty foundation in the shade Chai. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnLnvqL9ng&t=3s watch to find out what we thought about it!!
missed your beautiful face <3 an amazing tutorial girl love you so much xoxo
Narcassistic sociopaths are the sign of societies demise. WELCOME to the END OF YOUR EXISTENCE NON HUMANS
Hey hun. Im in canadian and cant afford the shipping for your palette. When morphe heads over to sephora will your palette be there? Because i would really love it. Thanks doll keep doing you boo ❤
My best looks come to life only when I follow along with your tuts.!
What’s her intro song?
word. jaclyn. u should watch this.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZpTYXS79CE\nyour subscribers love you.  i hate that you dont post more on youtube.\nyou dont even use your pallete.  its honestly sad.
you are soo beautiful, i love uu
Is it true the JH Palette is the same formula as the rest of the Morphe eyeshadow palettes? :o
Do not get me wrong but whyyyy did you use so many orangey shades and the very bright color if you just covered it with the dark shades lmao I was soooo confused I didn't get this tutorial hahahahaha I love you though
I would love to see an unedited video! I think it would be so fun!!
Why don’t you use your own pallete
“I LITERALLY LET JOHN POP A PIMPLE IN MY ASSCRACK BEFORE” HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OH LAWDDDDDD IM FUCKING DEAD
What a conniving money hungry bitch you are. Can't wait for the pity party of this new Morphe relaunch thing
LOVEEEE
Greedy, lying,bitch
Hocus pocus in the background lmao 😻
Phony.
I’m dying. Those bloopers 😂 hahahahaha
Do you think you can put the names of the brushes on the screen for us plz. I know ppl would like to know as I've seen many ask before. Thx!!!
people need to honestly chill...its fuckin makeup just appreciate the creativity and relax
I live near India and I had to pay OVER $60 dollars for ur eyeshadow palette and now its made permanent and u bring it to ulta with better packaging??! \nI dnt wanna hear about how u didnt knw about it or that u never said it was limited edition, because morphe wouldnt have ANNOUNCED the palette to be made permanent if it wasnt limited to begin with. \nI just want you to sit back and truely look at how ur treating ur subscribers who are actually the reason u make so much money, kicking us in the face and insulting our intelligence.\nReally jaclyn. Im sick of you robbing us like this. \nPlease return back to who u used to be and stop being so vile and malicious
Bomb Jac
I'm so motivated to create a look using every single palette that I own.  NO JOKE!  If you can layer 50 colors on your eyes, well SO CAN I DAMN IT!  SO.CAN.I!!!!!
Your eyes are an absolute work of art 😍😮
I love that you use morphe because it's affordable for those of us who LOVE makeup but cant spend hundreds on small pallets that have only a few colors in them. As a mommy of three toddlers, morphe is a staple in my small collection. So thank you for making looks i can re-create (:
This is such a unique and helpful tutorial <3
Love this look! I prefer the natural background because it doesn't take away from the makeup for me lol but I'm honestly good either way!
I’m not sure why everyone is always so rude to her she seems like a super genuine person and she’s obviously doing something right as she is very successful. But Anyways I love you Jaclyn keep on keeping on!!
Is morphe going to restock your favorites set?
I love every look you do. You could wipe dirt on your face and it would slay! I like the backdrop but I do prefer no backdrop. It just feels more natural, like we're just girlfriends talking doing makeup!
Sit down. Be humble.
That was soooooo freaken beautiful 😍
you're so gorgeous... like lordddddd
You are the QUEEN! love this look for fall!
This is disgusting. So trashy.
Love the purple backdrop!
I liked the purple sparkly back drop its perfect for this vid xo
She has wayyyyy over done the face fillers. Jaclyn you’re gorgeous. Stop!!
Does anybody know what camera shes using? Thank you! ❤️❤️
I LIVE FOR THOSE BLOOPERS
Do you have any friends with hooded eyelids who would let you do their makeup on camera??? You're so good at the teaching part of your tutorials and I feel like I could really get it if you could show us what to do to create a crease for hooded eyes. Just wondering. Love you and your channel!
Whaat! This is weird! I tuned in and you are wearing my necklace! So weird.... this has happened before with earrings, hair color??? Are we telepathically communicating? Ha!
Girl, you are an artist! Also, I just noticed, the winged eyeliner trend is gone. Finally! Every pretty eye make up done used to be covered up with the wing eyeliner.
Beautiful makeup look..I love me some purple but for some reason that purple background is distracting?!? I remember u had a gold/silver one that was 👌🏼😘
I bought The 3052 palette so please continue to upload tutorials with it or just upload more Eyeshadow looks in general help me out Jaclyn lol ❤️
I'm like patiently waiting and hoping you do a fenty foundation review🤗🤗
💜
Jaclyn Hill What bottom mascara do you use?
Amazing! Love this :))
I look like a rodent hahahahahaha
She looks like she needs some Benadryl 🤔
I love this video❤️❤️❤️❤️
what kind of brush is that u use to pat on the  settin powder i kno sigma but what brush
That necklace is so cute!! Where is it from??
I love this look!😍
When are you going to post the collab with @KathleenLights
She's so annoying she talks so damn much
This backdrop makes me horny holy shit. im a purple FREAAAAAK love it
she thinks her shit doesn’t stink just because she has so much money... Her subscribers are the ones who helped her get to where she is today which she never acknowledges that. She’s honestly the most inconsistent you tuber I follow. The only time she ever posts a video is if new a Morphe pallete is launching or if it’s a look on her pallete... there are so many other YouTubers  who work their asses off to get to where they are and post 2 to 3 videos a week every single week while Jaclyn is over there hanging out in her custom-made closet that all her subscribers paid for!
Here we have another small project from the Furze book, what would you use it for....the garden or attack muhahaha. Link to get hold of the book yourself is in the description. Thanks to all that have bought it and are enjoying it. CF
Sua criatividade é impressionante... Fico feliz por você compartilhar.... o/

I had a problem with a neighbours cat, which used my garden as a toilet.  I made an almost identical box but put a PIR on it so that the cat got sprayed anytime it walked past.  I'm guessing the cat didn't like it very much, because he took his business elsewhere.
anyone waiting for the pulse-jet powered skateboard?
Can you fill a semi with fire works and see what happens
when are you going to upload another video about the BMW Hot Tub???
Two 9v batteries or a 12v battery.  But 9+9=18. Why does that work ?\nI'm dumb with electricity, but I try to learn.
Why make one when you can just buy the parts and put them together for cheap? Oh he did...
I think it's possible you have misunderstood the way to wire up that board. Normally you don't have to connect anything from the PWR IN to the three relay connections. Your wiring of the relay connections is unusual and may be the root of your problem. So, one solenoid contact goes to battery ground, but the other goes just to N/O and NOT to N/C. When your signal reaches the unit, the contacts switch over and the solenoid gets power. You might want to try it
You should make a mini bike (taco bike)
Relays for the most part will always need a common connection. Also you would wire using NO contact of the relay meaning no current flows to the valve under normal conditions. When you activate the relay (button) you close the circuit allowing current flow to the valve.
Beware that if you are using two or more lithium batteries, do not. I repeat DO NOT short them. They have to be wired properly or you will get hurt. Batteries may explode.
Time to build one for my aquarium. Remote controlled water changes hell yeah lol
8:40 That absolutely makes sense and makes the board more flexible.\nWhen you want to switch a 120V or 240V device you shouldn't power the receiver and the relais with that voltage. So you need two different power inputs.
Can u make a flying car
If the diameter of your hose is too small, dip the end in hot water for a while to make it pliable so you can force it onto/over the fitting.. Or as Colin might say, Pop the end of yer hose in a fresh hot cup of tea, and it will come out a little bit stretchy and you can bang it right on there.
Here in the states, we call those jublie clips hose clamps, but I like the British name better. 😁
I am sure lot of people come here because of the crisp English he speaks
Could totally use this in a similar fashion to the airsoft gun doorbell...
This one is bad. That's not a good circuit, electronics are in the same box as the hydraulic valve, without spacers and not only you messed up the relay NO/NC contacts, you didn't know why common needs to be connected. The reason is that this way, you can also use it to switch 230V mains if you want. Seems like a useless project, since the two 9V batteries likely won't last a week in NO configuration or even a day in NC configuration (those solenoid valves draw a lot of pixies and the relay box is just inefficient).
Colin, Who's the cute girl?
build a sugar cotton machine
Bloody Hell Colin somthin useable with out a explosives permit?

are we not going to talk about jubilee clips
shouldn't the black (ground) wire from the solenoid valve go to the common terminal on the circuit board?

Another absolute phenom vlog!  I literally cannot get through a Nile vlog without a giant grin on my face.  Him and his friends/family just bring so much joy to everyone.
Cracking comeback after the injury, mate. Was rooting for you and delighted to see you made the world championships. Looking forward to see much more of your journey, Nile.
I've been a fan for a long time and it makes me feel so good to see you succeed and be so proud of yourself!\n\nEdit: Wow, that was really cheesy
Honestly, I need a GIF of you and your dad dancing 😂🙌🏼
So happy for you Nile, just found out your channel today! It feels strange to see all these talented people reunited in my hometown but at the same time it's great!\nCongrats again for both the finals and how you pushed through this year~

It's possible to start gymnastic at 16 years?
I always wondered what that thing is in his intro. Is it a computer mouse or something???
I'm weak and skinny so how do I get started???
I hope you have *all* permissions for any songs prior to uploading (even in the background)! If they have Copyrighted material your whole channel will get scanned and they'll claim the videos (all your future ad rev). Not a criticism, just a heads up! Loving the content my man
Who tf is this guy?
Is it just me or do Nile and Max not get along?
Congrats Nile! Killing it and inspiring. I actually liked this time though cos of Purvis' freestyle.
Nile, where do you live? I went overseas recently and your accent suddenly came to my mind, not sure why xD
Nile how did you like Canada? And did you like us Canadians?
I won National for Taekwondo and I’m in Kang’s Taekwondo. Now I’m National champion,but I can’t go to world because I’m not old enough. I’m only 8 and I’m supposed to be 12!
Nile I’m state champion in gymnastics Australia,Queensland
Dear Nile, I am an 11 year old gymnast and just got a silver medal in a competition and I just wanted you to know that you are my sporting idol and that you are an amazing inspiration to me and you are a positive role model to anyone. Your talent is impeccable so keep it up!PS: I am apart of the body bible fitness group!
I just wanted to let you know that tomorrow I'm going to my first gymnastics practice in years and I can honestly say that it was because of you and your videos.
1:42 OMG same Daisy, SAME! 😁💕👍
see this and you know...\nhttps://youtu.be/-FZYBI8JVtA
She had me at arsenal.
Wow. That Last Jedi talk was amazing. Now I know everything.
It's obvious that this whole thing is choreographed, and that she already knows what the questions will be.
I like her even more now. The original IT scared the piss out of my brother and me when we were kids.
Definitley a huge turn off for me was the foul mouth...after this interview something was lost...I wish her the  best though.
Football or Futbol however you pronounce it is still correct than soccer
C'mon now Daisy everyone knows that part of Lose Yourself plus you still messed it up! YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE REY
she forgot to tell the most important description: Jedi
I’m not a girl it’s her son she so preety I want to met her and will life and I witch she was my mom she’s so beutlful and preety and shes awsome and i love her. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😍😍😍😍😘😍😘
This looks like a casting couch video
I'd love to stick my fingers up her vagina
This seems like the beginning to a porno
Still waiting for the part where he takes his dick out....
Make's you wonder what she had to do for the part?
Do her and keira knightly share a mouth?
5:26\n\nMY NIGGA SHE TURNED AROUND AND I HEARD THE LORD SINGING
Her 'hidden' talent is ruining Star Wars.
Did you see the phone she had god damit
I'm British and I have never heard of any of the 5 shows she named\n\n???
She used kilos and corrects *football is the best thing
She looks like she'd be the best to just hang out with honestly :) And props for mentioning Keeping Up Apperances, that's low key the best british comedy!\n\nDude should've asked how she looks so much like Keira Knightley lol
The intro is like a porno intro
A daisy isn't her favorite flower?
He didn't finish his tea
Oh God, I love her...she's so charming.
I see a white wall
Foul mouthed, no wonder. She supports the Arsenal
Rey is a grey Jedi confirmed
I love Daisy so much oh my gosh I CANT
Kylo Ren has obviously made 2,000 YouTube accounts to increase the number of dislikes this video has...
Yeah Daisy is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000 % the perfect girl.
She is awesome.
Damn Daisy can spit!!
SHE IS PERFECTION 😱
That a cuddle always helps. \n Tears

If you're looking for one good thing about 2017 so far, it's that Vogue interviewed Daisy Ridley and censored a bunch of implied The Last Jedi spoilers, but decidedly not the profanity. We've come so far. :')
My god she’s perfection.
vomit on my sweater, all i heard was mom's spaghetti. I sense some meme-potential.
MY FAVORITE COLOR IS ALSO GREY
3:59 is when I stopped watching
Grey isn't a color, it's a shade.
She reminds me so much of Kiera Knightly.
This seems too rehearsed for my liking.\nCould be wrong but it feels insincere.
This feels like a weird POV adult film that goes nowhere. I love her, but it is paced weirdly and his voice is creepily full compared to hers in this audio.
These are so fake and staged. Cringe
I must be immature because I found those bleeps at the end funny.
You will tighten these restraints! \nWhat?\n\nComing this fall ‘50 shades of Rey’

She is so fuckin white

They just gonna leave the door open like that?
I love these natural, unscripted down-to-earth interviews.................*sigh*
Daisy is awesome
Oh i get it gREY
loved the whole song but the beatdrop ruined everything..

I'm just here to die over having dreams about my crush that only likes me as a friend 😁don't mind me😁😫
And they say we don't have good music nowadays.
I love this song !!♥
I’m so proud of her. She has come so far.
I'm in it for the long game, to see Sabrina evolve even more than this😫💖💖shes just amazing. But, i know it's early, but my life is complete💀💖💖
😭😭 im crying, I've been watching her grow up since 2013 and now look at this little peanut, she grew up so talented and lovely, i can't wait to see you grow up to be a greater person. I love you ❤
She is so pretty.😍😍😍 Her voice is amazing💖💖💖 and this song is amazing.👍👍👍👍. This video looks like alot of fun.💖💖💖💖💖
MY LIFE IS COMPLETE
love this song tho all proud of you sabrina <3
I stopped watching Disney Channel is 2012 or 2013 so i never actually saw Sabrina's show. I found out about her through her songs, and her songs are actually really good. She might be the next big Disney Star to have a music career bc no one else sticks out right now. \nIt's actually crazy that most of the popular singers today come from Disney. They have among the highest numbers of views and streams in the industry, and I didn't realize it till a few months ago.
so proud of my little baby Sabrina ❤️
YESSS I WANTED THIS SONG MAN
This song sound like Sabrina wrote this.
This song is so good, deserved a better video
hOW CAN I BE LATE BY 3 DAYS I AM DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF
Wow I never knew Sabrina... She sings so well , is she having her own channel?
Who seen Sabrina Carpenter live , I have, she amazing live.
OMG I AM SO PROUD OF HER!!! Love you Sabrina!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Any one also knows look at us now by lost kings and ally Brooke
Awesome this song is my first love!#rianagrace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJk😂😂😂its lit tho

It sounds like she's saying birds love 😂😂😂

I LIVE for this tutorial!!! 🖤👻🎃 YAAAASSSS BIIIIITCCCHHH!!!! I love it, thank you and thank you for being the beautifully amazing human that you are ☺️
Okay may be a dumb idea...or maybe not but maybe next year (or still this year) you could do a series of like glam looks that you then turn Gory so people can do glam or gory!! Love this look and obvi it inspired my idea but seriously obsessed with this!
u make me proud to be aussie lol
This was just cool
i freaking love this so much
So creative I love it chloe
That was amazing! You still look awesome in this costume! 👏🏻🎃😁
so good!!! I love how real you are all the time
lol chloe did you just wing this tutorial? especially coz you kept rubbing things off? even if you did thats amazing coz i wouldve needed multiple practices before putting it on camera. also ,why would your video be demonitized?
You're so great. Loved the vid
hahahah i particularly love the gratuitous cussing at the beginning. such fucking bullshit that vids now get demonetized for swearing. just one of many ways for them to ultimately control content.
Love this makeup and I look forward to all your videos😍
love this look! so original and you're videos always make me laugh!
You are the best Chloe!
Omg so much work went into this video! I wish it was monetized, you deserve it!
This is the best Halloween tutorial I have seen yet!!!
Love you girl! I’ve been watching your videos for years! I personally never wear makeup and if I do it’s only eye liner and mascara but none the less i enjoy all of your videos!
I LOVE your Halloween videos so much!!! I think you're on the same level as special fx makeup artists cause idk how the hell you come up with this stuff on your own it's so creative and original!! I wish I had money to buy this stuff cause I wanna try this look! Can't wait for the next one!!!
i’m tryna wear this eye look to class this week
Such a good Halloween idea!
I've never watched a video on special effects makeup that was better explained.  this was great !!
Love you too much
this was creative asf , love it 😍
I think you just changed my mind about what I was going to do for Halloween, I LOVE this!
my favorite of your videos, just throwing out all the words in the intro. I'm into it hahaha
Chloe this was awesome! Making me rethink my Halloween costume idea to try this 🤔
I wish we celebrated Halloween in Australia just so I could try these tutorials! getting serious Cara Delevingne feels with those brows... in a good way (Y)
Not only stunningly beautiful and talented but fucking hilarious too 😄😍😍😍
Amazing i love it
Best Hallowe'en tutorial on Youtube so far! <3
Amazing! I love this look <3
I laugh so much with your comments!!! You rock!! Xoxoxo
You are great! And always so fun!😘
you are the best 🙌🙌
This is legitimately the scariest Halloween tutorial I've come across so far! 😐😄 Chloe can you pretty please bless us with a 3 looks 1 palette tutorial with your new palette? ❤️❤️ K thanks love you bye xx
your videos are like the only reason i go on youtube!<3
You always have the most creative tutorials!
YouTube is doing you dirty :(
Best Halloween Tutorial this year until now. So fed up with Skull-Tutorials. Well done Chloe, really like it :-).
You did such an amazing job!! 👍🏻
This was so scary looking, I live 🎃
you should make more videos like this ;d
Immediately liked it when I heard fuckity fuck fuck, penis
This was awesome, really enjoyed it.\nTotally unrelated, but can I say, I ordered your latest colab with Ciate and it came in last week and I have never owned or used Ciate before.  Girl, this palette is gorgeous and so versatile and honestly, I can't stop using it.  I used it yesterday, got SO many compliments on my makeup it was getting embarrasing but you know what really shook me?  I left my house at 8 am and did not return home till midnight and you know what, other than very mild smearing under my eyes, it was totally intact as if I just did it and I did NO touch ups and it was even a rainy day.  Worth every penny and great job so I just wanted to tell you that.
Wont be going to a Halloween party this year but will def do those eyes next weekend as I have that palette :D
You are freaking Awesome. Love these tutorials and You 💜
Here am I interacting
LOVE how creative this look is!!!! <3
I think this is my all time favourite Halloween look!!! 😻
Love you Chloe!! <3 entertaining as always
love thiss look, and you more!
Why goodbye to monetisation when using fake blood?
Adore this! Love that you went for a full gore look but still managed the glam as well 😅 also noticed that you sound the same as you did in your early videos (maybe you were shyer then) probs because you could hardly move your mouth 😅💕
THIS IS SO ACCURATE
*When you're a minority of literally any kind*\nUnless that's too tumblr\nNo, no, I mean it.\nBut it is borderlining sjw/racist at the same time and that leaves me with a deep internal conflict considering my own privileged upbringing...\nNope. Nope, I'm saying it, it's there. That's that.\nBuuuuuuuuuuuut...
This video was so cute that I think I'm gonna get fired.
Such an object\n\n\n\n\n(Its a joke) so just dont little salty...uuhh..person
Lol this killed me with laughter
Literally did not laugh once, not even a little nose laugh
All this showed me is that feminists are indecisive and not willing to take a compliment.
Stop being a feminist
Like a lot of the new College Humor Sketches, this is so relatable until the last bit, then it goes a little overboard to make it comedy... \n\nWell done. Now for a male version of this
Wow! Buzzfeed? Where did you come from? It's been a long time since I have seen one of your ridiculously idiotic videos. Wanna go get some coffee together...or go out to eat...maybe see a movie? 
She straight up committed suicide. Women are idiots. Specially blondes.
Standing Up For Yourself as a Woman, But Not Too Much
Humorous but very on point.  Well done!
When she shoved her bag in his face LOL Say goodbye to this
Oh my god very revolutionary very progressive you guys at college humor really made a difference this time!
One of the better scripts in recent months
This is what it would be like with a woman president...
Thought i was about to be in for another sjw filled shitfest by college humor. Still a shitfest, but at least it made feminism look like a bigger shitfest.
''Mimimi this joke is like 0.02% serious mimimi sjw mimimi buzzfeed''\nHoly shit, just unsubscribe already and never come back.
This better be fake
This is stupid and sexist and sooo stereotyped like wtf we're your sources college humor also men have to apologize and this is a great example of how women are. Also it's funny how it says we don't know what Unfair is but by we I mean men which is retarded
Its not up to you to decide what your boss thinks of your work just like if people think you're an asshole its not up to you if people think You're an asshole
When she’s outside you can see an add with Katie saying “Drink Splish”
I'm just hear to see Katie's T&A, so this video pretty much sucked.
Women logic at its best.  Just one more reason NOT to work with them.
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool thank you guys so uch for this amazing chhanel and video
WHO IS THE GUY IN THE GREY SUIT OH MY F GOD
You guys could post a video of just a piece of dogshit and all these idiots would still think it was funny
This video was cute, but one thing it wasn't... funny.
This video is the definition of fucking cancer.
Where's the humor?  Boring nonsense!
Cause you're a BIG stinky MAN
Is this how comedians see board room meetings. Lol cute.
A very accurate alternate title to this sketch could be When Keepin' it Real, Goes Wrong. 😂 (ref hint)
Lol, the billboard in the background with Katie on it.
And then she joined buzzfeed
This is retarded, why anyone watches it?
CH is back to being funny!!! Yay!!!
and today I got to know that, her name is 'Rekha' , not 'Recca'. :D
Still unfunny and none of this ever happens lol
Is that woman still afraid of owls?
I like her southern California accent
This is 1000000% me omg I need to tone it down! Lol
Really?A bit stereotypical don't you think?
I can't tell if this is a parody of women or a parody of work places environments or if its just a silly video about cat power points.
Wow, things really are different for men.\n\n\nA man would have started kissing his boss' ass immediately!
I like that billboard
lol i totally love this video. what an accurate presentation. I think this is why we are tired of winy feminists... they act out and are unstable over nonsense.
Reka you were so overacting However it happened and the whole idea is perfect fighting both sides of our charisma
The kitten is real cute, though !
Wow, this is pretty sexist... to men.
I thought it would be like your presentation was on kittens
You’ve made your point..... in the first minute..... CH videos are dragging on too long lately.
I dunno. Felt a bit like it was trying too much to make a point but failed on the humor part.
I just hope they didnt fire her...
The last shot was the funniest 😂😂
Ugh Reika is this worst thing that happened to ch
This new person pisses me off
This is a joke by the way.
I felt like she took Katie's role in this one, funny all the same.
I think the real question is: how far is too far???
Such an awesome video Rekha is such a good addition to the team!
that ending was pretty funny tho
Why was this relatable?
Well at least rehka got some titties
This was just weird, Rekha
Fired
AHAHAHAAHAHA women always apologize smh
That Katie reveal.
Relatable
@ Rekha...what's poppin 😍😍😜😘😘
facts
OFFENDED lying feminists lmao
Trigger warning
Bipolar disorder
Rekha grosses me out
Respect women
God damn, CH is really becoming Buzzfeed.
Woman? Yall ugly liberal sissies
Femenist bullshit
bag her
This is stupid
Feminazis in a nutshell
Hahaha
She's cute.
Somebody fire her
Nice tits
So cute!!!
Fucking buzzfeed
Oh my god feminist bullshit
Hey @CollegeHumor\n\ni know you have Rekha for diversity points, but you are ruining what people liked college *Humor* for.\n\nHumor.\nnot politics
This is making fun of modern day American feminism. Too bad conservatives' brains haven't developed enough to understand that
I hate this chick's videos. God, I want comedy, not to watch an SJW push her agenda.
Oh my God....PLEASE go back to being FUNNY!
Don’t know if I should hit this with the Slow claps 👏 or hope that she gets fired.
You know I used to think people who thought CollegeHumor and BuzzFeed were similar were silly, but as the days go by, they continue to advance into their direction. I am disappointed
I don't really like how you guys are starting to make videos like this - you're starting to look a little like Buzzfeed and that's the worst thing for your company. I really enjoy your old school risque comedy but understand that the algorithm probably wouldn't allow for that. Just something that isn't to do with social politics would be great, I think it's why most people watch you guys, because you don't usually touch on these kinds of topics which is rare to find on YouTube these days.
I bet none of you have even been to a real meeting. Its doesn't happen like this you SJW
Woman have the same rights
First world problems, many woman out there don't have the right to have high end jobs or the have right to speak. These are personal problems
Colors debuted at #19 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I1B4n_8Cto&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=19
Best video on youtube!
this is the ultimate stim video
It's almost unfair how talented beck is. Almost.
Man that chorus 1:03
ASMR
Beck is back.
i busted a nut
es muy....muy placentero verlo
r/oddlysatisfying
this guy's a fuckin genius
Reminds me a lot of Animal Collective.
i need to hear Beck ft. Calvin Harris
I wish people made slime videos like this ;-;.
what's next, fidget spinners?\nI'd probably still like it tho.
There's no such thing as good acid but I'm glad someone still doing it
Like an 80’s and 90’s fusion. On repeat all day
respectively best out christmas tournament drift fifty garden.
Beck THIS SONG!!!!! You're so incredibly talented
I'm a 62 yr old dude and I've loved Beck since I first heard him in '94.  Best musical phenom since The BeaTles.
Beck just saved the year with some others
A couple months late but ok
no man, le re chupo la pija a tu imaginacion
The purple one is the most satisfying.
Metendo a mão na massa
So much slime !!!!
this slime looks so cancer causing :O
mmmmm
Unicorn cum!
B-52s
This almost qualifies as visual-tactile synaesthesia.
So satisfying.. so hypnotizing
OMG😂😂😂
soy un pededor?
ssss
anyone got tabssssssss$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Let me guess: the next viedo will hav fidget spinners
Anyone else getting animal collective vibes from the vocals?
If there's a nontoxic version to imitate, kids with autism would be in heaven to see this.
muito bom
Cool
Boring
that purple slime is makin me wanna cream meself ngl
Magical!
*goes on instagram once*
As a mom, i just cant escape slime...in the house, on the couch, in the garage, baggies of it, cups of it....now on my Beck video lol
I need to make slime right now (I love this song)
wow, i can't believe this is still the same guy who did Mellow Gold, Still a loser, baby to me, this new stuff is way poppy
I need to see the live version of this!
Get out of my feed
Hidden treasure right here.
cool
good
I feel the strange urge to squeeze boobies... nah forget it I feel it all the time
This is an odd thought, but I'm personally concerned about the environmental impact of this craft trend. It is as bad as plastic and has numerous ways it can kill wildlife.
The is Dr. Squish's dream vid
That is one hell of a hook.
Really slime omg this is so cool
Welcome back beck. This album is so much better then the last two.
If this is the actual music vid the slime has taken over
Introducing:  Slime
WNDR★ #NewSound ~ Beck - Colors\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WonderMusicTV/posts/885781214929231
With this and his other new stuff Beck is pushing out a brilliant, feel-good vibe. Smile, sing, dance.
I want to make some pizza dough now
This video made me hungry
as for me ,  sounds great but too much of Duran Duran )))
Didn't know porn was allowed on youtube.
I love how beck has included cosimo henri, and Tuesday in his new videos.
beck and asmr
Song’s addicting, won’t come out of my head
new beck YAY!  sounding a tad bit like g. numan! :)
saving for shrooms
who came here from tibbleslimes
tibbleslimeees
I felt tingles all over
satisfying video
Beck was watching some slime punk songs/videos
Tibbleslimes helped with the slime part
What's with the baby hands and what is under that other persons finger nails?
I wish these hands would be Mine😌
Best new song off the album
Beck, you should buy an old 4 tracks recorder. This song is awful!
Throwback to George as a hand model circa 1993
somebody tell me please these aere all subliminal messages😂😂😂😲
Why didn't you released this when slime was as popular as Taylor swift
Casting call for hand models with long filthy fingernails
i like the flute
Just got his new music cd yesterday. Great tunes! Grammy material!
i just keep imagining an epic fight inside a subway car
It’s like watching the oddly satisfying videos playlist on Instagram
Best idea for a music video I have seen in a while
Love him so much! This video is so damn beautiful!\n I'm independent singer-songwriter and music producer. Hope you like my songs Devotion and Teenage Angst :) Please share your opinion and like. Thank you!:)
This is how you stay relevant.
Alright! I'm going to google How to make Slime b/c this is too cool to miss out on.
Wow, video quality is so bad. Even at 1080p it feels too much compressed and there's so much noise in it.
Beck! Fucking make some real music why don't you this is garbage
YASSSSSS
Beck is always up to something dope
great song but the slime with little balls is cringey
This is one of the non-inventive songs I've heard this year.  Beck's lost it!
I loved Logan and Children of Men is one of the best films ever made, so I had a lot of fun putting this one together! *What films would you like to see me tackle in the future?*\nAlso, if you happen to be looking for stock footage for a project and want to help support LFTS, check out the 7 day free trial of Videoblocks: http://bit.ly/LFTSVideoblocksTrial
Now I must watch Children of Men.
I was waiting for someone else to make this comparison!  So glad you did!
I've just rewatched The Breakfast Club - pleaseeeeee consider doing an episode on that film.  I'd love to hear your take.
Amazing. You make my comparison film reviews look amateur. Great video man.
Whether or not you do a video essay on it up to you, but if I may recommend a film to you with a lot of themes and ideas to unpack, you should check out The United States of Leland starring Ryan Gosling, Don Cheadle, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Malone, and Chris Kline. Very heavy film.
how about... THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, please? You've need tackled on a comedy, besides GHOSTBUSTERS and American Beauty, although the latter film isn't exactly a comedy...
Best video I have ever seen
Hi Michael, I love your video essays. I've been learning a lot. I'm writing a story sort of like wonder boys (by Chabon) and Sideways. And although i kind of see the comparison, i would very much like to see your take on it. thanks a lot!
I love your work. Seriously. I'm a aspiring writer/screenwriter and your essays have helped me a lot trough the process. Here's a suggestion: analyze Chinatown. Why is it so important? Why is it so baddass screenwriting? Thanks again and keep up the good work, man.
Now I want to view both films back to back. Fantastic work.
One of the best analyzing videos I've seen. Great analysis on my favorite movie of all time. Keep up the awesome work.
One could say Han Solo could fall into this category
One of the two favorites movies of all time
i really loved both of these films and I was blown away by this great comparison and analysis - great work!  very inspiring!
There are two types of people whose choices/actions defines them as true heroes: Those who endure all the pain, suffering, and sorrows of the world, so no innocents would ever have to feel them. And those who no matter their desires to protect the innocents and to see justice is served, by the book and nothing but the book, are hated, look down upon, and whose names are ridiculed by same innocent people they fight to protect. They continue to protect them nonetheless, without any regrets. :D
Another amazing video.  Thanks for the incredible content, it's serving as much needed inspiration as I battle through my screenplay.
I guess you can add The Last of Us to this as well and I love all of them. I guess I'm just a sucker for this type of story.
This video is beautiful. Thank you
Great vídeo !! I wound love to see you talking about The handmaids tale 😃
This is like a video essay. Thesis and supporting evidence.
The Beginning is the End is the Beginning - Smashing Pumpkins
Great video, can you do The Prestige?
Verrrrry well done sir! Keep up the good work!
I will buy those books!
You have such fantastic content. I watch your videos multiple times bc they really get my creativity going. Thank you so much for the work you do!
When you brought up the protagonist believing in a lie that reflects the problems with society, my immediate thought was Bladerunner 2049. What a beautiful character arc for K
I didn’t even have the language to articulate it at the time, but I knew Children of Men was the most powerful (and probably best) movie I had ever seen the first time I watched it.
Great topic.  I'd believe this idea more if you started the explanation with the beginning of the stories instead of the end.  Better proof to just see how it is before the persuasive links are made for the learners.
This video is great. I’m definitely subscribing and definitely binge watching more of your videos
Another piece of media very similar to this is the Last of Us. Identical narrative composition.
Please do an analysis on La La Land! Though I personally think that the screenplay is mediocre, the execution is spotless, and I would LOVE an analysis on the this aspect.
I've never thought about this but soon as I read title of this video I (internally) screamed: Of course!
Wow, The Last of Us follows this formula point for point as well.\nI was joking when seeing the Logan trailer that it would be the Last of Us movie we didn't get but I hadn't realized how similar the two stories actually are until watching this video.
I'd never realized it, but the Matrix fits this structure to a T as well.
It is hard to believe how young your channel is. You went so far, so fast.
I appreciate your work so much. just amezing work.\nmuch love from Denmark
The last of Us is heavily inspired by Children of Men and Logan is basically The Last of Us  but with mutants.
One of your best essays yet, Michael! I love both movies, and you've communicated why they are so effective so eloquently. Really good job
The Last of Us is similar, I think
Whatever you do, whatever you make, I always love all your videos :)
Really wish this was longer..I love these videos so much
Love this channel! I used your advice from the Star Wars LFTS to make the protagonist of my short film more active! Thanks for making my writing better.
Never seen Children of Men but it kinda reminds me of V for Vendetta. Why are the British so convinced they will be the last country standing(and why do they need to turn Fascist to do so)
Eyes Wide Shut is one of my favorite films of all time. I can't figure out why tho. DO IT PLEASE :-D!
Fuck man, I love this episode
We really need an analysis on Acts 2 and 3 as well.
I wonder if the academy has the guts to give Jackman a best actor Nom for Logan?
Okay, I would pay you to do a full analysis like this of your favorite movie. These videos are insane.
I love how, even though I'm a writer and not a director, most of the lessons you cover are applicable to my work. Big thanks as always.
This was fantastic!! Man...thank you for making these.
You are great at this. Thanks you for this. I love your essays. And also, your voice is soothing.
Once again, congratulations, Michael. I believe this to be one of your finest works yet. It's quite a pleasure to watch such thought and well-crafted analysis every week. By the way, I also consider Logan as one of the best films of this year, but I must say I did not care much for Children of Men after I first saw it, many, many years ago. After this wonderful essay, I sure will give it another chance. Greetings from Argentina.
Beautifully said.  I absolutely adore the analysis in your video essays, keep up the great work!
Soo, doing it only for the money lead to bad things eh? That's one similarity
While not a favorite of mine, I would love for you to do a analysis of Annie Hall, especially after seeing your video on When Harry Met Sally. I'm really surprised to not see anyone else request this one.
Do Where the Wild Things Are
This was fantastic. Thank you.
I really enjoyed watching this video
wait did cleo die? i thought he just passed out. fuck...im just gonna pretend i didnt hear that
What is the music at 4:50 - 5:27? I cant find it on the sound cloud :(
Wow this was super helpful for me thank u!
Interesting video (for a change ^^)! Have you seen Blade Runner 2049?
This is the best video on this topic I EVER! Wow, you're amazing. Keep it up Michael.
The Last of Us fits this mould perfectly as well. Literally the exact same narrative arc.
could you please do the Shawshank Redemption next? \np.s. I love all your movies. Keep it up :)
I would love to hear you talk about an Edgar Wright film. Any of them really (my favorite is the World's End and no one talks about it). Anyway, great observation, great editing, thank you. I always look forward to your videos, keep it up.
Man, this video is great!
Do something over Jack Reacher Never Go Back
Dammit, I need Act 2 and 3! Great work man!
(sorry about my english) I've never watched CHILDREN OF MEN, so I've watched only for watch this video. Amazing movie and analysis. Thank you.
Try comparing Moulin Rouge and Star Wars because both have (possibly surprising) foundations in mythology/hero's journey, which is of course quite the common archetype for stories.
Love the video and the way it pleasantly surprised me. Also could you or anyone else please tell me the film music used in this video?
Had Clive Owen been ten years younger, he would have made an interesting Logan.  Had Hugh Jackman been ten years younger he would have made an interesting James Bond.  Hmmmm.  Not that Clive played Bond, but when you look at the old BMW ads he starred in you could see he woulda been a good one.
It's almost been a year since I started the 3rd draft of my novel for NaNoWriMo. I finished it in the summer time and have been taking a break from it to build my business, and I am often contemplating revising it soon.\n\nTHIS video essay has inspired me to come up with way better revision ideas than I had thought of the past year. Since I am character centraled writer, I'm looking back on my product and seeing the glaring flaws in my book AND the potentialfor it to be better. \n\nThanks to this video, now I have a better idea of how to handle my protagonist's character arc. The fact that the lie she believes in is too easily debunked early in the book, and now I am seeking ways to get that lie to hold her back even further than before so I can make a more compelling narrative.\n\nTHANK YOU, Michaeal, for everything you do on this channel. It truly helps a lot!
i think it's really interesting that the last of us could be considered a hybrid of both these character arcs. Joel is also a man devoid of hope for the future who travels across america with a young girl who symbolises hope. He also learns both how to love (value of family like logan?) and how to hope for a future again. P.S very solid video, well done
what about doing Leon or maybe a cartoon like rick and morty or a foreign film \nlove the channel!!!
While this is a video essay analyzing two screenplays, its like a short film in itself. Fantastic.
Yes yes and yes. Keep ‘em coming.
Always looking forward to your videos ! Thank you !
Awesome video. I like videos of this kind. However, i feel like the arc of Logan has been done a million times in different and better ways. I cant say anything about Childre of Men, because I havent seen it
You doing a great job in these videos. Thank you😊
Great video! I finally have Truby's book and it's a great resource, everything is laid out in depth and detail and once you see the structure, it's hard to 'un-see', such is the consistently refined nature of story-telling.\n\nStill waiting on The Godfather!
Very informative video. Thanks.
fascinating as always!!
Excellent video.
fantastic stuff
review rudderless
The Dresser and Birdman.
Good job.
Brilliant
This was excellent
You are truly amazing!
OMG! Great!
One  kingman
Logan is not a great movie, Children of Men on the other hand, it is
Another perfect video yet again by the genius of you. Thank you! (: I wasn't too interested in seeing Logan but I am now because of this video. I would like a video on Moonrise Kingdom or Fantastic Mr. Fox :P
You've made a lot of amazing and useful videos. I have to say, this is the best and most important lesson you've taught.
Man, I really want to watch this video. I guess I need to see Children of Men.
Wow, this analysis was hypnotizing, I couldn't look away from the screen. Great video Michael, thank you!\nYour channel inspires me.

Omg anna’s Bianca voice is so funny. “Oh she’s so stupid”😂
Doesn't Anna just seem so healthy and happy recently? 💙
So proud of you Jonathan ❤️
The voice she did for the dog hahahaha she should do wee puppet shows it's so good hahaha
I just love Anna
HAAA!! Anna's Bianca's voice is everything
I’m from Hungary 😊living in Uk 😊
Anna you are amazing with that voice!!!!....I love it~~~Is UK the only place you can buy the smoothies???????
How beautiful is Anna guys??!! And hilarious too!!
Love watching u guys! It brings a smile to my face!💖 alessia is so adorable, emilia is so kind and clever ,Eduardo is so cute and happy, Anna is so gorgeous and Jonathon is so bubbly and sweet! I'll always watch your lovely videos! Xxxxx
As soon as he said #nevercopyanother I Started to copy someone
if you go to bing type in yotube and search at the nside there is a little picture of you guys the saconyjolys
Eduardo's laugh is the best !
Hahaha I love Anna’s bianca voice they are sooooo funny
When Johnathan was talking about those muffins all I could think about was that scene from mean girls; would you like me to assign someone to butter your muffin? 😂
Love love love Anna doing that voice over for the dogs!! 😂😂
Alessia might be the happiest little human on earth 😂❤
Omg anna you kill me with the dog voices it's hilarious! Really looking forward to meeting you guys in Milton Keynes in a few weeks!
I love you guys so much! Such amazing parents ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a big inspiration Jonathan! Your story will help so many people. I love your family and have watched for over a year now 💗💗
Hahaha I love them their so Funny 😂 Jonathan is so brave also
I'm from Hungary 🇭🇺
That voice and clip though.... genius !!!!!
loving the photo in the background at the start, little squid.
So so proud of your bravery, Jonathan ❤❤❤
Anna is so funny, she had me dying in her Bianca voice
Don't ignore signs of this happening to your children.
Anna needs to do a whole video just in the dogs voices. I love it !!
The fAct that you told people what  happened is incredibly brave, inspiring...and shows a LOT of strength...i hope it helps others who have sadly been in your situation...even if they don't feel so alone 💚💚 my heart breaks thinking of how many people have been victim of sexual assault 😢💚
I like how that, despite the fact that you probably had a rough day when you released that video, you remained positive and happy for your kids. I know how hard that is. I have severe anxiety and it’s sooooo hard to be happy for anyone or anything. I don’t have kids but as hard as it is for me to remain happy during anxious times as a single adult with no kids I can only imagine how hard it must be to remain strong in front of your kids when you’re feeling crummy. I’m so sorry about what you went through Jonathan. I’m so happy that you have Anna and the kids to remind you that you’re a great person and Dad and to keep you on your toes and help you get this off your mind.
Alessia seems like such a happy well behaved baby all the time ❤❤
Anna is literally the funniest woman in the world! Love her to bits! I aspire to that woman!!! 💕
Anna couldn't look more beautiful 😍😍
I'm so proud of you for sharing your story. It's so important to open a dialogue for men to discuss their stories too.
Jonathon you helped me with that video you put up as a survivor myself... I admire you so much for speaking up ❤️ I’m coming to see you guys at the baby event at olympia next weekend 😀💙
Hahaha that was the best promotion for innocent 😂 Anna's bianca voice is my fave thing ahhaha amazing!!!
I'm glad you told your mom. I am very sure that the video you posted about your terrible experience helped so many people. You are brave And supported by so many.
Omg lmao Anna's accent for Bianca was everything lol so funny!!!
This video proves that some viewers jump to conclusions way too quick and it proves that no, we viewers don't really know anything because there's so much going on behind the scenes so who are we to speculate. I'm saying this because I was scrolling through the comments of yesterday's video and I saw people being mad about him not telling his mom before putting out the video. So this is for all of you. In your face.
Anna doing the dogs voices is the best. Dying for an episode of the dogs voiced by Anna.
Jonathan I work in an EYFS class and reading a lot at home DEFINITELY helps kids in their school progress! Emilia and Eduardo are both very smart xx
We are all here to support you Jonathan. You were very brave to post the video. Well done Jonathan
how is it that I'm in second year and Emillia and Eduardo have better irish than me ...... lol
Anna’s Bianca voice is hilarious 😆
Suí síos 😂😂😭I love how u teach them some Irish
Wish was as brave like you 😑🤐
Jonathan you are so brave! Anyone who knows you is lucky to have you as a friend
Eduardo is THE sassiest little man and I am in love.
I love love love when Alessia flaps her arms and makes that joyful breathing noise! I just LOVE it and it makes me so happy. #precious
Anna, why don’t you just take an umbrella with you!!
I'm sure your story will help some other people☺. Peace to you.👍
You are such an amazing human Jonathon xxx
I want to see Eduardo take over the vlog for a day!
God Bless you,  Jonathan.  I can tell how hard that was for you to talk about. I was almost sexually assault when I was 6 by a close relative.  I ran away so nothing ever happened,  however it still haunts me every now and then.  It took me years to tell anyone about it. I'm not sure why,  because nothing happened.  I guess I was just ashamed and that it was my fault for trusting this person.  Just know,  that you're not alone.  I've told my husband and kids what happened and the loved me even more.  Im not sure how I would have felt if I hadn't ran away.
I freaking LOVE Bianca and her funny voice and EVERYTHING I can't with Bianca
Out you will feel better....
What a coincidence, I missed these videos because I was on a cruise as well.🛳
I love when Anna voices the dogs 😂😂
OMGosh, I love that exasperated little breathy laugh that Alessia does when she's excited. Its much too cute!! 😍😍\nAwwww, ballet with Daddy!! How fun!! 💚💜💛\nI love the ending, haha!! When you talk for them its hilarious!! The little Bianca knit was so cute too.
It could be the newer food you’re feeding the pups, that’s causing the staining on their faces.
Jonathan  we can all\nappreciate your courage! Your a wonderful example of strength and character. Your family respects and adores you as do hundreds of viewers. So thank-you for your bravery and bringing another truth to the pitiful silence of sexual assault!
I say the darnn with what others think. It helped you and it will help others. The outcome will be way more good from your release. Well done.
First, thank you Jonathan for sharing your story. I’m sure that was incredibly difficult to do and I’m sorry you had to go through that and live with it. Second, my parents are on a cruise in Budapest as well! How funny!
Thanks for the official hand shake Jonathan. Lol😊🙂😄
This world is shit 😐
Irish sounds like a language I can speak called Gaelic
Jonathan is the best!
Anna I think you lost your bonkers hahahaha love you guys
Jonathan you are an amazing man, husband, father and friend to all of us. You are a brave brave man because not any man would have the guts to tell the world something like this. We love and support you. You are amazing because you didnt let this awful experiemce take over your beautiful peronsality, your ability to love and be happy. You are one of the few most amazing husbands a girl could ever want so loving and thoughtful to your wife, kids and friendlist friends !! WE LOVE YOU JONATHAN !!
we love u
Hash tag you cool
#DontCopyEachother lol
💙
Bianca😍
So brave 💗
I know Irish 🇮🇪
Jonathan is such a good dad
Anna was so funny in this vlog, I just love her xxx
I'm so happy that at the start of the video they gave me an answer to my geography homework and we had to know what Budapest was the capital of 😂😂😂
Ur amazing for sharing ur story
anna looks sooooo good!
How funnys the voice 😂
Anna doing bianca is absolutely hilarious 😂😂
Jonathan 💙

I don’t even know what the dislikes are thinking!!! This is so brave of you Jonathan 🌎
Well done for speaking out Johnathon, that can't have been easy to do. Anyone out there who sees this and has someone in their life making them do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell someone, a parent, a friend, a teacher, a sibling, a doctor, anyone and don't stop talking until someone helps you
I AM FROM GERMANY.PLEASE TALk SLOW.LOVE THIS FAMILY.KISSES
Is mise ella!
I was also sexually assaulted at the age of 6 I’m 13 now but I’m just wondering if I ever have kids wether I would tell them, so are you ever going to tell them?
Ok Jonathan. The hungry - Hungary joke is not a good one and not original. Sincerely: a Hungarian person \nLove you though

I am madly in love with your bags! 💖 I also prefer bags that hold their structure, but I never put it on the floor because of a Romanian superstition that says you'll loose your money/become poor if you place your bag on the floor😹. \n\nThe brand Coccinelle is Italian, so you would pronounce it with the ci as if it were ch(like in cheers) and it means ladybug. How sweet is that?! 💖 If it would be a French brand it would be pronounced coxinel.
Your hair! I love it!
love the way you did the video ♥️
That box clutch with music notes on it looks so gorgeous!!
The fringe makes you look Latina!
Did you sell the Chanel chevron square mini? Love that bag!
Coxinel for coccinelle, it's lady bug in french 🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷
Beautiful collection!! Also, your hair looks great!! xxx
that red Chanel bag is so ugly 😟
The fringe fits you so well!! You look so damn chic! Urgh! Loved this video as always (your cutaways are by far the best)
The fringe makes you look even prettier
I came here to see your new beautiful hairstyle❤
Love the hair omg😍❤
Love your hair today, girl !!
You look French with your fringe.
That first bag is super chic and functional!  I'm in search of a good work bag and that one definitely caught my eye
WOW, Love those bangs, makes you look adorable, a blooming teenager.
You suit your fringe so much! I used to have one and they're awesome ❤️
OMG, I'm catching up on your videos and I only noticed the fringe AFTER the 12:37 minutes long video was finished and the thumbnail of the next one clued me in. That is how well you suit the fringe, it's automatically accepted by my brain as perfectly Amelia. Congratulations on getting the perfect fringe.
SUCH a great collection!!
i feel like it's been ages since a sit down video like this, i really loved it, makes me want a designer bag so much 😻😻😻
Love all the bagss they are exactly how i like ❤️❤️
The brand is COCCINELLE! kisses from Italy,Sicily!!
Love your Multi Jumper, so cosy and cuddly.   Fave bag out of the ones you have is the Black Gucci 🖤  (p.s. Loved the yellow/gold 3 tier dress you wore in Paris).
Your handbag collection is so whimsical! Lovely! Thanks for sharing.
Love the new haircut it suits you 😍👍🏻
I was just thinking how badly I'd love to see an updated designer handbag collection! Literally read.my.mind! ((:
Your new fringe looks greattttt on you!
That multicolour knit jumper looks INCREDIBLE on you! Love that vibe. I'm surprised you don't use a cover for your glasses.
wow beautiful collection. btw what is the name of you nail polish color? its so beautiful.
That fringe is 😍😍😍 you look amazing.
A little bit jealous and a big happy for u~ LOL
I love the fringe on you!! Can you please tell us the lipstick you are wearing in this video?
I live in NY and I am always nervous to take nice bags out during the day.... BUT that givenchy bag is soon stunning! <3 <3
What size laptop can you fit in the Givenchy Antigona Bag?
Hi Amelia , please can  you let me know where the Mac/ trench coat is from that you are wearing with the Gucci Marmont ? Thanks
Hey Amelia, i know this isnt your kind of thing but could u pls consider doing a bridal makeup look? Im getting married in dec and i love the way you do makeup. Basically i love everything about you!
Always love your bag collection!
Coccinelle is an italian brand, it means ladybugs! We pronounce it co - chi (same sound of chips) nell - eh \n(some people do not pronounce it the same way they pronounce the italian word for lady bugs and they say co - chi - nell with a silent e and I have no idea why, it makes me want to email the brand and ask them!)
Coccinelle was founded in Italy, so the Italian pronounciation would be like tagliatelle in the end, and the cci is pronounced like chi in tai chi.
Loved this video and your hair!!!
If I ever won the lottery I would buy every bag in this video\n😂😂😂
I giggled when you said you own few green clothes while you were actively wearing a similar blue green top, though you may have done that on purpose
Great video ..... your petrol Gucci bag is size small and the pink one is the mini ....  I have the new royal blue velvet Gucci bag in the medium size and it's quite a bit bigger than yours 🌟🖒
Hi :) in english it would be something like kotcheenaellae\n\nIt's italian, and it means ladybugs!
Your hair looks so good 😍 It suits you very much.
Where is your black dress from!?
Not a fan of the bangs
Overrated handbags
I was in love with your hair :( . Your handbag collection is life ! Sooo good pieces
Drooling over your bags!!! :)
Oh, no! Your fringe looks like mine, that I made myself when I was 8... Please, change it!
I feel somebody is not a fan of valentino.. don’t blame you 😂
They seem very cheap
You should be put on a desk, have your legs spread, and fucked *hard* but long, thick meat.
Which youtube executive did you bang to get on trending?
This got 40k views in 21hours how the fuck is this on trending??????
Of all the marmonts you went for the worst solid colour bag...
Omg the fringe is everything!!
It's pronounced Coxinelle (in french coccinelle means ladybug)
By 'tried on' she means 'held' 😂😂😂
Hi Amelia  hope you're well. This is an impressive collection. So beautiful!! Still not sure about the fringe. One minute I think it's beautiful next unsure. You're still beautiful anyway. As long as you're happy.\nLove from the states
what size is ur MacBook air? <3
Your hair is much classier like way! Well done for improving yourself and taking on constructive criticism
shoe collection???
That was so Awesome and funny.  I liked how he said this was in the future.  My favorite was when it first switch to Rey.
Chewbacca's face actually looks raw and unfinished
lol!!! i love how he shouts out Whaaat?!!! and that laugh
2:44 ''How about in the ground'' LMAO
Gordan Ramsey is super pissed at how raw this trailer is.
This is a good gimmick you have here. Might as well have Kylo Ren reactions to various trailers and commercials; including outside of the Star Wars franchise...if you can let us vote or decide in the comments sections then you can draw real hype to this channel.
What's christmas? Lost it. XD
this is my new favorite thing on the internet
I thought Kylo would be a Reylo shipper. In the ground not in my bed?
Please let *_RAW_* turn into a meme
I'm more excited for the new Jedi Party than the actual movie
Is that Adam Driver?  I can't tell the difference lol
These are the greatest videos ever 👍
Hey a good idea for the future would be to do a 10 things that would make star wars better like you did with the hobbit
Star Raws:  The Last Jedi
I can't wait for Kylo to see Blade Runner 2049 and go you're still alive!?
The Suicide Girls at the end....so raw!
I really  enjoy  the Kylo  Ren, I  would  to  see  how  the Hitler reaction  to the Last Jedi  is going  to be  like.
THIS STEAK IS SO RAW, SUPREME LEADER SNOKE WANTS TO TRAIN IT TO USE THE FORCE!
What the hell man, relax.
How about in the ground? Lol 😂 (extends hand) what!?? Hahaha
The Auralnauts are 100%  Absolutely Positively Without a Doubt Certified Midichlorified Gugu Mbantha-RAW!\nWhat's Christmas? Lol\nAlso, is that Baby Time playing in the credits?
This shit is so fucking good holy fuck! CLASSIC!!! THUMBS UP!!
The only react videos that matter are from Kylo.
These vids never cease to get a giggle from me lol 😂
I'm so raw!!!
2:48 is the part you want to see.
This reaction is raw
I need someone to show me my place...\n*points to the kitchen*
This video was so RAW
I hope he still reacts to stuff unrelated to Star Wars after Star Wars is over.
It's baby time
I'm really disappointed that weenie doesn't seem to be in his helmet for most of the movie.
“I need someone to show me my place in all of this...”\n\n“How bout in the ground?”\n\nLost it.
Who is that handsome devil? lol
I hope the BlueRay will also include the *raw cut* when it comes out
I heard lady Gaga really liked this trailer. In fact, she said it was raw raw raw raw  rawwwww.
Chewy is Da Best HAHAHAHA That is All
It's baby time!
How about in the ground?\n\nKylo should have went super savage and said How about in the kitchen?
Ask Charlie Brown. He'll tell you what Christmas is.
Hey Kylo just so you know Star Wars The Last Jedi will be the darkest film of all Star Wars movies just like Empire Strikes Back. So that means the First Order is going to win in this film. I think you will be impressed with this new Star Wars movie Kylo.😀
*chef Ramsay does not approve of this*
We need a Kylo Stimpy 'cos Ren needs a friend.
That was a good evil laugh there.
My helmet is like my favorite thing ever-kylo ren me too, me too kylo
His laugh at the end is killing me.\n\nWHAAT?! HAHAHAHAH!!!
I'm glad you like it Kylo
You should make videos of Kylo watching other trailers other than Star Wars. 👍🏽
1:43 LOL YOU KILLED ME
that was raw
Kylo Ren is a fucking fag
Everything is RAW!!!
please have Kylo review Blade Runner.
WELCOME EVERYONE......TO MONDAY NIGHT RAW!!!!
raw
What's Christmas
I'M SO RAW....and i exploded lol

FIRST
Ilove 💋Miss 💋U You😍
first
Can you make a mental health video on self harm i know it’s a touchy subject but Ik some people go through it including myself thanks
Ily Dan, you're amazing. Can relate  to this so much. If you've ever had any experience with anxiety, or even self harm that'd be something I'd appreciate hearing about. Hope things progress and get even better for you xx
Teenage girl w/ Anxiety here! :D so happy that Dan posted about this.
thanks for sharing Dan! sending u good vibes from this here fellow depression corner
We're always here for you :)
I was just sad about some family issue and this video made me feel better 😊\nThanks, Dan
Thank you for helping me explain my depression because honestly its so similar to this video
I had a weird dream about you today.... I guess it's a sign that your latest video is this:)
I have ptsd and depression and  anxiety so I know what your going thought
Thank you for sharing this. I'm 31 and have had serious depressive episodes since I was 9. Mine seems strongly biological (I also have a bipolar uncle!). I've been on antidepressants since I was 15, and I'll probably be on them for my entire life. I'm okay with that, though. I've had to take allergy medicines since I was too young to swallow pills, so a life with medicine is normal to me. I've also seen therapists, but they did squat for me when I wasn't on medicine. Everybody's experience is different, though. I also tend to have the kind of depression where I feel sad and cry a lot, and get clingy. Most people seem to feel nothing and withdraw, but I feel actively terrible during my episodes.
How does anyone start therapy or how do you know that something is wrong? Because sometimes I feel like that, so bad and dark and in the cloud of misery but then whenever it eventually ends I feel like I'm overreacting and that wasn't as bad as I thought it was. And sometimes I think I need a therapist or something but I don't think I could ever bring it up to my parents because I think they would be like what do you mean you're fine or they'd take me and it'd turn out I was actually overreacting
i actually cried, i feel proud of dan???? \nbut this video kinda helped me..so thank you dan.
I just want to say I'm really proud of you for being brave enough to share your story; it was inspiring and uplifting for someone struggling to admit I need help. Thank you for being who you are.
I love you so much
So when I am feeling that way I have a really weird thing I tell to myself.\n\nWhen you fall into a black hole in your life do like batman in the dark knight rises. As much as it hurts, as much as you have to try, try again and again until you get out to make the world a better place.\n\nIt's stupid but it makes me feel better...
Thank you Dan. This has really helped me realize or further realize how I can assist my friends and boyfriend with their mental illnesses. It has also helped me personally with realizing I cannot completely save them or make their depression go away which I have struggled with for a long time since I so dearly want them to be happy and not have to go through this. So thank you so much
I'm so proud of you
Thank you for addressing the subject and getting me through some of my lowest depression points love you Dan
I’m 13 and my doctor thinks I should be on antidepressants with anti anxiety properties but I’m scared because I don’t want to turn into a different person which I think is a side affect help plz
Wait, what is Dan's other job?
I'd be careful telling people (especially YOURSELF) that antidep meds are just for temp use.  Some people just have a fixed internal chemistry they don't like, and medication for some can be a useful lifetime-long tool for managing it.  Just for reference, this bit of wisdom is coming from a non-depressed strongly-ADHD schizoaffective, so you can factor that in or out of my advice on a condition I don't have....
Thank you so much for making this.
Danny boy I really appreciate your openness and honesty about this topic! It's really important to increase awareness of and normalize mental health issues because they really are quite common and a lot of the time people have them without realizing it. The stigmas are awful and it's really uplifting to see a person whom I look up to talk about these issues. I love you so much and please continue to be the sensitive, aware, and wonderful person you are.
May your light keep shining.
This was such a wonderful and honest video. I'm someone who's dealt with mental health issues since I was a kid, and depression is one of the things I've had to work through and continue to work through. Thank you for sharing your story Dan. It really means a lot to hear you speak so honestly about your own struggles with depression, and I'm so glad that you are in a good place in your life now!
Thanks for sharing this Dan. It takes a lot of strength to share something as personal as this. I'm glad you have conquered this part of your life. I hope you know that we all support and love you!!!!
I dont take antidepressants,i have a psd (psychiatric service dog) to help me with all my invisible disabilities
thank u dan foruploading this video this is so importanat to peopel who stuggle with depression like myself. When i was depressed i tried to openly discuss it with someone and they didnt seem to give a shit and i have no friends to shar my feelings with. One day i had cut myself mz teacher found out and called my mother and they both yelled at me which made me feel evenmore like shit and now i feel like im so alone and have no one 2 share me feeling with and ihave been bullied before and no one seem 2 understand that (sorry for english im german and i struggle with learning english)
Sometimes, I think I got through it, other times I feel like life doesn't need me, but I know that's not correct, I need to force myself to not do hurtful things. I take baths and breathing exercises to help me.
dan, I totally know how you feel, I'm not just saying this but I just got out of the mental ward for clinical depression and I'm not just ok yet but you are strong and so am I, well get threw this
You are a beautiful, beautiful human being just thought you should know
I'm very proud of the comments on this video. These comments are one of the most positive reactions to mental illnesses that I have seen
Happy 8 years of making YouTube videos
When I feel low, I dance to music for exercise. It's actually the easiest way for me to exercise so it's a win for me. Singing also lifts my mood up.
Honestly about to show this to everyone I know.
Thank you for sharing your life with all of us. We all love and care for you. I have close friends that have struggled with depression and anxiety and you definitely shed a light into this state of mind. I’m glad Phil is there for you too just as much as we are all here for you.
it sucks that you have depression but all the fans are here to help you
only dan can still be funny when talking about depression
Antidepressant squad where you at, I've been on them for a few years.
literally the exact same thing for me, m8. depression makes me a fuckin shell.
It would be a shame if some fell in your mouth I'm fucking dead. Thank you so much for this Dan
The it's okay he won't get offended was the most beautiful thing I've seen
last year i was bullied by my own friend and she even talked bad about me in front of me and it lead me to cry for the rest of the day my teachers asked me if i was okay but i denyed and said i was okay but i wasnt. someone i trusted bullied me she lead me to crying my eyes out in the middle of class and waited until i left to get a drink from th water fountain she assisted everyone jobs for our project and didnt even help me with the project and i did it all myself and she embarrassed me and took my best friend away from me and i tried to tell her she was taking her away from me but she didnt believe me. thats the story of my life yay!
This comment is not intended to stray away from the serious topic of this video, but goodness gracious. Dan is already good looking, BUT HE LOOKED EXTRA GOOD IN THIS VIDEO. LIKE, OH MY GOSH HE IS A BEAUTIFUL MAN. Anyway, I support Dan going through this in every way, shape, and form. ❤
basically everyone has a mental illness everyday
Thank you so much for making this video x
Daniel, thank you so much for this video. I honestly thought what I was feeling was normal, Thank you, thank you, thank you! This video is giving me the push to look more into my mental health
Daniel, thank you for making this. Just watching this video, after sleeping in until midday, has kickstarted my self-care train. This video, and your courage, is so important. Thank you for sharing this. Thank you. ❤
Amazing video. Very relatable. \nMaybe I'll make a video about my story one day...\nAlso your bonsai is almost dead
I’m making my way through my own journey with depression and honestly this line you said is something I’ve been trying to explain for years, “I don’t want it to be an excuse because it isn’t who I am.” Just hearing someone put it into words that were clear and understandable for anyone brought me close to tears. So thank you for continuing to create the content you do. So here’s a reminder for you: What you’re doing here is important and you have an effect on people. So thank you.
When you said that you didn't people to see it as an excuse, I totally relate to that.
Thank You Dan! I have been going through similar problems and I really needed this, Thank You So Much!
I liked this video right away but as soon as he said excersice i almost disliked
it took a long time for me, from a very young age, but when I finally identified it for what it was (it felt like a niggling doubt, like there was something wrong with me? like a bruised apple in the supermarket) I put a lot of effort into finally understanding it. I would wander out of the house in my early teens and memorize roads, and the walking hurt but I got better and better at it. during those walks, I would just kind of meditate, and it was a lot like painstakingly climbing out of the hole you described. it wasn't a cure, but it helped ground me. it's hard, living day to day, and sometimes I slip up, but it's important to remember that, Idk. you're not a bruised supermarket apple, and again, it can get better. this was sweet
Thank you for sharing this, I'm so glad things are better for you now 💗
are you kidding mate i can not for the life of me talk about my brain in any way at all to a person no matter what like dude that shit is really scary
i put off watching this for a while, but im so glad i did, this video beautifully articulates the illness. thank you danny boy, i appreciate you and everything you do very, very much. 💞💞💞\nive been struggling with GAD and depression since i was quite young, and it was only when i was 18 that i finally started to pursue help. im currently trying to find what medications and dosages work for me.
It often starts during childhood or adolescent days because of what we call identity role(though not all people have the same reasons as this like Dan having clinical depression). Best way to overcome is really just to seek someone who you can trust fully and devote yourself. It is where you can learn to have self-esteem(well some ppl don't) but having someone you can hold on to will slowly help you get better as you grow.
I'm finally going off of my own antidepressants.
this video helped me a lot... strangely I can relate... I just had a talk with my mom about my depression for the first time after watching this... I know Dan will most likely never see this but if he does, Dan thank you so much for being brave to post this, talking to us on YouTube, and just being there...
I've been dealing with depression since I was eight and I'm fifteen now. Fell into depression the moment mom said she divorced my dad. Then I fell deeper into depression. Still in depression.
Thank you for talking about this Dan 💜
Don't worry. If you wake up feeling like you're in a black hole, it means you're a singularity. ;)
a month without uploading is a normal thing now
he’s so cute
Thank you so much for this video Dan I relate so much to most of these things you said in this video. Thank you for your honestly. You made me feel less alone with all this shit in my head ❤️
Dan you're so inspiring :) \nI have some mental health issues too, like mild agoraphobia, anxiety and some slight depression. It's because of my disability, 22Q and it kinda really sucks a lot. \nBut I've been getting through it, and I've been the best I've been in years. \nThings DO get better. Always just remember that, people who have depression. :)
MM WHEN YOU GETTING HATE FOR TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HOW SOMEONE SAVED YOUR LIFE LIKE OMG CAN YALL STOP BEING CLOSE MINDED AND OPEN A FUCKING WINDOW LIKE THIS BITCH MEANS A FUCKING LOT TO ME ALRIGHT THIS IS DANS YOUTUBE VIDEO THESE COMMENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TRUTHFUL AND SUPPORTING NOT GIVING HATE FOR SOMETHING YOU DONT THINK IS TRUE ALRIGHT DAN SAVED MY LIFE GET THE FUCK OVER IT
Depression is like feeling empty or having a void in your chest. I feel this nearly all the time
Today isn't my birthday. My mom isn't dying. I'm not going to ask out my crush. I'm just a sad person looking for a few thousand likes and maybe a comment from Dan.
I personally have depression and it's been so difficult to deal with that I was and still am cutting my arms... It hurts but I just do it anyway.. I was so depressed one day where I just didn't get up for school...
When he said Yup! Ya daddy! I chocked on my cereal 😂 Dan always manages to make me smile and laugh out loud 😂❤
I think that it's really amazing for you to be able to open up about this topic Dan. I was depressed for 8 years some days were better than others during that time period in my life but I was never fully happy I felt so horrible, hopeless, and useless. So I can definitely sympathize with what you're going through and even though I consider myself to be better than what I was I can bounce back into depression fairly easily but I've finally found a group of people that are supportive and I've never had anyone like that in my life before. Unfortunately, I never tried to get help... but honestly I should have. Sometimes I wonder how different things would've turned out for me or if maybe I would've been able to get to this point in my life sooner but I guess I'll just never know if that's the case. I really do hope that things continue going well for you. Never give up cause you never truly fail until you quit trying,
Damn. I never thought that I'd be able to relate to someone that I'm so different from.
I'm pretty sure that's a flower vase you're drinking out of
why am i the only person who hasnt had depression yet
Thanks for having the courage to be so open about it. Helped a lot even though I'm not depressed anymore.
Good for you in saying how far you've come and how you hope to keep moving forward. I can relate to feeling like my emotions are normal and realizing, Nope, I need serious help.
I'm so glad you told us!
I feel angry all the time and idek why 😫😤
Wait is this the reason Dan bought running shoes and got a gym membership??
thank you
Love you

Im so proud of him for posting this <3
I have had depression ever since 6th grade and I am in high school now. I take strong antidepressants and I also had a therapist ever since 6th grade and it was honestly a very tiring and interesting journey to find out who I really was as a teenager. I found out my true identity in 8th grade and I am still trying to find out the rest of me nowadays. I am a teenager that loves physiology and enjoys seeking the concept of life XD
I dropped my iPad on my nipple and it cleared my browser history

Me and my freinds ploted a plan to excape the school in sports day. Me and my friend hate that day cause you just do running. So here's the plan. We would go to the bathroom without anyone knowing.We did this when the hole class room was noisy. So you would wait inside the bathrooms untill everyone got out side the school and into the playground. Then we are pretty much free inside a school. The next part is when it's exactly 1:58 we would go down the stairs sneek into the bushes near the place we're they would run and go to our group tents. That was the plan. We tried to do that but they um found us in the bathroom so FAIL.

Make a video about german chickens
Do the history of the United States.
Did anybody catch the fidget spinner at 27 seconds
Still surprised no random blood stains on Periw-\nPeriwinkle: Oh no there's one here!!! *Points to corner of shirt* See??????? Oh and did you call???
I feel like most of Bill's content accurately describes my brain when I stay awake until 5:30 in the morning. Don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
i love how these videos are made out of pure boredom
These keep getting better and better

I am clean now.

oh no it’s a natural disaster
I am now convinced that bill wurtz is a computer program that is coded to be perpetually on drugs and also to make videos, does anyone else think that? Is there anyone else here? Are you all actually robots?!? Am I a robot? I don't know anymore..... but now I have a sudden urge to scrub myself with soap while singing the song piano man...... how quaint.
I love it when soap tastes better
we have religions about soap.

hhhhhhhhhhhhHHEYWHATSOAPYOUGUYS, YES
This band is too cute.
Zac back in the band should be reason enough to any atheist to start believing in God. hahahah \nMy love for this band only increased, and I listen to them simply since they started. That perfect divine melodic and energetic vibe remains in the band independently of any circunstancies the band go through or any new ideas they add. It can only come from God. I actually was growing up as they were also growing up, so you can understand how important they are for me. And notice, I am a person who thinks it's very unhealthy to idolize any artist, so you can see how much my love for this band is not just a teenager idol hysteria thing. hahahah I'm not even a teen anymore. Lol\nGod bless Paramore.
LOOK AT THESE NERDS, THEY'RE SO CUTE
Jaja I love the song
didn't know they could make me laugh while singing such sad lyrics
m y   c h i l d r e n

Lisa looking gangsta with all those rings 😄. Love this makeup look. It isn’t easy working on mature eyes but I think the trick is not to overthink it. This smokey eye still works 👍🏾
Gorgeous!!  Both of u!!  Thank you for sharing this moment in time with us!!
Great video, thank you so much for sharing this! You both are gorgeous & talented. It's wonderful to see two extremely successful women supporting each others work. LOVE!! One minor point, pizza cutter?!? How 'bout modified ball-point pen instead? <
What a lovely guest and a wonderful surprise!  A favorite of mine since the 80's!  Beautiful...
LOL I hit like before even watching!
Please please do rose makeup look from titanic... You seem to know exactly what celebrities use for their roles and real life.. I wana know what Kate used in makeup as rose and what hair colour was used and hair cut... Please do that video!!!!
I'm pretty decent with makeup but if I tried that dark of a smoky eye omg I would be a mess! Seriously talented! Goals dramatic but still minimal
2 wonderful women sharing a wonderful moment with us! Thank you ladies you’re both so inspirational.
Claudia had a few Chelsea Handler angles for me in this...
So beautiful! Loved the quick questions
She´s an archangel.
Make up look with Liu Wen, please! There are not so many make up tutorials with asian beauties. It'll be amazing!
Love how Claudia allows her face to have frown lines and crows feet, instead of botoxing everything away like what happens in Hollywood. Ageless beauty!
I have been waiting my entire life for this.Thank you thank you thank you.I love you Claudia
I didn't think Claudia would be like this, I have never really seen her talk much before. She seems really smart, down to earth and just a cool chick to hang out with. Great tutorial.
I love the 60s looks! Claudia has the most fantastic skin...stunning!
I love all the great 90s supermodels....! wow! despite the fact that they´re older now, they are still so stunning! Bravo, Claudia and Lisa!
Such a cute video!
Brigitte Bardot is a beautiful woman but let's not forget she's also a keen racist.
She still looks like an angel. That skin!!
Yep! As I suspected, Lisa's rings reproduce
Hi Lisa, I really enjoyed this with Claudia, I’m a massive fan. I also made a video the other day on Claudia too. It’s part of my female icons series - I would be thrilled if you could comment and watch it. I’m a massive fan of you and have been following your work for a number of years which has inspired me to go into makeup myself. My YouTube channel is Laura Gask. Thank you for your time.
just look at this beautiful creature =) no botox and fillers... just plain gorgeous in and out ..   the most beautiful woman in the world!
Anyone know where Lisa’s rings are from?
Do you have a new ring or two?
Claudia looks so sweet such a kind person
Yes, what a treat! My fave model of all time with the best makeup artist ever!
She is the most beautyful creature in the world. I adore claudia🌹❤️. Thankeyou, Lisa
It's such a joy for me to see Claudia's make-up being applied, and it's also a treat to see how *even more* exquisite she has grown over the years :) It is hard for me to quantify 'why' and 'how', but maturity really does enhance one's beauty; perhaps it is the lack of self-consciousness or the ease of one's smile... I'm not sure. But whether our friends and family would describe us as beautiful, interesting, or even kind is not so much the point as living a good and honest life ― a life of love, generosity and spiritedness ― I firmly believe that this shows in our appearance :)
I saw one of the OG Supermodels, I clicked
OMG how do you get one of the biggest supermodels of all time in your video?
Black eyelashes and blond hair... isn't it weird?
Funny intro! Really loved the energy between you two Lisa. I did notice the new ring additons. They are so beautiful. Always wondering where you find those dashing rings.
I gave away a fragrance by Agent Provocateur to a free box.  ehehehehehehe
What a goddess she is
Once the Top Supermodel in the World, some 25 years ago.
I really love how she is ageing gracefully.
Omg one of my favorite supermodel. She's the perfect Bardot.💕
Wow, she seems so sweet , nice and authentic!
this is a beautiful makeup tutorial and really fast haha I love all of the colours and you are my favourite YouTuber.
I slept with my makeup on last night. Take me out back and shoot me. :D
My younger brother was IN LOVE with Claudia Schiffer back in the day-she is still stunning and I just love her imperfectly beautiful teeth!,
Lisa Eldrigdge's videos are the only makeup tutorials I need and want to see. Love your work!
If only I could sleep in my makeup and look like Claudia when I wake up!
Lisa!!!! thanks SO much for featuring the original supermodels like Yasmin Le Bon and Claudia! Just what I needed after a hard week :D
oh Claudia is lovely isn't she - so articulate, warm and gorgeous  xxxxx
Beauty really comes from within...
Whoa Lisa is taking to the next level . Love Claudia . She's perfect !
Omg Claudia Schiffer is my favorite model ever since I was a little girl.
OMG her skin is flawless i can't believe this.. another lovely collab!
I love how you are bringing back the legendary 90s supermodels. First it was Yasmin and now it's Claudia. Gosh.. I can't wait to see who you'll invite next!
You should re do the Vogue Cover again. Maybe in an updated version! Could be so cool :D
She is such a beauty, and you make her look even more beautiful!
I LOVE HER RINGS
I'm creeped out look at our last names
I'm pleasantly surprised at how natural Claudia looks! She clearly hasn't had work done but looks amazing! A great example to women.
Hi Lisa love love love your tutorials 😗😗😗😗😗😗. Thank you for making makeup so easy and bringing such an icon on your chanel.
OMG I loved that funny voice at the start LOL
Beautiful Claudia! Natural beauty. She is my fav model . 😘
I love this video Lisa!! Claudia is timeless!!
Could you please make a tutorial of the Gal Gadot Wonder Woman makeup?
She looks so similar to Chelsea handler lol
Lisa doing the Queen's make up probably: Look at me, darling.
Looved the video! The makeup was perfect for Claudia. Loved the lip liner and lipstick!
A Real Beauty !! AT LAST !!! So there are some women in the business that they are not botoxed up their heads! Impessive!!!
I Loke your ring from where you got it
I absolutely loved this video. MY QUEEEEENS.
The original supermodels have not aged, they are goddesses x
She looks sooooooo gorgeous like she was born to do this makeup. wow
youtubers should take tutorials from Lisa. Look how little makeup she needs compared to all the beautygurus !
she looks natural, no botox, no porcelain on teeth.
She’s prettier now than she was 20 years ago!
When does the book release?
Love you both,  but this time what stole my heart was the lipstick. OMG. The whole look, as obvious, it’s stunning.
Watching this video has made my day. Thank you Lisa!!
Of course it's gorgeous!  So sad that Claudia's makeup is not available in the US :-(
Thank you for sharing the video, Lisa! I love how Claudia is so natural & classy and looking after herself after 30 years in fashion. She is comfortable & confident in herself that she doesn't mind showing us her lines, which we all have!!! Great to see her amazing self after being her fan for 25 years!!! Love Claudia!!!! XOXO
Can we just PAUSE FOR THE CAUSE!!!! Claudia effin Schiffer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I really appreciated seeing Claudia as she is, a beautiful 47-year-old woman without filters. Absolutely lovely, and spectacular makeup, again, by Lisa. Thank you - perfection!
Claudia 😍😍😍
Lisa: Thank you!
💜💜💜💜💜
Thoroughly enjoyable, Lisa!

€10,000 raised for charity? That's amazing Lisa! I'm going to go back and watch all your videos + adverts again ❤
Hi Lisa, where do you get your rings? I have been obsessed with them since I started watching your videos! x
Lisa, I love your channel, but your content feels skewed. I’d love to see more women of color (and darker skinned models) featured. Not to do so seems tone deaf to all that’s going on in the world. Thanks.
you have amazing taste, and i love the format of this video!!!
Such a beautiful and peaceful home <3
your home vid is beautiful. Also you hair is so pretty and curly.  Your curly style is back! :)
Wtf... feels like just yesterday I found your yt; a beautiful, bubbly, shy girl beauty guru. Now your this chic and inspiring #mumgoals. Love this vid Sam, hope you're having a blessed day Luv!
Our styles are incredibly different, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed both rooms. I've only been watching you for a month, but that office really seems like a great representation of you. The living room is more my speed and it does indeed look cozy and comfortable. If you don't mind me saying this, but your toddler and your husband are just beautiful. Very gorgeous family.
Amaaazing home, amazing style!!
you seem very passionate about decorating... made it enjoyable to watch! lovely space!
I was under about that blue sofa at first but it really came together and now I love it in that space! Defiantly gives me some inspiration!
I really enjoy decorating and find it very therapeutic as well. Where do you find most of your inspiration? Do you have any recommendations for interior design books?
I love ur home I want it lol
Loved the rooms!! What a great style you have. Also loved the sit down chatty bit... more please?!
I love the office decor so much!
oh my god i love every part of this
love your top and jean combo, esp the top
One word comes to my mind : goals
Amazing idea, loved the video!!
Simply beautiful and cozy !  Thanks for sharing your home with us.
Because of you, Sammi....I will be shopping for plants next week!! LOL.
I love this format!
Absolutely loved it! Such an inspirational video
Also the sofa for me is a winner :-)
Beautifully filmed. Thank you for sharing with us xx
The video was so beautifully shot
This video made me smile, what a beautiful home you have Samantha! So cozy, fresh, and warm
Such a pretty home.
You look so beautiful!! Loved this style of video. Please do more. (:
Hey Samantha where did u get your cup 'the one with ur tea/ coffee in the video?
Omg I love your style goals I one day dream of having a beautiful home like yours 😍🏡
what happened to Riley...the other dog?
good god you look GORGEOUS in the intro! also your interior style is to die for!
Such a great video! Your home is gorgeous and i really like the format as well.
So fun! Your home is beautiful, can't wait for more videos about it :)
Random thought but your fringe kind of looks like a bob and I think you'd look really pretty with a curly bob
Sammi Id like to request a video regarding financial management after marriage. How do you manage to budget? Do you combine your income? Or does Jason lets you do the budgeting around the house? You do not have to include figures, more on tips and when there are problems regarding financially how you and Jason handle it @samanthamaria
Haven't watched for awhile,  beautiful home.  What happened to her Frenchie?
I love love love your home decor design, the sofa is beautiful and all the plants and prints 😍😍😍
love the space. And OMG your hair look's amazing!
What collar is frank wearing? Love it. Is it ruffwear?
Love this ! Keep continuing what you do I love chit chat
i wanna be as cozy as frank
As someone who's been watching you since '08, I am super proud of you and your accomplishments! Also, I know you are human and don't want to attract negativity and drama, but girl. You gotta be unapologetically yourself! Say what you wanna say. You're going attract haters no matter what you do/say. Let em talk (type really), cuz at the end of the day, you're still making your money, you're still a great youtuber (and a veteran youtuber on top of that), and you're still a bomb ass mom! Don't let them control your actions, especially online. Changing what you say and limiting your voice is exactly what the haters want.
Loved, loved, loved this format. Your spaces are beautiful and you can see all the love that's been put into your home.
Love you house and your interior design.. you so lovely
Love this style of video Sammi  xo
this vid is so relaxing and interesting and YOU LOOK STUNNING
Your home is beautiful and yes..very relaxing.
Where's Riley?? Did he pass? :(
I found myself nodding in agreement throughout the whole video lol!! You get me! Love your style in everything but your home is especially beautiful <3
Can you please Vlogg more about your workouts! i need motivation thanks
Can anyone recommend me some good home decor books please? I need this style in my life😻
I love this format Sammi and your space is amazing!! xx
That couch is everything!!
You look so pretty sam! And your house is gorgeous
I would love loads of plants in the living room but they would just die lol. I love this room it looks amazing :) x
I feel like I stepped into a magazine watching this. This is great Sam, I always thought you had an amazing sense of style. Also, I loved the fact that you weren't just walking around with a camera showing us random stuff. I quite like your sit downs
I absolutely love this style of video and love your home xxxx
i like this style of videos. please do the rest of the house like this xx
Sammi I feel like we could be such great friends irl! You have such a sweet personality and I love your style!! 😊😊
Love this format Sam! It's wonderful. It is different than most room tours! This is creative! Love to see more rooms from your home.
I love your space! both rooms that you showed are beautiful! I just moved into my own apartment and will definitely be taking a little bit of inspiration from this video regarding my interior style :)
This is such a beautifully shot video Sammi! I feel like you got the perfect balance between sit- down chatty parts, and shots of the rooms on their own. Can't wait for more! x
super cozy! but where is riley? :(
The living room looks like a photo you would see in an interior magazine and be like, where is that? I wanna live there it looks so dreamy😊 i also love your filming room and i find this so inspirational
You have amazing interior style Sammi! Loved this ❤️
I always felt asking for a tour is too invasive, so I never ask but I am so excited for this! I noticed in your vlogs, the mantle in the living room and the way you style it with the plants and mirror...simply stunning😍
Hi Sam,Indie and Jason. I've been a viewer of yours since day one and so proud of you! You are amazing and one hell of a badass mum. I appreciate all your honestly and realness.\nIt's very refreshing! \nSo question for you. \nI just moved house as well and have a 4 year old daughter. Im using your decor as inspiration for my new place. Just wondering what wall colour did you use for your office and livingroom. Lots of love from Canada.
Oh my it's absolutely perfect !!
Love the format! And the chilled vibe. Much love!
Such a cuddle couch, I love!
Love the vibe of your place and the video- very chill and cool~ any chance you'll restock your candle in the near future?
I love your home 😍
I love your eclectic style! So sophisticated yet at the same time homey and inviting!
Love the style of both rooms; warm and cosy 😍... u should become an interior designer 😉
I love how well thought out this video was, super different and creative. Always enjoy your videos <3
Your style is so nice! I have a very similar style too
Ugh! Please come and sort out my flat!
I loved the video and the format is just fine.  It felt very personal.  I love your style and I too would love a botanical vibe BUT my cats destroy every plant!!!! : ) xo\n\nNatoya
I love interior design too! The rooms look so calm and clean!!!
omg so inspiring! Love you and your family so much <3 Could you do a video about how to style small spaces? I have a one bedroom apartment and have no room for an actual office but still want to have an office space. Help! <3
Both spaces were to die for! Love your style Sammi, and the way that the video was filmed was great too!💙💜💛
What a refreshing house tour style video! Love the format, can't wait to see more! 😍
Initially when I saw the sofa when it was first delivered (I think in one of the vlogs?), I liked it but thought it didn't go with anything and stood out too much... but now I see it in the fully realised room, it just looks like its been there forever! It goes amazing with all the greens and yellows in the room! Such a stunning living room!
Loved it! I’m decorating my apartment and this helped me so much. x
Stunning home!! Where did you find the chair you're sat on in the office tour??
So... where is Riley??? Didn't see him for so long :(
I feel like i could just walk into your home and go to sleep. It looks so relaxing.
Beautifully edited! Loved the format everything from the music to camera shots. The living room definitely has that botanical vibe to it! xx
I like the dressing of your fireplace a lot, especially with the green around it.
Yasssss Sam!!! Loving this your house is beautiful!! Me and my partner have just moved into our first home so this inspo is much needed!! Xxx

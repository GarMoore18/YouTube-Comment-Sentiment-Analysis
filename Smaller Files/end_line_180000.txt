nice veiw of the BROWN Yarra River, a river in which dead bodies are found frequently.
Australian shops are required to give a price per 100 sheets for toilet paper. You're welcome
Tmi guess but who gives a crap? (Lol) Aw man i think I'm the exact opposite on my tp preferences lol I HATE charmin (the bear brand) because it's tooo soft and falls to pieces. Literally. Tmi but I stg I was at my parent's house (they buy charmin) and hours later I found pieces of tp still there. I feel so damn unclean. I actually much prefer the terrible public-bathroom tp over that stuff. Least it doesn't fall apart! (I usually go with the 1ply cotonelle, it's strong and does it's job) \n\nGod, why do Vlogbrother's videos make me feel like oversharing so much lmao sorry 😂💩🐻🚽
Satin is a way of weaving so your sheets could have been satin made out of cotton! Though that's unlikely, it's possible.\nAlso a nice hotel should have enough budget for nice toilet paper. I've been to mediocre hotels that had nice toilet paper!
No bidet's? What are you? Common savages?
Do Australians just have iron butts? Well... yes.
You should have wiped your butt with those bed sheets.. thatll make a statement and hopefully the hotel owner takes the hint and improves the quality of the toilet paper :)
I think there's a GMM episode in which they determine the best toilet paper. If that helps you shopping ^^
I saw you at VidCon Australia
It's not your butt cheeks it's your inter gluteal cleft... I learned that from crash course... I'm like 90% sure that's where I learned it from... but I may be wrong.
Reminds me of that old game, toilet tycoon simulator. In this game you operate a commercial restroom and people pay you money to go take a dump basically. As you earn money you can upgrade different elements of your toilets like the bowl and the paper. You start with regular toilet paper, then you get the extra fluffy stuff and at some point people are wiping their bums with silk. I remember the highest toilet paper level is Minx Fur. \n\nI'm not making this up, this is a real game.
Buy a portable bidet! Problem solved. This is the one I got. Works really well:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Brondell-GS-70-GoSpa-Travel-Bidet/dp/B008CSDKSQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1505791651&sr=8-4&keywords=portable+bidet
Dear Hank, \nI was very sad when I found out that your show in Portland sold out while I was at work. This video made me happy again. Thanks for sharing your amazingly awesome weirdness with all of us. I'll miss seeing you in Portland.
Hank...... This video was a lotta fun
Oh these are your butt cheeks\nYour gluteus what cheeks?\nGet some A+D ointment\nAnd make an appointment\nAnd end irritation\nAs you strut cheeks\n\nYour butt cheeks\nThese hands are your butt cheeks\nThe motion I'm makin'\nIs a simulation\nOf the action\nOf both of your butt cheeks\n\nThese are your butt cheeks\n\n\nYou're welcome, internet.
Hank, I missed your weird side. \nI work in a hospital where people get treated for butt problems, and I sometimes have butt problems. The toilet paper is HORRIBLE. Coincidence? Perhaps. OR guaranteeing more business.
That Rap... is going to be the next top single of 2017
(Aussie) Can't stand places skimping on their toilet paper.
I have no words...
I keep saying I should buy a bidet, but I never have... Spending a year in Iraq with cheap toilet paper wrecked my butt. It took years to recover. I'm not exaggerating.
This is a very Hank video and I love it.
I'm so happy to have seen this video
I have Crohn's. I feel your pain... literally.
Baby powder and body glide- my super hero weapons
Hank, I installed a cheap Astor bidet (it's on amazon) at my home. Huge life improvement. \nThe other thing you can try is (less pleasant, for sure) is the solution that muslims in  South African often do- a water bottle, some squeezing- okay it's not at all pleasant but it sure beats weak TP!
This was weird but really good.
That butt cheek rap... thank you for that.  This is your best video since Accio Deathly Hallows!
Hank, with all the love in my Hufflepuff heart, get. some. sleep.
Did anyone else notice his bedhead going on in this? The little flapping strands of hair on the back of his head. Ahhh, it's cute. :)\n\nP.S. Butts.
I RAISED MY HAND I HAVE PILONIDAL SINUS
You realise that the next time you come to Australia, everyone you see will have rolls of our softest bog roll/dunny paper/pottypaper, just for you.
I have three words for you, Hank... Flushable. Wet. Wipes. Not only cleans your butt much better, but is way more comfortable. I'm a complete convert.
This was an incredible viewing experience. 😂
Okay Hank, what drugs did you take? Can you take more because this was hilarious.
I'm sorry, was that the crow soundbite from The Simpsons?
This is a lot.  I am happy about this.
God that was excellent
I have a bidet on my toilet and will never go back to not having one. But, when traveling I always carry wipes.
What was that Hank???
Do a video about Brexit please...
this feels like old vlogbrothers I love it
Thank you for your honesty and candor about this subject. I have gastro issues and this is the truest thing ever.
Boudreaux's butt paste is my fav cream. It kind of smells like cookie dough, too (smell BEFORE application).
It's Charmin. And yes you should bring it with you everywhere apparently :P
This is why I use wet wipes. Wish they weren't terrible for the sewers though.
Yeah I know what you are talking about I live in Australia and the toilet paper in schools is so bad ,like the only place you can find good paper is if you buy it yourself.
Peri bottle. Or travel bidet. That's what you need, Hank.
And I JUST watched Vox's video about triplets in rap and then Hank drops that madness.

I wasn't emotionally prepared for this... Why did I wait until Monday morning...
I am Australian and generally assume that any public toilet including hotels will have single ply crepe paper for toilet paper. I lived in halls of residence and found it very handy to have your own decent toilet paper supply. It's just expected that public toilet paper is bad toilet paper. So yeah. This also applies to hotels. A nice hotel is not defined by its rooms or its price. It's defined by whether or not it will fork out for decent and also a DECENT AMOUNT of toilet paper. 2 rolls is not enough for a weeks accomodation I'm telling you!
1. 🙋🏼 Butt problems! \n2. I really want a full version of This is Your Butt Cheeks... Like, seriously. It's stuck in my head and I'm not even mad. \n3. This is probably my favorite vlogbrothers video in a long time.
Just realized that John has the same type of front teeth in the lower Jaw that I have xD
Hey Hank! In Britain supermarkets DO give you the per yard cost of toilet paper (actually, I think it's per sheet). It's written in little numbers under the price label. They do this for nearly everything, not just toilet paper: they tell you how much your raspberries cost per gram, and how much your orange juice costs per ml. It's great and so useful.
I know for a fact that you spent way too long on that rap. well done hank. well done
Are we going to have a 2017 nerdfighteria census? I don't want to come off like I'm pressuring you, Hank. I get that you're super busy. I've just been hoping for a while that you would release one because I like taking them. They're fun. Again, no pressure.
Think I know true cause of your problem...... Cheap food IN must eventually OUT.
Hank is a wonderful human being.
A couple of weeks of bad toilet paper once gave me months of pain and bleeding and PANTS AREA UNPLEASANTNESS. I feel so much less alone in the world now. #buttproblems
Can you john collaborate on a children's book?
Tired Hank is awesome
that was wild.
Not to sound like a hotel shill, but we want your stay to be comfortable and we love to go out of our way to do things that seem special, so next time you have terrible TP let the front desk staff know!\n\nThe TP in the room is truly terrible, really awful, I couldn't be more disappointed. I'm going out for the day and I would be really really impressed if I came home tonight to find super plush soft TP in my room.\n\nI know my hotel would send a porter up the street to buy some of the good stuff ASAP, and you can make a note asking for soft and sturdy stuff when you book your next hotel. ESPECIALLY if you're staying in a fancy hotel, we LOVE these kinds of requests. Trust me!
DUDE - have you seen my rant from Playlist DC?
I just watch Hank Green rap. About butts . . .
Been awhile since I laughed out loud at Vlogbrothers. Thanks, Hank!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhxmyzDbdWU
WTF did i just watch, lol
Goodness!
Erm ... are you OK, hank? ;-)
Use your hands Hank. 😂
But... But... I thought Quilton loves your bum...
i mean, the population of lgbtiq people in australia are going through a political situation that is incredibly dangerous to our mental and physical health - speaking, of course, about the nation-wide survey to determine whether we are seen as humans in the eyes of the greater population - but, sure, talk about toilet paper. Whatever.
Six and the City 👍
easy
5-0 4-0 6-0 ... RIP Palace next week
Aguero golden boot>>>>>
Crystal Palace next LOL!
im the best thanks for the upload, beany!
*Where's all the City haters saying Pep is a fraud now? That was an absolute slaughter & so was Liv'pool 5-0. As a Chelsea supporter I fear City this season.*
EPL welcome to total football, watch and enjoy, just starting #takenoprisoners
best manager in the world okay city come on pep come on city...
*_Great win for City_*
Pep bringing la liga scorelines to the epl
You city fans should appreciate every day this guy is your manager. Coming from a Bayern Munich fan. After he leaves you will miss this astonishing performances believe me. No matter who comes next
I'm a city fan but let's not get carried away. Let's not trash talk or be cocky yet. Injuries and complacency can happen at any time. Plus we got chelsea at the end of this month and still yet to play top 6 sides.\n\nI really hope we defend against the top sides and not commit the fullbacks too much forward against them.
aguero  fanstastic
C'MON CITY
Heavy breather
again not good enough #pepout #Cityincrisis
Take note all you bitch ass City haters, we're on a man hunt and hungrier than ever !!!
!´m so so happy!
The pep haters are low in numbers on the comment section. I wonder why!
Best bald manager in the world.😁😂😂
Why are people not commenting fraud
WHERE ARE ALL THE PEPS A FRAUD TROLL'S NOW. YOU ARE NOT, YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE JEALOUSY IS A SILENT M*THER F#CKER INNIT .GORD CTID. OOWHHH MAN CITY.....THE ONLY FOOTBALL TEAM TO COME FROM MANCHESTER®
Big sigh, wish he was at Arsenal!
Looking real good for Guardiola...Jesus has forced Aguero to step up his work rate and now Aguero has the ability to become golden boot
Are United still the favorites???!???!?? 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Top of the league from here on out
How awesome was that performance? That was total and complete football...\nIf only PEP wasn't a fraud? We'd be even better, if Pep was a decent manager.... But apparently he's a fraud according to some football geniuses.
IN PEP WE TRUST 100%
Wow! I hope he and his family  stay happy in Manchester he's a legend already..thanks pep...M.C.F.C
Pep haters not swarming the comments on every video I see lol if he wins the league with City so many ppl gonna cry
Your still not gonna win anything this year you glory hunting tossers.
If pep was argentinian, cant imagine what messi-aguero partnership will be like. Argentina would probably be 4 times WC champion by now
I think its between City and United who wins the pl title this season, I hope Kompany stays healthy for the rest of the season, because defensively city is still vulnerable, maybe Pep can bring a new CB in january.
Every PL fan: In the PL any club could win you'll never see a 6-0 score line in the PL .... where you guys at now? Hmm now that an English club finally has a talented club worthy to compete in Europe they're thrashing pub clubs like watford.
I guess 6-0 is what it takes to get Pep to smile
best manager in the world
City and Utd show-down this season
Meanwhile, Manure are celebrating being behind their city rivals PMSL
even we didn't play our best xl so don't take it easy united dogs
Man city means everything to me and the fans ...personaly I better miss a meal than missing a man city match.... Love you citizens'
no matter wat city do pipo will always talk shit so to all the city n gaurdiola haters go fuck yrselves or rather go masterbate
City city city all the way
I am so happy.. Happy new year
Pep gloats by bigging up his opposition to make him sound better
Pep is a fraud. Spent £1 billion and can't score 10 goals against Watford
we are nigas
Thank you CITY!
Man city vs Chelsea \n4-2\nMan City  vs CP \n10-0

Bald fraud
Money talks

Guardiola the team that played the last 20 minutes is  amazimg use them offten. And we fans Will watch beutifull football.
BEST FRAUD IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!
When Real and Barcelona win 6-0 English fans ARE TOLD BY THE ENGLISH MEDIA that the Primera is an easy league and the Premier League is the tough League where the big teams die to win!! when City win 5-0 against Liverpool and 6-0 against Watford what happens to the tough Premier League?!! WAKE UP ENGLISH FANS....ITS ALL PART OF MARKETING...
I'am Man.United fan but i admitted the football from City just amazing to watch.\nAttacking Football that he brings to City simply magnificent.\nAs a lover of attacking football i admire his philosophy.
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
Don't let this romp fool you ,Citeh will collapse either midseason or late season like they always do.
City were playing this style under mancini and pellegrini, nothings really different
My Top Four Prediction :\n1.Manchester City\n2.Manchester Utd\n3.Chelsea\n4.Liverpool/Tottenham \n\n\nOpinions?
GGMU GGMU 
Can not say he is the best till he bring city the champ of epl...

So,Now James has Collaborated With SMG4.Wheeuw
It's weird watching this as an Australian... *I DON'T SAY ANY OF THAT NOW ONE DOES THERE* Umm, any one else?
I just wanna say that the fact that the bread bag said white TOAST on it bothered me *so* much
Wow I never knew that James is a lefty

You should make a video with +brewstewfilms
What I learned from this video: there are a lot of Australian terms for delinquents.
GO SEE SNOOPY (I cried in that video when u left him😢)
We...totally have moccasins in America...? \nThe 'cloppy' shoes are clogs.
Wait...\nhold up\nI'm from the US, never been to Australia in my life, and I refer to it as the toilet and the restroom\nyay i'm special
3:20 If you’re american, Jazzas drawing is a redneck.
Look at jazz as muscles compared to James
It's called a coozie
thank you. you are the reason i make comics
I like Vegemite on toast or on biscuits like the ones u use for cheese and biscuits 😂
@Odd1 : you should make a video about your times in collage. Like your funny moments, random moments, and most weirdest moments. 👌✌️
my brother knows you and i want to meet you

Man.. I envy you. I love Tim-Tams... \n(edit): And yea, they actually do have them in America....sometimes. I always go to Target to stock up for Christmas.. Because they're good.
Why does it take long to make you an video?
Welcome to the outback. Their are tons of animals that could possibly kill you. Have fun!
Seriously, you live in America and you forgot what moccasins are?\n\nmeh whatever
Imagine a kangaroo playing a didgeridoo for an audience of wallibees, koalas and wombats at Uluru while throwing boomerangs and eating Tim tams.

Coming from a sailing community I can say firsthand that GROG IS DISGUSTING
I can't take James seriously with that shirt...
isn't that where Zoella and Miranda did a 5 second challenge?
Am I the only one who still has IT'S A BIG NUMBER as their text tone?
After this video James went around asking everyone where the dunny is.
James: Modern art is supposed to make you feel something. The only thing I felt was angry.\n\nyep. seems about right.
Did anyone else just click on this and not Pay attention to the Title 😀
I really love you're videos keep the good work up. My faviroute video is soubway part 3. Can you do a video about extroverts and introverts

Oh hi Black Widow! When did you get here?
OMG JENNIFER LAWRENCE IS THE BEST IN THIS MOVIE ANY MOVIE WITH HER IN IT IS GOOD AF
The Americans! Stop leading weltanschauungskrieg, the cold war ended in 1991 when the victory of the Chinese. In the third world war, you will be Germany, and we are allies with China. And no coercion to betrayal will not help to avoid the fate for you. Peace to you, future communist friends, and understanding for unfortunate consumer slaves. Proletarians of all countries, unite!
L'âme should have been called a teaser not trailer.
Jennifer Lawrence as an escort assassin? Count me in.
This is gonna flop just like Mother...Jennifer needs to take a break and choose her roles more wisely....overexposure can kill a career.
So... It's literally Black Widow? A Russian woman trained by a covert intelligence facility who gains an ally in an American spy who convinces her to leave Russia? Wow, Fox.
So is marvel suing? i mean, this is clearly a ripoff of black widow
So it's Black Widow's origin movie? Got it. \nUnoriginal Hollywood hackjob #31678.
Im thinking Black Widow and 50 Shades of Grey, anyone else?
The unofficial Black Widow movie lol i love it!
Black swan + John Wick = Red sparrow = Black widow
Wasn't there a 1980s movie like this with Linda Hamilton in the lead?
I think you mean Black widow
I feel like I've seen this movie at least 5 times before...even though I can't think of any of the titles it's gone by. (Not sure that's a great sign...)
BLACK WIDOW  : Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century Marvel .....ahhhhh I Mean FOX
I can't wait to miss this movie.
All women are like this!!!!! seduce u take your money and kill you
This is a Black Widow movie.
I liked it better when it was the Black Widow program.
I read this book the movie was based on....it was okay...it kind of went nowhere at the end of it... hopefully she brings something to the role..buuuut I'm not thinking so...
Someone had to make a Black Widow movie, so why not 20th century fox, starring Mystique.
The books are fantastic. They were written by a former CIA operative, I think. And they are a lot darker than any Black Widow movie would have been.
Came here excited to see Joel Edgerton, but left disappointed after seeing Jennifer Lawrence 😒
Jennifer Lawrence is a nigger
This is the black widow movie....its literally a colour and an animal and its the exact movie they were trying to make
So, basically Marvel didn't want to do a Black Widow origin story and Fox decided to make it instead.
I see no negative comments in the comments section, yet there are 1K dislikes... Why do people hate this trailer again? Is it a This movie is trying to portray all women as people who manipulate emotions because that isn't true (heh) or JLAW isn't suitable to play a sexy role (?)
How to manipullate men using their bodies.  You mean like EVERY single woman since the dawn of TIME, wow, we need a special program in Moscow for that one... TERRIBLE premise NOTx
That's CAPTAIN Red Sparrow
I just hope they don't make her have lesbian scenes just because she's strong and seduces her victims like in Atomic Blonde.
So many flavours and they go with Salty. Pun very much intended.
can someone tell me what matthias schoenaerts won in the academy? imdb isnt showing.
Someone please make a gif and crop it from starting at 1:01 please!
Guys this has nothing to do with super hero's or atomic blonde.\nThis is about the sparrow school which was a sub branch of the KGB that was disguised as a ballerina school which trained orphaned girls to became KGB spy & assassin's.
Solo film about the Black Widow in MCU we must will forget...
Lmfao! this is like the Black Widow movie we never got! even the origin looks like the same.
So they decided to make a Black Widow movie after all
Does anyone know the name of the song in the trailer? It's so good.
It's What If Mystique was Black Widow?!?
LOL it's basically a BLACK WIDOW MOVIE
This looks spectaclar. Jennifer Lawrence in that brunette fringe looks 5 years old
women trained for combat and using their sexuality as a weapon... kinda sounds like Naked Weapon (an asian film), anyone familiar with it???
Ppl r just hating on this movie because of the stigma that JLaw is overrated. In the end of the day, this is a book adaptation, and from what I can see, it looks well directed, conceptualized, and Jennifer carries the trailer. Stop hating on movies/actors just cos the general public just wants to hate on something.
Imagine if after all the carnage, the film cuts to black and right before the credits roll you hear her retarded laughter.
It's like a mix of Black Swan and Naked Weapon
I guess we finally have the Black Widow movie
So many receipts in the comments
the picture of she in a red room assult me however i find it a strong trailer adviced for pg18
The evil Russians and their Agents. Hollywood is so innovative....
Black Widow's Origin story
Could be the first movie I watch that stars Jennifer Lawrence.
MCU stans are so pressed over Red Sparrow. And I'm loving it ...they can keep their kiddy mcu version. Thank god Red Sparrow is gonna be hard R.
Хуйня опять
Ah, I just noticed it was moved from November to March. Why the date shift?
My dad once said - The russians are like a ugly moth - it will charade as a butterfly, but its soul is that of a ugly pest - destroying, feral, barbaric and pathetic little things
Black Widow meets Girl With the Dragon Tattoo meets Atomic Blonde!
Why so many dislikes ? i loved the  book and this looks great!
This looks so stunning! J-LAW is amazing!
Тратят кучу бабла на съемки, а у самих даже в трейлере ошибки.
Лоуренс ни разу ни похожа на русскую, и она слишком жирная для балерины. Ну и адовый набор клюквы, конечно
0:25  переснимете этот эпизод, не позорьтесь.  Не может такого быть, шалава за 2 бутылки водки, ахаха. Не такие есть, но они вокзальные шалавы, с опухшей мордой, не в гостинеце точно. Там должны быть доллары. Минимум 5 000 рублевые банкноты.
Atomic Blonde and Black Widow
that swimsuit though.
Щас каждый долбаеб заметит сторублевый пресс, и будет ржать, мол мало что ужас какой, а кто сказал , что там не пятитысячные внутри, обезьяний мозг берет свое
пацан попутал....дал сторублевками Дженифер Лоуренц....)RIP
just beat her
First a Mockingjay now a Sparrow :P

Boobs. Jennifer Lawrence Boobs.
Akinfenwa is really honest and very Nice guy
akinfenwa leaves the gym when the weights are tired
Akinfenwa should really be silver. He should probably be 66 or 67 rated tbh
I suspect EA do this on purpose to annoy him 😂
Give Akinfenwa a damm silver card already.
The one guy who actually does his stats right
Akinfenwa seems like a nice guy and honest, not like the other footballers that just give themselves more than what they deserve
Akinfenwa has the wide body kit attached
Akinfenwa should get invited to the true Geordie podcast!!!
18 goals common m8 he deserves his stats
True Geordie vs Akinfenwa
rio, you best centre back on history
He should really punch those people behind the ratings
Akinfenwa should actually get a +70 card rating just for bants😂
EA doesn't watch footie....It's a popularity competition
Where's Da Respect
Akinfenwas voice is way too squeaky for his size😂😂
Tbh he is right...
Why isnt he 67 rated he needs special cards every week
wowowowow, this is spence his job
Rio I am going to the Wembley cup and I really hope I meet you
Is Akinfenwa STILL a Bronze!? Are you serious EA!?!?
I would put 99 everything for myself
Looking at your predicted grades to your actual grades
arent u going to announce on ur channel that ur becoming a boxer
Awesome video. Criminal that he was downgraded I thought his own ratings were quite fair.
name of tune at star is sanpellegrino franki stew and harvey gun
The Fifa ratings are so stupid
Wayne Rooney just got banned for 2 years \nhttps://youtu.be/NQ3m5Ujm6Xc
He's my first signing on FIFA 18
just stole Spencer's video
I have 0 faith in EA ratings lmao it sometimes feels like they just have a hat with ratings and pick a random one for players. It's like they don't even watch football. And they need to stop sucking ronaldo's dick. How are you going to give messi 93 and ronaldo 94. They should both be 94
He is right he should be a little bit better he said it himself this was one of his best season and didn't upgrade him
THE TING GO SKRRRRRA\n KA KA KA KA \nSKIDI KI PA PA \nAND A DU DU DRRR\n 4:20
Akinfenwa: I came like a wrecking ball
He's actually right, deserves a boost to 65 overall maybe 66 with more finishing. Don't know what EA were thinking, did way better last season compared to the one before.
Subscribe to the true goerdie i will see ya later
i love these new fifa rating videos please keep them coming 😍
It's great to have him as a proper face in Fifa
Get the card signed Rio and give it away
Akinfenwa still plays football and still bangs in goals? That's crazy.
how is he a beast If he only has 80 physical ?
He's a national treasure
UNITED fans can you please check my VLOG on my channel and leave a like even if I didn’t do a good job 🙏🏽 #GGMU
he should play as a defender .
I'm 6 ft 3 weigh around 78-80kg and I think I've got a chance in man marking akinfemwa out of a full 90 min game cmon ADEBAYO take the challenge pal
When will EA make this man a silver
Imagine his 95 Pro player card
Everyone else is excited for gameplays and stuff when a new fifa comes out. I wait for the akinfenwa video
This is Spencer's job
I think they should give akinfenwa an 65 silver card, this man loves the game so much and really puts effort into his career, just upgrade this guy ea it is not gonna harm you in anyway, it wil be good for the community.
The man is a beast🔥
Akinfenwa is such a cool person
Rio ur an absolute legend for united
This is what spencer does
Who is this guy???
I love Rio but Spencer should have done this.
That 99 rating just for Eddie hall, you know if he randomly picked up football for 1 season.
Wtf wtf its not possible that he ia still 64 rated atleast give this man an 69 or 70 rated
Akinfenwa is the only player in fifa who's stats I wait the most
What's the intro music lads
His rating should be higher
Bayo I wonder myself how EA make these ratings, feels so sloppy and ridiculous at times
Adebao's on the road to Rio
BS
man Akinfenwa is annoying
Where is spencer???!!!
4:30 Rio gets all ghetto
Hahaha NOOOOO RESPECT! Real talk though they mocked him.
should be 72
18 league 2 goals ...
18 goals 😲
C
Do Bendtner
No RESPEK, no CHILL
Akin.. Oh god hes so fuckin funny
These became unfunny 3 years ago
Lllllll
Akinfenwa doesn't drop shoulders he drops players
cheers rio was fun bro
3:11 TRIGGERED
0:48 FIFA Seva'ee :D
Haha he's joke
stealing spenny's content
Where the respect??
Bring back spencer
5-0
That's EA
So modest
poora kinfenwa
Justice for Akinfenwa!
Why no spencer
Xhaka Laca Boom
Akinfenwa move to La Liga, Ligue 1 or Bundesliga and the EA will suddenly give him an 88 rating because they are anti-Premier League. We all know the FIFA rating is Bullshit. PSG and Bayern pay EA to give their players higher ratings. You saw in the Champions League Tottenham easily beat Dortmund yet in FIFA the Dortmund players have higher ratings. Thiago has a higher rating than Pogba when Pogba is a better player in real life. It is just Thiago plays against weak teams and players in the Bundesliga so looks more dominant. Fabregas is a better player than Thiago too.
Get Akinfenwa in the wembley cup
Oi Akinde is better than Akinfenwa
How is he 98 strength but 80 physical?
Everyone saying he seems nice and genuine in the comments, and I can honestly back that up. When he came to Grimsby with Wycombe, there was roughly 30 people waiting after the game for a photo and he didn't snub one person. Made sure everyone left with what they wanted and seemed genuinely happy to have a photo with fans! Really did differ to Edgar Davids who just ignored everyone who wanted a photo with him when he came with Barnet a few seasons ago.
Akinfengwa is just fat not ripped
Akinfenwa sounds about 12 years old, what a joker.
I love his voice, the Saints have won!
Oh wow, I'm here before the cracked rush?
I smiled as soon as Lydia came on screen. I'm glad she's feeling better
The new iPhone is $1500 in Australia

NHS hospitals are decent in fairness

Bullshit

Toms been on his knees to much. Little bitch.
you should set up a 'shit cam' live stream to catch the cat that is shitting on the sofa.
Bruh you need a beard transplant

hi James franco
Why don't you just put over some Blankets on the sofa when you go to bed or away :D
The pain could be a reactant to the medicine.
Where is syndicate wife
I went to see it and I was shitting myself 😂
#3 on trending xD
Lydia is back!!!!
Every Vlog from now on I am going to write this <3 Day 169!
Not really spoilers when the movie is a remake
Awesome vlog great to see Lydia is doing okay👍😎👌
i said ages ago when the knee pain started to occur that it was patella tendinitis, and i was correct 😂
Tom just get a blanket or something to cover the couch until the cats stop pooping
The return of Lydia
The Movie IT is just chapter 1
The film wasn't made to be scary as hell..it was made to tell the story of the losers club! Like in the bloody book. Getting right tired of people seeing this film because they thinks it's just another horror film. It's so much more than that
Tom just get a throw for the sofa's so it dont go on the sofa!
Tom get another box or 2 cats are very territorial
You are a really pretty girl Alice! Don't put your self down. Do I have to take you to Specksavers?
Love the old British Vloggers
Yooo it's trending
These comments are disgusting, Syndicate donates money to charity and helps people, then you guys be pricks. Btw 3 of the people so far are Jake paulers, cancer.
What is Alice's instagram?
Every month for 2 weeks they delayed it good England tom
4th on trending wow 👌
#4 trending gg tom
Lol @trending getting triggered, luv ya Tom
If you have a room that you're not using, you should put a load of cat stuff in it, and when yer out put them in that room and close the door😃
I don't know why I dislike toms cats so much but I do
Even though it squeaks, I want it plus the bed. If u 10 second skipped wrong there you'd be in for a wtf moment
happy that lydia looks healthier and better
to make your cats stop pooping on the sofa, get another cat litter box. Cats usually prefer their own litter box and if they are pooping on your sofa, they're letting you know.\n1
I like how Tom has a gymshark hoodie on but he never goes to the gym ;)
Who do the doodoo
So does syndicate not upload gaming videos anymore or is he just busy? Just curious if anyone knows
Ever had a needle in your eyeball? Not so painful as they sedate the skin, but I never forgot the grape being punctured. All for eye lasering...
The iPhone 7 plus 256 gb is $1000
To. Tom you need to try zizi's in the Trafford centre 👌👌👌👌👌👌
What movie did he watch?
i have tendonitis in my right knee it sucks btw
For real tho, maybe you should chill with the twitch sub shoutouts. I get that it's something nice you want to do for loyal twitch fans (and keep doing it if you do please) but as someone whose been watching since when LoT was Syndicate Central, it's kind of annoying and disrupts the vlogs...
Life of Tom do you live in Glasgow
I tore a ligament in my knee almost a year ago and it was meant to be healed months ago but I still have to get an MRI scan
Liderally
Why is everyone hating on Tom and the video because it's trending? It just means a lot of people are watching it that's it.
Ngl. Tameside Hospital staff are getting worse 😂 they're not even telling you they're gonna stab you now 😂
tom! if you put tin foil on the couch while you're not using it the cats will stay off of it saving your couch!!
Tom, I always love your VLOGS. Just classic and EPIC
New iPhone.....old Samsung technology

Why did you capitalise needles?
This vlog was uploaded on my 18th but was too drunk to watch it so i am watching it now.
The iPhone X shouldn't actually be £1000 apple just decided to charge that amount it should be about £750
When they say 1000 pound is heaps for the iphone, its 1800 here
You need to take some editing classes to make your vids more exciting to watch

All you run with excited is especially assemble in China lol
you look completely different to 10 years ago. Years not treating you well. Just kidding
I like that accent and her being so natural. Can I buy something? :) That accent brought me  20 years back to my college days in Louisiana. I like Apple in this regard. They market themselves as a big and sympathetic family and actually they are. (Im a galaxy note user) I cant say the Note 8 is a better phone than the I phone X ( it depends on what angle u look from) but it looks more technological and sexy to me. And of course its having the stylus. However this girl's being sooo natural is like nothing on earth, just fantastic.
the beatlesss
Waaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwww😍
Why u talk sweet. Ur gorgeous
I got dizzy watching this video
i Love You
You enjoyed yourself

Chill mate it's just an iPhone
how is that roof standing tho
She's found her passion. I respect that.
OMG that little boy just reminded me that my life is going nowhere slowly!
Really iSHEEP! Samsung Note 8 is a galaxy ahead of iPhone from wireless charging to stunning design and crystal clear beautiful screen, and iPhone price is almost the same as that of Note 8, so iSHEEP think iPhone is not overpriced, overhyped, and overrated!!! Don't be a follower, don't be one of sheeples. Be a leader, be a Samsung user. Baaaa... baaaing. LMAO. ROFL.
...who is this annoying broad? Quit yacking about your awesome day. Show me the phone!!
i phones are the most boring planest looking phones and they still look the same from 07
So... forgot about the 7s and 9?
I need your help people should I buy iphone 7  in matte black, red or rose gold (i'm not asking for likes I just can't decide) 💜
Cool i dream iphone x in my hand

iPhone X is cool! But I do not want to\nI want the camera to get better because I've taken a lot of videos
iJustine I want to meet you plz
I saw you with Alex on  the EllenShow and went straight to your channel right away lol
Apple is playing catch up,that iphone X with the chin,what a joke.A company with billions at their disposal and this is what they come up with. And here is the thing idiots will still buy them because they are sheep. And yes I could afford it if I wanted to.
You are so happy. Lol I’m excited for u lol
U PROMISED TO DO A FIT IF THE NEW IPHONES DIDNT HAVE A USB-C PORT
I love how excited you are about this event! I can tell that it is genuine and something you love! Great Vid :)
Here is my feedback for Apple on the iPhone X\n\nhttps://youtu.be/J2Retye43xk
I saw that kid on the Ellen show!
imagine doing what you love and meeting cool people and getting cool stuffs right when they come out what a life
You and iPhone are so unchanged. Lol\nKeep it up! I was excited about the iPhone X but iOS needs an overhaul, it looks dated.
Marques - did you get a piece of that sweet apple bro!?😜

3:44 look at the lady in the background haha
should i keep my organs or pre order iPhone X?
That kid is amazing..
Developers around the world should not accept the @Apple suggestion of embracing d notch, darkening the @iPhoneXNotch border. @NOTCHBLACKOUT
lol
Apple Geniuses put retards to shame
she is a beautiful nerd, i love it.
My day it home with my iPhone 7 Is probably the same as yours
After watching this video.. I fell in love with you... Not with Apple
iPhone 10 is a mess hardware wise and software. Apple is headed down the wrong path. Was a huge mistake firing Forstall!
Is switching to iPhone 8 plus from iPhone se worth it? Please help
I really like this thanks you show us too many things from different perspective go a head you are the best

I never had a iPhone period well I never had a phone since 2010 i do have a ipodtouch 5g but I decided for my very first phone in some time should be a iPhone 8
hes going on a excursion in german vehicle on tv.. its not 'real'
Glad you like it! I love the new iPhone too! I even rapped about it on my videos lol
I love how excited she is 😭
Justine your enthusiasm is absolutely contagious and hype and I love it! I'm so excited for you and for the new products of course ❤️ Love from an Apple Employee
you are very lucky person, you can buy what you want, but me, i cant.
whats the song at the end of the video
I wish that iJustine lives up her legacy and Apple DNA, never to speak Samsung phone ever again. iPhone X, Justine? I basically unsubscribe any channel talking bad about the X.
The level of ridiculousness of the whole concept of worshipping a phone is scary at the moment and is going to be very hard to explain to future generations in say 30 years.  They are going to be shocked how stupid we were :)
Are you getting the iPhone X? Or 8 or 8plus?
What’s the song
I can see how a smartphone is useful in daily situations - I myself have an iPhone 7 - but wearables aren't something I can see myself using.\nI just watched a video today about 'How far we've fallen,' when it comes to modern living versus 10-20 years in the past.\nIn this case, one of those things is that runners ran just because - not because a watch tracked this or that.\n$300+ in their pocket, and no phones, watches, or wires to deal with.
Well im sorry to say this but nade chose the wrong sister
If you want the best and greatest phone is the Samsung 8
imagine going in this event with everything on you as android devices! security will be like get the F**K out of here! lol
I Buyyed It!!! AND ITS SO COOL!!! THE CAMERA IS SO GOOD
Hello Justine! Wish you the best luck forward !!
are you going to be lining up for the iphone 8
Apple is excellent in reliability but BEWARE:  IPhone X uses infrared *LED Lasers* to Scan your face. This laser scan is Unhealthy and leads to *Skin Diseases* (which most already know, starts with a *C* )
What happened to the iPhone 9??
What’s the song name in min 6:31..?
I mean it looks clean and smooth and nice but.... the camera.. come on like it looks weird... and NO BUTTON!!! I mean WHEN I SEE A ROUND BUTTON I THINK OF APPLE! Apple is known for having that button..

Lol! One of the fans tried to push me off the train and he didn't even move me 😂😂
I agree we didn't have a game plan which is often the problem with Bilic. only reason we kept the ball a lot is because they allowed us to. Says a lot when our best effort was Obiangs long ranger and stop play our best goalscorer in years on the wing FFS

HELLO FRIENDS!! i dove back into the sea of ~wish~ once more to see what all this free stuff was about... are there any other strange websites you would like me to try?
You should do a Wish video where you order the first free thing you see under tops, bottoms, accessories, shoes, etc and make a full outfit! That could be fun. (I already wrote this as a reply on my old comment, but wasn't certain if you check replies. 😅 Love you, Saf!)
If you. Buy shoes, bags , and anything beside clothes it works
I'm so glad I found you through Shane!
There was a wish ad before this video...
next time do I bought 5 *verified* items from Wish
I don't know why but I want a video with saf trying out depop
You are so funny lol 😂
I had that watch in gold its cute
oh but it's free.99 best line ever
I honestly feel like this isn't really that fair because some weren't even free...
She should go to a haunted house
The shorts you have I also have but it's in the colour wine red and yea it wasn't free
With the free items, they just add the price to the shipping cost.
I tried to order from this site and it didn't go through so I tried again and asked for like a photo of my credit card or checking account it was weird. I'm not sure if it's cause I used PayPal I always when shopping on line never had an issue
I just gotta say that I love all your videos. I feel like your content is super original and it's a breath of fresh air.
So, i found out my mom spent like $300 on wish. \nI am stressed.
The items were free, but the shipping was not! 😂
Please do like a furniture version of this like buy chairs or littlw tables or something!
who's buying a medium orange i caaaant 😂😭
Could you do a Dresslily Vintage style dress review?
I agree. I too felt unsettled by the white LOVE shirt
I LOVE WHEN SHE READS THE ENTIRE LONG TITLE HAHAHAHAHAHA
Those black shorts are exactly what my 13 yr old wears for gym so going to look for them 🙄
friend: so what are you doing this weekend?\nme: oh just ordering some  extra large blacks\nLMAO
Isn't it illegal for wish to list that something is free and then change the price in your cart?
Its Free 99😂 get it. Like 3 ninety nine. Il go home
I seriously got a wish ad before this XDDD I AM DYING
Idk why but she looks like the Gabbie Show....it's just the face don't judge me 😂
do the clothes run smaller then they say, I want to buy some but I don't want to waste money on stuff I won't be able to wear
Anyone see the review that said my son looks good in them
It's never free because the shipping just goes up
OML I JUST GOT A WISH APP LOL
Buy the top 5 verified items on wish that you see for a video
exactly, for free or for the cost of shipping, so you paid for the shipping
can you review Romwe I see it everywhere
I just got a Wish advert
went from 875k to 3mill in just a lil while im impressed
when you were dancing at 11:30, admit it, you were imitating the Peanuts xmas dancing guy, the one that doesn't move except left and right. Well anyway. thanks for the laugh Safya, i needed that. Better Luck next haul.
Everything i've bought on wish i love
was that a pun or my ears but i swear she said...\n'hololujah' instead of hallelujah
U have to pay for shipping i think that's why
11:15 CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE SAF GOT THIS SHIRT IT'S BEAUTIFUL
A Wish ad played before this LOL
I GOT THAT HOLO CASE FROM MY MALL WUTTTT
Bralettes are nice if you're bra size is Like B cup and under. I can't even find my bra size at the store so I definetly definitely can't even use a bralette.
the thing is none of there things are free😂they just add the actual price to the shipping😂😂
It’s so affordable!
Just don't get finessed there
This is Sophia's new intro sooOOooOONnnNnnnggGGGgGGgg!!!!!!! 👌👏👏
I've been getting merch from Wish and I love it so far, I've gotten 10 things I believe
okay not being creepy here at all, but...\n\nnice butt.
I'd love to see you order a few wedding dresses!  😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤ love your channel!
My mom got a case from that company and I thought it came will all of those items but they were just listing accessories that you can buy.
I got a wish ad before this
Hi saf! Looks like the free stuff have a timer. You have to check your items out before the timer runs out.
You should do a yesstyle haul 👀
i bought that cat shirt on wish! lol
do a haul from like shein!!!
Wish makes the money with the shipping. When u buy something for free and have still 1$ shipping this dollar pays both - item AND shipping - also the amount of shipping added to stuff on wish makes it extremly pricy if u search further for the same items..
Actually theyre not really free - things that used to cost 1$ had 1$ shipping and they turned them free but with 2$ shipping so you still pay the same lmao its just to persuade customers
I honestly got a lot of free stuff and even bought a lot of shoes and clothes from Wish and I never got a single problem with it, except the everlasting shipping of course

It's not an armpit boob... It's a pit tit!
Shopping for bra \nReview : my child *loves* it 😂😂
I noticed with wish that the non clothing options normally stay free and clothes change depending on size even when it's not free
It's a good marketing technique ... free plus ship is extremely common in business. The product will cost $2 to make, therefore you can deem it as free & charge $4 in shipping .
When you add the items to the cart it adds the price with the  shipping cost
I wish I could get free stuff all the time
Just got a wish commercial. ._.
Because the over charged for shipping!
I'm sat here at 4:23am laughing at safiya saying who is buying medium orange 5:01 🍊
Lol my cousin just bought a shirt like that but it's red and open and pull done pocket it has a little middle finger lol
the free stuff is not free for real the price is in the shipping the shipping is duble than normal price
I bought the first 5 things pinterest suggested for me
I got a wish add right before this! lol

I would say getting a flexible bar for your piercing. It'll keep the piercing open without being an uncomfortable rigid bar :)
Ekkk nature baby is wonderful ! Also have a look at Haaka it's a New Zealand company their Breast pump is meant to be amazing !
My mum made the mistake of keeping her belly piercing in when she was pregnant and now it's like hanging on to a small bit of skin. With my sister she took it out at about 28/30 weeks and she didn't have any problems x
You look beautiful and so happy!!! 🍼💕
Aww the nursery looks great. As do you.  Can't wait to meet the little one.  I also love how honest you are. Xx
Cute baby bump can't wait to see her ..
You're absolutely glowing!
You look absolutely gorgeous 😘
Fleur you are glowing ✨
¸You look absolutely beautiful!
you are glowing <3
I heard cot bumpers are dangerous?
Haha awww loved this!!!❤️🙏🏼
🎀 future best dressed baby girl 🎀
Bonds are amazing. Love them, they are addicting though lol the patterns are so nice
I know I'm going to sound like one of those knobs. But please do some research on cot bumpers before deciding to use them. They aren't recommended anymore as they can increase the risk of cot death. Obviously I wouldn't dream of telling you how to raise your baby, knacks me right off when people do it to me. But pretty please just do a little research and make an informed decision.
Hi Fleur you can get special maternity belly bars, they are soft & pliable I can really recommend them... I went through 2 pregnancies with it in no problem at all! Hope that helps x
Watch the clicky hip when shes born my niece has it shes 4months xx  its common in girls an esp u having it 2 💕👶🏻
Hi \nUr so cute and girl I have u covered for ur belly button .\nWhat u need to do is put a thick strand of sewing thread and move them around every few days :) I hop u will read this and find it helpful lol I know sounds weird but it work I promis :)
Congratulations! If your back and pelvis keeps hurting you could try seeing an Osteopath who specialise in pregnancy. They can help with the discomfort you're experiencing as well as help prepare your body for labour. I know of a few in London if you need any recommendations
So glad you are well. Are you doing kegal exercise? It really helped me have an easy labor. It strengthens your inner muscles
I hand-knit baby cardigans, I wish I could send you one! \nThis is my shop if by any chance you see this comment :) \nhttps://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Lelws
You look amazing im so happy for you and mike i have a 2 yr old son and my only advice for you is to take advantage of every moment you can spend with your new bundle of joy. Have an amazing time with eachother now and oh i forgot sleep as much as possible
Charming and heartwarming Fleur. Always enjoy your vids and these are no exception. What a joy to experience bits of other people's world. Blessings to you, Mike and baby! ~ Melody
Ok I'm 21 and nowhere near ready to have a baby but I absolutely love these videos 😍 yourself and Mike will make the most adorable parents ❤️
You have wonderful taste for baby clothes and in general...useful video, thank you and good luck. You'll be a good mother and also your husband seems ready for this new adventure.
they make flexible bars for belly button piercings during pregnancy! they are a clear plastic bar that bends with your stomach and belly button xx
Bonds are amazing Fleur 💗💗💗. I spend so much money at Bonds here in Australia x
My belly button piercing was ok until about 27 weeks. I should have taken it out then but i waite until 29 weeks. The skin stretched too much and started to split upwards as well. Now I have two little stretch lines above my belly button , almost like a peace sign. It scarred terribly and i wish i'd taken it out sooner ! i would recommend taking it out eearly to prevent scar tissue - it'll be much easier in the long run if you want it re-pierced ! xxx
Yes you should take the ring out,your stretch marks will be pretty bad if you don't (i know stretch marks are normal of course but the ring will make it worse) :)
Really enjoyed this video and how happy and comfortable you seem being pregnant :) I'm not pregnant and don't have any kids but I still love watching these videos - the bit at the end where you were talking about finding like minded people is exactly why I like watching you! We're a similar age and at similar stages and I just find you so easy to watch :)
You look fantastic! Loving the belly updates, it's so much fun to watch baby grow.
Oh my god you look so so amazing and your bump is adorable! Made me a bit emotional 😍😍
With the belly piercing my cousin was pretty huge by the end of her pregnancy. She switched at about 5/6 months from a normal piercing into a rubbery almost feeling clear belly bar. They’re quite long and flexible. That worked perfectly for her and after birth she just put her normal one back in
I had mine pierced and it was very uncomfortable after about 6 month or so ,I decided to keep it on as much as I could but it left a scar ,good luck any way hopefully yours doesn't 💕
This is so exciting! Best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy, Fleur!
OMG the baby carrier is £250.00! I thought i might get one but slightly out of budget :-(
If you are having a baby shower add sleep saks to your registry or purchase it yourself . Some babies hate being swaddled . My son loved being swaddled in the hospital but once we got home he refused it .
You can buy bendy belly button bars to wear while you're pregnant x
Replace your existing belly button jewellery with a clear retainer belly pregnancy piercing bar. It's longer and very comfortable to wear. Very affordable to wear too.
Yay bonds are the best. We love them in Australia 💗
Look into a pregnancy belly ring. They exist. I bought a few for a friend when she was pregnant. They are life savors. Plus it will allow you to keep your home.
My Mum had her belly button pierced when she had my brother. She had looked into plastic/rubber bars that stretch with your bump and if you can get one then definitely get one, but in the end my Mum couldn't find one in time and her piercing was absolutely fine with it left in.
Firstly, you look fantastic! Secondly, I took my navel piercing out bc I was nervous that my baby would be super wiggly and rip it out.
I love that pretty pink jumper on you, the colour suits you. Your glowing by the way!! Love watching your pregnancy videos, it takes me back to when I was pregnant. It's the best feeling in the world when you see them for tbe first time on the ultrasound 💗
I had the same thing. You should go to the chiropractor. It did wonders for me!❤️
You are always beautiful but you look seriously radiant in this video!  I love the bump!  And I'm loving all of these videos.  Personally my husband and I have been talking about trying.  But I think a lot of us watch just because we are invested in your lives!  It is exciting to see you guys go from that first video with Mike to getting married and now becoming parents!  Thank you for sharing!  \n\nI giggled when you said 'I don't think I'll be showing my naked bump... 10 minutes later... here's my naked bump!!  \n\nOn a side note... I would love to have a way to send you something!  Or do a swap if you were interested... I am just a fat girl that really wants a crunchie bar!  :)  xo
Nursery is beautiful. They make special belly bars if you don't want to remove your piercing. They have loads on amazon normally called something like Flexible Pregnancy or Maternity Belly Bar.
I got my belly button pierced when I was 16. I took it out when I was about 23. I'm 33 now and it's still open. I've never been pregnant..
Hi Fleur I had my belly button pierced and had to take it out because your skin on your belly gets really tight. My piercing hole had heeled and closed through that time and I now have a little scar. Its all worth it in the end I got 2 beautiful little boys☺️
You are absolutely glowing! And the bump is beautiful! Make as much baby related content as you want, we are eating it up 😄 Enjoy this time of your life beautiful lady!
You can buy pregnancy belly button jewelry that's what I would do
Every bump is different with my first I had a flexi bar with my second too painful too big so had to take it out and healed you look beautiful and glowing xxx
I love ure videos fleur and your baby bump looks fab! X
Love your fingernails color. What is brand/color is it?
As a mother of 3 fully grown and healthy children/now adults, I can tell you try not to be shy about your bump.  You are simple put...divine!  Enjoy this time.  I read a quote once:  Mother is the name of God in the hearts of children.  Let it carry you through.  Blessed Be!
Bioflex belly bars. They're really flexible and plastic so you won't react badly and they're also in loads of different sizes in case the hole stretches and you need to gauge up or you need a longer one etc. You can get cute designs and stuff but if you just need a retainer they do clear plastic retainers as well! Good luck with your baby! Xx
My recommendation is that you purchase a pregnancy belly button bar. I took mine out while pregnant, and it grew up, and the holes stretched out terribly.
As the Mom of a 2 month old and a 2 year old do whatever you feel is right for your baby. My sons both had full wardrobes of newborn size including shoes and I've used them! I used a crib bumper *gasp* :) and my first son wasn't 100% breastfed, I did formula as well bc that's what worked for him... I could go on and on. Just do what works for your family and don't worry about what others think. Good luck 😊
I've really enjoyed watching your videos generally over the years and especially your pregnancy videos. Don't worry about your channel content changing as you go through your pregnancy ... its obvious and frankly fun as a Mom of three myself to watch your excitement. Love the colour of your sweater on you.
Hi Fleur, I had my belly button pierced and had the same questions when I got pregnant. I actually didn't have a forum like this to ask peoples advice so I just took mine out later in pregnancy so people couldn't see the ring under my clothes. I chose not to put the ring back in after my daughter was born but have to warn you that 11 years later I still have a scar which looks like a hole. Not that I mind, but just in case you are worried about that.
How sweet everything is !! You are glowing Fleur :)
@fleurdeforce Looking radiant Fleur! Belly button piercing while pregnant can be tricky, I would highly recommend removing it earlier rather than later the skin around it will stretch as is expands. You should be able to put it back after the pregnancy with no problem. Gros bisous
Wow, looking fabulous, I think pregnancy suits you and thank you for sharing your bare belly!! Great vid :) boy the dogs are going to have a rude awakening....
You look lovely!Such a cute nursery and you look stunning!I am 28 weeks currently and we are expecting a baby boy.I am so excited for you and Mike and really enjoy all this pregnancy vlogs!
I had my belly bar out for over 3 years and couldn't even see where it had been pierced when I got pregnant.  Now I have a huge brown scar where my belly stretched it, and it never disappeared again. 😔
Fleur - you are positively glowing. You're so so pretty and you suit pregnancy so much. Again, like other people have commented, I have no interest in being a mom but I am living for your baby vlogs and updates. Take care of yourself lovely x
You look amazing Fleur and the nursery looks lovely, you have a very lucky baby! I love watching these vlogs, I have two girls now 8 and 11 but still love watching these and remembering the excitement of having a baby! Xxx
Hi Fleur, loving the baby bump, you look lovely. My belly button is pierced and I used one of those little twist type bars (spiral) and it didn't pull at all until right to the end. I took it out about a month before and then just pushed a bar through each day and took it right out. After the baby was born I put my belly bar back in as normal. Would totally recommend the spiral bars for comfort (although not the most pretty). Xx
You're so beautiful!! Thank you for sharing!!
what lipstick you use in this vedio？
omg, the jumper, the lip, i was literally shocked when i clicked the video open!!! you are so pretty !!!!!
The piercing... My friend took her piecing out and put a length of fishing line in and tied beads on both ends. Totally flexible and bump grows around it
Belly button ring...Yes it marks!! And it grows back so fast. You will have to get it re-pierced!! Ugh, I hate getting my belly button pierced-again }: lol... advice from a mom of three- time goes by so fast, so fast- enjoy EVERY SINGLE SECOND, even the hard stuff. x
I have successfully kept 2 kids alive ;)  The biggest recommendation I give every new mom (or the gift if you're my friend) is a book by Gary Ezzo - On Becoming Babywise: Giving Your Infant the Gift of Nighttime Sleep - It helped us all sleep through the night and have proper food intake.  IT WORKS - the advise in this book is the best! It's still available on Amazon.   Congrats
That's what I've used http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Flexible-Pregnancy-Maternity-Belly-Bars-Clear-Ends-/171798408693?epid=1131803126&hash=item27fffbadf5:g:iFAAAOxybetR9U0I
Hi Fleur! I am also 23 weeks! I wonder if we have the same due date! I am due on January 13th... when are you due?
Hi fleur, just wanted to comment, be cause you look amazing, so please don't feel self conscious. I Have had two babies and have my belly pierced. I got one of those plastic belly ring and started wearing it from about 20 weeks. My piercing hasn't stretched also it didn't chafe or get irritated at all. It was quite comfy really. Also just wanted to say that not everyone gets that line of hair on their bump. I didn't anyway. So glad you are enjoying your pregnancy now. You are positively glowing!!! Xxxx
I just thought, you can buy pregnancy belly button rings so that might be something worth looking into :)
I had a belly button piercing for my 1st pregnancy.  I kept the ring in, until it started to annoy me and irritate my skin and then I took it out.  I put it back in a little bit after the baby was born and didn't have any issues with it closing up, scarring or causing any extra stretching.  I think it all depends on your skin, so if it looks like it's causing an issue, maybe take it out sooner than later.  Good luck!!
Fleur, Have you ever heard of KT tape? I have a bad back and my baby was sitting really low in my pelvis as it was was aching really badly during the final trimester. I put KT tape on and the discomfort was hardly noticeable. When I took it off I could feel it again! You can put the tape on your belly to lift the weight off your pelvis and or your back. \n\nI also had my belly button pierced. I took it out when it started to catch on my clothes. I would put it back in occasionally to make sure it didn't close. After I had my son I put it back in.  But i noticed when I was breastfeeding my son would lean against me it would make indentations on his body from where he was resting. The skin definitely stretched so I took it out and am waiting for my belly skin to return to normal and to lose some weight before I put it back in again.
So excited for you Fleur! You are glowing. Your bump looks so cute. When I was pregnant only used coconut oil on my bump and drank lots of water and ate healthy and I have no stretch marks at all. I was massive ( gained about 30kg haha ) so my advice is keep well hydrated and healthy from the inside and moisturise from the outside. ( I haven't got piercing tho)  \nSending lots of love xx
I loved the video althoug I am just eighteen years old and not ready to have kids for a very long time...by the way: you looked gorgeous in the video!
I took mine out and left it out....  I was scared it would tear my skin.
Fleur, I for some reason have no maternal instinct whatsoever, I think mine has been directed into loving dogs more than babies.....I know, I can't help it!!  HOWEVER.....you are the first and only YouTuber that I am genuinely happy to watch throughout your pregnancy and so very pleased for you!!!!   xxx
I'm honestly super duper excited about #babyDeForce and thank you for letting us be a part of this!! These videos are so much fun to watch (don't get me wrong, I do also love your other videos) and I can't wait for more happy videos! I wish you guys all the best from Belgium :)
I've had 2 babies, had my belly pierced when I was 16. When I had my 1st pregnancy I intended to keep my piercing in for as long as possible but I quickly becomes really uncomfortable. I took mine out, and now have a big v shaped stretch mark coming out of it. I intended to put it back in / get it re pierced but to be honest I don't ever get my tummy out any more, so don't really feel the need to have it done again! Someone I know tried a maternity bar but found it just as uncomfortable as having their normal one in when they got much bigger, so took it out
This video was totally adorable! The nursery looks so great so far!
You can get special bars for during pregnancy, they r really long fleur. I work in shop that used to sell them x
You're super beautiful Fleur! Enjoy your pregnancy! I loved every minute and now my bubba is 2! X
You are so beautiful! I have never seen an expectant mom glow as much as you. Thanks for sharing this joy filled journey with us. It has been 17 years since my last baby, 22 since my first (!) was born and all the memories come rushing back to me as I'm watching you. I also adore your non-traditional choice for clothing and nursery colors. So stunning.
For the belly button piercing you can get a flexible rod, and after your belly has gone back to normal u can wear fun piercings again. Good luck :)
You seem SO happy it's lovely to watch! ❤️ Love the colour scheme you've picked for your nursery. I took out my belly button piercing before my bump got very big and it has left a scar now, but I'm sure that would have happened anyway! I'm contemplating whether to get it pierced again to try and cover up the damage 😂
I had my little prince 5 weeks ago and since the first day Ewan the Dreamsheep has been an absolute favorite! I would highly recomend getting something that makes these whitenoise/womb sounds. And don't only prepare for the birth but for the time afterwards(breastfeeding, baby care etc) 😊
Hey Fleur! I have my belly button pierced and had a baby 2 years ago, and managed to save it without getting any stretch marks by using a long flexible bar until the very last weeks, when my belly button popped out (I went on a week past due date...). As soon as it felt uncomfortable I took the bar out, and spent the last 3 weeks without anything, then put the flexible bar back after I went back from the hospital, then a regular piercing banana when my tummy looked okay for it (and damn it felt good !!!) I hope it helps, and I wish you a wonderful end of pregnancy, smooth birth, and a great mom life. Love !!!
The chair you were sitting in cost £1055.  :0 I want thwe chair but I can't afford that ;(
Not sure if someone has already commented this... But you can buy maternity belly bars. They are basically much longer and often plastic so they are much softer. My step mom wore one in both her pregnancies and it worked great for her. I think they're pretty cheap online x
I left mine in  a bit too long. I DIdn't take it out when i really began to show around 7 months. I got a bit of a stretch mark ... thankfully it went away after my son was born. I left it out till he was almost 1 and it went back in just fine! Obviously you don't have to wait that long i just forgot about it till then.
When my mum was pregnant with my 2 siblings, she just took her piercing out when it got really tight and the skin started to stretch.. and afterwards she was able to just put it normally back in, so I wouldn't really worry about it if I were you :)
Dawww ❤️🖤❤️ the snakes puppy mouth is adorable
No wonder ice bear from we bare bears is so calm
Link talking in third person sounds like elmo
s e r p e n t \nk i n g
You were missing a variable, talking in first person, that is crucial for an experiment
How'd you guys get Jake Paul and Erika in that tank with link?
What happened to this show?
Link doesn't feel like a word anymore
I loved the new intro
Link think about his dog Jay.\nThat thing would eat Jay so fast :))))))
I just love snakes, I think she is so adorable. Especially when her handler was first putting her in the aquarium, she went back up like Nuuuu dun put me in here!
Nothing from Stevie would scare me :)
I have anxiety and I always talk to myself during a panic attack, always have. I talk to myself generally aswell to try and remain calm. It works mostly but it has its disadvantages aswell.
I actually own a six foot columbian red tailed boa names Cassiopeia she's my baby <3
I'm sitting here crying and laughing XD poor Link, this poor poor freaking man. Link IS poor.
I thought the snake was cute personally
why is no one talking about the game title????!!! THEY ARE ALWAYS SO CREATIVE ON THESE TITLES !!!
Check out the new challenge on our channel!
Did anyone else think link sounded just like Dobby
Link doesn't seem like a word anymore
at 11:04 the test constant was altered when he criss crossed his legs
I talk to myself and bite my nails
Oh god I can feel Link's anxiety
Link, those had better be Red Wing boots.
Is it safe to have a reptile touch your face area like that?\nI like reptiles, but I was always told that they're the most disease ridden of all animals. I'm not sure how true that is though.
I love the way they do the titles they are so clever
ALL HAIL TO THE SERPENT KING!
Rhett I have the same shirt
oh my gosh.  poor link.  i love that guy and he's always getting picked on.
link was doing it wrong
shameful, literally just talking about science and you still are wrong about something simple. if the world somehow lost gravity you would not just float away, if you jump then yes you would, but if you leap forward then you would keep going forward forever and go through the atmosphere, maybe even into the sun!
Oh my crap should be the next shirt.
#qtmba i would grab to something bolted to the floor stay there until gravity is back and well talk to my self.
Today we're gonna stress you out\nPut your head inside a tank\nAnd fill it with stressful stuff\nThat upsets you 😂😂😂\nAmazing
Why can't they keep the heart rate up on the screen !!!!
I love you god  I watch good mythology morning when I Sade I. Watch it .
QTMBE: Do the biggest slut drop ever seen by a human eyeball
Rhett, you shouldn't put q-tips in your ear, you can get really bad ear infections.
Very cool experiment.  Link you ROCK dude!!!!
Actors being paid to act.
When Rhett said I am the captain now 1:39 I immediately thought about studio c
Link reminds me of paul rudd so much anyone else?
#QTMBA I'd start flapping my arms to fly.
After seeing this i tried talking to myself in third person during a panic/anxiety attack and it really helped so thanks guys for showing us this
Poor Link looks like he's about to cry with the snake.
Wait did I just get Rhett-rolled? \n\n\n\n\n\nBut seriously tho these questions have to be answered before I die
When Link started talking in third person with the snake I started laughing so hard but I also felt bad 😂😂
I'm surprised how you guys are not dead yet
That handler made me appreciate snakes more.... maybe they're not just heartless creatures after all.  Maybe i wanna hug a snake......mmmm maybe not
#QTMBA i would not have a plan i would be dead
the snake was a cutie cx
I can't believe Rhett made that joke at the beginning 😂
Bring Christina back on the show with more animals sometime! She was so cool!!
The red tailed boas are among one of the nicest breeds
Return of the Serpent King
When u talk 3rd person it distracts u but stress does come back but if u continue to talk it will drop

Hey Lovely people, I'm loving reviewing these sites and experience and sharing the good, the bad and the ugly with you all! I've linked most of the items in the description box for those asking, however they often sell out or are removed on ebay! Hope you enjoy and see you on Sunday for my next video xx
I have the first pair of shoes in Black but I bought them over wish :D They are nice, but they smelled a bit the first days!
They look like clown shoes, they're too small, the bow is lopsided, and I'm offended so.. \n\nI AM IN TEARS
I liked All of the shoes that u tried on...EXCEPT the Balcengica Road Runners  😝.
details on the short bob please!!!!!! Sooo cute!!
A lot of people have straight up copied your format with these videos and that's to be expected; it's YouTube after all but I love how of all the videos I've seen, only ONE person gave you a shout out for the inspo (Tierra Monet) 😂😩 stingy asses
first thank you for spending your money to deliver us the truth....   But girl is that your hair?  It is thick and beautiful love the cut on you ....  looks really good.
The barney stinson meme is my life
Your closet must be packed with amazing goodies!! ✨✨
Anyone needing English-to-Dutch translation of their website, app, various articles, message me. Depending on size, translation is free! \n\nI am a university student in International Communications from Belgium.
Love your videos, I’ve been watching you for years. Would be great to see one of these for Lasula Boutique 😊 x
How do all the shoes look good on you man... every time I put something on I feel like all you can see of me is feet. Like im a foot, not a person lmao
you're so pretty !!!!
Me: straight face liking video \nHer: hopefully some real yeezez(spent wrong)\nMe:😂😂😂😂😂😂
It start at 2 47 your welcome
Are the yeezys real ? If so, the price is reasonable
you are sending me Martha Jones from Doctor who vibes
 I'm offended. These are a no, these are actually a no. Stealing this quote for life purposes.
Can you link the Yezzys
I love the commentary
please Patricia.  Stop playing with my heart and tell me how to get hair like this!
What's the hype of Yezzys?
Patricia could be a stripper in those over the knee boots 😂\n\nLove you Patricia 💖
dhgate is the best site for yeezys
Wait so why did I get a Spanish Colgate ad ?
What is the link for the white yeezy boosts?
Where did she get the shirt from?
The yeezys are real
The yeezys look legit
They look like clown shoes Lol
whats on your lips?
What does kosher mean
I was surprised by the over the knee boots. I can't wear heels because I have broken my foot one too many times and currently have 2 anchors, a plate and 5 screws in my foot and ankle, but I am going to go on ebay and see if I can find some over the knee flat boots. The ones you got were surprisingly nice looking for the price and I would bet they have some flats on the site as well. I have been looking for some flat boots for a long time but they are so ridiculously priced in shoe stores and I am not willing to pay upwards of $100 or more, most of the time, for some faux suede boots that I will probably only end up wearing once or twice. I really only want them to wear with a certain pair of skinny jeans and a specifc top and one mini dress that I only wear once a year if I go out to a club or a bar for a friends birthday or something. So if I can get them for under $25, that would be the most ideal situation. The only shoes I will spend more than $30 on are my trainers or my reef sandals because I get a ton of use out of them and I want them to be supportive and comfortable.
Love your videos just started watching recently x
When she started comparing the Fenty's I fell off the damn couch laughing so hard 😂😂😂 You Slay my life omg!!!
You sound like Mel B. So cute
You should try TigerMist! It's an Australian store but I've always had great experiences with them!
Pricing is so random because of currency exchange
I like your video.Please you can try somthing from  -  ioffer -
Fast, cheap fashion usually comes at a price. That is, underpaid, overworked women and children in sweatshops.
Thanks Patricia for this video. Some people just think ebay is bad by it really isn't.
Could you please add the yeezy link?
Your hair looks so good!! Omg😍😍
I don't trust ebay
I've watched multiple haul type videos of ebay and such and she is definitely my fav. You're entertaining and authentic it's nice :) your waaooows are so aww hahaha girl I like you
And I'm offended 😭😭 love her
Can you please put the name of the seller of the yeezy boost ?
I love the short hair on you! ❤️❤️❤️
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER CLIP YASSSSSSSSSSSS I SUBSCRIBED IMMEDIATELY
I cried when she pulled out the Fenty sneaker alternative lmao
I dunno what you did, but you are looking fleeky in this video!
Posted this video on my birthday.😘❤\nLove you Patricia!!!!!!
where'd she get the yeezys
Lmfaoooo she's just so sweet
Where is your necklace from\nI loveeee it ❤️
'And I'm offended'😂😂😂😂
Sis, you are hilarious!! I was screaming at the pink shoe review!
I love you Patriciaaaaaaaaaaa!!!
Where on eBay did u find the yezzys and can you reply with a link 🙏😂
Where has your Afro hair gone?  \nCan't stand black girls trying to look like a white girl it don't make sense???'
Where's the link for the yeezys tho? 😬😅
The yezzys on ebay arent real most of the time, chinese companies know the resell price and sells replicas for the price. Because legit cream whites go for 450$ canadian, a giant gap from your purchase sorry :(
Patricia you are so pretty!! 💓💓
The hook from your toes being squished comment 😂😂😂
Pavy stick glueeee😂😂😭💀💀
The last shoe tho
Try out Wish!

Patriciaaaaaa!! I'm glad your subscribers are increasing everyday. Can you do a little something in honor of your OG subscribers?? Like just chatting or relationship stuff. I feel fatigued by all of the spending you do lol. Not hating, but I love hearing your thoughts on life and stuff like that. Your latest videos are making me feel poor and quite demodée rofl 😂😂😂😂
Do a review on Romwe.com!!!
You look so cute with short hair! I love it! I'm feeling it! Girl you are fabulous
Hey, I am a shoe plug. Comment the best way to get in contact with you if you're looking for legit yeezys, Balenciagas, and more
Is anyone else seeing MacyDress on their Facebook page & do you think it's legit?
I loved the heels in the end , some in black would look so beautiful 💖

Crisis actors and fake reporting of a staged event.
Hey, isn't that Sophie Haworth reporting on the very incident she witnessed? What are the chances eh? And virtually all the other 'witnesses' have media connections too.. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................
More lies from the BBC zionists.\nEmma Stevie ; you are a terrible actress.
Layers of people...fuck off..this girl is a crisis actor..shit at it
Watch more of this phony fake witness here: https://vid.me/mAavy
Oooh they were skweeming and skweeming and it was the most awfullest expewience in my hole life!!! Do I get my money now?
So basically most people were injured from the stampede and not even the failed bomb. Lesson for people, stop stampeding when you suspect a situation, more people can be killed from a stampede than the actual attack
Can I ask why Emma told Sky news that it was she that lost her trainer yet in this interview she says it was someone else??? Notice how in every phoney fake 'attack' they lose their shoes. Sky helicopter panned onto the platform and lo and behold what do we see ........a pair of neatly placed black shoes and about a metre away a lone trainer. Freemason symbology that means the people participating are doing it of their own free will. Emma managed to mention in this one interview 1. ACID 2. LOST SHOES.3.MEN STRAPPED WITH BOMBS. Not scripted at all eh Emma???
Where do they find theae crappy actors? Why arnt these pillars of the news visiting the 29 injured people in the local a&e why is there a perfectly burning bucket in a plastic bag on a coach majesticaly alight with fairey dust? Sorry ide why is there no damage to the coach or even burn or scorch marks who do the bbc think they are kidding this has to be one of the worst staged terror attacks in history even worse that decrepid old krone zionist may has now raised the threat level so severe whens it going critical? And the ramifications of this act of insanity are mind blowing thats of course if anybody out there is even moderatly sane just observations nothing to worry about. This report has been brought to you all live from bailey rich & divixde and rule news room.
Does anyone believe this?   It is so obviously a drill gone live.
emma stevie still there! helping the news media with their comforting sound bites.
I know part and parcel is a made up quote, but this is part and parcel of living in cuck town
scripted..

Damage to the train carriage?
*I replaced the pink shirted girl with Daenerys.*
Read that as human centipede at first :D\nAnd on a serious note...bla bla bla immigration bla bla musles fish stick. Thank you. But seriously I am glad nothing too serious happened.
Errm where's the cordon and bomb squad to sort out that bomb that failed to detonate properly lmfao\n\nCome on people move along,\nWalk straight past bomb on your left please.....
I hope it was only liberals who were hurt.
*Europeans in 2039*\n''Shit... We have no where to go..''
This government seems more interested in political correctness than protecting its citizens from these continuous terrorist attacks.
I don't think we should jump conclusions and say that this was done Muslim terrorists. We now have to consider that Far Right extremist/ White power terrorist are now on the rise and fighting back. And if you thought that the Muslims were bad you ain't seen nothing yet.
Time for India to rule england. British govt is incapable of ruling itself and saving it's citizens from islamic terrorists. England needs to be converted to non-abrahmic religions to achieve peace and stability instead of that satanic dead god which they worship.\nbye.
Now she can apply for a bit part in Hollyoaks.
SHOW ME ...  I DONT BELIEVE A SINGLE WORD ...  MILLIONS OF SPY CAMERAS ..MOBILE PHONES ..  I wont believe it till you show the cctv footage ..  not one person without hair/eyelashes/beard/...  K ill H umanati  at it again ..   playing with our minds ...FEAR FEAR FEAR ...   BE AFRAID ...  the  ill/eat ...are afraid .. that's why they do this ..
this is a sad day for England and the injured people will need at least 6 months off work to recover from this,  there was allot of smoke and a loud bang,  as some people had their ears bandaged in other videos and this alone is a 7k payout ,
So BBC who did it ? Oh that's right fake news .

How long are you folks going to take this shit????
such a laughable fake event.

*Look upon the comments and weep*
She has the demeanor of someone talking about their favorite movie and seems to be suppressing a smile throughout the video. Can't say for sure that it's a false flag but yeah, it's a false flag... way to go BBC, fake news since 1922.

shame that bbc cow wasn't stampeded.
So it seems that all of the injuries were caused by the 'stampede' as opposed to the actual so-called 'explosion?'
We don't believe you lying sacks of shit
so the train doors shut, then there was an expolsion and she ran for her life? so presumably she has suoer human traits and can oass through glass?? there were layers of women underneath her screaming..??? not one bit of burn damge in carriage, no smasehd glass, and a smouldering little plastic bucket. a guy who said he was next to the so called bomb was injured? his hair was singed. she is taling aobut crush in a panic. the panic was the issue surely
Emma Stevie works at Delamar Academy, famous for doing make-up for films and TV. What's the connection there? Why isn't she even slightly upset, if she's been in a human pile-up and seen a kid with his face smashed in? Why has she been hanging around all day? Maybe for the free pizza and water, which were arranged in advance for the drill taking place?
F A L S E F L A G
EMMAAAA STEVIE............FUCKED!!!! YOU 'RE HOT GIRL, YOUR BODY, ASS, AND CURVES......SEE & CHECK HER INSTAGRAM BOYS....AND GIRLS WHO LIKES ASSES
If you believe this garbage again you need to seek HELP,,   war on terror is a hoax and so is their fabracted isis,,  the likes of the bbc is your real terrorists folks and its time you woke up to this fact,,
Why is this trending with only 64k views
Everyone gets on at Wimbledon BOI , Most people get on at Earl's Court or West Brompton WTF Where's the logic
Do the people complaining about immigration not realise most of these attacks are done by British Muslims?
Use your words...stampede, acid, crying little boy, chaos, flames, train.
I read this wrong...
I don't care if your police, i don't care if your a kid, i don't care if your pregnant, you best believe I'm stamping over every single body to get my fatass out
I had no idea you Brits had girls this pretty and intelligent. Maybe it was a mistake for us to fight the revolutionary war for independence from the Monarchy. With girls like that, I think I'm gonna start a petition to rejoin that government and instead of bowing to the Queen, I'm bowing to Emma.
Why there was no cctv,  every carriage has cctv? I want to see cctv of this accident
They really need to come up with better scripts for their crisis actors. It's getting more ridiculous every time they stage an attack.
Utter BS!!.I wonder how much she was paid for her extremely poor acting...lol....Why would you even do the noise of the train doors closing....Hahahahahahahahahaha!!
Notice she said we need more people on the underground, see in times like this you're all left to figure it out yourselves. When the unions complain of a system running on minimum numbers they aren't saying it for fun you know.
I just heard that there are 3,000 active investigations of potential terrorists in the UK and another 20,000 that police are concerned about. In the US our FBI has 6,000 possible Isis sympathizers under surveillance. Time to ban Islam and burn all Korans.
It must be horrific to be living your life and then one day a bunch of people show up and terrorise you day in day out!!\nIt's not like it's the1830's!!
I am really insulted by this shit. The BBC are actually saying This is how gullible and stupid we think you are
Wow...pathetic sheep.  Killing each other over nothing.  They were in no danger.  I avoid crowds.  People are very stupid.  This seems staged.

If you haven’t read my blog before, this “thoughts” category is intended to be a Kanye-style outlet, where I can ramble ’till my poorly edited heart’s content, then click “post”, sharing my thoughts with the internet. It’s really quite amazing I still have a job. LOL.\n\nLOTS of things rile me, but few things as much as Americans who staunchly defend their stoopid constitutional right to own and buy guns. Tossers. This comedian Jim Jefferies sums it up beautifully, hilariously and very poignantly:\n\n-Emma Stevie
Can we hear from the people this woman trampled on?
She doesn't sound very scared or shocked
Two days, 77k views, and trending?
I like her English
It's tough being a Muslim these days. To any fellow Muslims reading this ditch the ugly ass beards you guys have and dress like a regular westerner, that way people won't be able to suspect ur Muslim unless they ask. And females don't wear the hijab. Honestly for my Asian or middle eastern bros and sisters idk what you can do cos u stereotypically look and fit the description of a Muslim. Hope this helps
I feel so bad thats not even right man..\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/london-train-fire-help-teen-recover
they have not soul, they are barbaric and uncivilized.  they kill anyone.  they must be deported  and their families and friends.   they must leave our countries and stay away, far, far away.     merkels   ideas.   move with brexit, demand  immediately.  last time i was in england, i did not recognized it.   london is unsafe and  now plagued with terrorists.   do not travel to england.
The girl in pink is world famous now...she will be in a movie..will get a book deal. write a book...become a porn star...be at super market openings and dine with the royals...she will commended for her bravery and given a medal..she will be a millionaire by XMAS.
UK people are selfish and deserved to die more in the future.
And they ll still let more f these so called refugees in
Here is an example of, the dangers of taking in Child refugees from Muslim countries. They become a huge problem as they get older.
People say these are actors which I don't believe. Some people can handle stress better than others and if you get on the battlefield, you'll see what I mean. I have seen people shot in the head and was able to block it out and keep my composure, while others would practically have a mental breakdown and freak out. Seeing people killed with blood everywhere is not something that is enjoyable by any means, but you have to deal with it and move on. In the end we all have to go anyway.
Thanks Islam
I think we're witnessing the birth of the next biggest stars in music. These two guys have the most creativity and potential I've seen in many years. They are so different from most other artists on the charts today, and the reason is they are incredibly clever (genius, actually) with both the songs and their music videos. They mix their smooth voices with catchy, addictive rhythm, then they enhance this with a video that matches perfectly with the rhythm and progression. The stage presence they had on the Late Late Show with James Corden showed their energy and the clever choreography during the song. They are very, very impressive for such new artists (outside of Pentatonix, that is.) They will be taking the music charts by storm soon, I know it.
I never comment on anything but this literally left me speechless. Absolutely amazing!!
Mitch is so pure I can't
This is seriously my favourite song rn
My acne is cleared, my depression is no more, my crops are flourishing.
THIS TWO MONTH LONG COMMERCIAL FOR YOUR ALBUM IS SO AMAZING HOW MANY MORE MONTHS WILL THIS COMMERCIAL BE
WOOW! The amount of things happening in those 3:36 seconds 😮!! *I'M SHOOK*
When Scott hikes up his pants.  Real.  Cute.
the jacket that Scott is wearing jimin has it too on the DNA video
I feel bad for whomever had to clean their house after this
OMG ON 2:36 TO 2:42 SCOTT LITERALLY FELT MITCH UP
This music video was like a really snazzy superfruit-style house tour and I'm obsessed
at 1:35 when scott hit his head im cryinggggggg oh my
I wish they together I have a feeling that they’d be adorable and that they’d get a surprising amount of support
Can I just point out how absolutely beautiful 2:35 is?  Such an unconscious little moment of contact and Mitch automatically reaches for Scott's hand.  Ugh. ::sigh::  The relationship between these two gives me hope for the world.
That ever so slight hand brush at 2:38 though!
the girls at the end 😍😍
I... Love... this... song. It's my favorite one 🔝 your guys are amazing
I ❤ @SUP3RFRUIT but does anyone else think that on their album @scotthoying sounds like mitch's back up singer!?! #youcanhardlyherescott
blessing of this video: we get a house tour.
I didn't lik Mitch's mustash at first but I'm used to it now lol
Is no one gonna mention the minion
They did a Madonna 😂
scott has a jacket like jimin
Mitch looks like daddy. Fuck me up why dont you.
This is the most extra house tour I've ever seen.
ya music is lit as fucking shit
I haven't been able to watch the video because I didn't buy the album yet and I wanted to wait and I'm glad I did, this is the SHIT!
Is Scott wearing the same jacket Jimin wears in DNA?
YOU CAN'T WATCH THIS AND NOT BE HAPPY
Well today I'm kinda feeling like shit like always
@superfruit Loving the Hall and Oats vibe!
Mitch, honey, I love you\n\nbut that pornstach ...
What. I'm in LOVE
i recognize that jacket (DNA blairs in the background)
Guys, y'all can do better than this.
Mitch looks like a drug cartel leader with that mustache.
I'm getting mad Freddie Mercury vibes from Mitch with that mustache.
Hahaha I just noticed that Scott is wearing the same Gucci jacket as Jimin in BTS' new DNA mv! They both pull it off amazingly!!!
no offense but why Mitch looks like a cowboy anyway he's still fab
SOOOOOO.. SCOTT'S JACKET/BLAZER/WHATEVER IT'S CALLED,,, :) WHERE IS IT FROM??!!
The blurred last photo when obscured by the next video suggestions looks like porn. ;)
I love Scott's jacket!! 😍
Mitch please ............please get rid of that moustache please it doesn't suit you please I'm trying to be nice and this is my own opinion
who else saw scotty bumped his head? its at 1:36 people!
A behind-the-scenes vid for this would be hilarious
Scott is wearing Jimin´s jacket on the DNA MV ... just saying i love SUPERFRUIT ♥
THEM ENDING UP WHERE THEY DO SUPERFRUIT AT THE END MADE THE WHOLE THING
Idk about you guys but when they say how you feeling it reminds me of guava juice
My friend said this was weird HOW ITS SOOO FUCKING GOOD
Reminder kids: Don't make music videos when you're drunk.
Omg Mitch and that mustache is 😍😍
THEIR HOUSE IS HUGE DAMN
OMG That's their house!!!! Why did they do that? Fav vid!!!!😜😍
love this concept ! wish some of the activities that took place were more realistically portrayed though
If only parties like this happened where I live 😐
I WANT TO HEAR THIS ON THE RADIO
WHEN THEY CHANGED THE THUMBNAIL
This Video is also a low key house tour
Obsessed With Scott’s Jacket ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m sorry I can’t with the mustache the song is bomb affff tho
I'm feeling really really good after watching this O_O AMAZING
Has anyone ever thought about what Mitch and Scott's past self would say if they reacted to Future friends part 1/2? It randomly came to my mind and I'm really curious!
Did anyone notice the thumbnail changed?
I'm too obsessed with you guys it's starting feel unhealthy
Officially one of my favorite songs of the album! 😭😭😭🙌🙌🙌
I thought that bearded guy at 3:09 was Avi
Mitch looks so hot with that tash!! mmmmm
Jimin's sparkle jacket!!!
YAAASSS SUPERFRUIT. would your fans be called fruitflies?
Damnit Mitch shave
Scott you are creepy
YEEEEESSSSS QUEEN!!!!

2:56 is literally a scene from qaf😍... eh, nostalgia.... The place is huge and absolutely loved the little homage to their youtube channel at the end<3
I love Scott's outfit \nSo cute \nYAAAAS QUEENS 👸❤️
I need mitch and scott to make out
They changed their thumbnail? Why? It’s ADORABLE but why? 🤔
Are they gay
Yasss 😍 I am here for the diamonds on the teeth I love it! Where did you get them
Nicole u look great I don't know what it is but you look different but good.Your skin looks fantastic and ur face is glowing.
Y'all are trippin' she looks bomb AF!
Is her glow kit palette with ABH ever going to be restocked?? ):
But mostly, I love your cats
More vlogs please ❤❤
gorgeous! Love you so much Nicole
I'm in Highlands County, most damaged next to the Keys, we just got power yesterday. 9 days but thankful it wasn't worse.
I missed your makeup videos boo 😩😍😘💕
ava
I can't wait for the queen of halloween to arrive 😍😍😍
I think you need the next darker shade in shapetape or one that has more yellow undertone. Maybe mixed with something. It just looks slightly too white but who knows, it may be cause the darker foundation or u just might like it like that too lol it just stands out when its not on your chin or forehead. But I love the eye colors. I just bought your lil gimme me brow at sephora the other day!
Love this look! I'll be at Gen Beauty. Can't wait to meet you!!! Warning I might cry lol.
Definitely just gonna go get you in Sephora cuz there are some youtubers that I don't support on that combo box 😅
Yay hope to see you at GEN beauty. I'm a mother of 4 and a recovering opiate addict I am celebrating my 4 years clean Sunday. I'm so happy I get to go to GEN beauty cause I never get to splurge on makeup.
OMG I hope I can make my dream come true of meeting you this weekend at GEN Beauty!!!! I will be the 1st one on that line!! Love you!!!!
Dumb question but why did you have to hunt for water? Isn't there a tap in your house
This reminded me of Kate Walsh. Idk why. Really pretty
You're a FOX, right from the box...the makeup is miraculous...ya wake up before 8 every day, I'll bet!
Awesome video! Do you have lipstick on your teeth at the end? :)
the blush ruined the whole look but I love the eyes and lips
I love you more than life but this background drove me crazy because it was so close to your skin color 😭
I'm not a vlog person so I'm glad you're back with your good ol' makeup tutorials! AND I LIVE FOR YOUR HALLOWEEN TUTORIALS I'M SO EXCITED.
Glad you guys are good!! I love about and 1hr 49 minutes north of you we lost power thatsunday night @9 and currently are still without it.
I missed your makeup videos soooo much
😍😍😍😍
The blush and her brows😣 I feel like they looked better before she filled them in 😭
I'm glad to know that you and your family are alive and well!! Omg I miss your dark lip tutorials🙈😊!! And This look is amazing!! 😊😊, super excited about Halloween and more!! \nWould you mind telling me the name of the song in this vid?🙈 I love it!!
It took me half the video to realize that your hoops aren't closed! I thought your hair was stuck in them lmao. They super cute tho!
Your look is kind of confusing to me. 1. Your lips are bold but beautiful. 2. Your eyes are intense but beautiful. 3. Those brows are just  fierce girl. 4. The blush is also very bold...I thought in makeup one is supposed to find a focal point and BALANCE the rest. I don’t know where to look as there is so much going on while independently it looks nice. Your face is competing for attention within itself. Nice Halloween vampy look tho.
Nicole where are your open hoops from?
Are those ear rings that are made to look like little gauges? Or are they really little gauges? If they aren't real where are they from? They are too cute
I love the way you look!  I am a blonde with big blue eyes.  Would I be able to pull off this look?
Yes please to Halloween vids 😄😄🕷🕷
Girl, I feel you on the brows. I was growing mine out too and I FINALLY got them done last week. I look like a whole new person! lolz. I have faith in you!
omg yass I am glad youre all good ! So GLAD to have you back! cannot wait for your halloween looks , xox
I loved seeing u
Im glad your back and safe but the blending of eyeshadow in this look is no bueno at all. At the very end when she shows he lip colour you can see the craziness. Way to much blush and too much concealer.  Ayyy :(.
Hey girl, can you tell me where you got your earrings?? I am loving them.
i couldnt help but to notice that i thought i saw something on your tooth or is it just me? but i love you <3
Hey girl.. sry writing from my sons YouTube channel.. I think you should get a clip mic.. maybe wireless.. that way we can here you lens autofocus.. that's what I do for his channel anyway.
I'm in that eyebrow stage too when I'm ready to just go get them waxed 🙄
So glad you guys are all safe. But girl bring back the damn vlogs!!!! :)
Glad you guys doing okay. Prayers for florida..
chola drag vampire look..
Omg I feel you, I live in Miami and stayed while hurricane Irma and I ate sooo bad and I broke out like crazy 😑
slaying as always!! love you xx
Giiirrrrl! That blush tho, cray cray
People keep bringing up about her tooth . She mention a few videos ago she has a diamond on her tooth people !!!!!!!!
yasss bitchhh
What brush did you use to blend the concealer and set it?
Love it! Talk about ur tooth candy when did u get it? Look so cute
Omg I almost thought this was a Halloween look for a witch ... 😭😭😭no I'm not kidding that's my honest opinion I love how she does her makeup I'm not a hater that was my first thought 🤔🤔
I'm trying to grow my brows out too...it's so hard because they look so bad but we can get through this!
I like so much
Omg I love you Nicole,  I can't wait for halloween video!!!
I live in Lee County Florida and we got a direct hit from Irma. We lost power for 5 days.
I agree on the nude lip..  It's like, and here's what I look  like if I don't put lipstick on.
It's not lipstick on her teeth it's a diamond 😂😂😂😂
Absolutely loving those nails! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You got super lucky. I live here too. It wasn't that it was a cat 2. It's because when it hit Naples Irma decided to head towards Orlando instead of Tampa. If it didn't turn we would really be hurting. I feel very lucky too.
Girl I grew my brows out from the end of March to the end of August lmao YOU CAN DO IT
Since you love music you should check out my bros band IN REAL LIFE ! They just released their music video for EYES CLOSED in Times Square
can u please, do a unicorn halloween theme. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The blush is too much for me and emphasises the texture and the eyebrows are way too dark. The overall look is giving me Maleficent vibes for some reason.
I feel like people talk alot about them hoping the hurricame didnt hit them but then it did but not too bad. Like come on..when you are hoping it didnt come your way..it was moving through some.other area and destroyed people's lives. India and parts of africa was under water...waist high but yall out here wishing it didnt hit yall but not caring who it did hit. Smh.
I love u and u always look bomb but mama - those earrings... no boo boo- just no haha
Here's a little tip - if you want to test different makeup brands but don't have the money to purchase all the products then ==gaip.club== is giving away complimentary sample bundles. I got mine 3 weeks ago with no hassle.
When you lost power for 5 days and you couldn't see Nicole's new video and just remembered you missed it! This made my day lol
You're looking good girl 💁🏻so excited for the Halloween videos 🙌🏻
I love it Can't wait for Halloween I'm so excited to see what you have for us
You look genuinely happy and you are just glowing!
Happy that y'all are safe!! Love love love your dark hair and this eye look!!
Lol you got a little lipstick on your tooth momma 😘 beautiful look regardless
Love it!
The eyebrows 😐
This looks like the one you did years ago. I still love that video
Giving me Nicole 2013 viiibesssss!!!
Yes girl you need to keep those brows under control lol...
I like your brows girl!!!!
Loved this!!  Does anyone know what brush she used for her under-eye concealer?  I can't tell but I WANT IT.  Thanks in advance!
are we not gonna talk about your bedazzled teeth?? I love it😂😂😂
I love love SAVAGE!! You look stunning like always!
Honestly, I forgot about you when this notification popped up. Be more present, girl!
Ahhh so beautiful as always so glad you're safe
Soooo Sooooo Happy that you and your family are Good.
I live near Nicole and I lost power for 3 days and didn't get wifi and cable for 6 days but thank god everyone in our area are okay 😌
Love the eyes but the blush threw off this look way off 😬❤️
Beautiful
love it
I swear, my loyalty to Nicole will never change.
WAMPSN get $10 when u sign up on mercari using this code plus 10% ur first purchase : ) u could get free makeup.
All the comments complaining on how she does her make-up... Come on? She is different than you and me. If she likes a more heavier blush SHE CAN, if she wants a lighter under eye, SHE CAN. That's the beauty of make-up, everyone can do what they like!  She did mention her foundation was too dark and went it with to give us an awesome vampy make-up tutorial anyway. She is herself, she doesn't change her ways to satisfy the opinion of others. \n\nCan't wait for Halloween tutorials 🤗🤗👻🕷🕸🎃
Wow, I really hate all make-up!
That face texture is real. Idk why people be posting flawless pics of these looks on IG but do you guys see how bad looks in the video? I mean it's not cute.
Did she start stretching her ears? Because if she did thats bomb af.
https://www.gofundme.com/hermano-luis-felipe-vasquez-ramirez
For one of your Halloween tutorials can you do a glam bride of Frankenstein (: love ya 💕
OMG!!! I HOPE YOU GET PREGNANT SOON CUZ YOU IS  GLOWING!!!!!!🤗✨🍂🌙🎃🖤
Am I the only one who HATES the Shape Tape concealer? 😩
Rest in Peace Harry
Rest in peace Harry.  You were fucking awesome.
Taken by that increasingly rare ailment 'natural causes'. Rest in peace, Harry.

RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
Beautifully done. I never knew he was a singer.
What a man. What feeling his face and voice conveyed.Today is for crying, but all the tomorrows will be for celebration of a beautiful life well lived.
REST IN PEACE  MR. STANTON,  LONG LIVE YOUR TALENTS  🕊😔⚘🎵🎥💕
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton. You were loved.
RIP Harry. Thank you for sharing your talent for so many for so many years. Til the other side...
Rip Harry
Fifty years ago I went to the pictures to watch Cool Hand Luke  and I enjoyed him singing Just a Closer Walk With Thee which was brilliantly evocative, and very apropos. I think that was the first time I'd ever heard a religious song that wasn't dull. This clip is good, VG considering his age and the effects age has upon the vocal chords.\nHe should have sung more during his career.
He was great in Repo Man.
Always loved your gentleness and modesty.
wow!! so long Tramp, you done damn good!! rest in peace Mr Stanton.
Rest in peace Harry. You were a multi talemted performer and we enjoyed every minute with you.
good-bye Harry Dean Stanton, The screen will never see your like again
You did it, my friend. You lived a full and complete life. It's a pity that we have only one to life to accomplish it.
rest in peace, dear Harry..  i loved you
Powerful ..... on the same level as Johnny Cash cover of Hurt... RIP.

Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
He still has a presence
Lovely.  I used to know Dean.
Mashed me up ♥
Like it:)
Too late, it's my profile picture for now.
0:53 when you want to do more than just kiss the fat boy.
He reminds me of Spencer from Criminal Minds
I love his non demonic smile. I think I might have a crush on him!
Is it just me or this guy would play good as Joker
00:54 is the best part 😍
Imagine what his school pictures were like 😂👌
He should have did a sinister laugh with that smile
He has huge hands, he must have a big one...so cute!
I really love Bill and I hope he will play a lot of big roles in movies and shows.
That smile looks like a retarted smile than scary😂
I'm less scared of it now looking at him
1:20 and how's ur lil brother doing now?\nhe's floating
I can do that smile too!
i think he can be great joker

The tonight show with Conan o Brian
100% people tried his smile when he did it
I CAN DO THAT SMILE TOO!!, OMG
I’m sorry but that remake was a disgrace
Candidate for The Joker?
I thought he were Steve buscemi son...
HAH. Swedish here💁🏻 finally Sweden come up with a good person hahaha
Not fit to lace Tim Curry's boots.
his brother has a good  creepy laugh for floki in Vikings
i straight up still think he's hot af
i can do that too wow he's brother is a beast
He literally looks like my friend all growned up wtf.
It's supposed to be scary but damn he fine!!! 😍😭
He’s so cute 😭😭❤️
and he would be like 'not again!' LOL
I love his dad.
that is one rapey face
Here comes the 0:53 jokes now
He could be the next joker in batman
someone needs to draw that face he chased his little brother around with
There’s just somethin’ about that beaauuuuttiful smile
I can do the same lip thing & its funny my brother can do it to.
He is the next JOKER, he has to be man
he looks just like Steve Buscemi
hhhahahaha rly funny. it reminds me of my childhood when my brother scared me with his ugly face
When a girl talks to me this is my immediate smile
Bill skardgard has got a naturally scary face he could make a real good Joker
Now I know why his name is Skarsgard.
I have such a crush on bill ♥️😂
I'm in love with him.
That fat man is resembling me Ben in his childhood.
I don’t know why but when i saw that smile when i went to see the movie and he was in the sewer, he was cute 😂 then he bit the kid's arm off and i’m forever traumatized of sewers. I’m 17 and afraid of red balloons and sewers 😂
0:52 when i see my friend's mom :)
i can do the smile
He was a convincing actor in hemlock grove. It comes as no surprise that he would fit the role of penny wise.
THIS IS TRENDING IN FINLAND OH MY G OD
For Some reason i'll Repeat this Vids Many Times😂
0:53 when you get a online roblox girl friend
He looks like a creepy paedophile himself anyway, doesn't even need the clown suit, still have no idea what all these people are seeing when they say he's good looking. He was good in the film ill give him that does well as a psycho but again it's probably cause he is one
conans hair and hair line makes him look like pennywise naturally
Superawesome movie!
Lovechild of Willem Dafeo and Steve Buscemi.
He kinda looks like Harry styles
That smile tho 7w7

Rest in peace
Rest in peace Harry Dean Stanton.
Just heard he passed, this was the first film I ever saw him in and he introduced me to this amazing song, travel well brother x
Now you're there buddy, now you're there.
I remember a couple of years ago rewinding this part over a few times because he sang this so sweet. You could tell he'd lived some life. RIP.
Rest now. You're in the grace of glory forever more. R.I.P Harry Dean Stanton. 1926-2017
Rest in peace and with the lord near
Harry Dean Stanton is the best - under appreciated actor of all time! Hands down, unless you count 'leading' actors.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
R.I.P., HDS.
RIP Harry Dean
Stanton died today. 15 September, 2017.
Just a closer walk with thee, Mr Stanton,- rest in peace.
RIP...Ah was just watching Partly Fiction last night and remarked- There's the Last of a Certain Breed of Men.......Probably the last Hollywood veteran of WWII.
this is so saf
Harry Dean Stanton passed away today. The last movie I remember him in was The Last Stand with Arnold Schwarzenegger. We have a countless number of films he played in to remember him by. Christine, Repo Man,  Paris Texas, Dillenger, Two Lane Blacktop, Fire Down Below, and the list goes on and on. R.I.P. Mr. Stanton. You will be missed.
do u kiddies even realize how big a legend this movie and HDS is????
He performs it, just like the old blues legends, very great !
Safe travels Harry.
RIP Harry
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Rip
RIP Harry.
If I fall dear lord who cares?
Their all gone now. Luke, Dragline, Society Red, Loudmouth Steve, Babalugats, Alibi....the Captain. The only one left is Koko. RIP Tramp!
now there ain't nothin' to come back for
how much homosexy did they do in this movie?
I was watching youtube videos the other night, and got caught in the mode where you keep getting suggested videos to watch. I passed on most, but wound up watching this, as Cool Hand Luke is one of my all time favorite movies, and I've always loved Harry Dean Stanton. Kind of surreal to me that the next day after watching this, he had passed on. If you've ever compiled a list of your favorite top 10 or 20 movies, there's a pretty good chance Harry acted in one or more of those movies.
A solid actor. Multitalented. Unforgetable in any scene. Job well done Sir.

RIP HARRY & THANKS 4 THE MEMORIES MAN 💖 ✌ X X X
That Paul Newman didn't win the Academy Award for best actor in this movie is a joke. Paul Scofield, A Man for All Seasons was great, but Luke is an iconic film character creation.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton. Just saw him in the new Twin Peaks
:'(   Rest in Peace Harry. You will be sorely missed buddy   :'(
May God grant him eternal peace. We'll miss you, Harry!
Rest In Peace Mr Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. Thank you for this, sir.😥
Watching Cool Hand Luke now and I thought that was him.  RIP Harry.
Repo man; got all night every night R.I.P. 🌈🐺🌈🌵🌈🗿🌈🐎🌈🌅*
Rest in Peace Mr. Stanton.
Rest in peace good sir
Rest in peace, Harry.
Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
I love this man. RIP\nHarry Dean.  When I\nfeel real down, this tune sung\nand strummed by him always \nsoothes me.
Rest in peace Harry one of my heroes . Thank you
This movie was like Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. Both protagonists and stories seem like everyday scenes, the everyman trying to resist and overcome far greater and malevolent forces. Then you realise these are spiritual works of art. It isn't by chance that HDS is playing spirituals while they are trying to break Luke's spirit out there by the ditch, or here, saying goodbye to his mother. Quite a sad scene!
Such a great movie
great actor!!  last time I saw him was in a Two and a Half Men episode.  Cameo w/ Chris Penn and Elvis Costello, sittin' around talkin' in Charlie's living room.    FUNNY!    REPO MAN WAS SOO AWESOME,  I BOUGHT THE LP.  first punk lp.  I ever owned.   REST IN PEACE HARRY.  beautiful life and career.
His latest performances on showtime Sundays at 9:00 p.m.,on the return of Twin  Peaks He plays the guitar there once or twice as well
Handful o' legends
RIP.
Rip good sir

R.I.P Harry
RIP Harry 😪
The best version of this song I ever heard is by the chambers bros.i,ve heard hundreds of versions.the bros do a fantastic job.great !!!!!!
🌈R.I.P. 🌈🗿🎸🎤🌵🌄🙌🎪💔*
Memorable song,  part of such a great movie, as its my personal favorite and quite possibly Newman's finest hour and his personal choice i do believe ? Harry Dean Stanton and his contribution is to his credit, RIP Harry
It just creeps up on you, powerful.
Why isn't this song part of the soundtrack? did mr.stanton ever record this song?
he croaked today, rip!
I wish Harry had recorded a full version of this.
Damn that is so great.
That brother is feeling it.  I can't sing or even listen to this tune without feeling it.
Harry's version is definitely best - wish he'd done the whole thing. Try Judith Durham - seekers for one that comes close.
pure class, from writing to music to acting, simple yet so deep
Man.......this movie. I think Paul Newmans best......ever. And he made so many that were over the top.
The closest to this I can find is by Judith Durham - wish Harry had done a full version but Judith's is excellent.
:(. ..
Comes a time the bitch don't recognize the pups no more...  -Harold Dean Stanton,... Last one standing might be appropriate after witnessing the sendoff they gave Dennis. Tough Motherfuckers to be sure. I met Harry Dean in '89 at the original Hollywood Billiards-(the brick building that fell in during the Northridge quake). I'd met some people already and was on the move in L.A. Some friends that ran the original Zero Club-(Wayzatta Cameroon-Mark Boyd and brother Scotty Boyd-great man/guitarista). We showed up to HB and walking in found Harold Dean holding court in a booth and completely lit, and blathering coherently. I was introduced and realized that this was the wrong time for such 'protocol'. He said-Nice to meet you Dave and that was my first big movie star encounter in Los Angeles. You would have had to have been there. series of true and actual events in the City of Angels. This being one of the least of them. Great singer, and pure American talent-\nHarry Dean Stanton. Not since that dog put his tongue on the butter. -Greatest role ever- Missouri Breaks.
now get ain't no grave...
lol they sing drunk
Funny, I love Nicholson's expression on the sour note.
that is a tribute to the everly brothers - everybody knows and loves that song......
a few scorched notes but so nice; I used to know Dean.
What happened to Hollywood?   lol
I love this!
God bless Phil Everly and what a beautiful way to remember him - except playing the original records, of course...
Priceless! 
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton, One of the best actors ever.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton! \nOne of the best :(
Just saw this movie for the first time. If I knew how good it was, I would've watched it a long time ago.
Harry Dean Stanton, genius character actor who broke through to the lead role in Paris Texas
night, day? doesn't mean shit...
0:16  My drive to work
A character actor who often outshined the star actors. Without Harry Dean Stanton Repo Man wouldn't be as memorable. RIP
Rest in peace, Harry Dean Stanton!
You find one in every car,,,
I was in college saw this movie almost every day \nHDS-RIP
RIP...he lived by the Actor's Code
Just adding my remembrance of Harry Dean Stanton in this essential clip for him from the movie we should thank him most for making, the most GenX cult film, one of the most essential films of the 1980s, and one of the best cinematic depictions of LA ever.\n\nAlways in small roles in so many '80s films that I enjoyed or remembered when I was young. Always added to those films in some way, as the late Roger Ebert noted, even if there wasn't much to add to.\n\nI was pleased to read that he actually kept at it until his death ... I hadn't seen anything with him in it since Anger Management and almost didn't recognize him there because of the makeup (but his voice was one of a kind).\n\nIf you want to see him in a more central role, to see him really show his range, I heartily recommend Paris, Texas. Long but good, from an actor's standpoint.
RIP Harry Dean\nyou made this movie so great
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. You attained Legend Status. Good on you.
Cool Hand Luke  Kellys Heros any movie Harry was in was better for havin him in it . .  .RIP Harry
When I was a kid--- AKA adolescent punk wannabe in the '80s--- I wanted to be the old guy.\nI'm middle-aged now (a bad look for a punk), and I still do.\nNo character actor ever OWNED a movie like Harry Dean Stanton. Rest in peace, hangdog; see ya in the Big Parking Lot in the Sky....
Damn a lot of comments. Shame people have to die for their work to be recognized......
Rest in Peace, Mr. Stanton.  :*(
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. Life of a repo man is always intense.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Harry Dean Stanton was one badass actor!  Godspeed brother!
later days harry.......
Rip Mr Stanton
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
1:07 code , 1:43 tense situations ,
RIP Harry!
Only an a$$hole gets killed for a car
Ordinary fuckin' people. I hate 'em.
Yet, despite his disheveled appearance, you get the sense that Bud has a compassionate side to him and, deep-down, he wants to do something meaningful with his life. So he tries teaching Otto all about the repo man trade as fast as possible and, later, dies while trying to get the box. And even Otto comes around to feeling a kinship with Bud at the end by pleading with him, Only an asshole gets killed for a car! This is what makes 'Repo Man' such a great movie--the characters are interesting and you care what happens to them.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
RIP HDS
RIP, Harry Dean.
R.I.P. Bud
RIP HARRY.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton \n\nProper legend
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.

love this film, every teen should see it
Harry Dean Rulz
1:34 Hey. Look at that. Look at those assholes over there. Ordinary fuckin' people. I hate'm.
Suddenly, Auto gets interested when his mentor mentions the consumption of speed as one of the perks to his new job!
Have a nice day\nNight\nNight, day, it doesn't mean shit to me
this film is incredible!  it's a monster mix of laughs and humor
Come on dickhead!
Otto.. he seems to rise above his friends, who are going in the other direction, committing acts of armed robbery.. Repoman, has a code.
Now humans do not have to snort the powder, they only need prescriptions from the medical industries.
I could go for a couple cans of drink right about now.
Harry is such a machine.  Repo Man is a cult classic and that is great dialouge but his delivery makes it even better.
1:35 Ordinary People.....
Speed huh??
Ordinary fuckin' people - I hate 'em.
'movieclips' just for when you thought life had ripped you off enough
Tense situations, kid....
The subtitles on your clips are extremely annoying.
this movie is about farting in a market
THats asimov
Jesus...this kinda sorta blew my mind. I never ever got Norm...I respected the fact he clearly had a pretty stellar career and lots of people seem to like him, but I never really got it. So this video really challenged my assumptions and made me completely rethink something I've just assumed about and judged forever. Bravo for sparking that in me....this makes me want to thumbs up this video all the more. Also...I didn't realize Norm was so damn smart and educated. I've been a total sucker for buying into his act...without ever once stopping to look into who he was as an actual person. I'm now a Norm fan...time to start delving into his entire catalog and history....
Watched Norms Netflix Special, 'Hitler's Dog: Gossip & Trickery' four times, love it. Charming meandering slightly dark humor, if you're 40+ you'll appreciate his humor. The Lee Majors and Hitler's Dog jokes got big laughs!
When you have to tell people he's a comic genius, it's because the vast majority don't think he's a comic genius. So, thanks for letting us in on this unknown fact nerd.
Great video! Love some Norm xD
great breakdown. he is amazing and i love him
does anybody knows the ending song from the video about logan?
That moth story wasnt funny. It's just endless blather with a mediocre punchline(look haha, you waited all that time for that shitty punchline, haha). Great comedians have a philosophy and an attitude to share. Not this guy it seems. \nIf you want what this guy is trying to do, but well done, try Hannibal Buress\nWant a great refined comic try patrice o neal.
do one on Sean Evans' show 'Hot Ones'. There's a video of him eating a carolina reaper with Chilli Klaus. He talks about how people drop their guards when their mouths are burning, especially with celebrities who have to portray an ideal persona in front of a camera. I think its quick sick how he utilizes this phenomenon to create interesting interviews, because at first glance you're not quite sure what's so intriguing, its just people eating hot food after-all.
Hey @Nerdwriter1 I'm curious to see what you can come up with doing some research into Trevor Noah and his career and comedy. PLs leave a comment if you decide to go down this road :) or if you think Nerdwriter should do a video on it :)
this channel its only getting better and  better. I always thought that Norms art was something that needed to be understood and analyzed. it surprised me that someone actually did. Keep the good work going!!!
Heyyy.. I don't know how else to get in touch with you so I'm posting it as a comment here. Your website is down.. I'm not sure why but then I when I tried to access your must reads page.. It didn't work.. Please try to fix it. Thank you for the videos you do And waiting for more content from you. Bye.
Nice one! Any thoughts on Stardust?
Do a video on the millennial whoop please.
9/11
do the great ERIC ANDRE
more beatles!!!
What is that music at the end? Please tell me It's amazing.
That Moth Joke Punshline is brilliant in so many ways , hilarious
Can you do one on Mitch Hedberg's comedy?
Love Norm. Okay, can you watch The Vietnam War and do an essay on Ken Burns? Or not. I'll take a stab at it.
Norm has always been my favorite ever sense I was a kid
Now that was funny. (The punchline, not the video, though, that was enjoyable too.)
Thank you for introducing so many people to my favourite comedian! I love you!
This guy was a real jerk!
Thank you for putting me on to Norm MacDonald. So good!
I use norm jokes/lines in real life every chance I get. most the time people don't get it. I care not.
That punchline at the end was worth it.
I didn't get Norm until he was explained to me in earnest tones with jaunty  background music. CHEERS MATE
This video was sponsored by Man Grate!
Hey can you do one of your videos on prison break? I would love to see how you interpret it.
Yeah, Norm tells too many shaggy dog stories to be truly funny. By the time he's done, I've lost interest and don't remember the setup enough to find the punchline funny. He does this because he's lazy. It's far easier to tell a half dozen or so shaggy dog stories and call it a comedy special than than to think up funny material worth our time. \n\nMost of his jokes are puerile in nature and are no better than a poor _Knock-knock joke._ He just takes it too far and stretches it into another of his shaggy dog stories that were much better left alone as Knock-knock jokes.
Great video man, he is a singular comedian, something to add is that he improvises must off his long jokes and tries to find sparks of funniness in the way, but at the same time he has a beacon of safety of  jokes he thinked before if he loses the path in the way, love him man is like he jumps off a cliff everytime he starts saying something, and hope that his stream of consciousness gives him wings to dont crash in the pavement, but when he crashes is still hilarious.
Do you work for vox?
Norm Macdonald is totally polarizing. Love him. I was jerking punks off under the Queensboro Bridge until I found his work.
I was following you until I saw sarah silverman on the comedy greats screen
The last few months I have become obsessed with Norm. and voila! a video which explains why he is so unique and why I am so drawn to his humor like a moth to a flame
he's nothing on stewart lee tho, brits do this sort of comedy far better
Thanks for shining a light on him for all us moths!
How about a video on Rick and Morty?
Man, your voice-overs are getting better! You sound more serious, and less like you want to be smooth or seductive.
Please do Rick and Morty!
Please do one on Stewart Lee... PLEASE EVAN!
I….don't see it.
You should do a video about Mitch Hedberg because he was a genius.
Never seen this channel before, but as a Norm fan and a nerd writer myself, I appreciate the coverage. New subscriber.

Strongly agree, on all points. \n\nI believe I recall watching one of his candid discussions (I believe with Letterman maybe?) where Norm's comedic personality was discussed and I recall it being mentioned that...to paraphrase...too many comics try to be intellectual but Norm understands...play the simpleton. Be the everyman. Because if the audience sees you trying to be the smartest person in the room, they're going to hate you.\n\nBut I believe, to anyone who investigates further and listens more closely, his brilliance becomes evident.
Never watch SNL but after watching this I definitely need to look him up!
That last joke stolen from Billy Connelly if I'm not mistaken.
backgrounds of red screens with yellow accents, McDonald analogy?
I DISAGREE completely, Norm Macdonald is NOT a funny man.
I can definitely appreciate him and his craft more now, but yea, I don't think he's funny :(
I thought the video had something to do with McDonald's. And now I'm all hungry.
greatest of all time.
Huh, newfound respect for the way my Grandpa told jokes <3
Duh. What's next, a video on why Bob Dylan is an amazing songwriter? ...Oh wait...
This video was so brilliantly edited!
when uncle terry's been drinking... you don't fuck wit him
This video essay was excellently written and put together. Love Norm, love the video!
Love the red and yellow haha\n\nBut Im shocked to read a lot of comments that never heard of Norm
Nerdwriter - do you take requests? One of my favorite films is No Country for Old Men. ( I saw that ending coming, I swear I did!) I have my opinions about what it means, but I would love to hear your analysis.
I love this kind of long story telling humor.\n\nThere a guy that does his jokes like this.\nHe talk about the little things of his daily life. Then he start rambling and we end up forgeting what was the first point he was talking about, but that doesn't matter as his story telling mastery is to a point where although he end up making 4 hour long shows, every minute of it is an hysterical burst of laugh. \n\nThis kind of comedy is the best to me.\nIt require true skill to be able to pull this.
I just find out a great comic character i've never heard of ! :) Thanx Nerdie !
Norm would watch this video and completely disagree and say 'I'm just telling jokes man', he's awesome
Am I the only one who remembered that JD used to tell this moth joke to a girl once in scrubs?
Why do avoid a case study of the Mona Lisa ?
not my cup of tea. Like I get the jokes but the pay off is not worth the time I spent listening to it.
You should do a video on Stewart Lee
more canadian comics, they have ruled for years! jim carey?
This is a dude who nearly won $1,000,000 on Millionaire.
Where can I find that joke about the body
I'm so glad you uploaded this. Norm is one of my favorite comedians. I think his work, though underrated, is genius.
comedian tells long drawn out jokes, not pandering to different styles of comedy. WOW - way to stretch out 1 sentence into 8 minutes
This video has changed my week so far.\nNorm really is a hidden gem, much like Stanhope.
Love norm, like your vids, felt this was a weak one as i didnt really learn how/why norm is a genius past He's brilliant because he's smart. Just felt like a lot was left on the table. Maybe ill like it more when I come across it again in a year or two :)
Similar commitment to their own personal comedy: John Roderick and Merlin Mann
This guy sounds just like Lagos Cargo
Maybe I'm one of the people who doesn't find him funny. Where's the joke
Could you do a video on howard stern?
in Norm Macdonald Live Sarah Silverman episode , she spotted Norm's wordplay and exposed it in a light way , part.1 minute 6:00 \n\nSarah really gets norm's comedy a lot more than everybody else
Please do a video about Stewart Lee.
Why am I watching a video on Norm Macdonald when I can watch brokeback mountain and watch a cock slip into some guys hot beautiful asshole
that outro song though
I love Norm MacDonald.
Turd Ferguson. Funny name
Stewart Lee?
Great vid Nerdwriter!
Thank you
#NormGod
Dude relax it's just norm Mcdonald

I LOVE Norm.
Phil Hartman, I dare you.
OMG i love this.
Please do Patrice O'Neal
So fucking boring.
Jim Jeffries
Yea, he seems okay, I think I still prefer Amy Schumer
Monty Python next?
Come on man, when people say he doesn't give a fuck, what they mean is that he doesn't care about being politacally correct or simply that he cames out with the weirdest shit. What are you down syndrome?
Why does it have to be SO EXPENSIVE 😭😭
I know it not fashionable but I would love to see a MAC review from their permanent line. You usually only see the LE collections.
the packaging is why it costs more i think also the product looks great on you.. I would love to buy some totally worth a splurge :) i am not a big buyer of make up these days but when I see this especially by Victoria I am hooked lol thanks for sharing Xx
Wrong celebrity love
Once upon a time Victoria Beckham was putting her name to cheese and onion crisps. Now look at her collabs.. those prices!
Will you be doing a review on the Fenty Beauty line
It all looks so gorgeous and I love the make up look. Maybe I could afford one thing 😁
if you could only get one product which is then you'd recommend?
So beautifullll love this! Is expensive but worship😍💄💋
If my skin was THAT flawless I would never wear foundation.
Hi there, I’m a new subscriber:) could you link the earlier video where you used the darker foil with the darker shadow please :)
Maybe Eddie took the brush? I´m kinda wondering if you found it!
Thanks for doing a real close up!!
Hi Nic. Can you recommend some dupes for the powder eyeshadows?
Is the mascara smudge proof?\nMany thanks 😘
There's a brand that's becoming popular in the U.S. called Maskcara, and I'd like to know your opinions on the entire set.
loved this video! you seem so relaxed, i hope you're doing as good as you look :) i also appreciate how honest you are with your reviews, thank you so much for being real and not trying to bash a company or selling us anything!
I'd love to see your take on Fenty Beauty by Riri
Can I ask you to do the review of clarins makeup please?)
I didn't expect the bronzer to be as beautiful as it is! It looks so dull and light in the pan, but when you put it on your face, it was beautiful!
Please have my baby
I would love to see a video about Fenty Beauty.
I think I'm going to grab the mascara. I am such a fan of any mascara that grabs all my lashes. In not sure of any of the other products. Thank you for being honest😘
Could you try bare minerals please ❤️
So beautiful. I am in love with a lot of her make up. Wish I could treat myself. Will try to if I can get hold of some. Xx
Where are your earrings from?
Thanks for the video, would love to see you do a Laura Geller video please :-) x
For the one brand tutorial I would like to see a Natasha Denona one too if you can Nic 😘
No 7 video would be nice
Could you do a brand review on Hourglass? And Laura Mercier? Xx
that look is pretty
I'd love for you to do a No7 Makeup tutorial/review! I don't see those very often and I think there are some decent thing within the brand for less bank breaking prices.
Lovely review, have you stopped using your lilash serum? Could you do update review on it x
It sounds weird but I love that greasy eyelid look. Do these transfer during the day?
I'd love to see a Clarins makeup tutorial!
I'd love to see a video using Tarte products! I try to use natural makeup brands when I can, and I think Tarte does that really well.

I can't deny that the packaging is beautiful, but the size of those eye shadows?  that's ridiculous.  They could have been a bit bigger to at least fill the compact.  I'm going to pass.  Although that eye foil looks great.  It looks like you're doing the glossy eye trend without the gloss.
Love Victoria Beckham's clothes, I was looking forward to seeing reviews on the cosmetics. Glad I waited because I am surprisingly not going to buy some of the items I originally had on my list! Love the Modern Mercury (I have the original one STILL), love the setting powder, and love the mascara! Thanks for the great review. Can't wait for the next ones!
Really love this type of video-very informative and helpful. Thanks Nic, brilliant job 😊
Loved the reviewtorial thought the end result was very much a Brooke Shields look. They do look like very luxurious products and you can see the quality in your results. Thanks for sharing
Could you do some more affordable brands like collection or maybelline x
Is flower beauty widely available there? It would be nice to see a brand review of that brand. Thanks! Still loved the end look even if you just wanted to try the products. :) great as usual.
Is this only colour of foil in the collection? Gorgeous makeup as always xx
If you can do Dior that would be great!! Thank you! Love love love your videos.
What show was she on. I recognise her just not sure what she was from??? X
You did a great job nic!
Could you try the new too faced kandee collection? \nWould be good to see an actual make up artist use it rather than just youtubers who dont have the same level of knowledge or experience xxx
Gorgeous!  I'd like to see beauty pie or kat von.d x
Nic, I think it would be hilarious to see you and Sam do a full face using homemade products based on jail makeup.  I love the vids where you guys  work together on a silly task like the waterproof mascara challenge you did.  \n\nI'm also dying to see you and Sam do looks from American Horror Story, especially Lady Gage's looks in the Hotel season.\n\nJust some ideas! Love to you all!!
Love the make up tutorial. Can you please do a review on Fenty beauty? I would an honest review. Thaaaanks x
besides makeup, you girl have a lovely nail color, i love it, show it often
Can you do a fenty makeup review
Will the real techniques powder bleu brushes come to ulta?
That lip liner color looks fucking good on you.
Forever love your videos! Would LOVE to see you feature; NARS & Hourglass Xx
Please bring the new blue brushes and the multi tech ones in Douglas stores in Germany...excited looking forward to get them from Douglas.de online Shop 🌸💕😘
Dolce & Gabanna, please. Those are only available online and I'd like to see them tried out before I go and purchase them. Thank you!
You're so adorable!!! I love your makeup tutorials!!
Wow, wow wow. The make-up your face and technical skills show the VB collection off to perfection. Thank you ❤️
please do a few looks with Natasha denona Lila palette! if you and your sister each did a look together from one palette, it would be like two looks in one video! genius! esp since you're both so talented and not just for ND but any brand and palette, that would be a cool video to see from you two
I really enjoy your videos....Could you review makeup revolution... thanks
Shit shit shit I really am trying to curb my spending on makeup. This doesn't help.
I recently bought some makeup from W7, I'd love to see you do a review of them! It's insanely affordable. Their Glowcomotion highlighter/eyeshadow is gorgeous. I also got their matte eyeshadow palette and all the shades are very wearable.
I would like to see the normal Estée Lauder range, especially the Double Wear Foundations and their differences!
Lovely video. Super informative and honest opinions. Look forward to more of this style of video. X
There's not a product that you used that doesn't look wonderful & flattering on you! I was wondering though, what color/brand did you use on your hair? I really like it
As much as I like Estée Lauder products I just can't get on board with this it's like taking out a bank loan to buy a bronzer, products look gorgeous on you though nic!
When is the defining crease brush out? Only shade set in the brushes info ☹️
Baby hairs- put hairspray on a toothbrush and comb through! :)
Congratulations Victoria Beckham!
Looooove you and Sam 💙💚💛💜
62 pounds for translucent powder?! Which you are probably paying for the name instead of the quality, you would probably find the same if not better quality product at a drug store.
Your skin is to die for!
I can still hear this creeking/grinding noise in the videos! What is this???
Pat McGrath's new eyeshadow palettes, please!
YSL DIOR and GIVENCHY please!
Could you do Tarte please
Fenty Beauty 🙋🏻
So beautiful
Fenty Beauty pleaseeeeee
Review FentyBeauty, please! Hii from Brazil!
Great review, thank you 😊
Review Fenty Beauty Please
Please could you review Jane Iredale makeup🤞🏻
Could you please test Fenty Beauty !!!!!
Fenty plz
Bumble and Bumble Sumo Wax for whispy hair. XOXO!
Hate estee lauder. Bad eyeshadow. Hate the lip stick too.
Great video. Dior, please! :D
Laura Mercier, please!
Beautiful makeup
Fenty Beauty please?
...why do these celebrities think they are so above reasonable pricing?! absurd!!! please don't pay this for products when equally good or better products exist for less!! great review, nic and the look you created is stunning, as always....thanks for your down to earth honesty xoxo
Fonts makeup by Rihanna please !! I really trust what you would say about it :)
I feel bad thinking this but I really wonder how you would've felt about these products had you not known they were vb?\nI've watched this channel for years and I respect you both a ton and such is the reason why I don't want to doubt you.
Yes Fenty beauty please!! OMG VB products are expensive!! She may be pricing herself out of the market! Pass
Hi Nic....i Love ur Videos but these reviews would be even better when u could do a weartest and show how the Products lasted on  ur  face after  6-12 hours. Much love from Germany
Can u review fenty beaity
Hi Nic and Sam! Would you consider doing a Fenty review? I'd love to hear your take on it.
the hot glue is melting the polystyrene\n\n**proceeds to use hot glue to stick wool to the polystyrene**
I would've made the eyeballs white and just paint the iris green with black pupils but otherwise I love this clone
Ya know sometimes I really really really worry about him
What’d you do for the arms, hands, legs and feet?
i made a clone and sent it to work for me
I come here for my weekly doses of weird and I am very much satisfied 😂
I need a man like you
i am afraid for my life
It looks like a deformed Harry Styles from when One Directiom were still together
It's like watching Art Attack
the minute he said: sure I'm gonna be there in fifteen minutes. I could say by he's voice he's not going! 😂😂😂
hey PJ....my perfect clone has better grades that me....
The star fades in the beginning killed me, pure gold Pj xx
Pj is currently my favourite youtuber. He is so creative!
PJ: It's gonna get weird.\nTiny Planet Explorers: Yep. Wouldn't have it any other way!
The clone of pj has hair that  kinda looks like noodles!
I'll never get over PJ wearing glasses <33
It looks like girls at my school
I think we're watching a psychopath
Crafting in the club 😤
E X I S T E N C E I S M E A N I N G L E S S W E A R E A L L F A L L I N G D O W N A L O N G S P I R A L S T A I R C A S E O F D O O M
THERE. THAT INTERLUDE SONG. WHAT IS IT I NEED TO KNOW FOR SCIENCE.
What is the name of the track that plays in his video?
Kind of disturbed....but you know, he's a professional. So I'm sure it's cool beans.
EVERYONE IS FREAKING OUT ABOUT HOW WEIRD THIS IS BUT THEYRE FORGETTING.\nTHIS IS PJ\nWHAT THE FUCK ELSE DID YOU EXPECT
that's actually not too bad
He has he painting that Dan had in his room what
This is like game board from the IT crowd
Until he said the clone looked kind of like Harry Styles, I'd never realized that _he_ actually kind of looks like Harry Styles oml
Ummm Harry Styles??? Okaaaaay. Are you looking at the same Harry Styles I am? 😂😜
Your clone kinda resembles Wybie Lovat.
I honestly forget he's never worn glasses before?
It's really cool that he got Dan Howell to write his outro
he looks so good in these glasses i'm gay
I definitely want to make a making the perfect clone video now too
He mentioned Harry Styles, and suddenly he looked exactly like Harry Styles
I thought it looked like Harry styles too 😅
i know what you're thinking. the pj clone is missing some hair.\n\nyup, spot on.
An antisepticeye collab is what I need in my life
did the people who disliked this think pj was actually doing a tutorial on how to clone yourself or???
You are a strange one. Though I'm sure you already know.
Peej u have glasses now.... PUT THE GLASSES ON THE CLONE!
It's on trendiiiiiinnnnnngggg
What the actual fuck. - which is pretty much every intro to your videos. 😂
The hair is the best part
I knew this was going to be a masterpiece when i saw that first star transition
This had the same effect on Peej's fandom as The Memeing of Life did on Dan's and it's so hilarious to watch.
The hair lowkey looks like Harry Styles' hair😂😂
Somebody asked me who my favourite youtuber is and I said KickThePJ, I showed them this video and I think they think I'm a weirdo. So... thanks PJ
It.....uhm....HE seems the boy of Coraline, isn't it?
Sophie walks in,\nPJ what the- ***remembers its PJ***\nNever mind, PJ
I'm shook I'm watching this in bed and it's picture day
Please stop with the star Transition
What are the chances that PJ is a clone, too, and the real PJ made him so he can film a perfect clone video
Love this type of your videos
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what nightmares are made of.
0:23 have you lost your mind boooiii  😂
Those glasses I need some like them !!
Don't have the intenion of following the plans arranged in just 15 Minutes but instead using the time to create a clone. I like that idea
Can anyone tell me the name of the background music / song used at 0:41?? I've been trying to find it for ages.
Where's Wheezy Waiter and his cloning machine when you need him amiright
the hair is the best part
Why does he look like harry styles?
“looks a liitle bit like Harry Styles”
Can you make another Crafting with my son? You + Brad is incredible comedy
where have you been all this time
It's not the perfect clone because you forgot your glasses... But I guess it'll do haha
sometimes his videos get 10x times weirder or stranger... 😂♥️
Pj I have bad news....I think your clone is a bit....defective...
*Oh eyo! Wel-welcome tew Planuf Flesh. We got what you need here. We got planufs from out of this world and in this world. Come on by and grab urself your own diy clone kit diy kit. You have to MAKE the kit before you can TAKE the kit. Eyoooooo.* Planuf Flesh, no we're not a smex shup.
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS HILARIOUS
frick yes this is brilliant
I fucking love all of these star wipes😂😂
is this a jacksepticeye clone or smthin
Best quote of the video: Set your face aside to dry
Hello; and welcome to planet flesh....oh wait that sounds like a sex shop.. hahahaha love you peeeej
Later that day, Pj gets a copy right strike from Planet Skin.
It kinda looks like Wybie from Coraline :)
I can't tell the difference \n\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Are you like me and don't want to get out if the bed in the morning.....\n\n\n\n\n\nI have never related to anything so much in my life.

#PJ'SCLONETAKESOVERTHECHANNEL
Just WOW \nIt's amazing
This is by far the best thing I've watched my whole entire life!!! This needs to be BIG!
One word describes it: FANTASTIC
Robots or not, what you hear on this album is the future of music. Play on Mr. Stanford.
You are not from this planet ...... aren't u ?  \n\nDamn ..... i have watched and listen this video i dont know may be more then 100 times ...... its SICK !
those robots look so unreal I thought they were CGI. But the company is real
I am glad i found this, actually on facebook, then i found your channel on Youtube, you are a genius !\nI'm subscribing, thanks :)
More people need to see this.
Whould be cool in some movie
Sem duvidas uma das coisas mais incríveis que eu já vi e ouvi. Parabéns pelo trabalho!
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL!  Thank you soooo much for this!!!
You make the coolest music videos ever. You could almost single handedly resurrect MTV. lol
WOW! Thank you for the excellent work.
Hi, Nigel, Nice video. I watched the video on phone and without headphones and people in comments were going crazy about the track and I wanted to get that same excitement and emotions but when I listened to it on headphones, I didn't hear anything amazing at all. it is a very nice music video with coolest visuals but musically, it is flat and bland. The dynamic range is flat. The musical events, notes, beats, and everything else doesn't have multiple layers effect or that opening, middle and ending tinge on notes or sweet-sweet cues of audio sensation that elevates a musical piece to blissfull from bland. try listening to long after I am gone by chis jones. \nlet be clear, I am not talking about musical StYLE. but the audio quality of the recording. there is less hi-fidelity than currently possible.\ntry this similar video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv6op2HHIuM\nI am sure I am not saying it right but you would understand.\nmaybe, next time, when mastering, try to add pizzaz to the notes and events. I know your next project would be as awesome as this one or better.\ncheers
Nice job man)\nvery good
AWESOME!!!!
Awesome!!!
Awesome!!!!
Insane
Absolutely brilliant!
Coolest vid 2017
Amazing!
😎😱😱. Showwwwwws top
This...\nIs...\nAbsolutly amazing!
Excelente compositor. Conheci recentemente os trabalhos desse neozelandês. Me lembra um pouco o Sr. Froeze (Tangerine Dream). Parabéns pelo excelente trabalho em AUTOMATICA 4K. Fico ansioso para conhecer novos trabalhos.
I have never seen anything like this before, it´s so damned good!!! The Clip is absolutely awesome and the music spreads goosebumps all over my body!!! Well done, Mr. Stanford, well done!!! Greetz from Austria!
Which ones are real and whowhich are CGI? the laser is not real. None have such a variable focal length
3:07 .... True definition of a musical orgasm.
Got all my preorder treats and I have it on AUTOMATIC replay :) I wonder if I'll get sick of hearing it!
i like your sound and the videos are amazing <3
THIS IS JUST WOW!!!!
This is a masterpiece ! Great great work ! I have listened with the best audio and video support !
Stumbled on too this but what a find, this is really awesome!
Great!!!!  Really incredible!!!!  What a job!!!!!Congrats!!!  Now.....I 'm asking myself....Will IA systems do better songs than humans???? Time will tell...
The sound reminds me of some of the more synthy Nine inch Nails tracks. This is a good thing as far as I'm concerned !
New sub and new fan.  You are amazing, this video is amazing, your music is incredible!  Keep up the great work!
Nice Job Nigel , the perfect mix between Robotic advanced technology and music Good Video too.
I HOPE YOU MAKE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS.
After seeing it, and after hearing it, this goes straight on my programming/hardware design playlist. \nAh, to hell with it, I'm going to buy an album now.
Holy exclamations, Batman!   This is the bomb.
sooo facking bad ending, now i dont know what was CG and what was real.
where's the making of this video?!!
Amazing... Effects, Video and Music
This is very impressive. I saw this on Facebook.
Good music, good video. Like.
I didn't know Hitman made music!
Ive seen and heard some amazing things in my life but this just tops the LOT subscribed!!!! unbelievable. Recommended from JEAN MICHEL JARRE HIMSELF WOWWW
Album not what I was expecting but have to say enjoying it and feels very good over a multi tactile transducer config for those that also like to feel their music.
kudus ! great work .\nthis music video is not cheap to make if there's no willing sponser .
OSHA Safety violation... OSHA Safety violation... Trivially trainable robotics... /Another/ OSHA Safety violation... I think the military would be very interested in that laser... /More/ OSHA Safety violations...
Can't believe all the effort you have put in this, but it really turned out a masterpiece. \nYou set old genres back to life for me, really like it! 3 years... Unbelieveable.
Потрясающе! Классно! Талантливо! Молодец!
сколько времени ушло на подготовку и проведение съемок интересно

So i get that most if not all of this is probably CGI but I'm curious if it's actually possible to get the machines to play music that good in real life or if it's just beyond the tolerances of them.
Disslike because the full video is animated.....
If they broke up , its prob there busy schedules or the fact that Brett STILL hadnt proposed. No matter how much a woman says shes in no rush bla bla bla, no one wants to be the forever girlfriend.
Even it's last minute.. but the outfit is bomb!
Do not color your blue!! Maybe a medium brown. Or what's your natural color?
Thanks for staying your same sweet self.   Love your videos!
When I think of your videos I think about the Jordana lip liner. As well as big colorful earrings!! Long time fan right here ❤️
Super!! If you want to see my own channel😇❤️
do the blue!!!
they broke up
Where's Brett?? 😔
Giveaway winners?
PERFECT
can you do regular fashion hauls pleasssse <3
YYYEEEEESSSS PLEASE DIE YOUR HAIR BLUE !!!!!!!! IT WOULD BE AMAZINGLY  GORGEOUS !! love you ♡♡♡
Love all black everything!!😍
Why hasn't Kim asked to do a tutorial wth her, she's perfect 😍
I would love your opinion on Rihanna's fenty collection
You should do a house tour ! ❤️❤️
I dyed my hair red recently and my hair RAPIDLY starting falling out. I'm currently in the process of treatment for my hair growth using castor oil and I don't know if I ever want to dye my hair again. Your hair is already beautiful and long. Don't dye it. 😢
CAN WE GET AN UPDATED SKINCARE ROUTINE
I say go with the blue. Hair always grows so why NOT
Ugh, Carli you are sooo gorgeous!!! All your outfits, make up and hair are ALWAYS on point! We love you so much! Xoxo.
The end hurt me really badly cause I can see when someone is in pain. Especially from a libra. When you shock your head up And looked down. I was like 80 percent sure you cried after. Which is okay! When I'm sad and I'm a libra I buy a lot of clothes. Lol not saying that's why you're buying shoes. But love you Carli and I don't like seeing you sad. 😭❤️😘
Hey since u have an amazing skin❤️❤️❤️. can u do a vidio on pores and how to get rid them 🙏💕
I have one request for you and BH cosmetics. I love both of your palettes😍 they are bomb! But you're not selling your first palette anymore. Please release your eyeshadows as singles on bh cosmetics website 💗 love you girl
Oh my gosh. I get the feelimg this is about Brett. I hope its not. 😩

Hi carli you make a video routine about everything you do to maintain your hair, they are fabulous.
Looking amazing I love the all black everything !!
I love these types of videos. They're so laid back and I feel like im just hanging out with you. Lol I wish!
Gurrll I cannot get over how stunning you are!!! So beautiful inside and out! xx
Do whatever you want carli. You will look bomb with silver hair, purple hair, red hair or yellow hair ! Navy blue will look terrific.
Yes do your hair blue! It'd look so amazing! 😍
is it just me or does you seem sad?.. i get major sad vibes. and you keep talking about going to the fashion show alone and you didn't show him in your vlog. i hope everything okay car 💔 love you
How about blue black hair ? It will look beautiful on you ❤️
Love you Carli, you will get through this there's always light at the end of the tunnel ❤️
What was that kitty litter thing Bear was looking into?
Don't try it now. Because it sounds like you going through a lot of changes in your life and we women we tend to change our hair, either color it or cut it when we going through life changes, challenges, breakup etc... so don't change it now but if you still feel the same way after a while then go for it. God bless (trust the process).
This was great! Navy hair?? GO FOR IT! I think it'll look good on you. It's almost fall so why not?! If blondes can pull off pink you can def pull of navy! We live for these vlogs!!! Hope all is well w you and your fam! ♥️
Deff into the blue idea maybe likes blue black where th blue will only reflect in the light! You can pull anything off anyways 🤗😍
Sending you lots of love and hugs yours way, also blue hair would look stunning on you!
Never go wrong with Velcro chokers!!! Cant understand why companies use chains... I guess so you'll keep buying them when they break🤔
Do NOT dye your glorious,BEAUTIFUL  hair.
Does anyone know what style those celine sunnies are?
What are your favorite shopping sites for clothing and shoes? I really love your style and I've been wanting to do some online shopping. Please help!
For the hair I say YES!!! Do it, I love the way it looks when people have shiny black hair but when the light hits it you see the tint of navy blue OMGGG to die for I love that look and wish I could pull it off. You so definitely could !!
Yes to the blue hair!! I got dark navy blue on my ends and got so many compliments on it :)
Carli, honestly: you are GREAT and I follow you since a long time now, BUT I'm deep in love with your sister-friend (since I first saw her in one of your video when you transformed her! Can't you help me to come to know her? ;)
Unboxing must feel like Christmas morning every time
I love her love for animals. Shes so sweet and kind. 💜
Can you make this makeup look? Thank you
Yes to navy blue hair! It'd look so good on you!
Hi Carli, I think you would look gorgeous with dark blue hair. Dark purple would also look great.
Carli i just hoping everything is okay with you lets hope guys it has nothing to do with her relationship because carli doesnt go anywhere without bret and if you look in the past videos he hasnt been anywhere to be found carli just know we are here for you sis
I love your hair in the beginning of the vlog!
Omg how the deer kissed your hand was the most heartwarming thing ever😍 animals can sense good people you must be one of them!
You're so beautiful 😭
Will you do a fall shoe try on hall or a favorite shoe try on haul? I love your style and I love that you don't buy everything designer, but I need to see an item on to know if I NEED it!
Get a wig first in the hair color you want and then make your decision from there
DO THE NAVY BLUE HAIR!!
Carli: Deer Whisperer. Love you and hope you are doing well <3
Do a wonder woman costume video it suits you perfectly
Yes!!!!! Do it we all need change!!!! Blue!!!!!
Navy blue for sure!
I am dreading watching the next video something is up whatever it is Carli know that I love you and life moves forward no matter what.

I love you and I love watching your videos. I've been a loyal subscriber for years now. And one thing that I wish you did is involve us in some of your personal life you always say maybe one day I'll talk about it.

Think about it? I love and support you always. 💛
Why you heat your hair so frequently and it still so shiny and healthy? what did you do to your hair ?
Wedding makeup will be nice,  what u guys think about it?

Yasssss dye your hair blue !!!!
DO THE BLUEEEEEE
did she and brett broke up? she said in the beginning that she has some private troubles :( does anyone know? :(
Guys, the audio mix on this is atrocious. If you're going to do more multi-mic pieces like this then you need to get it properly edited and mixed, the audio is really bad for a channel of your stature.
christmas simulator
Tommy!!! looking good man!
Please Adam, do not paint your MF...
Adam is just sitting there playing around while the guys talk... Don't change Adam
as much as I love star wars, I gotta give kudos to that sweet Pong t-shirt!! Atari rules!!
What a bunch of nerds... <3
at the beginning there were 7 and 3 died in the process of building this falcon and only 4 remain to tell the tale
We have NO IDEA what's in this box... Norm, do you listen to yourself speak, or do you just continually talk with no regard for what's actually being said? I'm voting for the latter.
the set looks awesome but im a little dissappointed with the build. I know this is a model for show only but they could have made some more secure connections around the ship and i dont like how some of the top plate builds just sit and rest. I figured the build would have been solid so that you could pick it up with no pieces falling off and move it around if you needed to...........think i might pass on this and get the lego ghostbusters firehouse instead
No time to fix the mic clipping at all in post, huh?
I would keep all the box art and frame it, but that's just me...
Is Simone not part of the tested team?
ONly $800, for that much you could just buy a 3d printer and print it yourself.\n\nCorrection, at around 10kg you  could buy a 3d printer, print it yourself and still have a couple hundred left over.
Although I hate this particular portmanteau, the set is an instant toygasm!
I don't want one. I want to just build one
At 1:05 Adam mistook the set number for the piece count and at 8:51 he referred to lego bricks as legos. Not trying to be a douche just making an observation.
Please give one of these sets to a fan. I really enjoy legos but its really expensive, especially when living as a student. I havent bren able to build any new sets simply because I can't afford it.
The previous model was about £160. It's the best dolls house and I  only dropped it twice
So 12 hours for your team. So for me as a solo builder what should i expect? 12 hours times 8 ppl = 96 work hours?
Adam, you broke my heart when you said Legos :-(
now see I want this... but my wallet doesn't
Imagine if your friends drop it
They really didn't put seats in the cockpit?? The one single location in the ship that unquestionably has the most screentime... and they didn't bother to furnish it, or make it large enough to hold the seated figures properly? For $800. Maybe in another ten years they'll figure that part out; I'll just hold my breath until then.
just think of all the interesting conversations you had!
You can kinda tell that Norm is a straight up AFOL, the others are just cool, Lego! (Besides the Bricknerd guy)
What a piece of junk! - Luke Skywalker\n\nThat is the most beautiful LEGO set I've ever seen. What an awesome team build, how long would a solo build take...
How did you get this early
Nice .  but what piss me off a person like me could NEVER HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. Im a working man ...sometime it make sick only rich people can have stuff like that
Next to the Lego porsche 911, this is one of my favorite sets. It's so detailed
wanted the old one since a child...
How does lego design these as in how would the blocks go to build it
So how long does it take to build if your alone :OOOO
Is it in true scale to the LEGO figures? (haven't seen the video yet)
Oh, my goodness. It was a sudden release. How do they sell like this? When is the next official release date? I've known it is Oct. 1`.
12 hours for 6 people. I can only imagine how long it would take for 1. I feel like im watching a review of a sports car. Wish I had it but no way can I afford it
I was half anticipating them to throw it against the wall once they finished
if you cant play with it i aint gonna buy it, same rule for cosplay. Display pieces are nice but i am not wasting that amount of money for it to sit on a shelf
this box set is madness
At least the right size to the figures :)
Will swap kidney for this Lego set or sell my soul...
That's not proper Lego, just a slot together kit!
We have no idea what's inside this box\nYes you do, Norm, stop being so dramatic.
So cool to see that Adam and Grant are the only two who survived the Mythbusters breakup and now have a youtube channel together! Thumbs up!
I would set it on a shelf with the panels on half of the ship to appear to be peeling back by hanging them on fishing string
I WANT THAT THING SOOOOOO BADLY\n GOSH WHY IS IT 800DOLLARS ARGH
A lovely set guys, here in New Zealand we pay $1500NZD which bites.
They wasted half their time to knolling. Good to know.
I like the new one except its cockpit which looks odd and out of place
How many are going to be made
When I was a kid, I thought the Galaxy Explorer kit was huge. Sheesh.
One of my coworkers is planning to buy it. I guess he will have a lot of fun building this little wonder ^^
Like every other set,it's a box of plastic bricks.
Kishore we have the same name! And I am kisure about that haha
Missed opportunity for a epic quote at 10:53
11 hours so what 60+ man hours which brings it down to 10-15 bucks an hour-ish. Well that's a shit load of value right there for entertainment! Love it - better to beg for forgiveness, than ask for permission oh wifey! I have some neeewws...
i built this set in 7 hours
I can't stand what's he's name....
For Christmas what should I get this or the Death Star
As a guy who's not into Lego, but really into the falcon, I can say that the old one has a much better shape. The new one is way too flat and the cockpit and radar dish look too small.\n\n\nNow Adam, it is time to build and review the bandai perfect grade falcon!!!!
Wow, great video!  Any estimates on how long it would take one or two people to build this?
800 smackers. might take a month to build so it's great intertainment.  Sucks you can't pick it up
What the hell is an aluminium falcon?
Adam shouldn't throw the box and stickers around like they're worthless
Where would you even put something like that? its too big for a shelf
Death to Chihuahua’s!!!
These are over $1000 on Ebay Australia lol. At first I was like looks meh as I'm not a huge fan of Lego but this was pretty amazing. What really stands out to me is how stringent Lego's quality control must be to get every single piece into this set (maybe they ship spare pieces in it?). But damn that was crazy!
Why are you wearing a hat indoors?
Who here hates the fact that they took all the bags, took all the pieces out and then sorted it, not just going by the bags, and tore up the instructions
Please start putting where everyone in the video got their graphic T's from as they all have great taste.
Wow thank you
I'd just like to say I noticed and appreciated the camera motion during the time lapse
$800?No so dumb
nice
Nerds! lol
transmission lend alone oyyhhg wonder away lead straight firm nut.
Simone though
Lol box is fuked now
Cool
Tons of minifigs. Really?
intellectualizing legos ok why not
Not decals; stickers
NEED
https://youtu.be/vNv-B65PjPI
Awesome video. Thanks guys!
700 euro :')
i want it
https://youtu.be/kYjlqnmxUaY
WOW <3
neat : )
eight.... hundred.... ....dollars.
You guys deserve more subscribers
hey man dont die, be happy!
If this is a newer Falcon, shouldn't it have the rectangular radar dish that it featured in The Force Awakens?  (I realize that the photo on the box depicts it flying through the skies of Bespin, however that model doesn't differ much - if at all - from it's predecessor featured on the table next to the build.)
As steep as the $800 price tag is.... Ah ha ha ha ha, stop complaining about that. That works out to be about $1100NZD but our retail price is $1500NZD!!! So stop complaining about the price in the US. You guys got it so good!
$1300 In Australia - Just Crazy!
Most will buy and never open it, investment
Hey Tested and the Tested Team, Good day to you. BIG FAN! WOW! LEGO Ultimate Collectors Series Millennium Falcon (2017) Review! was SUPER AWESOME. Excellent Job and Fantastic Build! Congratulations complete Fast Build. You ALL ROCK! Thank you for sharing your time, talents, skill, fun ideas, and Wonderful creative videos. Take care, keep on doing what you love to do, and have a great day. Peace & Joy. Back to more videos :P Super Fun Stuff! 5,000 like yeah! lol
These are the types of guys i used to bully in highschool and they deserved it.
norm is a lego weapon

XIUGqfTkaWk,i sub! i love you veryyyyyyy honest review ❤️👍🏻"
Have i missed the video where she ranks them all?? Xx
What about the final thoughts?
Would you say that is better if the foundation matches your neck tone or your face?
I love your hair here, you should do a hair video
I actually found you on a Facebook post about the albino girl wearing the Fenty by Rihanna foundation. A girl recommended you for us extra fair ladies. I gotta say I'm loving all the in depth review on all the foundations and I love that you do drug store instead just using high end on everything.
Stop eating junk food lol
I think the smell is royal jelly (their royal jelly moisturizer smells the exact same) - it's the food bees give to the queen bee! The smell is sooo strong and makes me gag every time. Still use the foundation though because I love it :D
What is your go to primer and foundation?
If you ever do another 15 days of foundation, could you please test the new L'oreal infallible 24hr stay fresh foundation? Or maybe do it in a foundation Friday? I have a similar skin type and colour to you, so I trust your reviews. I fucked up and bought the Estee Lauder double wear despite you not liking it and I hated it too! I've been debating buying the L'oreal one but I've heard it oxidises, so I would love to see a review. Thanks. I love your videos and find them super helpful! :) xxx
I actually found your videos for an older series of 15 days Foundation and I just love how honest you are about all the products you try.
Newbie here. She has a video of her own red lipstick. The link doesn't work! Where can I get it.
Please try Limelight by Alcone foundation.....I see a lot of people selling it and I am so curious about it!
That swatch looks a bit yellow to be for cool toned skin
Can you do a review on this  Foundation Sonia Kashuk® Soft Focus Satin Matte Foundation
Hey!!! Love this video series!!!!
I totally love this channel.. but it seems we hear about you getting your nails, hair, eyelashes, massages, facials,  etc. A lot! Lol.
I remember when Taylor had 10000 subs
I am a new Subscriber. I appreciate your personality and honesty. So different from a lot of other youtubers.
Have you ever tried No 7 Beautifully Matte foundation? I think it's my all time current favourite for my oily skin!
Have you ever tried flower beauty's foundation? It's Drew Barrymore brand.
isnt cool pink undertones contradicting? lol
Hey I'm new to your channel but after watching a nude lip video and your 15 days series, I'm officially a subscriber!!! So excited to be part of the family and to half a fair-skinned buddy! ❤
So which one of the 15 was ur favorite foundation?! Lol
Your voice is so calm and monotone, in a good way, I love your vibe 💕
You should try Missha's Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++. You can find it at Target, Amazon, or other online stores that sell Kbeauty items.
What about full face in Mary Kay makeup.
The burts bees BB cream! Please!! I have a love hate relationship with it particularly because I'm still trying to figure out the best way to wear it.
Thank you for all your hard work!  Enjoy your trip!
I binged these videos in 2 days... glad I waited till after you were done
Omg so glad I found your channel!
I love Burts Bees lip balm in the winter months for chapped lips, and I've been using their cotton extract face wash for a few months and love it, so I had high hopes for this one. As soon as you said it had a bad smell, that was it for me. 👎🏼 Thanks for the review, Taylor! ❤️ #baerittofam #snapchatfam
I have a Burt's bees bb cream & its stinky at first from Noni fruit.
I saved this one to watch  til now because it was the last one lol so sad it's over 😣
Am I the only one who likes to wait till the end of the series and binge watch? I can't just watch one of her videos!
Just found this channel because of this series! Love your make up videos!
Heyyy
Heey
Do you think you could start including a drugstore foundation or two in the comparison swatches? Just for people who stick to drugstore makeup. Back when you included Maybelline Matte + Poreless in 110 it was useful. Revlon Colorstay in Buff would also be a good comparison that lots of people know. Thanks, loved this round of 15 shades of foundation!
I'm new! Saw you on trending! Will definitely watch the rest of this series
Can't wait for the wrap up video now that 15DOF is over. Not going to lie. I'll probably buy whatever your top 2 are 😂❤❤ #snapchatfam
I can totally hear the sponge pats on your face this time, it's highly amusing XD
Taylor, I've noticed that when you do your swatches you pause for a couple extra seconds at the end-- and I LOVE THAT!! Thank you for doing that!! It gives me that extra second to look and compare! 👍🏻 I love FDOF but holy shitzees, I can't wait for a shadow and shmooze!! 🌯💙 #baerittos #snapchatfam
You look ill with all the make-up
Please try marcelle makeup! There's not many reviews on it and I really love the brand for the most part!
Please do a review on... \nCLINIQUE Even Better™ Glow Light Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum SPF 15
Found you through the series and definitely gonna stick around ! :) :)
what are you 5 top/favorite foundations? Thank you
Where's the wrap up video? I need to know what I need to go buy!!
I watch so much Taylor that when I got a sample of the FAB intense hydration cream I was like oh perfect ill put it on the dry patch on my forehead a started to and then realized that I dont have a dry patch on my forehead?????? whoops
So depressed that you won't be making my day better everyday😭😭
This foundation has looked terrible  in many of the reviews I have watched. I will definitely be passing on this one.
So sad it's over!!!
I tried the burts bees bb cream and it was awful. It made my skin look terrible and it had a heavy floral scent, I think all burts bees products have some sort of scent to them which is kind of annoying.
Whoah, nice, this video is trending!  I'm so happy your channel is really taking off!  Yaaaay!  Also, thank you for another super awesome !5 days of foundation.  Looked forward to every single video and loved them all.  Thank you, thataylaa!
Have you tried the Dior Forever Perfect Makeup Fluid Floundation?
GIRL YOU MADE IT TO TRENDING!!!!! CONGRATULATIONSSSS! Btw love 15DOF!!!
I have never bought a Burts Bees product. Ty
The best one IMO opinion was the Two Faced comfort matte foundation it looked super smooth and nice, and I'm going to pick it up!!!
I don't want it to be over 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🌯🌯🌯🌯🌯
The Baerritos always seem to be awesome!  Love the positivity!! And welcome all the new Baerritos (Taylor looks like you picked up a lot of new fam along this series)
You should do a full face using makeup from Wish! Or do a review on Makeup brushes from Wish! (Only the products that are Wish Verified, though!)
I got deported from London :/
Thank you so much Taylor for your research! All your vids are short, simple and informative. Hope you are having an awesome time in London! Be safe!
You are always beautiful!!  This foundation looked like it yellowed there at the end, as well as was very thick. Took a while to oxidize! Thanks for the great information on all your videos!!  @~}~~~~
I really wish you would do an all time top favorite foundation video!  I have pretty much the same skin for and I want to find my holy grail foundations! Love this series it helps me a ton!
I don't think you have a video on 💄kokie skin perfect hd $12.98💄can you please try it 😘
Can you do a video of your all time favorite primers and the foundation that pair really well with them? I used urban decay primer with makeup forever foundation and it came out super patchy and it looked horrible :(
This time went by too quickly! For some reason I thought this was day 14 and was so confused when day 15 never came 😂
I found your channel through this series! hey!
I feel bad when you get a foundation you don’t like. I always feel crusty and weird when I try a foundation that doesn’t work for my skin lol. Love your reviews btw❣️
I think you can try the bareminerals remedy powder foundation or tom ford powder foundation
Love ur videos! \nWas wondering if u could do a video of ur fav top 5 or 10 foundations overall, of everyone u have tryed. Also I was wondering if u had any recommendations on a YouTube channel that is like urs only for more acne/dry skin?
ok
My I give a suggestion, next time you do 15 days of foundation, don't do such a long intro. I want to see you put the foundation on sooner!!! Love you!!!
I stumbled upon your channel last week and since then I've been binge watching 15 days of foundation. I've already watched through TWO seasons. LOL sooooo good. Also I've purchased THREE foundations already based on the videos. Which is NOT good for my wallet. but I'm super excited to get these foundations and try them!!
Thanks for the video!!! I love your reviews!!!
Super glad I found you! Your energy matches my own and tho I don't have ache I do have what is called milia so it makes my skin super textured and it's left me pretty self conscious but your videos kinda taught me that yeah, I can work with it tho it helps alot <3 love and good vibes to you!
I feel like I cannot buy a foundation without watching Taylor review it first. I haven't found many other youtubers with pale/problem skin just like me.
05:10
One of my biggest problems with oily skin is transfer... do you think you could show how each foundation transfers? Even if it's showing your phone after putting it up to your face lol thanks!
Hey Taylor! Long time baerrito here yet it's my first time actually commenting and requesting for a review haha 😂\n\nMay you please review the new It Cosmetics lineup of products in like a foundation friday or a first impressions video 😊\nEspecially the full coverage+skincare from the Bye Bye Redness and Bye Bye Breakout lines\nSeems like they'll be good for sensitive and pimple prone skin 👌🏻\n\nThank you so much and thank you for all the hard work you put in your videos! Really enjoyed this season of 15 days of foundation 💕\nSending love from the Philippines 😍🇵🇭
Thank you for all your hard work. Have a great trip!!
Loved the series. Keep up the good work
Omg i just saw this at the store and almost bought but it is expensive for a drug store foundation, $15.99 here at my local Walmart. So glad u are reviewing this!!!
Do you like any foundations?! Lol
You look like a female version of Ronnie from Falling in reverse
Please do a review of the glossier foundation!
I was on Sephora looking at UFO Sunday Riley Oil because I had gotten a sample and liked it.  The video suggested to mix a bit with your foundation for those with acne. Ever tried U.F.O products?
What foundations do you recommend for really dry skin? I have dry patches on my cheeks😞😞😞
Hey! 💕
@thataylaa do a review on matchco pls

I love this song✌💖
Is Miguel gettin a cut of the profit off this John?

Did anybody else think that the girl in the thumbnail looks like Lucy Hale?
This song is fire. MGK is hella underrated. He got a nice roster of hits

Now what's cooler than being cool? (ICE COLD!!) was my first thought for this video lol
not to be racist but did it seem his voice went black for a second like a whit boy whoa whoa then a black guys kinda voice
Mgk killed it with this song, wonder if he found his niche, I'm good if he did
love u mgk we are nepali fans
Has that Kid Cudi song erase me type of vibe
Erase me from kid cudi? Thats the vibe i get.
Am I the only one who likes it when MGK sings you're not mine anymore? \nLike he has this thing man!!! This thing
i just loved the chorus
i remember writing a song with the same exact melody in 4th grade, fkn great song tho! better than what i could have done hahaha
The chorus reminds me of....   Say it aint so by Weezer..
I don't know how this video turned out to be really funny😂😂😂😂😂
Was never really big fan of MGK but this song change my whole perspective. 🔥
Like Machine gun kelly
khufajado.. is there anyone manipuri?
hhhhhh fanyyy

Love Uhh MGK..ForEver..💕💕💕
my sister got me into your songs I love your songs peace😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😂👳👮👮👮👮👮👮👮
uggghh mgk is so hot with that yellow suit
MGK is really trying to expand his style, wasn't a fan to begin but I am digging his new direction.
omg i think its official i'm in love with machine gun kelly!!
Does anyone wish they were that microphone? Or is that just me?
Damn just killing it like chester
This is so good man! I don't care Machine Gun Kelly  buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*

There is more than 0.6 billion views between decpacito and the second most viewed video (see you again) , decpacito is officially the KING of youtube ...
some songs of Steve aoki with these rappers is so off point ,vocals don't fit the track at all,instead of hyping you makes u want to sleep
Every video is at this old fucking house
So 7 people produced this one song?\nJesus.

Beginning sounds good, the rest's kinda weak
That black gentleman must be doing well, cause everything he owns is white(smmfh)\n\n\n\nOh and the sax
Awesome song, got some good trap influences and love the sax. Ma$e on the verses was very cool too. Good job!
Wth is wrong with you.. Aoki???? I want the 2015 one.....
Fuckin' awesome
This will make a good remix.can't wait..
Lmao when the video started I thought she's a chick, but later it was Steve lol
Mase is back. Welcome back !! #$lowtrap
1:27 XDDD
Love that sax!
My new favorite song 👍👌🔥🔥
DOPE 👌👌👌
wtf?
Amazing song #Greece
Music Very Good!
🤙🤘🤘🤙🤙✌✌✌
Wow!!!
Mase is a clone.. he look the same as in 90s . Never age. .hm
Bad Royal = Bad Song
Who find this song by Jake's Paul video description!?!?
Mase aged well, dude still looks the same from the early 2000's
I like the asian dude he looks so cute
0:23 who is girl xd
His voice not for the beats.
IT'S MA$E BABY!
what is this shit?
WTF?? Que porra é que ta acontecendo com esses djs??? Saudades de quando faziam músicas fodas
Top
Terrrrible video.... Hurts to look at
Its like they tried to mix, funk, electronic, and trap. As we can see, it didn't turn out well. I wouldn't want to say stick with what you know, but being too dynamic is just too sudden of a change for your fan base.
Leave a like if the song is lit 🔥🔥🔥👍

So Saxy! 🎷
Mase fused a bday song with that proverbial techno music that lives on in the club or party for years! No ones perfect and I'm not God to judge it's just I wish he would show he's a believer and  not use Hoes Chronic Gin n Tonic Muder etc. in his song, I mean dawg u was a pastor of a congregation for crying out loud.
All yur album is fckin trash
Holy shit! Abel's intro in the first 10 sec sounds just like MJ!

Is it me or I legit thought a woman was singing. It goes hard but frfr the weekend confusing me
Reindeer nose contour
Another overpriced makeup launch. Makeup is marked up 500 times
Queen!!!
that bronzer shade is ridiculous literally WHAT
Tati which bronzer do you have from this line? Java Sun or Saffron Sun???
Which bronzer are you talking about? There are two- Safron Sun and Java. It would have been really helpful if you'd mentioned which shade and commented about the tone, etc?
It’d be interesting to see if you can find dupes for these products since they are very hyped and good products but way overpriced.
Catching up on all of your videos is inspiring me to go all out with my makeup tomorrow!
Love that video so much ~ thank you for your sharing ❤️✨
Tati totally reminds me of Victoria. I was just listening to and interview of Victoria talking about her job at the perfume counter and I felt like I had deja vu because Tati told almost the same story
As much as I love blue... 😨 nope
Seeing that bright blue eyeshadow reminds me of the blue and pure white shadows in my Mum's vintage YSL palette. Lovely colours, but impossible to work into a regular, everyday work look, and grossly over expensive
💜Your Look is Perfect 💜😽😺
tati, that eyelook!!!! 😍
thumbs up girl!
Love your eye makeup! Slayyyyy
Your eyes! 😍
@Tati pls pls:  Kate Von D SAINT + SINNER palettes review !
Nope... all kinds of nope!
definate tutorial on todays eye look please
Gorgeous compacts! But are they refillable?
Loving the eyelook!!!❤️❤️
your makeup looks so stunning 😍😍😍
Definitely getting the bronzer 😍
Tati!!! Your eye makeup is 🔥🔥🔥
Tati is queen
For this eyeshadows' price,go for Natasha Denona
🙄🤑🤑🤑 i'll pass
Crazy expensive
That white shirt suits u tati
so cute when you pouted about not meeting victoria beckham hahaha
Tati - Help! I love the idea of the eye foil but I'm having trouble with the application. Any tips?
*THAT GLOSS LOOKS JUST LIKE GLOSS BOMB FROM FENTY!AND THE FENTY ONE SMELLS LIKE VANILLA AND PEACHES RIHANNA SAYS!!!*
:: i especially love your eye look today 💪🏼💫::
Love your earrings! Can you tell us where you got them?
I just love how honest u are ur great
Packaging is so gorgeous...but too expensive for my budget.
Hi Tati! Love this eye look! Any dupes you could think of for the Eye Foil?? Or similar glitters? xx Thank you <3
but taro YOU'RE MY FASHION icon
Hi Tati - could you review loose powder foundations from the drug store? I want to try bare minerals but its hard on the budget :)
Tati!!! Please WTF Beauty Pie makeup and skincare! I totally value your opinions and would love to see if you think it's a good deal.
Your eye look is so pretty. I am going to get that eye foil. I hope VB meets YOU someday.😀
The packaging yes it's beautiful. But the price is.... bleh. Tati your eyes is so intense today, I love your blush or anything you put on your cheek. So beautiful.
Eye makeup looks amazing today!! Also, her skin legit looks airbrushed today??
I can't tell you how much I appreciate you channel, your honesty, your high-to-low thinking in products <3 so happy to have your advise in my life (and youtube feed)! Go Tati!
Girl, your eye game is SO strong lately!!!!!\nI'm a college student doing lots of lab work, so I rarely bother with makeup right now except for special occasions, but you're making me want to go full glam on the daily!!!! (If only I was good with eyeshadow.....)
You are the best reviewer on Youtube. Hands down. I don’t know what I would do without your videos!!!
You really didn't say that many negatives. It's not your fault it's SO DAMN EXPENSIVE. They had it coming haha
I love love love your makeup look, I honestly don't think anyone can fault you for your opinion even Victoria herself because they made that line with a certain price tag that's just not meant for everybody, if she wanted everyone to get their hands on her products she would've made a drugstore line, but she made a luxurious line with great quality and a hefty price.
The only item that I might splurge my hard-earned money on is the glitter you placed on your lids. Otherwise, I'm sure I could find a dupe for all the rest.
Tati, can you help me witj a products that wont wont cloge my pores  love you
No, no, and no! \nI WOULD NOT spend $45 for ONE eyeshadow, I would  NOT pay $60 for TWO eye shadows, and I sure as hell would NOT pay $95 for FOUR eye shadows!! 😮\nThere was nothing spectacular about those shadows to justify those prices! In fact, IMO there is NOTHING in this whole line that anyone could possibly justify spending this kind of money for! I think of that eyeshadow quad being $95, and all I can think is the number of beautiful, high quality palettes I could choose from at Sephora...AND I could buy TWO palettes and possibly STILL come in UNDER $95!!! 🤔\nAt these prices I wouldn't be interested even if Victoria AND David personally HAND DELIVERED them to my damn door!! Hahaha
The highlighter is just a re release of Modern Mercury. Thank you for the video!
Makeup is so stupid now. And pretentious. These companies can go F themselves
tati your makeup today is killing me its so beautiful omg!!!!!!!
Your skin looks perfect! What Is making your skin so dewy?
what make up did you use for the first part of your video? Your skin looks incredible.
OH NOOOOOOOO I just ordered the Smudgy Eyeliner, I wish I'd seen your review first. Was it possibly just dried out and flaky? The concept is good, maybe I'll like it 😉
There are two shades of the bronzer when I look online. Which shade are you talking about here Tati? We have similar coloring so I want to get what you have :)
Where is that giant crease brush from?
You've made me OBSESSED with the blue lower lash line! I do it ALL the time now <3
Seriously $60 for 2 eyeshadows? I think Natasha Denona's would seem like a drugstore brand in comparison!😆
Finally something different. Different product. I haven't seen anyone trying this out.
Your eye makeup is GORGEOUS!!!
Clickbait! Lol Tati
The makeup is stunning can you make a tutorial for this look ❤️😍
Omg Tati...you look so beautiful!!! Can we have more more more looks like this!?!? That smokey eye though!!!
Show us a natural look with the eye foil!! XOXOX
I went broke watching this video. LOL. love you Tati. great review as always. 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Omg yes crazy for 95 bucks but that blue looks amazing on your eyes!
Hey, could you check out Blackheart Beauty makeup and brushes? They're from Hot Topic, and I just got some of their brushes that are really soft.
I just couldn't stop looking at her eye makeup! So pretty!
I'm from Australia so I understand expensive makeup. A Natasha denona eye pallette can set you back over $300 but these price tags are next level!!! $60 for that shadow duo. What was she thinking! But Tati I still love these reviews! I always want to see how to expensive makeup works out. If you can afford it and you love it, you do you girl! \nWould love for you to reply. Love and positive energy from Australia!! ❤️
GIRL 30 bucks for 1 eyeshadow ?? and People are shitting themselves over an $8 natasha denona shadow lol
I'd pay $60-$95+ on shoes, handbags, clothes, jewelry &  occassionally a skin cream, but I wouldn't pay $60 on a 2 color pan or $95 on a 4 color pan shadow.  Yes, I might splurge one day and buy some expensive makeup, but it would be a rare occurrrence.
So gorgeoud Tati. I can watch your videos all day 😍
wow!!! That's all I got!
Anyone else just stare at her engagement ring every time she does a closeup??  <3 So gorgeous!
I do love that blue! I really wanted to recreate your eye look! Super cute and simple but it's gorgeous!!! Omg!!! You remind me so much of Victoria Beckham! You are defs posh spice! 💕💕💕
$60 for 2 shadows????? Insane to the max✖️
I wish the review of Fenty Beauty would have been like this.  😬\n(Sorry about my english)
Obsessed with your eye make up!!!
Here in Australia if you buy a chanel le 4 ombre eyeshadow pallette it is $100 or a Tom Ford eyeshadow quad is $135 so the eyeshadow quad is a comparable price to other luxury makeup brands however I think the illuminating primer cream thing is a bit too much! The packaging looks gorgeous! Thanks for another great review Tati 💕💕💕💕
How about a full face using only Clinique makeup and face lotions/toners/primers??!! Please!!!
You can slay any makeup thrown at you!! I'd never spend that much on two eye-shadows when I can get an entire pallet of high quality shadows that are full pallets for that. If I'm going to, well if I could, splurge, I'd just get the new Natasha Denona pallet that I want so badly.
When does this come out in U.S. stores??
$45 for a single eyeshadow are you freaking kidding me that's insane
4 eyeshadows for 95$ man that better change my eye color, see thru the dark, see when someone is a fakeas$ and see the future
it's funny how in the comments people be like 'it's too expensive!!!' but where i live makeup is quite expensive (that's why i don't wear makeup lol) these items will be much expensive in my country.
I feel like rare smells like vanilla flowers all the time
$60 for an eyeshadow duo. What the deuce??!
I am getting one of the eyshadow duos but im confused is the formula at least good?
the annabelle silver cream shadow looks exactly like that stuff
You look as luxurious as that packaging 😚
Wonderful review. Starting g following you today. Thanks!
$95 dollars for FOUR SHADOWS! I'D RATHER BUY A NATASHA DENONA PALETTE THEN
i just subscribed to your channel, your thumbnails dont do any justice to how beautiful you are! i always saw you on my recommendations, and never realized how sophisticated and gorgeous you are, until i pressed the play buttom😅😍! 🇭🇳
Wouldn't spend a dime on this line. I guess every Tom, Dick and Harry puts out a makeup line.
Will this be at sephora? or only department stores?
those prices are a complete and utter joke. you can get dupes that are just as good and are way more worth it
Im 9 so im going to be a marshmallow princess! And my BFF is going to be a marshmallow unicorn and my cousin is going to be a marshmallow dragon for halloween  p.s fun fact my cousin and her twin brothers b day is on HALLOWEEN!
Because I don't wanna float too, ( and I love this, and I love you!).
Jade from little mix is shook to the core
I just found your channel yesterday and I'm fking obsessedddddd!!!!!!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕 subscribed obviously! 🤷🏻‍♀️ don't ever stop uploading 😭
I would love to see you recreate Meg from Hercules, hair + makeup! 😩😍
'Alexa I wasn't talking to you' 😂
what kind of dog do you have
When Alexa said Sorry, I don't know that it made my Alexa go off as well lol.
but, why wouldn't you do it the same time as other youtubers? that means it's popular, you're a fantastic makeup artist, so that means more views.
Mykie please do a scary pennywise all the other tutorials are shit 😩😩😩
You are Pennywise's wife
OMG!!!! MYKIE I HAVE THE BEST IDEA FOR A VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!YOU COULD DO LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD BUT FOR THE GORE, YOU COULD DO SHE WAS CLAWED/ATTACKED BY THE WOLF!!! :-)
I remember nothing about the original miniseries from when I watched it as a kid, other than that I was terrified of my toilet and shower for at least a week afterward. Tonight I saw the new movie and I was blown away. It was AMAZING. if you're on the fence about seeing the movie, I definitely suggest going. I never get scared of horror movies anymore, but it got me a few times. It's truly enjoyable and I expect that most people who see it will also enjoy.
shiiiiaaat!!!
Disgusting
,,🤡😈🎈🎈🎈🤦‍♂️🙇‍♂️🤳💫🎒🤺
MY FUCKIN ALEXA WENT OFF
Too Girly
Ohhh
Where did u but the dentures from?
Can you do a couples Halloween costume look? Or like a few 😩impossible to find more than one look on YouTube
watching this and the new IT are inspiring me to paint Pennywise and scare the crap outta my sister :'D
I just wanna know where did she get those teeth from
Anyone else see a serious resemblance between Mykie, and Hayden Panettiere?\n\nNo? Just me. Well, you're still a beauty, obviously.
WOW, really impressed, I LOVE IT! the red wig and those scary af teeth ((;
Where is the blonde wig from?
Please do a Glam and Gore zombie Wonder Woman!
UR SO PRETTY AS A GINGER😍😍

Hello random person scrolling through the comments, u are beautiful no matter what, and have an amazing day!! 😊
I dont want to float too so yeah here's my comment
FOR FUCKS SAKE I GOT SO FUCKING SCARED IT THE BEGGINING
Where did you get the teeth?
idk if its just me but from 5:00 - 5:05 she kinda reminded me of the ginger girl in riverdale
It was filmed in my home town and u can see my house in it
You should totally do Blind Mag from Repo the Genetic Opera
Only the red lines.. hmmm..great idea!!
Ur dog looks like the squirrel guy from ice age tbh... 😂 not bein rude just saying 💛
Where did you get those teeth from???? I watched this video and the mermaid video and you never said where they were from. Plzzzz I want those teeth for Halloween 🤡
I've watched this video four times
Glam or not I'm still mentally disturbed😂😂😂😂
FUCK the beginning scared the shit out of me I have headphones in
this is actually pretty cute :b
You should become a potato for us-♥️♥️
2:29 when I try to do eyeliner😂
Out of literally every Pennywise tutorial..yours is definitely the best
Where did you get the teeth?
Penny wise turns to ur worst fear \nMine: heights \nMike GREEN GLITTER EVERYWHERE
Tiny little huggers .... GREAT now, I will feel a pang of guilt every time I pick off a glitter. D:
Omg so creepy beautiful! All I could think of is someone walking up to you and hitting on you cuz you're a pretty little clown...and then you smile and they're all like ooh shiiit lol
Does anyone know where she got the wig from? It looks amazing
With the blue hair, it reminded me of American horror story cult
As someone who is absolutely terrified yet completely obsessed with clowns, this is amazing.
If you continue the princess gore. You should do Mulan or Merida because that would sooooo rad.
can you please do taylor swift zombie version of look what make me do music video pleaseee
She needs to do Heathers beat up Veronica Sawyer look. Just me?
I died when she casually ripped her wig off😂

Brandon's voice is so bomb ... damn😱
Y'all deserve so much more subscribers than this
New kids on the block 21st century
Much better than 1D i think
They did a cool cover of one of aaliyah's songs and it was good, glad they're bringing back dancing to these boy bands.  One Direction got away with it since most of them could actually sing very good.
Lol so I found this video in twitter about  Edwin hipping up Jay Park and he looked so genuine and so now I'm stanning them looool thank god I discovered them cos they are AMAZING, FCKING TALENTED, FCKING VOCALS AND Oh lord visuals
Please don't go generic stay just like this
Yassss
why do people say this vid gives them kpop vibes, when this is the style of 90's pop, from usa?
We need more people watching this!
How could so many human beings be so beautiful?
They're so 90s. I love it
God I'm gonna be a BEANZ for a long time

It's just  looks like a boy band but one direction looks like just not a boyband every single one of them is angel !
I saw Edwin hyping up Jay Park on his ig live and he sang a little bit of Aquaman AND I FREAKING LOVED HIS VOICE, so of course I had to check this group. \n*No regrets, I love this*
You guys are amazing, and really talented, TOPPP!!
if the next couple of songs they drop are anything like this one, then i can't wait
this sounds so 90's
Why don't we is stronger!
Finally! An american boyband that can actually sing and dance! They'll get famous in no time!

3:26 who is singing there..I need to know it..and I must admit that I hated them but now I love them..

I know this is early, but are you bringing Nicki Star Tip back for this Halloween?! I LOVED HER 😍
Hellooo this cake is AMAZING you are so much talented, hello from Belgium!😊☺❤😃😀😘
Try the Japanese cheesecake
WATAMELON
Would be extremely cool if nick opens a cupcake cafe/Pop up store x everyone would live for those gorgeous cupcakes & cakes !! 💖
Nic's FREAKSHAKE brings all the views to the yard.... He could teach you, but he'll have to charge.... $30 😂😂😂😂😂😂
NICK!! i have a burning question: are you never triggered/annoyed by the crumbs or the sauces (anything liquid really) drip through the crevasses on your table (or work bench or whatever you call it)? like how do you clean it... (im huge fan of your creations btw!!)
Still waiting on PEACH, dude!
This is #watermelongoals 🍉🍉🍉🍉
Always love the freakshake cupcakes :D\nIf you're ever interested in making freakshake freakshakes that'd probably a be a big hit too! I know /I/ would love to see them
This guy needs to be on cupcake wars!!!
Anyone else miss it when Nick points with his fingers the ingredients needed for the recipe? I do.
Too cooked for this
His creations are so unique, cute, and impressive, and I love how his personality shines through in his work. If he doesn't already it'd be too cool if he opened up his own little bakery.
here since 20k...but i always forgot to subscribe rip
you are making good
Who actually watches this and makes it im just here to crave sugar.
This is the perfect Halloween treat to hand out on the South Side of Chicago next month. Just don't put them in a big bowl, leave them on the porch, and tape a please take only one sign. You might cause a gang war over who gets the most watermelon cupcakes
Any suggestions for substitutes for all of the milk products?
Why does the butter look like cheese
There's a cupcake in my home made of watermelone
That's a neat mixer
Everything you put out is so amazing and looks gorgeous.
Can you made smores macarons and plis continue making freakshakes cupcakes i love them, love your decorations, especially the ones with the donat lol
Looks good I'm new to your channel
Ur vid just got likeeeeeedddd😅
Loved it !
I just love you. You are beautiful and amazing
ur editing is awesome (small youtuber admirer here) I spend more time on my thumbnails then I do on my videos. Maybe I need to reverse that
Do u need the Greek yogurt?
Where do you buy your cupcake liners and what's the brand ?🎂
So creative! These are so cute!
Done!! and loved the video
Man I thought it was called Watermelon freshcake my god I can't read
hahaha, its so i love how  u pour the batter with the ice cream scoop its soooooooooo satisfying XD
Omg nick this is so beautiful keep it up
I love this even though I say im gonna make this I never do who else can relate
Nice cupcake!! Now, can you cake it? I mean turn it into one of your high-level cakes, not making a giant version of it.
I love your accent. It makes my day and your videos so much better 😬😁
Yes so ready for fall, summer is out the door as soon as Sept 1st hits to me lol I will not miss you Summer goodbye.
Summer almost over in the US means for you summer is almost starting! Love the vid as usual 😻
Yes! I guess the right name!
Hey nick.......What does the oil do in cupcake or cake?????
Halo top
Loved this video
What A Cupcake!
Yay Watermelon!!!
omg yaaaaaaaaasssss!!! <333
It's trending!
Your creativity is endless!!
WATERMELON ISL LIFE
Omfg, don't worry sweetie. Rosanna Pansinos children fans always do this, they accuse people of copying her when they didn't at all or because it was never her original work to begin with! They legit do this ALL THE TIME. They did this to Ann Reardon with the unicorn cake that was never Rosannas original creation to begin with. Who knew watermelon flavor cake in the summer is copying someone lol. P.S, your cupcake is way cooler and more creative!
I love the way you say choc chip! \nCan you make a Chai latte freak shake with TimTams on top? I did the TimTam slam with chai tea and it was AMAZING!
Hi , your videos are really good . Maybe next time you could try rainbow marshmallows meringues cupcake ?
You are trending right now 9:12 pm est USA
Omg, you should make cake like this!
Omg i just found out you have a youtube  channel!!! I follow you on instagram and i love your videos!⭐👌

do a collab with Rosanna!
Do you spray paint your table a different colour every video or what!
After all this look-all-the-same-doll-cakes, I'd love to see your version of a doll-cake... I imagine an explosion of crazy colours and glitter, sparkles, sprinkles and gold and maybe some beyonce-ness... 😍😊😍
why is your salt pink?
Why do you call them freakshakes
Looks amazing but I wouldn't know where to start eating it?! xD
This cupcake is identical to the chocolate and mint freak shake cupcake, just a different flavor. Not complaining though. O love watermelon.
8.4k and trending.  🤔
WHY IS THIS SHIT IN MY RECOMMENDED LIST DODDAMNIT YOUTUBE
No Walter Melons were harmed during the making of these cupcakes
Please collab with rosanna pansino please
17k views and trending? Gotcha
Summer is not almost over. I live in micigan and monday will be the begining of the 3ed week of school
Im early
Where can i leave the suggestion on a cupcake
I thought it was Billy on the Street
Yo shouts out to whoever edits this show together, they don't get the credit they deserve
But Pauly D is Pauly D D;
Best one I've seen yet!
9:51 what's the artist name? I don't really get it..
Anyone else see Rick from Rick and morty in the instagram deep dive
Crazy how Dillon can almost no sell the whole board, and poor Joji in the next episode is dying.
The old hot sauces were a lot better than these...the guest seem to be able to handle these easily.
Get Jon Bois on here
Dilon seems super down-to-earth. I love it
These sound effects are kinda annoying.
crossfit is so fucking trash.
You need Joe Rogan on here after he's smoked a lot of weed. The bonus is he'd have the munchies so he'd love to have some chicken wings!
I want so badly for them to have Joel/DeadMau5 on the show.
Get Obama on here fr
Get Tyler the Creator on here
it'd be great if u had better guest tbh
Dillon francais doesn't seem like a real person to me because I found out about him because my friends dad is in one of the songs and it's such a crease
I miss the old Sean Evans
i got two of those secret aardvark in my fridge its soooo goood
I was trying to watch this eating a Carolina reaper
The song he mentioned and the video sucks so hard.
keep getting big EDM acts.. see if you can get Tiesto, or Armin Van Buuren
Dillan gained a fan tonight. Not because of the wings. But because I just don't follow his genre. I have since, and am, as I said a fan. Good on both you and Sean.
Damn, I didn't know Paris Hilton was a DJ now(or maybe she has been for a while?).  Good to see her doing something other than selfies for once.  \n\nThe things you learn on Hot Ones.
Can you guys have haha Davis?
If you can get Bo Burnham that would be the most real interview of all time.
Fantastic episode. Dillon Francis' charisma is insane and Sean was on fire
Sorry jauz but your a little bitch sometimes 😂😂 @jauz
Chappers and The Captain from #AndertonsMusicCo want to come on the show. Please get them on! :D\n#RobChapman
Or Kevin heart , or Chris Tucker
Watching a guy rise to greatness is an amazing journey. Good Fucking Job Sean!
Dillon Francis seems like the best kind of person to interview :)
Who else eats wings or wants wings when they watch hot ones?
Does anyone else watch this whenever they buy wings?
This is a really great fucking show man. Keep it up.
Last Dab has a 2.4 million scoville level
He actually took this really well
his oh face, at a17:05 lol
Rob Chapman and Lee Anderton wants to be on the show :)
Can we get ces cru on here. They probably wont do it, but it would be dope.
Nice guy and good job!
people who do cross fit never shut the fuck up about cross fit.. fuck I love you
Gotta get charlie sheen on this !! Love your show though Sean !
ive actually been drinking milk and chicken since a baby
Get a WWE star
Have Jonathan Davis from Korn on the show
They need Joe Rogan and Hannibal Burris on at some point.
Anyone know how they prepare the wings? Fried, baked, grilled?
https://youtu.be/yB8Ci7X5HUU this is the vid he references
He eats wings like the Old Dillon Francis...
You should get Steve Aoki on the show!!
It should really go without saying (If it hasn't already been said heaps before) that you need to find a way to get Neil Patrick Harris on this show
Rob Chapman and Lee Anderton said they would love to be on your show!
I fucking love the SFX guy working on these videos
Ok we get it, just date already
Do one with someone in faze clan
do u go for the- *wing already in mouth* nevermind..
Chappers and The Captain from andertons TV are really wanting to eat some stupidly hot wings, they're brilliant lads and absolutely hilarious too, give 'em a shout guys!
Dillion is so cool. This episode has to be my favorite!! You guys vibe'd so good
Skrillex needs a turn at the board now.
For 20 minute long videos and to not skip parts is awesome. I love this show and i wouldnt and couldnt imagine a better host the Mr Sean right here!
Dude c'mon. I put Da Bomb on my eggs.
Remember when people wouldn't be able to finish the wings and almost die ... Pepperidge Farm remembers...
Get ReviewBrah on the show! Please! Upvote for visibility!
Taste like a piece o shit... piece of shit... ece of shit... shit.. hit... it..... LOL
can you please get reviewbrah on here next season?
Please have Chapers and The Captain on the show \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi4GMme6LWk got at 15:38 to see what i'm talking about :) i'd love to see em on the show
Not big in the EDM scene but this guy would be my pick for son-in-law.
Get Chappers and The Captain. They are begging in a video to do your show! Aderton's Music. That would be an amazing show!
sean i ve benn requesting u from long time please we want david guetta on the show please
RTJ
Omg milk and chicken.... IS FANTASTIC 😂😂
Gordon Ramsey
Get Wiz Khalifa! That would be hilarious! 😂
The ATL Twins would be dope af.
Dude says pop assholes, at least signing takes talent 😂😂😂 fucking programmed edm bs lol

This made me tear up. Rest in peace, man.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. You will be missed.
Rest in Peace, Harry!

RIP Harry, you lived a good long life and were a damn fine actor.
So beautiful. Rest In Peace, Mr. Stanton.

Rest in peace legend
Legendary character actor Harry Dean Stanton died on Friday 15.9.2017.
is it just me or is the sound a little weird?  low volume and 'wavey'.
I am not the only one who thought this one of the best moments in the series. RIP.
Rest in Peace Harry, You never delivered a single bad performance. I hope they have a cigarette waiting for you in heaven.
RIP the great Harry Dean!
RIP Carl . Glad we got to see you again in Twin Peaks The Return.
Rest In Peace, Harry Dean Stanton xx
RIP- This is a tough jam, knowing it as his last.
Rest In Peace, brother.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.  May Carl Rodd finally find some peace.
R.I.P I will keep my blood
I had a dream about him last night. So sad. I thought he would live forever!
R.I.P Harry Dean Stanton Kudos to David Lynch for letting him appear in Twin Peaks - The Return and for making him play his guitar and sing. :'(
The light went out at the Fat Trout Trailer Park. RIP Harry Dean Stanton (aka Carl Rodd). You'll be surely missed by all TP fans.

Hi dina can you please do a review on the stabilo boss pastel highlighters and the normal ones   please  I'm litteraly in love with stationary and plus you can use the highlighters in ur office
Who else came here from her reading terrorist comments video😂
fuck youuuu
love you Dina, you are such an explosion of energie
Be careful with the rope/pull cord on the blind cuz some kids can accidentally get it around their neck and strangle. Please make sure there isn't a loop at the bottom of the blinds. Take care
I'm so excited to see the transformation😂😂
Thanks for time , I won't watch in the future good night 😉
The room looks gorgeous with natural light..good for filming.
wow Dina, you so gorgeous without make up!
A friend of mine really needs help and advice,can you guys give me the email that people send messages  to Sid and Dina about their problems????  Please help me to rescue her life!
Hey guys! Would be great if you could show some love! Just joined youtube! Would love for you to subscribe! \nhttps://youtu.be/IyBnOTvaXfg
am i the only one or did she do something to her teeth ???
i thought dina had like 1mil subs, huh she only has 600k, thats a suprise to me
lol everyone calling Dina oppressed for wearing a hijab. How many oppressed women tell their husbands to fuck off constantly and put them to work?😂😂😂 How many oppressed women have more subscribers than her husband? How many oppressed women are allowed online? It's called showing respect for God. No one says anything about nuns but because she's Muslim it's a huge fucking deal. Get your head out of your ass and just enjoy the fucking video or don't watch. It's simple
is this a rental house or did u buy this house?
I love ❤️love ❤️ love ❤️ ya'll God Bless your cute family! Mashallah
I want u to do the German makeup 💄 video plz plz Dina do it
Yes please do a home accessory video, I want to know where your glass table and the  blue chair is from
yes we want to c that video with make up from Germany
How old does Hana has to be for u to allow her to wear makeup and make social media accounts.
Sid: Hahaha! Crack in the bottom....I laughed so hard at that...🤣🤣
Sids hair looks great. I just subscribed to you, your channel together and probably Sids channel too cos you guys are bloody hilarious 😂😂
Nice to see dina addressing the racists remarks
I wondered how long it was going to take for Dina to notice Sid's umm behind lol right next to her.  I'd love to see you try the German Makeup and film it of course!
Hi dina can I just ask where you bought them pocket shelfs from for your creative area.
I am in love with your scarf here you look beautiful with that colour on !!
Sid has really turned into Pakistani Eminem
So much staff please read about minimalism 😂😂😂
yess pls do a room tour after ur done!
Y is Sid so funny in this 😂😂😂
Love the magazine holder! I would use that as a bag too
I don't know why but I love the tone of your voice! 😊
i smoked weed and to me it really looks like sid is really high aswell
I don't know why people still watching u 😏
EVERYONE GO TO TOOSY CHANNEL. SHES SMARTER TAN DINA AND MORE CREATIVE AND NOT DOING DUMB SHIT VLOGS ON HER HOME OR MAKEUP. TOOSY IS A REAL TALENT
what is up with their hair colour?
What is the music
salams dina i hope you see this. i totally love you and i love your content. i hate to bring this up here but as a furious muslim from australia i was wondering if you could do a chit chat video giving your thoughts on the terror attack that happened on a train in london yesterday. xx
Really wanna see the German makeup video!
I wanna see the German makeup video!!!!!
Hijab wrong hair must all be covered
Yesss i wanna see your makeup video 🙋🏽🙋🏽
But let talk about how hot sid is lmao. Ok back to our regularly scheduled program lmao.
Who dyed  Sid's hair? \nLet me guess the Barber 😅😅
I had to get something pretty minging not you sid that bit killed me😂
Where is she from
When sid was jumping on the inflatable bed it reminded me of myself. I did that in one of my friends house and my jeans had a pen in and then pen made a hole in the inflatable mattressmattress
Why did you move again?\nLove you btw ❤️
when did you do your teeth?? Looking nice!
the only picture we've seen of hannahs head XD
You are SO funny
Please do a video on your german makeup
There is no god
The music just simply explains this video.shit.
you dont need to wear burqa 24x7, hadiths dont say that, just dress modestly.
You guys should get mr.kate
Dina your teeth look amazing!
Nice ass Sid 😂
1:47 lol
Well done Dina .. click bate ..well done
Trending ❗️❗️❗️
Love that room
MY CATS CALLED HANNA TOO😱😱😱
Sids teeth are so yellow
Ooh 31 on trending. Yay
Sid, you're not Zayn Malik
Trending!!
CLICKBAIT but Dina honestly i love your vids
Dina why do u always scream 😫😂
Haha, blondie's a goofball! 😄
Seem pregnant to me 👀👀
THE MEOW EDIT😹😹🙌🏽 *intentionally puts cat emojis
all your videos are haram. you not real muslms
I don't like the veneers, Dina. They look too artificial. By the way, I'm a dentist
Oh Lordy. Dina is so loud, she is annoying. You need to dial it down babushka.
what she thinks of herself? what is she? her husband ewww.
Religion is a waste of time bruh.
wait your white but in muslim  gear ? why ????
You're a shitty person
Do people actually enjoy this?
This man is not punishing his woman for being confident? What blasphemy is this?
Nice to see a suppressed woman on trending
She'd look better without the t-shirt on her head
Are you white? genuinely can't tell and am just curious
GROSS
Click bait
Wonder why this is trending... hmmm
What a load of shit
Raghead
That title plus the thumbnail made me think your about to suicide bomb someone
Sid's got a big ass, which girl would stay with someone like that, if there was no money involved I bet these 2 wont be together fact!
u gonny build a bomb up there
Can you vlog your next terrorist attack? Fucking Muslim
Take that fucking thing off your head and escape before your man shanks you
Your bomb didnt work properly, stop trying to kill my people please.
Your allah doesn't and has never existed, and your precious prophet muhammad (*piss be upon him*), held up by islam as a shining example of a perfect human being that all should aspire to emulate, was in reality an *illiterate, warmongering pedophile* that has left the world with a legacy of *systematic genocide, generational incest and atrocious intolerance towards other cultures,* now fallaciously described by so many today as a religion of peace.
Oh god a muslim no thank s
My friend ruby wants a the best gymnasts are born in _________ tshirt and its her birthday soon I was just wondering the prices

When u think yourself as a gymnast then u see Nile 😂  \nNile is my fav youtuber

Nice fun and games but when it's on its on, keep rocking you guys great channel !
There's a pic of u in my gymnastics hall
You guys are so lucky, I have always loved gymnastics but for the past couple of years I haven't been able to do any because the nearest gym with a men's team is several hours away, and the closest gym is an all girls one that I could walk to if I wanted. The pain is real
U even a champion?
Any small youtubers wanna support each other
I do gymnastics and you and the British team are such an inspiration to me
i train at this training centre it's so cool knowing that you go there too!!💗🤸🏼‍♀️🤸🏼‍♀️
I'm in love with the new editing
Anyone else just on here to look at fit men in shorts 😂
You're nipples are so small it's cute.

Merci , de me faire rire, pleurer , sourir , et me donner envie de me dépasser dans mon sport à chaque fois que je regarde une de tes vidéos !!! 😉👍🎥\nContinue comme ca , tu est quelqun de bien en plus d'être un grand champion ! 😘🏆
I really want to do gymnastics but I have never done it before. I'm nearly 18 and feel like I won't be good enough to start gymnastics now. I'm not in the best of shape either. I know they do adult gymnastics by me at lillenshall but I feel like I won't be good enough or fit enough. Do yo have any advice or should I think Of something else to do.
Hey Nile! So lately in your video's i saw an amazing move wich I just HAVE to know the name of. Im really in handstands and that stuff so i would really like to know. It was a move where you were laying flat on your belly with your arms by your side, where you then quickly starded lifting your feet up higher and higher untill you got into a handstand. Then whilest in the handstand you slowly came down in a pushup manner to rest again, laying flat on your belly.\nThank you very much and i loveeee your videos. Keep it up!
I don't know why, but I'm like a solid 89% that Nile is gay, or at least bi.
what camera do you use?
Nile , is there any way you could make a video giving advice to gymnasts like me who are finding it hard to resist quitting gymnastics and can't find much of a reason to stay in the sport :// I love the sport and couldn't imagine my life without it but I don't know wether to quit
Nile what do you think about gymnast lefteris petrounias
hey nile do you think it's too late to start gymnastics at the age of nearly 15??\n\nEDIT: DAYUM 28 ON TRENDING LETS GO
Hi, I'm male and i was wondering if 19 is a good age to start gymnastics, i dont look for a competitive level, thanks everyone who answer my question.
Are you aiming for the Olympics again Nile?
Are you going to do a section for ankle mobility on bodybible.life?
Hi Nile, I did gymnastics when I was younger but i was never flexible enough to advance to a higher level. It got to the point where my coach told my parents that they would have better luck spending their money elsewhere. I really loved it especially bars, because I am naturally strong and they were fun for me. I am now 17 and haven't done gymnastics for six years. Do you think it is possible for me to get back into it? Or do you think it's too late?
Hey nile , i've been watching your videos since couple months and i was wondering if i could have a good level in gymnastic considering i am starting at 17 years old.\nAnyway keep up the good work bro
Random question: what hogwarts house would you think you'd be in?
Hey do you twist both ways in training or competitions? Im really only able to twist one way, kind of frustrating id like to see your take on it
Is he Scottish?
sorry thumbs down cuz clickbait\nand not going through with it
R u going to the next commonwealth games If so I might see u there cause I'm going there great vid!!!
Have you taken ballet?  You might investigate it, if not.  Bram Verhofstad moves like one, seems to actually slow time when he moves, it's thrilling to watch.  Somewhat like football player Lynn Swann, who was also a ballet student.  Your talent is so amazing, but it doesn't draw the eye in the same way.  Your movement could be not just thrilling, but breath-catchingly beautiful.
Have you ever tried the carmona on rings?

Do you find it hard to text on the note 8??
Who are these 6030+ subscribers in this 4 mean time.\nAre they manipulated fake subscribers..??
Hi... As a long time viewer... I have noticed that there is a lot of flagship priced phones...band they are covered well...   Now that phones are 700 dollars each there is a market that both iPhone and Android types of phone do offer cheaper versions.\n\nWhat are your top pics at various price points.\n\nAlso. Bigger is not always better. Modern phone hardly fit in my pocket now. \n\nI'd like to see a real comparison for the majority of users price point.   And that is base to middle price point.
Congrats!youll be at 10M in no time
ha haha...we like you even in germany
Do you think the next iPhone will be cheaper and look like the new iphone x?

You can take a 20min break while doing this and still beat the others by 20minutes. So for you it is a Pausable-Challange
And it takes me 4hrs to eat one grain of rice.
You said f word 3:41
HOW IS HE STILL ALIVE!!!!??????
Me when I come home from school
Bruh i got 6 big mac
Krass
R u really that hungry???
Whats even the point of food competitions and competitive eating? The point of eating is to  fuel your body of what it needs...And to enjoy food. This is just pointless. Not even impressive.
Thats Craaaazyy haha you nailed it every singel time 😂😂😂
Wooow 🤤🤤
Then shakes were defrosted. And thin. That's a no win
I could not do this. Fast food makes me sick. No matter what. Mcdonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, and Arbys always get me. How this guy could manage this is amazing.
THIS is how you eat a big Mac
When someone says i love food but doesnt even eat the whole thing
Eat 10 wing stop wings. And 2 rodeo burgers from burger king
Matt Stonie do 5 big breakfasts and see what time you get
How are you not dead yet
Go to 1:45 he puts five
Nothing like chewing your food slowly and enjoying your meal.
That is how I am when I eat
cant believe this guy is still alive
This guy eat like hell😂😂😂
Mate ur going to screw ur body up so much and regret it.
I'd finish that in an hour
You should do a subway challenge get every sub on menu but make them 6 inches that's probably like 30 feet of sub
Diabetes will get to him some day...
When the munchies kick in after those rips
This guy is lucky he's so thin!
Can you do a spicy food challenge? Like, wings or sumn
I dare you to do that live
After this you don't eat fot one month😂😂😂
Dude you eat like everything \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you are skinny af
When your matt stone every thing is possible
You should try corn dog lol
Eat 100 California reepers in 5 minutes
what are your shits like dude?
Dang
Try döner kebab
2 mre crakers 2 minutes no water
Fucking hate eating French fries fast😂😂
🍔🍔🍔🍔🍟🍟🍟🍟
it good
Do a tuna salad challenge
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalles klar, digga!!!
I drink one of these milkshakes,one of the fries and one of the burgers and I will have stomach ache for 2 weeks lol
I reckon I could beat that ;)
I can do that no prob
there are hungry kids in africa and you using food as a challenge okay
I bet Matt stonie don't eat until every week I think he binge and purge a lot which mean eat a lot than later excercise and get sick a lot also I think he has eating disorder my opinion
Literally he doesn't gains weight\nAnd he can get diabetes and lot more deceases..like WTHELL bro
Hey could you please do a challenge ? get some bananas go to the gym and walk backwards while eating some of the bananas. the german youtuber inscope21 said you could beat him easy
yoo Man! You made me to feel hungry! But, it's 11:01PM here in India and it's closing time for McDonald's. 😣🔥🔥😣
How come this ninja don't get sick 🤔🤔
why he can eat so much???
Matt you're awesome! New subscriber here! Keep it up!
He had his throat replaced with a pipe. Damn!
This motherfucker will die fucking early lol\nThat shit is completely dumb

YES!! It gets me teary-eyed because I'm always so amazed by what she can do!
Wow😮👏👏!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is by far my favorite grace wanderwaal music ever I could listen to it FOREVER LOVE U GRACE❤️❤️🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶🎼🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤
Grace is so talented!!!!!!!! She totally deserved to win AGT
OMG GRACE IS FULL PACKAGE. AMAZING SONG WRITER. INCREDIBLE SINGING. TERRIBLY BEAUTIFUL😍😍
As a Ioyal Grace fan and as sad as I am to see her lose the agt title, in some ways it will help I believe. Grace is  now just the artist , the performer, talented singer signed by Columbia. I believe this will motivate her that prove to ppl she doesn't need agt to prove is a she amazing artist
If the music industry tries changing her into all the other generic pop singers I'm going to SCREAM. She's the most original singer of this century,maybe second to Ed Sheeran but nobody else. I was losing hope in this generation of music, lucky this angel dropped down to us!
Hey... to all the fanderwaals who preordered Just the beginning on iTunes. If you have a few seconds please rate the album if you haven't already. There are some nasty trolls dragging her rating down.
Best song yet
soon she be on tour
she so creative with music just for a 13 year old <3 you grace :)
Queen.

I love all of Grace's videos. I've been following her since day 1. She'll only get better. I hope she stays away from the Hollywood producers that are scavengers. She will learn who they are. Not nice people. As in what Kesha went thru. Stay real Grace and stsy away from the Hollywood cannibals. Love you!!! 💜

Wat is your favorite  song
I love your accent, I need it as an app on my phone that delivers bad news cause it's so calming!\n\nI remember going to a conference once and they got 20 of us round in a circle to share ideas of how a certain idea could be improved. There was a girl using a BSL interpreter to communicate and the general lack of awareness from most of the group (although I'm sure they didn't mean it) was bothering me.\n\nIt was one of those conversations where one person would stop talking and then somebody would immediately jump on their point as soon as they stopped speaking and the combo of not knowing when to speak and trying to pay attention to her interpreter basically meant that this girl wasn't really getting a chance to say anything. At one point I managed to make an opening for her (Is there anything you'd like to add?) but it made me appreciate how difficult that situation must be when trying to get involved.
Hi dear, do you find it harder to lip-read foreigners, who don't usually talk English?
I feel like a convo between the two of us in any public place would be a comedic disaster 😂😂😂 With my autism, I get overwhelmed easily, can't separate background noise from conversations I'm in, and can get really spacey (it's actually a mild dissociation to protect myself). This also leads to me starting and not finishing sentences, suddenly forgetting I'm being spoken to, and completely losing track of a conversation 😬 I feel like our spouses would just be sitting there like what are they even doing?! Do THEY even know?! 😂
Is it rude to tap deaf people on the shoulder to get their attention? I've just made friends with somebody who's deaf and wasn't sure whether that was the best way to involve her in a conversation when she's sat in her own world?
Learning key signs and the alphabet goes a long way! I'm hearing but I'm learning ASL and I used to attend a deaf club where hearing people could go to practice with HOH and deaf people and knowing basics signs/the alphabet was a saving grace.\n\n(Also now, I'm learning BSL because of you!! 💙)
Love this, and you!
Hi Jessica! I absolutely love your videos!\nMy grandfather is losing his hearing and I would love to get him to learn some signs as I think it would really help him as he often feels left out of the conversation. I know some signs (sign supported English like you use, not BSL) however he doesn't seem keen. Any advice?\nThanks!
I want to learn to sign so much!
Your sass makes this video! I never thought to give facial expressions to my voice to express my tone or attitude. Very informative wonderful video!
Great video Jessica. All I will add is that if people do some of the ruder points then I'm not sure I'd call them friends... I can't believe someone would actually cover their mouth for example and ask if you can hear them now! I suppose they're they same people who would take the mickey out of someone who stutters. 😕
I relate so much! I love your sassiness girl <3
These were really great tips! (Also #12 made me giggle.  Tone is something that wouldn't have occured to me, but it makes total sense).
gosh, youre so beautiful!! i love your style!!
Do you have a name sign Jessica?
I'm getting major Dorothy (Wizard of Oz) vibes from this outfit! Loving it! ❤️  Also, I can't believe people actually do this stuff. But your reactions to their ignorance are great. especially the crutch example.
I love these tips so much, thank you for sharing! You are a doll! ❤️❤️
Also I'd like to say I love that you sign along in your videos. I've been wanting to learn BSL for so long and binge watching your channel has gotten me further than anything else so far!
I am very lucky to not be fully deaf. I have moderate-profound hearing loss in my right ear and mild-moderate loss in my left ear. Its much lonelier than a lot of people realize. On my first day of college last week our tutor decided it would be a great idea to split us into pairs and talk to each other as a way to get to know other people in the class except when everyone was talking at the same time there was so much noise that I couldn't distinguish one voice from another and so I couldn't communicate with anyone. I was the loneliest person in that room. \nAlso I have almost become intolerant of people who insist on speaking to me softly even though they know I'm deaf and I'm already on my third 'what?'
Hi 👋🏻 Jessica that is really good things too know! I learnt a little sign language on a 10week course so I know a little but it's great to pick up signs from your videos too! Looking forward to your videos next week too! ☺️x
Your voice is so down darn calming I love it
Thank you, Jessica, this is very helpful. Glad to know a notebook or cellphone might ease communication. Eye contact and heightened facial expression are good ideas. Can't believe some people 'test' your hearing by covering their lips - so rude.
This is so incredibly useful! I especially appreciated the bit about it not being rude to pull out your phone and communicate that way if necessary. I might be hesitant to do that, afraid of offending someone, so it was good to know that you consider it perfectly fine. Also, I hadn't been aware that International Week of the Deaf was approaching, so thank you for drawing attention to it!
Plz plz plz check out my bsl videos it would mean the world to me I have a cover on my channel xx
Does Claudia know how to sign, Jessica? If you don't mind me being cheeky...what is sign for the bog? 😜 Happy International Week of the Deaf!
Thank you so much for today's topic, can relate to every item you spoke of. I sometimes do so well acting hearing ( like you, I do the hearing behavior without thinking) people forget I don't hear, and if I do not hear them then they think I am not paying attention( grrrr). Someone knowing a few important signs is wonderful! I have a question -  When you speak a word incorrectly, do your hearing friends ever correct you? If so how do you respond to this? Thank you again for sharing your list.
You're an amazing person. Thank you for this incredibly informative video. It's really helpful and important!
I say things in the wrong tone too and offend others without realizing it, but it's because I grew up in two different cultures. I also love some good gossip once in a while,  haha. I think you should make a video of some of these wrong tone incidences you've had in the past!
I love your videos! Growing up in had a friend (sarah) who was deaf and I got a basic sign language book and it was a great bonding experience with Sarah and she taught me games like writing a word on each other's back with our finger and guessing what the other wrote just by what we felt. I really learned a lot from her. I was in a sport with her and as we got older she moved away and life went on. Wish we had kept in touch. You are doing a great job educating people on what the world is like for you and how most of all you just want to be included. I hate that you get the some of the responses you do. But keep up the good work and I wish you and your wife all the best!!!!
Once again NZ is backwards to the rest of the world - our week of the deaf is in May. Im actually curious how you would deal with someone like me who stammers (or goes completely non-verbal at times) due to some of my mental health issues. Me and My ex used to spend a lot of time speaking through text because of it, and its why I started learning NZSL.
I absolutely love your personality 😄
This is so interesting, i wouldn't have thought of these things! At least now i know what to do when i meet someone who is deaf :) thanks!
Love your smile.
Great points 🌸🌹🌼
Great to know!!
I hoping to start my level 3 Signature course next month. Will have to be online as my local college only goes up to level 2. I'm in Cornwall and the closest 3 course is Bristol or Wales 😩
The sound keeps cutting in and out and I don't know if there's an ironic issue with my phone or with YouTube or if it's part of the point of this video... 🤔
This is really good for other people who have friends who are deaf or who work with them I've started my BSL level 1 and both teachers are deaf so these tips are going to be really helpful for when I'm communicating with them and any deaf people I meet xxx
Thank you for this video! As a spouse of a deaf person this covers a lot of what I am constantly telling other people about my hubby.
Typical brit problem; I can't tell when you're being sarcastic! Feel free to use your phone (you arse), yes please!.
Hello, I don't know any deaf people,  but useful things to know for when I do.\nIn other news,  my sponge rollers and lotta body arrived today. Tonight is the night. Wish me luck, I shall need it!! 😂💪🦄
I start my sign language class in two weeks and I can't wait!
Love all your videos! Relate so much to this... 5 is the worst, people will always whisper and ask if I can hear it. I have never thought of 9 but I always get a little sad after I have asked twice and they just give up. Like no I just can't hear you but I would love to know what you actually said having them use their phone will be very helpful.
I hate the fact that REAL music like this have very few views but songs like Look What You Made Me Do by Taylor Swift has almost 400M views, and that song is pure shit >;(
Gorge as always. ♡
This song made my mood for this autumn
All of this girl songs sound the same. Does she ever change the beat?
Does lana even exist during the winter?
Is this song for The Weeknd? Tap like if you agree
I honestly want to know who doesn’t have a life to be wasting their time to dislike this. Smh😒
was this sponsored by VSCO
I was so scared I wasnt gonna liek this bc I havent liked ANY of her singles for this new album but I love this.
This song needs a part two...becuz the ending makes u wonder what happens next
and Lana has done it again 👏👏👏
This has a like beat in the openeing to another Lana Del Rey song I can't put my paw on it. #furrypride
would've preferred cherry to have a video insted of white mustang :/
Where is the white mustang, Ford should sponsor the video
All the videos of this woman are the same, full of fantasies and cliches, and another thing is to be beautiful naturally and another thing is to operate the face to be an object more within this superficial world of commercial music.
ok Lana but we still need videos for cherry and 13 beaches
If you and Zayn made a song <3
What is the name of the music that plays in the end of the clip?
Lana, casually listening to her own song in the car😍💜
When you change best american record clip to white mustang, so sad Lana...
very good video and song , thank you
Lana is a stunning human being.
This video is amazing
No one ever likes my comments:( get me 100 likes😁
i love your music
Is that Garett from The Maine?
I think he looks like what Lana would look like if she was a man.
Can she live forever and never stop making music?
The day you wiped my stainn

Proud.

She's a true gem. Carved by the hands of the Almighty. She's the best!
Packing all my things for the summer\nLying on my bed it's a bummer\nCause I didn't call when I got your number\nBut I liked you a lot\nSlippin' on my dress in soft filters\nEverybody said you're a killer, but I\nCouldn't stop the way I was feeling that day\nYour record dropped\n\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white Mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white Mustang\n\nCaught up in my dreams and forgetting\nI've been acting like Armageddon 'cause you\nHeld me in your arms just a little too tight\nThat's what I thought\nSummer's meant for loving and leaving\nI was such a fool for believing that you\nCould change all the ways you've been living\nBut you just couldn't stop\n\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white Mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white Mustang\n\nYou're revving and revving and revving it up\nAnd the sound, it was frightening\nAnd you were getting a part of that\nYou gonna hit me like a lightning\n\nWhite Mustang\nYour white Mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nSaid you're a wild Mustang\n\nYou gonna hit me like a lightning\nYou gonna hit me like a lightning
I love how there was a portion where she inserted her song Get Free

Technically everything you make is canon, as in an infinite universe with infinite possibilities of anything happening, all of this could happen\nEdit: All of this will definitely happen in such an universe/multiverse
He didn't turn it over with the screwdriver :(
BOOM, BIG REVEAL, MORTY!!

Holy shit this is fucking amazing!

Your wife is stunning! And I love the name Olympia so much! Congrats.
Who was clicking like it was Snapchat
Such a great video!!
Wow, these people are really full of themselves.
Fun fact: people in the comments being edgy fools, saying stuff like the n word or don't race mix. You should mind your own business and not comment on things. Because at the end of the day you just look like a needy child.
So beautiful just like her mum

I don't consider myself politically correct, but even I can see this planet has reached a sick, sick state when even a newborn baby can't be protected from racism. I feel so helpless that I can't stop these goddam hate comments. I hope she never sees them one day.
Congrats to you and your family new member 😍😂😎😇👶
I don't understand why there is hate because of a baby being born. So what if two different races want to have a child I mean it's not your child so screw off with your opinions and nonsense. Congrats by the way.
100 % fake. Sir Rena is a man.
Aww... this is a really sweet video. Congrats.
Awww....I'm so happy for them!!!
I bet $20 that is is just some type of 4chan raid.
I loved where you guys put Grand Slam Titles: 1! Congratulations to both of you! She is absolutely beautiful! 💖
Babylon is falling!!! Time to get right with the Creator! Shalom♥
Beautiful. \nDon't let the racists get to you. We all know there's a lot of adults out there that still have some growing up to do.
Aww she's adorable!!!😱Welcome to the world little Alexis!❤️

Based Race Mixing
I Love this love
Do not read the hateful comments by angry white racists below. This video is killing them. LOL
This is fucking beautiful life being created, happiness existing, but why do y'all got to be so damn fucking aggressive damn like is there any actual reason to hate besides the fact that you want attention, or to troll, or because you were raised to see this as wrong, every one dislikes something but there's no need to be aggressive about it and blowing up the comment section doesn't help when the comment you make has been stated fifteen times already
N I G G E R
damn that name is shitty as fuck
Too bad the baby's half a nigger
Nigger
I don't get the thumbnail
Mixed breed, I suggest you take it out and kill it.
I'm surprised it didn't come out with a penis considering how much anabolics the momma monkey does.
I'm seeing a bunch of comments about racist comments but I'm not seeing any racist comments rn
Hahahahaha men can't have babies!! Lying to the world. Salvation is coming, he's the only one who gives children and I bet he didn't give you any! Liars and their moon bumps hahahahaha
Everyone is talking about the racist people in the comment but there is nearly any
Grossssssssssss
Today's generation of schoolchildren looks much different than one just a few decades ago. Nonwhites are expected to become the majority of the nation's children by 2020, as our colleague Bill Chappell reported last year. This is now the reality among the very youngest Americans: babies.\n\nBabies of color now outnumber non-Hispanic white babies (1 year or younger), according to new estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. The newest estimate shows that on July 1, 2015, the population of racial or ethnic minority babies was 50.2 percent.\nBut the scales may have actually tipped in 2013 — the Census Bureau often revises past population estimates as new data become available. That means the first of these babies are now preschool-aged.\n\nWe've already been seeing this shift in U.S. schools: the 2014-15 school year marked the first time that minority student enrollment in public schools surpassed that of white students.\n\nNPR could not reach any babies for comment.\n\n\n BLACKS.... we don't die we multiply 🤷🏾‍♂️
MAYBE SHE'LL GROW UP AND BE A GENIUS PUSHING THE EDGE OF CIVILIZATION. OR MAYBE SHE'LL GROW UP AND BE A FUCKING CHIMP. OR MAYBE NOT THE FORMER BECAUSE YOU MADE A NIGGER.

Congratulations Serena and Alexis on your bundle of joy.. She is beautiful.. Can't wait to see your wedding
Why tf does the thumbnail have Reddit people on it
I'm not getting what the big deal is here.  Are not 95% of couples equally ecstatic about their pregnancy?  Are either of these parents-to-be celebrities?  If so, how?  What exactly is the hullabaloo about this couple?
Is that Serena Williams?

Dirty fucking race mixer
WOW! You people need a cleansing of stupid. Congratulating a TRANNY giving birth. Satan is laughing at you stupid sheep. It's no wonder our CREATOR is going to come back and wipe out the filth and perverts, AGAIN. Actually looking forward to it.
*R E L I G I O N  O F  P E A C E*
Terrorist attack? Time for the left to blame trump for ALL of his tweets.
so many alleged terrorist attacks and none is solved. That shows how fragile The U.K. is. This looks like fire drill emergency response exercise.
Wow George got there fast
GAS CHAMBERS TO ALL MUSLIMS!
Why are these attacks happening? The UK did not abduct Muslims into the UK, as Americans did to Africans. Muslims themselves wanted to live in the UK, probably because they thought the UK was a better place to live than their Muslim country, and the UK welcomed them and provided them place to live.\n\nShouldn't the UK be their second motherland, if not the first? Why attack the nation that helped them? If they want the UK to become more like their original Muslim country, why not go back there? Then, they can have the strict Muslim way of living without terrorism.
need more migrants to England. this is god's way of punishing England for the many sins of the Beattles !   gods wrath us upon England for the Beattles satanic music clearly heard , satan is god  when played backwards at 45 rpm !!!!
These goat fuckers can't even create a proper bomb 😂
I live in the uk and its so sad how people find out the news and just say aw its just another terror attack like its normal
Calling any Muslim Muslim is too flattering for that word means to submit to God. That's an insult to God himself. I prefer to call them Mohammedan.
the bomb might just be a lure.. and the person who made the bomb built it to not fully explode,to fail.
It was the British government that supported the terrorists in Syria ... This is the result of their support😡😡😡😡
Lol police won't investigate anything, because this whole hoax was staged with their complacency.
It's a gallon bucket and a tiny fire, fucking incompetent terrorist but how were people even injured? Either way the device seems more or less intact so good for forensics.
Kick all the brown people out of Britain. Or kill them.
Europe & UK government just don't understand this is just the beginning so why don't y'all bring in more unvetted immigrants !!!
i can't believe josh johnson bombed the subway!
Just shows the stupidity of modern day humans. Yeah lets go up and stare through the window at the flaming improvised explosive.
Ohhh, that woman's legs are burned so badly 😣. She must be in so much pain, her skin is just peeling off completely 😟. I hope that she and all others injured are able to recover okay.
Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslim.
Women need to be taken out of politics
God, how terrible, when will this insanity end??\nIt would seem that no one is safe, anywhere. No words. Thank God no lives were lost...
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Part & parcel, y'all. Just part & parcel
Okay abc news since cnn is not reporting YOU'RE taking the hit. Now US military blow up civilians overseas but is not reported. There are numerous REAL terrorist attacks that go unreported. Sheeple claim they need evidence to prove that these are psyops but I need evidence to prove that it was real other than reporters saying so fake witnesses and police and emts everywhere. Now you can fool millions but I know that this is another psyop to invoke fear and control. I don't care about responses because this message is for abc.
I don't think the main objective of the  bomb was to hurt people if they wanted to they could have done it way better
This is some Blacklist type shit
Why is it happening to us Brits?  What did the world do to make it un safe for innocent people to get to work/other places and get attacked?
Officials will wring their hands and write a sternly worded email  to ISIS.  Instead they should pull the hate spewing imams out of the mosques by their scraggly beards and deport!!!
How do we know they are Muslim?
Where was David Duke? \n\n🤔
They will magically find a passport or know where he is hiding
This alleged terror attack is a FAKE STAGED HOAX DRILL committed by the Government & reported by the corrupt complicit mainstream media as a real event. Crisis actors used as victims & eye witnesses. ALL terror attacks in UK have been staged by the UK Government, used to implement new laws to remove your freedom & privacy, to instill fear, divide people & now they're going after free speech via censorship of the internet. Government trying to shut up anyone that goes against their bullshit lies & actions. The Government are the terrorist using psychological terrorism against it's own people.
I'm all for a safe homeland, but what a crock of shit from the parliament/media. This is probably one of the laziest attempts I've ever seen. That being said I'm glad everyone is okay.
No life threatening injuries just like your natural disasters blueye british pigs. Is it the snap crackle pop navy or is it in concert with the USA military?
Kick them all out!!!! How many more?!
I am hoping that the world will come to realize that Islam is not a religion but a Demonic Cult of War, Conquest and Deceit. Islam and Muslims need to be kicked out of Europe AGAIN.
Let me help you guys solving this case. Whoever did this was not a Boy Scout, nor a Japanese tourist, nor a Buddhist monk, nor a polish immigrant, nor a born again Christian, nor a vegetarian... I hope I have helped some.
dumb trump didn't tweet about the white kid with the gun who attacked his school and shot 6 people he didn't call him a terrorist
haters of Islam always remember : your peace is inside your grave.
Trump saying loser makes me think of a 10 year old kid...
I'm seeing a lot of hate towards the hateful. Stay safe London. Love, Johnny.
I'm honestly starting to think this was just a bunch of kids lighting shit on fire on the train.
Fuvking Pakistani fucks wreaking havoc against fucking civilians again
A BUCKET BOMB? WTF!
Hope they are alright..
Glad no one lost lifes
Did isis  did this
nh
Wow in Islamic State of London? It's not Great Britain no more. Well it's ur government that allowed this.  Attacks will be imminent. Idiots.
In my opinion every available resource on earth should be used to exterminate all radical Muslim terrorists.
Fucking greenscreen on george. Hes not in london...
BRITAIN BELONGS TO WHITE PEOPLE.
Death to Chocolate Pudding faced people !
this is what happens when you disarm your citizens they dont pull these pussy attacks in the states every other week
Why was George Stephanopoulos in london?
Here we go again.
so.....how is that open door policy for Muslims working out...?
Colonial rule.
Magic video!
Fear-mongering and it's part of living in a big city. Can you guest the idiots whom said this?\nHint: Ones a over used tea bag
*Look out dudes! Religion of blast you to pieces.....i mean, very very peaceful, coming through!*
What's to investigate? It's the damn muslims once again. The Religion of pieces.
All in the name of acceptance and equality
According to liberals: There are no terrorist...
Sadik Kahn orders you to get used to it!\nYou deserve such a mayor!
Damn London is way to dangerous
Another terrorist attack the world is going to forget within 48h. A world ran by retards.
You know the smell of burning *FLESH*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe police are coming so I have to go now 3:42
Radical islamic terrorism a culture in UK
According to Sadiq Khan, Muslim mayor of London, this is just everyday life in a big city. True. A big city in some Islamic shithole country teeming with subhuman, stinking, violent Muslims. I remember a family vacation to London in the early 1970s. Then it was actually full of courteous, civilized white Britons. I was there a second time again early this summer, and large parts of it are so rancid and violent with Muslims those areas should be leveled, the Muslims repatriated to whatever Islamic death cult cesspool they crawled out of, and the areas vacated populated by white Britons once again.
EVERY sharia-law-lover is a soon to be terrorist. KILL them all.
Ohh islam...again
Liberalism KILLS.\n\nFind a cure!
Was it Buddhist?
OUR SPECIES ARE GETTING AWFUL EVERYDAY
Damn white Christians
Hahaha everyone talk about Muslims 😂😂😂 lool
The Muslim phobic comments are awful. How do you even know who did this? Even if it was a Muslim the majority are not like you think
Islam is to blame. If you're a Muslim and you can't recognize how false and violent your religion is, I don't want you in my country! Get out right now. We are going to start making it uncomfortable for you otherwise.
I just can *not* wait to dive in to all the delightful comments! Yay, I get to learn 42 new cuss words! Oh! Is that hate on Muslims? Terrific!
Forget about banning the burqa. Ban Islam.
Another day in Londondistan
Damn Buddhists - again!
Know Muslims, No Peace.\nNo Muslims, Know Peace.
If there was an explosion then how was the bag and bucket it was in almost fully intact and barely on fire? And why was George Stephanopoulos in London? Was he there to cover another story or did he just happen to be there today? Hmm...
The Mighty Lion of Juda...Will Eradicate Islam Forever
ALAHU AKBAR\nALAHU AKBAR\nALAHU AKBAR
All this crap since we were dragged into a phoney war with Iraq based on Lies lies and more lies.
If you don't address that attacks like this are created by the whites behind the curtain, you will never ever be able to solve the issue. Addressing the root cause is the key.
This comment is a controversial opinion and will start a reply war.
It's the religion of peace, nothing new....
White people are the real terrorists
Religion of peace strikes again
jewish made sunni-radical terrorism again deport all jews and sunnis now!!!
Religion of peace strikes again
TOTAL FUCKING ZIONIST HOAX SET UP AGAIN!
Your video shows picture of a plastic pale with flames burning inside but the plastic pale is intact, didn't know plastic was explosion proof. Something not quite right here.
What if it was actually the kim regime???
Islams fucking cancer to everyone and women's oppression. Not all muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are muslims
That's fascinating to learn about Oregon's history. THAT is what white supremacists actually want, they want a space designated exclusively for white ppl for 2 reasons: 1) they believe a mixed race society will inevitably become a completely non-white society (even though given the way we select mates that makes no sense) and 2) they think non-whites are subhuman. it's a shame the Trump administration cut funding to the group that tries to help get people out of hate groups and away from that kind of mindset.
How about instead of hugging Nazis, we just send them to the wall where they belong.
LOVE
Sam gotta be squashing Maddow by now. Dig both tho.
Yay! Undermining Nazis!
Is this comedy, or a Democrat campaign?
Thanks for your good work Sir. You're a beautiful human being. You have the ability to learn, grow and change for the better. That's rare.
....but not too proud, that's how we got here in the first place.  LOL!  Hilarious!
The Nazis of the past were definitely a threat. The Nazis of today, not so much.. They can't even bring proper torches out for a mob, which says a lot about how defanged they are.\n\nThat being said, punching them isn't gonna accomplish nothing. Remember the words of Dr. King Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. For all of you advocating for punching Nazis, I a black man ask you this, has that made less riots and civil disturbances occur less across the nation? Have you truly succeed?
I want to see what criteria the use to say their have only been 6 left terror attacks I guess antifa doesn't count cause I personally can name more than 6 also didn't a left wing nut job just shoot a bunch of Republicans was that 1 of the 6
Where is the documentation, proof, studies, polls, records, etc... that white supremacist groups are the most violent? Have you ever heard of Islam, Antifa, BLM... Both sides have done horrible atrocities but to constantly blame white people is not factual.

When you feel more self-confident there's no one to blame anymore. Such a true and great quote which is the solution to envy and jealousy, I seriously needed that to start my day.
...So out of touch. ...So smug and self-satisfied... *_I don't understand why Hillary lost_*
The left IS racist AND fascist. They think other races NEED white people to SAVE them and want to control them to submit like pets. The left is racist and fascist!
love cannot exist without hate and hate cannot exist without love
Ok, so how did White Extremism become a thing in the Pacific North West? I thought that the PNW was a Bastion of Progressive Culture. I was taught that Racism was a Southern thing. Is that not true? Is it possible that there are Northern States that are more racist than the South? Shut my mouth and call me cornpone!
No promises re: punching people in the face.
I hate full frontal, it leaves nothing to the imagination.
give it up liberals, you'll never win again with your twisted hate inducing rhetoric.
Does anyone realize that Oregon is so liberal that you can't even fill a vehicle gas tank yourself? you have to have a trained gas attendant.
Ok so what happens when this former neonazi loses their job or their girlfriend leaves them? I feel like a plan that rotates around making sure white guys never suffer any hardship is not the most long term thing I've ever seen.
But not to proud, that's what got us here in the first place. Oh I fell over laughing 😂
Things will never change until THE MEDIA itself take responsibility for the message it is promoting....one word....DIVISION. STOP referring to people by skin colour/race/ethnicity in ALL situations. Change the language and u change the reality. Mainstream media is selling hate and division in the same way it sells toothpaste/cars/politicians/iphones-REJECT it in all forms, from newspaper and magazines to all tv and mainstream internet. Nothing will change for the better until we wake up to this reality.
Yo Samantha think she cool but she dumb
I never understood the need for white pride? Look the only reason black pride exists is chase when the African Americans were freed from slavery they didn't really know what they came from most of the African culture they had never known so they made their own but most of us white people now what European country we came from where can pick out on a map our heritage that also goes for Hispanic and asians we don't need to take pride in our skin color we have good old fashioned nationalism
nothing at all wrong with white pride, we aren't going to be told to be ashamed of being white
Magic video!
ANTIFA?

troubled waif......a worrying woman's woman.
I just can't like this girl....
More dislikes than comments.. and this is considered trending?
I truly pity anyone that regularly watches Samatha Bee. You cant be saved at this point.
But where are these terrorists attacks? Where are the reports? Deaths? Injuries? There are constant reports of attacks from leftwing radicals, constant reports of attacks from radical islamists, constant reports of attacks in places like the Philippines from religious radicals.
Don't you have some cancer patient to mock?
samanthabee.com/lifeafterhate  - link at the end of the episode.
Just had a terrorist attack, but WHITE SUPWEMACISTSSTST!
I'm glad to see a beautiful African american woman fight white supremacy
I'm sure the 1k dislikes didn't watch the show😐\n #LifeAfterHate 😁
most of the facts she pulls from are just provably wrong so I cant even begin to criticize the points shes making
I support the goals of Life After Hate, but the white guilt in this video is kind of nauseating.
that's insane they gutted funding wow
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
The dreamers & Medicare for all please watch https://youtu.be/XRnOdnWtQbc
I would love to meet former white supremacists. I mean that very genuinely. I just want to sit and have a conversation.
Lack of love distorts people, and love is the cure for all evil.
WATCH THE GREATEST STORY NEVER TOLD FOR TRUTH!@!
Astia sunt rasishti prin America? Nu stiam.
keep punching nazis
Hate towards cancer patients 🤔
She has awesome hand movements.
#Hillaryforprison
Great interviews Sam.
join interracially against racism on facebook
Sam is so awesome
LOVE!
Sam - flies like a butterfly, stings like a Bee!
What an evil hag. Why does she get a show?
The propaganda is real.
🏳☮🏳 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLQ_h2kdt0U    PEACE SONG PROJECT, YOU ALSO WATCH AND SHARE, DO SOMETHİNG FOR PEACE... 🏳☮🏳
I'm proud to be white.
Yeah I too dislike those terrorists that dress all black and destroy Berkley... oh wait
Why won't she ever bring up statistics in her propaganda ? Come on Samantha you are on the right side of history. Just talk about the statistics lol. \n\n\n\n\nOh wait. She literally can't.
I love all the links to the studys shes getting all of the numbers from
Thank you Sam for pointing out the blatantly obvious to anyone who can do a google search on terrorism in the USA. People should already know this, but we have to be led by a comedian to actually look at the facts and statistics.
unfunny
Why aren't whites allowed to be proud of who we are? Every race has and had bad people, why does every white person have to be held accountable for it?
What about the violent leftists terrorists at Berkeley? Didn't one just stab a woman in the neck because they disagreed with her? You know, the left that's been rioting and sending death threats to a Jew......acting like nazis.
Hahahahahahaha \nFakenews \nAmericans are not nearly as racist as we are portrayed by fakenews.
I really hate this woman... white pride is fabricated... I'm white and know white people and don't hear anything about racist thoughts...the terrorists are the left fuckwads that attack people randomly
More Alt-Left propaganda... 👎🏿
Am I supposed to give her my movie ticket?
1k dislikes?.. Keep going with this stuff Sam clearly we still have a problem..
Meanwhile in Europe...
Genuinely curious if Samantha has done a show on brown nationalism or Islamic supremacy? If one attack in America killing a white person can spark this kind of content then hundreds of attacks by one group, there has to be at least one video. If there is let me know I'd love to watch it and see if I can donate to ending hate towards whites.
Trump is a white supremacist racist, just like his white hooded daddy.  End of story.
95% blacks are Savage animals deserve to be put in zoos They ruin schools communities raping pillaging and murdering  basically a walking talking disease like cancer
Hey Trump supporters, we know reading is hard but the blank says Add a Public Comment not Add a Pathetic Comment.
You have a nasty attitude. I can't wait until you ruin your own career. \n\nAnd Trump WON!!!!!
Samantha, now do you see why Trump is POTUS?\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFUIVfKTeVg&list=PLrEnWoR732-BHrPp_Pm8_VleD68f9s14-&index=1
Choke on a bowl of dicks.
Talking about brainwashed america liberals have destroyed this world
I think we can all agree that Oregon is a terrible place where you can't even pump your own gas.
You know if someone wold say the mojordy of the tarist are black it's racist then if you say the same about white people it's not then oh wait that means ur still racist to White people wich we come to the hidden Truth this Sam is racist.
Oy vey goyim support non-whites  and have  multiracial children.
Those pesky christians blowing people up
The title should be changed to Life after Modern-Day Liberals. It's essentially the same thing.
You know how to not solve the problem people? By alienating white males... It's not like they are the one group you need to be working with to come together. It's only going to fuel more racism but keep it up guys let's drag everyone back 60 years to make yourselves feel better about Trump being president. We need to stop awarding people for playing victim or else why would anyone want to change (Hollywood).
Of course YouTube trends more leftist propaganda, you're not even trying anymore Sam, you're just making entire segments out of Salon and HuffPost articles, but your viewers have such cognitive dissonance they don't even care! They're worse than 45 supporters.
White supremacy isn't a problem here in America and if you think it is you're lagging behind the rest of us
*THIS IS ALT-LEFT PROPAGANDA*
Classic racist garbage. Thanks for nothin Samantha Bee. Talk about both sides. AKA BLM. -I hate white supremacists, I hate black supremacists.
Boycott Samantha bee. She's a vile screeching cow who blatantly lies and has been coughs lying in almost every episode. Do not trust her for any entertainment or news.
No, you should definitely punch Nazis. That's what our grandpas did in Europe and that's what we should do here.
Yet Soros funded haters cannot let go.
Samantha i pray everyday that you get cancer
Her voice is everything
this isn't fare Dua voice is more suited for this Winehouse tribute, don't get me wrong G is incredible but he screams to much this song doesn't fit his voice as good.. great collaboration
I'm sorry one take !!!!   ?? dude!!!! #HatsOff

Perfect cover!!! I love it really
So apparently there is a god and her name is Dua
wow
Muito Amy 😱👏❤️ Apaixonado por eles.
My god she  can do anything...effortless.... I think Amy would appreciate Dua...
This collab cover is OUT OF THIS WORLD 😍😍😍
nossa lindo cover 😍\na voz da Dua casou bem
Holy shit! I was just dreaming about them collabing the other day...wtf....
oh I actually thought it's Amy's voice
the type of music her voice deserves.
How can someone dislike this masterpiece?
I really don't like Gallant's voice he really let Lua down, she nailed it. she should have done it with someone else.
please put it on spotify
This is the best that's ever happened to me
must have in your music gallery 😍
i cant, i just hear her voice and get an install orgasm
When Dua hits the note at 2:46 👌
the headphones man. the headphone is like a jewel
god i would die for dua
oh my god this is amazing!
In love with this ❤️
when i saw the title my jaw dropped so low that i can't find it anymore\nbless this
I just fell in love with this cover
Good lord this is gold
Best thing to happen to me this month 😍😍😍😭🙏🏽
This is absolute awesomeness got my mind blown thanks for that ♥️

DUA YOU BETTER SING THIS ON TOUR BB 🖤
This is awesome. I really look forward to what she'll bring to the table with more style and various kind of songs
I'm dying to hear more of this. Voice quality is UGH, too much to bear. GALING!
Everyone talking about Dua but oh my, Gallant's voice is sweeeeeeeeet

When Dua hit that second verse, I start bawling. God bless you Amy Winehouse. Look at what your art did? 💖💗
WHAT. A. DUO. \nThey both have amazing vocals and together they sound even better! Loved this performance of them
Just don't understand why they still want to use a fake music back when it comes to make hits....these instruments are so good to listen to with their voices on them!

👏👏👏👏👏 What a great collaboration!
This is a match made in heaven.........LOVE Gallant he is a genius!xoxox

'Dude this is crazy I can't believe you have a kid'
Idk why but I totally teared up when Bart's mom started talking to Taika in Chinese just after Tiff spoke to him in Spanish... Boy's gonna grow up in a beautiful mix of cultures <3 Welcome to the world Taika!
I just spent like five minutes listening to an asian woman recite a speech to a baby.
Congratulations!! He's a cute, wrapping him up like a little burrito lol
I'm not lying when I say this, but Taika is seriously the CUTEST baby I've ever seen <3 I almost cried because of Tiff and Bart's adorableness. My fragile heart can't take it!
Welcome to the world taika ✌😻
Damn it's goin to know 3 languages
Who else started tearing up when tiff did
how are kids born????? jk
Just found this channel... & i am hooked!! Congrats 😍!!! The guy with the black shirt is really funny haha and taika is to cute. Btw my daughter is half filipino & half mexican (my boyfriend is filipino) & she looks exactly like her father haha
Aww congrats!!! You guys gotta keep him warm while changing diapers, newborns get cold really fast.
Well I know how everyone in the comment talk about Taika and how cute he is.... But can we take a moment and appreciate Geo's beauty... I mean she still looks sexy and hot AF... Wow... Go girl...
i love it when babies are happy like taika. upset babies r sad
For those wondering if there was a Tiff nip slip. I was watching very closely and no there wasnt because of her bra. But at least we got to see the size and how big her boobs are.
Well done I love you guys
Ikaika is the Hawaiian word for strength, not Taika lol.
I just had my baby this Sunday and I'm so happy
This baby is gonna be so loved. Tiff cared for him so much. Seeing the baby stop crying when Bart touched him was so cute .
I'm sooo happy for you guys!!! 😊😊😊
Mashallah wooowww!!! I'VE BEEN WAITING LIKE NINE MONTHS FOR THIS OMGGGG AAAAAAAH :'D
Congratulations guys. He looks just like Bart.
BIG HEAD HE GOTTA BIG HEAD HIS NAME IS Taika WITH THE BIG HEAD. Congratulations tho 😂😂😂
I CANT BELIEVE I MISSED THIS VLOG! IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!
Hate to ruin the mood, but Taika DOES NOT mean strength in Hawaiian! Mana means strength in Hawaiian! But Taika does mean tiger in Maori! But congratulations to you, Bart and Geo! I'm so happy for you two!
i should seriously stop watching their vlogs when i eat
Asian babies on average have bigger heads. I'm terrified for Tiff!
I can't find catfish anywhere  pls help with a link pls
david's going to be a great uncle
I was out of power and signal for a week so I'm finally here to say congrats!!!!

26:50 I thought the baby was in the bag...
barbellbrigade.com why don't you fucking open your website first eh?
I love Tiffany so much! She seems so sweet and motherly!
Omg I just thought of it. The baby might have to learn 3 languages.
The Maori word for Tiger is Taika! so he's literally a little Tiger, soooo cute!
Geo must b so loose if she didnt tear or anything
Seeing how proud you are to be a dad is inspiring Bart!
17:49 David says fool look like he smoked a blunt 💀
Davis is such a good friend, he likes to act thought but he is a teddy bear.
Amazing guys!!!! congratulations bart and geo your going to be amazing parents well done geo you done it!!
Jesus Christ. I cringed when Bart moved the baby without supporting the neck at 16:10.....
I don't speak that shit bro
Very unique name best of wishes
I know I'm late but congrats you guys! I'm so happy for y'all.
taika sounds like a girl name
Happy for you two, Congratz on the new born!!!

Enjoy them while they smoll, cause they grow hecka fast ! My . Myra was born December 29th 2016 and now she's almost 1 years old, time flies !
Also laughing at exactly how much Bart looks like his mom, she literally looks like Bart as a woman I'm crying LOL

Why does tiff no so much about changing diapers and swaddling
Someone forgot to blur out Tiff's breast.
Bart did you hear Tawin answer your mom with hecups
Around 9:27 Bart smile looks exactly like his mother.
Bart you are going to be a badass dad
Jesus every moment of your life your videoing, your son is born maybe just be there and take it all in smfh, these vloggers
Taika is about to be tri-ligual AF
Am I the only one who is thinking , who is that asian girl in the beginning of the video???
I love Bart's mom soooooo much!!! She seems to always be so genuinely happy and full of life! Congratulations!
Just wanna ask, is taika considered big for a newborn baby?
He's tall looking

Taika is such an ugly name...
Oh my god, this all happened so fast! I'm so happy for you guys, he's adorable!

That little burrito is so adorable
Bart's my dawwwg
Taika sounds nice!
i have flatter feet than Bart lmao
Do you feel this finga enagee 😂😂
1:44 Is that the Character voiced by Gabriel Inglesias (I keep forgetting his surname) or Cheech Marin? I hear they both play a character at a desk.
Eh book of life already did this we'll see how this fares against it
Is the book of life.... Copy?
what is the 1:10 background song?
does anyone else know the music is Celtic woman
This looks like a cute movie but the message looks really cliche. I hope they mix it up and don't have this movie being upheld with only pretty animation.
This is so great!!!
That dog definitely has hair
0:24 \nLA CHANCLA!!!!
I found my Spanish voice, lol I'm everything but this movie is a must see!!!
did they have to give away the whole story and plot in one trailer
What is the name of the background song???
I'm not questioning why the skeleton is sneezing without a nose.\n\n\n\n\nI'm questioning how it's sneezing without organs.
sounds like a kind of version of the equal to ariel
Will this Movie include an earthquake simulator?
Anyone notice Bittersweet Symphony playing in the background?
Inspired by the Dia de los Muertos, obviously
I hope they tackle dementia with the grandma character.
To all you people complaining that this a Book of Life rip off, they're about the same holiday. Obviously they'll have similar aspects. That's like saying two Christmas movies are ripping each other off because they both have Santa in it.
And the old debate over Ants vs Bug's Life gains new followers to carry the torch.
Oh, Good Lord, 'do what you want no matter what people tell you're, why Pixar? Disney has done it a million times already! And I gaurentee you he will somehow get someone to remember him before at 6:59 am, just before sunrise, 100 percent gaurenteed.
Stop saying its the book of life, tbol was about a love triangle and bull fighting, this one in about music and family
Y'all can't have more than one movie representing Latino heritage without saying they're the fucking same smh
Hey you know that dog looks a lot like the dumb seal in finding dory
Wow I can't wait for the book of life 2
My grandmother was exactly like that according to my mom.  She can be brutal as all hell if you got on her bad side.
Book of life but with a kid and a dog
To all those comparing this to Book of Life:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX7bfDT_Yok
Who else has ever tuned a guitar with a pair of pliers?
I can already tell this is going to be one of their lowest rating films ever!
This is just like book of life! They even have the same concept of being forgoten and being lost
I can't wait for this movie it looks so good !
Ugh this is such a blantant ripoff of monsters inc.
I wasn't expecting they use Bittersweet Symphony for the trailer.
This really reminded me of that other movie book of life
YEAH THERE IS NO WAY SKELETON HAVE A NOSE LIKE THAT _)@
0:04 the momment you do something and somebody into Your room ( bad english sorry )
I really liked Book of Life, this one looks promising as well!
The next level of book of life movie
Can't wait to see COCO😂😀 n hey. Whatch out for the chancla😂😁😘😘
The kid probably is gonna be transgender 🙄
I just want to know what song is playing in the background of this trailer. I feel like I know it / recognize it, but I can't put my finger on it.
My god Pixar, I mean this is gorgeous. Every Pixar film is amazing or at least decent (Accept Cars 2) but my god this takes animation to a whole new level I'm mostly excited for Pixars coco there first musical.
I'm excited to watch the movie
Wasn't the main character from book of life also not allowed to play music even though he wanted to?
there should be cholos in this movie
I AM H Y P E ABOUT THIS LATINO/A REPRESENTATION
But like...\nWhy do disney mkvies stick to the formula of a young character wanting to be/do something and then having their parents stop that goal in the first act, but are then redeemed in the second or third act; where the parents reveal thry do it out of love? Moana did this with her not being allowed to explore, brave did this with merida wantibg to not be a princess, mulan the same thing, nemo wanting to explore ect. I like how this has a spirited away thing going on (though not wholly otiginal either (corpse bride))
Visually this movie looks beautiful. I might go see it.
Pixar's First Movie Musical. Can't wait!!!
Looks like a beautiful movie
I hope they make bendy and the ink machine the movie
Two movies take place in Japan\n*People say nothing*\n\nTwo place take place in Mexico\n*IT'S JUST LIKE BOOK OF LIFE!!!*
Sooo if you disappear once no one remembers you, does that mean Hitler would live forever? Because he's going to be in history books for a long time....
I only hope this lives up to its predecessor: The Book of Life
The first time I've seen a xoloitzcuintli in a movie
Finally a Coco comment section that ISN'T full of BoL fans calling it a ripoff.\nEdit:  nvm apparently people still think it's a ripoff
This..... movie better break records and CRUSH the box office DO YOU HEAR ME!? this better be as good as their old greeaaat  no AMAZING movies,..................................................................................................................................................................and Pixar pleeeease I beg of thee don't screw this up.
My Sunday school teacher is an animator for Pixar and has been working on this movie. I can't wait to see it.
Can I just say I am grateful my mother hasn't hit me with a chancla yet, she has about five pairs sitting on a rack...
This looks really cute, but the storyline is cliche. Some kid wants to follow his forbidden dream, goes on a journey, proves to his family that his dream is actually good, etc. etc.
Book of life
Cant wait!!!!

They're remastering the book of life already?
What a nice advertisement for the book of life!!
Can't wait for book of life 2, though..This one has a lot less style. Hmm..
The book of life?
Is this supposed to be a Disney/Pixar Book of Life version kinda thing
Isn't it pretty much a copy of the book of life but in more modern times
I gotta say this is best/worse version of the book of life
What in the world is that multi color panther thing supposed to be?

Please do this again. And with more people
So small critic, there's two versions of the SCAR you used the SCAR-H image instead of the SCAR-L. Looks fun though
Having a Drone film overhead would make this amazing
When are they going to tell D it's Evike not Evick
I love D and jet
Wow pubg's  graphics have gotten way better

I would love that actually, to play this with friends, but the problem is when they got hit mostly people would lie i didnt get hit
Way too unrealistic, when they were looting, there wasn't 30 different pairs of pants in each room.
Nice video but it's boring there is no kills WTF

The hardest thing about this is crouching. Your legs will start lactating from not standing normally and eventually you will die.

Best video i have seen i long time! <3
Guys i wish your play dead by daylight in real life
if you didn't mention it was airsoft and everyone died like realistically and didn't get up or talk then so many people would flag this video
so in the real pubg can you execute someone who's already knocked out?

What the heck is that
#lava minatour lava THE FLOOR IS LAVA#real
why didnt the house get burned
I believe this was the premise of a book by yahtzee Croshaw
You can tell that guy is a master climber\nAnd they would be dead standing that close to lava
When the they look out the window everything became straight up hell
I'm so sad😢😢
Is that actually lava cause if it is then I will pee my pants
Only people who can walk on the lava are moms
What now the air is lava
I wish this was a real movie😂
the beginning scared me when he was opening the door i thought it was the shining for a sec 😂
You take a few months don’t you think ??
Is this movie a reference to that archer episode with kreiger cleanse?
So someone already pointed out that the house should have burnt down but what about the sulfur poisoning
The amount of after efects and premier proo
i think i'll never ride my dead friend on the lava
Who's watching this on the floor?
What a bad time to choke on a smoor
Stop drop.. and do a BARREL ROLL!
So which one was freddie wong?
The floor is taxes!
It was a mannequin arm derp
Your a bit late pal
That was awesome  [ subscribe, like ,share]
That lava look really real
Yes! Wake him up by tossing water at him - Any clue what happens when water touches lava? :) \nI work at an aluminum factory.
Holy crap this develop d from childhood game to ultimate American Ninja Warrior
Dose anyone now of a sprinkler or a fire alert?
casey sounds like rick from rick and morty a bit
I'd never ever seen something like that at all you guys are awesome
His body didn't burn and he can't be that light
The for is lava 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
When a less violent super volcano 🌋 erupts, if one actually erupted you'd be dead in 2'seconds
Best exuse to do parkour in your house
That is so so good
4:07 Wouldn't his body melt in flames?!
This is like a crappy sci fi movie
Prime example as what we saw as kids bs what our parents see
i love the part when they use a dead body as a lava raft XD
Is this a After Effects editing?
when nick gets too far
Just tape pillows to your feet
Who else thinks they should make bloopers??\n🐈🐈🐈🐈 🔫🔫🔫🔫🔪🔪🔪
Guys THE FLOOR IS LAVA
THIS IS THE COOLEST VIDEO EVER \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG

Looks lovely Fleur
Always reliable reviews! Thanks Fleur! That lip gloss looks amazing.
LOVED the casual setup! :)
Love your videos 😘
love it
You are my favorite You Tuber!!! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗
Love your nail color
£6&10 p&p !!!
Best FENTY video I've watched! Thank you Fleur!  x
Hey Fleur!Lovely video!Since you love a more natural and dewy foundation may I ask if you ever had sn issue with sunglasses?I love the more light and dewy textures but every time I wear my summies  I can see the foundation rubbing off at that spot
Please tell me what you have on your skin?! Like your arms look so tanned and glowy? 🙋🏼👍🏻
Why didn't you d a make up look rather than talking only?
I wasn't to quick to jump the Fenty Beauty hype train either but I did get the foundation and I love it. I have oily skin and I was impressed to see that my makeup stayed on and didn't start to look funky after a few hours. Definitely will be getting a few more products and possibly an extra bottle of the foundation.
Do you not have your apartment in London anymore?
Loved your review, it was so honest which was lovely! The foundation looks like my colour which is nice because I am so pale and there are hardly any options out there so it is good that she is covering all shades :) I am so excited that you are pregnant, I can't wait for baby de force!!!
This is probably the millionth fenty video I'm watching 
You picked the ame shades in the Match Stix and Killawatt  as I did  but I am shade 300-320 lol a TRUE medium-tan gal.
Your skin looks so beautiful and float with this collection!!
You're so pretty!! Love this review and look
Such a shame about the foundation colour. I'm excited to see how the products work on my skin. Thanks for the review! Xx
What's that nail polish? Looks amazing <3
Looks like the perfect foundation shade for me so at least you've helped someone find the right shade even though you've lost money haha! Thankyou! X
I love it that you are so honest but beauty products xx \n theoctoberedit.blogspot.com
My foundation Shade is NW 15 for MAC. What Shade would suit me best? I live nowhere near a Harvey Nicholes :(
Brill video! What nail polish have you got on here Fleur? I love the colour! 💜 xxx
Hi! What nail polish are you wearing? I love it!!!
Love the stripes and dungarees combo ❤
I loved how chill this video was! And your review was soooo helpful - I was also hesitant to spring for another celeb range but now I totally want to try out a few pieces!
HI Fleur you look lovely!  Sprinklyofglitter tagged you in a baby name tag can you do it? Would love to hear your answers xo C
I definitely have my eye on a few of these products after watching this! Loved the set up of this video, Fleur!
I love the highlighter duo too. Not a big fan of cream products, but might give the cream blusher/highlighter and cream contour a go.
Iv been watching your videos for yours and i really love the old way of reviewing you have bought back, its felt more natural and like heres the products lets talk! Really enjoyed this video , hope you do many more like this!
you are literally glowing throughout your pregnancy!! <3
Rihanna did go an awesome job she SLAYED her products
Did you put blotting sheets in the wrong way around??
Love videos like this! Feels so down to earth and you look stunning!
Great review. I really enjoyed your thoughts and the makeup looked beautiful.
LOVE this more casual chatty video!! xx
Love the set up for this video! So 'at home'. Thanks for your review :)
Actual product review begins at 11:07. You're welcome. GEEZ! SMH
The Estée Lauder cushion what shade did you use please...it looked gorgeous -\nAs are you!!\nThanks for this,found it really helpful.
I know the foundation wasn't the right shade for you, but kinda wish you had kept it on! I've heard the sticks don't pair particularly well with the foundation formula and wanted to hear your thoughts on it aside from color match!
You look stunning!!! Natural beauty+pregnancy glow= beyond words beauty! Fleur you look lovely, and by far the best/most honest reviwe I've seen so far! Lots of love! Xx Tatty
Hi Fleur do you think the Fenty primer is better then the Two Faced Hangover one?
I love this sort of video! You're so gorgeous but I must say, I'm still not excited by this brand. It seems expensive but cheap...
I always trust your reviews... I tried the gloss on my hand at Sephora , the smell is amazing! It's so pretty.
This is my favourite video of yours in ages. It was a really professional review, IMO. I really like how you gave candid first impressions of the good and bad of each product, whether or not you ended up liking or disliking them. I feel like it was really honest and helpful! I agree with the others, as well: I'm not sure if you've changed your lighting or hair colour, but you're looking extra stunning in yourself here, too. Keep it up!
Great video! The casual vibe, the fact that you paid for the products, watching you apply it like in the old days, all of it! Loved it!
Honestly i loved this style of video!
I don't know if this is true but I have heard that the foundation oxidises to a few shades darker x
Hey Fleur! There have been too many beauty videos lately... At least for me... How about some bags? Shoes? Thanks!
Really love this review, very genuine.....more less planned videos in the future 👍👌
Your pregnancy really suits you! You're stunning! <3
Great video, I fully expected to hear you hating the products because I tend to associate you with higher end brands and products. I really love that you got excited as a consumer and I agree that your video seems to be the most unbiased so far! Love the laid back feel too! Xx
The blotting paper looks like rizla skins and a rolling machine for joints 😂😂😂😂
1) your excitement is contagious, 2) your make up afterwards looks BEAUT, 3) girl, that t-shirt and dungarees are a LOOK
dont think u knew how to pull the blotting paper out because ive seen others do it just fine ..
Where are your dungarees from? x
Loved this video. Loved how long it was and informal. Just chilling it with a friend style.
you literally have a holiday glow with this ! <3
great review. really thorough and well-explained. your word choice is so specific and accurate. keep it up!
I really liked this old style video with a classic review and try on. Looks great and now I would love to go out and pick up that lipgloss! :)
I realize this video was a little on the spontaneous side; that being said, I REALLY enjoyed it. It felt very authentic and had a nice, relaxing vibe. This video was a great example of how you don't need to go all out to make quality content. If the enthusiasm is there, the rest will follow. \nOn a slightly unrelated note, I don't know what it is about this particular video, but you really looked like Hannah in some parts of it. I've never really thought that before. Obviously, I've noticed the familial similarities, but I've never looked at the both of you together and thought, twin moment. For the record, that was meant to be a compliment. You both are beautiful gals!
Really love this style of video, Fleur! Please do more first impression/live haul type videos. xx
Loved this video Fleur! I find that I prefer videos like this (you called it raw). I like it without a studio or studio lighting etc. It feels more natural and less produced and therefore more real. I hope more youtubers go back to this style of video. I want to feel like a friend is telling me about products, not selling me some on HSN. Great job and you look fab!
Fleur, do you still have the London apartment?
Your skin looks amazing 😍 pregnancy is really working for you! Are you going to try another shade of foundation? Would be good to hear your opinion of your shade, also love the casualness to the video xxx
I wish you used the white because I haven't seen a review with it yet
LOVE this style of video! You're glowing and look absolutely stunning!!!
very nice video, good review :)
your skin looks amazing in this Fleur! <3
I don't think I'm going to indulge in this line myself, but it does look lovely. And I loved the more relaxed, hands-on review style -- both informative and casual, like a (circumstantially one-sided) conversation with a friend!
You should never buy makeup online , you should always try it first on your face (physically go to the shop)  , because when you buy online it always ends up being lighter or darker in real life.
Might have to get the lip gloss!!
What's your nail color? It's so pretty!
Love this - you should do more first impression videos!
Totally random, but what colour / brand nail polish are you wearing??? Its gorgeous!! x
please do more first impressions just like this! casual, honest, no big production required, just a good solid chat... loved it!
Your skin looks incredible!! Please please do a cushion foundation best and worst! X
The contour colour looks amazing on you!
I'm glad u gave it a good review! I wasn't hyped about the line either BUT once I found out what was in the range, my interest was peaked! I only purchased the lippie and primer. They were out of my foundation and I can't buy anymore highlighters until I've used up what I have. Seriously, how many do u actually need?!?! Ultimately, I'm pleased to see that u liked it bcuz as a black woman, the range of foundations for us is  UNHEARD OF. We still don't have a STRONG market catering to us and our beauty with ALL its many shades. So, I think THAT is really what the hype was about. Black women/girls felt like, FINALLY, someone thought exclusively about US! It's not so much about Riyanna (did I spell that right?) and if my Caucasian, and Asian sisters don't understand that, then you've missed the whole point. #bravo Fleur!
Loved the style of this vid xx
I feel like you match exactly my colouring! Hope you get to try the foundation in the right shade one day
Loved the style of this video, very natural X x
Tear the blotting paper against the blade from one side to the other instead of ripping it :)
Love this video Fleur! So different for you, in a good way 😊 you also look absolutely beautiful! X
Are you going to get a foundation that matches for a second review?
Oh my goodness I love love loved this video! I enjoyed the more relaxed vibe you had going on and you are looking so beautiful. Love to you, Mike & all your fur children! Xx
I hope your read this, but I'm in love with your tragus piercing. Would you mind sharing where you got it? It's so cute!
It wasn't Rihanna fans rushing to the stores to get some, it's the POC finally having their shades.
I wanted to say thank you for doing this!  A lot of vloggers who are not women of color are turning their noses up at this. Thank you for doing this for your colorful audience!
what shade are you in estee lauder double wear cushion?
Turn the blotting tube upside down (tooth side down) then rip. As opposed to ripping up upward. Side note, love your nail color 😍
i've missed the tutorials ! :)
Really REALLY loved this style of video, including the natural looking lighting. It seemed very spare of the moment and I got the feeling you weren't planning on putting the makeup on to start with. Something about it just seems so natural and friendly (not saying you aren't always friendly 😁) keep them coming and I hope you are keeping well xxx
Fleur's reviews are the best reviews 💕
Which colour you have in the Estee lauder cushion foundation .😄
Song at the end?
This one seems sloppy. The words they use don't go with the mouth movement so well.
I didnt know Oberyn Martell was in this lol
I instantly recognized the music at 3:15 as the music from joffery’s part in medieval Fun Time land
Probably the best BLR I've seen. It helps that I love Narcos.
Felt like I was watching a\n Adam Sandler movie trailer. \nNo need to see this movie since they played the whole thing in the trailer.
I just finished the first season and that makes this twice as funny
I'm from Pensacola FL too :)
can u guys do the walking dead part 3 and do negan
Booyah, homie.
Meeebbe BBQ, or mebbe burr--EEE--toh.
YAYAYAYAYA
Mah legs broke, AHH!
I would totally watch this if it was a real movie :D
Please make some Star Trek BLR
make a extened version of the song in this
After watching this i thought I watched Narcos Season 1 completely. I was looking for this story throughout the season. 😂😂😂😂
I'd watched this.
It's amazing how you get this video to look like a completely different show. With dynamics, plot and all!
This would be an excellent movie
I would watch a whole series of stranger things with the voice over of blr. Or the movie  IT. Do it, do it now!
Look where your flippin' fingers are. It's not cool to have a hand stuck in your anus. Was so fitting of a line for a hand puppet.
I've never watched Narcos but if I do, I'll be disappointed it's not this.\n~ A.P.
You should BLR the MADDEN 18 coach cut scenes! Lmfao they look like they're talking trash to each other! DO IT!!!
what are the songs used in the video?
I'd REALLY like to see this.
What's the song that starts at 5:59 ?
Almost as funny as mideval funtime land. Almost; but just as good.
Who else wants to see this show instead of narcos?.
Would probably be the best rom com of the century
Mama need to hit that! kills me all the time!
Anyone know what's the music at the end?
Can anyone tell me the name of the song at the end? I think it's pretty awesome
Can i have just have the full version of the song at the end please
Wow. That was really really good. I'd see the shit out of that movie.
Do one of The Sopranos!
Maybe a salad\nI don't train myself to starve\n😂😭😂😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Awesome and the real show is a freaking masterpiece
Never thought love had much of a point. But I was wrong: it has a thousand points. #incredible
What's that song at the end?
This parody trailer was more cohesive than many other real trailers.
This should be the actual show
This was awesome. Just binged all 3 seasons. Loved it!! And this!
I'm glad I watched the show way before this came out. Haha wish this was a movie.
3:14 killed me.  I'm dead now.
Lol... Can you make another The Walking Dead blr
This looks so much better than the real show.
wait, is he making all this music too?
I want to see this version
This is comedy at its best good one
but they love me... - I know...  This is brilliant.  How did a bad lip-reading make me feel like I watched Lars and the Real Girl? Touche universe...
Another BLR breath of intelligence in a generation devoid of creativity, originality and genuine humor.
This was done so well I forgot that it wasn't real. Bravo, Bravo 👏🏾
Bravo! I'd watch this version.
Great job. Love this show. 👍😎💸
Hi Bad Lip Reading can you do Jacob Satorious--sweatshirt please and thank you
this story is more interesting then the real narcos
I'm really disappointed that this isn't how Narcos really went lmao
This is LITERALLY the exact opposite of the show 😂
This was a bit of a tear jerker.
Poeeeease do another Game of Thrones one
This needs to be a real show, same with Medieval funtime land
Who are you? Your beautiful firstborn son!LOL!!!
Pepe saw me pooping while I was eating s'mores and also crying.
This is better than the actual movie! 😂
Can this please be real. Like I said please.
What's the song at 6:10?
Pablo is like the H3H3 of crime 😂
Boring af BLR just isn't funny anymore
You guys have to do the scene in Tombstone when Doc Holiday meets Johnny Ringo.
I have no clue what the real show is about, but I wanna watch this show instead....
This sounds like a really good fake movie... now I want to really watch it.
Does anyone know the song at 6:10?!?
If this was what the actual show was like, I would still watch it... lol
They don't post near enough.
Okay BLR you need to get this green-lighted and get the director from Napoleon Dynamite to direct it. You guys have a hit here.  I want to see this in theaters by next year.
Amazing how it actually looks like they're saying it based on looking at their lips
I'd watch this if it was a real movie. This was awesome, lol
Being a big fan of the show I think this is an excellent spin on what the show is actually about, I mean this is so cool!
This is the first time I've ever been interested in watching this show.
I love you guys. If it is possible you should redub a whole show.
I only date women who have little tiny fingers.
Definitely prefer this translated version of the show.
That's the plot of a Bollywood movie called Don.
Supernatural bad lip reading please!
Press the cork board up so the entire manatee is behind the preacher. I like blr's new style. Making it suspenseful, humorous, family related, then emotional. This should totally be a real movie taking out some funny parts. I think this was a great blr and blr should make more like this. Your head IS a butt.
Awesome 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Two words...\n\nPURE GENIUS!
This is beautifully edited. Bravo, BLR!
Wow bravo!!
Please do Stranger Things
Omg. Please make these happen
Soy Milk.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wait*
5:30 is my fav bit. 😂
This is legendary
Meby babaque or meby burrito
SOY PAPLO!!!
Wack
*Boo-yah Homie*
This is so great, that I think I've watched it at least 3 times a day since it came out. Keep up the good work BLR!
My balls itch just looking at these things
It can't only bother me the way he says burrow
It's like a tiny little civilization in one little pool. \nAnd that Fills you with determination. Any other undertale fans?
he should make a episode on animal planet👏👏
Hey Coyote you've had that watch for a rlly long time, go get a new one from Leathertavern.com!!
Brave Wilderness should be on TV everywhere. It reminds me of Deadly 60, just without the list and ranks 😂
I thought it was corny. Then, I thought it was cool. Now, I subscribe.
I don't like The start when we get a sneak peak
Whoever does the background music makes it feel like a movie
And where there are marine creatures, there's Coyote
you sound like charlie from sunny lmao
make a draw my life
Congrats on the big 8mil! Well earned :)
what is the intro music used during your commentary in the beginning, it was awesome!
This feels like a fieldtrip! I feel the stress going away.
aren't some sorts of shrimp have some sort of venom/poison deal with their spikes?
2:58 did anyone else see coyote fail at parkour and feel really embarrassed 😂😂
I hate sea urchins.  One stung me and it hurt like hell.\nWhen stung, the best natural treatment is to pour urine on the stingers.  NEVER, try to pull the spines out as this would cause swelling and infections.  Because they are barbed, if you force the spines out it will cause a massive cut.
😱😱😱you are awesome
sea urchins taste good
But that intro doo
10:56 Woah a rainbow
The end tho omg 😍
4:29 age restriction
This is the best youtube channel ever
Love your vidios
When COYOTE Plants All His Creatures facts .
The 2nd time he got spiked I got the Crap scared out of me lol
Lol he said it's called secret beach I live in Hawaii and pretty much every beach someone doesn't no the name of they call it secret beach
The only entertaining YouTuber who doesn't clickbait
1:33 am I some how the only one who thinks Coyote Peterson looks like a badass with glasses on?
This guy is honestly the best Youtuber alive
OMG!!!!!!!!! I GOT THE BOOOOOOK!!!!!!!!!! AND ITS GOING TO BE HERE IN ONLY 7 DAYS!!!!!! I AM SOOOOOOO HAPPY OMG!!!!!!!!!!
he flipped us off lol not really
Hello Coyete,\n\nDid you try getting shock from Electric Eel and Are you planning on trying it out with Electric Eel in any time future?
humans are miraculous creature. they eat everything whatever they get.
I want to see that you see a koalah
I love you so much I want to live with you
+ you were in kuai and i was in Ohou so i still would not have seen you
I found sea urchins have their anus on top, like starfish. But that aside, this is great to witness :D Never knew they came in the helmet variety, and that shrimp is really awesome.
i love this channel, congrats on 8 million!
Well deserved 8 mil subs man. Every video has good detail, perfect camerawork and a funny host.  Please consider making documentaries of the places you visit (40-50 minutes).
Does anyone wonder how he hasn't killed himself yet? No? Only me? Ok.
i really like it !
I have drank,the black ones in Greece, after four ,u are in to a whole onther world, amazing high ,amazing ,
His voice is not cut out for his work.
Why do you do this to yourself ???? It's so painful
This guy earned his subs, other people like lispyjimmy, mrbossftw, and other youtubers, clickbait, it's pathetic, btw congrats brave wilderness on 8 million subs you earned em. 👍
You should go to Puerto Rico

mark: how did that happen??\n\ncoyote: chiw chiw
Im getting spongebob vibes from that urchin
Looks like a peppermint shrimp
The helmet urchin is the roomba of the tidepools
And where there are marine creatures, there is coyote.
Well done on 8 million , when I used to watch Brel and she was in 3 mil for forever and we just raced passed her
Coyote get stung again mark it got you again?
cody come to lousana to get bet by a co\nper head
Can you do a getting bit by horse video? Please.
This is FAR more scary than Joy Of Creation xD
I think he shouldnt use a title like that, it rests content on the video. In my opinion exploring the tide pools of hawai would be more fitting
It looks so much like Reunion Island !!
Did anyone jump when he held it and it stung him?
Why dont you guys have a show in TV???
it looks like a peppermint shrimp, which is pretty common.......
i love eating raw sea urchins :0\nit just melts in your mouth!
I ment to say frog  by accident
can you do a draw your life video
I love how he calls the animals buddy! that sooo cute!
Coyote my dad is going to Arizona for 3 days and his name is wyatt garcia!! I told him to look out for you!!! And I love you so much!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😘😘

Hi

*_YOU CANT AND AFFORD IT_*
fuck you, jack... just fuck you.. i spewed out my drink on that parody.
I'm surprised you didn't mention the facial recognition fail during the conference.
H
I think I'll take the Afford It
Apple forgot the Arabians

Brian tong
😂😂😂😂\nDamn....have to say, might be even funnier than Sam's over at SamTime (SAMTIME! You hear that Google? SAMTIME, not SameTime!)
Why big company is seem to skip the 9?
One day Apple will remove the cameras and say , Heyy look!! We totally removed the cameras from the iphone because nobody will need them. Why use a camera when you have your eyes to see things directly.
I'll just stick with my 6 thank you very much
So I buy a notebook
JACK YOU BETTER RE ENACT THE ENTIRE EMOJI MOVIE USING THE ANIMATED EMOJI THINGS
Title says parody, but it's pretty accurate.
I'm actually scared for the new generation..
Can't wait to reenact the emoji movie while I live under the free way and go to Starbucks for the free wifi.
Vin Diesel has three of these already
You can't and afford it😂😂
#nooneisgoingtogethatgame\n\nWhat is the point of displaying a crappy ass game like that, they only went on their for potential downloads that’s not gonna happen
😂😂 This has me dead 😂😂
Next thing you know it they won't have a charging port and when your phone dies you have to pay the same price for it again
How the fuck do you access siri
Am I the only one who thinks this new phone is sick??
So this is what our technology has gotten us.. A fricken emoji phone 😂😂😂
With the money i can also get a galaxy note 8 or s8, literally i phone x attempted to copy the infinity display, samsung had most of the features 2 years ago that just got released on iphone x
Wow, it has a bigger forehead than Jack.
Steve has been turning in his grave since the day he died
Or recreate the Emoji Movie ...I already did ;)
You just killed me
wow face id\njust like windows hello like 5 years ago
Can someone tell me at least one thing that Jobs wanted and they did not do it  ?

Why is no one talking about the undertones of Nazism in the Emoji Movie?
My only question, what happened to the iPhone 9?
Was that even Parody ? o.0
If Samsung made a new flagship phone with a huge notch like that apple fans would be laughing...
hahaah wtf you have good comedy
Good phone Apple!\nThis Comment Cost 1000$ To Make\nAnd special thanks to Apple for sponsoring, advertising, and overhyping this comment.
IOS looks like it was designed by Fisher Price lol
What the fuck the parody sucked my soul. LOL
I can't 😂 😂😭😂😭😭😭😂😂
bahahaa love this
Top 10 life hacks
I want the You can't colour pls
You should of mentioned “the 8 is now all glass so you can now crack your entire device instead of just the display, plus we even made the new iPhones 8 thicker and heavier which we realised after the iPhone 6 that it was too thin to bend
This is like the 6th time I watched it and I die laughing every time
I really just read the chapter about dementors in Harry Potter right before I saw this video
Im not an apple fanboy, i dont even own anything from them except an ipad air 1 wich i bought used for cheap but why all this hate. Its kinda ridiculous, so many people jelaous because they cant afford that phone.. i mean the note8 is also almost 1k and nobody makes fun of that... \nAnd this vid is FAAAR from funny... he just rides the apple wagon of hate...
Tbh, I wouldn't like the face recognition to unlock my phone. If someone wants to unlock my phone if I got the iPhone X, they would just have to take my phone from me and put it infront of my face. I feel like that wouldn't be safe :/
Wow wait one minute, are you saying this phone lets you be a.....emoji. My god we truly are in the future now ladies and gentlemen, all I need now is a emoji MMO and my life will be complete.
Why do people keep saying faceid  on Samsung can be fooled by anyone. I mean if someone is gonna take in the effort to print a picture of me just to unlock my phone u have a serious problem lmao. Plus faceid  concept is crap.  I don't use it on my s8 nor will I use it if I get the X. Pin is still the best way. Or if you have s8 the finger print scanner 😚
Samsung rules
I want one 😱😂😂😂
*HEY BRO CAN I BORROW YOUR EMOJI MACHINE?*
1 lakh de ke talking Tom jaisa chudiyapa.
What the fuck the thumbnail shows iphone X but vid shows the emoji machine
So Iphone 8 cost 800$.  Iphone 10 cost 1000$. Oh boy i cant wait for Iphone 24.
I can buy a car with $1000....
Hey guys\nSub to me and I'll sub back\nHave a nice day ❤️❤️❤️
Seriously! Why the fuck did they put that black bar on top of the screen??? My OCD is fucking killing me!😡
Please choose a way to pay for your new iPhone X:\n- Credit\n- Debit\n- Kidney
if i want to break into the iphone x just grab your phone when your sleeping put phone in face and ta-da i can do what ever i want\n\n\n\npass
No headphone port = NO MONEY FOR YOU!
*Lol, when iTards call their jewelry “a milestone”.* Sorry, but Nokia had better smartphones before the shitty iPhone. It had actual features, a camera, 3G, 3D audio APIs, a freaking _file manager,_ SSH and scripting, and a copy-paste button! Oh, and an actual keyboard. All the iPhone had, was “Ooh, teh shiny!”. Which is appropriate for something that is not a computer, but jewelry, I guess. Then the iDiot came along, and acted like he “invented” all of it, and did so first! Ripping off everyone else _yet again!_ Just like with the Xerox Alto that he copied the Mac from.\nAnd because Microsoft panicked, and installed the Steven Elop mole in Nokia, to murder it from the inside, before their Linux-based glorious N900-line phones were finished, Nokia died a death as miserable as Windows Phone and iOS combined. Yay!\nFucking power of the passive-thinking retards! This is why actual democracy is a bad thing.
Let's be honest here \nThe iPhone 7 and iPhone X are just useless
Noooooooooo dang it this channel says bad words

I love indoesia
ｍｏｒｅ　ｈｕｍａｎ　ｔｈａｎ　ｈｕｍａｎ
Short?  We need a full length film of this !!!
This is one of those few times where I happily exclaim, Make it 4hours long, Make it a series, Make it a Mini-Series!!  This collaboration of Blade Runner and Shinichiro Watanabe is just too perfect to simply condense it into a short film...
See you space blade runner...
Anime, cyberpunk and FlyLo, as if that isn't the best combination
Holy shit this is perfect. I really hope we get to see more stories from this world in different formats.
By Shinichiro Watanabe! Holy shit fuck the new movie i want the anime version :D
this is probably gonna turn out better then the new movie
Screw the new live action movie! We want anime.
10 bucks this is over hyped\n00:50  and 00:56 wrong . the world of blade runner ISN'T a dirty trash filled distopia ,\n00:53 why did need to add goofy star wars hats to the police. the cops in blade runner are normal cops .\nthe world of blade runner is product practical NOT what looks (((scifi)))
A western movie being adapted into anime? YES This is what I'd like to see more, not the other way around and end up with shitty adaptations...
i guess we're gonna need this short to be significantly less short than it is probably gonna be... more like 150-something minutes short...
Also, is it just me, or doesn't those animation sheets look pretty massive in physical scale compared with most other standard animation paper? Or is it to accomodate more detailed drawings for theatrical cinemascope animations?
I'm glad they put subtitles on, because I don't know Japanese...
I never asked for this...but I'm glad.
I need a background of the girl at 1:01
I can't believe we're getting a new Shinichiro Watanabe project with music from Flying Lotus. This is literally a dream come true. I'm sure the movie will be great in its own right, but this is something else.
I'm freaking stoked about this. This is going to be amazing.
Good to see the world of BR coming back to life again.
They could expand this into a 26 episode series, it'd definitely find a market.
OH WOW! Something decent will come out of this sh*t movie sequel.
how long will this be?
This looks like Under the Dog but good.
This is the best news I've heard in a while
idk if the anime short version are good or bad, but if is good, i hope they make it into featrue film.
Been waiting for this since 1984 when I first got into anime, and Shinichirō Watanabe is directing! ^_^
This looks pretty awesome, and is immediately on top of my must-watch list.
I hope it's longer than 5 minutes.
hopefully this gets Subbed and sony doesn't fuck over everyone who doesn't know japanese who wants to watch it.
Warner Bros USA olease put the anime in the home video release
I love anything Watanabe related, it's gonna be amazing <3
I came. I saw. I came. What a lovely year for cyberpunk!
Forget this. We want Cowboy Bebop!

This is awesome news.

Oh yes
nice
製作時間…。_ﾛ(･ω･=) ｹｼｹｼ
WOW
ほほう
渡辺監督なら観ないと！
I wished we can Kickstart this for a whole mini-series.
Hope the movie does well so hopefully we get a full blade runner universe with books, games and other media.
why dont make an anime series with this quality????? WHY WHY!!! ;)
Coming soon... How soon is soon? And when it arrives, HOW DO WE WATCH IT?! ... legally, that is...  I have gotten to the point where I refuse to pirate stuff...  :D
私の中で神格化された作品だけに、その続編というのは複雑な心境だ。コケるくらいなら最初から作らないでほしいという気持ちもある。果たして上手くいくかどうか・・・頼むぜ。
Looks like another Ghost in the Shell movie. Look i like Anime, but Blade Runner shouldnt turn into Anime. The *Live* action movie is a Masterpiece, turning this into Anime is really mediocre, maybe the style and Visuals will be pretty and awesome, like Akira. But where does the Lore fit? They also ruined Godzilla with the mediocre, bad Cgi Grootzilla movie...
So a black dude and a fucking chick, just LIKE everything else these days... PASS!
gurrrrrlll!! you're trending what what
Please let me know if you were able to return everything for full refund
I enjoy watching you so much, you're just charming and delightful. Sending you best wishes sweet girl. :)
Why don't you fix the hole?
Credit carded... LMAO
Hahaha that backpack is hilarious!!! Your description reminded me of the time my husband bought a backpack for a trip  online.... He bought it thinking it was gonna have enough space (for the Amazon's) for clothes, food & stuff like that.... When the backpack got here it was SO small, the material was really cheap, & to top it off it had a jalapeno inside.... A JALAPENO!!! how? Why? It was weird, but hilarious!!! He looked like the hear from open season..... He DIDN'T RETURN IT he took the backpack to the trip... But I saw you with the backpack & couldn't stop laughing 😂😂😂😂 please return it, don't turn into my husband & keep something useless.... Fyi he still uses the backpack for work 🤔🤔
Kind of getting credit carded, Bahahaha that was hilarious!
Could you do a haul for wish! I always see cute things on there for super cheap but idk if it's worth it.
I hate things written on my chest. They need to pay me to advertise for tham
Please do wish next!!
I would love to see you try things from Wish. Please.
OMG a 3 legged doggy!! how precious!!!
Try Popoly next!!
No one wants to sleep on these stiff sheets THAT comment at the end had me laughing so hard that my kids woke up! 😂\nBut seriously, that dress would make such a cute Shirley Temple Halloween costume. All you need is the cutesy pin curls. 😁
In my opinion, the fit of everything except the blue collared shirt was off! You get what you pay for and it's too hit and miss for my time and money.
You say you were a mess...well girl I want to be a mess it looks as beautiful as you do. Loved this video. But then I love all your Videos
try Dresslily!
Help me!! 😂
5:30 just sew it
She reminds me of grav3yard girl tbh😂😂😂
Rainbow Brite represent!
Your video is Trending!!!
Я один русский?
Do Wish next!
We all have bad days but u look good
Girl!! You are making me nervous!! I just ordered this dupe of a ZARA dress. \nhttp://us.shein.com/Shirred-Waist-Dress-With-Liner-Slip-Dress-p-382633-cat-1727.html\nThis is only my second order from there. My first was only a bikini and it wasn't bad.
Where do you get your hair done???? I love it!
I'd be too worried that my card would be hacked on a site like that
Congrats your trending !! :)
that's cancelled hahaha :-)
Sad the out of your comfort zone dress had a hole in it! It looked so good!! Also, pirate pants!!! Yay!
Video starts @ 2:43
U look like Meghan reiks
Why is this trending
I wanted to order from here. But wasn't sure. Great review. Sorry can't be a lady. Lol
Can I please have you as my best friend? 😅  I love your videos ❤️
Seriously I was dying when you said stuff sheets and that dress didn't move! Bahahahahahahha
For these exact reasons, this is why I just don't order online. Between my chicken legs and lanky arms and the extremely long waits for disappointment, it's just not worth the hassle. Thank you for confirming my thought process! 💋
I ordered from the Shein site and there were a handful of items worth keeping, but I was not in love with any of them.  The sizing is too inconsistent and it is hard to tell if the item is made with quality material.  Considering the money I spent, and the fact that I only liked a small amount of the clothing, I decided it was not worth it and I won't be ordering anything from them.  I would rather go to the store, try things on and keep what I love.   With the Shein items, there was not anything I really loved and I felt like I just kept what was ok.
The fabric of the white dress is called tweed... or at least they were going for tweed-esque
I love your personality so much, you crack me up and give me good vibes 😊
yaasss trending on youtube
Kys thot
I haven't laughed this hard in so long. You are hilarious! I could agree with everything you were saying too, I kept talking back to you 😂😂😂 love your videos always 💕
I think they gingham dress looks good! Also, when you have to report comments because random people are hating #thatshowloveworks
I would recommend trying TOBY. My best friends love it, but I've only tried their formal wear. I'm mean 50% off (for your first purchase) a hot dress for New Years?? Yes pls
That's what happens when leather is bad
White tights under the white striped pants?  And it might help with the credit card issue haha
How can you return the Shein stuff really really quick if it's taken three and one half weeks to get to your house and you were then gone for two weeks?
Thank you for this!!
I love these videos because you're seriously providing a service🙌🏽 Also you're adorable and I love you but that Chanel dress gives me serious LambChop vibes 🤣 idk why!? #WhyAmILikeThis  great review! 💖
You should consider getting a belly piercing
Haha one size fits all is not a thing ok... Go to Asia everything is mostly one size fits all especially South Korea. Which sucks if you are size above US M
You are never a medium! Seriously there is nothing medium about you!! You are one of the thinnest girls I've seen! Very tall- yes.. but not a medium!
... You really expected high quality fabrics and pieces from a cheap site? (For example, the black and white checkered looking dress. Girl it was $14, stop trying to act like it should've been such high quality.)
Leighann, sugar, ya live in Houston.  Summer lasts till well into October, seriously!  (I get it, I do, I'm in Houston, too.)
Omg she is sooo fussy all the clothes look fine!!!
Girl you're on the Trending page - you go!!!!  Now more can see how amazing you are. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
leighann you need to check out the website shopcamp, its all your retro tshirt dreams come true ✨
I ordered a shirt from them over 5 weeks ago and shipping says its sitting in China. they gave me a $2 credit for how long its taking. So glad I only spent $9.
maybe the last dress could be made into a long shirt?
Keep the bigger items and wash them.  They might shrink 😊
Yeah that sweater would fit me like a bra lol looks really cute on you
I really like these kind of videos. That blue dress, the stiff sheet one, it was so stiff you could even hear how stiff it was, it was so noisy lol!
1. reorder the white dress 2. wear the pants with nude underwear and you won't notice 3. wear a belt with the shorts
Brandy Melville is a one-size fits all brand.
There is a site where everything is 5.99..you should try that..I found some good stuff
you are very cute.
I gotta get a card with a alias.. Can't trust the internet..
I can''t stand the one size fits all concept. Its incredibly misleading and its encouraging to see influencers who also don't see the point of it!
I'm out here thinking it's that lady from Scubs
Love these haul/testing videos!! <33 It would mean so much to me if you watched one of my videos!
You have such a calming presence. Can you just hug me all day?
Yay!!!!  Leighann trending!!  Y'all need in on this!!  Subscribe!!
I love the smell of paint, maybe not toxic but yeah
Am I the only one who gets irked by her complaints when she looks perfect and super fit in every single thing? Like I get it, I don't like alot of clothes either but that's because I'm pudgy and muffin tops happen no matter what
Inu inu is a scam lol the material is so low quality
You should do Cupshe. I see a lot of cute stuff on there but am too scared and picky to try it. I loved the rainbow dress on you! Too bad it was see through.
leighann you *are* a lady <3
Before I buy anything online I check if you did a Try-On.\nLove Your Videos!!
Her looking like a mess is better than myself after getting ready for two hours lmao
p.s. I don't know what the sites are off the top of my head, but i know there are a lot of scammy style bridesmaids dress sites. It might be cool to do a bridal themed style of this video
I love your hair!
All I can say is gawd that bawd!
never be guilty about gingham
I remember Rainbow Brite! She was totally WAAAAAY before my time.
Your dog.... melts... my heart 8:48
I would love to see you do a Wish haul but instead of clothing you could do beauty/makeup products and tools!
Please do missguided!!! They have such cute stuff but I'm so scared to buy from them bc I've heard not so great things :/ also I love these types of videos! 💖
Luckily for you anytime you're visiting LA you can bring your summer clothes because we only get fall until about 10am and then it's back to being sunny
If you wear an olive colored oversize cardigan with that blue and white button down shirt you love, it would totally pass for fall!
LOL I'm a kindergarten teacher 😂😂
I assumed your top was just following the pajama-inspired trend, didn't realize it was actual pajamas! So cute 💕
I love how you have a is this a scam? hairdo, lol.
I stay away from those sites. The best quality clothing site imo is ASOS.
Hi Leighann, I live in Maine so cozy sweaters are high on my list this time of year. Lightinthebox.com looks like they have what I have been looking for, but it seems scammy. Want to check it out?  😁
Please try Zaful next! It's a similar website but delivery takes about 1.5 to 2 weeks so not as bad!
Wow you look like that nun from American horror story (also Shein is a bad website I order clothes and they came 2 months later and they didn't even fit. I'm a small person but jeez it's not good)
Uggggh. Need strapless bra options for those with a large chest, but smaller chest diameter....32. Can't find any that stay put!
You'r so negative omg - I got a lot of stuff from shein and I love them all
as much as i want to enjoy this because this is quite good...i can't help but think to myself that this literally will be played on a loop at a store that sells $800 pairs of jeans in a suburb.
Oliver is hot as always, fucking hell ❤️I love him so much !!
Just heard this in the car on way home. Great track
I NEED THE SHELTER REMIX IN MY LIFE, PLEASE!
listening 2 this song my heart goes boom boom<3
Ah funny
It's strange seeing Oliver mouth the words to his sampled vocals in a music video, if ya know what I mean?
i want to see a jamie xx and flume collab it would so fucking awesome
More jamie with remix of xx
Why are you so good whyyyyyyy 😭
The first 2 min of the track reminds me so much of paul kalkbrenner feed your head , for some reason ..  both brilliant tracks ..
The xx - On Hold (Lit Version)
I have a serious problem....\n\nCan't stop listening to it!   ; )
when the original was the best shit ever, and now this is another step above
We want to see more of Romy!!!
beware of the church of scientology, it is an evil cult who want to ruin your life and steal your money, your life is at risk if you involve yourself with this organisation\nwatch this film for the truth about scientology\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6oYaMtJln0&t=73s
Reminiscent of The Mackenzie feat. Jessy - Innocence. But I don't expect Jamie to be aware of 90's Belgian dance music.
Incredible, it could be love
oh this. this is beautiful.
This was on radio 1 only way a find this song was by shazam , im glad a did
Loved it <3
You amaze me every time Jamie 😍
my type of music

With the new release of their new album and their Glastonbury set this year. The XX have been the soundtrack to my summer.
You're the fucking man Jamie.
I am obsessed.
Don't mind me, just here before this explodes! 😅
I love how basically all he did was use the ambience and bass of the original and its still sick
Thank you Jamie for all the music you make it honestly makes my day 100x better! I love you Jamie, Romy, And Oliver you guys are the best!
Listened to this during his boiler set, truly stunning! Check it out if you haven't already
Boiler Room Reykjavík :3

Terrific.
Video reminds me of the movie 'Momento'
Jamies style of music never ceases to amaze me. The main reason i stared to produce music of my own.
I'm so glad you released this!
He created a totally new song which is so good as the original one
I dream of a Smalltown boy remix
He obliterated the song? I mean it's a good mix, on its own, but why. 😫

Please leave a comment with a country you'd love me to film a food diary in! :) Also hit the like button for more at home food diary videos! xxx
just back from  a walk where i spent 10 minutes trying to get a snail off the middle of the road with a leaf so he wouldn't get crushed by a car... clicks on this vlog and sees you saying your gonna eat some 'fuckin snails' ... sigh. I wish humans would learn to have respect for other life forms on the planet, then maybe they wouldn't destroy the planet and all the living things on it as much.
i love this !! please do more of this, thank you !!! Do an Ireland i dont know what you eat , or italy !
I love your story booth
I bought your book today! Absolutely loving it so far <3 thank you for being lovely ☺️
UGH I MISS PARIS SO BADLY😭😭😩
loving your book so so much! i cried when it came in❤️😭 also your necklace is absolutely adorable! please come to the US.. more specifically Pittsburgh. i'd love to meet you, you've helped me get my life back mel! love always, no matter where you're off to next!!😘
This vlog was just pure joy to watch!! Thank you so very much for letting us have a glimpse of your trip!...the music, the architecture, the food, and that red dress you bought,...perfection!! So happy you had such a fantastic time! Next time, come to my neck of the woods...literally, the Pacific Northwest United States!
you seemed nervous to eat at times in this vlog, we are all routing for you. you are doing amazing. so so amazing. i am so so proud. that's the reality with EDs, sometimes they attempt to creep back in. whether this was intentional or something i'm just picking up on, it's made me realize that i actually eat like crap to punish myself, warped but oh well. i'm going to start eating better. thank you. you are an inspiration for all with EDs, especially the invisible ones. thank you.
Escargots are one of my favorite things to eat. SOOO tasty (all that herbed garlic butter). Glad to see another food diary from you, Melanie! I love your channel. And the little song about the French man with the baguette had me laughing out loud.
Does anyone know where that lovely corduroy mustard yellow coat is from?? I need it!!
i know you've probably already mentioned it at some point, but i honestly can't remember,, where is your yellow jacket from bc it's so !! nice !!
Cross the pond and visit Mexico! I'm sure you'll love our food and sights and all
So weird to see this video as I'm French but you gave a little something to Paris threw this vid! I think you'd love Toulouse! (If you come I'll be your personal guide ;)) <3 Love from France <3
I'm French, and I love your videos so much ! Je les adore ! It's a shame you didn't get to do a meet up here, because I live really close to Paris and I would have loved to get to talk to you even just a little bit ! You are a beautiful person inside and out, keep travelling and doing what you do best. As we say here in France, je t'embrasse. ❤
Food diary Friday in Paris, I'm in heaven! Italy would be another great place to Food diary in. Oh, and New York had awesome food. I'm still waiting for you and Jessie to do a sister trip there. ;D\nYour heeheeheeheehee at the dick bread killed me. lol\nOMG I've been craving a good hot chocolate for like 2 weeks. That sounds heavenly\nI love your new red dress and am loving the youtube singer support.
I love The Hunchback of Notre Dame too!
Love your videos great effort put into this keep doing what your doing girl 😍
Omg all those paris vibes make you actually Look like Amélie!!!
Girl i like your video. :)
Ohhh I loved this! Love the music you put in, the food, the insights, seeing the beautiful places ext! Great video xxx
Love the les mis music for the video! Glad to see the food diaries are back 😊
For super thick and ultra chocolatey hot chocolate, make it in a crock pot! Sounds odd but trust me on this one and give it a try.
Usually hate travel vlogs, but loved this! U actually shared the culture and were genuinly so excited and it really came through. Now I'm dying for a fricken chocolate croissant !!! Xxx
in your food diaries you eat a lot. do you eat that much just for the video or do you always eat that much in the course of a day?
Two of my favorite things. Melanie and France :)
with Your love of style and food a video in an italian city would be perfect
Using your video for inspiration on how to decorate my Year 9 French book haha\nLOVE YOU MEL, YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL XXXXX
That cover of stromae is wonderful!
Ahhh, seeing Notre Dame and hearing Lindsey Stirling's Les Mis medley made me legitimately emotional! I really want to go to Paris now!! (also i'm hormonal and sick so that's also not helping at all) I looked for your book in Easons Cork, and I couldn't find it! Probably good because I had told myself I was only allow buy the one book!
honestly just come to turkey and have some real food 😆😆
Id love to see this video in España! 🇪🇸
The best thing I've ever eaten in my life was a pistachio creme brulee in a little cafe outside the Louvre.\nI knew exactly what face you were going to make at 9:32 when you tasted that.\nIT'S SO GOOD! SO GOOD!
I had goosebumps the whole time I was watching this!
Oh Melanie if you ever come back to my lovely city of Paris, I'd like to meet you
Oh my god are you seriousssssss ?!?!? Mellll Nutella is Italiannnnn 😳\n(Sorry I literally live where they produce it so I just freaked out a little bit) \n❤️
You definitely have to come to India. The food here is mind-blowing
Your dad is always the best part of your videos. Has he ever considered starting his own YouTube channel? :)

What target audience  is your book geared towards . Looks beautiful there . What desserts r popular ? I say it again I love those yellow tight . I been inspired to find them here in Nashville . 💞😘
You should do a pub crawl in Ireland, and eat and drink and go through rules for tourists going to a bar (the dos and don't)!
you're the only person that's able to eat a peach and not look like a mess after 🙏🏼 love ya💗\nand nutella is italian i guess
I love that you used Lindsey Stirling in this. 😊
I feel so relaxed happy and also sad and rested but also feeling a calm restlessness. Beautiful vlog. There are many Pari vlogs, but this one is so different from those. Music helped the vlog a lot. Melanie you went up a notch with this one👌👌👌
Only 3 minutes in and this vlog is perfect
I can't wait until I get to move there 😢😢
Its been so many years since i was in paris. Would love to go back!
Paris looks gorgeous!! <3 & loved the red dress Melanie!\nIn case no one mentioned it yet, the first fruit you pointed out were prickly pears :D we get them lots in Malta!
I would love to go to Paris with you  next time 😁 And pls come to Norway and make a food vlog  😊
Your fringe looks like a lot like Amelie's when you were at the Café des 2 moulins... omg I really want to go there 😍
I got way too excited when you showed the Two Windmills. Amelie is my favorite movie.
Love all your dresses! I am so ready for that shape to come back into style cos my thighs aren't having this bodycon shit!
Such a nice video. I love France!
This gave me major Paris blues. It's my favourite place in the entire world! <3. I would love for you to do a food diary in Krakow, Poland xx
I love that Melanie says a little espresso, it's very cute. But actually that's the real size of an espresso in Italy, it's how it is supposed to be! Btw Nutella is Italian too.
I loved this and i really want to go to Paris!
Oh my god Melanie was literally talking about Dan Browns book and I was freaking out didn't know you like it Mel! I love it!! Ohh I am so excited rn😂
Aww I live in Paris, always have! You made me want to go back out there and explore with my tourist glasses on <3
My absolute favourite video of yours! The music, the filming, it was magical Melanie 💚
loving the stromae covers in this!! #toutlememe
all the french music i loveee it, also gonna go watch the hunchback of the Notre Damme now
Your outfit in this and hair remind me of Amelie !
You're so fit 😍 Wanna see you with black hair again.
Isn't it fun getting to the point where you can eat in moderation and have a good time!!!! 💘
What a great video! We got to see Paris with a Melanie voiceover. :)  Nice. BTW, the red dress looks great on you IMHO.
That was a freaking joy to watch!!! Thank you for that wonderful morning boost Melanie. I loved your editing too btw with the beautiful French music, and beautiful choices too, it was so well done!! :D xx
I just died at 13:01. You are so great xD
Ethical omnivorism:):):):) yet...you have no idea where your salmon etc came from! LOVE IT !!!! You're so logical and smart Melanie!!!!!
Loved this video!!! Made me want to go to Paris so bad, especially with someone as lovely as you Mel :)
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Disney movie, and it is CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED!  THANK YOU for loving it too!  I'm glad you had such a fun time!
Being a giant Les mis fan the music made this video so great!!! Loved it Mel, great video!!:) 😘
Hehehe, I joined in with your devious laugh at 6:46. You did a wonderful job putting this vlog together! The music, food, and everything else just complimented it so well. I also want to add that you looked unbelievably gorgeous in each dress. Seems like you had a great time!
OMG. When you laugh at the bread penis!! You are so cute hahahah! And the mini mini banane ^^
This video gave me butterflies in my stomach! I loved everything about it and you make me feel so calm and happy! Love you! xxxx
Missed the vlogs! Thanks Melanie

Ravie de savoir que Paris t'a plu.
ugh you're so lovely
Your voice 😍
Melanie, where is your coat from??! 💚
Where are your boots from? So pretty
Been using Uber for a couple of years. Has been nothing short of a pleasure for me as I often have to get to the hospital and to see physio therapists on my lunch breaks - was a huge convenience. I never had a bad driver - more often than not they were educated, polite and happy.  Not looking forward to retarded conversations in black cabs about why leavin' the EU woz a gud fing driving around at 15mph and choosing terrible routes watching the meter go up. \n\nSo what if cab drivers train for years and have knowledge of the road and points of interest? Move the fuck over, we have GPS, no one cares about your knowledge - Self service tills destroyed thousands of jobs in supermarkets and 3D printers will one day put manual labourers out of work - get over it. Shit happens. Everyone gets put out of work, from cleaners to medical statisticians. What is the alternative? An inferior service just because a bunch of drivers are crying about it? Shocking development, yet another reason why London is falling so far behind and is turning into a shit hole.
how is this number 1 on trending fuck off
Remember that time about 5 years ago when nobody had heard, nor cared about this cut-throat, greedy company? How on earth did we cope then? This is gonna be hard having to actually call up and book from a taxi office, like the old days.
The last comment is soooo true
It takes me 15 minutes to get to college from my house with uber but over 45 minutes on public transport surely the 30 minutes difference shows that public transport isn't all that depending on the place you live. Black cabs are just too expensive for us students so no. Uber is time efficient and generally a good service with great customer support!
don't really like going into taxis that much they sometimes try and rip you off by going the ''wrong'' way YET they  have a sat nav on display  to make more money i've had that twice . not to mention i've noticed prices hikes once it hits 4pm ( NOT a  uber user ) If anything i either get a bus,train or walk now mostly i walk since town to my house is not that far away ,
There's a thing called 'Legs' and apparently, you can use them to walk.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n8feXeuY-SI&feature=youtu.be\nHelp my mini you tuber wannabes get some views and make them smile 😁
Glad to see them go, they're a scourge, they actively try to destroy other companies who are honest, while using illegal software to keep their dirty secrets hidden from the law. Maybe in America where taxis in general haven't been pulling their weight, keeping clean and being good value for money Uber has its niche, but not in the UK where the hundreds of private taxi services which work hard, keep their vehicles clean and charge prices far below the council run services,
That last tweet by Lauren Powell proves she is not studing English as a student. 'Loosing' instead of losing.
Great news. About time ...
I always kind of thought that Uber and other ride sharing app driver's should just have to get a licence to drive passengers for pay. It was standard before. if you want to drive people for pay, then being qualified & also being tied to a government licence would be a lot safer and also in line with what cab drivers had to go through prior. Who knows if this will just make it unsafe for people unwilling to pay cab prices, but we will just have to wait and see.
Good goodbye don't come back TFL supports the taxis use that people £2.20 from your house cheep and accepts cards
Are they saying that Black cab drivers don't sexually assault people as well. I've seen lots of videos where the driver asks women to flash their tits & asks if they want to fuck. It seems to be the same driver as well, hope they catch him smh.
They'll appeal and the process will last months and then they'll probably win
from what I see with London traffic your better walking anyway
But Chaos is a ladder @ 0:42
Dont blame them london taxis are historic and apart of london culture ubers were threatening them staying around so im glad there gone london needs to stay historic
I'm glad they lost their licence. Stupid teens crying because they can only use a app to get a taxi. Morons
Poor white trashes getting drunk and throwing up on the streets during  the weekends. How are they going to get home now :(
Lol uber wasnt alowed to operate in our country but they still do lol and when a police officer suspects the driver and passenger they act like family
I can only say this...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOL
Uber had plenty of chances to conform and follow the rules that all other Private Hire companies follow, but they chose not to. The victims here are the Uber drivers and the culprit is the greed of Uber and TfL. TfL, from the start, allowed Uber to bypass laws that all other PH companies had to follow by law. Once the numbers of drivers started coming through, TfL saw Uber as a great way of raising money. 100% increase in PH drivers in 4 years? Really? Think about it. All the points that have led to the refusal of Uber's licence are things that other PH companies are doing as a matter of course. But really, TfL allowing Uber to use their own company to do DBS checks and then they are wrong ones? Uber convincing passengers that complaints should go to Uber first? Not TfL or the Police but Uber? Even sexual assaults. I honestly feel for their legitimate drivers but I'm sure that a lot of PH and Taxi drivers in Brighton and Welwyn Garden etc, where TfL licensed Uber drivers are illegally plying for hire and stealing their living, are glad to see them go.
Well, I did love using uber executive for fancy meetings and outings! but cmon you guys, there are other apps out there! mytaxi app is very efficient and you can choose a location+pay by card on the app! I honestly felt sad at the beginning but after knowing that uber wasn't safe made me feel much better!
because the drivers were given information on how to avoid the police or something
I do not want to walk after a long day!
London elected a Labour Muslim Mayor pandering to the Unions, what does anyone expect!
Uber ..go away and stay away ..even in the attacks of terrorism..you charged terrified people money..And reading about sexual assaults in your cab service..I dont want my family or friends using your service  !
Wait, you fuckwits live in London take the tube and walk
The impact for many disabled people is going to be bad. Much of London is a no-go area for some disabilities. The pitiful options we have in London affects our work, our social life, our health, accessing medical treatment and many things others take for granted.
we all know why don't we..wake up!
Uber made taxi services safer and more competitive, while offering a more functional way of working for its drivers. Drivers were essentially their own bosses who could use their own cars and keep getting quick work. This ban is fucking stupid, especially because it puts 40,000 people out of work, reduces overall convenience for consumers, intentionally takes away a lot of potential tax revenue and forces people to use extortionate black cabs. Sadiq Khan, as a Labour MP and Mayor of London, should be ashamed for not only not protecting workers, which is a major selling point of Labour, but for interfering when a competitive business was rightfully blowing everyone else out of the water. I don't agree with how the company operates and I really loathe the fact that there is rampant harassment in the company, this is truly regrettable, however, to straight-up punish many, many people is shameful and ultimately, shitty.
Fuck uber and the hipsters that use it 😄😄😄
Ha ha well it's definitely over for Uber.
LicenCe, thank you. We are ENGLISH, we dictate the proper spelling of our words.
You just can't get the staff these days. Apparently they've banned child chimney sweeps so it'll cost a fortune keeping my Aga stove going now. I hope we will at least be able to keep the Polish cook and the Bulgarian nanny after Brexit.
Good. Fuck uber!! Support the REAL taxi drivers.
MeccaMotors........Shokrun over children  or Bukkra cars cause tomorrow never comes.
Fuck uber if your poor use private hire if your working get the odd black cab fuck the driving down of the living standard in the name of centralised profit.
What the fuck are they fucking joking?!?! This pisses me off
The majority of their drivers were dangerous brain dead idiots, good riddance to a collective of aresehole's.  Bet Addison Lee are over the moon
no, because London is controlled by phantom public servants
Uber is a doggy company don’t even pay tax properly so fuck uber
Oh well. What can you do
Where are London women how want to get raped going to get a cab now?????
Except introduction Israeli museum widespread winter able.
You have tubes that get nearly everywhere you lazy lot. Bet you dont live 10 minute walk from a tube. pretty sure the world turned ok before uber.
how will my young, and dumb millennial brain ever work again!!!
well done uber go back to America this is UK
Great news, why should uber drivers get away without going through the same safety checks, background checks and stopped from rouge drivers from ripping off passengers by taking long routes to a destination.  .  This is not about stopping competition, but protecting the paying public from unlicensed,  and or dangerous cars or even dangerous people.  Uber's own checks don't go far enough, so whist the majority of drivers for uber are great people. The law should be changed so pre book or on demand follow the same driver code of practice
I honestly don't see what the problem is here
Who cares it's uber it's so bad
Uber have been nothing but trouble in Manchester.
All those people saying this is stupid and UBER is rubbish I agree but do you not realize this is the Government shutting down a firm where there is no need to pay licence fees..... Government were losing money - simple
Use an addison lee then
I’m subbing to everyone that subscribes to me, likes this comment and comments done Interbants
never had anything but good service with uber in london,, id never get a black cab in london or oxford ,,its time we had white cabs
In the words of Nelson, HA-HA!
This shit is like taking an AK from a Russian
I hate Uber. Good news at last...
Well the Tube is just going to have to get busier.
I'm not rascist, I hate you all equally.
London is a shithole
Uber is Dutch registered doesn't realy pay much tax that's why that dick Khan doesn't like uber if you want to start throwing muck then wee should look no further than home cause  the uk is stinking of it
London is just fucked up piece of shit.
Jesus Christ is coming soon, so get saved RIGHT NOW

Yet unregulated, unsafe Rickshaws ridden by complete illegals remains in London. Seems legit!
Why don't you show other tweets from both sides instead of won, you morons. One tweet I remember stood out above the rest Uber lowers their prices so they can rid the industry of competition thus creating a monopoly. This is  malpractice and immoral. The word monopoly is a big clue as to why uber sucks balls
Londoners need to worry more about being killed by terrorists and less about uber. Get your priorities straight people.
The gap between rich and poor is widening and more people are living below the breadline. If this is what it takes to force them to pay a living wage, so be it. I & my contemporaries had to survive with the cost of sharing cab fairs/not using cabs when at university and that was only 15 years ago. Didn't do any of us any harm. Workers rights protections are there for a reason.
loosing UBER is a good thing. it should be UK wide!! UBER dont even do their checks that they supposed to do. they might be handy for picking up your daughter on a late night. but they probably rape her first. the reason the REAL taxis charge more is down to the local authorities. taxi drivers have no control over the fares as they are set. also, you get what you pay for. a good, legal, trustworthy, safe, knowledgeable cab driver that has done extensive knowledge tests and checks to get their license. UBER dont do medicals, they dont do the criminal records checks neither. they need taking out of the UK
Black cabs belong in the dark ages. Make way for Uber and the like that are reliable, cheaper and better.
Fuck Uber ...Good riddance  ..\nHello . Rapist cabs . How many immigrants do you want to assault you tonight .
i am pleased its very good news for black cab drivers .
Good riddance Uber - never used you - because of your reputation for being.... crap.
im happy its had its liecence taken, students are assholes anyway
Finally, this company has finally stopped doing things in London. Such as they might be scammers\naswell. Which makes\nme happy because the Uber drivers aren’t trained to speak other languages aswell.

Chis im Portuguese like Ronaldo and i will translate you what he said in the final ... He said you goal was a good goal just that XD
Where's the mercurial\nGoal is 3 my friend
He doesn't know you make fun of him and call him Penaldo.... lol just kidding congrats
This only has this many view because of Ronaldo name is in it
Captions on at 2:14 and 2:19 😂😂
You really are a faggot.
I've met him 2, on my screen
Wow men you have 8.5 Holly fuck
He seems like a great guy
Not try to be rude but im messi fan but cr7 hes okay kinda
I thought it was a clickbait* but surprised muthafucka😂😂 good job chris
Does Messi have his own fragrance?\n\nI THINK NOT!
Man it’s my dream to meet Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi
Am I the only one noticing that he was wearing adidas socks but he sponsors Nike😂😂
i thought it was clickbait
U get Ronaldo and you watch YOUR soccer vids 😂😂
I'm not a Really Big Ronaldo Fan but Damn he seems so humble
4:30 Thor the dark world soundtrack 😂😂😂
I thought he was going to show the clip of his penalty
As if you can make a football challenge video with him!!!
How the fuck he meet him so easily?
If you score its 3 😂
I thought this was fake
“Where’s the mercurial?”
He met Ronaldo,sanchez,bellerin god knows who his gonna meet next nice work Chris u absolutely g keep it up
sub to my channel I made a song about being horny
You are the luckiest guy in the world
Why are you all like omg I'd be speechless Wtf he's a normal person being he has problems like us and trials like us and good moments like us he has talent so it would be cool to meet him but srsly give him some space
When u have Ronald in a yt vid u know its an instant #1 trend
It’s a amazing chris good video 👍🏻❤️⚽️
Wow you actually met him
Should've bought new mercurials to have him sign.
Seems like a good bloke in person and where is the mercurials haha

Chris is best utuber ever thx chris for amazing vids!!!!!!!!!
Too bad soccer isn't an actual sport...
I thought this is gonna be clickbait
You always seem to amaze us chris
I am portguese, when ronaldo talk in portguese he said you are a great guy
all the clips were sheit
You deserve to meet him with your great success
Ele é fixe o gajo LOL that mean that dude is cool 
Chrissy ma boy cmon man hes the greatest sports star of this generation ask him more questions instead of trying to look for approval off him I mean I get it but you can learn so much more like how he handles the pressure mentality how does he consistently perform  over and over does he envision everything he is doing before he does etc...also your title needs to be Chris meets Cris-tiano ronaldo
He really seems like a genuinely nice bloke
U made him look like hes 6'6 but hes only 6'1
Sub  to my channel for more vids and daily videos
The fuck calfreezy doing in this video
Tell Ronaldo to go fuck himself
I would pee in my pants jesus
At the end he told his entourage in Portuguese this guy was cool, actually congrats bro
Ronaldo rocks, you suck at talking to the worlds best player lol

Lol to the people who don't get why tom has someone's watch, if you were a good enough fan you would of watched his vlogs from months ago and not when its most trending to realise he met someone called ron who he is now good friends with, Ron likes watches and has been taking this one watch which tom has around the world and he gave it to tom because tom keeps going to  different locations or city's around the world, once tom feels like he has took the watch around the world he will return the watch back to ron

Comment deleting prick
WHERE THE FUCK IS ALEXISSSS
Omg tom your where at Birmingham my city ☺
a lot of you aren't women who have got in ubers by themselves
Totally crazy to restrict consumers choice. If Uber is 'Unfit' then shouldn't 'Black Cabs' also be 'Unfit' to run a taxi service????? They make it sound there are no rape cases with black cab drivers when in fact on average is reported at least twice a month for sexual assaults. There are a lot of rape cases with black cabs so how on earth are they 'fit' to run a service and not Uber? Do they mean Uber has not been extended it's license because black cabs are 'Threatened' by an innovative business? I've had such bad experiences with Black Cab drivers, it is beyond unacceptable. In fact, I will find the video to post it on youtube as I recorded this on video- a black cab driver almost hit me & my bf, then he puts the window down to shout and swear at us, then he got out of his car to punch my bf just because he shouted back how unfitly the driver was driving. And there are many more stories to tell.. So are black cabs really 'Safe & Fit' to provide a service??? Some people cannot afford to use a black cab. And ever since Uber's existence, women feel safer to go out in the evenings because they know they can get home using uber as is much more affordable for everyone in London. If there is no Uber, I'm sure there will be more rape cases in the streets of London... Thanks to the selfishness and profit driven black cab shitty services who's been constantly protesting to take Uber down
Uber will do something, they can't just let UK money go..
I want to know how many Uber drivers have been involved in sex attacks. Where are the figures? They must be bad.
Let the public decide whether Uber is a responsible corporation not tfl who coincidentally will make more money from this...
What does this mean then... can we not use uber in london anymore
The “ we are iconic” argument does not wash either. Red telephone boxes were iconic too but with the advance of technology they had to be taken off the streets. \n\nRegarding the environment, all the Uber cars I have been in were hybrid, new and clean. Black cabs I have been in have been the old dirty diesel engines. I thought Sadiq Khan was hot on the environment and emissions?\n\nRegarding money, black cabs for years refused to take cards but thanks to Uber, they’ve realised they need to step up and embrace modern practices.
Yes. London, courageous move.\nShut them down. Not good for anybody. Except Uber.\nNasty company.
Get a bus pass you bunch of moaners.
Interesting like to dislike ratio.🤔
Not a fan of Uber.  Drivers are so bad at driving often dangerous. Cars in poor condition. Prob not the case for everyone iam sure. I do believe they should have the same training as a black cab. But the black cab prices needs to be regulated. Iam sure TFL needs to work on running the Tube 24 hours giving the black cab more competition.
The Mayor of London has a memory problem.\nJohn Worboys known as the Black Cab Rapist attacked almost 100 women over several years right under the noses of the police and the Black Cab Drivers Association
Don't worry everyone it's only London!.......the rest of Britain don't give a fuck about them!
UK is becoming a joke, London doesn't have 24/7 public transport and now they remove the only affordable choice for night transport.
THANK FUCK. literally a terrorist could be an Uber driver.
Im glad for the black cab drivers
Why are people loosing it? Can’t you just call another taxi?
How much is the bribe ? How much did the local taxi company pay the city to kill their competitor ?
TfL Just wants money that’s y
I guess more nights where I have to wait till 5 in the morning to catch a train home
Why the fuck is this even news? Or it affects the centre of the known universe, my mistake. Londonistan the shit stain on the rest of England.
It's so shit there's a body above the average person that can make decisions like this, if people chose to use the service because they like and trust it, it should be left alone. Just as much dogy shit would go on in a taxi, it's just because Uber is new and taking money out of other areas they want any reason to shut it down. Uber has been the first demonstration in a long time of a service mad for us, the everyday person, and to see it being removed is going to be a massive step backwards for the future of technology.
the sexual assaults are a muslim problem not an uber problem, i've taken a lot of ubers and only ever had two non muslim drivers who were very nice. the rest are creepy shady fucks with poor english and terrible manners
My guess is black cabs, taxis and after transports in London are feeling threatened by Uber and they're trying to find a way to shut them down.
Don't worry another similar  mob will step in to satisfy the penny pinchers.
Looks like we'll see more faketaxi videos on hub...
government double standards?  say it ain't so!
Please can someone start a counter-petition so that London can be rid of this Uber scum forever!
Tech firm at top, lots of money, small people at bottom looking for scraps.
what the f*ck I live in the UK and I heard about this
Uber had plenty of chances to conform and follow the rules that all other Private Hire companies follow, but they chose not to. The victims here are the Uber drivers and the culprit is the greed of Uber and TfL. TfL, from the start, allowed Uber to bypass laws that all other PH companies had to follow by law. Once the numbers of drivers started coming through, TfL saw Uber as a great way of raising money. 100% increase in PH drivers in 4 years? Really? Think about it. All the points that have led to the refusal of Uber's licence are things that other PH companies are doing as a matter of course. But really, TfL allowing Uber to use their own company to do DBS checks and then they are wrong ones? Uber convincing passengers that complaints should go to Uber first? Not TfL or the Police but Uber? Even sexual assaults. I honestly feel for their legitimate drivers but I'm sure that a lot of PH and Taxi drivers in Brighton and Welwyn Garden etc, where TfL licensed Uber drivers are illegally plying for hire and stealing their living, are glad to see them go.
This is conspiracy,Uber try to avoid responsibility,they had four mounts to resolve the problem with TfL,and they didn't find any solution because this is theatre ,even they don't prepare the drivers about this because are irresponsible and they must be convicted to pay conpesations to all this people
How can they justify the government putting all these drivers out of a job and somehow frame it like it is Ubers fault.  Ubers drivers should understand the risks of going into debt when you buy a new vehicle and that there are safety concerns over picking up strangers.
Most mainstream networks are not mentioning the mass amounts of sexual assaults by foreign drivers..why???
The rise and fall of uber. Only the beginning
Imagine you came from a country called by these people as communist and found that you enjoy a far more liberated market back in China.
The last time I got a black cab in London the first 3 I flagged down refused to take me South of the Thames I got one eventually utter shite...
Uber was good for low fair travel, given how overpriced and exploitive to customers the black cabs are, but anyone who denies that uber was an irresponsible corporation is retarded. \n\nYou could have had a convicted paedophile driving you and your child somewhere, with no prior background checks to their criminal activity. Legislation exists for a reason and the second corporations start thinking they have diplomatic immunity is the second corporations start to become abusive. \n\nIf London needs a low cost taxi business, perhaps someone should be innovative enough start one, now that there is a very clear opportunity. \n\nJust saying...
It happened because foreign drivers were sexually assaulting people. Enjoy your diversity Londonistan.
Black cabbies will be relieved and booking a new cruise.
Jesus Christ is coming soon, so get saved RIGHT NOW
If you ask a uber driver about anything they know nothing, I'm not from London but from UK , and have  travelled through the world and lived abroad for years.  The black cabs in London are the vest in the world .
Just take the tube
Not a single black guy in this video. Racist!
Damn, the chat on here seems really racist. I wasn't expecting that on the BBC channel
i never used uber.. or black cabs. we have a local taxi service line near my borough so it's never been a problem but not sure how to feel abt this anyway.. feels like tfl is just trying to get more money out of people :/
TFL states UBER are not fit to hold a operators licence, When has TFL been fit to operate at all.
Is the same happening to all cities in the UK?
The amount of people now unemployed in London, congratulations TfL, congratulations...
The decision was made from the black cab lobby. It's all political. Every mayor of London has looked after black cabs.
Hopefully, London taxi companies, will make the most out of this second chance, and do things the right way.
sexual assaults by Uber drivers who would of guessed that!..good idea fucked up by the minority AGAIN.
Can i still use über eats
no more use my code for free £15 uber ride from youtubers lmao
BBC are dying to call this a racist decision.
Nothing gets me more erect than 40,000 people losing their jobs over stupid shit
Such a British way of telling them to fuck off 😂 not proper enough 😂 love it
the SAME people who are clapping and happy for these uber driver to get laid off are gonna complain about them taking benefits.
Once again UK prove to the world we have best justice system God bless UK
Is Uber different in UK than in US?  On my app, I can see the driver that I am getting and I have ridden with the same driver when I wanted to.  I felt completely safe.  Sure it was a little more expensive, but my route requirements were a little bit more demanding!  I was glad to pay more!  I like companies like Uber that shake up old, entrenched business interests.  We need more competition in the world.  Not less!  If people are being attacked in Uber rides, then maybe the police haven't yet done their job properly.  I immediately know if I want to be around someone.  Why would you get in a ride that you weren't sure about?  I can't believe people are that helpless, that they need a super-duper-certified official cab service.  Uber needs to add a ride-alone or ride-with others rate option, to give users more control over their experience.  These regulations are non-sense.  Problems can be solved with logic and systems, not pronouncements from some official.
1 month ago, they nearly lost their services where in the Philippines. Uber company is getting a lot shittier recently
Good news! Taxis getting their rights back. Uber just doesn't make sense to me and London has become alien to the rest of the UK, Uber being a big part of that. Normality will return!
Black london taxi any day you have a good old chin wag with the good  old cockney gezzers and  understand what they are saying how have uber drivers got the taxi when they cant speak the  lingo
Taxis are like cassettes players they're old and nobody uses them.
I had no idea they even operated in the UK, I've always just called a cab
How can uber be unsafe when you can check the name of the driver and what his rating is on your phone? This is a blatant attempt to make more profit for black cabs.
Black cab drivers are greedy charging ludicrous money . I take uber everyday to work .
I use uber almost everyweek and I have never come across a rude driver nor had any problem with the company. TFL regulators probably dont use the uber service which renders them totally biased.
One blow against globalist interests.  Hopefully more will follow.  BREXIT NOW.
Hummm  all of those cars that have been hired wonder what will happen with those contracts? And if the cars do get returned thats about 20000 cars in hire companies lots that will mostly go unused? More people will end up claiming unemloyment benifits.....lots of knock on effects
This is great uber advertising
To all the people complaining that they can't order Black Cabs from their phone, monitor their drivers location and see before hand how much the journey will cost them, like Uber, download Hailo - https://uk.mytaxi.com/hailo - or Gett - https://gett.com/uk/
We do respect our law in London and we won’t change for no one so fuck off uber!!!
Muitos Brasileiros vai ficar desempregados !

Fuck Sadiq khan
Good news👌, fuck uber 🖕!!!
God bless BBC. Long lives.
What about uber eats.
Nooooo
violation
Fuck the free market amirite?
good tax dodging uber
Guys, grave Anyone   watch larger  this teswlt ?
Screw uber
Purely political, someone got their pockets lined
тoo вad.
So what about uber eats?
I think Uber is one of the most safest transport services in London because you get the drivers name, picture, license plate number AND you get to share trips with your friends. This is just another ploy for TFL to get more money out of us... leaving 40 THOUSAND people jobless and us Londoners paying more money just to get around an already expensive city.
I think Uber is the best and cheaper than others black cabs .uber need to stay in the UK . Especially is safe for Young people uber is the best.
Brexit Uber. Just shows England is winning the war against terrorism. Great decision!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏
How the fuck did a video talking about über turn into muslims and how they should be exterminated??? \nBloody hell..
Black cab all the way bro
Three reasons why I would watch this\n1. dogs\n2. dogs\n3. dogs
Watched this 50 times I bet. The drum beats are so great
Isle of dogs is a place in London...
They look like the dogs from Fantastic Mr. Fox
Reminds me a little bit of Fantastic Mr. Fox
Lol chief is prob spot but covered in dirt
See what quran tells muslims search quran eng translation 😁
It’s either rated pg or rated r. Nothing on between
I would be interested if it was a cartoon, not this freaky ass animated shit.
Ayyyee I was hoping Mr. Fox wouldn't be Wes Anderson's only stop motion outing
So now we're making fun of Japan?
Can I have people just like and comment on my comment for no reason at all
finally, something original in theatres.
When you say Isle of Dogs it sounds like I love dogs.
Im the only one who find this kind of animation very creepy?
Wes Anderson is truly one of a kind!
You bullshitin me if you say this isn’t done by the same guys as fantastic mr Fox
Why are they speaking English though if it's in Asia?
YES WES ANDERSON RETURNS\nTHE PRODIGAL SON.
I heard Edward norton’s voice
This is giving me a fantastic Mr fox vibe
song name? 1:08 if someone says darede sandstorm i'm going to be pissed
I can't wait for his next film where two cupcakes talk to each other about life as a cupcake and they communicate only via body language so subtle that they appear to not be moving at all.
I loved fantastic mr. Fox as a kid, going to love this too moat likely
I love these kinds of movies😂
I'm so here for this omg
What did I just watch lol... did someone on acid make this movie lol
Its not planet of apes darn it
Its kinda weird yet im very willing to watch this movie
Is this like stop motion animation
i'm watching this
Looks like a extremely long fallout 2 cutscene. I LOVE IT
Too many details, you have to stop each frame to watch... wow.
Fantastic Fox on a Budget
Never seen a movie in this style, but i'm looking forward to seeing this.
I’m never gonna watch this because there is for sure at lest two dog deaths in it
My God this is so weird
This will be really particular!
I WANT TO WATCH THIS NOW! It looks so creative!!
Isle of dogs sounds like I love dogs. Not sure if intentional
Yeah, I'll watch it. One reason because average Hollywood has gone to shit lately.
FANTASIC MR. FOX CREATORS HAS BLESSED US AGAIN
Watching this cuz the art style is Fantastic Mr.Fox and dat was a good movie, so I'm hoping this will be a gem to
#♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥\n*God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n (Just ask Him)
Holy Jesus! Finally a Movie i'm looking forward for!
Favorite director & favorite thing on this planet ( dogs, not 12 yr old boys) . This is already my favorite film based on this most excellent preview 😄
After kubo and the two strings this looks visually great
This screams Wes Anderson and I love it
This looks amazing! The trailer is five paws out of five paws 😊. Can't wait to see it. It seems like it was from the people who made fantastic mr.fox and it is one of my fave movies so I can't wait.
The dogs' art styles remind me of the movie fantastic mr.fox (I just realised someone else commented this lol)
Omg it's a Wes Anderson movie?!
Wouldn't want your meal to get you sick after all
This same guy who made fantastic mr fox?
I love his films but this one looks like shit, I realy hope I'm prooved wrong and it's amazing.
wes anderson is back on his bullshit and so am i
The stop-motion is on full effect now!
I wish somebody spoke his language, makes me grin every time XD
Is this the same people who made 'fantastic mr fox'? I can tell by the art style.
I really hope Wes Anderson doesn't utilize his usual pet animals casualty story trope.
Wes Anderson....why am I not surprised.... This will be good.
This would have been far more interesting and lengthy if it were Isle of Turtles
Who else can’t stop watching this?
I don't understand stop motion movies it looks like something from the dark web
Oh hey look, it's Fantastic Mr. Dog
This reminds me of a movie about a certain fox and his friends stealing food and cider from factory warehouses...
Don't ditch this amazing movie like you ditched the Popeye movie for the emoji movie.
sathi
stop doing these dogs a bamboozle
SCREECH
Fantastic Mr.Fox vibes 😂
That looks AWESOME
ISLE OF FLIGHTLESS BIRDS
better than IT
I knew it looked familiar.... fuckin fantastic mr.fox
My heart is exploding.
IM SO EXCITED
Fantastic mr fox?
OOOKJAAAAA
Good trailer
Weird...
Made In China

Looks pretty bad sorry
Fantastic Mr.Fox anyone?
0:18 LOL @ the cats!
Aww thank you for mentioning my vlogs 😘 Im so glad you like them!! 💗
omg your cats are to die for so flipping cute I love your videos
Girl I relate to you so much !\nMary Poppins and Pocahontas are my absolute 2 favourites ! I already own the Pocahontas Pop, now I want Mary Poppins.\nLove from France
U should do some videos where you recreate some of those foods you like. Like the tomato and basil soup. See if you can find some recipes online and try to make it yourself. U can then tell us if it's a dupe or the recipe is a fail
I hope you’re feeling better xx love you lots xx
NO HATE but that bookcase looks like IKEA for 20 bucks
Gabby ,honney ,calcium from the cream dont let iron to digest .i dont try to down you but wish you all best.soo i think you should eat your spinach other way,,💟
Does anyone else have a marathon of Gabbie's videos to make themselves better? I know I do💗
Gabbie where is your grey jumper from half way through? Looks amazing xx
Gabs, I eat spinach with every meal and its so easy. If you chuck it in an omelette, a smoothie, soup, pasta you can't really taste it and it's a good way of getting extra iron. Just a tip :)
I didn't know how much I loved cats until I seen Nelson😂☹️
Erm why did you shove your kitten into a tiny bathroom that has a wonky floor and looks like it'd be freezing? I mean I know you want to get rid of him but have some compassion, imagine what it'll be like in Winter?
#yiaybasic writing a comment about how Starbucks is basic
OMG so glad its not the only one who has a kitten that likes to pee on everything I have two cats and beauty will always use the litter tray but belle likes to pee on everything else 😣 xx
I just sat through a 3 min ad before the video started .. your welcome gabs
Hi Gabbie! I'm so sorry you're not feeling ok. I had the same problems after my surgery and i've found my way with pills and super foods. I've found some books on amazon and found the right amount of everything i was missing on my diet!  I hope you can solve soon all this problems and came back healthier than ever!Wish you the best and sending you big hugs!Take care ❤\nRobby
Where are the Funko Pops from? 😍😍
Absolutely love your vlogs gab ❤️ Is Jeremy still going by Jeremy or is he now bean? 😂❤️
Gabbie I'm loving the dark lip and winged eyeliner. I Can't, stunning!😍😍
Do you have mono? Saw Hannah is recovering from it and similar symptoms. It makes you very very tired and lasts a long time.
When I heard Conan gray in the background I was shook
I thought you were plant based? I haven't been watching for ages so im probably just behind
Love this vlog Gab!! Hope you are doing okay now! Just wondering is Bean staying with you? Love you! Xx
I really like your pale complexion too, looks very elegant. I think your really pulling it of!
Tbh I don’t think funkopop are childish because they’re not really toys, they like collective things..(lol) so it’s more likely that older people are gonna buy them to collect them right?🤷🏼‍♀️😂
My husband stepped on my ghd's, needless to say they no longer work. This has just reminded me how much I miss them. 😩😭
Omg Nellie's stress eye 😭 I've never related to a cat so much 😂
I'm so glad you're getting sorted! B12 deficiency is horrible 😢 I couldn't even hold a knife and fork at one point.  The injections are so good though, they make me feel human again 😂 Hope they sort you out, and that you feel back to your old self soon! ☺ Xx
My cat gets stressed like that, she used to lick parts of her fur off her back, you can get a plug in from the vets that releases this calming smell and it stops them from getting so stressed, we did that with my cat, Mouse and it just calms them down and it's really good.
Where is your grey jumper from?? Hope you feel better soon Gabs 💗
I had SUPER bad anaemia at university my haemoglobin was 4.6 and I had to have 2 blood transfusions. It came back again this year, but with iron tablets I can keep it under control really well. I know exactly how you feel it is absolutely EXHAUSTING :( just walking up some stairs is like running a marathon. Big love xx
Babe you might have pernicious anaemia - that's exactly how I was! regular b12 jabs helps I have mine every 8-10 weeks but still suffer! thinking of you :( xxx
I have the same toothbrush as you ☺️
You could try adding some more spinach to the creamy one. It shouldn't change the taste too much, but it'd add some more nutrients :)
Might be daft but have you been tested for coeliac because I felt exactly the same as you, had anaemia and was deficient  in folic acid before I found out i was coeliac. Hope you get better soon X
Gabsss, how much was the fluffy poof? I need that in my lifeeeeeee 😍😍😍
When I was little my Mam used to make mash with spinach and cheese blended in, was the only way we’d eat it 😂
Gabbie can you do a makeup look whilst using and reviewing the iconic brushes 💓
I may be completely wrong but I seem to remember you saying you hated the taste of nutritional yeast? Do you think maybe you could sneak it into your soup or in your creamed spinach or do you think you would still taste it? The only other b12 I get in is from Koko milk, I don't know if you like coconut milk but its the least coconut milk tasting one i've had - very close to real milk nothingness if you know what I mean. If I discover anything else I'll keep you in mind. Sorry your feeling so awful! You look like you need a nice girly sleepover and a Disney marathon!
How much was the pink poof chair? Xxx
I want to try that pumpkin body cream I'm not into pumpkin scenting or flavoured things either so if you like it I'm excited to try it cx
i couldn't get through a week without a vlog from Gabi❤️
Sending you lots of love❤️
Gabby, could you do a giveaway of things that you no longer use like the brushes. I'm sure we would all appreciate any form of makeup or brushes that you no longer use! Love you btw 💕
Best vlogs on YouTube Gabbie, I hope you're ok😃😂😂❤️🌍🤸‍♀️🏃‍♀️🚴🏻🤾‍♀️💗❤️xx
I would really love support for my YouTube channel because my aim is to help people feel less insecure about themselves! I have a birthmark on my face and I want to show others that they shouldn't feel insecure about it! xx I hope you can check it out 💖💖 it would mean so much to me❤️❤️
I love her vlogs more than any others x
I got three adverts during this 🙈🙈
I'm so happy that you've been to the doctor and found out what's wrong. Hope you're okay
Hope your okay now ❤ I love you ❤
Hope you're ok💗💗X
Fingers crossed about your blood tests, I had a B12 deficiency and it was so horrible. Blurred vision, headaches, so so tired. Sorted with a B12 boost and now I supplement. Good luck!! Xx
I'm loving your glasses at the moment where are they from!??! X
its a horrible feeling having so little energy and always feeling so weak! i went and had blood tests and turned out i had virtually no iron and b12 in my body and now have to have 3 shots a week and take iron tablets xx
Can I come round to steal your cats? 😩😍
I can tell that there’s something not right with me because if I was that tired and ill, the first thing I’d think of is cancer and I’d be so depressed and worried
I love it when you're pale gabs 💕
Before the update I thought you might of had a vitamin D problem, because my Mum had one last year and she had the same symptoms. Xxxx I hope you get better Gabbe. Xxx Love ❤️ you. Xxxx
I watched this in between going out and getting a McDonald's soy hot chocolate, haha. 😉 I can relate to the low anaemia levels and feeling awful with severe tiredness and headaches at times. That time of month is especially terrible for me but the symptoms can vary from day to day regardless. *hugs* awesome vlog as always 🤗❤🐱
I love love love love how your makeup looked on the 17!!! I hope you feel better soon gabs!! Love ya💛💛
Hope you're feeling better! Where is your purse from? Loves it!
why you are feeling poorly is because you lack B12 in your system due to the fact that you don't eat meat and you miss out on the protein that you need. <3
You're so close to 1 million subscribers!!!! woo hoo!!
'My hair is..... fashion week' omg me
I'm glad thry got you sorted hope you get the medical help you need sweetie
Oh my Gosh! I've just started yoga this month and I'm watching the same channel & loving it!!! How amazing!? So glad you've found something you're up for, I don't have the energy for other sorts of exercise either, and my cardiologist told me not to do any real exercise as I have a heart problem, but yoga seems to be working and helps a bit with my anxiety as well!
try adding spinach to smoothies if you still make them! if you had enough sweet fruit like banana you can't taste it!
What lipstick are you wearing on Wednesday? It's gorgeous dark color!
Did they test for mono? Being tired/exhausted all the time is one of the main symptoms.
What lipstick is that? I've been looking for a colour like that for ages. I like those dark reds. They often pull too much more plumy than I've been wanting!
everytime you film nelly, i cry cos i miss my cat!! his name was benson and he was the love of my life and he was ginger too x
Obviously anaemia is so hard I have it myself and it's awful. But once it settles down why don't you just get a little job I know you don't really need them income but just for the routine and making friends etc it will help your mental health loads and this isn't a dig I just wanna try and help xxx
Hi Gabs, in my country they sell creamed spinach by Iglo made with alpro soy milk. It is heaven! Maybe they sell it too in the UK? It's in the freezer at the store.
UMMM I DIED WHEN I HEARD GROW MY FAVS SUPPORTING EACH OTHER YAS
Gabbie I have chronic fatigue syndrome or ME and I feel like you do! Ask your GP about it?xx
I feel like your main channel is just now basically a Vlog channel but I do love your Vlogs so it's like not that bad
I HEARD THAT SNIPPET OF CONAN'S NEW SONG 😍
i love your vlog's, they're so relaxing to me
Hi gabby, my mum has b12 deficiencies and she's a lot like you she gets extremely tired, try not to stress yourself out 💕 it will be okay
Currently watching this with my Kitties, Luna & Sophie. Luna has the same issue as Jeremy, but we found out from the vet that she has bladder stones from anxiety (I started back at Uni and its stressing her out) they put her on special food that helps calm her down, All my cats love it :) xoxo Victoria
Oh my god, one of my cats gets a stress eye too! I thought that she was the only one.
LISTENING TO CONAN!!!!
Those marc jacobs eyeshadow palettes 😍😍
I love this vlog sm!!!
4:05 Nellie is literally me 24/7 😂
Yay!!!!!
I love your vlogs. 😍
Funkopops also do Friends characters xo
Nelly is so perfect!!!!
Gabby you never look gross ❤️
I hear Conannnn
How much are the ghd staightners? Xx
gabs - *looks gorgeous* i look the worst\nme - wot\nlysm 💘💘
I HEAR CONAN ❤️❤️
Gabriella!! You should read this! Maybe it helps you, Nelly, and little Bean!!\n\nI'm sure a lot of people have commented this, but Jeremy might be marking his territority (they are both males, and cats are territorial beings.) Have you had them/ him neutered? Tomcats (and some she-cats) will start to pee once they become sexually mature, especially when there are other male cats around and there's little space. At your parents' place there may be more space and he may feel less pressured into marking his territory. It's just a guess. But it doesn't have to mean that he must leave you to live with them. Neutering is a personal decision regarding tomcats, but it can be an option.\n\nAlso, if you can, try to fit in another cat toilet. We have two cats and two toilets (because it works out fine), but normally they advise you to have 1 toilet per cat + 1 extra toilet (2 cats, 3 toilets). \n\nLastly, I once had a cat with kidney problems. He peed all over the place until we found out he had renal failure. Should little Bean continue to pee (nevermind where) despite having been neutered, have the vet check his kidneys! Be thorough about it if that remains one of the last options, as some vets are reluctant to do that (especially for young cats, but British Shorthair cats are at an increased risk for kidney problems like PKD and you only detect it in the cat's behaviour after 2/3 of the kidneys are already beyond repair).\n\nI hope this helps you solve your troubles. To depart from such a sweetling would be heartbreaking (even if it were for the better, and then that couldn't be changed and you'd be doing the right thing)!\n\nLove :-)
Omg tomato and basil soup from marks and Spencer's is the best!!!!! Highly recommend getting a nice brown roll to dip in
I have Chronic Fatigue so I know how you feel! No one understands and I get called lazy quite a lot. I really hope you feel better soon 💕💕xxx
Bean's purring ☺️
Bloody love Sophie Louise , so glad she's beginning to get noticed a lot more 😊💕
Hi Gabs! I have just posted a homeware haul on my channel if you wouldn't mind giving it a watch! There's 2 bedding sets in it and i know you love cute bedding haha! Thank you, love your videos <3 Xx
HI BICH(es)👋🏻🚨- 🐴🀆🗯💀STREAM HI BICH now at https://Atlantic.lnk.to/hibich 🏁
Beat like a x song
Fame made her desperate for money
I am waiting for her to react to people who reacted to this
yo I can't even lie she lit asf
Lol Dr.Phil is probably bumping this in his ford explorer. You know shes just a product of his business.
This queen(Danielle) has some fire songs🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This generation is totally screwed.  This is total garbage 😂
does not deserve to be famous or even known
If only that chair was real...
And y'all watch if lil uzi put this out y'all would like it
Someone please turn that on
This is a child.  She doesn't know about ANYTHING yet.
I'm so happy you made a new song I love your music and love you in general thanks for being amazing
I think Dr Phil did a mess up
why does everyone like her she just a girl with an anger issue who swears too much
You got fake quick  but you where  never real
When is she gonna thank Dr.Phil
Does it sound similar to black card from asap mob ?
This is what happened if u don't give ur child a beating
It's sounds like bad an boujee
That first beat shouldn't have been given to her, she can't do it justice
Friendly reminder u are 14 and were sick so went to dr.phil byee
thank you quentin miller for another hit!
As much as j wanna say fuck Danielle this beat kinda go hard .
She's gonna be sad and miserable most of her short life!
This sounds exactly like every other shitty rap song so I mean technically it’s not bad
I'd hit it
She went haven lol at 1:20
so many people hating but she's making money off your hate sooo
Still wating for the English version of the dr phil show
u can tell she doesn't even write this shit
This is true art 😂
I exactly like it
This shit is way betta then that luna llena shit>>>big ole facts
OMG !  This is supposed to be music? Bregoli or BAHD BHABIE..Where did you take singing\nlessons? an Alley?  I wouldn't waste my time and try to reform you.
Ok so \n1) girl, you're beautiful (can't deny that)\n2) what's wrong with people? She's a 13/14 yo getting recognition from being a rebel to say the least.
New FAV song🤘🏻💎💕👑✨. U r my ROLE MODEL Danielle✨👑💕💎
Her voice is so annoooyyinngggg
*One of Americas most Wanted girl* ...
I'm offended in so many ways
Why is she popular
This could been good if the verses weren't so trash. The chorus was ight.
Love this song bhad bhabie and congrats on going All the way to the top,you are #4 trending 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🎉🎉🎉
Omg how do I like song
WHY ARE WE ENCOURAGING HER BAD BEHAVIOR?
Take the L dr Phil
Who's going to see her in hell
I'm honestly not that bothered by her music. It's just music, if you don't like it don't listen. I probably won't listen to it myself, not my style. But! I will give anything a chance. Only thing I noticed the whole video were her nails. Yikes.
1:52 oml that poor fricking horse, they litterally used the hardest bit and yanked on the lead witch is causing the bit to slash into his gums... if I were that horse I would kill Danielle and the black dude
She got a good ghost writer
this song makes me think that jake paul is a nice guy
When she acts tough in this video but cried at the actual court case
She can’t even spell
Why is this thing on YouTube?
What the heck is this video
Why can't she spell cuss words right?
Damn she blowin up like my Channel
Hey can we be besties plsss bhabie plasss   I think you are the the best person in the world love you
That’s Gucci gang no wait that’s molly by lil pump
Who tryna be my parent so we can be on dr Phil next
“White jays, white Porsche, white wrist, white horse” I can’t believe she made a song about this topic, she’s truly a queen 😩😩😩👌🏼👌🏼💦🐄🖤🙇🏻😩🙆🏻‍♂️
i just realized she is the girl who said 'how bow da'
This song is litt my favorite song 😂😂😂😂
I love this shit😍🤘🏼🔥
This sounds just like the song « Audi »
2:47 Lil hoe says her chain costs a mill but her neck dry tho😂
Guys.. guys.. its too late, You can try and bash her anymore... its.. too .. late its just making her more popular now

This Go Hard IDC IDC IDC🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷❤
Awesome .
Forgot about this wow I use to be a fan of Jay
Chester was universally beloved by all music genres/artists.
Hearing the background vocals of chesters and realizing he isn't there to sing them is still hard to comprehend ):
Why do people dislike it. This is fucking amazing
god thank you so much jay z! he seem so sad oh god...rest in peace angel.
jay z that was a great tribute..... top man!! RIP CHESTER.
Never glorify people who commit suicide, gives young people the idea that you will be missed more if you top yourself, poor millionaire with a life  that most would wish for leaves behind six kids, what a hero to have, he was a coward
I feel amazed and sad at the same time
WTF just happened, I got tears rollin down my face, damn!
That moment when Chester voice came on and jay-z pulled his cap down. No close ups, such raw emotion evoked. Sweet bittersweet well done jay
Peace in the name of Christ. Somebody please get the following short vid in front of Jay Z: https://youtu.be/pFb0Xu2xJYg
One last time I need ya'll to raw... \nRIP Chester ❤️
I'm in tears
This has been my ringtone ever since class 6 :( \nMakes me so sad
Thank you Jay Z! That was awesome! Make Chester proud!
My favorite live performance of this is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNCz8fWs3lE\nChester with the intro
Legendary Song\nWe miss you Chester \nGod bless\nRespect for Jayz
Oh my god that was really emotional ...
Was it just me expecting him to sing the chorus?
Jay Z i definately Top 5 as far as a Hip Hop artist.
Clara is such a beautiful woman and she does her job well. And not enough can be said about how wise Jay is
BBC putting VEVO in the thumbnail for the views niceee
heres a song just for you ..all about truth..its illegal to use a legal name..  https://youtu.be/nVVlw7WsYNQ
Make some noise, one last time....
RIP, Dear Chester❤😢\nWith love, from Russia
Who's cutting the onions so close to my room smh.
My god... That brought a tear to my eye
I love when he says chester and then he sings :). R.I.P
Thank you for this performance. Bittersweet and much appreciated. <3
Does Jayz even have new songs??
👍👍👍 real respecting real \nRip a beautiful soul
This is a good one. Nice one Jay Z.
This should be viral... Again
Rest in peace my star 😢😢😢😢😢
Jay Z was feeling this one. So sad. RIP Chester. 💔
Man, this was fucking beautiful.
Linkin park green day cold play maroon 5 bands rule.one republic
There were 499 comments \nHad to make it 500
Speechless 😶. To think we will never hear his voice again in person. Only recordings
Used t love jigga. He using his status for politics and I hate that shit.
wow his voice just like the studio version
Hearing chester's voice again but remembering he isn't with us anymore is too hard to handle man.... FUCK!! \n\nRIP Chester </3
The first song that got me in rap the man jay z was a full rock head till I heard this on my Sony Ericsson
The amplified meaning of Chester's lyrics after the fact now....\n2004 blasting this album in my mom's car. Chester's verse always kicked right in the gut, but not like now
Jay Z is a legend, what he has done for the game is unprecedented.
Fuck, this is so epic. I'm crying. Thank you Jay-Z!
Thank you Jay, I shed a tear for Chester.
So much better than the mumble rap these days, how is this lower on trending than fucking Bhad Bhabie, fucking bs.
The performance duo between Jay z and Linkin Park was the first time i saw Jay Z emotionally touched and for the part where Chester sings, i personally believe no one had even moved Jay Z like that before especially with his own song and this is why Jay Z felt compelled to do this tribute. There really will never be such a great collab ever again. Rip !!
Hi guys I'm a smaller YouTuber you've never heard of and I wanted your honest opinions of my channel..\nYa don't have to sub but plz give me some feedback even if it is negative
He's as good as tupac and biggie, if not better!

LINKIN PARKK WOOHOOOOOOO

Chester really did have a epic different ass voice.. Such a unique sound
*CHESTER*\n= child. molester.\n#PizzaGate Hollywood Pedophillia.
What brand is the shirt Jay is wearing?
People always worked up on how other people use their money. BRUH!! It's not your money!
Its Emilia's moment, Eduardo shouldn't have gotten anything .. and before you all open your mouths i have 4 grown kids and 4 grandchildren .. I'm sorry Anna and  Jonathan you aren't supposed to be your kidds friend (at lleast not until they have well grown up
No hate so dont attack people but i think bubs is too big for that bassinet her head always seems to be pushed up against it .
I don't get why Eduardo got a coin from the tooth fairy? It wasn't his tooth? So will Emilia get one when Eduardo loses his first tooth? Very strange. Not a good way to each your kids that they can't have everything.
Poor Emilia, must be confusing to a 5 year old, you are the one that lost a tooth, your first tooth!!  That is the only reason why the tooth fairy is coming is because a tooth was lost and yet your little brother gets a coin too for not losing a tooth. You can see it on her sweet adorable face, confusion. She doesn't get it. Meanwhile Eduardo gets a coin for no reason at all, which should be confusing to him as well and probably was, then excitement took over. So I guess confusing the child who lost the tooth and thought it was about her won over letting a child who didn't lose a tooth wait for his time/day. Which is probably not at all how it was explained to Emilia when she was first told about the Tooth Fairy. She is so smart and observant, this undermines trusting what you are told.
It's so funny seeing people get worked up all over a fallen out tooth. PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT DUMBASSES.
Alessia was like just change my nappy already while Anna was talking to the camera!! 😂😂😂
I cringed when I saw Jonathan with these wet wipes on the throw smudging it all, brrr...
“Mommy loves this throw more than mommy loves Daddy” 😂😂 I died
I know it’s not really my place to say but, Eduardo really needs to know that he can’t get everything that Emilia has and giving him a pound when Emilia lost her tooth, that could take away that specialness of the tooth fairy coming. Yeah I know Jonathan said that he would get upset if he didn’t get one but  I still don’t think it’s right. No hate though! I still LOVE you guys so much 💖💖💖💖💖
“Eduardo, you’re going to have to live at someone else’s house.” Actually dying right now!!! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
well they sure messed it all up for many other parents/children when this brat goes and tells all the kids that they both got money and the tooth wasn't taken. Their kids are going to be so delusional about life someone needs to call CPS on this family making their children share their lives to support them
Who else finds it hilarious and adorable that the dogs go to daycare😂👌🏼
Anna's voice is so calming
I am just saying but Emilia looks really sad because eduardo got one
you shouldn't be feeding anything that contains chocolate to dogs.it is really toxic to their system.humans and dogs have entirely different body systems.
i would love to see Anna's reaction to Eduardo's face paint and the throw situation!! LOL
The special tooth fairy coin is enough for a movie ticket and popcorn?? O: makes me wish I still had baby teeth to get that coin lol.
I love Albi...He's the best Joly besides Jonathon:0
I can bet that Emilia will not get anything when it will be Eduardos turn for the Tooth Fairy...it's all about sharing when is Emilia the one that does it...it gets old and pretty much unfair for her..
Watching you rub that eyeshadow into the throw was brutal.
OMGNESS Eduardo........ :-/ LOL That was terrible! Also everywhere he touched w his grubby hands left behind a brown print! LMFAO He is SO CUTE tho!! I feel bad tho Anna loves that spread and it was SO close to the new bed!! YIKES! Jonathan you boys are lucky you still get to sleep in the main house!! Love You guys this made me laugh AND get nervous!!
Alessia's grin at 11:23 is precious.Made my night!
Hahaha Eduardo you are going to have to go live in someone else's house! Bahahaha my stomach hurts from laughing so much. This vlog was wonderful, but I wish we could have seen Anna's reaction to the throw Situationes
Put some shaving cream for the duvet. Rub it in first then throw in the washer.
When I saw the modern renaissance pallet something in me died I swear then he opened it and I thought oh know Eduardo you're dead ahahaha
Beautiful, thank you for sharing
I was hoping to see Anna reaction to that make everywhere lol
These vlogs are so real, makes me love them even more:)
The song at the beginning is so beautiful. Does anyone know the name of it?
Emilia is so sweet. omg Eduardo with the makeup. Lol what a mess. Alessia is such a cutie. Obviously we don't see everything, I don't get why people think they know it all. Hope you are all having a good weekend. <3
I would love to have seen  Anna's  reaction to  Eduardo  destroying her   Make-up
Shame the limelight was taken away from Emilias moment by Eduardo - he will get his own moment one day. You use the words he will get upset far too much. He's going to find the real world very tough if he thinks he gets everything he wants constantly and is never disappointed. You can't protect them from that all the time sadly, if only you could.
This is so adorable i can't handle their cuteness <3
Not the modern renaissance palette! Ive never cringed so hard 😂😂😂
Not the Modern Renaissance palette D:
try not to cringe challenge while watching Jonathan try and get rid of the stain
both anna & jonathan are so amazing at engaging with their audience whilst talking to a camera! feels like they're standing right in front of me, comes so naturally to them ❤️
There was so much Anna sass in this vlog and I love it. You tell 'em, Anna. There are no perfect people out there. Also, my heart might have broken a little seeing what Eduardo did to the Modern Renaissance palette and Anna's throw. It might be time to teach that boy about brushes. 😂
My face though when Jonathan opened the eyeshadow pallet :0
Omg Anna Alessia is absolutely gorgeous so chilled a reflection of you for being such a good mum xx💖
I just love how people get all up in Anna's grill like they were invited to the barbeque. Mind your own business. Anna is doing a great job as a mother of three and both she and Jonathan are giving all three children the attention they need. \nIt's just that sometimes, a toddler needs a little more attention because they actually run around and could get in trouble, which a baby cannot do. I'm positive Anna knows what she's doing and does not need to justify her parenting.\nStay in school kids!
Who agrees Emilia probably has more money in her piggy bank than themselves hahah
OMG 😱 How I wish to have a modern rainaissance palette 🙈 and then EDUARDO 😁😁😁❤
oh my goodness, Alessia's smile melts my heart. It's quite possibly the most beautiful smile I've ever seen on a baby. (That is, ofcourse, until I have my own children haha) You two make lovely children. xo I think you're an awesome mum.
Why doesn't this channel have more subs 🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽
ANNA YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUSTIFY YOURSELF TO ANYONE. YOUR THE MUM YOU PARENT HOW YOU WANT TOO! YOUR AN AMAZING MOTHER.
Anna tell the haters to flip off and for all the haters anna is a amazing mum so back off we are so lucky we se their cogs they choose so yeh leave anna alone
https://youtu.be/2QE1vLUgGzk\nTry not to laugh
Why are they losing subscribers? they don't deserve it
Bless Emilia xx she's so cute and Eduardo xx
I wanted to see Anna's reaction to the bed situation after Eduardo got into her makeup.
You guys are amazing.  wow this video made me tear up x
eduardo makes me laugh so much ! he reminds me of what my brother was like when he was little
TOTALLY got your back! I was like that with my second 🙈 god knows how I will handle a 3rd...if it ever happens 😬❤️
Mummy loves this throw more than she loves daddy 😂 amazing
ui hope that whereever eduardo lives now, he keeps us updated with vlogs.
“I’ve got more money in my piggy bank” 😂😂 the sass
Not the modern renaissance palette 😱😱
Has Anna saw the make up mark on her throe blanket yet???? Love you videos xxxxx
I think Eduardo did a great make up look with the modern renesansse palette :D oh god I would be so sad if that happened to me but you know life happens and at the end of the day at least Eduardo had some fun and this is just some make up that can be repurchased  :)
You are the best parents ever💞and the kids are so adorable
Anna, you do an amazing job! All of you do including the children. I don't have children myself but I work in a very busy nursery (the baby room) I totally understand how hard it is especially like you said when 1 of them is screaming, fighting or crying. Don't let the haters get to you! Usually their more jealous of you and try to put you down because they don't like the fact that they can't cope and they can see you all can at times and are an amazing family... I watch your vlogs daily and I can see that you all have a bond like no other.. embrace the love and support and forget the low lifes..love you all xxx
What happened with the bed did Anna go mad i know i would
As a makeup lover I had to pause the video when I saw the state of that Modern Renaissance palette, take a couple of deep breaths and swallow the tears before I could continue watching.
Anna honestly don't listen to the negative, I know it's easier said than done but as parents we do our absolute best for our little people and that's all that matters, if no one has told you today; you're doing an awesome job💕 positivity is easier to spread xx
I've got makeup on a throw before and it was really hard to get off...❤
Now tv is back
I wish we could have an update on the throw, were you able to save it ? Because the wipes were definitely not helping lol
Just subscribed what lovely people, an absolute joy to watch
so cute!❤️and it’s crazy how old alessia looks now
Actually Anna that sound pretty much like spanish lol
So what Eduardo got a coin or a present?? Are they really horrible parents?? Do people honestly think their parenting method is not preparing  them for the real world??  \n\nYour kids are beautiful individuals. They are caring, intelligent, and respectful children, but most of all happy!!! No one in this comment section has mastered the art of parenting, and are in no position tell you how to raise your kids. Keep up the good work Anna and Jonathan. These unicorn moms preach fairytales anyways.
My baby has been in baby grows for 5 months xxx I've got your back xx
I think that babies should be in babygrows, I didn't put my son into proper clothes or outfits until he was three months old and he's my first! I just think that you should enjoy them whilst they're little 🙂 you're doing fab Anna!
Does anybody know what lip colour Anna is wearing??
Thanks for sharing this video, Jonathan and Anna! Makes me feel so happy seeing such happy babies! :D Have a great day Sacconejolys!
Anna your a fabulous mom and the haters should get a life. 😘
All I can hear is Anna screaming no when Jonathan started to wipe the throw with wipes haha
Thought he got the wipes to get him cleaned up but nope the bed 😂
Anna you are so beautiful ❤️
Anna I think you rock. You inspire me.

You can't call your kid after the Teletubbies
Dina is definitely pregnant! I have been saying for a while now. Her skin always use to be pretty clear and after Ramadhan her skin has broke out real bad, especially on her forehead! This is one of the signs of pregnancy.
Kanza means shoes in my language plz don't name her that
What is that eyebrow color though? 😍
Jasminnnnnnnnnnnnnn I love uuuuuu I wish u see this  comment
She's pregnant for sure 😆
DID SHE DYE HER HAIR GREY? OMG so pretty!
Dina : Would you ever consider calling our baby Penelope ?                                     Sid : No . 😂😂😂
NOAH\nIS \nBEAUTIFUL😍\nSWEAR IMMA GONNA CALL MY FIRST SON..\nEVEN THOUGH I AM STILL 15..\n😂😂😂😂😂
Lol it's not a petrol station in Texas is a city in Texas lol
An actress named  Gwyneth Paltrow (started in iron Man blond Lady) has  named her daughter Apple so maybe it's possible lol
Scandinavia's most famous blogger is  named Kenza Zouiten, she is stunning
You second daughter name must be HESSA, it means Fate :)
Let Po be a nickname haha call ur grandkids that Teletubbies is gonna finish innit
Is Dinas mum and dad still together?
Color inspired would be violet
Anybody else wondering what Dina has done to her teeth??
Gwyneth Paltrow’s daughter’s name is Apple...and Gwyn got so much shit for it, lol 🍎🍏\n\nAnd do you like the name Blue cause of Blue Ivy (Beyoncé’s daughter)!!! 💙💙
I called my son Binyameen, 15 years ago now
My baby's boy  name is Adam.
Hi Dina i really like what you do. Benyamin is not muslim name i dont like it 😜😜😜 i like adam hana ....💋💋 i am in france but can you please talk quite slowly because some time i dont understand what you say 😬😬😬i love you
MEMPHIS IS A REALLY PRETTY NAME
My eyes well up every time you say my name. Hahahaha. Elijah!
My favourite baby girls name is Yasmin, and Hannah and my favourite boy's name is Adam I love that name too 💕
Yara like in game of thrones
If we have a girl we're calling her Poe 😳
As'salamu'alikum Dina. I wanted to ask you if you could make a video about what is going on with a Pakistani-American muslim scholar  Ustad Nouman Ali Khan, since you have many followers mashAllah and you have a platform, you can spread awareness about it. He needs our support, people need to know that they should not believe what they hear, he has done so much for our muslim community nd now people are pointing fingers at him, this could happen to anyone. You can understand it a bit more since you are a public figure too. Im gona do my part and speak for him and ask known people who have the platform to speak for him, hoping if not some, a few will respond, since I can't reach people around the world, you guys can. He needs our support and prayers. Because every little step/thing matters.\n\nJazakAllah kher.
My little Ibrahim is very kind and sweet indeed ❤️
Also the name Hedaya🙆 its not common and it's an islamic name
Chris martin from coldplays daughters name is apple
Omg that’s so weird my favourite girls name is Penelope too Dina😂😂
you should move abroad where no one knows who teletubbies are :D hahahahhahahahhah
Both of you such a beautiful and cute couples .... 💘💘
DEEN is a nice name pronounced as Dean. I love the name Dahlia for a girl as Well. Fun to watch.  Xxx
There's actually an international student in my class whose name is Apple!!
Po is ass in German😀
Apple been done by Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow their daughter Apple.
My brother's gf name is yara😂😂
Isn't Poe the poet? I dunno 🤷🏾‍♀️
isn't there a poe in star wars the force awakens? i would name my son poe.
thank u Dina😂but Yara means a rare flower that grows in very tall mountains
Dina's been dropping hints lately👀👀 who else thinks she's going to say she's pregnant in a few days?
Isn't Poe that one Tellytubby?\n\nEdit- wrote this before they mentioned it but guys don't name ur kid after a tellytubby...pls
Poe in German as Po means butt 🍑 🍑 🍑
DINA IS PREGNANT I KNOW IT
I'm sure Poe is another word for toilet, be careful it's not if you ever have another baby xxx
If im not mistaken chris martin and gwyneth paltrow have a daughter named apple 🤔
Edgar Allan Poe is a poet!!
i love the color of your hijab! matches your hair I think
My husband's nickname for me is Apples <3
I want to take a bite of that apple\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 He would. Hahaha
if you had a daughter penelope you could call her poe as a nickname...
I would never call my child Poe that's too close to poo and she gets bullied in school she would be named poo
LOL!!! I have grandbaby named Noah and one named Austin. Austin we call Bean. But we call Noah... No, No, No! Noah! My middle name is also Dena.
Iris is nice actually .. it's the best part of the eye 😃
love how she recalled the telly tubbies names😂
my sons name is noah, noah ali lol
I hope one day my future husband will accept giving our kids arab names or religious names they are just so beautiful. Btw why not Greek names? I love Dafne and Diana( Artemis) actually with the Italian pronunciation they sound so good 🌹
Edgar Allen POE is one of my favourite people
If u have a boy u should call him Khaled!!!❤❤
You've literally got every man in my family's name as a favorite 😂
Awww my name is Kinza! No one ever mentions it in these things lol I got low key excited when you did 😂
I actually really love the name Hana (or Hannah, which is how I see it always spelled in the US). I also like your name, Dina, it has a nice ring to it. The one thing I utterly dislike is how longer names, like mine, are always shortened in my country...is like, no, I don't think the diminutive everyone always uses for my *actual* given name is in any way cute. In fact, it irritates me. (end rant).
Po means bum in German. 😂
Dexters not sick he'll make a labrotory in your yard
When she said blue, I said blue at the same time in my head. Closest I've ever been to Dina. #internationalfanproblems
Dexter sounds like one of those cool kids names who's parents are older, modernized, only uses apple, homeschool the kids, and wears clear-round glasses.
Annoying
Yes dawood is david 😂👍🏻
My sisters name is literally Kenza Khan lmao
On trending😍👌👌👌👌😊
KEBAB KHAN. Hahahahah!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Bbe7uxvvY\n\nPOE!
As far as I know, David is the English version of Dawood. :)
I like Jelani for a boy and Vonetta for a girl ♡♡♡

I wish Justine would make a LG V30 unboxing.
3:17 I'm dying of laughter hahaha
Matching the watch size with the size of your wrist-> first-world problem.
Belkin was way too better than the other one and Belkin does make quality products, liked it....\n\nPeace 🙏🏻🇮🇳
Every time Justine mentions her switch I thought she was addicted alittle to much but after buying it a few days ago it hasn't left my hands since.
I love when she said apple text are blue. Samsung is green text lol
Talk about white privilege here, all coming to an end very soon.
she's looking Very innocent with bobs and vageena
Aren’t you getting the iPhone 10
I like the black disc more but your devices will look better on the white disc.
In the future, the wireless docks will be wireless

I thought she's talking about the iPhone 8 in general
Who here is ambidextrous?\n*Say I*\n\nAmbidextrous club
Can't wait for the unboxing of iphone 8

what's the point of wireless charging if you need to connect the pad anyways
I got my iPhone8 last night and it’s amazing
Use this wireless charger for my Galaxy S8+ ... highly recommend\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B06ZYLQ2TP/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Such a stupid dumb blind fan bitch
Left hand squad were you at????
I'm left handed but I still wear my Apple Watch on my left wrist
Like if you’re also left handed
Shouldn’t you have mentioned that this is not “fast” wireless charging whereas Samsung’s is?

Can you buy iPhone 8 plus one for you one for me😂
It's not an iPhone 8 girl
9th trending in the uk
This entire channel is the biggest Apple advertisement ever\n\nI mean not that its a bad thing and some find it entertaining but I feel like it should be a little bit more transparent that its a big giant advertisement.
Is she the new 'Unboxing Therapy'?
Justine where did you get the pink iPhone 8 plus case?
😍 I love to see unboxing videos but honestly Im done with the iPhone I just want a phone to call and text no more fancy stuff lol 😂 #oldskool

Can I get at least 100 likes!? Like to make my dream come true
She's getting older, you can tell
Are you getting the iPhone X? I don't blame you if you don't📱
She's traveling, out of town, has iPhone 8 stuff, while I'm here with a double chin in my room and an iPhone 6 Plus with no service on it.......
It is very smaller.
Blonde girl likes Apple and Nintendo products.  Whoa!  Don't forget to preload your remedial 5th grade algebra app on that new phone.
You are so good
I think Apple could of done better. Maybe next year.

Anyone else prefer these videos to be shorter? I enjoy them but find myself mashing K way too often.
I've had the larger northern Australian orb weavers stuck to my face after riding into the web while working cattle. They never bite but push their way out through the web to escape. My horse got one trapped in its ear one time and he really didn't enjoy it, but once again the spider didn't bite but searched the web for a hole big enough to escape through and dropped to the ground.
what kind of insurance do you have that allows you to get bitten by bullet ants and free handle  spiders
Watching this video on your belly makes you worry about your legs 😂😕
Where is this at? So I know not to go there ever
IM LITTERALLY SCARED the demons of these things are literally haunting you!
The same old awesome answer\n\nWill it bite
I know it's a video but I'm about to cry. This is super scary
The white patch on it's head looks a bit like IT the clown or Jason 😂
You didn't go over the most interesting part, the webs are yellow! The coloration makes the web attractive to some insects like bees, and camouflages the web against wooden backdrops.
you are amazing can you come to my birth day party if you can contact me on this chanale if you can like so my dream can come true.
Spoofer was like, O right babe come back soon.
Wow the will it bite challenges trend really fast
I had one in my pool before\nNever went swimming in that pool again
The only time I ever want to see ads
If you look carefully on the under side of spider head, at about 7mins, you can see a baby's face
Arachnophobia is the reason why I'm not going to visit India again.
One time I had a live black widow in my grapes
I live in Florida 😟
let it walk on you right out of the box. Its more realistic since people dont carry 15 ft sticks
there's one that looks like it has a smile on its back. that is creepy
Congratulations u made it to the trending section😤👌🏼
Where can I buy a spider stick?
Ive seen that on my back yard
I get this chill on my leg when I watch a spider video and the worst part is I am in Australia. XD
Am i the only one who loves soiders here ??? 😂😂😂
I’ve had one of those at my house and I live in New York. Biggest spider I’ve ever seen
Man I really don't want to get bit, but I need the views.
This actually made me feel a bit better about spiders. I've been making myself safely capture and release spiders instead on instantly smashing them like I use to. Spiders are just living their life and they aren't out to get us. I just wish they would stay outside
I've seen those kinds of spiders in Mexico almost twice as big.
IF I SAW THAT I WOULD RUN INTO THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmade in Bilal
We have those spiders all over Florida, we call them banana spiders.
I have arachnophobia like this if u have it too😦
Still waiting for the Warrior Wasp video Coyote...  :/
Warning, spider bites can be incredibly dangerous, and potentially fatal.\nAhh yes, over here in England we have the man hunting tea spider
the white spot on the back of the spider head looks like a hockey mask @ 6:08 you can see it really well
Thank you for these spider episodes, really helps!!!
This guy is a beast
Let a hobo spider walk on u
I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA 🇦🇺😅😓😰😬😶🕷😵
Why would you do this?
This is my favorite type of spider that I never seen before
I just got the brave adventure's book and I can't wait to read it !!!!! I'm so excited!!!! :)
But The Question Is....\n\n\n\nWill it blend?
Golden orb weaver spiders are my favorite of all the orb web spiders. They are super pretty. Very elegant spiders.
I think your crazy and cool at the same time
I see those around my house all the time acually a few years ago that same spider but smaller WAY smaller than coyotes spun a web in my snorkel and went to breath and sucked it down into my throat smh I hate spiders lol
where is this, central park?
Have those all around my house in AL
Does it hurt when it bite you?
When I lived in the Philippines these were called banana spiders and this one you have here is pretty small compared to what they could be
Coyote is the orbweaver venomous not that orbweaver
At least drones are becoming a thing. you can create a automated spider killer drone that flies around your house and kills spiders.
I love you guys you make me happy thx you for making animals vids
I live in Florida!!!ahhhhh
I'm terrified of spiders but this one is beautiful!
they look like the ones in ocorina of time
Can you catch a super rare Ghost lobster.......
Coyote listens to its every day bro\n\n\n\nMark: you ok?
I'm from Florida and one time running a cross country race I ran into a web and one of those banana spiders bit me, it's really not that bad. I'm surprised coyote was over hyping it and making it sounds scary. Banana spiders are super common here and docile. The bite is compared to a wasp or bee sting. I think it was like a wasp sting, hurt a bit right away but nothing else happened to me, I was totally fine. Don't be scared of them.
From one Coyote to another - Fears are not the same as Phobias. pls.
Huge brown wandering spiders are everywhere in our house
I have to say that is one of the coolest looking spiders I have ever seen.
or the another one of that because i leave in philippines so i saw it in my back yard
Scary!!!!!!!!!!😱
spider stick.... :P
Awesome!!!
coyote: probably a fly or a beatle\nme: NOOOOOOOO PAUL MCCARTNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:25 ya right
Y tho?
Never saw coyote so calm
Ill never eat bananas again.
All aboard destination... Nopeville!!
Oh hell no...
My body feels heavy

Coyote is all like ohhh a spider I'm gonna touch it well I'm here just like Helllllllll nah
Go to a wolf and let him walk by u
Anyone else thing of Araquanid from pokemon? No? Just me?

Can we please get these gender confused crossdressers off the trending page. There's impressionable children that watch YouTube and they shouldn't encounter people like this on the trending page.
Why can't I be as pretty as you girl ?😩😭😍😍😍
What the hell is wrong with this pig?
Let's take a shot every time Jeffree says collection!😂
Omg THIS HAIR. I mean, ok, you were classy AF in platinum blonde, but this turquoise..
distracted by Jefferee's hair I wish my mama should alow me to do that...... i love you jefree 😚😘😘😙
What are you? What is wrong with our world today.
I just woke up and  my daughter had left this video open on my laptop. My first thought was who the fuck is, this?  Then my second thought, I need to be friends with them.  Third, I went searching for that Charlotte Tilbury .  You go a new 47 year old fan who is now going to binge all your vids.  PS lets be friends,  for real.
You still a fucking racist
Please make a foundation 😭
Why the fuck is this dumb ass transgender trending⁉️‼️
Take a shot every time Jeffree touches his hair. 😂😑
She looks like a mermaind
Where did you get the wig at?
Can we meet your camera crew?
How the hell can he slay my life with hair looking wet and eyebrows blue and I can't even get away with my fucking brown hair
Me, Nathan and our dogs are collabing I can imagine how this collab went:\nJeffree - I think think this collection needs more pink\nNathan - blue shade would be unique and dope\nDaddy - *Woof*\nDiamond - *Woof*\nDelicious - *Woof*\nDiva - *sleeps*
I love how all the people clicking on this video just to post an annoying hateful comment make him get more money off their views, you go Jeffree
the hair is stunning on you! omg
why theres so much hate in the comments?  Wtf.
Transgenderism is a mental disorder.\nuse your communist healthcare and get help.....

YOUR HAIR OMG I'M SO IN LOVE OMG
You can't polish a shit, you look awful never mind what lipstick or hair you have. Dreadful human.

I NEED a tutorial on that eye look
I just want to touch his lips, lmao. They look so smooth and plump after he applied the liquid lips 😂
I love the new hair!! Looks great!!
Remember when he made a black skin frost
Your hair is life
Damn just one plane trip would be nice for me\nAnd why the hell would anyone spend more than 20$ on any kind of makeup?\nI don't spend more than 5 dollars on a razor an shaving cream\nNo lie you don't need 100$ eye liner you need an 1 hr of therapy for the lack of self esteem \nOr a slap upside the head\nSeriously who the fuck wants to spend this type of cash when you can go out to a nice restaurant an treat yo self good instead of makin yo self look like a clown that was crapped out of hell
VERGATANAZO! que es esta chingadera?

Nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure.
Is that the new wig from Nikita Dragun? Lmfao
You look horrible in blue eyebrows
ew what the fuck is that thing
She got incinerated and reformed each once before that, in the same episode, as well as being stabbed in the face by Hughes earlier, as well as earlier deaths that we're not going to be privy to, so your calculations will be way off here.
Take a shot of butterbeer every time Mat says philosopher's stone
Dang it I was gonna try to become immortal but no it's just a theory a film theory.
I'm sorry okay, but the theorizer is much better. sure he doesn't cover anime, but he brings up good points for his theories and can admit when his theory has holes in it. (yes I know matpat admitted that one of his fnaf videos wasn't put together that well, but he doesn't do it with any other theories. for example, his For Honor theory was pretty garbage, where as the theorizer has said about a few of his earlier videos about how people have managed to debunk his theories and he accepts them and tries again.) maybe its just personal opinion, I dunno but I just thought I would say this.
Next time on film theory: is the human centipede possible?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Plz do this)
i would say.. didnt lust die a few times before then?
Some say that Albert Einstein believed in a creator or Intelligent design. It is unconfirmed about which religion he most supported or if he believed in something else all together. But I will say that I am a Christian and a Philosopher. (Which if you didn't know already is the origin of science and government.) \n          \n I know that you are believer in science, so I also expect you to be either agnostic or atheist. If you are an atheist, then according to my understanding of the word: there is nothing I can do to convince you of God's existence. If you are an agnostic, then according to my understanding of the word, you are a true skeptic. \n\n(I define atheist as someone who rejects the concept of God and an agnostic as someone who doubts the concept of God. I am not being judgmental or presuming anything. I just define them this way so that I can distinguish between the two.) \n           \n            And if you are a man of science, then you must understand and accept an important philosophy: You have to look at all the facts for both sides of an argument before making your decision about who is more accurate. (And according to my Physics teacher, Nothing is science is ever proven. There is just evidence that supports an idea.)\n           \n        If you support this philosophy, then you must consider yourself agnostic rather than an atheist. If this is true about you, then I can give you links to evidence for God's existence, discussions about biblical topics, and even a testimony about an atheist who became a Christian. Once you have learned this knowledge, you can make up you mind afterwards.\n\n(THE FOLLOWING IS ADDRESSED TO EVERYONE. I INVITE EVERYONE TO READ THE FOLLOWING AND REPLY ACCORDING TO WHAT IS BELOW)\n\nI will not be posting the links on this comment. I will also not be posting it as a reply to it. Instead, I will be posting them elsewhere. Read the following to find out where.\n\nIf you claim to be an atheist even after seeing my definition of it, reply to my comment.\n\nIf you claim to be an agnostic based on my definition of it, do not reply to my comment. Instead, go to my channel, click on any video, and say this in the comments: Alpha and Omega.  If you do this, I will provide you with the links.\n\nIf you are a Christian, or claim to be one (since there are false and half-hearted Christians), do not get involved if anyone starts arguing with me. Instead, reply with these words: GODS NOT DEAD. If you want to see a testimony or grow in your understanding, post this as a comment on any of my videos on my channel.\n\nIf you are a Jew or Muslim, I also invite you to see the links. While I do not doubt your belief in God, I do ask these questions. To Muslims, Is Allah really  the same God as the one Jews and Christians believe in; and do you really understand what Muhammad really teaches? To Jews: Why do you reject Jesus as the Messiah? Do you reject him because that is what you were taught, or did you choose to reject him after researching what Christians believe. For Muslims, go to my channel and comment the word: ALLAH If you are a Jew, go to my channel and comment this phrase on any of my videos: The Books of Moses. \n\nIf you are part of another Religion, I will ask you this. Do you believe out of tradition? Do You believe because you chose to? Do you believe half-heartedly? Or are you devoted to your beliefs? Regardless of what the answer is, I can  tell you that only the one who is devoted will remain after I provide evidence. If you have any doubts about your beliefs or yourself, comment this on any of my videos: John 3:16\n\nFor members of a cult, I have nothing to say accept this. Time is running out. You can not waste time on things that you don't benefit from. If you want to find a firm foundation to put your faith in, go to my channel and comment this word on any of my videos: Foundation
U forgot about the existence of gingers
Ignore the ragemongers Matpat, I love when you do anime theories BECAUSE everyone else avoids it. Treats it like a forbidden zone for content you mention anime once and you're a weeb doesn't matter why you like it. Keep breaking the norm and keep making good vids that stroke out curiosity organ. Love it. Plus anime is a valid form of art medium just like movies shows and theatre in my opinion you always bring out the intrigue in it. Inclusivity to the max. Keep doing what you do.
Wouldn’t she have died more times before mustang tried to kill her?
Dang, guess Envy wasn't the only one getting burned in this episode. Lol
And that is how I became an Immortal extraterrestrial time traveler from the year 4045 BC. So thank you for clarifying why I exist. Incarnation Out, Seeeee Yaaa Peace! Well that and a horrible wish granted by a Horrific Demonic Nai Immortal Mortal with a love of Snakes, to much time on its hands, and a desire to learn everything the Universe has to offer. Also being Banished from death itself also helps, haaa screw you God I annoyed you into giving me Essentially an Infinite lifetime.
Is no one really gonna reference Harry Potter?
Death is the Enemy & Jesus is the Answer. Believe. Simple as that.
But we don't know how many times lust had to regenerate prior the series. So we will never know. :(
This theory is solid, but it doesn't go far enough. Lust's Alchemy Stone is made entirely from a 1 14th component to a human soul, lust. So it stands to reason that she only has the average value from a 1 14th part that is used as a full part. What I mean to say is that Lust doesn't have the full value of a soul because she lacks 13 parts of the 14 part total. Also in FMA they explicitly state that you cannot bring somebody back form the dead because each soul is unique and worth a value of immeasurable energy. Thus it also stands to reason that the compound effect of a full 14 part soul is literal infinite energy. So I devise that the more completed a soul is the more exponential it's energy output can be. I also note that every individuals' ratios of vices and virtues would differ making Lust a combination of the average lust on the 539,000 souls used. This is the plight of splitting a soul. Dumbledore wisely stated that splitting a soul is the result of never examining the value of an intact soul, I'd say the statement stands true in this theory. Enjoyed the video though.
i feel that some day you will figure how the universe was created, whats the purpose of life and ...\ntell me why you don't work for N.A.S.A again?
he called manga comics..
Used a soul eater soul to
That's all well and good, but you have forgotten to take into consideration that Lust may not have been at her 100% health/strength before her death at the hands of Mustang because she was actively carrying out her father's orders beforehand.
Einstein was not a scientist he was was a patent clerk
What about the souls that she already used
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ANIME NOOOOOOOOO
jay you watch one piece
Now I want a Soul Eater theory, or a Steins; Gate one
u failed to factor in how much power she had when he start burning
Dude too slow I've done research on this long before you
since you've doe theories o Pokemo, maye a Digimon thory, since they're commonly compared despite the fact that they're nothing alike
make a theory on Super Mario Logan
These videos are good, stop ruining them with your bad jokes.
But, this is assuming Lust is running on a full tank. Who's to say she started the fight fresh from the soul-station?
I AM FUCKING TRIGGERED, LAST TIME I CHEKED THEY WERE 5$ WTF
Dragon radar? You have 5 million subs just use us.
Could you make an IT theory next? Or maybe a video about how Walter's self repair system works (Alien Covenant)
Don't even need to go to school, watching these videos will make ur IQ go up a CRAP ton.
My soul is worth nothing.
Nonononono.\nIt doesn't recreate the body from pure energy, it recreates it from pretty much atomized atoms. That would have been quite easy to calculate and much much more realistic.
Eh ya forgot the few hundred years that Lust has lived and the times she died before Mustang
The assumption that souls only consist of sins and virtues throws this way off. It would be better to estimate the size of Lust's stone vs. the size of Father, since Father is one massive living stone.
A few counter arguments... What about any regenerations done before? And what about the energy upkeep of the body itself? (Lust has been around for a long time) Also, would there be any energy bleed?
If you are planning to make a movie theory on an anime, please do consider doing one on Neon Genesis Evangelion\nYou will need quite the research on this one though
But isn't the energy based on mass? Wouldn't that mean that each soul calculates a different energy due to a different mass. The only constant in E=mc^2 is the speed of light, meaning that there is no way that all the souls have the same energy.
Matpat make a theory on Kingsman: The Golden Circle
film theory? more like anime theory!
But I thought that it was established that the worth of Al's soul was the equivilant to Ed's arm, as shown in the final episode when Al sacrifices himself to give Ed BAck his arm......so....
The dislikes are probbly people who watch the anime
He did not just call manga comics
The soul is priceless!\n\n*LATEST NEWS 📰 CELEBRITY GOSSIP 🗣 AND MEDIA HYPE 📺EVERYDAY!*\n\n*LIKE, COMMENT AND SUBSCRIBE FOR BRAND NEW TRENDING CONTENT ON MY CHANNEL DAILY! 📢*
weight isn't measured in kg mass is weight is measured in newtons (N)
Didn't you already do this with undertale?... I know it's not the same thing but it kind of is
not all souls have the same value xD...Lord Gaben is worth  3*half life souls
Who else got slightly triggered when he called the manga a comic XD lmao, still love him though!
The entire point of the complex moral undertones and subplots throughout the story is to teach you that there is nothing in the physical world equivalent to a human soul. It is priceless. Your theory is wrong because you ignored the somewhat obvious tone of the story.
your voice is really annoying now
@matpat have u watched one piece???
Probably not a lot :/
WRONG WRONG WRONG\n1. You have to account for the amount of soul energy used to keep something alive longer than it should be.\n2. Not all homunculi's philosophers stones have the same amount of soul's. Wrath's stone had only one soul (and subsequently didn't regenerate from injury). Envy's real body is huge and took more attacks from Mustang. \n3. Half her weight? Does that include her clothes? Are you sure only half her body is burned each time? What about the first time Mustang attacked her with the water from the pipes?\n4. Wrath's stone gave him the ultimate eye, or did it? I don't know if it's mentioned in the anime or not if they stones give homunculi their abilities or if thats the result of taking that aspect from someone's personality. Either way you have to add that to the equation.\n\nInstead of using Lust for this video you should have used Envy because during (his/her) return you can see exactly how many zombies are absorbed
Follows the original comics? COMICS ITS MANGA NOT COMICS
This whole theory is completely broken as soon as it started. It's impossible to calculate exactly how many souls are within Father because he's been getting more and more Philosopher's Stones over 400 years, he absorbed and rebirthed Greed and EVERY SINGLE ONE of the Homunculi, including Lust, were fatally wounded many times before any one of them were fully depleted.\nThis theory is inherently flawed by your lack of knowledge of the series' canon. Try harder.
The final worth of a soul is off because you would have to count in how many times Lust died or remade herself before Roy Mustang got to her.
1:59\n\nWait wait wait\n\nSay that again?\n\n'Comic?' coMIC?!\n\nIT'S MANGA MATPAT\n\nMANGA!!
Noo matpat We dont know if her philosopher stone is fresh or about done anyway
Hello MatPat, your number might be a little inaccurate.\n\nIf we are using Lust as a basis, we should also consider all the other times that she had to use her philosopher's stone to regenerate her body. Moments before Mustang incinerated her, Hawkeye shot her senseless until Hawkeye ran out of bullets. Before that, Mustang also shot her a few times, and she opened up her own chest to reveal the philosopher's stone. After that, Mustang tried to rip her stone out. Her body decomposed and she regenerated a new one from a single blood vessel. Even before that, Maes Hughes stabbed her in the forehead. I think we should consider that those regenerations would also consume souls from her Philosopher's Stone. Unless Philosopher's Stones recharge to max over time...
I'll be honest.. I don't want my soul gone.
what happened to the frame by frame videos ?
My soul is actually worth three Chic-fil-A chicken sandwiches.
Pls do part 3 from doctor who
Uhm, Mustang flamed Lust's ass 10 times. Remember, when he disintegrated her ass and got heavily wounded by underestimating her? Plus he ripped out her Philosopher's Stone out of her chest and she immediately turned to dust. That's 11 times she was completely deaded.
When he burns lust, he isn't destroying her atoms itself though. That would require he use the equal energy of 19 hydrogen bombs just to destroy her. And he didn't have a philosophers stone. What he was doing is breaking bonds within lust's molecules. Her mass is conserved, it isn't being broken down into pure energy. So you would have to calculate the energy needed to break the molecular bonds within lust, water would be the highest value, as you add energy to turn water within the body to steam. Then you would have to look up other bond values for fats, tissues bone, etc. once you find the energy needed to basically cremate a human body, you multiply it by 9 for every time he incinerates her, then you have the correct energy value. Matpat's logic was that when he burns lust, he destroys the very atom itself turning it into a slew of protons, neutrons, and electrons and energy. values to break apart the atom itself is extremely high, which is where the big numbers come into play, the Hiroshima bomb only successfully destroyed .7g of atoms of uranium out its 7kg uranium payload. That little mass released a huge amount of energy, however not enough to fully release its maximum potential energy. Bottom line, there would be no way he could safely nor effectively transfer that amount of energy to destroy lust in such a way.
Wrath has way less than a 14th remember he can't regen because he only has 1 life
At least this one isn't sponsored by crunchyroll. As long as you show sincere interest, all those bigoted otaku can go die of heart attacks.

Macklemore just gave me hope for modern day rap
a faggot
dangi remember when the first song i heard by him was thrift shop and i didnt know who he was but know he is on my top 10 raper list
Wacklemore and his success go hand in hand with the downfall of legit hip hop music.
I'm cheap, motherfucker, and I don't tip. Like most rich people, he virtue signals about how much he cares for the poor and downtrodden but can't be fucked to put his money where his mouth is. I'm sure they just left it out of the article he read about it.
Watch Vsauce 3 Video here – Do it now!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d9i_0Ty7Cg  : )

its all about probability, if we exists this long, its all because it is the most probable thing to happen, this apply to any scale of time if one second or the infinite time scale between that one second and non at all
Why is there a guy in this video... Can we just have 100% animation?

that's a good gaming pc
Assumption 1 is trivially false: a simulated consciousness would either be really conscious, and therefore a real consciousness, or would not be a consciousness at all. So you could argue (as skeptics have done since antiquity) that the world you perceive is unreal, but arguing you yourself are unreal, or simulated, or epiphenomenal, or whatever, is self-contradictory nonsense.\nThe other assumptions are just fashionable verbiage for sci-fi fans. Get over it. Nothing to see here.
I wonder if at a certain point of time when we're advanced enough, we can test if we're in a simulation by doing bogus stuff to crash the simulation.
I think an ant would understand standing in line lol
What if there's a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation?
Of all the simulations to get stuck in, I'm in one where superpowers don't exist, but racism does.
If we are being simulated, would our creators really want us to ever find out we're in a simulation? Maybe creating speculative videos like this is as far as we're allowed to dig into the truth before they pull the plug on us for figuring out too much. \nIt would be like Deadpool in the Marvel universe, he KNOWS he's just a comic book character, could we really deal with finding out that we are just Sims?
Bruh it's so stupid this vid is so baf
We are simulations and the creator is god
So when humans are able to simulate a universe identical to ours, Will it be a simulation in simulation?
I've always wondered if we are really just something like puppets ever since I was 4...
normally i enjoy your videos, but i would like to say this video wasn't as gud, i felt it was trying a bit too hard to be mind blowing, with the random pauses in sentences, and i think maybe showing real humans explain this made it a bit out of your style. pls be careful when working with things and changes like this in the future, if this matters to you. thank you
when you compair us we ants, you dont take into account that we are actually looking for ways to communicate with other living things in our world... we want to find ways to communicate with our dogs or w/e... when we met the indians its not like we went oooh just let them be... there were people that wanted to communicate with those primitive people, there were people who wanted to take their sources in order to  make money, there were people who wanted to christianize them etc... so to think that these higher beings, first of all lack individuality and NOBODY would ever be bored enough or curious enough or w/e to spend a min with us, its a bit simpleminded...
What if you were simulated?\n.... well, if I was, then I will go to work tomorrow. I'll wake up in the morning, eat breakfast, go on my irritating commute, and continue to live my life as I've always have. Because even my simulated life has been a life, and even if I find out about its illusion it needs to continue on.
Reality is an illusion the universe is a hologram buy gold bye
But what if even logic isn't 'real' to beings in a higher scale? None of your argument would make sense.
time to fuck some shit up cause i'm in a simulation and nothing matters
why would you assume that the real universe would be anything like our simulated universe? It may be a higher dimension were way more complex computers exist. Also the computer wouldn't need to calculate us at real time. It could take a billion years to calculate a single step but to the simulated universe it would feel normal.
Answering the fundamental questions of existentialism through science ❤️
Does this video make Kurzgesagt... Neo..? Or Morpheus..?
You're inside a simulation inside a simulation, inside an even bigger simulation
But what kind of graphics card am I running and I'm on 4K quality so many questions mate shit.....and I feel kind of weird knowing I did some weird shit in my life maybe knowing someone's watching me
A simulation broke my heart
Just a thing to think about. If this were to be a simulation than this video would be simulated so all the points in this video will probably lead to a dead end as the whatever is simulating us will probably not want to know that they are simulating us therefore this video would be utter Bull.
The real question is does this even matter?
Why not just actively simulate 1 consciousness (me) and the others only when I interact with them? That would cut ammount of needed computations by almost 0,2 bimillions. (Yes, bimillions, that's millions squared.)\nBTW, that reminds me Human Music.
So I guess if you die the simulation is over
I find this theory reckless and irresponsible at best. It's based on five assumptions that cannot be tested, yet it's being treated by commenters like it should have some impact on their mental well being or life in general. Clean your room and sort your self out instead of worrying about wether or not you are in a simulation. We need you to be responsible down here on Earth and work with us to build a better future. Some people are joking about killing themselves. You are as real as you are willing to pursue meaning in your life. We need you to help us build tomorrow. If we aren't truly real, whatever that means, we can find that out together after we stop war and end hunger on the planet.
I find it retarded, because if we could think that we are simulation it would mean the simulation would be faulty.
We're all just rolling around on this planet loving life
And maybe the Simulators are just simated.
How do u explain going to the moon?
Does this mean I'm not a real boy?
Wait, if only one Simulation Crashed Then That means, If his theory is true then the universe would not have crashed only a Portion of it then before another one can crash lots of more simulations could be created and if the people running the simulation could pause simulations after they crashed then create new ones with the exact same things and people at the same time of the old one then we could have infinite lives if we are a simulation.
I don't like using real world people in the videos. It seems really out of character for you guys and takes away from the experience in my opinion.
If I'm in a simulation why would they put this video in the simulation
Anyone else bothered by 6:40 to 6:54?
Isnt there a group of scientist that is trying to glitch something?
the weird side of youtube
*They see this video* THEY'RE BECOMING SELF AWARE SHUT IT DOWN. What if we are the matrix?
12 months loading screen, 18 years of tutorial and finally you get 42 years of play time if you didn't fuck up in the tutorial.
If i'm simulated, then I know that is possible to teleport. If i'm not, then I knoow that is impossible to teleport.
There is Science and also, alas, masturbation masquerading as Science. I haven't a dickens of an idea as to which of the two this video belongs. And reading enough of the comments below convinces me that I am in good company.
why is josuke higashikata in the video?
wait intil they add mod support for our universe
Sounds like National Geographic Channel's show Year Million :)
You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and Kurzgesagt will show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
But we ARE creations, we have been created by God!
I like how he says at the end why u still here? Awesome video
Would it really matter if someone tripped over the power cable,? Not to be like, edgy or anything but if all consciousness ended simultaneously there wouldn't have been a point to any effort. Nobody would survive so nobody would perceive the post-nothingness. There literally would be no point.
dose this mean i can kill a lot of people now ? - saudia arabia here i come
i would think a sufficiently advanced civilization would know how to restore from a backup.
Simulation and Reality are subjective terms. Their meaning is relative to your position and perspective.
How the frick do you simulate food?
tripping over the power cable would be nothing if the simulation software would save every split second\nthe worst that could happen is it going back a split second
i don't like if Kurzgesagt involve real human in the video, just make it fully animated
I don't see why condition 1 is necessary; to simulate a universe you only need to simulate a single conscious being (the experiencer), the rest of the population could just be simpler programs, based on the amount of interaction.
If you can question your reality then you are real case closed im tired of this being in my recommendations
The question are we real is not a scientific question meaning it can't be answered using a scientific investigation.
Dark side of youtube.
This is quite boring.
Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?
i wonder if the computer is mac or windows
If this is a simulation. Why would the makers make this.
But the again, how do you define reality?
♪♫*Tell me it's real, the feeling that we feel\nTell me that it's real\ndon't love come just, to pass us by*♪♫

Say What? HAHAHA HAHAHAHA
We are sims
now ending universe...
3:29 That Hitchhikers guide reference XD
Nothing is real. Everything is fake. Trump is a clown and you are a retard. \n\nGo fuck yourself.
this is a lot like how it is with video games. When you are in the world, not everything needs to be rendered. Only the things that you are seeing at the moment and the things that will affect you
3:33 I believe that is supposed to say 3e+42, it believes you made a slight mistake there Kurzgesagt.
This was three years ago the people who didn't know were retarded not to know
Has science gone to far?
What about the mathematical PI theory supposedly dissproving this theory....I would have like you guys to explore points against this theory
Aren’t you kind of assuming that the same laws of physics apply to the real world? Maybe that universe is vastly larger and can handle all the things that happen in our universe.
We might be getting to that point where a video on why the earth is not flat would be acceptable.
We probably aren't in a simulation because no glitches of humans or other inanimate objects have occured, and our technology is not advanced enough to create a supercomputer that can create a human simulation looking as realistic as reality. The VR Headset, no matter how hard the creators make video games look realistic, it is not exactly as realistic as what real life, living humans look like.
If we are a simulation than who simulated the simulator who simulated us?
So....the person controlling you....made a video about us in a Simulation?\n\n\n\n\nSCIENCE!
This was two women. Saying an AWFUL lot of words. Which could have just been summed up by saying Be yourself. Yourself is good enough. And let's make ordinary? Extra ordinary. Love you lots xxx
I really enjoyed this girls. You both speak an awful lot of sense. Still always going to love a sun flare though.
This quote really sprung to mind for this video and it's one that has stuck with me and helped me a lot...\n\nThe reason we struggle with insecurities is because we compare our behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
A podcast by Louise and Emma would just be the best thing 😍
He's fit isn't he😂
“i already have this mug” *goes to put it back in the back* 😭😂
Love this, well said ladies!!, it's so true about the word kids, I've always said it, but find myself lately saying children in an accent that just doesn't suit me :-D
Well I am in my matalan pyjamas on my bed after eating a huge portion of stir fry in my slightly untidy room which I tidied last week. And I am really enjoying my jolly self (-:
I loved what Emma said about how normal isn't just 'white mums in their 30s' - was such an inclusive and validating statement that addressed the lack of diversity in the mum online community.
I’ve always been the “plain Jane” simple, non fashionable mum. I’m proud of that now, whereas before it was a huge paranoia issue for me. Xxx
I love you two together 😂 Emma is such a legend! Had a bit of a rubbish day and just got into the bath and started watching this, was immediately cheered up by ooh he's fit isn't he 😂 xxx
My favorite saying is, I don't want to wear real clothes.  I dress myself decently when I have to do things at my kid's school or if I am leaving the house.  Otherwise, I am wearing yoga pants and a shirt.  I have 5 kids, and I can certainly agree that life is never perfect.  We are normal people here too.  My other favorite saying is, you either get hair or makeup.  I like the idea of just being the average person.
I love your vlogs together.! More vids together. Pretty please?
This video cheered me right up after a bad day of headaches and other health crap. \nI have a friend who is over from Australia. Being disabled and having chronic fatigue, sometimes my house is far from instagram worthy. She always talks me she's come to see me, not the house. \nI might just have to start thinking about starting/ restarting my blog, and start vlogging. I know so many people in the same situation as myself, and we all discuss how there isn't really anything or anyone out there telling it like it is. Today's normal is being in bed since lunchtime, lots of co-codamol and sleep in my oldest and most comfortable nighty. Tomorrow's normal might (hopefully) see me in my craft room making a bespoke greetings card. On Sunday evening, we are off to see Suzanne Vega in concert. Normal is such a diverse range of scenarios, depending on your view point.
My normal right now is eating hummus with my finger! I was dipping crisps but ran out of crisps and still wanted more hummus.
Haha an example of my normal yesterday was my toddler running round clutching a box of tampons, as she wanted a snack! Note: tampons aren't a usual snack! 😂😂
I did not know what to expect from this title but this was very enjoyable and comforting!
Loved seeing Emma in your videos recently, totally relate to her personality 😂. I've had to subscribe to her! 💗
good video my daughter has the same mug
Bloody love this vid!! I wanna be friends with you both lol x
Wow I love this so much. I'm a nanny and I follow lots of nanny pages on instagram that post these BEAUTIFUL pictures of themselves wearing nice, trendy clothes and taking their nanny kids (who are impeccably dressed with their hair beautifully done) on expensive and exciting outings where they somehow manage to get the kids to sit still and all look at the camera at the same time. Meanwhile I'm over here with my yoga pants and frizzy ponytail which gets drizzled throughout the day from having stuffed animals rubbed on top of my head, and the living room floor is covered in train track pieces and race cars and dinosaurs and the three year old is wearing one of only three articles of clothing I can get her to wear - almost always her Elsa dress or her Sophia dress - and they're arguing about buckled treble seatbelt faster in the car.  Nannying is a lot like motherhood: it never looks as perfect as people make it out to be, but I LOVE my job and I love my girls, even when it's very, very average. ❤️❤️❤️
If im being honest, i dont really like the look perfect looking people, they kind of remind me of dolls. im sorry perfect looking people, you are still beautiful but i guess i'd just prefer uhh lets say dodie clark over kylie jenner? like they are both pretty but a different kind of pretty
Love this love you guys together love the message
Why is this on trending?
l'm loving your sit-chatty videos and loving todays chat❤
You 2 together are just bloody awesome xxx
do you pay to get on trending or something?
All have a look at Brene Brown on You Tube, most popular Ted Talk of all time. She says the same thing.I am enough is her mantra, gratitude is her way of life.
Words all of the words 😂
my Instagram bio is; a random selection of things I see, things I do and when I feel like it also my face. it's as real as it gets posting literally when I see things I like, when I go and do things, and when I think I look nice of funny a picture of myself. sometimes I post daily sometimes weekly annd other times it takes a month and it's all okay.
I love your pink hair so much omyyy😍🙆
I love this video and the message behind it! You girls are fantastic\n\nBig Hugs and Kisses xoxo Sharon
omg the pink hair is such a throwback!
I love you both such inspirations and amazing for keeping it real xx
YES MY LIFE IS COMPLETE.
Louise I think you should name your baby Ayla it’s very unique and not many people have it also not to mention it sounds very cute with the name Darcy!\nAyla and Darcy!!
Confidence comes from within and my mother always told me , no one is better than you - they can be the same as you but not better .. i have never felt less than because of this and I am raising my daughters the same.  my house is neat because i have OCD that's me.. you are messy that's you . i don't judge and normal is used incorrectly.  don't judge me because you are insecure or feeling less than.
Oh my god I LOVE THESE TWO SO MUCH.
Feeling super anxious at the moment but this video was really comforting thank you
Love this, honestly made me feel so much better
This is amazing! I live for little chatty videos like this. I feel like I'm sitting there with you joining in with your conversation. Keep up the great videos Louise! 😊💕
is that a british thing? does kids sound more unpolished or lower class than children? i'm genuinely curious. i sensed a mutual understanding between the two of them that suggested it was a cultural thing.
Lost it at “my face isn’t pregnant” 😂😂
I could've watched 3 hours of this, tbh.
Really ladies think you are just doing anything to get a vlog out !!!!
You have the prettiest eye colour!
Any other mums wish Louise was in your mummy group ?!
Yr friend is lovely just my sorta person bubbly like my self x
Grey blazer and that hair. LIFE
This is such an empowering and inspiring video ladies 💕 I love it. It's okay to be normal ✨
Love this. This is what my whole mantra is: you do you. Oxox
This cracked me up so much 😂 I love you two ❤️ such fun for this Friday!
i heart you two! <3
My normal is bed with 9 chicken nuggets sat on my breasts. In a box. Obvs.
watching your videos is my after-college treat.. so relaxing!!
Emma: Take a picture of yourself right now\nMe: Im in the bath! 😂\nI love you both so much 💗😇
Excellent video from excellent ladies. Thank you for putting this up.
I love Emma so much😻
Completely agree! Love you both!
i love both of you just the way you are! dont change 😊
Aw fucking love you two! Average is so good!
I could watch a good couple of hours of you just talking about random crap Louise
Louise and Emma I really bloody loved this video. More of you two chatting inspirational bollocks❤️
As a mom of three kids, four dogs, and a full time RN.....I just love stuff like this. My house is often a huge mess even though I am constantly cleaning. There's just not enough time in the day for everything to be perfect all the time! And I love y'all together! I have tons of ordinary pictures on my Instagram kimi_lynn if you want to check them out! Lol
Aww you could really see the friendship between you two here 😊
I love Emma! She's so funny but also down to earth.
Thanks for the advice that I needed mom's😁
I LOVE the message of this video 🙌🏻🙌🏻
How many weeks pregnant are you?? Xx
I just sent my insta normal pic to you louise :) im rendori1701
I watched this video tucked up in bed with a galaxy hot chocolate and marshmallows and it really cheered me up because I have laryngitis and feel like crap! X
I'm getting better about comparing myself to others but 100% yes to all of this!!
I wish I had an Emma, or at least a friend as great as Emma. I just have a dog that gives me a shady side eye when I talk to her, or glances at me judgingly when I have ice cream for dinner.
very good points and all but sometimes louise is so out of touch that I can't take her seriously.
True, there are no painting walls in Birmingham 😂😂
Thank you so much for making this I love the bit where your talking about social media and not caring about what people think. I found it really inspiring x
I love it be the average person ❤️
i just think people can take me as they find me but that doesnt mean that i dont make an effort to look nice sometimes and other times i dont have the time to make an effort. i have a baby at 19 so i think ive grown up fast and not only that who have i got to impress? xxx
Currently sat on my break at matalan 😂 love chatty videos like this
Love the lipstick Louise! Is it the Mac teddy lipstick you mentioned in your outifit diary? It suits your hair perfectly. Love the colour of the cardigan as well with the lippy and haircolour.
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 you amazing women!!
Complete nonsense
I did pink hair!!!
I needed this
loved it!
Love your work, ladies!
Watching this while folding laundry ❤️
Omg Louise ur hair is GORG !!😸✨🌸💖
a very nice chat :)
all the hearts!
Love this
Loved this ❤️😂
❤️❤️❤️
Love your videos!
HI LOUISE! <3
Procrastinating sleep rn 😁
GORGGGG😍
Let's not forget gurrrrrrls - you are the exception to the rule. Most of us norms don't give a crap what brands think. Cos we have normal jobs and use social media to BE SOCIAL. You know. Like actual normal folk.
😂, Marcus needs to watch the start😂😂
Do not offend the hunger games famdom😡
Only 1 minute😢 I really want more real
What words of wisdom ? You just cut her off tf !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
:/ I wanted to hear the rest *^*
Dang Tamera's hair style thoooo
When are they gonna upload the whole segments like Wendy Williams? 😒 Just upload the damn thing.
haters only have a problem with certain interracial couples. e.g.\na black man with a white woman rarely gets any hate.\nbut a black woman with a white man brings on a lot of hate.\nit's pathetic.
i swear i adore tamera 😍 she's honestly such an inspiration to me she's​ such a strong independent woman a great mother and brilliant wife like she's so wise and intelligent she teaches young girls like me that being intelligent and having morals and being classy is sexy as a 16 year old girl I think she should be a role model to any young girl she's my sista sista 😂❤👏
Teach em mama
Dang, Tamera looks so good! 😍
I like how she made the point that she heard racist stuff from both white people AND black people. Some people swear that black people can't be racist.
This is the kind of girl chat I was looking forward to this season but these seconds long video urgggg stopppp
she is biracial so no matter she dates black or white its still going be an interracial relationship anyway....
Im in an interracial relationship and I can relate to tamera and adam when it comes to people saying racist things on both sides. It really takes ALOT of love to overcome all of the hate in the world.
I don't really understand why her mom would be against it since she married a white man?? And I know it's because they had a hard time but if she chose him for love then wouldn't she trust Tamera also chose Adam that way.
Haha Loni is making sure they stay right on schedule! 0:45 Thirty seconds
Even if she married a black man, wouldn't it still be interracial?
You guys are ridiculous with these clips... you didn't even let us hear the end of her sentence. This is not gonna make more people tune in to the live show... people work and don't have the luxury to record shows!!! HELLO!!
people in the comments section be so annoying, I swear yall always want to fight
love Tamara in white
Jasmine curry: I agree with you about tamera. She's an honest woman and very classy. I love her words of wisdom, and although I'm not in an interracial relationship,  I'm married to a black man. I can understand where her mother was coming from, BUT, I also believe that as a woman, or man, it shouldn't matter what race the person is that you love. If that person treats you with respect and loves you unconditionally,  a mom or dad should respect that.
this was real disrespectful, y’all couldn’t let Tamera finish her story tho 😩😭
Her mom is right. Some white men are fake and only want to experiment being with a black or Asian girl and not actually take it seriously. Her mother was just being protective. Tired of these 30 second videos though. Glad I unsubbed
I love The Real and I've been watching since the begging here on YouTube cause I can't see it on my tv in Brazil, but now the videos are too short and out of context...what's happening? I wanna see the real talk, their opinions, their beliefs and their discussion about something and not only two sentences
ok, i need to see the rest NOW!!!!!!!
If you going to show us short clips the least you can do is let Tam finish her sentence 🤦🏽‍♀️
dang, y'all couldn't even give us a full minute?
Wow I Felt This One
She's already biracial so either way it would be an interacial relationship! So why when you are biracial black is ok but white no?? Why does the black takes over the white??? (Because of the one drop rule??)
Tamara put love before what people thought. .like every should! Go Tamera
What does adam do to stop white supremacy? I am asking for a friend
Tamera looks so pretty
I refuse to date/marry outside my race.
Why are the videos coming out so short?!
that last part is dope
I'm so confused is this the episode that aired today? Because this isn't what I saw on tv. Can someone please explain that to me.

Are Tameras parents still together?
Amen to that
It's freaking 2017, are people really still bitching about interracial relationships???
UPLOAD FULL CLIPS
💗💗💗💗💗
Awww 😢😢❤
Yes! I love Fri-Yays
So i know the main news os Kylie is pregnant BUT I THINK Adrienne is pregnant too!!... U heard it from me first lol
O my goodness! Tamera is not talking about her children! ...(no shade intended)
Fox News (Adam's employer) have regularly had hosts say interracial marriages are wrong........
Lol her mom sounds super narrow minded. Is she forgetting that Tamera is half white??? Ridiculous! Your own people are the ones who create racism (this applies to every race, mostly)
ADAM ADAM ADAM BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BORING!! 😴😴😴😴😴
She's such a good mom
I woulda said “Mom can you get me a puppy”\nBUT NOOOO\nMy mom be like “mOm cAn yOu gEt mE a pUpPy”
I'm sick and I just puked
Wish my mom did this 😪🙁
Spaghetti tacos are proof that she has smart kids
Why can't I have this mom............
Smh this why white kids cuss they parents out
Do their kids watch I Carly
This video makes me cry... (Don't know why) I want to say this video is the Best!! Thank you!
Hey mom, can you show me your vagina?
I would ask for Nike shoes, Nike clothing, clothing, Starbucks, go to knots berry farm, a phone and a MacBook. Lmao 😂
I would say hey mom can we go to Disney land TODAY
MOM CAN I GET 100$??\nN- Yes.....\n\nIll be like that😂
Are we just not gonna talk about the spaghetti tacos, icarly?
What if he asked for beer
I wish I was as good as those kids
mom can i watch you have sex with my dad\n\nuhh what no!!! ur grounded !\n\nu just broke the challenge
Bringing children to work once in s blue moon is not only good for them and you, but important for colleagues.
WHO ELSE THOUGHT OF ICARLY WHEN THEY SAID SPAHGETTI TACOS😭🙋
Sometimes outside of the box is totally cool
I feel like with the whole don't say no thing, people mostly mean that you can deny your child something, but you would need to do it in a way where you use other words.
Ur lucky ur not dealing with teenagers
Is she working at BuzzFeed??
imagine if they asked for like a new house
Hii mom! Can i fly to korea and never return and you would pay for my living expenses everyday
I think it's bad to do that because then the child can become a brat or think they can get anything they want. My friends mom always says yes and now she ALWAYS wants everything her way. She ONLY eats pizza! Nothing else.
This is so cute
Once I read the title, Well she spent 100s of dollars
Lol, that is not a good idea.
I'm disappointed I haven't seen comments on the spaghetti tacos. Icarly, Spencer?
I LOVE your hair!!! It's so beautiful!!
Why I shall NEVER EVERRRRRRRRR have kids
If I was then I would say mom can we go and buy the whole of toys r us
I would ask to go to the most fun and expensive place! And I would ask for a phone and a drone.
Next do It again, but in a month
I think mom mom is doing the only say NO challenge who agrees lol
I want a spaghetti tacos sound so good
she seems like a great mother
honestly dont let the kids have starbucks lmao. I'm young but im used to caffeine so like im a mutant to coffee
Mom can i drink that bleach?\n\n\n*YES*
Her kids are so cute 💕
Spaghetti noodles, so iCarly. I have been saying I want to make them forever and surprise my sons with them.
This video was well formed. Hannah makes a great working parent. I have learnt a lot of stuff just  from watching this particular video.
My lord your life sounds dull.
Ladies and gentleman, white people
Hey mom can you give me every apple product that exists?\n\nNot doing this challenge anymore
Dyed highlights and treating a coffee cup as a fashion accessory? Sounds just like Buzzfeed to me.
Imagine if they were teenagers...
Why did this video make me want children?
If your kids were 10-15 years old he/she would ask u to buy expensive stuff

New drinking game: Take a shot every time Jack says nice.
I came for the video and stayed for the comments.
Unacceptable! Gordon did you just use canned tomatoes?? BLOODY HELL NO
Anyone notice how Pre-recorded these are? Like Jack in this video is like 10-11-12? And he's 17 right now......and this was posted YESTERDAY

Not everything that has two cheeks is a face... ;-)
Gordon your forehead has almost as many creases as my nutsack.
Gordon doesn't care if his son is gay, but if he goes vegetarian Gordon will disown him.
He seems to have a little addiction to olive oil. A touch? Thats much for me, a touch is like 2 or 3 drips for me.\nAnd his son talks just like him.He only needs RAW and IDIOT in his Vocabulary then hes perfect.
he really went over the top with his fucking olive oil here
I don't even like half the shit he makes but it sure as hell gets me hard
His son must be bullied at school when his classmates watch these videos
Gordon teaching *FOOD PORN* to his son.
i really want gordon to cook me dinner one time,
D O N T B E C H E E K Y
WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE
None of his children seem to care about cooking in these videos that he does with them.  It's sad really, if he were my Dad, I'd try and do everything with him.
What's the stock you're using?
_N I C E_
I bet half the viewers are watching this on the toilet
Why did I think this was a disstrack thumbnail ._.
do you also teach him how to fart on someone's face to project yourself as an outstanding cook?
Since he pinched jacks cheeks for every beef cheek i thiught he was gonna pinch his ass for the third one
Remember Kids always rub your meat on your sons cheeks before you start

Ben Shapiro completely debunks the Jimmy Kimmel lie.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es1QSUbwfOU
I pray to the circus gods this idiot Jimmy Kimmel is publicly raped by a gang of nightmare clowns.
Schummer should have given correct info to you.
Dude seems a bit tipsy. Well I guess it is a late show.
If Jimmy is so sure that hes got the facts and he knows what hes talking then why not get a republican senator on the show or tucker carlson to talk about it? oh yeah cause he would get stomped on live tv
NEW CURRY SHOES ON MY CHANNEL!🏀💦
He's doing more to bring to light about American Health Care than most of you or American politicians are doing to inform you ask the public your representatives are feeling you guys
We just need a healthcare system like France has. Just copy them. Doctors get free medical school, in turn they made about a 1/2-1/3 of what they make in America... this ensures there are plenty of doctors with low costs. Everyone pays for healthcare but it's radically cheaper. American healthcare is just too expensive as is. We really need to just study what France does and copy everything as closely as possible to lower healthcare expenses. Healthcare should be a basic human right... not a luxury only the wealthy get to enjoy. France has the best healthcare system in the world according to the World Health Organization. There is no reason why America can't aspire to be better.
What happened to late night TV? At the end of the day, just before I close my eyes, the last thing I want to see and hear about are the problems in Washington. Everything on TV from Jimmy to football to the average sitcom is pushing an agenda. What happened? Why not give people a place to go to get away from the BS in Washington that we hear about all day everyday.
Why would I listen to a comedian talk show host about politic's? Especially one who get's his talking points directly from Chuck Shumer. Kimmel has become a shameless political mouthpiece. It's disgusting. It's disturbing really.
How does it FEEL to Get Bent Over By Schumer and the BEST PART is You did not Even Get LUBE............ FING DB
Jimmy Kimmel works for ABC.  He doesn’t have ACA
Jimmy Kimmel - makes over 50 million a year and complains his son doesn't get free healthcare.
SUCKERS!  Led to the slaughter and have not a clue!  The medical industry sit down at their executive tables trying to figure out how to bring in every loose dollar in the country.  They want it all and they want it paid. They want more and more citizens to be on chronic medications for life.  They know Americans will listen to a do whatever they say without questioning anything.  \n\nHere's a question one needs to ask.  With all the money that has been donated for cancer research and it is too large to even post here, the results are in!  NO CURE FOUND.  Cancer cases have increased as fast as the research and treatment money has been coming in.  The CEO's make millions for their efforts.  And cancer patients spend their entire lives taddaaa!!! on medications!  By a cure I mean a way to eliminate it or at least we should be seeing fewer cases.  But in fact more money thrown at something-more cases of the disease.   and people don't question anything.  They just keep being sheep led to the slaughter.
I feel bad for his son hope he gets better
This is what is accepted as a news authority.....a comedian.
Healthcare is not a right.
I don't understand why talk show hosts, comedians, are pushing their agenda and views to their audience.  Why don't they just shut up and entertain like their supposed to?
Who signed and voted for Obama care? Back then they passed the bill without even reading what was being passed.... Seen those people celebrate their victory when it was passed... How quick people forget...
Hey jimmy how bout you write the bill
This is embarrassing. He should have Ben Shapiro on.
so now comedy has become politically correct and Kimmel is now a political show  ?
Hey jimmy saw where Ben Shapiro ripped your healthcare rant apart. Best to leave real issues to those that are smarter and better informed. Stick to your night job and if you truly want to live under socialism,  then I suggest you move to socialistic country. Preferably Germany you'll love it there, they think your so funny
jerks aqre jerks.... people who believe that they have a God-given right to take money out of the hands of working men and women and give it to other people who do not work while keeping a percentage for themselves, those people are the real jerks ... and there are far too many of them ....
hi jimmy did you read the holy book of quran, i bet you dont and i recomend you to do because it a most book that telling people to think and use there mind , if your presedent trump fellowup the  quran teaching  i thing he will change his behaviour , please dont judge a book from behevior of its people , and exuse me if there are many miss-spilled words
5 mins in waiting on a joke thats funny.\nwell theres one that senator just got a zinger in there.
If the president of the US is allowed to make a fool out of himself and act like a comedian then tell me why this comedian can't take on the role of a politician???
People going to  POLICITAL youtube channels  and hollywood for reasoning and life decisions.... How is this not brainwashing? What happened to not believing what you see on the T.V.?......
In the news this morning. He was fed talking points from crying Chuck and the rest of the Democrats. Never even asked the Republicans about the bill. Ratings. Told ya so.
Obama care is affordable for people who cannot afford healthcare, in order for that to happen people like me who work hard for a living are paying nearly double what we paid before, seems fair to me, more like involuntary welfare  funding...
Stick to something you know about Jimmy like girls jumping on trampolines
Kimmel isn't researching healthcare, he's being coached by Chuck Schumer on how to oppose the bill. Idiots like kimmel are why 180 million Americans are going to lose their private healthcare when the government rolls out single payer. We will lose our coverage, prices will go up and quality of care will drop like a rock. \n\nWhen you have months to wait for care thanks to single payer, remember to thank Jimmy Kimmel for your suffering.
Obamacare works for some, doesn't for all, it needs lots of work. Good for low  income, others it cost to much doesn't cover enough or not at all.Obamacare is not all that, period Jimmy Kimbell doesn't even use Obamacare I bet
Kimmel went too far with the Melania and Ivanka joke. It would be a shame to see him follow the path of Kathy Griffin.
I like how something like people trying to stay alive longer and taking care of their family is such a controversial issue
Jimmy don't sorry bout the hate comments. I just don't know if u can stop this on your own.
Political puppet for Chuck the schmuck. Repeating talking points of RINO schumer. You used to be funny, now your just a punk being used by the establishment for social engineering.  Jimmy want a cracker?
Kimmel is not nearly as funny when he gets political. People tune in to unplug from the seriousness of every day life.\n\nIn my opinion, he should use his platform/fame to share his ideals, but keep the show light.
Damn this song is deep ; soundcloud.com/meezygod/pnp
Jimmy used to be funny, until he got all political.
instead of removing Obama Care why not try to improve so that both sides may benefit.
No expansion on healthcare. Expansion  on war, yes indeed.
Jimmy used to have a pretty equal show but it looks like he finally sold his soul to the Deep state
Hey, remember when comedians use to tell jokes?
Thanks, Jimmy. Glorious rant! I will remember alligator into a strip-club forever!
This is a late night comedy show. I have to keep reminding myself of that because it’s getting harder and harder to tell.
It doesn't work.
Grandfather frequency separate form someone historically forty.
I didn't know Brian Scotto had a late night show.
PLEASE stick with comedy Jimmy!!!
Jimmy just masterfully presented this critical issue that's being shoved down our throats. This bill is to appease us, no, the insurance companies and their under-writers. These insurers are in the business to deny deny and so is the US gov since they are in bed with each other. Excellent job of getting the point across and still being Jimmy funny.
The problem with healthcare has nothing to do with insurance or some policy that some politician has failed at including Obama AND Trump.  Until the pricing for services is under control nothing will change. How much does it cost if you break your arm and go to the ER? No one can answer that question: If you're on Medicaid it costs x, if you have one insurance company it cost 20x, another insurance company might be 30x... and no insurance? Try 200x.  Hospitals have no published pricing and can basically charge you for whatever they want to at any price they want. This is the problem - 20 administrators for every actual doctor. Your anti-trump rants solve nothing. Obamacare is failing and you people don't want to admit that. If you were really trying to help the people like you claim, you would acknowledge that and present an alternative.  People are so focused on hating Trump, but they don't even realize there is no difference between a Republican and a Democrat it's all for show to make you feel like you're on a team. People are so naïve.
he knows the difference between melania and ivanka, he just doesn't care.
More people need to be straightforward like this instead of beating around the bush.
I liked this before the clip even started.. Was that wrong?
At least give free healthcare to children.
he feels like it's he's duty!
I use to like this show.send the healthcare back to the states
Here's the deal. Senators don't write bills, their staff and lobbyists do and they don't even read them.
No one cares Jimmy.  Shut up and sit down.
YOUR TAX $$ AT WORK!  THE SHIMMY JIMMY/CHUCK THE SCHMUCK NEXUS!  YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT!\nJimmy Kimmel got help from Schumer in health bill battle, report claims\nLate-night host Jimmy Kimmel got talking points from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. as he prepared a series of monologues attacking the latest Republican effort to repeal ObamaCare, according to a report published Friday.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that Schumer's office provided technical guidance and info about the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill, as well as stats from various think tanks and experts on the bill's effects.\n\nJimmy wanted to learn more about what was going on politically and policy-wise, The Daily Beast quoted a source as saying, [and] he wanted to fight this thing.\n\nThe host of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live, repeatedly attacked the bill and one of its co-authors, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., over three episodes this week. At one point, Kimmel claimed that Cassidy had lied to my face when the senator appeared on the show to discuss health care.\n\nCassidy responded Thursday morning, telling Fox & Friends that Jimmy doesn't understand.\n\nHe’s only heard from those on the left who are doing their best to preserve ObamaCare,' Cassidy went on. He’s not heard from me, because we’ve not spoken.\n\nThere was no immediate comment on the report from Schumer or Kimmel...\n---22 September 2017  Fox quoting various sources
*guys i got an amazing kinetic saand video watch it and do subscribeeee*
Deplorables support orange boy becuase he tells it like it is.....wrong this is how you tell it like it is, thank god for jimmy!
Why is jimmy so surprised America is built on screwing the other guy to make money. Get rich or die trying
Jimmy K for President 2020!!!!
Why dont you be a politician  a hole  !!
Look at highest rate of diabetic and obesity deaths per state. Lets just say those governors do not want healthcare for their states. Also states are governing their states. It's called government. ....
4 months ago??? Prime example of blatant lies.
wow... its insane how much influence kimmel has on this. conservatives might as well give up or try to actually make a bill that helps everyone
Thank You Jimmy Kimmel ! 👍
GOOOO TRUMP!! HAHA...

Jimmy  is nothing but a Schumer puppet.  Hollywood is nothing but puppets for the Democrat regime.  They talk as though they really care but they don't.  Say anything they disagree with and see what they do.  Not pretty.
kimballs hates americans and a president, he's not funny, he's sick.
I've become a Jimmy Kimmel fan.
The GOP is doing nothing more than taking care of Insurance Companies while Peeing down our necks and telling us it is raining.\nSadly about a third of the population believe them when told it is raining in spite of the smell.
I've lived the healthcare nightmare.  My conditions are - 1)  I'm female...and 2) I have migraines.  Just those 2 things make me untouchable and unwanted by insurance companies.  When I worked for a small business that didn't offer it, I paid for a policy that would not pay for my migraine meds...which were about $100 a pill at the time, nor would it cover a pregnancy or any other female related condition.  This is what the Pro-Lifers are fighting to return to.  No. Just No.
Jimmy=brainwashed Satanist
GO TRUMP!
Why is this #1 trending?😂😂
Jimmy Kimmel, thank you for speaking up and using humor with it. No The Affordable Act is not a perfect healthcare insurance plan, however, the pros of the plan has outweighed the cons. The ACA should have some modifications done, such as, closing that gap of uninsured that are in the age bracket of 25-35 but completely repealing and replacing it is dumb.....but hey Trump is dumb, therefore, making dumb decisions is his specialty. No healthcare plan will benefit and satisfy everyone!
ACA wouldn't cover me and my wife.  The lowest coverage would have cost $1300 a month.  We got private insurance for $300 a month that has way better coverage.  What the republicans are trying to do may not work but ACA isn't the answer either.
That's right. I haven't been watching. What a whiner! You who could pay without a cent of assistance. Wow! You have a child!  Pooh! You act like you're the first person who ever had a child needing medical assistance. your jokes are the exact same as every other night time show. Get some new material and get off our president!
Every American parent with a very sick child 'discovers' all the inadequacies and unfairness of the American Health Care system, which is, to people outside the U.S., a JOKE... USA should have a 'single payer' system for ALL, like Medicare or Medicaid... the problem is you have let the Doctors and Hospitals run the system for so long, enabling them to enrich themselves, at the expense of the public... TAKE BACK YOUR COUNTRY!
jimmy kimmel, small government means more choices, if your soo damn dependent on healthcare you can simply find the state with the best health plan, then move.... With big government it'll be free healthcare, but you get only 1 choice, that choice isn't a choice of course. Because why? because it'll be mandatory, along with the chip they stick in you... If you dont see why thats a bad thing then your to far gone into crazyLiberal land, I hate trump, but yea, it should be left up to the state to choose, and not be dependent on our Government like the masses of sheep wondering aimlessly like mindless zombies looking down at thier cell phones...
what a shame that Karma is biting you in the ass, my friend.............  you used to be funny..................what happened.......oh ... the democrats............... lost................
Anyone called I did
This is so bad shy do y'all keep making awful music . Danny you should of quit when you lost your scream back in the day. Stick to country music loser.
Definitely sounds very different.. Not sure how I feel about this new sound yet
Welcome back, Danny!!! This is the best AA song to date. I've had it on repeat all morning.
I love the song. Sadly, I've seen AA live a few times before and needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. \n\nThis has got to be the hardest song in their repertoire, vocally speaking. I'm seriously hoping that Danny got better when he was gone, because there's no way he pulls this off live.\n\nShame, because it's a fucking banger.
I hope he had learned The lesson
Im gonna have to hear this one live
So glad Danny is back.
They sound so good!!!!!!! This is the AA I love!!!
if you all guys think this shit is truly shit.... what about sleeping with sirens?
danny you look like allan in hang over .
Danm he's so hot😪😪💖
I remember their music when I was in 8th grade. They’ve changed a lot since. It’s like when BMTH went from screaming emo kids to actual artists. Good job, guys!
Man I haven't listened to this band sense I was in highschool, love this new song.
That's what I'm talking about
Have not been listening to AA in a while, because I didnt like Denis in general.\nFeels good to be back, song is amazing and has an authentic flavour to it without sounding too generic.
And i'm very agree denis go out and danny go back as vokalis in asking alexandria.
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas! The original amazing AA is back-)
yess this is where Danny belongs! Asking Alexandria will always be a part of him
Why is this making me so emotional?? Like honestly I'm fucking tearing up listening to this. So powerful, fuck welcome back Danny ❤️🤘🏽
I fucking love this and he still has his scream *-*
I stopped liking this band, because my emo phase ended, and stopped liking the music, but goddamn this is a nice tune
i seriously cried over this yesterday and the day before when it came out. they give me tingles 💕
Thank god danny is back
Im gonna assume this music video is about Danny coming to terms with his alcoholic past and how it destroyed his band mates eventually destroying him.
WE'RE ALMOST AT 666K VIEWS COME ON PEOPLE
I liked Denis's vocals better. Just my opinion.
Back at it again with THE FUCKING GREAT SHIT!!!LOVE IT
Holy fuck! This is incredible!!!!!!
This is great because it seems like the band have just said to Danny, tell us how you honestly feel and he has responded with, part of me kind of hates you all but I hate myself more than anything.
One of the best vocalist to come along in a long time! Thanks for choosing rock!
AA to come back!
the beginning said Continued, Does that mean there was another video before this one or is it just in the style of the video?
What can i say? Dennis Шафоростов, thanks for leaving AA. Danny sounds perfect and i'm so glad to see my favourite band again!
FUCKING LOVE YOU DANNY SO HAPPY YOU'RE BACK
Where are the anothers members
Danny's back!?!? fuck yes!
Why is it so soft?
This is real 'The Black' by AA with Danny while another The black was in  Paralell Universe of AA discography.haha
The band that I love the most is back!
This Twenty One Pio.... Wait... This is asking alexandria?
Where are my slam boyz that love to roast these faggots???  lmao
Stand Up and Scream to this? I just don't get it. Same with some other MetalCore bands. This is such a trend.
did danny lost some weight? ??
The excitement when it first started. God.. I fucking missed them so much.
I fucking love this!!!
Made me cry when he ran over ben. To damn realistic for me. Brings back memories.
does anybody know why danny came back? and why dennis left? not hating at all! i love the new song, i'm just confused
This is the worst lol
666k views bitch

Incredibly cool! I love AA
Damn so Danny can still sing without rasp 😂
Wait wtf he came back?!?
Yes.
Вижу Мустанг - ставлю лайк.
보컬 저새끼가 다시 들어봐서 짜증나지만 새앨범 기대는 해보겠다
Listo pa q lo ponga emmahavok en un video :v
Se está pareciendo a SwS y My Chemical Romans. xD que mal.
Se ve que su voz no es como antes pero OMG MIS AMORES HAN VUELTO
Creo que estoy un poco desepcionado... Pero el tema está bueno aunque no sea de mi gusto que me ha educado AA por mucho tiempo.
Mucho mejor sin Denis, Danny siempre será el mejor 🤘
Han vuelto,  La esencia de asking ha vuelto lml mejor que el mrk de Dennis :v....  Y la cancion de pe te eme
Este si es Asking Alexandria
esperaba una ranchera a lo metal pero realmente me gustó :3
Damn!!!This is asking alexandria 🤘👊
*I see stupid possers coming to say that the song is good because they really do not know it! They do not even know where Danny comes from.*
So who else loves this?
This makes me so happy. The family is together again and they're better than ever.
So everyone is complaining about new Asking Alexandria cause it's different. It's a thing called evolution, if a band releases the same bland metalcore over and over again, everyone gets tired of it. My problem with old Asking Alexandria is in Stand Up and Scream, the drums were sample city, and Danny's vocals were auto tuned to shit. Also the song titles were shit. Reckless and Relentless wasn't bad, but was still kinda meh because Danny's vocals were just really boring to listen to. Also the riffing and writing weren't anything special. From Death to Destiny's mixing was meh, the drums were sample city, but the vocals are amazing and the writing is better. The Black had terrible mixing and terrible writing. This has good writing, well done mixing, great vocals, though the chorus is a little bland with Danny just singing Into The Fire multiple times. Other than that, great song.
damn, not what I expected from them but my god his voice is still amazing
This sounds like Bring Me The Alexandria
danny looking over ben is the most saddest thing but damn he looks so attractive
I'm impressed! Got me with the single, now I'm ready for the album. ❤
Bravo papà
Ew... this fucking sucks.
Asking Alexandria is trending!!!
AQUI TEM BR ?
EVERYONE IS THE MURDERER
Its always the Butler
IT WAS THE BUTLER!! ITS ALWAYS THE BUTLER
I love a good sleuth 🕵️ movie!
im glad I read this so long ago I dont remember who the murderer is
Johnny depp looks old. It’s like Michelle pfeiffer is having a ball with this role.
Hugh Grant isn’t in it anymore?
I saw Brando in there.
Whoever decided the music for this trailer needs to be sacked
I'm looking forward for this movie! But it's a pity that Johnny Depp plays the murdered...
Adventure Time Mystery Train episode got a live action XD
A good ole who done it movie
I've never watched Clue, but this kind of gave me Escape the Night vibes
Finally did the trailer justice. That first cut was a joke.
When you already know who killed the guy because you've probably read the book or watched the older movie
They need to change the ending. One of the most unforgettable endings ever in the original story
The Butler did it.
I think the train did it
You can't fool me, that's McCree's riverboat/gambler skin
I know who the murder is already! I figured it out within the trailer. LOL!
The butler did it.
Now THAT is a mustache.
Oh my god I'm reading this book for english this year. THANK YOU GODS OF LAZINESS
Is that background music 'Believer'??
Too bad about the overplayed music.
The music choice is still awful for this film, but it looks pretty good so far.
I think it looks good, but stop us by that music for your trailers! It doesn’t fit at all and it’s just annoying
I love how they took Agatha Christie's books into movies, so far there have only been show adaptations. If only they made ... and then there were none.
Remember what Dwight said it is some one you least suspect but Most Suspect So they are in the middle
Assuming this is the movie adaptation of SpyParty, KILL WHEELS
stop putting music that barely matches the movie, u ppl did this in the last trailer for this movie too
Too bad this can't be an interactive movie, where they give you a list of suspects and a small notepad at the theater to jot down clues and make assumptions. Before the ending, they pause the movie to have everyone vote on the suspect before the big reveal. I love a good murder mystery.
Omg! I can't wait! I already bought the book so I can read it right after I watch the movie!!!
this looks gooood! I'm sure Johnny Depp will ruin it...
Nobody is better at Hercule Poirot than David Shuchet! And that mustache.....is just...wrong.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcdbyFzZHHY
I clicked this because it reminded me of that Doctor Who episode..
Spoiler : the butler did it...
EVERYBODY IS THE MURDERER
*when the polar express takes a wrong turn to the hood*
For a minute I thought imagine dragons believer was the background music,imagine how nice it would be though!
AHHHHH LESLIE YOU COME HERE RIGHT NOW MISTER AND GIVE ME A HUG
That's more like it
Wht😲 I just started the book
Almost like a Wes Anderson movie
Since the Mexican actor is barely shown I'm guessing it's him.
I read this book in Middle School!
I used to read her books
5 bucks says his suspects are  in this order are:\n\nThe only black man on the train\n\n the butler \n\nThen everybody else.
One of my favourite books on my shelf. Thank you whomever decided to make this a movie! I hope it lives up to her beautiful way of storytelling!
Plot twist. They all did it
So...this is Clue? On a train? \n\nThe butler did it with a wrench in the bathroom. What do I win?
Spoiler: \n\n\n\n\nThe murderer is actually everyone
What if the detective is the killer🤔
cant wait to see this the queen michelle pfeiffer is busy this year xx
This movie is the live action version of Mystery Train Island from Poptropica
I know who did it spoilers!\n\n\n\n\nThe train
Who is the murder????
hey,guys i want to tell everyone how i got money easily from western union transfer,this is indeed a genuine and fast way of making good money ,i got to know about this when i was searching for a job online then i saw an add about the western then i contacted hacker on their email and placed an order for $10,000 to my greatest surprise i got an MTCN to cash out the transfer directly from the western union .you can contact the hackers on their email royaltyhackers@yahoo.com .
The greatest detective in the world is Jacques Clouseau
So, CLUE on a train...?
They just HAD to leave a hint of the wildly inappropriate modern music from the first trailer. Seriously... a classic mystery, with a GREAT cast, and amazing cinematography... so they market it with an Imagine Dragons song?! Garbage. It has no place, no relevance, and is unbelievably period inappropriate.
So CLUE on a train??
Everyone but the detective is the killer.
I say it’s Colonel Mustard.
Hercule Poirot has an egg shaped head with a thin mustache. Please stop murdering historically iconic characters. Otherwise looks fine
That thumbnail stache though.
Can't wait
Oscars?
Waiting for Serghei Polunin!
Can't Waitt.
A. BURR
William Dafoe did it.
Can't wait

jeez, the casting in this is phenomenal...
that glorious mustache is the murderer!
The maidd
Welp, we all know the black dude didn't do it
The politically correctness destroying another good book...
*I’m still alive, if anyone cares...*
Why he always loses a finger
What if a hippo swallowed you alive?
Bottom of the ocean with no pressure suit
I subbed at 40k subs holy shit this channel grows fast
next time could we see what happens if gradually every part of arnold is replaced with a robotic version? that would be really cool.
Do a comments video plz or else
This was the gayest thing ive ever seen
Do When u life one day on a other planet
This is hilarious, make more videos or else I'll keep typing until you realize that this isn't a real threat
Interesting videos, but I really hate the theme. Arnold, Arnold, Arnold. It gets very repetitive.
put him inside the purge
it will be 1million  in october
what will happen when Arnold is close to a black hole
I feel bad for Arnold
500k subs in a month wow that's amasing
arnold bulids a machine to go to another muti-verse to eascape this place called earth but his math was not on and went to earth with nothing. good news hes alive bad news is he forgot to eat dinner and tries to find food but has no luck-arnold if u see this don't do i-oh nevermind i got lost in the sea of comments
One like = one finger for Arnold\n\nLiterally.....
What about the Desert?
What would happen if Arnold was Swallowed alive by a snake?
What if humans/Arnold have lived underground since the past 200,000 years??
What happens to your eyes if you watch to much porn???
How much radiation can the human body take
Send him in acid for 5 seconds
i have a theory :\n  In every episode Arnold lost a finger right? NO! In the first episode ”how to survive a plain crash” Arnold didn't lose any finger and in the same episode he pasted out.\n  Here comes the theory that Arnold is stil in a deeeeeep  slumber so he is imagining other ways he coud die in a less painfull way like staing alive or how he coud survive like with super speed or how his burial woud be and many more stuff.\n   But why does he lose a finger be cause that shows he will die ...... if he had super speed he woud die if he was on the sun he woudav had a mouch painfull death and he woud be buried alive be couse he was in a coma people didn't know he was alive and not just in a coma.\n  And so probably at one point arnold is going to be in a coma episode and not lose a finger \n                         \n                    PS: I am not to good at english.
What if Arnold got hit by a car at 100kmph?
what if you open the car door when it goes 300 miles for hour
I feel bad for Arnold
Send him in deep ocean Or in what if he dig deep in crust
I didn't understand the bit about the smoke.. Anyone else? :O
WHY ALWAYS THE FINGER
i feel so bad for Arnold.but hey anything for science..keep strong Arnold
Who else feel guinely bad for Arnold?

I Love All YOUR VIDS
Your voice matches another channel guy it’s called ridddle 😬
Hey, go to another planet next, Venus or something
Send arnold to a volcano
This is really a stupid cartoon... Perhaps the creator of this really stupid cartoon doesn't realize that many times sharks are opened up after being caught and have other fish or items undigested in their stomachs. More likely many of them die from lack of oxygen first rather than any acids as you implied! It just shows that science isn't your Forte!
Hide 2D from the whales (only Gorillaz fans will understand this)
Whales of let water out when there on the top of the water. People these days they don't know things
I was here before this chanel got millions of subscribers
You make the Next video about Arnold going back in time to the dinasaurs
I'm glad I'm not the only one who has thoughts about being eating alive by a whale \n😓
Then he died of the bends
What if the whale swallowed the whale swallowed you alive?
OH MY GOD THIS IS TRENDING
somewhere these is a director that gonna make a movie about Jonah and the Whale \n.. someday
Why does his finger cuts off everytime
Take him to the Tsar bombing!
what if Arnold gets stuck in a nuclear reactors core without any protection
I can't wait to be swallowed alive!
The dislikes were probably from people who gave suggestions for the next place arnold went next, and you didn't use them.
What could happen if Arnold were to leave near  a volcano but it won't erupt for his lifetime?
in 1 months you have 500 k subs... me 5 years 59 subs...
*A R N O L D*
This YouTube channel is blowing up

And there is a PARTY going on in my mouth! Ben you're such a dweeb in the best way possible.
I'm seriously loving the variety of content you guys offer to switch things up and make your channel always interesting! I'm so glad I subscribed to you guys 6 years ago when everybody was still looking like foetus versions of yourselves!!!!
Chorizo James... perfect name for a luchador. Career change? ;)
This is why they bully you, Ben. Because you loudly proclaim about parties in your mouth.
I see mac & cheese, I click. Simple as that.
Ben's such a  w e e b
How are you not all fat by now? Tell me your secrets!!
for a theme week you guys should really do a cheap week. and maybe for a battle give each of the guys like 20 bucks or something and get them to actually shop and create a dish.
I've liked this video but really its only half a like cos Mike's not in it. hashtagteamhuttlestone
Hahahhaha can't stop laughing how in this video Jamie widens his eyes everytime he's talking 😂😂😂
Before summer ends *everyone is wearing jackets*
I'm so happy James is in more videos! Love these kinds of videos, I can't wait to go back to London.
I was in London earlier this summer and NEEDED THIS THEN. y'all are killing me with all these London recs, when I'm NO LONGER THERE TO TRY THEM.
Sooooo who is organizing the Sorted Food Oktoberfest meetup??
Ben sometimes sounds like a wife. James being the husband
Am I the only one or is umami Ben's favourite flavor
hey i just really enjoy how furiously ben said theres a party going on in my mouth!
YAS JAMES YAS
I don't think I'll ever tire of commenting this;\n\nTch oh - ree - thoh\n\nI don't care how you pronounce the rest of the word but please, PLEASE  use an English th, not a z. Thank you. 
Erm.... if it’s in Brixton, then it’s certainly not central London. It’s South London. Please don’t confuse people. Thanks.
Thank you for the suggestion. Will definitely keep them in mind when I visit London next year!
James hopping over the bench and saying 'i'm very tall!' honestly made my day
U lads ever gonna actually get back to cooking again?
Yum! Thanks for taking me along on that great lunch trip! :)
I've never been this early to a Sorted vid ever! 👋👋👋 good whatever-your-time-is-there Sorted team!
YOU GUYS!  I'm seriously loving all the outdoor/on-location stuff you've been doing lately.  It's really been so fun and interesting, getting to see more of where you live and the places you can get to, seeing as how you're in England and all.  I've been a subscriber for a long time and I love the channel and you guys to bits and can't wait to see what's next! :D
I really enjoy this concept of testing lots of food in one city. It changes it up a bit ! :)
The thing with padrón peppers is, as the saying unos pican y otros no which mean some are spicy and some not. The funny thing with eating them (aside from being really delicious) is that there's the chance that you get a super spicy one and makes you want to die! :D
Thanks!  What a treat!  Loved the critical commentary.  Wish I could have been there!
So this is great and all, but what if you don't have much of a kitchen or a kitchen at all, how are you going to make mac and cheese? I'll tell you how, go to my Mac and Cheese recipe on my channel. I'll teach you to do it without even having to boil the noodles.
Oh my gosh, you were in Brixton?!?
I thought this was gonna be a video on how to make charizo Mac and cheese but I'm still not disappointed.
Ben... I'm sure people would love to join your party in your mouth or wherever(I mean house) now that you've offered.
Sorry Ben, once you put it out there there's no taking it back... Party in my mouth 🎶🎶 sing it!
really like these types of videos! keep it up boyssss~
I've GOT to visit London! British food isn't just Bubble and Squeak! I'm drooling!
Jamie's laugh 😂 killed me
Am I the only one who noticed that Ben has a beard and moustache starting\n\n\n\n\nOnly me? Ok
Ben is the Harry Potter of Sorted...
I like all of them. No way to choose.
wasn’t it mike who made the ‘and there’s a party going on in my mouth’ comment?
That place looks super cool!
Good to know James is at least willing to enjoy less frilly things occasionally.
First 20 seconds Ben it's A What??!?
Love this video, it's also my birthday today I'm 20!!! 🎉🎉 love u guys 😘😘
GUYS GET A DIFFERENT CAMERA MAN AND GIVE MIKE MORE SCREEN TIME PLS
my mum went on a complete padron pepper bender this summer. honestly sick of them now, she just took it too far.
You guys should check out GrubMCR! They are amazing, and such a great vibe. I've been there about 5 times. Look them up on instagram :)
Shouldn't an Oktoberfest be finished by the time it is actually october?!
God Did u see Jamie munching on that pepper!! he grew up in my eyes!
You should really make your own version of stuffed naan, for example nutella, pizza, cheese and sooo much more
You should do the same thing at Pergola on the roof in Shepherd's Bush!
Please go back there for Oktoberfest!!! If it's authentic food you will love it!
oh god, why am I watching this when I'm just about to go grocery shopping and I'm already starving. There's no possible way I'll make responsible decisions.
I love the exiting things you see and do. I would like to go there if I go to London again. Cheers!
Slightly disappointed that it wasn't called mac and chorizo.
I love whenever you guys do a food adventure video!
Man if I took a shot for everytime one of the lads said umami I'd end up in the hospital,
For a second, I thought Ben called James a dick\nturns out he called him ridiculous\nclassic bennuendo
I see Brixton has been gentrified.
There is no spice in this what so ever!!! Dying
I'm not so lucky, so I have to take your word for how amazing it was.  Not that I could afford it, or afford going to London from USA... I can't even afford to go to KC, and you were there recently.  I laughed that you had taken my advice, though.  Not JUST my advice, I am sure you had a LOT of people tell you the same thing.  I liked that you did the bit with the fountains.  I shared all those videos you made in KC, hope they got you a few more fans.
4:21 we love you Ben XD NEVER CHANGE
Jamie's hair reminds me of a certain dictator...
Always looking for exciting new places to eat, brixton has so many hidden gems when it comes to eating out👏🏼
is it wrong I said 'helloooo' same time as Jamie.
James is a legend. More of James in the future please
I always find myself watching these videos when I'm hungry. I don't know why I punish myself :(
Bens two favourite things:\n- sprigs of mint\n- umami (oo-maa-me)
pimentos padron, uns picon outros non <3
Ugh. London is just one huge pretentious hipster paradise :/
Do another shocker recipe
Am I invited to Ben's party?
 pimientos de padrón, unos pican, otros no. that's what we say in Spain.  padrón peppers, some are hot, some are not. That's the funny thing, u never know if you will eat a super hot one but in general they are really tasty and mild.
loving that james is getting more screen time
I want to hang out with you guys! Some incredible sounding food! Could talk about them all day!
Macarrones con chorizo de toda la vida bye
Ben's 5:00 shadow goatee is lovely
Padron peppers omg
Food.
mac & cheese wins every time!
*The BOURGOIUSE*\n\n\n\n\n\nhowevr u spell that

Delish! 😄
👍🏻
Where's Barry?!
Watching your vids always ways cheers me up!
Chorizo mac and cheese...I'm weeping.
again KAAK WARKA make it !
Presentation amazing !!!
Do padron peppers ever have heat?!
Ben, you can't just take that sentence back! As per the Chinese idiom: 一言既出，驷马难追, once you've said something, you can't take it back :>
Loving all the James and all of the exploration videos!!
I am confused... titles says mac & cheese, but video is of chili cheese fries...
Is this the first comment? \nAnyway, great video
I miss the OLD sorted food..... I'm a foodie and is here for the recipes and not the show.....
Your channel never fails to make me hungry 😩Thanks!? Lol
Explain umami
Few beers deep were you boys
The prime minister has just stuck 2 fingers up to the people who voted for Brexit with her little speech today. The elites and Goldman Sachs will never allow us to destroy their globalist dream.

Love the song, love the video. 100.
I liked the fact that they didn't have her just standing there like mannequin. They had her working in this video and it looks like an art piece.
I loved this song, but the back and forth was too much painful to watch
Reminds me of a target🎯 commercial
i don't think any outfit could look bad if kendall was wearing it
This video is a shit
Kendall is really a good clickbait.
this is a good song but the video are so pointless lmao
horrible song and horrible video.  This is just bad.
The song would have made it a hit even without Kendal anyways . It's good
My eyes so hurts...who edit this
I hate the edit but I like Kendall
This made my anxiety blow up 😂but I like the song
She is so beautiful
Why kendall ?? She has nothing to do with this video
I love the song
I thought my computer was lag like hell and I almost wanted to take it to fix.
What was the treatment of this video: 'Let's film Kendall Jenner being mediocre'?
I can't stop to play this song. (and the video. Kendall's face is to much). Good job Fergie
Kylie would've been better, but kendall is good tho
Fergie you genius! The song is hipnotic
How is this bitch a vs model?. I just can't see it. 
I could nt even watch a full minute....how annoying was this video?
Y'all really had to use this overrated white capitalist bitch for the video?

Loved the music and love Kendall but this video is so confused! It's a no.
I love Kendall but this video is a mess
It's stuck in my head now and I can't stop singing it.

Tf happened to fergalicious that was the shit. She's gone downhill 🤗 🤔sorry
I'm french and this is cringe to my ears
Warner Bros hit me up if you ever need a ratchet girl for your movie who beats down fathers who don't pay child support - I'M YOUR GIRL!!! Comment with a movie title LOL
Yes I been waiting for a tomb raider movie since 2001
she is cute  but,    she should have BIG TITS for the part   LARA CROFT MUST HAVE BIG TITS
It's a prequel guys... chill..
Can we go back to the old good British accented Lady Croft instead of female Bear Grylls/Nathan Drake shit?
The cinematography was terrible in the scene when she jumped XD it went back in time for a moment. 1:51
Dis the guy in the bout die i like him
I will ride with you
Honestly this looks like shit. Which is a good thing because in the trailers Assassins Creed actually looked good.
She's flat as a board but she's playing Lara Croft?? \nThe busty video game sex symbol famously played by ANGELINA JOLIE?
It was so cringey if I'm being honest. I'll take two *Holds up guns* XD
Can't wait to see it on CinemaSins
C'mon guys, did you have to kill tomb raider?
I don't know how this is going to do, but I liked the clips they threw in there. hoping it's good...
This looks fucking bad ass. Fuck all of you im watching it.
Is that Nick Frost as the gun dealer?
The new games weren't even that good to begin with, making a film out of it is just plain stupid. Not to mention the graphics in the game looks better than the SFX in this.
I hope she doesn't ruin her acting career with this.
Umm anybody is realise that at 1:51 she is close to jumping but when the camera angle goes out, she is kinda not even near that jump...
LMAO at that jump at 1.50. The games are gonna be more realistic than this
Tum-Dum...Tum-Dum...Tum-Dum...Tum-Dum...Tum-Dum\nthat sound track is so cringe... Oh and stop making another super hero movie, there's already too many of those around. Give us adventure!
This is like reading the book before watching the movie. It'll without a doubt still be an awesome movie tho.
This is gonna suck so much first they fuck up assassin creed now tomb raider what's next
In case the PR team is looking at the comment section this is basically a sum up of what people are saying:\n- Poor casting choice\n- Where Angelina at?\n- Boobs ain't big enough\nand basically, don't fuck it up.
The eternal problem of filmmakers treating their audiences like idiots rears its ugly head. Tomb Raider is at its best when it's most measured and atmospheric. You don't have to make Lara Croft a badass action hero, she's been one for decades. You need to make her relatable and tragic like in the new game series. Let the scenery and the mystery speak for the story. \n\nI'm to looking forward to this based on this trailer.
I am a huge fan of Lara Croft but I don't like this actress as her! No! She doesn't look like her and she doesn't have that vibe as Lara. I know there have been more others who could play Lara. Movie looks good but her no!
The problem with games becoming movies is that they really don't stick to the original source that much as producers are looking to expand to a larger audience not just gamers. I played Max Payne and Hitman and when those movies came out I was greatly disappointed. I actually never played Tomb Raider so I'm hoping having not actually played the game I might enjoy the movie more. We'll see.
I feel like something is wrong here, and I have several reasons why.\n1. This is Lara's first adventure, but she has the attitude of Rise of the Tomb Raider Lara. They mixed up the first and second games in to one big mess, completely disregarding a little thing called, Character Development.\n2. The movie is clearly focused on action and stunts rather than exploration and discovery.\n3. Corny comedy bits.\n\nAll in all, it might just be marketed wrong, but from what I see it's another game movie, not a movie based on a game.
loved her in the man from uncle, as sexy as can be, that dancing scene in the hotel, HOT
Wow Alicia ! She'll be amazing as Lara
Give me a live action pokemon m movie and we're good
I WANT WINSTON TO BE IN THIS AND A SCENE WHERE LARA LOCKS HIM IN THE FREEZER JUST TO PAY A HOMAGE TO OLD GAMES AND HOPEFULLY SAVE THIS MOVIE even tho i will problably like it anyway even tho it will flop
The new Tomb Raider games are awful and so is this movie. Give us the old Lara Croft!
Fail. She is not Laura.
No no no no, the games is already golden movies...

Did she lose her b00bs in a horrible accident or something?
How many fucking reboots am I gonna have to witness on this rock, unoriginal wankers.
Move is sum ways looks neet but in a lot of was a wers vershin than the reboot videogame the move is baset of
SUBBING to everyone who likes and subscribes to me
7/10 Not enough sam or bust.
I for one did not think Angelina Jolie was any good as Lara Croft. This looks like a great trailer and Alicia Vikander is an amazing actor.
That music does not suit  Tomb Raider at all
Politically possibly shell big meat song wedding lose spot remind.
I wonder if this another video game movie will flop.
For all those complaining because it's using a cliche plot idea, please pick up a Tomb Raider game, primarily the 2013 game reboot. Secondly, wtf has been size got to do with how well someone can play Lara Croft? Game accuracy? You do realize in the early games her boobs were like arrow heads and to make them true to life you'd have to almost be able to cut glass with them. Or did you want her to look like she accidentally wandered on set from the Lego Movie? Lastly, there is nothing wrong with the casting. She looks the part, has the accent down and tbh it's unfair not to give her a chance before actually seeing how well she does in the movie. This could be awesome. We don't know. It at least looks like it's trying to follow the 2013 remake in some way (though I know it won't be completely the same), which is better than what they have done in the past. I love Jolie and she made a great Lara Croft but her Tomb Raider movies were terrible.
Poor actor chosen for the role.
Her face looks kind of sad
she's just a kid, plus, Lara Croft with no big boobs, lips and ass is a minus :D
WATCH THE GREATEST STORY NEVER TOLD FOR TRUTH!!
It is looking too bad
I don't like this new “relatable“ lara
Wow, the comment section, it never fails to brought up the worst of people
Anjelina is better, she's got the badass look and hotter.
My mom will love this movie
Why not make Uncharted over Tomb Raider? Would be way better since there´s already Tomb Raider movies...
I was really, *REALLY* looking forward to this and now I'm most disappointed and displeased: should have been re-written as a 2-hour Lucozade commercial
she is so hot
She is no Angelina jolie
Lara Croft should've been, in this adveture, a survivor, but instead we got a professional killer. look at her face there is not an ounce of fear, for all I know she might as well Agent 47 daughter.
Looks a lot better Han the original ones.
YA DONE FUCKED IT UP! A flatchested Lara Croft? GET THE FUCK OUT!
Why would they copy a game ..
at least try to make her look like lara
I'll be honest. I don't play the game. Maybe I should start. \n\nBut for now, I'm curious why people are saying this movie is a mistake. Can anyone tell me?
This looks terrible. She looks like she can't act and she doesn't look the part.
Tbh this looks like the most generic arc ever written. Same problem like suicide squad had, why does it always have to be some world threatening event that could everyone get killed? Also why tf does she look so bored all the time? Theyre trying way too hard do make it look like the games. Hard pass
Thanks you trailers. Saw the movie. Also, this looks like shit. Copy pasted the game and managed to do a poor job.

I LOVE DARCI LYNN THE AMERICAN VENTRILOQUIST GIRL SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    :-D
two true masters of ventriloquism together! great presentation by Darci and Terry
Kermit why are you in disguise
Why does Mel B look likes she's trying to impersonate Storm?
aww she messed up the first line of the song
Terry fator when ever hi is about to talk with puppet he puts his hand in his pocket like if u agree
I wish this would still be trending ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh wait it is
Congratulations Darci Lynne on winning AGT 2017!!!\nIt must have been really cool meeting your idol Terry Fator and Jeff Dunham.
What a good girl.
Jon cozart. All I could think of
I can say anything softer than you!
Simple Q&A\n1) Did she mess up in the beginning?\nA: Yes, it's a live show, anything can happen.\n\n2) Tech Issue?\nA. Human issue, she sang lyrics wrong and stop singing.\n\n3) Was votes affected by this mistake?\nA. Not at all. It's additional performance asked by AGT,\nand it's NOT FINALS (you can see which clip thumbnails with FINALS with it)\n\n4) Was these show all live?\nＡ. No, Sara & Hero's dog training is pre-recorded drama,\nalso Preacher with Howie.
waiting for the fanfict of that bunny and turtle
fun fact: Selena Gomez can also sing while barely opening her mouth.\n\n😂✌✌
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
From a distance he looks a lot like Bryan Cranston
Did she mess up the lyrics at the beginning?
That was crazy and amazing! That's talent! ❤
No idea, they're talented
So proud of Darci lynne!! You're pure gold!👌😍
Darci Lynne is great. What an amazing talent.
Some day, Mirage is going to replace Terry Fator with Darci hahaha
After seeing her for the first time I wanted her to win! So glad she did!
WHO else got old school disney flashbacks from that duet!
Please visit the channel master 089 rug
Ya know, it'd be worth flying to Vegas just to see her perform.
Steve Hewitt on bgt will be happy to.
Did she mess up at the beginning cause she saved that really nicely
The girl has a gift. If she keeps this up she could be famous some day
SHE IS SO PRETTY! I wanna date her. But it will never happen :( She has the best talent ever!
Terry Fator was on my cruise ship in July he was pretty good 👍
Is it just me or have I been seeing only the flatliners ad lately

I can for what i can for what you can do what i can do
Its a great performance, but its cringy sometimes.... like the entire time...
What happened around the 1:45 minute mark?
HEY WHO CAN GO SUB TO ME I TRY TO UPLOAD DAILY

Wow. She can sing like that even when her mouth's closed. What more if she opens it fully?!!!! Amazing!!! 😱
2:24 R U SURE DARCI IS NOT A ROBOT WHO CAN SING THAT GOOD AT THAT AGE WITH THERE MOUTH FRICKEN CLOSED?!?!
did anyone hear the laugh she made w/ Petunia's voice!! that was soo cute!!
from the day she made his firts presentation in AGT, we all knew that the rest had to compete for the second place, and so was!
Anything I can do I... Can.....uhhh nevermind.
Little did she know she would win
cant wait her to sing on americas national anthem with her puppet
And she won, good for her
She's from Oklahoma
At 1:44 she messed up by saying, anything I can do you can do better! But she played it off so professionally, and nailed this performance. I love Darci and I'm so happy she won! 😁
Make your phone look EXACTLY like the Note8 or S8 even the app drawer click the link  https://youtu.be/79ziUcXNo38
DARCI WONN!!!!! I SO PROUD TO BE FROM OKLAHOMA
So glad she won💕💕💕👩🏼Knew she was going to win from the start💕💕
PAUL ZERDAN
YES I CAAAAANNNN
1:46 you what?
Amazingly hard
YYYEEESSS IIIII CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
So wowwwww...nice talent
@darcilynne you're so awesome girl.. ❤
wow
Only on thing 1:42
Dammit we got a gullible Christian here
http://MoneyComeFirst.com/?ref=44659
-👨‍❤️‍👨-Great-
WHERE IS PAUL ZERDIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg petunias face when she saw Winston was hilarious
http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=108950
is this canon?
Jeff is better
Check my videos
Shes so talented happy she won
Backdrop opens up. REVEALS SAME BACKDROP!
Awesome
so cool
Angelica Hale is the real winner.
That was cheesy. And lame.
I find this a bit unsettling
Wow. This is just... bad.  This won a million bucks??  Incredible.
Yeah she's talented but smh im not happy that she won. Their was better talent like mike who sanged in the subway and wad in this show like whats so special about a talking puppet coming from a girl mouth
I know that the bunny is fake cuz the girl is moving her nick
Angelica was robbed.She is talented but come on...she flubbed this performance.
I like that she won but I don't think she was the best. Like she can only do one voice and her mouth is open slightly. I would've waited a few years before coming on the show honestly.
She really isnt that good im sorry if u dont like my opinion
This season was probably the most disappointing, i dont think darci was the most talented, she moves her mouth way to much, messes up alot, and overall just lacks experience. I know shes young but its supposed to be the most talented person wins not the youngest person whos kinda talented
It's fake
Booooo this is bad
So trash
What this song please answer me😊!!
TRASH TRASH GARBAGE
1:46 (cringing into oblivion intensifies)
This is the best duet ever!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. \nPlease come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has.\nPlease come see and help me share it with others. \nThere's HOPE!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
What’s the title of the song they sing ???
1:40 is it me or did she make a mistake when she said any thing I can do y-
*tHAT* IS FREAKING TALENT.
I guess we're all just gonna ignore that she messes up @ 1:45, huh?
I'm sitting here after reading someone congratulating Darcy, and people Called the voters to her Racist Why?\nBecause the other girl (Who I thought should of won too) was another race.\n\n\n Now, Not ever person is Racist\nYes, Racist people might of voted, but just because someone who was maybe Asian, black, etc. Lost to someone who was white,\n\n Doesn't mean that the voters are Racists as they might of thought Darcy did better. Respect what the voters choose or take your hate, Away from others who don't wanna see that.\n\n\n\n\n ~Mysterious Girl
How did she win? I know she's young and it's pretty impressive she's able to do this, but the other contestants deserved it WAY more. She was pretty amateur in her performances. I mean really, all she did was sing with a puppet, that's it...
2:41 Her voirce cracked\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot to be rude.
I actually love the lighting of this video! The conversation is casual and very real, so why would the lighting be overexposed and unnatural? It looks like they're having a girls night in together chatting about makeup, which makes the viewer feel part of the conversation. Well done to you all! xo
Sam: So, who are your beauty icons?\nVic: Starts wittering on about grey eyeshadow, working in a lab and challenging herself... 🤦🏻‍♀️
OMG I love all their accents! 😍😍😍😭😭
It was really  nice to see Victoria so relaxed and at ease. She was very kind and lovely. I wish the lighting would've been a bit better and that we could see the products more up close though! Thank you so much for this wonderful interview!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Nic, your nail colour is AMAZING. May I ask what you have on? Love your videos ladies! xxx
Oh, how I love this British accent... Can listen to you for hours :-D
hmmm she's got a pre-rehearsed answer for everything. I get you have to prepare stuff before interviews but just saying things to hit those promotion marks and not actually answer the question seems disingenuous to me.
Weird. Didn't answer the first question on the first makeup product she ever purchased but then goes on to say that in the first meeting with EL there was an entire table of makeup she has collected since being a child. 🤔
LOVE how she swerves the beauty icon question. Because she is her own beauty icon!!! 🙌🏼💁🏻
Love Sam and Nic, love Victoria! Fab, inspirational ladies 🌹❤️
Wonderful interview! Victoria is such a classy woman, I love her style and she seems really down to earth too
I love Victoria. I think she is such a classy lady but I struggle to find her personality. On interviews she is constantly talking about David or her kids but very little about herself. In this interview she was asked about her favourite music but she replied with what her kids listened to and went on blabbering about it. I know she loves her kids like every mom does but I wish she opened up more about herself rather than talking about David and kids all the time. It makes her look like her only achievement till now is she married a famous guy and had kids with him.
So happy to see this! I know she's promoting her products but she really is an interesting and hard working lady. To have a solid marriage, lovely children and such success in the fashion and beauty industry and look so amazing all the time! You two smashed it! xx
Such a joy to watch!
This is incredible, girls. Loved this chat, so casual and felt natural, I loved watching it! x
When I went to Buckingham Palace to get my OBE, I wore this blue over black liner... more interesting. oh, please...
LOVE you Vicky!! Def going to support my girl and have ordered some of the collection, its had such great reviews. Really enjoyed watching you 3 girls talk, can't wat for more #pixiwoochats
Victoria is such a girls girl - great interview x
You are all such beautiful women!!! Great time watching!! I would have loved to see more makeup use and tips and tricks! I LOVE makeup!!!
Love love love. You are 3 very inspirational women and I only expected it to be a buy it now video. Loved the natural setting, honest Q&A and the human touch. Could have listened to you all for much longer. Although I'm the same age I still have no idea about makeup and having a disability means most days makeup is the last thing on my mind - I desperately want that to change after watching this and want it all. Fab x x x
Her voice is soo relaxing, imagine her reading bed time stories 😍
How ironic is it that Brooklyn has moved to New York
I loved this video seemed so honest and effortless!!!
Nic getting a bit fan girl there 😂
This interview is fantastic. It's such an intimate yet still lighthearted look at all three of you and it was certainly a privilege to watch. Thank you!
She’s so nice!!! Xxx
she seems so easy going and down to earth! <3
Classy, stylish, and brilliant women! What's NOT to love ?!!
I wonder if Victoria maybe misheard the question about the style icons or kinda started with a thought and then forgot the what the question was 🙈😂 because she doesn't come across as rude or too self centred, she was happy to chat about things other than makeup. Ever been in an interview and had to buy yourself some time to think of an answer but end up forgetting what the question was - I have 🙋🤷 no biggy! All 3 ladies looked lovely!
Sam,Nic,love the questions that you asked were real and not practised.the price point of the collection is above me,but good on her for formulating a great Collection.xx
i love victoria beckham so much!!!! just wish her collection wasn't with estee lauder...
I'm pretty sure Victoria always decides which side she sits on.
Nick my love did you really have your hair like that to meet Victoria and I think your makeup regret will be all that highlight!!
I think that Victoria Beckham is absolutely fabulous and a all-around Class Act. I do wish that not all (or nearly all) questions led back to makeup, but hey, this is what the interview was supposed to be about.:)
Love you all and i love Victoria make-up collection stunning to look at. Xxxxxxx
WAIT I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE TWO OF THEM wtf
Blooming love the women!! Yes she smiles, yes she is nice! Big fan ❤️
Really enjoyed this interview!!! Never seen Victoria look so at ease, lovely nice to see.\nLove the sound of the mascara too!\nWill have to purchase if its anything like my holy grail sumptuous extreme 😍
Best footage of Victoria Beckham by far. Relaxed, fun, natural.
Too much Class, Beauty, women goals:! Victoria is seriously a Godess, shes amazing, if I had money I would buy alll her makeup line, but sadly :( cant afford it, but still Proud of you:!
PACKAGINGGGG!!!!!! Thank you for caring for your customer ! I hate those high end brands did those cheap ass plastic or cardboards packages even sometimes they do not put a mirror for god sake it is a mirror! so thanks again beautiful collection beautiful interview
loved it ladies :) this is great, well done x
Such a nice video. Thank you. And Victoria is a real inspiration, I really admire her. Really loved this interview.
Love this and love Victoria 😍
Loved absolutely everything about this video ❤️
She is such a beauty😍
Honestly this is such a great interview, great job!!
Come check out my Scottish Beauty channel! This weeks video is my high school make-up. 💓💋💄https://youtu.be/i3qgrq7c_cg
Wow-incredibly real stuff here. Not just one big ad. I respect her & you both, tremendously.♥
I'm so, so happy your doing these videos too again. The two of you are great in interview sits, and I love watching you as much as I do your awesome subject! Your killing it, as my granddaughter says! Lol!❤️
beauty,brains and ambition she really is perfect.
I love all 3 of these ladies!! Victoria Beckham is my style icon!!
Victoria seems like such a lovely person! Great interview x
Love love love. Well done ladies x
Helena Rubinstein used to intervene herself with her customers... She wasn't afraid of being behind the counter either..
That's such a pretty dress.
What a nice lady and we share the same birthday 😀
I've never seen VB interview before... always got the impression she was a bit stuck up (don't know why!) but she seems SO down to earth! What an inspirational, classy woman. Loved this interview! X
Fantastic video, thank you for this, love you all so much 😊
Sam Chapman what colour is on your cheeks!! It's gorgeous
amazing video! you all look stunning xx
Thank you for this video. I adore Victoria Beckham and now I know she worked at House of Fraser too in the Beauty Department 😇 it is sooo long ago (2008?) and I bought her book then at that time, 'That extra half an inch' and it's still in my bookshelf. Always an inspiration 💐 And yes, I loved that job then, it was hard but rewarding and I did it around Christmas time as well. Good memories 💜
Victoria seems like a mega babe, loved this interview ❤️
I have to say, I LOVE both your outfits in this video!! You both look incredible 😍
Loved this thanks ladies x
Answers all questions with her products 🙈
This was so real. Well done Sam and Nic. You two were so open and natural with her, like chatting with friends. Victoria is a classy, humble and down to earth lady. Wonderful interview - loved it!
I love this sort of relaxed interview. Almost like old friends sitting down for a chitchat which is lovely. Victoria is just such a lovely person and i'm happy to hear her thoughts and perspective on designing the products. I also love how Nic and Sam also add on their own experiences and little quips. I know it's of strange to say that but the thing is i'm sick of interviewers who just ask questions and act like they themselves are not there. I love this kind of unscripted interview and Victoria is such a pro at promoting her products. if i had the money i would buy everything she sells because you can definitely see her passion and drive for what she does. Major love for these 3 ladies! <3
I enjoyed this interview so much. All three ladies looked fantastic. It was such a treat to listen to Victoria talk about makeup. She seems very passionate and dedicated to her work. Thanks for bringing us this special treat.
This is such a great interview. Victoria is so natural (it really surprised me)  and you are truely respectful but friendly at the same time that you made it seem as if Victoria was the third pixiwoo and you were just there, hanging out, having a casual chit chat about makeup.\nSo good.
Why can't she make it more affordable for us working Mum's 🤔
Three of my favourite women ❤️
I do love Pixiwoo when they interview people.  It always comes across as ladies having a good chat rather than just questions being answered! Xx
Hmmm VB obv doesn't get the word icons she's clearly done it all on her own 😂😂😂...dont think so!
Great interview, Victoria is lovely. When they ask her about her beauty icons, and she answers what she wants... hilarious, she sells well her products. I love when she talks about her kids.
Why so much nose touching?
Creepy thumbnail!
Omg guys!!! Love love loveeeeed this
I loooved this interview!!!!
What a gorgeous video! 💙❤💙
Heather shimmer yes!
#goals
carry on eating salads you skinny bitch
Love you all!
She didn't answer your question about who inspires her
Love this video!
This is SO LOVELY. It was like watching three friends chatting, I loved it when Victoria asked Nic how she feels about her daughter starting school. Such a grounded woman!
Ah I love you guys and Victoria a little bit more now. It Came across as you actually had such a warm bond with her and so natural. Loved this and yay for you guys 💪🏻 when women support women
VB is the reallife goddess 😍😍😍😍
Charming ladies xx 🖤💀🖤
www.facebook.com/thiago.xavier.7564 .
Lovely lady & fab interview
Best Victoria interview!
Very dark video
Love this ladies!! Xx
very dark lighting
Amazing! Well done ladies xx
Thank you!👍🏻💛💛💛😊
Love it!
She is really lovely!
so bad for this couple they look so cute together ❤️
Scott is lookin real good tho
YOU CAN CUT THE SEXUAL TENSION HERE WITH A KNIFE
They so belong together!! Chemistry is 🔥 still between them💖🔥💖
Can we just let her talk!!!.... LOL, Scott is the only person on this show I can tolerate.
The older he is getting the hotter he is..also his style is now much better.
Kourtney is so pretty 😍
I luv them together 😍😍😍
Scott: I try to fcuk once a week. \nLmao I believe him too 😂😂😂
KUWTK actually sems interesting for once after watching this
theres still something there for sure it shows the way they looked at eachother
Scott is right he is telling the truth💪
I relate to Kourtney.. She is the oldest and realist of the bunch. Watching her family woes playout seems more realer than anyone else on the show.
Why do you ask them theese questions? It's personal, you can see on Kourtney that she was not so happy about it. RESPECT PRIVACY!!
scott is nigga in a white persons body
The Sisters Of Satan strike again! This time around Scott Disick will turn into a woman like you know who!
I ship them so much
Kourtney only smiles that big when Scott's there...that has to say something
I lo❤e you, Scott!!!!
PLS kill all the Kardashians stop for tv
Hmm wasn't he just pap'd kissing 19 year old Sophia Richie and Bella Thorne (also 19).. they're younger than Kylie ffs and now he is here saying he still tries to fk with Kourtney. This man... 😩
She still looks in love with him....
Only the kardarshians would have a set like this 🙌
Why Kylie is not there geez
Its crazy how much people like scott with her. Hes always cheating on her. Im so glad she left him
Kim needs to F-out of kourtneys airtime always wants the attention on her
Why do minorities lead prostitution and destruction of morals??!
Where can I watch this?
every one in family loves him
lmao I love Scott. Aside from his inconsistency with Kourtney hes hilariousssss
Uuuuugh Kim - Shut to the UP!!!!!!!!! Awe Scott really loves Kourtney!!!!
Omg i love scott lmao
scott is hilarious
1:12
Woow Kourtney is gorge😍
Kourtney has always been my fav!
I love scott hott
Scott is looking so hott!!
Haha Khloe looked so shocked when Kim opened her rude mouth
Kourtney is glowing omg 😍❤️
Majority of long term relationship if they make up and break up many times will never be the same as it once was..too much history and bad memories even if they're being adult about the whole situation now and co parenting their kids.. have loved for each other but not in love things just isn't the same anymore ever again.. speaking from experience 💯
Scott: can we let kourtney talk??\nAlso scott: *starts cutting off Kourtney wehn she's trying to say something
Will its Sarah guess o what no its kourtteny
I COMPLETELY Agree with Scott!  I think they are too cute 2gether, I miss them 2gether, just wish Scott cud get his addictions under control and also not cheat.
They both look great. Scott looks healthy
The separation doing scott good he actually looks better than when he was with her
Scott is my favorite! He's a savage😂😂😂😂always making me laugh 😂
I understand that Scott has made some mistakes, but Kourtney is pretty hypocritical. For example when he was dating Bella Thorne, Kourtney was disturbed by their age difference when at the same time she was dating another man with the more of an age difference (way younger than her). Everyone thought Scott was a sicko but no one criticized Kourtney. They aren't healthy together, but Scott is at least aware that he's messed up. Kourtney doesn't have the faintest clue of how messed up she is because of her entitlement and that's even worse.
Yea,vi would agree with Scott on his point but I still love them together 💖 they both look great
Lol Scott to Kim can you just let her talk! Way to go Scott!!!!
SCOTT IS SO SEXY HOT AND UGH JUST GORGEOUS
Scott can come with me omg
Scott is reckles, but how can you not love the guy. He's so funny and charming :p
Awww i want Kourtney n Scott Back together ❤️ hit like if you feel the same for them ❤️
You can tell they are still in love
I spit in your face n your like *squeaky voice* Hey Beb! 😂😂😂
I think kim and khloe and the family hold the hope that one day Scott will get it together and get back with Kourtney only for the sake of their kids,like the youngest one wont even remember a time when his parents were together :(
Tbh I agree with Scott she only cares if he's doing stuff wrong
my psychotic ex HAHAHA I love scott
One of the most cringiest interviews of all times
kim no one was talking to you
Scott was telling the truth. Its been all over tv how she loves him when he's bad and when he tries its not good enough. That's why she laughing. Realest man on the show 😊
I love the fact that Scott is so real. But he isn't right for Kourtney, I feel she deserves someone loyal just like everyone else.
We already know they fiina be back together. they just need some time apart to do their own thing with different pope. But they're clearly meant to be together. you can seeeee it. not to mention they look hot af together.
Lmao I treat her like royalty in nothing I spit on her face and she's like hey babe 😂😂😂
I never noticed how beautiful Scott is wtf
Ahh! Can't wait no longer😱
This question ain't about you Kim. STFU.
Kim is the only one I like.
I believe what Scott said about him splitting in her face and her response is true. Because we have seen it time and time agin.
They should get back together totally!!!!
He's still handsome wow
She loves him sooo much! You can tell by the way she looks at him <3
I wish they're still a couple
WTF Scott. Way to make an effort with the jeans.
Que entre el desgraciado -Laura  😂😂😂😂
Scott will never find better.
Scott is what got me watching he show when they first came on air.
I wanna hear more of this, why u cut it off
I want them back together
and beautiful planned children you know Barbie and ken\n??
Scott has a point there though. I'm just like Kourtney. A dude will be consistent and will text me often and I'll be like ugh, why is he calling me in the middle of the day, i'm working. But as soon as he stops being all sweet I'll be texting him like Hey you. I don't know why. It must be a disease. I'm sick in the head.
kourt deserve better MAN
So awkward
Cutie patuties!
kourtney is beyond beautiful!
Ya knowww...
Scott looks high af
Scott looks good
Kourtney is such a stunner!
kourtney is 🔥
She looks so gooddd
I'm Kourtney 😂😂😂
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Love uu guysz.
Sad
dude scott looks so hot
Hoe stfu (Kim)

Continue the simulation by entering the Kurzgesagt Reality: https://youtu.be/tlTKTTt47WE
I know this isnt real. So like jim carey says... I am just living in a moment
and were going to die...yay.
God created Earth and everything around it. Just saying.
This video hits me hard\nDoes life even have a purpose any more than learning?
5:48 didn't know they had Converse back then
Tfw living in a video game makes more sense than 99% of religions
But what happens if a simulated being gets aware that it is simulated? Please answer seriously
Who says you aren't the only one being simulated? What if everything you can't see isn't happening.
So, if we exist inside a simulation, and we are unable to prove or disprove this based on our understanding of the natural world, would this be of any consequence to us? Assume that someone were to absolutely prove that our world existed inside a simulation. What would we do? Would knowing this really affect us? Initially, I want the fact to sadden me because everything I thought was real is just simulated... but what is real anyway? Rene Descartes' famous statement of I think, therefore, I am, promotes the idea that, even if the world around us is false, we, ourselves, are real because we have the ability to inaccurately perceive it. I believe this concept still holds true within this simulation theory. Even if we do just exist as a simulation, we still exist, and, to us, we are undoubtedly real. The simulation theory proposes subjective reality, but still reality. In the seventh Harry Potter book, when Harry asks Dumbledore if their conversation had been real or just inside his head, Dumbledore responds like this, Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real? Even if we are inside a simulation right now, and our physics, families, and feelings are simulated, they are still real because of our ability to perceive. This is very settling to me. (I hope this made sense, and I'm totally open to positive feedback regarding this comment, because I'm not at all an expert at logic or theoretical existence, but I'd like to learn!)
You know, what if we just need to ask our animators to give us a sign?
So when I am playing sims and I tell my sim to play on a computer. I am being controlled by someone telling me to control my sim, telling them to control a sim game controlling their own character.
no, we're not. Because, computers haven't been here forever.
We are NPC's
Well it's not like you're able to touch things behind you or film something behind you is it,
What I don't understand is how the science community can believe this might be true but not believe that the world was created by God and appears to be millions of older
Watch Part 2 on Kurzgesagt\n\n... But I just watched part 1 on  Kurzgesagt and was told this was part 2. ... \n\nConclusion: This is a glitch in the simulation.
How would we be self aware then? I don't ever see Mario saying hey bro why do I keep doing this same world over and over.
Even if we are simulated, at least our reality is real enough for us to enjoy
vsauce and kazurzur... kazursgestalt... k- in a nutshell.\ngood video.
I SHALL BECOME THE GREATEST NPC!
But if we are simulated then we couldn't even think about being simulated.
Well what if we get a baby, and since birth we show that baby that it is possible to go through walls, through video editing and such. Afterwards, raising the baby believing it can go through walls since the baby is purely convinced that walls are supposed to act like that. So the baby knows and feels like it can pass through walls.  Will that baby be able to pass through the wall?¿
The Simulation Universe is an awesome idea, but it is only that...an Idea. It can never be proven as fact because it is non-Falsifiable
Even if we were just a simulation. What is the difference really? I mean we still exist. just only as numbers instead of matter. To us there would be no difference whether it was a simulation or not providing the  simulation gave us true free will.
at least in this simulation there is no laging
I don't buy it. It's just another unfalsifiable existential paradox like the many worlds theory. In, fact it's pretty similar.
who else just ran into a wall just because you don't want to be a simulation
Nice office you got there
If I'm a sim, hopefully is not a kid playing cuz I masterbate 23 times a day
So who is NEO?
Anybody else found what Neil degrasse Tyson said very interesting ? Overall my mind can't handle this.
Don't go back to the carpet store.
Wow I thought about that a lot ! What if I'm the a character in a game and everything around me isn't real ? What if my mom and dad and my friends aren't real and they are all programmed to make me feel im living in a real world ... the only thing that I'm sure about is that I am thinking and by that I'm existing
I've thought about this yet in a more religious/creation type mindset. Like I might be the only one with a soul because I can't prove that anyone else has one (because whether or not they have one, they will always act the same)
'Space is an illusion of what our brains can't recognise'
2:29\nLooks like you've mistaken YT with StackOverflow. Let me fix that for you:\nSome of these tags are closed in a wrong way. Put the slashes before closing angle brackets (instead of placing them after opening ones) and your simulation will start to run properly.
It's almost as if they are avoiding the idea of God by using sci-fi terms
3:33 This is an important question of quantum mechanics: if I am throwing a dice into a box, close it and shake it, is the number on top of the dice given, random or non-existing when I am not looking into the box afterword? How do I know wheather or not a planet I am not seeing has physics? When I am lokking at it it surely has physics but we don't know what happens when we are looking away...\nHeck, even light behaves differently if it is measured differenlty.
I have had this thought for years haha.
So... I kill real people when i kill npc's in video games?
If we could program artificial intelligence that could feel all emotions, what makes human life any more valuable than their's?
Day 1432: Still looping through the videos to find an answer.
If this is true, then those who hit the infinitely small chance of being the original universe won't even know they are the original. xD
Very nice collaboration, except for the fact that Kurz gesagt didn't teach you how to pronounce their name
This isn't even regarded as a scientific theory it's truly ridiculous that A Vsauce channel would talk about this.
This is like a Truman Show situation on Ultramode.
Wait so... If i play the sims and i order my sims to play the sims in that sims does that mean i am in a sim controlling a sim playing a sim in the sims?
we are inside a simulation of a simulation of a simulation that simulated a simulation inside another giant simulation
But why would anyone create this fake simulation world? Are they that bored? Do they enjoy watching people die and suffer everyday?
The Matrix has you...
We are not in a simulation
The answer is don't think about it.
If we are programed, what kind of system can hold a universe that is always expanding
I'll be honest, for some reason the simulation and hologram theories really make my brain itch and bring on a huge irrational anger.\n\nMuch in the same way since people get angry when their religious world gets challenged.\n\nI believe this world is real, warts and all, my brain can't accept a higher or lower reality. Even though I know a lot of elements of reality I experience aren't really real at all, from the ground being flat, to the moon's image being out of line with its actual location when it rises or sets, that objects aren't really coloured it's just how light reflects and retracts off of objects. I know all this, and still can't break the reality addiction.
If life is a simulation then why I can't live in Narnia???
Now imagine for a second, that we were in fact just characters in a highly advanced video game, but also imagine that everything we see is really quality graphics, but it doesn't match up to what actually reality looked like? Much like games we have now. If that were the case, what the heck would reality actually look like?
If we are running in a simulation then how do numbers like e or pi exist? infinite numbers = infinite data = impossible
Who have a respawn button
Maybe our world is just a huge sims game played by gigantic aliens of a different dimenssion
If i had a superduper computer\nI would be living like a god in my simulation
If a tree glitched in a forest, and no one is around to render it,  will the developers fix it?
few thoughts I'd like to share, plz counter me if im wrong, but if we are living in a simulation, and will most probably run the same set of simulations in the future, couldn't the same case be for the ones who are simulating us? is there, or is there not a flesh and blood version of our controller, or just a simulation? are we still living in a lie that we are in a truth? if someone is controlling us, and someone else is controlling them and someone is controlling them too, who are we being actually controlled by?
I CREATED THE STARS THAT BECAME THE CARBON IN YOUR MOTHER'S OVARIES
This video is a glitch in the matrix
dont make collab video like this, so annoying
Outside my mind, nothing is real - INVOKER
There's a book based on this theory. The creators of our reality descend down into our reality to eliminate someone who has found a way to override the rules of the simulation. The final battle which ensues is of godlike proportions. Check it out here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B073Q854X2/ref=dbs_a_w_dp_b073q854x2
I think Jake watched the matrix triology one too many times
the irony that the simulation designer know that the simulation know they are inside a simulation
This makes me want to kill myself... just to see if life really is a simulation of course...
If the simulation hypothesis is true, we need to think more bleak than this. Far to much importance put into earth and humans here. We would just be one of the many elements within the entirety of the universe simulation.
that was a wast of time
I dont know you tell me Rick
who didn’t understand one thing he said because i’m very lost...
So if I kill my self will I respawn?
Anyone get reminded of tat Rick and Morty episode named M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
6:53 Thanks! Now I know how to pronounce Kurzgesagt
I couldn't hear a word this guy said because I was read the comments. Comments are better on videos like this lol
No, are  _you_ a simulation?

No

Who should Poet and Vuj FIFA and Chill with next?
my guy on the right looks like a ant
Hi Poet &Vuj, Batshuayi is almost as funny as you two. Please get Pep Guardiola next. Love the show.
Vuj bare wants to laugh when his just chatting in French 😭
French is a dope ass language lol Batshuayi is the man. Chelsea fans who dont rate him should look at his goal to game ratio. Top notch. And he barely ever starts. So how would you know he’s trash
Pretty sure he from belgium
At 0:50 Poet says make sure you start as well  then takes off his glasses ... 😎
i laughed so hard when both of them tried to go to team management and then both if them try to go back and they just started the game #relatable
Poet probably spends as much time with Vuj as his wife.
Diego costa in the starting lineup? 😂
Wait so can he understand and write English but not speak it ?
Passing 59 haha I laughed so hard when he saw that
get Lingard onto the show his reactions will be boss
Batshuayis friend runs his twitter account for those of you wondering
Vuj your a G,Igor Biscan on his back hahahahaha love from Croatia
Honestly, I am being honest one of the top personalities in football. Him and Sturridge are top 2. I would put Sturridge top though as I am a Liverpool fan and I am not being biased but I have just seen him use his personality more, compared to this one video with Mitchy. Haha.
Lol with all the shit this man chat on Twitter I don't believe this. Thought he would be fluent in English.
Aren’t people from Belgium meant to speak good English?
Are u guys trying to win the league and champions league\nNo there trying to get fucking relegated
He definitely tweeted after seeing his card
Fifa and chill with son heung min
I support Liverpool, so I will choose Everton.
He's upset about his rating😂\nDefoe scored 3x more goals than he did😂 and theyre the same rating!
deserves a higher rating just cause how funny he is, what a fkn lad
benjamin mendyyyyyyy we want it now
This dude is tripping. Honestly nothing special. And I'm a Chelsea fan
Awesome to see footballers getting more interactive, be it with the game or people on Twtitter.
He is bit like drogba..good personality and funny
If DRI stood for driving Marcus Alonso would have a 0
Delusional lad. Should get off twitter and put his head down if he wants those stats because he can easily get to that level. says a lot when ur known more for ur twitter banta than ur actual proffesional day job
He’s a straight up baller
Hazard would be joke on fifa and chill
Haha look on the bright side, atleast you're higher than Rashford. 😂 FIFA always get it wrong, man should be 82 at the least.
The thing that annoys me most about copa 90 is everyone in the comments trying to talk like poet and vujanic because they think it will have a better chance on getting on comments below.
Does vuj realise he speaks with the accent of whoever he's talking to, even though he speaking English, going full joey Barton 😂
FIFA 18 rating is a fucking joke. Like seriously a fucking joke
It's funny how these footballers always overrate themselves, just shows that in their direct surroundings there are only people that kiss their ass and are never honest to them.
Hold on am I missing something? Is he not Belgian ???
he seems like the only real footballer irl he swears when his pissed any other players would be scared for there deals
Favorite player on Chelsea believed in him the second I heard he was coming to Chelsea
No wonder he don't play, can't speak fucking English , then again, with Chelsea you probably won't get in if you're English , they've got like 2 English players, most of the squad probably can't speak English lol
It's funny because he's actually shocked that he's shit..
Go to the Ravens and Jaguars game tommorow
Got a bit disappointed that he only spoke French who else ?
Do with Liverpool players
Get more footballers on this please 😂
saw vuj in trafalgar square on tuesday couldn't say hello, gutted
Make sure you start aswell THE ROAST 😂😂😂😂
The card is pretty spot on, but the passing is atrocious. Why did they give him such low passing stats? At least 65 or higher.
8:17 he said vitesse and he's a Chelsea player predicting his future...
Them boys in the back are creepy af
0:47  Make sure you start as well LMFAO
I'm not English and I can confirm it is quite easy to write but the pronunciation is hard because it isn't the same!!!
Poet doing the typical British speaking to a foreigner tactic of just talking very slowly.
Fucking shit
Michys got bants
YUGOSLAVIA👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
the mic's on this channel are always so quiet Lol
.
😂😂😂😂😂 Michy ain't having that FIFA rating at all he probably won't play the new FIFA he was killing me when he said Fucking shit and Bullshit you can see that his English is coming along well he understands but he still isn't able to pronounce most words out loud. The kid is a character and he continues to improve on the pitch
It's a ovo ting fam
FIFA and chill with Mendy next!!
Lukaku fifa and chill

PNL le monde ou rien
Ou sont mes francais?
the fuck is in between batshuayi's leg
Batshuayi will get 20+ goals this season.
Well, I guess my voice was the only thing you heard if you watched the movie with me... *Screaming like crazy*
I would hate to watch it with these people
Tbh it wasn't that scary
I'm the only one who will not see this movie 👍🏻👍🏻😭
dear god! that'show i felt when i saw the movie yesterday
The  it  movie was not scary what so ever more so comedic
Seen the film and the reaction was nothing like that.  This is way over the top!
Oh my God my little brother is 12 and he didn't scream or piss himself
It was a great film, but it wasn't that fucking scary
Mate. The only time a genuine and freaky reaction ever occurred in a movie theatre was when the exorcist was out.
Obviously none you know what the purpose of IT is. IT is not meant to be scary or have jumpscares. IT is suppose to completely freak you out and make people go home to not be completely scared, but more aware and to have nightmares. Movies nowadays has got it stuck in peoples head that since it's a horror movie it has to be scary and it has to have jumpscares, but what IT does is totally separate from any other horror movies out there and that is that IT makes you wonder and the crew knows that the unknown is this scariest thing to alot of people. Just wanted let most you guys know what IT was created for, the director and creator of IT says this.
25 seconds in you can see a clown scaring people at the back
I hope the movie is scary because I'm seeing this tomorrow and it will be my first time seeing a horror movie in theatres so I hope either a clown scares people in the theatre or the movie is really scary plus it is already scary because I hate clowns.
They're adults, they're screaming like little Georgies, I'm 13 and I'm quiet as giant pennywise
Either this is fake or the people in the vid are the biggest pussies ever
Bruh the movie wasn’t even scary it was funny tbh
This was a funny film
Ive been to many cinemas in my day.\nNever ever seen anyone react like that, jumping out seats and crap.\n\nBit ridiculous over the top really.
I was the only person in the cinema when I watched it lol \n12pm on a work day! Now that was creepy af
I still think The Exorcist(1973) is the scariest movie of all time! Damn, that movie gave me the chills!
id walk out of the cinema if the crowd acted like this, get a grip
God, fuck you if hold a balloon up in the pictures.
You'll float too you'll float too you'll floats to You'll float too YOU'LL FLOAT TOOOOOO!
The movie want even scary
The film was scary but it wasn’t to the point where I or anyone would audibly scream so either this is fake or they got a bunch of easily scared people and said we will pay you to see it
I think they were paid to scream.
Standard film over hyped money spinner this film wasn't one bit scary these audiences members must live sheltered lives to be scared of that shit
When I went to watch this movie last week,   there was at least 35+ people in the cinema and literally no one screamed. The movie isn't really scary just abit jumpy and really creepy.
I'm 9 I watched it didn't jump
work at a IR for a minute and you get more experience of horror that that
Like ever other lame horror movie, this one used loud noises to make you jump, but it wasn't scary. It would have been a better movie if it wasn't trying so hard to be scary.
Can clearly see them look behond themselves. Obviously someone having to force a scare out of them
You do realize they are all screaming cause a clown is running round in the cinema. E.g. 27 seconds you can see a hand reaching out trying to grab someone.
Best thing I've seen in a while
Cinema full of pussies, looking at the audience in this film makes me want to reel back in fright, bunch of fugly cunts.
I mean I jumped a couple of times but that was it
sombody should of told them it's a 12a for fuck sake
great to know what a choreographed crowd of a premiering of the movie looks and sounds like
The get scared of my big black cock
I haven't yet seen the movie, but personally, I just don't think it will be scary. It may have a a few jump-scares and instense moments that leave you feeling anxious, but I doubt it's scary; although, I guess it does depend on the individual.
Watching this tomorrow for my birthday, I'm so excited, I'm actually hoping i shit my self 😆
I bet your watching this on your bed
Before they sleep : Shit I am going to have nightmares...
Wtf I admit it was a really scary film but calm the fuck down the whole cinema wasn’t screaming at the top of there voices this is a load of shit
0:18 one of them is litterly smiling
It wasn't scary, it was more creepy. \n\nThese people are clearly over-reacting, like fuck.
Got to b Americans over reacting to a film that's not scary bunch of muppets
This movie is not scary. These people have clearly dug themselves a hole by hyping up a flawed movie to such an extreme that to be seen not enjoying it or not reacting as expected to the “scary” scenes would make them look as retarded as they must feel after walking out of the movie pretending to have loved it
The problem with adults watching horror, is that most have been exposed to so much horror in movie, tv and games, that they become immune to it. Horror only really works on children, so while I loved this movie, I found it more creepy than scary. I watched the tv mini-series when I was 8 or 9 and it was affective then, as I'm sure this movie would be if I was seeing it now as an 8 or 9 year old. People think they're to smart for horror, so once they start putting the pieces together, they can usually guess what's coming next. \n\nTo me, this was an affective horror movie and I think that whilst there was blood and violence, I think it would have been suitable for a 12A rating in UK.
Americans are always so over the top
This is as fake as Donald trumps tan, people were probably screaming cause some guy tried the cock in the popcorn box trick
It wasn’t that scary, this is massive over reacting and all fake
What an over reaction!
wow! its almost as if these people were trying to be scared. So happy i watched this with a standard crowd what a bunch of exaggerating buffoons.
You'll float down here if your either supernatural or lighter than water
It wasn't this scary lol
um this is fake i went and saw this movie and not one person screamed
Thanks to everyone that didn't watch my video, you've avoided cancer!
This is why i don't watch horror movies in cinemas
fake as ahs is scarier than this comedy
No it not that scary m8

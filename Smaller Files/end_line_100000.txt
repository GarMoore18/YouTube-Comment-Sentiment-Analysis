I don't understand why Charlamagne is so hellbent on Cardi going #1...especially to beat a legend like Lauren Hill. I like Cardi and all, but I don't care if she goes 1 or stays at 2. Like WTF? Live ya life dude. And to beat Lauren Hills record...ehhh.....idk about that. Especially for that song...idk man. Maybe next record. \n\nBut real talk, I'm not liking Charlamagne hear. He's such a big time hater with any and everybody. A guy calls up to say he's happy he's getting married, having a child, etc...and he ALWAYS has something negative to say. This is actually this show. And that's 1 show. He does that all the time. A negative nancy. Just gotta always say something haterish and clownish...even to other celebs that come on the show. But with 1 or 2 people, now you wanna be the TOTAL OPPOSITE. TF is up with that bro?? He should have that same energy ALL THE TIME. I didn't like that. I like Cardi B too, but get off her nutsack dude. FOH.
that new teeth talk lol
Thats how strippers act its just not cute during the day time
This interview was garbage.
She single handedly ruined the English language in one interview
Yesssss you can do it Miss Cardi B oh she going to do that that's my girl don't trip keep your head up always keep God first and always keep positive people in your life and always keep your Bible open to Psalms 23 love you girl you're the bomb
Can't get past 5:21 on this video. BYE NEXT!

Lame.
She's way better than  Nikii Manja
Remy faded, Iggy faded, cardi may fade but the indisputable fact is that Nicki hasn't faded
Cardi B is magnificent
yesss, Red Sox!
FAKE- hair-lips-eye lashes-nose-tits-ass-and a child like personality. Smh she a mess
Can she stop with the fucking voice thing?
1 hit wonder
NOT THE BUTTER KNIFEEEE
Why is this trending now lol
Blame the whitey right?
Why is this trending? But it's cool. One day I will be on trending
Season 2's finished, why is this trending now?
nice job youtube
See, I get it. Its an all black cast. That's okay. There should be variety for people to find a show that they find relatable...but in game of thrones, Rick and morty, breaking bad, Shows that mainly feature white people or white writers, at no point imply they 'hate black people' by having one of the characters do something or say something racist.\nSo why do we think its okay for shows like this to have an underlying hit at white people?
I remember the first time I watched Issa it was on Awkward Black Girl i still watch it on youtube
Not sure why I passed on this when it first premiered, but this show looks good.
My boy Anderson .Paak🔥🔥🔥
Someone said this is the fresh breed of black privilege and embodies typical rich BLM members. I aint seen it but that's what people telling me
Why does every show about black people somehow have to mention how much they hate white people lmao
What song is that just after the minute mark

Anderson paak ayyy
Pure ideological propaganda
I will sub to anyone who subs me when you are done comment done:)
HBO is going downhill. A shame but every company has to peak at some point.
In real black relationships the man beats the women and then leaves her and the kids to somehow make it. So I'm not really buying the whole gimmick of class and good manners that this show is trying to portray the black community as having. Maybe add in a scene of a black man squealing 'WELL DO IT THEN NIGGA!!' at one of the women who then swings her handbag at him and gets savagely knocked out to the chorus of 'WORLDSTAR!'.................then I will tune in and watch.
Where the white women at????
What is songs?
I feel sorry for the people who thought this would be the see you again from fast and furious.
this song is amazing as a country version !
all of you saying ''shes back' can stfu y'all are fake fans. If you supported her you wouldn't have put her down post Disney channel... Leave.
She's so cute
Its it weidr that im 28 and still watch hanna montana in the fire stick???? Its a funny show!!!!😅😅😅😅
I remember having this song on my iPod Nano when I was younger😂
Is that Julia Ross from Everlife?
can she remake all the hannah montana songs in this style i'll listen the shit out of them
I want to hear when I look at you, I love that song . Who's else want to hear that song again?
This is awesome! Love the country/folk vibe it has!
My younger self is loving this very much thought you would never sing this song again I was wrong lol  love ya miley
I hear a lot of Stevie Nicks there. This is some high quality stuff.
you're playing with my heart, miley
Miley looks so beautiful with long hair.
Love it almost as much as I love the outfit. Love seeing Miley getting back to her country roots like in the backyard sessions
How many blacks do you think she's had sex with? Ew.

Damn, the girl playing in the back at 2:18 is so beautiful
I've been waiting for this for so long

I have goosebumps watching this
I'M CRYING ON MY GAWD
THIS was Truly The MILEY I raised my then fetus now 11yrOld daughter On..❤️💗love to Good Ol Miley💗☺️
I watched the whole thing and saw no vag. This is an imposter
She's really laying on that good ole southern DRAWL
I can't wait to see you again.. wait... I'm waiting to see her for the first time... Fuck Miley, could you come in Milan on 4th November? (4th November it's my B-day)
Thanks for bring Hannah Montana's vibes , i love you sosososososso much <3 I remember this on best of both world tour <3 i'm crying
I fucking love this (and those shoes 😰💕)
What a GREAT voice ! She's a great country/folk singer.
is that Dan Kanter on guitar?
HANNAH MONTANA WILL RISE AGAIN SOMEDAY I CAN FEEL IT
She needs to do all her Hannah Montana songs in this style.
she sounds like DEVIL after joining illuminati!😅
This is glorious. Absolutely glorious. Nothing short of glorious. 🙌🙏♥️
Holy shit my childhood. I wouldn't mind if she re-visits all her old songs on that CD by her I used to own 😭 heck I would even buy it on vinyl lol
this is a nice throwback
My childhood has been restored! I couldn't help it but to sing along and surprisingly I still remember the words
All in all, she does have a really good voice.
Listen at 0.75 speed, sounds so jazzy and sexy haha.
Reminds me of stevie nicks from Fleetwood Mac if you guys are not familiar please I urge you to 😊
I love Miley 😍😍\n\nHer vocals is the glory 💜💙💚❤💛
She is so talented. She didn't have to be so extra to get attention. I really like this side of her and I hope she contunues.
this song would sound so bomb slowed down with a haunting feel to it
It's fun putting your name in songs. 😂
She likes Elvis, I look like elvis.
i wish she did'nt fuck her teeth up, she shud have stayed as natural as possible
You've always had it Miley!!!!! <3
I love this song so much that I feel like I wrote it for her <3   I like how her house is painted like the old chicken coup from the Hanna Montana movie lol
I'm actually getting emotional while listening to this and reading all the comments. I remember when people thought she started going off the deep end but I also remember still loving her and loving her new style an music. Miley, you are truly an inspiration and I feel blessed to have had a childhood that included an artist such as yourself. Thank you, Miley. ❤
I'm crying I miss the old Disney, Hannah,Zach and Cody, wizards of waverly place, ect
This was my favorite song when I was younger!!!!!! Memories of my childhood!!!! 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
So she finally stopped shoving cannon balls up her ass.
At first I didn't really like the country mix on it but it just shows how people change and they're vibes and styles change and I love it
No way!!!! This made me happy
What do they call Miley Cyrus in Europe?\n\nKilometery Cyrus
I used to love this song woow
Release this on iTunes! It's so good! 😭
I never thought Miley was attractive but sh'es beautiful in this video.
Omg pure perfection 😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥 I f*cking love this girl forever!!! My Idol since 2006

Los que apoyan el reggaeton.. Ponen la mano arribaaa\nNo olvidas es con el Reggaeton que tu eschuchas cancion en Espanol pal el mundo entero.
Vamos a subir este video como la espuma de la leche :)
Shaki te estas bien bonita\nAunque también me gustabas cuando estabas mas gordita\nCon el pelito negrito y la cara redondita\nY así medio rockerita
Que buena esta shakira
Shakira sos la mejor... pero tus ultimos temas estan sonando todos iguales... yo quiero que vuelva la shakira de antes... la rockera la shaki de la cual me enamore... diosa
It kind of has the beats of hasta el amanacer
3:00 Cuando lo reguetonero se le nota a Nicky Jam por encima.
que Top esta música!!
quiero un tipo atento y cariñoso;
muy buena cancion.como siempre todas sus cancines...super fan.shaki...nicki jam..♡♡
SHAKIRA UNA DIOSA YA EXTRANABA ESOS SUS BAILES QUE LO HACE BIEN...SU CABELLO PELIRROJO QUE LINDO LE QUEDA ME RECUERDA A SUS INICIOS...NICKY JAM UN PAPUCHO
Quien quiere que ese video llegue al 1,000,000,000
Es lo que andaba buscando el cielo pateando na naa na anaa ups me equivoque de video
Desconozco por completo a Shakira.\n\nDonde estan las letras de laudry service, donde están los ladrones, o  pies descalzos???? \n\n *Vamos Shakira, puedes hacer mejor música que está.*
Si la cancion se llamara perra fiel intentarian boicotearla como a Maluma. Igualdad de genero, claro que si
no se pero pienso que el baile de shakira estuvo de mas
https://youtu.be/55rOd-5kekQ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I dont like the way Shakira dances here.. She seems a monkey trying to jump
bullshit video ever
love you shakira /love from Pakistan
Q significa soñar con una persona q se casa
prefiero tirarme por un balcón que escuchar esto
Paulinho 👏👏👏
Messi will always be Messi no matter wat..thanks for the pass
http://www.ermail.com/klik/UHJQamcM\nHey Guys check on this link and have fun.  Great to enjoy.  Have fun and earn and good game too.
Please, next time don't put final score on the title. Thank you
Dembele is out for half the season 4-5 months
how can barca be this bad?? it doesn't make any sense...
La Liga stadiums always seem to have empty seats lol.
Ter Stegen again & again. Making same mistake like he did last time vs Real Madrid. He should learn to stay at goalpost to widened the distance & increase the chance to block long shoot. If he doesn't learn this, sooner or later he will end up being burden to the team again. Neuer, Navas & Buffon have better knowledge on this
Gaku Shibasaki👍\nProud of him being Japanese🇯🇵
pliz dont discuss signings... its over now ,more over d coach know how to use them n at what position ..juz enjoy barca ...d beauty of football....gr8 goals nyways
What a goal by the Japanese dude!! And what a save on Messi's free kick!
Barcelona's defend is fantastic with umtiti and semedo
Pique was terrible in this game
Who else want semedo in starting eleven like
Glory supports are real in these comments thinking they know shit stfu 10 year olds
Spanish people are fucking retarded, look how their commentators sound
Predict sound credibility born obviously international orange freeze gate even.
Why is pique still in the squad? He's just getting older and horrible as a defender. Time to drop him asap
That freekick by messi was so good and the goalkeeper managed to make a world class save. The curve was perfect, what a save from the goalkeeper.
He scored 1 goal wtf why is everyone bumming him now
Remember these are the sort of games barca lost or drew last season which cost them la liga. So a brilliant start.
If you say goal again i hope your mother dies of cancer
He is strong.. He can be a false number 9😐
Is Barcelona become AS Roma??? jk
The Getafe goal was from Mars .
WE THE FANS OF BARCELONA, castigated PAULINHO....why? I mean seriously PAULINHO .....he is coming to D GREAT BARCELONA....NO PLZ ...but when he arrived to d great Barcelona,  MY Realmadrid, MU, Chelsea  fans  made fun of me and they used to say this is the level of barcelona ......What I replied them...wait and watch bcoz we are just fans and don't know the capability of other players who played in different countries and with different clubs....SCOUTS R THERE....and they brought him to D GREAT BARCELONA......IT MEANS, SOMETHING IS THERE........AND NOW important 3 PTS, due to this 3 pts, last  year we lost laliga .....
Where are the fouls done on suarez which shd have been penalties
നെയ്മർ ഇല്ലങ്കിൽ നമ്മൾ ജയികും
FC Roma xD? 3rd kit is similar to roma no?
Asian football is improving, Japan has a very strong national side so does Iran! And China is starting to get on the right track as they are spending billions on the football not only buying big names from abroad but also on its youth program! I see China to top Asia in the next two decades time! They will have a very bright future
A clear penalty for getafe and a red card for pique but as always UEFAlona gets away with it
Neymar one of the best player out off the team but messi is wonderful
This team is nothing. They might as well trade Suarez and Messi.
5:03 lol, look at Jordi Alba getting on his knees! It´s been a while since Leo shot a freekick like that.
roberto is not for semedo position. If he wanted to replace him and give him some rest he should put vidal in and roberto is great in the midfielder, but really our midfielder sucked today but whatever new coach is doing it is working so far and new Kit away for barca this season is poor, red not cool at all, not barca colour at all.
suarez is turning to a shit striker.he has lost his mojo.very slow not skills can't play at wing.we need a.replacement
Dembele is the worst barca transfer ever!!
Vai Corinthians Paulinho
Paulinho = Vai CORINTHIANS.
Nacer brasileño es nacer con el futbol en las venas cuando no aparece el mejor del mundo LEO o SUAREZ MORDELON aparece otro mostro como  paulinho dejen que agarre ritmo para que lo vean crecer \nLastimosamente se lesiono Ousmane Dembélé pronta recuperación
No se porque pero este nuevo  AS ROMA no me gusta!
เปาลินโญ่ สุดยอดมากครับ
Paulinho beastly supersub.
suarez needs to be benched small
noooogggggggooooaaaalllllll😆l
Viva Barcelona 😍😍😍
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!
Denis Suarez 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🤗🤗
JERCY IS BAD
日本人 いたらぐー
Lord Paulinho scored!!!
This is cool
messi did a good shot 😵😵
Dembelé  120 kilos ,   JA JA JA JA JA
Where is messi goal? Oh wait....
Wow barcea
good
Dont forget about denis
the  outro is awesome
Messi
#BartomeuOut
barca lose yeyyyy
Boom Boom paulinho,Denis Suarez
2:02  ???   :DDD
Shibazaki, mi único héroe en este lío
Dembele hahahah make me laugh so bad for 150 million hahahah
Эу сучара
Barca Barcccaaaaa!!!!
Where is Nelson Semedo?🙁
Paulinho The BEAST
Apik kaose kang
Getafe really strong team

Paulinho like TANK or BULLDOZER 9:07
Shibasaki is very very good 💪
0:45  ¿Shibasaki usando un gorro?
Pauline o 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
XVIDEOS -----> GETAFE. YOU WON'T BELIEVE 👌👏👏👏
Yes, Paulinho my BOOOOY!!!
Paulinho!🔥
Cabrones enseñen el penalti a Suarez que no pitó el arbitro
Dios mío!!!!! El estadio del Getafe lleno!!!!! The end is near!!!! Pedid un deseo!!!!!!
2:24 fuera de juego no pitado que no cuesta un gol por muy poco. Pero no pasa nada que es contra el Barça, así que 0 repeticiones, ni se comentó. Todo OK
Paulinho 🐂🐂🐂🐂💪💪💪💪
Paulinho body balance =  99
Shibasaki ...what a goal!!!
Está para gol del año el del año el de getafe
sigo pensando que paulinho no vale eso :/
Cual es el nombre de los narradores
Pauliño marco, porque al defensor de Getafe le falta experiencia. Prácticamente lo dejo avanzar. Aunque le voy al Barcelona, reconozco las cosas como son. JUGARON MAL, El equipo no se acopla.  Este año no hay liga, ni copa, ni nada para el Barcelona. Este año solo Fichajes POPULISTAS, pero NINGÚN planteamiento serio. Jugadores MALOS. Mas de expectativas que de resultados!  Los buenos jugadores demuestran quien son, estén donde estén. Y ese grupito para mi no tiene nada especial de nada.
Pigue nie bzyknął Shakiry przed meczem bo to jaki ten chłop gra ostatnio piach to masakra:/ Potrzebny stoper od zaraz
My dumbass thought Barca were Roma
Paulinho gemius🏆🏆🏆
I actually lol'd at matthew talking about his neck roll 😂😂 oh please get rid of it \n\nBeautiful photos 😭❤
I'm a photographer so seeing this and hearing your opinions on the images is so inspiring. Loved the photos and the decorations and everything 💛💛💛
My pyjama bottoms are being eating by my arse 😂😂😂😂 so funny. Gorgeous photos 😍😍
Thank you guys for sharing your special day with all of us! It looks like it was a magical day. 💖💖💖
Theres just SOO many little fine details in your wedding that made it so lovely
Oh wow Helen these photos are the culmination of the work we've seen you put in throughout the vlogs in the lead up to the wedding and I have to so you absolutely outdid yourself. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by a wedding! Absolutely love your theme and your flower arrangements and pops of colour were just to die for and it looks like everyone had such an amazing time. Thank you so much for sharing, much love 💜 xx
Your wedding photos are all so lovely! Looked like it was an amazing day 😍
Crying at 'reverse neck'.
Beautiful!! I'm getting married in 3 weeks! I'm super nervous and stressed about it 😅. But, seeing you two looking back at your magical day gives me the happy feels! Congrats you two! 💕💕💕 you're an inspiration!
They're beautiful!!  The photos of Maff and his friends look like they could be Mumford and Sons and I love it!!
What was your first dance song?
It's nice to see the end result after watching all your planning in your vlogs! It looks like you both had a very special and magical day! Xx
*there's no funny comments to look at.*
Lovely 😊 \nPs. I fancy Connor so hard! He is my young Kurt Cobain! 💔
Most epic wedding of all fucking time
So beautiful! I love how colorful it was without being tacky at all! People are often so scared of color but you did it Right! GORG!!
SUCH A GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER
Helen, seems like I'm close to the first to comment on your video, thought i'd take the chance to tell you how much I love all of your videos! Thinking you might definitely see this comment... But just want to make sure you know how great you are, and how down to earth, genuine and lovely, and how much I always look forward to watching your videos! Love how you switch things up now and then and try different things! You're not scared to do you or take risks with fashion makeup or your video styles! You are like my dream best friend that I've never met. Keep doing what you're doing, you're beautiful! Lots of love!  Xxx
I got engaged yesterday so instead of watching all of your adorable wedding videos and dreaming of the day, I get to plan one too!  Can't wait to film all the fun vids for it.  Your wedding looked like a magical carnival dream! 🍿 🍾  🎡
As an outdoorsy sort of bloke, I have to say that your wedding day looked superb. That great hall looked excellent. Lookslike you all had a great day.\nCongratulations
this was absolutely great! thank you for sharing. perfect commentary. very proud to see you growing into such an incredible person; have subbed since the beginning og helen------
Barney in the conservatory with the candlestick hahah my first thought when I heard you say Barney in the conservatory 🤣🤣
I don't even know why the picture of Lola at the wedding got me so nostalgic but it really did! I just remember you getting Lola when your life was so different and I realised I've watched your life completely change! It's been such a pleasure to see you sort of 'grow up' in a way! Thank you so much for sharing your life with us, you will forever be my favourite YouTuber! Beautiful wedding and lovely video as always. Lots of love!xxx
these are stunning, so happy to see you had such a lovely day  <3
I love how different your wedding was. It was so stripped back and simple in a way. More about the fact you were getting married than all this flouncy shit some weddings have. The photos are gorgeous ❤️
Such a nice idea to talk us all through the pictures! Thank you for sharing :}\n(I like this so much more than the movie)
Number 28 on trending yeyyyyy!!!!! Love them so much x x x
I kept thinking she said butt holes lol, but Helen you looked stunning and those photos were everything ❤️️❤️️❤️️❤️️
why am I crying watching this, really moving Helen, have been watching you for years and so happy for you both xx
So so happy for the two of you!!   Looked like you had the best day ever and will be having the best life together that two people could possibly come by!!!
fab!! i love this and both xo
Your wedding looked amazing! I hope all of the photos helped bring the day back in to focus for you. ❤️ I just wanted to say I really love the way you took the carnival wedding theme, which has become rather trendy, and made it completely your own. From the video to all the photos I can see that your personalities and styles shine through in all the details.
Helen who did your veil??? So fab!
Oh its all so rainbow and lollipops i love it!
Love these pics. I'm having a barn wedding next summer - thanks for all the inspiration! 👍🏻
Lovely photos! \nAlso would love a tutorial on your eyemakeup in this video 😍😍
What an unbelievably lovely video, and I'm not even halfway through. Thanks so so much for sharing, it was like seeing the pictures of a friends wedding 💕
Wow! That was awesome, I think I smiled for 18mins straight, congratulations.
Been waiting SOOO long for this one 🎈💓💫🕶
Watching this makes me so happy, the pictures are all so lovely and the wedding looks so unique and fun! Congratulations <3
I LOVE your purple veil omg! if 8 ever get married I would easily do a purple veil!
If I was getting married again I'd defo do it like yours.
Seeing the stuff as you were buying it, I thought I would be a bit hodgepodgey. It's turned out beautifully!
This looked like the most incredible wedding. Glad you had a lovely time ❤
The bridesmaids dresses went to we'll with all the colours! I remember you getting lots of unnecessary criticism about your choice of colour combinations for the dresses, but your vision really came true as far as one can see in the photos! :D
This video made me so happy
My heart is 😭 crying with so much love ❤️ \n Must say that the weeding has a lot of things that I in a daily basis I don't like, Such as sunflowers and farm things, and you manage to pull over one of the best weddings I ever seen. Fantastic job you two!!!
I love how creative your wedding was. So nice to see something differnt  🖒🖒
your wedding was just gorgeous....ugh. It was so you! Seems like it was a great day; love from Boston USA!
Your wedding looks beautiful ❤️\nThis has literally given me inspiration for my own wedding xx
I'd love to watch some more arts and crafts you do Helen I find it fascinating xxx
Looks like the funnest wedding ever
You can so see you and Maff's personalities in these photos, so much character! I love it❤️ Don't know if you've answered this before but what was your first dance song? Would love a little insight into the music you chose! Hope you're still loving being newlyweds! X
Thanks for sharing Helen and Maff xx Helen you always make me want to chew gum 😂
I just love the amount of colour and character in every picture! These have so much personality compared to most wedding pictures :)
I've followed you since god knows how long from a young teenager to an adult today , I feel like I've grown as a person with you ❤ You're amazing . Again , congratulations , may you two live happily ever after ❤❤
That location!!! And all of the decorations and activities, seriously amazing! 💜
The photos are so beautiful!!!!!! Love you loads!!! Also the outro is so cool xD
I Love Your Wedding Photos😍
God that looks so fun! Thank you for sharing :)
Those are SO GOOD ❤
You guys are so cute 💗 love the photos, everything looked so unique and colourful!
I love all the details you had!! That photo booth is amazing and then all your food vans. Amazing. Venue looks gorgeous
Aww Maff looks tired, well done for working so hard all the time. :) Lovely photos Helen, so great to see the wedding after all the preparation!!
You look so beautiful and all the candid photos are so nice!
You and Matthew are beautiful !!!
Awww I smiled all the way through 💕
Deja vu- isn't this the video from yesterday?
This is so lovely, thankyou for sharing it. Out of curiosity what was your first dance song? Totally cool if you don't want to share btw as it is obviously very personal :)
some very nice photos there :)
This is so so sweet <3 Loved that photo where you're smiling at each other right before the ceremony!!
Excited to watch this 💕
Your amazing Helen😊❤️👍Thanks for doing what you do 💕✌🏻
I loved this! Felt like I was a close friend being shown all of your lovely wedding pics 😁 This just goes to show how important getting the right photographer for your wedding day is. So many people want to scrimp and save on the photographer and don't realise the dedication and effort that goes into getting the perfect shots for your big day. My brother got a cheap wedding photographer and ended up having no pictures with my mum in! So it's always worth spending that bit extra - you'll be looking back on those pictures for the rest of your lives :)
your husband is so beautiful
Helen your dress was STUNNING. Where was it from?
Beautiful pictures! Congratulations xxxx
S
How cute !!!!
Hipster cringe!!! #obvious
mazal tov
Aww this is really lovely <3

Such beautiful  pictures  nice job
Most beautiful wedding😍
Loved this
Awwww!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
💜awesome
So cute 😁😍
Haven't I see this already?
I watched this yesterday
Cute couple. You guys kinda look like siblings to me
How did the family politics work out after? I saw your mum and dad in the same room when you were getting ready!
Cutting the the cake was the most awkward pointless part of our wedding. Looking back we wouldn't have done that, you didn't miss anything lol
He looks so happy 😑😂
Such a cute videoooo Xx
_Thinkabada🎵_
Reminds me of Rhianna , but really very good and higly talented . Dear Jessy , try to find your own style. You re georgeous, don t need to copy anyone !!
Girl ... You aren't more DIVA\n\n\nI'M DISGUSTING
Was going to comment on how disappointed I was in this girl for over sexualising the video, but I see its purpose now. She was a slave and in bondage to the industry and her experiences of fame. The part where the mask vanishes is symbolic. Being in black then white as a way to show she is purifying herself of it and being true to who she actually is, and not what the industry wants her to be. The falling rose petals are also symbolic in relation to her new e.p, R.O.S.E
boring track. at least we become a nice butt to see. \o/ sex sells.
The music indutry tell artists how to act why do you think Katy Perrys image has changed so much in a short time and they did the same with miley cyrus.
This gets better with every listen. I'm obsessed 🙌🏼🔥
who is she singing about?
I just love her voice so much
Luke James think about that..
this would be better if it was  more toned done and acoustic *note not hating queue the hate*
who is she talking about? Omg
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👑 you and Teyana Taylor would be dope working together
Hey, please check out some of the original songs I've written on my channel, and let me know what you think!
This is so real and raw. It really talks to people who've delt with heartbreak...
Who was this about?
Well damn Ms Jessie...blasting this while driving soon
did james blake have anything to do with this track?
I can relate to this realness! 🔥🔥🔥
Jessie J has such a beautiful voice, it just makes you want to sing along right away.
Woah girl. Yas, it's about time. Come thru Jessie.
i am sorry ger those celebs whose minds ruined by illuminati
When I say I was waiting on this....... 👀Bruh 🙌🙌🙌🙌
definitely one her best songs
I scream yes... and you say not.... think about that🔥 Yessssssss!!!JJ
No high notes and such but this song gives me goosebumps like in dying because of it.
Love Jessie j. She is a inspiration. I'll be your fan forever.
WHO PISSED YOU OFF? Ooooooooh weee I need names
This is so amazing! At first I was disappointed that the high notes and the crazy runs weren't in this, but then I listened to the words and really got into the song. This is ART, people! This is incredible.
So sexy love it. Love you jessss
The queen is back
so proud of you 💖💖💖
This is so good!
Hey can you guys help us get to 150 subs??
Good to have you back Jessie 👊🏿✊🏿be of the realest out !! #TeamUK
Someone's been listening to Robert Glasper...
Anyone who's been sleeping on Jess for all these years just got woken the fuck up 🔥🔥
BUY THE SONG ON ITUNES !! DON'T LET THIS FLOP.  https://t.co/OQp8PWvux2
Best thing I've heard/seen in a while 👌 you go, Jessie.
NEW MUSIC?? MY ASS IS ALIVE
Nothing like s&m and a bunch of shots of her arse to really sell this emotional song
Hey guys! My name is Malik Charles...im really tryna get my music heard and would appreciate any support! I make music about love,life,pain and try my best to reach all people. Please take a listen... https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Fuck ts, this is the shit!!!
Finally. You're being you. No negative comments can bring you down. ❤️ I finally see YOU!
I just needed this kind of music coming from an artist like you. Pure talent and personality, not another song destined to be a hit without a personal mark on it. All my support on this new and intimate era 🌹  This is flawless Jess x
Who else is a heartbeat for life?
💞

ariana grande who? beyoncé who? FUCKING MARIAH CAREY WHO?????
Damn what was she thinking. What's that '' Look at me I am so alternative '' craze that has taken everyone over?
dirty slut
Is this about dr. Luke cus it sure sounds like it
Y does she have to be neaked??? U need Jesus
Would this song about her relashionship with Luke James?
Very Ugly Perform...don't have the goals ..this is only Porn Acting
*THUMBS UP IF YOU THINK THIS LINER CAN DEFEAT VOLDEMORT IN ONE GO, HAH!*
This look is everything!! You're absolutely my fave
Just go to google and search: WUMO SEO. Its the most popular Seo agency throughout the world. When they cant rank your site, they offer100% money-back guarantee. I support this company.
Would you be willing to do a look with the pallet based on Slytherin? That's my house~
I'm not gonna even lie, I'm not good at makeup! But I have so much of it...😐
sorry but that lipstick is too much for that look...i mean it't so dark and intense it draws attention from the eyes in my oppinion.... and the eye look is gorgeous
This look is everything 😭 How about you do a make up look inspired by each Hogwarts house? I loved this one and I'd be curious about the other houses as well ❤
This one is for the fandom!
Nikkie is so beautiful with and without makeup and her talent is like from another world ♥️✨
I'm the type of the guy who watches nba highlights, some video game stuff, tech stuf and music videos. Why is this on my recommended videos?
Please do a Slytherin inspired makeup 🐍🐍 love you so muchh💚💚💚
if you do a test do the one at pottermore...
Ravenclaw is so sleep on. Yall better wake up soon cause we taking over 💅
So glad you finally looked at storybook cosmetics nikkie! They've been coming up for a while now and I'm glad they're getting some recognition!
GIRL\n\n\n\n\nDO MY MAKEUP EVERDAY\n\n\n\n\n\nI MAKE MYSELF LOOK LIKE A FREAKING JELLYBEAN I NEED YOU.
You should do the test in pottermore
Jesus! That's a lot of make-up... Looks good, though.
Your headband is SO BEAUTIFUL!!! But then again you are aswell!!! I just LOVE your style!
The only way to truly know what house you are in is by the official J.L Rowling website Pottermore not a weird buzz feed quiz hhhhh I REALLy wish you had used that instead. Gahhh
Once again, Buzzfeed has taken away from fandoms
Fabulous video. Lots of fun. But I have to know, where is that headband from? I absolutely love it & I just have to have it. Anyone know where to get it? Pls?!!
I've been a Gryffindor on every quiz I've ever taken. So I'm pretty glad you did too. Now only if we could have the same makeup skills.
I love your channel I just joined
I love the look❤ I definitely think you should do inspired makeup looks on the rest of the houses 🤗
Where did she get that headband???
Since you're a Makeup Wizard, can you put me in a spell to make a magical look like this???
I love this look its just amazing I would for you to do one for hufflepuff and the other harry potter houses x
you should do a separate video on the slitheran look
Makeup doesn't make you attractive
I love this video so much, it was such a creative idea!☺️
I usually think it's weird when people add red eyeliner, but dang can she work it!!
look how precise is her liner omg i want her to be my surgeon
i deadass thought the title said meme magic and my kek came out
You should have tried pottermore for the quiz. Just saying:))
Nikkie you make me so happy x
Do a green look, also!! Please, Nikkie!!!!
Yasss I'm a new Subbie, I absolutley love Harry Potter, I also got Gryffindor at 35% and Ravenclaw at 28% p.s. Your Wonderful!
Girl taking the buzzfeed quiz?! No Pottermore or NOTHING
I'm Gryffindor too but my fiancé believes it's wrong and I am slytherin
I'm a Gryffindor as well! :)
I'm a Slytherin 🐍🐍
You should do a tutorial for each house
YES NIKKI! Gryffindors are the best btw
4/5 quizzes put me in Slytherin lmao. One put me in Ravenclaw 😂😂
When Nikki's inner nerd comes out 😂💕
I really miss how you used to do so many looks instead reviews :(
I thought you were going to do the Pottermore sorting hat quiz 😐
Beautiful look, as always ! I wish when you tried new palettes like this though you would show a quick swatch of all the colors so I knew what else I'd be buying it for.
That diadem where can I get it??!
omg that red eyeshadow is litterally everything i need right now ! getting this pallet as soon as I can .
Omg me and nikkie have the same pop socket
If you want your official Hogwarts House, there's a quiz on Pottermore ;)
I'd do anything for you do my makeup 😍😍😍
I was hufflepuff with ravenclaw only 1% behind
You should do a Harry Potter series like this!!!!!!
The Harry Potter references 👏👏👏
She probably won't see this nor anybody in the comment section but.. What is the colour of her nails, the brown shade? It's so pretty
Beautiful! I wish I could do makeup like this
I hope you will do a look for the other houses. Thank you for jumping out of your comfort zone, when you do that you get beautiful jeweled colored looks. Cannot wait to see what other looks you achieve.
You should do a Hunger Games inspired make up look! 😆
I already knew my Hogwarts house was Slytherin from Pottermore but I decided to take this one just to see what I would get... I got 25% for each house!! I'm equal parts all of them!
who's in ravenclaw ????
I love how you do your makeup😍
Nikkie why? No hits and oh god no's since 2 months ago.😭
I'm a Hufflepuff 💛💫🌻🐝
A Harry Potter house series would be magical 😍✨
Can I piss on your face cunt?
Will you please do my homecoming makeup???😩😩
Damn Nikkie im gonna go dig my hard disk and watch Harry Potter
Without makeup she looks like that girl from 90 day fiancé the one who's getting scammed
You're headband is everything! ❤
it looks absolutely gorgeous 😍
You're so gorgeous 😭😍
can you try fenty beauty
do slytherin makeup theme !
Lovee 💓💓💓
Ravenclaw! Go brainy girls! ^W^

You're soooo beautiful wow
Hufflepuff pride yaa🐝🍋☀️
OMG. WHO ELSE LOVES HARRY POTTER

Gryffindor by 31%.
Pure Slytherin!!!!
Hii everyone..
I'm ravenclaw cool I guess
Freaking GORGEOUS,
Raven claws anyone ??????
WHAT ABOUT THE POTTERMORE QUIZ?!
'
You should try the wavy trend!!
FULL FACE OF GLOW IN THE DARK MAKEUP?!
Her teeth 😐😭
...if Adalaide Byrd was there, she'd have given the fight to AJ Carter somehow...
dubois needs to step up in opposition for his opponents sake.
Fuck me, he went down quicker than Khan's missus on AJ.
giving a fuck about the person lying k.o'ed on the floor potentially seriously injured just means you're not a psychopath and not much else, just saying
Has some solid power but as always, knocking down weaker opposition doesnt really give me an idea of how he is going to be. Against menudo he was rocked in the first round, so I want to see him take some shots against live opposition before making a call. I wish him all the best though, seems like a nice lad and still got tonnes of time to develop.
is the Referee not fired yet?
This man here takeing alot people out aj Joshua will get it promise ye
Ref shoulda stopped it after the second knockdown - something horrible about refs letting fighters get knocked unconscious unnecessarily...
DB needs to be fighting in the mortal kombat tournament with liu kang and sub zero not fighting in a boxing ring
No disrespect to carter but I have seen a few of his fights and he's an awful fighter, DD is to stiff, going no were
Didn't realise that guy is British.
I understand they want to build up boxers confidence against weak opposition but why the fuck are they putting fights against factory workers and cab drivers on fucking telly
Beast! Will be champ one day for sure.
Uk boxers are on a lead
DD is gonna dominate in the future!! 👊🏻👏👏👏
Good lad. He looked genuinely worried about his opponent after the KO
118-110 in favour of Carter
happy bday aj
Well done for trending!
Newcomer.
BEAST !
Dangerous fight
Hearn won't be letting this guy anywhere near Joshua's dodgy chin.
he will destroy joshua.. :)
You do not belong in the U.K any longer
give the video a thumbs up!
This boy could genuinely give AJ some problems in a couple of years time! 🙂👍
This was my first ever boxing match, sat close to the ring, wasn't expecting to see someone pulverised within 60 seconds by a human tank
Let me guess, stepping up the hype against nobody's, if he's that good put him in with someone worthwhile.
Rumour has it that Dubious banged out Joshua in sparring
Alex why are you pranking your girlfriend
Lauren Skype call him her big Bear bear

I have a few friends who still don't buy Bruce's legendary status. This clip and the one of The Stones a few years back inviting him up for Tumbling Dice oughta silence them. The Stones, Sir Mick and Sir Paul don't just ask anybody on to their stage. Bruce has earned his way there. Brooooooooce.\nOh btw, love me some Paul. Still rocking and killing it and looking like a happy kid doing it!! The best.
Was an awesome show! So glad I was able to witness it in person! Paul, Bruce and Little Steven greatness!
Paul always -- ALWAYS -- sings significantly better when he has a friendly foe sharing the mic with him.
Hey by the way I love this video so much and I love paul mccartney! ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
Good to see Silvio Dante made it through the war with Brooklyn alright.
Holy shit. I would've lost my fucking mind if I was there.
The joy in Bruce's face to be back with a Beatle. Wonderful!
the only thing I don't like about this is that Springsteen is faking it on guitar - you'd think he would learn the song and play along - it's only 5 chords
The boss rocking a les paul like his ol' teenage self! Suits him well!
Seeing paul loving playing just as he did when he was young got me kinda choking up :')
Jim I need a copy of this show
ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!{BREAKING NEWS}\nHello guys, checkout some very very interesting information about Bruce Springsteen that everybody MUST know here http://bit.ly/2yg6zEZ
Boo!!
Best concert of my life! Thanks for posting!!!
I was there. Great videos Jim. Thank you.
I was in London 2012, the concert he mentioned, when they first sang this song together
Thanks God
É ÓTIMO COMO CANTOR. ABRAÇO.
Stevie!!!
Me too
why the crowd are humming?
Did I hear people booing??? Why on earth would they do that??????
Rolling Stone has posted your video FYI  https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-mccartney-springsteen-play-i-saw-her-standing-there-w503567
Thought he was dead.
Mccarthy is an old dog
Is the crowd booing?
why the crowd are humming?
Who is the lady singing? BBC can you list the back up singers name too in the description. Think they deserve that much. Thanks!
I love stormzy but he ruined this song. He destroyed a classic.
Taking it back to 1999
Hey, please check out some of the original songs I've written on my channel, and let me know what you think!
All the students ready to jump on his dick,he's sooo edgy,love him and his vibe and that thing he does,he's goat and all that other bollocks they do when hearing him
😫💖💖💖I fell in love again
Had this on repeat all weekend (y)
This has made my day. Song brings back so many good memories.
The singers are brilliant. His style of rap, maybe his accent just reminds me of googoogaga baby talk though...
Omg I loved the original when I was small!!!! This is so nice to listen to tho, very chill! Good job to everyone x
Reminds me of back home 💜💜
Stormzy = music for 14 year old white girls!
No talent at all, he just talks, that's it
Would be pretty great if it were not for Stormzy
george the poet much?
This sounds so good😍😍😍
How disgusting is Tulisa's cover compared to this
Stormzy should die already. He just ruined a classic.
This is shit.\nShe's good, but he's crap.
The more I listen to this, the more I love it
Is she singing for a bar of chocolate 🍫
I need the lyrics!!
Should get a release providing credit is given to the original artists too
Awful, backing singers were the stars.
'Every time I touch the mic they say BO!'
The singers are AMAZING 😍
Put it on itunes
This is a little bitty litty
Youngers don't even know this tune , but they gunna beg it now.
How's he find time for this with prepping for the champs league at the same time

If you read back what you just said it is jibberish. Are you just a man that can rhyme dot with tot?
Such a great cover. The vocalist is called vula and shes a uk legend. Does vocals for everyone and collabed with basment jaxx back in the day.
Yea gotta admit that was levels !!! Espesh that las on the Vocals
Can't understand a word Emile Heskey is saying.
I love this too much🙌🏾😭
*this is a nice version of stormzy*
Stormzy the best thing to come out of the UK in a long time
He's talented as hell.Shit.

Middlesbrough fan but what a block by qpr on the goal line
3rd goal was off
QPR two very lucky goals Boro made hard work of it UTB
After it was 2-2 I new Middlesbrough would score a third cause it's QPR and we also through it away.
We still didn't deserve to win. Our second goal was very scrappy
That ref and linesman are a joke,that was obviously over the line
Go on furlong lad 👏
UTB
WHAT THE FUCK LINO
Deserved at least a point.
The ball was out of play for their 3rd goal?!

to make your cats stop pooping on the sofa, get another cat litter box. Cats usually prefer their own litter box and if they are pooping on your sofa, they're letting you know.\n1

For all you you negative fake fans, fuck off!!!! In Klopp i trust and future looks good. KEEP THE SPIRIT HIGH. YNWA SWEDEN
Calm the fuck down you bunch of infantile imbeciles. Klopp's got at least 5 more years to build a team. We haven't got money on the scale of you-know-whos nor the type of manager who needs endless amounts of cash to buy, sell and buy again, top quality players. Klopp will bring us success in his own way and time. Have some patience and take it on the chin. I know some of you crave bragging rights cause your mate's are laughing at you and your shit team. Man up ffs!
klopp is a world class manager ...to any fan commenting otherwize you're not a real fan ...if you can't support us when we draw or loose then you're not a true fan ...!!
be angry all you want but atleast find a good enough reason to be. People slating the defence: apart from the defensive error the defense delt brilliantly with all that Burnley offered, robbos positioning was exceptional.\nPeople slating the attack: You have the right to criticize the forwards for not linking up as well as they could have but ultimately we did make enough chances and apart from the final pass we looked to break them down. Keep in mind that this lot kept out Chelsea and spurs as well, but every draw or negative result is takn in a generalised manner by Liverpool fans.\nWe had a plan, they had a plan, they executed theirs better than we did ours, but we also got unlucky. I take positives from the fact we have the elememnts now with coutinho playing deep to open up smaller teams, ultimately when this particular lineup of players gels together I can see us doing bits. We've already seen our counter attacking lineup, with gini can and hendo tear it up.
Wow, i didn't know how toxic the liverpool fan base is! You're not real fans, please accept, klopp deserves better than you people.

Win/lose/draw...players get paid the same wage, dock em and you'll see improvements and the chaff will be separated and sold for peanuts to Arsenal
Remember when we had Coates Enrique Borini and Lambert?😭 it's not crisis mode yet stick together
Should have signed a CB
I was a Liverpool fan before most of the people in this comment section were born. But you know what, I agree with them. Klopp is a moron, he's blinded by his own ego and never admits to any of his mistakes. Also, he's stubborn, the reason we dont have any new center backs is because it's an admission of fault from his part if he buys one. Remember, all last season he said we have a great defence and that we don't need new players. So he does't want to go back on his statement. That's how stubborn and dumb he is. This team won't win anything, mark my words. I hope Klopp gets fired before the January window, so we can get a proper defence in place.
Man Im starting to get sick and tired of these so-called fans posting their bullshit online, the LFC Facebook page is full of fucking idiots trashing the team and now this comment section is getting worse, if you are a Liverpool fan then get behind the team, if not then fuck off. #COYR #YNWA #LIVERPOOLFOREVER
We drew a game against a team that have had results against Chelsea and Spurs. I didn't go the game but I listened to it and watched extended highlights. It very much looked/sounded like we battered them. I'm a little bit bored of the goalkeeper/defence debate. They're all good players, they don't get any protection from the midfield, as the midfield are intent on marauding forward. It will get tweaked and we will put together a decent run of results. All the haters need to 'calm down'.
5-0 drubbing from city, 1-1 against Burnley at Anfield..\n\nPeople are upset because early on, we haven't seen any improvement from last season (so far) people are angry, and no one has a right to say that you can't get angry as a fan, it's like saying you can't be a human being and support Liverpool. Shut the fuck up. \n\nME personally, I trust in Klopp, and he is getting a rude lesson in the premier league at the moment, and it's in these times managers learn, and become better. \n\nI'm patient, but don't say to someone they're not a fan because they're pissed off, not everyone is going to rationalise things in the same way. We go again.
Mashraf Brownie well said buddy...Klopp was the best thing that has happened to this club in years...now you want him gone😂😂😂 you fuck tards😭 HE HAS MY BACKING, HES MY MANAGER YOU FUCKERS
Actually ,this time we didn't draw because of the defence.We lost point today because we missed too many easy chances
Football is for nerds.\n\nPlay League of Legends scrubs
Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. Fans are so emotional and fickle. two weeks ago after the arsenal game everyone was on top of the world. now, two draws and a loss and it's like we need to support the team in times like these comments. yes, our defense is shit but it's early days. A couple wins and we are back in the race and it's group stage in the CL, all with 1 pt. everyone fukn relax.
Get the results & talk less, Old Bob just get the results to do his talking!!!!!

I agree the defence is shocking and we need to sort it out. But we don't need to sack him, give him some time. I understand he has been manager for a while now but let's not be a Chelsea or man city. Let the manager do his job. If we sack him,  who do we get in?. There is nobody so let's get behind the team.
Wait until we get Keita we will never concede. \n\nKlopp is doing the right Thing, fair enough we didn't get a cb in the window but what u gotta remember: \nMane: Sent off\nLallana: Injured\nClyne: Injured\nThat's 3 of our main starters out and yes we did basically have our main team out but lovren wasn't in it, and the three people I mentioned I believe could change the team easily. And for all the fake fans who are complaining are not true fans. Like if ur a true fan. #YNWA
Fraud get out of our club #ynwa
Klopp is a one trick pony and never seems to learn from his mistakesThis defence are leauge of lreland standard,,,,,no offence to leauge of lreland
has he won a trophy at Liverpool yet?
Excuses galore. There is always   if ,but , only . JK is a great guy but not a great manager. We now sit 5 points off the top and the season as really only just started. I fear the winter as we get injuries, suspensions and involved in more and more competitions. Until we can go to places like Watford and win 6   0 then we will always be average . If we do not buy at least 4/5 decent players inc a goalkeeper then we will be out of all competitions by March . I have no doubt we will field a weak team in Jan for the FA cup and JK only aim will be fourth place for UCL again. Which to me is pointless if you are never going to win it .
disgusting behaviour by the club should have sol phil and bou9ght a striket
Lmao Klopp put Liverpool back in the champions league and this the thanks he gets foh
we are going on a winless streak till manu game ifwepay like thid
he needs to make subs earlier
To all the Liverpool fans getting irritated about negative comments. This is what Arsenal fans go through every year from 2003.
All this klopp hate is ridiculous. Sure the defence is leaky there's no denying that. But he has assembled one of the best attacking squads in Europe. Period. People are too impatient. 2 seasons in charge and he's brought us to to Europa final and within the top 4. Rodgers had his one off season which brought us close to the English title and before him was the epic champions league title in 06. Rome wasn't built in a day and quite frankly even if we aren't a title contender this season we play one of the best football on our best day (which honestly aren't far between each other). I have faith in klopp and our squad and I have faith he will continue to build and assemble a title winning team. And a question to all the klopp haters: what manager are you guys praying for that is available to just come and suddenly win titles?  Klopp and the reds knows there's an army of faithful who will always walk with you #ynwa
Patience is the key for success. LFC fans please give time to this guy. Because in dortmund he had time and independent to take decisions and another main reason was at that time, no other club had so much money to buy ready made players. For eg see Burnley they are happy with one point also because they have no money and fully support their manager. They think whatever he do is good for Burnley. When they where religated he was the manager and now also he is the manager.we have to learn from Burnley,because this guy  is much better than plastic managers like jose and pep.
Always a lot of talks... bla bla bla... and after dramatic disaster with City there is a worse match against Burnley. All team puts effort to attack, to support Salah but they don't arrive much goals...and, on the other hand, defense is too much under pressure collapsing first or later!  SALAH left Chelsea and Chelsea started to win again.!  Klopp & Flopp a strong disaster.!😂😂😂😂😂
Aaaaargh! Tough pill to swallow, that. Wasteful again in front on goal. Feels like 2 points dropped. Disappointing. Although, that's not to say that Salah's goal was amazing! He was probably the best player on the pitch in red today. Again, he looked dangerous, and £34 million now looks like a steal. Solanke looked good when he came off. Phil Coutinho also looked dedicated. Defensive frailties again costing us, same old Liverpool! Let's try and be more ruthless next time. \nC'mon Liverpool! We go again against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday night in the League Cup. C'mon Redmen! #YNWA ⚽️🔴❤️
Klopp \n\nPro's\n\nExciting attacking football\nPotential to smack sides of all abilties\nMotivating\n\nCon's\n\nDefending transition, since the fullbacks get really high up the park as he attacks in numbers\nEgo and stubborn i.e. won't add an extra defender to defend a lead.
a lot of weekend/game day managers in here that think klopp doesn't have the defense sorted and think he's naive/arrogant to the quality of the back performances. hard to think you can't comprehend that he probably wanted to buy specific defenders, and had x,y,z plans and adjustments for defense. the reality of the deals not being closed in the window (not in his control) means he has no choice but to show positive reenforcement in the belief and work rate of the players he has to work with. on the pitch for game day or in the training grounds and at the end of the day—it's always the players, not the manager. if he doesn't (in the public eye) show that he at least believes in the system and their ability to play in it—then the players wouldn't give any shit either.
Fucking idiot turning into Wenger! Play Gomes centre back! play two defensive midfielders or even play 5 at the ffs 😂 find a fucking solution! Dropping and replacing klavan and lovren with each other is a fucking waste
No leadership on the pitch anyone can see that . God I miss hencoz hyypia partnership

Win lose or draw it's Liverpool forever. We are going trough a bad patch now but it will get better all clubs do at some point in the season it's better for us to get it over with early. We will get new players in January and finish the season strong. Jurgen knows what he is doing we just have to have faith in him and give more time. He is the best manager we have had in a long time.
When ur winning ur happiest fans in england but soon as u lose or draw u never stop fucking moaning stfu u shit fans UTC🔴🔵🔴🔵
Disappointed with all the negative comments.. we have to keep encouraging and supporting him and the team no matter what! #YNWA
Flopp is changing the team so often he is destroying the team not building it. Players have bad moral. Not to mention lack of tactic, players are running like zombies with no apparent plan. he is wearing them down. He plays players out of position, does not use ones he has, delays changes, did I say he does not study the different teams we play. He probably tell the players come on boyz go there do your thing, and thats the plan de jour and every jour
I hate what we are right now and I won't excuse anything, that being said I won't stop supporting both manager and players. If you think different then you should check your self\nKlopp is a world class manager who has access to world class coaches, our owners seem a bit tight in terms of net spend but we have improved. I am not satisfied, I complain but I do not wish Klopp out as that would be stupid.
The best manager in the world!!! Our klopp!!
Everybody saying we need a new center back but IMO we also need a proper defensive mid too, even if we buy a good defender we will still make the same mistakes.
Strap in. Could be a long road. \n\nAn Arsenal sympathiser.
Created enough chances? We had 2-3 real good ones, one of them leading to the goal. That's pathetic if you have 150% ball possession. Klopp needs to take a cold shower.
Stick together still early days
This guy never has any fucking answers for anything on or off the pitch. What a pathetic excuse for a manager.
Im a Liverpool fan but this is so true:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttack wins you games,defence wins you titles.   Btw im not Klopp out.Im defence out new defence in (especially cb's)
theirs only 2 reasons we didnt improve the defence Klopp or the owners.We had a supposed £2000million to spend ,and we spent at the most £50 million at the least £30million after selling players.Something is definitely wrong .Why will no one ask him directly why we didnt improve the defence ,its a joke to every other team and their supporters.I feel embarrassed
If liverpool defenders were more confident in the air  challenge better and were tighter at the back we would not concede as many goals.
All WHO says klopp out Are fake fans
First time i am a doubting this man, its the same old shite. This season was supposed to be different, in reality very much the same. Obviously is a brilliant manager, but teams have figured us out and he has no answer to this. I can only hope he will soon.
Solanke  must start next match ,he's more proactive in attack than Than Firmino.
If you are #KloppOut then you're simply plastic and deluded.
I’m sorry the back 4 is apauling I don’t know what to say. It’s bs, Why don’t we put Moreno LW?? Everyone moans about him playing to high when he’s in LB why don’t we try him LW whilst Mane is out, push firmino back to his no. 9 role. It’s hopeless,  Klopp said ‘there was no CenterBacks on offer’ De Virj from Lazio, Koulibaly, anyone but Klavan and Lovren. I feel sorry for Matip for what he has to play with. Come on guys it’s not hard. If u take in the fans opinions and ideas maybe just maybe we might do something. Ideally I don’t wanna see Klopp go But I DO wanna see changes. It’s BS!!! COYR // YNWA
so many negative comments and klopp out screamers. i understand that but people are angry about those point losses over and over but i also think you need to realize that liverpool haven't been an elite team for many years now. yes they need to address defense but its easier said than done. the marked for middle inns is such small and once anyone on high skill level hits the market you compete with lots of top clubs. even city had huge probs to find defenders. and what i want to add cause of all this negativity after the sevilla game - just please don't forget that pool hasn't been real madrid the past 2 years. sevilla won the euro league 3 times in a row. spanish top team since years. and liverpool dominated and could have lead 4-1 at half. plenty of things to improve but its not all that dark
With or without Coutinho LiverJail is still disappointing!\nThey should let him go! Karma is punishing Klop!
As a LFC Fans, I'm extremely disappointed and also very angry seeing this team playing dirty football. Sturridge was not good at all today and he was still on the pitch. Solanke is better and he never plays always on this bloody bench. klopp always use the same plays so it doesn't shock me if small team is beating us. Spending lots of money on good player and they don't even play. Nowadays I'm asking myself if klopp is a great manager or not. In every we can see the same mistake everywhere. \nSubstitution after 75' of play, even if the team is loosing. in 15', the game can't change with only one fresh player. \nKlopp so disappointing to have as LFC manager
I am a diehard Liverpool fan and I have always supported Klopp but to be honest Klopp is stubborn and it costing us a lot. I wonder why he wants so much forwards and midfielders without sorting out the defense, it's not like he didn't know about it all along. I never thought I would be saying this but I don't think Klopp is good enof for Liverpool
After 15mins you could predict how the game is going to end, Klopp is an excellent manager so is Sean Dyche for getting a point out of this game, well done to him, however the focus must be on how Klopp fields his team, in my opinion he should have started the game with solkane and ox, you could see firmino and salah was looking tired. Klopp will win games with this side Gk- Ward , LB -Robertson, CB -Matip, CB Gomez, RB -Alexander, MF -Couthino, Henderson, GIGI, FW- Mane, Daniel, Salah. Subs - Simon, Lovren, Firmino, ox, solanke. Comment your best xi LFC Fans.
Time is ticking now on this manager, his choices in the transfer windows are turning out to be woeful. Any defensive coaches work at Melwood?
Disappointed but we need to keep going and believe in Klopp. thought we were could have been more clinical and credit to Burnley they were very disciplined. YNWA
Wtf was that!?I'm sick of this shit.Klopp with a hard heart I'm telling you man...you are wasteing everybody's time.The bad news is that you could do more but you are like all germans...stubborn,in everything good or bad.After 2 years you only have 4 players Mane Matip Salah and Wijnaldum and Milner mostly on the bench so doesn't count.Taday was bad luck but we could easyly lose.Poor plan for first 11,no plan B and nothing  good in the future only a 6th place maybe.
These Klopp out comments aren't Liverpool fans. You see the same exact guys on other videos declaring themselves as Manc fans. Don't fall for it, jeez.
rome wasn't built in a day. he inherited lovern, Henderson and  Firminio what do you expect lol\n\nbe patient
Fuck you kloop we are sick an tired off your fucking hope  gooooooooooo
I haven't been critical of Klopp but I have been noticing he is not really good at game management. The times at which he makes substitutions always baffles me. I think he is too much of a patient person overall. The substitutions are sometimes too late in the game to have an impact and why the hell didn't OX start out wide over Firmino he needs rest anyways smh
Be patient , good game judge him after this month
trent can't cross klavan can't head pass nor has the confidence to drive the ball and force the issue everyone was way to stagnant and standing around at times all that being said this is my elf cup XI ward trent klavan lovren moreno- gini hendo ox-solanke coutinho firminho coutinho needs to play more forward until mane comes back
lets see what excuses KLOOP comes up with this time
Why, just why klopp disappointed on you,  stop moaning like mou we hit the post, we dominated, what fucking matters is the result and you here still not addressing defense issue and don't forget that simple mistake you made will cost you your job,  the defence will cost you losing your job
Will lfc win a trophy this season ?????   Answer = NO --- fact.
I don't know how can you enter the season with klavan, matib, Milner, moreno, lovren, the rest are trash. Does he really thought he's gonna win the league with this trash ass niggas come on man I can see you built the midfield and the front line well done on that but you are not interested in defenders. You need to steal some mourinho tactics. If this midgets on the front line face those tall and strong guys from Manchester believe me this guy is talking about improvements on nothing.
How can you put Klavan after all his bloopers in defense? Klopp are you blind? Stupid? Or corrupt may be players pay you bribe for gaming time?????????
klaven is useles and lovren in defence. kloop needs to put gomez in in central defence
I love Liverpool and support them even when we played shit. But I cannot forgive Klopp for 2 main reasons: \n1) Renewing and extending contracts of our most vulnerable players and those who are not consistent let alone 'world class'. Who are those players? Simon Mingolet and Dejan Lovren got contract extensions during Klopp..baffles me to why it was done.\n2) He had 4 transfer windows..okay let's just say 2 windows  (summer windows) and he did NOT fix the part we were most lacking in..i.e Goalkeeper and Centre Back. We infact sold one CB..the jury is out if Sakho should have returned or not. Fact is we have not improved defensively when it was so obvious. \nAttacking we are v good. No doubt. But you cannot win leagues with leaky defences. Period. He's got till January to fix this in the window or I'm totally going Anti Klopp.
Remember  spurs only managed a draw today. I bet we beat Leicester  next week .
Looserpool
no mane no party
Lol Liverpool r sponsored by new balance... Fitting!
Love his wig.
Fuck Klavan
Fancy doing a swapsy for Koeman ?
DID WE MISS SADIO MANE TODAY?
Banners fsg out klopp out will fly soon
Its your wrong doing\nNot signing defenders and DM. 18 months in and defence is worse. The issue against orgnized teams, do you go and buy a strong striker who can finish and bully defenders? No yiu waste 40 on ox the overrated Ibe\n\nCharisma buy you time. Fans like you, but same stupid mistakes for 18 months! Tick tock Mr deluded one
To all the people who don't understand how the transfer market panned out , \nKlopp didn't buy an CB because FSG put out a statement without the knowledge of klopp which inhibited klopp to go for his top target . \nNow sure we can bitch and moan we didn't get a plan B, but that plan B ain't giving us a chance to win a title so we've waited 20+ years already , instead of putting all that baggage unfairly on klopp with half a squad that isn't his players, maybe it's worth waiting an extra couple years and for once get top targets instead of settling for plan b ... social media has just given license to too many people who's impatience would've seen shankley sacked in this era... shame
I can name 500 defenders better than fuckin Klavan. Utter utter dogshit!!🐕💩If Klopp can not see what everyone else sees at Anfield today then he's a cunt. His fault for not strengthening at Centre half end of.
Klopp is very frustrating! I am starting to hate him because he is making my Liverpool FC a dumbass club.
HOW CAN LIVERPOOL FANS SUDDENLY TURN THEIR BACK ON THIS GUY ITS ONLY BEEN 5 GAMES REMEMBER BURNLEY BEAT CHELSEA, DREW TOTTENHAM .....STOP BEING PLASTIC FANS OTHERWISE IF KLOPP GOES IT WILL BE FURTHER DISASTER FOR YOU PEOPLE NO BETTER COACH IS AVAILAIBLE
Keita. Mane. Salah. Let the man build a team. Unless you want to sign another Welsh pirlo.
ASK KLOPP THIS:\n\nJurgen, your title rivals beat you 5 - 0 and then you draw both your next games, one of them to so called inferior opposition...who will Liverpool beat next?\n\nThe world has no clue who we will beat and who we wont beat, can you give us a clue whats going on?
Time 4 him 2 go
Gk- Mignolet\nRb- Clyne\nCb- Matip\nCb- Gomez\nLb- Robertson\nDm- Can\nCm- Lallana\nCm- Coutinho\nRf- Salah\nLf- Mane\nCf- Firmino\n\nPlay this team and we'll win! Just need our injured players back 😢
Freecoutinho
We are in Champion's League.  We have a team that has a chance to do something good.  Klopp is building a good team. He made a mistake not to get a good defender but we need to keep supporting.
God I wish I could drop kick this chick into a metal chair.
Can you make a candle cake plz and thanks Happy Falls Day😊
I think that nerdy nummies is just getting boring. She only uses things from her baking line she hasn't been the same I don't get exited anymore when I see a new video I'm just like it probably going to be the same as always if RO could see this then I'm not trying to be mean but I'm jus trying to give a heads up.

Ro, I used to really like your channel but I'm sadly unsubscribing. It feels like the last many videos were focussed on your own product, and this is not what I want in a video. I came to the channel because I liked your nerdy, crazy treats, not to be sold to.

Hey sorry to be annoying but I just started my YouTube channel and if you could spare a little time to watch my first video about Game Of Thrones that would be great! \nVideo : https://youtu.be/kgIKYSAvlUA
now....hold on a sec... did i hear it right? even the dragons were burned? i thought Dany said fire cannot kill a dragon?
Am i the only one who wished that Peter Dinklage narrated this?  A few commentaries had his sass in the voice lol
These comments make me want to sell crack to orphans.
Is the doom of Valyria a mirror of pompeii?
Is that Harry Lloyd reading?
I got lost into this world and video so deeply it didn't feel like a 4 min video, more like 2. This was so good.
And this is why I love the Targaryens 💯
Is the narrator the guy who plays Viserys? It just really sounds like him.
So it's the rise and fall of the Roman Empire withe DRAGONS??? COOL!!!
Reminds me of the story of Atlantis.
Can't wait to watch the rest of these on some obscure youtube channel!
It took my awhile to realise this is Viserys's voice. Damn
They could honestly make seven more seasons of prequels to the GoT stories exploring the rich history of the world that GRRM has built.
That dragon model seemed oddly similar to skyrims dragons
Well... That's look pretty ugly and not so fine about history. That pilot made by a fan was way better to be honest:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFDOdhVAJg
Ruled by great families who didn't know what greatness was, Aegon would teach them
Is this a hint of an Aegon's Conquest/Old Valyria prequel? :o
Is that Viserys i hear???
This was actually better than the first episode of season 7!
Make money very easy only wactch video\nhttp://kibuilder.com/2lBf
Why isnt this the opening to a game
And that's why ladies and gentlemen, I fucking love game of thrones
what a tease! loved it though
Who the hell narrates this? It doesn't quite sound like Viserys, is it Rhaegar?
Just realised the guy telling the story is Rhaegar  ... damn
It was the casterlys who hold the westerlands when aegon came to westeros and aegon burned the casterlys and gardeners and 10000 men whos swords make the iron throne
Thank you for this. I am a big fan of the show.
This is nice. I would say, though, that there's a slight detail with the information: the Targaryens didn't build Dragonstone, it was already there, as the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold.
Dis is all mind blowing, u guys should pls make a game from this, or something, a game where winter comes every December, and we can choose our houses, cos dere is only one season left and I don't want to ever forget u guys, just like everyone forgot abt Lord of the rings, and pls not a telltale game pls
I really hope with all my heart that its a sign of a spin off
House Arryn held the Vale. Or Rather the Vale held them. His voice tho' <3

hi fellow GOT Fans. im asking for your help by viewing this 17sec video. thank you very much \nvalar morghulis \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=share&v=Zi0mWmqByNk
This bodes well for The Doom being the subject of HBO's next series.
Hint to a spin off?
Viserys reading bedtime stories to his sister
Now i know a lot more History in Got than in Real Life lol
I wish that Game Of Thrones was 3d animated series that would be awesome.
I feel like a child wanting to hear more of that bed time story
At this point it really shouldn't be that hard for them to know what we want from this channel. The latest Rep the Realm video has 1000 likes and 4000 dislikes. This video has 50000 likes and fewer than 500 dislikes.
Am I the only one who preferred the animated histories and lore when they were hand-drawn? This move to lazy, cheap 3D animation is an awful trend.\n\nI DO however still love these, and its nice that they keep bringing back relevant characters and their actors to voice them.
The next series after a song of ice and fire
I liked the 2-D parts, but the 3-D ones just looked awkward.
Thank you for filling the void in our hearts that will be the next 2 years. Hope you guys will release more content until season 8. We scrape for the smallest scraps, that is Game of Thrones crack!
Can we get Robert's Rebellion:The Animated Series?
Why haven't they made a GOT video game?
I can't wait to see the next part..😦😧😱😱
Just give me season 8 i beg ;-;
When is the next video coming.......

There was a crown on the collar of the Stag in Baratheon sigil which was added after the Rebellion against Targaryens when Robert took the throne. An ironic mistake for this video
looks like Heroes of might and magic intro. WTF???
Yo, I was ready for an hour of this.
Which family held the Riverland
I guess this means there'd be no Game of Thrones: Origins
Damn, that was good. More, please.
Dragonstone was already a castle before the tararyens fled. They didn't just run to an abandoned island
who the hell dislikes this stuff
we need more of these with that 2 year wait until next season
Wonder why they're making these? *hint those three series that HBO is setting in the Ice and Fire universe that may or may not require a bit more backstory to completely understand*
Aegon fucked he's aunt.... The other Aegon
They would have done it with Jony Ive.
Is it just me or did he just  insult both of his wife's house and most of the 7 Kingdoms
GIVE. ME. MORE..\nPLEASE

WHO IS THE NARRATOR?!
Is the voice over done by viscerys?? Sounds just like him
Why does it have to be SO EXPENSIVE 😭😭
The prices are rediculous
Please have my baby
I would love to see a video about Fenty Beauty.
I think I'm going to grab the mascara. I am such a fan of any mascara that grabs all my lashes. In not sure of any of the other products. Thank you for being honest😘
I'd love to see a Clarins makeup tutorial!
I'd love to see a video using Tarte products! I try to use natural makeup brands when I can, and I think Tarte does that really well.

I can't deny that the packaging is beautiful, but the size of those eye shadows?  that's ridiculous.  They could have been a bit bigger to at least fill the compact.  I'm going to pass.  Although that eye foil looks great.  It looks like you're doing the glossy eye trend without the gloss.
Love Victoria Beckham's clothes, I was looking forward to seeing reviews on the cosmetics. Glad I waited because I am surprisingly not going to buy some of the items I originally had on my list! Love the Modern Mercury (I have the original one STILL), love the setting powder, and love the mascara! Thanks for the great review. Can't wait for the next ones!
Please bring the new blue brushes and the multi tech ones in Douglas stores in Germany...excited looking forward to get them from Douglas.de online Shop 🌸💕😘
that look is pretty
Could you try bare minerals please ❤️
So beautiful. I am in love with a lot of her make up. Wish I could treat myself. Will try to if I can get hold of some. Xx
Where are your earrings from?
Forever love your videos! Would LOVE to see you feature; NARS & Hourglass Xx
Thanks for the video, would love to see you do a Laura Geller video please :-) x
For the one brand tutorial I would like to see a Natasha Denona one too if you can Nic 😘
No 7 video would be nice
Could you do a brand review on Hourglass? And Laura Mercier? Xx
Hi Nic and Sam! Would you consider doing a Fenty review? I'd love to hear your take on it.
Wow, wow wow. The make-up your face and technical skills show the VB collection off to perfection. Thank you ❤️
I'd love for you to do a No7 Makeup tutorial/review! I don't see those very often and I think there are some decent thing within the brand for less bank breaking prices.
Lovely review, have you stopped using your lilash serum? Could you do update review on it x
It sounds weird but I love that greasy eyelid look. Do these transfer during the day?
Really love this type of video-very informative and helpful. Thanks Nic, brilliant job 😊
Loved the reviewtorial thought the end result was very much a Brooke Shields look. They do look like very luxurious products and you can see the quality in your results. Thanks for sharing
Could you do some more affordable brands like collection or maybelline x
Is flower beauty widely available there? It would be nice to see a brand review of that brand. Thanks! Still loved the end look even if you just wanted to try the products. :) great as usual.
Is this only colour of foil in the collection? Gorgeous makeup as always xx
If you can do Dior that would be great!! Thank you! Love love love your videos.
What show was she on. I recognise her just not sure what she was from??? X
You did a great job nic!
Could you try the new too faced kandee collection? \nWould be good to see an actual make up artist use it rather than just youtubers who dont have the same level of knowledge or experience xxx
Gorgeous!  I'd like to see beauty pie or kat von.d x
Nic, I think it would be hilarious to see you and Sam do a full face using homemade products based on jail makeup.  I love the vids where you guys  work together on a silly task like the waterproof mascara challenge you did.  \n\nI'm also dying to see you and Sam do looks from American Horror Story, especially Lady Gage's looks in the Hotel season.\n\nJust some ideas! Love to you all!!
Love the make up tutorial. Can you please do a review on Fenty beauty? I would an honest review. Thaaaanks x
besides makeup, you girl have a lovely nail color, i love it, show it often
Can you do a fenty makeup review
Yes Fenty beauty please!! OMG VB products are expensive!! She may be pricing herself out of the market! Pass
62 pounds for translucent powder?! Which you are probably paying for the name instead of the quality, you would probably find the same if not better quality product at a drug store.
Will the real techniques powder bleu brushes come to ulta?
That lip liner color looks fucking good on you.
Dolce & Gabanna, please. Those are only available online and I'd like to see them tried out before I go and purchase them. Thank you!
You're so adorable!!! I love your makeup tutorials!!
please do a few looks with Natasha denona Lila palette! if you and your sister each did a look together from one palette, it would be like two looks in one video! genius! esp since you're both so talented and not just for ND but any brand and palette, that would be a cool video to see from you two
I really enjoy your videos....Could you review makeup revolution... thanks
Shit shit shit I really am trying to curb my spending on makeup. This doesn't help.
I recently bought some makeup from W7, I'd love to see you do a review of them! It's insanely affordable. Their Glowcomotion highlighter/eyeshadow is gorgeous. I also got their matte eyeshadow palette and all the shades are very wearable.
I would like to see the normal Estée Lauder range, especially the Double Wear Foundations and their differences!
Lovely video. Super informative and honest opinions. Look forward to more of this style of video. X
There's not a product that you used that doesn't look wonderful & flattering on you! I was wondering though, what color/brand did you use on your hair? I really like it
As much as I like Estée Lauder products I just can't get on board with this it's like taking out a bank loan to buy a bronzer, products look gorgeous on you though nic!
When is the defining crease brush out? Only shade set in the brushes info ☹️
Baby hairs- put hairspray on a toothbrush and comb through! :)
Will you please do an Avon makeup review! Thank you :)
Hello can you feature hourglass & Laura mercier. I love watching your videos ☺️
Stunning as always but the makeup looked a bit doll like for me...maybe it was the skin. I know a lot of people love the perfect look but I love to see your amazing skin a little more natural xx
I'd like to see Jouer!
Tooth brush and spray it with hair spray
I would like to see some older brands which aren't so mainstream but have stood the test of time! Elizabeth Arden, Guerlain, Givenchy! Don't tend so see these products in videos!
Once upon a time Victoria Beckham was putting her name to cheese and onion crisps. Now look at her collabs.. those prices!
Your skin is to die for!
To help with the whispy hairs: use hair gel on a toothbrush (of course a new one you only use for this purpose) and whisk them back. Stays in place all day.
How much is the foundation primer (Victoria Beckham) x
Why do you consider yourself lucky to interview VB?She is launching an exceedingly expensive makeup line. It's not as if she had you for tea.
Can you do a review of Anastasia Beverly Hills products ?
You should sell your brushes individually because there are Real Techniques brushes that I want to buy but don't get because they only come in sets that have brushes I'm not interested in. I'm not going to pay for an entire set when I only want one or two brushes. Just a thought!
Review Chanel Makeup. I havent heard a lot from Chanel makeup products on youtube.
Please do a review on fenty beauty...
your skin is sooooooooooooooooo amazing!!! would you make a video telling us your skin care journey, PLEASEEE
Please could you or Sam do a Fenty Beauty video? :-*
I know it not fashionable but I would love to see a MAC review from their permanent line. You usually only see the LE collections.
I can still hear this creeking/grinding noise in the videos! What is this???
The foundation blends perfectly in with your skin tone! It looks gorgeous! <3
So beautiful

Wrong celebrity love
...why do these celebrities think they are so above reasonable pricing?! absurd!!! please don't pay this for products when equally good or better products exist for less!! great review, nic and the look you created is stunning, as always....thanks for your down to earth honesty xoxo
Hi Nic....i Love ur Videos but these reviews would be even better when u could do a weartest and show how the Products lasted on  ur  face after  6-12 hours. Much love from Germany
I feel bad thinking this but I really wonder how you would've felt about these products had you not known they were vb?\nI've watched this channel for years and I respect you both a ton and such is the reason why I don't want to doubt you.
Loved your video as always. Quick observation, your camera always makes weird noises ha! Wonder why!
Ok the chances of all being blond, which is 12.5% isn't even that slim. You know that it's possible that all of them can be blond. I have a cousin that is blond but her mom and dad have brown hair.
This is just a show the little kids are just actors .  they don't actually find kids that have brown hair just to look like
It's a fucking show I can't believe someone would read that much into it
Marketing and advertising Offer: Free of charge Apple iPhone. Get a new apple iphone every year. To register and get a Free of cost iphone go to google and type: *givefonesaway*
it's a sitcom, i doubt they put that much thought into it. all these weird ass theories are reaching.
Lmao I want this to be true so bad
What a load of crap, it's only a tv show
My mom has dark brown hair and my dad has black hair and all through my childhood I was bleach blonde and then my hair eventually darkened to a dark brown
You do realize that it's not 50% chance, thats not  how genes work bruh this is basic shit a middle schooler knows better
so joey banged danny’s dead wife 3 separate times with several years passing between each occasion? ok.
Dude... Its a hair color mine doesn't match either one of my parents nor does my siblings. Its a show nobody really slept with anyone sounds like youre paranoid
*THESE COMMENTS ARE KILLING ME!😂*
The people watching this who don't know what Full House is, don't give  two shits. The people, like me, who used to watch this show is thinking that this video is retarded as fuck.
Makes sense to me...
Here the thing it's a show.
Will someone Please send me 1 dollar to my paypal I really need it. Thank you! ashleeowl2011@gmail.com
That's some games of thrones shit hahaha i lost my mind
It's so obvious that Joey fucked both of their wives,😂
What the fuck? I'll believe those aren't Danny's kids, but Jesse's?!? No way man.
This is not very well thought out... First of all obviously Joey ISNT the father of the actors. Yes it is strange that all of the children had blonde hair but at the same time they were children when they were casted, and hair can change when they age, for instance i was born with red hair but it changed to blonde then auburn and then a dark more brown auburn, my mom has auburn hair that was more red and my dad has black brown hair, which made it darker then my moms but with red undertones still.\n\n DJ was more of a dirty blonde which could be due to their mothers AND the fact that Dannys mom was i believe is a blonde as well, which makes his brown a bit less dominant. Dannys children being blonde is not illogical because his hair may have been more blonde during early childhood. As far as Uncle Jesse's children, the mother was blonde, and Jesse's sister was blonde, which means he carries the genetic trait. I dont know about you but you need the other genes from ancestors to come to that conclusion as definite.\n Also isn't it more weird to think they'd both cheat on a talkshow host(Danny) and a band member(Jesse) for Joey the cartoony comedian. Plus the fact that they got blonde haired actors on purpose to make it harder to forget their mother and so they each had a part of her, to torment Danny and Jesse, by having a constant reminder of her. If you want to discuss a theory at least think it out first.
or MAYBE ITS A FUDGEING SITCOM!
My dad has dark hair, my mom has light hair, and my 2 brothers and I all have blonde hair...
So what... I'm white... My wife is white... And all 5 of my kids are black.  It's called recessive genes people!
But a lot of people have blond hair when their born and then it becomes darker, I was super blonde until I was like 13 when it became a brown
The irl Ballinger Family Chris has almost black hair and his wife is brunette-ish yet all their kids are very blonde. There, theory dispelled.
I flipped a coin three times and got tails. That is also a 50/50 chance. Theory debunked
all your base are belong to us
He can't fuck you like I can
Literally hair. That's 90% of the theory
OBJECTION! Danny's mother, who appears multiple times on the show including the first episode, is shown to be blonde. Thus, according to my 9th grade biology class, makes it so there is a higher chance of the girls having blonde hair as he carries the recessive gene, as does Rebecca and Jesse as, if I remember correctly, Rebecca's mother is also blonde and as Pam is blonde then that means Jesse also holds the gene. Not to mention we find out Becky's expecting only seven episodes after the wedding episode with the wiki stating that the twins were born the day the episode they were born on aired which was 9 months and 2 weeks after the wedding episode aired. This evidence concludes that the twins could have been conceived during the honeymoon and were late or conceived after the honeymoon when Becky and Jesse lived in a different house for about a week. Meaning there was no possible time for when Joey could have slept with Becky. We must also take into account that DJ's kids, except the baby, all have dark hair. Plus, in episode 1 of season 4, Jesse's grandparents come to visit the also bring a young cousin named Melina who looks exactly like Michelle, as she was played by one of the twins but this is about genetics.Therefore this theory is hogwash. I rest my case and frankly spent far too much of my time debunking this theory.
I didn't watch the video but I assume its covering the theory that every member of the adult cast is a sexual predators at large.
but why would Joey keep having kids
Hey brothers I need ten followers to reach a thousand support me 👉🏻👈🏻 pass to my Channel
From now on if u have blonde hair u might just be Joey's kid... 😨
The modern obsession with the term cuck is getting a little out of hand.. \n\nY'all need to cut, it, out.
Blonde hair is recessive and brown dominant;  there is waaay less than a 12.5 percent chance of those being his kids lol
fan theory....for people who seem to forget\n that fictional tv...is fictional....
Also remember, Jesse wasn't just Danny's friend he was his brother-in-law and he has very dark hair(he was Greek). So even if Danny's wife was blond she wasn't likely a natural blond. So Score another one for Joey---✂️👈👍
Or maybe it's just a tv show and the people involved are actors.
Or they were just the best to be casted
its just a show its not going to be 100% accurate and 12% is a big chance its also saying that its not impossible😂
(Jim carry voice) So your saying theirs a chance... Come on man if all you have is hair color I'm not sold on Joey being a player... He rarely got laid on that show period so I doubt he could pull Mrs. Tanner.
How did this get twice as many veiws as the Jurassic Park theory lmao
Some people have no life
One problem with that is Joey had no game back then lol. He got a family in fuller house but let's be honest he was a borne line pedo bear.
It's a show it's already not real
Lol Seems Joey likes to share the love a little too much
Joey sounds like a savage
My mom and dad both have brown hair while my 2 siblings and I have blonde hair
Never watched full or fuller house \n\n\n\n\n*I'm just here to jerk it*
Thank YOU... How can Jesse be The Mothers Biological brother when He looks nothing like a Blond or caucasian?? Joey is Danny's Brother though so it is suspicious but the Blond Gene Must have Skipped Danny though. I Am kind of Mad I guest this theory before watching though.
this theory is stupid
my dad has brown hair. my mom has brown hair. \n\nmy brother and i have blonde hair and look like our dad.\n\nsorry. theory debunked
Its a fucken show,.get a life
Wow this shit had me laughing and to imagine how they would explain all that on the show lmfao!!!
Holy shit I didn't notice that
OMG JOEY A DAD THAT FUNNY UR SUCH A LIAR
Here's my.theory: there isn't some secret deeper meaning behind everything. It's a TV show; the characters that were picked via casting had different color hair than one of their fake parents that were also casted and the best person submitted to fill the role just happened to have different color hair than their fake children. Wow, call the press, the aluminati is real, bob the builder is shaped like a dick because Tom Cruise is an alien, everything is a flase flag and the government leaves clues everywhere so sheeple can find the truth, tupac isnt dead, Jay-z is a reptilian and the leader of the illuminati and HAARP opened up portals creating the Mandela Effect. Or you're all just over thinking mundane shit.
I wish that I had Jesse's girl
It's a show
I doubt the show looked up the percentage of having children with blonde hair with a dark haired father, I always thought that they were all girls so they wanted them to look like the mom
This is a TV show not real life
Im pretty sure they hired cute child actors and didnt go that deep? 😂
I will forever have a tainted view of them all now because of this.
I really shoulda just kept scrolling past this one :/
Boy there blonde hair is from there mama duhhh
Ok hear me out. Maybe, just maybe... the casting director overlooked one small detail.
I bet Kimee is his to!  😂

Hi.
My dog died struck by a car
As an Australian, I find this adorable. Thanks for making my day, mate. 😂
The Australia has too many spiders is because of a tree which is called a gumtree and some have a billion spiders
Aussies like me will Rule Vidcon one day
I’m sorry but I’m an Australian and no one I know speaks as Aussie as this or used these words 😂
I'm so happy you guys collabed
4 million subs! someone get Harry because this is *WACK*
I live Australia but in the north i think in Melbourne
I'm from Australia
James, try Vegemite with toast. Like, put bread in a toaster, and when the bread is still hot put butter on it. then put a TINY bit of vegemite on it, like... not everywhere.. vegemite here and there. It's honestly addicting.
I watched your videos for so long but I never got a chance to subscribe and I just want to say keep up the great work and keep on making people smile;)
WHAT THE HECK?!?\nI'm german and I have a budgerigar, but we call them budgie!!! ( not in german, that's just one of his nicknames. In german it's Wellensittich ( word-by-word-trans: wave-parakeet, because of their pattern ) )\nHave a nice day!
Racist shits can't be Aussie don't do it you insult your proud allie
I live in Australia and I wish we had twinkies!

i was watching this and i was all like\nwtf they dont have lamigtons or twisties in usa
As an Australian this is hysterical
Lel I'm Australian Its So Weird Watching This!
They sell tim tams in CA :)
My country is Australia's neighbor. Aka New Zealand. I have no idea what words he is saying. But stuff like the toilet having two buttons is true. And I did not know that America has only one. Huh
I over when you bloody yanks try and be aussie
Yep, we have a fuck load of slang.
I didn't expect a cross country toilet podcast for nearly half the video.
Pleaseeeeeeee do a vid on left handed struggles! Bc u left handed
I'm Australian and I'm learning just as much as James 😂
You live in Yuma Arizona. Am I Correct I've been to Arizona ten times and recognize houses. I live in California.
Welcome to Australia mate. (I never talk like this)
I'm Australian and I didn't understand most of those words.
I can get Tim's Tams at my Smith's/Fry's/Kroger I think Fry's in Az
*waiting for james to do the timtam slam*
4MILLL!!! You deserve it James
I have the same pencil
I love your videos but I want to do comics but I'm not that funny or smart. if you could help me a little bit so I can be like you-you are the best youtube better then pewdiepie.
I have an Australian toilet and I'm in America xD
When you work in a grocery store in Florida, and you sell tim-tams and vegemite. Had no idea the these were Australian, and that most of the country doesn't have them
Hey knew to the channel love your stuff
10:10 I saw the Vegemite and I was sorta like\n'James is gonna die'
Omg james thank you so much for responding to my email! I teared up and my boyfriend was listening to me
They have dual flushing toilets in america come on james!
Meet with Toonsquash or I won't wear my seatbelt.
I'm curious, what do Australians even sound like to the rest of the world? Because as an Australian, Jazza has no accent to me.
I wish my animations could have art like Jazzas' omfg
No one talks like that in Australia
In the getting recoganized video you said pen insie of pencil
You look exactly like the guy from Silicon Valley, the really sunburnt guy, second CEO guy who got eliminated from the cast
james jAmes JAmes JAMES *JAMES* *J A A M E S!!!*\n\n\n\n\nu hit 4m. nice.
James looks like scarce's little brother
Vegimite and marmite are death in a bottle... my parents are aussies and I'm a kiwi and none of us like em....
The odd ones out! Ur in the bottom pics for I funny
That man is a hottie
The lord of the rings is everywhere
Hope you don't get bitten or stung by stuff
4 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS, I STILL NOT USED TO IT OMG
The second drawing they did I knew what everything was in the sentence except Mackers. but as soon as I saw Jazza had drawn a McDonalds bag it suddenly made sense to me. Ahhhhhh they mean Maccas! Not Mackers! Ohhhhhh they mean McDonalds! This makes sooooooo much sense now! If your Australian you probobly know what I'm talking about.
If I was a vegetable I'd be a mushroom Cuz I'm a fun guy (fungi) Hahahahahahahahahaha \n\nMan I suck at joke telling
I will choose not to take offence from this video because this is 24 on trending.
JAMES, CONGRATS ONE HITTING 4 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!!! I LOVE YOU CHANNEL\n\n\n\nP.S. Wear your seatbelt
4mil James where's the SPRINKLES and the cake
NOTICE ME SENPAI
You kind of look like the old blaziken...
We have stubby holders, we just call 'em beercuzzis or cuzzis for short :P
i like how most of the animators are friends
Am I the only one who knew all the words and their meanings
Cheetos here in Australia by the way are little super-airy bacon and cheese flavoured balls, so I feel like that's what Jazza meant when trying to describe the Twisties!
Pls sub to my channel James
I'm a Ravenclaw, I don't like frozen either! I'd like 1950's/1960's fashion to return.
I don´t like fashion at the moment. I don´t even get excited about shopping anymore. I can´t seem to find anything I like when I go in a store. I really love classy and more elegant clothing, which is totally not practical when working with kids though
I know how you feel when I was pregnant I was wearing Jeggings and vest tops
I really like 90s fashion! Apart from crop tops, I don't see the point of them and who wants to walk around with their belly out?! Love the pink hair by the way!
The best thing I found in primark recently was. Floral Pom Pom throw and also bows like jo jo bows and also a cream hat with multi coloured Pom Pom on it and mojito lip balm and I want the Christmas baubble
I seem to be living out of shops like dotty p's and white stuff because they have less 90s stuff. I need things that don't make me look like a boob/stomach blob!!!
Being a curvy girl, I can not STAND the nineties fashion at the moment. It would seem if you have boobs and a bum there isn't a lot of choice. Maybe I am not looking hard enough, but I do think the nineties clothes should stay in the nineties! P.S I love you.
Hufflepuff all the way <3 So proud to be a Hufflepuff tbh.. I kinda love the fashion of the mo actually. loving the mom jeans vibe and crop tops and such. I do really need to get my get my tummy a bit more into shape to feel 100% confident in them again in summer. I think I actually own more crop tops than regular tops..... love you so much!
I got so excited for the Disney things and the Harry Potter things that I nearly threw up, amazing video. Love it!!!
Slytherin is in the comment!!!!
I like your hair but I think you should not dye your hair when your preggo
Love your hair! I'm a hufflepuff.\nAlso today's fashion doesn't suit me either and I much prefer dresses. I shop online at places like Thunder egg, minimum mouse or Lindy bop. I would love to see you do a 40/50's style look book or haul too!
I like the fashion but I don't want to wear it because everyone else is wearing it and I like to look a tad unique <3
I quit like the stripes
Not a big fan of the 90's fashion myself. Totally agree how it just doesn't suit my body shape. Not sure which I would pick but I vote we veto the 90's malarkey
Yes for bows and pink hair!
Louise, you and I are of similar age, so we remember the 90's fashion the first time it was around... haha! I'm not slim either so none of it really suits my body. I'd also like the 1950's to come back because I'd love an excuse to wear a poodle skirt without people thinking I've got on a costume.
I love, love, love that you call Darcy Doodles. That is what I called my youngest too!!!
love all the lighting with copper very nice and love long cardigans....
179k in 2 days, 7th on trending, not like there are vids that get millions of in a day and aren't even on trending
How on earth does your hair look so shiny and sleek? I dyed my hair purple and it looks like a troll, its just so dry and frizzy
i love your hair
The fashion is not the best.  Im not loving the rips and holes in all the clothes.  Like its cute and was fine for summer but its getting cold now? And i kind of dont want to be buying jumpers and such with gaping rips pre made. Ill make my own rios when i bloody walk into the door handles 😂 any one else agree?
Horrible fashion at the moment. Haven't bought anything new in ages :(
I'm a Ravenclaw 💙💙💙
I want the no one cares what you wear fashion times to come so if you can't be bothered to get dressed you can go to Tesco in your PJ's and no one will care
They've started calling socks/low-cut socks shoe liners everywhere now and it's bloody weird! \nAlso you go girl, bring those bows back.💖
I love you hair. Which dye did u use? GORGEOUS
loving the hair colour, and anyone can wear bows, my sister whose in her mid twenties wears bows all the time, i think you could totally rock the bow look. i love primark candles, most of them smell so yummy and the glass containers make holders for makeup brushes and pens and things. \nim total syltherin by the way.
I feel like you should give that honey mug to Dan 😂
i'm a slytherin lmao, i low-key wish i was a hufflepuff as their common room is gorgeous 😭❤️ your hair looks so gorgeous i'm so jealous!
Wished we had Primark in Australia! Your hair looks gorge Louise 💖
I'm loving the fashion atm coz I am actually in style lol love the 90s grunge stuff :) u always look beautiful and your style is definitely you Louise :) and love the hair xxx
Do a video with Marcus and steffi😍😍
Your hair looks bloody gorgeous!💖 love it!! Love how you've styled it here too xx
I am Hufflepuff ❤️ P.S I LOVE YOU 💕💕💕
Please have a look at my first ever video using the violet voss palette please
I really want 50's dresses to come into fashion for younger people
Right now I'm always struggling to choose what to wear on the weekends. Like everyone looks so nice in everything and I'm just like meh I look crap. Fashion is rubbish ATM and it doesn't suit me
I miss dresses coming in at the waist. Everything is hitting the hips now! Stop it I don't need to look like a bin bag!!
Dunno if you've lit the pink lemonade candles yet but the smell hits you straight away 😊
Gorgeous hair 😍\nTotally can relate to how 90's are made for certain shapes !!!
I was just at the Primark in Manchester yesterday. My 3 month old is outgrowing her clothes so quickly! And she wears them all once... maybe twice. So I went and bought several bits a few sizes up so I can stay ahead of her growth. (Shes in the 75% for weight, but over 90% for height! And 100% breast fed. Woop! Woop!)
I got the pink lemonade candle for my birthday and omfg it smells like strawberry Bon-bons
I'm struggling wirh this fashion has a curvier woman .\nI'm obsessed wirh mugs and I'm in love with my bambi mug from primark .\nI love the copper lighting .x
😱 jimmy got that cactus thing too!\nI'm a Hufflepuff! 💛
Love your Primark hauls best, I've missed them.
I don't dress in a very feminine way so I can't comment on the women's clothes very much, but I like the men's 90s fashion and the more neutral trends. I don't like the high waist thing very much coz I'm a tall girl and nothing reaches my waist without giving me a wedgie. I kinda prefer the more grungy androgynous style than whats going on right now
1) Hair is beaut 2) best thing from primark recently(ish) was a set of those acrylic makeup drawers everyone was going batshit over, but for like £4 3) I totally get what you mean about the fashion thing, it's all 90s-baggy or frills-and-flounces-and-puffy-bits that just look odd on a lot of people. I snapped a pic the other day in a store of a top that looked like the classic grandma's-lace curtains next to a skirt made of classic grandma's-old-sofa material. Because obviously looking like a 1970s living room is the next big thing. But at least in autumn we can be guaranteed ankle boots and jumpers, and that's good enough for me!
Absolutely loving the Harry Potter collection in Primark!!!! Deffos heading out for the Christmas baubles!! Gryfindor ♥ 💛
Love the bow and the bauble ps i'm a ravenclaw
Gryffijgdor for days also i need that Hogwarts bauble in my life my mum and I are going to have to go on a prikark spree soon lol
A huffle myself and with you on 1950s - I can't stand most of what's in at the moment?! I don't wanna wear something with that much flesh out thank you very much ;)
Hi \nHow fab you think of your friends when shopping xx
Ravenclaw for me!! Love the hair xx
It's not normal how much I loved this video. You're brilliant 💖
Have you thought about bringing out a maternity range with a figure very similar to you I find it so hard 💕💕💕
This makes me wanna go to primark so bad. Like... right now. OMG
Im a Ravenclaw! I love you and I hope you have great day!
love your hair - the bow will go amazingly!! I gotta say I'm a proud slytherin hehe Xx
I'm with you Louise, not a huge fan of fashion anywhere at the moment, it seems like you really have to hunt for something good, but at least there is always gorgeous homewear x
Your pink hair is absolutely gorgeous!! Fits you so well! Wish I could pull something like that off 😊
Oh dear a i sense a trip to primark coming up on pay day!!
i'm a slytherin 🐍🐍🐍
i love the clothes in the shop atm!! i'm guilty of having a cropped jumper nhl 😂😂 i am obsessed with yellow. i'm a hufflepuff xx
Your pink hair looks amazing but the blonde was bomb 😭❤😂 lol still love your hair tho 😀xx looks very pretty!
I like the whole embroidery trend, although within reason people let's not go head to toe embroidered - but I'm really not a fan of boxy crop tops (or any crop tops really) or knee ripped jeans
Wow, organized Mummy!! My Christmas shopping happens Christmas Eve. Lol!
Im slytherin also. Pls dont h8 me. Lol
Hair pink

Oh no!!! More terrorist attacks on our homeland!!! Better bring in more refugees!!!
Another ISLAMIC attack in London. I'm surprised. Boy that religion of peace really injures and kills a lot of people. Hmmmm
What a peaceful Religion. So peaceful. The religion of peace. Yes. Quite.
Religion of peace leaves another calling card. Gee.....could it be islamic terror....uh....let me think...reason says yes, but my multicultural side says it can't be....it's so confusing.....NOT!
Religion of peace is so peaceful!
Theresa May might as well join the Labor Socialist Party. She is a cowardly panderer and a traitor to the real British People.\nMeanwhile the Hilary like mayor of London, Khan, sounds like Hilary saying 'we will not be divided'. Your Country is already divided you fool!
Its sad people don't know we are the ones that brought this upon ourselves\nWe destroyed the middle east and destabilized it and fueled a extremist ideology. But hey people rather just blame others for a complicated problem than rather actually doing anything to fix the root of it.\nIgnorance is a bliss.
I even lost count how many times London was attacked this year alone. The old English charming town is gone forever. Sad but true.
In other news... Sadiq Khan said he would be awarding the two arrested men the London Peace Award for their efforts.
You've been bombing all life long  , so stop creating motives, to me it seems like that's a strategy of yours to keep your selves involved in the middle eastern affairs, therfore you should bare responsibility for what you do ... stop your war crimes and keep hands off the middle east , be ashamed of your selfs, you're the one's who created the PALESTINIAN problem and you're the ones besides Yankeeland who helps prevent the PALESTINIAN SOLUTION being puppets of Zionism, you must be ashamed of your inhumane acts , stop your ironies you're causing terrorism to then use it as a challenge of media and as an excuse for your war crimes , definitely it's an anti-islamic aggression you getting away with it since ww3 ??? !!!
Is it just me or is the woman's voice really annoying? It sounds like she's spitting in my ears when I have my earphones in.
Was probably the new iPhone
London was attacked by Romans, Germans and now terrorists.
Imagine my shock, another terrorist attack. In England of all places! Very surprising!
I wonder were is the al Qaeda the taliban disappeared to now a days.
why wudnt they bomb and kill poor children and people becus there getting sent jail couple month'years and back out again and repeating them self.. wronge evil people .once they leave UKIreland go to there own country learn bomb makeing shouldn't be aloud back to UK ....yes police be around tube station for next week make people feel safe but what happens next week when there none ...24-7 Need police everyday not just wen bomb goes off !!!!!!!\nno were safe....
And yet, as some sort of counter, they'll bring up American gun violence despite our 300 something million population and the gun violence only being prominent in areas that treat guns as they would the devil. And yes, most of the murderers who shoot up people are mentally deterred and not at all politically motivated. Believe it or not, people will do anything for their religion, people are very easily brain-washed.
Most watched city on earth with cctv and know one seen any one walking on a traine with a bucket but if a person wheres air max and a baseball cap they find out where they live in hours and have there picture up a every where ...
The Religion of Peace Strikes Again !!!
Cowardly, evil subhuman muslime filth need to be butchered off the face of the earth!
I heard of this this morning and I was just like \n\n*just another day in london*
Ffs..does this incident qualify for the lighting of candles or does someone have to die..I will phone  sad IQ khan ..he will know
are they sure it wasn't someone using a discontinued samsung galaxy note 7?
That officer ran out of tape and looked anxious
Izlam .......... iz ........... EVIL\nget out and get your loved onez OUT while you can.
Stay calm,  you're being invaded.  They will slaughter you.,,,
This is what happens when you let millions of people whose ideology directly conflicts with the UDHR into a civilized country.
Someone just left their Note 7
Why do these terror attacks happen now?
this is scary i use the London under ground and seeing that really scares me
We should stop all reporting on these incidents. All we are doing is playing into the hands of fools who get glory and recognition on TV and in the papers for what they have done. We are, in effect, keeping their momentum going and playing right into their hands.
A bucket in a train, is that the best false flag theatre MI5 could come up with? LOL.
Looks more like an battery explosion/fire to me and batteries can catch fire and vent very quickly  - it will be interesting to see if this really is a terrorist incident.
All day I was wondering why my school was on lock down and now I realise how close I was to the attack. I get off at Fulham Broadway the station before Parsons Green. Not gonna say my school name but the motto is: Respice Finem.
Some builders paint went on fire
Europe needs to stop letting in all these refugees
Those responsible dont ve to use the tube\nThey are well protected
Yep England keep letting them in, oh and pay for them too..
No doubt there is an investigation underway and maybe security will be found 'wanting'. Politicians will once again be rolling off the heart felt sentiments and maybe some people will call for hanging to be brought back (dead jihadis!) and once again most people will lose sight of the obvious fact, how did they get into our country? Do you recall not so long ago the scandal of murderers being allowed to return from Syria, the only people who can allow that to happen is the government. Bearing that in mind, are the government not criminally complicit for any deaths by terrorist who have returned from Syria? Your views appreciated. God bless you all.
As long as you have a political ties with KSA you expect more than that!
i am sorry to say this, but feal i must. if there is a god, i,m sure he wouldt want all this blood bath and war. the god i grew up to know wants peace and harmony for all mankind and woman, not war and killings and bloodbath, peace and love.
Theres no proof that its an act of terrorism
lol it was the reporter
The world disgusts me now. What people do to each other
Wake up england wake up its getting late
London just can't catch a break can they.
Hey! Wait for the next attack. Till then  let the religion of peace lull the politicians to sleep.
Relax everyone they were obviasly explosions of peace and friendship.
So how's that diversity working out for you England?
Terrorists are like fleas you just can't get rid of them. You can give the kitty a flea bath, treat the kitty with pesticides and put a flea collar on the kitty, and yet the kitty will still have some fleas. So at the very least we should start viewing these terrorists as parasites. Then if somebody ever discovers how to get rid of fleas on a cat, then perhaps we'll know how to eliminate terrorists.
You are maintaining those people's in a welfare State,you are wrong,and this's the results.
Next up on Living in London: How  to hide acid burns on your face!
This is not a terrorist attack
cheers for funding them US and UK governments.
If we don't remove Kebab, this will just keep happening.
Oh hey look, number 14, nice job u.k, making the world see how peaceful and nonviolent your immigrants are. Honestly the u.k is one of the saddest countries now. They're literally being plowed and they're just laying there taking it because they aren't racist so they won't close borders
Oh look, it's more diversity...why are y'all complaining, it's just their culture?...don't you go being a racist bigot now, ya' hear?
People in the comments keep making jokes but what they're too blind to see is that this is serious and people have died, and are still going to die. I live here and it's scary knowing that everywhere I go there could be another attack. They have not made it safer because it's happening more often. Bullshit government we have over here!
Prayers from London to London 🙏🙏🙏well done America for not letting those refugees in 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
why do i get te feeling that all this is a lie? i guess im not surprised anymore oh and one more thing TERRORISM HAS NO RELIGION
Mayor Kahn of London is the problem not the solution.
and then the mayor is seen holding a dove...
Another fine job by MI5.  Terrorism is not existent since 1998.
When she says 4 attacks she casually missed out the attacks that were stopped at the last minute.
well at least they have common sense to say what it is right away... Americans (i live) be like... we aren't sure what it is and will let you know next week....
The leftist our gunna kill us all
the religion of peace strikes again.
they were packed in like sardines.!!.why is it not illegal (for insurance purposes especially).surely if the train is jam packed with sardines,it should be illegal?,just a thought!...if you get on a bus....there is usually a sign stating the amount of people that it is allowed to carry?.yet they pack em in like sardines!.are the sardines then covered by insurance?.......sounds fishy?
Every single terrorist was a moderate once
Didn't you guys expect this? It's normal for living in the city.
Inside job. MI5 corrupt terrorists, planted the bomb! All part of the agenda. \nProblem reaction solution!
Still no word about Iraqi WMDs
Bullshit little bit fire
Thank you ,Sadiq Khan.
Terrorist incident
Any casualities?
London my love
Unbelievable...
Thanks Tony Blair!

Fake attack
I live in a small village in England where they haven't arrived YET. I keep a purdey  in the kitchen ready for when they do.
BRITAIN BELONGS TO WHITE PEOPLE
I sometimes think to myself what would the world be like without religion 🤔
Its sad that London is such a beautiful place, yet so dangerously targeted.
Here it goes again, judge an entire religion of 1.8 bil people on the actions of a few morons, good job!
kill the terrorists' families??
We should hit back, return the serve!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If this was a white man doing this then it would be called mentally ill man blows something up

Rothschilds have all the money but their net worth is unpublished
Lamorris Walker on Facebook is the next best actor rising
Be quiet about your wealth and avoid these situations.
The song in the beginning is called time of the season by Zombies
I didn't even recognize Spacey until they said it was him!
the boy who was kidnapped planned the whole thing
Will watch this movie for Kevin Spacey! <3
This trailer looks like crap to be honest. Walhberg or Mr Rich is the mastermind behind this kidnapping... as to what happens in between is neither here nor there.
Prob going to see this in theater
The trailer does an amazing job of making you want to know what happens in the movie.\nI don't really watch movies much at all, but this is one I might actually go see.\nHe says he'd pay nothing to get his grandson back, so I need to know by what means he gets his grandson back, if at all.\n\nWell played Sony
Is that Tom Cruise narrating this trailer?  Sure sounds like him to me.
That's how Donald trump will say if his grandson got kidnap 😩 How much money will you release to your grandson nothing 👏
I should've became an actor! U know what....I think I'll focus on becoming one. Headed to central casting!!
Anyone know the song?
WOW AMAZING STORY. I hope Michelle gets an Oscar or something for this role. She looks amazing.
We [the super rich] look like you but we're not like you is a profound statement
Mark Wahlberg is Mr Propaganda at the moment. Boston Bombing CHECK. Gulf Oil Disaster CHECK. Improving the image of Billionaire businessmen CHECK. What's next scumbag
Nothing
Grandpa is savage af
dude said NOTHING....lol
I've lost all faith in Ridley.
17 million is pocket change when it comes to the actual wealthy
Wahlberg always has that same WTF is happening expression on promotional stills. 😨😱😵
Did they remix part of the original Zombies - Time of the Season just for this trailer or is there a full version of the remix?
Looks good, i like the remix of the song.
I would build a USS Enterprise - How about you ?
They kinda told the story in the trailer.
What? They manage to kidnap the grandson of the richest man in the history of humanity and ask for 17 million? Yeah that's a lot but c'mon might as well as for a few billion dumbass
I saw mark whalburg in the thumbnail I was like oh no everyone shut up ima watch this
Sony making a good film?
As soon as I was Kevin spacey I said I got to watch this
Didn't know this was a based on a true story, just watched a youtube video on the his grandson. By the sounds of it though i think j Paul Gerry set up for his grandson to be kidnapped to give him more limelight. His grandson sure was made to suffer thanks to his greedy selfish grandad, Hope he had a horrible death. Can not wait to see this movie for sure 😀
Is this movie about Getty Lee?
This movie better be good. I want to see Kevin Spacey in only good movies from here on.
is this a true story
If Getty was the richest man to ever live then Trump is a close second!\nGiven Getty would have an adjusted Net worth of $8.3B today this just isn't close to being true, Mansa Musa is the wealthiest person in history at $400B adjusted, Rockefeller the wealthiest in modern history at $330B adjusted.
Like Hillary Clinton, having all the money and didnt win the elections... a dream that never happend...
And that's how you stay rich.
Mansa Musa had the net worth of $400 billion
Maybe ya'll will now get an idea how easily it will be for the jew IlluminAti to throw those who follow them under the bus.
topher grace from that 70's show is that you?
It seems like they gave away too much now. Mark may find a way to get Getty's son back?
At 1:15 they say the title of the movie.👍
saw this as an ad, and I just had to see it again.
Looked like a good film, then mark whalburg showed up
well since its sony i bet 500$ IT WILL FAIL AT THE BOX OFFICE
Lol I got 20$ on my pocket😁
Lol I had thought the trailer ended at 0:06
Jeez Kevin. Easy on the banana peels.
Hell yes!
Awww, those poor insanely wealthy people. breaks your heart.
NOTHING
I really hate the few seconds of preview for the trailer in the beginning. I DONT NEED A PREVIEW OF A TRAILER DUMBASS
Dopeeeee!
Rat bastard
The kid is released six months after being kidnapped by some italian mafia. The kid goes to new york and becomes a heroin addict. He dies at 54. Boom saved you from another mark walhberg movie.
No director holds a candle to Ridley
why does every trailer have a 3-second pre-trailer now? fucking stupid
Subscribe to us for a subscribe back!💖
wow FINALLY 1 high budget film I will pay theater price to go see :-D WTH has happen in Hollywood lately there is not crap out now>? My lands how I miss the Forrest Gump and Titanic and Blockbuster days of new awesome rentals of which is all gone now. Hmm who funded this film? China?
Hah, I actually heard about this story years ago. Which I guess spoils the movie, but I'll just say the story is interesting.
Is this based on a true story
December can't come soon enough.
To be honest, I agree with Mr Getty and disagree with the bitches who want to pay the ransom.  The main problem is that kidnapping has become a lucrative business when people will pay them well.  Paying the ransom would be supporting terrorism.  In addition, there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will be rewarded with his release.
can we please stop having a trailer before the trailer
I though I've seen this with Mel Gibson and RENEE Ruso.
Way to capitalize on peoples frustration with the shrinking of our middle class
Moral of the story:\nDon't neglect instilling common sense in to your daughter.
I almost didn't recognize Michelle Williams. She changed up her voice. Looks like a great performance🍿🤗📽
Strip this song from Ouija . Nice .

You mean JP Morgan?
Is that Oscar bait I smell
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's a Getty

Michelle is playing 50 year old mothers now? Oh Hollywood
Ghetty was not even close to the richest man in history.
Wtf is a desert plate?
I'm 15 and 98% of that was my primary school and now my secondary
i was legit rocking on my chair exactly when he mentioned it
I'm still in school now and I can relate to most of these. Idk whether it's because I'm Australian and we still haven't 'caught up' yet but 🤷🏻‍♀️
Some of these are relatable even for Australia in the 90s & 00s
my high school opened in 1871 and we only had those radiator heaters which only were turned on during the winter and then turned off after lunch it was absolotely freezing
That may have been your school but that was my primary lol relatable
Literally still looks the same
I had to go to the head-teachers office because I threw blue paper towels at the ceiling and missed the bell for the next lesson😁
When I was in primary school we had to change in the classrooms until we were about 10, and then finally the girls got sent to the toilets and the boys just got changed in the class still 😂😂
Schools aren't different at all I promise you 100 %
I'm Year 11 and I relate to nearly all of them! So strange how considering i'm 15, our school was similar lol
Man feeling like a posh boy haven't seen one I relate to XD
Was I the only one that was at that posh private school around the corner 😕
My school is like this in 2017
nah man the schools are still shit
My year changed in our classroom when we were younger too - probably just a weird british thing
1:07 my reaction to everything in life 🌚
Marcus butle
0:00 he looks high 😂
This is soooo relatable😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Really relatable
Relatable as😂
I am legit watching this instead of doing my homework 😂
we all had to change in the class room until year six and girls would ask to go to the toilets but wouldnt let us
This reminds me of primary school so much, however many are true of my secondary school at the moment tbf.
schools are exactly the same
Up till year 6 the girls and boys got changed in the same classroom for me loooool
I'm in primary right now..... someone help me escape
We had a vicar come each week to our school assembly. 500 of us sitting cross legged on the wooden floor and when the vicar said let us pray and the room fell silent, Big Alan would fart and it would reverberate and the whole school would be in hysterics. I always looked forward to the vicar's visit. I would get called to the headmaster office most weeks because i'd giggle the most. Never grassed him up.
Yeah at our school up to year 6 everyone got changed in the classroom
I'm still in school now but this was all exactly like my primary school
I remember fucking singing songs off of those shitty projectors
The most relatable thing on earth
The only thing different is the TV and the projector although when we watched videos they never work coz our computers are shit and the projectors never turn on lol
I'm meant to be doing my homework in for tomorrow 😂 I cba to do it
im in school now and litterally nothing has changed 😂😂😭
literally all of them is my old school hated school so bad hahah everything you said is relatable
my school is literally the same as it was 20 years ago XD
That was literally my primary school in a nutshell
MY PRIMARY SCHOOL MADE HS CHANGE BEHIND THE TABLE AND WE DID THIS UNTILL YR 6
It's not any diiferent
IM IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT ITS LIKE
I'm in my last year of secondry school and it's exactly the same as what you were describing apart from the tv thing that was only in reception we had that and I remember it taught us the alphabet 😂😂
At my primary school you had to change in the same room as the boys until yr5 but we always made excuses to go change in the loo
this is very relatable to me, my school (in Portugal by the way) had those weird projectors that were never in focus, the weird nature area that we're not alowed in, I had those rock hard blue mats that literally feel like the floor, for years the basketball and goals post's didn't have nets in them, he had the sweet traffic 😂the gym changing rooms had no privacy at all so even tho I loved PE I also hated because I hated that the showers and changing rooms had no privacy, I had those chair in the common room that had some stains in them but they were red, schools now are way better from what I see 😂
No schools now are just as bad
14:15 literally sat at my desk with my homework in front of me npbut I'm procrastinating it lmao
Omg yes changing in a classroom lol they still do that at my sister's school
literally my school had/has all of that.. love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu7APCDENy4&t=16s tell me what do you think:)
I'm only 12 and I remember having one of those TVs in reception
I've just gone into college and all these things were so relatable!! Apart from the window smashing probably cos the footballs were hard enough to break a window as they were probably broken themselves😅\nBut i loved this video!!
So relatable and some schools are still like that
My last day of primary writing on our tshirts like I got really told off because I was like meant to bring 2 shirts so I could wear the clean one after I didn't get the memo so my teacher fucking grilled meeee and me being a 11 year old... I cried....
All of these are still relatible
School is still like that 😂😂
I'm 12 and in year 8 and I agreed with all of these but 2, they haven't changed at all😂❤️
Those foam footballs were greaaaat- especially when it had been raining *so you got soaked every time the ball hit you*
Marcus school is still the fucking same
Yeah it is weird that kids up until year 7 age 13 get changed to get her (boys and girls) in the classroom and like all schools in my area do that
my school was still children changing in a class room before me and my friends as a laugh said the boys were pervs xDD
literally the same memories of primary school and what's happening at my secondary school and I'm 15,Marcus things haven't really changed😂😂
Literally relatable to almost all of them 😂
I've literally just left year 11 and my school is still like that wth 😂 my school is a shit hole tho 😂
I was born in 2004, and my schools are exactly like this...
The gym mats. Getting dressed in the classrooms   The gym shoes. The old tv.   I'm 14 and relate big time.  Also the paper towels
I had a radiator behind me in one of my classes and the room was always freezing so i used to swing back on my chair and just chill there with my arm on it to keep me warm, so cotch
React to why don't we!!!!
Is it sad that I just left primary school this year and my primary school was the same as all others and I would pretend to wet the paper towel so I  could keep getting up to wet it again and not have to really listen
Omg I go to school now and all of the stuff is still exactly the same and so relatable
Until year 4 we all had to get changed in the classroom and one time one kid pulled down his pants as well as his trousers. And I'm in year 10 and we still use the cgp books. But they make us buy them ourselves. And Marcus, school is still as crappy now. Basically all of these apply to me!
You never showed the results
Me news a bit better but Yh most of that is relatable, I'm year7 in secondary school😴 love ur videos tho Marcus xxx
yep my schools were the same
This is the most relatable thing ever! I'm 20😂
We had to all get changed in the same classroom until y6! or 5th grade if your American. It was horrible
Lol if only he knew barely anything has changed 😂😝
I find this utterly unbelievable, but we have showers in my school and if you use them or switch them on or do whatever bored hyper teenagers do with showers in my school, u get excluded for a couple of days and banned from the pe block at lunches and breaks. This girl once got excluded for using the shower when another girl spilt juice all down her leg..... what was she meant to do? climb into a sink? she's not a bloody hobbit.
We changed in our classroom until year 6 😂
Getting changed together is normal till yr 4 cause it becomes illegal when in yr 5
no my school is not different but it was the first school to be build in my area (stevenage)
lmao still got half of this shit at my school
Im 17 and I can relate, should I be worried
My school is like that it's so bad
wen i was in year 4 we got changed in the class rooooommmmm BOYS AND GALZ!
I'm 14 and my school was legit the same
We still have half of this at school 😂😂😂 especially the mats
we did that till year 5 😐
Schools are still like this now and I know coz my high school is exactly like this ahaha
i like my high school
My school still has the projectors, some smart boards but a lot still have the old school projectors
is it werid that i rly like the colour of that blue corridor ?
It is weird. Up to year 6 everyone change in the class. In year six boys had to change in the corridors in front of everyone. Not to mention the people who got naked when changing 😖😵
Pretty sure all these are pretty obvious relations considering they're all the factors of the mass produced schools made in the 80s/90s
It's all exactly the same now, nothing has changed!
It's still relatable even though it is like 10 years later
Nope my school is literally that, i actually am ashamed xD
In my primary we got changed in classrooms all the way to year 6 but every year had 2 classes so the boys went in the other and girls were in the other room to boys
This is the most accurate video i have ever seen

I love your videos, because you doing them full of euphoric. :))
good job apple keep it up....
Yeah,it changed your life.You life is dependent on it,you don't have friends.
Rly 1000$ ? The iPhone Xpensive already arrives and for sure everybody is hyped. Sry for that price even as Apple proponent that's not ok!!!
How much is that apple park shirt? I want one. 😭
$20 for how many postcards? I've been to the Apple HQ Store, and they have outrageously priced trinkets. Stuff no one would use. But this looks like they have more stuff. Cards are a must. That Apple Park shirt was legit. And I thought you would get that Fuchsia hermes watch band?
Apple won't change people's life anymore
Hey Justine, you look great as always... just wanted to say: In Canada, starting at $1319 !!! That is just CRAZY!!! I just booked a 7 day all inclusive trip to Cancun Mexico, flights, accommodations, all you can eat and drink for a week for $1200 Canadian. Apple will never see my money in their bank account. I am beyond happy with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.
I like your videos. You seem like a very fun person. I used to live 5 blocks from there as a kid. I think that was a plum or walnut orchard then. My Dad thought he did good buying our house for $22,000 and selling it in '67 for $28,000. Now it's valued at $1.3 M. HAHA
That building look like an ovni i saw long time ago!
THE LITTLE KID i died
I justine* you so beautiful😍
What song is that at around 7 minutes?
How many decks of cards did you buy, sell me one?
What is that song playing throughout the video in places and then again at the end of the video? it's really cool I can't wait for the AppleTV 4K, myself.
I still think the Design sucks. That notch just looks out of place. Imagine when the phone is in landscape mode...... I know apple fanatics will still defend it.
1:06 what movie is that??
it would be awesome if there was a purple (galaxy colored) iphonee
Wow you are practically having an orgasm over a phone #sad

This girl is getting really fat after she has a kid.
Does the iPhone X have depth effect for the back facing camera
I like you so much do she have a husband or boyfriend
I loved the video. So much definition. So many colors, Such a good and bright day. Wonderful just wonderful.
I bet she has a 99 year old boyfriend sugar daddy that is missing just 1% for his final update, and then his soul will install itself in her bank account.

These people taking photo's of the new iPhone with an iPhone they paid hundreds of dollars for less than 1yr ago, the level retardation with these halfwits is unbelievable. The comment section is littered with the most brain dead consumers of Apple products, all trying to justify stupid and pointless purchasing of absolute trash.
Super nice building. How were they able to build it? Because morons keep buying things that were out on other phones years ago, and paying Apple a premium for them. Suckers...
Boy wonder what Steve-o would say about the X........
they got all money dont pay that much tax they put up the price for iphones  just crazy really
Really enjoyed the video.
a tour? it's the same thing all around
Ijustine, Please do not promote Iphone X anymore. It is a scam. Super retina? It is made from samsung thank you!! Face ID? Samsung 8 has it and you know what? It has fingerprint scanner too!! Animated emoji? Snapchat thank you!! More? It costs 1000USD!! Holy shit!! People, please listen, Apple is just taking advantage of you. I think is time to let them know it is not okay.
omg like if get i that i am not gonna take the bus anymore
she hasn't aged in 10 years?!
Don't bother to review iphone x or whatever until you answer this question:  Who designed this product?
just pre ordered the iPhone 8 plus!! couldn't get myself to spend the thousand dollars on the iPhone X.
why should we care about your day with Apple and that joke of a phone?
Who is watching on an iPhone?
iPhones are designed to run out of memory so that you have to upgrade. Face recognition is a CIA program. All iPhones constantly stream audio from your microphone to the beast central computer to feed the AI algorithms for the continuation of the existing brave world and the furtherance of AI for Skynet/Atlas autonomous armed robots. The apple logo represents the lie of Satan in the garden and is a reference to the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Apple Has To Love You!!!!!!!! You have The It Factor...
suddenly you  not a fan of the the rummored  GOLD blush colour\non your previous video you said it looks cool now you dont\ntipical GIRLS
Oh my god never ever seen so many sad people in one place, it's just laughable honestly come on people they're phones!!!!!!!!!!
You're so cute Justine. I absolutely LOVE your enthusiasm! 😂😍 I love that you've always had and continue to have such passion for this. 💖 #warmfuzzies
Go to google and simply type: *gexxguides* You get the only one 100% Working clash of clans working method by 2017
I would love to use the camera to take video of you slowly smoking a thick cigar!
Let me give you scenario. What if the IPhone came with disposable batteries. I understand it's not an Xbox controller but... I would want to know if people would like that?

#AppleX=GalaxyS6
You're a cliche...
Song at 1:49?
Where can we get those cool Apple cards with different products?!?!?!?!
pretty sure you didn't miss the face id failure..
This phone is freaking insane! I love it!
that child is more comfortable at camera than me in front of class
sorry but Samsung 8 and Note 8 are both still aesthetically  and functionally better than Apple..
I was born in 2007
I thought it was coming out in sep21st?
Really fantastic video, Justine. Thank you for the hard work, and for sharing your elation.
Hi, this iPhone is very un-xpected in this year and the existence of  display having fingerprint scanner under the display is awesome feature, hope we'll get to see face is and fingerprint scanner under the display both feature in the upcoming device next year 2018, #cheers.
Apple is a shitty company. Screw the supporters
must be nice to just drop 500 on a band lol
Why would you cry over a phone that you'll drop in a week
Why, U haven't changed in 10 years! How did you do it ? Wow!
The girl\nIs perfect for blowjob
Is it worth really buying
Everyone is in complete debt, but the idiots keep buying stupid crap.
I suspect there is NOTHING Apple could do to displease you.  How can you IGNORE the ugly NOTCH and the ugly PRICE ???
hey apple get off the corp WELFARE and pay some taxes~!
I like how Justine is the last to leave lol
if you are u can keep up.. poor lol yeah right
I also bought bunch of apple watches they all costed 20
So if there's no home button how do you activate Siri?
you like iPhone for what? do you know anything about iOS? or how software works? or you just like it because its apple and it hast beautiful design ?
I agree with the JLaw fatigue. She's a good actress but it's just like... SHE'S IN EVERYTHING. GOSH.

I enjoyed the imagery, symbolism and allegorical depth of this movie but I did not connect with it emotionally at all. I think I just have a hard time connecting with characters that are not really people but instead allegorical cyphers. While interesting to watch it left me 100% emotionally cold.
This movies was blasphemous, anyone can see that the entire plot is about how God is evil and the baby eating part was a perversion of the eucharist. You wont see anyone making something like this about Islam.
Its the most vulgar movie ever.!!
Dawg I haven't let go of Jake Gyllenhaal not winning an Oscar for Nightcrawler either haha
How is it not a horror movie? It's _called_ Mother!\nAlso now I must see this movie.
Just saw it, and it was possibly the worst movie of the decade. No idea how JL, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfifer could sign onto this horrible movie. I know the weed nowadays is awesome...but did no one sober up to tell the director this plot sucks and we will help you write a different plot. Horrible...
People keep trying to make this movie seem super deep and complex. It's just a shitty movie. It's the most pretentious shit I have ever seen.
i thought these movie had something to do with Danzig.
Don't watch this movie
Heard this movie wasn't good. So much Mystits blamed Trump for it and demanded a raise.
Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress for her age. Still a little immature to play some roles, but I don't see how she can get anyone aside from die hard fans of The Hunger Games to go and see her movies. She isn't that good looking, and that only matters in acting when starting a career. I don't see the appeal in her. Do people think she is a better actress than most girls her age? Some fan of hers, please post a link to a scene she has been in where it highlights her talent... and Hunger Games clips don't count. I fell asleep in the theater during the original.
she does suck she adds nothing to any movie
And out of respect for Darren Aronofsky I'm not gonna tell you what it is...because no one knows what it is.
Wow. An insightful review from Jeremy Jahns that stands above his peers. Amazing.
The movie was a amazing experience I have t seen a movie that just mind f@u ked me so much
I don't give a fuck about Oscars really peter sellers didn't win for dr strangelove Goodfellas didn't win Oscar even Stanley Kubrick didn't win any damn thing !!!
When u go watch this movie please pay attention to detail!!!!! Keep an open mind also!!!! I feel like the people that didn't like the movie didn't really pay attention to detail .
Please contact me if you do not mind,Commit myself\nPSID   furyusai
Did Jeremy Jahns used to be 'Ask Ninja'? \n\nIt's been bugging me who he reminds me of and then it just hit.
Repent from sin, Jesus is Lord, crucified, buried, rose on the third day from the grave, turn to Him
even when Jennifer Lawrence is phoning it in she's better than half the actresses out there, which makes her super dope when she's actually putting in the extra effort. She's definitely worth buying on Blu-Ray
I said BULLSHIT aloud when this movies credits rolled. Worst film ive seen in a long time and I know film buffs will try and be like OHHH YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. Nope. I understand. It's crap.
I like her nudes
One of the most uncomfortable movies I've seen in a long while. The symbolism got a little heavy handed and lost a lot of the plot but overall still made for a very intense and thought provoking movie.
my favorite aronosky film is the fountain i love that movie.
Jake Gyllenhaal should've won that oscar man.....His performance in Nightcrawler was A-fucking-tastic.
This thing is bombing big time. I'm not sure why they would spend $15 million on Lawrence for an arthouse experiment that nobody will watch?  Or why Lawrence would expect a $15 million payday from a movie like this?  Actors typically take lower salaries for artsy experiments.
This is without a doubt one of the biggest expenses of ever had and I know the people are going to hate it and I know people are going to love it and I know that they're going to people be people who have no idea what to think of it but I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you I love this movie this movie is amazing when you figure it out is a brutal yes but listen please do not let something like that obscure but it is I'm baking you just please be open-minded when you go to see it but I promise you this movie is completely worth the watch just to see what you think
This movie was shit, yiu suck at reviewing movies man
I personally thought the ending half with all the people was horrific. I'd call it a horror movie from that alone
Just call it a fucking allegory
This movie is a movie you need to smoke before watching. My mind was more open and I felt like I understood the underlying meanings that I wouldn't catch sober. Usually why I enjoy smoking before a complex movie.
seen it last night.. got me confused.. I couldnt wait to see it but after I did I kinda regret it..what a waste..
this incoherent babbling  just wasted time i'll never get back.
I actually liked this review. Yes, you don't get to know anything about it - and that is a bonus for me - but it also tells you what it's not, and that makes me curious to see what it is. See what I'll get out of it and than maybe watch the spoiler review later to see what he got out of it.\n\nAnd hate her or love her, but Jennifer Lawrence is a great actor. When she goes for it, she's incredible and she deseves the Oscars she got. Just had to say that cause it's seems to be cool to hate on her these days.
I got tired of being confused so i left before the end.  too many confusions with not enough explanations.  I feel like I've lost both my money and my time.  Fairly great acting, but to me both the writer(s) and director of this movie must've been high before and after making this movie decision.
This movie was next level bonkers.  It genuinely made me angry at times but it really did challenge me which isn't something I have experienced in a while.  \n\nThis was a film my friends and I immediately went to a diner afterwards to sit and discuss about for at least an hour.  What it meant, the pros and cons because it's most definitely a polarizing film.  Some of my friends really were into it while others hated it.  Me, I love the film because it was the first time since I don't remember where we all felt the to talk about it right after watching it.  It's been so long since I've watched something like that!
I don't even know what the movie is about
Man that Nightcrawler tid bit really got me... Jake needs an Oscar now that Leo has one. Jake should have been nominated for Nightcrawler AND Nocturnal Animals. But he will probably win for something like Stronger which I think does not showcase his talent.
I honestly think Nightcrawler is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Oh well...
Arguably one off the greatest movies ever made.
Michelle Pfeiffer is still fine as hell
Are u serious? Not every movie is for everyone .
Even after you know what this movie represents  it's  a terrible movie. It's  so ridiculously  loud, unorganized, and full of itself.
I gave this comment a like because it's acknowledging that I gave it a like and that's meta
I knew it looked like Trash
Love the review. Fuck! The trailer had me going. Don't know whether to see this movie or not.
Just saw it today. I was waiting for the reveal almost the entire time; I kept saying to myself Come ! Come on! - although I wanted to shout it out. It never came. A total piece of shit/waste of time and money. Nothing supernatural or evil; really just like a drug-induced nightmare (which I think was the intent). Look elsewhere. Waste of talent.
Kind of a Spoiler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hate that I know the movie is a metaphor for mother earth. People are throwing that around in the comment section  like it's nothing. I now will never know if I could have found that out myself or not... god
One of the few reviews of this movie I find myself agreeing with _(and this coming from someone who despised your Dunkirk review)._ 👍 Thank you for not shitting all over it. Now off to your Spoiler Talk.
Watching Requiem for a dream ended in frustration. So I guess this movie is definitely not for me. Thanks for saving my time..
My family has a saying for movies like this: delightful and disturbing. This one was no delightful; just disturbing.
That movie poster is a straight homage or rip-off of Neon Genesis Evangelion's.
It was horrible. Think the part in Requim for a Dream where the tv breaks open and there is loud music, lights everywhere, what the hell is going on type for an hour. No film critic wants to give it bad reviews because they are hoping they missed the point.
I cannot stand horror but feel like I'm missing out on so many great films because of it (eg IT). Glad to hear that this isn't entirely horror/haunted house and theres more depth. It's releasing on October 13th here in India..because Friday the 13th -_- Can't wait though!
I sh*t you not.  It leads up to a new born (representing Jesus) getting it's neck broke and it being carved up and eaten by a mob.  Think about it.  BABY EATING!  Come on.  When does this sh*t finially piss you off?
Forget Jennifer Lawrence. Overrated actress!\nWould give my two cents to sit through her crap movies!
Watching the trailer had me thinking it was a remake of rosemary's baby
this movie is like oh i get whats going on, 2 seconds later what the fuck is going on?? seriously weirdest movie ever, great experience though
nightcrawler was fucking amazing ......... the world knows nothing!!
I came out the movie and I was like I need to see it again just to put eveything back in palce
This film was unique, I don't know if I hate it or I love it. I was gasping the entire time thinking what the fuck lol
This movie is end of evangelion confusing with its visual metaphors
Funnily enough, the trailer almost made me not go. A spoilerfree review (not this one, though) did.
You are one of the few people I see review this movie that actually sums up exactly what this movie is. Well done.\nExcellent movie. Don't expect it to be entertaining, but the message is powerful.
Based on how he reacted to 'Drive' all those years ago, I was pretty confident JJ would DESPISE 'mother!' Colour me very surprised
(I AM):\n\n(Gk. ego emimi);\n\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\n\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\n\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\n\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\n\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\n\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\n\nJesus said unto them,\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\n\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\n\nbut Jesus hid himself, \nand went out of the temple,\ngoing through the midst of them, \nand so passed by.\n\n(John 8:58-59).\n\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\n\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\n\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\n\nThen answered Jesus \nand said unto them,\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \n\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\nfor what things soever he doeth, \nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\n\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\n\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \nand sheweth him all things \nthat himself doeth:\nand he will shew him \ngreater works than these, \nthat ye may marvel.\n\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\n\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \nand quickeneth them; \neven so the Son quickeneth \nwhom he will.\n\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\n\n(John 5:19-21).
Nightcrawler should have won many awards.\nMother trailer was very 'Rosemary's Baby' to me, but after this review, I gotta go see it. \nAlso, Brigsby Bear with Mark Hamill. Have you seen it? Will you review it? I enjoyed it.
Jeremy my nigga. I been watching this nigga for years but this fucking confused me.
It's cinemascore is an F
I was actually interested in watching this movie but i completely lost any interest in it when you said that J. Lawrence was in it...
I went into this movie expecting the feature length film of the trailer\n\nHow dare I
Why is this idiot trending, when Chris Stuckmann has put out a much better review?
My wife and I saw the movie yesterday to a near empty Saturday showing. I purposely didn't read explanations beforehand so that I could form my own opinion. I mistakenly thought it was going to be a Rosemary's Baby kind of plot.  The one heads up was hearing Lawrence say The house represents earth.\n\nAfterwards, both of us left the theater thinking it was a swing and a miss. Almost every shot of Lawrence was a tight shot that totally filled the screen with her face. The two most relevant segments of the movie seemed like never ending nightmares you couldn't wake up from. Not an experience you could call pleasurable or entertaining. \n\nCertainly the director had delusions of being Fellini but what you have is an embarrassing;y bad movie with a laughable last scene in which Lawrence is covered with fake looking make up meant to look like here charred remains. \n\nThe few people in the movie were checking their watches during the last 30 minutes. Maybe worth watching on Netflix.
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! \nHe loves you! Believe it! Don't listen to the lies of the enemy, Jesus Christ LOVES YOU! Repent and put your faith in Him! \n\nHe is not angry at you! He will help you with whatever you are going through. He is waiting on you to call out to Him. He will deliver you. \n\nI pray you make this moment you call upon Him, if you haven't already. He will save you from what is coming! Tomorrow is not promised to any of us! So please consider making Jesus Lord of your life today! \n\nShalom, friends.
Awful artsy trash.
Plz review GLOW
Movie is shit
booiiiiiii hell na
Review Logan Lucky next

Satanism in Hollywood intensifies
YES! Nightcrawler deserved a nomination
What a horrible review
So existential sounding.  Drrrp
Nightcrawler was amazing
Review American Vandal!! 😁😁
I dont get why some people would dislike it because it was mismarketed\nThats so retarded, the film is objectively good no matter what genres you normally lean toward
Oh wow\nThis is going to be great movie\nI am going to watch it
This movie is atrocious. It tried to be this highly intellectual poetic artistic whatever bullshit it wanted to be. Youtubers should learn from the amazing clickbait ability of this movie. \n\nAnd all you critics are praising the sh*t out of this cause you might get labeled as too stupid to undestand a movie that is way ahead of its time if you admit to finding it terrible. Art is abstract, ain't it?\n\nGod, you'd really see how film critics are a bunch of pretentious snobs acting high and mighty for giving this sh*tfest a 69% on rotten tomatoes.
Just left the movie theater. Waste of time and money. Sick. No subject. Worse moviei have ever seen. My husbnd got a headache.
Went and saw it because literally nothing else had tickets. WASTE OF MONEY.  Terrible acting terrible primace and Literal baby eating.  They actually ate a baby
The movie was so bad, don't waste your money. It was good acting but man the movie dragged
So is it like Donnie Darko or something?
To sum up the whole video, he basically said Jennifer Lawrence is really stupid and fat. Your welcome
You have to be a film major to understand what you are saying.  Luckily, I was a film major.  Will anyone else understand this?  I do not know!  Thumbs down on the movie.  Watch my vague review in laymans terms on youtube.
Did anyone else get a Fall Out Boy Vevo ad on this video?😂😂 I was like I don't remember this part of the video
You are the sun and I am just the planets spinning around you I never never related to a lyric even more as a fangirl
if the young and menace video and the my songs know what you did in the dark video had a baby, this would be it.
This is like the Flashing Lights video with llamas...
*A U T O   T U N E*

So, Brandon Urie doesn't know how to use a showel apparently
Listening to this song over and over for that little catch in his voice when he repeats I'm done with having dreams.
Why is this song so awesome
Song so, COOOOOL!! \nBlood from him...?
They never fail to suprise me xD
How come nobody pointed out the shot fot shot recreation of Flashing Lights?
Loads of work in this music video
Fall Out Boy is still around?
The graphics are so bad, what happened to any of the camera crews and animators
Flashing Lights if you're into furries instead of bikini-clad Amazons
Best song on M A N I A so far
this gives me the phoenix vibes
love that song so so so so so so so much~~~~❤❤❤❤
body removal by\nhis name is jeff\n👌👌👌
Everyone says they hate FOB because they sold out and that the new music is terrible, but honestly, I don't care. They're still together (rip mcr.) with the original members (Brendon! At the Disco) and still doing what they love. We can't say that we hate them just because they tried a new sound. If you do, then that's fine, just shut up about how they're terrible, because that's your rude opinion.
Giving us a warning for murderous llamas but not a warning for Young Volcanoes thnks fob
I waited four days to watch this video and didn't expect high expectations for it, but decided to give it a shot today and absolutely loved it! If your Fall Out Boy Fans go to my YouTube channel And check out my original music videos, huge fans of FOB so spread some love to my channel by liking and subscribing ❤️❤️🤘 👍 (Quarter Till Five - Moving On This April) or (The Fallen Weekend- Beside You)
I found Drama Lama's Siblings.\n*only furries will get it 😀*
I didint like young and menace but this is really cool :D
Hmm......what does this music video remind me of??? Flashing Lights by Kanye West.... where the woman starts a fire and reveals Kanye in her trunk, and stabs him??? I'm disappointed. FOB is always creative and artistic with their music videos. This one, not impressed. Even though you have a llama costume on, doesn't make it different.
No words to describe how much I had been waiting for it, loooove

I'm going to the concert in Fresno CA yayaya
Where the wild things are
No llamas were harmed in the making of this video, instead they made harm :D
If you don't actually try to listen does anyone else hear You're just a blast in the wheelwatch instead of You're just the last of the real ones?
The song is amazing but I hated the video 🤣
I really hope this isnt their last album😰 everyone says that every time they put out a new album they kill a band. Folie a deux-Panic! split up soon after, Save Rock and Roll- MCR broke up within a month later, AB/AP- Tom left blink- 182. I hope it isn't themselves they kill this time! Oh no! I'm scared😱 😥
is it just me or does fallout boy have a thing for kidnapping....it seems to be a recurring theme
This song is amazing if it was performed by Calvin Harris. FOB went full garbage with this album
Thats so great song but the video i don't understand 😂😊
Got a FOB add before a FOB video xD
No joke I have now listened to this song 70 times. Help.
What was with the llamas
Is it considered mentally stable to print off pictures of Pete Wentz and put them on your door?
What did I just watch
is it odd that this song kind of reminds me of Favorite Record? Amazing song!!!!
I love their new music but I really miss the old sound they should really bring back the infinity on high sound
Damn this song is great!!

Am I the only one who thinks the refrain sounds like the refrain of All Time Low's Life of the Party ??
This is the first time me watching this and it's already been stuck in my head
im supposed to be working on a 5 page essay but here i am singing along to this song and dancing around my room... oh well
Have any of you read the credits at the end? They are funny
idk bout you but i got a fob ad
Is this a song or a drug? I can't stop listening to it!!
Um, do we have another young blood chronicles situation on our hands 😍
Just more one great song! I love it😍
It's not a FOB video unless I'm asking myself what the fuck am I looking at

You can get pregnancy belly bars.
Hi Fleur, when a friend of mine was pregnant, she was also worried about her bellybutton piercing. She found one of those really long flexible bars and moisturised the area with coconut oil to stop the scarring/stretching, and she had no problems whatsoever!
I'm 34 weeks now and at our 4D scan our baby girl had her arm over her face too!!
I just took my piercing out once it became uncomfortable. It's unlikely it'll close over in 3months xx
Hi fleur, I took my belly button piercing out while I was pregnant because I was scared it would split! I had it re pierced after I had my baby but the piercer told me that there was no need to of taken it out as it would of been fine. So I think it's down to personal preference and how it feels as you bump grows. Hope that was helpful xxx
Where are the black and white musslin cloths from?
You look so wonderful!! We love watching YOU, not just for the content, but because it's you! You can put anything up and I'd still watch it! ❤️🇧🇷
For your hip, get those round big balls and do some hip stretches on them.
you seriously look so good being pregnant fleur! : )only a few months away till the day your baby comes into the world, eeek! : ) i still predict she'll come either on christmas eve or christmas day, just saying : )
I would take the piercing out now. The whole is already actually going to be expanding a bit. Nothing bad, but you'll just end up with a slightly more obvious whole afterwards if you leave it in any longer.
I left my belly ring in during the whole time during both of my pregnancy's
Anyone knows the name of the company for the black and white muslin cloths?
I am fleur de force fan for life! I am so excited for you. Keep the nursery and pregnancy videos coming! I LOVE YOU!
What is that lip color?! 😊
You should a sugar cookie name reveal
I'm not pregnant and whilst I love kids the thought of having a kid is not something that interests me but I love love love these vlogs, I suffer with depression and whenever I'm feeling down I come back to these vlogs because they just make me so happy it's honestly so cute seeing your progress, how happy you are and how glowing you are and it's also really relaxing so just eases my mind. You look absolutely stunning as per usual so try not to worry too much xx
beautiful baby bump mommy de force! Really enjoying watching the experience!
Awww, you're positively glowing! Lovely baby bump, am so glad everything is going well for you with your pregnancy. I've had two babies and kept my piercing in for the first as long as I could before switching to a silicone bar. I soon had to take it out though as, for me, it was uncomfortable. My piercing closed up so now we have had our second, and are probably not going to have another, I am gearing up to go and have it pierced again. I had pelvic and back pain too with my youngest, I found warm baths and bouncing on a gym ball really helped :) xxx
Yay bonds!
Cutest bump! :0]
Get a pregnancy bar
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
You look amazing! Glowing xxx
Congrats! Looking as beautiful as ever!
Love it ♥️
You look amazing Fleur. I can't wait to see how the dogs are with the baby. I had an English Springer Spaniel and they are the most loving, affectionate dogs who in my experience are so gentle and caring towards humans x
You look great! With my first pregnancy I took me belly button ring out and it actually never closed up. On my second pregnancy, I never put my belly button ring back in but the hole is still open.
I had the belly button when i was pregnant i kept it till I was about 7 months but then its stretched so much I had strech marks around it so I removed it but once in a while I just put it in to keep it open so when I gave birth I wore it again and the strech marks didn't show as much with it :) Goodluck x
The extra long Flexi bars are a lot thinner than the normal bar and just prevent it closing over
Was shocked Bonds isn't a big thing in England ! Best baby , pajamas , bra and undies brand !
I took my piercing out with my first baby and it has scarred pretty badly. I'm 6 years on from having her and on my fourth pregnancy and there is still a hole there, it's not big enough to put a bar through but it's definitely there.
You look gorgeous! And so radiant and happy! And the nursery is so cute! :)
You can buy plastic stretchy pregnancy belly bars, they're long and they stretch with your body, then after baby you can pop your metal one back in.
Loving these videos ! So lovely seeing you happy xx
Awwww! You look so beautiful Fleur. Bless you and family.
Loving the bump updates!!! I think I've heard somewhere you ca get maternity belly bars, they're longer than normal bars so it can stay in through pregnancy
Took belly bar out around 24 weeks. The scanner said it got in her way haha. Im now 33 weeks and there is no way I would of kept a bar in haha. It's looking like it stretched and scarred as this point but won't know until I've had the baby. I would just take it out tbh. Looking gorgeous and just wait until u get bigger! Exhausting. I have bad pelvis pain and haven't worked since 28 weeks. Good luck x
Fleur, you look absolutely beautiful and stunning in the vlog. Please don't worry about you putting weight on! \nAlso I love love love the lipstick you have on, which on is it?
This vid will be nice to look back on. Happy for you!
I got to about 25 weeks and took my belly bar out and just put it back after the baby. Ps - ur bump is so diddy! U look amazing. Pregnancy really suits u! 😁
What lipstick are you wearing? It's gorgeous!
Hi Fleur \n\nI had my belly button pierced from 16. I had my first baby at 24 and took my belly bar out at about seven months. My belly button never did the 'popping out' thing. I put it back in at about three months post partum and it was fine. I took it out again when I had my second 4 years later and never put it back in. Since had a third baby and the hole is still there 😂 I think I could still put it back in if I wanted to. No scar at all just as it was when I took it out now 8 years ago. Maybe I should put it back in again.
I never got the line that goes up the belly. So don't be surprised if you don't.
I took my piercing out at 30 weeks because I would catch things on it. I tried to put it back in after and even bought a smaller gauge bar but it had closed over already. My only stretch mark was the skin in between the two holes, above my belly button! It's unavoidable I'd say. About 6 months later the stretch mark was barely noticeable and 11 months later I can't see it unless I really look!
Looking gorgeous!!! You can also get a maternity belly bar to keep you going xxx
I have my belly button pierced and I did take the ring off during the second trimester. My skin stretched a little around the piercing area and my belly button changed shape too so I don't really feel comfortable putting the ring back. However, the hole is still there so I can put the ring back if I want to. Wish you all the best with your pregnancy :) You look fab!
I have just today found out that I'm pregnant and I was hoping you could do your current pregnancy skin care routine?
put thick fishing line thru the belly  button piercing its fexible and will keep the hole open.
hahaha when you said That's my naked belly bump in a wierd voice it cracked me right up xx
What's on your lips? X
you can get a baby bump belly bar
Some stores sell pregnancy belly rings that are a lot longer
Ahhhh just saw this didn't know you were pregnant !!!! So happy for you xxx
You look incredible Fleur! You have such a glow to you xx
i havent had kids before and i have not intrest in having kids (im in a same sex relationship) but i would advice on peircing you could get a long flexi bar if u really want to keep ur belly done
Fleur, you're so adorable! You're really the cutest. And you look beautiful, happiness and your baby bump suit you very very well. My only tip is to enjoy every single minute of what you are living. Sending love 💕
Where did you get the faux fur rug from?
Yes. Take out the piercing. It will stretch. Eventually, the bottom hole will be completely visible.
You look amazing and I love the nursery ❤️
how come I feel like Fleur's voice has changed? haha her voice is more soft now..
You look stunning Fleur ! I can imagine it can be hard to adjust to all the changes your body is going through so I understand you can get a bit insecure sometimes but truly from where we're looking you are so so beautiful and specially looking super happy!! All my best wishes 😍😀😁😚
For your piercing, ask a piercer what they'd advise you. There is special jewelry for expecting moms, but it may depend on your anatomy whether it would work or not.
You look gorgeous, Fleur, you're glowing ! Love the little bump :D
I love your vlogs! I hope to have a family some day soon and its nice to see other people's experiences. Loving the relaxed chatty vibe of these and I completely understand you superstitions, I think I would be the same! xx
Fleur where did you get your jumper from? It's such a beautiful colour! Xxx
You are a pleasure to watch Fleur and you have not changed at all personality wise in all the many years I have watched you. Your baby is going to be very loved and I think Mike will be the most incredible father as well! Always keep an eye on movements - I nearly lost our  baby at 39 weeks but luckily I went in voluntarily to hospital at the right time and now he is a happy healthy three year old but a nights sleep could of changed that for the worst. If you ever worry about movements go straight  in  - this is the only information I would actively scare expectant mums with and as you have a large following I may help others too. Xx
Love seeing your beautiful baby bump! I'm 21weeks now and having a little boy!! Excited to see you developing xxx
It would be great if you could do a piercing video on what you've got/had :)
My sister had a belly bar when she was pregnant she had a flexible belly bar but when she was very pregnant she did take it out x
I put a flexible bar in my piercing and it was fine. I had a similar shape to you, I looked like I'd swallowed a gym ball. Love n hugs to you all. Xx
Where's your pink jumper from pleeaasseeee?
I replaced my bar with a plastic flexible one, which I definitely recommend. But for me it still hurt so I took it out and now I can't get the bar back in.
Hi Fleur I just wanting to give you my experience with belly button piercing. My belly button piercing got in the way very early on around 14 weeks, and I took it out and a month post partum I put it back in with no hassle what so ever. xxx
I've had my belly button pierced for about five years and I'm currently 28 weeks pregnant. I've taken my belly button bar out months ago and the hole is still open so I wouldn't worry about it closing up. From what my friends have said (they had their belly buttons pierced also and since have had children) it's personal preference based on what your belly will look like after you've had the baby for you to decide if you want to put it back in. I've got friends who's bellies have gone back to their pre-pregnancy state , and some who's belly buttons have been extremely stretched and covered in stretch marks. So just see what you feel like after 😘 all the best to your little family , you're looking lovely 🌸💕 xxx
fleur bonds zippies are amazing! both my babes lived in then x
You look absolutely AMAZING!!!!!! Be proud of that cute baby bump, of course your body is going to change and you are going to put on some weight in places you ordinarily wouldn't, but ultimately it will all be worth it when you hold your baby girl in your arms. It is then you realize how insignificant body change is  lol Enjoy being pregnant and continue to be the inspiring, joyful soul your are. 👍
Hi 😁 I had my little girl in Dec, I took mine out around 20 weeks. The little bit of skin stretched in the middle of the bars stretched when i was bigger but it all went back to normal a few months later. I did jam it back thru the hole a few months ago... so it closed over and I have had my for 15 years without any issues until now. Iv just left it out now and it seems to be closing over. I was scared carrying a baby around and lifting prams etc it would get stuck an rip out or something. Anyway good luck I hope that helps 😁😁😁
You look fabulous, Fleur!  XOXO from Eagle Rock, CA
I took my belly bar out and never put it back in as my tummy wasn't the same .-(
You can get maternity belly rings. They make them soft as well so you won't have any chafing problems. You can find them on Amazon.
I took out my belly button piercing and didn't put it back in. Felt it was more comfortable like that. I don't think u need to worry about the hole closing as it took mine a while before it did that.
I ♥️ squidge and trekle they are so cute and want your attention so badly 💔 great video though 👍🏼
I had a piercing with my first pregnancy and bought a flexible bar for the later stages but I found it too uncomfortable when my bump got bigger so I decided to take it out completely. I just didn't bother putting it back in afterwards, that was just my personal choice, but could have if I'd wanted to. I've been left with a slightly stretched piercing hole, which looks like a scar. Not that horrendous to look at really but that said I do regret not putting it back in afterwards.
I absolutely love these pregnancy updates! I especially love how chilled and honest they seem. I'm not a mum and don't plan on becoming one for a fair few years, but I find these videos so entertaining and nice to watch. I love your normal content and I really love theses videos!! So happy all has gone well so far, I hope your good luck continues through your entire pregnancy! So nice to see that the baby and mum are both healthy and happy!
hi fleur, so so cute stuff for the baby! i have an idea, i'm also very organized, u may want to get large baby clothing storage furniture with many drawers and label the drawers in weeks 1-4 weeks and months 12-36 months, so that when you try on the clothes, if they don't fit and are  too large move the clothes down the storage drawers to the next weeks, months and years drawers, luv u and have fun!! melissa k. pa, usa
I have had 2 babies and my belly button piercing never closed up. I think you will be fine to just take it out and put it back in once she's born.
I love the Pregnancy updates! <3 stay healthy
Your happiness is palpable! Thanks for sharing this with everyone!
Hello Fleur :) Regarding the piercing, I haven't been pregnant, nor do I have a piercing myself but I recently talked to a gynecologist about it an he said to take it out as soon as the belly grows and put in a little plastic spacer... This spacer is flexible and basically looks like a plain piercing and it  prevents the piercing to heal up! And when you've had your little one you can put your piercing back in. \nAnd I guess you can get the spacer at a piercing shop? Dunno. \nHope this helped you :) Good luck with your piercing and enjoy your pregnancy as long as you can! You look absolutely stunning!
Fleur, I love your baby updates, keep them coming.
You're looking amazing! Love watching your updates 💕 I had my belly pierced prior to having my son and took it out when it got uncomfortable. I didn't use any of the flexible retainers and had no issue putting it back in afterwards (I personally decided I no longer wanted to wear it but could still easily put one  to this day and my sons 9).
My niece is nine months now and I can tell you with them living with us you are in for the best time. We have two dogs that absolutely adore her an become her protectors when she sleeps and her playmates when awake. Congratulations on everything and you look beautiful!!
I know that Missy Lanning of DailyBumps has a pierced belly button, she definitely took the piercing out but I'm not sure if she put it back in.
You look so gorgeous! All the cute baby stuff is adorable!
Your looking amazing! Definitely have that pregnancy glow x
If that beautiful rocker has a matching ottoman... you MUST get it. It will make you so comfy during those long sleepless nights of nursing and comforting. Promise!!
How nice that you don't have to worry about buying a single baby item, you just gladly accept free stuff from every single company. So ridiculous. You can VERY easily pay for these things yourself
I'm shook I'm watching this in bed and it's picture day
Please stop with the star Transition
What are the chances that PJ is a clone, too, and the real PJ made him so he can film a perfect clone video
Love this type of your videos
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what nightmares are made of.
Those glasses I need some like them !!
Can anyone tell me the name of the background music / song used at 0:41?? I've been trying to find it for ages.
Where's Wheezy Waiter and his cloning machine when you need him amiright
the hair is the best part
Why does he look like harry styles?
“looks a liitle bit like Harry Styles”
Can you make another Crafting with my son? You + Brad is incredible comedy
where have you been all this time
It's not the perfect clone because you forgot your glasses... But I guess it'll do haha
sometimes his videos get 10x times weirder or stranger... 😂♥️
Pj I have bad news....I think your clone is a bit....defective...
*Oh eyo! Wel-welcome tew Planuf Flesh. We got what you need here. We got planufs from out of this world and in this world. Come on by and grab urself your own diy clone kit diy kit. You have to MAKE the kit before you can TAKE the kit. Eyoooooo.* Planuf Flesh, no we're not a smex shup.
Later that day, Pj gets a copy right strike from Planet Skin.
I can't tell the difference \n\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Are you like me and don't want to get out if the bed in the morning.....\n\n\n\n\n\nI have never related to anything so much in my life.
It looks like the  guy from coraline?
how could you do that to Braj?
if you think this is weird I have news for you...\n\n\n\nthis is one of his more normal videos
Still waiting for 'Crafting With My Son' part 2...
PJ, I'm Australian, I'm 17 years old and I want to date you
I know he doesn't like to read  text heavy books but on the other hand i think he would really appreciate the weirdness in Walter Moers books. Plus the illustrations are amazing.
It's not gonna be as cute when it's dark
i felt incredibly uncomfortable when the clone started to say the outro
is it bad that i think the head kind of looks like Susan boyle?😹
This is fucking terrifying
More Caft w son

Love how prepared you are for videos. Realising in advance items will take a month. It makes for a good video.
You should do a video where you let your subscribers pick out your outfit For a week.
You should try having your shampoo and conditioner made for you! I saw it in this article here and interested to see how it works for you!\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ii-tried-personalized-shampoo-conditioner-made-specifically_us_58b86b57e4b0e9d19b92666f
I have watched all of your videos twice now..
I went to Wish but nothing is free there
When you said this could be holo\nI immediately checked the channel if this was a simpynaillogical channel 😂
Giggling to myself over the waterproof phone bag and screen protector thing :')
Going onto week 8 still have not received anything I ordered. Wish suck.
People do this on ebay as well, for example advertise a phone case for $1 and then when you specify your model the price will rocket up. Very misleading
You should try boohoo.com or another cheap website. LOVE THESE VIDEOS SAFIYA!!!
Oh my god I'm so happy you changed your intro song to the one the guy from Fiver made for you. <3
That wish ad been annoying the shit outta me
Am I the only one who started singing Do you chains hang low as soon as Saf spoke about how her watches chains hang low...LOL
You should do a fashinova haul on their jeans because apparently they have the 'perfect jeans'
You should do a I copied _____'s instagram for a week video!! (Kylie, Ariana, etc)
That fake rip n dip shirt though
When i clicked the video the wish ad came on
I found some transparent high heel boots on wish lol
Can I do no re wish things\n
Next video 5 free items but the have to be verified by wish
I bought those shorts too. I got the 3xl and they were so small I gave them to my sister. Lol
First time watching a video from you you are funny i loved it
Can you order from Groupon?
Stuff from wish is mostly from a website in China called TaoBao. The clothing size in China is usually smaller than US size.
You should do a video that's I let children pick my outfit(s) that might be entertaining
 You should buy wedding dresses from wish
I love those wish shorts
YAAS KEEP DOING THESE PLEASE.. TRY THE OTHER SITE PLEASE LIKE DRESS LILKY AND LOL I FORGET THE NAMES.. TRY THE PLUS SIZES PLEASE! YOU CAN COMPARE SIZING TO AMERICAN BRANDS HERE.
Actually, they add the price to the shipping so that you can't get your money back if you didn't like the the item/order was wrong/never arrived/broken.
When shopping on wish in order to get the promotional price it times you from the time you put in your cart to check out in order to keep the price such as free lol I've learnt from screen (window) shopping
Safiya's hair is getting longer.
@1:55 Did you just Assume the grandson's gender?
I do not like new intro song. :( Still love you and your channel though!
she should order wedding dresses off this app
YOU SHOULD DO THE FIRST 5 THINGS VERIFIED BY WISH!!!!!! ILY!!❤💕💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤❤💕❤❤❤💕❤❤❤💕❤💕❤❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕💕❤❤💕❤❤❤❤❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤❤❤❤💕❤💕💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤
Hahah omg the song from I bought the first 5 things Facebook told me to
You should do a video where you wear wigs for a week
try mercari or whatever the fuck it's called
Do more wish things it's so fun to watch and it's cool😀
So you got a bra, shirt, shorts, watch and phone case.\n\nIt's an outfit with accessories 🤣
I'm in love
Thanks to your video you made me wish addicted :)) I've spent probably $100 in the two weeks I've had the app :))
It's not free tbh they just take the object price and put it in the shipping price
I love these Wish hauls! Maybe you could do a Wish men's products haul using Tyler for a model/tester?
Do your chain hang low\nDo it wobble to da flow\nDo it shine in the light\nIs it platinum, is it gold😂
You should get the first 5 things you see verified on wish
I bought a twenty one pilots phone case on wish for about 5$ (it was 3$ and 2$ shipping) and it's actually not to bad. It's doing its job of protecting my phone.
Buy a full free outfit from wish
Fun fact: I'm wearing a pair of those old school Soffe shorts while I watch this video :)
where did she get the mesh top from.
Wish, is like AliExpress... Don't purchase anything from there,for the love of God
OH MY GOD! Where did you get your cat shirt?! <3
I think that verified thing for the phone case is because there were some glitter phone cases that were recalled after causing chmical burns
Omg I love you and I just watched this video and the other wish video 😍😍💗💗
I absolutely hands down love your wish videos so much they're so interesting and attention-grabbing you should make more
So Wish sells the same stuff as Aliexpress but for more money. Smart...
The Chinese have low shipping cost so they scam people like you by  including the low cost of the item in the shipping cost.
I have a Website Its Called Romwe. They have clothes there for really cheap and good deals(from what I have seen on this shopping website) And there are a ton of options to choose from. I have never ordered from this website but I think it would be really interesting to watch! ------------->  Please like this so Safiya can see this :)
I love when she reads the items names\nIt's so hilarious!!!!
I just love how intelligent she sounds
Oh my god I bought that shirt in a medium and COULD NOT FIT AT ALL. I had to give it to my 12 year old niece.
You should try buying the wedding dresses and review the quality
I had a pair of those shorts as a kid...They were baby blue with a white stripe. It'd be cool if you tried out AliExpress, Zulily or Geek apps.
I think the shipping cost is the cost of the item and shipping is free. They just say its free and you pay shipping so they can advertise as free
She should do first 5 things on pandora
I feel like you should do asmr videos too!
I bought the shorts wayyyy before this video😅 Yes, they are very short shorts!
My review of those shorts was totally in the video! lol.
Anyone else think the shorts look like the ones from river dale???
i got an ad for wish and now i want the dragon incense holder they showed on it
Girl, those some dick me down shorts just so you know
How do you record your screen???
I'm vomiting at how that shirt is cut and it gives me major ANXIETY!!!!
Wish is really good for getting jewelry - everything else is pretty hit or miss. I also suggest not getting anything with a rating less than four stars. Four and a half is ideal. You have to really pay attention to the reviews, like the ratio of one stars to five stars. Also, the free stuff is never really free. And I mean never. It's purely promotional. I've used wish for a little over a year now and jewelry that is now listed as free used to be $1 with $1 shipping and now it's free with $2 shipping, so... Yeah, it's pretty shitty. But if learn how to navigate the site, you can find some really good items for really cheap.
Who would buy a medium orange!? \nMe:*buys a medium orange shirt*
That sexy shoulder shirt though 😂😂
Can you pleaaaaase do a YESSTYLE Haul\n\nTHANK UUUU 😊💖

Aguero golden boot>>>>>
Crystal Palace next LOL!
easy
im the best thanks for the upload, beany!
Pep is a fraud. Spent £1 billion and can't score 10 goals against Watford
*Where's all the City haters saying Pep is a fraud now? That was an absolute slaughter & so was Liv'pool 5-0. As a Chelsea supporter I fear City this season.*
EPL welcome to total football, watch and enjoy, just starting #takenoprisoners
best manager in the world okay city come on pep come on city...
*_Great win for City_*
You city fans should appreciate every day this guy is your manager. Coming from a Bayern Munich fan. After he leaves you will miss this astonishing performances believe me. No matter who comes next
Take note all you bitch ass City haters, we're on a man hunt and hungrier than ever !!!
again not good enough #pepout #Cityincrisis
aguero  fanstastic
C'MON CITY
Heavy breather
Pep bringing la liga scorelines to the epl
I'm a city fan but let's not get carried away. Let's not trash talk or be cocky yet. Injuries and complacency can happen at any time. Plus we got chelsea at the end of this month and still yet to play top 6 sides.\n\nI really hope we defend against the top sides and not commit the fullbacks too much forward against them.
!´m so so happy!
Best bald manager in the world.😁😂😂
Why are people not commenting fraud
Looking real good for Guardiola...Jesus has forced Aguero to step up his work rate and now Aguero has the ability to become golden boot
Big sigh, wish he was at Arsenal!
The pep haters are low in numbers on the comment section. I wonder why!
Are United still the favorites???!???!?? 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Top of the league from here on out
How awesome was that performance? That was total and complete football...\nIf only PEP wasn't a fraud? We'd be even better, if Pep was a decent manager.... But apparently he's a fraud according to some football geniuses.
WHERE ARE ALL THE PEPS A FRAUD TROLL'S NOW. YOU ARE NOT, YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE JEALOUSY IS A SILENT M*THER F#CKER INNIT .GORD CTID. OOWHHH MAN CITY.....THE ONLY FOOTBALL TEAM TO COME FROM MANCHESTER®
IN PEP WE TRUST 100%
Your still not gonna win anything this year you glory hunting tossers.
If pep was argentinian, cant imagine what messi-aguero partnership will be like. Argentina would probably be 4 times WC champion by now
I think its between City and United who wins the pl title this season, I hope Kompany stays healthy for the rest of the season, because defensively city is still vulnerable, maybe Pep can bring a new CB in january.
Every PL fan: In the PL any club could win you'll never see a 6-0 score line in the PL .... where you guys at now? Hmm now that an English club finally has a talented club worthy to compete in Europe they're thrashing pub clubs like watford.
I guess 6-0 is what it takes to get Pep to smile
best manager in the world
City and Utd show-down this season
no matter wat city do pipo will always talk shit so to all the city n gaurdiola haters go fuck yrselves or rather go masterbate
Meanwhile, Manure are celebrating being behind their city rivals PMSL
City city city all the way
I am so happy.. Happy new year
even we didn't play our best xl so don't take it easy united dogs
Man city means everything to me and the fans ...personaly I better miss a meal than missing a man city match.... Love you citizens'
GGMU GGMU 
Pep gloats by bigging up his opposition to make him sound better
Thank you CITY!
Man city vs Chelsea \n4-2\nMan City  vs CP \n10-0
goat
this is on trending lads
Goat..
plastic club, arab puppet
Bald fraud
Money talks
MCFC!
beautiful
BEST FRAUD IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!
Guardiola the team that played the last 20 minutes is  amazimg use them offten. And we fans Will watch beutifull football.
I'am Man.United fan but i admitted the football from City just amazing to watch.\nAttacking Football that he brings to City simply magnificent.\nAs a lover of attacking football i admire his philosophy.
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
Don't let this romp fool you ,Citeh will collapse either midseason or late season like they always do.
City were playing this style under mancini and pellegrini, nothings really different
Can not say he is the best till he bring city the champ of epl...
My Top Six Prediction :\n1.Manchester City\n2.Manchester Utd\n3.Chelsea\n4.Liverpool/Tottenham \n\n\nOpinions?
When Real and Barcelona win 6-0 English fans ARE TOLD BY THE ENGLISH MEDIA that the Primera is an easy league and the Premier League is the tough League where the big teams die to win!! when City win 5-0 against Liverpool and 6-0 against Watford what happens to the tough Premier League?!! WAKE UP ENGLISH FANS....ITS ALL PART OF MARKETING...
fraud! city will bottle it towards the end of the season
Faggot
Hey Lovely people, I'm loving reviewing these sites and experience and sharing the good, the bad and the ugly with you all! I've linked most of the items in the description box for those asking, however they often sell out or are removed on ebay! Hope you enjoy and see you on Sunday for my next video xx
Where on eBay did u find the yezzys and can you reply with a link 🙏😂
Where has your Afro hair gone?  \nCan't stand black girls trying to look like a white girl it don't make sense???'
Where's the link for the yeezys tho? 😬😅
The yezzys on ebay arent real most of the time, chinese companies know the resell price and sells replicas for the price. Because legit cream whites go for 450$ canadian, a giant gap from your purchase sorry :(
Patricia you are so pretty!! 💓💓
The hook from your toes being squished comment 😂😂😂
her use of the word beak to describe things has me dead omg
Love your hair! Real hair or wig? If its a weave can yu make a video about it
You had me rolling at the end with that last shoe lmao
do a forever 21 video ❤️
Patriciaaaaaa!! I'm glad your subscribers are increasing everyday. Can you do a little something in honor of your OG subscribers?? Like just chatting or relationship stuff. I feel fatigued by all of the spending you do lol. Not hating, but I love hearing your thoughts on life and stuff like that. Your latest videos are making me feel poor and quite demodée rofl 😂😂😂😂
Do a review on Romwe.com!!!
You look so cute with short hair! I love it! I'm feeling it! Girl you are fabulous
Hey, I am a shoe plug. Comment the best way to get in contact with you if you're looking for legit yeezys, Balenciagas, and more
Is anyone else seeing MacyDress on their Facebook page & do you think it's legit?
I loved the heels in the end , some in black would look so beautiful 💖
I love her accent it is so beautiful 👟👞👢👡👠
Did you buy something from sportsdirect.com sometimes? :-)
You must tell us about what you did to your hair
Enjoy Watching ur HAUL video, Very funny and helpful... never bought shoes from china, maybe i try. Thanks For sharing
where have you bought your necklace? love it!
You slay in every video 😍
I'm a new subscriber and I love love love your videos already... but I have a request for you to review.... the JOOM app, I've done some shopping on there for jewellery at like 30p and so far so good... but clothes are cheap too, possibly review worthy???
We're the yeezys real or fake?
You didn't say how much you paid for the Yeezy's.
girls, the best fashion dupes are on ioffer.com !!! I got so many and the quality is amazing for super cheap (but you have to wait 3 weeks to receive them...)
'I fee like I've talked enough' -Patricia 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Will you please do a Romwe Haul. I love your channel btw
Wait, am I the only one who responded in their head or out loud when she asked how we were doing today?? 😂😍
I watched one video. This is my first andni subscribed instantly
Hi Patricia proud you make so much amazing video that's impressed me and so much very lovely and very very interesting so I just have my own YouTube channel I would like for you to give me a time so thank kiss 😘
I buy a lot of my shoes off of eBay and am always happy with my purchase. I never have anything wrong with the sizing so I don't know what happened with you!! Some nice shoes though!
I love love love your hair Patricia! It's gorgeous! 💕
You can get those exact heels (the burgundy shown in the picture) on lolashoetique.com Along with plenty of other cute heels
I'm a size 9😂
You're such a warm and positive person, I love watching your channel
Im not a fan of ANY white sneakers at all! I think they make your feet look extremely large lol. You picked out some cute things though.
I sincerely hope these videos are a tax write off.
How much were the yeezy's though?
Please can you review 'everything5pounds.com' ?  Love You ! Xx
U are just so lovely and cute, I am literally watching all ur videos and affraid i run out of stuff to watch ahah🤗😘
'you might just lose your life in one move' LOL love your humour girl xo
How many bills you spent on the yeezys
how tall are you?
Hi...do you have the eBay link for the boost
Girllll I've only just discovered you and omg I just love you so much already wow
Where is you necklace from please?
Hi there! I have been enjoying your reviews recently, and would like to know if you could review JustFab.com? Thanks.
If you want cushion get you some dr shawls for the tall boots for the insides👍🏽💯
The yeezys are not real
The Yeezy's are fake
Awesome video! :D I am a shoeholic, shouldnt watch any shoereviews as they make me wanna buy more :D
she is so funny!
or you went to Florida and stole them....
is her hair textured? its really bouncy and smooth looking..
the last ones finished me!
I'm laughing so hard, And I'm offended. Dead.
That hair. (In Patricia's voice) haiiii haaaiiii haiiii🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🤛🏽👌🏽
Im really excited, which is most of the time. shes so cute omg
The over knees were okayish,but a thicker legged person, would have a bit of a struggle.
Smells like burning fire smells like chemicals you could get high on I cried 😂😭
She didn't list the yeezys in the description box
*spends 500 dollars on Yeezy's to go to the store*
...and I'm offended. Best line of the video. Thanks for sharing your ebay experience with us!
aw this was posted on my birthday
If you don't have anyone to give those shoes to can I have them. The Ruby red first shoes size 11 @patriciabright
why are yeezy so expensive... they aren't even nice...
try ioffer!!! i've had loads of stuff off there like michael kors etc x
Rather than a bunch of cheap stuff week after week why not buy less and invest in some quality staples? Plastic, glue etc. just not a good look. Love your hair like this.
Hi! love your videos! 😘 you should try https://www.shopmissa.com 😁
Does anyone know what she has on her lips?
Love the over the knee style but my calves and thighs are WIDE.
Can you please do a closet/ shoe collection video??? 😊\n\nLove you 😘
I loved this Patricia! But am I the only one who thinks them yeezy shoes are very ugly? Lol
bow trainers are a joke haha x
i really really love her hair short it's so pretty!!
She didn't say how much the yeezys were ??...
I'm not about having that big foot 💯🔥😂😂😂
Your hair looks so bomb! You are so gorgeous!
Adidas? It literally took me a second to understand what she was talking about😂

Sid, you're not Zayn Malik
Trending!!
CLICKBAIT but Dina honestly i love your vids
Dina why do u always scream 😫😂
Haha, blondie's a goofball! 😄
Seem pregnant to me 👀👀
What a load of shit
wait your white but in muslim  gear ? why ????
what she thinks of herself? what is she? her husband ewww.
Also for the dumb Muppets commenting on her headscarf which majority of you are not Muslim try if you can Google what nuns wear which is similar to a hijab
Religion is a waste of time bruh.
Nice to see a suppressed woman on trending
She'd look better without the t-shirt on her head
Just a click bait YouTube who gets no views and no attention
That title plus the thumbnail made me think your about to suicide bomb someone
How have I found myself here I feel sick
why didn't he die his beard blonde as well? lol
Are you white? genuinely can't tell and am just curious
does anyone know where dina's ring and bracelet is from?!! 😭😭 i love them
Raghead
Click bait
Does Sid speak Punjabi or Urdu?
Wonder why this is trending... hmmm
Why is this shit on trending
it is against islam to make these videos.many are angry.
Why am I here? Why is this trending?
Nice,  promoting a symbol of oppression for the whole world to see.
u gonny build a bomb up there
Take that fucking thing off your head and escape before your man shanks you
You're that far up your own arse your turning brown......
And this is trending?Yawn.
Your allah doesn't and has never existed, and your precious prophet muhammad (*piss be upon him*), held up by islam as a shining example of a perfect human being that all should aspire to emulate, was in reality an *illiterate, warmongering pedophile* that has left the world with a legacy of *systematic genocide, generational incest and atrocious intolerance towards other cultures,* now fallaciously described by so many today as a religion of peace.
Can you vlog your next terrorist attack? Fucking Muslim
Oh god a muslim no thank s
Why does she have a curtain wrapped around her head?!
Your bomb didnt work properly, stop trying to kill my people please.
Muslims are not British simple.
Hazard turn him into a Beyblade HAHAHA
Chelsea please beat arsenal today
Hazard turned Coquelin into a fidget spinner!
R.I.P 4rsenal
Chelsea win 6-0
Morata vs Lacazette \nZappacosta vs Kola\nBakayoko vs Xhaka \nHolding vs Cristensen\n\nGame on. Lets see who have the better signing and prospect for the future. COME ON YOU BLUES!!!!!!!\nLets shut the gooners up.
I am a chelsea fan and today is birthday,can i get a like?
Hazard The Mercenary hope one day he turns overrated Ramos inside-out
Hazard and Morata are 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Savage Dan🙌🙌
I'm surprised Hazard still isn't serving a life sentence after what he did Coquelan
Chelsea cmon you blues! Like for Chelsea to win!
Hazard is a god. 4-0 Chelsea win!!
Lets destroy Arsenal, 3-1 for Chelsea
Jheeeeeze! Man like Dan! 🔥🔥🔥
Morata's headers are lit.
He turned coq to be fidget spinner
200th like here
Chelsea win !!!
Let's smash ARSEnal
Hope he does the same today.. Come on you blues 💙💙💪
Such a shame that Coquelin is injured! 😂😂😂
Sav Dan is killing it
really sad when hazard didn't play last night, i know maybe conte wont take the risk but i think it's important to win that match, and i think even the unfit hazard still better than any other player.
I remember him being a ghost in the fa cup final as well.
3-0 by Chelsea ...Morata,Alonso,Willian
Chelsea to win 3-1
Beyblade lol
First
Sav like Dan
David Luiz had to attack more because everyone else wasn’t doing enough and got pinned into a red card. I really hope Conte changes the squad the next few games because we are in need of some variety. Can’t expect to win against an in form Man City when we can’t even score against Arsenal at home....
But hazards not even starting, I'm almost worried now
I remember that goal i had one aim to score against Arsenal and i make sure it was a greatest goal that can be talked about in years and i'm super delighted to score such a beautiful goal.
Is it okay if I don't like the new third kit?
Is this savage dan from 3 shots of Tequila???
i was the 1600 guy to hit like
Lol 0-0 and a Red card a win for Arsenal. Deluded club
disgrace of a performance today.
this is on trending
Never knew Wolfy was a Chelsea fan, always pops up on miniminter's channel too
Chelsea vs Arsenal today come on Chelsea!!!!!!
Guys, Please who can give the name of the music in the background?
Please don't lose and give those fans something to cheer about. We are much better now go and prove it
I predict Morata and Alonso to score
He had to wake up at 8 am to watch the match? I have to wake up at 4:45 am to watch
Morals has more to his game than Lacazette, he can score with both feet, his head and he can dribble.
If you're reading this....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a great day
Martial is a better player than hazard.
Willian and Pedro are USELESS\n4 games without Cahil, 4 wins\n2 games with Cahill, 1 draw, one loss, reduced to 10 men on both occasions\nOur best possible line up. \nGk: courtois... good keeper, but needs to get the sloppy mistakes out of his system\nCb: Azpilequeta, good defender, no flaws\nLuiz: just keep his head in the game, played well today\nRudiger, good defender, solid\nWb: Moses, very good defensively\nAlonso, deadly going forward\nCm: bakayoko, so good, the physical man\nKante, obviously \nFabregas, must learn to track back a little more\nSt: Morata, great finisher, needs a little more time to learn how to play an epl defender\nHazard, he needs to step up, 20 goals a season at least and 10 assists, a player of his talent is expected to score that many \nChristensen, zapacosta can fill when needed, and drink water will be could when we need to be more defensive in place of fabregas
Lets destroy arsenal today hazard may man👍
We've won 9 out of the last 10 vs Arsenal at the bridge. 3-1 today. KTBFFH
he needs at least 15 similar goals in a single season to win the ballon dor

Your audio sucks. Get better equipment
Is hernandez being played out of position and does he know he's being played out of position ?.
I love this channel . Dan Lawless please get rid of this battery operated microphone it's ruined the interviews .
Ben Foster should of been sent off...
Why cant we beat these teams uhhh so frustrating
Be thankful you only have to see that sort of game twice a season we have to watch that boring bollocks week in week out depressing as fuck
West ham are shit. I do hope you lot get relegated this season.
Football is shit and the players are all over payed, I don't watch football or support it, the only input I can give is Chelsea beats all.
Game plan pro tip: score more goals than the opposition.
The audio is toilet. Like your team
Lol! One of the fans tried to push me off the train and he didn't even move me 😂😂

I agree we didn't have a game plan which is often the problem with Bilic. only reason we kept the ball a lot is because they allowed us to. Says a lot when our best effort was Obiangs long ranger and stop play our best goalscorer in years on the wing FFS
SAVE OUR FREEDOM\n#FixRussianYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V5lLXtRtCg&feature=share
*sigh*
.tihs smaet ruoy mah tsew no tihs gfmO
COME ON ARSENAL
Dom out here be looking like Dr Who with that coat
carroll the problem, we make too many sacrifices as a team for him, he should be a super sub for when hernandez isnt working
Board and Bilic OUT! 😣
This is just a couple of losers trying to be rich, copying Robbie
This channel is shit full of cunts
How is this shit trending
Unpopular opinion but I would have kept snodgrass and got rid of Ayew instead, has Ayew actually had 10 decent games for us? Should have given snodgrass until January to see whether he could rediscover his hull form
West ham sucks
The btec aftv
Have fun in the Championship next season
How the fuck can you be the better team with no game plan 😂 retards
I had no idea you Brits had girls this pretty and intelligent. Maybe it was a mistake for us to fight the revolutionary war for independence from the Monarchy. With girls like that, I think I'm gonna start a petition to rejoin that government and instead of bowing to the Queen, I'm bowing to Emma.
BBC are race-baiting pedophile enablers
Does anyone believe this?   It is so obviously a drill gone live.
I like her English
emma stevie still there! helping the news media with their comforting sound bites.
UK people are selfish and deserved to die more in the future.

She has the demeanor of someone talking about their favorite movie and seems to be suppressing a smile throughout the video. Can't say for sure that it's a false flag but yeah, it's a false flag... way to go BBC, fake news since 1922.

Sounds like what happened in Bethnal green in ww2
Notice she said we need more people on the underground, see in times like this you're all left to figure it out yourselves. When the unions complain of a system running on minimum numbers they aren't saying it for fun you know.
I read this wrong...
It must be horrific to be living your life and then one day a bunch of people show up and terrorise you day in day out!!\nIt's not like it's the1830's!!
I am really insulted by this shit. The BBC are actually saying This is how gullible and stupid we think you are
Here is an example of, the dangers of taking in Child refugees from Muslim countries. They become a huge problem as they get older.
I don't care if your police, i don't care if your a kid, i don't care if your pregnant, you best believe I'm stamping over every single body to get my fatass out
Wow...pathetic sheep.  Killing each other over nothing.  They were in no danger.  I avoid crowds.  People are very stupid.  This seems staged.
I just heard that there are 3,000 active investigations of potential terrorists in the UK and another 20,000 that police are concerned about. In the US our FBI has 6,000 possible Isis sympathizers under surveillance. Time to ban Islam and burn all Korans.

Everyone gets on at Wimbledon BOI , Most people get on at Earl's Court or West Brompton WTF Where's the logic
They really need to come up with better scripts for their crisis actors. It's getting more ridiculous every time they stage an attack.
And they ll still let more f these so called refugees in
Do the people complaining about immigration not realise most of these attacks are done by British Muslims?
Use your words...stampede, acid, crying little boy, chaos, flames, train.
Utter BS!!.I wonder how much she was paid for her extremely poor acting...lol....Why would you even do the noise of the train doors closing....Hahahahahahahahahaha!!
Why there was no cctv,  every carriage has cctv? I want to see cctv of this accident
People say these are actors which I don't believe. Some people can handle stress better than others and if you get on the battlefield, you'll see what I mean. I have seen people shot in the head and was able to block it out and keep my composure, while others would practically have a mental breakdown and freak out. Seeing people killed with blood everywhere is not something that is enjoyable by any means, but you have to deal with it and move on. In the end we all have to go anyway.
She doesn't sound very scared or shocked
0:20 \nanyone triggered by her door closing sound effect ._.
It's tough being a Muslim these days. To any fellow Muslims reading this ditch the ugly ass beards you guys have and dress like a regular westerner, that way people won't be able to suspect ur Muslim unless they ask. And females don't wear the hijab. Honestly for my Asian or middle eastern bros and sisters idk what you can do cos u stereotypically look and fit the description of a Muslim. Hope this helps
shame that bbc cow wasn't stampeded.
You can find below an Arms Control Center video tutorial (and its script) on bucket bomb effects in London and the relevant security measures (related to the recent incident in the London tube)\nhttp://armscontrol.eu/2017/09/bucket-bombs-in-london-effects-and-security-measures-video-tutorial/
so the train doors shut, then there was an expolsion and she ran for her life? so presumably she has suoer human traits and can oass through glass?? there were layers of women underneath her screaming..??? not one bit of burn damge in carriage, no smasehd glass, and a smouldering little plastic bucket. a guy who said he was next to the so called bomb was injured? his hair was singed. she is taling aobut crush in a panic. the panic was the issue surely
Damage to the train carriage?
I feel so bad thats not even right man..\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/london-train-fire-help-teen-recover
*I replaced the pink shirted girl with Daenerys.*
Emma Stevie works at Delamar Academy, famous for doing make-up for films and TV. What's the connection there? Why isn't she even slightly upset, if she's been in a human pile-up and seen a kid with his face smashed in? Why has she been hanging around all day? Maybe for the free pizza and water, which were arranged in advance for the drill taking place?
F A L S E F L A G
Read that as human centipede at first :D\nAnd on a serious note...bla bla bla immigration bla bla musles fish stick. Thank you. But seriously I am glad nothing too serious happened.
Errm where's the cordon and bomb squad to sort out that bomb that failed to detonate properly lmfao\n\nCome on people move along,\nWalk straight past bomb on your left please.....
I hope it was only liberals who were hurt.
*Europeans in 2039*\n''Shit... We have no where to go..''
This government seems more interested in political correctness than protecting its citizens from these continuous terrorist attacks.
I don't think we should jump conclusions and say that this was done Muslim terrorists. We now have to consider that Far Right extremist/ White power terrorist are now on the rise and fighting back. And if you thought that the Muslims were bad you ain't seen nothing yet.
Time for India to rule england. British govt is incapable of ruling itself and saving it's citizens from islamic terrorists. England needs to be converted to non-abrahmic religions to achieve peace and stability instead of that satanic dead god which they worship.\nbye.
they have not soul, they are barbaric and uncivilized.  they kill anyone.  they must be deported  and their families and friends.   they must leave our countries and stay away, far, far away.     merkels   ideas.   move with brexit, demand  immediately.  last time i was in england, i did not recognized it.   london is unsafe and  now plagued with terrorists.   do not travel to england.
Now she can apply for a bit part in Hollyoaks.
SHOW ME ...  I DONT BELIEVE A SINGLE WORD ...  MILLIONS OF SPY CAMERAS ..MOBILE PHONES ..  I wont believe it till you show the cctv footage ..  not one person without hair/eyelashes/beard/...  K ill H umanati  at it again ..   playing with our minds ...FEAR FEAR FEAR ...   BE AFRAID ...  the  ill/eat ...are afraid .. that's why they do this ..
this is a sad day for England and the injured people will need at least 6 months off work to recover from this,  there was allot of smoke and a loud bang,  as some people had their ears bandaged in other videos and this alone is a 7k payout ,
So BBC who did it ? Oh that's right fake news .

Few days after Donald Trump travels to saudi for a $110 billion arms deal just few days before and on the same day of the Manchester attack he is in Israel the Land of the Zionists? \n\nThe date of these attacks are so blatent! If this such a real planned attack im sure the Anti-Terrorists officer,FBI,CIA  etc would have been well prepepared for these attacks heck they are more intellegent than us! instead they are Post-Terrorist officers after attacks are done only then they will do real police work to keep the mankind safe.\n\nCan you not see the Pattern the only question remains now is \n22-10-17??\n\nPlease forward to make people aware of this.

To be able to give such a coherent interview after being caught up in a terrorist attack is beyond me! Our stiff upper lip attitude, as shown by Emma, is why we will always prevail.
Trainers, Brits are so weird.
Rest in Peace Harry
Rest in peace Harry.  You were fucking awesome.
Taken by that increasingly rare ailment 'natural causes'. Rest in peace, Harry.
RIP Harry Dean
Rest in Peace, Mr. Stanton.
.\n**** THREE DIS-LIKES\n..NO SOUL YOU HAVE !!\n*****
Just heard the news of his passing.  RIP, Harry
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
What a man. What feeling his face and voice conveyed.Today is for crying, but all the tomorrows will be for celebration of a beautiful life well lived.
REST IN PEACE  MR. STANTON,  LONG LIVE YOUR TALENTS  🕊😔⚘🎵🎥💕
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton. You were loved.
RIP Harry. Thank you for sharing your talent for so many for so many years. Til the other side...
Beautifully done. I never knew he was a singer.
Rip Harry
Fifty years ago I went to the pictures to watch Cool Hand Luke  and I enjoyed him singing Just a Closer Walk With Thee which was brilliantly evocative, and very apropos. I think that was the first time I'd ever heard a religious song that wasn't dull. This clip is good, VG considering his age and the effects age has upon the vocal chords.\nHe should have sung more during his career.
He was great in Repo Man.
Rest in peace Harry. You were a multi talemted performer and we enjoyed every minute with you.
You did it, my friend. You lived a full and complete life. It's a pity that we have only one to life to accomplish it.
rest in peace, dear Harry..  i loved you
Powerful ..... on the same level as Johnny Cash cover of Hurt... RIP.
Man, the Red-Headed Stranger himself has to be crying right now.....

Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
He still has a presence
Lovely.  I used to know Dean.
Mashed me up ♥
Like it:)
Rest in peace
Rest in peace Harry Dean Stanton.
Just heard he passed, this was the first film I ever saw him in and he introduced me to this amazing song, travel well brother x
I remember a couple of years ago rewinding this part over a few times because he sang this so sweet. You could tell he'd lived some life. RIP.
Now you're there buddy, now you're there.
Rest now. You're in the grace of glory forever more. R.I.P Harry Dean Stanton. 1926-2017
Rest in peace and with the lord near
Harry Dean Stanton is the best - under appreciated actor of all time! Hands down, unless you count 'leading' actors.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
R.I.P., HDS.
RIP Harry Dean
Just a closer walk with thee, Mr Stanton,- rest in peace.
RIP...Ah was just watching Partly Fiction last night and remarked- There's the Last of a Certain Breed of Men.......Probably the last Hollywood veteran of WWII.
this is so saf
Harry Dean Stanton passed away today. The last movie I remember him in was The Last Stand with Arnold Schwarzenegger. We have a countless number of films he played in to remember him by. Christine, Repo Man,  Paris Texas, Dillenger, Two Lane Blacktop, Fire Down Below, and the list goes on and on. R.I.P. Mr. Stanton. You will be missed.
Safe travels Harry.
RIP Harry
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Rip
R.I.P. Harry!
RIP Harry.
Stanton died today. 15 September, 2017.
He performs it, just like the old blues legends, very great !
how much homosexy did they do in this movie?
I was watching youtube videos the other night, and got caught in the mode where you keep getting suggested videos to watch. I passed on most, but wound up watching this, as Cool Hand Luke is one of my all time favorite movies, and I've always loved Harry Dean Stanton. Kind of surreal to me that the next day after watching this, he had passed on. If you've ever compiled a list of your favorite top 10 or 20 movies, there's a pretty good chance Harry acted in one or more of those movies.
A solid actor. Multitalented. Unforgetable in any scene. Job well done Sir.

That Paul Newman didn't win the Academy Award for best actor in this movie is a joke. Paul Scofield, A Man for All Seasons was great, but Luke is an iconic film character creation.

His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
I love this man. RIP\nHarry Dean.  When I\nfeel real down, this tune sung\nand strummed by him always \nsoothes me.
Rest in peace Harry one of my heroes . Thank you
This movie was like Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. Both protagonists and stories seem like everyday scenes, the everyman trying to resist and overcome far greater and malevolent forces. Then you realise these are spiritual works of art. It isn't by chance that HDS is playing spirituals while they are trying to break Luke's spirit out there by the ditch, or here, saying goodbye to his mother. Quite a sad scene!
RIP.
Such a great movie
Rip good sir
His latest performances on showtime Sundays at 9:00 p.m.,on the return of Twin  Peaks He plays the guitar there once or twice as well
Rip Mr. Stanton
do u kiddies even realize how big a legend this movie and HDS is????
RIP
R.I.P.
Peace HDS..\n.you will be missed..
We will miss him dearly. RIP
RIP Harry Dean

RIP Harry 😪
The best version of this song I ever heard is by the chambers bros.i,ve heard hundreds of versions.the bros do a fantastic job.great !!!!!!
🌈R.I.P. 🌈🗿🎸🎤🌵🌄🙌🎪💔*
Memorable song,  part of such a great movie, as its my personal favorite and quite possibly Newman's finest hour and his personal choice i do believe ? Harry Dean Stanton and his contribution is to his credit, RIP Harry
he croaked today, rip!
Why isn't this song part of the soundtrack? did mr.stanton ever record this song?
It just creeps up on you, powerful.
I wish Harry had recorded a full version of this.
Damn that is so great.
That brother is feeling it.  I can't sing or even listen to this tune without feeling it.
Harry's version is definitely best - wish he'd done the whole thing. Try Judith Durham - seekers for one that comes close.
pure class, from writing to music to acting, simple yet so deep
Man.......this movie. I think Paul Newmans best......ever. And he made so many that were over the top.
The closest to this I can find is by Judith Durham - wish Harry had done a full version but Judith's is excellent.
:(. ..
Comes a time the bitch don't recognize the pups no more...  -Harold Dean Stanton,... Last one standing might be appropriate after witnessing the sendoff they gave Dennis. Tough Motherfuckers to be sure. I met Harry Dean in '89 at the original Hollywood Billiards-(the brick building that fell in during the Northridge quake). I'd met some people already and was on the move in L.A. Some friends that ran the original Zero Club-(Wayzatta Cameroon-Mark Boyd and brother Scotty Boyd-great man/guitarista). We showed up to HB and walking in found Harold Dean holding court in a booth and completely lit, and blathering coherently. I was introduced and realized that this was the wrong time for such 'protocol'. He said-Nice to meet you Dave and that was my first big movie star encounter in Los Angeles. You would have had to have been there. series of true and actual events in the City of Angels. This being one of the least of them. Great singer, and pure American talent-\nHarry Dean Stanton. Not since that dog put his tongue on the butter. -Greatest role ever- Missouri Breaks.
now get ain't no grave...
Just saw this movie for the first time. If I knew how good it was, I would've watched it a long time ago.
Harry Dean Stanton, genius character actor who broke through to the lead role in Paris Texas
RIP Harry Dean Stanton, One of the best actors ever.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton! \nOne of the best :(
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
Just adding my remembrance of Harry Dean Stanton in this essential clip for him from the movie we should thank him most for making, the most GenX cult film, one of the most essential films of the 1980s, and one of the best cinematic depictions of LA ever.\n\nAlways in small roles in so many '80s films that I enjoyed or remembered when I was young. Always added to those films in some way, as the late Roger Ebert noted, even if there wasn't much to add to.\n\nI was pleased to read that he actually kept at it until his death ... I hadn't seen anything with him in it since Anger Management and almost didn't recognize him there because of the makeup (but his voice was one of a kind).\n\nIf you want to see him in a more central role, to see him really show his range, I heartily recommend Paris, Texas. Long but good, from an actor's standpoint.
Damn a lot of comments. Shame people have to die for their work to be recognized......
0:16  My drive to work
A character actor who often outshined the star actors. Without Harry Dean Stanton Repo Man wouldn't be as memorable. RIP
RIP Harry Dean\nyou made this movie so great
RIP...he lived by the Actor's Code
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. You attained Legend Status. Good on you.
Cool Hand Luke  Kellys Heros any movie Harry was in was better for havin him in it . .  .RIP Harry
When I was a kid--- AKA adolescent punk wannabe in the '80s--- I wanted to be the old guy.\nI'm middle-aged now (a bad look for a punk), and I still do.\nNo character actor ever OWNED a movie like Harry Dean Stanton. Rest in peace, hangdog; see ya in the Big Parking Lot in the Sky....
Rest in peace, Harry Dean Stanton!
1:07 code , 1:43 tense situations ,
Rest in Peace, Mr. Stanton.  :*(
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. Life of a repo man is always intense.
I was in college saw this movie almost every day \nHDS-RIP
RIP Harry!
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Harry Dean Stanton was one badass actor!  Godspeed brother!
later days harry.......
Rip Mr Stanton
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Only an a$$hole gets killed for a car
R.I.P. Bud
RIP HARRY.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton \n\nProper legend
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton...
Yet, despite his disheveled appearance, you get the sense that Bud has a compassionate side to him and, deep-down, he wants to do something meaningful with his life. So he tries teaching Otto all about the repo man trade as fast as possible and, later, dies while trying to get the box. And even Otto comes around to feeling a kinship with Bud at the end by pleading with him, Only an asshole gets killed for a car! This is what makes 'Repo Man' such a great movie--the characters are interesting and you care what happens to them.
RIP HDS
Ordinary fuckin' people. I hate 'em.
RIP  Harry Dean Stanton
RIP Harry.  Your greatest role ever IMHO
RIP HDS
RIP BUD!
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
RIP HDS
RIP, Harry Dean.
Saint Harry
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
love this film, every teen should see it
1:34 Hey. Look at that. Look at those assholes over there. Ordinary fuckin' people. I hate'm.
Suddenly, Auto gets interested when his mentor mentions the consumption of speed as one of the perks to his new job!
Harry Dean Rulz
Have a nice day\nNight\nNight, day, it doesn't mean shit to me
Come on dickhead!
this film is incredible!  it's a monster mix of laughs and humor
Now humans do not have to snort the powder, they only need prescriptions from the medical industries.
Otto.. he seems to rise above his friends, who are going in the other direction, committing acts of armed robbery.. Repoman, has a code.
I could go for a couple cans of drink right about now.
Harry is such a machine.  Repo Man is a cult classic and that is great dialouge but his delivery makes it even better.
1:35 Ordinary People.....
Speed huh??
Ordinary fuckin' people - I hate 'em.
'movieclips' just for when you thought life had ripped you off enough
Tense situations, kid....
The subtitles on your clips are extremely annoying.
this movie is about farting in a market
THats asimov

Nick The pussy wetter Jonas
Nick Jonas 😍
Nick is so damn buff 😍😍😍😍😍
ripped
ARRRRRMMMMMMMMSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
como la traigas Nick 😍😍
Nick is bae
never realize hes so jacked
Wish I could change places with the host!!!, minus the audience  :-)
I just...😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Nick is so delicious..yum..
Why do they always do that weird thing at the start when there like yeah hi but I'm not going to saying anything funny until everyone is quite.......
Things you gotta do to promote your SONG!!
is he playing in a movie or does he just want to get huge ?
Nick Jonas stole my heart when I was only 14 and still does the same <3 :)
Saw him live last year...it was amazing!
The way he cleaned that pastry...
he's hot but I miss the slimmer version of him, beautifully perfect now he's a bit chunky... well hot anyways
The great guitar master xD
Oh how I wish he was an intern at my firm...
The reason he's so damn buff is probably because he played an MMA fighter in the TV show Kingdom. He's seriously ripped in the show. Its actually a decent show-turns out the kid can act and very well actually. Unfortunately it only has 3 seasons but its still worth watching.
His voice 😍😍
Nick 😍💖
❤❤❤
The funny seeing Nick Jonas giving James amassage
Lol James 😂
Nick seni yerim kfmfkd
BUFF!!!!
HE'S DEFINITELY THE HOT ONE OUT OF THE OTHER BROS.
He so sexy! Getting Marky Mark vibes. 😘
Now I have masseuse fantasies. Massage kink is the best kink.
Damn nick is THIC C squared
Goodness gracious gravy, he's so gorgeous
James is me 😂😂😂
I think I need a massage too…… where's my NICK JONAS?
This is totally FAKE! He was all mic-ed up 😏
Even Nick Jonas forgets he was once an actor
I need massage too.
Nick is so amazing!!!👍👍👍😂😂
LOL he is so jacked!
BITCH HIS ARMS!!!
Funny, I love Nicholson's expression on the sour note.
lol they sing drunk
that is a tribute to the everly brothers - everybody knows and loves that song......
a few scorched notes but so nice; I used to know Dean.
Harry Dean Stanton the best
What happened to Hollywood?   lol
nice, bob dylan in the background chewing some gum.
I love this!
God bless Phil Everly and what a beautiful way to remember him - except playing the original records, of course...
Priceless! 
Something about this video was weird and off... Especially in the beginning.
Your nose looks huge when you highlight it like you do. It doesn't look natural..
This look just makes your brown eyes pop😍 Love this look babe! You should give the Too Faced loose powder a try, I actually like it better than my Laura mercier now ..
You are sweet and very talented, but I will not get close to Benefit as the brand is promoting that other person...
I was looking through the comments in the beginning saying too much blush and was thinking dang sis couldn't have made it that bad but when I got to that part.... it's bad :(
Girl that stone on your thooth tho... Sooo weird. Hope that trend never comes back.
Glad y'all are safe 🙏💞
Missed watching your videos! Literally what I look forward too every time I see your gna post a video ♥️♥️♥️ we love you!!!
Love this look! Glad you're safe from storm.
Happy to hear that you guys are safe! It's crazy how badly it affected some people! Donations are definitely a good idea. Also, miss your vlogs so much!!!!
Nicole could make a video of her farting and it would get over 300,000 views! Lol 🙌🏼 love you Nicole

I absolutely love you and think you're gorgeous. This look is beautiful, but I think maybe you used a bit too much shape tape. You looked very white on the center of your face and it made the rest of your face look quite yellow. Again, I think it's beautiful! XOXO
I was stuck in Tampa and I was pretty scared. We got a hole in our roof too. Aghhhh but I'm so glad you're safe!

When you tryin to clean and listen to Nicole's video and you hear 'tooth paste' instead of 'too faced' And you are confused as hell. You know its time to just focus on one thing at a time. Sorry room I will have to vacuum you later. Priorities.😂👍

Yesss Halloween videossss! Girl! Hold onnnnn I've been growing my eyebrows out for about a year and a half and I know it's hard but it was a working progress that was worth it. I would just clean them up by threading them but wouldn't shape them or anything. It was worth it trust me!

My favorite month to watch you 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃😆😆😆😆
96% of Pinellas County (Clearwater/St Pete) has power back now, a week later. Unfortunately ours is still out but we do feel grateful that's the worst of it for us. My thoughts and prayers are with those who were more severely impacted, especially in the countries that don't have the same resources as a lot of Americans do. One love ❤️❤️
1st ! Love You and I'm so Happy You and Your family are doing Better and are safe ❤️❤️\nAlso when did she dyed her hair dark ?? Lol.
Nicole there is no way of getting a hold of you lol .. .y friend and I are desperate looking for more of your highlight pallets where in the world can we find it lol please please let me know
I love you Nicole
I'm sorry I thought that was Tessa brooks 😶
Thank you Nicole for mentioning the hurricane and asking people to donate. I live in Tampa as well and I'm pretty irritated that other youtubers especially a certain one who also lives in Tampa(first name starts with a J last name starts with an H)  hasn't used her platform to help others. Thanks again!
I toldy understand the whole growing out the eyebrows  but damn I would've plucked a looooong time ago ! Lol. I give you props for not doing it. Glad y'all were safe from Irma. And you SLAYED this look
I live for your Halloween vids! I can't wait!!! 👿🎃

But we made it thru cause that's  Floridians do! Glad you yours made it thru. I AM SOOO EXCITED FOR YOUR HALLOWEEN LOOKS. During Irma I watched previous years on my phone to get me thru.

I'm probably tripping because I swear I saw Tessa brooks on your thumbnail

Ok devs, make a horror game about dan explorin the park
I'd really like to know, did you report those bones and their location to the police?
Ah good old Baltimore. I miss Maryland forests and gang violence
I suggest you look at the footage from 25:17 to 25:20, there is white orb or shadow that goes by the camera.
It does sound like gun fire. The fact that there are cop,fire dept and a ambulance. The place is closed off.
Did anyone else notice the orbs or spiritual energy surrounding him when he was standing in the dark on either the road or path(couldn't tell) He mentioned his arm got really cold.   I was screaming run! To my tv screen lol.  Ahhh.  I don't think he could of seen until he watched his footage.   Creepy!  be safe !
All I keep thinking is , shit I really hope they got a fuckin gun on them being out there like that.................
I used to walk home from work, at night, in the ghetto, every night, for 2 years. Still not as scary as being in the woods at night.
I just saw two eyes, I hope that was a deer.\n\n*The most Jarring thing I've heard in a long time*.
I think downtown Detroit is the scariest place in America. But when that gunfire went off, I didn't even think about it.  Where I live, there's gunfire every couple seconds all around
Welcome to the gun free zone of Baltimore.  That is unless your a criminal.  I certainly hope this guy is carrying.\n  I could never understand why any sane person would want to live in a Hell hole like that.
This reminded me of that movie nightcrawler
Note to self... Do not move to Baltimore. O-o
Great vid as always! But still nothing touches the crack rocks in the abandoned house or the person following you around the kids asylum! Omfg those still freak me out when i rewatch them!
Creepy as hell. Subbed. Would sub a thousand times. Clone me.
so those bones look odd. i would have called the cops.  only becuase catherine hoggle is back in the news and they never found her two kids.
What's in the bag? What's in the bag?
Damn! This is the creepiest thing I've ever watched! Cool video, though!
Should rename this, Dan driving around in the dark finds dead cat.
You guys gotta turn up the ISO every now and then.
25:48-25:52 that sounded like a man humming or singing??? \nGreat video btw! *applauses!*
Anyone been able to recognize what those bones belonged too?\nAnimal? Human?
I remember listening to the serial podcast about hae min lee and hearing about this park. It's nice to get a more visual idea of what it looked like and some info on the place as well. Great vid as always! I got pretty spooked at various parts lol
33:48 I respect what police have to deal with, but to make the person who found it open the bag?  Um, whose the one with the badge who actually trained for that crap again?
i'm from chitown and baltimore scares me
Its suprising how there aren't tons of homeless people in the woods
You gotta have balls of steel walking around in the woods at night like that. Even if the road is right there close by its still creepy as fuck lol
I like how everyone's like oh it's just a cat. XD
Infrared or thermal camera would have been great.
Plot Twist : The cop dumped that bag there.....
What's in the bag? WHAT'S IN THE BAAAAAAGGGG?
When I first moved to the Baltimore area, I lived for 6 months with a buddy about 1 1/2 miles from here. I took safe roads, avoided some areas, and hated it. Glad to not live around there anymore. Baltimore is a pretty gnarly place.\n\n30:46 Clearly another bag in the forested area just behind the trees. Go get it.
Props to this guy for being out there while I watch from the comfort of my bed
roughly about 27:00 before/after. summer foliage and crickets/cicadas yet he is putting out breath vapor because its so cold.
Be Advised!!! There is a $500.00 fine for dumping a body!!!  I hope this serves as a deterrent??!!!!!!😳
I'VE BECOME SO NUMB
Nice vid Dan, but like everyone else says, BE CAREFUL> dont travel alone brother. Esp. in murder park!! Getting subscribers to your channel aint worth dying over.Seriously.That was creepy as heck :O
This is where hae min Lee was found
>mfw I live like 1 minute away from Woodlawn highschool
Dan, love your videos, but geez, buy a gun and get a CCW permit so you can at least protect yourself.
These videos you do are so truly authentic and gripping. I felt like I was walking around in a real life blare witch project... Also what the fuck is up with the North Eastern United States and being generally terrifying.
This place is not scary to me, it's a beautiful place where people just so have happened to die.
Did anyone else notice that there was another trash bag at 30:45?
Walking in that forest at night reminded so much of The Blair Witch Project. Especially because it took place in Burkittsville  MD.
That was RIVETING  stuff, the film quality was so good my mind now thinks I've been in Leakin park!!
Would it be this is Dan bell or this is this is Dan bell?  Lol
I live in the area. I had no idea this place existed. I have a shop in Bmore county. This is crazy
It just sounded like any shooting range
Definitely handguns and at least 9mm or .40 cal.
Dan, I don't know you but I still care. Please don't go into places like this alone... What if you were there and someone came to drop off a body? They see you and so you don't squeal, they kill you, take the camera, delete the footage, and pawn it. Please be careful... Lol what if you fainted or had a heart attack resulting from the shear terror you were feeling? Who would go and get help? \nYour videos are always amazing but they aren't worth risking your own safety so recklessly. What happened to your friend in the beginning? Why didn't he return with you at 1:30 am and the trips following that?
Baltimore: There's more than murder here!
Oh bloody hell stop nudging it with your foot and just open the damn bag already 😂
They were rockin out with the chops out
Part of those bones looked like a fraction of a human skull
This is a Global Tel Link collect call from... Adnan Syed
Gun fight was probably white folks.
Did you know :If we each donated just $1 Dan Bell and his crew would be set for quite some time? That's almost $360,000!
This is the same park that was featured in Serial season one correct?
This freaked me out. People don't seem very friendly in Baltimore including the police.
The dan witch project
Dan I love your work I missed these vids
Rick was like my reassuring guide in the first scene. Then for all the solo night scenes I was waiting for him to jump scare me from behind a tree or something.
Who dafuq carries around a bag of children's severed genitals? That's some serious fukt up shit!
I caught myself holding my breath several times during this video.  Holy crap, dude.  Intense stuff.
You look so happy in your profile picture that is makes me happy.
Thanks for this. From 2009 to 2011 this was my post (821) and we were finding bodies every few months. During the blizzard of 09' we even had a body dumped on snow bank on Eagle Dr. near the Outward Bound parking lot. It's strange driving through knowing that there are remains somewhere, and sad knowing people have missing loved ones that may never be found.
Absolutely nothing happened in this video, yet you managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. Great filming and editing.
Your videos are among the top 5 channels on YouTube for me. I hope you never stop the dead mall series as they are the best YouTube documentaries I've ever seen. Look forward to the next one. Hope you get a chance to do some Southern California dead malls or even a full fledge documentary for Netflix or something. Anyways just great film for all your videos to come no matter what they are about
Dan this is a scary video...I almost pooged my pants.....we'll maybe just a brown streek.
don't you just hate it when you go for a walk in the woods and then you fucking die
I don't like Leakin Park.  I find their particular style of rock and roll to be banal...\n\nEr... Wait...
Not much to expect you go to a place look people and surroundings and you will know what to expect from them and any place is like what you see is what you get
I thought the title was a parody of Linkin Park
Are those bones animal or human? It was creepy that there was a boot right next to the bones, and forensics specialists here to answer this question
Theoretically, if you would play back this recording, and something was on the recording you could hear that you didn't hear when it was actually being recorded. That's electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.\n\nInto the garbage it goes.
It's just people out blasting no big deal. Prolly not a gun fight.
Probably a dead Pit bull. Dog fighting is pretty common in that area.
5:16 A Carcass?😂
Welcome to Baltimore!
Great vlog
Geez Baltimore looks awful...
Actual video starts at 1:13
Visit Clinton road next
LETS DO SOME EVPs MOTHERFUCKER

Excellent
**Twin Peaks theme song plays**
this isn't creepy it's just the ghetto
remind me as my hubs and I start our journeys across the state's to never go here.  So horribly terrifying.  thanks for scarring the piss ants away from me. I hope you all were packing.  safety before film's.  blessings to y'all
linkin park?
Clarksville, TN?\nThis city is so small, how have I not met these people or at least seen them?
my snakes name is jade lol
Would Howie Mandel survive in that box with the germaphobe one?  Bc he only gives fist Bumps, but- one Americas got talent he held the guys phone with no problem. Like... a cell phone is one of the dirtiest things. Way worse than shaking someone's hand
Seems like such a technique would work because it almost encourages a dissociative state that could become a disorder for some people. Seems dangerous, if undeniably effective.
The word link sounds weird now.  Lol
Make a challenge where Rhett loses he has to shave his beard
Your heart rate drops when you talk period because you are temporarily holding your breathe. You don't have to refer to yourself in third-person you just have to talk and your heart rate will drop until you stop talking to yourself and start breathing normally again.
My current heart rate is 63bpm
Link sounds like Dobby when Dobby talks about Dobby's love for Harry Potter
😂 the intros on these are so weird I LOVE THEM
What was in that diaper
I feel like it works just because it would be a good distraction. And the talking could help regulate your breathing better.
I used this technique at school the other day, it really does work wonders. :)
I HAVENT BEEN WATCHING SO LONNGGGGGGG, IVE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR 2 YEARS!!!!!! D,: missed you guys so much!!
this is not a valid experiment, where is the control group?
Who else loves snakes and would love to be where link is
Best Episode! Love it!
How to relieve stress: Induce an early onset of insanity.
Chase Wears The Same Socks As Me!
I talk to my self all the time with ideos oh and for my xhannel lol
Link: 7:53\nOh my crab!\nWhat the crab!\nWhat iszz thab!\n\n10:10\nWhat is that?\nWhatthepthepyhepthepidath?\n\n😂😂😂
Oh I talked to myself in third person all the time to tell myself off haha
I would try to swim
< this guy thinks if snake kissed link then link would have give link a heart attack.
Okay I'm officially mad at YouTube, it said that I was unsubscribed from GMM and a few diy channels .
You can do it serpent king
Figure many sound drug naturally attribute value watch.
I feel like Link is a constant victim and that Rhett and the entire crew are in on it but Link's simple innocence makes him want to go along like a little brother who wants to fit in.
you might be calm but everyone will think your crazy
NOPE!  \n\nNOPE! NOPE! NOPE! my skin was crawling as soon as i heard snake
All hail the serpent king.
I find snakes are beautiful creatures of nature, sure there are poisonous snakes, but hey!
I talk to myself anytime I'm on a roller coaster 😂😂
it really works i tried it when the hospital wouldnt call my family when i was freaking out over a test they made me have it was the only way i could calm down maybe just in my head but it worked for me i still wasnt happy but i got through it
Serpent King was SO brave!
Did I just get rick rolled
If you eat raw termites they taste like pineapples
Honestly I didn't enjoy seeing Link nearly scared to tears for my viewing pleasure :(
well, we definitely know Link wasn't faking any of his emotions
They continue to get a little bit more inappropriate every episode
Combining Pig and Anus into Panus was a mistake
I feel so bad for Link! Poor Link... :(
So thats I start talking in 3rd person randomly when I'm frustrated? Huh. Cool it was like built in.
I always talk to myself in third person haha - I thought I was crazy
I would have been better to see the live recording of his heartbeat...
not sure if i just got rick rolled or not
The word Link has officially lost its meaning for me
I am the captain now\n\n\n\n\n\n#StudioC
That singing of the games name was amazing.
Woah I need to try talking to myself as a third person whwn I stress
#QTMBA I would go into an upside down room, and continue my life, on the roof of an upside down room.
did you guys know about the picture next to the electric guitar it changes all the time
What do they use for the heart rate monitor? I want one for my YouTube videos
I would be inside a building with a roof. So wouldn't float very high.
*link can breathe through his a n u s*
Link is happy there was only one snake
This is one of my favorite episodes now. 😂😂😂
Mythical beasts, help us go viral to pay for Hurricane damage https://youtu.be/uc6MMTuMeac
I like how Link was scared of Rhett's hand 😂
I talk to myself A LOT and im also a very stressful person, so everything makes sense now. 
YOU CAN DO IT SERPENT KING! YOU CAN DO IT SERPENT KING!🐍👑

Adam, you broke my heart when you said Legos :-(
now see I want this... but my wallet doesn't
What the hell is an aluminium falcon?
Imagine if your friends drop it
They really didn't put seats in the cockpit?? The one single location in the ship that unquestionably has the most screentime... and they didn't bother to furnish it, or make it large enough to hold the seated figures properly? For $800. Maybe in another ten years they'll figure that part out; I'll just hold my breath until then.
just think of all the interesting conversations you had!
You can kinda tell that Norm is a straight up AFOL, the others are just cool, Lego! (Besides the Bricknerd guy)
Who here hates the fact that they took all the bags, took all the pieces out and then sorted it, not just going by the bags, and tore up the instructions
What a piece of junk! - Luke Skywalker\n\nThat is the most beautiful LEGO set I've ever seen. What an awesome team build, how long would a solo build take...
How did you get this early
Nice .  but what piss me off a person like me could NEVER HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. Im a working man ...sometime it make sick only rich people can have stuff like that
Old one looks better imo
Cool
Tons of minifigs. Really?
intellectualizing legos ok why not
Not decals; stickers
How many are going to be made
One of my coworkers is planning to buy it. I guess he will have a lot of fun building this little wonder ^^
Like every other set,it's a box of plastic bricks.
Kishore we have the same name! And I am kisure about that haha
Missed opportunity for a epic quote at 10:53
Please start putting where everyone in the video got their graphic T's from as they all have great taste.
Next to the Lego porsche 911, this is one of my favorite sets. It's so detailed
wanted the old one since a child...
How does lego design these as in how would the blocks go to build it
So how long does it take to build if your alone :OOOO
Is it in true scale to the LEGO figures? (haven't seen the video yet)
Oh, my goodness. It was a sudden release. How do they sell like this? When is the next official release date? I've known it is Oct. 1`.
12 hours for 6 people. I can only imagine how long it would take for 1. I feel like im watching a review of a sports car. Wish I had it but no way can I afford it
I was half anticipating them to throw it against the wall once they finished
if you cant play with it i aint gonna buy it, same rule for cosplay. Display pieces are nice but i am not wasting that amount of money for it to sit on a shelf
this box set is madness
At least the right size to the figures :)
Will swap kidney for this Lego set or sell my soul...
That's not proper Lego, just a slot together kit!
We have no idea what's inside this box\nYes you do, Norm, stop being so dramatic.
So cool to see that Adam and Grant are the only two who survived the Mythbusters breakup and now have a youtube channel together! Thumbs up!
I would set it on a shelf with the panels on half of the ship to appear to be peeling back by hanging them on fishing string
I WANT THAT THING SOOOOOO BADLY\n GOSH WHY IS IT 800DOLLARS ARGH
A lovely set guys, here in New Zealand we pay $1500NZD which bites.
They wasted half their time to knolling. Good to know.
I like the new one except its cockpit which looks odd and out of place
i built this set in 7 hours
I can't stand what's he's name....
For Christmas what should I get this or the Death Star
I'd just like to say I noticed and appreciated the camera motion during the time lapse
As a guy who's not into Lego, but really into the falcon, I can say that the old one has a much better shape. The new one is way too flat and the cockpit and radar dish look too small.\n\n\nNow Adam, it is time to build and review the bandai perfect grade falcon!!!!
Wow, great video!  Any estimates on how long it would take one or two people to build this?
800 smackers. might take a month to build so it's great intertainment.  Sucks you can't pick it up
Adam shouldn't throw the box and stickers around like they're worthless
Where would you even put something like that? its too big for a shelf
Death to Chihuahua’s!!!
These are over $1000 on Ebay Australia lol. At first I was like looks meh as I'm not a huge fan of Lego but this was pretty amazing. What really stands out to me is how stringent Lego's quality control must be to get every single piece into this set (maybe they ship spare pieces in it?). But damn that was crazy!
Why are you wearing a hat indoors?

When he said tons of minifigs 😂
Lego produced 20,000 sets, twice as many as 10179's 10,000. 75192 has sold out Lego's entire worldwide stock on 14th September's first day of launch just to VIP members only😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
the guy in the pong shirt. i swear, he looks like Alex Lifeson
The old one is better.\nThey just want to sell lego
Just wait for Lepin to make their knockoff and get it for $200 instead lol
So, it's was a 12 hour build. \nBut with the variable number of builders, how many man-hours were spent?
So ladies....are these guys making you hot and horny!!!
wasnt the original one 400 hundred dollars?
I got the $120 Falcon.😐
WOW! Simply INSANE but I LOVE IT! Thank you so much for this video! Well done! Again, WOW!

I built that when I was in 4th grade haha
The sad part about this set is that it's $800! Gotta start saving
I love this channel so much.
Ordered this and Slave 1
I can't wait to modify this one! \nFinish the interior.
i can do it in less then  10 hours
Great now I have to sell my car to be able to afford it
Ugh...why did they decorate the white boxes? I'm going to have to hold on to those too...

If this is a newer Falcon, shouldn't it have the rectangular radar dish that it featured in The Force Awakens?  (I realize that the photo on the box depicts it flying through the skies of Bespin, however that model doesn't differ much - if at all - from it's predecessor featured on the table next to the build.)
$900 Woooow.
norm is a lego weapon

RLmqKBRqyA8,didn't move

Natural hair, short hair, long hair, dyed hair, hubby in video or out of video.. who cares all theses yrs of great content 👌🏾keep it up, your a stunner & your family is lush, stay blessed 🙏🏽
Sam ❤❤❤❤ you're the sweetest we could gush on here for ages 😂 let's make the meet up happen xxx
WE MISS JASON!!!! i miss him cooking, and talking , and living. come back!!
Jason kinda dancing behind you in the background made my day 😂
okay a lot of you must not pay attention to her videos she's answered so many questions like more than once before... love ya sammi and also just chill about jason we only see a snippet of sam's life
You should get edge control to really get your hair to match, it'll look neater. Why Yana ain't taught you that yet?
Jason reminds me so much of Kit Harrington!
I thought it Sammi was wearing those pink converses to the dinner lol I was so confused!!
Poor woman. Black men have bigger dicks. You should try them
I've recently switched to decaf and it's done wonders for my stress/anxiety levels. Good luck!
Am I the only one who thinks Jason has the same voice as Jon Snow???!!! Lol... lucky you, love you Sam 😘
Fenty Beauty is making everyone so damn flawless, I literally have to get it when I get payed, gorg sammi!
U are really queen of the vlogs!! Moment with pink converse on escalators or girl eating from the box while she was waiting on metro...perfect moments;)
When you said I can't be bothered to do it about your hair, it reminded me of the Spice Girls movie when they showed the future scene of them all with children and I forget which girl said it but it reminded me of that scene!! Love you Sam <3
Definitely think about cutting back on the coffee. I've had to do the same because as much as i love coffee it just isn't loving me back
YOUR SUCH A GREAT MOM BE BLESSED!!!
Jason really needs to blog more 😫
nearly died when i saw u mention barbara love love love when u support other women!
Your vlogs are so relaxing! I've watched this like 4 times, lol
Hi Sammi, I'm sure you probably won't see this as I'm late to watch your vlog but I just wanted to thank you. I lost my baby a few days ago but while I was pregnant watching your videos and hearing you be so honest about the raw emotions you went through in pregnancy and still go through now in motherhood has been really refreshing and helpful for me as I suffered from depression and anxiety most my adult life, but you helped. So yeah.
We have not seen the banana bread
Is almost every comment a girl plz don't hate me if u offended
I've kinda missed Jason. Why isnt he in the vlogs anymore?
Your family is adorable, really enjoying these vlogs - love seeing Jason in the vlogs too! 💖
I cut out coffee from time to time and it helps me with my anxiety. So it most definitely could be a link. Maybe switch to decaf if you need your fix. It does help...do try it lovely xxx
I can't wait to see the bag!!!!
Aww Sam you're a great mom \nLove your little family
Be careful out there Sammi! I always think of you anytime I hear about the awful events in London, especially in the subways 💜
That salad actually looks and sounds amazing to me!!
Does anybody know where Sammi's pink jumper is from? Not too sure if she mentioned it or not...? xxx
I would 100% recommend quitting coffee. I had really bad anxiety for years and was advised to give up and now my anxiety is so rare I can't even remember the last time I felt anxious. I know it's  brutal having  a baby with no coffee but I will take exhaustion over anxiety mixed with caffeine and exhaustion any day! hope it helps xxx
Honestly Sammi, I find it all the time that I have a bit more coffee than usual or than I need and bam... my anxiety hits me like a ton of bricks. Just the wrong amount of it builds it up so much for me, so cutting down will hopefully help any anxiety you have!
I gave up reg coffee years ago cuz I got bad anxiety. I drink decaf when I do drink coffee and I like it! Doesn't make me anxious. Also I looooove this tea by celestial it's called TENSION TEA. I'm not sure if they sell it in the UK but if they do it helps loads! It's for headaches but it's so calming. When I'm feeling anxious it calms me down. It's a life saver! I even keep a few in a ziplock bag in my purse in case I'm out and about and I feel anxious.
I think that people would like to see u editing/working/filming etc. because thats motivate us to work and set our goals hahahahah  ❤️  We like see your normal part of the day doing boring stuff and in this way I don't feel depressed for my everyday boring life too hahah
Hmm I think your jumper was upside down 🤔😂
i laughed out loud. thanks for sharing your personality with us -- it's really a joy.
Where is that pink chunky sweater that you were wearing in the beginning of this vlog from? The one that people were saying you were wearing inside out..
Coffee defiantly personally does effect my anxiety I'm not a very anxious person or one that has trouble with anxiety regularly but it kind of just comes in waves and coffee kinda helps it come up personally
How do you cook with nice clothes on? I would get 10 stains by just walking in the kitchen.
Jumpers on backwards in the dining room clip 😂
Love your outfit for the dinner! Your hair pulled back looks so nice!
Is that the Skip Hop high chair? Do you recommend it?
I also realized that cofee make me anxious
So cool seeing you as a mom and wife. You make it look easy💕💕
Great video as always. Yours are my favourite to watch. I love Jason's dancing at 5:25 😂
inspired to bake! also love the BTS of you filming. such a pretty makeup look :) \nyou're totally right about how exercise like filming! just gotta do it and you never regret it
Your living room is a dream come true.
Where are your curtains from the pink ones ? 😍😍😍❤️
Where is the rug in your office from? Been looking for one just like that for ages! Xxx
you and barbara should totally do a collab! i've been waiting for a video of you two together for years! ♥
well I'm even more of a coffee addict than you and I've noticed that even when I have minimal amounts I still feel very ancious and drained. So I guess it depends
I also think that coffee makes anxiety worse because it releases adrenalin in your body so you're going to feel even more nervous... I'm currently cutting it down also, and drinking green tea instead which makes the transition soooo much easier
Didi anyone else at the beginning of the video hear It's cheeseday? :'D
I just love your vlogs. I don't even mind watching you make a salad. Indie is such a playful & intelligent baby. I love her smile, one can tell that she is loved very much! I can't wait until she starts talking. Thanks Sam for showing us more of your life. Yes, caffeine is very bad for anxiety. I've had years of struggle with anxiety. I also believe that making sure we eat enough and not skip meals is important too. Do they have decaffeinated coffee in England? We have it here in the States & it helps me to drink that. There still is a tiny amount of caffeine in decaffeinated coffee but, it's very low. You look so happy! \nLove,\nDebbie 💋
I need to make that banana bread sounds really good <3  Hope all is well lovely - really enjoy these vids I watch the while my little one naps and they always chill me out :) xx
This was the best vlog so far :D Keep it going girl :*
Hi Samantha, is your Missoma initial necklace the small one? And did you go with the Missoma chain?
... And I thought that I was crazy because coffee makes me feel anxious too 😳
Jason and you are so adorable together 😍❤️ I hope to find somebody who makes me laugh like he does with you Sammy ✨
I don't know why but I love seeing you tubers make coffee. I like to see what different kinds of ideas they have. So I love coffee talk!
As soon as I watched this I made vegan banana bread haha! Thanks for the suggestion xx
Now I can't wait to see that Maje bag😍
I have a spot on my nose too, I feel your pain 😭😂😘
Can you do a full house tour?
Are you renting or did you buy your house? Love the vlogs as always! xx
I had the same reaction with coffee, I started drinking it everyday in college and my anxiety was horrible. I thought it was stress from school that was making me feel not like myself but after I stopped caffeine I felt much better. Also it stains teeth and gives you heartburn lol
You looked so gorgeous with your hair pulled back and with the red lipstick <3
Sam: Please excuse my appearance  but she looks gorgeous😩❤️😍😍😍😍
Less coffee more MAGNESIUM. Best thing for anxiety EVERRR
Coffee definitely makes my anxiety worse I cut out all caffeine for a while and it made a massive difference :)
the face indie did wenn she found you behind the sofa 😍
I am always really loving your videos. It's as if ur my friend or something and you give positive energy. Love that! And btw, the house is looking awesome!
Am I the only one who thinks Jason sounds and looks slightly like Jon Snow King in the North? Also he would make a good actor in GOT...
Just have to say.... ur the only person I watch that is real!! Who doesnt come across as self obsessed like so many others!! Just normal!! So funny and naturally pretty! Definitely my number 1 to watch!! 😘😘😘😘
Hey Sam I became a Barista about two years ago and started drink loads of coffee and with time noticed how it changed my mood so much started giving me anxiety and mind you your personality is just like mine so bubbly, fun, always smiling and after drinking so much coffee I noticed I always felt so down. So I cut down a lot I'll have one once a week and I feel so normal again it's hard to explain but definitely try it. And I know at times I'm like what is life without coffee lol but you'll be find love you Sam!!!
indie is too cute x
Yes Sammi and Barbara, my og favourites xxxx
Loved this vlog and loved seeing the family together, it's a shame people keeping being so rude to Jason in the comments. Let the man live people
btw i started watching the handmaid's tale on your recommendation and omg it was so good!! haven't been that into a series in quite a while. thank you!!
Try decafe coffee just as nice☕️☕️
Barbaraaa 💘
Vegan, yes!
Lovely table!
<3
i love love loveeee your tattooed arm !!! it looks so freaking cool , cool mummy
❤️❤️❤️
Jason reminds me of Kit Harrington lol.
Love watching Indie.. she is adorable😘
I miss Jason in the vlogs! Came back to us Jason :P
Jason !!!! Thank you so much for saying hi to us. Do you know we all missed your chats in Sam's video.  Good to hear and see your dancing behind the scene. Sam nothing is boring...daily videos are my fav and i enjoy very much...heee..yea cant wait to see the make up video and the items you bought. Falling in love with Indie everytime we watch her growing....she is the center of attraction. Will love a home tour video when you are ready....😊
Always love seeing Jason! And I've been wanting to make banana bread for ages!!! Think I'm gonna do it tomorrow...
Jason having a moan about Sam's mum being late 🙄🙄🙄 Here's an idea - look after your own kid you slack shit, since you do nothing all day???!
where are all you friends you used to be so social in your old videos before you got with jason and now you do everything on your own
I know you're probably super busy already but if you could put links to outfits in vlogs i would love you forever! i need me that blush jumper in the beginning girl! Aside from that thanks for always being entertaining.. your family makes my heart happy <3 x
Just love your fenty make up it looks so glowy and natural love you!!
You always look so amazing!
Why does Jason act dickish in the vlogs?
Is her fenty beauty vid up yet xx
i wish jason would talk more on the vlogs :( why not make it a family vlog channel?
Jason 😍 Loving vlogtember Sammi 😘

If there were to ever be a Conan bio pic, Joel Edgerton has to play him
he should play the joker next
Creepy lookin ass mothafucka gooooodaaaamn, I see why he got the part
JOIN MY CLASH ROYAL CLAN ITS CALLED tHeUnDeRdOgS
I need tp for my bunghole
He did such a great job with Pennywise. I am so happy that IT was amazing.
He looks like a handsome serial killer, he has that look.
So many turned on women...
was really expecting hardwick to chime in there with a you mean like cornholio?.
When you want to see It so bad but you can't cause you're only 17
Seeing that face he makes gives me flashbacks already. Brrruuuuuuuuuhhhhhh
Watch out for coulrophilia girls in the comments🤡
Floki and it are brothers
If you like this comment and subscribe to my channel I will subscribe to yours!
wait can I do it?...\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm auditioning for it 2.0
Be honest, when bill did his lips like IT yall did it along with him or at least tried to and realized you can't and that you look stupid🙋🏽
I've always been able to do that same smile lmfao
How to make wireless earphonehttps://youtu.be/gNWHZAcRGRw
Steve buscemi and Kevin bacon that's what I see in him!
How would you spell that Swedish name? Jodigan or like Jordigen?
He sits just like his father
Any OG fans of Alex aka Roman from hemlock grove
Can we have a movie about Görgen?
All the people tried doing the smile...and those smiles are floating, 😄😄😄 smile to float too
He wasn't that scary as pennywise
when i first saw you in the drain i jumped up
He reminds me of a real life version of Victor from Corpse Bridge in this clip lol.
This guy looks so much like SS-Sturmbannführer Dieter Hellstrom in Inglourious Basterds
He is so hot
Lmao while watching the movie I was like ‘Pennywise is lowkey hot’ and now I see that it’s Bill playing him. Go figure. 😫
i can do Bill's smile
I'm just here to be comforted by the behind the scenes of the actor who played penny wise after watching IT
Sub to me and I'll sub back, comment done when complete
If you float you will too 👵🏼🎈
I want to see his audition tape, acting as Pennywise without the clown face.
Its funny that he was born in 1990, the date that it was premiered
Him and his brother are so gorgeous
Can we get this dude to play The Joker?
its alot scarier when he has the pennywise makeup
Pause at 0:53 thank me later \n:) I love the hotty
🎈🎈🎈🎈 you'll float to🎈🎈🎈
Why is he so bomb
Just waiting for season 2 of Hemlock Grove on Netflix with this beautiful man monster!
That smile makes me \n\n\n\n\n*hard*
Now i always think there's a clown behind me
The Skarsgårds are awesome. Stellan is a legend. I love Gustaf as Floki and most of Alexander's work is great too aside from Tarzan lol.
Sub to me and ill Sub Back
I wonder if when he scared his little brother he did the pennywise head-face-wiggle thingy when he chased him?
How can a hot dude like him be so scary
I feel very happy that the actor is super charming and attractive. Makes me feel like I might be able to sit through the movie if I refer to that lol.
Reminds me of the miz from wwe 😂
I'm so attracted to his voice my god
Never want to see that again
Every decision you've ever made in your life has lead you to reading this comment.
Who else wants to see a tape of Bill chasing his sibling with the t-shirt around his head
what the hell was chris hardwick doing there lol?! xD
Cast this man as carnage right now!!!!!
His smile is more creepy without all that makeup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
after watching IT  i just cant go to McDonalds anymore

Do you like any foundations?! Lol
You look like a female version of Ronnie from Falling in reverse
What foundations do you recommend for really dry skin? I have dry patches on my cheeks😞😞😞
Please do a review of the glossier foundation!
I was on Sephora looking at UFO Sunday Riley Oil because I had gotten a sample and liked it.  The video suggested to mix a bit with your foundation for those with acne. Ever tried U.F.O products?
Do you think you could start including a drugstore foundation or two in the comparison swatches? Just for people who stick to drugstore makeup. Back when you included Maybelline Matte + Poreless in 110 it was useful. Revlon Colorstay in Buff would also be a good comparison that lots of people know. Thanks, loved this round of 15 shades of foundation!
I'm new! Saw you on trending! Will definitely watch the rest of this series
Can't wait for the wrap up video now that 15DOF is over. Not going to lie. I'll probably buy whatever your top 2 are 😂❤❤ #snapchatfam
I can totally hear the sponge pats on your face this time, it's highly amusing XD
Taylor, I've noticed that when you do your swatches you pause for a couple extra seconds at the end-- and I LOVE THAT!! Thank you for doing that!! It gives me that extra second to look and compare! 👍🏻 I love FDOF but holy shitzees, I can't wait for a shadow and shmooze!! 🌯💙 #baerittos #snapchatfam
You look ill with all the make-up
Please try marcelle makeup! There's not many reviews on it and I really love the brand for the most part!
Please do a review on... \nCLINIQUE Even Better™ Glow Light Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum SPF 15
Found you through the series and definitely gonna stick around ! :) :)
what are you 5 top/favorite foundations? Thank you
Where's the wrap up video? I need to know what I need to go buy!!
I watch so much Taylor that when I got a sample of the FAB intense hydration cream I was like oh perfect ill put it on the dry patch on my forehead a started to and then realized that I dont have a dry patch on my forehead?????? whoops
So depressed that you won't be making my day better everyday😭😭
This foundation has looked terrible  in many of the reviews I have watched. I will definitely be passing on this one.
So sad it's over!!!
I tried the burts bees bb cream and it was awful. It made my skin look terrible and it had a heavy floral scent, I think all burts bees products have some sort of scent to them which is kind of annoying.
Whoah, nice, this video is trending!  I'm so happy your channel is really taking off!  Yaaaay!  Also, thank you for another super awesome !5 days of foundation.  Looked forward to every single video and loved them all.  Thank you, thataylaa!
Have you tried the Dior Forever Perfect Makeup Fluid Floundation?
GIRL YOU MADE IT TO TRENDING!!!!! CONGRATULATIONSSSS! Btw love 15DOF!!!
I have never bought a Burts Bees product. Ty
The best one IMO opinion was the Two Faced comfort matte foundation it looked super smooth and nice, and I'm going to pick it up!!!
I don't want it to be over 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🌯🌯🌯🌯🌯
Hey! 💕
@thataylaa do a review on matchco pls
Hey
#48 on trending! You go girl!! ❤️
Heyyyy
#45 on trending!!! AHHHHH💓💓
Heyyyyy😁😁
The Baerritos always seem to be awesome!  Love the positivity!! And welcome all the new Baerritos (Taylor looks like you picked up a lot of new fam along this series)
You should do a full face using makeup from Wish! Or do a review on Makeup brushes from Wish! (Only the products that are Wish Verified, though!)
I got deported from London :/
I'm just so thankful for this series. I have a really hard time finding a good foundation for my skin type and colour since I have really bad texture and I'm extremely pale, so thank you soooo much :)
At the end the foundation makes her face look a completely different color than the rest of her body...
I'm a new burrito! Love your videos!
My first time watching your 15 days of foundation series and I loved it! Cant wait for the next one.
Taylor I'm sure you probably already know this but I wanted to comment just incase any of your subscribers didn't know that Milani now has a very pale shade porcelain . It's too matte for my dry maturing skin but I think so many younger ladies with oily skin would love it. It's full coverage and only $8-$10.
I found you through this series. I love that you're so honest and I have been binging your videos lately!
YOU MADE IT TO THE TRENDING PAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!
can you do a video comparing all the stick foundations you have tried?
I am brand new to your channel I am now binge watching
I mixed this foundation with Urban Decay was surprised how well it looked, I wore all day & had no problems, I have dry skin.
She looks like she could be Snow White.
GIRL! way to go! Your on the trending page!! ❤
Dermacol full coverage foundation found mine on Amazon for around $16 really would like your opinion
You're trennnndingggg! #33, POW! You're the best!
Get it girl, you're trending! Your hard work totally deserves it.
I know you probably get a ton of acne questions and/or comments but here is another one.  Do you have any health issues, such as pain, fatigue, digestion problems?  I ask because I have those types of issues and adult acne.  I believe it is all connected to pancreas and gallbladder issues.
Your eye makeup is on point! I love it!!
I am new to your chanel and so far i am loving your videos
So for my very first 15 days of foundation, I want to honestly say thank you for all you do and all of your hard work. This was for sure an amazing experience and very informative. Didn't want it to end at all lol
Hey girl, just wanted to say I love you to death and that your videos have been helping me cope with starting my life in college. I'm only a state away from home but it still sucks and sometimes the people here suck. Regardless, it always felt good to finish homework and reward myself by watching your newest video. 🖤🖤🌯🌯
i'd love to see some reviews on the boots no 7 foundations!  :)
*Go watch The Greatest Story Never Told if you want to know the truth.*
For a pink undertone foundation, its super yellow
So sad 15 days of foundation is over!!! Love you and you're videos though!
It's saying #18 on trending! 🤗
Just hoping someone check me out💯
Hey I found this channel from burts bees
Can you please try the Cover Fx Powder Foundation? Thanks!!
Bitch look like a vampire
Newly addicted to your channel! I have been enjoying every second! I have super oily skin and acne .. it's so great to see someone real! Much love! Oh and just ordered me some Too Faced! Can't wait!
I'd like to see your foundation collection please !! Lol a video on it would be cool
instead of cover it  , why don't you fix it?\nIs disgusting sorry.
#19 on trending! Way to go Taylor!!! 🌯🌯🌯
Have you reviewed true match lumi? I can't find your review on it. The liquid, not the cushion
I think you are not as light as you think you are.
Hello! Can you try the LaSplash Cosmetics UD Foundation? I'm curious to see what you think!
Please do a full face of ZuZu Cosmetics or 100% pure!! <3
Hey!! New subscriber 😘
Hey
Kys thot
Hey
Nice
Instead of using foundation to cover up your acne, why not use a acne p cream?
it's  trending 😃
Your hair looks super gorgeous today!
#18 trending!!!!:) yayyy love you and your videos
Beauty comes from within!
trending for a reason! #lovetaylor

Hi everyone 💓 I am indian youtuber and I make videos on how to take care of your skin naturally 💙 so please do check it out 😘
That is cheap! In Australia even Revlon can cost $30!!
There's nothing funnier than when a girl does her makeup and you can still see all the bumps underneath from her spots 😂
When and why did she take her lip ring out
Fun fact: Burt's Bees is a Clorox product! As is Hidden Valley Ranch :]

Yes please would love to see closet don't mind it being long😀❤
Ooooh I love the make up bag, what an amazing gift! Would love a closet tour to see how the new closet works (and of course what's in it!). Looking forward to catching up on the rest of your videos.\nHugs Adele xoxo
Try the West Elm storage coffee table - it lifts up into desk/dining table height and still looks very stylish
yes a closet tour!!
Closet tour!! 💖
You look STUNNING.
For a useful dining table, see tiny house ideas...you can get a table attached to wall that folds down when dining!
My grandparents have something they call a TV dinner table. They are a set of 4, but they are individual wooden tables that fold up and can be put into their holder but you sit on a chair or a couch and put them in front of you to eat in front of the tv but I've used them for a laptop too!! :)
THANK YOU for being so up front about what brands send to you vs. what you buy on your own. God, this is so refreshing. This allows your viewers to actually trust you... unlike many other youtubers out there right now. *eyeroll*
Definitely would love to see a closet tour and also are you going to do fashion week videos like you did last time about what you wore? I loved them!! xxx
Closet tour, yes please.
Those shoes looked solo cutee😍😍😍and as always love ur vlogss
Closet tour - yesss!!
Ugh would love to get goodies like this...getting things in the mail is the best feeling
Looking super gorge girly! X
I found these really nice wooden folding tray tables that we use for dinner, laptop work stations, etc. the top of mine has a vintage wine advert printed on it. It would go with your retro theme really well, plus you can fold them away in the corner when not using them.
OMG YOU'RE#7 TRENDING IN THE UK
I love that you tried some products on camera, that's quite rare. I'm always watching PO box openings and thinking 'I want to see you try it!'
I love your videos and i love fashion! 😍 deffo my fave YouTuber! Xx
Love your vlogs Victoria I get so much inspiration I need to start investing in bits and bobs first thing the pink GHD they are so pretty and for a first set these are perfect also Manolos OMG sooo beautiful yes yes yes to a closet tour xxx
Yes to the closet tour! And I would love to see more of your designer dupe outfit videos that you done a while back.
Yes! Do a closet tour!!😍
We want a closet tour please ! ❤
Yeeeah do a closet tour, your shoe and clothes collection is AMAZING
Love your vlogs 😘😊 please do a what's in my bag video.
Our little house doesn't have room for a dining room table so we bought super cute country style wooden trays from Home Bargains that have little quotes on them! We pop our food on there and eat of our laps with them! Also, your PR deliveries are giving me life!!! Those manolo's!!! X
Love your videos. Please do a closet tour
Your hairrrrr!!! 😭😍🌹
Those shoes 👠👠😍
Closet tour pleaseeeee! Those Manolo's omg they look so beautiful❤❤❤
CLOSET TOUR!!!!
Closet tour please ^.^ x
CLOSET TOUR PLZ

I get so sad when your vlogs are ending, I love every high class minute of them!
Closet tour!! 👍👍❤️❤️
Love your IG and YouTube channel! Would love to see you do a closet tour!
I've been waiting my whole life for your closet tour video!!.... or at least since we got a peak of your unreal coat collection when you did your cleanout :D xx
omg pls pls do the closet tour!!!! ❤️
Korean folding tables
Yasssss closet tour pleaseeee 😁😁
closet tour please...loved this vlog❤❤❤
Please do a flat tour! Seeing glimpses but would love to see the whole place (especially the closet) 😊\nDinner issue  - bean bag trays or fold away trays (like mini tables) 👍🏼x
I use a cushion on my lap and a tray on top of it,  I have fractured vertebrae in my back and I have been mending in a recliner lazyboy chair,   so this is how I have been eating my meals,   I have watched a lot of your videos and tutorials while I am healing,   like the sandals ,   I can't wait till I am better so I can wear my boots,   I only wear low heals,   more comfortable for me Chelsea boots is my fav style,   have a good NY fashion week,     I am a Yorkshire girl who lives in New Zealand,
What I would give to look like you with no makeup😍😍
Stunning babe, as always makes me so so happy when you get excited. Nobody deserves all those beautiful gifts more than you 💕
Was wondering if you had seen the new Mulberry mini trunk bag! They're sooo cute! xo
Hi Victoria, you can buy a Turkish style little round table with folding legs. This table is low and you sit on the floor. They come in different sizes. You can bring it out when u want and fold the legs and put behind a sofa when u'r done. You might find it online or if u can get u'rself to the Harringay area of london, green lanes, there are lots of Turkish shops there. U'll definitely find one there. Maybe an idea. Xx
We use the small white square table from ikea (can't think of the name but they're £5/7) easy to pop in the corner and use to display bits but light enough to move to the sofa to eat at! My son also uses it for activities.
What a fun time!! Would definitely love a closet tour! Xoxo, Caylie
I love your makeup look for your night out in New York 👌
Another fab video ❤️ would love to see s closer tour x
Yes closet tour!!!!😘 love you victoria
a closet tour would be very cool
What about a TV tray? I don't know if that's what it's called in England. It's a personal sized table that you unfold and use for food while sitting in the couch!
How about a fold away bistro table and chairs?
Honestly can't wait for you to have your own house because I already know how amazing your walk in closet is gonna be! xx
Yes please to the closet tour! \nA possible idea for dining in a flat - an outdoor bistro style set with a small table and two chairs that all fold up. We've got a set in mint green and bring it inside for extra seating when we need it and it looks really cute! But of course, you'd still need somewhere to keep them whilst folded - behind the settee, behind a door, under the bed?!
You say Lykke the same way you say Hygge just with  an L and a K :) Closet tour...hell yeah! xx
The Kurt Gieger boots are so beaut it hurts!! 😍😍😍 I'll have to save up for them 💛💛💛
I love how Alex is smiling at you while you were unpacking your little bag at the end...it's so sweet to see how much he loves to see you getting exited ☺️❤️
I really want to try the balmain lipsticks. I saw the advert which is amazing, the colours are insane. Yes please can we have a wardrobe tour. It may need to be two videos lol. Some fab products to try and some much in one video you busy bee. Xx
I love the new shoes from Manolo, especially the second pair!  You lucky girl!
Love all the vlogs, such an amazing chance to see you in your day-to-day life! A closet tour would be absolutely fab! A totally unrelated question: where do you do your brows? They are always on fleek! (and I keep wondering for the past 5 videos I think)
You should buy some folding TV trays to eat on.
We use the oblong trays that have a cushion on the underneath for eating our meals without a diningroom table, the cushion makes it comfy and so it doesnt slide off your knees.
use a TV tray. they're individual trays on a stand you can put in front of a chair or couch. and they fold up really small. it's probably easier than sitting on the floor. but probably not super sturdy or for fancy dining. good\nluck~
I'd love to see a make up collection video 💕
Alex' look at 16:36 😂 he knows how crazy Victoria is about make up 😂 so cute
Please do a closet tour!!
You could always get little tray tables so you can sit on the couch and eat? A little like a TV dinner 😂 but they work and can be stored easily!
Also - I have a coffee table that lifts up to dining room table height. Love it!
You can get some cushioned lap trays. They will suffice until you get a better table solution. Great for dining and easy to store. x
So excited for you always!please do a tour please😘
Hello Victoria, thank you for a very lovely video :-) I would much appreciate a closet tour, thanks for suggesting :-) Greetings from a rainy Paris <3
Would love to see a closet tour please! Can't wait to see your vlogs from NYFW😍
I WANT TO SEE A CLOSET TOUR <3 p.s. those manolos!!
Big 👍👍👍👍👍for the video and for a future closet tour!! Secondly Welcome to the U.S. I hope that you thoroughly enjoy yourselves here! Please stay and be safe!!
Yes Victoria, we would love to see a closet tour!! can''t wait to see you at fashion week!!! Loved your watch at the end of the vlog.
Hope we will be getting 'what I wore for FWNY' video with Instagram inserts like last fashion week(s) and get to hear ur process of putting outfits together, instead of solely seeing new gifted & purchased pieces.\n\nAnd for gen content I would love to see a video about multiple ways to wear one statement designer piece? Maybe starting with all the ways you wear your statement white blouses? Or maybe just choose one pair of shoes to base a look book around?! Xxxxx\n\nTweeted u about beanbag dinner trays
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\nFashion Video with 40,000 Views in 24 Hours = 16 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?
where is the white band you wear around your head when you do your make up from?
Cant wait for outfit post from you for this fashion week! Soo curious to see what you have chosen to wear for it :)) Those heels reminds me of something a barbie doll would wear lol so cute though :p
You're definitely my favourite now. Really enjoy your videos and look forward to the next one. I'm probably older than your usual demographic but I don't care 😀
Lol .. ours is tv breakfast tv lunch and TV dinner 😂😂😂😂
I don't know hoe big the livingroom is but maybe smering like a walltable with some low barchairs?
i was expecting a video and got a vlog😤
Hey vic, mind to let us know what nail colour you wore in this video?? It's amazing😍
You're really passionate about your clothes, shoes, bags and make up products it's just wonderful to see!! Xxx
I can't believe you got thousands worth of dream products and just rattled it off like a Tesco order! So jealous!!
I have some friends who have a small apartment in NYC and they bought a kitchen table and cut it in half and used brackets to attach it to the wall, almost like a breakfast bar. It looks super cute and quirky!
What a question.  Oh course you need to do a huge Closet Tour 😍😍😍
OMG, I'm in love with your living room carpet! Where did you buy it? xoxo
Victoria I want ask you about your mascara ???
I dont care much for shoes, but those you got are sooo beautiful! Hope you keep getting all these wonderful things. Cause you really know how to show them. Love!
your skin looks beautiful!
We used to live in a small flat in London and had a table similar to this. It can go from a normal height coffee table to a fold out dining table. It's kind of two sides of a table on top of each other which swivel and fold outwards. Or you can keep it smaller and just raise the height. It was honestly perfect! I think the brand was Callagaris we bought it from a furniture shop in spitalfields \n\nhttps://www.heals.com/magic-j-table.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6YXbsY2n1gIVQr7tCh2g3A7TEAQYFyABEgJJlvD_BwE\n\nI can't find the calligaris one we had but it was more like this https://www.styleourhome.com/mascotte-wenge-multi-purpose-table.html?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsdDaiJGn1gIVZ7vtCh1ZlASaEAQYCCABEgJl6_D_BwE\n\nWe used it for 7 years and my bro now has it in his flat another 7 yes on and the mechanism still works perfectly xx
You really have opening products with your left hand down pat.  Victoria Beckham - how wonderful.  Alex is really cute and patient half watching you on the bed lol.
creased when alex was watching what you got gifted then realised it was make up and lost interest 😂
what is name of your favorite ray bane sunglasses ? i cant remember .... :/ also it is soooo sweet to see how you shine when you are with your boyfriend
It's a child. There is no place for hatred here.\n\n\nYou people are disgusting.
*A summary of this comments section:*\n\nBlack men: fuck you filthy bed wench!!!\nWhite people: fuck you ugly chimp baby!!!\nBlack people: fuck you mutant neanderthal baby!!!\nCommon youtube scum: this is the work of the jews!!!\n\n\n\n\nI don't want to live in this world anymore.
1:15 wtf! how is that attractive?!!
Make sure you race-mix your genes and heritage away into nothingness, goy. Diversity is our strength
I have her on Snapchat 🤦🏼‍♀️I don't remember Serena being pregnant
No race have dominant genes thats total BULLSHIT that black ppl carry in thier heads. Mixed kids is 50% white 50% black. Sometimes they can be more pale or more dark. Fuck you idiots that buy into that shit.
What is in a name Alexis Olympia ohanian Jr.
Today's generation of schoolchildren looks much different than one just a few decades ago. Nonwhites are expected to become the majority of the nation's children by 2020, as our colleague Bill Chappell reported last year. This is now the reality among the very youngest Americans: babies.\n\nBabies of color now outnumber non-Hispanic white babies (1 year or younger), according to new estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. The newest estimate shows that on July 1, 2015, the population of racial or ethnic minority babies was 50.2 percent.\nBut the scales may have actually tipped in 2013 — the Census Bureau often revises past population estimates as new data become available. That means the first of these babies are now preschool-aged.\n\nWe've already been seeing this shift in U.S. schools: the 2014-15 school year marked the first time that minority student enrollment in public schools surpassed that of white students.\n\nNPR could not reach any babies for comment.\n\n\n BLACKS.... we don't die we multiply 🤷🏾‍♂️
Your wife is stunning! And I love the name Olympia so much! Congrats.
Awwww! My birthday was on the 15! Can you guess how old I am now?!
We've got another black Nigger monkey for mind training, just like Ghettogagger.com 😊
Awe this is so sweet and pure. Too bad the racist had to spread their sick hatred throughout the comments.
Congratulations on the birth of your beautiful daughter.
They're a beautiful couple and they have a beautiful baby, get out of here with your racist junk
Absolutely adorable! I wonder how big brother and sister are adjusting?
is the child going to ask why do you censor me daddy
Do not read the hateful comments by angry white racists below. This video is killing them. LOL

Lol do you think one of the greatest female tennis player and one of the most successful athletes of all time cares about the opinions of a bunch of ignorant cumskins in the youtube comments? Kys trolls
Who was clicking like it was Snapchat
Such a great video!!
Wow, these people are really full of themselves.
Racists: *spews hate and slurs at a damn video welcoming a new baby to the world from parents worth more than their mortgages*\nMe: *a fellow black and white mixed who couldn't be any happier*
Fun fact: people in the comments being edgy fools, saying stuff like the n word or don't race mix. You should mind your own business and not comment on things. Because at the end of the day you just look like a needy child.
So beautiful just like her mum

These two are so cute together. Beautiful family.

What's the problem with race mixing? Like any of us are a 100 percent one race anyway. Just do a simple ancestry DNA test, and your results might surprise you. All the racists in the comments could be 20% of the race the they hate, and they'd never know 🤷🏾‍♀️
I don't consider myself politically correct, but even I can see this planet has reached a sick, sick state when even a newborn baby can't be protected from racism. I feel so helpless that I can't stop these goddam hate comments. I hope she never sees them one day.
Congrats to you and your family new member 😍😂😎😇👶
I don't understand why there is hate because of a baby being born. So what if two different races want to have a child I mean it's not your child so screw off with your opinions and nonsense. Congrats by the way.
100 % fake. Sir Rena is a man.
Aww... this is a really sweet video. Congrats.
I loved where you guys put Grand Slam Titles: 1! Congratulations to both of you! She is absolutely beautiful! 💖
Awww....I'm so happy for them!!!
I bet $20 that is is just some type of 4chan raid.
Babylon is falling!!! Time to get right with the Creator! Shalom♥
Beautiful. \nDon't let the racists get to you. We all know there's a lot of adults out there that still have some growing up to do.
Aww she's adorable!!!😱Welcome to the world little Alexis!❤️
Awwww....so beautiful ...Im loving that name...Jr :-)

Based Race Mixing
I Love this love
This is fucking beautiful life being created, happiness existing, but why do y'all got to be so damn fucking aggressive damn like is there any actual reason to hate besides the fact that you want attention, or to troll, or because you were raised to see this as wrong, every one dislikes something but there's no need to be aggressive about it and blowing up the comment section doesn't help when the comment you make has been stated fifteen times already
Hahahahaha men can't have babies!! Lying to the world. Salvation is coming, he's the only one who gives children and I bet he didn't give you any! Liars and their moon bumps hahahahaha
Mixed breed, I suggest you take it out and kill it.
N I G G E R
Gross.
I'm surprised it didn't come out with a penis considering how much anabolics the momma monkey does.
Too bad the baby's half a nigger
Omg idk you guys but this is the sweetest video ever. You can see the love between them. Happy for them❣️ what a beautiful couple💗💗
Before you go down the comments any further I just want you to know that there's a lot of good white people in this world just like there's good blacks Mexicans and etc don't let these people ruin your image on the white race
YES! The Earth is FLAT.
Lol its gonna be a mixed race cofee colour piece of shit
Is that Serena Williams?
Why tf does the thumbnail have Reddit people on it
damn that name is shitty as fuck
Cuck
Well..the baby has 2 dads
Grossssssssssss
I'm not getting what the big deal is here.  Are not 95% of couples equally ecstatic about their pregnancy?  Are either of these parents-to-be celebrities?  If so, how?  What exactly is the hullabaloo about this couple?
Darkness everywhere...
Nigger
Race mixed
Sis it's a coon with a white!!disgusting
Ugly mix race baby

What red water activated paint did you use for this look?
Hey Mykie!! (Sorry if I spelt that wrong)\nI love your videos, been a fan for a long time. You have definitely inspired me to learn SFX make up along side learning animation in uni. \nI was wondering if you would ever do a 'windigo' type SFX tutorial. You know like the creatures out of until dawn game (I think that was the name) but with your own special flare. \nI don't think I've ever seen you do that look before and would love to see you do it 😃\nKeep being amazing!!
mykie i love your videos💕, can you make please a tutorial of nemesis of resident evil 3 the videogame, there is no good tutorial of it:c (sorry for my inglish, i speak spanish)

The kid that reenacted the stitches music video was Johnny Orlando 😂
More shawn mendes interviews shows etc love you shawn😍💕✨💯
we are dating send me what have to call the inter phone and pretend to be driver phone sex is to much well phone is spensif of course is just radio transmitter we need a date a terapist trow to garbage paying brick and date in second sex is good ur gay sex no ur gay no exist gay
did shawn get a tattoo\n on his finger
2:23 I think he was talking about Johnny Orlando 😍
i will never get tired of Shawn's laugh...it's like home....
The little boy he was talking about was Johnny Orlando
I was never a fan of him but he is so talented, he is so kind and nice to people!! If I could marry him I would!
Aww poor shawn he was probably so confused and terrified, but this story made me laugh, and now I feel bad :(
I already see which parts are going to be used in a conspiracy/shady video later on...that's how you know you've been on youtube for a while.
What a beautiful kid. I call him kid cause he's like 9-10 years younger than me. Absolutely love his music.
No one looks better than you
i died laughing ahhhhahahah \ni feel bad for laughing now loool
I LOVE YOU SHAWN
His voice can not hit the high notes
I'm so proud of what he has achieved and what a big artist he's becoming😍 that Drake story was hilarious!
When he says Oh no it reminds me of Corbyn Besson... I'm not sure why... 😂
2 word for Shawn that describe him▶▶▶▶ Humble, Kind😘💕
Omg I love how down to earth he is <3
for a second i thought he was talking about Paint ( jon cozart)
I love him haha
*I fall in love with him* 😍😍❤
Don't expect everyone to know you 😂😂 that sounds like a grounding experience
Never seen such a classy man
He's so cute!!!
I love shawn❤️
He's handsome
Eu ouvi Brasil? Yeah, I heard Brazil
Was Shawn talking about Johnny Orlando😂💋❤??
*MILDLY* starstruck?! who the fuck says MILDLY' ? unless theyre trying to portray that theyre some huge superstar who doesn't get impressed? he thinks he's a much bigger star than he really is. & he's GAY, you can tell he holds back from speaking with a gay accent like before*
2:16 Zach Herron was the only thing that popped in my mind
I love Shawn so much😍😍😘😘❤❤
I have a fan account for Shawn from back in 2014, and have been watching him since he was 14. I still think of him as a normal person, it's too crazy to see him as a huge celebrity now. He went from being one of the least famous members of MAGcon to one of the biggest stars now. I love him.
So humble 💕💕💕💕
Someone protect him
He is so sweet
💖💖love him so freaking much !
We love a successful bottom.
The comment section is full of whaaaamen, and I came to get me some  😏
the sound effect he made when he jerked his arm 😂😂😂
who's the guy who did that cover thingy
I went to his Portland concert and he was AMAZING!!!! I even made a video about my experience. Y'all should check it out 😊.
bring rich chigga to the show
I'm simple,. I see shawn , I clicked.
I was at the show in Brooklyn. If you want to see the video press my picture
Power bottom vibes 😩😩
Jesus loves you
Aweee poor Shawn
The reason why I started guitar was because of there's nothing holdin me back and when I heard he started because of ed sheeran I screamed lmao
HEY SHAWN PLEASE COME TO MALAYSIA ANG I WANNA SEE YOU LIVE HERE>>>>>I LOVE YOU BABY<<<<<
I think he was talking about Johnny Orlando😂
I feel like the dude who has 80 million views for a parody of stitches might be Bart Baker....
im searching the 80M video
For the first time in a long time it seems to me that Jimmy is actually really into the person he's interviewing, usually he seems like he's just doing the job he's supposed to do so he can get it over with and move on but with Shawn he seems legit interested in who he is and what he's doing.. anybody else got this feeling? :D
If you're here for the title it's at 5:30
Even his voice when he's just talking is perfect.
he's so humble omg i love him so much (':
Was he talking about johnny orlando 😂
he's so hot
this guy must really have a tough job.. looks like hes forcing it too much to look like hes enjoying talking to this guy
ugh he is so cute. That story made me love him even more
Can you bring Rihanna on the show? She has had a career for over 10 years +++ and hasn´t been on yet!!
With the Boy who did stiches better
How did he not know it was Shawn tho 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Which video is he talking about ?
he's so beautiful 😩💜
The moral lesson in that is Don't expect everybody to know who you are. Hahahaha cutiee
Come on Shawn you know what you could've done\n\nPlease have mercy on meee
Bless him😂😭
That's my boyyyyy
Shawn mendes is daddy
So proud of Shawn ❤️
He's so chill he's awesome
Mendes Army?? 💙
Llakjssoslslsosoozzozozkzkozkzoxozlspzplzozozzlozlsoeos.alpalalalapssp
YAYYY
Love him sm 💘💘💘
Shawn is so cute ahaha
Omg Shawn is so great! He did an amazing show in Houston both times I saw him 💕
He sold out in 5 minutes!!!!!
It's so amazing that although Shawn is popular he is still simple #1fan
if you look very closely you can see his new tattoo of an elephant on his left hand middle finger 😍
my poor baby 😭😂😂 i’m so proud of you babe! 💗
I'm smiling from ear to ear, he's so cute!
He talked about Johnnnn... I'm a proud fan.👍🤘❤️
Did anyone else see his new tattoo on his finger. It's an elephant and his mom has the same one. I love it :) ❤
The video of the kid who reenacted stitches is Johnny Orlando
the first song I learnt  on guitar was I know what you did last summer
Johnny Orlando
I'm not even a fan of his and while listening to him speak it took me a while to realize I was subtly smiling at my screen like an idiot
GOD how much I love this human being 🔥❤️
He's the cutest human being ever 😍
2:22 johnny my baby
When Shawn said he did something in Brooklyn, and I live there, and I WASNT THERE😂😂😂
his voice annoys me
Anybody else think he was talking about Johnny Orlando?
I'm wondering how long he can stay this humble.
Your songs are great
I love how he determinedly pretends Magcon never happened
No one is better looking than Shawn Mendes. Also can we talk about how adorable he is when he tells stories? 💘
¿De dónde ves #LaFormula?

Will you actually just go out with me?
Can't wait to see him in Montreal.... montreal gang where your you at ?????
Hey nile , i've been watching your videos since couple months and i was wondering if i could have a good level in gymnastic considering i am starting at 17 years old.\nAnyway keep up the good work bro
My team and I did rugby blindfold... We're crazy 😜
I don't have any idea if you read these or not, but it would be great if you did a Gymnastics vs. Martial Arts.
Though you were going to do some blindfold tricks
●●COME SEE MY CHANNEL AND WATCH MY VIDEOS! TRYING TO GET TO 100 SUBS●●
If only you could do Olympic quality gymnastics... 😦😢😭 \nBring it on! 😃 \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
5:09 that whole part was so cute. This is so positive i love it.
talented .... wish I could move in cat like manner .... they seem brain dead but it's probably their way of releasing tension & having fun...... anyway love 'em all 💋
The big lebowski clip of Jesus is my fav in the whole movie. Lmao wow good stuff!
if you ice your ears then use a sharp earring and put as much pressure as possible you can repierce your ear
When u think yourself as a gymnast then u see Nile 😂  \nNile is my fav youtuber
these videos bring back so many memories of my younger days when i did some gymnastics. mostly what i remember though, is that the gym always smelled like ass....lol
Nice fun and games but when it's on its on, keep rocking you guys great channel !
There's a pic of u in my gymnastics hall
Why is it every video is on trending but you haven't got at least 1M subscribers?
i love this style of editing, good job! @00:54
You guys are so lucky, I have always loved gymnastics but for the past couple of years I haven't been able to do any because the nearest gym with a men's team is several hours away, and the closest gym is an all girls one that I could walk to if I wanted. The pain is real
It is great to see that you are well Nile and training hard for the competition, I'm sure this effort will be rewarded. Hugs man
We LOVE you here in Atlanta, Nile. You're infectiously chiper and lovable. congrats on the champiionship and good luck in Canada.
loved this vid mate!! Keep up the good grind boy 😎💖💯
Trying to study Pharmacology and end here... XD \nLove you Nile!
Wilson is literally the best gymnastics male human being 👏👏👏
U even a champion?
Any small youtubers wanna support each other
I like how they play around and prank each other without being mean about it, like they stopped Nile from actually licking the lotion they put on his hand lol. They seem like nice friends.
I do gymnastics and you and the British team are such an inspiration to me
i train at this training centre it's so cool knowing that you go there too!!💗🤸🏼‍♀️🤸🏼‍♀️
I'm in love with the new editing
That redhaired gymnast is FINE!\nI hope he didn't hurt his foot...
Anyone else just on here to look at fit men in shorts 😂
You're nipples are so small it's cute.
I love u soooo much do u like Chris brown cause I loveee himmmm
Every video this guy uploads goes on trending page
Are you all picking on our Scottish commonwealth champion there? Just as well my mum doesn't watch you tube! She loves both Daniels!!
Be blindfolded and go through a obstacle course
Who here just to see his abs.No homo.
If I would have know that gymnastics is a bunch of hot-shirtless guys goofing off with one another, I would have joined when I was a kid.  To be young again!  You guys really seem to have fun.  Alright, I would not be piercing my ears, but the other stuff was great.\nbye\nBrennan
All of their accents XD
I should be doing my homework right now, but here I am.
Did anyone see his coaches smile get a little bigger when he started talking about the competition ❤️
In the challenge video you did with people on squad you never explained what the meaning of spinal and schmeagle was...?
jajajaja minute 0:37 jajaja wow sexy and hot and minute 2:01 his scream of very very woman jajaja
I love watching your videos and your edits are lit 🔥🔥😍😍
He's blowing up!!! One day I will get 100 subs and then blow up and laugh at myself
why is Nile single...well in his own words I can't find the hole  ;)  Great Video!
My mum said I went there and I came first in that competition like you did and got a big gold medal to
Your edits are definitely getting better!
Boo.  I really wanted to see them try to flip around blind folded...
O Nile Wilson parece com aquele loiro do One Direction ! sempre achei parecido!

Do a backbend
And I thought swimmers were jacked...
really fun video i loveedd itt!!!!!!
He kinda looks like DionYorkie
Eh...You're getting there.  💪🏾😂
YOU HIT TRENDING!!!!! Ily Nile
Merci , de me faire rire, pleurer , sourir , et me donner envie de me dépasser dans mon sport à chaque fois que je regarde une de tes vidéos !!! 😉👍🎥\nContinue comme ca , tu est quelqun de bien en plus d'être un grand champion ! 😘🏆
hey nile do you think it's too late to start gymnastics at the age of nearly 15??\n\nEDIT: DAYUM 28 ON TRENDING LETS GO
Nile , is there any way you could make a video giving advice to gymnasts like me who are finding it hard to resist quitting gymnastics and can't find much of a reason to stay in the sport :// I love the sport and couldn't imagine my life without it but I don't know wether to quit
Have you ever tried the carmona on rings?
I really want to do gymnastics but I have never done it before. I'm nearly 18 and feel like I won't be good enough to start gymnastics now. I'm not in the best of shape either. I know they do adult gymnastics by me at lillenshall but I feel like I won't be good enough or fit enough. Do yo have any advice or should I think Of something else to do.
Hi Nile, I did gymnastics when I was younger but i was never flexible enough to advance to a higher level. It got to the point where my coach told my parents that they would have better luck spending their money elsewhere. I really loved it especially bars, because I am naturally strong and they were fun for me. I am now 17 and haven't done gymnastics for six years. Do you think it is possible for me to get back into it? Or do you think it's too late?
Hey do you twist both ways in training or competitions? Im really only able to twist one way, kind of frustrating id like to see your take on it
Is he Scottish?
sorry thumbs down cuz clickbait\nand not going through with it
R u going to the next commonwealth games If so I might see u there cause I'm going there great vid!!!
How tall are you? Nile
why not do the safer things with the blindfold. like handstand. swinging on the bar/rings with the foam blocks under it. or a blindfolded handstand walk race. with things on the side so you know you are going the right way.
ETA on restocking train smart t shirt?
Is coach Dave any good at gymnastics? You should do a video of you putting him through his paces 😁
Have you taken ballet?  You might investigate it, if not.  Bram Verhofstad moves like one, seems to actually slow time when he moves, it's thrilling to watch.  Somewhat like football player Lynn Swann, who was also a ballet student.  Your talent is so amazing, but it doesn't draw the eye in the same way.  Your movement could be not just thrilling, but breath-catchingly beautiful.
Loving your video's Nile! They inspire me and put a smile on my face :) Was just wondering when the men's train smart, keep it real t-shirts will be back in stock? X
Were you using a cup as a blindfold???
Gymnastics is for girls
Nile do you ever go to tramp parks or are they too dangerous (or you don't have time)for a professional athlete? You guys could literally bounce off the walls there!
Random question: what hogwarts house would you think you'd be in?
I don't know why, but I'm like a solid 89% that Nile is gay, or at least bi.
From this valley they say you are leaving\nWe shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile\nFor you take with you all of the sunshine\nThat has brightened our pathway a while\n\nRIP good sir
Seeing him play this made me deeply happy. I think he's one of the finest actors around.
RIP dear Harry (Carl) :(
We need a Harry Dean Stanton sings Country album, ASAP!
R.I.P.
Rest in Peace Harry
Good night, sweet prince. :'(
Love Harry, such amazing artist!!!
Rest in peace Mr Stanton. You are cool until the very end
This made me tear up. Rest in peace, man.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. You will be missed.
Rest in Peace, Harry!
oh fuck, just heard about his passing. What a man though, a long life being in great movies. I'm so glad Lynch brought him back for Twin Peaks, this scene especially was just the sweetest thing.\nWe'll miss ya, Harry ;_;
... it's a fuckin' nightmare.
Who in the world would leave a thumbs down?  Seriously???
RIP Harry, you lived a good long life and were a damn fine actor.
So beautiful. Rest In Peace, Mr. Stanton.
We have had the privilege of receiving Harry Dean as a Lynchland Guest recently, and we shared his 15 favorite songs in a special Guest Mix on his birthday on July 7th.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/HarryDeanMix
Thanks. I like it https://goo.gl/xyuXiF
I am not the only one who thought this one of the best moments in the series. RIP.
CUTE!
And we will miss you, and your great music, & acting Harry Dean RIP but,= at least your music lives on to be listened to & enoyed + still to shine on!
Rest in peace legend
Legendary character actor Harry Dean Stanton died on Friday 15.9.2017.
R.I.P I will keep my blood
I had a dream about him last night. So sad. I thought he would live forever!
Rest in Peace Harry, You never delivered a single bad performance. I hope they have a cigarette waiting for you in heaven.
RIP the great Harry Dean!
RIP Carl . Glad we got to see you again in Twin Peaks The Return.
Rest In Peace, Harry Dean Stanton xx
RIP- This is a tough jam, knowing it as his last.
Rest In Peace, brother.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.  May Carl Rodd finally find some peace.
R.I.P Harry Dean Stanton Kudos to David Lynch for letting him appear in Twin Peaks - The Return and for making him play his guitar and sing. :'(
The light went out at the Fat Trout Trailer Park. RIP Harry Dean Stanton (aka Carl Rodd). You'll be surely missed by all TP fans.
RIP. A legendary actor and a great one at that
Rest In Peace brother. So glad I got to see him preform one last time.
THANK YOU FOR ALL THE MEMORIES! YOUR SMALL PARTS AND FILM WILL BE REMEMBERED!!!
I just want to say, good night, sweet prince, may flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. Harry Dean Stanton. Rest in peace.
Farewell, Harry. You went out still giving your best.
Rest in peace, Harry Dean Stanton you golden voiced champion. I'm so glad we got to see so much of him in the new Twin Peaks.
is it just me or is the sound a little weird?  low volume and 'wavey'.
R.I.P. Harry...
R.I.P.

DEP

R.I.P.

RIP Harry Dean Stanton. One of the great character actors who's been in so many great movies.
please let's get this on the series soundtrack!
Right
Are we just gonna ignore De Bruyne's pass at the end of the game???
Early days but I think an english team could win it this year. Best bunch of teams we've had in the champions league for quite a lot of years now
They were the easiest goals I have ever seen\nWhat a Feyenoord doing
Man City look like a different class at the moment. They ripped Liverpool apart the other day😪 And destroyed Feynoord today⚽️
Media always pay to much attention to opposition teams playing badly vs City and never give City credit.
Feyenoord got hit with two stones
Second game in a row we've smashed a team that sing YNWA
De bryune is amazing his passing is filth
Feyenoord so bad lol
did anyone notice de bruyne's reaction at 0:31?? hahaha
KDB is absolutely insane! He has something special that no other football players have! He has such vision and control and plays intelligently! He is so accurate! 🤘🏻👑
I am a man u fan but Mendy was worth the amount city payed 4 him
Best team ever. Come at me haters! 🖕🏿
arsenal will win champions league
Gabriel Jesus > Rashford
Kevin d...was that a shot or a pass jks
Manchester city look strong this year .
Ok then well done bt
Kun Aguero, their greatest ever European scorer \n\nLast Time I checked Argentina was in South America...
MUST SEE!!! https://youtu.be/ZFAz2QKcOTA

Easy
When did feyenord sign Odell Beckham jr
.
Poor Feynoord
*Jesus* ftw
T
Feyenoord did well! Lol
Ayy
KDB better then kroos and modric, kroos and Modric are called the best because they are at real madrid
Let's play a game. Which UCL game was Arsenal fans & players watching?
Come On guys let's get BT to 400k subscribers
First one is an own goal. Comes off one leg which is going wide and then the other knocks it back on goal.
This is what happens when Brad Jones plays in goals...
lol  😂😂😂
I hope Man City lose their next game
City have just smashed arguably the best side in Europe atm 4-0. There's no reason why we can't go on and win it now! #FeyenoordWho?
City might have the cash but can never buy history
Anyone else hear that metal gear solid sound or am i bugging out
i'm scared to watch spurs against city this year... city look solid
BT Only said that Feyenoord played bad.\nNever said we were good. City bashers all over
Arab FC.
And to think Man City were gonna swap aguero for Sanchez aguero the far superior player.
0:56\nEuropean? Someone needs a geography lesson...
Aguero being their greatest scorer in Europe isn't so impressive when the only time they have been to the Champions league is the past 6 years.
Title is wrong says 3-0 to feyenoord
Her voice is everything
must have in your music gallery 😍
i cant, i just hear her voice and get an install orgasm
When Dua hits the note at 2:46 👌
Dua is the new Amy, Ariana is the new Mariah, Beyonce is the new Whitney, Selena is the new Britney, and Demi is the new Christina.
Good lord this is gold
Best thing to happen to me this month 😍😍😍😭🙏🏽
OHMYGODN THE COLLABORATION THE WORLD NEEDS
All I can ever be to you\nIs the darkness that we knew,\nAnd this regret I've got accustomed to.\nOnce it was so right,\nWhen we were at our high,\nWaiting for you in the hotel at night.\n\nI knew I hadn't met my match,\nBut every moment we could snatch,\nI don't know why I got so attached.\nIt's my responsibility,\nAnd you don't owe nothing to me,\nBut to walk away I have no capacity.\n\n[Chorus:]\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day\nBut I'm grown,\nAnd in your way,\nIn this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own.\n\nI don't understand\nWhy do I stress a man\nWhen there's so many bigger things at hand.\nWe coulda never had it all,\nWe had to hit a wall,\nSo this is inevitable withdrawal.\nEven if I stop wanting you,\nA perspective pushes through,\nI'll be some next man's other woman soon.\n\nI shouldn't play myself again,\nI should just be my own best friend,\nNot fuck myself in the head with stupid men.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nSo we are history,\nYour shadow covers me\nThe sky above,\nA blaze,\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI wish I could say no regrets,\nAnd no emotional debts,\n'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets\n\nSo we are history,\nThe shadow covers me,\nThe sky above,\nA blaze that only lovers see,\n\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day\nBut I'm grown,\nAnd in your way,\nMy blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own.\n\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day\nBut I'm grown,\nAnd in your way,\nMy deep shade\nMy tears dry on their own.\n\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day\nBut I'm grown,\nAnd in your way,\nMy deep shade\nMy tears dry

Poco se habla de lo que ha robado el Barça, en la primera jugada del vídeo es mano de Gerard Piqué, por lo que sería penalti y su segunda amarilla (el árbitro no pita nada). En el primer gol del Barça viene precedido de una falta a Atunes (no pita nada y es gol).\nEn el segundo gol del Barcelona, Paulinho le da un codazo a Djené (no pita nada y es gol).\nVeo que el Barça no se cansa de robar, la Liga no toma medidas, aún así, ellos siguen llorando.\n#ForzaGeta
Denis Suarez> Ausencio y el que lo niegue no sabe de futbol y no quiere a su perro.
robando como siempre. por eso serán la sombra del madrid
A puros huevos ganaron los farsas
I did not expect any of this...
You have such good style!!! So cute
You always looks super cute but I wouldn't be able to wear any of those outfits at school except maybe the green professional
This wasn't helpful because 1) I started school August 14th and 2) I'm at a military college so I'm in uniform every single day. But still enjoyable. I liked the pantsuit.
Your orchid went fishing and caught a stuffed toy
Number 2 makes me think of the lesbian teacher who would be 100% dtf a student
downloading and firing up my unmosaic engine!!!!
not gonna lie, i would kill for that green suit
You're not a doctor is my new favorite comeback.
I FEEL WEIRD MERCH
loooove these type of videos
All of these looks were actually hella cute. Like if she had resisted the urge to troll it up a bit, this would be a legit beauty/fashion video with some real cute looks. It wouldn't be Grace though without a little bit of troll.
I am feelin' all of those outfits
If you have a uniform is you education a lie?
I know it's supposed to be a parody but I liked all the outfits
Grace you are amazing but my babe no these outfits kill the school dress code in so many ways.
You're not even in school wtf are u doing
The green one had a Riddler vibe lol
I'm home-schooled so pajamas everyday!\n(Also, that green pants suit is giving me INSANE Onceler vibes.)
To make the androgynous look complete, you should wear either a knit stocking cap or a baseball cap with your hair stuffed up inside it. Or cut it short like Ellen (or shave your head completely, if you *really* want to commit to the look).   ;-)
Grace legit looks amazing in all of these 😂❤️
to be serious for a second, what is this back to school outfit thing about? I mean why don't you  wear the same shit you wore in summer? and if the first day of school is a little colder then wear something warmer than last week.
What about kids who go to school who have to wear uniform?
WOULD 100% WEAR EACH OF THOSE OUTFITS DO MORE OF THESE
this is me leaving a comment down below
He Never Came Back should be the title of your next book.
this was by far top 5 itsgrace videos I've ever seen lmao
I get the comedic sense of this video, but in all seriousness... you'd make a great fashion blogger. I was expecting parody outfits, but these actually look great!\nPS. Someone get this girl a Dior ad so she can rock a pantsuit in next month's Vogue!
Only one of those outfits was appropriate dress for my school
Grace is literally such a catch
but for real she looked hot af as a rock princess
I love how she's making fun of all the serious back to school videos on youtube 😂😂
With the way schools have been lately, the outfit with the skirt or the long shirt will not fly. I have no problems with it, but again some schools are ran by sexist dicks and those outfits would get a young lady kicked out.
Can I be fashionably awkward like you?
Omg number five I can't💀
I can't wear any of these at my school
Why do you look great in all of them??
I love videos like this, always super funny. \nYour dad is Gene Simmons\nNo!
I like the 5th one
grace grace grace grace!!!!! I need to tell you, I liked this video XD
Your outfit / fashion reviews are my favourite 🙌👏👏👏😂
Let's talk about how freaking great she looked in the androgynous outfit
LIVING FOR THE ROCK PRINCESS LOOK! 🌸🎸🌸
The green pantsuit reminds me of that guy who wants to cut down all the trees in the Lorax 😂
No dying this time !\nDon't forget.\n Only 1/2 cup of water per week for the Orchid !!!
Clicked so fast when I saw kristens I feel weird. Shirt
First Outfit looked so good on you! Also why ain't you a mooodel?
BOYFRIEND GRACE IN THIS VIDEO
I just came here to say Fuck Meghan Rienks and Grace Helbig;) That is all;)
outfit 4 brings out the gay in me
Green pantsuit is like a combo of Hillary Clinton and heather duke hhhahaha
STOP BEING SO GODDAMN FUNNY YOU DELIGHTFUL HUMAN BEING!!!
I don't wanna do this one
I LOVED THIS😂😂😂 but also she looked super cute in like ALL THOSE OUTFITS
This is the funniest shit I've seen all week
My favorite part of this video was Brooks' reflection in the glass door where you could tell he was filming in his boxers.
did Grace just do an actual, serious lookbook?
OK but Grace, how do you look amazing in every single one of these outfits! ❤👌😱
all of these outfits are so cool and hot and the way you do this sort of look book thing is so funny you big weirdo i love it!!!!!!!!!
Love these!
Love these viddddds!! Fashion videos😍😍
😂😂😂
I'm tired but nice vid make more plz thx
i know she's joking around but she actually looks great! ❤
You could definitely be a model you're gorgeous and you looked great in every one of the outfits 👑
Grace we get it you look cute in everything
I DIED AT CASUAL FRIDAY😭😭😭😭😭❤️
You're not a doctor
Grace I luv ya but ya forty as fuck.\nFor sure let's let the kids handle 1st period issues. Jk jk
Grace's legs on the Rock Princess look!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO GOOD
Chester see, come back and get yo pants
Real talk where was the skirt from in the 3rd outfit I love it
I actually like the outfits... well done Grace. I flipping love you.🙌🏼
these are all cute as hell but like I can't wear any of them other than the pant suit because of damn dress code smh
Please do more of these!! In any way shape or form, I love your fashion videos

DRESS CODE
Oh loved all tho!
these videos are ok
What a fucking true song about musician love.. I believe this is just about her relationships ending with musicians, ie: like G-Eazy.
MY GOD I LOVE THIS
hi i am a producer from the uk and would appreciate it if you could give me feed back on my beats, thanks :)
What's this? in every video she loves different man, where is stability?:D
sexy\n\nbut no homo \n\nmaybe a little..?
just imagine if zayn and lana did a song together , that would be FUCKING AMAZING \nI hope 🙏 my wish come true
for not have time to heer it
She used to make better song clips :/
Lana please tell me you're making a music video for get free next 😩
I like lana's music, but I couldn't help thinking of john fassold's video
Was this shot in Dubai? The background in the beginning seems so I'm probs hella wrong
Jp Sears in this
Mustang means THE DICK right?
the guy character looks like a young Axel Rose from Guns n Roses
http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=80728
That part 2:31-2:45❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is so.....zzzzzzzzzz
fine
Is lana even human?
hgjhy
Classic Lana
She's so lucky \nFeel so jealous
She's been making shit videos since honeymoon, I miss the old Lana del  rey. Summertime Sadness video and also Shades of Cool had better production.
She needs a fucking grammy
DIVOSAAAAAAA 🖤
i want to sit on that mustang ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

That's not even a Mustang!
DAMN BITCH YOU JUST SNATCHED MY WIG ALL THE WAY FROM SPACE
listening to this while riding around in my bfs white mustang 😋
lol she literally mumbles the entire song, terrible
someone knows what is the music in the 3:00 ? tnksss
LANA IS SO FUCKING TALENTEDN ITS CRAZY I HAVE NEVER HEARD A SONG FROM I DONT LIKE, BLESS YOU MY QUEEN
Forced to watch cher singing in an ad just to view this - that's commitment. GAP just lost half it's customer base though.
Your White Mustaine. You know, Dave Mustaine.
Twist: the White Mustang is his d*ck
Every song of hers sounds like a lullaby. 🎼🎵🎶👂🏻 She looks like she came out of the 1930's, 40's, 50's, & 60's. 👀
why this music 2:48 tell the end?? i don't like it
A little bit High by the beach in the beginning)\nGod... I love her. All my heart.
I feel like this video talks about 'Groupie love' song :3
I love this song ♥♥♥♥
You did a great job!!!
Well my wig is having a tea party with mars after watching this.

My Queen 😍😍😍
lol beautiful
phenomenal 👊💋
Why do I feel that this too is too short. Cant get enough of this song
Lana sexy girl😍😍
lana is such an underrated and unique artist. there's no one like her. honestly don't know why she hasn't won a grammy. maybe because of that skanky ass cracker bitch taylucifer making a deal w the devil
She is my Idol ❤
Tak best langsung
Lana is for me same as Linkin Park. they saved and saving mu life everyday. Lana you are Queen of the universe! 4ever
Love this song and her Voice *_* <3
What's the name of the song in 3:33 ????????
★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★  ★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★\n*God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n (Just ask Him)
I LOVE U FOREVER LANAAA
I LOVE YOU  LANA💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜!!!!!!!
What is this song even about
....You never got to fly at night bc you were caught up in a daze.
Mum's 88 rolla wagon?
* Me to my sugar daddy : the day I saw your white mustache 🎶🎶🎶 *
whats the song at 3:30 ??? it sounds so familiar.but i can't remember what it was.i know it has to be on her new album but which one?
It was oki until the funny  whistles happened
0:00 oh, i love this song
I must say, I this album is breaking my heart. Not sure if that's good or bad. Guess we will see.
I can't listen to White Mustang the same after hearing Best American Record. Don't get me wrong White Mustang is beautiful but it seems unfinished. Best American Record sounds like the full story and it's just beautifully complete. That's just my opinion though.
Find your self Best American Record music video somewhere,,, this white mustang video is bullshiit,,,,\nHuh the love-hate of Lana leaks... loved the leak, but hate that she really didnt release the song, but throws out the video anyway, summer bummer lana :(
❤❤❤
😍
I cannot stop watching this video Lana, you slay girl, (like always)
LANA IS SO FUCKING PRETTY OMG 😍
I love lana
😍😍😍😍
I like this song! 😏🎶
How is you so pretty😭😭😭 LOVE YOU❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE YOU.... UR MAKING ME SO EMOTIONAL.... I HOPE I GET A WOMEN LIKE YOU...
I know this is early, but are you bringing Nicki Star Tip back for this Halloween?! I LOVED HER 😍
Hellooo this cake is AMAZING you are so much talented, hello from Belgium!😊☺❤😃😀😘
WATAMELON
Try the Japanese cheesecake
Would be extremely cool if nick opens a cupcake cafe/Pop up store x everyone would live for those gorgeous cupcakes & cakes !! 💖
NICK!! i have a burning question: are you never triggered/annoyed by the crumbs or the sauces (anything liquid really) drip through the crevasses on your table (or work bench or whatever you call it)? like how do you clean it... (im huge fan of your creations btw!!)
do a collab with Rosanna!
This is #watermelongoals 🍉🍉🍉🍉
Still waiting on PEACH, dude!
His creations are so unique, cute, and impressive, and I love how his personality shines through in his work. If he doesn't already it'd be too cool if he opened up his own little bakery.
here since 20k...but i always forgot to subscribe rip
you are making good
Who actually watches this and makes it im just here to crave sugar.
Halo top
Nic's FREAKSHAKE brings all the views to the yard.... He could teach you, but he'll have to charge.... $30 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everything you put out is so amazing and looks gorgeous.
Can you made smores macarons and plis continue making freakshakes cupcakes i love them, love your decorations, especially the ones with the donat lol
Looks good I'm new to your channel
This is the perfect Halloween treat to hand out on the South Side of Chicago next month. Just don't put them in a big bowl, leave them on the porch, and tape a please take only one sign. You might cause a gang war over who gets the most watermelon cupcakes
Any suggestions for substitutes for all of the milk products?
Why does the butter look like cheese
There's a cupcake in my home made of watermelone
That's a neat mixer
I just want to stick my finger in that hole.
omg yaaaaaaaaasssss!!! <333
Omfg, don't worry sweetie. Rosanna Pansinos children fans always do this, they accuse people of copying her when they didn't at all or because it was never her original work to begin with! They legit do this ALL THE TIME. They did this to Ann Reardon with the unicorn cake that was never Rosannas original creation to begin with. Who knew watermelon flavor cake in the summer is copying someone lol. P.S, your cupcake is way cooler and more creative!
I just love you. You are beautiful and amazing
Hi , your videos are really good . Maybe next time you could try rainbow marshmallows meringues cupcake ?
ur editing is awesome (small youtuber admirer here) I spend more time on my thumbnails then I do on my videos. Maybe I need to reverse that
Do u need the Greek yogurt?
Loved this video
What A Cupcake!

Omg nick this is so beautiful keep it up
I love this even though I say im gonna make this I never do who else can relate
Nice cupcake!! Now, can you cake it? I mean turn it into one of your high-level cakes, not making a giant version of it.
I love your accent. It makes my day and your videos so much better 😬😁
I love the way you say choc chip! \nCan you make a Chai latte freak shake with TimTams on top? I did the TimTam slam with chai tea and it was AMAZING!
You are trending right now 9:12 pm est USA
Omg, you should make cake like this!
That looks insane!!! And yummy!

Yummmn
Do you spray paint your table a different colour every video or what!
Looks amazing but I wouldn't know where to start eating it?! xD
8.4k and trending.  🤔
This cupcake is identical to the chocolate and mint freak shake cupcake, just a different flavor. Not complaining though. O love watermelon.
After all this look-all-the-same-doll-cakes, I'd love to see your version of a doll-cake... I imagine an explosion of crazy colours and glitter, sparkles, sprinkles and gold and maybe some beyonce-ness... 😍😊😍
Why do you call them freakshakes
why is your salt pink?
Please collab with rosanna pansino please
Just out of curiosity, are you using pink sea salt?
Summer is not almost over. I live in micigan and monday will be the begining of the 3ed week of school
Where can i leave the suggestion on a cupcake
OMG!! Looks so GOOOOD! I am in love
17k views and trending? Gotcha
No Walter Melons were harmed during the making of these cupcakes
Im early
And so it just so happens I like to boogie I like to hip hop all day I need a goblet yea that's how you should drink your favorite beer ho ho ho a banana goes great in a salad I work at the bank all day I'm lucky!
THE FUNNIEST PART WAS WHEN THE GRANDMA SAID, Momma godda smack dat!
Maybe bar b q or maybe burrito...HAHA
I wish this was a real show!
Is this the real plot of the show?
was this really part of the real story? or drama started now.why not using same voice.
do the new Steven King's IT. please?
This pisses me off cuz I want this to be a show now,  and I'll never see it
Narcos was good but I wanna watch this show
Best video of the year........Have my subscription u fellaz
I love this BLR film. 😂😂😂😂😂
When is it coming out?
How much weed does it take to make one of these?
Can you do The Princess Bride next? Maybe?
Never trust an edited comment.
Wut is the actual story to narcos?
This is better than season 3!
No art is complete without a song.\nI want a boogie!
OH HEY MEXICAN FOOD
YES!!!
feel that pinch?
This deserves and Emmy
That really impressed me.
'Momma need to hit that lmfaooo🤣
fantastic
The editing was so good for the trailer style effect.
This is a damn masterpiece.
Genius! BLR really created something Epic here. Taking a TV show like Escabor and creating a false spin off in a Movie Trailer. That is funny, makes since and will make you real for the main character. This was Amazing!
Is nobody gonna talk about 1:32
I would legitimately watch this if it was an actual show.
I feel like this show would have one of those moments where 2 people who look alike are about to get shot they say they're the real one
Mommy needs to hit that😮😂😂😂😂😂
I would actually watch this and be happy about it
U guys should do a BLR if Nacho Libre.
I fuckin love how you turned this spoof into a movie trailer for one of those typical corny,disguise/action movies from the early 2000s.. the music gave it away lol
I'd for real watch this if this is the plot. But it's not so.. oh well.
Stupid Mexicans killed the director.
I love this. You somehow made this historical fiction on a violent cartel, a comedy. I would definitely watch an actual show like this.
Not that funny i miss the trump videos thoes were the best BRING TRUMP BACK
This is so incredible what the HECK
When you start watching a BLR video for funny one liner jokes and it ends up being a an emotional fleshed out story.
Maybe barbeque or maybe burrito   -> The best one xD
man i forgot this was a bad lip reading for a sec, and i really thought this was a thing... and i really wanted to see this.
Come on @Netflix , This is what we want. A comedy called: “soy Pablo” produced by the bad lip reading squad
this is the funniest thing ive seen in 1 year
Damn... This was somehow a parody + a heartwarming trailer... *_*
I want this movie - now! LOL!
Never really thought love have much of a point. But I was wrong, it has a thousand points. Wow, that's actually quite beautiful.
Where's watch out ronaldo song we need it
LOL I will never be able to see Narcos the same way ever again.
Can someone please make this into a real movie?
Mama need'a hit that
Jelly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like it.
Now I am going to be disappointed when the story doesn't flow like this, you guys did a good job I want to see THIS movie.
This is really good LOL
Way better than the original show.
Why do I want to see this movie? Lol
‘Narcos’ locations manager shot dead while scouting in Mexico \n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/narcos-locations-manager-killed-scouting-mexico-article-1.3500168
This type of movie needs to be made. It's amazing.
Man this is amazing.. this plays like a really long trailer to a heart-warming family comedy. One I would watch
That would be such a great Movie ;)
One of my favorites to date 😂
This is probably the best BLR yet.
Is “Soy Pablo” becomes a real show, I would definitely watch it. Netflix, pick this up!!
Song at the end?
Dang I looked at the camera. \n\nFourth wall is nonexistent
This idea would actually make a great movie! Remember those silly comedies like Top Secret and Hot Shots, etc.? Something like that combined with a film like Dave or Moon Over Parador -- that's what this could be for real.\nI love how BLR is getting more sophisticated and creating whole stories.
Is that the trailer cause I'm going to begin whatching it
I actually thought this was a real episode xD
I would much rather watch that storyline than the one in the trailer for the real Narcos I just watched.
I want to watch this entire show in BLR
An indy feel good movie for sure.
😁😁 I would watch this movie 😂😂😂😂😂
I would watch that if you made that, that was awesome
I'm not able to watch the original series now. This guy seems like a fat, goofy and clumsy but somehow sympathic guy and not like a drug cartel boss
Superb! And better than the original show too, I should imagine.
Do Haim's Want you back video!
Anyone know the song that starts at 5:58. Also this is the most amazing trailer I've ever seen.
Oh man damn funny!!!!
maybe bbq or maybe burrito. 😂
Maybe bbq or maybe burrito\nLMAO
This got surprisingly emotional
Dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd\n\nBbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
LOL
RIP
Brilliant!
yombah
You guys should do an NBA bad lip reading
*Still one of the best channels on Youtube. No gimmicks needed.*
Nice vid... Seya in a month
PLEASE DO CAMP ROCK PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE

Ugly girl

This is probably the millionth fenty video I'm watching 
You picked the ame shades in the Match Stix and Killawatt  as I did  but I am shade 300-320 lol a TRUE medium-tan gal.
Looks lovely Fleur
Always reliable reviews! Thanks Fleur! That lip gloss looks amazing.
LOVED the casual setup! :)
Love your videos 😘
love it
You are my favorite You Tuber!!! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗
Love your nail color
£6&10 p&p !!!
I love it that you are so honest but beauty products xx \n theoctoberedit.blogspot.com
My foundation Shade is NW 15 for MAC. What Shade would suit me best? I live nowhere near a Harvey Nicholes :(
Your skin looks so beautiful and float with this collection!!
You're so pretty!! Love this review and look
Such a shame about the foundation colour. I'm excited to see how the products work on my skin. Thanks for the review! Xx
What's that nail polish? Looks amazing <3
Looks like the perfect foundation shade for me so at least you've helped someone find the right shade even though you've lost money haha! Thankyou! X
Brill video! What nail polish have you got on here Fleur? I love the colour! 💜 xxx
Hi! What nail polish are you wearing? I love it!!!
Love the stripes and dungarees combo ❤
I loved how chill this video was! And your review was soooo helpful - I was also hesitant to spring for another celeb range but now I totally want to try out a few pieces!
HI Fleur you look lovely!  Sprinklyofglitter tagged you in a baby name tag can you do it? Would love to hear your answers xo C
I definitely have my eye on a few of these products after watching this! Loved the set up of this video, Fleur!
I love the highlighter duo too. Not a big fan of cream products, but might give the cream blusher/highlighter and cream contour a go.
Iv been watching your videos for yours and i really love the old way of reviewing you have bought back, its felt more natural and like heres the products lets talk! Really enjoyed this video , hope you do many more like this!
you are literally glowing throughout your pregnancy!! <3
Rihanna did go an awesome job she SLAYED her products
Did you put blotting sheets in the wrong way around??
Love videos like this! Feels so down to earth and you look stunning!
Great review. I really enjoyed your thoughts and the makeup looked beautiful.
LOVE this more casual chatty video!! xx
Love the set up for this video! So 'at home'. Thanks for your review :)
Actual product review begins at 11:07. You're welcome. GEEZ! SMH
The Estée Lauder cushion what shade did you use please...it looked gorgeous -\nAs are you!!\nThanks for this,found it really helpful.
I know the foundation wasn't the right shade for you, but kinda wish you had kept it on! I've heard the sticks don't pair particularly well with the foundation formula and wanted to hear your thoughts on it aside from color match!
You look stunning!!! Natural beauty+pregnancy glow= beyond words beauty! Fleur you look lovely, and by far the best/most honest reviwe I've seen so far! Lots of love! Xx Tatty
Hi Fleur do you think the Fenty primer is better then the Two Faced Hangover one?
I love this sort of video! You're so gorgeous but I must say, I'm still not excited by this brand. It seems expensive but cheap...
I always trust your reviews... I tried the gloss on my hand at Sephora , the smell is amazing! It's so pretty.
This is my favourite video of yours in ages. It was a really professional review, IMO. I really like how you gave candid first impressions of the good and bad of each product, whether or not you ended up liking or disliking them. I feel like it was really honest and helpful! I agree with the others, as well: I'm not sure if you've changed your lighting or hair colour, but you're looking extra stunning in yourself here, too. Keep it up!
Great video! The casual vibe, the fact that you paid for the products, watching you apply it like in the old days, all of it! Loved it!
Honestly i loved this style of video!
It wasn't Rihanna fans rushing to the stores to get some, it's the POC finally having their shades.
I don't know if this is true but I have heard that the foundation oxidises to a few shades darker x
Hey Fleur! There have been too many beauty videos lately... At least for me... How about some bags? Shoes? Thanks!
Really love this review, very genuine.....more less planned videos in the future 👍👌
Your pregnancy really suits you! You're stunning! <3
Great video, I fully expected to hear you hating the products because I tend to associate you with higher end brands and products. I really love that you got excited as a consumer and I agree that your video seems to be the most unbiased so far! Love the laid back feel too! Xx
The blotting paper looks like rizla skins and a rolling machine for joints 😂😂😂😂
1) your excitement is contagious, 2) your make up afterwards looks BEAUT, 3) girl, that t-shirt and dungarees are a LOOK
dont think u knew how to pull the blotting paper out because ive seen others do it just fine ..
Where are your dungarees from? x
Loved this video. Loved how long it was and informal. Just chilling it with a friend style.
you literally have a holiday glow with this ! <3
great review. really thorough and well-explained. your word choice is so specific and accurate. keep it up!
I really liked this old style video with a classic review and try on. Looks great and now I would love to go out and pick up that lipgloss! :)
I realize this video was a little on the spontaneous side; that being said, I REALLY enjoyed it. It felt very authentic and had a nice, relaxing vibe. This video was a great example of how you don't need to go all out to make quality content. If the enthusiasm is there, the rest will follow. \nOn a slightly unrelated note, I don't know what it is about this particular video, but you really looked like Hannah in some parts of it. I've never really thought that before. Obviously, I've noticed the familial similarities, but I've never looked at the both of you together and thought, twin moment. For the record, that was meant to be a compliment. You both are beautiful gals!
Really love this style of video, Fleur! Please do more first impression/live haul type videos. xx
Loved this video Fleur! I find that I prefer videos like this (you called it raw). I like it without a studio or studio lighting etc. It feels more natural and less produced and therefore more real. I hope more youtubers go back to this style of video. I want to feel like a friend is telling me about products, not selling me some on HSN. Great job and you look fab!
Fleur, do you still have the London apartment?
LOVE this style of video! You're glowing and look absolutely stunning!!!
I don't think I'm going to indulge in this line myself, but it does look lovely. And I loved the more relaxed, hands-on review style -- both informative and casual, like a (circumstantially one-sided) conversation with a friend!
Might have to get the lip gloss!!
What's your nail color? It's so pretty!
Love this - you should do more first impression videos!
Totally random, but what colour / brand nail polish are you wearing??? Its gorgeous!! x
please do more first impressions just like this! casual, honest, no big production required, just a good solid chat... loved it!
Your skin looks incredible!! Please please do a cushion foundation best and worst! X
The contour colour looks amazing on you!
I'm glad u gave it a good review! I wasn't hyped about the line either BUT once I found out what was in the range, my interest was peaked! I only purchased the lippie and primer. They were out of my foundation and I can't buy anymore highlighters until I've used up what I have. Seriously, how many do u actually need?!?! Ultimately, I'm pleased to see that u liked it bcuz as a black woman, the range of foundations for us is  UNHEARD OF. We still don't have a STRONG market catering to us and our beauty with ALL its many shades. So, I think THAT is really what the hype was about. Black women/girls felt like, FINALLY, someone thought exclusively about US! It's not so much about Riyanna (did I spell that right?) and if my Caucasian, and Asian sisters don't understand that, then you've missed the whole point. #bravo Fleur!
Loved the style of this vid xx
I feel like you match exactly my colouring! Hope you get to try the foundation in the right shade one day
Loved the style of this video, very natural X x
Tear the blotting paper against the blade from one side to the other instead of ripping it :)
Love this video Fleur! So different for you, in a good way 😊 you also look absolutely beautiful! X
Are you going to get a foundation that matches for a second review?
Oh my goodness I love love loved this video! I enjoyed the more relaxed vibe you had going on and you are looking so beautiful. Love to you, Mike & all your fur children! Xx
I hope your read this, but I'm in love with your tragus piercing. Would you mind sharing where you got it? It's so cute!
Your skin looks amazing 😍 pregnancy is really working for you! Are you going to try another shade of foundation? Would be good to hear your opinion of your shade, also love the casualness to the video xxx
I wish you used the white because I haven't seen a review with it yet
very nice video, good review :)
your skin looks amazing in this Fleur! <3
You should never buy makeup online , you should always try it first on your face (physically go to the shop)  , because when you buy online it always ends up being lighter or darker in real life.
I really appreciate your review and POV!
I have never been drawn to packaging. I don't get that. When shopping for make-up I don't look at packaging at all. Coz what does it help when the product itself is sh**?
Loved this video!! I would have thought, though, that this brand was made by the same guys who did Kim K's line!  I dunno if I'm too sold on many of the products -- I might try the highlighter!
Love the autheticity, you are for sure the best looking wife doing stuff around the house 😉 love your videos and I love the pregnany content and home vlogs/weekend vlogs with mike the most 😊 👫🐕💖
I love how realistic you are in the video & review
I wanted to say thank you for doing this!  A lot of vloggers who are not women of color are turning their noses up at this. Thank you for doing this for your colorful audience!
what shade are you in estee lauder double wear cushion?
Turn the blotting tube upside down (tooth side down) then rip. As opposed to ripping up upward. Side note, love your nail color 😍
Which colour you have in the Estee lauder cushion foundation .😄
i've missed the tutorials ! :)
Really REALLY loved this style of video, including the natural looking lighting. It seemed very spare of the moment and I got the feeling you weren't planning on putting the makeup on to start with. Something about it just seems so natural and friendly (not saying you aren't always friendly 😁) keep them coming and I hope you are keeping well xxx
Fleur's reviews are the best reviews 💕
Fleur one of the perks of this Fenty Beauty range is that it has the same initials as yours ! That's so cool !
I think I know what I will buy now as I wasn't sure which products to go for. Thanks for the review.
To all those comparing this to Book of Life:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX7bfDT_Yok
Who else has ever tuned a guitar with a pair of pliers?
I can already tell this is going to be one of their lowest rating films ever!
Is this a sequel to The Book of Life?
This is just like book of life! They even have the same concept of being forgoten and being lost
I can't wait for this movie it looks so good !
when there is nobody left in the living world to remember you, you disappear well dang
Ugh this is such a blantant ripoff of monsters inc.
I wasn't expecting they use Bittersweet Symphony for the trailer.
They're remastering the book of life already?
This really reminded me of that other movie book of life
What in the world is that multi color panther thing supposed to be?
YEAH THERE IS NO WAY SKELETON HAVE A NOSE LIKE THAT _)@
0:04 the momment you do something and somebody into Your room ( bad english sorry )
I really liked Book of Life, this one looks promising as well!
The next level of book of life movie
This..... movie better break records and CRUSH the box office DO YOU HEAR ME!? this better be as good as their old greeaaat  no AMAZING movies,..................................................................................................................................................................and Pixar pleeeease I beg of thee don't screw this up.
Can't wait to see COCO😂😀 n hey. Whatch out for the chancla😂😁😘😘
The kid probably is gonna be transgender 🙄
I just want to know what song is playing in the background of this trailer. I feel like I know it / recognize it, but I can't put my finger on it.
My god Pixar, I mean this is gorgeous. Every Pixar film is amazing or at least decent (Accept Cars 2) but my god this takes animation to a whole new level I'm mostly excited for Pixars coco there first musical.
I'm excited to watch the movie
Wasn't the main character from book of life also not allowed to play music even though he wanted to?
the Verve always gives me chills
there should be cholos in this movie
I AM H Y P E ABOUT THIS LATINO/A REPRESENTATION
But like...\nWhy do disney mkvies stick to the formula of a young character wanting to be/do something and then having their parents stop that goal in the first act, but are then redeemed in the second or third act; where the parents reveal thry do it out of love? Moana did this with her not being allowed to explore, brave did this with merida wantibg to not be a princess, mulan the same thing, nemo wanting to explore ect. I like how this has a spirited away thing going on (though not wholly otiginal either (corpse bride))
Visually this movie looks beautiful. I might go see it.
Pixar's First Movie Musical. Can't wait!!!
Looks like a beautiful movie
I hope they make bendy and the ink machine the movie
Two movies take place in Japan\n*People say nothing*\n\nTwo place take place in Mexico\n*IT'S JUST LIKE BOOK OF LIFE!!!*
Sooo if you disappear once no one remembers you, does that mean Hitler would live forever? Because he's going to be in history books for a long time....
My Sunday school teacher is an animator for Pixar and has been working on this movie. I can't wait to see it.
I only hope this lives up to its predecessor: The Book of Life
The first time I've seen a xoloitzcuintli in a movie
Finally a Coco comment section that ISN'T full of BoL fans calling it a ripoff.\nEdit:  nvm apparently people still think it's a ripoff
That dog makes me lose my bejeezers
When does this take place?
Damn the book of life 2 looks
It seems that they changed the music to appeal to American audiences. The previous trailers had Mariachi music and now this one has The Vervepipe. More people should learn to appreciate music from different cultures.
Marco is that you?
Looks an awful lot like Book of Life. Like, a LOT. I seriously doubt Pixar are not aware of this.
Looks like a great movie!  Can't wait to see it!  I just hope Disney doesn't turn it into a ride, because it will probably make a horrible ride.
This looks really good. Buuuut it also looks really similar to the Book of Life so yeah. I think the only way I can feel confident in judging if it's copying that one is if I watch them both, so I'll definitely be watching this movie.
Can you have camila cabello singing a song
I see Pixar\nMy heart fills with happiness
What a nice advertisement for the book of life!!
Cool! Just come to the US legally and we will have no problem whatsoever :)
Is this book of life 2? Lol
Also is that an alibreje creature? Awesome just like in Legend quest
I see a strange similarity between this movie and The Book Of Life.
Can I just say I am grateful my mother hasn't hit me with a chancla yet, she has about five pairs sitting on a rack...
Oh god another musical... Thank god I don't have kids so I won't be forced to watch this.
It has uncanny resemblance with The Book of Life.
Amazing, just amazing. Pixar always does a great job. This ain't an exception.
Can't wait for book of life 2, though..This one has a lot less style. Hmm..
This looks really cute, but the storyline is cliche. Some kid wants to follow his forbidden dream, goes on a journey, proves to his family that his dream is actually good, etc. etc.
This film is definitely going to win an oscar next year
Book of life was a good movie. And they know that.
Now Disney will get rich off Mexican culture
The book of life?
wow I love the book of life
Will they be taking part in the Skeleton War?
What's the name of the song
Is this supposed to be a Disney/Pixar Book of Life version kinda thing
*Comment complaining about a comment that doesn't exist*
I AGREE WITH THE YOUTUBE-LIKERS, I WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE CALLED: DISNEY PIXAR COCO THE 2017 COMEDY MOVIE TOO!!!!!!!    :-D
This is legit Bopk of Life wannabes
LA CHANCLA
#waw
*cough cough book of Life cough cough*
Iamaginagooooooooo
Wheres incredibles 2 at tho
This remind anyone else of Kubo.

Looks weird
VIVA LATINOAMERICA CARAJO
We can have more than one dia de los muertos movie
Book of life 2 looks great
oh look the book of life had a baby
Jesus loves you so much and that love he has for you is overwhelming and is like your the only person in all existence that he loves. I'm taking prayer request and if you have questions about God I'm here. I know this video isn't about God but I wrote this in the hope I'll help someone. I'm not trying to push or force my faith on anyone, It's just a friendly offering. Also I have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested. God bless you and have a great rest of your year!:)
Does Disney do any films about black people?
Don't mind me. I'm just waiting for The Incredibles 2 trailer to drop. :)
Isn't it pretty much a copy of the book of life but in more modern times
What's the title for the background music?
So this is the short that plays after Frozen 2: Olaf's Big Adventure?
Cuando se estrenará?
Star shoes looks cheap

I would not keep them, they're gorgeous, but so specific I wouldn't wear them over and over... I don't know, you go to much more events than I do hahahaha
Keep the star shoes. They're gorgeous! On the other hand, those Balenciaga boots look really pointy and weird, I feel like you could invest your money on something better😊
keep the star shoes, return the sock boots hahaha
I always feel rude when I'm doing anything and they are working on my hair. I won't even touch my phone. And I feel like I have to make small talk with them. Thus I dread going to hairdresser! I actually hate it. I wish I could just cut my own hair if I could. But u seem to love it! So that's great!
Love your mom. So graceful! 😍
Your mum is lovely!
Kkkkkeeeppp the Star shoes!!!!!!!!!

Do you ever find yourself copying your mom's styles and stealing some of her pieces? I LOVE HOW MY MOM DRESSES AHHH!!! (to be fair, my mom takes some of my clothes as well LOL)
KEEP THE STAR SHOES!!
The shaft/upper of the boots is so  flattering and hugs your legs, but I question why the toe box is so super pointy, but you wear many skirts and I could see you getting use/many wears out of them in especially fall/winter!
I loved this vlog ❤️ You're so natural in front of the camera!
You should show these to FleurDeForce.
@amelia keep the aquazura shoes there silver and goes with so much
Literally just gasped over the beauty of those star heels!!! KEEP THEM!!!!!!
Those boots are giving me such cruela de ville vibes!!!! Like I think those are the exact same 😳😬🙊

Keep the stars, get rid of the sock boots
The star shoes are a must. Keep!!

Hello dear, looking amazing as usual..I love your watch can you tell me where you got it please? Thank you :) keep shining
OMG the thumbnail for this video had your hair looking that grey color so many are going and I was worried cause you are too warm for that.
I need to start wearing skirts more often gosh!!!
This was one of my favourite vlogs!!!
Loved,loved your vlog 😍😍and please do a house tour of your friends apartment. It looks like every girls dream. I am always confused of your house,do you have two kitchens?

I think we all need a Bathroom Cabinet video featuring your mothers bathroom cabinet haha! But honestly I remember that one video we got a sneak peak and it was so cool!
Loving the Givenchy bag!! House tour please✋👌✋👌✋👌✋
Aww! Best wishes to Natasha!! She is always so sweet in your vlogs, over the years!! Xoxoxo 🙏🏼☺️🙌🏼💙
Your look so beautiful in this vlog, love your new hair, eye makeup without wing liner and that skirt, so pretty!
I love that depiboo took your hair darker for fall.... autumn?.... fall. Fall sounds better 😂 It looks incredible anyway, as does the tan skirt. The knife boots make me think of Devil Wears Prada and those star shoes though 😍😍😍
any small YouTubers want to be friends ?❤️❤️
Love you Amelia ;) Always great to see you sweet heart 💕And Loooove your new hair xxx
Love the shoes, dislike the boots. Your mom's so sweet.
I thought I spotted some pastel pink! Looks very beautiful!!
Okra and eggplant tray bake. Snap off the tips of okra, slice eggplant in half, brush with oil and bake! (Or roast, whatever)
Keep the star shoes!!!!!!
Oribe = Oar-bae  :)  According to my hairdresser when I pronounced it Oh-reeb.  I do wish you would feature your mother more.  She is more my demographic and I would to hear her beauty and hair tips.  I may have to start a letter writing campaign for her to start her own channel.
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\n50,000 Views in 2 Day = 17 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?
The Aquazzuras are SUCH A KEEP! They're a classic silhouette with a fun twist. Love.
I feel like buying stuff online with the mindset of just being able to return isn't v considerate of yer carbon footprint and the environment. Just something to consider if you care!
I love your accent, I need it as an app on my phone that delivers bad news cause it's so calming!\n\nI remember going to a conference once and they got 20 of us round in a circle to share ideas of how a certain idea could be improved. There was a girl using a BSL interpreter to communicate and the general lack of awareness from most of the group (although I'm sure they didn't mean it) was bothering me.\n\nIt was one of those conversations where one person would stop talking and then somebody would immediately jump on their point as soon as they stopped speaking and the combo of not knowing when to speak and trying to pay attention to her interpreter basically meant that this girl wasn't really getting a chance to say anything. At one point I managed to make an opening for her (Is there anything you'd like to add?) but it made me appreciate how difficult that situation must be when trying to get involved.
Hi dear, do you find it harder to lip-read foreigners, who don't usually talk English?
Do you have a name sign Jessica?
I'm getting major Dorothy (Wizard of Oz) vibes from this outfit! Loving it! ❤️  Also, I can't believe people actually do this stuff. But your reactions to their ignorance are great. especially the crutch example.
Typical brit problem; I can't tell when you're being sarcastic! Feel free to use your phone (you arse), yes please!.
I am very lucky to not be fully deaf. I have moderate-profound hearing loss in my right ear and mild-moderate loss in my left ear. Its much lonelier than a lot of people realize. On my first day of college last week our tutor decided it would be a great idea to split us into pairs and talk to each other as a way to get to know other people in the class except when everyone was talking at the same time there was so much noise that I couldn't distinguish one voice from another and so I couldn't communicate with anyone. I was the loneliest person in that room. \nAlso I have almost become intolerant of people who insist on speaking to me softly even though they know I'm deaf and I'm already on my third 'what?'
I say things in the wrong tone too and offend others without realizing it, but it's because I grew up in two different cultures. I also love some good gossip once in a while,  haha. I think you should make a video of some of these wrong tone incidences you've had in the past!
I love these tips so much, thank you for sharing! You are a doll! ❤️❤️
You're an amazing person. Thank you for this incredibly informative video. It's really helpful and important!
Hi 👋🏻 Jessica that is really good things too know! I learnt a little sign language on a 10week course so I know a little but it's great to pick up signs from your videos too! Looking forward to your videos next week too! ☺️x
Thank you, Jessica, this is very helpful. Glad to know a notebook or cellphone might ease communication. Eye contact and heightened facial expression are good ideas. Can't believe some people 'test' your hearing by covering their lips - so rude.
I feel like a convo between the two of us in any public place would be a comedic disaster 😂😂😂 With my autism, I get overwhelmed easily, can't separate background noise from conversations I'm in, and can get really spacey (it's actually a mild dissociation to protect myself). This also leads to me starting and not finishing sentences, suddenly forgetting I'm being spoken to, and completely losing track of a conversation 😬 I feel like our spouses would just be sitting there like what are they even doing?! Do THEY even know?! 😂
I love your videos! Growing up in had a friend (sarah) who was deaf and I got a basic sign language book and it was a great bonding experience with Sarah and she taught me games like writing a word on each other's back with our finger and guessing what the other wrote just by what we felt. I really learned a lot from her. I was in a sport with her and as we got older she moved away and life went on. Wish we had kept in touch. You are doing a great job educating people on what the world is like for you and how most of all you just want to be included. I hate that you get the some of the responses you do. But keep up the good work and I wish you and your wife all the best!!!!
This is so incredibly useful! I especially appreciated the bit about it not being rude to pull out your phone and communicate that way if necessary. I might be hesitant to do that, afraid of offending someone, so it was good to know that you consider it perfectly fine. Also, I hadn't been aware that International Week of the Deaf was approaching, so thank you for drawing attention to it!
Plz plz plz check out my bsl videos it would mean the world to me I have a cover on my channel xx
I start my sign language class in two weeks and I can't wait!
Love all your videos! Relate so much to this... 5 is the worst, people will always whisper and ask if I can hear it. I have never thought of 9 but I always get a little sad after I have asked twice and they just give up. Like no I just can't hear you but I would love to know what you actually said having them use their phone will be very helpful.
Hello, I don't know any deaf people,  but useful things to know for when I do.\nIn other news,  my sponge rollers and lotta body arrived today. Tonight is the night. Wish me luck, I shall need it!! 😂💪🦄
Thank you for this video! As a spouse of a deaf person this covers a lot of what I am constantly telling other people about my hubby.
Learning key signs and the alphabet goes a long way! I'm hearing but I'm learning ASL and I used to attend a deaf club where hearing people could go to practice with HOH and deaf people and knowing basics signs/the alphabet was a saving grace.\n\n(Also now, I'm learning BSL because of you!! 💙)
Does Claudia know how to sign, Jessica? If you don't mind me being cheeky...what is sign for the bog? 😜 Happy International Week of the Deaf!
Thank you so much for today's topic, can relate to every item you spoke of. I sometimes do so well acting hearing ( like you, I do the hearing behavior without thinking) people forget I don't hear, and if I do not hear them then they think I am not paying attention( grrrr). Someone knowing a few important signs is wonderful! I have a question -  When you speak a word incorrectly, do your hearing friends ever correct you? If so how do you respond to this? Thank you again for sharing your list.
Is it rude to tap deaf people on the shoulder to get their attention? I've just made friends with somebody who's deaf and wasn't sure whether that was the best way to involve her in a conversation when she's sat in her own world?
Your sass makes this video! I never thought to give facial expressions to my voice to express my tone or attitude. Very informative wonderful video!
Great video Jessica. All I will add is that if people do some of the ruder points then I'm not sure I'd call them friends... I can't believe someone would actually cover their mouth for example and ask if you can hear them now! I suppose they're they same people who would take the mickey out of someone who stutters. 😕
This is really good for other people who have friends who are deaf or who work with them I've started my BSL level 1 and both teachers are deaf so these tips are going to be really helpful for when I'm communicating with them and any deaf people I meet xxx
I relate so much! I love your sassiness girl <3
Love your smile.
This is so interesting, i wouldn't have thought of these things! At least now i know what to do when i meet someone who is deaf :) thanks!
Great points 🌸🌹🌼
Great to know!!
Once again NZ is backwards to the rest of the world - our week of the deaf is in May. Im actually curious how you would deal with someone like me who stammers (or goes completely non-verbal at times) due to some of my mental health issues. Me and My ex used to spend a lot of time speaking through text because of it, and its why I started learning NZSL.
I hoping to start my level 3 Signature course next month. Will have to be online as my local college only goes up to level 2. I'm in Cornwall and the closest 3 course is Bristol or Wales 😩
The sound keeps cutting in and out and I don't know if there's an ironic issue with my phone or with YouTube or if it's part of the point of this video... 🤔
How's it going guys can you check out my music and show some support, thanks
Ay he can sing too, I had no idea lol.
i love dis sooo much.... but i smell green day a bit here...😰\nbut still it's good
Who tf would let him go?😍
You should sing more often man.. you dope as fuhk man....
MGk killed it with his unique style
When MGK rocking that safety pin makes me want to get pierced lol
Video of this song was expected to be romantic 😥
Are we in 2006 again
New audience for MGK and I think he is going to do just fine 👍🏻👍🏻
He would be a really good actor ☺️

Holy shit can u say SOLD THE FUCK OUT!  Wow!!! Sorry Mgk , you lost a lot of cool points.!

This voice>>>>>>>
EST19XX 🌹🖤
https://youtu.be/nZyl7MTWUgU WATCH MY MUSIC VIDEO SHIT LIT ASF HOE
Does he have any more songs with this style?
Hey guys! My name is Malik Charles...im really tryna get my music heard and would appreciate any support! I make music about love,life,pain and try my best to reach all people. Please take a listen... https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
wish you didnt change.. miss the mohawk and hard rap\nbut
is that alex jones
But I like it a little 😼
is this his amber rose break up song?
Leave it to Machine to kill shit
I'm favorite, omg I love it so much
People treat the dislike button like it entitles them to be a critic of the content of any video...
Could use without the manager.
School boy Lachine gun? Wth is this?
one day, pretty soon I hope I make a song with him!! I love him so much!! 💖💖
He kinda looks like Luke Hemmings to me 😭
Yall should check out TECH N9NE. If you like this
Um... Green day- Boulevard of broken dreams ??????????🤔
Holly shit he's hot
Why why why just 1.6 million wwwhhhyyy 😢😭😭😭💔 the song his voice everything was fucking perfect
I love this song so catchy
What's wrong with the MGK fanbase is that because he puts out so many different styles of music, his fans are constantly at war with each other over what style is better. Nobody considers the fact that he's not a one trick show and doesn't limit himself to one specific genre like most artists out there. He's punk, hip-hop, rap, a little alternative, r&b, and he's evolving his style in all of those categories. So don't come here just to say I like the old Kells better or His old music was better or some shit like that cuz you ain't no fan.
This song sounds like it would be in these highschool movies at the beginning after summer lmfaoo   😂💀
check me out
Always MGK 💖😍
My fav♥️
I like different
FUCKING AMAZING MGK!!!!! 💯💯👌👊💙💜💖
Just made delicious marshmallow red velvet cupcakes on my baking channel, come check it out! @Kool Cakes
Great job
ME ENCANTAAA
💋💋💋💋
MGK GO NORMAL REP !!!
Probably my fave MGK
He look like Brooklyn Beckham
Nickelback vibe
This shit fucking lit 🔥
This is so sad 😂
Ok, so how did White Extremism become a thing in the Pacific North West? I thought that the PNW was a Bastion of Progressive Culture. I was taught that Racism was a Southern thing. Is that not true? Is it possible that there are Northern States that are more racist than the South? Shut my mouth and call me cornpone!
No promises re: punching people in the face.
Is this comedy, or a Democrat campaign?
I hate full frontal, it leaves nothing to the imagination.
Does anyone realize that Oregon is so liberal that you can't even fill a vehicle gas tank yourself? you have to have a trained gas attendant.
Ok so what happens when this former neonazi loses their job or their girlfriend leaves them? I feel like a plan that rotates around making sure white guys never suffer any hardship is not the most long term thing I've ever seen.
But not to proud, that's what got us here in the first place. Oh I fell over laughing 😂
I want to see what criteria the use to say their have only been 6 left terror attacks I guess antifa doesn't count cause I personally can name more than 6 also didn't a left wing nut job just shoot a bunch of Republicans was that 1 of the 6
Where is the documentation, proof, studies, polls, records, etc... that white supremacist groups are the most violent? Have you ever heard of Islam, Antifa, BLM... Both sides have done horrible atrocities but to constantly blame white people is not factual.

The left IS racist AND fascist. They think other races NEED white people to SAVE them and want to control them to submit like pets. The left is racist and fascist!
love cannot exist without hate and hate cannot exist without love
samanthabee.com/lifeafterhate  - link at the end of the episode.
Just had a terrorist attack, but WHITE SUPWEMACISTSSTST!
I'm glad to see a beautiful African american woman fight white supremacy
I'm sure the 1k dislikes didn't watch the show😐\n #LifeAfterHate 😁
most of the facts she pulls from are just provably wrong so I cant even begin to criticize the points shes making
So 2900 americans dead 9 11 by muslims dont count?
When you feel more self-confident there's no one to blame anymore. Such a true and great quote which is the solution to envy and jealousy, I seriously needed that to start my day.
...So out of touch. ...So smug and self-satisfied... *_I don't understand why Hillary lost_*
Sam - flies like a butterfly, stings like a Bee!
WATCH THE GREATEST STORY NEVER TOLD FOR TRUTH!@!
I support the goals of Life After Hate, but the white guilt in this video is kind of nauseating.
that's insane they gutted funding wow
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
The dreamers & Medicare for all please watch https://youtu.be/XRnOdnWtQbc
I would love to meet former white supremacists. I mean that very genuinely. I just want to sit and have a conversation.
Lack of love distorts people, and love is the cure for all evil.
There are black racists, BLM, and white racists, Neos, and brown racists, La Raza.  There will be hate groups...best to join Christians United and promote love.
Useful stuff. \nHonestly I've got mixed feelings on the issue, I think groups like Life After Hate are incredibly useful and important and good. \nAt the same time, plenty of bigots are incredibly violent and dangerous and many have gotten into positions of power and will use that to hurt people, so people do, I feel, have to be willing to rebel or fight back against violence and injustice as well. \nThere's no single perfect solution sadly.
I'll stop punching nazis when they stop threatening me with death.
The terror statistic is BS
Magic video!
ANTIFA?
I just can't like this girl....
More dislikes than comments.. and this is considered trending?
troubled waif......a worrying woman's woman.
She has awesome hand movements.
#Hillaryforprison
Great interviews Sam.
Don't you have some cancer patient to mock?
Camilo sesto
Good going sam!
:)
I truly pity anyone that regularly watches Samatha Bee. You cant be saved at this point.
But where are these terrorists attacks? Where are the reports? Deaths? Injuries? There are constant reports of attacks from leftwing radicals, constant reports of attacks from radical islamists, constant reports of attacks in places like the Philippines from religious radicals.
join interracially against racism on facebook
Sam is so awesome
LOVE!
Samantha Bee for president!
What an evil hag. Why does she get a show?
The propaganda is real.
🏳☮🏳 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLQ_h2kdt0U    PEACE SONG PROJECT, YOU ALSO WATCH AND SHARE, DO SOMETHİNG FOR PEACE... 🏳☮🏳
I'm proud to be white.
Yeah I too dislike those terrorists that dress all black and destroy Berkley... oh wait
Why won't she ever bring up statistics in her propaganda ? Come on Samantha you are on the right side of history. Just talk about the statistics lol. \n\n\n\n\nOh wait. She literally can't.
I love all the links to the studys shes getting all of the numbers from
Hey it's not racist if your black and hate white people, it's only white people who are even capable of racism.\n\nHerrrrrr durrrrr...
What about the terrorists on the left beating people and damaging property.
keep punching nazis
Hate towards cancer patients 🤔
unfunny
Hahahahahahaha \nFakenews \nAmericans are not nearly as racist as we are portrayed by fakenews.
Choke on a bowl of dicks.
1k dislikes?.. Keep going with this stuff Sam clearly we still have a problem..
Meanwhile in Europe...
I really hate this woman... white pride is fabricated... I'm white and know white people and don't hear anything about racist thoughts...the terrorists are the left fuckwads that attack people randomly
Am I supposed to give her my movie ticket?
Why aren't whites allowed to be proud of who we are? Every race has and had bad people, why does every white person have to be held accountable for it?
What about the violent leftists terrorists at Berkeley? Didn't one just stab a woman in the neck because they disagreed with her? You know, the left that's been rioting and sending death threats to a Jew......acting like nazis.
The Nazis of the past were definitely a threat. The Nazis of today, not so much.. They can't even bring proper torches out for a mob, which says a lot about how defanged they are.\n\nThat being said, punching them isn't gonna accomplish nothing. Remember the words of Dr. King Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. For all of you advocating for punching Nazis, I a black man ask you this, has that made less riots and civil disturbances occur less across the nation? Have you truly succeed?
More Alt-Left propaganda... 👎🏿
Trump is a white supremacist racist, just like his white hooded daddy.  End of story.
95% blacks are Savage animals deserve to be put in zoos They ruin schools communities raping pillaging and murdering  basically a walking talking disease like cancer
Genuinely curious if Samantha has done a show on brown nationalism or Islamic supremacy? If one attack in America killing a white person can spark this kind of content then hundreds of attacks by one group, there has to be at least one video. If there is let me know I'd love to watch it and see if I can donate to ending hate towards whites.
Oy vey goyim support non-whites  and have  multiracial children.
Those pesky christians blowing people up
Samantha, now do you see why Trump is POTUS?\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFUIVfKTeVg&list=PLrEnWoR732-BHrPp_Pm8_VleD68f9s14-&index=1
Talking about brainwashed america liberals have destroyed this world
I think we can all agree that Oregon is a terrible place where you can't even pump your own gas.
Thank you Sam for pointing out the blatantly obvious to anyone who can do a google search on terrorism in the USA. People should already know this, but we have to be led by a comedian to actually look at the facts and statistics.
You have a nasty attitude. I can't wait until you ruin your own career. \n\nAnd Trump WON!!!!!
The title should be changed to Life after Modern-Day Liberals. It's essentially the same thing.
Thanks Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.:)
You know if someone wold say the mojordy of the tarist are black it's racist then if you say the same about white people it's not then oh wait that means ur still racist to White people wich we come to the hidden Truth this Sam is racist.
White supremacy isn't a problem here in America and if you think it is you're lagging behind the rest of us
You know how to not solve the problem people? By alienating white males... It's not like they are the one group you need to be working with to come together. It's only going to fuel more racism but keep it up guys let's drag everyone back 60 years to make yourselves feel better about Trump being president. We need to stop awarding people for playing victim or else why would anyone want to change (Hollywood).
Of course YouTube trends more leftist propaganda, you're not even trying anymore Sam, you're just making entire segments out of Salon and HuffPost articles, but your viewers have such cognitive dissonance they don't even care! They're worse than 45 supporters.
I wish BLM supporters would start coming out of the hate closet too.
Nice! Now call out the BLM supramicists and Communist Antifa...oh wait..
It's embarrassing that YouTube puts this as trending with barely 200k views.
What's wrong with you people? All Samantha spews is hate!
*THIS IS ALT-LEFT PROPAGANDA*
Marxist authoritarian trash.
Samantha i pray everyday that you get cancer
Classic racist garbage. Thanks for nothin Samantha Bee. Talk about both sides. AKA BLM. -I hate white supremacists, I hate black supremacists.
You are intellectually dishonest
Boycott Samantha bee. She's a vile screeching cow who blatantly lies and has been coughs lying in almost every episode. Do not trust her for any entertainment or news.
Yet Soros funded haters cannot let go.
Pure propaganda. Sad faggots who watch this

One of the first channels I have subscribed on YouTube and you should feel proud!!! Well deserved.
Hey Marques, just wondering but why is it so hard to find camcorders that specifically mention that they have the ability to shoot 1080p at 60fps? Also is there any that you would recommend? (and no my budget inst too big of a issue either)

Hi
Stop unsubscribing for fun guys 🙄
nice
I'm depressed
Congrats, you deserve it!
Why did they film two piles of garbage for 8 minutes?
All politicians lie. The two parties are two sides of the same coin.
Disagreeing about facts does not make America great, for sure. Does Spicer for example believe that flat earthers make a relevant contribution? Gee!
Lmao...I don't think this fool realizes that he's no longer press sec.
i think im the only guy who doesnt support trump but i still like Spicer and Scaramucci or mafia guy.
how long does Stockholm syndrome last?
He speaks better than I thought.
I have a crush on Spicey. Omg he is soooo cute!
He was NOT elected. He was put into power by the electoral college not the people. Only the Popular vote should count!
Let's not....
Why is the president so concerned with SIZE?
That is the problem w WH administrations, they are fine w lying because none of them actually have to own up to it. Spicey should not get fame. He should crawl back into the bushes forever.
Just because the president (or whoever) tells you to lie, you do not do it!!! It shows your character, not the president's. This is basic ethical behavior.
One of the biggest trumpturds ever right there
His employment exit agreement prohibits him from making disparaging remarks about the Orange one.
So spicy what your saying is, when the orange baboon tells a lie it's your job to perpetuate that lie. Not a very honorable job to have.
He's gathering materials for a book, alright.
Suddenly alternative facts doesn't sound like an oxymoron because it's a matter of how you interpret something.
The joke is on us with this type of character.
Jimmy Kimmel treats the public like little dumb kids when repeatedly asked about the crowd at the inauguration. Yes Jimmy boy we'v got it from the first time!! All of you Hollywood liberal scam are easy to read before even you open your mouth!! Hollywood trash!
currently, we've saved the invisible hamster 9.7 million times
America was built on genocide, slavery, and colonialism. If you can rationalize that, you can rationalize anything. I think, sometimes, we can disagree with the facts. - Sean Spicer -
i  love how stupid russian spam/phishing bots are, using the *.ru*   country code top-level domain for russia
Still a slimy little weasel - my apologies to the real weasels which are actually pretty cute.
I believe the bottom line was he had a job, and he had to do what was necessary to keep it. But someone can only lie for so long about eating the chocolate cake when is in between the teeth and the fingernails
It's pretty cool that Sean Spicer decided to go on Kimmel's show! He had nothing to gain here, and he handled it great.
He's alot more likeable as regular Sean Spicer, he seems happy!
Why is he on this ?????
So many new words!
Service to the country? I think he did the country a disservice. Lying to the people. Misguiding the public. I can't watch this. I'm out guys.
Oh America , this political lacing of all things TV is the end of you all . Try talking instead of labelling .
There goes America again blurring the lines again and making a celebrity out of a liar!
He survived one of the worst jobs ever. ... but I thought he was fired tho... 🤔
He helped spread the obvious lies of Trump and deceive the american people, he should be in prison and sentenced for life, not applauded when walking in to a talk show.
1+1=2 You can't disagree with FACTS.
those of us who worked hard to get him elected  Doesn't that sentence says a lot....? Trump didn't win because he was the best candidate but because people choose the lesser of 2 evil.\nI have ZERO respect for this man and all the others in the WH. They are all in there for their own GREED and corruption
Spicer seems like a good humble nice dude I give em two 👍🏼and a Victoria six pack of 🍻 spicee come watch the fight with us canelo putos!!!
its easy to sit here and scold spicer for sacrificing his integrity and spine the fact is, the situation is a lot more convoluted than that. Spicer took the job to further his political career; nobody could've predicted the SCOPE of the madness that the Trump presidency entailed. I don't think Spicer is AS despicable as Trump and most of his administration.
how ironic when spicer said he was honest with the american people and then said he would say whatever the liar and chief told him to, spicer is nothing but an empty suit who will do or say anything to get a big pay check.
Sometimes you have to disagree with facts  How does one disagree with facts??
Ass clown.  Sorry, disagree with the facts? Size of the inauguration is in dispute?
Let's face it, SPICY is not going to say anything really bad about ol' Scrotum neck till he's out of office.\nTHAT is when we'll get the juicy info & what Spicy REALLY thought of the current Groper in chief.
You ALWAYS have a choice of WHAT to say. The ''im supposed to voice what the president thinks'' argument is BS.
Good job Spicer. Jimmy doesn't know. His feelings are intact.
Don't know how that jerk sleeps at night.
I don't think they allowed him to leave soo easily.
It *was* his job...
His Inauguration crowd was huge and a lot was blocked by protesters too, it wasn't easy to get in when it was really early.
Fuggg Spicy..\nHe should go into hiding along with his\n  Alternative Facts \n          ...LLS..
is he looking at jail time?
this man is boring af
He needs to distance himself and call out the orange baboon if he wants to cleanse his soul and further his career prospects
Hi Jimmy!\nIf the crowd size was indeed sparse,\nIT'S BECAUSE POOR PEOPLE VOTED HIM IN AND POOR PEOPLE CANNOT AFORD TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES, LET ALONE HAVE ENOUGH TO TRAVEL TO D.C.\nAnd U, Jimmy, damn-well KNOW that TRUMP Is DAN, so how about getting Urself & The Rest Of The Late Night Hosts/ess (Samantha Bee) to START ACKNOWLEDGING THAT ELEPHANT-IN-THE-ROOM F_A_C_T.\n@PATRICIA_EROZ on Twitter
Don't you just miss the spicer lies
Jimmy should join the Skaggs from the View.
Jesus that suit is tight
I like Spicer he seems nice and genuine. He doesn't take it too seriously and can laugh about it
He was only in that position for a matter of weeks. Why are some acting like he had been in it for years? 😂😂😂
We all have free will...in the end.  Spicer sold his soul and is now trying to play the sympathy card.  You chose your path, Spicy.
It's good to see Sean Spicer smiling. I'm a democrat, but man I felt bad for him while he worked for Trump.
Spicy boi
Nothing's changed
Trump is such a blatant liar. I don't know how Spicer can sleep at night.
Sean is very diplomatic but he's still full of sh.....t!
IM NOT AN REPUBLICAN OR CONSTERVIE BUT I THINK SEAN SPICER HAD THE WORST JOB EVER THANK FOR SERVING COUNRTY
Poor spicey  I have so much more respect for him now. I bet he's so relieved he out of there now!!
He seems like a decent person outside of the White House
Feel bad for him
Facts are facts and aren't up for opinion or perspective. A blue sky is a blue sky. Saying it's red because that's your perspective means you're color blind, or just  lying.
wait what ? so american WH speaker is a position to lie in behalf of the president ?i though he represented the nation........no wonder america is like that
At least he can laugh at himself.
Man, i feel sorry for him.. He seems like nice guy if you look at him now
Would I have love to be a fly on that wall watching Donald Trump correct Sean Spicer on how to articulate a sentence
He is such a pleasant guy! Never knew he had such great smile. We should love one another, beyond politics!
Poor sean.... he had to do what he got to do to keep his job.  Now he's like a floating cloud ☁️ never seen him smile that much, what a change!
😂😂😂😂 I kinda feel sorry for this cracker
Spicey has a funny laugh
Merica
Ha.
Candid interview thank you!
Still dodging ...
GREAT!
Love My President!
He looks so haunted
Holy moly he got old
He is still shitty!
Scummy clown.
Spicer is still....Spicer. Ugh
sad
Spicer is funny AF 😂
this poor guy...
Yayyy! Spicey!
Awkward AF 😂
That frame rate though.
jimmy was just roasting him lol
No shame
Lies=Alternative Facts; welcome to the Trump world!
Awww look at how cute and cuddly this professional liar and psychopath enabler is now that he's left his post. Let's all chuckle and give him a round of applause.
Stop making assholes like this seem normal and nice.
Spiceman is still full of SH!T!

Can you please do a hair video? About what products you use and how you keep it healthy. I watched your video from a couple years ago, but I'm curious if your routine has changed! ❣️
As weird as this sounds, I honestly can't help but tear up watching this video. I've been watching your videos for like 5 years now and I cant help but feel a little empathetic towards your energy. Take your time to cater to yourself and work things out for the better of you and the people around you. You have an amazing head on your shoulders, Carli.
Damn she is dope as fuck, kind of reminds me of Kim Kardashian.
Why you heat your hair so frequently and it still so shiny and healthy? what did you do to your hair ?
Wedding makeup will be nice,  what u guys think about it?

Review on Fenty Beauty PLS!!!!!!
Perwinkle
You look exactly like kim kardashian
Do it!!!
Love you Carli!!!
Awww I still love Carli.
Carli feeding the deer is so adorable haha 😂
Where is Brett? Did they break up?
You dont seem like yourself in this video. You behave more aggressive and not so calm as you used to.. I hope you are still together with Bret❤️ Love you, wish you the best Carli.
PLEASE link the adidas crew neck
The kitty that was at minute 4:58-5 and during the video ... does anyone know what breed is it ? I looovvvveeee it . Hope everything is ok with you .
You can easily fix that choker you just need to pop the clasp open with pliers and then put the fabric back in then pinch it back shut with the pliers.
Is it just me or does she look and sound like Kim k
Your hair is so beautiful just the way it is now. I think you should keep it the same.
If you've wanted that hair color for over a year, then do it! I just know that the dark blue would look soooo good on you! 💓
You should definitely dye your hair navy blue I just done it recently I honestly loved it but it didn't last long in my hair that's the only downfall
Your hair is goals. It's so shiny and long.
Dark chocolate mauve isn't a bad option either
Go for it!I have ashy-blue balayage now. My natural hair colour and skintone is simular to yours, so I guess it will look good on you.
YES! Do it <3 Long and blue would suit you so much x
Can I see some looks that I haven't seen on Keeping up with Kardashians .pleasse
You have beautiful hair 😄
Carli! You look so pretty with light hair, like blonde. But Im sure you can pull of any color❤️❤️☺️
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR PERFUME?????
What do you do with your hair? So beautiful. I know that keratin treatments are usually not vegan so I am curious 🎀🎀
Yes! Navy blue hair and Wonder Woman tutorial!!
Did you an Brett break up ???
Personally i think dark blue /black hair looks really tacky but if you think it looks good then go for it :D
Looks like you have spent a lot of time eating...
Tutorial on that look please
Blue or dark purple would be badass!!!
Your hair looks so healthy & shinny, what do you use & do you hair a hair care routine? Would love to know, thanks!
yes dye your hair blue you only live once....big fan 😄😄😄
I THINK SHE IS CARDI B
I hope your ok, so sweet of you to video when you clearly aren't feeling it. We appreciate you! \nYou really seem sad! I hope you and Brett are ok. You two are perfect for one and another. Girls only change their hair so dramatically when big life changes happen so I'm scared what you'll tell us xx
Yes to blue hair!
Dear Carli : \nIf you ever see this comment, I for one would love to see a tutorial  for the gorgeous eye look you wore NYFW Marchesa Show <3 You are always so beautiful and down to earth! :) Hopefully you do one ^_^ been a subscriber for many years and I really enjoy your videos <3
i love the fact you still buying affordable options. How is your eczema? i hope you're doing great. xo
Where is Brett? I have a strong feeling for some reason that you guys aren't together 😞I hope not! 😐 I feel like your trying to be strong for us while making this video, but if so then you are doing a good job 💕
CarliBel, there 's a lot of speculation on here so i wanted to be positive and  tell you that you have been my most favorite youtuber along with nicole g since 2010 and thanks to you i've finally had the guts to start uploading and being more outgoing with myself. Love you! and never change for anyone! \n\n\nps: do the damn blue hair but only for yourself, no one else.
Where is the collection carliiii
Hey mama you definitely look like you're going through some stuff. Whatever it is just know it will get better with time. Sometimes we need to stop and take time for ourselves to reflect and heal. Hope to see your bubbly self back again soon😊.
when we she said and we met some cutiessss I was like WAIT WHAT WHERES BRETT ? if y'all did split up , I'm actually really sorry 🙁 your a beautiful person inside and out your always find love❤️
It´s strangely quiet in your house now :S where´s Brett? I hope you´re ok, hun <3 you seem different :S love you <3<3<3
You can definately feel the vibe of this videoo! :( Carli's always cheery and bubbly!!
NO!!!! I HATE BLUE, PURPLE, GREEN WHATEVER... HAIR COLORS 😭😭😭
Looks like y'all had so much fun in the limo lol
maybe black/blue hair dye would be beautiful on you! in the sunlight it'll reflect a blue undertone and inside it'll be black (if that makes sense)
I think you would look beautiful with blue hair! I'd say go for it! I'd love to see a video of you dying it :D <3
14:41 your cat is me running away from my problems lmaooo😭😭
Maybe her and Brett are over?!? I hope not 😭
Hey carli !! Where did you get the headband ears !!! Love !!
Needing to add all the limo songs on my playlists
The blue would look amazing! 👌
Yes do the blue hair Carli!!!!!♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
girl the best therapy to anything is cutting your hair and new color do it
Your hair is so beautiful just the way it is.  Don't dye it blue or any other color.  It is so beautiful just like it is.
I really love your makeup colors! So pretty!

love all your shoes! !!!!!
Go navy blue!  Yay omggg
Blue hair please!
Navy blue !
Deffinatley try blue hair!!!
yesss girl do tha blue hair 😍
Short?  We need a full length film of this !!!
This is one of those few times where I happily exclaim, Make it 4hours long, Make it a series, Make it a Mini-Series!!  This collaboration of Blade Runner and Shinichiro Watanabe is just too perfect to simply condense it into a short film...
See you space blade runner...
ｍｏｒｅ　ｈｕｍａｎ　ｔｈａｎ　ｈｕｍａｎ
Anime, cyberpunk and FlyLo, as if that isn't the best combination
this is probably gonna turn out better then the new movie
By Shinichiro Watanabe! Holy shit fuck the new movie i want the anime version :D
Holy shit this is perfect. I really hope we get to see more stories from this world in different formats.
I can't believe we're getting a new Shinichiro Watanabe project with music from Flying Lotus. This is literally a dream come true. I'm sure the movie will be great in its own right, but this is something else.
i guess we're gonna need this short to be significantly less short than it is probably gonna be... more like 150-something minutes short...
대박 이건 봐야해!!!
yeeeeeeesss!
This looks pretty awesome, and is immediately on top of my must-watch list.
Also, is it just me, or doesn't those animation sheets look pretty massive in physical scale compared with most other standard animation paper? Or is it to accomodate more detailed drawings for theatrical cinemascope animations?
I'm glad they put subtitles on, because I don't know Japanese...
I never asked for this...but I'm glad.
I need a background of the girl at 1:01
I'm freaking stoked about this. This is going to be amazing.
Been waiting for this since 1984 when I first got into anime, and Shinichirō Watanabe is directing! ^_^
Good to see the world of BR coming back to life again.
They could expand this into a 26 episode series, it'd definitely find a market.
OH WOW! Something decent will come out of this sh*t movie sequel.
how long will this be?
I hope it's longer than 5 minutes.
This looks like Under the Dog but good.
This is the best news I've heard in a while
idk if the anime short version are good or bad, but if is good, i hope they make it into featrue film.
hopefully this gets Subbed and sony doesn't fuck over everyone who doesn't know japanese who wants to watch it.
Warner Bros USA olease put the anime in the home video release
I love anything Watanabe related, it's gonna be amazing <3
YES, YES, YES
QUERO
impresionante
POPOLA CONFIRMED\nhttps://youtu.be/924olvhb2pU?t=61
Deckard and Roy, Eiffel tower, NOW!
¡Bravo, bravo! ¡Qué ganas de verlo! Muero de felicidad.
YES\nYES\nYES PLEASE
This is awesome news.
see you space cowboy...
Oh yes
nice
製作時間…。_ﾛ(･ω･=) ｹｼｹｼ
WOW
ほほう
渡辺監督なら観ないと！
I came. I saw. I came. What a lovely year for cyberpunk!
I wished we can Kickstart this for a whole mini-series.
Hope the movie does well so hopefully we get a full blade runner universe with books, games and other media.
why dont make an anime series with this quality????? WHY WHY!!! ;)
Looks like another Ghost in the Shell movie. Look i like Anime, but Blade Runner shouldnt turn into Anime. The *Live* action movie is a Masterpiece, turning this into Anime is really mediocre, maybe the style and Visuals will be pretty and awesome, like Akira. But where does the Lore fit? They also ruined Godzilla with the mediocre, bad Cgi Grootzilla movie...
Coming soon... How soon is soon? And when it arrives, HOW DO WE WATCH IT?! ... legally, that is...  I have gotten to the point where I refuse to pirate stuff...  :D
私の中で神格化された作品だけに、その続編というのは複雑な心境だ。コケるくらいなら最初から作らないでほしいという気持ちもある。果たして上手くいくかどうか・・・頼むぜ。
So a black dude and a fucking chick, just LIKE everything else these days... PASS!
*R E L I G I O N  O F  P E A C E*
Terrorist attack? Time for the left to blame trump for ALL of his tweets.
so many alleged terrorist attacks and none is solved. That shows how fragile The U.K. is. This looks like fire drill emergency response exercise.
haters of Islam always remember : your peace is inside your grave.
dumb trump didn't tweet about the white kid with the gun who attacked his school and shot 6 people he didn't call him a terrorist
Trump saying loser makes me think of a 10 year old kid...
I'm seeing a lot of hate towards the hateful. Stay safe London. Love, Johnny.
I'm honestly starting to think this was just a bunch of kids lighting shit on fire on the train.
I don't think the main objective of the  bomb was to hurt people if they wanted to they could have done it way better
This is some Blacklist type shit
Why is it happening to us Brits?  What did the world do to make it un safe for innocent people to get to work/other places and get attacked?
GAS CHAMBERS TO ALL MUSLIMS!
Fear-mongering and it's part of living in a big city. Can you guest the idiots whom said this?\nHint: Ones a over used tea bag
*Look out dudes! Religion of blast you to pieces.....i mean, very very peaceful, coming through!*
Fuvking Pakistani fucks wreaking havoc against fucking civilians again
Officials will wring their hands and write a sternly worded email  to ISIS.  Instead they should pull the hate spewing imams out of the mosques by their scraggly beards and deport!!!
How do we know they are Muslim?
Where was David Duke? \n\n🤔
They will magically find a passport or know where he is hiding
This alleged terror attack is a FAKE STAGED HOAX DRILL committed by the Government & reported by the corrupt complicit mainstream media as a real event. Crisis actors used as victims & eye witnesses. ALL terror attacks in UK have been staged by the UK Government, used to implement new laws to remove your freedom & privacy, to instill fear, divide people & now they're going after free speech via censorship of the internet. Government trying to shut up anyone that goes against their bullshit lies & actions. The Government are the terrorist using psychological terrorism against it's own people.
I'm all for a safe homeland, but what a crock of shit from the parliament/media. This is probably one of the laziest attempts I've ever seen. That being said I'm glad everyone is okay.
According to liberals: There are no terrorist...
Sadik Kahn orders you to get used to it!\nYou deserve such a mayor!
Damn London is way to dangerous
What's to investigate? It's the damn muslims once again. The Religion of pieces.
All in the name of acceptance and equality
No life threatening injuries just like your natural disasters blueye british pigs. Is it the snap crackle pop navy or is it in concert with the USA military?
No worries, only liberal loving Brits hurt, you know the ones that love the terrorists to death and want more in. Just do the usual candle vigils, holding signs of peace, toleranance, and hug it out like usual and move on already. We're just waiting for the next one to happen as usual. Like having a bad cold and wondering why it isn't being cured because you keep taking in antibiotics.
Kick them all out!!!! How many more?!
I am hoping that the world will come to realize that Islam is not a religion but a Demonic Cult of War, Conquest and Deceit. Islam and Muslims need to be kicked out of Europe AGAIN.
Let me help you guys solving this case. Whoever did this was not a Boy Scout, nor a Japanese tourist, nor a Buddhist monk, nor a polish immigrant, nor a born again Christian, nor a vegetarian... I hope I have helped some.
Why are these attacks happening? The UK did not abduct Muslims into the UK, as Americans did to Africans. Muslims themselves wanted to live in the UK, probably because they thought the UK was a better place to live than their Muslim country, and the UK welcomed them and provided them place to live.\n\nShouldn't the UK be their second motherland, if not the first? Why attack the nation that helped them? If they want the UK to become more like their original Muslim country, why not go back there? Then, they can have the strict Muslim way of living without terrorism.
need more migrants to England. this is god's way of punishing England for the many sins of the Beattles !   gods wrath us upon England for the Beattles satanic music clearly heard , satan is god  when played backwards at 45 rpm !!!!
These goat fuckers can't even create a proper bomb 😂
I live in the uk and its so sad how people find out the news and just say aw its just another terror attack like its normal
Calling any Muslim Muslim is too flattering for that word means to submit to God. That's an insult to God himself. I prefer to call them Mohammedan.
the bomb might just be a lure.. and the person who made the bomb built it to not fully explode,to fail.
It was the British government that supported the terrorists in Syria ... This is the result of their support😡😡😡😡
Lol police won't investigate anything, because this whole hoax was staged with their complacency.
It's a gallon bucket and a tiny fire, fucking incompetent terrorist but how were people even injured? Either way the device seems more or less intact so good for forensics.
Kick all the brown people out of Britain. Or kill them.
Europe & UK government just don't understand this is just the beginning so why don't y'all bring in more unvetted immigrants !!!
i can't believe josh johnson bombed the subway!
Just shows the stupidity of modern day humans. Yeah lets go up and stare through the window at the flaming improvised explosive.
Ohhh, that woman's legs are burned so badly 😣. She must be in so much pain, her skin is just peeling off completely 😟. I hope that she and all others injured are able to recover okay.
Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslim.
Women need to be taken out of politics
God, how terrible, when will this insanity end??\nIt would seem that no one is safe, anywhere. No words. Thank God no lives were lost...
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Part & parcel, y'all. Just part & parcel
Okay abc news since cnn is not reporting YOU'RE taking the hit. Now US military blow up civilians overseas but is not reported. There are numerous REAL terrorist attacks that go unreported. Sheeple claim they need evidence to prove that these are psyops but I need evidence to prove that it was real other than reporters saying so fake witnesses and police and emts everywhere. Now you can fool millions but I know that this is another psyop to invoke fear and control. I don't care about responses because this message is for abc.
Ohh islam...again
Another terrorist attack the world is going to forget within 48h. A world ran by retards.
You know the smell of burning *FLESH*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe police are coming so I have to go now 3:42
Radical islamic terrorism a culture in UK
According to Sadiq Khan, Muslim mayor of London, this is just everyday life in a big city. True. A big city in some Islamic shithole country teeming with subhuman, stinking, violent Muslims. I remember a family vacation to London in the early 1970s. Then it was actually full of courteous, civilized white Britons. I was there a second time again early this summer, and large parts of it are so rancid and violent with Muslims those areas should be leveled, the Muslims repatriated to whatever Islamic death cult cesspool they crawled out of, and the areas vacated populated by white Britons once again.
EVERY sharia-law-lover is a soon to be terrorist. KILL them all.
In my opinion every available resource on earth should be used to exterminate all radical Muslim terrorists.
Colonial rule.
Magic video!
A BUCKET BOMB? WTF!
Wow in Islamic State of London? It's not Great Britain no more. Well it's ur government that allowed this.  Attacks will be imminent. Idiots.
Hope they are alright..
Glad no one lost lifes
Did isis  did this
nh
Fucking greenscreen on george. Hes not in london...
BRITAIN BELONGS TO WHITE PEOPLE.
Death to Chocolate Pudding faced people !
this is what happens when you disarm your citizens they dont pull these pussy attacks in the states every other week
Why was George Stephanopoulos in london?
Here we go again.
so.....how is that open door policy for Muslims working out...?
Another day in Londondistan
Damn Buddhists - again!
I just can *not* wait to dive in to all the delightful comments! Yay, I get to learn 42 new cuss words! Oh! Is that hate on Muslims? Terrific!
Forget about banning the burqa. Ban Islam.
The Muslim phobic comments are awful. How do you even know who did this? Even if it was a Muslim the majority are not like you think
Liberalism KILLS.\n\nFind a cure!
Was it Buddhist?
OUR SPECIES ARE GETTING AWFUL EVERYDAY
Damn white Christians
Hahaha everyone talk about Muslims 😂😂😂 lool
Know Muslims, No Peace.\nNo Muslims, Know Peace.
If you don't address that attacks like this are created by the whites behind the curtain, you will never ever be able to solve the issue. Addressing the root cause is the key.
Islam is to blame. If you're a Muslim and you can't recognize how false and violent your religion is, I don't want you in my country! Get out right now. We are going to start making it uncomfortable for you otherwise.
It's the religion of peace, nothing new....
All this crap since we were dragged into a phoney war with Iraq based on Lies lies and more lies.
If there was an explosion then how was the bag and bucket it was in almost fully intact and barely on fire? And why was George Stephanopoulos in London? Was he there to cover another story or did he just happen to be there today? Hmm...
ALAHU AKBAR\nALAHU AKBAR\nALAHU AKBAR
Religion of peace strikes again
The Mighty Lion of Juda...Will Eradicate Islam Forever
jewish made sunni-radical terrorism again deport all jews and sunnis now!!!
This comment is a controversial opinion and will start a reply war.
White people are the real terrorists
Religion of peace strikes again
TOTAL FUCKING ZIONIST HOAX SET UP AGAIN!
Islams fucking cancer to everyone and women's oppression. Not all muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are muslims
What if it was actually the kim regime???
Your video shows picture of a plastic pale with flames burning inside but the plastic pale is intact, didn't know plastic was explosion proof. Something not quite right here.
My family could have ate that...
Spoiler alert:\n\n4bigmacs effectively decreases your life span by: 3years, 5months, 2wks, 4days, 10hrs, 25mins, 10secs\n\nimagine what you could have done with those lost time
I'm so scared I thought your tummy was gonna pop 😅
*and he's still so skinny..*
Can you handle this one though...https://youtu.be/haNE-C7eIOo
How is he not fucking obese
One day we'll see you chocking on one of these videos

MATT BRO, YOU SHOULD DO A PHO CHALLENGE BRO! I'M 6'2 230 POUNDS,  AND IT KICKED MY ASS. GET REDEMPTION FOR ME! Lol\nNot sure but i think its 2lb meat and 2lb of noodle. But that'll be too easy for you xD maybe up the challenge!
U should do Thomas grasso last meal challenge
make the fattest omelette and eat that shit .
Large fries in the US are fucking huge. In the U.K. a large would be the same probably as a US small fries.
I can easily do that as well... maybe not in 4 minutes, but definitely in 4 hours.
I don't get how you do the milkshakes that fast
Matt, love your videos brah.\n\nI should make note for Pete though that he wasn't actually racing (by his own admission) when eating. Considering Pete's burger inhalation times I'd imagine he'd be up there with you.
U should try the 5 pound gummy skull
Matt Stonie video, but he genuinely enjoys the food and has a good time
can you eat pussy like that
You eat all this food really fast not enjoying it for some dumb challenges and some of us don't even get this food some don't even eat or can't afford food homeless!!!!
Why turn on time lapse of you ate 4 burgers in 1:36 anyway????
Do 10-20 bananas in a minute they can be pre- peeled
1:24 That's what she said.
Damn.. need some big Mac's now..
2:44 that's not real
I WANT 100 BIG MAC'S NOW THAT I SEEN THIS VIDEO
I wonder how long he stays in the restroom
Kinda feel bad for the homie, they robbed you on the fries
yo going to get fat
Is this actually a channel that isn't click bait ? WOW
When there's a challenge of eating you know Matt will dominate
when you eat this  rhink about african kids
I could EASILY do this shit. This is lunch
don't you get heart burns because I fast
If ur next video gets 52,000 likes then I dare u to cut ur hair like if u agree
What kind of throat wizardry does he practice?!!! I've never seen someone CHUG A FUCKING MILKSHAKE like that in my life!! I'm shook
I got to stop watching this guy all he does is make me crave McDonald's
How do u eat so much but never get fat
If Matt didn't talk or anything he would have finished by 4:30 , he is just chilling lol
I can't stop watching
I love your vids can I get a shoutout
Are McDonald's fries good? You're goddamn right they are! Are they literally flavoured poison because of how the potatoes are grown & harvested? You're goddamn right they are!
I vould eat the french fries but not the other stuff lmao
Yo dude if you marry yuka kinoshita (look her up she eats more than u) and have a baby, i wanna see if the baby drinks the sea. Or how you have lunch, like .. a truck size lunch?

Jesus Christ man u unstoppable
Anyone notice his jaws are inflamed

My stomach hurt after watching this...
serving of balut contain 188 calories, including 14 grams each of protein and fat, 2 milligrams of iron and 116 milligrams of calcium. #100balutchallengefor @matt_stonie
Now I'm craving a strawberry shake and large fry. Lmao
Bs she didn't do it in 6 mins
The word impossible basically says I'm possible if that makes sense to you lol and put the fries on the Big Mac that may help
That Combo must taste nasty in my opinion
Could have done faster if you ate the fries like gulping those drinks down.
Now the real question is how are you not FAT
who's the person that did it in 6 mins?
Dude pay me all the big mac'S and i promise you i eat them all!!
Seriously how can he not gain weight??????
HOW THE HELL ARE YOU SKINNY BRO I DONT EAT AS MUCH AND IM FAT ASS HELL LOL
You should redo the 12 pack of Ramen video you did for years ago to see how much better you got
Turns out it isn't very impossible
Jesus tap dancing christ man. I can barely eat 3 junior chickens with the assistance of copious amounts of weed and alcohol.
People do 10 k calories and baerly made it ....Matt did it on 5 minutes maaaad
Do ur shit come out in chunks ?
OMG I JUST RELIZED YOU WOULD BE GREAT AT THE HIT DOG EATING CONTEST!!!
When you get McDonald's ad 😂😂😂
It's a good day for McDonald's for selling big mac to matt \nBecuase they know he's gonna fuck up in the toilet \nEdit:don't do any of the following things in home or you will have cancer and more.
Holy shit dude 👌👌 killed it 👌
Hehe
Yo this dude looks like manny Pacquiao
ım coming for beat yur record!!!
One of everything mc Donalds menu
Never watch SNL but after watching this I definitely need to look him up!
This video has changed my week so far.\nNorm really is a hidden gem, much like Stanhope.
That last joke stolen from Billy Connelly if I'm not mistaken.
backgrounds of red screens with yellow accents, McDonald analogy?
I DISAGREE completely, Norm Macdonald is NOT a funny man.
in Norm Macdonald Live Sarah Silverman episode , she spotted Norm's wordplay and exposed it in a light way , part.1 minute 6:00 \n\nSarah really gets norm's comedy a lot more than everybody else
I can definitely appreciate him and his craft more now, but yea, I don't think he's funny :(
I thought the video had something to do with McDonald's. And now I'm all hungry.
greatest of all time.
Huh, newfound respect for the way my Grandpa told jokes <3
Duh. What's next, a video on why Bob Dylan is an amazing songwriter? ...Oh wait...
This video was so brilliantly edited!
Please do a video about Stewart Lee.
Why do avoid a case study of the Mona Lisa ?
not my cup of tea. Like I get the jokes but the pay off is not worth the time I spent listening to it.
You should do a video on Stewart Lee
when uncle terry's been drinking... you don't fuck wit him
This video essay was excellently written and put together. Love Norm, love the video!
Love the red and yellow haha\n\nBut Im shocked to read a lot of comments that never heard of Norm
Nerdwriter - do you take requests? One of my favorite films is No Country for Old Men. ( I saw that ending coming, I swear I did!) I have my opinions about what it means, but I would love to hear your analysis.
I love this kind of long story telling humor.\n\nThere a guy that does his jokes like this.\nHe talk about the little things of his daily life. Then he start rambling and we end up forgeting what was the first point he was talking about, but that doesn't matter as his story telling mastery is to a point where although he end up making 4 hour long shows, every minute of it is an hysterical burst of laugh. \n\nThis kind of comedy is the best to me.\nIt require true skill to be able to pull this.
I just find out a great comic character i've never heard of ! :) Thanx Nerdie !
Norm would watch this video and completely disagree and say 'I'm just telling jokes man', he's awesome
more canadian comics, they have ruled for years! jim carey?
This is a dude who nearly won $1,000,000 on Millionaire.
Where can I find that joke about the body
I'm so glad you uploaded this. Norm is one of my favorite comedians. I think his work, though underrated, is genius.
Love norm, like your vids, felt this was a weak one as i didnt really learn how/why norm is a genius past He's brilliant because he's smart. Just felt like a lot was left on the table. Maybe ill like it more when I come across it again in a year or two :)
Similar commitment to their own personal comedy: John Roderick and Merlin Mann
This guy sounds just like Lagos Cargo
Maybe I'm one of the people who doesn't find him funny. Where's the joke
Could you do a video on howard stern?
I instantly recognized that the outtro music was a remix of mozarts requiem (lacrimosa) ^^
Wow. He just seems like an asshole
Wow. I went through that video for 7 minutes listening with mild amusement and thinking He really does sound like a comic genius, but one that isn't quite my taste. Then that last punchline hit me. It's taken me 10 minutes to stop laughing long enough to write this comment.
I like listen to you advertize to me sooooo much more than that Karly Kloss chick who uses WIX....and its easy to use and blah blah blah. Nerdwriter!
I _knew_ about Norm Macdonald but honestly had never seen his comedy. Thank you, again, Nerdwriter, for bringing something new (a perspective, an interest) into my life. I really like Norm's sense of humor, so now I've got to check out more. Where should I start - some comedy special, perhaps? I think I heard he has a podcast and I listen to podcasts daily so that might be an easy introduction.
Ah, the moth joke...one of my favorites.
I LOVE Norm.
RIP Norm. One of the greats.
I discovered that we don't have a similar sense of humour...
Norm is just ok. This video proved that.
I would love to hear your thoughts on Stewart Lee
Well... as a non american I didn't get any of his humour  :/
I know I dont like his style, because I didnt laugh at one thing in this video.
Thank you for this nerdwriter. Excellent analysis. Norm is one of the greats.
Not even being funny here but Norm MacDonald saved my life.  Read my heart-felt open thank you letter to him on twitter @bonkers_doozy
I'm so glad I found this video. I didn't know norm. Now I love him
Norm MacDonald is like cringe comedy without comedy. Just cringe
I guess I have a different sense of humor cause I didn't even giggle at this guys jokes. To each their own
Learned nothing apart from the fact that Norm MacDonald exists
My coworkers brother worked for snl and said that norm had a habit of pissing in empty beer bottles around his apartment. It was common knowledge that if you were at norms apartment you should never put your beer down.
Norm is a genius.  Well made.
Not once did I laugh. Not sure if it's me or the comedian.
Norm is one of those comics whose jokes you remember, but not the kind of comic whose jokes smart people try to repeat to other people, rather you take them and show them Norm telling that joke.
You should do a video on Stewart Lee, he's probably the king of intellectual comedians.
This video should be titled, In Defense of Dad Jokes
Look at this delusional poster trying to sell Alex Jones as a comic genius. No, Hicks is a very talented voice actor, but he had to mimic standups like George Carlin and Sam Kinnison. Now he mimics Rush Limbaugh. He was a nobody before his CIA handler Frank Gannon took him to England to bash America (like Rich Hall later did). All this Hicks was a legend stuff started after his conversion to Alex Jones was exposed.
Why am I watching a video on Norm Macdonald when I can watch brokeback mountain and watch a cock slip into some guys hot beautiful asshole
My gosh, He sounds like Colonel Sanders. The best actor to portray him, without a doubt. He personified him so well.
Great vid - great timing. I just watched his new special. He really comes out swinging. Loved the kind of cold open he did. Original. \n\nListen, have you seen Legion yet?  It will inspire you to write. The point of view study, the production design, the lighting! It is so up your alley -or so it seems to me. I really don't know you all that well.\n\nHere's to inspiration! Huzzah.
It's great to see this appreciation of Norm's comedy.  In my opinion, Norm is the greatest living comedian.  Thanks so much for this.
You must make a video talking about Memento!!
I'm going to force my sister and brother-in-law to sit down and watch this with me. I have a hard time convincing certain people that Norm MacDonald is the funniest person who has ever existed.
Hey man! Something about The Sopranos or Gandolfini would be much appreciated.
Funniest man on earth. My hero!!!
Thank you! Norm's comedy is so smart it gives me chills. Great video.
I wonder where he got the idea to intersperse the moth joke throughout the whole video
Thanks for highlighting his talent. I always wondered about him. Never understood why he was in films and tv shows.
you don't consider Bill Burr a famous comedian !
I don't see a sophisticated joke, I see a guy just having a kinda funny dad joke punchline, and then just making up a bunch of shit in the middle. Pretty fucking awful
Norm you know damn well you don't belong on the trending page in 2018...but damn it you're my favorite anyway...enjoy your has browns hank chuckowksi...
Interesting style (the handwritten thing)
I heard he's a real jerk!
Thank god for the hatchery.
he's the funniest man of all time
Please add subtitles to your videos, my english lessining is not so good. \nHello from Brazil!
First vhs I ever purchased was dirty work
Thank God for the Hatchery!
You can't talk me into thinking someone is funny. Patrice O'Neal, now he was Funny! Maybe even an actual comedic genius.
I have never thought he was funny but that moth joke was! \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Fantastic video! Produced exceptionally well. And, about one of my favorite comics. 5/5
why don't just suck norm macdonalds dick already
I'm so fucking fed up of being mediocre.
WOW...this was not a paid advertisement at all!
If I was a girl,  I would flash him at his stand up shows.
Isn't Mike Tyson's Mystery Tea a shaggy dog story
So fucking boring.
Jim Jeffries
Phil Hartman, I dare you.
OMG i love this.
Please do Patrice O'Neal
Yea, he seems okay, I think I still prefer Amy Schumer
Monty Python next?
Ugh. Norm MacDonald sucks.
Hiii ! It's Veronika! 🌻
norm is god.
Norm: 9/11 HAHAHAHA
this is pretty pretentious
Normie Normie Normie..
Isn't it like the first time Sean has cursed? 😮
Sean. My man. Stop giving me a heart attack with that laptop placement.
Don't know who this guy is. I'm giving it thumbs up for Sean, but I'm moving on
Was that blue milk?
Just start making these longer, it feels like theres so much edited out, id watch hour long episodes XD
The thing I love about this show is learning about all these cool people that I probably wouldn't otherwise have ever paid attention to.
Get Tyler, The Creator on this
All my dreams just came true
Y'all should get Rhett and Link on the show.
Dillon Francis? Never heard of him....
Love this show, but I dislike when they cut off the answer just as it's getting good. Up your editing game!
You need to invite Phillip Defranco on the show!!! He is an awesome and influential creator on Youtube and he is a huge fan of the show!!
sick,sick,sick
<3
Dope! Legend
These guys vibin hard bro. Im shipping them fo real
Michael Vick
really want to see Rhett and Link make an appearance.
14:21  Projectile traveling at 420 miles an hour
What's the music at 3:47?
Make the early sauces a little bit hotter
Sean i did see El Yucateco show cased any more... too hot? No, let me guess, NOT hot enough. Try El Yucateco Black Label it just might make his way up the list...
dillion seems pretty cool i wouldn't mind chillin with the guy seems very cool
Whoa. Why is Dillon so chill? I didn't know he has a chill mode :0
Why don't you guys do a celebrity call out? Allow the guests on the show to call out a friend they want to do the challenge.That should happen at the end of every episode.
Sean, my man, you gotta get Marshawn Lynch on here.
You guys should add The Black Label Shit the Bed hot sauce to the roster
DO ONE WITH LEBRON JAMES
This is the best show on YouTube; fuck Vlogs \nCouldn't agree more Dillon
Get Jack black on!
Hey Sean. Does scoville increase with portion size? Obviously you guys add more on the last dab and im just wondering does that last dab increase the intensity/level of scoville ingested, or does it just increase the portion of scoville you have eaten?
Err he is soo boring and lame especially a perdon that's in edm...
Im a Grain of sand on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a desert
By far the best guest yet and I don't know who he is! Thanks for that interview Sean Evans! Hot Ones has my wife and I tuning in every week for more! Congrats on the success my friend. Much Love
are you really doing hot ones without gabriel iglesias?
why can't they poop on tour buses wtf?? Pooping is a natural thing. They should PAY you for holding it in  cause thats some fucked up shitttttttttttttttttt
GET POGO ON THE SHOW!!!
@firstWeFeast what is the name of the song played bewteen 7:25-7:43?
Sean looks like he is getting bored with this shit.
Get diplo on the show!
Tyler the creator please!!!!!
Thumbs up if you wanna see Justin Roiland on this show!!
PLEASE get the broad city girls on here!
I don't know if they choose to leave in the part where people say oo that's good on the Hot One's Fiery Chipotle, but dammit I want that sauce. Sell it on Amazon too!!! Sheesh. Did you all sign a contract that says THIS WEBSITE ONLY AND NO OTHER VENDORS?\n\nEdit: If the Hot Ones crew reads these comments: it seems nobody (even others who purchase the sauce) seems to like Da Bomb hot sauce. All heat and no flavor is the overwhelming review.
Found a new Hot Sauce for you guys to try out! It's called Shit the Bed from Australia :D https://www.bunstersworldwide.com/products/bunsters-shit-the-bed-hot-sauce-12-10-heat
I don't know who Dillon Francis is
I feel like this is a start of a friendship, this was a great interview!
Who is the dj that he say at 9:50m
I just realized this is in 1440p
complaining about how easy youtube is while hosting a wing eating show on youtube lawl
Wtf you pushing your own product on the Last Dab?  Do you not understand the branding of the Last Dab?  Y'all straight jumped the shark.  I know what your hottest sauces are.  I get that you'd advertise them, but you ruin your credibility when you say lol THIs is the hottest wing *wink wink*  There's no neutrality.  Come on.
Wonderful clear vidos 👏💕💕💕💕👏  welcome to our new video is always happy to make new friends
Get Jesus on here!!!!
Get Louis C.K., actually never mind my asking won't work so never-freaking-mind!!!
You know him from NO! I don't know him from shit Sean.
He's pretty cool
You Gotta Interview Hillary Clinton! That's be dope because she is a hot sauce enthusiast.
That color collection hurt my eyes
I'm not even a fan of EDM and have never heard of this dude, but he seems cool as fuck and good attitude.
Where is the  aggressive brand name?
Some or all members of Avenged Sevenfold
Sean Evans... is your mouth perpetually fire?  Just asking for a friend...
Sean, hit me with a Jack Antonoff segment.
respect to the White Sox Throwback Sean!
PLEASE GET YELLOW CLAW ON THE SHOW
Get John Cena on here
I just need Gordon Ramsay. Please
Great episode Sean.  Dillon is hilarious.
I work in a butchers. I need to get a box of chicken wings and a few bottles of hot sauce. Just as good as beer. Even better with beer.
Sean as a fan of the hip hop scene and hot wings all things hot, this show really needs some dong lover, aka Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino.
pauses and goes and watches Pursuit for the million time
Why did you stop telling us that you love us? Do you not love us anymore, Sean? 😩😩😩😩
You HAVE to get Tommy Wiseau on this show! That'd be the BEST one. lol
this dude was like, hey, maybe you really can fight fire with fire.
11:17 I miss the old [enter artist] Every Skrillex fan ever
Put Logan Paul in it
Get someone from Brockhampton on the show

Mi hermano se enamora de tu voz y esta enamorado de ti
I don't know why but I used to hate Grace. But now I support her. :) I guess I was jealous because I knew I'd never be as successful as her - but God gave her this path and she's treating it so well.
who loves grace?\nGive me your like to show to me your proof that you are like grace 😉
Grace, i'm a fan of yours. I enjoyed mostly every single song that you wrote. But there's something bothering me. I find it many of your studio version songs (Sick of Being Told, So Much More Than This, Gossip Girl) used too much effects. I don't find it bad or anything, but personally i think its better if it stays simple. Just you, and your ukelele. No effects.\n\n I enjoyed those songs, but when i see you perform the simple acoustic way (Ed Sheeran's A Team, your whole AGT performances, your iHeart Radio performances), its so BEAUTIFUL. There's something more to it, it drawn people to you. Those performances so magical, so beautiful and i don't understand what that is. And i think its better for your studio versions song stay that way. I'm not a music expert or something, just my opinion. \n\nNo matter what i always love you and will always support you! Thanks!\n\n(sorry for my english)
How old is this gurl?○-○
what is your fandom 's name Grace ??
omg I would Support through everthing
Could be a coincidence but she's releasing her album the same day as Taylor Swift. ANYWAY I AM SO EXCITED! AHJGGH I love Grace.
My balls itch just looking at these things
Kind words of the day:  \nI hope you don't have a crab in your butt, buddy. -Coyote Peterson
he was sticking his middle finger xD
The shrimp looks like the shrimp guy that cleans everything from Nemo
Kinda weird when your watching brave wilderness in your cr and when he got that sea cucumber it looked like my poop •,_,•
I didn't see a crab
5:17 he sounds like pleakley from Lilo and stitch when his voice changed lool 😆😆\n\nBut interesting video tho 👌🏽 Hawaii is such a beautiful place i wanna go so bad!
4:35 Id laugh if that wasn't a black sea cucumber
When he talked about stepping on a sea urchin, I thought of Surf's Up and when Cody stepped on an urchin!
the phrase sea urchin heaven reminds me of a trip to Costa Rica. We went to a black sand beach that I assume was once part of a lava flow. The entire sea floor off the beach was solid black lava rock. Thank goodness I was snorkeling on the surface and not stepping on the rocks because every ~2 inches there was a sea urchin. The entire sea floor was covered in bore pockets with a black/deep purple urchin in every one. It was so awesome to see and I wanted to share this because I think that beach was the best place to call a sea urchin heaven
How would you like to have a crab go up your butt\n- Coyote Peterson 2k17
If I got stung by a sea urchin or a bee or ANYTHING I would screech until my lungs shrivel up and shatter
i saw a little tiny fish blending in with the rocks in the middle of the two borrowing urchins at 12:41 to 12:43 under the rocks
I have tried sea erchin and it tastes so strange. It tastes very fishy and a bit salty
the shots throughout the video were beautiful
it is a kind of camaflosh shrimd
omg he was so lit ab that shrimp
no one ever likes my comments its down here\n                                                          |\n                                                          |                                                                \n                                                          v
i got spiked not long ago in Turkey by a sea urchin twice damn its annoying
I look up to you coyote. I learn everything about nature from you. You make learning about nature fun.😇😇😇
I got a heart attack when u got a surprise stung
He looked like he put the sea cucumber exactly were he stepped
Woah, 8 million subscribers! Congratulations! I remember liking you when you had 300 K subscribers :')
Burrowing sea urchins don't bite they can only chew Thrue Rock and hard surfaces and there bites feels like it tickles
U should swim with mermaid mallisa i think thats her name\n\nLike if u agree 👍

Hi!
SEA URCHIN!!!!
7:04 HE FLIPPED US OFF OMG
How did that happen? CHEW CHEW
Crongrats on 8 million
at 6:12 in the background there were big splashes what was that
YOWZERRZZ!!!!!
$60 for 2 like eyeshadows is ridiculous. Like it could have gold on it and I would still pass
Wonderful review. Starting g following you today. Thanks!
Your eye makeup is GORGEOUS!!!
Tati, where did you get those earings? 😍😍
Eye makeup looks amazing today!! Also, her skin legit looks airbrushed today??
I can't tell you how much I appreciate you channel, your honesty, your high-to-low thinking in products <3 so happy to have your advise in my life (and youtube feed)! Go Tati!
it's funny how in the comments people be like 'it's too expensive!!!' but where i live makeup is quite expensive (that's why i don't wear makeup lol) these items will be much expensive in my country.
I feel like rare smells like vanilla flowers all the time
$60 for an eyeshadow duo. What the deuce??!
I am getting one of the eyshadow duos but im confused is the formula at least good?
Wouldn't spend a dime on this line. I guess every Tom, Dick and Harry puts out a makeup line.
the annabelle silver cream shadow looks exactly like that stuff
You look as luxurious as that packaging 😚
I loved this!
your makup looks great
your makeup look is absolutely gorgeous <3 <3 <3
i just subscribed to your channel, your thumbnails dont do any justice to how beautiful you are! i always saw you on my recommendations, and never realized how sophisticated and gorgeous you are, until i pressed the play buttom😅😍! 🇭🇳
I thought that Victoria was with Tati from the thumbnail...
Tati I did a video on a jelly face mask but I though it would be a good wtf item for you to try out!
You might as well get the Natasha Denona pallet
I think that they should sell an initial launch/line with the expensive packaging and then the products without all of the expensive packing. Definitely feel like some of the more expensive products you're paying for the packaging (which is great by the way) and I would get it if it weren't for the price.
Appreciate your honesty that's what keeps me watching xxx
Will this be at sephora? or only department stores?
The freaking prices are absolutely ridiculous
Tati for President!!
🤔🤔🤔
You look stunning 💕💕💕💕💕
The foil eye shadow looks chunky, patchy an drying on you Tati.
SMASHING VIDEO!!!!!
Four eyeshadows palette is 75 not 95 on Sephora FYI
Regulate telescope account awgqw expect scary establishment faint.
I feel like Tati has gone down the expensive make up route which in honesty I'm happy for her because you know she's making that $$$ but at the same time sad because she would be my go to person for drugstore make-up. Now I can't really relate to the videos or watch the much because it's just high end after high end or make up you buy online. :/
Tati could you do a tutorial on your look today. Your eyes look gorgeous!!!!!!
Real talk though: how does that primer compare to the loreal lumi one?
I love Tati but sometimes she focuses too much on the packaging when, in reality the packaging (beyond a pump for foundations and primers) has almost nothing to do with why someone should buy a product, ever!
tati can you review Paul & Joe cosmetics ??
Seems awfully expensive. You could get a pretty good, large palette for the same money elsewhere......
Omg Estée Lauder has lost there minds I brought a ND LILA palette for the first time and wow I thought that 129 was a bit much for 15 shadows and They have 2 tiny for 60 and 4 tiny for 95 and a primer for 95 totally ridiculous all makeup companies better be taking notes fro RIHANNA & that is what's up she just set a whole new expectation for makeup
For 95 dollars you could save  more money and buy Natasha Denona, better quality, mucho more product...
Clickbait! Lol Tati
Ur skin looks photoshopped!!!
And everyone complains about Natasha Denona palette prices. Holy hell!
Your eyes look INSANE today
Are the compacts refillable?
You look so much like Victoria Beckham in my opinion! I can definitely see a likeness there! If you see this comment, I'm from Wales in the U.K. and adore your channel!! You're one of the reasons why I have such an interest in make up. Thanks for all your hard work uploading videos, you're really one of the best youtubers! Lots of love, an avid subscriber x
That nose contour does not look good.
I was going to buy some of those products for my mum for Christmas :)
Ha, Pixiewoo did pretty much the same with those eyeshadows and the foil! I can't see a different way of using that odd combo either.
any of you want to support each other and sub to each others channels? I sub back! plz let me know :))
I love this review Tati. I just got the powder, quad, foil, bronzer, highlighter and the black and cream duo. The quality is amazing! Can you do a tutorial with this eye? It is stunning!
I find it weird how you say its up there in price but dont you use the Sisley primer and other products that are way more than this??
I spend a lot of money on makeup, but never in my life would i ever spend $95 on an eyeshadow quad lol this collection is way too expensive
Tati. I would love to see you do more off brands like juvias place and other brands like that. Or like the glitters/shimmer from smolder cosmetics!!! Pleaseeee
I hate this eye makeup. The glitter looks so childish and messy
Reindeer nose contour
ok i was plucking my eyebrows while watching this and when you said that the burgundy quad was $95 i almost poked my eye out
the eye shadow quad is 75.  Which bronzer were you holding, java sun or saffron sun?
I like see you using the products, not just talking about them!❤
Love the eye look!!
Wow $95 for 4 friggin eyeshadows!!??? If I'm gonna spend that I rather spend a little more & get a Natasha D pallete!
Your eye look does look beautiful! But I would never purchase those 2 colors together for that price.
I want that freaking foil but not for 40😑
I hope you at least get some free cosmetic bag or something...I love you TATI.
Not hot at all 😪😡
Tati you have to tell us where you get your hand mirrors from....!!!!
Hi :) , could you do a video on the uk skincare brand Simple, I would love to know what you like and don't.\n\nLike this if you want this video and so she can see. \n\nLove your videos Tati, you're the best at reviewing 💜✨
I'm probably wrong but watching this video it looks like you're having a bad day and can't wait to be done with filming 😔 I so hope I'm wrong. Lots of ❤❤
Meh, wouldn't buy anything associated with that miserable mare (VB not Tati!!) and don't get me started on the, frankly, obscene pricing 😡😡
Hi Tati,  Can you please do a Hot or Not for Lashed cosmetics and Flirt cosmetics???
Thanks Tati. I like you more when you are like this, honest but not over dramatic.
Just watching this to calm me down while sitting in the hospital 💕
$95 dollars for FOUR SHADOWS! I'D RATHER BUY A NATASHA DENONA PALETTE THEN
You look sooooo beautiful!!! Loving the hair
That eyeshadow quad is actually $75. I bought it realized it wasn't worth it and sent it back. Your eye makeup today is stunning!!!
Ordered a few of these products the other day and only just watched your review... So relieved I made the right choices! Thank you for such an in-depth video. Can't wait to try these beautiful pieces x
Does that bronzer only come in 1 shade..... lol
Hi Tati, PLEASE could you do a Hot Or Not video about inglot products🙏🏻 I've just started to use some of the pigment shadows and OMG! I now you would love them (especial the purples!!🤣) \n,!!!PLEASE EVERYBODY LIKE THIS, FOR TATI TO MAYBE READ THIS !!!!
What is that other compact in the picture of this video with the 6 shadows that look like foiled shadows???
I always enjoy how you edit these hot or not videos. It's pretty damn near perfect. ✨ \n\nI really like the colours they chose for everything. Even the blue in that duo. 😜 I have a feeling this collection's highlight is going to give me another oh my goood whyyyy moment. 😅 The one they came out with last year was sooo beautiful. But I can't justify spending that much money on makeup. I'm happy for all the people that can afford it!
Love the eye look
No way in hell would I buy those eyeshadows. That's over priced and a rip off
I do you film so far away? I just can't see anything :)) if you don't do a close up on the make up this is just a conversation.
I love you tati! Youre the best makeup artist/youtuber
Do a review for fenty beauty !!
I *need* a dupe for that burgundy quad. Tell me it exists...
No No No...that's waaay to expensive!
My mum and I went out and bought the eye foil this morning after seeing your look. It's so much cheaper in the UK because it's not imported, which is why it's so expensive for you!
Can you try and re-create Victoria's London eye??
i can't stop looking at tati's nails omg
I gotta be honest Victoria Beckham isn't Tom Ford the prices for these are ridiculous love her but no.
My guess is the extra cost is for paying Victoria Beckham for her name. It's a pass for me. Loved seeing the collection though!
This eye makeup is stunning! 😍
Well technically with Too Faced you don't take the brand out of the equation. NO HATE. Just curious why you won't review their products if brand and collaborations aren't a factor to you?
Another overpriced makeup launch. Makeup is marked up 500 times
those prices are a complete and utter joke. you can get dupes that are just as good and are way more worth it
I was going to completely pass on this collection, but after watching this video I just placed an order for the eye foil.  Looks stunning Tati!!
This eye make up, makes your eyes look really small.. not a good one.
Can you do a tutorial on that eye look. It makes your eyes look beautiful !!
You look absolutely stunning tati
I love your eye makeup transformations just love ❤️ itt☝️😱
Why don't you have Anna pick up Eduardo with Alessia. That way you have a bigger chunk of time to do work with no distractions.
Um. Wondering if she should be in bigger bed. Her little head seems cramped in there for fresh air. And breathing in general. Just a thought.
alessias wee face in the camera when anna was opening the stair gate melted my heart!
Definitely gonna have to buy one of the calendars this year!
Baby 👶 is so cute oooohhhhh
I WANT THE CALANDER THIS YEARRR
Couldn't stop laughing at Jonathan when he said look at that sunset in the morning 😂😂💜💜 3:17 , like if you are going to the book tour in Glasgow in November ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jonathan: What's missing?\nEduardo: Food.\n\nLITTLE BOY KNOWS WHAT'S UP 👏😂😂😂
@sacconejolys when are you moving house?!?
When the key gets to far the car wont run, my dad will drive and sometimes drop my mom off places and the keys are still in her purse so he cant drive away
Going on the bingo run 😂😂
Can not wait for the 2018 calendar my mom and I have gotten one for each of us both past years  💗 now we get one with Alessia 💗
Some people need to take a chill pill. Anna and Jonathan have their own way of parenting and raising their children. Stop telling them what they should or shouldn't do. Also, stop being rude to Anna. Anna is an amazing mother and she doesn't deserve any of these mean comments. That's my rant for the night. Bye!
Alessia is growing so fast.think it's time she went into a cot as she's to big for the Moses basket...wow Emilia 5already ,I swear it was yesterday she was born lol.little Eduardo has come into his own and quite a handsome little boy xx
Whats missing...FOOD..jonathan!!its supposed to be a teddy bear picnic...too cute..eduardo bless you boy 😘😘😘
Super sweet hearing Eduardo singing good morning again to Alessia.
I can imagine Jonathan to be super busy \nBut how stressful must be the life of parents who can't work from home....
Alessia's eye contact with the camera all the time is literally the cutest thing love it
I'm so in love with this family
OMG the Bingo run 😂😂 and Eduardo asking for food 💗
100% guarantee all these people who are complaining of Anna doing nothing have never had a baby before 🙄
The kids are soooooo cute and I am seeing u at the tour so excited
Alessia looks so much like Jonathan's family! Wow
Anna´s eyebrows are wayyyyyyyyy to red 😷
Jonathan is such a great dad.❤😍
Hey Jonathan! My family has a Toyota Prado and it also has a remote key. One time my boyfriend and I went to run some errands, so I put the key in my purse. He went and dropped me off at the supermarket, and left to run another errand about 40 min away. When he's on his way he calls me and tells me the car is beeping because it says there is a missing key! (I then realize I have my purse, so the key is with me! 🆘) He was way too far from me by this point, so he decides to keep going. He couldn't turn off the car when he got to his destination 😂 because with no key he wouldn't have been able to turn it back on! He then came back to pick me up, so we were good, but it was stressful! Hahahaha So basically I think it is a problem, but you can operate it 👌🏻
Yes that has happened to my grandma! My grandpa had the keys in his pocket as they were saying goodbye and she drove away while the keys were still in his pocket! She drove all the way to the store but couldn't start the car to get home! It was hilarious
I love this family from the bottom of my heart !
Jonathan you do an awesome job vlogging every day and make the vlogs funnier as you can get them!!!!...I reallly appreciate you for letting us come into your home!!!....Thank You Guys!!!!!!
Can't wait for the bingo runs lol 😂
Jonathan the car won't start if the key isn't in it - like somewhere in the car
go to mummy and flick her ear!!...... goes to mum and hugs her! GAWD EDUARDO IS SO CUTE <3
Anyone know when they are coming to Ireland for a meet up x
Eduardo is a crazy lil kid haha throwing the blanket he was sitting on a minute ago
Completely agreed with what you were saying at the beginning Anna! LOVE vlogging and having things like my 21st birthday on YT so I can watch them back in the future!! 💕
Hi Jonathan, the key thing happened to me😩 I left the keys in house and drove the car 10 miles away and then when I tried to restart the car that's when I realised and my partner had to drive with my keys to give me power. It's a thing, it happens.. to many times for me unfortunately 😂
Jonathan!!! I wondered if you and Anna had seen this. I thought after you telling us about your very busy days this would make you both giggle....DISCLAIMER dont watch around kids.\nWatch Go the f**k to sleep, read by Samuel L Jackson on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/Udj-o2m39NA
Totally can relate. I have. 6 /4/2 and a 8mths old Between drop off pick ups in between errand after school clubs. I sometimes feel like a robot with the same schedule and no human time
You should make an animation of the great catnap book on friendliest friends!
Awhhhh great to see Jonathan his family and the cute video's they made for Emilia her birthday. Love it!!! We don't see them often. Hope they can see their cousins soon
i love you guys and your  banter
How do I make your channel not pop up.
Jonathan wait till they start joining more after school activities
cute photo of the kids. You guys make beautiful babies
this is the cutest thing <33\n\ncan you please make a christmas calender this year too? i loved the one last year, it really made it easier to wait for christmas <3
The kids are so cute!
Jonathan: what is missing ? Eduardo: food 😂😂
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) Emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute Emilia was so adorable when she said  we have to run after Eduardo and when she got some mints out to eat 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said look grandma a lol doll and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling and looking at the camera :):) :):) \n\nAnna what you could do is give alessia a dummy for comfort x \n\nI can't wait for the calendar to come out x
the urge to have kids when i watch your videos jonathan....
that happened to my nana my granda opened the car and she drove away them when she turn the engine of she notice she didn't have the key 💗😂xxxxxx
Eduardo taking after his dad Good Morning my Friendliest Friend PRICELESS!!!
imagine if they gave Emilia the SacconeJoly yt account- Eduardo Anna’s and Alessia jonathan’s JSKDKSKSK
Can't wait to get my hands on the calendar! x
Eduardo singing to Alessia is just precious 💕💕 and a happy belated birthday to Emilia 😊😘
Love Eduardo's response to his Dad. Jonathan says What's missing to our picnic ?  Eduardo says  Food. Such a typical lovely boy.  :)
Wait. I'm sorry - Eduardo singing Good Morning Again... to Alessia JUST MADE MY OVARIES SKIP A BEAT whyyyy are your kiddos so flipping adorable 😭😭😭
I would have if I was Jonathon if I had to go through all these hurtful and bitter comments on here. Some of you people are so judgemental and nasty.
The car wont start without the keys in the car Jonathan (:
This has been my favourite vlog in a long long time. It was real and sincere there was no trying it was just a good old fashioned vlog
If you drive without the keys the car starts beeping and having a breakdown! You can only drive a certain distance away from the keys as well
😂😂😂😂 seems you should have brought some food to keep Eduardo occupied! Laughed so much when he said there was food missing from the picnic! That boy loves his food!
I accidentally drove my keyless car to the supermarket. I could open the door and start the engine because the car was in such close proximity to the keys sitting on the side inside the house, and (from my experience) the car allows you drive as long as the whole time your engine is running, but the second you turn the engine off you can't restart it! I had to be rescued from the car park by my Dad with the keys haha. I wouldn't try it!
My husband always has his car keys in his pocket when we're in the car, even if I'm driving. If I'm dropping him off somewhere he often gets out of the car with the keys & I get an ignition error message on the dash & can't go anywhere! 🙄
That´s what I´m really scared of having kids, they say its amazing having kids but all of those people saying that also say they have no time for them, and I´m kind of a loner I love to step time by myself and having my own space, I am not sure if people like me were meant o have kids. I know I will regret it if I have kids at the moment, but I know I will regret it in a few years (when I´m done with myself haha) if I don´t. That´s stress for me right now!
Guys for the tour tickets does each adult an kid need one? It says under 14s must be accompanied does this mean i need to buy ticket for child?
My mum once forgot her keys Jonathan! She got stuck when she parked and the car turned off haha my dad had to pick her up
eduardo and his dad have got such a good father son relationship 😊
Eduardo is me with the picnic!! You can’t promise me a picnic and not take food 😂
What's the lipstick you put on in the beginning of this video? I like it very much!Thank you ..
Anna you should join tbh!!
Eduardo hitting Jonathan and Jonathan screaming 😂😂😂😂
My mam managed to drive my dad's car without the key as she dropped him off at work and he forgot to give her the key. Luckily she remembered before switching off the engine so she managed to get back to him to collect the key!
You shouldn't let Eduardo hit you like that. Even if it's playing it's not the best idea to teach him that it's ok to play that rough. That's just my opinion as a case manager who works with kids. I have to teach sooooo many parents to stop playing that rough with kids because they do it at school since they don't understand the difference between playing at home and at school.
Why do you bathe Alessia every day? Her skin is going to get so dried out!
Anna you look unreal! Alessia is the cutest 😍
Whats missing? Food. \nThis is the best thing I've heard today.
What would Anna do if you had a 40 hour week 🎀job?
Omg I am getting so Brody watching alessia grow up
hey please check out my vlog: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UALNhtRPCAQ
#19 trending yas
This is so cringe.
Aww what a bunch of cuties!
1:35 aahhhhh cute Alessia
THUMBNAIL IS SO CUTE😩😩
I spy a Marinette doll
Food fixes everything
Alessa smiling is the most precious thing ❤❤
Have they moved?
Love you all
Eduardo waking alessia 😍😍😍
Omg Anna looks so pretty ❤️💜🌸
Loved  Jonathan  singing Tupac 😂
eduardo singing to alessia was soooooooo cute.... aaaawww... my heart is melting
Love this 😘
Fooood. That was so cute Eduardo
Jonathan knows the lyrics to California Love better than I do. And I live in California and love Tupac. Lol. Go Jonathan
Awww like when Emilia used to call herself Biba lol that was the cutest!!!
Are you seriously moaning about how busy you are Jonathan? You work at home you have nothing to complain about please stop and get a real job
Lol the whole forgetting your key in the car but the car is open RomanAtwood has done it and he drove to the store and found out that he didn't have keys so he had to leave his car on and go into the store
Wouldn´t it be easier, if Anna stayed in the house on the morning school-runs and take care of the things that need to be done and than later on pick the kids from school and try to help Jonathan save some time to get his stuff done? That is no hate or anything at all, i´m just wondering, why they don´t handle it that way. Love the Saccone Jolys :)
gurrrrrlll!! you're trending what what
Try Popoly next!!
try Dresslily!
yaasss trending on youtube
The fabric of the white dress is called tweed... or at least they were going for tweed-esque
I love your personality so much, you crack me up and give me good vibes 😊
I haven't laughed this hard in so long. You are hilarious! I could agree with everything you were saying too, I kept talking back to you 😂😂😂 love your videos always 💕
I think they gingham dress looks good! Also, when you have to report comments because random people are hating #thatshowloveworks
I would recommend trying TOBY. My best friends love it, but I've only tried their formal wear. I'm mean 50% off (for your first purchase) a hot dress for New Years?? Yes pls
That's what happens when leather is bad
White tights under the white striped pants?  And it might help with the credit card issue haha
How can you return the Shein stuff really really quick if it's taken three and one half weeks to get to your house and you were then gone for two weeks?
Thank you for this!!
I love these videos because you're seriously providing a service🙌🏽 Also you're adorable and I love you but that Chanel dress gives me serious LambChop vibes 🤣 idk why!? #WhyAmILikeThis  great review! 💖
You should consider getting a belly piercing
Haha one size fits all is not a thing ok... Go to Asia everything is mostly one size fits all especially South Korea. Which sucks if you are size above US M
Your video is Trending!!!
Help me!! 😂
5:30 just sew it
She reminds me of grav3yard girl tbh😂😂😂
Rainbow Brite represent!
Я один русский?
Do Wish next!
1. reorder the white dress 2. wear the pants with nude underwear and you won't notice 3. wear a belt with the shorts
Kys thot
Congrats your trending !! :)
that's cancelled hahaha :-)
Video starts @ 2:43
U look like Meghan reiks
Why is this trending
literally thought that was madewell too lol
You are never a medium! Seriously there is nothing medium about you!! You are one of the thinnest girls I've seen! Very tall- yes.. but not a medium!
... You really expected high quality fabrics and pieces from a cheap site? (For example, the black and white checkered looking dress. Girl it was $14, stop trying to act like it should've been such high quality.)
Leighann, sugar, ya live in Houston.  Summer lasts till well into October, seriously!  (I get it, I do, I'm in Houston, too.)
Omg she is sooo fussy all the clothes look fine!!!
Girl you're on the Trending page - you go!!!!  Now more can see how amazing you are. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
leighann you need to check out the website shopcamp, its all your retro tshirt dreams come true ✨
I ordered a shirt from them over 5 weeks ago and shipping says its sitting in China. they gave me a $2 credit for how long its taking. So glad I only spent $9.
maybe the last dress could be made into a long shirt?
Keep the bigger items and wash them.  They might shrink 😊
Yeah that sweater would fit me like a bra lol looks really cute on you
I really like these kind of videos. That blue dress, the stiff sheet one, it was so stiff you could even hear how stiff it was, it was so noisy lol!
Brandy Melville is a one-size fits all brand.
There is a site where everything is 5.99..you should try that..I found some good stuff
you are very cute.
I gotta get a card with a alias.. Can't trust the internet..
I can''t stand the one size fits all concept. Its incredibly misleading and its encouraging to see influencers who also don't see the point of it!
p.s. I don't know what the sites are off the top of my head, but i know there are a lot of scammy style bridesmaids dress sites. It might be cool to do a bridal themed style of this video
I'm out here thinking it's that lady from Scubs
Love these haul/testing videos!! <33 It would mean so much to me if you watched one of my videos!
You have such a calming presence. Can you just hug me all day?
Yay!!!!  Leighann trending!!  Y'all need in on this!!  Subscribe!!
I love the smell of paint, maybe not toxic but yeah
Am I the only one who gets irked by her complaints when she looks perfect and super fit in every single thing? Like I get it, I don't like alot of clothes either but that's because I'm pudgy and muffin tops happen no matter what
Inu inu is a scam lol the material is so low quality
You should do Cupshe. I see a lot of cute stuff on there but am too scared and picky to try it. I loved the rainbow dress on you! Too bad it was see through.
leighann you *are* a lady <3
Before I buy anything online I check if you did a Try-On.\nLove Your Videos!!
Her looking like a mess is better than myself after getting ready for two hours lmao
Wtf do u buy gucci? That stuff is good.
Any other small YouTube channels out there?
Those pjs look so cute! I want them ❤️
You should really keep the orange striped one it looked really pretty on you
I ordered from Shein once and would never do it again. I knew Shein from a fashion blogger name Jessica (hapatime). Their materials are terrible. I believe Shein is located in Asia (Singapore, as I remember). I didn't even bother to return the clothes but gave away to my friends. Just don't even bother to order from this site. Boohoo or Lulus have better quality
That blue dress at the end reminded me a little bit of a black blouse you used to have wayyyyyyyyyy back when that I loveddd. It had kindofa detail like that in the front too
You should try Fairy Season!
I thought she put Shein for Scam, she in
Great video! Just bought from them, hopefully it'll be okay
I love your hair!
They're all scams.
I laughed thru this whole video you are hilarious 😂. And I was on break at work watching it and I was late going back oops! ❤️❤️
I love your channel and think you're so sweet but I really hate these kinds of videos. You should provide more research into where these clothes come from, why their so cheap, not just are they O.K. quality. To think about the sweatshops and chemicals that these cheap clothes all come from is appalling and you should cover those bases before promoting the clothes, because that's the true price tag (although the hidden one) that should be more considered. Love your channel, again, just wish you could consider that or talk about it.
YOU'RE ON TRENDING WOW. SO PROUD OF YOU, B. 👏💛💛💛💛
I noticed that you wore your hair the same in the other two hauls you mentioned!! Haha. How funny is that!
I LOVE SHEINS T SHIRTS, THOSE ARE BOMB.
With your body everything is going to look good on you. I just don't like that rainbow dress just because of the color.
All I can say is gawd that bawd!
More try on hauls from scammy sites please!
I've been successful with some bathing suit purchases from Shein. Their high waisted bikinis are so cute.
Shein, romwe, zaful, etc., are in no way a scam. They just have generic clothes in low quality material. If u mostly shop on these site then u either have a bad sense of fashion or ur just broke. I used to have 10 items from Shein n only 1 that i like. The rest r in the local goodwill.
Currently watching off my\nPhone I live in Florida and I am on day #6 of no power, your video gave me a little normalcy for today thbak you
If you keep the shorts, turn them inside out and pop them in a lingerie bag when you wash them to protect the applique from 'fuzzing'. And dry on low if it's cotton applique since it would shrink - probably poly, tho.
Unrelated but can you do a workout routine video?
I feel like a block when I watch her try on videos. But at least I can be a cute block. 👌
Loving that you're trending but not digging the negative comments from people who obviously don't normally watch your videos. 🙄
Your dog.... melts... my heart 8:48
I remember Rainbow Brite! She was totally WAAAAAY before my time.
I would love to see you do a Wish haul but instead of clothing you could do beauty/makeup products and tools!
I love that you test these websites out for us!! 👐 i love your sense of humor!! you are so funny 😂
Pump and dump
Your trending gurl!! 💗💗👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
I love how you have a is this a scam? hairdo, lol.
I stay away from those sites. The best quality clothing site imo is ASOS.
Hi Leighann, I live in Maine so cozy sweaters are high on my list this time of year. Lightinthebox.com looks like they have what I have been looking for, but it seems scammy. Want to check it out?  😁
Bone her kiss kiss
Wow you look like that nun from American horror story (also Shein is a bad website I order clothes and they came 2 months later and they didn't even fit. I'm a small person but jeez it's not good)
You'r so negative omg - I got a lot of stuff from shein and I love them all
you look like my g ma
LOL I'm a kindergarten teacher 😂😂
I assumed your top was just following the pajama-inspired trend, didn't realize it was actual pajamas! So cute 💕
Jamie xx's music makes me want to close my eyes and start dreaming, the man can do no wrong
Love that an unassuming Brit who looks like the only party he ever attended was at a chemistry frat cant stop marveling us with the most beautiful electronic music on the planet.
Finally! Best part of his Boiler Room Reykjavik set in my opinion
Video reminds me of the movie 'Momento'
I dream of a Smalltown boy remix
He obliterated the song? I mean it's a good mix, on its own, but why. 😫
Jamies style of music never ceases to amaze me. The main reason i stared to produce music of my own.
I'm so glad you released this!
He created a totally new song which is so good as the original one
Blondey McCoy makes an appearance, that's awesome!
Man, this is wonderful.
This is beautiful.
Jaime xx the best
So damn amazing
We want to see more of Romy!!!
beware of the church of scientology, it is an evil cult who want to ruin your life and steal your money, your life is at risk if you involve yourself with this organisation\nwatch this film for the truth about scientology\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6oYaMtJln0&t=73s
el mejor!!!
Amazing!!!!!!
Reminiscent of The Mackenzie feat. Jessy - Innocence. But I don't expect Jamie to be aware of 90's Belgian dance music.
Incredible, it could be love
oh this. this is beautiful.
This was on radio 1 only way a find this song was by shazam , im glad a did
my type of music
Just when i was losing hope on modern mainstream dance music this banger pops up (Jamie XX LAD)
wow ! jamie you are so ...
when is this going to be on spotify? :'(
With the new release of their new album and their Glastonbury set this year. The XX have been the soundtrack to my summer.
You're the fucking man Jamie.
Hmmmm damn this tracks pure bliss. The XX and Jamie haven't made a single bad song or track 🤗👐👐
Don't mind me, just here before this explodes! 😅
I love how basically all he did was use the ambience and bass of the original and its still sick
Thank you Jamie for all the music you make it honestly makes my day 100x better! I love you Jamie, Romy, And Oliver you guys are the best!
DOPE
Altas viagens nesse som.... Top de mais!
That was fucking amazing!

Listened to this during his boiler set, truly stunning! Check it out if you haven't already
Where does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\n\nDare me to, dare me to\n\nWhere does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\nYou've got the body, you've got the body

When apple releases a new phone i'm more excited about jack's parody than the actual product
iPhone 8\niPhone X\n*iPhone XO TOUR LIFF3 BY LILUZIVERT*
That black bar is a horrible design decision omggggggggg
Bigger screen better Hentai
Just buy an iPhone iPhone 5
A perfect description.😁
Betcha it's sponsored by audible
😕
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fuck Tim Cook,i love Steve Job
Not something New that iPhone steal a lot of stuff from galaxy.  Like face lock up and no home button. Galaxy 8+ came out before and it clear iPhone stole ideas.  And many others. I get that Samsung is big company in worldwide and they need make their own ideas not steal and make it their own. People must be stupid not see they are stealing.  Overpricy for phone that stole the ideas. Rip peoples wallet.
every time i think about buying the new iPhone i come here so i would not ..
Ohh the 1915 Apple fan boys just got burnt....
My mom might buy an iphone X so im gonna mess around with the animating emoji thing
I love the throwback to the old format of your parodies, Jack. Great job.
Apple did it again! So intevatititve
this comment section is full of jealous assholes who cant afford it😂
Yes ! ... Where do I enter my credit card details ?
iPhoneXpensive  \n\n\n\n\nSay hello to the future.\nSay goodbye to your wallet.
IPhone 7: Removes headphone jack. \n\nIPhone X: Removes home button \n\nIphone Y: Removes the screen\n\nIphone Z: Removes all buttons\n\nIphone None: Removes the whole fucking phone (Only for 1999.99 with FREE SHIPPING)
Fuck Apple, going to Samsung, never thought I'd say it.
so what happens if u set a smiley face as your lock screen and all the suddenly you been hit by a car crash.... how do you even open ur homescreen?
Laughed my ass off this whole video🤣
Thanks you for your life juice 
Can't wait for Xx_Šñîpër_Ëłîtė_Phøñê_xX
why buy the iphone x when you can buy 100,000 robux?
Since the beginning we wanted a phone that was all screen without borders Well why does it have more fucking borders than my Galaxy Edge then.
Like 90% of the comments here is Samsung users hating. \nI'm just enjoying the funny parody.
i died at life juice. \n\n\n\n\n\nalso what movie is that scene full of stone faces from? thats twice ive seen it in an iphone x video.
Music is so original never heard it before
1000 dollar emoji machine 😂😂😂😂😂
iPhone X, more like iPhone Xpensive.
Amazing
Sad thing is, is that this is completely accurate
This is so true!
This video wasn't even that good I mean look at that beautiful screen does that not look sleek and the new 4K 60 fps camera that's amazing it's expensive but I mean it's like 300 dollars more than any other flagship and the processor and face is scanner is two years in front of the competition use your brain
And people would still line up to by this crap .....and call it revolutionary
IPhone X huh. Face ID.. for our security...yeah :) Supercomputers have all our data stored up lmao they can track you anywhere
 you can't  afford it      I died
lmfao
Fuck Apple
This is accurate
#stickwithsamsung
LMFAO
*I CANT STOP WATCHING THIS* LMAO!!!!
It sucks my soul iPhone x
rip soul

The Xmoji Movie
3 million views, 3million subscribers. Coincidence? I think not.

It's literally trying so hard to be the galaxy s8 but worse
Marketing and advertising Offer: get an apple iphone free of charge. Get a new apple iphone every year. To enroll and get a 100 % free iphone move to the google search and type: *givefonesaway*
It's funny that James looks up to you even though hes more popular
You know someone is actually going to use that to remake the emoji movie just for a meme
since the apple company is a joke this is more of a documentary than parody.
they took out everything except emoji cause apparently thats what we want apple!! hope you got the sarcasm there .. ;)
New yiay question: help me write the emoji movie 2
So... how would you get on your phone at night?
This is why I hate iPhones. Putting unnecessary cameras, Snapchat emojis, it's not even a phone anymore. They could also at least put a digital home button like the Galaxy s8
yo 2k18 let a phone best it when it comes to facescaning 😂😂😂
1:56 Is that John Lasseter from Pixar?
IT SUCKS OUT MY SOUL????\njeez i wish i had a soul, so that i can sell it to the iPhone X
7- No Headphone Jack\n8- No Home Button\n9- No Color (Cause' Black and White is Vintage, A'might?)\n10- No Screen\n11- No Anything, it's just a donation at that point.
I was expecting more. C'mon you can do better. But OK.
I'm an apple fan and you got me 😭😂
Apple should give up already.
Why is JackFilms so mean to Apple. This is cruel and unusual and the IPhone X is what will put Samsung out of business for good because Samsung is a mean and barbaric company who’s commercials are so cringe and show off you will be part of their version of the Matrix except way more creepier and in control.
thank you for your faces.......
3M views in 4 days, well done viewers
This is what Steve would've wanted (probably)
This video just turned me away from getting the iphone x
I need a parody, not an actual commercial
LOL that was fucking awesome, keep up the good work!
You see now it's $800
The saddest part is that this is more accurately a translation, not a parody
You see now its 800$?! 😂😂
ahahahahahahahahahaha
this was SH*T!!

Who need iphone 8 plus too???
I think the next phone i'm gonna get is gonna be the iPhone 7 or 8. The iPhone X just seems like a status symbol, I mean $1000 for a phone? really?

I can't wait for David to have a kid because his reaction to seeing Taika is amazing. I can only imagine how he'd react to his own baby.
Geo's got that mom glow around her. She seems so different
Congratulations on the birth of Taika!💐
6 hours...lol I was  in labor for 4 days ...but omg I've been watching you guys for so longggg....so happy for you two...such a beautiful baby boy💞
I just spent like five minutes listening to an asian woman recite a speech to a baby.
Damn he's gonna speak 3 languages
Awww I cried!!! I cried! Tears of happiness for you both, ma & pa bear! 😭😍
Is she Asian or native american\hispanic?
Bart just sounds so happy in the beginning when he kept saying, good boy. T_T
Congrats Geo!  You have brought magic into the world.
Hold your baby Geo shit dont be so lazy
That baby is gonna be trilingual as FUCK!
I am crying in happiness this is beautiful
dude this is crazy I cant believe u have a kid dying
What is the stuff on taika's back when they were trying to clean him
The david and geo bond rn is so damn cute man

Holy shit. It's been this long. Crazy man, I've been watching these guys for like 6 years. Congratulations, best of luck. U guys will never know how much u influenced me and helped mold me as a person
6 hourd, thats weak, my mom was stuck with me for 28 hours, she went through hell
i would kill to have an uncle like Joe
Congrats!\n If you have a baby girl in the future and name her Leona then the house will be Leona's and Taika's  and Beaw's oh my!
Awwww David is being nice to Geo. Congratulations Geo and Bart.
I love your Filipino baby😂😂
octavius besides many things means 8th, coming in the 8th month, but waiting a couple of hours because his mom asked him to
This baby is soon gonna be goals.
TAIKA(ТАЙКА) in Russian means this is a girl from Thailand )
Who are the 178 (at my time of viewing) haters? I swear some people have no life, you can't just wish them happy? Does it trigger you that much that these awesome people are happy and you're unhappy about you're freaking life? Seriously!
Wait was baby taika born on the year of rooster just like me
This kid is going to be so freaking smart! He started out in this world learning 3 languages! I can barely speak English man!
Now, when's the Next one coming?
i have flatter feet than Bart lmao
Do you feel this finga enagee 😂😂
Congrats!!!!!!
Tiffs reaction made me tear up
CONGRATS!!
Congrats On LittleStrong T He Amazing
i would be on cloud 9 if i got sushi after my labour!
This boys going to the triangle at age 7 I'm 15 and I can't even speak one language right😂
Baby barely a full day old his grandma already telling him how to do taxes and shit. Bart's mom is defo something special ❤
Since you guys have short nick names like Geovanna and Bartholomew turns in to Geo and Bart. Will you call taika, tai?
he has to learn 3 languages
That kid is going to speak Chinese, Spanish and English what a beast
I really can't believe that was inside Geo for almost 10 months and now Taika is finally here this is so unreal- congratulations.
If u are born with no hair then u can bet ur ass that u gonna get bald XDD But there is nothing to worry for this little fellow haha
Really taika? Lol ok ok. It's not completely unexpected....but Why is Bart talking to his baby like it's a dog lol good boi. What a good boi
I really hope that my baby will have as much love as baby Taika did when he came into the world.\nCongrats!!!!
So did they give the baby's stats and I missed it?  Can someone tell me how much he weighed and inches. Just curious. He looks huge!
Omg I so happy for both of you guys and your family, they love him soooo very much and we do too. I can't wait to see him grow up to a handsome man and it great to see you guys living the dream.
Haha Taika is gonna be raised with multiple languages being spoken to him, damn I wonder which one he will pick up the fastest and which one he'll just understand but not speak\nAll his hair is from Geo's side, my nephew had a full head of hair when he was born and grew really long
Anyone find it weird that David gave geo a kiss on the cheek at 7:47?
i smiled throughout this whole video
What a beautiful family you've created. I wish you all continued success and happiness!
The baby's so healthy that is great and good luck to both  of you.
Seven different kinds of congratulations to you guys!! He's perfect! Good luck!!
David more excited than the bart and geo!!!!😅
❤️so happy for you guys ❤️
I never leave comments but I am just so happy for you all! Been following you guys for awhile and it's so surreal Geo is a mommy ! Congrats you guys 😘!!!!
congrats, literally in tears of joy for you guys !lots of love
My sister was born 3 days ago to
I'm literally crying right now I'm so happy for them
Taika has so much hair I was bald headed when I was born
Congrats, guys. Glad to be able to welcome Taika into the world.
Boy gonna grow up speaking three languages!!
he used to look like Barts dad but i think hes looking more like momma Geo.
Seems like his poop doesn't smell like Bart's fart.
AWWWW HE SO CUTE!!! Omg I'm so late
I started tearing up when tiff saw Taika, u can just tell she loves him so much ❤️❤️❤️
Asian parents, loud when they talk.
I hope to one day have friends and family like them ❤️❤️ \nI started crying 😭😭

the best thing about you all is you guys have fun with each other I see a future for all of u guys you guys are also so real with ur fans Simon Cowell has done well
I'm new 💕. Who is who lol. All I know is Brandon and he is cute af
See that scene where they're sitting in the rain? It's the tears of pride I've cried for the boys.\nSO HAPPY FOR MY BABIES!!!!
who and what is this ??? And where can I get more!!! XD <3
here after they didn't blow up.
Too much atuotune abd they are fucking ugly and like forty years old
Anyone else here from Nick's iconic boys days? No just me? Lol I love this! Awesome!
Literally I was here a few hours after it was released and the views were at like 30k and now it's over 200k😭😭😭😭I'm so proud of you boys!!!!
Who's here before they blow up!!
*emotionally holds hand over chest throughout the whole video*
There are 2 biggest Fandoms over here(in the comments section)\n1. One Direction\n2. Prettymuch
Is this the NewNew Edition?....oh you're too young? You don't know? Check them out, everything is recycled. Good NewNew sound though.
I don't like when some people said that thay are like k pop boy group,  I don't think so , because thay are pretty much, they can sing , dance and dont need  makeup , more manly then kpop bands. It's reality. I dont say that kpop groups are bad, just i dont like when they act like children .
looks like a korean boyband, much better one direction. why, because members like more master dancing than singing 😂😂
Better than kpop they dance better and have more talent \n\n\nBefore debut kpop : they train until they dance perfectly and learn flips and stuff plus go on a strict diet like no noodles or bread \nBefore debut pop : dancing skills dont matter but they practice alot\n\n\n\nStill love the song though
I WAS HERE BEFORE 1MIL
I LOVE THEM!! THIS SONG IS AMAZING
Omg, this is everything! Love them already😊
they have the swag
@whydontwe we got some competition boys these guys are fire my new fave song
im here before they blew up, note it please.
MY GOD I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!! THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST THING I'VE SEEN ON YOUTUBE!!! LOVE Y'ALL 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤
wait isn't it supposed to be PRETTYMUCHVEVO not PrettyMuchVEVO
FINALLY an American boy band that can at least DANCE.
I LOVE MY BBYS SO MUCH
You guys and this song is amazing!
i love the song, perfect for a debut :D
THIS IS WHAT U CALL MUSIC BITCH YESSSS I LOVE THE 90's VIBES IM CRYIN
Finally heard this song on the radio this morning! Proud of you all!!!
I instantly became a fan when I heard this song last month. I'm so happy it finally has a music video!!! And I love it!!! Now I can't wait for an album 😊
THEY ALSO DANCE??? YAAAY now we're talking
just two words: in love <3
I'm guessing these guys are the new era Backstreet Boys? I mean, I like them, a lot more than the origins of One Direction, and I'm not even being hater or sorta.
new band very good but they got long way to go to be the best
I wouldn't mind if you come to Denmark
I'm so proud of Nick omg..I remember supporting him during the Iconic Boyz days. I'm glad he continued his passion
I found this song on Apple Music, and I loved it when I started listening to the song for 1 minute and I just love it so much! If PrettyMuch sees our comments, then PrettyMuch, we think you'll become something really big and you will be successful! I love you guys ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I like 've this song

Such a bop!!
I love it!
nope. wouldn't mind , thanks for asking 😂
😍🇧🇷❤👏👏🎶Brazil
i like one direction but i don't get why some of the 1d fandom hates prettymuch, like their music is actually great and they dance well. they're not even trying to be the next one direction.
They are they next backstreet boys but 10000000 times better ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ok, to everyone who is comparing  them to Why Dont We....stop. They're both great and aren't even competing.
Wish the had more to offer cause I like them.There's just nothing special about the song, video or attitude. Cheap imitation 1D but trying to be edgy.
Came to check these boys out and although its not my cup of tea I have to admit they got nice vocals. I hope they have bright future and best of luck to them!😊
What is this 1999 ? 0:31
PRETTYMuch Feat Kpop group
I love all these boys 😍😍😍
Why don't we is way better because they have actual talent and looks
The guy blondie don't sing alone or I'm crazy?
*Why don't we > PrettyMuch*\nDon't hate me lmao I love this song
Wdw is better they need to go home - Shane Dowson
So what does a dude need to do  get subs in youtube world? I upload often but how do I get people to check me out?\nReply       ▼
If only I could have 1$ for every time Alex said range in this video.
I love how intense it is
i was about to say cs:go trailer but someone got first :/
i would destroy them
Now if this was H1Z1, if one of them had a computer that wasn't as good as everyone elses. By the time they hit the ground everyone would be stacked and or dead
Nope nope not real life battle grounds you needed more area vehicles and a fuck  ton more people
I vote mark only bc he got the scar xd
AM A SNAKE, FOLLOW ME
That chick got headshotted at point blank range
Jungle Island! So awesome you got to use the whole facility!
i can't believe that you forgot the pan ! and someone must run with pants off :D its not pubg anymore its just a typical pintball
Dude this looks awesome I have to do this with my friends
13:25 what a save by Matt he's OP
They know tactics lol serve your country you fucks
Matt shooting leah in the head was hilarious
WHERE IS THE FRYING PAN
Doing 1k subs with no vids challenge, need help
I didn't know that Node played airsoft
Why is D always panting so freaking hard
That 20 second revive was no more than 5 seconds
Of course it's D to win it
They should have rented a plane to jump out of.
What kind of seconds were those?
This looks really awesome! Now, what if there were more players/squads to play...?
This is so cool!
Hey that's some seriously dodgy revive counting.
I would be too aggressive in a situation like this
I think that's paintball island in riverside
Playing this would make me puke drunk happy.
D and Matt all the way
Dude I'd so be down to do this with you guys
Jet playing Where's Waldo in a shooting game isn't a great move. You need a shirt that doesn't say I'M HERE!
this is such a cool idea! i wish it was easier to tell when you get hit in airsoft, otherwise I would be posting this on facebook right now lol.
Cool
Needs more motorcycle backflips.
Someone's snapchat went off listen carefully 8:41
Amazing video, keep it up guys!
E vik lol
d is holding chanka
noobs Niko
Isnt this just... Airsoft?
this isnt a airsoft gun...........
and kar98k..?
This is freaking stupid.
Do another one
Big thanks to Evikk dot com.
5/10 not even pan :/
This would be better if someone who wasn't playing called the circles and radio'ed everyone. If D planned everything then he would know where the circles were and could then get in a good position before anyone else. (Also if D helped plant the guns/gear he would know which houses to head straight for)
We fet all our gear from evick its pretty cool
They say PUBG but playing ArmA3 Music?
13:15 to 13:30 Mat makes come plays🎯
the problem i see with this is the death screen isn't accurate. it should say there are only 4/4 not 8/8 and when both of the squad mates are dead it should go down to 3/4 and so on
From where can I buy the AK-47 (kalashnikow) toy gun? Thanks early.
Mark's death was sad
0:41 all the guns we're using are actual guns... WOAH WOAH WOAH!!!!!!
I wish i had friends like these...
sam you're dead. just die.
A game of player unknown battlegrounds just using my fists and hiding
This is awesome but having a cunt just ruins this video
should have all jumped from a plane first
thie video was uploaded on my birthday!\ni dont want likes i just noticed that
is that arma music playing at the start lol?
china number 1 was a nice touch hahaha
What mask is mark wearing
This some hunger game ****
why you have arabic writings in the map?\nfucking racist
Cool idea!
Nice evic link
Evik?
lol evick
wtf
Amazing
MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12:08 matt counts realistically to 6 seconds
Oh hi mark
13:18. That headshot do!
Do this at night!!!!
Yo, I got a red bull
china n 1 ！！！
LMAO
Supercool video good job
15:35 that dude tho lol
Stop copying novritsch
All those rusted up old bullnose Fords. Sad :(
2:25 unwatchable, vaulting not in game yet. Pls do crouch jump next time thx
That was INTENSE!
Awesome vid!
Is Sam matimio?
1:47 CHINA #1
poor
ArmA 3 theme just politely playing as BGM
No Pan?? cmon!
Found waldo
CHINA NUMBA 1
fuck this shit
Airsoft  is fun 🔫
Why do they KEEP saying contact. Contact is when you are taking fire like you know...actually making contact. You don't say contact when you see someone. There is a different phrase for that.
I didnt like it much it was more like acting
the team with an asian won is this a sign
I was honestly thinking those shoes are so tall, how does she walk in those? Right before Tan fell 🙈
Where are your sunglasses from😍
Tanya, for what it's worth, I think it worked out better that you had to wear your trainers, especially when it came to taking photos with everyone. That SAME thing has happened to me in high heels and, oh my gosh, the pain was terrible! I actually relived it watching this. In fact, I had to look away when you showed the photo when it happened. Glad you're ok!
What Jim wants is a pasta or salad bowl, which both have low sides: http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/food-drink/best-pasta-bowl-marks-and-spencer-habitat-denby-royal-doulton-a7043676.html
What was the mac lipstick colour you where wearing at the event? I NEED!💗
Loving the new camera
Love the dress, sunnies \nSo pretty \nYou look gorgeous \n\nLove this vlog
I would love to know how to shop for your shape, or if you even think about it at all! I love your style
Where we you having coffee..looked really nice in the terrace area?
Show us the mirror you buy for your stairway Tan when you get it.love things like that.xx
Where are your sunglasses from? They are so gorgeous 😍
You are a delight.....!🌟🌟🌟
please do a fall wadrobe video ♥♥♥
I did the exact same thing in shoes with an ankle strap! It was ligaments in my leg just like you described not the ankle at all really! Ouch!
Where is your footstool from?? love it!!
You need to throw away those shoes! Regardless the price! They're dangerous! 😂
You are a great person and I hope your ankle is better be blessed!!!
Love you so much!!💗💗💗💗
Tanya, I've been watching your videos for about 2 years now, and I honestly keep forgetting that you're well-known or 'famous' or however people want to put it. It's not at all that I don't think you should be :D (obviously, because you're so lovely and talented and beautiful, and the list goes on...) but it's just that you are so down to earth and modest! I mean it would seem obvious that many people love you because of YouTube, but ironically, even while I'm watching you on YouTube, you seem more like a friend than someone on my computer screen who so many other people also follow.\nJust thought I would share what was on my mind :P I'm sure many of you, watching, can relate!\nHope that makes sense. Haha!
Look for pasta bowls! Think that's what jim's  after
Rolled ankles take longer to heal than broken because they arent casted. Wrap it and ice it. Don't wall on it for 2 weeks or else it will Never heal!!! Ice and bed rest and crutches for you. Plus pnce you injure your ankle that ankle will be prone to injuries for he rest of your life had the same thing happen to me
The focus is really good. Good 🎥
Never knew they personalized Yorkshire tea! My dad works at Taylors of Harrogate and makes those and I never knew, I love Yorkshire tea!
You look beautiful Tan. I hope your ankle feels better. Please look into a plant based diet as you dont need to kill to cook and no life need be taken for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Love your channel, Ive been following you for the last 7 or 8 years. Take care of Jim and Martha. ❤❤❤
My best friend and I were so happy we were able to meet u.  Love u sooo much 💕😍😘❤️
You look so lovely Tan, that dress is one of the nicest outfits I've seen. When I saw those shoes I thought they looked dangerous, had some similar and did exactly the same last year. Tore ligaments and was hobbling around for weeks , all the way through a holiday in Dubrovnik! You're a trouper for not crying lol and powering through!
How gorgeous you look in that dress!
what is the lipstick your wearing??? ❤
Tan's vlogs are the best <3
I've preordered your book Tanya x
I feel your pain! I fell and sprained my ankle in July and it took ages to heal. Hope you're feeling better already!
OMG!!! I love those glasses!!! Beautiful and they look so amazing on you! xoxox

The red dress is so flattering on you!!!
Love this so much!! Tanya we love youuuu!!!! Check out my new vids xxx
5:20 - I think he's looking for a soup plate then. Love your taste in home ware!  xx
Sounds weird but your teeth urghhh I'm so jealous 😕❤️
That dress is gorgeous and oh so feminine! 😍
Out of interest, how much tea does the average Brit consume a day and why do they love it so much?
You inspire me so so much, your my hero. You make me so happy every time I watch you, you make me smile. I've been watching you for 2 years now and since I get really stressed and have anxiety I have loved to come home every week excited to watch your videos and have something to look forward to, like a reward. Thank you for just doing what you do, you are amazing and have really helped me get through tough times. 💕🙂
Hope your ankle is better👍✳️👍✳️👍✳️
can u do more what i eat in a day videos i love them !!
Hey Tan, your so inspiring! Thank you die uploading a new video! But when i read the title i that you were going to talk about mentally getting hurt and i would be interested to hear you talk about that! Xx
Love the new Vlog camera! 💗
Omg I'm in your vlog ahhh I'm so happy 😁✨🙌 it was nice to meet you at reserved
Great video! What card holder did you have in your bag? After one and yours looked perfect as it had a zip for change too. Xx
I have the exact kind of bowl you need and bought it in John Lewis.  Eat my pasta and stir-fries in it.  Sorry I can't photograph it - it's in my London flat- but it's white and perfect.  BTW you always look amazing, I love your make-up line and the make-up you're wearing today.  Would that be Woodwinked eyeshadow from MAC?  Lots of love from me Kate xxx, and from my five yo daughter Maya xxx who is your biggest fan and loves baking your cakes ❤
PLEASE tell me where your sunglasses are from!!!! Omg they are to die for.
I JUST LOVED WHEN U SAID MOROCCO; YOU MADE MY DAY TANYA <3  ! LOVE FROM MOROCCO !
The book you held up, Conversations with Friends, is currently on my bedside table. I am just getting into reading it! I bought it in Paris when on a girls vacation with my best friend. Tanya, I hope you enjoy reading it when you get time 😄
I'm already getting excited for Vlogmas. Am I the only one? The shopping in the beginning just gave me the Vlogmas vibe :D
Aww loved this video Tanya! You look stunning in this video
Where did they go for breakfast? Looks stunning!
oh my goodness - seeing a meet and greet like that shows how exhausting it must be! and on a twisted ankle too! you are awesome, tan <3
I love Kate's outfit! Does anyone know where her coat is from? :) x
Coach nude patent loafers would have been comfortable and looked great with your dress.
Oh wow! It's so weird seeing the meet n greet in fast forward!!
I can't wait for your Christmas Vlogs!!!!!!!
Love that red dress. I felt your pain when you fell. I've sprained my ankle twice and it's not fun. Glad yours wasn't that bad
So amazing to see you loving  my national clothing brand 💓
I love your vlogs so much 💜

Ahhhh loved the dress so much on you that I just ordered it straight away! You poor poppet with your ankle, I so felt for you, I hate falling over so totally got that you felt a bit shook up! Hope it was okay after your busy day! X
Did You know that Reserved is from Poland?
Love the new camera xxx
I think you might have lightly twisted your ankle there Tan. So I think you resting it is probably good, also should have picked up a compression bandage.
Well wishes for your ankle lovely! Try a heat compress.
Amazing vlog ♥
Probably a sprain, so if it's really swollen and bruised wrap it and it'll be better in and week or two
Oh my goodness where did you get your sunglasses, they are the exact pair I've been looking for??!
Don't you just love when people have actual meaningful conversations with you?!?! I think It's the best, love meeting new people.
Hi Tan! Loved your vlog as per! Bit random but I wanted to make a recommendation for shallower bowls if you're still looking for them lol, Sophie Conran has the most beautiful wider, shallower white ridged bowls that are fab for stir fries & pasta etc. Zoë x
<3
What vlogging camera is this?
love the  outfit
Hey! Amrit pal is ginger :)
good👍
Trending number 2
SECOND ON TRENDING 😇😇😇😇😇💜
My tour tickets came today!!
Looking so lovely Tanya ❤️
Love your dress! X
Going to Reserved  tomorrow!
sunglasses!!!
love your dress! sorry your ankle got hurt
Does anyone know if Tan's lips are naturally that size or if she has lip injections/something like that?  She has the most beautiful lips and they look extremely natural.
I love the lip color you're wearing, what is it please?
Oh no! This has sold out in my size- I wanted to wear this red dress for a bridesmaid dress!
I wonder if Tanya would ever like my magic...
Does anyone know where Tanya's pyjamas are from?
Hi Tanya, I'm also an EGYPTIAN and I watch basically ALL of your videos! I'm a huge fan!💕
This hair ages you.....plz have it like before!
To the girl (anyone who knows) at 15.05 where are stripe trousers from? Maybe like so more people can see? Thanks!
Mayweather, you just got yourself another fan...MAD RESPECT!
Of course the media took it out of context
Did this fuckin bitch really have the nerve to say that to him? This guy earned his shit it didn't fall from the fucking sky. Dumb ass bitch!
see as a latino. There is only one kind of politics that effects me directly. Money.\n\nI see politics this way. Who wants to put more hands in your wallet? Politically it is the Democrats who want to turn you upside down and take you for everything.\n\nImagine, just imagine, if Sanders would of won. TMT would have to pork up 80% or 90% of this mans labor! \n\nThis is why folks like Trump do not scare me at all. Democrats scare the hell out of me.
Mayweather knows what's up. He grabbed the whole damn world by the pussy.
DACA people have no right to be here.. They take money away from American children and families they then take jobs away from American children and families... It must end. The wall must be built and I have a ton more respect for Floyd Mayweather after this.. Trump the man.. He is doing what needs to be done to make this country the country of excellence it wants to be.. No more lowered standards and free handouts to people that hate us.. That all ends.. Its AMERICA FIRST from now on!
Mayweather is a smart man. He should have never done this interview because he is in a room of ignorant libtards. Correct - black, whites, latinos and asians voted for trump.
How'd Trump win? HARD WORK!!!
And as far as dreamers go...If a man breaks into my garage and lives there with his son for 20 years and I eventually catch them, and dad goes to jail, am I obligated to let the son stay because its the only home he's known?
Link to full video with this interview?
New respect for Floyd
Trump likes real Black people but Obama is an effemenette George Soros puppet.....Obama is half white but was raised by whites and sent to Harvard he only acts black around black guys to be cool but he moves really white when he lifts weights and throws baseballs or shoots hoops he doesn't look black at all
Floyd needs to check his white privilege!!!!......oh wait?
Floyd is the American dream, he came from nothing to become the greatest, respect
No white pepole there where's the white brother ????
Floyd Mayweather isn't dumb as most people portray him. They will give a forner a loan before a black person. Very true.
Mayweather is Conservative even though he is black. lol. He talked about how IRS should use his tax $ for disasters (So why he has to donate?) & now he says Trump talks like a real man.
Trump didn't say he actually he grabbed a woman by her you-know-what. He said THEY'LL LET YOU GRAB THEM BY THEIR P__Y because you have a lot of money and that's what some women do when they're in the presence of famous.
I agree 100% with the money man.
Fuking host talking shit he don't even do his research on, just more talking points pushing false narrative. Trump put DACA back on the table for it to be negotiated and law like shits supposed to be, not dictated like B.O. Overreach
5:11 chick didn't hear a word Mayweather said. He did not live a blessed life! He worked his ass off. He put everything into making himself better. Dumb beeyach!
Well put Floyd! You sir are a great American.
AMERICA BECOMES A MESS AFTER A TERM FROM ANY DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT! NEVER EVER VOTE A DEMOCRAT ❗️
I totally agree with Floyd.  100%
LOL at all of them not saying shit against him because they'll be thrown off the money train they freeload on. They didn't expect that response, did they? Anyone else would be called a racist KKK member.
Hah!  Floyd rocks!  Thanks for posting this.  I wish you had posted the whole interview tho.Floyd kept on talking about the individual.  That's what this country is about; individuals, not identity groups.
Lesson is people should focus less on news, politics and other people in general, and much more on themselves and how to make money. That's a good lesson, only thing is 99.99% of people are working for low or average wages and not for hundreds of millions in 36 minutes... 99.99% of people wont retire at 40, will work hard as fuck and still take the bus instead of riding a Bugatti. So that's a good lesson but it has its limits.
Before the McGregor fight, I always thought of Mayweather as a showboat. After he beat down McGregor, my view of him changed slightly in a positive way. Now after watching this video, I have a lot of respect for him. You can see those brainwashed on the plantation pepole in that room starting to get triggered but were at a loss for words. They couldn't believe a black man was speaking of Trump in a positive view. As a Hispanic I can totally confirm what he is saying about these immigrants who are ungrateful hate this country and but won't go back to their home country even though they are always talking about how great it is there. They way I look at is, if the dreamers want to stay, they should take a course on the US constitution, pay a fee and then have to do 4 years of military service. Not all of these dreamers are kids anyway. A lot are late teens, 20's and 30's.\n\nThey system is afraid of the minority groups getting woke to the the real manipulation. They would rather have you believing in their version of being woke: Divide and conquer, race and ethnic politics, etc.
I don't know when Youtube got full of fake accounts, but it's surely full of them now. I honestly don't see anything wrong with what Floyd said. But Floyd definitely ignored the elephant in the room.... most black people are genetically inferior when it comes to intelligence. People have tried to cover this up for decades, but the science is no longer deniable. There are SOME intelligent African Americans, some.... but the majority lack the genetic ability to truly become more intelligent people. The media tries to hide this daily... but look at the protests. The constant whining. The low graduation rates. The lack of success at historically black colleges compared to other institutions. The faster people understand that we're all different in one way or another, the faster we can do the right thing for America.
People love to hate Floyd, but he is a smart guy.  Respect.
If I was Black , and was like how I am now (Meaning same in Spirit (just happen) to be White, I better not be called a 'Coon' for dressing up nice, working Overtime, being a good Uncle or Father, eating good foods, helping others and working out.  Then I would  feel like I did as a kid being picked on by other kids,  that is the definition of a BULLY\nGod forbid you have an opinion about something....  so because a lot of  Italians wear gold jewelry and I don't ,  that don't make me the slang term equivalent of a Coon for what an Italian doing something like that would be...does it ?\nThat's like saying if I get a German Shepard, instead of a Pit-Bull,  I'm suddenly a 'Coon'   Fuck outta here,  its called I don't conform to society and follow others, its called.... I can think for myself.  \n\nIts judging people because if you say someone is a 'Coon' , that is Racist in itself unless there is something full blown pure support for something that would be evil or against the law...like a Black person supporting the KKK is Ironic and that would I suppose make someone a 'Coon'.....  but what the hell would be a good example ??    Supporting the Republican Party ?   well there again that would be judgmental and Racist, since even though I am sure there are racist Republicans, I bet there are racist Democrats too.\nIn the end,  anyone calling someone else such a name is a Bully or just all together jealous.
Good for him. TRUMP 2020!!!
And this whole DACA thing. Another propaganda to make Trump look worse than what he really is. Here's an example. If a parent sneaks in their kids to Disney Land, they get caught and thrown out. Whose fault is it? Disney lands? Or the Parents?
Tell it floyd!!!
Exactly how do you hold someone running for president to a higher standard for something he said in a private conversation that was secretly recorded then released years later?  Set em straight Floyd!
People are going nutz because Mayweather didn't jump on the anti-trump bandwagon and embrace the victim-narrative.. he 'worked' from the bottom-to-the-top (50-0) 'everyone' who puts their mind to it can do that.. a new found 'respect' for this man.. Outstanding Floyd!
I loved when he put that bitch in her place when she said he lives a blessed lifestyle. The man clearly worked his ass off to get to where he is. I don't like the way Floyd fights, but he is pretty down to earth.
real talk, never seen a mayweather interview, much respect
Fuck that bitch at the end trying to diminish this man's accomplishments. She just mad cause she defined her own success as ho.
Have to love how he took the question and made it about himself. No one who has ever supported him UP TO THIS POINT has ever questioned his work ethic. That has to be pointed out because I guarantee that now lots of people who HATED this man are now jocking him. But he answered the question just like he fights. Avoiding the opponents strengths. Stick and move and never let them take their best shot at you. But he really didn't say anything
There AIN'T no legislation coming against the dreamers.  Trump gave Congress 6 months to PASS legislation to KEEP the dreamers!  People trippin because they ain't listening!
Wow just change my mind on this guy now\nSmart dude
mayweather's unshadowed intellegence radiates\ntypical man to man talk nothing new floyd is being intellectually honest unlike the rest    msm & political oppositions are so grateful for that comment  a perfect tool for the hypocritical political attack from msm/hilllary and all those  bill clinton apologist
Floyd is too real for this show. They try to pull him down into the muck because that's all they know how to do?
Respect to him... that seems like a real man right here!
this guy makes a lot of sense . hope all the idiots start listening to a real winner .
FLoyd should be Honorary American of the Year
Floyd had integrity, mad respect for him! Stop complaining and get your lazy ass to work trumpaholics!
Supported in the fight and support even more now.
He is not sending kids back but ok ... good shit mayweather
All the other mfkrs in that room all pissed at his views........  you can see it.          All those chics total herd chics brainwashed by leftist media they don't even know is left.
I wished basketball or football stars were more like boxing stars
I can't stand how the radio host straight up lies about DACA and what Trump did starting around the 3:23 mark. Get your shit straight, brother.
He's right that people can't handle real. We all have to pretend we're saints when the public is watching.
Since when does a real man grab random women? Real men don't do that. Anyone who thinks this way needs serious help.
Floyd Mayweather laid down the real truth about one's responsibility to take care of your own ass first, accomplishments, growing up and being an adult. Big Kudos to FMjr.!  It was great to hear him shut that woman up when she wanted to imply that he some how was born with a silver spoon. Hell no, he worked his ass off and developed the God given talents he was born with.
Liberals care so much about brown people from other countries than they do black americans and poor white americans
I have so much more respect for him now.
That guy interviewing Floyd is an uninformed moron. Trump isn't kicking anyone out and actually gave them a lifeline of 6 months for Congress to do their job. How do stupid people constantly end up in positions like this?
One sided questions. What about the other candidate calling young black men super predators? What about Obama and every other candidate also fighting illegal immigrants? What about abortion targeting blacks? What about democrats running poor inner cities? What about Trump meeting with black leaders and why not talk about Ben Carson? I have never had as much respect for an athlete as I do Floyd right now. Floyd Mayweather, thank you for changing millions of views and waking people up.
much respect for F.M. jr.! truth as it is.unbiased
Man, I dont agree with the last fight but Floyd just got a 51-0 on my card.
I like this man....Trump has a job, taking care of American People, NOT foreigners. \nGo dream somewhere else, especially if you hate America.
the host is like a mother bird, just regurgitating that narrative into the microphone.
I LOVE FLOYD MAYWEATHER. I AM A RACIST WHITE SUPREMACIST.......IN THE EYES OF LYING LIBERALS.
Whole new respect for this cat now. Legend
Mayweather went to the inauguration and has been friends with Trump for years.
Where is the rest of the video
I dunno who that one with the Beats headset is...but he needs to walk into a library and trip over a big stack of knowledge:\n\nLegislative Branch (Congress) creates laws/come up with legislation It's what The Constitution says is their job, and that job is EXCLUSIVELY theirs. They do not work for The Supreme Court, and they do not work for the POTUS\n\nJudicial Branch (SCOTUS) interprets how the law is to be applied, and no other branch has that power. They cannot write laws, and they cannot put the law into action. The SCOTUS does not work for the Congress, nor do they work for the POTUS.\n\nExecutive Branch (White House) executes/puts the law into action; it does not have the authority to write laws or rule how laws are to be applied, and they cannot interpret the law. The POTUS does not work for Congress, nor does he work for the SCOTUS.\n\nThis is referred to the balance of powers. Three co-equal branches.\n\nPrior to DACA, the Congress tried passing legislation. When it failed to produce what Pres. Obama demanded of them, he wrote an Unconstitutional (illegal) executive order that was contrary to established law. He had already previously admitted that he did not have the authority to write DACA, and yet he did.\n\nThe DOJ (part of the executive branch, which answers to The POTUS) said they cannot defend the E.O. in court, so they rescinded the document and gave Congress 6 months to legislate it on their own. It's questionable whether a law written in Congress now will even save them in the eyes of the SCOTUS, but it's Congress' job to write laws, not the president's.\n\nDACA was an illegal policy that was contrary to law. It should never have been.
Can't wait for his loyal fans to turn on him for saying something a little bit positive about President Trump.
*BLACK CELEBS THAT SUPPORTED TRUMP!*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by-ler2Ly44
Mayweather knows his shit.
Mayweather just earned my respect. \nStrange timeline indeed!
FUCK THE DREAMERS!
Mah nigga!!
My man Mayweather!
yes, refer political wisdom from mayweather
Love it.
3:04 Out there picketing and holding holding Lol.
Respect
Trump/Mayweather: JUST WIN !
Mad respect for Mayweather. The black community on the far left will now call him a traitor, uncle tom, coon, and everything else because he has a different opinion than them.
Mayweather should stick to boxing instead of giving his ignorant opinions. Real men don't talk about sexully assaulting women and real men don't hit women. Trump might not be a racist but his policies are institutionally racist.
I agree wholeheartedly with Floyd. The Left HATES American exceptionalism. They HATE the fact that capitalism has produced the richest, most free society the world has ever known. They HATE that Capitalism creates outcomes based on effort and personal responsibility. They HATE that the system in the US allows one to determine their own destiny. \n\nHere is the thing about DACA: Only Congress can make immigration law (Article I; Section 8). So when Obama created DACA, through an Executive Order, he went around Congress illegally. Everyone knew that as soon as BO was no longer President that DACA could be rescinded. So by going around Congress (which has debated and voted against similar bills for 2 decades now) President Obama gave amnesty to illegals that he knew he was unable to give. So instead of blaming Trump (who Im not a fan of) maybe we should blame Obama who gave something he was unable to give OR blame the parents who made their iwn children party to their illegal activity (sneaking into the country). We never worry about breaking up American families when a black father sells drugs or a white father robs a store so non-citizens shouldn't get a free pass for breaking the law either.
Nothing he said was a lie.
I don't like the man as a person at all, but he isn't wrong about anything he said in this interview.
Total respect for the guy now... That's right dumbasses... TRUMP WAS NEVER CALLED A RACIST UNTIL HE BECAME PRESIDENT!! Do you like how they wanted to try and put them back in their box and he kept knocking them out with logic? ;)
it affects everyone because we're going to make america great again. liberals are all woe is me, welfare, dont want to work hard or try, expect life to fair and easy, and most of all dont know shit about nothin'!  they cant say anything except the last thing they hear on fake news but dont understand reality. they have no lives, they're not worth a million, they dont make life or death decisions, they cant grind for 16 hours a day, oh i had enough food today yeah i got enough water I guess im alright, thats all they accomplish do you hear me. there is so much work but there aint nobody that can do it, there is no such thing as a free lunch. the world is getting so damn soft and socially unacceptable. celebrities are not role models either. you got to do it for you not because you think there's a status to it or it makes a certain amount of money.
Floyd is the black man's Trump and Floyd's nuthuggers are the black Trumptards of boxing.
A rational man and a REAL American. Only weak bitches get caught up in everybody elses fights. Fight your own fights and stop being offended for other people. You didn't put dreamers in this situation. Their parents did. Obama only made it worse. Time to correct the problem one way or another and throwing rocks ain't gonna help.
That dumb slag backpedalled furiously when he stomped her the fuck down for implying he had been gifted a 'privileged' life. They are always the same. Gutless cowards when they get called out on their deceit.
He wasn't running for President 12 years ago when he mentioned grabbing the pussy.
wheres the full version of this
3:29 ...the new legislation they are putting forward to get rid of dreamers...totally WRONG.  There is no legislation about that at all.  It was a an executive order from Obama that Trump gave congress six months to figure out until it expires.  These liberals are so uninformed and indoctrinated by our media.
Thank god, civil rights leaders, and others worried about what their government was doing, because if they didn't he wouldn't be here. He needs to get some older people in his life, and not a bunch of sycophants, who remembered what it was like in America to have their dreams deferred, if they ever got a chance at all.
I am a white supremacist, and I'm a pussy grabber, and I lubed up America's asshole and lit Putin's cigarette when he finished fucking the election - so what?  I'm not losing any supporters.  \nSo suck my baby carrot, America.  I moved on you like a bitch.
#WINNINGOVERWHINING
Now all the black people that was PRO Mayweather will turn on him. His boxing style sucks to watch but he's 100% right with Trump.  All the people are shocked like they were talking to a murderer.....
Why would anyone care about what Mayweather thinks? Mayweather is a stupid boxer, that is probably illiterate. Who cares what he thinks.
This guy is so ignorant, he can't articulate himself, talking like a third grader child motherfucker. His place is in jail...

UGH I MISS PARIS SO BADLY😭😭😩
Where are your boots from? So pretty
Id love to see this video in España! 🇪🇸
The best thing I've ever eaten in my life was a pistachio creme brulee in a little cafe outside the Louvre.\nI knew exactly what face you were going to make at 9:32 when you tasted that.\nIT'S SO GOOD! SO GOOD!
Usually hate travel vlogs, but loved this! U actually shared the culture and were genuinly so excited and it really came through. Now I'm dying for a fricken chocolate croissant !!! Xxx
in your food diaries you eat a lot. do you eat that much just for the video or do you always eat that much in the course of a day?
Two of my favorite things. Melanie and France :)
with Your love of style and food a video in an italian city would be perfect
Using your video for inspiration on how to decorate my Year 9 French book haha\nLOVE YOU MEL, YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL XXXXX
That cover of stromae is wonderful!
Ahhh, seeing Notre Dame and hearing Lindsey Stirling's Les Mis medley made me legitimately emotional! I really want to go to Paris now!! (also i'm hormonal and sick so that's also not helping at all) I looked for your book in Easons Cork, and I couldn't find it! Probably good because I had told myself I was only allow buy the one book!
honestly just come to turkey and have some real food 😆😆
just back from  a walk where i spent 10 minutes trying to get a snail off the middle of the road with a leaf so he wouldn't get crushed by a car... clicks on this vlog and sees you saying your gonna eat some 'fuckin snails' ... sigh. I wish humans would learn to have respect for other life forms on the planet, then maybe they wouldn't destroy the planet and all the living things on it as much.
I had goosebumps the whole time I was watching this!
Oh Melanie if you ever come back to my lovely city of Paris, I'd like to meet you
Oh my god are you seriousssssss ?!?!? Mellll Nutella is Italiannnnn 😳\n(Sorry I literally live where they produce it so I just freaked out a little bit) \n❤️
You definitely have to come to India. The food here is mind-blowing
Your dad is always the best part of your videos. Has he ever considered starting his own YouTube channel? :)

What target audience  is your book geared towards . Looks beautiful there . What desserts r popular ? I say it again I love those yellow tight . I been inspired to find them here in Nashville . 💞😘
You should do a pub crawl in Ireland, and eat and drink and go through rules for tourists going to a bar (the dos and don't)!
you're the only person that's able to eat a peach and not look like a mess after 🙏🏼 love ya💗\nand nutella is italian i guess
I love that you used Lindsey Stirling in this. 😊
I feel so relaxed happy and also sad and rested but also feeling a calm restlessness. Beautiful vlog. There are many Pari vlogs, but this one is so different from those. Music helped the vlog a lot. Melanie you went up a notch with this one👌👌👌
Only 3 minutes in and this vlog is perfect
I can't wait until I get to move there 😢😢
Its been so many years since i was in paris. Would love to go back!
Paris looks gorgeous!! <3 & loved the red dress Melanie!\nIn case no one mentioned it yet, the first fruit you pointed out were prickly pears :D we get them lots in Malta!
I would love to go to Paris with you  next time 😁 And pls come to Norway and make a food vlog  😊
Your fringe looks like a lot like Amelie's when you were at the Café des 2 moulins... omg I really want to go there 😍
I got way too excited when you showed the Two Windmills. Amelie is my favorite movie.
Love all your dresses! I am so ready for that shape to come back into style cos my thighs aren't having this bodycon shit!
Such a nice video. I love France!
This gave me major Paris blues. It's my favourite place in the entire world! <3. I would love for you to do a food diary in Krakow, Poland xx
I love that Melanie says a little espresso, it's very cute. But actually that's the real size of an espresso in Italy, it's how it is supposed to be! Btw Nutella is Italian too.
I loved this and i really want to go to Paris!
Oh my god Melanie was literally talking about Dan Browns book and I was freaking out didn't know you like it Mel! I love it!! Ohh I am so excited rn😂
Aww I live in Paris, always have! You made me want to go back out there and explore with my tourist glasses on <3
My absolute favourite video of yours! The music, the filming, it was magical Melanie 💚

What a great video! We got to see Paris with a Melanie voiceover. :)  Nice. BTW, the red dress looks great on you IMHO.
That was a freaking joy to watch!!! Thank you for that wonderful morning boost Melanie. I loved your editing too btw with the beautiful French music, and beautiful choices too, it was so well done!! :D xx
I just died at 13:01. You are so great xD
Ethical omnivorism:):):):) yet...you have no idea where your salmon etc came from! LOVE IT !!!! You're so logical and smart Melanie!!!!!
Loved this video!!! Made me want to go to Paris so bad, especially with someone as lovely as you Mel :)
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Disney movie, and it is CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED!  THANK YOU for loving it too!  I'm glad you had such a fun time!
Hehehe, I joined in with your devious laugh at 6:46. You did a wonderful job putting this vlog together! The music, food, and everything else just complimented it so well. I also want to add that you looked unbelievably gorgeous in each dress. Seems like you had a great time!
Being a giant Les mis fan the music made this video so great!!! Loved it Mel, great video!!:) 😘
Have you heard the original of Tous les memes by Stromae? It's the best!!
I love this vlog ! Paris is so lovely ! I appreciate so much your good taste in french music in this video ! 😊😊😊
Currently eating a giant package of crisps...
Those weird fruit look like Tunas, we have them here in Chile, don't know if the ones in Paris are the same, but if they are, try them, they're DELICIOUS and juicy, perfect for summer!
Wonderful video!!!! (As always) 😊 also where are your boots from? I'm on the look out for a pair for the wintery months and your ones are perfect!
Where is that stripey red/pink and white shirt from?
Noooo, Nutella is an Italian product ❤ It was created by the Ferrero family, who lives in Alba, Piedmont (northern Italy). You should definitely come and visit this beautiful city, where you can find scrumptious food as well as fine wine 😉 By the way, love your channel ❤

My body is ready.
KKK Vamos ver se dessa vez nao tem bugs
This is relating to present for fight against aliens
There's something i haven't seen anywhere and its that back in a previous AC title, i think involving ezio, there's a statue for an assassin who killed cleopatra with a snake. So how is the creed working with her
The first thing I will do is ramming the enemy with camel
far cry primal vibes
This sent chills down my spine O.o
plisss 2018 build assasin in palestina plissss plisss
Do not worry guys. This trailer may seem like it is trying to make the Order of the Ancients creepy and dark, but the Order of the Ancients may not be as dark and creepy as you think they are. It is just like the movie trailer Mother looking like a horror movie when it turned out that Mother was not really a horror after all. Anyway, I am getting hyped for this game to come out.
Yup I just bought the gold edition :)
The order must be the early templers
This music reminds me something but I do not know where I heard it, maybe in a previous AC trailer ?
Awesome game can't wait!!! They should do one in Rome next!!! Or Korea
For me personally, it's a theme I would like to see explored more.\nso it's his Uplay Key GLOBAL:  https://www.g2a.com/assassins-creed-origins-uplay-key-global-i10000068314001?reflink=asc-key-global
I really wanna like this game but i just cant. i hope this revitalizes the series but for now im just not feeling this game which really bums me out because im a huge fan of the series.
Do yourself a favour;\n1. Pause the trailer and mute the sound \n2. Open a new tab \n3 Search 'Trinity' by James Dooley\n4. Play the song along with the trailer\nYou can thank me later ;)\n\n(That rhymed lol)
Please put multiplayer in it, its the most fun part of AC!
0:57 what are these people doing? Ubi..
October 27th is so close yet so far away
Going back means no guns, no cannons... \nBack to bow and dart I guess....
Mais uma vez a Ubisoft capricho no assassina Creed
It looks of the hook
ubisoft and there games are great i hope they bring back the style of venturing further the majestic feel hidden treasure ,experimental combats and great story line.
looks good but so did unity, I'll wait  before I spend my $
lemme guess, another 60$ for single player game! neat
00:46 the theme is fuckin epic !!!
4K Native Only On Xbox Console
Who else us more excited buy this game at any cost...
hot this game reminds me of Shadow of Rome!
Well now, this looks pretty interesting, maybe even deep and dark, and not because of the fancy graphics with the beautiful art.\nBut because of what it shows.\nI hope its not a misinterpretation, because this could really make Assassins Creed an amazing franchise again, since the end of revelation.\nAnd I just loooove the setting, obviously haha.
The guy at 1:03 looks like Ashraf Ismail !!!!!!!!!!!!
woooow it's so amazing
This trailer is really sick, what's the soundtrack name btw?\nI hope there is the possibiliy to loot their masks when you kill them, because I want to go around with that Anubis mask equipped for the entire game
WOW THE GAME LOOK LIT BTW IGNORE THE FKNN HATER
Assassin's Creed Original fantastico
looks cool. but the next one better take place in japan
Actual Ingame Footage
Безусловно, самый крутой трейлер на движке игры!
You guys need to have a free demo for Xbox and ps4 that way we can all get a glimpse of the game and buy it when it comes out
i hope brutus is in this game, the one who responsible for caesar's death
Lord Chin Chin is not pleased
This better relate to the ancient human civilizations.
Man I want this game so bad. Haven't been this excited about a game since news of rdr2. I hope it has a great story.
So these are like the egyptian Templars
Assassin's Creed should have a more Uncharted 4/God of War 4/Prince of Persia feel rather than a Witcher 3/arcade game feel. The trailers always have that feel but not the game. It'd be cool if the combat was like Assassin's Creed Syndicate but a flowed a little better like in Batman Arkham because the riggedness and repetitiveness of the fighting got a bit tedious in Syndicate at times. The animations seem blocky at times.
By the order of the Ancients.\n- Dragon Knight, Dota 2
This trailer is awesome i can't wait.
Wow! It's beautiful!
Here is how I feel...\nI have a PS4.\nEvery footage we've seen so far on Assassin's Creed Origins runs on XBOX One X. Now, I am not trying to criticize Xbox One X or the game itself and it's performance on XBX, rather it's one of the most gorgeous looking games so far and I love everything about ACO. So what is my problem? It's the fact that we will be seeing a different game, a downgraded game, when played on PS4 and Xbox One S. Those two consoles can't handle this game, in my opinion, even at 1080p with descent graphics and playable frame-rate (based on other game releases such as Final Fantasy XV or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt). To try and make it look good means they would have to compromise the frame-rate or in order to play in a (I consider smooth) 30fps, we would get really bad graphics. I fear that ACO for (especially) PS4 would be the same case with Unity or Syndicate. Unity looked beautiful but lacked frame-rate and performance and Syndicate was smoother but lacked the eye appeal that Unity granted. So basically what I'm saying is that the only choice you have on enjoying this title is to play it on PS4 PRO or Scorpio (consoles). Anything besides that, for this game and every other game to come, PS4 and XBS is a downgrade, and Sony and Microsoft aren't saying a thing about this issue because, I know, they do have better options. Pro (Sony), Scorpio (Microsoft), and now it's only up to the player if he/or she wants the better experience in the end, but of course, it'll cost you.
So bayek is working for Cleópatra ? My theory is that Cleópatra is gonna be Crazy for power
0:58 why are they running to the fire?
Getting me THIS CLOSE to canceling my pre-order for Shadow of War for this. I can only afford one and I own all the rest of the AC games.
Filthy Goa'ulds! Where is SG1, when you need them?
That Vivendi forces in the trailer? If you do not buy more stocks, your company will burn to the ground...
1:28 Legolas?
Hello Mr Ashraf Ismail ,My name is Lee Yoon Hang from Malaysia and 18 years old call me Jackson Lee. thank you out of the assassin creed origin,I am assassin's creed supporters and National Historian.  I hope you through the video games with mission. You promised me, you make the game is replay mission and replay side missions in sequence just like Assassin's Creed 3, Liberation, Black Flag, Rogue, Unity, Chronicles and Syndicate. You are lot less game thing is in the single mission is Explore the area Identify opportunities : (1. Stealth Opportunity 2. Assistance Opportunity 3. Unique Kill Opportunity) by Assassins Creed Unity and Syndicate. Challenge in Single Mission and Side Mission, DLC Mission and Side Mission, Back to Old Kingdom Egypt mission just like World War 1 by Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Don't forget the Important Character is Mark Antony Rome politician and general in Egypt. But Mr Ashraf Ismail I have a question ? A Chinese Warrior Character is come from the Han Dynasty (BC 202~220),Han Dynasty clothing is correct but why his hairstyle looks just like The Qing dynasty (1636~1912)? How do you explain the game director! Very so funny man. I'm National Historian of student. Thank you for the Egypt world I'm very so happy and I'm your Supporters.
SO Hype for this game !
Maybe their 4 primary leaders would be -- War, Famine, Pestilence and Death -- now that would be awesome.
Bugisoft
In 0:34 was that reference to a spilting of a sea????
Pretty sure Ubisoft wants you to know that the templars are the Ancient Ones :)
The Order of Ubisoft.\nMysterious figures, who seek the money of the ancient scrubs.\nHidden and faceless, they control the final content from the shadows. From downgrades to overpriced DLC's, their hunger for money and control is limitless.\nWhen Ubisoft craves for money, noone can stand in their way.\nTHEY ARE THE REASON FOR YOUR PAIN AND ANGER!\nIF YOU DO NOT ACT, THE GAMING-INDUSTRY WILL BURN TO THE GROUND!\n\n\n\nUbisoft will tear your wallet apart.\nWhat will you do, Casual?\n__________________________\n\nAnother AC Game, available October 27th.\nPre-order now and get a game, that isn't missing a mission, but we still add expensive DLC's with missions so you can enjoy the full game later for double the price.
Mummy?

The 10 plagues will be appear in the game?
I'm guessing the anubis guy is the Grand Master Templar
Dude, this looks like it's gonna have one hell of a story compared to the last few AC's. I hope it does well. If it gets a 7/10 or higher by steam I'll consider getting it. I haven't seen one worthy since Black Flag
The Arabs destroyed my Egypt... They r the reason of my pain and anger
THIS COUNTRY ?! come on Ubisoft... \nthe notion of country didn't even exist yet back in ancient Egypt era. There were only empires and unexplored lands.\nshould we take this as a bad sign for poor research work and possible more and bigger historical inaccuracies within the game?
The Order of the Ancients. So are they like Pre-Templars?
Remember, its ubisoft...
If you are stupid, please pre order.
Is this like the majjii from the old mummy movies?
I'm on the fence. Not a fan of the series and its mechanics, but Origins seems to have taken notes from the right games. Did Ubisoft finally get rid of abstergo's modern day side story, or is it in this game?
but the world is supposed to end September 23rd..
SO the mejai are both defender against the evil mummy and origin of the assassins. LOLOLOLOL
How can a group call themselves the order of the ancients? We, in the present day can refer to ancient times but an ancient order calling themselves ancient doesn't make much sense.
Remove that fuking centurion
I don't know why but, Assasin's Creed's graphics never looked like in sinematic trailer (You can compare)
In this AC you are supposed to be first Assassin ever? Weren't there like even older ones from Babylon or somewhere from Middle East?
Please refine the parkour system Ubisoft!!! Bayak has no flair with his free running it's going to be very boring to run around as him unlike it was with Arno!!! He needs his own flair, but you guys have not done enough to give him that flair!! I'm seriously doubting players will want to play the game very much if they can't traverse the world with creative flair and you guys have a month left please please please make it count and add this one detail!!
Am I the only one thinking who is this assassin and who in the hell trained him to be so good and unique
I don't think they are templars I think they're linked to the first civilisation
Ohhhhhhh! Are they gonna say the Plagues of Egypt were all caused by pieces of Eden? That's a really cool idea.
0:58 is the best. The stuck NPC running in a fire. I also love the ULTRA-LOW polygons all around.
So you create an organization to fight them and make a really really really stupid creed.  This should be a reboot and change that stupid creed.  Everything is permitted, remember?  How stupid.
Every ac game is the same,a  bunch of trailing missions and another bunch of assassinations.
please remove the slow mo and zoomed arrow thingy
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN SOOON !!!!
Maybe some armors/outfits with the greek/egyptian/roman style would be nice to see. And take your time to make this game great, dont sell us the name ... sell us a game that will love. And reconsider that dodge, too long!
WE
Just amazing! Got to get this album for sure. Oh how i loved this video, so incredibly calm and controlled, almost loving. Until it fails. Suddenly raw and brutal power.
Wow , The video is fantastic !
Excellent music and obviously excellent video .. Gave me goosebumps . i like it 👌👌
Well that Beat and Rhythm gave my Pituitary Gland a Work Out!, Seems you had a Fleck of El-Saturnus stuck in your Eye near the End!, U wanna watch that Bugger, She'l have your Soul!!!
Now, that´s what i call modern art! Brilliant! And best Kuka promo for sure ;-D But imho reduce CGI at the End. No need for - better more details on this amazing Artwork.
Hi Nigel. Is this mixed for a speaker field response or binaural response? Gonna buy the album real soon BTW!! And another curious question. What amp are you using with the hd800? Is that a portable one.. You keep moving around... Or a long cable from some amp like questyle cma800?
This is amazing. In true August Rush fashion, the piano keys being struck aren't even close to what pitches are heard, but this is still amazing.
This is amazing. and i mean totally and utterly jaw droopingly amazing.
p.s. ..was keep waiting, when Arni will appear finally! )).., but in general very cool work above!, I should admit! ) -->\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J4dfO6Zf6c ! ))) , Sorry! :)
Not long and we will attend roboconcerts!!
This music reminds me of I robot 2004 😄
Some serious talent Nigel. I was blown away by cymatics and again by automatica, excited to see your next project
This is absof***glutely awesome Nigel!! I watched three times in a row
Several times watched.. Really liked the music. The video is fascinating.. Thank you!
this is so sick.. hope will become like you one day.
This is a Masterpiece! Didn't know that you collaborated with Skynet and Genesis ;)
I think there was no need for machines to destroy the place
I always love your music videos, great work
Fantastic would be a weak word to describe this...It certainly is a great counterpart to Cymatics!  I wish it was even longer...i was just gettin in the groove.  Hey +Nigel John Stanford , did you ever get accidentally smacked in head during the making of this, with the robots?
Those who did this - are gods!!!!!\nNothing more epic in my life has seen\nThank you world, that there are such talented people\nP.S. Sorry for my English
I love this record!!! All the best from KUKA POLAND!!!
Your three yewrs of work left us mesmerized
I get that the laser and smash are not real, but what about the rest? are they moving so precisely? or is it CG?
This video would be far better with handheld cameras. The computer controllled cameras makes everything look rendered.
Here before the 10 M views ^^
Holy shit that was amazing. Another good job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
are the piano parts at 2:36 and 2:46 in real time? if so that is insane
Very cool the video.\nWhen comes the next? :-)
Thats the cooled f'ing thing I have seen on along time.  And one my first ever comments.  Make another.
Nice video, but second album is bad. Your first album was amazing. Come back to roots.

This is sick! amazing !!!!!
I listened to it again and again.\nAnd it just feels great!\nI mean the music, you are really good at music!
P U U R R F E C T
not quite as cool as cymatics but still really cool, bit too much micheal bay happening in this one tho
Outstanding! Going to need to compile a list of about a 1000 ppl who need to see this haha. Great job Nigel and everyone involved.
Best of greetings from KarimJovian He's in love with this video!😉👍🏻 Great job!
Love your work, it is inspiring!
Nigel Stanford music above expectations...  Beyond words and excellence, our admiration and respects to creativity, photography, video recording and direction! Who said it was going to be easy?? Worth the waiting!!! The Pablo Picasso of music on this new century. Much love & sincere blessings, to you and all those who helped you achieve this new masterpiece!!! 💕 Taking note, a great idea to add to our wish list of special gifts, for dearest friends and family!
this isn't what I meant by electronic music
Elon Musk is now giggling in his den ...
This is awesome! The song, hard work to program the robots, the video concept, great!\n\nAlso confirms my grand automated future skepticism :)
I sure wish it was longer!! Thanks ! Great tune!!

Short, VFX filled, energetic videos with a comedic tone...you guys might be onto something.
I have the same couch
1000 people in wheelchairs disliked this video.
Why the guck is he whispering if he wants to wake him up? 😂😂
Anyone else notice that the clock went from 2:19 to 4:17 to 3:44?
legends say once they touch the floor they never come back
IM ON THE TOILET THOUGH!!!!!
Hey You used the tardis sound for the attic opening! Great job

2:08 there is a short distance, he could've just jump, there was no need for climbing
For them it not hot if lava is hot and no windows open?
I'ma be honest the ending ruined it. If it cut to a movie title instead that would've been perfect
XD the last part was so funny
The first thing you do when the floor is lava is you ask for your phone
Can someone explain how he floated on Brent
This is better than netflix movies... 👌
This video was amazing and funny! As a kid I played lava with my twin and best friend during sleepovers. Great cuts and fx.  Good looks yall.

They took out the headphone jack and now they took out the home button
It still doesn't address listening to music and charging at the same time problem and I wouldn't want apple to have a scan of my face, first finger prints now scans of your face this is taking the piss and going to far
Haha he still said it unlocked when it didnt
The first smartphone, IBM Simon Personal Communicator, came out in 1994. A wild touchable screen, no keypad, and multiple capabilities in one are the unique selling point of Simon. However, most of the people get the concept of smartphone was when the first iPhone came out. Due to its slogan “Apple reinvents the phone”, the first generation iPhone is a revolutionary device, people can listen music, play video games, browsing internet with it. Everything with a simple touch is what iPhone can bring people, and iPhone is just an example of the smartphone. People are getting more comfort through this new technology, because now instead of walk to a desktop and do all those complicated steps, they can just type the small screen, then they just send an email through their smartphone. People can use their smartphone to control the temperature of the room, or put some camera in their house, and by connecting to their smartphone, now they can see through their smartphone if any stranger went in their house while they are out for working or playing. \nThrough all those advantages and comfort that from the first generation to the latest smartphone, there are also are disadvantages, and the biggest disadvantage is the smartphone actually cannot compete itself to those specific functional device, such as the graphic of smartphone’s videogame is just not as good as the graphic of X-box or PlayStation and the most famous videogame will only appear on them or a PC, Most of the smartphone’s GPU is also part of its CPU such as Apple’s A10 chip, the concept of its GPU is like the integrated graphics card on PC which is just not a competition to the dedicated graphics card which is the most gamer are using. Due to its lower quality graphics card, most of its games selling point is not the graphic part, but it is the virtual items, which is the more money you put in this game, the more powerful you going to be in the game which just separate its original purpose as a game.   \nThe quality of the camera on smartphones is also not as good as those single-lens reflex cameras. Most of the smartphones’ camera have average 10 megapixels, but a SLR camera have a at least 15 megapixels, and some of them can do more than 100 megapixels, also the SLR camera can add extended lenses which are capable to do more things than a smartphone’s camera, moreover a professional photographer will not use a smartphone to capture an important moment, and also those world famous photographer just prefers a camera, a real camera, for their profession. \nIn school, a calculator (no matter it capable to graph or not) is a necessary tool to use, and the teacher probably would not want to see the student pulls a smartphone out in the class no matter the student is trying to calculate with the smartphone or doing something else, neither the parents wants to see their kids have a smartphone out while they are doing their homework. The problem in this is no matter if they are using as a calculator or as something else, people will still affect by their subconscious such as when you pull out your smartphone during a test, then the teach will think you are looking answer on the internet. Another simple example is smartphone must be turned off during the test (ACT, SAT, GED, etc.), a smartphone without power is less value than a brick. So the issues are not only just technological, there is also the society problem which is the smartphone cannot bring people trust due to its multiple in one features which is you can do something else besides use it to calculate numbers which it can also reflect the trust issue between human. If people trust each other, then smartphone would be totally okay to use on those biggest exams in the world, but essentially not.\nSmartphones can make people’s life easier, and it also let us live in a comfort life, but is this the comfort that people want, does the people approves this “unfinished device” which it does everything, but not the best of everything. People may say that the technology is just not there yet, just compare the different between the first generation smartphone and the latest smartphone, it is getting better. The problem is those bigger devices are also getting better or evolving, this could be a loop which is the smartphone is always one step behind. People may start thinking smartphone is just small mobile device, you cannot compare them, size matters. Either those two professional gaming device or a PC is way bigger than a pocket size iPhone, but if the purpose is to making people live more comfort, than why it is not the best? Does not the best give people the most comfort? Is this smartphone really the result of people trying to live in a comfort life, or it is the result of the laziness of people because it simplifies all those functions, and we all know that the simple version is not as good as the full version.
It's better than I thought it would be
So pretty much if my bf is sleeping
iPhone just can't keep up with Galaxy
jus wait the iPhone come up saying sorry we missed counted it Iphone 9 not X
welcome to the year 2015 the galaxy s6 has the same specs
Still no regular ear phone input 0:37
We are witnessing the last phone apple will ever release, $1000 starting for a phone? Only a tard would spend that.
Iphone copied Amazon fire phone on the slide up features and cameras. And also copied Samsung on Camera features. Iphone is still behind.
At 1:37 * looks at phone with eyes closed so it doesnt unlock *\n1:40 * eyes still closed and it unlocks * - magic!!
*Glass Back:* gonna break in less than a week\n\n*No Home Button:* so im supposed to remember all the swiping motions like\n\n*Dual Camera with Modes:* but what if I want to take...like...a normal picture\n\n*Face Unlock:* some random garlic bread looking dude bout to steal it, put it all up in my face and look at all my stuff no thanks\n\n*Apple Pay:* that same garlic bread looking man gonna max my card too\n\n*Price:* i could go to cracker barrel and get fat off the whole menu for less than this\n\nno earbud jack\n\nearbuds probably gonna be starting at $150\n\nis there even a charger jack\n\ntf paying another $300 just to get some juice in my own phone\n\npass
i HATE the design on the top of the phone. Stupid! Buying a LG V30 instead!
I don't care what anybody says I'm not spending $1000 on a phone that doesn't even have a headphone jack.
iPhone 7: no earphones\niPhone X: no home button,\nyeah, we can all agree that the next apple phone product is gonna be super complicated.
The first thing I thought was why does apple keep making new iPhones? Now I have to get another one?
I like it, but if I had one, I would be nervous about cracking the screen.
I'm sorry to say but I don't like it because why would you take off the fingerprint ID and get rid of the home button and the black like the home buttona And I really liked the fingerprint ID because it was really easy to get on your phone and the new Sangsung 9 still has the fingerprint ID so please think about it I'm very sorry but have a nice day.
Hasn't samsung been had face unlock? This just looks like an samsung s8
Jesus already we've got the iPhone 10
All I know is I'm switching to Samsung
He could have said 1 Terabyte instead of 1,000 Gigabytes
More like IPhone XD get it because of XD.......... it’s a bad joke
Nonsense
1000 dollars is this dude serious?
Illuminati mind control.
Announced on my bday
1:39 ..
does it band doe
So now when you get arrested, cops can now unlock your phone by pointing it at your face while you are in handcuffs, thanks Apple.
Let's take it one step further! I want to 3D scan objects with the face ID camera system and print a copy on my 3D printer!
who's spending 1000 dollars on a new phone? I've been waiting 2 years to upgrade to a new phone and right now if I wanted to I would just have to spend 5 dollars a month for a brand new 7 so it probably won't be that much for the X
I can buy a gaming pc instead of this
Inside the classroom\nApple : i forgot to do my homework \nCan i borrow yours?\nSamsung: ok here it is but dont copy everything so our teacher wont notice its obvious!\nApple : iphoneX
Try this one Friend you will really love it  a theme which will feel like you using iphone x,\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tz.iphone8.x.iphonex.iphone7.iphoneX.edition.iphoneXTheme.s8plus.launcher.theme
inb4 scrolling through fb and going to home
How would you unlock it in the dark?
The iPhone X no headphone jack no home button iPhone X the future is now
One question? \n\n\n\n\nDoes it have a headphone jack
Its just a phone, why is it expensive?
Why are recent iPhone designs look like Samsung Galaxy phones?
I have an I phone 7 I want this one now
You guys will never give an honest review on the iPhone x so not to lose your early access of Apple devices.
Purchasing the X or even the 8 for that matter is telling Apple that it is OK to continue to outsource labor and push over priced electronics on consumers. Apple continues to manufacture their products overseas, which should reduce the cost of their products yet the prices are higher than ever. Their methodical slow release of tech ensures that consumers continue to purchase devices, expend our our natural resources, pollute our environment sending phones to the landfill sooner than necessary. When did we become such a wasteful society? Ask yourself if you want to continue supporting a pretentious brand who is bent on emptying your pockets while destroying the environment. There is a lot to be said about Apple and not sure much of it is good.
If it didnt have that camera in the front that COMPLETELY messes up the straight line, i would Love It. Why didnt they just make it a straight line so i could be calm?
Why would you buy this apple crap get Samsung galaxy s8+ its way  better
It's kool if u want to show u got cash 💰🔥 to burn but besides that I. Good
I've never been interested in an iPhone until now
Expensive. Just wait couple month.. lenovo will make it
I'm gonna point it at this gentleman's face, because that's his face. That's the best
What about sunglasses? Can't get in your phone then?
The X stands for Xpensive
I'll laugh at anyone I see have this phone. Suck a waste of money, and it's fricken over $1000! rip off.
How hard was it to keep a on screen home button?
Good job Patel and thanks so much for showing the size comparison between iPhone 10 and 7 plus. Now I've decided to buy iPhone 10. Thought iPhone 10 will be bigger phone than iPhone plus. No one showed the size comparison except Verge. \nThanks again.
For Sale:\n•My Brain and My Heart\n\n-all working\n-no issue\n-heart never used ( but no one want to use 😔)\n-brain super high specs\n-all is clean\n\nReason for Selling:\n\nI want to buy this iPhone X\n\n•No Credit Card\n•Cash Only\n•respect pls.
its gonna be a super screw up , because people are going to accidentally touch the bottom of the screen with fingers and palm !
They should just make a Straight, black line at the top.. instead of having it cave in at the sides, wich is very distracting
And I'm still to this day use an iPhone 5s.....
7k dislikes is a lot of envious people.
People will still buy the phone no matter what

The McMahons still taking shots at He who shall not be named while he's doing his own thing. So who's the bitter one here?\n\nStill Vince is one crazy man to take that bump
Vince can still be the most entertaining star of the entire night! A TRUE LEGEND!!!!
next week SD live Kevin Owen bleeding Shane McMahon attack
HELL IN A CELL SHANE WILL GET REVENGE
btw the blood was fake it was a little circle
This ruthless KO is what he should have been during his Universal Title reign.
Keywords A MCMAHON. Which means, he will screw himself if he touches another MCMAHON.
Dude Kevin Owens more like Kevin Steen again...I love it!
Vince is a madman.
get well soon
This is scripted lol to lil Kevin Owen fans
KO. Best heel ever.
Prediction: Owens wins, continues to provoke Shane and the McMahon's after it, leading to a Triple H return. From Nov-Dec, Triple H wages a war against him with the return of the Authority on his side while Owens fights back with some support, maybe Rusev. The 2 month buildup is high which finally leads to a clash at the Royal Rumble, HHH vs Owens. Owens wins and Triple H retires. At Wrestlemania 34, they have a quick montage of HHH and Undertaker clashing, showing 2 greats that won't be here but will always be missed. Both of them has participated in more than 20 Wrestlemanias.
You'reeeeee FFFFFIRRRREDDDDDDDD.... !
shots fired here at cm punk's lawsuit against WWE. And McMahon jobbed to Ventura and Warrior in lawsuits before.
Woah Kevin got sued
Epic KO
Did he blade or did he actually let that headbutt happen ?
Roman Reigns would never agree to take a head butt like that
Respect to the guy for taking bumps but the cut was made before he came to the ring for those who believe the headbutt caused the bleeding without new skin. When Kevin says the words 'beat a McMahon senseless' you can see the area where vince will bleed from in the light before the strike. The headbutt was just enough to remove the new skin. Clever showmanship, gotta love and respect it. Wwe isn't what it was but every now and then a hint of the better days comes along.
Kevin Owens is lame this wasn't even exciting
Boring. Originally Punk started all of this.
Vince should give classes to his roster on how to sell someone else's  moves.  At 72 he still knows how it get done in the ring.
Is Owens the new Stone Cold? Owens vs McMahon's would be quite entertaining
I know Grandpa Vince is old, but we can have him at one more PPV like Mania?
classic like stone cold and Mr. McMahon. cool \n🎩\n😁\n👕👍Great!\n👖
Great Balls of fire
I don't know what Steph was wearing but I like it.\nIt's got a Rollins feel to it but then again wasn't it he whom slayed the king aka her husband.perhaps the queen likes the slayer.\nHmmmmmmm questions questions
KO looks like one of the best of the world when he is not working as an personal Universal Champion jobber of Roman Reigns, 
Shane McMahon will easily win that hell in cell match
Yeah, Vince might have gotten beat up, but let's just take a minute to acknowledge the fact that he was roasting KO hard af up until that point lol
RESPECT MAH AUTHORITAH
It's time to start cussing, attacking refs for fun and showing even more blood to start a Ruthless Aggression Era II!
Meek ma han is the epitome of a savage
Owens , you took the hard way instead of the easy way ! Thumbs up if you know what i mean
The blood was definitely a shoot the head bump was legit
Where was triple h though and I think Stephanie told Kevin Owens he fired. From the way her mouth was moving.
Those of you who are hoping for Kevin Owens to get fired should be prepared for your hopes to be dashed. Remember, back in 2009 Randy Orton did the same thing and he wasn't fired so neither will Owens be. Obviously, this is setting up a feud between him and the McMahons while further pushing him as a major heel.
Great Segment! I see a future of Triple H and KO at Wrestlemania. After he cruises through Shane O Mac
I have a feeling that Kevin actually headbutted him. Just look at his face, he is SCARED! He was not ment to make him bleed.
I thought triple H was gonna come and beat him up
Pushing Owens is Vince's way of saying 'I'm sorry' to canadians for the Screwjob 20 years ago.
Is it just me or is Kevin Owens Awesome. Everything he does i see passion for the industry
Glad they didn't put a grey screen to cesaor the blood
Vince vs Owens back to the old stone cold Steve Austin days
If you want to watch a wrestler snap properly, youtube old Ken Shamrock matches.
I swear kevin owens is like a little pre k girl who got her pencil stolen during school
Got my tickets for this Pay Per View to watch Shane beat the holy hell out of Owens
Fact# HHH hasn't been in a smackdown ppv more than 10years.
Something told me that Kevin Owens was going to be fired I also fell that Triple HHH would have a match at Wrestle mania 34
Listening to Kevin Owens speak is crigeworthy. It reminds me of the South Park WWE Episode. So corny and takes out any realism
That was totally uncalled for Kevin should have never attacked Mr McMahon
I don't care if Kevin Owens sucks he's a good wrestler
whos the guy in the suit woth blue shirt
WOW I hope that Stephanie tells her husband triple h and he comes next week to smack down and beat down kevin owens for what he did to vince mcmahon
what did Stephanie say to Kevin?
his forehead must be made of iron bro
Vince Out of Touch
Guys they didn't black out the blood.. Bye bye pg era
i haven't seen mr mcmahon in centuries. this man doesn't age. i wonder if he still has that stupid walk.\n\nomg he's bleeding! now that's the wwe I know!!!!!
Vince is a legend
2:02 billionaire, I guess we need President Trump to deal with Mr. McMahon again, just like he embarrassed him ten years ago. if Vince tries to lay a hand on Donald, he'll answer to secret service this time, and go to prison.
man vince is old.
it would've been awesome if HHH came out to save Vince
well vince did loss a lawsuit otherwise wwf wouldnt change to wwe
shane where u at
Good stuff! Like the ole days.
mad respect for vince taking a bump like that vince obviously sees talent in kevin
Screw Kevin Owens, just fire the mother******
dont let this video distract you from the fact that John Cena did a blade job for Vince McMahon after the headbutt by Kevin Owens
KO can only bit people like Vince at 72
what is stephanie doing at smackdown
They must have some big plans for Owens.
Imma kill ko Even though it's scripted
The real BEAST in the WWE.
No hidden blade in Vince's hands. Real deal triple O.G...
OHHHH SO SATYSFYING !!
He heard those cm punk chants 😂😂
i dislike Keven owens
Payback for Fastlane
funy boy..
U suck
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
hahaha
TRUMP 2020!
Scripted bt interesting

Kevin Owens u are scum
ALL PHONEY
coper141
Katsuyori Shibata vs Mr. McMahon\nFirst Blood Headbutt match\nBOOK IT VINCE
Owens v HHH at Mania book it
Daneil bryan vs kevin owens
Kevin Owens your fired
Kevin owens doesnt have the look, looks like a typical average fat dude
We either give Kevin Owens the match or fire him.
Who the hell is that bald guy he was there last week to who is he
Who would pay hard earned money to see this FAT NO TALENT UNINTERESTING SLOB wrestle? NOT ME!
God this is embarrassing Kevin Owens maybe be a good wrestler however has no star quality.  And if the wwe seems to make these jobbers top spots. It is another clue wrestling is dying
Jim Carrey is right. And these bozos are pawns of the system.
this answer interview is older than the bizarre interview
Who are these boobs? Mr. Carey has reached a higher state of consciousness and they are speaking as if he's lost his mind.
These media people are to into there jobs that they are tools of the trade
Its so irritating to watch these interviewers react with sarcasm about the first real conversations I've heard in interviews in the last decade. The only topics for discussion nowadays are Kardashians ass implants and Trumps wig. Don't talk about consciousness! Don't talk about growth!... Just ass and wigs.
No he's basically saying that you stupid little jobs, that's have you pressing on about  fame and all things hollow are totally irrelevant in the garden scale of things. Wankers.
Jim is sooo woke. EGO IS EVIL. These people are twats
this stupid reporters should show some respect for a man who is that big !!!
Flatlanders from the Truman Show commenting with fuck me accents. Lovely!
Woke beyond woke. I love him. Fuck these puppets....
This is so fucked that he just gets passed off like that. I hope this generation sees it for what it is
Just let Jim 🐝 he happens to be 💯 percent correct
he's lying. he's trying to hide the signs...chester bennington tried too and look what happened.
Wow media again trying to control how we feel and think...
What he said makes perfect sense to me.
There people are trying to make him look insane when he's actually more sane and aware than any of them.
he really is God
Best movies of all time: truman show and eternal sunshine
A bunch of ignorant self-centered reporters with small minded perspectives which is the problem and what Carrey is getting at. They only help him by appearing so ignorant but you have to feel sorry for them.
Yeah I mean, the concept is 'Anatta'. It can be a useful concept but...It's strong medicine that my sense is you kind of have to build up to...
Love him. Calling out the stupidity of it all.
Everybody knows that you can lose a some of your self identity if you have been an actor as long as Jim Carry has. The price for fame. Jim is a pretty interesting personality.
Imagine the money in apocalyptic world
U don't need a red pill to stop being third eye blind. Just a fierce desire to think for yourself & not what u r told! 👌🏼🤔
Carrey was on point...media playing their subversion carelessly.
this is so disgusting how these people are being. obviously he's dealing with depression and identity crisis and WHO WOULDN'T when you became a celebrity at the time he did, when celebrities had to be perfect and be the character they portrayed all the time. but most of all, let's remember the fact that this lady's first words to him are asking about needing a date after his girlfriend just committed suicide. i dont think all these icons would seem like they mattered much to you either if your girlfriend just killed herself and you're dealing with severe depression. it's disgusting. leave him alone.
Fuck the media and the news
Jim is next to die them Juden will kill him like everybody else that opens up on them
It annoys me how just because there talking about a comedian there demeanor is like everything is funny. That must be so frustrating to assume the role as comedian and never be take seriously.
He figured out that the earth is flat, and he is inside a enclosed dome like, structure, similar to the truman show. I'M SERIOUS!
He simply managed to walk out of the matrix we are living in. Meditation and ask your self what really matters. Don't try to fins answers on the internet, just ask your self true questions and you will begin to understand Jim.
Dissappointing these anchors are making fun of a man who is AWARE of his conscious subconscious mind and self. To a person that cannot grasp that differentiation....he would appear odd. Good for Jim Carey. He is beginning to see that he doesnt have to be a label. That he is much more than that. \n\n-Lorelei
It's the whole point to make woke and clever people look mental incase they cause others to wake
Jim Carrey is so over their heads it's too funny yet hey Jim if you can't stand the social programming matrix construct you are awakened to~~~~ why fucking bother showing up to such an event? \n1. Jim gets paid big bucks to do it hence yes he is aware but shows up to social media events to play the new age looney tune to many (HENCE CORPORATE MEDIA TALKS ABOUT) AND THE FEW IN THE KNOW OF THE CHESS GAME MATRIX LAUGH THEIR ASS OFF YET GAINS FEW TO DELVE DEEPER IN WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY SAYING.\n2. Jim Carrey Actually tries within his field to wake others up & uses Corporate Media in Earnest! HMMM......?\n3. Take Jim Carrey with a Grain of Salt in Holly Weird~ IF HE TRULY HAS DISCERNMENT WANTING TO PIERCE THE MATRIX VEIL HE WOULD HAVE LEFT HOLLY WEIRD ALONG TIME AGO~ HENCE A PUPPET PROPAGANDA SIDE SHOW TO DISCREDIT THOSE WHO ARE IN THE KNOW OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMMING! HE LIKES HIS $$$$ LIFE STYLE TOO MUCH TO GIVE UP TO BE A COMMON HUMAN BEING W/ GRACE & DISCERNING VULNERABILITY....OF SELF LOVE.....BEYOND THE MATRIX..... \n4. FOR ALL WE KNOW HE IS JUST A WEBOT PROGRAM FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT TO DECEIVE AND LAUGH AT THE DECEPTION....
Once in awhile you'll get these actors who all the sudden become very deep and think they've found the meaning of everyone's life blah blah blah and they sound schizo at first but they're just trying to sound way too spiritual lol
Jim isn't talking nonsense. The idea is that the self is an illusion. We cling to a false sense of identity based on where we were born, who we're told we're supposed to be and how we're supposed to behave. I believe he has studied the principles of Non Duality, which if anyone is interested in, look up Jeff Foster and Eckhart Tolle, who give wonderful explanations on the subject. Of course, taken out of context, it sounds like he's going insane, but if you actually pay attention to what he's saying, it all makes sense.
do these people know what he does for a living? why are people so surprise at his remarks.
Fucked up reporters are stupid and shallow as de pit beneath their feet
Reporters were too stupid to comment on his what Jim said....
Making fun of something you all can not understand doesn't make you  look good. Just a bit of advice.
They don't get it at all - but have their close ones die, have them lose their jobs, have them spend some time alone and they will soon realise their entire 'identity' was built upon a façade that they never knew existed until they were put in that position, because they have never had to 'look inside' themselves for anything. This is why unemployed people become depressed, this is why when wives cheat on husbands the husbands go off the rail. This is why people who get bullied kill themselves. And this is what is meant by putting 'God first' Not your mum, your dad, your boss, your job, your wife or husband, or purpose - Those things are not a reliable anchor point for anyone and when we attatch our identities to them and they no longer serve us we have nothing to cling on to. Jim is a great example of putting 'god' first - He isn't falling for the trap that he is an idol - like the people treat him as and he has even said once people get all that external stuff they will realise that it does not make you happy. I've been there, Im sure a lot of others have as well and its a weired place to be in especially when you have to deal with idiot people like these reporters who will never understand you
All I see is Jim Carrey calling out bullshit on Hollywood and a bunch of dumb ass reporters not being able to accept that they might be part of the meaninglessness \n#Carreyforpresident
Fashion is an industry and a culture of its own. To dismiss it as trivial is as ludicrous as dismissing comedy or acting or television. A lot of fan boys in the comments, but it's clear to see that Carey is losing the plot. Hopefully he is getting some help.
GO FOR iT JiM!!!❤ you ve got it!
I got every single word he said on this latest explanation.. On the otherside got really scared with the first interview I saw.. More relaxed now, he is not nuts..
there Is much more people supporting you jim 💪💪
It's obvious that Jim is searching for something. The arrogance of these reporters is sickening. So condescending as if they have all the answers. Like they have life all figured out.
I think Jim Carrey is seeing the world like Neo does at the end of the Matrix. He's a fucking genius
Everyones comments are sooo refreshing!!! Stopped watching tv a long time ago because it's filled with this BS! Its good to see humankind standing up for truth and a saner reality 👍👍👍
Jim's in crisis because his wife died... Obviously he's going to act out. It doesn't mean he's suddenly woke or some nonsense, it means he's fucking grieving, you twats... He doesn't have the drive to make people laugh or to vent his emotions since he isn't acting or in movies anymore (previously, those were his vices). He's depressed and he's going through the stages of grief (denial [done], anger [done], bargaining [done], depression [in progress] and acceptance [he will get there soon)... So everybody stop taking everything he says so seriously (or literally). He's not on some higher level of consciousness or whatever the fuck you hippies want to call it, he's fucking depressed. That's why he's trying to destroy his image, that's why he didn't give a fuck during the fashion week interview, or any other fucking interview since she died. Leave him alone and stop promoting this self destructive behaviour, it's not helping him, he just needs time.
Why so serious? He's a comedian ffs.
Right on. We are all one energy, expressed as consciousness.But all they cared about was how he looked.
Jim Carrey is a fucking genius, he is truly enlightened. those reported were the fattest nitwits i have ever seen. They totally missed his message it went straight over their heads like they were children.
These Orange fashion people are like... wat R spirit? is it in? is it sexy? FUCK YOU1!?12 KL3EFKLW QHAFASDJKLHFVOIASDHFKL;ASDHFA
Lol at the fact that idiots see a drug fueled narcissist spout half-baked pseduo-intellectual shite and they call it genius and WOKE.
Look at this asshole talking questioning society and existence! Thinks he's too good for the twelth award show this week does he?! I bet he doesn't even know the current top ten lists of celebrity gossip!
These guys didn't get it.
Lol, feeble minded media. We don't understand what he's saying so we'll just ridicule and belittle it
Jim Carrey gets it. These reporters are idiots.
He's trying to describe the Zen worldview, which, admittedly, is difficult. 'Zen is not words'.
Why in the fuck does anyone even watch these TV shows anymore? Who gives a fuck what they think or have to say?????
I don't think they're so wrong. Jim sounds like he just had his first acid trip. In all that infinite wisdom you'd think there'd be something about not fucking up tv shows. Whoa, let's blow some minds at fashion week! edgy stuff jim.
'Was he Truman show?' Lol what a retard
I understand exactly what he's saying....
I want this god of a man to give me anal
he doesn't exist without a role to play\n\nyou took his message of there is no self, only consciousness, individuality is a misconception and we are all actors on the stage of life and turned it into poor guy will go crazy if he doesn't get some work soon.
You idiot reporters will always try to suppress a higher form of consciousness. Guess what dicks, the gig is up! Stick that in your pipe and smoke it!
That shit went right over there head lmfao no body really ever looks at the big picture only the small portion there subjected to
And what was weird about that... I'm being serious, sounded pretty norm to me.
When people can't understand something they mock it. Jim's a genius, you can't expect these people to get where he's coming from, they still have their blinders on 🙈
His interview at Fashion Week plus his response illustrates he's been doing some seriously deep, introspective thinking.  I'd love a book list of what he's been reading.
He has hillbilly bipolar skistifenia he is sick in his mind from this disease
Respect, understanding and knowledge. well said.
He knows more than these shitty, non-introspective, fuck-all news heads talking about things they know nothing about. I feel bad for them and how fast that went over their heads.
I am on board with Jim Carry on this one. But wtf is going on with Jim Carry why the fuck is he all weird and trying to be a prophet lately? Stop being fucking weird Jim Carry. And I don't mean the funny weird. You're just weird now.
the only reporter of the bunch who actually was thinking about what he said was the Blonde girl... The other two dipshits can keep drinking the kool-aid. STAY WOKE FAM!
how is it possible for these reporters to be this stupid
Mass media employees are literally dumber than a box of rocks. Admit that you make a cushy living by manipulating and exploiting tax payers, and change your fucking tune.\n\nEducate yourself. Become articulate -- able to think, form arguments, act and lead. Transcend your ignorance and victimhood. Reduce the suffering in the world. Lead a heroic life.
Of course these clowns will not take this seriously and laugh it off.
Even Will Ferrell's Anchorman would analize this in a better, more professional and deeper view. These people is why tv is finally going to an end. We're done with this s***
When ur having a mid life crsis so u accidentally fall into and promote a predatory bastardisation of 'new age' ideas that preys on the mentally ill and otherwise vulnerable through con men like David Wolfe.\n\nOh well done, Jim... most people go through this phase aged 14 or so...
Jim Carrey is Black Pilled af. The man is living on a whole other plane of existence. Many of us cannot simply comprehend what he is thinking, what he feels, and how he sees the world, and frankly I think there's a sublime beauty to that.
I wanna see the whole interview. He probably went on about more truth you dumb mfs don't wanna realize. I was honestly surprised he dropped it so bluntly like that. people aren't ready for it like that. I appreciate him for this though, it makes me happy af to know he's waking people up.
I really want to give that fat prick a smack.
Jim Carrey is crazy
He has gone insane.
Enlightened.
HE'S WOKE
God Loves you Jim Carrey.
Wise fucker
normies
Lol more thumbs down
Yo fuck these shit shallow reporters!
GIga niggers
consciousness an shapes
RETARDS.. FUCKING RETARDS EVERYWHERE
They mock him instead of trying to understand his view. Fucking retards.
Pray this man gets saved, what a sad thing.
He's a nihilist so who cares. You didn't have to talk to him.
I don't know why so many people support this idea of his. Anything above procreation is essentially pointless. But these things exist to bring joy and happiness to those that enjoy them, much like movies, music, good food, video games etc... \n\nAnyone who claims a higher understanding and that these things are beneath them is lost in the sauce imo.
YOUR BACKGROUND IS EVERYTHING!!😩🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Liking the new outlook of the recent videos!! Go ahead!:-)
I was looking at your top wondering how it looked so much like the one I picked up at H&M and then you mentioned you got it from there! I was so excited that we had picked the same thing!

Sam I love your style!🙌🏼
Sammy,  if you're not sure about the Addidas joggers then check out these trousers from Pull & Bear. It's got Addidas kinda vibe, but really smart and casual at the same time. It's only £19.99, I have been wearing it legit every day since I got them. Loved it so much that I bought it in diff colors. Here's the link https://www.pullandbear.com/gb/woman/clothing/trousers/tailored-jogging-trousers-with-side-stripe-c29021p500356645.html#800
Keep the Adidas ones and return the & Other Stories pair. I really wish you would've shown the chain on your bag. Maybe include that in another video or an Instagram post if possible. Always love your styling videos.
I agree on Realisation Par.  That site is like crack in dress form.
keep the adidas pants! and YES to an autumn trend video! also- love when you show us your shopping process- what you pick up, try on, say no to, etc!
Love to new filming space 😍
I really want that dungaree dress but I can't find it :(
I would love to see a autumn/winter how to video! you're so inspiring and I feel like I can relate with your style!
your style keeps getting better and better!! Loved the skirt dungarees!
Love these new pieces! Can't wait to see a 'how to wear' video :) \nYour videos always brighten my day - do keep them up! x
I desperately need the A/W trends video, haha ♥
Also agree with people complaining about the wrinkled shirt...yikes....

I like the add addidas ones so much on you! I think take the other ones back! X
your style is absolutely stunning. You're totally top three of my favourite bloggers when It comes to style. I love you so much
Love your style sam !! \nMay I ask where the white chunky heels are from please ?!
Canne believe this shite trends  nowadays when back in the day a dog humping a fat burd was the video to be seen......how the bar has fallen
Some of my favorite videos from you Sammy ❤️
Lol why was this recommended?
You say 'Adidas' so differently lol. Here in Canada, we say A-Dee-Das
I cannot wait for your winter vlogs in London. Specially Christmas /festive season! Yass
Anyone know where she got her leggings?
I probably wouldn't keep the adidas trousers since you already got the other ones!!
What size did you get the adidas joggers in? I'm usually the same as you but everyones saying they come up small ahhh
I adore hearing you talk about clothing, it's so soothing in a way
Keep the Adidas! You have a great taste when it comes to fashion /styling <3 Kisses from Greece!
Love your Videos and also your Vlogs!!! ❤️❤️❤️ and Yes yes yes autumn/winter trends how to style \nGreetings from Germany 🙂
I've been looking for nice vinyl pants like yours but I couldn't finde any I liked... could you tell me you you got yours from?\n\nBtw love the contrast and the adidas look ;)
Why does Youtube promote your channel so heavily?
Keep Adidas pants! They both are cute💅🏾
Autumn/winter fashion is definitely my favorite too! The colors and layers loooove it so much :) Loove your fashion sense I always get a lot of inspiration from it xx
i've not seen dungarees lately at all
Can you do a haul of clothes cheaper but still a good style like yours like classy vintage?
Omg keep the adidas bottoms!! That outfit is 💣 xxx
keep the adidas! suits you way better!
also, this is one of my fav hauls you've done! and i've been watching since the  very beginning :)
where are your black leggins from :O they look awesome on you!
Thanks for the video Sam. I liked everything you picked. The only piece that I thought was a bit iffy. It's the red polka dot dress. I would be very incomplete wearing it with that very high wrap in front looks like you could have a wardrobe malfunction at any second. I would even be uncomfortable if I saw someone else wearing it bc you just know her pants will get flashed. I especially loved the jumpsuit and the stripped trousers. 🙂
Sometimes in your hauls you pull a clothing piece out and I'm thinking, idk about that item. But then you show a snippet of the item styled and I'm like, ok, yeah that looks awesome. And it always looks so good on you. You are really good at styling. And you make me want to buy pieces I would never buy. Haha. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, I really love your styling videos and your hauls so keep 'em comin'.
That red polka dot dress is stunning😍😍😍😍
Love you gorgeous girl! ❤️ Your sense of style is spot on!
I can't even tell you how much I love you with curly hair!!!!! It looks so great on you, and that Realization Par dupe is so spot on 👀
YAAS, do that trends-video please!😍 can you do more lookbooks as well? I miss them🙂
I love the black denim skirt. Looks SUPERB on you. I also LOVE the blouse you are wearing. It's crazy to me how much H&M have stepped up their game as of late. Just a year ago there was NOTHING I wanted to buy from them. 
I really like the Adidas bottoms over the AOS stories ones, however you'll prob get more wear out of those ones as the joggers look beat with heels.. & who wears heels that often (not this mama anyway lol)
I love how you make trends completely 'yours'. Everything looks completely different on you, in the best way possible. I love and admire that! :)xX
I love your fashion videos so much aand how u always share your honest thoughts on pieces. Please make more autumn/winter videos. I moved from Greece to Sweden and i'm really not used to dressing for this weather, so some advice on how not to look like a potato bag would be much appreciated! Looking great as always Sammi xX
keep the adidas! It looks great on you
Where is ur black leather jacket from which u tried on with those adidas track pants?!? I luv it soo much!! I luv ur style ur stunning:) xxxx
Sam I'm more of a midi skirts and dresses kinda wearer, if that's a word 😂 and I'm wondering you could do a video of how to style skirts and dresses. I know it's not a common thing, especially living in LA, but it's very hard to find a flattering way to style them. Please consider 😁
Hi Sam <3 i totally imagine you wearing that red boohoo dress with some tights and some thigh highs just in case it got colder.
I love your style! Now I want to go shopping :)
Kinda random but I love your arm chair in your try on shots. WHere is it from????
Yes please give us autumn 🍂 winter ❄️ trends.
the adidas pants looked amazing on you! Kinda liked them more than the other! :)
Always giving out the best haul ever
Literally liked this video 5 seconds in because I know your vids are always fabuloussssss! LOOL xxx
I love it when you have curly hair! I also love it when you have curly hair with some curly bangs! so pretty <3
Why don't you keep the adidas pants to wear casually like when youre going to run errands or walking your dog or something...i always thought those adidas pants were for days when you want to be casual but cool.
I'm not one for trends but I love athleisure. I've been obsessed with an entire Nike, Adidas, etc. outfit with trainers. I feel stylish but super comfy at the same time.
Keep dem Adidas pants...and the &OtherStories ones
Loving the background aesthetic in this video Sammi! Both the main shot and the cutaways xx
Sammi, for me You are IT GIRL
adidas pants is a keeper
You're soooo beautiful ❤
Those &otherstories contrast pants are gorgeous!
Keep the Adidas trousers!!!!!!

sammi loves polka dots since forever. so classic
Didn't Vox do kind of a similar video about the Mona Lisa, and how it only really became famous after it was stolen? Or am I thinking of another channel?
So, first of all, the premise that To Kill a Mockingbird is 600% better than other books not taught is ridiculous. The number of classes that teach this book doesn't measure its greatness, it measures the consensus of its relevance. It not only did the book tackle the problems of racism and prejudice and the need to stand up against it even in the odds are against you. It foretold the turmoil of the mid to late 1960's when the boomers stood up against war and racism... this made it relevant to its time and most school English classes still consider it more relevant than Oliver Twist.\nSecond, I read The Old Man and the Sea and Invisible Man in high school. My sisters read Little Women. My daughter read Pride and Prejudice. Strangely enough, I did not read To Kill a Mockingbird in school. Does that mean, from my perspective, it is underrated? Additionally, we have all read The Diary of Anne Frank. Would you also say that is overrated?\nThird, your argument that the paperback was responsible for its Pulitzer Prize and endurance does not explain why Naked Came the Stranger has not endured. It doesn't explain why the current generation has (thankfully) never heard of Jacqueline Susann, Harold Robbins and Alistair MacLean.
I tried to read it but... It was boring for the first, like, 20 pages, and that couldn't be a good signal.
What if I told you that vox is overrated?
This video is a perfect example why vox is Idiotic
do gone with the wind next
Harper Lee died when I was in the 9th grade, my class was in the middle of reading TKMB. We got the news, while we were reading it...
It's really overrated. I thought it was bleh.
They only literary acceptable novels that I read was The Kite Runner, Their Eyes Were Watching God, and The Poisonwood Bible. I enjoyed those.\n\nI tried reading Tale of Two Cities but omg what a boring read, only got through 3 chapters. I burned it after we were done with it in class.
If you did NOT read any of the other books, than this book is not 600% better, but infenitly better...
Uh. So it's overrated because of paperback version? I thought you had something in regards to the story.
I finally understand what was meant by the mockingbird quote. 4:49
This is random but I am a 25 year old male, turning 26 on November 16th.
Where a red fern grows is one of my favourite book in my childhood. I read my copy so many times that the binding disintegrated ...
He speaks as if we are illiterate and ignorant, Caucasian liberals expose their own ignorance.
Idk what schools you went to but my school reads most of the ones you mentioned plus some
I read Night by Ellie Wiesel in 8th
To be fair, though, it really is a damn good book
Im reading that book in class right now
This ideology shows ignorance of history and great literature. It is part of the new brain dead dilettante set. This kind of endless logical fallacy is becoming the norm in an increasingly imbecile population. This kind of twaddle is therefore to be avoided and decried as lies.
Lemon framework educational consideration telescope fiction fine tribe yell.
I love vox
Im reading catcher in a rye right now for the second time but i read it first outide of school
Attributing TKAM's success to only one thing is too simple. Another crucial factor, also related to timing, is that the book became a big hit at just the moment when white liberal America wanted to start telling itself it had overcome racism. TKAM's antiracism message allows white people to put racism into the past, which makes it easier to ignore racism in the present. Why else would schools want kids to read it multiple times, while ignoring so many other great books on the subject -- especially books by people of color -- that would challenge the myth that the civil rights movements finally solved the race problem? Plus the book doesn't challenge white supremacy TOO hard, since the protagonist and hero are both white.
I don't find this overrated, but you know what is overrated, catcher in the rye. Horrible book, it has a good meaning, just the character is seriously horrible.
I think this book was successful because of the political climate it entered. The early 60s were right in the heat of the civil rights movement and a book that villified white supremacists while presenting the idea of nonracist whites (because I'm sure even a lot of  white people who fought for integration had racial bias). White people could say I'm like Atticus, I'm not racist
please talk about star wars!
no el dorado is a statue
this is literally the worst book i've ever read
I LITERALLY HAVE THIS BOOK IN MY BOOK BAG RIGHT NOOOOOOOWWWW
I do not agree with the video, but this has great content and i look forward to the next episode.
I've never heard of this book before watching this video.
Am I the only one who never read To Kill a Mockingbird in school? No? Okay.
The real question is...why the hell are you moving so much.
I think it's an excellent and inspiring book. I agree that it's overrated though yes
And all this time I thought it was a cookbook.
let's spend five minutes saying the worth of one sentence; the majority of Vox video's
Calling some of the world's most beloved art overrated? It's a bold move, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.
It's because it's one of the few entertaining books you read in English class in almost all schools (Not one of the few good books, entertaining.) the other ones I can think of are The Great Gatsby and Lord of the Flies.
What are you saying? Just because To Kill a Mockingbird got lucky at the time of its release, that makes it less brilliant? A book can be brilliant and get lucky with the time of its publishing, too. Its luck doesn't make it any less amazing.
One example of when the movie is better than the book, and what's more the movie is more IMPORTANT and groundbreaking than the book. The movie changed American film more than the book changed American literature.
now let's look at catcher in the rye
The book was terrible
Why is this thrown in my suggestions that I can't rid of? It's popped up three times. All I can is report. I've never watched a Vox video is my life. Why is this here? Why won't it go away?
I don't like it, not because it's overrated or because I was forced, simply because it's not my style.
It's funny how Atticus Finch has become this symbol of great liberal values when the thing he did in the book was accuse a woman about being raped.
I've never read it
I read the book because of the hype. It was good but certainly not the greatest book of all time by any means.
Who else is reading this in English class?
I had to read the Great Gatsby, Lord of the Rings, Great Expectations, Catcher in the Rye, Lolita, Pride and Prejudice, a ton of Shakespeare, the Odyessey, Mythology, along with To Kill a Mockingbird.
im reading this book in school right now
It's my favourite book we studied at school in the UK
To Kill a Mockingbird is liberal media bias and doesn't represent all of us. I'm glad we have Donald Trump as President. He'll fix this!
Wouldnt it be 500% since that means that he read it 6 times more than others. Since 100% better implies twice as good.
I'm waiting for a video on Shakespeare and Lord of the flies.
This is like my masters say this book is good and the other is bad,  so let's find the  reason for it. You never really graduated from college. I bet you think Citizen Kane is the best film of all time...
i actively do not like this book
Now do a video why my music is underrated!
this ad Is so annoying
stating that a literary classic is overrated while also having a video about how deep a white painting is is plain hypocrisy
I was never required to read this in school. Weird
okay this makes a lot of sence and I love lernig stuff from these vox videos but like I still love this book like a lot
Video is stupid as hell.
I read where the red fern grows and if I remember correctly, it was and is still one of the saddest things I've ever read
Vox, Truly enjoyed this video and the way it was laid out. The honesty behind it is refreshing. You're right, heard an interview with Harper Lee years ago where she expressed her surprise at the books popularity & success. \n\nAs content & subject matter this book was a wonderful introduction to the issue of racism and prejudice -- which as you pointed out was very time relevant. I'm sure the publishing era was very important to the books success  --it would be a great first step towards discussing societies biases, perspectives, feelings of racism & history of prejudice. 1961 was relevant to the Civil Rights Movement, to legislation allowing black women to vote, to a media source (TV news)  giving us a view of racism in actions of rioting and beatings on the streets throughout American cities. So, whether this book was written beautifully or not --- it is one of the most relevant sources of stated racism & discrimination of our time.
The reasons for anything's popularity is always subjective. That's nothing new. I think the real reason Vox chose this book because it touches on racial issues. I smell subtle liberal media bias.
So the book is famous because it won a Pulitzer prize and yet the presenter still thinks it's not a great book, yet he cannot explain why it is not a great book.\nThis video really was a damp squib!
To Kill a Mockingbird is overused in schools, yes but it was a really good book because it sucked you into that story and made you feel like you were there experiencing what they had.
My son thinks this book was such a waste of time
Excited for this new series! Ruin it! Oh wait that's Adam. But excited nonetheless.
I'm only really seeing that it was prevalent, not any real appraisal of its quality. You may have overestimated your ability to bring a compelling argument in this video.
EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO SAY I FOUND NOTHING SO AMAZING ABT THIS BOOK
why are you saying the hainman's whip?
Ouch read it once, but The Green Mile is way better.
I wish i complete a novel before I die 😂😂😂😂
I'm a simple man. I see a new Vox video. I like.
I'm really annoyed this won't stop showing in mt feed i'v already seen it.
Now a book series that I find overrated, even though I like it, is the Harry Potter franchise.
I disagree completely. To Kill a Mockingbird is a great book! This is one of three books I was assigned to read in school, enjoyed reading, and read again later because I wanted to (the other two books were Lord of the Flies and Fahrenheit 451). It has a good story, good morals, and isn't too difficult or too obscene for children to read.
I have never read it
all the white kids in my school have read it like 4 times in 2 years
marilyn monroe and john green!!!
1938, 1944, and 1948 penguins look like they that were ran over  o_O
It's a classic because it tells us something about our world. It is more than just a mere piece of fiction - it was published at a time when the civil rights movement was gaining momentum and exposes the prejudices that occurred in America - written through the eyes of a child the non sensical, ridiculous notion of racism is slammed by Harper Lee. That's why it's a classic. Because it's always the books that mean something which last. Look at pride and prejudice, tess of the d'urbervilles, gatsby, great expectations to name but a few. They've all survived the test of time because they actually comment on societies attitudes. That's why I love literature - not because it's a paper back print!
*sigh* I still haven't found the El Dorado...

Dropper cable lose on the bars?

What's the best way to get sponsored or interest from a company?
Steves dam quick how the hell do you manage to speak that blacks sick satchet of carp lol wtf
in all honesty the last sin should be taken off. while it was kinda pointless of david revealing himself at the end, he had to help them kill his xenomorph creation as he wants to make daniels into the same thing he made elizabeth an alien queen by using her reproductive organs to make more facehuggers while the rest of the crew on the ship will be used as hosts of the xenomorph after the facehuggers implants it in them. im also assuming he will do this with all the females on the ship
Cool, Please do Everything Wrong with Wonder Women
Everything wrong with it
Everything wrong with IT. pls😆
Annie 2014 plzzz
In hungarian the word fasz means dick. So whenever you say fassbender it cracks me up everytime
You got anew Sin counter  because the first one broke rlly
Are like you videos nice  Good
I understand the sin of the AI wearing a hood.\n\nI don't understand the logic that leads from 'hood' to 'Eminem' tho.\n\nPerhaps attire varies between our cultures, but it's far from only hiphop folk who wear hoods in my culture. It's generally anybody from middle class downwards who will wear a hood, regardless of individual tastes. Hell, the upper class yoofs probably wear hoods too, just more lowkey than the rest of us. It's difficult to tell because they generally don't mix outside of their own.
Do Everything Wrong With The Thing.
i simply hate all the movies that come out now days, Even the best directors from the 90s fell for the excesive use of cgi it just looks pathetic, Sorry  but the movie sucked sucked sucked,I think thats the purpose now, to make crappy movies to make people react in a bad way and just enjoy the revenue from the bad publcity wich at the end all kind of publicity is good publicity.
What does he mean by dues ex machina?
What is actually your favorite movie?
What counts as a sin? I don't understand what they mean, sometimes they just say information about the film that isn't bad but it counts as a sin? Is there something I'm not getting?
Please do point break remake its horrible and deserves to be sined
Haha besides the cool CGI I still prefer the older Alien movies.
Everything wrong with IT
Do the Doom movie. Its a guilty pleasure.
Everything wrong with IT 
Do IT or i will drag you into the sewers
Everything Wrong With It.
Oh wow... a new Movie Sin Counter. Too bad it'll be broken by Transformers: The Last Knight soon.
My dad always says It's just a movie when ever i complain about the flaws and stupid characters in a film. and i always reply Bullshit, when it comes to alien movies, i have standards. Ridley Scott is destroying this franchise and when people point it out and complain he ignores it and just acts like he's a genius and people don't understand him. Now that i think about it he seems a lot like an angsty emo teenager with and over inflated ego.
Shaw's body is barely decomposed at all, which means David must have killed her only days before the crew of the Covenant arrived. Which also means she lived peacefully with him for years, and was totally fine with him committing genocide and then spending his free time engineering deadly bioweapons
I recommend Focus starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie. 2015
Plz do the bye bye man like if you agree
People call me a xenomorph nerd all you want I don't care but this movie even forgot how xenomorphs REPRODUCE so this is how they multiply :Human must be close to eggy eggy then facehuggy pops out of eggy then facehuggy gets on human face must put embryo in human xenomorph snake pops out and grows to adult in a few hours and then the 2 xenomorphs breed and a eggy pops out DONE
Are you guys gonna do Everything Wrong With IT? The 1990 one and the 2017 one?
Are you guys ever going to do one for Wonder Woman?
David is a robot. His hair can't grow.  Sin\nDavid has no lungs. He can't play a flute. Sin
Do Stephen King's It!! (1990)
The point of the flaps is to keep your ears warm.
I dare you to point out sins  from Train to Busan. I double dare you.
everything wrong with IT
I said almost the same thing through out most of the movie
you should do payback with mel gibson
Guardians of the galaxy vol 2 do it already
Eww Shaun of the dead\nHot fuzz\nThe worlds end
Why didnt you sin the part when she goes outside the ship to fight the alien? That was ridiculous. And just afterwards the alien conveniently jumps right into that robot arm thing? I mean come on!
This is how I watch movies for free
so i guess they weren't kidding, the sin counter really is dead hence why 2.0 is there
IT!!
16:40 lol
Rogue One!!!!!
Do baby driver
okay my dude, i am sweating vigorously rn and you gotta make a video on the new it movie because im really not sure if i should kill you guys or kill myself, thank you.
So,ummm I hate doing this but\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a channel where I make movies and tv show reviews and occasionally I make films and I'm working on a show right now.\n\nI'm not begging you to go watch or anything,I'm just saying \n\nHey I got a channel...wanna watch?
Still a better love story than twilight
Everything wrong with Outcast!!!! Come on Hayden Christensen AND Nicholas Cage both doing bad English accents!!!! Plus a story that is just terrible.
I'm one of the only people who loved this movie
I just dont see why do we need this kind of stories. \n\nLEGO Batman.
Zenomorphs grow in a matter of hours
Also, Please review the original IT film, I remember it freaking me out as a kid, and weirding me out as an adult, with that nostalgic fear, but it is also quite long from memory too. Then there's also the weird part from the book where the kids have to have sex that will forever remain one of the weirdest reading experiences of my life... But I digress.. :d
Who the f***s idea was it to have a ship where the crew are all couples? Did they not ever consider the possibility of emotional ties getting in the way of logical decisions?
Do everything wrong with it (2017)please😄
Everything wrong with the emoji movie
Everything wrong with mean girls
Do everything wrong with it pleaseeee

Yo, Jeremy. Do The Shining already.
wtf? this movie was awesome , real horror , great plot good effects
How about the new movie IT?
This was a fuck awful movie and you barely touched on any of the real sins within it, like why David felt the need to make out with whomever was in arms reach, the sub par cgi worthy of the syfy channel, or the 10 minutes they spent hovering in circles 5 feet above ground trying to kill one alien. \n\nWickedly disappointed in this video, I expected way more from you.
I do like the Matrix screensavers on most of the screens .
i'll do the fingering :')
This is just alien isolastion the game all over again
PUHLEASEEEEEEE Everything Wrong With The Prince of Egypt (I said please omg
Plz do everything wrong with IT
For the animated hero movie, you guys should review this movie that is very far under the radar that I think has an incredible amount of sins. It's called 'The Amazing Adventures of the Living Corpse.'
EVERYTHING WRONG WITH FLUSHED AWAY!!!
Has he done narnia sins
Everything wrong with Kidnap?
*Everthing*  *Wrong*  *With*  *The Emoji Movie*
Oh please please please do one of these on 'IT'
To be honest, I hated this movie. There were barely any major parts with the actual aliens (you know, the thing we bought the movie for), and 90% of those were just really greusome deaths that didn't make the movie any more interesting. All it did was make everyone cringe and throw up. The comeback of the original alien was a good idea, but the execution was so..... boring. It felt like the producers were just desperate for something interesting to put in the trailer to get people to buy their movie. To put it simply, sequels can never be as good as the originals.
DO THE BOOK THEIF OR THE BOY IN THE STRIPPED PYJAMAS\n\n\n\n\n\nEdited cuz there was a spelling mistake
I still have no fucking idea wh at is going on in this film
Do Steven Kings IT
Everything wrong with Rogue One A Star Wars Story!
Im to scared to do this shit cause I have alot if health issues in my family and im like extremely mixed.
You don't become intolerant to dairy, we are always intolerant to dairy, it overwhelms our system.. our system just copes with the crap being in us. When you clean out the system it resent and if you have dairy after a long time the reaction your body has is the response it was always meant to have when given a toxin.. but sadly because dairy is in almost all infant formula and goes through breastmilk we come into contact with the crap from an early age and unable to tell the adults that shit hurts as..
The average british white person is about 37% anglo saxon, 22% celtic, 20% french and german, 10% scandinavian, 3% iberian and 2% italian and greek.
At the end when you said I am never gonna die, I thought you were going to add something like unless I get hit by a car.
Emma you are honestly my favourite YouTuber you're funny and beautiful and just amazing I wish I actually knew you in real life because I think think you're just awesome you're videos always cheer me up and make me laugh just thank you for being you 😊
Subscribed for a very very very very very very long time young immortal woman
The thing about lactose/dairy... is that we SHOULD be intolerant to it. We humans are the only ones who consume dairy products in our adult life. Other milk-drinking-species, stop when they're out of infancy. \n\nSo Emma, you're lactose intolerance isn't weird :p
And there I was thinking you're DNA results were going to reveal you was EPICALLY AWESOME, joke. You already are.
U can turn yr eyes like pennywise
this was a rly funny vid emma good job
Hey, i just wanted you to know that when i watch your videos i get a sense of calm that i get from nobody else. I am bipolar and only discovered this recently but your humour is something i connect with on even the most basic levels and it has helped me overcome the drastic changes my life has taken since then. You are an awesome person Emma please keep doing what you're doing because even when you feel like you're doing shit you're still bringing joy to one up and down mess of a person and i cant thank you enough for that.
Hey congrats on being officially a singer it was written in the metro that you were a singer who just happens to do youtube stuff on the side, and if you're feeling anything about the dna results, watchdog did a test on a dog dna company and well anything including the presenters were matched as being dogs and very specific breeds of dogs at that, so if you want to do one of those you'd get matched to be a dog, I wouldn't trust the results to mean anything, especially as they got very specific things like your earlobes wrong.
My DNA Test Results. I'm WHAT!?\nYou're an Apple superstar. What more do you want to know?
Can i make a request
Upload your zipped raw DNA data to GedMatch and MyHeritage now. They will be different to your 23andMe results. Also GedMatch is far more entertaining to me. Also did you get any bombshell relative discoveries?
Not that I've ever done one of these massively overrated DNA tests, and most-likely never would unless it was some sort of bizarre gift... why is it as I watched this, it so reminded me of THIS movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/ :P\n\nEDIT: On a side-note, best highway-robbery money-scam ever... hey, for only £100+ spit in this test-tube we got from the surplus-shop, and we'll tell you your fortune all the way back to the dark ages!  (Saddest part is, this comes from somebody who's huge into science and used to think DNA sciences were quite cutting-edge...)
Wouldn't Scandinavia be northeastern Europe?
Longer ring finger = male. [:E]  Actually your ring and index fingers are about the same size = feminine.
Hi I'm Scandinavian and I'm watching your videos
Our generation will live to 100
Emma, whats wrong with your neck? Loved the video btw
People experience digestive issues after having omitted certain foods due to bacterial changes in gut. You dont have to be genetically intolerant to bloat from lactose if haven't eaten it in a while... if you can produce the enzyme your body doesn't forget but you probably don't have sufficient bacterial used to digesting lactose and the bacteria you do have will struggle with it\n. Hence bloating. Give it a week or so of eating dairy and there will be more bacteria accustomed to lactose and then less digestive issues. It's all in the gut flora!!
100% European is the best result.
You're going to die but that just means it will be your own fault
Lpyjuhukmm\n\nJlo
I had an ad for Ancestory before this XD
anybody else notice that Emma was on STV news? no? ok
I could've guessed all that from your nose alone
Okay, so... like I can't afford to do that, but from what you've found out we share a LOT in common. The preference for salty over sweet, freckles everywhere, ring finger longer than index, green eyes that aren't quite green.\n\nClearly we're separated-at-birth twins despite my being nearly an entire year older than you and only 25% European at best
Everyone who subscribes to the channel has a 1000 year love of their mother's father and their family and everything they want\nall you have to do is to have a cannon bone and smile
Nordic, not scandinavian lol. Finland was on the list: it's a part of the Nordic countries but not a Scandinavian country
You call that a lot of freckles?! Lol you should we my brother, he's more freckle than white
I actually went and researched on Neanderthals, fairly interesting. Turns out that they were very smart!
I didn't know it also showed your likelihood for terminal and horrible illnesses. I need to do this now lol
I'm a niggee
and then i just didn't exist😂😂😂😭
Its cool to be Scandinavian? What year is this?
Where does it say you're 14 % scandinavian? The only 14 % is 14 % BROADLY NORTHWESTERN EUROPEAN - which can be anything in North Western Europe. Including the british island, france, germany and scandinavia.
You are so comedic! I'm subscribing to you! 😂
It's not only skandinavian you forgot Russia 🇷🇺.........but yeah I'm pretty sure Russia didn't go on raids and...... yup your probably skandinavian .....
Emma, where did you get your shirt, I lovee it! Best wishes from Germany <3
Why does it matter so much if other Youtubers have made a similar video? If you wanna do it, you do it girl. If it's original- okay fab that's great. If it's not original- then okay still fab that's great!
She must be pretty thick to think she was completely British
Broadly Northwestern European doesn't necessarily mean Scandinavian though. It just means that the DNA could be from any northwestern European area including British & Irish, but it can't be confirmed for sure. It's more likely that that assignment is British and Irish instead of Scandinavian considering her already high British and Irish results.  \n\nMore info on the broadly assignment:\nhttps://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212186038-Broadly-assigned-and-Unassigned-ancestry
Now that you mention it, I do see the neanderthal.
The asparagus thing is if your pee smells bad after you eat asparagus
I'm never gonna die!\n\n*hits Emma with train*\n\nJk I would never do that..\n\nI would hit her with asparagus instead :D
My family tree has been laid out on my mother's side for generations. Her family came to America from Germany in 1845. When I first got my Ancestry DNA test results, they didn't mention Germany at all! Then I noticed the results were derived from the information they gather about their other customers. So it is rather like going to a fortune teller 🔮 😂
Did she find out that she's white?
YOU WERE FEATURED IN THE APPLE SPECIAL
Adult humans are infact not supposed to drink milk by default thus your body wouldn't naturally produce the enzyme to deal with it. However if u've continually drunk it from childhood ur body has retained the production of that enzyme. So when u stop for a prolonged period your body sorta forgets coz it's not a default enzyme for adults ... thus u have trouble with lactose after
My top fave youtubers -including lovely Emma of course- have done these test now I'm really curious about doing my own DNA test. :P
i sent mine off about 2 months ago, bloody place takes age the latest said due to the hurricane your results will be delayed, i used my heritage for it and it was on offer at 69 pounds, cant wait to see what it says, as for yours that a lot of Neanderthal you have and very rare, means mostly your family has bread slowly over the 10s of thousands of year and stayed close to England.
You're an idiot for taking a dna test without truly understanding the implications of the test and its results. There, question answered
Whenever I see you now, I'm just going to think Neanderthal.
Not to be that person but the broadly Northern European could actually be British still. They just can't pin point what the Northern European is. It doesn't necessarily mean Scandinavia but it's possible
I have been watching Youtubers for years, and now I keep up with a lot less than I use to, but I still keep up with Emma Blackery, and Jenna Marbles because those two just do whatever they feel like doing and its so genuine, and satisfying.
She's like the perfect human
The moment I subbed: When I predicted that she was going to say: I'm gonna live forever a second before she actually said it :D
You think that's a lot of freckles?\n\n\nI'm ginger.
Emma ! Take care of a good own house, you will need it for a long time
So we have established that Emma is perfect?
Where do you get the spit test thing from? X
Yup, yes I knew it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm Swedish
i very much want to do this, but i'd rather not pay £100
Lmao I didn't know some people couldn't smell asparagus.
She's going to be on the news!!!!!!
I got 61% Eastern European Jewish \n18% Iberian (Portuguese dad) \n12% British (lived in London all my life) \n 2% Irish \n2% African\n1> Caucasian
I love your top
2:02 HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS FROM SWEADEN!!!?
She probably said but where do you do this? I kinda want to find out mine
5:15 sorry Emma, but you are not the first immortal being. There are a few other species on this planet that are biologically immortal, for example: Turritopsis dohrnii, (jellyfish) and Lobsters (Though they could actually die if they fail to molt)
I got I got I got I got black man skin and white man skin inside my DNA
Thought would be mainly Romanian.
Watch out for buses.
she's what
Pause the video at 0:07 hehehe
Those aren't freckles though?
you are WHAT?! sickening
Your funny..   :)
Hi there fellow Scandinavian.
5:13 - 5:20 😂😂😂
Any army here?
Yeah, us swedes sniffed you out immediately. B)
100% European ? \n😴😴😴😴😴😴
No-one cares.
My swede sense tingles
you fun
Emma gives me Nicky from OITNB vibes.
secc haha
the secc
Ya gurl is #20 in trending
24 ON TRENDING! CONGRATS!!!
is she mad
Your DNA test says yes you are a FREELOADER!!! Stop having people pay your bills LOOSER!!!!!
oh you know that test isn't actually accurate
What the hell is a pound. Do you even Dollar?
Let's be honest, AmazingPhil was the first one that did this DNA test and that's because he got it free through his mums friend 😂
You are aware that North Western Europe includes the UK, Germany and France as well, right? Not just Scandinavia?
Nothing more scary in the 70's than an old fridge containing Jimmy Saville and Gary glitter.
1 less VLOG on the trending makes me happy
What happens when the soviets attack and we've smashed all the doors off our Fridges? How will we protect ourselves from the nuclear blast wave?!
I spent the best years of my childhood playing hide n seek in an old fridge....
why the fuck is this trending
I swear they talked about this on a recent Triforce episode?
Don't suppose anyone clicked after being reminded of the Triforce! Podcast?
Why is this on the trending page lmfao
To you, it's just a worn out fridge...\n\nBut to Indiana Jones it's the means to live through the effects of a nuclear bomb.
why the fuck is this trending
My mum knows someone who's child did exactly that and died of suffocation.
Wait a minute, I saw a fridge save Indiana Jones' life from a nuclear bomb  in the kingdom of the Crystal skulls,  and I trust Indy more than I trust the government.
I knew fridges couldn't be trusted. And they all thought I was mad.
Hi, kids. Can you say natural selection?\n\nNo? Well, I'll just leave you alone with this old fridge and we'll see if you make the species stronger or not.
I play with an old fridge everyday and I haven't died yet 👌🏻
All new refrigeration appliances have a magnet which enables the door to be easily opened if someone decides to get inside.\nThis video is just old history.
Is it impossible to open the fridge from the inside? This makes me want to climb inaide one and try it.
Please explain how a video with 35k views gets in trending, YouTube?
Wtf will i use for a castle now
This is serious..i was killed in the 70's by an old fridge.
This campaign must have run deep, I still see white goods dumped, but at least they took the door off
People say this for many things but this is the best example\n\n\nWhy is this trending ?!
My new video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvJb1bVgVRA more retro fun
It saved Indiana Jones... yep that happened
0:26 OK so now we know how the thousands of missing children over the decades were stuffed in fridges and taken to paedophiles
Maybe they wanted to die, who are we to deny a child the right to death by fridge?
More like killing a child's dreams of killing themselves
In America you eat from the fridge in Soviet Russia fridge eats you
Why does this PIF (Public Information Film) STILL scares the living day lights out of people?.
I've been living with one of these silent killers all my life. Please send help.
At least it would preserve the corpse.
Russian kids would've no problem
Why is this trending? Are fridge deaths on the rise
why is this trending in 2017
Yeh, this would have been much better narrated by pflax as Sean Bean
Now the kids are just eating the entirety of the content in the fridge . .yay obesity . If kids knew they could kill might scare em off a bit
This is trending because in a recent episode of Great British Bake Off, one of the presenters (Noel fielding) was locked in a fridge as part of a transition clip I believe, and there were loads of complaints to ofcom about it, as many children have died by getting stuck in old fridges and freezers.
Why is this 33 on trending though
What the fuck
This is trending cos of Noel fecking Fielding isn't it 😅 God damn it Noel, you fridge lurking loon!
Wtf
Kim Jong-Un making this trend?
The triforce podcast
One saved Indiana Jones.
Anyone here from YogPod Triforce?
THANKS EVERYONE!!!
This is what YouTube needs more of these old classic British videos
This was on TV recently.
Why is this trending???!? Lol
they don't make them like this anymore
Why is this number 14 on trending
why would i ever go into a fridge?
Indiana jones survived in one
Old fridges can kill??? Omg didn't know the 70s had sentient fridges. They kept that one hidden... 😱
Chilling
Who the hell keeps an old fridge at home?
0:13 Boy, that escalated quickly
Why is this trending?
Ok. I'll remember
I'm well happy something very British is trending. Pleasant surprise uploader or did you kind of expect it? XD
I'm assuming this public service announcement is so on the nose and heavy handed because something serious happened...
Ok then
Good!  One less mindless Vlog on trending!
The most British thing ever. FRIDGES ARE THE REAL PROBLEM WAKE UP SHEEPLE
#42 ON TRENDING\n\nWhat?
Old fridges can kill!!
Don't play inside of fridges, noted. Thanks again for this. 
why is this trenidng 2011 rly..
The Great British Bake-Off.
It's sad when Google/YouTube promote a 70s ad instead of promoting ads for YouTubers.
The YogPod sent me. Be Warned.
Nowadays the danger of this is invisible because fridges now have magnetic seals instead of locks and they put masking tape over the doors to keep children out.
nuke bomb shield to indaina jones
What a shame! I'm single, on benefits, and I bought a luxury fridge freezer for £2000. It got me into a lot of debt and now I've been evicted. I thought I could live in my fridge as its big enough but I guess not. Oh well, I'll have to shiver on the streets instead.
I remember the BBC broadcasting this child safety film inbetween Jim'll Fix It and Top Of The Tops
Solo vine a dejar mis respetos. Actorazo.
We lost a little light tonight.
Rest In Peace you beautiful man.  🎶
Hoooly crap. I'm a Mexican guy and also (probably) the biggest Alien film fan ever and this just blew my mind away... awesome performance. Hell, he sang it better and with even more soul than most Mexican singers I've known.
it does not matter what language, does it?
Rest in peace Harry Dean Stanton , your mowies and music will live on .
Quentin Tarantino missed an opportunity to have Harry perform live in his movies...  Rest in peace, you awesome man.
May your hauntingly beautiful giving be always celebrated.  Thank you.
RIP HDS <3
quisiera llorar, quisiera morir de sentimiento...
RIP Harry Dean Stanton! :(
Rest In Peace
RIP Great Harry!
Descansa en paz, Sr. Stanton.
A veces tenemos sueños chiquitos que no le decimos al mundo porque no parecen ser relevantes. Uno de estos sueños era conocer a Harry Dean Stanton. Hoy duele algo dentro de mí y lloro mucho su pérdida.
Si,Cantineras,cortavenas,musica para chupar
increíble canción.... es muy bella.... muy poética y tan bien que la canta... que excelente  cantante es! 😊
Years ago I had the extremely fortunate opportunity to see Harry and his music combo at a small club in L.A. called the Mint.
Yaaa Nuu Savi
SUPRISINGLY GOOD SINGER AS WELL AS ACTOR.CONGRATULATIONS HDS.
memories of mexico trip circa 1993 with Kyle Findlay
Great song, great interpretation. But why was it included in a doc about the blues?
f'n love this guy!
Un himno para todos los oaxaqueños...... arriva oaxaca y sus siete regiones..
This song is so beautiful, and sung by this wonderful man, what a soul...blessings to you Harry Dean Stanton...keep singing!
amazing. such a amazing man with so many talents
muy bueno gracias
Y que...  ¡Viva Huajuapan de León! Tierra del sol :D
que salvaje! : ,)
I am Mexican and I must say you need to be a Mexican to really feel and understand the song, however Harry Dean Staton did an awesome job on it!!!
knock out
Nice 1 Harry Dean:)
What a beloved man he is and singing so sweet and high. Talent abounds!
I love this song so much
Ok, I accidentally clicked on this video... and I fell in love. I don't know about lyrics but something in his voice makes me feel really nostalgic and..... I have no idea how to explain this but I'm sure that I have to look for more.
It's crazy how this song talks to me...
Rap, Sing, Dance, visualize, what's else can I expect for? Dope Bobby, congratz with this masterpiece!!!
It's a true story Bobby left his family  to debut with İKON🐰😢😢😢
I loved the song the first time I listened to it. He never disappoints.
I've been busy doing adult stuff esp now that I'm about to get my license. Jesus christ look what i've been missing. This is beautiful, huhuhu wish I could go back to the years where I'm always on time on everything. i'm not that into kpop anymore but any artist under YG will always have a place in my heart. Huhu
Everytime i see the part where he hugs his parents, i remember the time bawling my eyes out when they showed the video of his family in WIN. 😭😭😭
BOBBY it was a great story and meaning! Such a powerful meaning. I also missed seeing Pooh Bear. I loved that you incorporated Pooh Bear. We miss him!! <3
Such a beautiful song. I bet everyone can relate to these lyrics and the meaning behind it
I swear I love this comeback so much omg bless him ❤ ExoLs gonna support you guys and ikon 💪
I like this song way to much 💘
cant wait for the live stages..i know you'll slay
He looks so good, thanks god without bobby and Ikon i will not be fine

just realized that he was actually singing in this song
i'll runaway with youuu.... my pleasure ♥♥♥
Clicks like before the song even started
The lyrics are getting me teary af !
It really meaning :(( same my feeling :(( i cry when i hear this song :(( i really love it :(( i wanna runaway :((
I just want to get this off my chest. I signed up to study abroad knowing damn well that it would cause a lot of complications. Im still stuck in this mess, waiting for my financial aid to come. I ran away to go to korea but i feel like im still stuck. This is a nice experience but when i ran away, it honestly made things more complicated. I totally fcked up and so i feel so selfish that i actually ranaway but i also feel like karma is holding me by my hair and is slowly throwing depression and anxiety at me (not like i didn't have them before). Now that im here, where no one knows me, its liberating but slowly im somehow going back to the feelings of when people knew me. There is honestly a no win-win situation. Probably why people travel so often. Im also really depressed right now bc a lot of things have been falling apart but i know better days will come. I just need a hug. Well that was all mumbo jumbo and confusing but at least that took a little off my chest.
let's stream on yt and melon iKONICS!
Bobby, I'm so proud of you.
This is the song that makes you want to have a break in life's drama. I wanna runaway too. Please take me away from here.
bobby said he expresses more himself in his songs.. i was like before i ever watched both of them ..  i think it will be the same as the group songs but i was totally wrong.. when i watched these songs for the first time ..i dont know what happen to me but the song made me cry and I fallen in love with Bobby.. i dont know how.. its unexplainable.. I felt like he's talking to me while watching the video telling me his story.. and now i am so obsessed of both songs that even i repeat it again and again it still give me the same feeling.. this is the first time i feel like im inside of the song.. i cant explain..
this song perfectly describes my life rn
I like this song👍👍👍
This is freaking awesome I love his voice 😮 It makes you feel like you should be sad but the beat don't let me so I'm an odd mix of happy and sad
Bobby always have had a great future ahead of him
I am so damn proud of BOBBY! He's come so far! and I'm enjoying this so much \nthis song is just OMG!!
Hit like at 00:00.

WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?
What if your logic is completely faulty and inserting a 2nd filter is like a solid object to the light frequency, but inserting lesser blocking filters logically allows more light through until the 90deg. which blocks all ?\nTo me I see no fault in the filters or the original theory of how light works. Dislike.
Nice video, but way too fast for me!
In the case of entangled photons you only measure the ones that pass through A and do or do not pass through the second one (since the difference in angle between A -> B and B -> C is 22.5° both times it is basically the same only rotated). Which means you are only considering photons that are in a state that can be let through by A.\nIn this case you could put a filter with orientation A in front of every filter in the entangled photons test and the result wouldn't change since A -> A is 100%. This changes the entangled experiment to the one where they go through two filters in different time (the first one talked about in teh video) with the same results. \nMy point is that if you only consider the photons that pass through A in combination with the entanglement creates a subset of photons that are the same as if there were a second A filter in front every filter that is used in the entangled photons experiment.\ndoes that make sense? or am I wrong?
This video is too long to watch, but it's simple. polarizing lens changes polarity of light. Put another lens and it changes again. End of story.
Maybe. I have no math backing this but maybe its 15% of the initial 100% and then another 15% of the second 100% which would be the 85%. Idk. I havent thought about it that long.
First we see that one filter alone DO NOT let 100% of the light passing. Then, the rest of the (intended) explanation is about what *they believe they know* about polarization but not about what *actually* happens in polarization.
try looking to RGB color model , u may find some clues :)\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/AdditiveColor.svg
i m going to do Phd in em waves
the filter B tilts the wavelength of the photon so the filter C is not 45° with the wavelength of photon passing through filter C
I know why this is Happening - photons arnt actually passing through the filters - light is just a transmission signal similar to electricity and it's actually the emf of the signal that feeds back that blocks the light (electromotive force)  - block one angle and the emf doubles - and the either on the opposite side crates an anti phase resonanance which counteracts 50% of the signal which nullifies half of the signal - but if you clean up the emf by adding a third filter then there isn't as much emf feedback and thus you get a cleaner transmission and viola more signal gets through as you have decreased the end feedback :) no probabilistic issues just a misunderstanding on what light is and the way it works
Wut if hat dang refraction changes the dad gum polarity of sum waves a little bit, when it changes the direction of the gold darn wave boy howdy 'n wut knot?
You're making a mistake: the filters don't block or pass light; they absorb or polarize it. All light that passes a polarizer filter is polarized by it. The first filter polarizes 50% of all the light, and absorbs the rest. The second filter changes the angle of the already polarized light. cos(x)^2 of the light is re-polarized and sin(x)^2 of it is absorbed.\n \nIn the video, you place one or two filters after the first. The initial filter polarizes 50% of the light, and absorbs the rest. One extra filter at 45° polarizes again 50% of the light, and absorb the rest. The total amount of light passing the two filters is thus 25%.\nTwo extra filters at 22.5° each polarize 85% of the light, so the total amount of light passing all filters is 50% x 85% x 85% = 36%.\nLets scale up to 3 extra filters, at an angle of 15° each. They will polarize cos(15)^2 = 93%, making the total amount of light passing all filters 50% x 93% x 93% x 93% = 40%.\nOr, lets use 45 filters, at 1° each. Now each filter polarizes cos(1)^2 = 99.9695%, making the total amount of light passing all filters 50% x (99.9695%)^45 = 49.3%.\n \nThe mistake you're making is assuming light with a polarization angle of x° keeping that polarization angle after passing a polarization filter. It doesn't: each filter changes its polarization angle, and thus influences how it reacts to the next filter.
This is an absolute failure.  The misappropriated word Filter is where you went wrong. Try refractor lenses or color insert, polarization isn't filtering at all, it's not blocking photons it's changing them. Theres nothing weird here, it's perfect cause and affect.
I have posted a response video to this video https://youtu.be/yMQb_LbqyFY
If a filter determines if a photon passes or not, then I would imagine the photons that are passed also have their polarization corrected.\nUnpolarized light has a 50% chance of passing any filter, thus 50% of photons are passed.\nOf those photons, 100% of them have the same polarization.\n\nAnother way to think of it is this:\nIf you have a laser that is polarized 45 degrees relative to a filter, then 50% of those polarized photons will pass.\nOf those photons that are passed, 100% of those photons have a new polarization that matches the filter.
This is great overall, but I am beyond ready for us to be done with the trend of sped-up hands drawing comics with markers
Entanglement is bunk.\nWhat I found interesting is that it does nto matter which order the filter s are placed, so it is NOT that one interferes in an intermediate fashion, such as filter 1 redirects light at one angle and the 90 degree filter a second angle, permitting no light through, yet the third, in first, second or third position redirects light back.\n\nWell, maybe.\nThis could be tested and could be the reason for the 85% we see.
It's not about passing through, it's about it's visibility. I think you need to rethink this whole video by allowing yourself to see that the light passes through, it's just not light anymore. It's an invisible wave, where the photons are in a different state, like 0 and 1 in computing; you just null-out the light, but the wave (stream), is still there.
i wanna know more about this....
Your video seems to contradict itself:\n- A photon's probability of passing through a 2nd filter is apparently impacted by the relative orientation of the 1st filter it passed through\nBUT\n- A photon's probability of passing through those two filters is apparently unimpacted by whatever 0th filter it has passed through before -- it forgets.\n\nSo, if a photon forgets what filter(s) it has passed through by the time it arrives at the next filter, then why does it not forget what happened at the 1st filter by the time it arrives at the 2nd filter?\n\nI have framed this question as sequences of filters rather than entangled pairs at simultaneous filters, but please feel free to reframe in your answer.
Why do you spend 10 minutes explaining theory and then just say that it's completely wrong
Can photons split or weaken the bond of H2o\n\nWww.neropower.com
When i was little and saw this in school my thought was that it made infrared or ultraviolet light visible to us. So its not that its brighter just that it's brighter to us because light at the spectrum we usually can't see is now somehow because of the effect of the filters in the spectrum we can see.  \n\nI wonder what happens if you put a  spectrum grating filter in front in the mix. Then you could see exactly what part of the spectrum is Reappearing I have a star analyzer im going to run some spectrum analysis on this for fun tonight, i just need to grab another polarizing filter.
the filter reorientates the lost photons so they can pass through the next filter. photons are deflected not consumed by the lens, if the even exist.  Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality. Tesla.
This is why I'll probably never understand quantum physics; to me this experiment shows that the filters don't block the photons but alter them. passing them through multiple filters just alters them back and forth. My question is do you get the same results no matter how close the filter are to each other? In the video you show them right on top of each other, what happens if you move them 10 ft. apart?
Sounds like the photons are vibrating in 3 space to me.  I'm not exactly sure how this works, but I have a feeling it has to do with dot and/or cross products, and that passing through a filter changes the angle of vibration of the photon.
What happens if you put the 22.5 degree filter in between two filters that are lined up (0, 22.5, and 0 degrees)?  Do you just get a 15% drop, or the same 30% drop you would get from a 0, 22.5, and 45 degree combination?  If it's 30%, then isn't the 22.5 degree filter just changing the direction of polarization, acting as an optical wave guide like in an LCD?
Ugh... about 75% of everything you said in the first 3 minutes was flat-out wrong. The polarizer doesn't just magically filter photons or their vectorial components. Each and every photon is physically interacting with the polarizer by exciting electrons within it. Those electrons, in turn, then either re-emit the photons back out or absorb some of that energy/momentum in the form of phonons.
''Please share this video''\n\nNobody I know is smart enough to watch this.
The polarization experiment is a great way to show how light behaves like a wave (it behaves like a particle and a wave). There is a video series called the mechanical universe that explains it perfectly and is in line with things I did in second semester college physics. It's not confusing or mind-blowing at all to me and in my opinion is not a good way to demonstrate Bell's theorem. The polarized lens only allows light to travel through it with the waves moving in one planar direction so the direction that the other filters are oriented makes what happens to the light pretty straight forward.
Can you look at the sun like this
There are photons everywhere right?  So what if when you press the polarizing screens together they pass through A doesn't pass through B then you add C then light from outside gets passed through C then reaches B goes back From A hits the paper Refracts Then passes through A B and C......?  I mean there isn't light coming from only the paper below the screens but also from the surrounding areas..  Also there is small cavity between B and C screens from where light can pass..?  It's glass soo it can make a angle which can be illusionary thay the paper we are seeing through C is actually paper below A,  when in fact the paper we are seeing is outside the paper below A.... I haven't learned any physics or mathematics but it's my guess that could happen....  Like when you put your hand in water and it looks like it's bent in some weird manner.
My theorem:  such things are\nA: proof of the existence of God to any believer\nB: deeply disturbing to everyone else
the math only appears impossible because it's measuring the 2 dimensional representation of a 3 dimensional probability. It's like hyperbolic geometry, if you change the shape the plane by which you observe the object the proofs make sense.
Wade a minute. As a huge fan/student of photons and gravity and such, are photons actually waving through space in a 3D/2D manner? I always sort of thought that the wave of a photon was simply referring to energy peaks and troughs, not an acutally spacial positioning.
I believe our problem in understanding these things is that we still think of light as \/\/\/\ instead of ).).).).).).).).).\nAlso, where you are talking about hidden variables associated with photons, when I believe the reality is variables hidden in the media through which the photon passes and our inability to comprehend exactly what that media is or how it behaves and what influences it has on our perception of what is real and what is not real.\n...and how much of our results are influenced by our expectations.\nThat is to say, conscious expectation influences reality.
Im leaving a dislike because of a click bait look from the thumb nail
In the video, when the photon is depicted as a set of yellow and blue 'vectors' going through (or not) the polarized filter at the origin of the diagram, the interpretation of these vectors naturally implies that the wave is going up and down in space like a rope, held at one end, being shaken at the loose end. However, this isn't the case. The vectors represent instantaneous energy levels in the E and B fields. Photons do not wiggle up and down in three dimensional space.
This is stupid. We have 3rd axis. It's why we are in 3d. light bounces like wave. control it in a tube like a subwoofer.
What's so difficult? (Or what i'm missing?) Photons dont really exist, they are just an abstraction about what happens when something happens to an electron (meaning any changes in electron energy will have an effect on surrounding electrons). This doesnt even deserve a name, but we put it one: photon travelling. \n\nThis polaroid thing is sooo easy to grasp if you see the filters as if they were grids of cupper bars in front of an antenna.  And it's literally the same thing.\n\nIf the effects of an electron moving in antena (or photon transmitted from antena) are catched by the filter (i.e. current is induced) their energy will be newly manifested locally, if not it will pass unmanifested. Being the chances to be catched by the filter in relation with the orientation of the original oscilation and the orientation of the grid bars.
I got blocked at a
Isn't this a perfect example of Light acting as both a wave and particle? every example you talked about assume photon is acting as a definite particle, be we know that wave functions can be distorted when interacted upon (like wave through a slit). It is not far out to consider the polarization effect is not affected.\nYour explanation assumed that the polarization directions are not changed as it passes through the 45 degree angle, and thus the last filter will block the light as with the first case.\nBut clearly this isn't the case. The fact that 45degree doesn't cut the light by 25%, but by a number related to cos, is clear indication that it is reacting as a wave function and not a particle.\nThis interaction probably affected the polarization angle of the exiting light, which is something scientist should consider studying. In fact, the result that the last filter's reaction support this hypothesis
The problem here is a logic problem and not a physics problem and this would indicate that the fundamental model of a photon, as stated, is flawed.  People tend to see light as either a wave or a particle since it has properties of both, but I see the possibility that light is a particle that moves at the speed of light, has two opposing poles and a rotation of the poles end over end (instead of rotating around the poles like earth).  Since the fields of the particles in the filter and the field of the photons can interact in such a way to alter the spin of the photons, you can have photons that come out of the filter with a different rotation then when they went in.  What if other particles were also similar and had two or more poles and its rotation of or around those poles, added with the direction of movement, could determine what type of particle it was?  You could define photons, electrons, protons and neutrons all with a single model and could determine how to convert between them.
I dont get what the linear filters have to do with quantum mechanics. Most of these things can be derived using classical wave mechanics and do not depend directly on quantum mechanics. The Polarization of light is a natural consequence of Maxwells equations. The paradox you mentioned is not inherently quantum
This is not some mystical quantum effect.\n\nYou both don't understand how a polarizer works. It's not just excluding light from passing, it's literally shifting some of the light so it can pass through... You can see this right from the start when you look at any one filter... It's not CRAZY dark, how could that be possible if 99% of all the light was being blocked at various angles???\n\nFact is angles through to 45 allow light to be polarized through... Perpendicular angles don't.
I am really thankful to you two for this video.
XD the reason it keeps getting brighter every time you add a lense is because it is magnifying the light.
So 20% of photons passing through A are acting as such.\n\nA yes & C no unless enacted upon by (or encountering) B.
Aaaaaand if the polarizing lens is a polarizing wave guide? Then this all makes sense, doesn't it?\nThe question then becomes How thin can the lens be before it's no longer a polarizing wave guide?\nThe answer: It will no longer guide or filter the waves because it's too thin. This is why polarizing  lenses are not an atomic coating by now.\nFeel free to correct me with known facts if I'm wrong, as this is only a hypothesis. My education is in radio frequencies, signals, and conduction.\nAgain come with measured facts, as any less would be an insult to you, not to me.
I have a nose bleed. And ear bleed.
I'm a cat watching chess.
Makes perfect mathematical sense if you see the photon polarization as vectors. You calculate the amount of light that passes by breaking the vector into perpendicular components, one of the components aligned with the filters.With only the two filters, the second filter blocks the light entirely because a vertical vector has no horizontal component. Introducing a middle filter breaks  the vertical vector into two smaller components one aligned with the middle filter and the other perpendicular to it, the latter one gets blocked and the aligned one passes. Now the vector has a 45 degree angle, and this vector does indeed have a horizontal component that will make it through the final filter. Maybe physicists are overthinking it?
Photons are not blocked by any filters....the filter only allows some photons to act a certain way...again no photons are lost between filters..and they do no all act the same way...stop thinling we stopped the photons from passing through the filter,  we just can't measure some photons that are behaving in certain ways...our flawed way of viewing the photons are leading the flawed idea that we can stop photons from passing through a filter...more photons are seen when more filters are add because it allows the photons to act in ways where we can see them better, this no photons were ever blocked from passing through the filter....smile
85% or 86.6%? This is essential
If 100% pass through A, then you add C and 50% are blocked, it's dependent on how A & C interact.\nIf 100% pass through A, then you add B and 15% are blocked, it's dependent on how A & C interact.\nIf 100% pass through A, but you have both B & C after it, it only matters how B & C interact because 100% already pass through A.\nA doesn't matter as 100% pass through it. It only matters what comes after it. If another filter interferes with A alone, then it does. But if 2 filters are added, they ignore filter A because it let's 100% through, and they interact with each other.
If you had an infinite number of screens between 0° and 90°, in sequence, would each photon not have their polarization altered by such an amount that, between each of the infinite screens, 0% are blocked, and so that, when the infinite sequence is over, and it reaches 90°, all of the photons that went through the first screen at 0° pass through the screen at 90°?\nDo a number of photons not rotate their orientation when passing a screen whose rotation is between 0° and 90° to their local rotation?\nIf I'm not wrong, that might explain the difference between 2 screens, 90° from each other blocking all light, and multiple screen, ranging from 0-90° blocking less than 100° of photons.\n\nBut I'm no quantum physicist.\nI'm just a currently drunk artist.
Anyone else notice how the top-left quarter of the filter at 1:06 was darker? Was that just a reflection or was that part of the layered, polarization effect?
Instead of ruling out hidden variables, doesn't the phenomenon simply suggest filter B changes the state of the photons to make them more amenable to passing through C?\n\n(I like hidden variables.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_loyzL9Wi4&t=36s Please forgive raining on your parade, but a bit of Fact Checking might enlighten the discussion. Volume 3022 August 1986 Nature Journal, published the REPLICATION RESULTS of THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE that astonishingly proved conclusively the existence of the Ether / Aether Field that the famed Michelson Morley experiment was unable to detect. The US Air Force Replication used much more accurate metrology, and incidentally revealed almost the exact predicted result Michelson and Morley expected should their experiment confirm the existence of the Ether.... Now that we know the Ether/Aether does in fact exist, we can send all those erroneous text books to pulp recycling. They have no legitimate place on out Library Shelves. Houston recently received over 50 inches of rain with Hurricane Harvey. August 1986 The US Air Force delivered more rain that that on many smug pseudo-scientific quackademic's Grand Parades, and Nature Journal Volume 3022 was The Hurricane. .
This is a load of bollocks, it's treating light in 1 dimension it's not talking about light that the eye does not see that still passes through. Hence the light coming back if a third angle is brought into play.
My theory is that if the variable that determines if a photon is going to pass through changes for each passing, you have to look at each change in degrees between filters and not the sum\n\nLight passes through a 0º filter and then a 45º filter and losing 50% of light. There is a 50% change in degrees towards losing 100% light at 0º and then 90\n\nLight passing through a 0º then a 22.5º and then a 45º and having 70 % of light left makes sense because each change in filter-degree is 15% removal of photons. So two changes of 22.5º would equal 2*15% light \n\nJust like two 45% angles would probably equal 25% light and not 0%\n\nThis might be because filtering the light changes the polarisation of the photons or some other variable. So the change in angle affects how much light passes through rather than the sum of the angles. \n\nEven when you consider entangled photons, wouldn't this only change the result of the first filter passed trough. If the photons pass through different filters, and these filters change their polarisation or some other factor, how could you be sure that the photons didn't change in different ways after the first filter and either stopped being entangled or that the polarisation of the photons could change and be different from each other while still being entangled. Are there any studies or research on this? \n\nI am not a pfysicist and just throwing my toughts out there, any feedback appreciated,  i  might be far from anyhting.
Can you publish again without the elevator music?  I suffer from a kind of dyslexia that makes secondary sounds very distracting and so I really can't follow the dialogue on this at all as my brain just goes stupid music stupid music stupid music the whole time, I ended up having to mute it and use the CC's.
FIlters are just refracting light AWAY from your line of sight, the filter in the middle Redirects it in such way that the third filter  refracts into your line of sight again
Ok, I had a hard time following both of the videos :D So, bare with my potential stupidity.\nHere's what I'm wondering(and the question is slightly to the side of the topic). This video shows the 3 filter polarisation weirdness - filters clamping the polarisation with certain probability, as I understood(even weirder is the fact that only the other video explains why it happens). So, if the particles go through two filters in different time, the polarisation aligns to the last filter. But what happens in the entangled experiments, where they go through simultaneously? Is entanglement broken? Or are they aligned to both? Or do they keep relative entanglement, but each one is polarised differently?\nOr did I misunderstand, and they don't get clamped, so they just keep the starting polarisation the whole time? But then I'm back to not understanding the 3 filter thing...\nNot even sure if the entangled experiment is purely theoretical or not, but I feel like scientists wouldn't be lazy enough to not try adding a second pair of filters. I hope there's an adult around who knows, cause I don't feel like reading through several whole studies - this question is super specific :3
It's simple the photon Passing through the filters change it's wave length, that's why when A,B, and C filters are in there is more light than just filter A and C because the filter B twist and rotates the wave length of the photons which surpasses the regular wavelength being introduced
what if the photons have an if then statement? (if going stricly from a to c and b does not interfere/go in front of a, then  go through c
And then he said \nBut that would be crazy\n...
i was under the impression that the polarized lenses were basically just like very thin slats.  my opinion is that the light, not hitting perpendicular, is being twisted/refracted by the angle that they hits the slats in the filter, thus allowing the light to do the same in the next filter and shining through.  prove me wrong.
What if the polarity of the photons that get through is adjusted as they pass through the first filter?  This means the number that get through the second filter is highly dependant on the previous filter.
Is it possible that the light is reflecting off of multiple angles causing the light to bend around the lenses? One of the factors could be the thickness of the lenses and maybe the angle of each ridge within the lenses. I am not claiming to know or even understand any of it. I was just thinking the reason they can let different degrees of light in at different degrees of rotation is because there are ridges blocking light and or letting it pass. So my thought is if it is being blocked by adding another lense the light is just projecting at a non visible angle, then when you add another the ridges of the third are reflecting the light back at a visible angle
wouldn't it make much more sense to just say that the mechanism by which a polarizing filter attenuates non-polarized light has the ability to affect the polarization direction of the photons which get through? \n\nThis explanation doesn't tell you which photon will get through, but that could easily depend on factors that can only be probabilistically known.
Sorry bro I passed out when the math started
what happens if it's not quantitative, but 'the job' that the photons are given; so if filter 1 only lets 85%  photons through and filter 3 lets 100% of the remaining photons through, then 100% of the light now shows up so is as bright as filter 1?
Amazing video. I've learned about polarization in my physics class at school and was bored to death. Who would've thought you could make an interesting intro with that :D That's the difference between a good teacher and a bad one like the one I had :/ Fascinating stuff
Could it be because a photon's orientation changes over time, and that the speed of the photon decreasing as it passes through the filter changes through the filter to a point where the cycle of angles is skewed so it can pass through B and/or C, even though it should've been blocked by one of them?
Known bug, this was patched in Life 1.2
did you remember what you were thinking about?
The answer is on the angles.
Its been a long time since I studied physics but something seems off about this experiment. A more detailed experiment might be needed to collect useful data. As there are factors that could be effecting a simple experiment with camera filters. \n\nThe main thing that bothers me about this is idea of the filters blocking the particle. I'm not sure how the filters or particles work in detail. However, the question pops up what if the wave is simply being changed or redirected? This would explain why stacking filters results in different behaviors. The start of the experience is what sparked this thought as the rotation resulted in different levels of light. Since the filters are at different rotations could this change the results? \n\nI would be interested in seeing a much more detailed experience using different filters, rotations, and maybe use of lasers to control amount of light.
Why are you assuming light travels in straight lines and that once you filter, they don't change in orientation as the travel.  Also, why are you assuming an actual physical particle travels through the lenses?  Why can't photons exist and then become luminous when they are acted on by electromagnetic waves in the light spectrum?  The math works out.

Anthony Joshua is a best. been following him for a while and feel like he is the heavyweight heir to Tyson. dude is pure class and wish him the best from the US.
So, this Bone idiot NOT talking has made him a hero with right wingers. Can you fools get any worse? I'm sick of people like Maher making this jackass important. He should be ignored like every rational person in his life has done. I know exactly what he is.
To think that Russia meddled with the election is retarded, Trump hasn't done anything in Russia's favor so far, in fact he has done more against Russia. Also there is absolutely zero evidence for it. Also the top CNN contributor who is extremely anti trump and left leaning admitted that the whole Russia thing was a nothing burger so it's pretty much debunked at this point, old news. But I'm sure they'll find more ways to connect the two even though it's proven to be false by now.
Nothing but respect for Ken Bone. We need more voices like this!
I'm Ken Bone.
Fuck this guy and everyone like him. Complaining about Republicans the entire time but still somehow enamored by Donald Trump. Sure, Hillary wasn't amazing but if you took one look at her policies compared with Trump, how the fuck could you even consider trump. Ken Bone, I hope you fucking die of a horribly slow and painful cancer, along with your entire family and everyone you ever appreciated in this world. Fuck you.
I used to think Ken Bone was a dumbass, but he's actually pretty intelligent. He's also smart enough to never tell anyone who he voted for, not because he cares about influencing people. Please. Because as soon as anyone knows who he voted for, his value goes way down. He's the undecided poster child. He has to maintain that undecided aura.
The US has interfered in foreign elections four more times than any other foreign country try to interfere with us elections. You folks have to do your research.
Shit I thought this was old
I'm sorry I'm distracted by the hair sticking out of the side of Bills head :-)
He's wearing a red sweater. That's saying something.
Clinton is a two faced, pandering, corrupt, shill, lying piece of political shit. There's no reason to like her. She's the most fake person I've ever seen run for president
I think Bill thought this interview would go differently than it did.
MSNBC is equally as far left as Fox is far right.
Ken Bone is a rational human being. Bounced on my boy's rationality for hours.
He voted for McCain, he voted for Romney, he voted for Hillary. All the same. Unfortunately, the guy we thought was going to be different ended up being the same too (Obama).
Smart man.
Guy looks like your typical reddit neckbeard cuckold.
Don't be fooled by the undecided voter deal.  He's a pathetic, timid, weak pawn of the establishment to move along their agenda while publicly whoring himself out for money/attention/fame.  He also wears red sweaters on tv and agrees to talk to people who publicly mock him openly on national TV and he acts like nothing is wrong.  He's clearly a Democrat.
Ken Bone for President!!💪
Bill Maher, you fucking suck... Ken Bone? Really? Why don't you invite some real progressives on your show like Cenk Uygur, or Lee Camp, or Glen Greenwald (haven't seen him in a while), or Chris Hedges? No, you invite crazy right wingers, establishment lefties, celebs, and fucking memes like Ken Fucking Bone. You used to be be an actual progressive voice, Bill Maher, and now you're just a fucking out-of-touch retard.
Hes not hard to understand. He is the average American when it comes to political thinking. The majority of our country doesnt care about how ppl live their own lifes. We don't care about political bullshit. We just want it to work how its supposed to.
The Gettable? i don't even know that word exist lol
Lmao, ​let it fucking go, Bill! Jesus, Hillary was a bad candidate stop reaching and move on broski!
Look I didn't vote for either disaster in this past election...and I didn't vote for the escaped mental patients called Jill Stein and Gary Johnson either...but the fact that Maher cannot even grasp why people dislike/despise Hillary shows me that he is out of touch and clueless about what many Americans think
sorry bill, you're funny and all that, but this guy has a much more politically open mind than you..wake up
He's right...80 days for elections in Canada is too long. If you can't articulate your positions and sell yourself in 80 days...you don't deserve to be elected
I like how Ken was making clear the whole time that this interview shouldn't take place
A seemingly intelligent man with an open mind? HE'S A WITCH.... BURN 'IM.... BURN 'IM!
Ken Bone is legit the definition of a nice man.
Tell us, plebian - why don't you like us?
The guy is an idiot. Its cute how he thinks he really has the power to significantly influence people though. Still, I won't put anything past this country anymore!
Could not agree with Bone's my vote is my business. We need more of it. Especially from celebrities and news anchors and reporters. In fact I would suggest that all famous people should not be allowed to vote. Because they are biased.
I am not sure why Bill Maher was trying to make a sales pitch. I think he is very knowledgeable on most things and you could have a debate with him without getting all worked up. I think people need to go in a discussion with an open mind instead of trying to preach or change one's opinion.
He always gives me a full boner
The GOP has in a roundabout way succeeded in Gerrymandering the Electoral College, that is why they won.
Independence = Freedom. Take from it what you will.
This man needs to run in 2020. I'd vote for him if I was an American, but I can't because I'm British and sensible
Stop trying to make Ken Bone a thing.
You must have been molested by a real estate agent...😆😭😵
I put off watching this video because I thought it would be cringy. Wound up being an intelligent, honest, non confrontational conversation. Just a well spoken regular guy on  TV. Refreshing.
I love when straight up people with zero agenda like this guy just baffels Politicians and Bill Maher. They just don't get it when people are human beings.
At the end he basically said he voted for Hillary.
That Homer Simpson moron voted for Trump. If you can't recognize that Trump is a scumbag that is unfit for office you are part of the problem. Trump is a failed president.
He voted for Johnson and threw away his vote.  There's making a statement and being honest about who you are and then there's doing your part to prevent a woefully unqualified imbecile from becoming POTUS.  I chose the latter because I was really scared.  Johnson didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of winning.
Everything Trump does is the greatest ever, classic narcissistic personaltiy
I thought this would be humorous..\nBut damn. I think Bill Maher got his ass kicked by Kenn Bone. This was awesome.
It's amazing how Ken Bone appears more composed than Bill  Maher.
I don't understand the praise of this man. Really? You were undecided after listening to Trump's grab 'em by the _____ hot-mic moment? You were undecided after learning Trump deliberately barged into the dressing rooms of underage girls' pageants? After mocking a reporter with a disability? After the Trump University scam? After using charity funding to settle personal legal disputes?
Interesting interview. I thought at first this guy was a joke, but I enjoyed hearing his perspective.
Works at the power plant? Boner Simpson?
So Bill doesn't know why Hillary isn't liked? She voted for the Iraq war, tpp, is being funded by Sadie Arabia, voted for the wall between Mexico and the USA, voted for more war if she was president and she doesn't know why people dont like her? By the way trump would of done the same thing that Hillary did because he said it in interviews and was making deals with Sadie Arabia during the primary and as president was bought off by them #bernieorbust
Please don't feed him anymore he is about to explode.
Ken Bone is just trumps Joe the plumber.
Ken Boone, was one of the better guests in recent memory.
Holy shit. Going back to rewatch this piece i cant help but be reminded how much se cupp ruined this episode. Her suck is even intenser. This was a nice interview. Why do we need to know his vote? He is right idc and there are dummies that would care too much. He had good answers.
The guys a good dude
If the Dems want to get guys like this maybe they ought to push American ideals like production,  the Individual,  freedom and prosperity instead of their usual left wing,  collectivism.   Pathetic. \n\nYou know He voted for Trump!   MAGA bitches.
You know what?  Fuck this guy.  Why are this small minority of people who are so lame that they couldn't make up their mind in such a polarizing election suddenly become the only people who are catered to and ultimately, choose the political future of our country?
Seems like Bill was regretting bringing Ken Bone on the show by the end of the interview.
OH GOD I WAS MOLESTED BY A REL ESTATE LADY
Bill's impression of his own influence on the electorate is the most hilarious thing about him. I'll be honest with yuh; I have a dog in this fight: I wanna convince you. One minute within earshot of Bill's Maheronic audience tells even the most politically ignorant sap exactly whom Maher controls: those who already agree with what little he actually has to say.
Time to make the doughnuts.
Ken is much more articulate and personable than I had imagined.
News to me. Only white people are presumed innocent I guess.
From his last statement you know he voted for Hillary :)
I guess Ken Bone has been hit with so many political discussions he's learned how to handle himself. Bill Maher was getting frustrated with him. But I think Mr Bone was one of clearest thinkers I've seen on any show in recent years. If he was the average voter we'd have a chance of returning to a political system that could almost work again. Mr Bone has successfully bridged what to most people is a fixed, unbridgeable partisan political divide. Good for you, Ken.
This Ken Bone dude has quite a good view on those political shenanigans. He hold is ground with gusto!
Real time with Ken Bone
Bill. This guy actually has a lot of intelligence, and very libertarian. I don't understand why, in this interview, you're being a dick to him. He speaks as a normal voter. I don't agree with everything he says, but he spoke it all very well and explained his thinking very straight forward
This dude restored my faith in America
Maybe because Hillary Clinton went MIA during the campaign and Trump was having double header rallies in the swing states. Don't underestimate the power of likeability, or unlikeability in her case.
Ken Bone.  Man of the sweater.  Lover of prego porn.  lol.
He voted Trump. Any other answer would have gotten him a round of applause, and he'd have no problem saying it in public. He's not stupid, he doesn't want leftist mobs coming after him.
Of course you're confused by Ken Bone, Bill...he represents the future of balanced political thinking.
Ken Bone is an idiot that loves attention.  I know he says he doesn't, but you can tell he's one of those people that acts all undecided so he'll get focused on.  Everything he was saying he believes in politically like taxing corporations and rich people more is Democratic ideology, yet he still says he's not a Democrat.  We're in a sad state when this putz becomes a viral hero.
towards the end bill completely disrespects Ken by talking about him as if he wasn't talking to the man himself
Ken bone for 2020!
Ken Bone is boning all the pussies at this point
So many ignorant people... Ken Bone is ignorant. Voting Gary Johnson is retarded. Those who hated Hillary for being too right wing fell for Russian propaganda on the internet, then there are the butthurt communists who can't handle moderation. And I HATED hillary and am conservative but Hillary was the only logical choice in 2016. Those who voted for Trump are braindead.
The comment on the racist Criminal inJustice System got the thumbs up.
I don't believe for a second that this guy was undecided.
Bill she isn't a centrist, she is center-right. She is a corporate democrat bitch, neo-liberal mongrel that is so incapable of self reflection that she released a book blaming everyone else but herself for her lose in 2016. You have such a huge blind spot for her and it annoys the hell out of me.
Courting idiots like Ken Bone is the reason democrats lost the election. Democrats should be trying to get the votes of progressives by offering them policies that will actually improve their lives like single payer healthcare, affordable education, election reform, raising the minimum wage and job creation. If they did that they'd never lose a presidential election again. Stop trying to win the vote of indecisive idiots like Ken and focus on trying win back the vote of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.

Que chilenos tan patéticos xDD
Osea, ¿video negativo?
Cr7 paga impuestos :V Hijodepta
Estuvieron fuertes los temas de este video, gracias Manu
malu ere el mejor#el mejor
cual es la canción que ponen al final?\nalguien me puede decir
jajaj CR7 habla como retrasado, lleva ya años y años en España, país vecino de portugal, su lengua natal es mas parecida al español que al ingles, y aún así no sabe hablar. Me imagino que los abogados y fiscales se reían de las cosas y pretextos que decía CR7, por algo tiene esos juicios o audiencias, porque se detectó que no pagó al fisco y punto, más allá que diga que es un ignorante obtuso que solo sabe patear una pelota.
Con este hecho mas que claro que en chilehay puro simio deja que se juvilen sus actuales jugadores y lo único que tendrán para presumir son esas 2 copas y la goleada al peor México de la historia igual volverán a ser un equipo mediocre
Que estupido lo de la marcha sobre la chica de Alexis
Que manga de pajeros, con marchas le quieren manejar por segunda vez la vida a Alexis, si serán boludos
Like si lo viste después del partido
MANIPULADORES de la informacion\nPorque lo que el dijo que le gustaba mas Inglaterra porque aya nadie anda con pajas de quererse hacerse famoso con su nombre
Qué mal por lo de lewandowski :(
Crack son lejos la actualidad que necesita un futbolero de lo q pasa en lo internacional, pero lo interno de cada país dejarlo ahí! Lo de alexis es una broma, es una idiotez q siquiera lo dejes para enjuiciar! Saludos desde chile. Es obvio q no se hará una marcha y solo para reírse.-
Jajajaj ustedes se lo creen todo , aqui en chile creamos eventos para solo reirmos o hacerlos virales no para ir en serio xd si ustedes ven el evento esta lleno de memes nada serio 😹
@cracks acá en chile hacen bromas con las marchas y protestas en Facebook jsjs
Excelente palabras de Cristiano para defenderse, no soy su fanboy ni de cerca, pero simplemente me parecio perfecto lo que dijo Cr7.
cuanta razón tiene cristiano wow reflexione mucho el mismo dijo que apenas tenía 6° grado de primaria un genio total con esfuerzo está donde esta hoy en día el mejor jugador del mundo
luego dicen que aqui no son chismosos en este canal..a la gente solo le interesa el futbol,no cuantos años cumple el niño de messi o si el feo de alixis tiene una novia rubia...bueno normal les encanta las telenovelas,,,,hablen de futbol carajo
No entiendo los no me gusta al video... , es un exelente trabajo de video e información exelente trabajo! CRACK!!!! Siempre me mantiene informado!
Esos que quieren que Alexis y su novia terminen son porque no tienen
Chilenos pendejos jajajajaja\nAlexis no tiene ritmo porque el muy pelotudo decidió no entrenar como protesta para que lo dejen ir al M.City.. La culpa es entera de el y no de la elfa con la que cosha..
Aquí la única noticia sobresaliente es que Benzema sea el 4to capitán de el real Madrid. No chinguen!!!
6to de primaria y yo aquí ganando salario mínimo hasta con la carrera :/ 
Como se llama la canción del final del vídeo? Like para que lo vean
Chilenos cagones 😂\nMira que echarle la culpa a un culito
Me parece que Cristiano pudo ser engañado, o que españa quiere sacarle dinero, soy Culé y me caerá mal por egolatra pero no creo que sea una mala persona y menos un defraudador de impuestos
Anda que manda huevos que los del Madrid se quejen de los árbitros...
Like si cristiano es inocente
Por eso admiro mucho a CR7 se sabe defender sabe jugar al futbol es el jugador perfecto que mas quiere la gente de el lo admiro lo amo
realmente que estupidez esa marcha...
En algunos paises organizan marchas para defender sus derechos y defenderse de los gobiernos...marchas por hambre..desempleo y muchas injusticias...los chilenos marchan para que un jugador deje a su novia?? Son tontos o que les pasa?
like 👍si quieres a lewandowski en el madrid!!
jaja una marcha para que alexis sanches deje a su novi. HAHA CE MAMO :V
Necesitamos que todos los grandes de Italia regresen a su nivel para que los jugadores de élite se quieran quedar. Aún recuerdo la época en la que todo jugador reconocido quería jugar en el calcio italiano.
Lewandowski al Madrid por favor
Cr7 el mejor de todos, me conmovió el comentario de que solo tiene hasta 6 año de escolaridad pero tiene el carácter de decirlo, no merece que en España y alrededor del lindo le tengan envidia y lo quieran ver hundido. Grande CR7 The Best
Que mamada lo de Alexis 😒😒😒😒😒
ahí está mourinho que más quieres para llevarte a cr7 de vuelta
gracias a dios que no se fue al UNITED hahaha
Me llegan Cracks y tienen razón wow me llega todo sus noticias del fútbol sigan así u no falten siempre sigan informando todo
es una puta locura tener que pagar 14 millones de impuestos en 3 años...
Si es cualquier que los jugadores tienen que andar pagando una ofortuna para andar en un país son cualquiera
con esa mujer, yo tambien tendria bajo rendimiento
Me da pena Cristiano. Sus Asesores muy mal. Obviamente como uno no sabe no entiende.
Alguien sabe como se llama la cancion de fondo que sale al final del video?
Quien va a ir a perder el tiempo a esas marchas, solo es una broma, es  webeo.
Amigo,no tienes que decir Cristiano así defendió su inocencia se dice así defendí su supuesta inocencia por qué no sabes si culpable o no
Manu es solo ironía de nosotros los chilenos, esa marcha que se menciona es solamente para la risa, nadie va a estar marchando por estar en contra de la novia de alexis😂😂😂
Que pasa con la voz de cracks mx manu brabo
se ven pendejos los madridistas diciendo que los afectan los albritos cuando claramente son unas cochinas, cerdas y sucias fauleras. solo es para justificar su mala racha. NO SOY CULE por si lo piensan
y la deja es un tarado no tiene la culpa. el equipo son 11 no 1 jajaja
Quiero que mi argentina clasifique al mundial :
La Marcha!! \nQue termine luego él culiao con mayte
A pesar de todo siempre caballero Cr7
La verdad es una persecución tremenda en España hacia los futbolistas.la parte donde cristiano dice que solo tiene 6° de escuela me dio directo en el kokoro
La cancion del corto es down for the long run cospe remix:)
Ese hijo de puta hablando de expulsiónes  del barsa y Madrid q no mame!!!! Los del Madrid son unos putos carniceros nomas por empezar porq no acabo, Ramos Casemiro y cuando estaba Pepe no se diga jajajjaja y en el barsa busquests así q no mame ese vergas hablador
Ya sabes el juego\n1messi\n2cristiano\n3suares\n4neymar\n5dybala\n6pogba\n7alexis\n8marcelo\n9pique
Marcha para que Manu entienda el Chiste de las Marchas xD
cracks necesito como se llama la cancion que utilizan cuando van hablar en corto
Jueguen limpio, y no les expulsaran a ninguno en Madrid!!
0:50 al menos es sincero >:v
alguien q me diga como se llama la cancion q empieza en el minuto 2:27
Q chistosa la marcha pero puta... es puro webeo po obvio jajaja aguante el crack estamos recién a septiembre  queda mucho
la justicia de España esta bien cabrona  primero Messi y Neymar   y ahora CR7  porque no  hacen lo mismo con jugadores  sin chavos :v
Soy del Barça pero creó que la política y la prensa son una mierda y pues si Cristiano es inocente esperó que todo acabé bien Visca al Barça
Like y hacemos una marcha para la marcha que le harán a Alexis JAJAJA xdXd.
Y supongo que el problema de Piqué es Shakira
Una pregunta\nAlguien sabe cómo se llama la canción que suena al final de todos los vídeos
JAJAJAJA ESTOS CHILENOS YA NO SABEN QUE MAS INVENTAR O A QUIEN MAS ECHARLE LA CULPA...ENTIENDAN QUE NO SON LA MEJOR SELECCIÓN DEL MUNDO, A VECES, CUANDO ABRÍS MUCHO LA BOCA Y TE CREES MÁS DE LO QUE SOS, EL UNIVERSO SE ENCARGA DE PONERTE LOS PIES SOBRE LA TIERRA.
Haha ya no le dan Alexis
Que mal que no sepan distinguir bromas ... Las marchas son bromas ya que se vive en un país lleno de injusticias entonces para cada motivo se convocan a marchas.
Que pelotudos los Chilenos pensando que el problema es la novia cuando Chile nunca jugo bien lo poco que tiene lo robo
Like si quieres que CR7 se valla a inglaterra
Marcha para que MANU entienda las tallas de las marchas chilenas jajaja
Veni, 6to año de escolaridad? Eso es el ultimo año de la secundaria o el primero? Me sorprende bastante el nivel académico de los futbolistas
Ty was ready to go in for the kiss!
If only Wenger knew how much Ty backed him, Ty would be getting a lift home from him
The ting goes Skrapppp Pap Pap Pap Pap 🇫🇷
Who else had the same feeling as me.......that TY would be there before.......I clicked on the video!😂😂
Look who is In front riding dick lol
Ty hahaha
Lucky, should have asked why he hasn't played laca alexis and ozil together yet
Get Ty out of there, Wenger must be so sick of seeing his face
#wengerout
We speak to arsene lmao, he sat there listened and gave a rye smile. Clickbait much :/
Arsene not responding to TY, trying not to go public with their love story in front of the cameras
'Should've told him to get out of the club' don't be ridiculous, you can't say that shit to his face. Be respectful even though it's time for him to go.
Leave our club
I bet ty was jizzing his pants when wenger stopped for him
Arsenal supporters are mugs with more money than sense. Clowns club.
I forget ty is in his 40's.
I didn't see it
how fucking long do these losers stay after the game? just to ask one stupid question
Proof YouTube trending is bs. This is at 31.5k views, is 2 days old, less than 450 total likes/dislikes and is 22nd on trending.
ty looks like he's about to suck arsenes dick
He hates you gooner fans you can just tell. Can't blame him either, bunch of brown nose back stabbers.
Ty tryna jump in the back seat
This is cringe!   It's that TY mugster.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET ANYONE EXCEPT TY TO ASK ARSENE QUESTIONS 😫😫😫😫
How far does Ty wanna go up Arsene's arse.
Wenger in
ty probably nutted in his pants
Ty's creaming in his pants hahaha wee gimp
the state of our fans..IGNORANT, fickle bandwagon morons
1sniff 2sniff
Fixed strategies
How Much Ass You Wanna Lick TY.
Wenger in
TY Bumbsucking
Ty wanted to sniff Wenger's ARSE!!
Ty thinking his uber pool pulled up
#WengerOut
Ty cracked a semi
leave him alone ffs
Ty , wenger is his grandfather
AW is happy and in a good mood normally AW doesnt lower his window. How many times was TY waiting till midnight for Wenger to come out and Wenger didnt turn up or already left the stadium. Poor bloke
Arsene rolling thru like a fresh salmon
Shouldve told him to leave, tf is this?
Wow what a long chat. U guys must be his best buddies.
Did he throw a water 💦 bottle 🍶 at you?
Can't believe you got to meet the worst premier league manger in history
When the outro is longer than the actual video
Ty get your nose out of wengers rear end.lol arsenal fc not arsene fc.
Makes sense..Ty does have the intelligence of a child
should have told him to get out of the club!
Clickbait
Why doesn't anybody smash his windows, I wish I stayed longer
I didn't mention it in the video but another great feature coming is native screen recording. You can access it right from the control center and it's actually how I got the footage at 0:25.
Android has had all of this for the longest time, this is hilarious
Great content, amazing channel!
hey can u please make an unboxing video on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ans also a Real Day in Life one, i will love it!!!!

Best tech at Walmart or autozone
IPhone 10\n$20,000
Copy Samsung much??
What iphone 7 case do you use/recommend
Cool
Hey man, what case are you using on your iPhone? it really looks great.
I'd love to see the video about if the iPad Pro can replace your laptop.
I would like that
Can I get IOS 11 on my iphone6S!???
What's your screen protector?
I heard the iphone 8 and iOS 11 is awesome, oh, finally, it's catching up to S6...
IPhone are behind on releasing tech and features but for some reason everyone thinks it's the greatest stuff.     They are about to release the iPhone x with wireless charging and it's in the news papers like it's an original thing.  Samsung have been doing wireless charging since the s6.   Wtf....
I wish iPhone 8 would make a bundle for those deaf people with a Cochlear Implant with a Nucleus 6 or lower. That would be a badass upgrade.
are all those features coming to iphone 6 plus as well?,i know the update is compatible with iphone 6 plus but i don't if it may be limited by hardware on some features.
LOL FINALLY GET A FILE EXPLORER BUT A SHIT ONE
Samsung is having the last laugh they pretty much have all of samsung hardware
hey where do you get your iPhone wallpapers from?
Dude iPhone is so late on this features android been doing for years
Android has done it before ...
Anyone know where the posters in the background are from?
In other words make it more like android which is better
Now, with new features, you too can support modern-day slavery!\nThink Different\nTell me what your justification is in the comments below!
I think the iPad is slowly turning into a computer
CooooooooooL . Can we drag and drop in iphone 7+ ?
you GOTTA make the replace a laptop video - thats my no. 1 question!!
Did you switch back from the Galaxy s8?
people dont realize that its the little things that count
Anything that allows us to customize and give a little bit more freedom, I'm up for it.\n\n\nTHEN SWITCH TO ANDROID..........
I'd love to see an iPad pro vs laptop video
I thought there was gonna be new features and these features are taken from android smh
Stuff that iPhone are coming out with andriod had that ages ago. And iphones are rip of just paying more for a bigger screen. I use to be a apple fan but when Steve jobs passed away they just went shit and ran out of ideas
Tbh apple is better because it's more simple. I recently got an android and it took me forever to get cellar data on
My droid is better then any iPhone
I've been here since 500K
I think the way youtubers talk at their audience is cringe.
I really want there to be a feature where you can download apps to record things your doing on your phone. They only have them on other types of phones but not for iOS devices. You can use hacks to download the apps but it will only let you for one minute. They should make it so it Doesn't show your battery percentage or time for privacy purposes. And so it is long than one minute.
Can people just get android already? Lol we've been waiting for customisability... I sure haven't ...
The document scanning (if it works correctly) will be great. Big day tomorrow for Apple!! btw 5203 notifications??? I'd pass-out with that many notifications pending. LOL. Great Video. :-)
I'm not an Apple user and probably will never be one, but chapeau to Apple that they've turned their iPads into Mini-iMacs with iOS 11.
Damn! Can you be my average gay daddy!? Lmao you so fine I mean cmon its gonna be a grapefruit night for you all the time 😍 #iFinnahavewetdreamstonight
My friend has that update
Wow, apple devices getting features android has had for years... I can't wait to see the excitement on my apple friends faces...
When is iOS 11 gonna be released? Btw keep up the good work!
Oh NO WAY! So the new features are just simple things samsung have been using since 2010. That is great;)
so apple stole google docs...hmmmm very original apple lol
Been on Android for a while. Might give Apple 1 more chance.

I already have it lol 😂
IOS 11 is ugly ! I'm staying at 10.3.3
Can I get your wallpaper at 0:36? 😄😄
im most excited for a built in screen recorder, what do you think of it ?

Animated emoji's only for iPhone X or edition with face ID
So nothing unique/innovative as usual, cool
Please make a video about an iPad Pro replacing your laptop, I want to see which one is better for me based on your feedback. Thanks!! 🙌
Haha jokes on you ppl I have iOS 11 already
I have it already hmu if u want it right away fam
new sub! been watching for a while now tho. love those day in the life videos, keep up the great work.
My friend had the beta of this. The next day his phone broke. We told him he should've waited
I definitely think a video on whether or not the iPad Pro can replace your laptop would be a great idea. The current generation was fairly close to replacing my laptop for classroom purposes, but I still needed my laptop most of the time. Maybe the new variation will be closer to replacing a laptop completely!
Feature 1 after buying your wallet is empty like the clean water in africa
I actually have the beta and it freezes so much
I want that video
I think it's great that IOS & Android are pushing new features to better our phone/tablet experiences.
Cool, but my android can do 80% of this already.
Can't wait to see this movie..I've just been consumed by Destiny lol
What a pity that you guys can't help but let your leftist ideology slip through the cracks.
song at the end
Nothing solidify's a good friendship like a seven way gangbang, in a filthy sewer from hell.  It would of been awesome if Bev's Dad walked in on them. That was clearly his biggest fear. Those kids would have bigger problems then that clown.
Now I know why my grandparents wont let me read the book till I'm older..... My mom hasn't read it and she says I can but I think Ill wait
i loved the miniseries so much
I'd like to see you talk about the new movie. It seemed to me that some of the characters were given much smaller roles and only a handful are important.
so how the fuck do i get into the losers club where do i sign?
racial insensitivity when talking about Richies jokes... times were different, people werent uptight like they are now.
Mike DOES find a picture of Georgie in the book. It's just in a different location and under different circumstances. Bill mentions it being the picture that went missing from Georgie's photo album.
Space Turtle and Underage gang bang.\n\nStephen King and his coauthor: Meth.
Oh shit she fucks them one after the other? Lmfao yo wtf
The old it was way creepier than the new one. The new it is definitely more entertaining however
So the kids had an orgy
there is a book, and you do the whole remake thing, meh
9:14-9:45\nWhat the hell, King?
war of the worlds and war of the worlds ( 2005 )
been waiting for this
Do an IT trailer
Thank you guys for doing Blade Runner/Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep What's The Difference next, I'm super excited now!
I miss John Ritter and Jonathan Brandis
I got to read the book
the ONLY reason i  disliked it is because i could be the 1000th dislike otherwise i would like it
If Stranger Things had started out as a Stephen King novel, when Eleven started to undress in front of the boys instead of stopping her they would have let her get naked, then gotten naked themselves, took turns having sex with Eleven, and because they had sex with her the boys would have gained their own psychic powers. Also Dr. Brenner would make it clear that once Eleven hit puberty he planned on impregnating her personally the old fashioned way to see if her powers could be passed on genetically.
teeth are sooooo ugly and disgusting but not scary 😂
tl:dw In movie kids don't fuck in the sewer
*I hate these douchebags that say the it movie free in the comments*
Yeah, an interdimensional daemon with unknown origins but he just scare and kill children for fun.
Steven King, why don't you take a seat.
Be gone thot
Narnia next please......
Local assholes 😂
CARRIE,  CARRIE,  CARRIE
Tim Curry's Performance Gave Me Chills!
👌👌👌👌
Now do the mini-series VS the movie. xD
never have that woman again please.
Really interested if you all are going to look at the 2017 not-John-Hughes IT.
Why do the Beverley in the 2017 vers. have sex with all the boys in the group? That's so DISGUSTING AND VILE that a image of pre-teen GANGBANG just conjured up in my mind. Did the reviewers said they all had sex in the sewers? That just made it WORSE for me now. I gotta to get this out my mind, probably going to watch the original movie again.
good intentions\nbut seems a bit dumbed down...
Due to budget issues they had to leave to letters out of the title.
They did mike hanlon so bogus in the new movie
Would you like it in alphabetical order????
Who is this chick? Fuck she ruins what was going to be an incredible episode. I genuinely can't tell if she's trying to do a Pennywise high-pitched clown voice for comedic purposes or if that's her actual voice. Either way, she's got a voice for modeling.
Seeing the old clips it seems they even brought back the odd lip-syncing for Pennywise, as if the lines were added later. Dunno if that's supposed to be intentional for both movies since It's a cosmic horror, but...
IT is not a demon, but a cosmic being or eldritch abomination like Cthulhu or Gozer from Ghostbusters.
Wtf is up with this comment section? It's all broken english.
Why does old Bill from 1990's Stephan King's It look like Sam from Supernatural?
how the hell do you smell silver???
You should do this again with the new movie
i love this movie
Stephen King is planning to do a book signing of IT at Comet Ping Pong.
It's a beautiful Tim Curry out toda-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
Buttom line... Stephen King can be pretty fucked up to put it mildly.
So basically Penywise is just an excuse for Stephen King to write a book about child sex and gore? I'm... starting to think maybe this guy isn't someone I should respect. \nWhatever a writer writes about, the subject matter can be inspired, but ultimately the content of the book is a revealing insight into the mind of the writer... Which means he was writing about 12 year old children having sex, in great detail... he actually planned that shit in advance. \n\nI wonder how many other famous pop culture icons are secretly pedos and  serial kilers. A hell of a lot more than we would think is probably the answer.
CAN YOU PLZ DO A HOMEMADE IT TRAILER!?
Did you legit just say Steven and not Stephen?
Wanna fix a problem? Have sex with all of your friends! That's a good idea... right?
I don't remember the spider part
Something, something, kid gang bang, something, something, bad.   Now give me your likes! Everyone else is doing it.
9:33 are we gonna ignore the fact that Stephen King as a grown man made a decision to include a group a 12 year olds running a train on another 12 year old girl even though he could've written literally anything else in the story to symbolize that they loved each other
Best Pennywise line - \n\nKiss me fat boy!
Adultery/underage fornication/ the disgusting etc isn't loving.. who taught these kids? Satan?
What's the plural of medium?
10:10 *what can Stephen King cut with a 1,000 degree knife?!?!?1!?1?!?!!?1?!?*
Correction: It were THREE bullies that were involved with throwing the homosexual man over the bridge.
...And this is why I've never felt inclined to pick up one of his novels. Yeah, they're LONG books... but people don't read books just to say they've carried around a giant weight with words inside and looked at them all. The book trailer or little blurb won't win you over unless you are a die-hard horror fan, maybe. When it comes to what you hear about them outside of that? They sound dull, gross, and pretentious at the same time. I don't see the appeal.
9:47 Wasn't it Bill who initiated this?
tim is the only reason this thing was scary
I understand that Stephen King is supposed to be a genius and all but you have to be a really sick fuck to write about children fucking each other
Tip; drop all the dumb leftie crap like 'm-muh racial insensitivity' and similar.
The difference to me.... The first was awesome with great acting. The second was lame, not scary at all & Pennywise wasn't half the clown Tim Curry was. Why choose a pretty boy to play what was suppose to be such a scary part? IT from the 90s wins, hands down! Very disappointed in this new one.
pennywise isn't a demon, he is  a sickness brought on by the breaking of the beams and the assault on the dark tower by the Crimson King
I liked the older one more.\nJust seemed like the story was easier to follow.
Please do I Know What You Did Last Summer the book is not even a slasher like the movie and they're remaking it although the director said he won't be making something closer to the book it's going to be all new so my question is why?
the dead kid and the picture of Georgie is pretty much like this in the book. The 85 murders begin and then as Mike builds up the evidence to be sure to call his paws one of the things that makes him certain that it's It they are dealing with is the picture of Georgie that disappeared in 58 after it winked at bill
I have never seen a Youtube channel that has more bots spamming it that CineFix.
Here's a fun fact:  The kid playing young Richie is Seth Green, known for his voice acting on Robot Chicken.  So voices are his game now.
I don't remember Stan brutally chopping himself up in the book.  It's been about five years since I read the book.  Anybody want to fill me in on what happened if I'm wrong?
I wish they kept the them running a train part from the books in the new adaption.
Fucking hell, what an annoying ass video. Those narrator/ presenters are awful.
13:01 HAHAHAHAHA WTF?? I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT PART AND IM GLAD I DID NOW
With the notable exception of Carrie the only really good adaptations of Stephen King's novels are the non-supernatural ones.
Based on the mini series, IT's powers seem to be based in subjective or perceived reality. The silver works because they know it works, the asthma inhaler works when they are kids when he thinks it's acid, then as an adult when he knows its mostly water it doesn't work.\n\nA similar system was actively used by the citizens of Elm St in Freddy vs. Jason. The people suppressed all knowledge of Freddy and his killings and eventually that stripped him of his powers. I don't know if it was an intentional reference to IT though.
METAPHOR......SURE!
Being scared of clowns is actually a pretty new fear. From about the 2000s and mostly in the US.
WAHA WAHA

I miss cassy redmen
Woah, MARTHA?
Big misconception that the miniseries also takes place in 1958. As with the current film it was moved forward a bit, though not as drastically. Book is 1958 - 1985 and the miniseries is 1960 - 1990.
Everyone is like child orgy is bad and I'm just sitting here going... Back in my day, 12 year olds were blowing each other on the school bus (when i was 12). It was a major problem. Is it still?
I've never read the book, but I keep hearing about this Orgy at the end of the book.......... Did they all just take turns fucking the girl or something? How did that even come about? I'm a busy man and don't have time to read the book, it would be helpful if someone could fill me in.
The Langoliers than? Please!!!!!
DO DEATHNOTE NEXT!     ANIME VS MANGA
So the only female in the club in the book is a slut. I mean sure the sex orgy was a bonding ritual, but essentially the girl banged more than one boy. Worse in one sequence: one after the other. How did she not get pregnant?
Wow this as too real to me and my family..
A different race?are you sure one of them is not alien?one of them is having a different skin colour and your calling them a different races,pathetic
THIS SHOW IS SO LIT BRAH
Sarcasm Now Served all Day my theatre teacher has that frame😂 7:53
You know you are a good actress when everyone hates you
Try doing it in Asian countries. Especially east and southeast asian countries. No one will stand up.
:-( this video dont have possibile subtitle and for me is very hard understand all. :-(
i feel bad for the 1st lady :(
Ohhhhh, flip the roles, African American Mom, Caucasian child
These are some of the best responses I've seen yet from bystanders on this show.  Sometimes people get way too angry too easily instead of keeping calm or cool; sometimes really lame-o arguments are used.  None of that here.  People only got mad when they'd been pushed to their limit.  All the advice they gave was stellar.  I loved and wanted to thank ALL of the bystanders here.  From the grandpas to the teenagers.
I love this lady that argued with the lady that asked the question
That bitch is dam race i would FUCK HER UP am black
I'm surprised the onlooker wasn't Traci
Send missiles to blow them up
I just ask questions! I just ask questions! \nI'm sorry but I had to laugh at that 😂\n\n\n\nplease don't hate me...  😣
oh hey look, they didn't use Traci this time.
i has the same headphones as the little girlll TWINSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The child is so cute
You guys should do one episode of racism towards Mexicans especially with the DACA going around
I wonder if we'd get the same reaction with a man and boy
They're a cute family <3
Ugh I flipping hate racist people *-.-* I Would Never Ever Do That ;-;  I have different kind of friends but I would never..
Wtf, lady? This isn't the 50s. Get your racist ass out of there.
Watching this during all the protests smh
Plz don't ever do this in my town ...I would punch this bitch immediately and then get sued by ABC
That's sad poor little girl  lol it doesn't matter Jesus made us all  equal
That moment when the child always uses her iPad when everything is happening
There are still good people in the world.
I have the same headphones as the little gurl
This made me cry
Amen! That grandfather said it better than I could ever say it!
being from nc she wouldnt have grilled that woman like that in front of people like myself and others.  we take care of our own
Lol omg the little girl has the same headphones as me xD
PREACH!!!!\nPRAYS THE LORDS IN DIFFERENT\nRACES! THE WORLD CHANGING WE DONT NEED RACISM IN OUR LIVES!!! LETS PRAY JESUS AND THE GODS!!!!!
this gives me faith in humanity💗
The girl that asked the question  is  reases
This has honestly happened before, I'm white and my blood related dad is black, I'm glad to see someone doing something about this.
Grandma in the corner xanned the fuck out
The little kid is so cuteeeee
Some of the ppl at my fucking school was bullying bc my mom was not black and my dad was  damn good thing i had friends to
Should've put Traci as the evil bitch....
black people has black wife's and black husband same as whites why judge please why this breaks my heart 💔💔😔
Morgan is the best actor ever
Seriously ITS JUST THE FRIKEN TONE OF SKIN
THOSE WORDS  no... she gave a home to a child for people who couldn't take care of her
Tbh I feel like no one really cares about race anymore.Aren't we all even?Most of the time.
The little girl in the thumbnail is my reaction the whole video even though I knew it was fake.
I would have punched a bitch worse case.  normal I would have cussed at her the ladies at the beginning were so freaking nice
The African American actress was my acting teacher. Her name is Jazelle and she is so sweet and kind and funny. I love her so much. I really miss her too. She works at Barbizon acting classes and I loved it there.
That is no fair I have a friend that is black and has white parents
This is the only WWYD that i have to diagree with...tis my opinion thats all
The actress Rachel if I would be the same donee there would be hell
I would kill that lady
4:33 this man reminds me of my grandpa, he'd be calm and kind in any situation, and i miss him so damn much.
Who would dislike this.this is important either black/white/Chinese/Japan and anyone else skin color or not it's not ok to do this I love that people do care and do know not to jugde this is wat everyone should be like rescue every baby these people that r like black life's matter I'm black one,two its every life matters and if u agree like to get this out there I love everyone but everyone might not love me if their and nobody loves u I do everybody keep that in mind please
okay but can we talk about how cute the little girl is
If someone ever came out the mouth like that at me, especially in the presence of my child I would probably blindly knock them the fuck out. Like no control whatsoever.
This made me cry knowing that racism is still an issue, but is slowly but surely going away
I have the same headphones as the little girl
Ya know the DNA doesn't matter it's the love that matters
They should do tutor hits  child well  the child's parent are at home.
People should stop being so inherent
i just imagined the kid watching some WWYD
Besides anything, black baby does not have to eb adopted to have a white mom. :)
I wouldn't care if i,or a friend of mine adopted a African-American child.it doesn't matter what what color the child is,it's what comes from the heart,and the love your giving the child. That's what really matters\n  So all the to the hatters,look at the child's feelings instead of the color ****h.
If I witness this i would just walk up to the onlookers and punch them idk if they will beat me afterwards
Morgan has the same head phones as me
This is really sad. i am adopted from Ecuador and my parents are Caucasian. I came here in 1997 and many people had things to say or gave my parents disgusted looks when they would go out in public with me. Even to this day if I go out to lunch with my father, people give us weird looks. It's disgusting.
I get tears in my eyes....
I live in north Carolina
STOP GIVING RACE TO THEM. I HAVE A WHITE MOM. AND NOBODY BEe'S RESIST TO ME THEY QUESTION ME BUT NOT LIKE HER.                  P.S I know this is fake BUT STILL STOP IT GET SOME HELP
She just looks at the kid and the kid looks ar her 😂😂😂😂
How do you become a WWYD actress like Ava?
Someone starting cutting onions in my house around 2:00
Onlooker:You're White,She's Black.\nMe:And You Are A Racist Prick.
It's funny cause the villain actually looks like some white trash that would actually say that in real life lol
I know she's an actress but hearing the word black as she looks at mommy's face was too much for me!!!😭
Tbh I would stay quiet, then after a few minutes..\n\nSTFU WOMAN YOU--
I really love this episode
Bless that women who was in the 60's it doesent matter what colour u are it mater how u are as a person this should not happen in the world
I would like to see one in reverse like instead of a white mom and a black kid a white kid and a black mom, like if you agree!
Bitch i throw my juice in your eyes and karate chop u in da stomach
They should've changed the mom as a black woman and the child as white
As a half black and half white person raised by a white mother i can't even count how many times things like this has happened

Ed Sheeran is the best mate we all wish we had. Really glad he didn't die in a volcano.
This upload is very random
At 6:41 Matthew's lack of reaction is what I aim for in life :P
Ed looks like a is a cool dude to hangout with.
Matthew McConoughey's awfully quiet
6:41-6:46 look at the reaction of everyone and there's Matthew just sitting there like a boss...
Anyone know when the next series starts?
a date putting up a lego set???...  I mean it would be the BEST DATE EVER!!!!!
His friend James is cute
Graham's show is by far the best chat show ever!
That lego story is just what I would do if I got a lot of money XD
THIS IS WHY I LOVE HIM
And suddenly he's on national television, shaking hands with Matthew McConoughey, Chistina Ricci and Josh Widdicombe. Must have been quite a night...
He's so funny
I've just cried and sobbed for hours after an unfortunate event and I just came here to level up my mood and once again I laughed and forgot all my troubles for a while. Thank you for the upload❤
He's such an honest, genuine bloke. I wish there were more like him. Great role model for our youth.
Put my foot in a boiling geezer Sounds like a bar fight in Manchester
What I've learned is that Ed is a rebel or don't know how to take instructions LOL.  He should watch Keanu's interview here on Graham about that motorcycle accident and learn from the master.
ed and matthew... what more could i ask for
HELSINKI
If anyone had brought on a Lego set on a date before I'd met the husband he'd have never had a chance.
I love him
Ohhh plssss stop uploading old clips and start the new season already
Why, oh WHY?  Can't we get good TV like this in the States?  [Sad Face]
I love Ed Sheeran.  His songs, but also the fact that he's such a down-to-earth person.  However the Graham Norton show episode I'm enthusiastically waiting for is the one where the Star Wars cast will be on here promoting The Last Jedi in December 🙌🙌
Christina feels so out of place :/\nNo one allows her to talk.
Apparently he made up that whole sword story. Funny but weird thing to do. According to James Blunt anyways.
Ok but how does Ed look younger than before
'Don't do that!'\nEd: 'Why?'\n*Does thing anyway*\n*Sees why*

The guy on the far right is very annoying....
LMAO Ed asking Why? while doing what they're specifically telling him not to do
LOL ed when he's like I don't have my specs on
So when Ed doesn't have glasses on how doesn't wear contacts? He performs without glasses so I cant imagine he does that foggy.
Ed is such a pure and genuine soul. I love him.
This is from ages ago right?
When's the Mathew M interview.
This is the best XD eddy BOI got reunited with his mate that's so sweet

He sucked in GOT
I thought he was American since when he sings like an ordinary person from the USA but I guess he's just like a Adele who is from England but doesn't sing like she is from there
I still don't know who this Ed Sheeran guy is.
Hope u get sir Andy Murray on ur great show ASP

no one's gonna say it? alrighty, i'll say it.\nGOD, HE'S UGLY. lmao.\n\ni love his songs, tho.
the tinnitus noise at 1:05 was toooo loud compared to the rest of the video, RIP HEADPHONE USERS
With 'Levels', he leveled up. Worked Out 'the days' and 'the nights'. 'Hey brother', you 'woke me up' and became 'a friend of mine'. Now I am 'feeling good' and 'waiting for love'. 'You be love.' 'Without you', I wouldn't be as inspired as I am today. You made me a 'true believer' and wear 'heart upon my sleeve'. We can fix the 'broken arrows' 'for a better day'. 'Pure grinding' is what we need to do to 'taste the feelings' of 'success.'  'Superlove' for you. 'Gotta love ya.' <3
all i can say....woah amazing :) everytime I Watch him  i feel so inspired  to go working on music, just amazing what he has accomplished and the new tracks he has made are AMAZING :)\nIf you guys want similar music i make same style music would be amazing to hear what you guys think :)
In all honesty, this might be one of the greater productions this year. Like if you CANNOT wait 🙏🏻
I wish I could hear Levels again for the first time.

Will it be in Spain too? Because I think it will be my favourite film lol.
Please Avicii make a comeback to melodic progressive house :) !
I'm so excited about this movie Tim !! Already bought ticket 😍😍
I never got to see you !!! I just came to leave to USA 2 years ago and my dream was to see you live. I hope one day you can go on tour again and maybe dial it down a bit for the places to go and get more rest between shows. I hope for your best
He just needs more money thats all
best EDM artist in the universe True Story <3 ◢ ◤
i have to see this
I love you Tim
He's doing this as Bach, did what he did Sooooo he has no clue what Bach did
Hhoollllyyy ssshhhitt!!!!!!
Cryvichhi not worth it, always follow what others do. Copyright song together martin garrix take the credits only. Cancel full tour and some festivals cause hes a drug addict / alcoholic and say it was to much. Want some attention. Stop playing drama and shut the doors in music industry and get a gf and family
These days everyone has to have some kind of movie/documentary of their own,fuck me man.....
Its my bday on 26th Oct....And my gift is ready....a grand gift....
Hope these talented artists make the brightest COLORS!
https://youtu.be/64vWZsZ-Duk\nCheck out this track
The funny part is that people dont realize that 'True', 'Stories' are his  only two albums.
what wrong with your health #avicii ? i am concerned.
Will it be played in indonesia?
Will it be possible to watch in germany? Would like to, since you had done no last gig in germany :( Its a pity for me, that i had no possibility to see you one last time, so the movie would be a good compromise :)
OMG!!! I need It now 😱😍
This is a must watch!
0:18 That awesome lead layering.. Avicii the king of layering

Finally we've got the release date!!! Yay!

Always wanted to know more about you, now it's the time
Really cool to see what happened behind the scenes of all the madness, been listening since 2009, excited to see it!
This is the movie... No one wants to Miss :D :D :D :D :D

This is a wonderful project, I'm glad there are wonderful people out there dedicated to reforming the high school education system! Looking forward to what you have in store for the future!
When they said Geoffrey Canada I got so hyped up. I go to the school program he created. I met him in person and he is really cool. I'm glad I'm in one of his best schools too.
Tom Hanks is the perfect human being.
Lets go Titans!!!!
Beautiful and Inspiring Message that is over due and well needed no matter who Delivers it something has to change for sure!
Thank you for caring about our schools and other issues.
when she said this is me....I knew what she meant I knew exactly about that painful release....I'm so glad it's over J you are free! now Slay like you do!!!!!!!
Heartbreaking to see her break down. The song must have incredibly personal layers to it, all the more now than before.
She sounds like Michael.
Thanks sooo much for uploading. Can't wait to see her in Dec
I felt that and cried with her. I love you Janet!!!
Wait what....did she say this is me at the end!???
WE LOVE U JANET. IT'S GONNA BE OK.
Wow!! I was getting emotional too. I felt her pain.
Respect to Mrs. Jackson for being so honest and showing she is only human.\nLove her!
I commend her for leaving that toxic marriage. 🖕Domestic violence
Oh yeah Queen Janet spilled tea by adding this song to the set list...Wissam if I ever see you, you gon get these hands, you evil muthafucka! Glad she got out of it with the baby she's always wanted and MEGA coins to boot!!!
Her ex husband beating her at every stage of her marriage, i.e. The different shape of the girls body. She had the courage to break the cycle. Her life with him in song.
Janet has so many great unreleased tracks that she could release a greatest hits album of them, and this would be in the top 3 songs that she never officially released.  Trust a Try, Enjoy, and This Body that Loves You are 3 others she should have released.
Thanks Janet for showing love to Htown. Florida gone need some love too. Stay blessed!
It gone be alright trust God Janet he will keep you .
It's an emotional song already and add her raw emotions to it only intensified the pain. Her brother Randy has said her husband was emotionally abusive, I guess she couldn't hold it in. You're Free now Ms. Jackson ♡
am I the only person hearing echo of MJ in her voice? The crying part? Too much is going on in her life: very hormonal: she's a 1st time and new mom at age 50!...Motherhood can wreck your emotions up to 1yr after giving birth....+divorce + gruesome schedules of a world tour! Real shit!\n❤❤❤❤ to you Janet , in my humble opinion her #1 priority: take GOOD CARE of yourself! Fame and money are secondary....
Loud & clear! Sometimes verbal & emotional abuse can cause more damage than physical. Though a beautiful child came from this union, it's even more heartbreaking knowing that one is tied to the other person for life. There is a God & He sees everything. Much Love Janet & understanding.
Damn 😪 I'm glad she was strong enough to walk away.
Yes Janet get the messages out
It's going to be alright love God got u,I jus read what Randy wrote about this moment she going through it I love u Janet God gets the last word u will come out bigger and better 🙏🙏🙏🙏💜💜💜💜
It hurts my heart to see her break down and cry. I truly understand her pain of having to divorce a man you truly cared about. She's my Sheroe... she's human too...we all go through things....
I am so sorry Janet, You will be back in love soon with Me
I wonder whether she has postpartum depression
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NEVER 😞KAY! FREE YOSLF QUEEN JANICE JACKSON! SANG THRU THE PAIN SISTAH, RELEASE ALL OF IT & U ARE NOT ANYONE'S DORMAT!❤💖💓💗💜   I'M GLAD 2 👀 U DOING WHAT U WORKED HARD 4 & YOSECOND LOVE PERFORMING, I BELIEVE YO1ST LOVE IS YO BABYBOI WHO LOVES U UNCONDITIONALLY! ❤🌟💃💙
I hope the guy she threw done on the ground is ok lol.
did she make this with her first husband
I totally felt this pain!
4:07 So sad. Touched my heart. We love you Janet.
He had her dressed up like Batman all that time with his sick ass
💜💯
December 17, Atlanta , Phillips Arena  ( Her  FINAL  stop  on  37  city  tour !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! )
Everytime I see this video and hear this song I cry.  The performance is electrifying....
U R the Queen Of POP Ms. Jackson
This song was on The Velvet Rope album so it came out in like, '97.
She left him ,good now her son won't see that shit happen to his Momma!Love you Janet.You are totally doing the right thing!I was with a man that broke my nose ,and pulled me by the hair just to slam my head on floor gave me a concussion! Worst time of my life .So when I seen this  brought me back.I started tearing up too cause I know.Thank you Janet for showing me that I am NOT alone.Much love!(I am no longer with him)
Unbelievable ❤️
💚🤦🏼‍♀️
I'm crying too omg
Wow amazing! We love you Janet. So powerful! #janfam #jtribe
leave that demon alone. #Nocontact
Bravo Janet Jackson
Very touching subject. happens too often to many women.
Men are victims of abuse too. Problem is, our gynocentric, man-hating, feminist society prefers catering to the issues and needs of girls and women, while routinely overlooking/ignoring/pooh-pooing the issues boys and men are plauged with. In case you weren't aware, the male homeless and suicide rate is FAR higher than it is for women, and 40% of the victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault are men. This goes for both gay and straight men.
Can't wait to see her November 16th.
OH MY GOD FUCKING ROAST ME QUEEN!!!! YES!!
why do I feel like she tries to act like pewidiepie and jenna marbles combined into? only this is a 100x more annoying... I'm disappointed in the internet for making her a popular and relevant youtuber.... same goes for jake and logan paul
Only Christine would make a video like this 😂❤️❤️.
Some people in my class have holo books and i want but i am to awkward to ask where they got them from \n\nAlso i wonder if you could put that holo powder on pencils lol
I'd like to see some um...nails. If that's not too much to ask. Just kidding who actually comes on here for nails anymore, I'm here for the SAVAGE ROASTS!
What has liza done to you 😢😢😢😭😭😭
You and Ben need to start a prank war and record it !
Cristine is like a Canadian female pewdiepie
Bahd bahibe is a utuber and she would be a dope colab
SHE CALLED CONNOR FRANTA MALCOM IN THE MIDDLE OH MY GOD IM SO DEAD 😂😂😂
C: Hey its Dan or Phil\nOverly Phandom Members: CHRISTINE ITS DANIEL! OKAY CATCH UP
This is the content I came for
It's videos like this that make me feel bad for Ben.
I'm not a doctor or anything but my brother has eczema and the only thing that's worked for him has been the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream
Christine! Do a review of the Ciate London Lip Flip lipsticks, none of the reviews say if they're holo or just sparkles. We NEED TO KNOW!!\nhttps://youtu.be/fbg91NTQ1-E
The gabby show 😭😭😭 I heard you gotta nose job couldn't fix your nails why they were at it ..bitch😂😂😂😂
That's fucked up yea its just a joke but Logan is color blind not cool
•Holographic solar eclipse nails.. \n•Or holographic moon phases.. same shit.\n•Recreate Nikki tutorials' nails. \n•Linear Holographic stamping on glitter holo, with a holo taco... \n• holo water marble 😈\n• gelly marble over holo  \n• holo French manicure\n• holo geode inspired drag marble nails\n• holo peel off base coat\nHolo can you go... do the have magnet reactive holo? Like the nail polish that you held the magnet over and it would make the weird design? I can't think of any other ideas right now lol
Ben should do a challenge where he picks a nail from her peely bag and tries to re-create it.
I need a serie of this who else?
U SLAAAAYEDDD IT. I was watching this in class and going OHHHHHHH the whole time and my friends actually thought I was going insane 😂
I still never got a reply about simplynaillogical2 and I am a huge fan but I love Joey so much and plz don't Mack fun of hem on your Channel please
Do a nail tutorial of painting Ben's face DO IT  PLZ  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW I LOVE UR CHANNEL
You should totally do a wish.com haul of nail stuff!
Try to make holographic gems on your nails. I'd be disappointed if you think you can't.
I was laughing so hard when she said this...\n''Nerdy Nummi's…More like Nubies''
Do celebrities next, wanna see what you say about them Cristine
Today I noticed that I didnt see anymore videos from you on my page. So I searched you and it turned out i was unsuscribed. I didnt unsuscribe. Weird.
Dan always crys cause his life and self doubt xD
You should do a HOLO fairy garden with nail polish!!!!
You should make glow in the dark nails again
Does anybody remember when she made nail videos because I don't ( OHHHH ROASTED) 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I didn't mean that I love you
Hypoallergenic makeup is pretty interesting to work with on its own. I'm allergic to pretty much everything, so I'd appreciate more makeup tutorials and things that used products I could actually buy.
Cristine can you add me on snapchat my username is unicorn udder
ALERT⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ I FOUND FUCKING HOLO MAKEUP 💿💿 IT'S ONE IF THE NYX PIGMENT THINGS BUT THERE IS A FUCKING HOLO ONE💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿

Cristine!!!!!! I just found out we have the same birthday!!! Its the greatest thing about me now... 😂
WHEN SHE SAID OR PHIL I WANTED TO SCREAM SO LOUDLY
Ok I think that's enough
You should do Ben's make-up next. I mean... you already painted his nails, so what's the next logical step? 😂
The fact that you're using inside jokes from the youtubers themselves to roast them makes me so happy
Put logan in the thumbnail; 8million subs
is that Malcom in the middle IM CRYING
She didn't do Danielle brogoli because she might have got roasted her self
Simply u should do a clab with Karina Garcia
How did she not include!! Pewdiepie?? Like if you want a part two!!!🙋🏻
I saw and dan and I was ready for this roast.\n\nYour nails are busted from all the crafting, you should have been crying about your ugly **** nails\n\nI cried, this is amazing
I hope this turns into a tag
You should show us a video of your raw footage (unedited footage) love youuuuuu
I love pretty much love all of them and I should be shook but the ROASTED afterwards I can't be mad
Wait is marbles dead???

Video idea: getting your nails done at a salon
I saw the title,and really hoped for Dan Howell(and no,I didn't see the thumbnail)\n(EDIT:The Dan Diss was all I was hoping for)
Is it weird that I want you to roast my nails?  Like if you agree
You should try the Num Noms nail polish maker! It is new on tv and since you have tried lots of of crappy kid toys, why not try another!
Hey it's Dan... or phil...?

No Leafy? Dislike!
When I die. I want to come back as a killer whale.
Hey we should put those killer whales in tanks and swim with them!
This is why you don't get in the water with killer whales.  They aren't your friend.
I know the history of the name Killer Whale but I think we should name them by their scientific name; Orca. Orcas are beautiful creatures and mean no harm to humans. I know as I have dived with them on many occasions in New Zealand, Norway and the UK. The name Killed Whale strikes fear and makes people think of them as destructive murderers when really they're benevolent and only hunt specifically.
One of the best footages of 2017
Christ Almighty, they're not whales, they're orca or giants of the dolphin genre.
and the PG BBC strikes again
It's really annoying that the killer whales seemingly never fail. I'd like to see something get away for once lol
That's what Trump wants to do to the Mexicans, Black's, Jewish, Women, Muslims, and non-racist Americans
The feminist killers be wantin' the same size dorsal fin as the males.
Don't worry Guys, the killer whales are only doing scientific research
Seagulls and sea birds should be referred to as sea vultures
This video edit sucks!\n\n Were are the Ariel shots???
I'm more concerned on how cold the water is
where were the mikne crew?
If I was the minke I was stop and go for the male 1v1 me broooooo
Evil exists in nature, who creatures nature is god, so god is evil
Humans are the only predator who roots for the underdog.  All other predators kill and eat the underdog.  Just so you know, we got empathy along with religion, music, a few other things about 80,000 years ago.  Without it, uncle jon with the broken leg wouldn't be helped-who in turn helped back when the leg healed.
Very good footage, especialy for me, that loves Cetaceans. They are just M A J E S T I C .I cant even have a favorite species.. \nAll cetaceans are cool on their own way: \n\nOrcas are Huge predators but wont prey on humans for some reason.\nBowheads can live up to 200 years and they live on cold polar waters.\nBlue Whales are the biggest animal that ever lived and its vocalization is deafening.\nSperm whales can dive very deep to search for food, sleep verticaly and use sonar to see when there is no light.\nHumpbacks jump over the water, dance with its mate and have the most beautiful vocalization, almost like singing.\nThe List Goes On...\n\nCetaceans are something special.
Where are Paul Watson and the Sea Shepard when you need them?
Why dont they bite it to death instead of racing for 2 hours?
This commentator can give life to a standing still vase on kitchen table !! 👌
Why doesn't the Minke whale dive deep?
You know what they say, the bigger the dorsal fin..
What a happy ending!
i dont blame them. having lived with innuits and eaten minke.....\nits like beef of the ocean. so tender though...\n\nseriously its like red meat but as soft as fish.... innuits eat the fat too... that just tastes like fishy greasy fat.\n\nbut the meat? 10/10. im with the killers on this 1
Who saw those sea creatures at 2:01
Way cool
4:36 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, Minke!!!!!!!! -_-.
I wish Japanese ate killerwhales 🇯🇵
It's the circleeee of LIIIIIIIFE
The fact you hear that final blow crash like that the power is amazing
Why don't rorqual whales dive to escape predation by orcas?
Nature is a real f.  The Minke gave it a run.
HUMANS R SO EVIL!!1!!!!1!!11
For me Sir David Attenborough 😎👍🇬🇧🌴🐪👀🍨⛳️️
I really like your videos, but would be nice if they would have subtitles, English subtitles I mean. Thank you.
Forget Shark Week... there needs to be a Killer Whale week!!!!
Killer Whale is a perversion of Whale Killer
Orcas have big jaws with large teeth yet they don't initiate their attack with bites, i guess that's because they don't have claws to grab their prey or pin them down like big cats.  Water is just air, and ocean mammals are quite slippery too, or maybe orcas are gentlemen and ladies, they don't want to dine like thugs like hyenas lol.
The wolfs of the sea🤘🏼
Oh Minke, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Minke!
tear...for the minki
thats a bad way to go. RIP Minke
MashAllah
4:12 that rainbow tho
Nice video ❤️🤗😍💋🤗❤️❤️
Lol those two penguins/seals at 2:00
Absolutely beautiful...
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
ohh poor Minkie 😔

It's amazing. Killer Whales are truly the apex predators of the sea, because they have no natural predators (not including humans). They are so intelligent, and are even more intelligent than our own dogs and even some apes. \n\nSad that we have to imprison them in asylums for our entertainment.
The way orcas hunt is scary but  it's an incredible footage. Circle of life.😑
Finally Type A Orca get some recognition
Where is the under water cam when you need one
Does your minky have a license?
Orcas literally operate in gangs and jump other whales. Break yo self!
2:06 - 2:12 When everybody goes to the gorge on Karelia in War Thunder Ground Forces
well, you know what they say about whales with big fins...
Could you see a Rainbow 4:13 ? 😲😵\nOn the left side
Beautiful. I love when animals act like animals. Now if we can just get people to be more human; that's would be worth a 5min video.
I ❤ Attenborough's narration. Whatever he does, its natural. I think he did for pocoyo, didn't he?
This is how nature balance its self
Strange, the killers never intended to eat the minke.
baby minke + easy to  kill - orcas like us are lazy :) -- adults too much work
But whale hunting is illegal!  Someone should arrest these orcas and turn them into vegans.
I reall hope there will be 4k content in this channel.
David Attenborough his voice is so profound
No justice in nature.
They weren't this scary at the SeaWorld...crazy
Green Peace shall protest against this cruelty. Down with the killer whales and sea gulls!
Why did the BBC not intervene? Humans should provide food for all wildlife to prevent this from happening
People have no empathy for animals. They're all caught up in their narrative.
I love orcas so much!
These prey animals have no sense of pride. I would have biten the fin or tail off one of the orcas. At least you take some out before you go.
Hungry Beasts 😂 but no matter what I would still love nature ❤
Incredible footage! You guys are amazing.
2:01 penguins!
3:36 Aw, he dead
RACE WAR
Genius ....
Aw1800ful.
Beautiful!!!
:(
Seems wrong.
Killer whales are not whales, mate. 0:37
Circle of life! 🐳
God I love Orcas
ORCAS******
animal cruilty
Wow that was amazing
4:13 Random rainbow.
They sound like giant killer squeak toys.
I LIKE FUZZY WHALE
There's a tag on the Minke's chin at 4:17
Why does BBC earth not show eating process itself? We see the bitten off back of the Minke whale, we see blood in the ocean, we see the blows administered by the orca pod. Lets show us how orcas actually tear off Minke meat and eat it. We humans see each other eat meat everyday at home, at work or in a restaurant don't we?
What happened to calling them their proper name: orcas, instead of killer whales. I expect better from the BBC.
Orcas are just as vicious underwater as the wild dogs on the land. 😪
Orcas are dolphins not whales  Mike drop
90% of views by Leeds fans.
Fuckin dreadful. Left at 9 and got back at 9 to travel there, spent at least £60 just to get that in return. Players need to show some fight.
Leeds were class tbf
#21 on trending lmao\n\nLeeds would have taken more though
Lmao thanks for playing in the championship lads, been a pleasure all the best for your survival
This is the year then! MOT!
We played you off the pitch but its a long season, really hope you guys stay up
I just don't see why Clough plays defensive. When we play defensive, we let them have shots. When we let them have shots, they have goals. When they have goals, Leeds happens. Playing defensive against big teams just isn't gonna work. He needs to look at Newcastle and Huddersfield and see what their doing right
why is this trending?
Sorry lads but we tanned you.
Worst team I've seen at Elland Road in years
2-1 last season though wasn't it Leeds lads. Fair play, battered us. But we're in a relegation dog fight. Not overly arsed about getting points off you lot, though it'd obviously be nice.
Northampton here. Why is this on trending? 😂
Can't believe I went couldn't even pass to each other fucking embarrassing
Sack clough and let me be manager
Consider this revenge for the 2-1 defeat last season. That being said, all the best for the season Burton, hopefully a one of game for you.
Why was there like, 12 fans for Burton?
Austin which types of comments you mostly reply . do you reply any of the comment on youtube
I am watching on an 80$ lg triibute and it is equaly as good as iphone5s
When a 80$ phone has a headphone jack but a 500$+ phone doesn't? Something is wrong
I was gonna rule this out till you said 32 gigs...I'm SOLD
This is why we don't get invited oh man...I cant 😂😂😂😂
hey austin, this is guys.
i love the way he says Hey guys this is Austin!\nkeep rocking the enthusiasm m8!
He sounds like a Fagget . HHey ! Guyyys thisss isss Austinnn..
I have an Huawei p8 lite, and here in Uruguay it costs around 200 dollars and the Alcatel is better, yeah, I live in the third world.
Austin is now (probably) recording/uploading a video about IShit X or 8 (Iphone X or 8)
Hey guys this is austin ™️
Get the pixi4
Would you talk something about the new iPhone?
I like that your reviews actually don't bore me! 👍
Hey Austin this is guy's!
Follow me on instagram @victorandres_37 and I follow you back
Can you plz do a reveiw for the Asus chromebook flip.
If you want any budget device just fly around on AliExpress n get yourself a decent looking Android phone that sends all your data to some random company in China 😁
I know it's late but\nSorry for your house :/
try heroes and castles 2, this game will destroy entry level socs like the snapdragon 400s and some low level 600s
*chough* *chough*\n*Apple*
so can it game. welllll, for the price, yes. but not compared to something im much more used to seeing that would usually appeal to the upper middle class to upper class citizens that my reviews are usually centered towards. these tech youtubers need to lower their standards a bit.
I've got an Alcatel pop 4 .It's pretty good for 70 quid. This a30 fierce is markedly better. Better camera for sure
My LG l Bello is horse shit compared to this Alcatel \n(it was also 120€ more expensive)
Austin Evans would you please tell me a price range of what you make on youtube? I would like to know because im trying to prove to somebody you can actually make money off of youtube for a job. And i am graduated and im getting in trouble for playing too much. Please respond in anyway shape or form this may also be a private reply. Just please reply. I understand if you do not reply at all.
Why are you in this commercial
I have a 80$ smartphone it works fine and a 40 and it is Conpletley fine
Why would anyone use a fingerprint device - might as well just give your fingerprint to Google and the rest of the world. Stupid people - don't you KNOW by now Google records Everything?
Austin answering the doorbell:\nHey guys, this is Austin.
Fab Video ....
chungus
Hey Austin this is guys. But what do you guy Austin think?
Try the ouktiel u20 plus, 1080 res. Dual camera and 5.5 inch display and fingerprint
For some reason it doesn't look look like it's 80$
An 80$ Phone has more functions than a 1000$ Iphone
Dude looks tired as fuck.\nGet some rest.
I had an earlier version or the Fierce, it was pretty decent, just didn't like the display brightness
Mine was 50, does It's job.
I take this one any day over the Galaxy Note 8 ore IPhone 8 plus \nI'm serious
I've played this challenge my whole life... because I'm poor
This is why we don't get invited\n-Savage Kenny
its better then my 130$ samsung galaxy core prime...\nI got 8GB of ram, no apps can be stored on the SD card, only songs, around 5gb of the storage is taken up by the phones unremoveabe applicaions,  so I have about 3gb to download apps, it has a 480p screen\n\n\n\nIT HAS A 480p SCREEN\n\n\ndo NOT get the samsumg galaxy core prime
Try just having a smart phone worth $50 now $38 for five years...
Where is the link to UK store to buy?
Hey Austin, this is guys
Better than a flagship phone from 4 yrs ago.
Same price as a old note4..which is still amazing today.
I don't see the big deal.  My Nokia 3300 still works just fine.
Instead of using real racing 3 use csr2 it has better graphics
How was this a challenge I don’t mean to be mean but this is very grateful a lot of people don’t even have friends or have a little tiny flipphones America is very lucky
Trying way to hard to flex bud
Challenge? This is better than my phone.
Haha there's a 30 dollar phone out there
But does it run the latest version of android? \n\nIf not then this is like almost every other unpopular cheap android phone. In the sense that it can't update. If it does update and has an unlocked version then I'm sold.
You should do a zenfone 3 zoom review.
can u do a review on the zte blade z max
Is Austin Evans Worth it in 2017??\n\n\n\n( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
A head phone jack! Has more features than an iPhone 7 for a 10th of the price
because it's $80 and you reviewed it, it's probably gonna sell out quick...
This is a challenge? I've been doing the $80 phone challenge for the past 5 years
It was my b day yesterday
This costs less than my S8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery month
I was using a£70 phone for months and it was more than fine
MY PHONE COST LIKE 400 DOLLARS WHEN IT WAS NEW 2 YEARS AGO... IT HAS 2 GB RAM, 16 GB STORAGE, QUAD CORE 1.2 GHZ PROCESSOR, 5 INCH SCREEN 720P. DANG. Well, at least it isn't plastic.
How is this supposedly a challenge?
Howd u gor mk x ?\nI got the s7 cant find it in store
You structure your sentences kind of strange and put weird inflections in your voice at seemingly random spots in your sentences.  Very unique, I guess that's probably why you do it.
...why would you take a fast photo of a celeb? So random.
Hey guys this is austin and it's really exhausting.
Do I the Mac mini is worth it
I think Austin is working out
Mg this rich dude should buy me a phone if he doesn't think $80 is alot 😂
zuk z1 is much better for that price (I found it for $100)
OMG! IT'S ONLY $80! THIS WILL BE THE WORST CRAP EVER! OMG!\n\n\n\n\nsrsly.
Make a Dell 5675 pc review plzzzzzzzzz
Is Austin Evans worth it?\n\nWhy does Austin Evans exist in 2017?\n\nHow to build Austin Evans (2017)
Austin's pecks are on point!!
The endangered species of the headphone jack
I'm watching this on a 30 dollar Alcatel
*THUMBS UP IF YOU LOVE AUSTIN* *ignore if you dont* 😱 \n\n\n*ps: PLEASE HELP ME REACH 2.8K IM SO CLOSE* help a kid out ❤️❤️
Review the zte avid plus next
i have a LG G3 Stylus for 120€ (im from Germany) over a year now and... its enough for me, i like it and the buttons are placed perfect!
TWO FOR$85!! TWO FOR $85!!\nSTOP MAKING PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE (ME) SELL LESS SMH.
355,522th
HHHHHHhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyy ggggggguuuuuuuyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyssssssssssssssss, this is Austin.
watching on my Alcatel 4011x 😂
I used a $30 smartphone for 2 months (zte citrine)
Please review the Zenfone 3 max
my phone is fifty dollars lol
When did Logic start reviewing products?
T-Mobile Revvl lol
Reminds me of Matimi0
decent phone
31 on trending good job Austin!
An $80 can do what a $600+ phone can do.
LOL you made a video that you couldn't even watch at it's native resolution on that display
Do a video over a 1000$ gaming laptop vs like 9000$ gaming laptop vs a gaming PC please\n\nLike if you want to see it!:D
Looked like nexus6p
hey guys I'm exhausted
Next challenge .. 80 dollars radio
Peter thanks for having me on, this was a lot of fun and of course it was a pleasure singing with you! You're the man - Ant
I thought you both did great, so I can't decide who won (I'm a undesided person, sorry) though I have to say, I thought the Metal was a bit much. But other than that, Peter, Anthony great job. I would like to see a cover video of an 80's song that can't get enough of. It's called Ride Like the Wond by Christopher Cross.
i love how Skyrim is a genre 😂😂😂
It's too funny
n o w  m y  b e d  s h e e t s  s m e l l  l I k e  y o u .
Anthony? You here?! Peter! You will have to explain... how come? Wow!! Cool!!
Please do Evermore from the new Beauty and the Beast!
My fave was the country genre!! Sounded like it could have been the original song! :)
I think Peter won. The heavy metal threw me off
Please make a Dear Evan Hansen cover of Waving Through a Window or For Forever seems right up your alley
I got surprised with PTX! It was unexpected !
Peter Hollens, can you do Lili Marlene? It's my favorite song, and my great grandfather and I used to sing it together when I was a child. He used to sing it as well with his men during WW2 a lot. You can choose between the original German version or sing it in English of course. There are also two ways to sing it, either a more slow and sad solo or a duet that's much more upbeat and happy. Much care from Deutschland! Love your work and thank you! There is the Marlene Dietrich 1915 version, and then there's a 1939 version, plus the versions out there of soldiers singing it. It's in a bunch of different languages too like English, German, French, Italian, Russian, and Japanese.
I died laughing out loud at Pentatonix, and Polka. Skyrim as a genre, beautiful!
That was amazing! I especially freaked out at Pentatonix and Eric Whitacre. :D
Oh my goodness!  This was so much fun to watch!  I'm an old soul.  More Sinatra please!  :)
I laughed very hard in the opera part when the song was translated in Italian ahhaah
I've been watching Peter Hollens since like 2011 or something and I never get sick of it! You are so amazing!
Why Did Country,EDM, and the Broad way sound better then the original
I love the country  version i dont know why it just sounds so good
Genera ideas: 8-bit, rap, more specific Broadway musical styles.
This made me really happy! Hehe. You guys were great! It's definitely a tie.
I love dat song make more songs love you guys
I was cackling at Peter dressed as Edward Scissorhands. This video was amazing, great job guys! ❤️❤️
Van Morrison was my favorite!
Full Country version PLEASSEEEE
Omg thats amaaaazinnnng
SKA SKA SKA SKA SKA
Metal :-)
this is hysterical
you should battlt roomie next
WOWOWOWOWOW!!! AMAZINGGGG
Peter deffs won!!
OMG LOVED THAT PTX SECTION
SKYRIM!
Country, for sure
All the versions were great, but the Pentatonix-version was the best for me. :)
Well that was incredibly entertaining
Country was my favourite! Shout out to Pentatonix, RIP Avi...
Okay, but what's that Van Morrison-thing?! It does sound nothing like him ...
That was amazing! Any chance we could get a full country version with both of you?
This is amazing 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Want to listen over and over again 😊🙏🙏🙏❤\nThank you for all wonderful music and I love to listen ☺☺☺
awesome, i give like, and subscribe
If the Sinantra part was a full version, I'd totally want it
I need a full version of the song as Broadway. That was amazing
Super cool Peter! Would love to see more of these genre battles :)
please crazy arms of ray price!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The left is the best becaus I like metal.
can you do Shawn James  The Shapeshifters - Through The Valley
I've always just been kinda neutral on Opera, but man, I would pay to hear Holland do this whole song in the operatic style of 1:36-1:48. Such an amazing voice! Oh, and the 10 sec song guy has an impressive Sinatra =)
you should do simple kind of man by lynyrd skynyrd
Well I grinned big at the opera, Peter's reaction to metal was perfect comedy, Weird Al look at 3:07 = beeg LOL...all really really goooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
plzzzz do a battle with the song believer from imagine dragons
Peter Hollens you are amazing talented. I love listening to you. Keep sharing your gifts. You are brilliant.
I almost want an entire cover in the opera style
This was honestly the best shape of you 'cover' or whatever you wanna call it i've seen so far
I looooved it!! :D so entertaining and such great talent, I wanna see moreee!! :D I loved the funk, country, Sinatra, Chant versions and I laughed so hard at the Skyrim and Polka ones. @Peter, your Italian is good! Haha so weird to hear you speak my native language. I adore you and your wife but I think that the challenge was won by Anthony (forgive mee). Haha
THAT. WAS. INCREDIBLY. AMAZING!!!!! Keep going guys! !! Big love from Italy! !!!!♥♥♥
Omg you where on the news in the Netherlands
@PeterHollens, this was fantastic! @Pentatonix was the best! You won!
Please, please, please do Empty chairs at empty tables!
Would love if you did a cover of an Irish Folk song called One I love
This was so fun to watch! I hope you do more of these! Never thought I'd Hear Peter Hollens singing country like that
Dang! You guys are amazing! I cannot pick a winner.
So many parodies in one video!!!! lol
How can you sing literally everything!
I'm not a fan of this song but this was AWESOME
I love how Peters is a general red button, and the tense one songs guy has an easy button.
super cool and creative. The fact that PTX and Skyrim are their own genres is perfection! :)
wait what this is a rap battle?
Could you possibly sing Siuil a Run?
Apparently, Skyrim is now a genre
Well well well ... What can i say ? Incredible, like always. \nDo you know what would be incredible too ? Singing Johanna or Pretty Women from the movie Sweeney Todd, i think it would be great.\nPlease, do it ... please
Because frank sinatra is a genre
when did Pentatonix become a genre?
wow opera and broadway was amazing!! The whole video I couldn't do anything else but smile!
I loved country style I have to say!  <3
Excellent.
SKA SKA SKA SKA SKA SKA SKA
So good...
I love it .
LOL 😂
Holy shøøøt that was sooo gooooooood!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Why did Peter have a fidget spinner at the end
PENTATONIX
Amazing, deeply shook but I'm okay
Loved the Pentatonix Daft Punk reference
THAT FIDGETSPINNER THOUGH
I stand alone - quest for Camelot
Lol 😂😂😂
WOAH! SURPRISE PENTATONIX
figut spinerr
Amazing!
Shout out for edeter
Chant is the coolest
PTX... LOL
good job
Hotel California
Do all star
AND NOW MY BEDSHEETS SMELL LIKE YOUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I would appreciate this song more if it didn't add too much affect to it ,they both have great voices they apparently don't need it.
This music video is giving me a thrill, i feel like im watching a trailer of an action movie
It can be an 007 ost / 50 shades of grey..

These days comment section for songs is filled with comments like first hearing: nah its stupid and then third listening they start liking it But i haven't seen one comment like that here!! It's because this song is a masterpiece you don't have to force yourself to listen to it over and over again to like it. This song just gets more and more beautiful as i listen to it
I love the style and vibes of this song😍
Zayn looks like the guy from one direction, that band from X factor

Can anybody how did he exchange the bags???

Jan benndik spivakonvickova
More videos like this, they know so much bout footy just listening to them talk is making me better lmao
Neville, Ferdinand, Terry, Cole, Gerrard and Lampard in the same team. How in the hell did this golden generation of players never win or let alone ever come close to winning a major tournament as part of English national team?
Why is the BBC accepting the Sky/Murdoch propaganda that there was no football before the 'premier' league?
I think all three of Lampard, Gerrard and Scholes could have played together. The problem was England crowbarring players into a flat 4-4-2 formation (like the one on this video) that couldn't accommodate them...as well as insisting on playing two strikers in an old fashion model. It's so obvious that it should have been:\n\n                                                                      Scholes\n                                                            Gerrard     Lampard\n\nThats England's midfield should have setup. Scholes playing as the holding midfielder with Gerrard and Lampard playing in front of him.
i think Paul Scholes has to be in that team....and barnes over giggs in my opinion. Best partner for Shearer for me is Sheringham
Giggs is the most overrated player in PL history. Pires>Giggs easily
I love the analysis top notch
Lampard lmao.
WHAT ABOUT VAN PERSIE!!!!!!! His first touch was incredible and his skill was unbelievable. The goals he scored....... Remember his header when he won 5-1 against Spain??
Since this is only a hypothetical midfield,  Gerrard and Lampard defo
Yeah right, why was Shearer in this discussion? I think we already knew the outcome and I agree with Henry Shearer duo.\nBut it's kinda funny to see him here. lol.
No Scholes, Vieira or Keane. Ok?
Where is Silva??? A true magician with the ball, the most underrated player in the Premier, he is simply superb week in week out.
I would have to separate Gerrard and Lampand. Take Lampand out and put in Scholes or Virera. I would put Scholes in.
How can we not have Scholes!!
Stam, Okocha, and Zola left out?
Nail Vlogs Please!!
Your accent is my fave lol
Such a gorgeous natural glowy look.
THAT HIGHLIGHTER. I CANT STOP YELLING

You are sooooo fucking dope dude!
She is GORGEOUS 😩😍
ur skin looks gorgeous!!
Your skin looks amazing! You just aren't used to this look but it's so nice to switch it up. Isn't that the point of makeup? 🙂✨ Seems like Riri was tired of the trends and just focused on glowy skin for everyone and quality products without overcharging. Thanks for your review! Big fan!! 💕
I think you look GORGEOUS and glowy!
Ur accent is everything!!! And ur so beautiful!!
Did your purple wash out or did you get it touched up? just curious because i loved the purple and want to try!
I love your excitement for it! This review was super helpful for me!
Do you happen to remember what lashes youre wearing here?
what foundation color is this? someone please help me :)
I just saw your video along with others giving a review on Rihanna's product. A girl from my town decided to go into porn and now I see where she got the name! Lmao I'm so serious Genevieve Sinn is her porn name.
Gorgeous! Able to leave your shade etc in the description next time ❤️?
A B S O L U T E L Y flawless!
I've got a bloody wedding dress to buy lmfao priceless! Love you 😍🙌🏼
Just started my channel. 🍾\n\nWatch my new video! 😁and subscribe!    \n\nPlease and thanks 🙏 💖\n\n✌️
Im in love with ur accent new subbie alert 🚨
Your face/skin looks amazing your makeup looks amazing as well beautiful.
I didn't want to buy any of this until I saw this video.. the foundation looks Amazing 😍
Love this!!! I'm so sad it's not out near me yet! I have a hard time finding a good matte foundation because I am naturally VERY oily. Super stoked to try this once it's in my area.
I just absolutely love watching you! So beautiful and real!
I don't even have to watch this video to tell you if it's worth it. Girl is that description a joke? 😹😹😹 HELL MF YES IT IS WORTH IT!
My goodness, your skin looks AMAZING! This line is definitely something that will have to go on my wishlist <3
YOU'RE A GODDESS 😍
Totally shocked that there's only ONE lippie!
I think everything looks great on you!! I saw sooo many people gathered around the Fenty Beauty display at Sephora today so I havent gotten a chance to browse it yet. You've got me excited to try it!!! You look beautiful❤❤
This is the best I have ever seen your skin! It looks so beautiful!
I think this is a nice brand and the foundation is great for people who like/prefer matte finish. You just rock the dewy look, Jamie!! Im the same way! I love my oils, my natural/satin/dewy finishes and i have been loving Cover Fx illuminating setting mist😍 you should try it. Love the highlighter, i bought trophy wife today. Gonna use it as eyeshadow. Thanks for this review!
I REALLY love this look on you!
JAAAMIIIEEE you look STUNNING! The lipgloss is gorgeous on you! Also your skin is amazing right now.
New subscriber - love how this looks on your skin.  It looks dewy and flawless even though it sounds like it feels otherwise.  I've watched a couple of other reviews of the products and that's how I found you.  That seems to be a commonality.  What it feels like vs what it looks like are two different things though the matte feeling wasn't described as bad.  It sounds great for oily or combo skin but mine is super dry so I'm thinking there is no way it will work on me.
How did I miss this 😍😍😍
Your skin...holy shit 😍😫 it is as plump and clear as an angels bum!!
One of the best face looks you've done in my opinion 🙌🏽🙌🏽 you always look beautiful but the blends are so nice and natural! Enough bronzer blush everything so pretty! 😚😚😚💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽
Amazing video !!! I just subscribed!!! I've been watching YouTube for years and never came across your videos before  .. I'm Canadian and actually living in Glasgow at the moment with my Scottish hubby 😊. So love you even more that you're Scottish! 😉👌🏻Have fun wedding dress shopping!!! X\nI'm definitely going to Harvey Nic's tomorrow in Edinburgh so spend all my money on Fenty haha
Ok. So i hadnt heard anything at all about this collection and Im not particularly a huge fan of Rihanna.  But OMG! you look gorgeous. When i saw the thumbnail i clicked on it immediately because i had to know what was on your face. You look so breath taking. Also i think you look so glowy and it made me laugh that you said you werent used to being so matte. Lol but anyways you look amazing.
Does anyone know if the foundation would be any good for dry skin??? The struggle is so real finding a foundation that works with my crusty ass face ( I have good skin care I just have dry skin :( )
Why does she look different in the thumbnail ¿ Not saying it in a bad way she's absolutely beautiful but I'm just curious 🤷🏻‍♀️💗
Jamie do you have a tutorial with makeup for humid weather?
can't stop looking at your dingly earring. The mixture of earrings and piercings you have with your hair looks so fucking good. I want a dingly earring
This is honestly the best your skin has ever looked! It always looks good, but looks amazing here! Love the lip look way better than a liquid lip - looks like your natural lips but better. Also the gold higlighter looks crazy wearable and gorgeous.
why have I never found you before now 😩 so genuine and unreal!!!
Skin looks gorgeous i think! Loved this review
Jamie💛💖💛,\n\nI absolutely LOVE this makeup on your skin!! You do not look too matte and to me anyways , you look fresh faced and a little dewey😗\n\nI bought the sticks from Sephora. They are coming today and I am super exfit3d to try them!!💖💖. Brianna is my woman crush so it's a bonus that I get to support $$ her and also support my own love of makeup at the same time!! Lol
I bought my shade online and it's about 70 shades too light. Lesson learnt: listen to Jamie and don't buy online 😂
Okay I may have to splurge on this line..maybe after my baby gets here because I'm just not feeling myself right now, despite all the makeup I have 😕 But this look looks great on you!! No creasing, nothing! Can't wait to see how it's worn! ❤❤
See with the contour sticks do they have warmer ones? I use the smashbox ones still (throwback!) and I use a more cool toned one to contour, then I highlight (then I would cream blush if I used it), but then I blend my warmer shade where I would normally bronze and blend it a little further down or upward on my cheekbones and it acts as a bronzer rather than a contour stick. Don't know if you'll even see this but just thought it would help if you did want to utilise one as a cream bronzer.
Anyone sick of eyeshadow and eyeshadow looks? I sure am, glad Rihanna didn't make that her release's focus
I'm a huge fan of your make-up looks, but this one is the best I've ever seen on you. Your skin is flawless and the lipgloss looks stunning on you and suits you a million times more than anything I've ever seen you wear on your lips. You should def' wear the foundation n highlighters again and the lipgloss is the biggest keeper xoxo
Your make up looks stunning here! You look beautiful, love your hair like this too xx
I love this !!!!!! I'm not a big fan of gold highlight because I feel it makes me look yellow toned or sort of washed out ? But this is amazing ' 🙌🏼
I love that the foundation is matte! Hopefully someone in New Zealand will stock it 🤞🏼I'm very keen to try. Thanks Jamie, love your videos as always x
I LOVE YOUR HAIR LIKE THIS GIRL!! <3 <3 ALSOO your skin is super nice!!  I thought your lashes were lash extensions you apply them so flippin well!! <3 #snapfam
I'm so excited to get my Fenty products!!
I freaking love ur accent!!! I've followed you on ig but never youtube idk why (until today) I can't wait to binge watch ur vids after this vid 💕💕
OOOOOO I know you said you're not crazy about the matte-ness of it but OOO BOY it still looks pretty dewy and natural/glowy to me!!! It looks amazing I'm HYPE
The highlight looks gorgeous on you layered with the two different shades.
This look is so wonderful on you! Different from your usual, but STUNNING! Fenty looks good on you ;)
I uploaded a vid on the foundation too it really is amazing😍😍
Looks stunning on you, I think the color and texture is just right
You're so beautiful!!😍
The Macy's ad was amazing.....
I think her coming out with face products makes sense. She's always had the most beautiful skin!!
I'm not a matte foundation fan for my skin either but your skin is looking really gorgeous so it's inspiring me to try it out! And I am really liking how natural it's looking. That yellow highlighter may be too much for my pale ass skin but it's surprisingly wearing really nice on you! Thanks for sharing!
What is the highlighting brush you used please? LOVE the video! xxx
Skin looks sooo amazing! I just made my first beauty/skin care video if anyone would like to check if out!
I love the way this looks! Your skin literally looks like skin!
Your skin is perfection. You don't need foundation.
If you haven't chosen a photographer yet for your wedding you should check out Angie B Photography - she's based out of Perth. She's an amazing person and her work is stunning! She's won Scottish Wedding Photographer of the year too! https://www.angieb.co.uk/
so pleased to hear another scottish accent wee pleasant surprise
I love it on your skin even though you love more glowy finish, it is beautiful and I can't wait for more Fenty Beauty
Beautiful as always!! 💕 What lashes are you wearing?
You look absolutely beautiful !!!! You're video is great had such a blast watching it every informative and straight to the point 👍🏽👍🏽
Has anyone with oily skin tried this foundation- if so how long wearing was it??
Her shade is whaaat??? Can't understand her accent
Crikey that's A LOT of make up... how do you even move your face?
Le falta carne :/
Get the oscar spot ready on the Mantle
Lagrimón! Pero que alguien le cambie la peluca a Roger, por favor.
Exagerada la actuacion de los puñetazos al principio
Wow. He's got Freddie down.
It's Rami voice? Really good voice!
OMG, MI CORAZÓN, JODEEER.
Un poquito exagerado los movimientos diria yo....
He looks good but he also looks like he has a weird giant head.
This was obviously centered on Rami and his playing of Freddie but for the few moments we saw the other members they all have their guys down pat. That John Deacon bow was spot on.
wow I have never said this about a biopic before, but I'm looking forward to this
Muchooooo éxito 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Lo que está claro es que esto ya tiene forma por fin. Y en cuanto estos vídeos que seguramente saldrán más no hay que hacerles mucho caso, ya que en una película hay miles de tomas que finalmente no salen ella, (espero que esta sea una de ellas). El único que no se parece tanto es Freddie, los demás prácticamente son igualitos. Habrá que esperar el resultado final, no es lo mismo verlo desde la grabación de un móvil y desde una distancia a verlo en el cine con las mejores cámaras y el mejor audio.
Bisogna lasciare assolutamente la voce di Freddie ,non c è niente di meglio che la sua voce in quella giornata.\nBisogna poi non concentrarsi troppo su questa esibizione, che è stata forse la più iconica di sempre, semplicemente unica così come è\nMercury è inimitabile o si va ancora più nei dettagli e si rasenta la perfezione o i fan di Fred ,che sono fan attentissimi e che ci tengono molto ,troveranno il tutto una scimmiottatura, attenta produzione, il confine fra un capolavoro e un flop mai come in questo caso può essere sottile !!
he's got the look down. and the shimmy, haha
That's a lovely lovely voice. Rami's gonna nail it.
I HOPE THE FREDDIE MOVES ARE GETTING SMOOTHER....TOO CHOREOGRAPHED.
😘😘😘😘el mejor Fredy Mercury 😘😘😘
Luke Spiller would have been a better choice.
I m gonna cry my lung out..my freddie ..why did u left angel.
Eu achei que ficou bom, mas ficou meio que exagerado nas atuações de Rami. Mas ficou legal
Me parece que a Rami le falta un poco de musculatura y no exsagar tanto en lo movimientos . Bueno en realidad me parece que lo estoy comparando demasiado con Freddie y nadie lo va a poder igualar, nisiquiera en su forma de moverse en el escenario.
SPETTACOLARE
Wow!
wow!!!!!!
Buenazo
para mi esta bien,nadie nunca va a igualar al gran freddie pero para la movie sivesta pasable mucha suerte la espero ansiosa.
Damnn!
O DIOSSSS❤❤❤❤❤😍👍👍
Gran impresión del Live Aid
Suerte mucha suerte,Que nadie olvide  al Gran Freddie
Al principio no pensé que fueran los dobles 😝😝 están geniales estoy sorprendida 😘😘😘
Por fin se hará realidad 😭😭 mucha suerte a Rami y al resto de la producción!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌
marc martel
WOW!
Rami did a really good job, but if they were filming, I'd recommend doing it again, honestly. He needs to move a bit more like Freddie, he puts his shoulders up a little to much and the timing was a bit bad.
This is the era where people watching directly not thru camera phone.
Was is sped up? If not then it looked really bad.i mean look at what he's doing with his arms. Looks like sieg heil. There is no fines in how he moves. Really really bad acting.
Fix the teeth.  Freddie was no Bugs Bunny; he was Freddie Mercury AND PLEASE rent a hose so Malek can appear to be the Persian Popinjay!  Also, Malek will need to incorporate Freddie's fierce expression at times or it wont work.
esa es la voz de marc martel, tal vez esté colaborando con la pelicula
Los criticos somos nosotros los fans espero q sea gran pelicula no un negocio saludos amigas y amigos
Nos quejamos durante años porque este proyecto no avanzaba, y una vez que se vuelve real, empiezan a criticar todo. Encima es solo un detrás de escena, ni siquiera se sabe si es una toma que va a quedar. Sean más contemplativos, queridos.
Joder, que buenas carcajadas me he aventado con esto, los movimientos si son exagerados creo que hasta yo lo puedo mejorar, ahí hace falta practicar, por cierto Rami usa unos pantalones acampanados fuera de moda muy setenteros...Los de Freddie no eran así, la forma de moverse de John Deacon bien despreocupado va y toma su instrumento jaja y Roger ese peluquín(se ve de lejos) y medio enano al parecer tiene que dar grandes saltos hasta la batería para llegar, espero cambien esos detalles en la película final.
I'M CONFUSED. IS RAMI SINGING OR MARC MARTEL?
hope theres plenty of gay club action
SHE HIT 1 MILLION 🤣😂😍😍😍🤗😇🤓
Hey girl, I just wanted to stop by and let you know how much I appreciate you. You are the reason why I decided to FINALLY step out of my comfort zone and start my YouTube channel. You're so inspiring and  so real and I appreciate you for putting yourself out there for the rest of us! 😘 love you.
All these products look amazing on you! I especially love the lip gloss :) You and Rihanna are both slaying the game!! #shamelessfenty
I love the natural look #ShamelessFenty
As a caramel girl myself, I am here for this 100%!!
i totally love you!
I love the natural look it gives off!!!! AMAZING JOB RIHANNA!!! It looks so good

Thanks for the review. I can't wait to try the stuff myself
#shamelessfenty Loving this Trophy Wife! I would be rubbing it on too!
love fenty beauty and how she came out with 40 shades. Your end look looks so natural
I really enjoyed this video!  i love how you were being completely honest about all of the products even though they might not have been your favorites. you made me want to get some fenty beauty in my make up bag!!
I absolutely love this look!
Im really liking that she made this line to focus on the skin! everything seems to make the skin look super healthy and glowy
That highlighter was MADE for you! gorgeous!
Wow nice look using the trophy wife as eye shadow.
This look is beautiful! I absolutely love the natural look!
#shamelessfenty 💄Love this look! This makeup would be absolutely perfect for me. I don't need the full coverage but I'm just beginning to play with makeup styles at 43 😄
SHAMELESS!!!!! I'm ready to hear all your thoughts.
I LOVE YOU SM MAYA and I remember when I went to girl talk and I meet you. It meant so much because I told you that you taught me how to be fearless because I was insecure about my finger. Shortly after that you gave me a hug and that made my whole entire year:)
I don't wear makeup but man, Fenty makes me want to wear it
I love all of your videos and I love Rihanna omg we island girls are winiing!
Loved this look! Congrats on 1 million!!!! I almost cried for you when I saw it!!! God is so good
I'm obsessed with this makeup line. I want to get so many things
I love your reaction to her makeup. You are GLOWING with the products. Natural Beauty is the way to go.
I don't even wear makeup like that, but I need this!
Loved this look on you, you have an amazing skin! Since Fenty Beauty doesn't ship to where I live, i will love to have a chance to win this. 🌟Congrats on 1M🌟
We definitely have the same taste for makeup! I live for that natural caramel glow 😘🙌🏽✨✨
So glad I got that foundation shade😍 so beautiful. RIH KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING!
Haha I was waiting in front of my computer JUST LIKE THAT 😂
I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH
First review I've seen! Love your expressive self!
i think i almost died when you put on that rum hightlight all over yo face!!!! girl werk!!!!!! #shamelessfenty
#shamelessfenty I NEED these products in my life!!
I love your videos <3 and you are my main inspiration
I love how great this look turned out! This brand would be perfect for me because I don't really beat my face like that, I usually do a natural look, so I'm really hype to try this out!
Maya i love you, and have been watching you since you started when you had your long beautiful curly hair. Absolutely love the new fenty collection riri out here slaying the game👌💕👏
✨Oh wow! You look sooo freakin pretty! I love your look!!! This video was very nice and it represents Fenty Beauty very well!!!💄💖😍💐✨
Congratulations Maya! You look stunning. I'm definitely loving the au natural look FENDY is bringing, xo, Sheyla
Awesome job.. Thinking  of buying the trio.. cuz I don't have anything like that
Love you Maya! You're the one YouTuber in my sub box that I relate to most- thank you for doing you! ❤️
Wow. I loved your review and this makeup made you look flawless.
Love your video. Loved watching your excitement with each new product.
hey Maya where you get those awesome tone colour backgrounds???\nor is that your wall lol?? plz answer
This might bet THE best makeup line I've seen! So bronze and natural AND glam all in one! My kind of makeup! #shamelessfenty
OMG I love these! That rum is amazing!
#shamelessfenty LOVED this review. I bought product day 1 of the launch but think I need to go back and purchase a couple more items (at least try them on!) after watching this fab video. Thanks for the realness in your review! XOXO
I am sold on Fenty Beauty; your makeup looks fabulous!!!! I'm headed out to Sephora to get mine.
I love how HAM you went with Rum. I have that same trio and it's freaking great. The foundation isn't oxidizing, b/c the air isn't changing the color. It's wet and looks lighter, and then once it dries/sets it's the actually color. It doesn't change color as the day goes along. Once it's set, that's the color it's going to stay.
the highlight looks so bomb
I love your vids! And you are so gorgeous!
That highlighter looks so pretty on you. Can't wait to try it out.
The highlight blend on the eyes was a good idea. A lot of other reviews mentioned it was too yellow
I have the foundation and primer. Probably gonna go back and get trophy wife when I get my coins right #ShamelessFenty
Maya, you needed to apply more foundation. It is a buildable foundation so it can be worn light or full coverage. The primer you used could be the reason for the ashiness! That seems to be the case for the different primers that are being used. You still look BOMB😝
Sooo beautiful.
Broooo she gorg😍
Dat gold thoooooo

What a goal from #i.Perisic
Seriously, that Perisic Goal was actually amazing..
class of perisic
Woww perisic.. magnificent goal..
Icardi an Perisic are unstopabble in this season, i'll hope inter win this serie A

Gol perisic!!!  Mirip Gol Zidane!!!
#ForzaInter
Ayo Inter...terus maju...
perisic....
Quando hai skriniar al fanta e nel momento in cui prende la traversa partono bestemmie in loop
Grande inter...ma anche contro una grande spal secondo me l'Inter quest'anno tornerà in Champions più forte che mai #AMALA #FORZAINTER
grande inter....we will back to champion league
Ho l'impressione che gli arbitri sapendo di avere le spalle coperte dal VAR, siano molto meno attenti che prima. Il fallo che ha originato il rigore per l'Inter era all'interno dell'area di almeno mezzo metro, è possibile che tra arbitro, guardalinee e assistente di porta abbiano dovuto ricorrere a un ausilio tecnologico e nessuno sia stato in grado di decidere?

I want you back on smosh😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢
Anthony came up with this? It's fucking genius, I love it 😂😂😂
lmao this is so true
Slow down the credits. 4:03 Bowl supplier Ian Hecox
Oh my God!!! That's the exact same speaker I have XD. I was using it as I was watching this and frigging thought why does he have my speaker XD

Who agrees that Smosh was better with Anthony it's never going to be the same and it's never going to get worse than it already has Smosh's Legacy and I think that Anthony needs to do one video food battle 2017 who agrees
No problem Anthony I always watch your videos
Why am i so scared :v
I just noticed the Satan thing wtf lol
dude, i had so much fun watching smosh as a kid with my friends, good old times, but im not liking this stuff, also i stopped watching smosh since it became a brand, im literally following u guys since the beggining </3 thanks for being part of my childhood and hope you get more and more views, but i dont like it, just my opinion, maybe im just saying that because i hope you could do stuff like the old times, but just keep doing what you like, have fun
Kids this is why we listen to our teachers when they say math it better
Jajajajajaja authentically amazing! I almost can't saw all the video because of laughing...
Wait one of them was Dan? Was it U? I hope it was U. That or A.
I love how at the end of the credits it says: \nRat- Daniel Howell
Why was this so terrifyingly funny😂😂

I only realized until E was dying that they all were only able to say their vowel. i thought they all just had really bad accents.

Hobbie lawler 😂😂😂
RDS vs Hobbie Lawler.
Fook you UFC How The hell Valentina Lost the fight. fook u
Valentina clearly won that fight! if you think otherwise, please hang yourself
People here act like Valentina won,i was rooting for Valentina but JEEESUS,if you want the belt you have to FIGHT,she threw 50 punches in the whole match,2 of them landed to no effect,no pressure,just waiting....If Amanda would have played the counter game Valentina would have literally thrown NO PUNCHES....Im dissapointed in Valentina after all that shit talkin' and shit i would have expected to actually fight for it...and now she acts like she was robbed....This kind of fights really expose fighters like Valentina who just wait for a mistake....i understand the counter strike game trust me but man.....she literally did NOTHING in this fight
Where's Dana so he can say he has it 2-2 going into the 5th round ?
Valentina #1.   FUCKKKK YOUUUU BİTCHHHHHHH AMENDA NUNES
Yeah that Hobbie Lawler fight is the one to make. His hlord hesus Christ and saviour wants that fight.
First Cejudo fight and pressor I've seen. New found respect for his skills and his respectful attitude. Looked a lot like Conor's wide karate in / out bouncing style stance and extended arm - pawing at his opponent. Not a McGregor fan by any stretch of the imagination, just an observation.
Gustafsson admitted that he didn't do enough to take the belt from Bonesjones, even though he thinks he won the fight on points. Valentina needs to take the obvious hint, don't leave it up to the judges. To be the champ not only do you have to beat the champ, you have to rip the champs head off!
Robbed or not..dont leave it in the hands of the judges..
I wont lie nunes got the win but if it was five rounds she would have hassed and and been wrecked
I love how ppl are saying Valentina won, you dummies nobody won, they gave it to Nunes based on simple technicality, she just moved more at the end but both fighters didn't do shit the whole time I was actually thinking my online feed was buffering or something at one point cuz they were just like standing still, imo, they both lost, I would have sent a message to both fighters and other fighters in UFC and gave a decision of No Contest, both losers, you don't train for months and have all these people pay to get in and pay to watch it on TV and than after all the build up just look at each other and bounce around touching each other's gloves the odd time for 15 mins, fuck this fight, UFC needs to change is rules, in a case like this with no clear winner, have 3 fuckin bonus rounds, if still nothing, 3 more, eventually someone will lose clearly.
Nunes looks like a teenage boy.

Valentina won that fight, it was not close, Valentina landed way more puchnes and kicks.\nAnd only in the last round 5 Nunes did take down, at on the grond Valentina did even more punch in the face of Nunes
NUNES LOST BECAUSE SHE WAS A LESBO, NOT BLACK!
#40 on trending, just behind the make up idiots and cup cakers,\n i
big respez to cejudo, would love to see him fight sergio pettis for number 1 contender
Sorry Amanda. We would be more impressed with a finish than going 5 rounds. It's supposed to be the Ultimate FIGHTING championship, not the Ultimate Endurance Championship.
Cejudo carries himself like a champ. Its a shame he's in the same division as mighty mouse
I watched the fight back in silence with a pen and scorecard. I gave Nunes rounds 1,3 and 5 under the current point scoring system. Amanda won, but the whole system is wrong and limited; needs a radical overhaul.
Nunes keep calling herself Lioness (female lion) but she keeps using Lion (male) image
Thats what happens when youre openly gay, you get pushed to stay on top just because of horrible propaganda
shut up nunes you lost
UFC What are the fight bonus ?????????????????????????????????????
Cejudo is a stand up guy, and a legitimate badass. His striking is getting so much better!  He will be ready for DJ soon.
Did Henry just say he uses brute strength? ...uuuu ok ..u see brute strength I see brute strength bro. You 5ft 0 95lb man
Nunes vs shevchenko\n\nThe battle of grammar
Shevchenko needs to be humble in loss you fought her before you knew what you had to do counter punch don't cut it it was close but I think judges was right
Amanda is a good person
Lets agree here amanda was afraid to lose the belt n therefore fought the way she did n valentina the same onli cuz she was afraid of losing the oppurtunity. Alot of these champions r fightimg too safe they need to go bak to wat got them there in the first place
when do we get the drug test results
you can't win the belt if you avoid fighting
lol Nunes can either go 2 rounds and blast people then gas out or go 5 rounds and do nothing.
nunez said she didn't want tte ko or sub  she wanted to show she could go 5 rds 25 mins  BULLSHIT who wouldn't ko an opponent  if possible she sounds stupid
Bought women fought bad as fuck. Don't be bitching about judges now, you both lost.
Only i couldn't listen that stupid monkey nunes? Her face looks like my shit
Nunes lost this fight 100% Valentina should be champion!
Idk. I had it a draw but then Nunes got that take down at the end. Lets do it again! Trilogy!
why do people hate amanda so much? did she kick a kitten or something?
The commentary was fucking gold during this event.
Valentina didn't win, nor did Nunes. It was a DRAW and there needs to be a 3rd fight. Neither fighter did enough to win or even win a round decisively. Nunes' take down was nothing, it wasnt clean and she did no damage with it. It's a major floor of mma that take downs are given props like this. If you try a take down and can't land it clean or do any damage with it, that should go against you in the judging if anything!
Nunes needs to go up in weight and get a shot at Conor's belt, he deserves it👍
A MAN NUNES , what a gutless monstrosity...Dudes like that, shouldn't be around! The UFC should force him to fight CYBORG with Herb To the death Dean reffing that shit!!!!
Dude.....I cant remember ever watching a 125 lber post fight, but i'm liking Cejudo more and more. His style is entertaining af, he should technically be 2-0 since losing to DJ, and fighting for the title next against the plague.
Aaaaaand everyone hates nunes
Parabéns Amanda!
another boring fight card!!!
2-0
The dislike tho..... keep going guys....
Gj ufc for robbing valentina
I wanna see Hafael Vs Huthless Hobbie
Rematch again shev is better than nunes
Blasphemy
FUCKING ENGLISH    lol
A MAN DUH NUNES
Hobbie Lawler! 😂
Why so many dislikes??....
Amanda  No monster drink  Nunes.
Feeling happy for Henry Cejudo, good stuff!
That was some bullshit for real that the crooked judges gave Amanda Nunes the win over Valentina Shevchenko! They did her dirty right there. I finished watching the fight just now. Valentina clearly won that fight and should be the next champion. Valentina gave the most connected striking in each round than Amanda did towards Valentina. Valentina stopped one of Amanda's takedowns, successfully gotten out of one of her traps on the ground in the last round, with exception for the last takedown which Amanda didn't hardly do anything when she was on top of her. No submission or ground pounding from Amanda...while Valentina on her back was striking her really well. I don't blame her for being angry about the decision and filing a appeal for a third fight. For over a year now, these judges would make decisions over fights screwing these fighters of their win when it was obvious they scored the fight in each round incorrectly and unfairly. I don't what drugs these judges were on or what they got against Valentina, but they are wrong for making that decision. Sorry. They need to hire new judges who are experienced in judging these fights. That's just how I feel. 😠 It's time for a *Trilogy* ☺
Actually believe it or not Nunes won the fight, the punchings exchanges were positive for her the 2 first rounds. Valentina got more overall. Nunes' plan was to weaken that right leg from Valentina for the 4 rounds and then secure the win with a takedown in the last one. The standing fight was really close tho, valentina shown more combinations and techniques but most of them were not significatnt/strong ones. If Nunes didnt performed the takedown on the last round she would have lost. The last round was very positive in the standing game for Shevchenko.\n\nNunes clearly managed the octagon and distance for the entire fight, and thats a fact. Valentina knew Nunes was abusing her leg with low kicks and did practically nothing about it.
Round 1 Nunes\nRound 2 Valentina\nRound 3 Nunes\nRound 4 Valentina\nRound 5 Nunes\nWatch it again. I'm not a Nunes fan but that fucking bitch won fair. Valentina did more damage, Nunes scored more points.
I think a reasonable person could see how either fighter could have been given the decision.   Valentina herself only thinks she won 3 rounds, so if the judges disagreed with her on only one round then she lost.  My assessment is that Amanda clearly won rounds 1 and 5, while Valentina won round 4, so the debate is who won rounds 2 and 3.  Valentina, I thought was too defensive and although she has quicker hands, she was only waiting to counter, problem is Amanda knew it, so Amanda was the aggressor but she was using low kicks and kicks to the abdomen, making it difficult for Valentina to counter and limited her scoring opportunities.  Because Amanda was the aggressor and the judges are suppose to award the aggressor, since they are bringing the fight, that's was the key reason Amanda won.  You can play it safe like Valentina, be defensive and only plan to score by countering the whole night, but don't be surprise when you lose, since the only fighter I've seen to have success with that strategy in title fights is Mayweather, but unfortunately Valentina is not Mayweather.  Lastly, I suspect Valentina was gun shy after feeling Amanda power in the first fight, since that's the only reason I can think of that would cause her not to let her hands go, when her hands are clearly quicker that Amanda's.
Fuck your retarded decision... nunes lost... the fuck is this ? You should fire those retarded so called judges asap... what the fuck did they judge ?? They clearly are fucking blind bats
Wanna take the belt from a champ? Win decisively. Wanna keep your belt? Win decisively.
As bad as when Condit ran from diaz
For all you Valentine fans stop crying. This was a boring fight!!! Shavchenko fought like a little girl. To be a champion you have to beat the champion. Not by points but the head off. Nunes is the champ. She stood her ground.
sorry but Nunes really not convince me in this fight she do nothing  and everything she say in the post fight dont make sense Oo , in my book Valentina win the fight  but is look she dont make enough to win the belt
Valentina was frightened, she did not do the necessary to be champion, she talked too much and did nothing, robbery would be to get a champ doing nothing
why hate on nunes, she had a job to do and did it, the UFC fucked up not her
melendez needs to retire or something... he doesn't care for fighting anymore it seems... if you're a strikeforce fan... this isn't the same melendez at all.
Look at shevchenkos head looks like she stuck it in a beehive !She says Amanda didn't hurt her but did she ever really hurt Amanda?Amanda kinda Floyd mayweathered Valentina and then took her down to seal the deal no robbery close fight but no robbery
Shevchenko is robbed
Valentina won that fight!
Valentina beat herself with a stupid fight plan.  She used the same passive fight plan she used on holly but this just in, Amanda saw that fight.  Valentina didn't want to take risk so all Amanda had to do was be the aggressor in each round knowing since close rounds go to the aggressor.  Amanda plan was to simply out point valentina unlike her other fights were she goes for the ko, thats why she was smiling in between rounds because she knew she was winning.  She won the fights with those leg kicks, kicks to the abdomen and those take downs in round 5, while valentina was sitting there waiting to counter, something she didn't get to do much
#AndStill baby!
#NunesFakeChampion What a shame!!! 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼💩💩
Robbery, give her a rematch
Rematch!
Valentina didn't do shit this fight, get over it, she deserved the L
Nunes won at best 2 rounds... Robbed simply based on the fact Nunes did get a takedown but did ZERO damage with it and actually received damage from getting hit from the bottom. Nunes was gifted this decision for sure.
Saltchenko fans make me so happy. Ya girl lost. Cry some more.
47-47 if you include the point which should have been deducted
I though that Shevchenko won the fight, I gave Nunes the 1st round then Shevchenko the 2nd, 3rd and 4th round and then Nunes the 5th, I like both fighters but seriously when Shevchenko lost it didn't really bother me as I like both fighters but I lost a serious amount of respect to Shevchenko because all she did was bitched at the end of the fight, other fighters are humble in defeat and she didn't even thank the the crowd, thank Nunes and said it was a really tough fight, all she did was bitched and said the judges are terrible and I won easily. Although I thought Shevchenko won, I lost a lot of respect to her
Bout scores:\n\nJohnson x Martins (8/10)\nHenrique x Bhullar (2/10)\n\nClarke x White (8/10)\nTucker x Glenn (4/10)\nMoras x Evans (5/10)\nMcMann x Vieira (5/10)\n\nStephens x Melendez (5/10)\nLatifi x Pedro (2/10)\nCejudo x Reis (8/10)\nMagny x Anjos (6/10)\nNunes x Shevshen (2/10)
Valentina didn't show the fight of champion. Its not enough!
How Valentina lost this fight I'll never know...she out struck Nunes....like Dana White always said never leave it in the judges hands.
Nunes was 1-0 up in terms of their rivalry.she had less to lose. Even if nunes lost, it would have been a draw so she really just had to control the fight & avoid major damage.Valentina lost her chance. E.g Conor vs Nate... conor came back and won making it a draw.
Valentina lost you idiots because to take a title away from a champion you have to put on a convincing performance.  If you don't then the champion always get the benefit of the doubt in situations like these.  If she actually went for it and fought instead of engaging in a sparring session the whole fight then it would be a different story.
Valentina, never leave it in the hands of the judges. To win a title fight you need to knock out or submit your opponent. You did not do that so stop whining!!!!
I don't hate Amanda for this it's the judges fault absolutely disgusting obviously picking nunes because she black & a lesbian it's this generations wet dream me & shevchenko would gun all you antifa black lives matter down with explosive rounds then me & shevchenko will fornicate for hours on end
Greatest fighter is only Valentina...love u
Niel magney beat Kevin gastelum a guy who is exstremely talented and gave woodley split. And look what RDA did to him. I know mma math dosent work that way but still. RDA at WW is pretty damn impresive in POST USADA era.
Sue their ass,Valentina,fuck UFC,mafia scum!
How did schevschenko win? Amanda was the one constantly coming forward and she was backing up the whole fight. At some point the crowd was even boing. It was because of her.
Mad respect for Danny

It's important to keep in mind that just because we search for something, doesn't mean it's the truth about us. For example, I don't think people regret having their kids just because they type that search term. Perhaps someone is having doubt and searches the Internet for like-minded people just to feel re-assured that it is OK to have those doubts.

I think Aragog came from Newt...he mentions coming from inside the pocket of a traveler. I think Newt is the traveler. I mean, who would have an Acromantula in their pocket? lol
I REALLY HOPE THIS HAPPENS!!!!!!!!!!!!
whats the chemical on your shirt?
YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR INTRO
The books tell you what happened this isn't necessary
I literally didn't even notice the umbrella was pink...
Ben, caffeine belongs in your coffee not on your shirt. Lol
Assuming that it is Rex, can you do a video about how he ended up in Wall-E's collection? It could make quite the sad story.
Also a friend of mine ask me this how is cars born  after watching cars3
I used to really like these videos and then realised then I that you just use the material right off pottermore....
I love this theory!!!
You make it too difficult... Dumbledore knows due to legilimency that Hagrid didn't release the basalisk.  He knows Hagrid is being blamed for something he didn't do but can't change people's minds due to anti-giant bias.  So he has him kept on as groundskeeper and after himself obtaining the Elder wand, might have fixed it.  More likely however it is as his discussion with Ollivander states... He says that he still has the pieces to which Ollivander says he hopes he doesn't use them, to which Hagrid fumbles at the umbrella.
If Newt was expelled, how come his wand wasn't snapped?
but dumbledore wouldnt be able to fix it because as in another theory you proved that grindelwald wasnt the true master of the wand which would explain why he and voldemort lost duels
W-what the heck you have facial hair now
Harry didn't win elder wand from voldemort... he won from draco malfoy
Harry did not win it from Voldemort. He won it from Draco Malfoy
Hey! Did you guys know that sir Cadogan (or whatever) CAN actually be spotted in the prisoners of azkaban(movie) when the fat lady portrait is broken. You guys should make a video about it!
That would make so much sense
Pausing at 42 seconds.\n\nDumbledore it's alwayse deus ex dumbledore.\n\nI so hope I right making this WAG.
I came up with this theory like 2 years ago I mean you just had to connect the dots in the books.
But if newt has already beaten grindlewald with his beasts could that mean newt is the master of the elder wand and neither Harry or dumbledore have ever been the masters
Could you do another zootopia video?
personally i like the thought that Hagrid is just accidentally amazing at wandless magic.\n\nMagic is all about intent. Because Hagrid THINKS he wand still works, it does.\n\nBit silly yeah but i find it amusing
OI!  READ THE END OF FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM!  ABOUT THE AUTHOR!  IT MENTIONS HIS WIFE PORPENTINE \nJust thought youd like to know
Have you ever thought that your theories are correct until you post a video out the theory? Exec producer: Well we can't use that idea any more because someone just figured it out.
💥💥💥 *mind blown*💥💥💥\nYou have No idea how happy watching this video made me. It filled in so many blanks n got me super pumped for Fantastic beasts!!! 😄😄😄\nUr awesome!
Please tell me the truth about OLAF in FROZEN
Why do we never see any magical patronus animals throughout the series? We see a phoenix from Dumbledore, but how come no students or teachers have magical creature patroni?
I always wondered\nWhat was hagrid's house when he was a student
Hagrid was 13/14 when expelled. Not 15. He was a third year. So unless he was held back...
If Dumbledore was born in 1881, and the happening with Ariana was when Dumbledore just had finished his school (1898/99)– how is it possible, that the legendary battle between him and Grindelwald was in 1945 (Dude, that sentence...)\n\nReminder, after the sudden death of Ariana, Dumbledore struggled with himself around 5 years to fought Grindelwald, until the community literally forced him to. (Because he feared the chance, to find out, that he killed his own sister with his very own curse).\n\nSo, the battle must've been round about 1903/04. Or did I miscalculate?\n\nP.S.: Sry for my bad Grammar. My English sucks.. ^^
It's also possible that Grindlewald loses mastery of the elder wand before the duel, or that Dumbledor knows a trick to defeating the master of the elder wand. After all, the invisibility cloak is another deathly hallow and supposedly completely hides its wearer, even from death, but Dumbledor knew exactly where he was. Dumbledor believes that these items, elder wand included, are not really what they are said to be, but simply very powerful magical items. Thus, the elder wand is not impossible to beat, just imbues its master with a lot more power, making them a lot harder to beat. Therefor, all Dumbledor need do is be clever about it and also be powerful himself by a wide enough margin to make-up the difference. He defeats Grindlewald, becomes the owner of the wand and fixes Hagrid's wand.
Loving the Woody and Buzz toys in the background by the way
I just thought that Dumbledore secretly fixed Hagrid's wand with the elder wand because he knew that Hagrid had nothing to do with the incidents.
I just realized Quidditch teams could just go to the room of requirement and get a bunch of steroids and firebolts.
If your names not j k Rowling hen your theory is bs! And her and warner bros sue any one who tries to monetise off of Harry Potter
What a cool theory I hope this is right
Fantastic theory! I really hope it's right
Are you guys Christians
omg this my first vid watching a vid of yours in 2017
I've thought Dumbledore repaired hayride wand for a long time
what house was Hagrid in?
3:58 Wasn't Hagrid expelled in his 3rd year? I'm pretty sure he stated in the first book that he was expelled in his third year.
I would absolutely love to see a young Hagrid. And a scenario like this would be great. It would explain so much and add such depth to Hagrid's character.
in case you didn't know there is a place in Switzerland called Grindelwald. just if you wanted that, then your welcome. however if you already knew it then... just checking.
How is Hagrid fifteen when he is in his third year? 3:54
This is a great theory and I definitely hope we will get to see the duel in the movies, hopefully in the last one, but you have made one mistake, or rather not explained an apearent mistake by the books. If Grindelwald was not the master of the elder wand because he was defeated before his duel with Dumbledore, how come Dumbledore became the master of the elder wand after he beat Grindelwald. I wouldn´t even mind this plothole so much, except it is almost the same idea THE CLIMAX OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES IS RESULTED BY!
You just really destroyed my fantastic beasts experience...as if this theory is happens to be true..then I have already got the spoilers😔😔
Before I watch the video... Dumbledore is the owner of the elder wand. Having suspicions about tom riddle...dumbledore simply repairs the wand for Hagrid and continues to teach him magic in spare time over the years (we all know Dumbledore doesn't really value the ministry of magic's laws)...he could have easily aided Hagrid in concealing his wand and repairing it.
If anything remotely close to this makes it's way into the fantastic beasts franchise, you should get paid.
Cool theory, but unfortunately you don't know transfiguration. First of all, no matter how good the transfigurator is, the transfigured object can't stay in the new form forever, sooner or later it'll change back. Second of all, magic objects are non-transfigurable.
Am I the only one who says duel like dew-e-l not dool
This is a great theory!!!!
thats truly a great and exciting theory !!!
I got a cherry wood wand, 14 and a half inches, phoenix core. I'm quite happy with it. =)
can you please please please do a video about how tom riddle wasn't an obscurial!!!!!!!
I was wondering do you reckon a basilisk would make an appearance in fantastic beasts and where to find them
Caffeine. His shirt is the molecular structure of caffeine.
What does his shirt mean
I want this to be true so bad
Answer. He got another wand....... Harry's wand broke. He just used another wand. I'm sure Dumbledore was able to pull some strings and get him and somewhat ok wand.
Try connect all HP theories in one vid. Do they line up? I have no idea 😂
Wait wasn't Hagrid in his third year when he was expelled? Shouldn't that have made him 13, not 15? Or did he start school at a later age?
jesus christ this guys annoying
phoeinx? a gift from Newt Scamander?
Dumbledore repaired hagrids wand with the elder wand
AND SISTERS
What if Dumbel fixed Hagreds wand
Omg I love this theory
hi j and ben i was wondering if you guys would ever start doing percy jackson and other rick riordan book videos.
i bet newt is hagrid's father
Hi Love this video 💖 I have an amazing idea for a new series that you should both watch Once Upon A Time which is on Netflix ❤️

Didn't see the lyrics change coming but they really fit the song. 30 years later and Bullet the Blue Sky is more relevant than ever
 Vaporized in a single tweet\nLights are on, The Presidents home..\nOMG.. I've never felt so alone...!!! 
Larry Mullen Jnr. - the man who has made an art form of looking disinterested.
I love U2 and this performance was too powerful... I'm impressed
part of me is sad that this song is still so relevant.
Absolutely insane to hear this song played against a backdrop of Trump vs Kim playing their little emperor game
Still the Best Band on the planet 👌🏻\n\nBrilliant performance 👍🏻\nSuch a heavy sound \nThis is the U2 I love and miss 👌🏻\nU2 are still relevant 40 years later 😊\nPlease go back to writing Songs that kicked arse and sent a message to the world, There new manager is trying too hard to please this reality pop star generation with there new albums and play it safe pop sound, personally don't think Paul Mcguinnes would of allowed a lot of it to happen, would of told them to go for it  and keep kicking arse with the heavy music.\nHoping Songs of Experience is a great Rock album 🙏🏻\nI can't wait to see the boys live again 😊👍🏻
This is absolutely a cultural moment into which U2 can declare that the Emperor has no clothes.
The only band vocalising through music what's going on in the world today. Where are todays generation of musicians? Their head up their ass, only interested in money and being a celebrity. Most of todays music scene is a sick joke ignorant of the world. Record label creations to make money. Sad. When U2 ends, that will be the day the music dies.
FN ROCKIN
Perfect Song for whats going on Now
Thumbs up if you're listening to this song from 1987 in the year 2017
nazi groupe
2:14 there's a keyboard player they were trying to keep off-camera. Wonder what the keyboardist was playing?
Disses Trump but praises Merkel.  Talks about protecting children.  One has kids, the other doesn't.  Enough said.
Meh

Sounds like the audio mix is off....
Trying to play a Network's YouTube video in 1080 to no avail. No - not my connecton problem, but a sad state of affairs for technology. Video technology hasn't improved in the past few years. Embarrassing - - -
The tree of pain that's a great lyric. bono doesn't write like that anymore
music is the media for the message
Damn! And that ladies and gentleman is how it's done!
4 legends. Continue to make me so proud to be Irish ❤❤🇮🇪
This song still rips, 30 years later!
Stop being a BROWN NOSER
1987=2017
WOW!
This is why they ARE the best band ever !!!!!!!!!!!
Old skool but How refreshing to hear rock music compared to all the junk of late
thank god for this band existing in the world
Not the best version of Bullet. Last really good version was on the Elevation tour.
I love the guitar Edge brings to this
Great to see Bono remembers The Roots added the same snippet from War to Bullet the Blue Sky as they played it for him when he was receiving his NAACP award.
Amazing full stop.
That was really good
Hey Bono where were you when Obama was dropping more bombs than just about any President in history...oh that's right...he's a leftist so he gets a pass...carry on everyone. :)
Bono looks like Michael  Myers during the guitar solo! Lol
Holy crap - that was a kick ass version of one of their best!  I can't count how many times I've listened to this song - and each time I stop what what I'm doing and let that screaming guitar and drum beat wash all over me.
Viva EL SALVADORRRRR
Holy Shit! Bono got OLD, LIKE OVERNIGHT! \n(Before anyone goes apeshitballs on me)\nThey STILL OWN IT!  Score one for the old people! Yes!
If U2 speaking out about Conservative ideology bothers you, let me remind you that's been their whole career since day 1.
Absolutely fucking incredible. They may be a Marmite group but they are the soundtrack to my life and this is why.
lol
Fucking amazing 👊🏻👊🏻
This gave me chills
Still great. Still powerful.
Fucking awesome!
those 72 dislike are Trump Zombies
Amazing!!!
Jimmy's enthusiasm is a bit of annoying sometimes :\
One of their best TV performances.
they rocked it
mullen needs to piss that snare off quick smart.
Love U2. Interesting take on the song. As someone who voted for neither Trump or CLinton, the war mongering would be exactly the same under Clinton as Trump. Two peas in a pod. Feed the war machine. Make money for the military industry.
Wow there's something brilliantly bizarre about them performing this most dangerous of songs on a nice little cozy chat show! Bet the audience never knew what hit them...they probably expecting Beautiful Day or Sweetest Thing!!
Nice improv on Kim and Trump.
That guitar solo still gets me. Fucking amazing slide work by Mr. Edge.
THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL SONG FITTING PROFOUND ,DELIVERING A MESSAGE PROPHETIC
Dammit... this was a FINE performance !!!  \nIn a tiny theater, yet with the same power of a stadium of 70,000.   \nI like what Bono says....  IN MUSIC !!!    Other than that ?  Well...  I love what he *does* for the World !!!  But I'd rather hear him sing about it than talk about it.
3:46 with the spotlight washout. That's U2!  You don't see the body, only the soul.
what a wonderfull performance!! still rocking after 30 years! I'm really excited to see them on October 4th and listen the entire Joshua Tree
a good band puts out good music. a great band sounds as great or better live, than they do on the recording.
great performance. you could tell the anger in Bono's voice, especially when he go to the part where he is giving Trump a piece of his mind!!! Classic!
Classic U2! Surprisingly impressive that he can hit those high notes in the chorus so perfect live...
The update spoken lyrics about Trump and Refugees were simply amazing! It gave me goosebumps that for a long time I hadn't had with U2's music.
Reminds me of The Throbbe by Ozric Tentacles (/watch?v=-sb2groGpFU)
WOW! To perform this song on national tv the way they did, AWESOME!
WooW !!! Cool song ! Grate performance every thing grate !!! And The Sound so fkn powerful on a talkshow Thanks a lot !!!
Friends of Soros
That is exactly what I want from u2.\nA little piss in their step.\nI like it.
This is truly one of their very best songs. It's never gotten old. Oh if only I could see them!
1987 was there for the start of Joshua Tree tour and  was there for the filming Rattle and Hum film at Tempe AZ ASU stadium and will be see them again 2017 September in Glendale AZ.
They brought the arena to the TV studio like no one else can.
Conor McGregor = Bono        Swag, Dublin, Ireland
The Edge literally tells an entire story with his guitar this entire song. Fighter Jets, sirens, Saxophones and all!

amazing
Chills
Poetry in motion!
That was bloody awesome!
Great
57 años y con esa voz!! Bono eres grande entre los grandes!!!! U2... ROCK IS NOOOOT DEAD!!!
Holy shit it built up very well. The change in lyrics didn't seem awkward at all. Those were fit really well!
I was thinking all day about this song... dude it's simply awesome
Bono still is the best
Such a great band!
Fuck yeah what a performance!!! This song is what got me hooked on their music and its great to see that they can still perform it amazingly! Can't wait to hear the new album. Also Jimmy seems to be a big fan of them lol
Still good, just not as good as they used to be, i just don't like how he changed like 75% of the lyrics
Why Jimmy is screaming? Chill out man!!
They are as old as my dad. But they can still freaking rock!
Sunday Bloody Sunday is great and stuff... but this is still my fave angry political U2 song
Great song! U2 DNA still in progress... Fantástico, como sempre. Parabéns!
War? What is it good for? Well, let's see. How about so you guys can write a song criticizing it and make tons of money off of it?
I don`t get why there is a section of (so called) music fans who feel so negatively towards U2. This is an indisputably great performance from a stone cold classic album. Maybe the hipster twats think they`re uncool because they don`t live the `rock n` roll` lifestyle or they always overshadow whatever crap indie band are the flavour of the month. Whatever the reason, they`re wrong. U2 ARE one of the greats
yes get on your knees and grovel some more Fallon, I swear if you look up sycophant in Websters there's Jimmy grinning like the sweet charmer he is.  OMG OMG You're the best!!  I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!
Wow!!!! Now that is U2!!! Where the fuck have you fellas been??? Welcome back!!! Thank fuck!!! That was fucking awesome!!!
If they don't perform this at a concert, is it even a U2 concert?
Just retire please
They need to stick to playing their old and irrelevant rehashed music, nothing worse than 60+ y/o rich as fuck soft rock musicians who are not even American talking shit about American politics. Remember guys in rock bands back in high school? Are these the guys that you really want to hear spouting political opinions? These were the guys that were usually too stoned to stay awake during civics class.
Simply spectacular
George Michael was a precious gift to human kind. A musical genius -phenomenal singer, songwriter, composer, arranger & producer. I wish we could have some new music from George but this Remake is undoubtedly a pleasant surprise. Thank you George for the music! Thanks Nile Rodgers & everyone who brought this out!
Me and my family be celebrating your life on Christmas day the day you left us miss you xx
While this is not my favourite song of mine of the late and wonderful George , to say its shite is not only untrue but very disrespectful of George's legacy and disrespectful of the talent of Nile Rodgers also. It's a good, funky song, and a damn sight better than most of the junk around the charts these days.
why is these so much spam on this comment page  ??
I cried because I thought his songs were never coming. I'm so happy.
It's a grower  - George would have appreciated this pun - bless him x
Fantastic is like a dream
Great great great! Most unboring artist! Musically, physically et all
This is one of my most favorite of George's songs. Miss you George.
Keep on picking it up Great job with the rework on this track. Love it!
the more I listen this the more I like it
So good to hear Georges voice in such a remarkable way ..♡♡♡♡ love it..
This is not a new song. This was a B-Side from 1992.
Thank you for publicizing this track and making it possible for George Michael's fans to hear what he was working on. I listen to his music every day and I still tear up and cry (when I hear his voice) because I miss him so much. The world is a better place because of GM. I guess the old adage that 'only the good die young' is true. George Michael; a once in a lifetime treasure. <3
Miss YOU and Your beautiful voice , it's gonna be strange in 2 Months to hear last Christmas
And it is not over, it will surprise us again.\nGeorge we remember you so, happy and not sad. Because you're genial
feels like hes back///wow///'who releases his new CD? miss him !!
this is the first time that i feel nile rodgers did a realy bad job. this remake has no energy at all, the drums have no punch, the vocals are so overcompressed, just that funky guitar all over the place. \nthe original was so much more fun, with its rattling drumloop and the weirdo synth-brass. as you could maybe pick-up in videos, george was a heck of a producer and so very much in every detail, he never failed to amaze.

Has anyone picked up anything in the lights in the windows in the buildings?
10006th time. I can make you happy if only for a while
George has much better tracks than this sitting in the vault.... release them !
I love the original version and love what George and Nile have done with the remix. Listening to interviews etc. he had done during his career, I always got the impression he loved to move forward with his music and wasn't scared to try new things. I particularly loved, towards the end of the recording, when he does that little petulant sigh after he sings the line I may be in the next state; so clever, so Georgex
Is this a newly discovered vocal found in the vaults of his past recordings, or is it a reworking of his vocal from the original track from the '90s?  If it's a reworking of the original, I'm not a fan of how, at different points, they messed with George's vocal on this compared to the original. His voice sounds less robust, and, when he hits the Fantasy high note his vocal sounds a bit more coarse and not as clear as compared to the 90s version of Fantasy, which, I must say, I like better.

Great tune! Miss GM so much :(
GREAT JOB NILE!!  I love this song.  It was good to hear George's voice again as well.  Hopefully some new stuff will be coming soon.
I love it!! Tank you M. Nile
Like this version better. Glad I'm not hearing obnoxious horns in this one.
Love it. Funky track. Love you George ❤
Just makes me feel sadder....Sounds nice but like it should be on Faith....Would rather George was alive and making new songs.....But thank you all involved for this....x
Good production, not sure that's how George would have done it, but good anyway!
Is this love or invention...............?
...and David Austen...you're a star...no wonder Yog loved you so much... And Yioda and Melanie thank you for allowing us the pleasure of listening to new George...a true beautiful Greek family xxx
Thank you so much to Nile, David, George's family & team for this. When hearing this I felt a liitle bit of the excitement that I used to feel with each new George's recording. But it's not the same.  I know music is here to enjoy and that was George's intention but my heart is still heavy... I need more time. Well, I will place an order for the LWP & MTV Unplugged though... I have them on cassette and VHS only :-)
Can't get enough of this.   No one sings it better than George. Miss you so much  😢👊💥❤🌟 this is GOLD
Sorry to burst your bubble, but this is an old song re-recorded with a Nile Rodgers riff added.
Guilty feet have got no rhythm.

Miss you George Michael u made me who I am
Sounds like remixed cr@p to me. I had thought that Nile Rodgers would have been able to do more with this old mediocre 'B side'. Are they going to release any of these 3 new albums we've heard of?. \nOr else, release 'Love is a losing game' or 'Russian roulette'. Those tracks weren't on the live Symphonica album.
Very different but good! Thanks Nile. George's voice is like gold. Missing and loving you always. 😚😔
God, I miss him!!! That voice!!
George Micheal is dead... this is so creepy I'm scared 😢
I miss you George!!!!!I love you Forever!!!
I've followed George Michael's career since 1984 .In the early days I bought every release on 7 inch for the house and on cassette for my car.I remember buying waiting for that day when it was released and after playing it I turned over to the b side to play having never heard of fantasy.I remember the first 3 clicks of the song before it kicked in.the first thing I thought after the first hearing was,what a waste for a b side.this would have hit no 1 no problem instead of the no 23 which waiting for that day reached.I'm so pleased it's finally reached its audience and showed how awesome this man was.is this as good as the original.No,but there's no dance track that every will be,but this new version is still stunning.Why? because it's George reminding us all how nobody could write,produce and sing like him.I miss him terribly and I'm so thankfully to his family,Nile Rogers and David Austin for putting this out and showing all these so called pop stars how it music should be done.Thank you for saving my life through your music George.R.I.P.
Love the original better. This version is ok? ☺️

This is so damn good.... Number 1 hit and if not something is wrong
George's voice is on point, flawless but that mickey mouse voice is annoying.
Goes to show you can't polish a turd. Don't like either version.
Ehm... why is George's singing clipping? It's not like that on the original -87 version. You ruined it :(
I'm so confused he passed away how can he write a song like WHAT
So many brits pretending to be americans.
*_The Game is On!!_*
nicholas hoult is a super underrated actor. definitely excited to see him in this!
I fix problems for idiots.\nI'm sold.\nand why do this trailer looks like a superhero movie??
The film should be about TESLA, featuring Edison. Not the other way around. Edison didn't even invent the light bulb.   He just purchased the patent and had some interns perfect it. Wasn't even an actual inventor at all.
This is how you make a trailer - go the extra mile to show the parts of this particular story no one is really excited about, as if it WAS exciting (the dick and the largely forgotten mogul who was more interesting that people even know), infuriating everyone who knows who else was involved and how it all turned out, and then BAM! - the Internet's science crush drops the mike. The crowd roars.
anyone else getting a There Will Be Blood vibe?
I was wondering when Tesla was going to show up in a movie about the AC/DC dispute.
Finally..!
Bendthedick Condomsnap
Ben portraying another genius? Yes, please!
IM WAITING THIS MOVIE FOR A LONG TIME, BUT WHY TOM HOLLAND BE NIKOLA TESLA . I HOPE HE DONT RUIN THE CHAR
Except Tesla was nothing like that. They stole everything they knew about electricity from him.
long awaiting for this story to be come in movies.....great job
don't tell me an elephant will sing by the end of the movie\n\n\n\n\n\nwell not exactly sing but screech during it's death throws
looks...deLIGHTful...see what i did there?
you can still tell it's his voice even though he hasn't got the accent
Lmfao about 3/4 through the trailer I was like this looks great but it'd be better if Tesla was in it too. This looks phenomenal.
Now there's a movie I never knew I wanted to see
That background score made it sound like a Bollywood movie trailer.
I'm a simple woman. I see Benedict Cumberbatch, I click.
Yet another movie in which our beloved Cumberbatch plays a genius.
Edison is a thieving, lying, piece of shit.
The curent war was a big deal. I'm happy they make a movie about it. Though the Tesla could have been saved for the theaters...
Telsa was so underrated in US history.  Edison took credit for his brilliance.  This movie looks awesome and its even more awesome how they make Telsa the bad ass of the film bc he was the one who changed the world.
Why can't we have a Tesla movie instead srsly
Quick note, Edison did not invent the light bulb
did just Nicolas tesla tell both of them idiots
First thought: No Tesla. Suddenly... Tesla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell played.
How about a movie on Nikola  Tesla
Country circuit between visit writer joke violate honor.
Edison's one of the world worst dickheads in history, stealing others ideas and making its own. Nicolas Tesla by example. Fuck this movie. But I still respect mr. Cumberbath
Yes! I love movies with Bendelsnatch Cringleton! I mean Bendersnath Combertash! You know the guy I mean..
So it's a three-way fight between Edison, Tesla and who's the third one.
I got tingles when they announced Tesla...
If it has Benedict cumberbatch I'm watching xx
Isn't it interesting that today we use Edison's DC and Tesla's AC all the time, but for different purposes? Could AC work inside your mobile phone? Could DC be used to power a city? Possibly, but it would be a totally different world now.
Has anybody's reputation been more trashed than Thomas Edison?  I'm not saying it's inaccurate just that there's a surprising amount of media about him being a bigger jerk than Tesla
Wow man Tesla is there ,oh man last entry but epic entry !!!!!!
Oh, what a current!  WHAT A LOVELY CURRENT!
Seems like Edison was enemies with everyone
I see Benedict on the thumbnail--  yep.
So, Doctor Strange and Spider Man go against General Zod. Oh, and Beast shows up at the end.
The guy playing Westinghouse was the guy in Revolutionary Road with Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio- I just figured that out!
Was wondering when Tesla would show up. Wonder how they'll manage to glorify Edison with Tesla in the story, if they stick to telling the truth!
Nikola tesla should have been the main role in the film... Not the cheater edison the plagiarist.
Really was about to give a thumbsdown & a comment on how Edison is a douchebag (check the Oatmeal comic) and then Tesla made an entrance :-)
At last Electrical Engineers will have their moment.... Lol
i love benedict but i'm team tesla here
Meanwhile everyone outside of Murica knows Joseph Swan really invented the light bulb. 30 years later Edison would take Swans design and merely improve the filament.
First Wind River, starring Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye. Now this, starring Dr. Strange and Spider-man
Here's hoping the soundtrack will be by AC/DC ...
Ahh, Tesla. They caught the good ol' Balkan mentality in the end of the trailer!
Tesla🚗🔌🔋🚗🔌🔋🚗🔌🔋 Yes
Tesla > Edison
Is Westinghouse Zod?
Go Tesla !
Needs more Tesla!
Reminds me of the Prestige.
Tesla V Edison: Dawn of Electric
Tesla Coils can kill enemy soldiers and destroy tanks and will keep you military bases safe...\n\nUnless they damage you power stations.
Election like sensitive flood instance cut.
Didn't think I would like this, Edison been serious crook and all, but nice save with Tesla at the end.
Employ merely hospital cholesterol musical table pink limb alternative.
Parker? Doctor Strange needs your help to change a light bulb. Oh and to fix the washing machine
If its about Nikola Tesla, then I'll watch it. Edison was 99% hype.
who else here because Tom Holland?
Thomas Edison was a fraud and a thief, stealing other people's ideas and claiming it as his own.
Benedict always has to play a genius doesn't he...
So We have Dr Strange, Spider-Man and Beast will they gonna kill General Zod  ?
Cool.. ye na h movie
The Globalist (fanmade apocalyptic version): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR5VcP7A6B0
*GENERAL ZOD V DOCTOR STRANGE Trailer (2019)*
Nikola Tesla. No more, no less.
They set up this trailer almost like a superhero film. EDISON V WESTINGHOUSE - BUT THEN DRAMATIC REVEAL OF TESLA, INTRODUCED BY SPEAKING A FUNNY ONE-LINER.
Since when did Doc Strange, Spidey, zod and beast travel back in time to invent electricity???
Should've named the movie AC/DC, get it?\n\n\n\nI'm so lonely...
Benedict? Great!\nEdison? Meh..I'll just pass this one.
They finally do movie from Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure by jbern)))
This is what was much desired!
I hope they put in how Tesla was huge advocate for Eugenics. Why solve problems for idiots when you can just eradicate them? Stop slobbering.
AC vs DC War
FUCK Thomas Edison.
They'll say 'aw, Topsy' at my autopsy. #JusticeForTopsy
Did Benedict turn into Pierce Brosnan without anyone noticing?
woah crap. I couldnt recognize Nicholas Hault with the hair and stache. cool
Is it AC/DC ?
Tesla > Edison
zod vs strange
About time...
FFS WHAT ABOUT TESLA
Magic blend horn bottom accuse store belly etc promising.
Einstein True Genius
Batman v. Superman for physicists
Nikola Tesla...
Wasn't Edison Deaf!
Cant wait to see
I fix problem for idiots. Nuff said, Tesla is pure badass.
Why is Benedict not Tesla.. WTF!!!!!   (/O_O)/
I don't know if its just me, but the content is getting like a lot of the same, but huge amounts of advertising for the kids stuff you've created.. I just feel like I'm growing out of this channel, and I don't like that :( I wish the content was enjoyable for people who don't have kids/are kids. I know that's my problem, but well, that's the reason why I'm not watching the videos anymore and will unsubscribe.. I'm sorry guys :( i've followed you for years..
Lovely singing Emilia! I was touched. Our God is a GreatBig God all the time. It's so refreshing to learn that schools are still  teaching our kids about the goodness of  God .
aw eduardo looks so grown up with his haircut x
Eduardo looks so cute with his hair😍
OMG when Emilia was singing are god has a whole wide world in his hands I remember the last time I sung that which was last year
Do Amelia and Eduardo go to a private school? There uniform looks very posh. 💗
Wise up... they're going to school not to jail...snow flakes
I'm homeschooled so when everyone goes back to school me and my mom go shopping and go for lunch because it's never busy then I start work the next day 😂😂
So they just never talked about how they live right there next to a cemetery.  They also walk through it all the time \n🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙈🙈🙈🙈
Emilia should have her own show. She is so funny and confident
Emelia is so grown up now! Feels like yesterday I was watching her baby vlogs. And Eduardo too😫 xx
No hate! I think Eduaro looks younger, intens, with his new hair cut😲
I think I tear up when Emilia was singing at the end. 💗
Our god is a great big GodOur god is a great big god Our god is a great big god And he holds us in his handsHe's higher than a skyscraper and Deeper than a submarine He is wider than the universe beyond my wildest dreamsAnd he loves me and holds me since before the world began. How wonderful to be apart of Gods amazing planOur god is a great big godOur god is a great big godOur god is a great big godAnd he holds us in his hands
I had to sing the song Emilia learnt when I went to primary. It was a long time ago but I still remember it. Bought back lots of memories for me :)
So cute <33333 Emilia is the CUTEST lil vlogger on youtube, I loved the beginning <33333
I'm a bata child 😂
Oh my gosh I remember singing that at my primary school!! Xx
I learnt that God song in primary school!!
Omg the blogs are so quiet without Emilia
Is Emilia going into kindergarten
Love all the videos\nI look up to u guys 💜💜💜
You were RIGHT!!  😧 This day will live in infamy!  👓  Anna just threw us under the bus..🤦🏻‍♀️ Lol
So Jonathan, when are you gonna get Alessia's name tattooed on your body?
OMG Emilia is a really good singer!!!
Oh my goodness I was CREASING at 8.25
Hi my name is Sacconejoly.  I exploit my children for cheap views and likes.
New Zealand school not even finished
I literally died laughing when you had that slo- mo and said today you got it right hahahaha
Alessia's getting so big watching her sit up is adorable
Emilia's singing is actually really good
The very first time I went to school I didn't even say bye to my parents I just ran off to play lol
That song Emilia was singing i remember singing it at primary school
Not being negative but you need to put the handle on the car seat up in the car, that helps protects the baby in a crash. 💗
I can tell that Emilia is going to be a great singer when she grows up
Hi I love your videos you all inspire me so much and you are amazing family x from leah hop you are all ok x
That was the day I Jonathan got it right .  So so funny the face
40 kids in a class... that is double what I had at school! I hope the kids have a fabulous first day back!
Expectation: Walking in a winter wonderland.\nReality: Walking through a cemetery.
Our GOD is a great BIG GOD.  That was lovely, Emilia!!!!
Ohhhhh Emilia & Eduardo looked so gooood in their uniform...Eduardo looks good with his haircut!!!!
Our god is a great big god 😂 Anyone else do that in primary school?
omg lol! the husband being right part i was crying laughing!!!
I wasn't the Beta child... i was the back up child haha!
Alessia has the most beautiful eyes 😍
Eduardo and his chocolate stars lol so cute!!!  😂
I reckon the clip that Jonathan was talking about filming was Anna's pregnancy announcement, that we'll see in a couple of months!! ;)
Awww...Emilia's little song was adorable. ❤️
you will love our brand new show. come on over to our channel and check it out. why not subscribe while your there. we guarantee to make you smile
It is a running joke in my family that as the first born I am the practice child.
That gay guy has 3 kids????????
Omg Emilia. Total fancy pants with the salmon on toast! 😂 (and so friggin cute!) 💕
Who else thinks that Emilia is really good at singing?
I'm the youngest of three but I made sure I wasn't forgotten about
Emilia and Eduardo are too cute when they vlog <3 <3
I've Got Over 2000 Students In My School....It Is Mayhem
Hahahahahahahahaha Jonathan !! You're bad lol, to funny❤️ love you guys
is it a permanent birthmark on alessia's forehead?
I'm a beta child lmfao and i've never even thought of it that way
eduardo is so georgous nice to see him fr a change
Emilia has changed so much over the summer, she has developed so much confidence with the camera and grownup too. You can understand mostly everything she says and I think she is going to be amazing as she grows with mummy's makeup and fashion sense and daddy's film making and camera/production talent. Our two went back on Wednesday this week to secondary school for the first time, goodness Anna that really was tear jerking !! My twins are 11 !!! Would really love to chat. You two as we have a small but building channel inspired by you guys, we are the oggie house, please get in touch. Xx
Emilia singing our God is a great big God... 😢😢i cried
Beautiful family!  We are new subscribers!
Does anyone else feel old at how grown up Eduardo looks😫😂😊
The part of the song Emilia was missing was and he holds us in his hands😂 I learnt that song when I was about her age too😂😂
I love Emilia's posh little accent. She'd be such a good vlogger.
well i'm going back to uni next week, gonna miss home 😆
I used to watch years ago and thought I'd check up. It is me or is Jonathan dominating everything? Anna barely gets to speak
was having a break from gardenscapes but I saw you playing it and now i have to play it!!!!
They have grown up so much xx
Omg, Emilia's uniform is killing me.  it's so cute!
THE INTRO IS SO CUTE! 😩😩🌹🌹🌹
and that was the day Jonathon was right .... hahahaha 😂
I was back a school a week ago
Omg Jonathan's voice over when he was right, ... so funny I loved that
She is the big sister xx
I started year 8 3 days ago
I'm the beta child!
I'm dying when Anna said you were right, I guess, your face!!!!! It's the same face my husband makes when I say that to him!!! I nearly peed my pants laughing!!!
I absolutely love the striped school dresses!! So cute Emilia!
Well I have been in school  since mid August so haha. #collegelife
Yay Johnathon was right! lol Enjoy it ;) Love you Anna!
Watching Emilia and Eduardo grow and develop personalities and character is so interesting and amazing to watch!
Emilia is such a good little singer!!!
The slow mo when jonathan is right hahaha dying
OMG WTF..
emilias voice when shes singin
Emilias voice is incredible (;
L
PImp My Family episode #765
Aww Emilia singing 💖💖💖
Im in p6
Cute :)
Eduardo: my tummy growling cos I'm hungry\nEmilia: that's whyyyyyyy!
Emilia is adorable 😂😍
alessia gets cuter every day :3
Emilia sings so well
My tummy growled aww
8:24😂🤣👍🏻🙌🏻
I'm really confused the U.K. Don't have Kindergarten isn't it called PreSchool???
How does this only have 4 million views
this is giving me some serious bey (pre lemonade) vibes...idk why
Allly's singing in this song reminds me of Nicole Scherzinger,
They did it again 😍 I fuck with this yeess
Why is this not getting alot of views??  Where ya at harmonizers
If they release a video for each song Im going to need more weaves cause they been making mine explode since 2012
I have a feeling this song is gonne be like write on me...forgotten. i hope not
Not a fan but this is their best song  since Camila left. Sadly it also has the most boring video (kinda reminds me of write on me). I don't know if I'm wrong but I think Deliver still isn't that much of a hit song
Wrong choice for a single
This song fits ally voice perfectly & the best 😍😍😍😍 💯💯💯
The video clip looks like pretty girl rock
BRIDGES AND DON'T SAY YOU LOVE ME HAVE TO BE NEXT
I hope DJ Keynote Speakaz produce a hit on their next album
Down,angel and he like that became quite famous and got more views because peeeps wanted to see the change without camila , well that didnt work well (their songs are so boring these days ?)
I think I prefer them without Camila. When she was in the group most of the attention was on her.
I love the early 2000's RnB vibes
Im sorry, but Ally seems out of place, she doesnt fit with the other :/
Mmmmm There's something wrong with Dinah's Make up...
I can't be the only one who got a little bit of Beyoncé vibes😂
you still got my favorite hoodie ad you need to give it back
Not trying to throw shade or be rude, but now that Camila Cabello left, shouldn't it be called 4th Harmony..... just saying 😂
Dinah is the new Camila, the power house
when ally tries to be camila
Was there when they were called the LYLAS and 1432, xfactor 2012 ;-;
I see some sparkle vibes here .... that jordan sparks movie with whitney huston
i love you so much fifth harmony so dont stop making beautiful and good music............
Who did allys makeup....that lipstick is so amateur, you can see her lips through it at the edges. That person needs to be fired lol failllll
Can we get the hashtag carpoolkaraokewith5h trending cuz we need that from them and us harmonizers got them a vma performance so we need this to🤘🏾😁
I like this song 😅
How come no one talks about Dinah
I like this song its good keep up the work girls
ALLY and Lauren 😍😍😘💖
I'm an official Harmonizer! Love these girls!!!😘😍💯
If you love the song wonderful. Stop looking for reasons to bring up Camilla. She has her career that has nothing to do with 5H. I'm not some triggered fan, but on every song they have there's always someone that says So glad Camilla's gone! If you are good for you, but it's irrelevant.
Awesome song fifth harmony! Ooh how about we get this to 10 million views first people? LETS GO!
Please let the next one be don't say you love me
After that recent song, He Like That or something. This is the best song and the whole outfit along with hair is GORGEOUS
how is that just have 4 million views?
Why do people constantly compare their new work to Camila's work now?! The important things is that all of them were in a group doing music they did not want to do. Now they are all doing music they like and rock to. As an artists, they are content with their products so leave it at that. Sheesh.
I'm getting Keri Hilson pretty girl rock .
I just became a big fan omg
Normani you bitchhh😫🤤🤤 she's such a queen damn
I love you fifth harmony
I can't wait for Normani and Khalid's new songg. I already know it gon be lit.

HELLO FRIENDS!! hope u guys enjoy this strange franken-video! how do u guys think it did? i wanna make more!!
this is my first time watching Safiya's videos and I love her personality omg
The erotic music killed me 😂
In the last minutes of video, it is so funny to see Tyler reacting to your face and hair! LOL!
Person: I love your foundation! What brand is that?\nSaf: What brand isn't it?
Your eyeliner didn't even move ! What eyeliner is it ?! Lmao
Hey you need to wax your arms please I'm not tryna be rude
Me and her have the same skin tone cool
It looks so good xx
Why are all Caucasian foundations yellow or orange. Isn't there pink tones?
Is her last name pronounced niggered? Don't get triggered.
You remind me of my technology teacher...
I feel like you get all yellow under tones and from what I see your undertone is more pink.
You should see if a fenty shade would work for you.
4:52 lmao this part i love it
I'm a free lance makeup artist and I mix 4 foundations to get my perfect formula/colour! I knew this video was gonna be successful
I think you can only successful mix together cream products... Try cream highlighters!
I have a aunt named Safiya xD
Why does she make all this stuff if she's not gonna use them again
Not to be rude but her skin is soo shiny and it's gross ew
Tbh you looked great in that franken-dation and franken-lipstick. Of course you're still gorgeous without, but I am very impressed with the results!
Next mix all of your blushes
I love these videos!  Can you please do a highlighter one and a contour one please! I love your to YouTube channel and can't wait to see more and more of your videos in the future💗💗💗💗
MIX A BUNCH OF LIQUID EYELINERS
Hey! Can I know what's that App called which u showed in the starting!😊
Can you mix all your eyeshadows together
I feel as though the flaw here will be that you will also get all the negative aspects of each foundation mixed...
Maybe she should try scraping abit of all her eye shadows and press it into one colour and use it? Or highlighter
Hi, is there any small youtubers want to support each other? 😋
you should do this without bb and cc creams and skin tints or do a just drugstore one
I hope buzzfeed would not steal the idea of this video. Just like themixing of lipsticks .
It matches you perfectly keep using it
Hi safiya can you please let me know where you got the bottle to mix your foundation and I've been looking for one like that for months and months please and thank you I love the video by the way you're an amazing person and I'm also from Chicago
*waits for buzzfeed's video about the exact same thing*
It's a little on the (adjective) side
we have the same name! hi, safiya 😂💕
You are so pretty and your eyeliner is so perfecccctttt!!!!! 💜💜
You should make loads of bottles and sell them to us, seems like a pretty damn good foundation!!
Every time you say the word smash incorrectly a puppy dies.
Wow you have a lot of foundation
Ok you should do eyebrows next. Like mix all your eyebrow things together so then you can have your face lips and eyebrows all mixed😂
I had a good experience with the makeup lady at Walgreens they had a machine thing that told me my shade and undertone
Everytime she rubs the foundation on the paper it hurts my soul. Have you ever starched paper?
Does anyone know what the container she is using is? and like where to get one?
The whole time I admired how perfect and symmetrical the eyeliner and wings were
Okay this is such a rude thing to say and that's not my intention, but your face is so shiny in this video.
Mix highlighter or countour or eyeliner or blush or concealer or powder or Eyeshadow pweessshh
Can you do a video where you get people's reaction to an all LED light up outfit ?! Love your vids BTW ! 💙
you have great arm hair! sexy! And your bushy eyebrows.. and ..
She has a monotonous voice
Try fenti foundation u might find the perfect shade
I like how your freckles show through, it's CUTEEEEEE
do a waxing video on your arms !!
I actually like the foundation and lipstick together
My little brother thought u put peanut butter on ur face
THE MOMENT BEFORE SHE SAID FRANKENSTATION I THOUGHT IT
This was awesome! So, you did nude lipsticks, how about some reds? :)
the nails on the paper, tho
you should do a franken-perfume.
I LIKE THE MIX!! Lol
Wow, it actually looks great. I'm shocked!
She needs to shave he arms
You should make your own makeup line of Frankenstein makeup
DO A FULL FACE OF MIXED TOGETHER PRODUCTS LIKE ALL YOUR FOUNDATION, CONCEALER, BRONZERS, MASCARA, ETC
Saf, you're so much more beautiful without makeup );
i don't like to throw things away either. I look at things before I throw them away.

You ever walk, or want to walk down a beach and see that either private property signs are posted, or maybe you have been told you have to leave, or you've had people who live on the beach tell you that it's a private beach, \n\nand think to yourself, \nFuck you, you rich arrogant cunts, I hope a Hurricane tears your fucking house into shit and your rich ass drowns \n\n'All I wanted to do was relax and enjoy God's creations and you rich pompous cunts lock it down with your fiat currency and automatically view me as a potential threat, piss on you fucking weirdos!'\n\nAnd if you don't submit/obey their Orders then you will be thrown in Jail...You didn't hurt anyone or property\nand they will kidnap you and throw you in a cage, and then try to extort money from you for some bullshit\nlike criminal trespassing, disturbing the peace, or disorderly conduct charges...\n\nNow tell me why I would or should feel sorry for them?? Or why they should expect or receive any help??
Some of these motherfuckers on YouTube are so ignorant. If you ain't got nothing nice to say then don't say shit at all. How do you tell somebody that you hope there hurricane wipes out their homes and everything else you better hope shit don't come back on you motherfukers
so basically EVERY prediction was wrong....yeah what else is new

I just think its a little bit sad how all this focus is on the potential danger to Florida (which is terrifying, btw) while Bahamas and Cuba got practically blown off the map and hardly get mentioned at all.
By far the best coverage of hurricane Irma is from CBS4 Miami. For future reference, the coverage could be better if they turn off the sound and keep a large picture of Rudabeh Shahbazi on the screen. That would be a lot more exciting than the boring wind and lack of common sense from the wet reporters.

You go girl!! Love from Canada!!!
Sending prayers that everything continues to go well for you. Beautiful as ever and anyone who doesn't understand can flop. I have to take Xanax and watch what I take with it.
I love u girl and all my prayers go out to you always your so strong and an inspiration to everyone around the world ❤️️❤️️❤️️
THEY CAN TAKE THEIR 6% Chemo remission and shove it up their ASS. MY cannabis oil has been 10000000% better and All Natural and Organic....
I know you mentioned you had the issue with the medication that caused your speech to get a little wacky but I just wanted to say that you really are improving!!!! Very quickly I might add too. Keep it up! You will get where you want to be soon! You can really hear the improvement in this video!!!!!!!!!!!!! 💗
Glad your doing better. We need to get you a Tennessee Volunteer hat though.  Lol. That Tiger hat doesn't go with your background .
That sucks! Glad it wasn't a severe reaction. I also have issues with most meds, so first I try a natural approach and if that doesn't help, I take the meds lol. Not sure what you can do for anxiety, but when I'm really stressed or can't sleep, l use a headache balm from Badger (I massage my neck muscles to help with headaches) and it really helps plus it smells good. Hope you feel better!
Modern medicine, too bad the pharmaceutical industry has been keeping the real cause & cure for cancer hidden. \nDo people even look for natural ways to heal themselves anymore?\nSorry for your plight, please stop the drugs in a controlled way.
You are inspiring. Sending love and prayers your way. New sub, thank you for sharing your journey.
Your such an insiprationn to people going through something like this !! Im currently going thru what your going through and yes its hard but we will get thru it😍😍❤️❤️
please watch my latest video and then do your own search about it\nwatch?v=IMunJYEkbkQ
I just want to say that I've been following your journey for some time now, and although I know some videos are edited, I want to applaud you for how far you have come. Although I've never been in your situation, I couldn't imagine how strong of a person you have to be, and I know that you have times where you get disappointed in yourself, I want you to know as an outsider how grateful I am of to share your story and to let other who are going through similar events that they're not alone and that we cannot allow these events in our life to stop us from doing what we love. So, from the bottom of my heart thank you!!P.S sorry if I seem like I am rambling, I just want you to truly understand how much of an amazing woman you are!
: : I have an allergic reaction to anti-depressants so in order to sleep well I take gabapetin (seizure medicine) which doesn't effect hormone/chemical levels but more neurons to sleep well at night and reduce anxiety. It is the only medicine that doesn't have an adverse reaction for me like you mentioned. I totally get it. I'm still thinking positive thoughts & prayers for you.  ; ): :
I know you like reading comments so I thought id leave you a sweet one! You are such an inspiration and one of my favorite youtubers. We can tell that you love what you do and im so proud of you for beating this cancer! Stay strong, ily!!
It's probably the mix with the xannax and the chemo pills.
Keep fighting girl!! You're AMAZING!!!
Every time you touch your chest you get a yellow mark then it goes away! Is that your skin type or a cemo thing? Xo
Your speech is amazing. Proud of you girl. X
You could try medical cannabis oil and also turmeric as it has many health benefits. If you inform about these things, maybe they can help you.
You should try medical marijuana for your anxiety 🤷🏻‍♀️
Courtelizz1 is the female version of Leonardo DiCaprio
I thought you were going to say that you would not take the chemo and the zanex at the same time. But maybe at least for the year that you still have to do the chemo pills. Hopefully after the year you won't need zanex anymore anyway. Remember to get your support systems going for when you're feeling down. I'm so glad to see you getting better all the time and figuring things out with a great attitude. ;)\nThe only time I ever felt like I was going slow was when I had a high fever as a child and I was delirious too. It was an awfully strange feeling and very scary.
Hey girl glad you're back to normal and your speech sounds great!!! Glad you got things sorted out! Xanax is super strong and does crazy things to a lot of people so don't feel bad! xo
Your speech is amazing in this video❤️it's come on so much and you speak so quickly it's so brilliant to hear!! If you're still feeling anxious maybe you could trying practicing CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) obviously just a suggestion and I definitely haven't gone through anything as traumatic as you but it has really helped me feel better and get my anxiety under control❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are amazing 💗
Hey just found your channel. Much respect for sharing your story. I wanted to extend myself as an outlet to answer any questions you may have about other people in similar situations being helped by medical grade tinctures derived from the cannabis plant. Sending positive vibes and a big hug! Keep fighting.
Good luck to you.  It's a shame Xanax didn't work for you, but good you figured it out so quickly.  As you said, everyone handles meds differently.  I was on anxiety meds throughout chemo and found them helpful, but I guess I was lucky that the particular med I took didn't interact with the particular kind of chemo I received.\n\nI can't believe the jerks saying not to take chemo, or that whatever snake oil they read about on Facebook would cure cancer.  Nobody without an MD has any business telling someone how to treat their cancer.
Your speech is amazing! You are doing so awesome! stay strong girl!!
This is why you should have to get a certificate to have any child...
Thanks for sharing! You are doing awesome!
Please research gcMAF.  It's a real cure for any autoimmune disease.  Just do the research before you dismiss it.  I've known ppl this has worked on.  It's been tested many times.  The only way it won't work is if you've had to much radiation already.  Peace and much love.
Your so brave!! Amazing!!! Be strong and keep up the determination!!!
Omg you poor thing! That sucks
Chemotherapy = poison to your body.  So yah. It will damage you.
Your speech has got better!
You're speech is so good in this video- you're doing amazing love!! Always praying for you ❤
Cancer is bad. I don't have cancer though or anxiety. Healthy privilege!
يا رب اشفها 🙌🏻🙏🏻
Thanks for sharing all your experiences its really interesting! Hope you get well :)
thank you for sharing this! thank you for making us aware about the negative effects of xanax. i also learned a lot from the comments. i have not taken any drugs for my mental health but it's better to know the possible side effects in case i will be needing some mental health drugs in the future because who knows... anyway you're such a strong beautiful girl! i will pray for you! God bless you! 🙏🙏🙏
you are so pretty with out make up and with make up be strong i will pray for you   take one day at a time  that how i live my life that all we can do   much love to you
Your speech is so dang good girl!! You're such an inspiration 💕
ur such a positive person. u give hope to those that need it. My mom is on hospice care from cancer. I love comin to see your good vibes
Omg currently im scared i have a tumor because my head feels fuul an i get throbbing right before bed and just noticed i have a flating dot in my vision but cant imagine yiur situation so prayers and thx for you and your openess!!
Ugh such natural beauty. Why this girl would think she needs makeup, idk! So jelly! :)
I'm also a young person who ended up getting cancer, and I can't believe how strong you are to put these videos out. You're helping a lot of people, and also yourself because these videos are obviously great practice for your speech because it's coming back really quickly!! Hopefully your reading is coming back soon too so you an read all of the supportive comments everyone has left you.
Your speech is actually sounding really good to me!
Have you looked into herbal alternatives to the meds and or herbs and teas for memory like goldenseal and such? I'm only saying because the human body tends to accept herbs instead of rejecting them, like there are natural alternatives to xanax and all ... Maybe worth looking into 😉 stay strong
CBD oil and some strains of marijuana  help with anxiety and may help with chemo side effects.

Thanks for sharing. I've been there, tough, but you're so positive. Awesome.
She's so pretty😍❤️sub if you agree
I regretted clicking on this video immediately after the first minute
You're such an amazing person x
Best wishes to you as you're going through this struggle.
Just wondering do you have a po box to send you something?
God has everything in CONTROL! You will be VICTORIOUS IN THE NAME OF JESUS!!
So glad you found out what the problem was pretty quickly! Gosh, your speech and personality are literally sounding 100%! I'm not surprised 💪🏻 but definitely so proud of you!!!
I am curious are you cutting out foods that are known to cause cancer!? have you watched What The Health!!!!!
your speech is amazing in this vid!!! always praying for you
I would highly recommend going to Dr John Bergman then going to Eric Dubay YouTube channels. It could change your life.
does she remind u of the blonde girl from good lucky charlie
I have 24/7 vertigo (rocking and swaying sensations) and just had an MRI to make sure it wasn't being caused by a tumor... It is truly horrifying what people have to go through (both young and old) due to medical conditions, some of which people don't realize affects very young people before they even have a chance to live and enjoy life... I am wishing you the best recovery! <3
Wish you the best. Gotta be so hard to go threw, not fair at all.
Glad you are feeling better ❤️stay strong
im with you and my prayers go's  out to you , i have some sored tumor cancer in my chest so is weird
fuck chemo pills, that just gives you more cancer
This is so sad that so many still asleep about how bad chemotherapy is.
THIS IS NOT TRENDING!!!!! FIX THE YOUTUBE WHAT RHE FUCK
So proud of you!!! Your speech is very good. Keep it up ❤❤❤
You make me want to do better...sounds silly I know but your strength is infections.
You are just really awesome!!! To post all of your symptoms and reactions to different treatments is just such a huge help to others who are going thru the same things... you are such a beautiful young woman and I hope you know how truly amazing you really are!!! You are helping so many people and I hope you really know that... you truly are an inspiration!!! ❤️ you...
Get better 🙂
God Bless you 🙏🏻
Love ya <3

GOD's got you stay strong
Girl I wish you the best , but I must warn what you have been told is not true , stop pills and chemo immideatiy,  and start detox of your body , do not eat meat and vegan diet institute now. Exercise , yoga and you still need light amount of sun , look into tinctures herbal to detox , juicing and raw fruit and veggie diet and you will beat this in a month or two believe these words I speak they are poisoning you and do not continue if you wish to live , this advice is with love , if you love to live quit the chemo on all levels it's not your fault they have tricked and manipulated the population it's a money making , that's it all it is they have killed my family members and dine my research and saved others , look Up DR.ROBERT MORSE ON YOU TUBE HE WILL SAVE YOU YOUR DREAMS ARE TELLING YOU WHAT YOU FEEL INSIDE IS NOT RIGHT GOD BLESS YOU AND PLEASE HEADE THIS WARNING AND THIS ADVICE IT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE , PEACE AND LOVE TO YOU PLEASE GOD SAID TO TELL YOU THAT THING YOU KEEP THINKING ABOUT ,THAT IS BOTHERING YOU , YOU ARE RIGHT COME ALIVE AND BELIEVE IN YOURSELF NOT YOU AND CHEMO CHEMO IS EVIL ,GOOD LUCK YOU HAVE A NEW  PLAN NOW START  NOW  PLEASE .....!!!!!!!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT DO CHEMO OR RADIATION THE DOCTORS ARE WHAT THEY FIRST SUGGEST WHEN YOU HAVE CANCER WHEN THEY KNOW THE FRICKING TRUTH THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IS THE SOLUTION WHEN THE SOLUTION IS THAT CANCER IS NOT AS BAD AS WE THINK WE CAN GET RID OF IT NATURALLY BY JUST CHANGING YOUR DIET ONLY VEGGIES AND FRUIT AND NOO MEAT AT ALL THATS IT I HOPE YOU READ MY COMMENT GOD BLESS YOU .
chemo is mustard gas and was created by the Nazi's.  It's got a very low survival rate in 5 years, only about 9%.  There are holistic methods that have a much higher survival rate.  The medical industry does not want you to find out about natural therapies, b/c it's all about profits for them.  Look up the youtube video channel Chris Beat Cancer and find out the truth. Most doctors would not do chemo. If you look up info on youtube you will find that people cure cancer holistically. All cancers are due to toxins in the body.  The mainstream medical system is clueless. You need a naturapathic M.D. that can do vitamin B17 and Vitamin C IVs.  Chemo is a toxic poison and you can't get rid of toxins in the body with another toxin. Ask your doctors what the cause of cancer is, they do not know.  But, naturapathic M.D.s do lab testing and know the cause of cancer is toxins.  Look at your food labels and wonder why there are chemicals in foods, where do you think that goes when you eat it.  There is a reason why the food and drug admin are working together.  Profits from poisoning the population, is big bucks.  You can get rid of cancer by detoxification using herb, essential oils, juice fasting etc. A Naturapthic doctor can help you. Look up Dr. Robert Morse on youtube.
I'm glad you're doing ok. However I just wanted to mention that chemotherapy does not work. 97% of the time patients taking chemotherapy do not get better and they relapse. When a person has chemo inside their body they are killing all good living cells including healthy probiotics and bacteria that keep you functioning and that promote good digestion and other things. Chemotherapy is literally putting chemicals inside of your body to try and kill cancerous cells. If you want to read more about chemotherapy and the messed up medical industry I would really recommend you read The MD Emperor has no Clothes By Dr. Peter Glidden.
Cannabis helps.\nChemo pills sound dangerous.
Chemo? Thats mustard gas.

This kind of m.c and song should get more recognition...damn those trash song topping the chart makes my days worst
I WOULD LOVE TO FEED HER CUPCAKES AND MOUNDS OF COOKIE DOUGH.
She looks really beautiful and it's really nice of her to invite her back up singers to join in this video
Love you Kelly. You're so Awesome!!!! Great song!
I didn't recognize that's her till I saw the name of the video.....
Came here because it was on Taeyeon's Insta Story. 🙂 Sounds good. I just didn't know Kelly had new music out
So happy she's back ❤️ I've loved her since before hazel eyes. She's so beautiful 😍
when the black singers sing in the video is that cotton all Over the place , black were slaves in cotton fields, sorry my english
This is so good! ❤️🙌🏻🔥
Wait in the begining it almost look like Patrick start 🤔😐the make up artist
She is a queen for sure ❤️
Kim taeyeon loves this song that's why I checked it and it's amazing!!
Why isn't this video in her VEVO account?
her extra weight looks good on her\n+ she still got those pipe\n+ this reminds me of more hip hop and more r and b
cool, but i think i'm madi lee
I hate the part where her head is spinning around with the other singer's head. They rotate around for too long.
I really like the new song! But I don't think the video is very interesting.
Why isn't this released on her Vevo channel 🤔 it would get way more views there
Who is she? (i'm from Europe)
New label made her music is better!!!!!
What happened to her vevo account
Everyone calling her FAT, who gives any fucks......oh wait, you fucktards apparently. \nWho gives a shit what she looks like, she can sing her ASS OFF, her thick, cute ass off. \nSo do me a kind favor and send me your address, so I can mail you a box of razor blades. Thanks in advance!!!
This song omg ....my wig is a distant memory....
U r comeback... love you love you love you.... proud of you ohhh my inspiration....
Yeah Kelly is back with another big hit again! Legends can only do that.. #Kelly
Idk why comments keep saying her vocals have elements of Pink and Adele (both great artists btw)....She sounds like Kelly Motherf*cking Clarkson. It's quite reminiscent of her 1st album, such effortless vocal ability ❤ She was quoted saying this is the kind of album she's been wanting to make. I'm definitely down to buy and eat up! 😄
I love you, Kelly! You're a GODDESS!!!!! <3
Kelly Clarkson is so pretty~
Her songs keep getting better and better, love the video too
Amazing job girl! I LOVE IT! Keep doing you. Fuck the bitches bitching about your weight. Couldn't accomplish one-quarter of the shit you do! Fuck 'em to hell!
i am love the music , perfect <3
Someone can explain me the video 's sense? Some scenes I do not understand it

how the fuck do you get fat as am multimillionaire.
She gained a lot of weight
Is very sad to see Kelly Clarkson sunk she was a great artist
So fat
fat
It's insane she is still around from making it as winner on Star Search she must be like almost 50 yrs old? Wow 😳 that was early 90's
ur not! Adele ... the only fat that i lv is Adele! ... should u go the GYM
I can't believe Beatrice's dad is played by Matthew Broderick. I totally didn't recognize him
This makes the scene where Bojack threw the doll out the window ten times more fucked up. Jesus Christ.
your sickness has infected everything.\ni like the funny show with the talking horsies
when she was a child his father order to burn everything, why? she had  scarlet fever.\n\nagain, lets remmember, scarlet fever was the leading cause of death of children in the 50s and 60s, it was a virus that spread on to personal belongings, so they had to get rid of everything, im not defending bea's father, he was a misogynistic, racist, elitist piece of shit, but he was a result of his time.\n\ngranted, he should have explained why he was burning everything to his young girl, but he didnt, because he doesnt know to treat women feeling and he wont learn (s4e2).\n\nthe 50s were fucked up, it was too much man!
The animators really went to town with the dementia story. They really outdid themselves with this episode. Best example being the simple hat appearing suddenly after the line hat in hand.\n\nEasily the best animated show at the moment comedy and feels wise. Don't know how they will top this season.
Remember when Hollyhock goes back to her family and Beatrice asks where the baby is?\n\nOh, that's right, I took the baby.\n\nShe took the baby from Henrietta.
And to think things could've been so much different if Crackerjack was still alive...
This probably my favorite episode. The visuals and story was fucking insane
Hillary Clinton's Biography 20 years from now
What if is all in the mind of todd when hes super high on lsd
Beatrice's dad is really shitty, but just to clear up back them when scarlet fever was common, the child's toys would have to be burned (I learned about this in The Velveteen Rabbit lol). Still he could have been nicer about it
Finding out what made BoJacks mom act like this, was the saddest part of this whole season.
I didn't even notice the painting in the background is Bea's family portrait and Bojack's family portrait until now. Fucked up. They really are hammering home how trauma and abuse are a never-ending cycle.
This was really stressful to watch, but good on them for humanizing Beatrice. This is easily my favorite season.
Abuse and trauma are cyclical. Your parents will pass them on to you. You may never know why, and your parents might not even realize it.
We've had Clorox since 1913. Joseph could've disinfected the doll instead of burning it. He went for the quickest, dirtiest, most traumatic solution possible.\n\nJust like he did with his wife.
what's the piano track that starts playing at 1:52 called?
So how does procreation work in this universe
The painting on the wall shifts between her two families
I like how child Beatrice yelling NO MY BABY sounds just like when old Beatrice yells NO MY BABY in a previous episode.
Did anyone notice the family portrait in the background?
Even though I wish they showed more side characters like Todd and character actress margo martindale!! The way they made Beatrice sympathetic is amazing. \nOne of the best and most fucked up scenes of the series, all the parallels between characters.
Full teared on this one
sex with a horse would kill you. Giving birth to one will definitely kill you.
Essay question;  All this being discovered this season really changes the perspective on a lot of internal problems Bojack has. Should what Todd said in season 3 about all Bojack's problems being self created and has nothing to do with his past still be valid? Go.
Wait a second.. the star... on the foreheads beatrice her father and bojack have it, and so does the daughter does that mean bojacks father was not lying about his mother or is she really bojacks daughter and he slept with the help?
I love how in 0:29 and how they used people's faces all scratched up to show how bojack's mother is sick and can't always remember what people look like or had with them.
It's painful that Beatrice's mom lost her mind because of the forced lobotomy. Beatrice then became a hateful person without love to avoid the same fate, only to have her mind slowly rot away to dementia anyways...
Getting darker(anybody get the reference)
If her father really was like that and this was the standard of fatherly behavior in the 50s, I am so glad I didn't grow up in that era. Anyone who's nostalgic for those days needs a reality check.
Rick and Morty: This is going to be the darkest season yet!\nSouth Park: We already topped that you bastards \nBojack Horseman:....CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
I fucking hate that grandfather
This episode was amazing. Usually in the case of this person is evil but look how tragic their past was I struggle to get that invested anymore but fuuuuuuck, even though I've seen more tragic backstories the way this episode was done just broke my heart. Doesn't make Beatrice's actions justified but I think the way she treated the Hollyhock situation really cemented how damaged her way of thinking had become. Give these creators an Emmy god damn.
...Gods, fuck me running this is...amazing.
thanks random youtuber for uploading the saddest thing ever. i needed to cry hysterically i'm sure anyway.
Am I the only one who thought this episode was as dark as Sarah Lynn last season? Easily the best episode aside from Episode 2.
the beginning of the theme song with the transition of bojack turning into henrietta made my heart sink.. i knew this episode was going to be fucked up as hell after watching that. i can officially say three cartoon characters have brought me to tears now, pearl from steven universe, beatrice horseman and sarah lynn
Time and Time again, we've seen how this season has shown us that hurt people hurt people, even if that wasn't their intentions. Whether it's Bojack or Princess Carolyn, or even Henrietta.. But Bojack's grandfather.. is byfar the worst character on the show. I understand that there's no excuse for Bojack or Henrietta's actions throughout the show, but the grandfather doesn't have that luxury to fall back on. Since he's been introduced, he's been dismissive and absent when it comes to dealing with any hardships that weren't his own. Instead of supplying comfort for his wife when she was in need he abandoned her and later had her lobotomized when her life was spiraling out of control. I can make a list of issues this dude has but.. it's just too depressing to go on.. to his that all this hate and hurt originated from one man who was just.. sickening
This was possibly the happiest season yet, but that doesn't mean we didn't get some scary shit.
I'm glad I'm emotionally strong enough not to cry, or sympathize with Beatrice for being a complete horses ass of a Queen Bitch. I do understand why she is that way, and all I can say is.....well, that's life sometimes.
Your sickness has infected everything, it all must be destroyed
that sound effect that plays when Beatrice's mother's silhouette appears in the flames is bone chilling
I love Henrietta,, would love to see her in season five. Want to see her and Hollyhock reunite and spend time together.
If Hollyhock has that diamond birthmark, does that mean that Butterscotch wasn't lying to Beatrice when he told her that she reminded him of his dead mother?
One day, this will all be a pleasant memory...\n\nFuck. You.
Henrietta is such a whore
Beatrice was actually so nice to Henrietta, nicer than she was to anyone else tbh
I didn't know how to feel about this scene, fuck man, this was fucked up...
there is soo much thought put into this episode like i think its really telling that she only reognies Bojack when he is walking away from her i guess his back is a more common sight for her then atually seeing his frount.
The only thing that bugs me is that hollyhawk has the diamond on her forehead.I mean her father doesn't have that diamond on his forehead thus bojack inherited that trait from his mother.But in the end is a show where a horse screws a human and she gives birth to a horse instead of a centaur.
Is it bad that I was too sad at the burning because it was that she had contaminated items \nHer father is the character I could ponder forever, he screwed up major with his family but it's not like he didn't love them. I'm pretty sure he regretted his wife's lobotomy earlier in the episode
This is probably,one of the best episodes ive seen in a long as time\n\nThe last good show with a episode that fucking amazing was Breaking Bad: Fly
The scene with Beatrice and her father at the fire place was actually really scary.
I'm not crying... someone put tears in my eyes :'C
This show is a masterpiece. Nothing more I say can do it justice.
Christ I've been so busy I haven't been able to watch season 4\nSo I just tie myself over with YT clips\n\n\nI NEED MY DEPRESSED HORSE
This is so dark
that's too much man
Bojack's grandpa was the devil
This is the best Bojack episode
this was like horror
We mess up our children and they mess up their children. That cycle has no end. Break the cycle. Be a better parent. If you can't, please, for the sake of the world, don't have children.
next season we are going to get a sad backstory for sugarman.
not to be dramatic but this episode made me cry
Time's Arrow literally went in reverse and stood still, something it shouldn't do.
THE FUCKING SOUND IT MAKES WHEN HER MOM WALKS OUT OF THE FIRE IS NIGHTMARE FUEL! 3:40
So long college degree. Rick and Morty and Bojack Horseman are my world now :/
After watching this dark scene and it begs me a question with that pregnant part. How did animals get birth by a either a single furry person and a human person? No animal was born like that and there's only one horse baby got release out by a human woman. I guess that in Bojack's universe has to have multiracial connection between animals and humans. Too bad that Princess Carolyn couldn't get a mouse baby like that.
Scenes like this just remind me that few people are just born cruel. Most people that are cruel are broken over time.
This episode was almost horrifying at some points
Never imagined Matthew Broderick playing a villain character before. Now i see it clearly.
Has anyone else noticed that in every season, episode 11 is always the darkest/most fucked up episode?
You don't wanna end like your mother now, do you? \nholy fuck that scene is spooky
Just watched the fourth season.\n\nAnd i gotta say this episode eas really sad and strong. I ve never seen something like in that in television, the deep and realistic things. Sometimes we met a person, or live with one we may not like and we may not be aware of their past and why the person nowadays does what he does....\n\nAlso...\n\nThat scene when she get bullied for being kinda fat explains why she ended up intoxicating Hollyhock...\n\nThis is so real. And i think the writters really got heavy on the subject...\n\nLike, theres no aesthetics or glamourized story. They putted reality on it.
bojack horseman explains the cycle of abuse so well... the parallel between joseph and beatrice then beatrice and henrietta is fucking heartbreaking
I am really very glad that they explored the theme of abuse in parenthood, especially in this fashion.\n\nJust as B's father tormented her under the guise of being a good father, she tormented BoJack under the guise of being a good mother.\n\nBut it was never about BoJack to her. It was never him being a bad child. It was about her taking out her frustrations and anxiety on others. It was about her making sure that everyone was just as miserable as her. And lo and behold BoJack took out those frustrations on people he cared about. Not because he thought any of it was right, but because it was normal to him to be this way.\n\nBecause remember: abuse doesn't have to be physical at all. Emotional abuse can be terrifying and ugly and nobody would even know it was until it was too late.\n\nAnd the both of them just couldn't admit it because why would they? You can't do a whole hell of a lot as a child against your parents.\n\nDoes this justify their actions? No, of course not. But it does paint a clearer picture as to why they are this way.
the cycle of abuse is real as fuck
This episode was so good.
What's the song that was used in this song?
I literally cried in that episode.
The lobotomy Honey Sugarman had, is a reference to Rosemary Kennedy, sister of JFK, who had a lobotomy and left her numb for the rest of her life. Hell, even Joseph Sugarman shares name of JFK dad, Joseph Kennedy.
ANIMATION ITS SO FUCKING GOOD AND THE SCENE AND THE HISTORY THIS SHOW ITS KILLING ME AND SHIT ON MY GRAVE
Wait, I thought Evil Morty was coming back this season?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh shit wrong show
This show had never made me cry, but this episode got me good
3:39 it was creepy as fuck
This scene literally made me hyperventilate and weep at the same time. Dead serious.
The best part of this and Beatrice's whole story this season is that it feels like it could radically alter the way we rewatch the earlier seasons. And shit, how much we're paying attention to the coffee thing in this one.
this season is my favorite so far. so dark yet so funny and excellent. everything bojack horseman is about.
Gross bestiality shit
No wonder Bojack is fucked.
Bojack Horseman is better than Rick and Morty.
Title change!
So fucked up
Fucking  spoilers.
really :(
Fuckin damn, this show
That scar . . .
Can't tell who's worse or more loath-able...\n\nButterscotch or Joseph?
Season 4 was lame, 2 and 3 are way better
so if Holihock is not Bojack's daughter, and her dad doesn't even have a diamond shape on forehead, how come Holihock has a diamond too...
wow. when I actually read those titles I think she's singing those words,  but she's not at all. it would have been outrageous of she was actually singing those words.
hahahahahaha
You look adorable!!! 😍
Ok but I teared up for Queen of Darkness
Someone said I looked like this random person. I have no idea who this is.
I don't know about your country, but in mine, even adults dress up for Halloween, although usually just for parties where everyone gets wicked trashed. Or even just for the sake of dressing up.
You're a spoof. I bet you didnt see that coming.
You are fantastic! I love you and your videos so much.
I love the way you talk about autumn, I relate so hard, I really fucking love autumn
How we know that we aren't all just sentient ice cream? \n\n\n\nAlso,  I'm loving the glasses :)
I think they look really nice
I love glasses they look just like mine
I like your glasses, they look really snazzy; also good vid 10/10 nice 👍👍👌
I didn't know he could get cuter and then the glasses arrived
you look rad with these glasses on
PJ looks so good with glasses😍😍😍😂
I love watching your videos when I'm high af :)
aw no peej ur glasses are a+
THE TRUTH IS IN UR FACE
Story time:\n....\nI don't have a story.
Imagining you in a dark room screaming at a camera a few times to get that shot is priceless
Haha four eyes! I'm so beating u up at skool
I really like the balance of the orange lights in the background . Great slurp!
bobo in my language means stupid or idiot.
what the fuck's with the background music?
how does pj look so fucking hot in this video and where can i get a pj for myself
Spent so long trying to figure out what the elephant in the room was and then he pointed to his glasses... I must have seen Pj in glasses before because I seriously did not react at all whoops (slightly disapointed there wasn't some drama scoop but hey I like slurp videos so that's cool)
Bobo is actually me, I dressed up as a pink elephant to hide from the cops
I'm so pissed I didn't get a stay rad shirt!!! Please sell more of them???
The glasses suit you so well ahhh
Ocerwinner of time that's what o heard pj
Well shoot mate, I'M an elephant. Ellie the Elephant that is
how do you style your hair man i need to know!!!
1:18 You left one out. 🙁 Even hotter than usual!
You look so cute in those glasses PJ! Great video as always. 💙
There's a monster face behind pj, and its made of light. The worst of the worst
I love the glasses
What are you talking about PJ? The glasses are so rad!!!
Hey Pj, I've heard a lot of things about the big rec but I was in a different dimension. Maybe you could make a video about it
Doesn't pj kinda look like the Uk version or cole sprouse??
I was up really late uh.....*long pause* Working.
How weird am I? HOW WEIRD AM I?! I put glasses on my face. Without any ears.
Honestly, you look so much cuter with them on XD
that little laugh after the spongebob joke was so cute and pure
can you smoke human?
im actually happy pj has glasses now. ive always felt weird that everyone I look up to has vision and idk it's a weird small thing
My mom at bingo club, my mom's friend at bingo club, everyone at bingo club.
First time I got an ad before a pj video :D
I like his glasses and his hair
Wow, I didn't know dressing up for Halloween had an age limit. Trick or treating, maybe...but dressing up...? Never!
I think you look really nice in glasses :). Also, that mug is really cool!!
how in the hell are you so adorable
Bobo was great, omg. I really like it when you put in drawings!
0:48 maybe bobo is hiding in your closet because he's boBISEXUAL
IS HE GAY OR EU-RO-PE-AN
pj you looks so good in glasses omg
do you ever drink water out of your mugs and if yes, doesn't it taste different than water from glasses?
You look like Hugh Grant in 4 Weddings 1 Funeral
P,j looks so cute in glasses
Love the glasses, looking great 😍
YES PLS A VID WITH DEAN DOBBS WOULD BE AMAZING
I talked to the wind and it told me to fuck off
Damn, you basically banned all of the terms I was going to use so instead I'll say rad glasses, they really suit you!
Why is this man so perfect?
Anyone else looking for the sentient ice cream in the comments?
you actually look very good in glasses
what?! you should totally dress up for halloween...also do people really make fun of other people for wearing glasses. its not that its unheard of but....i didnt think people still did that.
I have never been more attracted to PJ than when he is wearing his new glasses.
I like the glasses. It makes you look kinda dorky ... Seams befitting to me.
Love this video! I love funny and chill you are!!
Harry who? You're James Potter, PJ.
HEY! Have a good day! And GLASSES ARE GOOD
I like them they make you look better in my opinion
You legit look adorable in your glasses though
Pls tell Bobo he shouldnt feel pressured to come out of the closet. We are supporitve community after all
why is ur lighting so cool
I want a KickThePj podcast so bad

What is the NEWEST product you have tried, and did you like it??
Heads up gals, if somebody wants to get FREE cosmetic samples to test different brands then check out ==ga4u.site== I got mine 3 weeks ago and I'm sure they shall last quite some time.
My 4 year old niece suggest doing a series where you base your look off of each planet! We love watching you from the US! Such a different culture from your home to ours! 💕 Keep being amazing.
What brand does you hair stylist uses on you hair? I'm also interested in the toner you use, how often do you tone your hair?
Fenty Beauty Review Please! ☺️💖
I found that the Marc Jacobs lid primer works best with no foundation/concealer on the lid! Went on a lot smoother
In my country they tell you not to workout for 24h after having yr blood drawn or getting a shot
How do you get your lashes so long and thick?? They look amazing!
You can always mix the foundation with a glowy primer like one of the becca or lorac ones
Loved this video and you! so pretty. Before everything was don't I think the cheeks looked like Neapolitan ice cream
This look is beautiful!
Why don't you post declutter videos anymore?!?!
The eye primer looks like it might work like the Wet & Wild one. Use a small amount and blend with your finger on ONLY the lid. If you take it any farther it gets gross and clumpy looking - like your skin is super dry and peeling. Also, set it with  a normal setting powder.
Can you do Rihanna's fenty  first impression video? Btw love your videos keep doing you Xx
Pleaseee review Rihanna's new foundation.. when you get time, I know you're busy lol💕💕❤️ 😘
I'm absolutely loving these full face first impression videos! I like the idea of reviewing the products, but I prefer your tutorials/chit chats more than just an impression on one product. This combines both! Keep doing these <3
Omg, didn't finish this video, almost laugh and smlied sooooo much. I LOVE YOU <3. Greetings from Germany PS: love you and all of your videos
Do a full face of second impressions video 👌🏻👌🏻
Omg i loove you eyebrows 😍😍and the makeup soo beautiful 😻😻🙈
Please review Rihanna's new fenty beauty line ! Love to see your reviews before I go out and buy a new product!! 💕😘
Hi Shannon!!! love your videos! just wondering if you can do ideas for dry skin !
This eyelook is soooo stunning on you! It makes your eyes pop sooo much✨😍😍😍
Wow this is a beautiful makeup look on you! 💖
why would you put primer on top of foundation and powder? of course it's gonna look cakey 🤷🏼‍♀️
Yes Shannon!!! You look amazing and happy 🙌🏼
Ergh my god ive had years of stress n crap n i look way better that you  where you have make up or not
Can you do a video on the best blushes to get and what works best with different skin tones etc??
You are such an inspiration and an uplifting person. I've been going through quite a rough patch and being a part of the Shan-Clan makes it just a little more bearable. Your videos always put me in such a better mood. Thank you for always being yourself because you're awesome. Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise
I have super fair skin like you :) it makes me SO happy to see more of you embracing it, I know you've been and Lauren Curtis and Kathleen lights etc. I used to always see everyone always fake tanned and it's just so nice to see you embracing the pale! Haha
Update: I just to the part of the video where you said your eyebrows look weird. Girl, noooooo😍
You're pronouncing karruchewrong, it's ka-roo-chi as in karruche tran (Chris browns ex lol)
Can you do a Rihanna Fenty beauty first impression 😊😍
i like those eyeshadows they seemed to much but settled down after a while.i will try that is it because they soak in or is it from them blending in with the oils of skin?
i love you shan!
Hi Shannon 😍😍😍😍😍
I love ❤️ your natural eyelashes 😍😍
Goddamn you always look so amazing peach tone lipsticks
Your hair 😍
3017??😂🤣😂
Whenever im sad i just come to this channel and it makes me so happy. Keep up the good work shann
I know this has nothing to do with the video but pleaassee help!\nYesterday I bought the NYX Tres Jolie gel pencil liner and it just doesn't do anything for me. I bought it because KathleenLights recommended but it just doesn't work. I've tried to put it on my waterline but there's no ink🤦 I've warmed it up but still...\nIf you own it please tell me your experience or some tips to make it work cause I'm broke to go and buy another one lol hahahahah
I want to go back blonde.  What color do you dye your hair and what toner do you use?
Hmm I wonder if using a setting spray will make this any better...\n*applies eyeshadow*\n...Marginally.\nI love your word choice 😂🙌🏼💜
I would love to see the new too faced peaches and creme lipstick swatches 😍 I have yet to see anyone swatch them all.
Did you guys get engaged!? Did I miss something haha
Love the look and love you, of course :)
Your videos are good and Please make a video for pores skin make up
Any small YouTubers want to support each other??
Love the colours in this look! 🍑🌸🌷
This is a pink setting powder, which gives me the shits. Hahahaha Shan you kill me xxx
What's with all the adverts mid video???? 😡😡😡
What brushes would you recommend from your brand to buy first for a full, complete face??? 😁 I really need to invest more on my brushes. Lol.
that liquid lip is amazing
I love how she just randomly made an eye look and it came out so pretty and can you do a smashbox lip swatches?
Please do the sangria cocktail look!!
Khuṇ s̄wy māk
Hi, is there any small youtubers want to support each other? 😊😊
This look is 🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful! 😀
pause sit lip later museum colonial interior closely recruit melt
Your so pretty!😍
You are such a cutie!\n\nXXX
shaan is my inspiration 😍 Love all your videos sooo much. Ive just started my youtube chanel any smaller chanels come say hi and we can do a sub for a sub 😋😋😋😋
What was the lip mask she used? I might've overlooked it in the description!
girl your brows! I am in love
i tried the lancome matte shakers and boy are those intense! I also tried some of the Elizabeth Arden new gelato collection and the lipsticks they came out with are amazing. I haven't tried that blush yet..
Your first impression videos are definitely one of my favorites from you :)) Looove the look xx
Does anyone know if those are her natural lashes or does she use some kind of lash grower?? I need your lashes Shannon😣😍
Love your brushes! Can't wait to purchase some...hopefully soon. Proud for and of you girl!!!💕
Omg i had the same reaction to the jelly pack product!! But I love it now that I'm used to it
I agree with what you said about the companies. When I was 14 or so and the Drugstore Makeup was soooo shit and now I don't see the need in buying high end stuff because the drugstore is so good now!
Maybe it's cakey cause u applied Concealer then powder then another liquid on top of powder then powder again....
I love your videos!! I honestly dont wear makeup at all but I still watch these cause your my fav ❤💖
love your hair color with your pale skin 😍😍😍
That look is so beautiful!! Could you do a review on the fenty beauty range if possible please shan!!! 😍
plz do a fenty beauty review! i wanna see how u think of rihanna's beauty line
I really love your accent ❤
Do a first impression on Fenty Beauty!!!!!
I love that she corrected 3016 to 2017 lmao
gorgeous as always! will you be reviewing the jaclyn hill palette at all? love u <3
You really should try and review Lumene skincare from Finland 😇 i'd love to hear what you think of it 🙊
hello shanxoo... can you make a video about brushes functions and uses??? it would be so helpful thanks:)
Do you have fillers on your lips?
Hi Shannon, could you do a 1920s makeup tutorial pleeeease😀
It's Monday 3pm western Australia time, howcome her videos not up yet? Or doesn't she do 3 videos a week , Monday Wednesday and Friday, now??
I suuuuuper love the makeup look. Love it even more without eyeliners 🔥🔥 Please also try the face primer along with a dewy finish foundation.
That primer though right, so awesome, I thought it was going to be difficult blending the foundation because the primer was so sticky! I wonder if you try those shimmer/foils from the She palette with an eye primer that you are comfortable with if they work any better? Just a thought, also wonder if maybe the beauty bakery ones don't like playing with others? I really want the She palette but if those shimmer fail that bad not sure ill get it now, 😞
Is there anyway you can do a bh cosmetics 88 matte eyeshadow look with only that palette. Because I can't ever really figure out how to make a look with it
Make up, turns any 6 into a 9.
She is my makeup inspiration she is amazing and super pretty without makeup. she is the one who inspired me to do makeup I love her sooooooooo much
With that mascara, you don't even need lashes!
Hi Shannon I just did a makeup look using your palette! It's my fav! Check it out of ur bored! Love u xo
You look amazing as always. Your talent amazes me. I didn't like the way the KKW contour and bronzer looked at all but everything else was stunning xxxx
Thisa isa shita
😍❤️
DO A BARBIE MAKEUP TUTORIAL
Can you review Fenty Makeup by Rihanna please
How do you keep your eyelashes healthy ? I used to have really long and thick eyelashes but now since I've been wearing waterproof mascara for 3 years they've gotten really thin and always breaking and they look weird with mascara now :( any ideas on how to get healthy thick lashes again
do a series of Marc Jakabe eyeshadows
shannon, do you remember in your do's and dont's video you said never use concealer that is too light for your skin tone, well that's what you did and you put on a lot. So don't tell us not to do that but then you did that

Men wearing dresses is the new gangsta. Atl is the new San Francisco. Damn pimp c was so right when he called these issues out. This shit is lame and niggas love it too. So subliminal and demonic
So, is Young Thug called Young Martha now, or is it Jeffery? I'm confused

It was so beautiful seeing how Liza reacted to the 2 rooms and it literally made me cry. I love her so much!! And I would also really like to Mr. Kate to come over!!!

resolution is for vr........simple as that.....
Where from can I get that wallpaper that's on Galaxy S8 at 4:16?? I just love that!
Don't know if my comment will be read by the LTT personnel but thank you for pronouncing bokeh properly. That's become a pet peeve of mine since last year's iphone keynote.
its 2017 and i still dont get how are people watching movie mobile?
You know what they say about a guy with small hands😏
Note 8 picture looks alive unlike the dead and dry iPhone 7 Plus' picture.
I'm sure Samsung had hardcoded Bixby to ignore all iPhone searches, in the same way that Amazon never gives you any search results for Chromecast that are actually Chromecast and not Fire TV.
Linus, what are you doing? You use Austin's video of his house burning down (though I guess you might have taken his permission) and though you indicate that it wasn't caused by Samsung note 7 (which runs by in less than 0.5 secs), you are indicating like how news channels do.
Anyone know if they are going to release the larger internal storage capacity versions in Europe?
Maybe wait for the note 10
that is not the s8 plus but just the s8
wait a min.. you have kids?
The music you put in this video is aids. The volume is just quiet enough to make it obnoxious.
Still, if you don't need the S-pen easy pick, S8+ is 350 euro's cheaper
I'll just stay here with my c9 pro
Wow this sad af just buy a s8
Nice implimentation of Austin's burned flat :'D
I want this phone just to make masterpieces in snapchat
Something about this review doesn't feel genuine...
I have hands as small as Donald Trump
Did you just wink at me sir?
Now I dnt find something unique in ur videos bro ,,,, 😒 use to be fun to watch ur video
Almost $1000?  I could buy like 500 Amazon Fire Phones for that.
Love your work sir.. been watching you for years now.
I didn't know Linus make phone reviews
You're kidding right? \n Note 8  is near perfect for big boys!
They are not gonna change everything for you. At the end of the day it's their phone.  They keep the s pen cause that's the main purpose of the phone and to have big specs..not battery. What do you expect if it does it almost all? And they aren't gonna do everything right away. They did pretty damn good, you aren't getting good speakers right away so calm down, they had other things that were needed more.
still love my note 4... upgrading time might take the S8 plus. really dont use the pen that much.
chinese fans want to see xiaomi mix2！
Trash talker!!!!
Now what? Even this clown is reviewing phones? He basically collected all negative side of it and made a video.\nListen, S-Pen has more precision then a finger. Ask people who used it since the original Note. People do a lot other stuff with it, not just to open apps.\nIf your finger is so small that you don't need an S-Pen. Most of us find it useful. \nFunny when a pc builder review phones. He hated the phone before he even put one on his hand. Just search the August 23rd video when he's with other reviewers.
I am not going to pay over 500 $ for that tho...
5:09 I just realized that I might be racist.
i have a note 4 and its still the best one they made, 4k pictures, never lags, removable battery, 64gb sd card + 32gb hdd, no bixby and some come pre-rooted, its great :P
I love this new style of review video you put out, Linus. :D
It has a smaller battery but many people have uploaded videos showing the Note 8 out performing many other phones including the S8+. \nEveryone has been hating on Bixby but I was blown away after seeing a Siri, Google and Bixby comparison. Bixby is smart and is growing more intelligent every day.
you should stick to computer/it tech rather than phones,,,\nps:dislike for using you friend unfortunate event Austin Evans as a joke or what you thought would be funny....
bxActions still works to remap really well. I have it set as a flashlight button.
Thank you for the honest review, instead of just jumping on the band wagon and saying it's awesome. I have a Note 5 and much prefer it over the Note 8. Samsung also downgraded the camera by 4MP. Note 5 has a 16MP camera! That curved displays are just plain stupid, makes it way easier to break.
OLED, AMOLED, Super AMOLED, Super AMOLED HD - I just wish they had a universal language - this is the first time in years I have heard a Samsung screen be called OLED - most recently the LG V30 - if its AMOLED just say AMOLED why confuse the words jezzus
Well, the Dual Sim is a pretty big deal for some people :)
Soon you'll praise the iphone 8 for no reason ...
Wait what?! Linus can 540 kick? O.o well done sir!
Too much knit picking dude. As an all in one gadget. I think this one tops it !
I'm sick of dbrand ads
Note 8 has long lasting battery due to its software optimization
Is that a set or green screen?
Not an impressive review, but then again opinions are what makes the world go-around I guess. If you can replace the s pen with your finger, boy I would love to see that one...lol. The dual camera is a plus for me, IMO. Too much clownish batter Linus,  but then again some people like to be entertained....You missed this one Linus, thumbs down!
Hahaha you are very funny... very bad video... you tried to much to make this video... dislike of course
I like the Note line but this #8. Way crazy over priced IMHO. I also think the S8 is over priced as well. These phones have just gotten too expensive over the years.
Holy cow your entire staff has tiny hands. I'm a 17 year old Asian kid. I'm average height and weigh under 130. My note 8 (got it a week early thanks Best Buy) is perfectly sized for fingerprint. So either I have big hands or you have Trump hands.
Linus, you are like the morning dosage of caffeine I can't get through my day without it. We love you, we need you, we are addicted, don't you dare quitting on us! :)
Wait....Squeeze input? You've held the U11 then!
Fuck. The price fucked this up. This video ALMOST made me buy this phone.
Linus....I personally respect your unbiased option.  I appreciate the review and I wont be upgrading for a few gimmicks
What's with the two sexually ambivalent Asian dudes?
shut the fuck up!
Don't you think holding a movie in your hand is a bit of a stretch?
The part when the note 7 was a sticky bomb in gta was funny
Your reviews suck !  did not even heard any tech specs
Mmm galaxy note pro 12.3 or something like that.... not that good at maths but I think that means that the screen is bigger
0:07 wth, i did not know that Linus could do crap like this
My mom has a s8 and the finger print was weird  at first but after 2 days it was normal and weird for me when I use my s7 egde
I was told that if you play a YouTube video on note 8, it won't be in the full screen! It will be the same size as Iphone plus. Is that true?!!
Dam was this a note 8 bashing I'm glad when I received mine I love it, and didn't listen to some of yall reviewer's
I'm confused... what wouldn't you give up 200mA hours of battery life for, the S-PEN?   That's nuts.   200mA is insignificant compared to the value the S-PEN brings to the device.
You are tooo harsh on Note 8 \nSpecially when it has all the features which even Flagship phones don't \n. \nThat way you should roast normal phones \nI don't see you harsh on normal phones
no RBG lighting
Definitely should've been 6 inch. Fail Samsung.
cant find sRGB on mine!
This phone needs @ungripyourphone
Austin's house burnt
Small penis
Adjust my grip and start writing? What? Dude you sound like a female OMG! Just whining and whining and whining WTF dude! I dont care about Apple or Samsung I'm just saying you nip picked your ass off on this one brother! Oh & there was no Note 7 recall remember?? Soooooo???? Just saying man.
Now THIS is the type of content I want to see; serious, but with a hint of humor, no flashy stupid milenial memes across the screen, and an organized point-by-point format with comparisons to past hardware.  WELL DONE.  If you can keep this up I'd be happy.
Wanna hear a samsung galaxy note 8 joke?\n\n\n\n\n\nthe price....

Already ordered both my Note 8(with Note 7 owner discount WOOOO) and a fresh mahogany DBrand skin to go with it. Cant wait to mail them this S7 Edge and be rid of it forever.
I fucking want it
Remember when most of those idiots out here didn't want a Note phone because it was too big? Now everybody wants a big phone. People don't know what the hell they want. Linus just sounds confused. Why is everyone in comparing the note 8 To a phone which most people do not have because they were waiting for the note 8? nobody's going to basically downgrade just for a little bit of battery life. Bullshit review
Im fucking crying at that gta 5 mod..
Quit hating on the phone. The Note 8 is super dope. I have it, and it's great!
And I'm still here with the Galaxy Grand Prime, Samsung's first x64 phone.
bro u r iphone fan so dont try to compare it with iphone7 plus
Now I want to watch your review on iPhone X and see whether it's going to be as fair as this one
If Samsung is gonna take away removable battery, then at least give us a bigger one!
joueur sous estimé par les supporters du psg...une vrai bête ce mec...dans le top 3 des meilleurs arrière
La presse a tué Serge. Ce n'est pas un mauvais garçon, loin de là. Bonne chance pour la suite Serge ! 💪
Bonne route Serge t'es l'un des meilleurs

Waaawww il a les cils hyper recourbée

stop dire que les médias l'on tué, il s'est tué tout seul, c'est pas les médias qui lui ont mis un flingue sur la tempe et qui l'on forcé à bavé sur le club et sur LB. Si tu craches dans la main de celui qui te donne à manger c'est que tu n'a aucune estime de toi, c'est LB qui ta sortis de Toulouse pour faire de toi un grand du PSG, n'oublie jamais sa, et si le club ne t'a pas vendu direct, c'est juste pour ne pas perdre de billes, mais le lendemain de ta vidéo périscope tu ne faisais déjà plus partis du projet, tout dans les jambes rien dans la tête, j'espère aussi que tu t'es débarrassé de ton (faux) pote a chicha. \nVraiment dommage pour toi et ta carrière, prends ce nouveau départ comme une chance et arrête les conneries t'es plus un gosse!
désolé Serge,après la chicha,tu as perdu le respect du coach et ton niveau footballistique

Aurier the best
Le plus lent à mettre ses chaussettes aussi ..... mdrrrr \nOui bon joueur , mais pas pro sur le reste , attitude , comportement ...... tkt tu ne \nManqueras pas à Paris
Gros débile la vidéo déjà c'est grave t'a manière de parler t dance dans le vestiere tous de que tu fais c'est négatif un joueur cancer comme pogba ou Lukaku par exemple

il aurait du venir à l'om
Pas envie d'écouter ta plaidoirie... fallait juste fermer ta gueule et respecter le club qui t'a permis de devenir ce que tu aurais pu être. À mes yeux ,t'es qu'un con qui pense qu'à sa gueule. Joue au tennis mec! Quoi qu'il en soit tu va pas nous manquer, casse toi et j'espère que ta carrière sera merdique ✌🏻
Ptdrrrrrrr mais on s'en blc frère, arrête de faire la victime tout le temps. Miskin c'est jamais de sa faute 😥
Le mec s'est mis dans la merde tout seul.....Insulter son entraîneur, des coéquipiers c'est ça sa conception de la liberté? Et pourtant j'aime beaucoup ce joueur mais il a fait n'importe quoi.
Merci Serge et bonne chance la presse française est raciste quand tu gagne t es Serge et quand tu déconnes tu deviens un noir de banlieue

Fact No.1 THEY ARE OUR INTERNET OVERLORDS
When my cat was still a few months old, we had to give her milk (the milk they sell in pet shops) because she couldn't drink water... she tried to, but since the water is transparent, she couldn't see where it was and she would always end up shoving her head inside the water and run away ahahah... damn, she was so cute...
Is it true that, for a kitten, playtime is just as important as a good diet? I don't remember where I got this information from. The kittens that I've ever had, when they wanted to play I did my best to provide play time. When they wanted to rest, they were allowed to rest. They grew up to be fine cats.
Fuck kittens bihhh

I love this! 😍
Wait. You mean i have to feed it regularly.
NEVER adopt a kitty only 6 or 7 weeks old!!!! They should be at least 10 or even better 12 weeks old before separated from their mother. They still get nursed  and need the socializing with their mother and siblings until then.\n\nI think it's horrible that this 6 two 8 weeks advise is given here.
Soo cute!!!!
TRENDING!!! :D
Somebody is jalou!
Uh oh. Someone is jealous!
I wanna! D=
❤❤❤❤
Mew.
I've rescued three! Two when they were kittens (12+ years ago) and a rehomed cat, 1-2 years old (the previous owner couldn't remember exactly how old he was...)\n\nI remember getting my kittens. My other cat had died a year earlier and I missed having a cat so much. My mom would drive us to the Humane Society every week to check for kittens. The third week they were there! A little older than I was expecting (12-14 weeks), but the Humane Society probably waited to put them up for adoption until they were a little older.\nI'm definitely a cat person. They're awesome.
I'm surprised this channel has not died yet.\nGoodjob
Lol hehh lol !

I think it might be interesting to see a video with Nicky talking about why cats sit in boxes drawn on the floor sometime. Hopefully she's got some idea ...
Best cartoon ever. Keep em coming the best you can. So adorable. I've watched every single episode so far. 10/10
lol, I love cats and I love this channel  <3
Could you please please please do a video on preparing your cat for a newborn baby coming home? I'm so worried how my cat's going to react when I have my baby in a couple weeks 😯
I have A Question. One of my cats (female) is in heat. And I have another Female cat who has started following her Around. What does that mean?
❤️=^..^= Mew!
and please don't forget the grown cats! They need love too!
My kitten has a obsession with trying to climb out of the 3rd floor window! He pushes it open! It's so scary!
You should also tell people about the juvenile stage
Lactose free milk is an ok treat, but remember it should be a treat only! it should not be given every day for meals, and DO NOT REPLACE KITTEN FOOD WITH IT!!! If you find an stray and hungry cat(kitten) meats like bologna and tuna can be a good temporary meal, remember that KITTENS need specialized food because they are still growing
Ok so you guys live somewhere because your all British
I may can help you some people those who have cats: \n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/yc65cmyl - Ultimate Cat Secrets \n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/y7c953cv - Brand New!

My kitten was weaned young. If you have a kitten like this buy it a bottle (even though it doesn't need it) and every few day give them about a 1\2 tablespoon of milk. This will make the kitten feel more at ease with not being around mum. I did this with my baby boy until he bit through his bottle. It really helped him relax and he quit crying.
CATS RULE!!! dogs drool... \nWhy should everyone on YouTube suffer for a few dumb things PewDiePie did? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
In Pawtrait, there was a cute pic of the baby Simon's cat on the wall. :)
I absolutely love kittens.  After the kitten is... 'dispatched' and skinned, remove the head and tail, trim out the larger meat fillets, dip into a mixture of beaten egg and basil, coat lightly with breadcrumbs, and bake at 375 for 30 minutes.  Serve with mini red potatoes, asparagus with a drizzle of lemon-butter.  The me - yow factor is off the charts!
I hear everytime that appartment cats have to have another cat as a playmate. Because as i was young we had a cat and he didnt had a playmate. And my cat doesnt have one either. Just me and my family. But a friend says everytime that my cat needs another cat as a playmate. Is that true?
Adult cats are pretty awesome choices too if you are looking for a cat. No potty training, they still bond to you, they are chill (most of the time). Even when I adopted the really mean older cats, they turned into cuddle bugs after a few days because they are out of a stressful environment. :)
and this is why you set up the camera first. Simon never learns.
Oh you quickly learn not to give your cat milk even if he loves it so much and meows so desperately when you have milk in your hands - cleaning the litter box of cat diarrhea is not my favorite.
Nicky gives so much of wrong information away. No good for anyone who really relies on that information. Many people have already written about the information:\n- no milk (kittens and cats are lactose intolerant)\n- leave the kitten alone when it just arrived and allow it to settle\n- adopt at least two kittens, not only one\nWhat I haven't read yet is about the age. Adopting a kitten when it's only 6 or 8 weeks old, is way too early. Kittens must not be separated from their mother until they're at least 12 weeks old! And please make sure that neither you or a family member has an allergy against cat hair before adopting.
Flagged and reported this video as hate speech.
Where are all the black and white cute vids and higinks
What about don't tickle a cats belly unless it's learning as it's not really something a cat wants nor accepts most of the time. It shows its belly as trust not as a sign for a belly rub.
The end was Savage as fuk
You can give a kitten goats milk it doesn't have as much sugar in it to upset the kittens tummy. All your vet. I use it when many cat isn't feeling good. I warm it before feeding it to him. He's 19 yrs old.
Im going to do cat animion soon but I'm lacking. A cat
If I had known this was a Nicky video, I would have clicked immediately because I like the way she says port of call...
Nicky 3
2 me there are 2 things about kittens to know. I love kittens.(adopted a blind on that was weeks from birth. Sadly died falling from a high spot. Sad sad moment.) 2 my landlord is antipets and he is evil....(it makes sense though pets can cause some issues.)
There are 2 cats in my neighborhood that I feed.  The boy enjoys leftover milk from my morning cereal.  The girl will generally leave it alone- unless the boy is around to drink it.
I like the way she says Kitten!
Milk no no cuddles, love,  playtime, and sleep ( with or without human) excuse me, my kitten is halfway up my curtains!!!
what pisses me off is people dumping kittens on the side of roads when shelters cant keep kittens there always adapted out. its fully grown cats and dogs that they have issues finding new homes for.
Good points. I like the presentations with Nicky. Lots of good information for cat parents or people thinking about becoming cat parents.
Good job recommending the shelters and rescue facilities.  They have so many cats both kitten and senior that need good homes!
I love Simon's Cat videos.  They remind me so much about my own four mystic moggies who, sadly, are no longer with us.
so are nicky and simon hooked up??    she's a diamond.........and she has an engagement ring on
Can you do What Things You Need To Know About Adult (or Senior) Cats?
You should probably say another animal's milk or cow's milk. It's strange and unhealthy for any being to drink the milk of a different species 💙 Not to mention the cruelty involved in obtaining milk from the mother.
can you do a video on feral cats?
I prefer 1+-year-old cats over kittens.  Sure, kittens are cute, but older cats are more level and easier to train (*less* distracted).  Also, you should point-out the importance of teaching basic commands (sit,  stay, down).  Many people let their cats get away with little/no training without seeing the complete joy of having a properly-trained cat.\nNeither of my cats had issues with milk.  They never got a lot, but a tiny bowl one or twice a month was a special treat.  Fluffy (20) even liked a little melted ice cream…when we had room in the freezer.  Tony (14) just liked a little milk, especially when he'd try to steal it from my Coonhound, Lilly.  You could tell that it was a power issue because he NEVER did that with Sue (15), our late Heeler mix.
That was very informative and very entertaining to watch good job Simon
I do find some of the narratives helpful and I learn something new everytime I see an episode!!
She's a cutie.
Loving this! I am the proud foster mommy of 5 tiny tumbling tigers.  It's so much fun to watch them learn and relate to my 4 adult cats, who have stepped in to help care for them by disciplining them, washing them and of course, playing. Trying to get staged photos of them is exactly like this, the minute one poses beautifully, one of their siblings or an adult cat steps right in.
Dear Simon's Cat friends. This is a public forum that kids looks at. Dropping F bombs arguing about cat food is ridiculous and juvenile. Remember, yours is just an opinion, not fact. Everyone is entitled to theirs. My cats are 14 ,15 and 17, are super healthy and have eaten Purina dry for half of their lives. Now they have Iams dry food. NO wet food. They have great teeth and seem really happy and playful. That works for me and them, but maybe not you. Be happy your pet is healthy and stick with what works for you. Try being nice to other people, and your pets will think you're pretty cool for acting like them.
My cat would follow my mum around every morning meowing what sounded like milk until she gave it to him. It wasn't until he got older that he had trouble with milk. He couldn't tell rice milk apart from cow milk. Either that or he didn't care. Later both he and his sister lost the ability to digest any kind of cat treat. We still wanted to reward good behavior. They had no problems with their kibble. So I simply put some kibble in a separate container. When they earned a treat, I got some from the special container. They were just as excited as if it were something other than what they always eat. So presentation was all that mattered. Cheaper too.
i love the cats 😻😻😻😻
My cat is highly lactose intolerant lol when she was a baby she used to get sick from her mums milk but she's healthy strong and beautiful
I just said goodbye to my senior kitty. The last thing I really wanted to do was bring kittens into the house but I was alerted to 16 kittens desperately needing homes. I took 2 home. I  am nursing an injured leg and need to rest it a lot.  The kittens insist that my face is the best place to lay down and sleep. I realize how bored I woul be without these 2 kittens!  Figaro and Octavia.
We recently got a beautiful black kitten from a rescue shelter. If anybody wants to see her then there's a video on my channel!
I have a kitten named Zeus and each time you cuddle with him he'll start sucking on a blanket or Whatever he can reach, i know this is from him being away from his mother too early, but i was was wondering if there is anything i should do?
Do yourself a favor and get an older cat from the shelter. Kittens are super cute but older cats are less likely to get adopted so they need you more. Plus they are much calmer and you will know exactly what kind of character they have. If you have ever experienced the havoc a kitten can wreak on your home, you know what I'm talking about.
You can buy Cat milk :)))
my cat sometimes goes on the couch, stick her paws into the cushions, then whips her head around meowing before doing flips and turns. If anybody is wondering she's a tortie calico mix.
It's a common misconception, that cats need milk. Is it? I always thought everyone knows, that cats WANT and LIKE milk but as all mammals they don't really need it. I was mislead by my brain... O.o

My cat had a wonderful 17year life he drank milk every day in our home and ate mice, birds and little rabbits, sometimes food from us but he preferred the natural food, most special cat food was disliked he was happy with our family and the garden nature outside of our house.
Yeah.. I'm not making the mistake of taking a cat from a shelter again. Or they got mental issues or they got health issues. Or most likely both.
My cat is a month old brother of God guided by a large cat Gap of the house and bite in the neck left and bleeding but with the passage of time stop the bleeding and we keep the wound and then the left eye is almost not see it and the tumor\nI think it's broken. Does anyone know how to fix this problem? Please 💔
Why do americans give their pets food names like butter and candy. I dont call my cat hamburger or ice cream. Thats the same to calling you're dog chair you dont do that XD
Can someone explain why sand bags are important?
I'd appreciate if you could check out my stuff.\nI quit college to make YouTube videos seriously.\n(My demographic is mostly guys, keep that in mind)
If you have to evacuate, then evacuate. Stop making a big deal about it
Hi everyone I'm hoping to be a professional YouTuber and a subscription would mean the world to me I'm hoping to get 200 subs and if you help me it would mean the world

When I went to every store for D batteries and I say sir do you have D batteries and he said D batteries Deez Nutz where sold out! \n\nThen I found D batteries at the Farm Store and paid 12 Bucks for.4 D batteries.
I live in Tampa and it fucking sucks bc until yesterday they said we weren't getting hit and now we're in the direct path and threw no way we can evacuate and all the shelters around us are full
Praying so hard for you guys right now!! Stay safe!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Saw this trending got excited but remembered it's not the same Alli :(
I want all of Florida to be leveled
Damnnn CTFxC still going strong? I've not watched for years.
Idk if people realized that almost this whole week plane tockets were 2k a pop and traffic as much as 48 hours
Evacuate. Why stay? You staying won't save you from a cat 5
Or make something to destroy the hurricane
Good news. It downgraded to cat 3. It should be a lot weaker now.
Guys stay safe also I got excited because I saw my country in the thumbnail.
This is getting crazy. Stay safe.
Evacuate. Staying back isn't worth it, honestly.
it's sad that you guys have to be hit by a deadly hurricane just get subscribers
I'm thinking about everyone in Florida right now and hoping that everything will be ok...stay safe and strong guys! My thoughts are with you all! 💕💖👍🏼
Shouldn't you be getting to safety rather than playing to YT?
Damn Charles been a while ur getting old looking and ur looks starting to fade
Why would you have to shit yourself?
Are your parents no longer together?
o let's cry about it 😭
Look up windy.com gives a live update an map of the world n weather.
What exactly are the sand bags for???
3:00 Charles as such a kind heart.  5:18 Gotta be that guy, but his name's Ghost Rider lol.  Most of this vlog shows much of a heart Charles has and it's fantastic :)
I fucking hate thumbnails like the one on this video.
That photo won't be from the space station, it's a lot closer to earth than a lot of people think! More like a really, really high flying aeroplane. Anyway, doesn't matter, it's an incredible image, good luck guys, stay safe, we're all think of you! xxx
He really likes the name Allie lol I haven't watched in a few years but there is a Different Allie now
Boi dat passed thru Puerto Rico and it didn't do anything. Everyone is over reacting. Well no but prepare and it will be fine.
Praying you and your family will be safe.
Ran out of sand?! LOL!! It's Florida!
Is he not uploading everyday anymore? Havent watched since the last allie lol
Keeping you all in my thoughts. Please be safe
It's to late to leave noe
It's weird but also interesting to see someone's point of view through the whole process of the situation
Wonder how bad it will be
🤣🤣🤣when I looked at the thumbnail I was laughing am dead cringing at the same time🤣🤣🤣 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️\nPPPSSSSSHHHHHH
Tape is horrible for your windows
Omg the sound effect when Marley was running! 😂😂😂😭
Don't forget your baby food
As someone living on the east coast, I feel bad for hoping the storm turned west more. I was planning on evacuating to Tampa, but that all changed today. Everyone saying “don’t be dumb, evacuate.” It’s not that easy. There are only 2 main highways that go North through Florida, and if you’re trying to leave the state, good luck hopping off and refueling. Last thing you want to do is run out of fuel on the road when the storm is coming. This is the bad scenario with FL, when a storm affects both coasts. There’s nowhere to go but North.
Dude just get out of there
What city do they live in?
Just dropped by to dislike for that dumb ass thumbnail.
please at least find cardboard for windows. They say tape isnt a good idea because if the window breaks youll have larger shards that could fling back out at you.
I say stay and see what happens. You've got plenty of dirt. Might wanna grab a poncho just incase though. It might rain.
dont be stupid leave now... there is no we might you will die if you stay  especially on that 2x4 built home....
Where I'm living now doesn't get Hurricanes, but they say we're long overdue for  a major quake!
Why aren't people subscribing to them. They've been at 1.4mil for like 5 years already 😡
An update your fucked irma is coming your way with the eye
You are driving for water.  Is the water that comes our of your tap not drinkable?  For the next storm just filter your tap water and have it in large water jugs.  Sorry do not mean to sound judgemental.  We have large levels on magnesium and rust in our water but it passes all tests from the hospital lab.  We tap off when a storm is coming.  Wish you and your family the best.
You can come to richmond hill ga stay with and our family we welcome you guys open arms exit 87
I'm in broward.
Taping your windows is a myth. It creates larger shards of glass if broken.
I somehow hope you see this, take the tape off your windows it's been proven all it does is cause the windows to break into larger shards of glass just causing more damage to you, family and dogs please be careful xx
You can take some Bass lessons while you wait out the storm .. LMAO
I live in Florida too,  sand bags do nothing when the shit hits the fan.
DO NOT TAP THE WINDOWS !!!NOT SAFE
You look exactly like heath hussar in the thumbnail
Will your ear gauges evacuate as well? 🌊👂
Stay dude I promise you won't die\n\nAnd if I'm wrong, well, ya can't really tell me anything, can you?
why does nobody cate about whats happening in burma !!!
Lol, westbro saying god is punishing you for voting Trump.
Glad YouTube put this on trending. I was looking you up yesterday to see what you were going through 👀 stay safe Charles!
Your entire state is fucked!!!! Lmao later Florida!
taping your windows does absolutely nothing
taping your windows litterly does nothing
I whas scared of hurricane dineo
Don't  bother,
dude tapping the windows actually makes it worse
Dirtbags....
Gtfo!
Enjoy the ride
MMMMM FUCK💦  HORNY AF?  OOOOO SHIT FUCK MEE TILL I CUM💦💦💦🔥🔥🔥😰😰 AND JERK OFF ..💦💦💦💦💦💦💦🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😘😘😘😍😍😍😍FUCK ME😍😍😍VIEW ME😍HURRY😍😍😍FUCK HARDER😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍FASTERzxx
Boo fucking hoo. your life could be 100x worse.

Who Cares
Stay safe
You can use mulch too!!!
Please die
Fuck yo thumbnail
fuk cornyass humans \n#pray4dogs
Stay safe!
Too much praying. \nNot enough evacuating.
#firsttimewatchingyou \nPlease be safe 🙃🙏🏻
DONT DIE!!!!!
😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😕
_We might have to evacuate_\n\n*But not before we make some profit from a natural disaster which has already caused massive damage.*\n\nUS capitalism at its 'finest.' \n\nIly Adblock+.
And one more dude, you are in Saint Petersburg! Your storm surge is gonna be katrina. You are in the bottle opener! You are so close to sea level. It is head more west so it is gonna come up the coast at you. You all need to be expecting more then you act like you are. Get out!
It's sad to see you are just wasting your time, a hurricane category 4-5 can destroy anything and considering you build your houses with wood, you don't have a chance. I will pray for you, but please, if you can leave, just do it.
this hurricane is so overhyped

He opened for Ed Sheeran and ALL his music was amazing! I was really impressed!
Does anyone know if he's going to release more tour dates? :(
So when's tinder online coming ?
I miss 2005
What did he even say at 2:07
Lmao, I didn't realize how funny he is. Too bad his music's gone down the shitter
🔥🔥🔥
Watch me close girls on Tinder. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArBZohPDpmc
How many bowls/candles/coasters/baskets can you possibly need in your everyday life? Once you have a set that's it you're fine, when they break you buy new ones. I'm sorry but this is just pure pointless consumerism.
OBSESSED with your hair and make up at the end. Could you do a tutorial? I'd love to wear that look for work :) xxx
so excited to move out and get my own place so I can start buying home stuff! <3
Ok I need to visit home sense like now! Xx
I've never understood why its Home Sense and TKMaxx in Europe and Home Goods and TJMaxx in the States... its the same company lol.
OMG it's soooo cute, OMG you neeeeed this, OMG I LOVE it.... etc etc.
This haircut suits you so so well
I NEED to go to Homesense. I want that fluffy stool you bought, in fact, I want the whole shop!

Wow did Homes Sense really pay for all that? x
Such cute decor!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
Also gasped with u when u found the two sets of coasters 😂🙏🏻🙏🏻#blessed
I love you and Alix. I enjoy watching you guys to do more home hauls together !!
You make me wear Balenciaga bag today! :) Since forever I haven't.
This HomeSense is so much bigger and has so much more than the ones in Canada! #jealous
Lol at the making your room a bit different, literally every vlogger goes to homesense and have the same style!
Hey guys please show some support to a small YouTuber ❤ We would love you to subscribe if you like the content ❤👍
I loved this video 😍 take my 💰 home sense!! I'm in Australia though & I don't think we have those shops here.... We only just got Tkmaxx. Please come to Melbourne home sense! 😋
As a vlogger myself I would love to go shopping with you two. #dreamteam
where is alix's dress from?
OMG go back for the ottoman!! You will spend the rest of your life regretting it if you don't! ITS SO NICEEEEEE
Yes to the ottoman I think Rory and Nala would like jumping on it though :-) loved this video some really nice home ideas thank you ! X
You have to get that blue ottoman xxx
love this haul! really appreciate you stating the prices :) cheers xx
This makes me super excited to move out, I've started to buy little bits but I've got a home sense near me so definitely going to pop and buy a few things!
I picked up those coasters the other day!! I'm definitely going to go to my local homesense and see if I can pick up that plant pot, I love it!!!
No homesense in Holland :( and they don't deliver internationaly. But it would be a lot more expensive anyway going from pound to euro..
Hey! Loved this vlog and all the bits you picked up! How much was the velvet blue ottoman pls? XX
Liked this vlogg alot!! Please do more like this💖💖And get the blue chair from homesense it was soo nice😍💙
Love home hauls and home style vids! Defo get the blue ottoman xxx
Which homesense did you visit? I need to go!!
This didn't feel like an ad at all, really nicely done and authentic! Love the marble coasters. They also do the best candles ever, so affordable!
I need to go to homesense now! Not been for ages but looks like they've improved! Great finds! Btw where is your red dress from? & the red lippie? Matched perfectly! X Deb xx
Your living room is lovely!!
Gorgeous buys! Which Homesense was this Susie? My closet one is around 40mins away and sadly nowhere as nice 😐
Lovely video! I'm looking for some new homewares to jazz up my bedroom, so this video is perfect of inspiration! :)\nAlso, I know you probably get told this all the time, but you and Alix are the definition of #squadgoals - I love both your channels so much xxx Daisy :)\nhttps://daisychaindaydreamsblog.wordpress.com
I loved this video! All I want to do now is shop for home stuff :)
Omg get the navy ottoman it's lush xxxx
I'm going to homesense tomorrow ....they better have those coasters.  I need them in my liffffee! 😍
Love videos with you both!!
Absolutely love your vlogs, you look beautiful with a bright lip 😍😙
Im in love with your red dress and really wish we had a shop like that where I live, everything looks gorg 😍😍
This made me so happy hahahaha <3
Okay, 1) that was the dream girls day! I need to do something similar asap. 😂 2) love your style! That rug is dreamy. Xoxo, caylie
I live home hauls in the US it's called HomeGoods and TJ Maxx both are my favorite
I love your home hauls sooo much! They are my favourite things to watch! Also, where are your glasses from when you were showing us the haul, they are gorgeous!!
Buy the navy ottoman! It will look great in front of your bed and you can put your blankets and cushions in there :)
SUZIE YOU NEED THAT BLUE VELVET OTTOMAN IN YOUR LIFE BABE
I've seen so many vlogs with home sense in them lately and it's making me soooo jealous, I live in Northern Ireland so even though we're in the UK we don't have one.
Home sense is so much bigger in the UK! Canadian ones (that I've been to, anyway) do not have this much selection.
Awwh it's so lovely to see how you're putting together your house- it's looking absolutely lovely, and that home sense looks amazing! I know this might have been filmed a little while back but just thought i'd ask if you know which red lip stick you are wearing on the last clip? It's the perfect shade or even if  anyone knows of one similar it would be a huge help :)
Excellent video! Such an amazing sponsor- wow! Do more like this!
Good evening, I thoroughly enjoy your haul! I love everything you  bought, but my favourite ones are the grey chair and the stool. They are to die for. I live in Barbados. Gosh I can't get over how much I just love your stuff. Do you know if they have a website and if they ship outside England? Thanks and do enjoy your stuff, it's gorgeous. You have excellent taste! Kudos to you!
I just love your style.  your haul videos are my favorite ones EVER..the colour palette is amazing.
Please please how much was the pink velvet chair?? 🙏🏻
Loved this style video and all the bits you bought! Home sense is my fav too! ❤️
Love your tan on body
That homesense in hedge end is in the middle of nowhereee
What lipstick are you wearing when showing the haul? Super pretty on you
Amazing haul!!! Never been to home sense but I am going tomorrow!!
I love a home haul. I recently had my own home shopping spree from TK Max' (no homesense near me) and had to stop myself buying everything (I only live in a studio flat😂) also spotted those coasters online at tk max bagged them straight away because I had an anthropologie one and had wanted some more  but saved myself some money
Loved this! Makes me want to go and raid Homesense now. I spied a couple of plasters in this video, are they the new tattoos you mentioned when you got your last two? Great video, your's and Alix's friendship is major friendship goals and reminds me a lot of my friendship with my best friend xxx
I love all the things you found in Homesense!  I'm from the US and I have a TJ Maxx and Homegoods (same as TX Maxx and Homesense) right next door to my house and I love going in there but your Homesense seems to have much better higher quality things. I'm a newer subscriber of yours and I love all your come shopping with me videos.  Keep them coming :)  BTW, has anyone told your friend Alix that she looks like Drew Barrymore?  I think she totally does.  You girls are both so lovely.  Ok, I'll stop fangirling now :'D
What lipstick are you wearing at 09:14? It looks beautiful :)
I am glad you got all the things you like. Beauty as they say is in the eye of the beholder as most of what you bought was not to my taste but then I like a plainer style of homewares and you probably wouldn't like the decor in my house! 😊
I love this style of videos from you 🎀
Your glasses are amazing! Where are they from?\nBtw I'm loving your videos lately  a lot!
I love how you both enable each other! NZ needs a home sense! Amazing stuff!!
The sheer joy on your face when you saw that acorn is exactly the way I feel in home stores. I love it all but my weaknesses are baskets and throw blankets.
Ha so weird, I was at this store about 2 hours ago and re living my trip through your vlog
Where is this Homesense? :o
Love your necklace in this!! Where's it from? X
Would you ever consider getting a bigger dog? \nYes go get the blue ottoman!!!! The coasters looked amazing\nYou look great in glasses/hair up/orange-y lip!
I love this!! Your style is amazinggg! Where are you glasses from that you're wearing at the end of the video?
loving your home content! making me wanting to buy everything. Can I ask where you got your glasses from, they are very pretty, i love slim frame. xx
Please which Homesense is this? I mean the location, Thanks
Is that the store in Hedge end I used to work at tk Maxx and done some work at that store when it first opened I love It!!
Oh my! You were in my homesense!! That place is within walking distance of my home!!
i'm not here for too long- is she moving in with her boyfriend? :)
Great taste!
Loved hearing blossoms in the background of home sense
Its so funny buy something for house, I know!! \nI love everything you bought, especially the pillows 😍
You need to do more videos like this!!!! 💕
You look soo beautiful! Where is your top from? X
You need to come decorate my house!
Anyone notice the two plasters?
First of all love your homeware haul 😊secondly love this look of yours , tied hair and these glasses on .....really suits you....you look sooo pretty 😍
Is that the Hedge end/Southampton homesense?
where are your glasses from? love them :)
Hello\nIf you like the video, then follow me auf Social Media. LOS! \nThe link ist in der Description.\n\nDanke
This shit cracks me up!!! I dated a German girl who ranted about the EXACT SAME thing years ago. I love Germans, y'all so serious about everything:)
The problem with suddenly pronouncing things the way they are originally meant to sound is that everyone then thinks you're a cunt.\nImagine joining a conversation with some friends about Paris, but every time you speak you say Paree.  Thats right.  Noone wants to talk to you anymore.\nHowever the fact that some people can't pronounce Audi right IS fucked.  I'm looking at you, America.
BMW= British Motor Works.
In Spanish we say it just like in German, it's the same xD
this is pretty much the same how we say it in swedish lol
Lol...it's Bayrische MotorEN Werke... not Motor
Let me get this straight. This guy is angry because other countries pronounce German car names the wrong way? At the same time, he's pronouncing English words the wrong way. Big fucking LOL to that!
What kind of fucktard would pronounce Audi as OH-DEE? I'm American and that makes no fucking sense to me. There's a fucking A and a U, neither of which make a fucking OH sound in English or German.\n\n\nSeriously if you hear someone pronounce Audi as OH-DEE *beat them to death*, because they're likely alien imposter in human form.
It's pronounce THis not ZISS. Get it right! Good night!
This video is golden.
No your going to tell us
this is not beer, this is peepee water, because it is swiss. lol. im a german hanging out in grenchen/swiss
Sounds similar as we pronounce them in spanish, except for BMW.
Lol in romania is just like in germany the pronuntion
I agree with you. I seem native English speakers can not understand one other.
In finland we already pronounce the names right.
auf der heide blüht ein kleines blümelein
I remembered just enough from my Deutsch classes that I knew these - but this was really enjoyable :) Danke schön :)
jeder weiß ...HAHAHA!
Subscribed! Hahaha! Do American car brands next and let's see how they react.
something something different languages
We indians pronounce it correctly
Danke Sehr.
Vot Du Ferkin Vos Dat.
Smh
If you have a faulty BMW it is a Bayerisch Mist Wagen
geniess dein Calanda :D
wunderbar
He sounds like fps Russia
Haha German :)
Genial!
I did Nazi that
Sorry but nobody yes NOBODY pronounces Audi as Ordi. Not even in England lol
The one thing I didn't already know was the quick version of Volkswagen in German
Dude, what's wrong with your arm?
Where did you get a SharpSpring shirt? I work there.
How do I pronounce Michael Schumacher?
What is the song name?
Fun thing is my parent is actually German so i already know this when i was 5 years old
You have the OPEL one completely wrong!\nIt is pronounced VAUX HALL!
Well at least I can pronounce squirrel
You forgot to explain how Mercedes-AMG is pronounced! Btw very useful and funny as hell video :P
sorry
If i say it wrong the Nazi police will come get me, and this video proves it lol.
ok, then please spell all foreign brands the right way and we'll do the same ... oh right ! you can't !
It's pronounced Drumpf, not Trump!
Calanda bräu z beschda wo's je häts gits
this was fun :)) \nbtw, in the description of the video you wrote propery, instead of properly
Interestingly enough, he missed the German made car Pantera.  Pretty cool video though.  I Wonder what kind of beer that was he was drinking and why it wasn't a German beer.  I would've expected to see him drink Becks or Kostritzer.  Aufweidersehn.
What a shame he got it wrong.  BMW stands for Bayerische MotorEN Werke - not Bayerische Motor Werke.    Failed again
Bester Mann! :D sehr geile Aktion ^^ mach weiter mit den guten Videos und eine gute Woche dir !
I lofe your backkround muzik, Adolf! 🖕
I guess it's supposed to be a joke. Because complaining about how people pronounce a name in their own langage when the guy can't pronouce english with a correct accent is kinda ironic.
I can't tell you how many things you pronounced in English wrong...  (shakes head)..
haha sooo funnnnnyyyy, not
Oh I loved Light My Fire! Also loved that you know The Doors 👌🏻
Every colour suits you!!!😍
Keep your hair long! Looks sooooo nice!💕
Please please please could you do a Claudia Winkleman makeup tutorial? Love her makeup and there's no tutorials anywhere :/
Love that wet look eye, and that last colour is just DREAMY!
thanks for sharing love the colours. and YES to the chop! why not! love love x
London calling for me! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Could you do a video on how you think the make up industry is changing and what you like/dislike about the movement make up is making nowadays, would love to know your thoughts! X
If you're still thinking about cutting your hair off, this might be of interest: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/ghd-little-princess-trust-cancer-chop-to-the-chin-charity-a7933501.html
Do you find these to be drying? Some matte lip products I've found to be very drying.
What's on your eyelids? So cool.
Loooove the lipsticks ! I think I would cut my hair of I were you.... after a shitty year it always feels like a fresh start... xxx
I love it longer!
PLEASE REVIEW THE FENTY BEAUTY LINE
Hi. Was wondering if you could give me some advice. I have an oily t-zone but I get very dry and I suffer from eczema especially around my eyes. Whenever I wear a fuller coverage foundation it never lasts on my skin, I find that I produce more oily even when it's a matte foundation. My skin is very dull but I try and take care of it the best I can. Shall I stay away from a higher coverage foundation? Is it why I'm getting more oily throughout the day? \nI would just like a long lasting foundation that doesn't make me skin look dull
Don't cut your hair
which is the lovely eye shadow you are wearing???
These colors are all pretty amazing. :)
Hi Pixi! Can I ask what eyelash curler you prefer the best? Your lashes are so up! Or maybe you could do a video about it :) GIRLS LIKE ME NEED HELP! <3
Sam I'm so jealous. Damn...  every color lipstick looks great on you. I wish I could pull off these lipsticks, but some of the colors just won't look good on me.
London Calling is amazing. It would go really well with my purple hair xD
I love your hair!
Keep it on! Your hair is great!
The pulling out enthusiastically and getting it everywhere part, I just can't hahahaha
I vote for a long bob 👏👏👏 it will look great on your wavy shiny hair 😍
I need London Calling in my life!!! ❤️
Who would think that you are 40? You look amazing!
I think u should defo cut ur hair, u would totally rock a blunt bob 👌🏼 Xx
Just ordered star woman on your recommendation
You look gorgouse .. chop that hair off
Love your makeup! You look so beautiful!
I was eyeing these up in store the other week - having seen them on you, Star Woman & Under my Thumb are definitely top of my wishlist now!
I think you'd look great with a shorter haircut !
I think you both look glorious in long hair!
A cut to the shoulder would be nice, also like the lid color, what is that?
Looking forward to the tutorial for this look, Healthy Glow Make up...amazing!!
That first nude one was so gorgeous 💛
All these shades make your eyes pop so much. Your eyes are stunning omg x
could you please do a review of new Dior Rouge liquid lipsticks!!!?
Lestoil.  Don't know if you have it over there, but it removes all oils....least all I've gotten on clothes😬
I have London calling and under my thumb
Keep it! And the color is great, too! 💆🏻
I always admire people that do liquid lip lip-swatches hahaha they're such a pain in the ass to do! thank u sam!
I was in Dublin for work and went to boots and bought the sponge and the concealed brush (years of craving them).Cant wait to use them!!!!
Oh God! Every color suits you !!!! Beautiful as always Xx
Its crazy how your look changes so much just by changing the lip colour.
Hey Sam, could you please recommend a good matte red lipstick with blue undertone from the drugstore? Looking gorgeous as always btw! And I loooove your hair, don´t get them chopped too much though :D xx
Do you avoid coffee and red wine or do you do something to make your teeth so beautifully white?
No leave your hair alone! Like the nude apricot best, then the last 2 reds...
Love these sorts of videos - thank you! And I'm desperately looking for long-lasting lipsticks that are minimal maintenance. I've been going high street for the moment but maybe I need to trade up. Thx again! Xx
A nice lob would be great for fall- very easy to care for and won't get caught in sweaters!
You have such glorious hair that I would perhaps add more layering, but cut it shorter, nah. \n\nI wish you would do more videos here again, since the live ones on Instagram go away.... 😕🙏🏻
Go for the chop babe!
Long bob!!  Get a lob, Sam!
Watching this as you lob off you pr hair!!
Yeahhhh chop it off! Shorter hair looks so chic in autumn/winter 🍂🍂
Every single one of those colours is amazing and they all look great on you!
i love how they're named after good fucking songs
Gorgeous!!! And please don't cut ur hair...i would like to see you in long hair. So please grow it.
Cut it change is good .... But honestly your stunning no matter what
I love this eye makeup! I can't wait for the video!
How beautiful you are!
Loved that currant shade on you! ❤️
Xse vedio
A bunch of great colours. 💜❤️ And yes, go for the cut! It sounds cool and if it isn't it'll grow back. (An obvious comment, haha.)
LOOOOOOOOONG Hair!
Can you do a tutorial on the eye look? Every time I try to do a glossy eye look it melts away my eyeliner and makes it look messy. How do you keep everything in place when doing it? Thank you!!
Did I miss a video on how to do an ombre lip? Would love to see you gorgeous girls teaching this in a matte lip👄\nAnd I just watched your Favorite Lipsticks video from Nov '15 and, just my personal opinion, but your current longer hair is just very youthful and stunning!! Much love from Alabama❣️
Yes, haircut. I vote just above shoulder-length (like you suggested), possibly a shag. You've got enough hair that that would look so killer. :-D
Hey Sam. I really like the look of those but will be hard to choose which colour to get. On the hair front - I recently cut my hair into a choppy bob and I love the shorter hair. Go for it - it hair - if you don't like it, it will grow back xx
Yeaahhhhh girl, cut that hair. I vote yes.
Коралловый очень вас очень освежает и молодит! Супер!
Amk bn sizi TLC den izliyom #sonşanskliniği
Where your earrings from?
Ur so pretty
Terrible !!!!! colors
Yesss! Cut the hair!! Something edgy, and fresh. Doooo itttt!!!
Cheek bone goals
💕👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Love your hair!
Yeeeessss chop it off!! It'll look sooo good against your sharp jawline 😍😍😍
Did anyone ells think the thumbnail was Katelynn jenner
chop it! hair always grows.
You really suit red 😘 💋
love your hair keep it long you look sexy ur sooo cute
You have such a dazzling bone structure. Very beautiful face.
All the colors looked gorgeous on you!
i would love to see a tutorial on your eye look - you look absolutely stunning! :) <3
I say cut your hair! Honestly you could do anything to your hair and you'll look stunning!!
looking gorge as always Sam! i love the colours done it again and starwomam! and about your hair i think you should keep the length but make it less heavy giving it lots of texture. the colour for autumn looks fab, maybe more of those chunky cooper highlights/balayage through the ends keeping the base colour!
I think you'll cut it no matter what we tell you, the idea is already in your head  😂 I just went through the same thing and chopped mine off 🙈
Don't you dare cut your hair! You currently have the cut of my dreams but my hair is not thick enough for that. It looks sensational!
chop your hair! it will always grow back :) love this video, there wasnt a colour that didnt suit you!
All the colors look stunning on you!
Hi Sam!! Absolutely loving you!           \nI'm Sitting at home watching the X Factor and admiring Sharon osbourne's makeup! Could you do a tutorial pls. I love her eyes!
Hi Sam, loved all the colours on you, beautiful 😍 Did you find the nars formula drying at all? I've tried the mac liquid lipsticks but they just make my lips crack.
Having to sift through comments to delete weird sex spam..seriously what is with people. Love this video though, so happy that you don't follow suit to the rest of the beauty community with the ridged 'instagram' style makeup x
Love, love and love some more! What gorgeous colors!!! And Sam, you would look beautiful bald! But i do envy your beautiful hair!!! Ty for sharing these!
Please disable the comments on this video.  You are being spammed by terrible people.  =(
You would look great with any hairstyle, last colour is my favourite
No matter what you say about Oscar and his cross dressing and cocaine ways... He is 100% right. Floyd has been serving up so much BULLSHIT yet morons and nuthuggers keep buying it and swallowing that shit like it's nectar of the gods.
I always wanted to know what was with the fishnets.
I thought Delahoya was in great shape when he fought Floyd. It could've went anyway I don't believe that b.s about Oscar being over the hill. That was a pretty even match up. Both great fighter. Not a fan of Floyd
*Well, regardless of his opinion. The MayMac boxing match turned out pretty good. It was entertaining ✅😎*
23:47 bullshit.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LWDTLFtGFHU\n\n9 months ago, Oscar was talking about McGregor vs Canelo at 160lb being the only fight that made sense for Conor in boxing. Canelo is bigger, stronger, younger and a thousand times more dangerous than Floyd Mayweather Jr in a ring today but Floyd is the scumbag for fighting him? btw, if you were unaware, the ring doctor confirmed that Conor suffered very mild brain trauma following his fight with Floyd. yet Oscar sits there talking smoke about Floyd when he was ready to put Conor in the ring with a guy so much more dangerous in Canelo for an even more one-sided event that would have made so much less money. bottom line is; Oscar just loves to dig at Floyd. he beat your ass, and cleaned out the top fighters in your stable including your top attraction who coincidentally happens to be the fighter you were interested in matching Conor against only 9 months ago. go home Oscar.
Charlamagne tried to come for Oscar and he shut that shit down! But I would never hit women! 👊👊
canelo lost a suit for 8 million and he could not pay so he signed for this fight. He will get destroyed for this reason.
oscars son Devon and his latest fight video\nhttps://youtu.be/PNmWB6Zo4KU
De La Hoya is taking a lot of shots at Mayweather. He's just jealous and bitter.
To get to fight you have to be signed with a promoter Stone age
I was riding with Floyd since he Pretty Boy way before Money May days. But I love and respect all boxers my favorite sport.
18:28 YES FLOYD MAYWEATHER WAS SIGNED TO GOLDEN BOY OWNED BY OSCAR DE LA HOYA
Charlemagnes one and only purpose in life is playing a black victim
I watched Cotto vs Kamegai that same night and I still saw the whole Mayweather vs McGregor and trust me the Cotto fight was WAAAAAAAY BETTER!!
Oscar is 4 yrs older than Floyd when they fought Oscar was 34, Floyd was 30. He need to stop acting like he was damn near 40 and Floyd was 26 or something.
He won't hit women just dress up like one WTF ctfu
CTFUUU  I died when I spoke on the fishnetgate!!! Yo I remember he was in fishnet, heels and boxing gloves ... SAVAGE ..Thank God, Oscar is in a better place. He looks great!
Its not floyd fault there wasnt anybody out there that woulda been favored over him lol wtf oscar talking about?
How are you a cross-dresser and coke head and say what you don't like about somebody's personal life?? WTF
I'm sooooo glad CTheGod asked him about the lingerie pics 👙😂
This was a good interview
😂😂 oscar still upset floyd whooped that ass, is still undefeated and a few hundred milli up 😂😂
She stay asking the worst questions ever wtf
I can definitely respect how he answered the questions about drugs and alcohol. He didn't even flinch and that's a hard thing to admit that it was the hardest fight in life and you're getting knocked down every day. They did ask about mayweather a lot even when he was talking about other stuff. But overall, this was a great mature interview
This guys such a lier he wanted to match mcgregor with canelo LOL
Fishnets? He had prostitutes put dildos in his ass. AND THERE ARE PICS OF IT!!!!!!!! Don't recommend googling tho 😩🙈
Everyone who follows boxing has always said this about boxing-that it sucks because the best are not fighting the best at their best and it's all corrupted.  I think the sales/viewers  prove this statement...
Wait, Tyson Rape a women , he loves him. mayweather is in an abusive relationship he hates him
He dont even know whos on the undercard
Wow..... hypocrisy!!! how can one harper on about another mans domestic violence, are you clark kent??? are really that a against it or is it cause Floyd did to you what he did to that girl??\n im so lost... since when do crossdressing crackheads have an opinion?? but lowkey..  when you think about it, a crossdressing man would have an issue with domestic violence..
Oscar De La Hoya SNITCHING on Floyd!!!!! Floyd and Conor completely FUCKED UP the GGG/CANELO fight!!!! No one cares about this fight now!!!! Mayweather threatened to do it last year on Cinco de Mayo weekend!!!! Now Oscar comes to hiphop radio to promote this fight!!! Mayweather vs Canelo totally eclipsed this fight
21:40  He said Louis Armstrong was in his top 5 boxers.  Joe Louis is who he probably meant to say
TBH if golden boy didnt exist boxing would be boring and dead!
This dude is a clown 🤡
Hahaha his answer tho , it was just a bad time in my life hahaha wat does that mean lol
I never did like the golden flake but I always thought the fishnet pics were doctored up. What a fucken FAG
That starbucks cup is his fix
Floyd proved that his old ass needs to stayed retired lol
Oscar De La Hoya you are a true Champion dear Sir and an honor to the sport of Boxing, you spoke with truth and honesty in this interview, Respect!! p.s I know is in the past man, but sincerely I always thought you won that Tito Ortiz fight way back then.
Hoya is kinda speaking the truth! we see better fights on WorldStar!!!!
Mayweather surpassed your legacy and is in many people's top 5 List. The envy is apparent.
Fruity in the booty ass boy
This dude proposed canelo v mcgregor. Hypocrite just mad he isn't a part of the $$
I know this fool ain't talking bout what's disrespectful to boxing when he appears in many photos wearing women's lingerie looking like a Tranny!
Oscar it's legend
What was going on with you in the ligerie? Hahaha.
Oscar De La Hoya admits he LIED about drag pictures; his punk ass paid $20 million to model to keep it hidden!
he gives off a sleazy car salesman vibe.
Please, if Oscar put this together he would not be talking all this sht
You can tell he did something really gay and is really embarrassed
I'm on vacation in Portugal day of the fight, anyone know if they show the boxing matches down there? I know in other countries they have PPV fights for free.
Oscar De La Hoya is speaking the truth GGG vs Canelo is a real fight nobody is gonna be punching themselves out a great fight the whole way.
DeLaHoya is funny to me.  He smiles, but he packs a lot of anger, which enhanced his boxing career.
Pretty boy is now worth 5X's more than the Golden boy. LOL KARMA....
I appreciate Oscar's honesty here....and for those of you wondering, he meant Hammerin' Hank Armstrong, not Louis Armstrong (Jazz great).
Lol this is a maywether interview
Ahahahaha Charlemagne had to ask that lingerie question lmao
Pacquaio in his prime? HE IS 2 YEARS YOUNGER THAN FLOYD when was he supposed to fight him? Manny will always be younger than Floyd so waiting to fight benefited Pacquiao not Mayweather. \n\nAlso, Oacar was only 34 when he fought Floyd so ge was not over the hill. Floyd fought an in prime Cotto, Maidana and Canelo ALL after he was 34... \n\nAND! He was was the first promoter trying to get Mcgregor in the ring to v Canelo yet he mocks a Floyd Conor fight? This guy just talks out of his ass.
Floyd beat your wanna be well spoken college professor ass. Take it like a man
hard time in my life.. wtf kind of response was that.. was he crossdressing and getting paid to give blow jobs on the street?  rofl wtf.. I would have just said that i was with this crazy broad and was drunk and made a fool out of myself.. something..  jesus.
Someone needed to call out Dela hoya on A LOT of statements here. Him saying old school fighters didn't carry each other is completely wrong, they did it all the time so older fighters could get more fights in the future EX: Sugar ray robinson vs. Henry Armstrong.
this guy is confused, he talks about if you can change your life around ( mike tyson) ... but cant respect Mayweather for what he did back in his day...
Oscar is now saying it's a farce and a circus for Mcgregor to have taken a boxing match???\n\nWhen this fight was first coming together Oscar said he wanted to sign Mcgregor and it made all the sense in the world for Connor to fight Canelo.\n\nThe video is here:\nhttps://www.sportsjoe.ie/mma/oscar-de-la-hoya-wants-conor-mcgregor-to-come-and-fight-for-him-105407\n\nIs there one damn interview where someone calls Oscar out on this??? WTF.
Envy : so tell the people what fishnets are...
If your fighting all the time and you have to be aggressive all the time, i'm not surprised dude got all coked out and ended up doing some freaky shit lol.
Del La Hoya is a legend without question.
De La Hoya knows jack sh*t about MMA. Conor McGregor ain't sh*t an is not the very best. He ain't even top 15 in any weight and that's being honest! He's not fighting the very best. The very best he fought was Jose Aldo who hadn't lost in 7 years or more, never gave him a rematch.  He fought a scrub to win the LW title and won't fight the best now at Lightweight. He's protected.
hmm.. so mr De La Hoya respects Mike who also had woman abuse chargers, but he doesnt respect Floyd for the same thing ...
Such a liar. Canelo fought at 155 (above Super WW) for 2 years then comes into fights at 175! But he's not a middleweight?!?!
Mayweather beat him and his whole stable he shouldn't really speak on Floyd. We all know If he was involved in the that fight he would've been telling everyone he gave Connor the blueprint
They set him up....to clown him for someone (guesses?)......street shit....do you see the gay flag in the background right behind his head....they prepared for that fishnet question about something 10 years ago and that question is relevant how now?
Charlemagne tryna see how Oscar looks in that lingerie 😭😂
Oscar was lieing on that last question he filed bankruptcy before so he must have done something dum with money
Charlemagne first question is the shit.non English speaking guys
Oscar is mad he missed out on all that money!
Disrespectful to boxing? Thats funny because De La Hoya wanted to have canello fight mcgregor before all of this
Also, don't act like your dad doesn't do coke. Its a pretty common drug. It's not like he was smoking meth behind a dumpster, let's be real about that. People just hang on floyds nuts so they use his same insults.
Mayweather!
His lefty pinky finger is so fucked up...
Parkinsons catchin up wit de la hoya. All that stutterin
dela ho is a panzy
chalemagne keep bringingin up mayweather chill de la hoya gave him his props lol

I love Finn and Jeremy. They were both so cute in the interview.
I've seen all of them without a shirt honestly..... on it
Is that  a girl lol
0:33 the face I make when I realize I have a math test... XD
Watching this as you guys have 666K subscribers
I’m here when they got 666k subs😜
Finn is a very nice looking specimen
S S S S S A V A G E\nM O O O O O O D E
I LOVE EDDIE SO FUCKING MUCH
I watch this on 666K subs 😮
Ok this channel is scary they have the IT cast and at the moment I'm typing this this channel has 666K subs
I love them is so much cause their all 12-15 and I'm 13 and it makes me happy seeing them all and I want to marry them all. 😄 and also I wish I was Sofia
Whoa... this channel has 666k subscribers and they are talking about scary stuff
This cast is so frickin good. I'd watch a sitcom with all 7 of them right now. Doesn't have to be on the same source material, just the same 7 actors with somewhat similar characters all in one show. Someone please make that exist
ok so the movie just came out like 5 days ago and they alredy look 10 x older
A 3 min video with an unskippable ad. This video deserves its 55 dislikes:/
1:23 I listened with my headphones on I thought it was a gun shot outside😶
This entire comment section is extemely cringy and creepy.
I'm literally in love w/ Jaeden.
SO CUTE ALL OF THEM.
The new version really sucked
Why did that gorgeous young woman cut of almost all of her hair?
I watched the new IT movie today omg I love it
The movie was so good, but the kids were the best part. They were hilarious
stranger things kid got a whole weirdo but philosophical thing goin on
lol the It cast is probably one of my favorites
I think going too Home Depot would be cool because you can pick up a wrench and be like *holds up wrench with death stare*
Excuse me when did Finn's voice get so deep?! No! He should still be a baby!!
How much does Beverly weigh because she is my goals
Stan and Richie sound considerably older than they did in the film haha
One time back in 7th grade I was talking to my teach but my brain was in like 12 different places so as we were walking off I accidentally said bye I love you to her and just ran off
They're all so cute!
Wyatt is so sweet, his little smiles and laughs arggghhhhh
Jeremy looking into the camera at 0:33 killed me
Playing in the sandd
I really need a Jack kind of person in my life lol
I LOVE CHOSEN SO MUCH GAHH
ive called a lot of my teachers and friends mom b4 lol.
WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TOILET PAPER ON UR SHOE AND FINN HONKS AT JACKS JOKE LMAO IM LAUHJGIN
I freaking love these kids. If I could be friends with all of them I would. XD
when i was little i used to called one of my teachers mom
the movie is out now so the IT cast is dead ???
This is the best cast ever they are all so funny and sweet to each other 🎈❤️

Man this cast is fucking amazing
Jeremy and Jack are the loves of my life
Bro the movie isn't that scary it more funny
I think I called Jeremy mom the other day- Anyways.\n\n*Jeremy looks into the camera like the Office*
When there's no more toilet paper 😭😱
2:12 I agree with you 1000%
This movie was awesome. I am in love with this cast! Fantastic!
I want to say all of this people are adorable but I'm pretty sure they're my age 😂
They should take over teenvogues snapchat bc i would watch the fuck outta that

Raining blood
I LOVED IT!
Jaeden, love me goddamnit.
Laik si buscabas un comentario en español y el mio te saco una sonrisa :v
spider man is better than it
The makeup artist is so considerate of people with not much money and people who aren't good at makeup, very refreshing given the late trend of online makeup artists not being very helpful and just doing their makeup on camera and using incredibly expensive makeup. Her tricks are really clever and easy too!
Omg the model looks so much like Jen Atkin!
I can see the headlines now... Toilet seat covers disappear all over the US from public restrooms, and no one knows why...
Dear Lisa, when your reach 2 million subscribers can you do the ultimate giveaway and do the makeup of one of your subscribers. That would be incredible. I look through all the comments and everyone (girls and boys too) would be over the moon for that opportunity!  - xoxo, Tiff
I love when you bring guest artists on your channel. So cool seeing their different techniques and perspectives. I love that Amy used Rimmel products. That lip enhancer was beautiful!
Wow. I love Amy. This gave me the chills.
Love Amy! and I Love the colour of your lips Lisa.
I adore the way Ms. Valli has zero hesitation with any of the products she is using, you don't see that from makeup artists very much any more. Thank you again Lisa, for a wonderful video!
Am I the only one who thinks Lisa's videos are so relaxing and therapeutic to watch? I love them so much
It's so lovely to watch and listen to true professionals at work. What an honour it would be to have a make uplesson from any of the guest artists Lisa chooses, or even better, from Lisa herself 💙
Glue or gel in eyebrows can be dangerous on a smoker. I burned mine once in a wedding party (perfect make up) the flame of the lighter was big  and yyyyooouufff \nThe tip of each hair disapeared 📛🚭
Hmmm I thought the model looked gorgeous before the makeup
I have used that toilet seat cover trick for about two decades, lol. She is right. It's like the exact same texture as oil blotting papers.
You are so beautiful❤️❤️
LOVED LOVED THIS... WHERE ARE VALLI'S RINGS FOR GODS SAKE¿?????????
Valli is hilarious!!! Please have her come back for more looks! Amy - what a look!
These eyebrows are amazing, they're not like those wiggly worms everyone seems to be doing THE SHADEEE LMAO. I hate them too though
I feel bad noticing Lisa's winged liner in a video about Amy Winehouse's makeup, but I can't help it. I reckon it's done with black or grey eyeshadow. If there isn't a tutoria already, I'd love to see one
Amy did wear a lot of orange blush that had a highlighter like shine and would sometimes wear blue under her bottom lashes (blue liquid liner) but that was more 2003-2007 Amy Winehouse. She often wore a hot pinky red liner too
It's gorgeous. This look is so exciting and in the same time I feel sad. I miss this incredible talented  female. Amy was unique.
I love this video, thanks Lisa for bringing such talented artist into your channel, you both are gifted
Such a good video, thanks so much for sharing this. :)
So refreshing to see a genuine established makeup artist on YouTube for a change, thanks Lisa and thanks Valli for all the great tips! Xx
I love how Amy was such a British girl, she used rimmel I'm a little shock. Also I love how Valli use all the tools that are in style now and she's very knowledgeable about all the new trends. She's awesome. Great video
The Amy makeup tutorial was amazing , and also ur makeup in the video is amazing can u do it for us in a video , you are so classy and talented I love you ❤️
The model looks like lady Gaga
Can you do a bridgette neilson look?
I honestly thought Amy did her own makeup
Amazing. This video feels like a gift. Thank you Lisa and Valli O'Riley!
Loved watching this so much, watched it twice in a row! She has such a soothing voice and she was so gentle. I hate to see rough make up artists with the models flinching!
Amy Whinehouse was one of my favorite artists.  This was an amazing tutorial!  Love when you have guests.  So much you can learn.  😚
sooooo beautiful i dont even know what to say
Hearing her name still breaks my ♥. There will never be another artist quite like her. She is inimitable.  What a terrible loss for us all that she died so young.
What an amazing video. The model has such a beautiful face and the end result looked so much like Amy Winehouse. Valli made it look so easy when she was adding the subtle touches of highlight around the eyes - such talent!  Thanks, Lisa and Valli for this video.
I looove how the model resembles Amy so well
I always loved her mix of classic and glam. She always made me think of a young Sophia Loren. Thank you Lisa for bringing these iconic artists and celebrity looks to us. I have learned so much from your videos!
I love intelligent makeup talk. ^_^
I can't stop watching this Video!!!
Did anyone else just beam at the beauty of Lisa as soon as her gorgeous face popped up at the beginning? I can do my own makeup well but if I were famous I'd let her do my makeup in a heartbeat.
Love ❤️ this makeup artist 's rings and the sound of her bracelets jingling.  ✨
Lisa make up tutorial for your look at the beginning of the vid please ❤️💘💗💋
you guys don't have seat covers ????
Her voice is Sooooooo soothing! Such a lovely lady :) love her jewellery btw🤘
Fabulous! Kate the model was working it giving us the Amy Winehouse vibe!💋
This was amazing. Please make her recreate the Anne Hathaway look😍
another great substitute for brow gel is hairspray. just save an old mascara wand, wash it and spray it with hairspray and go through the brows :-)
Oh, Lisa! Thank you so much for that!! Just one let stated how thankful I'm for your time. What a beautiful homage! So nice of O'Reilly for of accepting your invitation. Thank you, thank you!
Love your lip colour here Lisa and the lip colour used for the model :)
i love russian red ❤️ (its a lipcolor everybody looks great with 😁)
Love it!!  So great to see such a cool Amy/retro look accomplished WITHOUT huge swathes of contour/bronzer & near white blocks of undereye concealer.
Hi Lisa!  This was an absolutely fabulous video. Thanks!
This was such a respectful video, and beautifully done. Starting off by stating I didn't design this makeup look, Amy did was just so honest and a real tribute to Amy's passion for retro looks and music. Wonderfully done!
FINALLY A NEW VIDEO!
This was so good!!!
I enjoyed this video so much, thank you Lisa. Please do more of these if you can
Thank you Valli O'Reilly!  Wow this is one awesome video, such iconic makeup artists!  Love you Lisa and thank you for creating the best channel.  Hugs from the USA!
Brow tip: take a creamy, unscented lip balm (like Aquaphor - which rarely helps chapped lips anyways), squeeze a bit on the back of your hand, then dip a clean spoolie in it and brush your brows with it! They will stay in place without looking like they're all stiff and rigid.\n\nPS. Lisa, the fact that you bring other make up artists on your channel says a lot about you. Mainly that you care about spreading knowledge and that you are confident enough in your skills to not make the channel all about you. Much love x
What an incredibly light hand!
Lisa, thank you so much for inviting Valli here, and for your lovely model. Your own makeup is beautiful here too - so fresh and glowy.
Love it. Thank you Lisa. Your channel is in a class of its own.
Lisa, Please do a Nicole Kidman look you did on her at Cannes this year ! Thank you !! xx
İ just love listening to you. Your voice is so relaxing. İ can listen all day :)
Amy's look was one of my all time favourites, I had no idea she designed it herself!
Thanks Lisa for always showing us something different and sharing not just your knowledge but also your fellow make up artists friends! It was great to see in action such a big name in the american cinematographic make up industry.
Lisa you are a beautiful human being. I love how you invite guest artists for them to share their talents and tricks as well on your youtube channel.
I miss Amy so much, it's the first time I cry over a makeup tutorial OMG
So stunning and I learned so much. 💗✨💗✨💗✨
I'm jealous of the models eyelashes!!! She's gorgeous
Wow what a treat thank you Lisa !!!!!!
It's a tip i learned from the drag queens in the 80's... I could listen to her life experience all day long! <3 Two classy, talented and stunning ladys! We are so blessed to be able to listen to these ladys. Thank you youtube. And thank you Lisa! Love from Germany!
I hope the model dos wear it home on the underground. She looked amazing. \nAnd I loved the fact Amy was advocating British makeup brand rimmel. She could have used more expensive brands bit she stuck to her roots. \nMakes me love you even more Amy . RIP xx
Beautiful work, beautiful model, favourite channel ever. Thanks Lisa, Valli, and Kate!
Its funny how actually working and famous makeup artists like to use very simple inexpensive products a lot while all these youtube muas use all this expensive stuff and balk at using glue stick as eyebrow gel. I absolutely love her tips and her nice wearable look! I love how you're able to bring on the MUA's who actually did this looks on the celebrity. \n\nCould you do an authethic 1920's silent movie makeup Lisa? I know it won't be too pretty when its accurate and not tailored to 21st century tatses but would be great education.
You mention Anna May Wong in your book as a makeup muse, it would be lovely to see a makeup look based on her.
I miss Amy Winehouse so much that I can't even listen to her music without crying 😢
AMY! ❤️❤️❤️ I absolutely love this!
The video was ok but the instructions for the eyeliner were missing and that is the most iconic part
This is iconic. I'm thinking of stealing this look. Wonder if it will work with my pixie hair cut
She was delightful! Thx Lisa & Valli❤️
Realy enjoy every video u make 😍 super inspiring 🙌🏼
Wow!
wow!
Obsessed with these videos!! 🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹
Wow this is amazing!!!!
I miss Amy :(
I love her.
Beautiful
Thoroughly enjoyable, thank you Lisa!
😍😍😍😍
Love the matte lip tip
Beautiful. Minimalist. Clean.
amazing
Oh, Amy... 💔
Amazing!
please do a lana del rey inspired look!!!
Does anything happen to your eyelids and under eye areas after years of putting foundation on them instead of concealer?
Lisa could you please do awesome looks for silver/grey haired ladies...how to do natural looks and more glam looks. We have the tendency to look dull or washed out if makeup is not properly done, especially for fair skin. Pleeeease
Lisa I miss your tutorials done on yourself.  Please do a nice fall look xx😻😻
I have a Rimmel lip liner in Red Diva....is this the same as the one she mentioned called Diva?
I absolutely love her rings!! What amazing jewelry... Any idea on possible brand? lovely tutorial as usual!

I love you girl. I love your attitude and how you don't act like all the other beauty gurus you're an amazing woman!!
Patrician I see you have never heard of matcha tea. You should try the real tea. It's better for you than regular green tea. It's like drinking more than one cup but get the ceremonial kind. Hope you enjoy it. I love it.
Swirly beauty blender.  Swirling round and round.
Was the mirror from Tarte like a z-pallet?

とうとう今週末アルバムリリースですね！サマソニ挟んで追いかけ続けてきたから思い入れがハンパない！そんな大きな期待を軽く上回る作品だと信じてます！
Bueeeen temaa!
fuck you guys, you are disgusting people
Amei!!!
I think someone listened to fallout boy
Love me some foos
very great 🎵🎶🎧
I love FF, but the mix seems off on this song. Percussion and the rhythm lines seem to drown out Dave's lyrics.
Missing the pep from originals
Concrete and Gold is a monster.  And it's not's even hit I-tunes or the streets.  Does that tell ya something?  This thing is going to kill the charts.
Que delicia
fuc*** great!!!!!!
this album will be so amazing
301 justin bieber fans ..
I can´t wait anymoreeee Five daysss
fooooooooossssssssssss
Only 6 days left 😂😂😂
GO THE FOO FIGHTERS!!!!
Le grand public devrait les reconnaître.  Superbe.
three out of three so far
From the 3 songs I've heard so far I like Run the best
Run , the line 🤘🏻
Boring and sounds like crap (for example the Drums / Snare) !
Esto si que está bueno de sonar el rock actual #QueVengaFooFightersaPerú
hum... i don't know, i think that One By One and Wasting Light have the face of FF... this songs from Concrete and Gold reminds me Young Modern of Silverchair, doesn't sounds as FF
A 310 personas no les gusta bombo fica en la musica, disrespect para ellos
What a good song. They never cease to amaze me. Thank you foo fighters for staying true to yourselves. I believe it is what makes you guys so successful.
Their album is gonna be huge I can feel it ! This new producer is really good and Foo's didn't dropped their big raw sound ! I can't wait next friday
awesome song... can't wait to get new album
I love how this album's shaping up. Just 5 days more!!
thanks for being the first song i've heard with 22 years old!!
great song! any drummers out there, cover on my channel!
Comments on Facebook 1,666. Now I am fucking this up as 1667 but shit this is straight from the devil and I can't even listen to this shit
they are coming to australia with weezer (another *awesome* rock band) for a concert 2018, but tickets cost $150
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS RECORD. AHHH
Just hoping for some harder stuff than this in the album...
HMMMM mixed feelings for this one, kinda meh to me. In Your Honor vibes, definitely. It's a very good song but imo it doesn't add too much to the already existing FF material. I found The Sky Is a Neighborhood and Run pretty innovative, I really hope I'm getting more surprises when the album is finally released :(
Probably the only single I like off the new cd. Hopefully the other songs are good.
Better than Run and Sky combined?
*I was wrong, i was right*
This band can do no wrong. Maybe the most consistently great rock band of all time. LOVE
Love, and good vibes forever; waves of them.
Yesss foo fighters made it to trending! Albeit number 50 but they made it nonetheless.
Damn I love this band.
I'm just here to say fuck that commercial they make us watch with the dog and the Lions mane for Amazon. That song is shitty
The only Foo Fighters album I didn't like was Skin and Bones.The rest were brilliant 👍👍👍
Sounds terrible, compressed to all hell, those cymbals are killing my ears. On top of that it's just very mediocre cookie cut rock music.\nDon't get me wrong I love the fooies I grew up on then to an extent but I just can't keep listening to the same old stuff. The album art is awful too. Nothing new here.
If you come to Spain I will be watching you at first row singing every single song of your new album, because it's going to be AMAZING
Anyone else think vocals should be a bit louder?
It's a no brainer I'm really going to get into this track more!!! Later on but can't wait for concrete and gold
283 people can't find the line.
When you forgot you used to play tourettes in your other band...
The best part was from 00:00 - 3:39
i think 500k of the views are from me
This solo is AMAZING
I sense this going to be a great album after there is nothing left to lose
holy shit this song is just amazing
Listenning to this..... this album is gonna be perfect
Now I understand why FF has three guitarists
How do these keep getting better 😂😂😂
This song has got power
(Lyrics) \n\nYes or no?\nWhat is truth\nBut a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue?\nI was wrong\nI was right\nI'm a blood moon born in the dead of night\n\nBreak my bones\nI don't care\nAll I ever wanted was a body to share\nHeart's gone cold\nBrush ran dry\nSatellite searching for a sign of life\nLike you\n\nSomewhere?\nAre you there?\n\nThe tears in your eyes\nSomeday will dry\nWe fight for our lives\n'Cause everything's on the line\nThis time\n\nListen close\nI can't hide\nI'm a page torn from a broken spine\nSun gets low\nI get high\nSatellite searching for a sign of life\nLike you\n\nSomewhere?\nAre you there?\n\nThe tears in your eyes\nSomeday will dry\nWe fight for our lives\n'Cause everything's on the line\nThis time\n\nAre you there?\nAre you there?\n\nThe tears in your eyes\nSomeday will dry\nWe fight for our lives\n'Cause everything's on the line\nThis time\n\nThe tears in your eyes\nSomeday will dry\nWe fight for our lives\n'Cause everything's on the line\n\nYes or no?\nWhat is truth\nBut a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue\nI was wrong\nI was right\nI'm a blood moon born in the dead of night
This is gonna be an amazing album... Can't fight The Foo 👍
Ez is nagyon jó lett srácok!
¿Alguien habla español?
replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...
Just heard the full album and my verdict is a solid 7/10. \nThe vibe is pretty much what you would expect from the Foos. \nMake It Right and  La Dee Da are usual Foo bangers, \nDirty Water has an easy going/beach vibe I kinda dig. \nSunday Rain has a wicked bass on it. \nThe Line is no doubt the track of the album.
Nothing this year that gets released will beat this album.
GO THE FOO FIGHTERS!!!!!!!!
Even a deaf person could mix and master better than this shit. Fucking loudness war is ruining the music. Fucking crap.
These songs deserve more views 🤘🏼
This is the first Foo Fighters' song to actually sound like a Foo Fighters' song since, like, 2005 or something. Thank God. Dave is still capable of writing good tunes every once in a while...
this song is perfect for FIFA
He actually has bars
Welp.... its better than jacob satorious' songs so imma give it a thumbs up
Fire 🔥🔥🔥
This song man🔥🔥🔥🔥
Xxl 2018
Got his own shoe cause its only fitting

if lonzo had add liangelo he would ask if he could add lidickey (who isnt a ball brother) instead
This song is lit
Yo why the chorus sounds like Michael Trapson?🤔
This shot 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What abt lw\nLiangelo
fuck BBB
He can't talk about liangelo because he is in college .
He stole paul wall flow
Am I the only one who thinks this song is really fucking ass
Yo this lit
Nas memorized his own verses before he recorded em...
lmao this is fucking terrible. Damian Lillard is the only baller who should be rapping.
i think i just puked in my mouth.
Not bad at all... Can we get 3 mins+ on the next track!?
triple b's in this thang....
Not bad wouldn't listen to it on repeat though.
Lonzo lonzo lonzo just jumped over jumpman
In the start it sounds like despacito like if u agree
This family are born to be superstars
What's this channels email
I said this negga is not getting a shoe endorsements that's he sucks
Still can't believe Kenneth is a singer bro, when we were kids he played ball and Drums. Dat boi boutta blow up
If you're gonna say Nas is irrelevant and then you try and drop a song right after , that shit better be fire. This shit is gay as fuck
Should've got the 4th brother on the track! Lil Dicky probably would've went in
Stay in your lane
People doubt liangelo he is gon be better then people think honestly
Honestly didn't think he had bars.... zo goes hard lol I only seen a couple freestyles but he can do both. Fuck hating on this dude. At least he's about his fam
Mix race folk are superhuman I swear.. good at everything & super handsome lol needa get summa their genes so I can pawn them on eBay
Imagine lakers make a trade for a late first or early second and they draft gelo, then they sign melo as a FA. I see it. Magic is into that kinda stuff, too, keeping things entertaining like Dr. Buss.
At the end gelo gonna be better than both of them, y'all gonna see
Wow Lonzo is gonna be a superstar this family too lit
Name of the instrumental?
How you hating, but then you banging this!
LiAngelo got no shoe Lamelo got a shoe Liangelo got a Ferrari ehh it's ok but Lamelo got a LAMBO!! cmon I feel bad for Gelo he gets no respect or attention at all smh
Tf kind of shit is this😂😂
Heavy
They just played somebody to make this
This not half bad 😂
Zo got Bars! BIGG BALLER!
lonzo spittin...not bad...better than shaq...
Damian Lillard should hop on the remix. 💯

Dave East would've murdered this beat💯Him and Chris Brown wit Chris on the hook

I have never clicked so fast on a new notification
Kane didn't like the joke And wanted you to know. Lol
Remember that ice cream makeup. Video you made in 2014 do a scary Halloween ice cream cone!!?
Leeexx,,, this has got to be one of your most badass AHS looks, jfc, I'm screaming. You made work on that headpiece look so effortless, and it came out looking incredible!! GG, girl. I'm spook'd 🐝
Awesome!! You are an amazing Artist! I would love to see you do a skincare video.
I was questioning if that was you! XD
So many great puns. I should....\n\n\n\n\nBEEkeeping notes....
I might Bee this for halloween
Hey Lex, I would LOVE to see what happens AFTER you create these creep-tastic looks. Like do you walk around the house doing your usual...daily...things? So much effort, I would be hitting up the shops and everything 😍😂😂
You should do a bloodyface tutorial from AHS Asylum. That is my favorite season.
Can you make a Lily Munster make up tutorial please?
What if you have short hair or a shaved head how  would  you  cep your hair back
Me when I'm gay: I LOOK SCAAAaAAaaaARRRYYYYYYYYYY!!! Omfg I laughed so loudly when do did that
Have you done twisty the clown would love it if you did be amazing for Halloween
This has got to be one of the coolest looks you've ever done!
How does your dog feel about this makeup? Is he like, freaked out?  xD
This one actually makes you look rather unrecognizable. Maybe that's the disturbing part :P
That's look sick. You should try doing your take one the movie IT. I'd love to see that. 😁
This is the one look you've done that really doesn't look like you anymore. You were talking and it was so bizarre.
Has anyone seen that weird video of a guy who put mash potatoes on his entire face and hair? Well that's what she looks like around 6:00😂
When you were placing your head piece you actually looked like Gwyneth Paltrow i don't know why ❤❤ i love you #Lex
What's your normal white paint you used to paint your body and face? I can't find a good white paint that doesn't go streaky and would love to try the one you use but don't know what it is! :( x
OH MAN THE BEEHIVE IS BACK IN FASHION
For the longest time I couldn't understand what you were saying about the products listed somewhere around the video. Like, for years! And you just now realized you mumble the whole statement.
I've never watched American Horror Story and after this I can say I'm deffiently NOT watching American Horror Story. Ever! xD
Can you do the asylum nun?
Lex, give your pupper a hugging from me???
My very first time watching your channel \nI like you\n I like the way you talk\nUr koo
I wish my untalented ass could do this kind of stuff.
This is the first time I've understood what you said in the beginning only because you slowed down and re said it 😂
Speechless!!!!You rock and your work is AMAZING!!!
Waiting for the I have trypophobia comments.
I'm 12 and I want to be a special effects makeup artists just like you. You're my inspiration and I hope to be as good as you
I don't know why but this look kinda reminds me of the little babies ice cream commercial......if you don't know what it is please look it up😂
If you did an Asylum look that would bee amazing 🐝 Preferably the people who were made to live for ever like the ones with blisters and all that on them
u are amazing

THIS IS AWESOME!
Don't *bee* scared ;)
I think this might be one of my new favorite songs. And that is not a light achievement. But still the video was unique and the song was incredible
Kygo played a remix of this song last year in Bergen at his concert, and i've been waiting so long for this song to come out! And i LOVE it!!
Legend!!\npeace and love from Indonesia.. <3
I think it sounds great.
Awesome! and this is not a girly pop song like some people says... if you look the lyrics it's more about the father-daughter relationship. Or maybe it's  a love song for all those mistakes we make everyday

Omg new U2 song!! Yass!! 😂
Beautiful
Irish power!!!  👈🏽👊🏽💪🏾 Dublin proud 🇮🇪 👌🏾👍🏾 😍🔥😍
U2 have always produced decent tuneage just a shame the bands full of egotistical tossers
I wonder, how much is the book though? And where can I buy it???? Anyone?????? 😀
IT SOUNDS LIKE KEANE! FUCK!  I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking METS ZOO STATION METS ALWAYS , THAT SONG IS REALLY A BIG DISASTER . VERY GENERIC SONG. NOT THE OUTSTANDING. INVISIBLE IS EVEN MUCH MORE A BETTER SONG,
I like so much
Wow, what a song!!
Karly please can you share lyrics or someone could do that?  for thoses not distinguising very good all english words,  in a song.... i love all yours songs and video...fan from the first time you know hope you remember.....much love dear friend...wish i could  see you  soon..

This song made my Fall already! And yes, appreciate those who love you.
Just started my channel. 🍾\n\nWatch my new video! 😁and subscribe!    \n\nPlease and thanks 🙏 💖\n\n✌️
Great song.. class never goes out of style..
Spectacular makes you want to dance and enjoy. Guitar, voice.... everything
Bono still going hard
Are you also here because of Coldplay?
Thank you  so much,   a continuation of the last album
... both this one and Dark Necessities hint that rock music may have gone for good
Kygo edit is MUCH better
I think.. that U2 without brian eno cannot make it. so.. brian eno is without a doubt the BRAIN. of u2. and daniel lanois too of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r2PS3W1eYc Like and subscribe my friend in this world. We ''re making good music just because our fans are very important to us and we want to bless them with love and great music
I can't get too into this song.. It might just be me, but it has this constant build up that just doesn't go anywhere.
Sucks ass. Nothing will compare to the U2 the 80s.
been U2 fan over 10 years; Im not feeling this one.
great track, the greatest band ever :)
What a pleasant surprise. Wasn't really waiting anything from them after all this time, but this is really a great song!
At one time, you might think that this was a great, subversive song about drugs...or anything other than his actual wife.  It's just so on the nose.\n\nThey're just trying so desperately hard to be popular, and have been for a while.  I feel numb.
I haven't kept up with U2 since Songs of Innocence. Are people still mad at them for giving out *free shit*?
WHY DID I KNOW THIS CAME OUT UNTIL NOW
Pisses all over Songs of Innocence
From your fuse you subscribe to the channel with my gift
I like it. Reminds me of old U2, which is a good thing. :)
I grew up on U2 songs and this is such a surprise for me :D
The best of all GThe u to
It's good, but they need to make an album like WAR again.
2:22 they be like.. fuck the page turning. we're done. 😂
Nice song but I have to admit that I have heard better (and more interesting) songs from U2. I know that I am strict but I don't like to compromise with nice but simultaneously indifferent songs from my favourite rock band. I have been used to hear the best music from this band. \nI really hope that the rest songs from the album will be amazing.
Like us on FB https://www.facebook.com/u2coholics/
I love reading comments under songs from all different bands and learning what each fan base is like...What I learn here is that U2 fans are ignorant and sheltered

This is my review on the  song https://ireviews25.blogspot.com/2017/09/youre-best-thing-about-me-u2-review.html
Wonderful song! Love U! See you in Brazil, october!
I loved it. U2 always :)
Love it. 45 year old U2 fan practically since birth and am always happy when I hear the Edge playing some of his signature, haunting notes in the background; nowadays real musicians are hard to find and U2 are legends that continue to produce awesome stuff!
Weak song. They're music has been in slow decline since their last great album 2004's\nHow To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb
who knows how much time did it take for all those pictures to make and put all together into a video
If this is a taster of the album then we can only expect something lukewarm and a little safe. When U2 stop giving a shit about being relevant then they'll write great music again. Great music is always relevant. They need to take more risks than this. I agree with a few others here, there is a lot of terrible stuff going on in the world, that's where U2 need to channel their energies. Protest songs, rebellion against Trump, against racism, the refugee crisis. Fucking hell, I dunno.

Sorry to be a party killer, but this is a very average tune and it has a really tired  sound to me - but what annoys me the most is Bono's flat and uninspired lyrics on this track - light years from the level of their peak in the 90's. To be honest, IMHO they have not released anything remotely interesting since POP. The fact that their latest tour is on their 30 year old Joshua Tree album sort of confirms that they have accepted their irrelevance, even though they have always been amazing in concerts. But, in the 1990's, they (and Nirvana) ruled the music scene!
Good rock and roll, uh....music
Loving  The fly reference @1.47! This will blend in perfectly in an Achtung Baby celebration tour in 2021 ;)
I love this video, what a hard work, well done!! congratulations to creators!!
Why the hell when I search U2 on YouTube, U2 Justin Bieber comes as the second search suggestion? That's so annoying!
*U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2 U2*
wow, I love this song, I think I can never stop listening to it
the good band is back
Safe to safe u2 is the greatest band ever
Seriously, why are U2 still making new music?! This is the blandest, by-the-numbers song they have ever released as a single, and a lot of their music falls into that category. I listened to it, and the painful experience was only made worse by having the corny, back-of-a-fag-packet lyrics on the screen! Music as generic as this really winds me up. Dreadful. Empty, soulless music.
This is culture, people
can i get that book somewhere ?? lol

Dan: Phil I wanna-I wanna click the thing\nPhil: What thing?\nDan mumbling: the thing the thing *gestures* \nPhil: OHHHHH\n \nHow long it takes my friends to get my jokes... if you play that 50000000000000 times again... my friends are dumb XD
Please more Overcooked! This was absolutely great!
You're just making me do it, you say something! \n\nDan: *screams* PASS THE ONIONS \n😂❤️👌🏻 quality
The whole time I was thinking where's the lamb sauce!!!!!!!

I'd ding danadphil's bell any day;)
I love spending my only free time listening to you scream about onions
This was really cute, you guys should live stream more often. Love from Canada ❤️
I think dan and phil are secretly furrows considering how much they talk about furries also I love you guys if you see this comment
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FOREST FIC STOP
Am I the only one who *actually* got an ad?!
This is just another game amongst the many stressful games you have played on this channel pls spare us
Dan and Phil cooking has always been my aesthetic and so has Dan and Phil games so putting them both together... I'm pleased
Gordon Ramsey eat your heart out 💁🏻
I might be kind of terrified remembering that spooky week is going to happen but that's fine I'll watch and die anyway
This is a Christian channel. No yiffing. At this exact moment, my dog decided to make a noise, YIFF!
Phil: *chops onions but doesn't put them into the pan*\nDan: *has a seizure* Put it in the pan WHAT ARE YOU DOING PUT IT IN THE FREAKING PAN PHIL\nrip headphone users

Phil to answer your question - soup is mostly made up of broth which is meat flavored tea therefore it is a drink

Oh Trevor, poor thing! 😓😁 I really like him, he is so funny! But it's true, honestly here in Barcelona he's not known at all... 😂 If I had been there, I would have asked for a pic with both of them! 😊😊😊 On the bright side, he can be just a tourist around here. 😅
OMG! Trevor and Shakira in the same car? I can't even...WTF do they have to sale this to Apple?!
it was so much fun and beautiful shakira

Couple of weeks ago I got to know that shakira is going to perform a dance in India with Indian actor, now I'm just waiting for her arrival. The name of that actor is hrithik, he is my favorite but because of his back problem shahid get a chance to dance with shakira, maybe she didn't know anything about this. Please shakira come to India as soon as possible. Lots of love from India, luv u sooooo much. 😘😘😘😘. I'm your biggest Indian fan( this is the editted part of my comment lol)

Shakira is the best 😍😍\nThis is the 5th time I watch this video 😘😘😘😘
Trevor Noah is annoying
Necesito un Carpool Karaoke de Shakira con James Corden. :'v
Trevor Noah... eww 👎👎👎
Shakira is awesome, trevor noah sucks balls
How old is this girl she looks in her late thirties honestly
She doesn't have any lips
Yall so mean but I can't help but laugh. 😂
huma is waaay prettier than this ted cruz beached whale. what's wrong with men? jesus
Thank you Anthony Weiner... thank you young millennial. You liberals finally did something wonderful for your country. Takes my hat off and vows down dinner is on me. Now let's make America great again.
Shes ugly as hell she needs a nose job, lip injections and a weight watchers program
Good for her! Catching a pervert before he goes into office! <3 <3 <3
She basically set him up tho.
SHE LOOKS LIKE A FAT JOHN CUSACK IN A WIG! No offense John!
Ewwwww I'm not trying to be shallow but, ew. She nasty!!!! I wouldn't touch that slob with a 100ft pole. Her or Weiner. They both fugly.
Anthony Wiener. That last name tho
When the wiener scandal first broke out, I was absolutely terrified. I couldn't sleep the whole night. How will we ever be able to explain this to our children?? The Wiener scandal was one of the most traumatizing events in recent history for Americans.
My mother looks more like a teenager then she does...!
His last name tho....
I thought that was Debbie Gallagher
She probably like it and wanted it😂like look at her😂
So her reason was I knew Hilary Clinton would be running for president in 2016. So she was setting him up for that crime starting in 2015? But she does look like an ugly desperate girl who likes dick pics. I'd like to read their entire exchange since she wanted to reignite a controversy and ruin Hilary's chances.
She ain't even worth it anothny tf atleast text someone's who's hot.
Gross. Couldn't he pick a better looking one
She a minor?? She looks 30
Stupid thot because of her ugly ass Hilary wasn't president
She's a Russian spy
I don't know if it's just me but she doesn't look like a teen!
This dumbass risked his whole entire career for her😂 I would understand if she was hot but, 🤔
Teen? Teenager ?? I thought she was 30-40 oops
Hillary Clinton threw her campaign into a tail spin
She's one of the most hated women in America
She looks 35 she can't be a minor
So in January 2016 she knew that if she could get Anthony W. to send a photo she could use that against Hillary Clinton in November??
She looks like she's 40 and ugly why would he even do that
I guess the global warming got to him
He is such a Weiner!
You all know that this is really Natasha Fatale former spy from Pottsylvania now working for the Russian government.
His name says it all
Them legs would make any weiner feel different
She was disgusted.... shut yo hoe ass up... just thinkin about that check 💰 💰
Good job coming forward though set him up but oh well he should be set up dirty mother f***** knew you were underage
she looks like she was a woman then turned into a  man then was like never mind then turned back into a female
I am so immature...why did I laugh when she said Weiner God...why?!
What did she think? His last name was Wiener
She doesn't look like a teen!!!
She kind of looks like Kevin from the office
You mean to tell me she's not a 39 year old mother
He has it written in his name
His wife is so much prettier lol
She looks like a female version of TED CRUZ 😫😂
Well the name WAS Anthony Weiner
This is what Ted Cruz would look like if chose to transition to woman.
She's got more Chins than a Chinese phone book
I can't be the only one who laughed at thosd dramatic poses ☠☠☠\nThrough the application twitter 😂😂😂
wow this is why i don't trust a girl or a woman they set you up in ruin your life
Dang!!! She is UGLY!!!
She's also old enough to know what's right and what's wrong.
I see you ted Cruz!!!!
Lol she looks like a 40 year old it's disgusting he did that but he didn't know she was a minor too
So anthony weiner was sending dick pics to ugly fat chicks?? He's much sicker than I thought.
HIS LAST NAME IS WEINER.  THAT CANT BE A COINCIDENCE!! HIS.... NAME.... IS.... WEINER. I CANT BREATHE 😂😂
she entrapped him hoping to get a big pay day basically
man, she isn't even hot. now Japanese chicks in school uniforms is HOT!!!!!
this girl better be careful that she doesnt end up as another name in the long list of Clinton's Bodybags. if she hasnt already.
she looks like Ted Cruz, if he became a woman
🤢🤢🤢 Please this chick new exactly what she was doing....let not act like she was innocent...she set him up yes he was wrong but so was she
LMAO WEINER
ow, now its weiner's fault, LMFAO\nwhats next, harambe did it ?
She looks 30
Anthony weiner lol
Haha weiner!🍆🍆🍆🍆
shes a whore
she is fat gross
*On the application twitter* 🅱oi tf

You say change history How can it when Trump was going to win by popular vote (subtract illegal votes) anyway.

Hey amber! What camera do you use
Honestly, I started watching your videos from the past week and I absolutely love you. You seem so nice and so positive. I really love all of your videos, they're all entertaining and creative. Ly 💖
Amber, I'm so excited for what is to come for you! You're almost at 1 million followers and tons of more opportunities headed your way. 🌸 I keep coming back to watch your videos because you are so positive, fun, and funny. I wish you all the best, you deserve all these blessings.
Isn't it bad to ship from Ali express though? Idk i feel like people shouldn't buy from there, especially if they live in Europe or America or something and it's shipping all the way from china, also she mentioned that it only cost 40$ for that suit thing but I'm sure the people making it were only paid a few cents..
Amber I was watching the real girls eat cake video and I noticed you in the it!!!!😱😱😱
Can you do a review of ikrush.com \nThey have super cute heels !!!
You look so cute on the thumbnail 😍😍😍I can't 😍😍
Hey Amber I'm a new subscriber and in love with your videos. Please guide me I've got huge boobs like you & you do wear alot of tube tops. No strapless bras give me good support so please tell me which brand you wear.
Can you do a modest lookbook
Is AliExpress connected to AliBaba? Because Alibaba is one of the largest sites so idk how it's sketchy.

MILI ON THEY WAY AMBER!!!!!
You're awesome love your videos!
Amber what lashes are you wearing ?!!!??
Aah ur soo pretttttttty and ur clothes are AMAZING!!!!
I'd still bang him with that smile.
I think he would make a great Joker! Anyone else agree??
I don't get it. Does this actor play IT in the new version??
Looks more stupid than scary. Run up on me like that you going night night
Am I the only one who finds the movie it to be incredibly stupid
who's excited to watch IT 2017 ?
That's cool though
How's your brother doing now? \nI'll let you know, the next time we visit him at: The Home.
When everyone was scared of IT but you knew Bill played Pennywise so you were kind of turned on
That's it ,I'm in love 😍
Please make him the new joker
Im terrified of clowns but hes so hot lol now im starting to think....... nah im still scared of clowns
he  would be a great me pink for a reservoir dogs sequel
Subscribe to my YouTube channel
Lol that's a classic older brother thing to do
YO WHY IS IT HOT THO.
Goodness, you'd never guess that this amazing bloke played the most horrible clown of all time
https://youtu.be/a6yPzUI9oV4 hi we are a new channel plz give us support and drop a sub or check our new vid
That jaw could cut paper
He could totally play a young Palpatine (Sidious) from Star Wars
He's no curry
He's also in Hemlock Grove if you want to see some even better acting. It's on Netflix
Okay but why is he super cute
This is cool and beautiful))) Thank you for visiting us))) Good luck to you
He looks like the guy from the movie It
I can't help, but wonder how good he would be as the joker :)
This guy has Riddler all over❓🦇
can't wait to see the movie 🎥
I have a new crush on him
He needs to be cast as the joker!!
I first saw bill on Hemlock Grove.  He is a cutie IMO.  Pennywise is an iconic role and the fact that he did an excellent job with it despite all the naysayers...his career can only go up from here.
I will still have sex with him😂😢😢
i would pull my shirt up over my head so just my face pokes out , make a creepy face and chase my sibling around \n\nME
Why Does His Smile Looks Like Kristen Stewart
Im not going to watch the new IT due to the fact he's got rape face! Especially with the lip!!!
I love bill. But his eyes.. his eyes.. look dead to me all the time lol
he is so hot ❤
He should be the next joker
Tbh I feel like my smile is scarier
Okay, so how come when he does that face, he looks like a god, but when I do it I look like a goddamn troll????
That's a Joker's smile.
More like a pedophile smile.
He smiles with his bottom lip😭😭
He looks so hot
I sense a joker
did anyone else try to do the lip thing 😂
Let's all jump on the band wagon!!!
Damn Skarsgård family, hope at least two of three brothers end up doing a movie sometime.\nIm not in to the horror stuff but im going to see IT next week.
0:53 God that's scary.
I want him to eat me out.\nThose lips...😍
Why is he so hot?! Jfc, I'm asexual and want to jump him.
the smile is so addicting to me somehow
Was he Roman on hemlock Grove ?
So what does that suppose to mean  He is not even from here...Do you have to be from here to be a good actor and to get credit for it ? Do I need to remind you that some of the  greatest actors and actresses of all time were or aren't from here . Considering the racism and chauvinism going on lately in this country your comment is not particularly welcome.
I don't get it
Someone get Willem Dafoe to show him what a smile is.
He looks cute and scary at the same time. Like an overgrown scary baby. He is def. not ugly, but super creepy looking. Like I wouldn't wanna sleep with him, but I would adopt him.
Please check out my new upload and maybe even subscribe
He looks scary already without makeup, must be the darkness around hid eyes.  Pennywise look cool before now they made into a serial killer Shakespeare looking clown
Why is nobody watching my videos?
Wait...so he was the great Cornholio!?
HUH didn't even need the makeup.
He's probably droned. Donald Marshall look it up.
It's like the Miz and Steve Buchemmi had a baby.
He's so cute but that smile is so creepy 😂
He's creepy but, strangely attractive!
I wonder what Bill would look like playing the joker
It seems like he has the smile of Steve Buscemi..  Just saying..
I love him from hemlock grove great movie wasn't really scary but it was funny as hell great movie loved his performance
#BillSkarsgårdforJoker
man i LOCE sweden
he sucks balls
https://youtu.be/o0fu_W6JZKM\n\n\nhurrricanes are terribly intresting.

Anyone else try the smile?
He will do good for joker original \n\n WB  Like if you agree
Bill Skarsgård looks like a younger version of Steve Buscemi
He reminds me of Chris O'Neill (OneyNG/OneyPlays) for some reason.
Subscribe to me and I'll buy a Lambo no joke

Look at your hair Shawnie ... Like uncle Jesse on full house with awesome hair as well he often said Rebecca have mercy
This is my favorite interview omg
Why is nobody watching my videos? This is totally insane! I've put so much effort into them and none have gone viral!
When he said 'oh no.' I died that very moment. HOW CAN ANYONE BE THAT FUCKING ADORABLE
Brazil is waiting for you 💚

He was talking about Johnny Orlando when he said this kid made a remake of Shawns Video
3:18 when they connected HAHAHA loved it
No one could do it better than u Shawn 😍
A average looking white guy who makes generic music. It's no wonder he's famous.
johnny orlando😭😭😭😭 IM A PROUD MOTHER😂😂😂
Lol shawn looks like a idk he seems cool
Don't worry Shawn in about 3 years you will probably be as big as drake or bigger so security guards wont try to arrest you
I love how he tells his stories, he is so down to earth and funny loved it 😂
He is so cute
I wonder if I could ever show Shawn Mendez my magic tricks...
AH MY BOY I WAS SO SMILING SO BIG HE MAKES ME SO HAPPY BY JUST HEARING HIS VOICE 😍😘❤️😭
Our baby is all grown 😭😭\n\n\n\n\nBut he said he's better looking than me too but I was like mm honey that isn't possible
Jimmy Fallon is so fake he overreact so much when someone tells a story
I would angrily eat his butthole like there was no tomorrow
Where is Shawn's balls!? He sounds like they were cut off
Best story ever! I couldn't stop smiling at how cute he was 😂💕
THE\n\nMOST\n\nLIFE\n\nCHANGING\n\nTHING\n\nEVER.\n\n\n\n\nOMG!!!

*when you know that shawn won't ever know that you exist but fantasize meeting him and becoming friends*\nI NEEEDD AAA LIIIFEEEE
Why is my gaydar going off when he talks? Hmmm.....
I remember supporting him when he barely had any followers and now EVERYBODY knows his name. SO PROUD 😭
Am i the only one who noticed a tattoo on his finger ??
Who's been here since his vine days ?
Can't believe two things. 1. He's NINETEEN already. 2. HOW IS THIS NOT TRENDING?!
FINALLY HE GOT INTERVIEWED 😍🤘💯😂😫
Ahh Canadians
Who's here before a million views ?
'IM PRETTY SURE THUS ISNT HOW THE STORY ENDS'\n\n*foreshawdowing*
This song is keeping me going honestly
this band should fall out of a boat
Okay pretty good, the video was far out the music is B+ could have used some work
About f#! &!)! Time got the same vibes as when falloutboy first showed up good shit
This is actually good💚
You can't just give me nightmares and then end it all with some dank memes??!?!?!?
Absolutely LOVE this song. Hey guys click on our channel and S.U.B 💕💕
Um, is this the official music video for this song??
2:01 The lighting makes it look like the llama's eyes are glowing \n\n*S* *P* *O* *O* *P* *Y*
Dude given all the songs so far mania is set to be the best album of life ever!
his name is jeff
THIS WOULD FIT SO WELL IN A WWE GAME
Ok, but his hands are tied in front of him. PETE COULD EASILY PEEL THE TAPE OFF HIS MOUTH.
This just reminds me of the monsters from labryinth
Wait omg I never realized what the credits actually said \n\nI'm so done
I've hated fall out boys last two albums, but I actually have high hopes for Mania
It's like My songs know what you did in the dark but with llamas lol
I have been listening to this on repeat for the last 24 hours and I can't stop. Its a great sing btw
I'm pretty sure this isn't how the story ends I SENSE ANOTHER VIDEO
Who watched it before it was on the charts?
This is amazing. I have heard God.
A SPAGHETTI CAT PRODUCTION FFS \nANYONE ELSE SEE THAT?
Where's Brendon Urie? In the Llama suit!
Yes boys! 3rd on trending!\nLove this song, it is just amazing.
Omg forget school I need to listen to this all day
Revision for tomorrow's test or FOB hmmmmm....FOB
Oh my gods tHE CREDITS
I wish I knew what was the deal with the llamas
Why is it that listening to this song over and over just make me LOVE it MORE?!?!?
Theory - In the credits there are some sentences that don't really go along with the silly theme of the rest of the credits like: \nTake The Pain and Make It Build Up, \nWhen Your Stitch Comes Loose,  and, \nI Took Too Many Hits Off This Memory.  \n\nCould these be possible future lyrics or song titles?
I love this song but can't they make some music where you're actually hearing their instruments those random guitar riffs and bass and drums? Like I know they have it in them to make more it sounds too computer right now
UGHHHH I WAS AT SCHOOL CAMP WHEN THIS WAS RELEASED 😑😑😑
100$ says 98% of these views are white fucks
Just close your eyes and listen to it like it's so good
Reminds me of sassy from the big lez show lol
This is the first song I've listened to by Fall Out Boy after it was recommended to me by a classmate last week. Kind of disappointed as this sounds like Maroon 5. My favorite band is Paramore and also like Linkin Park, Pearl Jam, and even E Street. What are the best Fall Out Boy songs for me?
Best fall out boy song! Perfect
THIS REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING AND NOW I JUST FIGURED IT OUT\nso give me all your poison, give me all your pills..... AHHHH
Is the title a fantano reference?
that shovel without blood ? what a logic
omg better then champion and I thought that was their best song but nvm
I want somebody to look at me the way the one llama was looking at the other as it hit (assuming Pete wentz) with a shovel. Thats true love right there. 😂
A spaghetti cat production\n\nI'm pretty sure this isn't how the story ends 🔮
*Sees WARNNG screen*\nHmm, like that Kanye West video.\n*Watches video*\nWait a minute...
Lighting things on fire *check*\nMember of FOB in a trunk *check*\nMember of FOB about to be murdered *check*\n\nI guess this is an extended version of save rock and roll
I'm new here, but I'm fucking triggered because this video literally is the same this as Flashing Lights by Kanye West. I'm assuming it's just a mock/joke because there's llamas 😂😂 but go watch kanyes video and it's literally the same thing.... and why is no one here talking about the similarity?? If someone know can you please tell me why it's so similar
THIS ALBUM IS GONNA BE FUCKING INCREDIBLE
What happened to Fall Out Boy? Where are the punchy guitar riffs? In fact, where are the guitars? I can barely hear them if they exist, just cranking out power chords. What happened to complex drums? What about lyrics that had depth and meant something. Shame good bands have to simplify and change their ways to continue to be popular.
I'm crying 'Llamas as llamas '
This music video is just like Kanye West's Flashing Lights
I don't care whay anyone says fall out boy is complete trash now
I should be working on a social studies presentation about the holocaust. nah. rather watch this
Anyone notice how they recreated Kanye West's Flashing Lights music video?
Wow! A vevo channel that uploads/ isn't dead!
perfect\ni got a fall out boy ad for this not even kidding this is amazing
Love the song but the video WTH !! FOB you could and have done better.
Those goats are gonna give me nightmares
Hi , i loved it And i hope  they keep making more music  . i'm always listening  to your  music . i love them and adore fall out boy 😘😍😍 i'm from Argentina
#3 ON TRENDING IM PROUD OF MY BOYS
Youngbloods: Such a good song we need to change our fan base name now...Pete Wentz: The Real Ones
Pete Wentz doesn't bleed, pass it on.
People are saying the song has My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark vibes. Obviously the video does, but the song to me kinda has a Back To Earth vibe. Just me?
how many know that this is actually a parody of Kanye West's flashing lights mv?
Good Song
This so gooooooooood
The credits tho 😂😂😂
Flashing lights by kanye west
YAY WERE TRENDING #3 !!!! 💜💜 lets get to #1

Congratulations Alexis and Serena on the wonderful journey of parenthood!! 🌻
Congratulations, you're doing just what the Jews what you to do!

Who are these people??
that kid will grow up hating white people' if the culture dose not change' she will hate her self' people we need to advocate the closing of CIA controlled news and commie collages that are breading division.. this is not dems or republicans faults they are being played like pawns by mass media and the deep state.. Intent on taking freedoms through destruction instigated through the top 10% who want absolute control'..
My niggas... we the last ones left...
We have the same Name ♥️
This is actual love. In happy for you both; god bless your baby 🙏
The part where she was dancing😂😂
Awwweee I hope you go back to Africa!!!
My brothers, we have lost another sister. She is in our prayers 🙏🏽
https://youtu.be/rnJ4blc_S6g                   best I ever saw
She is beautiful! What does the Jr. Stand for? Does it stand for something else in this case? I know females do not usually go by Jr.
People need to put their fucking phones down and enjoy their lives I swear smh
We wish your family a blessed day.
Just wait until your daughter is a master Shit poster.
I can see how it got top trending
ENAMORADA DE TI OLYMPIA!!! I will support till the end baby Girl !!
Woow...There are so much hate comments that there are even more anti-hate comments and now I can't find one negative comment.
My friend has a baby called alexis
God bless her she's a\n Beautiful Angle 💝🙏🏼😇
Idk whats going on in these comments, i just saw it, thought awwwe and clicked (yes i know im basic af)
This is so beautiful!
Congratulations and god bless you all 💖

*Cant wait to see all the edgy racist comments on Reddit*
Welcome to the world,Alexis!!! She is beautiful..
Just another day!\nLooks to husband\nOh... damnit
I am here, 'cause I know the comments will be 'hella' mean.
I love her name Olympia gave it a nice touch
Oh no wonder this as trending. I thought it was some random couple but it's SERENA WILLIAMS.
Thumbnail is basically a stock image at this point
If this was a Black man with a White woman he'd be called a sellout and a coon. I bet most of the likes are from Black women.
THEY DESERVE EVERYTHING SINGLE BLESSING IN THIS UNIVERSE
This is the cutest thing ever
That's a cute baby. Usually newborn babies look a little bit like Gollum.
Who's the douchbag? Marry me Serena. Im 27, my mom says Im cute and I play Mario Kart on 150cc. Dont waste your time with that scrub.
I'm just over here like, wow, she's not gonna enjoy being called Jr.
Why is this trending? Who are these people?
I'm Asian and I find this nigger-like
Who gives a fuck.
Why are black women so unattractive?
Cute baby, I wish you both a good life :D. God Bless.
I don't know anything about this relationship, but she does not seem like his ideal type of personality to jive with. He is one of very few people that can get away with calling his new baby Alexis. I feel like there are going to be so many Amazon jokes for her in Elementary School and then everyone will have moved past it and that name will be more prevalent I guarantee.
My only question is: why is Alex's Snoo complete white while Serena's is her actual skin color? It looks really weird, like she's different than him or something. Make them both white or add some damn color to the other one.
Why and how is this trending
When your wife is more man than woman
I keep seeing people talking about racist, but where they at tho?🤔
White guys winning. Black guys well yeah... America.

Category :science and technology
She's gorgeous.
We need to breed whites out of existence!
Interracial breeding is so cool! 😎
Why are there so many angry black boys in the comment section?
Why is nobody watching my videos? This is totally insane! I've put so much effort into them and none have gone viral!
The best form of White Genocide.\n\nYou will not replace us, you say?\n\nSorry already happening.\n\nLove always Trumps hate
Why is this in trending? I don't give a fuck
I can't find the racism
The comment section has more people complaining about racism than actual racists
No lie... I'm still trying to figure out how this relationship happened
Looks like there is no chemistry between them. What sad sad thing.\nShe tried to get a black guy date and marry, seems that they all rejected her or they didn't give her the respect and love she wanted.\nBlack girls don't go to another race until they get tired of betrayal, rejection and lying and conning from black men. \nI wish them best of luck, but this glorifying interracial shit should stop.Because it's making the dark skin people inferior and the whites most desirable. All the filthy rich dark skin men and women always desperate to be noticed by the whites.This is bad mental enslavement. They look at their own as less human than other races. It's just sad.
Everyone is saying there are racist comments yet I haven't seen a single racist comment. Anyways nice video
Eww race mixing is so disgusting
Beautiful Family!\nWelcome to the World, Alexis!\nWe love you, Serena!\n#BlackGirlMagic
I see all these comments talking about how they hate all these racist comments yet I don't really see any besides the ones talking about how they hate the racist comments
Niggers
Ew, get that pathetic inferior white male away from that beautiful black queen.
Are we just gonna ignore De Bruyne's pass at the end of the game???
Early days but I think an english team could win it this year. Best bunch of teams we've had in the champions league for quite a lot of years now
They were the easiest goals I have ever seen\nWhat a Feyenoord doing
Second game in a row we've smashed a team that sing YNWA
Feyenoord so bad lol
Gabriel Jesus > Rashford
Man City look like a different class at the moment. They ripped Liverpool apart the other day😪 And destroyed Feynoord today⚽️
Media always pay to much attention to opposition teams playing badly vs City and never give City credit.
Feyenoord got hit with two stones
KDB is absolutely insane! He has something special that no other football players have! He has such vision and control and plays intelligently! He is so accurate! 🤘🏻👑
De bryune is amazing his passing is filth
did anyone notice de bruyne's reaction at 0:31?? hahaha
arsenal will win champions league
Best team ever. Come at me haters! 🖕🏿
I hope Man City lose their next game
Manchester city look strong this year .
Ok then well done bt
Easy
When did feyenord sign Odell Beckham jr
Arab FC.
Kun Aguero, their greatest ever European scorer \n\nLast Time I checked Argentina was in South America...
.
Poor Feynoord
*Jesus* ftw
T
Feyenoord did well! Lol
Ayy
KDB better then kroos and modric, kroos and Modric are called the best because they are at real madrid
First one is an own goal. Comes off one leg which is going wide and then the other knocks it back on goal.
City have just smashed arguably the best side in Europe atm 4-0. There's no reason why we can't go on and win it now! #FeyenoordWho?
Come On guys let's get BT to 400k subscribers
Anyone else hear that metal gear solid sound or am i bugging out
I am a man u fan but Mendy was worth the amount city payed 4 him
This is what happens when Brad Jones plays in goals...
lol  😂😂😂
i'm scared to watch spurs against city this year... city look solid
BT Only said that Feyenoord played bad.\nNever said we were good. City bashers all over
0:56\nEuropean? Someone needs a geography lesson...
Let's play a game. Which UCL game was Arsenal fans & players watching?
Title is wrong says 3-0 to feyenoord
Aguero being their greatest scorer in Europe isn't so impressive when the only time they have been to the Champions league is the past 6 years.
I really do not like Dwarf Mamba.
Ummm I doubt the YouTube letter actually said that 😹😹
Could of got a screw driver 🙄
Does anyone know the song he plays at the end of the video when he tells that awful joke?  And the song/sound that plays when he has an idea?
We had to draw birds and most of us in my class drew maverick omfg he is fuking awesome
What is your dog name
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂weak when that box got open😂😂😂😂😂
There was beer in the fridge
they should've gifted you cyanide
The lady with the Pomeranian when they were driving looked so much like Kylie Jenner
What the fuck is this cringeworthy cunt spewing? What a fat load of vapid tripe.\n\n And put that chin away before you hurt somebody, bloody hell....

Logang!! I need y'alls help! What is the running song? I've been searching and can't find it! Thanks mesa amigos!
Serious question how is Evan driving? He is hilarious

*Please don't brake the playbutton*
Help me get to 10 subscribers everyone!
IF you feel bad I'm sorry
Why is nobody watching my videos? This is totally insane! I've put so much effort into them and none have gone viral!
Lol fuck off patting yourself on the back. You and your clan are the cancer of youtube. Big headed, arrogant, and immature. Enjoy your audience mainly full of children.
This is autism rampant, personified autism ever. The rapid jump cut humor is so ridiculous, this is literally a Nickelodeon show.
How Logan Paul changed YouTube forever? BY LOGAN PAUL? \nWhy is he sucking himself?

How Logan Paul changed Youtube forever? Well, I guess a permanent drop in overall quality _does_ count as a change.

They call me Suave....\nMama need to hit that.\nSo many great moments, this was better than all of season 3.
I'd watch that up until the inevitable brutal murder.
The guy sitting at the table at 6:28 looks just like Jason Behr...but it can't be, because Jason's imdb page doesn't mention Narcos...
Watch Cocaine Cowboys 1 and 2 & The Two Escobars.
It's good but personally I like the more random ones more.
This could be a really good movie
He then got shot.
This is actually beautiful
This video to BLR to a whole new level.
This guy looks just like my husband 😂😂😂
😔 screw you guys I though it was real I was looking forward to watching this on netflix
I'll need a balloon.
I need this to be real
IM READY FOR HIM PABLO!!! MAMA NEED TO HIT DAT!
Thanks for showing me the whole movie 😐
i want the entire show to be this now
this guy is a fucking Genius!
I'm dead 😂! This was too perfect
Fr I tried to watch Narcos and I honestly think this is better lmao. I like how this video actually has a flow and story arch. It makes the video much funnier and entertaining.
Okay. this one is excellent. I love the callbacks. longform weird.
Lmaoooo wowww that must have taken a while to make
This Parody has the potential of being better than the actual series. #Bravo!
ok, but does anyone else think that BLR's singing voice sounds like Brandon Flowers from The Killers, or is it just me??
This was really good
whats the song towards the end
Lol so funny on the song
Never seen the show but now I want to watch this narrative.
Why do I feel like Netflix paid them to make this?
I fucking lost it when escobar started singing wtf😂😂😂😂
I’d watch this. Haha.
This made me want to watch the real show but my goodness, *SPOILERS!!!*
LOL, that was gold!
@Bad Lip Reading How have you not won an award for this stuff? It's amazing! Thanks so much for posting!
Why has nobody actually made a show like this with this plot!!! 😂😂😂 is copyrighting this shit in case it does get made 😎😂😂
This movie looks funny, when does it come out in theatres?
HAHAAHA thank you this is amazing
Never really thought that love had a point... But I was wrong. Love has a thousand points
You need to make this into a 30 minute shirt movie. Fantastic
This strangely looks like it could be a movie
Why isn't this a re thing yet, wtf Netflix
Amazing how leaving all the violent, gruesome, bloody, evil scenes aside, it would be such a cute and funny story about finding family love.
THIS IS SOO GOOD 😭
Why isn't this the show?
Does anyone know the music in this trailer?  I assume it's BLR, but would love to hear more.
Id watch this even though ive seen the real shit
I didn't think there would be a show I liked more than Narcos then this gem comes along. lol
I'm so glad I just finished watching this show xD
You know that's a real gun right\n\n*ACCIDENTALLY SHOOTS A FUCKING BULLET*
Come on, add closed captions! Us deaf people matter too!
Do the “it” trailer
At least they were close
I wanna see this cause pablo escabar is my childhood hero beside el chapo and spiderman
This is so good, make a lip sync of all the episodes lol

Hey everyone check out my reaction to this video on my channel!!! :) Thanks and jack you are the shit my dude
I just love these so much... Yaaasssss John never stop!
It's my bday can you guys sub to me and I will sub back before 24 hours
I got the new iphone add before this..
you forgot the new glas front and back. because that's something we've never seen on an iPhone.
The big question here is\nWhat happened to the iPhone 9 and iPhone W?
You're all still gonna buy it anyway you animals
its funny how Apple forgot to mention that their FaceID technology isn't safe for extended use.\nyou see, basically FaceID works on lighting your face up with infrared and then using a sensor to register the information on distances and such.\nthey forgot to mention that just because you are not blinded by the IR light does not mean that you are not actually blinded by it...\nso with extended use of FaceID (such as with the iPhone X, which you basically have no other option but to rely on it with these new and exciting features -cough- emojis -cough-)\nyou are basically going to slowly lose your eyesight, your vision will become blurry until before you realize it, you will need eyeglasses.\n\n\n\n\n\nso big kudos for apple, for creating a 1000$ emoji machine that will cause you to lose your eyesight :D (i bet they made a deal with glasses manufacturers)
I would love to have a 1 for free
HOLY SHI THAT WAS FUNNY!
I think you forgot a number
You see, now it's $800! -dead

Let's look at Rudy Mancuso IPhone 7 by Pineapple
For more information on the iPhone X please watch a Galaxy S8 or Note 8 ad because they have exactly the same features now.
They played this on a fucking radio station this morning
only #43 on trending? that shit needs to go up!
This is actually all very true
Stop coming out with new Iphone.
jack could write for snl
Should i sell my kidney? Is that worth.
Apple is trying to make humans into emojis, they need to be stopped.
Bwahahahaha I’m a huge Apple fanboy and this is legit 😂😂😭
I had an android ad
I fucking love this 😂
Ummm, I'm NOT paying $1000 for any phone without a headphone jack. Sorry Not Sorry 😐
So they skipped the iphone 9? X means 10 in Roman Numerals
So Apple from iPhone 7, to iPhone 8, to iPhone X. X is the Roman Numeral for 10. Come on, Apple... That's Microsoft's thing! Fucking thieves.
These normally suck.  This one is very funny.  If only I had an animated emoji to express how I feel about it.  Words are hard.
This video is YouTube bot heaven
Well what are they going to get rid of next I would say the phone just the glass
So I can watch porn on a bigger screen???
I'm still calling the iphone 8 the 7S. I don't give a fuck about what anyone else says, it's the 7S, and no one will change my opinion.
this was on a radio station today bc a guy was saying it was funny and accurate, and i yelled at my father bc i knew who you were
Is a parody?  Is it really?
1k this better fly me to Hawaii when I book a vacation there
FUCK THIS...\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to get some VR
i legit watched this at 5 am and i didnt want to wake anybody up so i sealed my mouth
Awh man I feel so sorry for Steve Jobs, they fucked his company so bad.. He is making 360°s in his grave right now fr..
this shit cracked me up badly.. good one
For the face id what if you have a twin that looks like u
That Chicken sound gets me every time watching this.
All we asked for was a charger that actually works, but we ended up getting the headphone jack removed
Friendly reminder that an HTC Vive costs less than this
this was pure gold. Like the iPhone 8 plus though. its the one I will be able to afford
please make a fill in blank,and make it, no _ for Walter.
Those face track emoji things have always been cancer. Its a damn phone and they are marketing the shit like a kids toy.
I seriously cracked up alone watching this
This is so true about of iphone x lmao
Goes from a 7 to an 8 to a ten... Wonder how many beers it took
Also waiting for the college humour parody lol
I need it omg best investment
Jack are you excited for the Sherlock Gnomes movie
Team Samsung!!!
Fucking 30 second non skippable ad
Apple: Iphone 8 I phone 8+ Iphone 10\nWindows: Windows 8 Windows 8.1 Windows 10\nConspiracy???
Spot on
Please checkout the iPhone X  Parody  PPAP Version on my channel.
Honest question.\nI miss the headphone jack so I plan on buying a cheap iPhone 5 or 5s or 6s (whatever it is).\nIs there any downside to that? Will the IOS no longer work well?
This is all just a big marketing scheme for The Emoji Movie: 2
Shot by a Samsung
U still gonna get one anyway ///
Very innovative Apple,next iPhone will you remove the camera and charger?
Funny, but spot on, Apple are a fucking joke, dirty hungry scumbags. I'm definitely switching to Samsung, should have done it years ago!!!
Steve didn't want this
My dad wants one and mum screamed at him saying:\nI WANT A HOLIDAY, SCREW THE IPHONE X
Love this video. He is right about iPhone. I never liked it and I will never buy it because I love my Samsung it's way friking better
Your killing me slowly \n\n\n\n\nI never used emojis ever since the Emoji Movie
the is their best idea since vine!!!! oh wait...
Mark: Did he get you again?\nCoyote: got nailed again\nMark: How did that happen?\nCoyote: *cheu cheu*
Brilliant video! Love the hat by the way - I know someone who where's one like that ;-)

The amount if time you guys spend on your shots is amazing and well worth it! Shout out to Marco for the amazing camera work!

2:08 Where there are rocks, there are tide pools.\nWhere there are tide pools, there are marine creatures.\nWhere there are marine creatures, there are Coyote Petersons
SPIKED by a Sea Urchin? \nThat question mark ruins it. I don't know. You tell me if you got 'SPIKED'.
Hey Coyote, I heard you were going Australia! Have fun
Get bitten by a reef or bull or mako shark baby or juvenile and adult
You should get stung by a Portuguese man ó war AKA floating terror
I wounded what beach there at
Whats up with that fahrenheit? Silly americans.

my dream is to meet you coyote but... I'm am 12 hehe. so I really cant 😂😂😂or at least get a response from you. thanks... Thanks for being the most awesome guy ever
Who else remembers when logan Paul was there
I feel like Coyote almost dies, or gets injured a lot.
You're like Charlie Day's adventurous little brother
Does anyone think he should get punched by a mantis shrimp
That is a banded coral shrimp I have one in my fish tank it gets very big
Um I got bit by a turtle does that make me like coyote??
Coyote: gets stung by sea urchin \nMark: did it get you again
Mark seriously has a dream job. He gets to experience the excitement we all watch for!
Creature with the feature,stinger in a finger.dang hard raping
Imagine he had his own channel on tv
I'm Coyote Peterson, And I'm crazy.
The mouth and the butt should be called Buth. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's not a secret beach if you know where it is :P
Are you in navada
Wow, the graphics are really good in Hawaii. Are those 4K textures? What ENB are you using?
Other people culture is not bizarre, just saying.
do sea urchins have feelings or emotions??
One of these days he's gonna die from doing this I'm sorry but it's true :/
Your videos are always somewhere in the trending list.
Hey Coyote, I got your book for my birthday today I've been wanting it ever since it came out, I love your channel it's inspired me for a long time!!! I just wanted to say thank you for inspiring me! From your number 1 fan Callaway

Hi Coyote! My daughter Caroline (6yr. old) is a big fan.  We have a video question for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrK_XnhVzM4
Clickbait?\nCayote wasn't stung by the one on the thumbnail.
Dude your skin must be one big callus by now
You should get bit by a trained mastiph
You know what would be cool after doing the ocean? Caves
My name is Cotote Peterson, and I'm about to enter the number 1 zone, with the trending list!

I love these long episodes. Even if you don't have enough footage try keeping them this long if possible. So much more enjoyable :D
I swear mark answers some of the dumbest questions
5 seconds in the video. Mark:   did it get you again 
I remember this channel when it had 500k now it's just filled with memers I hate life
Get attack by a monkey

Hey awesome video!! By the way where did you get that leather hat?
Hands down my favorite place to be in Hawaii searching tide pools and fishing by the ocean.. I just moved from the bigisland two months ago.. Reminds me of my past life in the island.. Thanks for the upload. 👍🐟

Hello
Only youtuber that doesn't click-bait 😀 \n\nEdit: Unlike Jake Paul I hate him
You need to collaborate with the rybka twins. Yup probably misspelled their last name.
Hi Nile I am a gymnast myself if you could reply it would be a dream come true, I have hurt my ankle like you did I am really upset I have been following the body bible it has really helped me but do u have more advice to get me through my ankle injury
Sub if you think he is good
I love his smile :)
Why is it every video is on trending but you haven't got at least 1M subscribers?
i love this style of editing, good job! @00:54
Can one of you or all of you blindfolded backflip onto my bed please?
It is great to see that you are well Nile and training hard for the competition, I'm sure this effort will be rewarded. Hugs man
We LOVE you here in Atlanta, Nile. You're infectiously chiper and lovable. congrats on the champiionship and good luck in Canada.
Nile do you ever go to tramp parks or are they too dangerous (or you don't have time)for a professional athlete? You guys could literally bounce off the walls there!

loved this vid mate!! Keep up the good grind boy 😎💖💯
Wilson is literally the best gymnastics male human being 👏👏👏
Trying to study Pharmacology and end here... XD \nLove you Nile!
Do I spy a dirty sock there Nile??
Were you using a cup as a blindfold???
Gymnastics is for girls
I like how they play around and prank each other without being mean about it, like they stopped Nile from actually licking the lotion they put on his hand lol. They seem like nice friends.
How tall are you? Nile
All of their accents XD
I should be doing my homework right now, but here I am.
Is coach Dave any good at gymnastics? You should do a video of you putting him through his paces 😁
Did anyone see his coaches smile get a little bigger when he started talking about the competition ❤️
In the challenge video you did with people on squad you never explained what the meaning of spinal and schmeagle was...?
jajajaja minute 0:37 jajaja wow sexy and hot and minute 2:01 his scream of very very woman jajaja
I love watching your videos and your edits are lit 🔥🔥😍😍
That redhaired gymnast is FINE!\nI hope he didn't hurt his foot...
Jesus loves you all so much! So much that he was tortured and crucified for us and rose on the 3rd day! Please repent of your sins and turn to Jesus before it's too late. If you die in sin you will not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. I say this in love and with hope that this message might stick with at least one of you. Take care and God bless friends(:
For Gods sake. WEAR YOU seat belt properly!!! Arghhhhhh.
He's blowing up!!! One day I will get 100 subs and then blow up and laugh at myself
why is Nile single...well in his own words I can't find the hole  ;)  Great Video!
Your edits are definitely getting better!
Loving your video's Nile! They inspire me and put a smile on my face :) Was just wondering when the men's train smart, keep it real t-shirts will be back in stock? X
Boo.  I really wanted to see them try to flip around blind folded...
Nile there's a picture on the wall at my school
Hi nile I am coming to lilishore or how ever you spell it with my coach because he is in a gym corse to the home of British gymnastics and I can't wait it's a corse or double backs have any pointers I hope you reply xox
I really like how your hair looks not styled like in the beginning of the video, not that I don't love it styled but I think you should leave it natural sometimes!!
hey nile i absolutely love yor videos i do gymnastics myself but you inspire me and i just want to say thank you you are just awesome
Love ur videos mate! Keep up the great work!
Be blindfolded and go through a obstacle course
Who here just to see his abs.No homo.
If I would have know that gymnastics is a bunch of hot-shirtless guys goofing off with one another, I would have joined when I was a kid.  To be young again!  You guys really seem to have fun.  Alright, I would not be piercing my ears, but the other stuff was great.\nbye\nBrennan
why not do the safer things with the blindfold. like handstand. swinging on the bar/rings with the foam blocks under it. or a blindfolded handstand walk race. with things on the side so you know you are going the right way.
Can't wait to see him in Montreal.... montreal gang where your you at ?????
My mum said I went there and I came first in that competition like you did and got a big gold medal to
And I know James hall he used to be my coach !!!!
O Nile Wilson parece com aquele loiro do One Direction ! sempre achei parecido!
Do gymnasts live off of prize money and sponsors, just curious how it works...
This is so sick
I keep on checking my notifications for when ur next video is up! Amazing video!
Best music in the vlogs on youtube
Oh Nile that wonderful smile you have, melts my heart each time 😍
Nile, you said it's never too late to start gymnastics. However I'm 15 and 12 stone. I'm not fat either but I can't lift my own body weight and my balance is terrible plus my flexibility is bad aswell.
You are a naughty lad Nile- wear your seatbelt properly!
I love your video ♡
4:03 is what you came here for
How is my lovely  Nile  doing  love you  lots  😀😀😀  i love  the  vlog  i really  want to try  but I  haven't practice  gymnastics before   can you  give me some advice please
re you gone try to go to the olympics your good enough!

24:38:55 the endearing moment you're probably here for.
Why buying an iPhone can be worst decision you can do?
All you salty Android fans, GET OUTTA HERE. Apple runs this place. 🤘💪
OK, but can the Apple watch detect you're having a heart attack and call 911 for you?  I mean, I just thought of that and I'm an idiot.  Does Apple just hold obvious ideas back and release them later so everyone thinks they're a genius?
The show must go on. Watch ultimate fighting 👇👇👇\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaLFCrYVmPo
How can john cena use an iPhone x?
Have you ever thought about bringing a samsung device into a apple headquarters?
Has anyone noticed ur iPhone 7 is starting to act up since the new ones are coming out
yeah I think I'm gonna stick with my iPhone 7 @1:32:40
Haha basically copying the Samsung s8 . Samsung had all of these features already.  Much better and much cheaper phone . Now outselling apple. Plus yours not locked into I tunes etc  . With samsung you download whatever app you want
Old galaxy's had face unlock for years......how original😒
Put into the iPhone T-mode for deaf people so that sound will be heard through the hearing aid
Im not buying iphones anymore. Sorry for my bad english im from new york
If Steve was still alive, this 'leap forward' would've happened years ago
https://youtu.be/Z2YV7R7V2Ds\nCheck out the remix of taylor swift's new track
Apple is on its way to the biggest tragedy ever..!!
How is this still live
The iPhone x design is a rip off of  the Samsung Galaxy S4 and somehow apple thinks they're innovative by adding a facial Id but Samsung Galaxy S4 already did it apple is over expensive over rated shit
https://youtu.be/w7MGuj54sP4 SONG OF THE SEASON ARIJIT SINGH LEAKED

Nothing new..\nIphoneX is copy of essiential phone.\nAndy Rubin has developed more advanced features than iPhoneX.\nIPHONE X 👎👎👎
those finding the FaceID  fail its at 3:31:00
What piano song is it please? 01:12 - 2:30
Hahaha stop making a fool of people guys with your gimmicks. Your face ID failed In front of trillion of viewers worldwide. And nothing that you showed on this event is new. Everything is a copy or even 10 year old tech. From other phones. The cut screen is from the phone called essential phone from Canada. What is it that you have developed. Anything at all? You need something new. You need me. Connect with me. And I am sure I can come up with something revolutionary. To beat the competition and own the world. I am avid used of Samsung for over 8 years now.  I am sure I will be able to think something out of the box that you may have skipped. I am not challenging you I am challenging myself here.
We do have...\n\n\n\n\n*ONE MORE THING*
I can hack apple and eat it easily
How fun would it be to take a surface into an apple event
I've had an apple phone for a while and I have just got the Huawei p10 and I love it and the best thing is I won't have to sell a kidney for an over priced product \n\n\n\n\nWIN WIN
Apple is running out of ideas for names
I want apple x
So I'm gonna make a copy of my friends picture and put it to unlock :0

Packing all my things for the summer\nLying on my bed it's a bummer\n'Cause I didn't call when I got your number\nBut I liked you a lot\nSlippin' on my dress in soft filters\nEverybody said you're a killer, but I\nCouldn't stop the way I was feeling the day\nYour record dropped\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white mustang\nCaught up in my dreams and forgetting\nI've been acting like armageddon 'cause you\nHeld me in your arms just a little too tight\nThat's what I thought\nSummer's meant for loving and leaving\nI was such a fool for believing that you\nCould change all the ways you've been living\nBut you just couldn't stop\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white mustang\nYou're revving and revving and revving it up\nAnd the sound, it was frightening\nAnd you were getting a part of that\nYou're gonna hit me like lightening
Her voice is enough to feel & imagine the same 😍
Does anyone know where i can find the original 13 beaches?? ive only found covers
Lana is a hard 6 AT BEST
If Rihanna die today she'll be a mothafuckin LEGEND
The heck?!?! There's not even a white mustang at all. Why make a video titled White Mustang with only a Volvo P1800 and a Studebaker Avanti?
I thought she's in mustang (famous tourist area of Himalayas)...
perfect song when you're under drogs <3
Is this a cheap knock off of Dark Horse?
album Lust for Life,
My ex had a white mustang and this hurts a lot.
She's beautiful, lovely and unique at the same time, no one could sing like this
No crowds were hurt in the making of this music video
What the fuck was that?
the day lana stop making music will be the day i say goodbye to life
Great song. I love it. Lana is great for California.
Her voice sends shivers down my spine and straight into my dick <3
Lana i love you come to israel pls😚😚😚😚😚😚
God Bless & Jesus Bless you & your Family members & you all have an Blessed one everybody Amen
My life force just got greater
She as a awesome voice
And now I'm happy cause I'm alive... and its all because this magic song. Yeah, this is amazing, Lana. <33
This song reminds me of tell me by Jwisa https://soundcloud.com/user-208561086/tell-me
She needs to lose like 20 pounds
Lana makes me want to be loved !
Wish it was my hands on them legs
i have a black mustang made in africa
. 🔥🔥🔥🙂🎶🎶🎶 This is great.😊\nI'd love for you to listen to *Out of Whack* by ninanile. It's a song I wrote. I hope you'll like it :')
It's so nostalgic

Before 10m?\nTrue lana fan you are 😍
Lana is so powerful, she has more physical presence than any of the men in her videos, which is so rare for a woman. Not to say that the male actors are bad or inconsequential, on the contrary, they're all very expressive. But Lana is just so... Much. I understand what she meant by I'm stronger than all my men, except for you in Pretty When I Cry.
I would've pulled that dress off faster than I clicked
I hope she will do others vidéos for her songs.
She always has exotic men in her videos 😍😍
Lana, I LOVE how your natural nails look. So pretty. \nAlso who is the baby Gregg Allman?
Im like SOOO gay, but she is so fucking hot. wtf. like help me lord Jaysus. I need to calm tf down. AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT BEAUTIFUL MAN SHE HAD.
God is a woman
The actor reminds me of Awaken with JP haha
anyone knows the place they show at the beggining?
is that iron mans house?
Lana was slick making him eat her out
Haven't heard Lana in a minute 🔥🔥\n\nGonna have my girl singing this to me... only thing is I have White GenZe Scooter, no stang haha  🏍🏍
H💿l💿 it's me. Damn her nails
i feel like the video is wasted on this song. Lana should have released Architecture/Best American Record as a single with this video
Oh, so this song was about a CAR actually...
The beginning of this video reminds me of  high by the beach  song
Did I just see future and Cher singing for GAP? Don't these 2 have enough money to not have to humiliate themselves for more?😂
Idk , as always i see you as always i want to huge youu babiestt😢😢😢😍😍
first purple Lamborghini and now white Mustang what's next red Toyota?
Something about her music puts me in a melancholic trance, reminiscing about the days I felt invincible and free.
Lana is the only artist who could literally come up with a music video that consisted only on her sitting in front of the camera looking at it and i'd still be completely captivated thinking dear fuck, what a goddess
I'm in love with this song ❤❤
Lana's style force you to like this video ❤️
Lana's songs are so haunting and hypnotizing. I love them! Thank you, you beautiful soul for not letting me feel alone! Your songs bring me therapy <3
Interesting choice for it to take place in the future, I was thinking more like the 60s for this song.
If all else fails, just listen to Lana Del Rey and chill.
When they're in the bar reminds me of Groupie Love especially at the end of video
She is so beautiful...😍😍😍
T E   A M O   H E R M O S A ❤
Lana never fails to Amaze me❤😍

I really don't get why you guys do that obnoxious, annoying way of talking. it was literally like the WHOLE VIDEO! I love you and your videos but I had to stop watching. ugh
11:42 is the best thing I've ever seen Q
Love you so much Michael QQQ 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜I hope I can meet you one day 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Nice video but I hated the fact that they were speaking with that horrible voice
Such sluts. Obviously Americans drove on the opposite side of the road did you not know that? Second of all its not a Jall-eh-peno it's a halla-penio

Lilly is literally the cutest human being ever
Michael all of you NEED TO SEE THE VIEW frim a Famous Japanese Restaurant on top og the Hollywood Hills called The Yamashiro even if just for Cocktails. Best View of the Whole City. I used to live down by sunset and It is a must if you are there to visit.

This video gave me cancer
Omg that voice literally needs to stop
Cute video.... I wish Kris was there too
Hey Michael can you please help me? I want to start recording makeup videos but I have really bad anxiety any tips or tricks that will help? Xo
lol i would hate to be seated near them on the plane..
The second i saw Michael wearing his new ysl glasses i got so mad because ive been wanting them so bad. before he even said what they were or that he just got them i paused it and got super jealous then was happy that he was able to get them
haha it's so funny how you say jalapeños
1:10 Sound like a bunch of fucking galahs. Stfu, already. Jesus.
Literally love you Michael QQ
You have the most amazing eyes i have ever seen
Gay people are ashamed to this world !!
Thank you so much love for visiting my country! I love you to the moon and back! I am one of your American subscribers! 💕💖

OMG YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING HILARIOUS. I can't stop laughing 😂😂😂
Wtf is that on my screen?
This was annoying. The girls sound like ducks! It's too much, I normally enjoy your vlogs!
Micheal: don't look at me \nAlso Michael: *poses in the mirror for the camera \n\nSame
Flat screen TV on my face LMFAOO
You should make your own makeup line
Omg rahnee SO does not suit to talk like them... does anyone agree that she's the odd one out? & totally fucking annoying.
Don't mean to be rude but Lilly is just annoying lol. Can she talk normally?
I've been replaying the same bits for 30 minutes, funniest vlog!!! 😂😂
Omg you look so good! Keep on keeping on
Micheal: you guys like the bowl?\n\nEveryone: yeah it's great best ever!!\n\nLily: yeah, it's good😐
Was Shani even on the flight with them
You're so f'ing *G A Y*
Kill it with fire.
SHANI looks sad and not herself
Looks fun but the all the gibberish and pulling faces got old really really fast. 🙄 Ugh. Just talkfkn normal most of the time. It started getting right obnoxious. I love you Michael, been watching a long time.

OMG! you saw die antwoord :o i'm sooooo jelly :'o
no more voices pleaseeeeeeeeeeee
Shani's LA video is curious. She nitpicks many of Skye's behaviors. She notes she does not understand the morphing of the in-group jargon anymore. She made herself look isolated, from the group, as much as she could. FIFO (fit in, or f*** off). Maybe she wants out or tighter group exclusivity.
OBSESSED WITH YOUR HAIRRRR!😍😍🙌🏽🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
Please please let me know what nail polish you're wearing in this video! X x
You are my favorite You Tuber!!! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗
Love your nail color
It's riri good 😊
£6&10 p&p !!!
I'm not camera ready......looks flippin gorgeous!
Loved the video!!
That estee lauder cushion foundation looks amazing. I need that Fenty primer!!! I love your makeup reviews Fleur <3
You look gorgeous!
Loved this video. Loved how long it was and informal. Just chilling it with a friend style.
you literally have a holiday glow with this ! <3
great review. really thorough and well-explained. your word choice is so specific and accurate. keep it up!
I really liked this old style video with a classic review and try on. Looks great and now I would love to go out and pick up that lipgloss! :)
I realize this video was a little on the spontaneous side; that being said, I REALLY enjoyed it. It felt very authentic and had a nice, relaxing vibe. This video was a great example of how you don't need to go all out to make quality content. If the enthusiasm is there, the rest will follow. \nOn a slightly unrelated note, I don't know what it is about this particular video, but you really looked like Hannah in some parts of it. I've never really thought that before. Obviously, I've noticed the familial similarities, but I've never looked at the both of you together and thought, twin moment. For the record, that was meant to be a compliment. You both are beautiful gals!
Really love this style of video, Fleur! Please do more first impression/live haul type videos. xx
Loved this video Fleur! I find that I prefer videos like this (you called it raw). I like it without a studio or studio lighting etc. It feels more natural and less produced and therefore more real. I hope more youtubers go back to this style of video. I want to feel like a friend is telling me about products, not selling me some on HSN. Great job and you look fab!
Fleur, do you still have the London apartment?
LOVE this style of video! You're glowing and look absolutely stunning!!!
I don't think I'm going to indulge in this line myself, but it does look lovely. And I loved the more relaxed, hands-on review style -- both informative and casual, like a (circumstantially one-sided) conversation with a friend!
Might have to get the lip gloss!!
What's your nail color? It's so pretty!
Love this - you should do more first impression videos!
Totally random, but what colour / brand nail polish are you wearing??? Its gorgeous!! x
please do more first impressions just like this! casual, honest, no big production required, just a good solid chat... loved it!
Your skin looks incredible!! Please please do a cushion foundation best and worst! X
The contour colour looks amazing on you!
I'm glad u gave it a good review! I wasn't hyped about the line either BUT once I found out what was in the range, my interest was peaked! I only purchased the lippie and primer. They were out of my foundation and I can't buy anymore highlighters until I've used up what I have. Seriously, how many do u actually need?!?! Ultimately, I'm pleased to see that u liked it bcuz as a black woman, the range of foundations for us is  UNHEARD OF. We still don't have a STRONG market catering to us and our beauty with ALL its many shades. So, I think THAT is really what the hype was about. Black women/girls felt like, FINALLY, someone thought exclusively about US! It's not so much about Riyanna (did I spell that right?) and if my Caucasian, and Asian sisters don't understand that, then you've missed the whole point. #bravo Fleur!
Loved the style of this vid xx
Just loved this video Fleur - so beautiful  and a genuine  review
Did anyone else hear Ri Ri good at the end as opposed to really, really good?! Would be super witty if so!
HAHA I LOVED this video!  Was so laid back and casual!  And then when she says Aw guys.... aw nooo... is this really sh!t!?!?! Hilarious considering you never really hear her chatting like that in her videos!   Best video in a while.... and I'm not biased because I love them all! X
I feel like you match exactly my colouring! Hope you get to try the foundation in the right shade one day
Loved the style of this video, very natural X x
Tear the blotting paper against the blade from one side to the other instead of ripping it :)
Love this video Fleur! So different for you, in a good way 😊 you also look absolutely beautiful! X
Are you going to get a foundation that matches for a second review?
Oh my goodness I love love loved this video! I enjoyed the more relaxed vibe you had going on and you are looking so beautiful. Love to you, Mike & all your fur children! Xx
I hope your read this, but I'm in love with your tragus piercing. Would you mind sharing where you got it? It's so cute!
Your skin looks amazing 😍 pregnancy is really working for you! Are you going to try another shade of foundation? Would be good to hear your opinion of your shade, also love the casualness to the video xxx
I wish you used the white because I haven't seen a review with it yet
very nice video, good review :)
your skin looks amazing in this Fleur! <3
You should never buy makeup online , you should always try it first on your face (physically go to the shop)  , because when you buy online it always ends up being lighter or darker in real life.
I really appreciate your review and POV!
I have never been drawn to packaging. I don't get that. When shopping for make-up I don't look at packaging at all. Coz what does it help when the product itself is sh**?
Loved this video!! I would have thought, though, that this brand was made by the same guys who did Kim K's line!  I dunno if I'm too sold on many of the products -- I might try the highlighter!
Love the autheticity, you are for sure the best looking wife doing stuff around the house 😉 love your videos and I love the pregnany content and home vlogs/weekend vlogs with mike the most 😊 👫🐕💖
Let's be honest white people have so many brands that work for them that's why they're not as hyped for Fenty beauty
I love how realistic you are in the video & review
Fleur, I love how your initial fail of not attending the party is turning out. This video with you all excited about trying new products is lovely to watch, you look absolutely stunning, and your review is the one I'll trust on this range. Sending love ♥
do you put on liquid foundation before putting on the Estée Lauder powder? And is it the Estée Lauder double wear cushion bb you used? X
Finally someone who doesn't like trophy wife! Looks like a sparkly golden shower on people's face
Yeah! Everything in focus! Please always film this way. Brilliant x
Thats it.. I'm buying me some Fenty Beauty!! lol
You're so pretty💕
the blotting paper packaging is such a cool idea! i just wish it worked! great video! xo from my channel to your’s <3
The products are interesting but that blotting of paper would probably be a no go for me! ❤️\nYou definitely have that pregnancy glow! 😃
That lip gloss is beautiful! Thank you for the honest review.\nAnd you look absolutely glowing! Hope you are feeling ok lovely xx❤️👍
I bought some of the products and was super impressed by the quality.
What colour do u wear in the Estée Lauder?
You remove your make - up and still you look just as amazing as before! ^^
I love the contour stick on you. You look fresh.
Which nailpolish do you have on your nails?
You're looking more like your sister now.
I bought the gloss in Stockholm last week and like you it looks really nice on me, and the smell is lovely! It was a total frenzy in the Sephora there so that was all I was able to try. Great review!  Thanks xxxx
These subtle hues were beautiful on you.Apart one review I saw this morning, everybody is liking this foundation and the highlighters, thanks Rihanna and thanks to you for this moment of calm with makeup !
fleur: complains about those in-between blusher/highlighters and not quite knowing where to apply them\nalso fleur: proceeds to make it look SO GOOD
Fleur thinks she looks rough. 😂😂😂😂 she should see me on a regular basis
Really enjoyed your watching your review, have a great day!
I loveeee that you did a first impressions too 😍 proper reviewer, honestly is the best policy 👏🏽💕
Definitely recommend going in to store to get colour matched - I went yesterday and it was such a good experience! Also the different shades have warm and cool undertones and so going up a number might not mean a darker shade. I thought I would be 150 from looking online but ended up with 130 which is a similar shade but with a different undertone meaning it looked darker on my skin and a much better match!
Thank you for making this! I definitely trust your opinion because I tend to like the same things as you :)
what a beautiful review. this is exactly why you are my favourite youtuber. proud to be  a fan of you (and rihanna duh!)
I think the foundation wouldn't have been so bad with more of a chance, on every video I've seen it has oxidised massively! And the esteem lauder looked a bit orange maybe
You've made me want the gloss sooo much! I'm obsessed with yours in 'Written In The Stars' so I think I'll get it for when I run out of back-ups, it looks like such a pretty deeper nude! x
You should've left the Rihanna foundation on as it oxidises!!x
I'm so glad you did this video because I feel like your opinion is extremely reliable xx plus I love the set up of this video and how casual it is 😊😊 xxx
Thank you for doing a genuine and honest review. So many people just want to flatter celebrities even if the products aren't that good, this is a trustworthy review and clarifies all pros and cons
What did you use to curl your hair? My ghds have just packed in and looking to make a new investment.  Thaaaanks :)
'...is that really shit?' i lol'd😂 loved this video!
Always love your review so happy that you did it, I love the foundation, I do have mixty oily and a bit of dryness in a few area but the foundation is just awesome for me as well of the Killawatt duo highlighter. Do agree with you on the rest too the stick doesn't really worth the hype as well as the blowting powder. Thank you for your unbuyest review 😍😍😍😍
You look amazing!!!! I really liked the style of this video as well. I'm so tempted to get the primer and the highlighter duo set now!!!!!
What shade do you use in the Estée Lauder foundation?
I wanted to say thank you for doing this!  A lot of vloggers who are not women of color are turning their noses up at this. Thank you for doing this for your colorful audience!
I really like this video. I'm not really into Fenty Beauty or Rihanna but I was curious if you would like it. I think you gave good and honest feedback that was really helpful for people who do want to invest/spend their money on these products. I also like the old school feel of this video. Because youtube videos has become really professional in the last few years (not necessarily a bad thing), the production of the video's has really gone up which sometimes gives me the feel of video's being a commercial instead of someone's opinion I can relate to. This is not a criticism on your other video’s btw, just wanted to say I really like this video in particular. Honest, helpful and relatable.
That toilet roll blotting paper was so lame though. How could they even sell that
what shade are you in estee lauder double wear cushion?
Best review I have seen on this brand! Love it!
Really REALLY loved this style of video, including the natural looking lighting. It seemed very spare of the moment and I got the feeling you weren't planning on putting the makeup on to start with. Something about it just seems so natural and friendly (not saying you aren't always friendly 😁) keep them coming and I hope you are keeping well xxx
The only Fenty beauty video I've watched! I'm intrigued by the brand but felt so overwhelmed by all the videos in my sub box. This appealed to me though, probably because it's you Fleur ☺️👍🏼
Which colour you have in the Estee lauder cushion foundation .😄
Fleur I just saw a picture where the blotting paper was turned upside down so that if you want to rip it it is facing upwards \nnot sure if you understand what I mean but maybe it'll work better that way 😊\nAnd also loved this video you look absolutely stunning!
I got a gift card for Sephora a few months ago but didn't know what I wanted. Now I finally have something to use them on.
i've missed the tutorials ! :)
Fleur's reviews are the best reviews 💕
Fleur one of the perks of this Fenty Beauty range is that it has the same initials as yours ! That's so cool !
I think I know what I will buy now as I wasn't sure which products to go for. Thanks for the review.
I just discovered your channel and I keep coming back to this video idk why😂 Love your personality
Loved this style of video!
  P A Y  W I T H  Y O U R  F A C E
No thanks. I will be getting the note 8.
Gimmicks. One after another. Smart phones have hit a wall.
was it me or the unlocking feature failed when it was used ( second time )
APPLE, stop coming out with a new damn IPHONE
Legends say the poor gentlemen is still smiling 1:11
Chillin with my 6. Sure there are people happy even with a 5 or 5c. First no jack and now no charging port or even a home button? Just keep it simple the way people want it.
Its just a Galaxy S8 cop out for way more money
I'd beg on the streets for money to buy this phone, it is just that good.
The display is manufactured by samsung. Proud with my note 8😁
I'm not going to spend a grand on this shiny potato.
I never used iphone until now
But can you throw it at the wall without breaking it?
Someone grabs your phone\nYou close your eyes\nThey run away
Cal it the i onlyrichpeoplecanbuythis
I Thought they learned thier lesson about having a glass back. Honestly apple just skipped over 9 to get here, so im calling this the     I phone 9.
lol iphone 10? we're still at the 7 bruh
This is garbage. Never buying Apple again.
THIS POOR GENTLEMAN FROM APPLE
imo the innovation on this phone is not worth $1000
I'm down for the nicer screen with Dolby Vision and HDR but man....just imagining myself having to pick up the phone off the table every single time to look directly at it when I want to glance over at stocks and e-mail at least 30 times a day.  And let's bring some attention to the notch where the camera and sensors are.  That will block part of your video content. And while Netflix and Amazon Video requires a 4K display to give HDR content, the X not being a 4K display negates its Dolby Vision and HDR10 on this phone.
Glass back, damn better buy their case, glass no scratch screen protector and warranty and that's over about $1200.00 spent in a day.
Yah I think I'll stick to my iPhone 6
I was thinking why I don't know about this, check because all the videos were only 2 days ago ...oh
Ok sorry this is so dumb
Take that android. This iPhone is so much more legit than anything they could make
Alright tell us how much they paid you
It's very beautiful, it's insane how far technology has gone
What the hell happened to 8 and 9?? This is bullsh*t
So this is real wow
Note 8 has all this with a bigger screen, stylus and expandable memory. Wtf apple??? You used to be innovative...
Haha!  The Face unlock didn't work once during this video.  Complete fail.
If the iphone X gets robbed all the person has to do to unlock it is to get the owner to say CHEESE! lol
wow   what a great iphone . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n ok ,i choose samsung .
hopefully they release a iphone 9 with all the same stuff as the X but with a headphone jack and a home button
everyone i find it stupid of you and you lose all credibility when you speak about the bad things and the bad things only. NO, this is not an s8 with lower resolution display, NO this is not the start of apple removing every port, NO this is not the ishit 8, NO this is not the iphone Xpensive. do your research and complain about actual things like that the new aspect ratio is still very limited in terms of support from developers, the weird banner creates issues s does the fact that its a new design and it has no touch id and unproven face id. please just do some research before you make more people think you're idiots, all your doing is damaging yourself when you do that. thank you have a nice day.
Apple is killing us with these phones
can u unlock it with your face in the dark?
*someone takes your phone and points it at you to unlock it* so what do you do? Close your eyes? But now while you're eyes are closed they can just leave with your phone. Great job Apple
Would it still be able to scan my face if I am in the dark?
How much battery it will be?
Im watching this on my s8 XD just saying
im sorry but this is so stupid. are they gonna take away the screen next
So where's Siri then??????
Like the Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. Hmm  nothing new
Good point. That's a huge security problem - someone just needs to point your phone to your face to unlock it. And Face ID looks to take a bit too long anyway to register your face. I prefer Touch ID. I don't want to have to position my phone in front of my face and wait in order for it to unlock. The quick read on my fingerprint is more than enough and safe.
I took out my samsung s8 and said to my friend that I got new iphone x.... he believed me. Either Iphone x sucks or I need to get new friends... or both
honestly iPhones are looking more and more like androids...
iPhone 20:\n\n• no home button\n• no headphone jack\n• no camera\n• no battery\n• no apple logo\n• 4k screen\n• more pointless updates\n• built in pop socket\n• $1000\n\n😀
lol I'm balling out with the x. Getting a 256g, a bunch of cases. Wireless dock when it comes out and a bunch more. But my wallet is going to cry
How do I go about selling my kidney
What ever happened to progress... 12 megapixel caneras still! How cute
I literally just upgraded from a cracked iPhone 5 to a iPhone 7 and now there's an Iphone 10.........
iPhone 8\niPhone X\niPhone XI\niPhone 1100\niPhone 2x-5=21\niPhone sqrt(12.25*16)\niPhone X + 1/2(iPhone X)\niPhone $16k price tag\niPhone 7th prime number\niPhone product of the numbers we skipped\niPhone Footlong\niPhone whoops we made it too big it's just an iPad now
6k poor communists dislike this. Communists with money love an iPhone.
What if you look like a totally different person without makeup on
Ohh looks like is time to sell my other kidney.
I kinda just prefer the iPhone to be more simple ya know with the regular head phones slot, the finger print scanner, or just manually putting in the password for a lower price
I'm not paying $999 dollars for something i'll break after I drop it 2 feet from the ground once
I Wish I had money
not much to be hipped up about it from what i see . My 6 plus is just fine
Apple is history.  There will be no more innovation.  Only people abusing the remains of a business structure for wealth.  Probably partying it up.
i like my home button 😂
Jesus Christ 1000$ are they insane?
Would you rather get 1 billion dollars or get a free iPhone X?
why this guy keep saying super beautiful? Something wrong with his eye?  it is ugly design, too bulky, the borderless is not borderless, there is thick line on side of screen.
Then face unlock has been around for years. I have an old galaxy from a few years ago that does the same thing......How original......😒
So that's the phone that costs more than a 1000£. I don't see anything special about it making it worth the price.
Who put the apple on that Samsung galaxy 6.
Hey guys I just thought of a really funny joke on my own: iPhone Xpensive. Get it??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
iPhones are for simple people.
Introducing the new iPhone 20 with 6 cameras and new x-ray vision \nOh you liked the lock button to bad now you have to swipe from the right side \nYou liked the volume buttons to bad now you have to swipe to the left\n\nLadies and gentlemen I present you the future for iPhones
While Apple is happy to make use of free software to construct its operating system, almost all of the software distributed with its devices is proprietary.

What happens if your twins? You know. The face ID.
I already broke it just by looking at it. Glass galore.
What if someone in your school steals it and goes to your Instagram or Facebook or even on Snapchat with a picture of your face can they unlock the phone like that?
*what* *happened* *to* *iphone* 9??
R.i.p Steve jobs vision

I guess you could say it's....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPENSIVE BUAHAHAHAHA. I'll just leave now
plagiarism samsung!
Youre stealing from book of life disney, stop lying to yourself
The last time Disney made a big music star it became a virus...\nthen came Jake Paul
i love that song
The typical music solves everything and is the source of all happiness. I'll watch this movie but I'm not expecting much.
As much as I love disney films, this is closely similar to the Book of Life
So is this a spinoff of The book of life? It would be interesting to see an Easter egg or connection this looks interesting.
Could you imagine Walt's face watching this hahahaha
Whats the Back ground violin name is??
A movie about mexican music, and you play coldplay?  Okk
My dog's name is Coco
Looks AMAZING! Will be watching it! :)
This is so much like the book of life its fuckin insane
The least they could've done was play Mexican music or music from the movie. Like Como La Flor or something.
I'm in love with the coco! 🍚
Oh...my...god😂\nWhat is Disney getting into the Spic business now. 😂🖕
It's like the book of life
This is deadass just a Pixar version of The Book of Life
I'll be honest, this looks like it's ripping off the book of life.  Which is not something I thought would ever get ripped off
? Wasn't this already a movie?
Already better than the book of life
Ummm So was planned before the Book of Life??? Or after?
Stuff i hear about this movie 1. Book of life ripoff even do its not 2 a lot of donald trump jokes
Great song selection goes with the movie very well , seems like its gonna be good.
A pixar movie used to be an event...
0:44 It's not a phase I swear Great Great Grandpa!
What artist is covering Bittersweet Symphony here?
You definitely copied the movie THE BOOK OF LIFE
The book of life
This looks great but why Bitter Sweet Symphony? There are a lot of great mexican songs. I know it's just a trailer but I see it as a missed opportunity :(
Almost seems like a copy of The Book of Life. idk lots of similarities
I'm hyped for this. can't wait!
This reminds me of The Corpse Bride
Grim, Papyrus, the spooky scary skeliton crew, Jack; Its a skeliton reunion
This movie definitely is trying to spread Pixar's wings in the culture department. I am not that knowledgeable about Hispanic culture, but this definitely seems worth a try!
0:23 my mom to me and my brothers
The use of Bittersweet Symphony works so well!
This might be the best animation pixar has done -- the colors and movements are stunning!
This is like The Story Book of Life, it's pretty much the same concept
I don't know if I want to see this. Seeing that chancla gave me some painful flashbacks lol
If this trailer does ant get you hyped for this film, I don't know what will. I am very excited for this beautiful and vibrant film:) #PixarCoco
I thought all pixar characters are white
The left will use this as an excuse to erase history.
Is it me or this movie is somewhat The Book of Life???
i never knew the name of the background song starting at 0:35
I can't wait to watch this!
Mexican kid going to the afterlife named\n CoCo\n\nI am already sad
This is a true homenage to the  Mexican Culture (aside from the Book of Life) and one of the most popular celebration of all which I'm proud to be part of \n\nVIVA MEXICO!!!
what is that song called playing in the background
Who's wants an inside out 2
Cool can't wait. Subscribe to my page I'm new I'm a singer song writer I'm 19 my instagram is @pauly.riley    :)))
Isn't this like Rock Dog?
What's the name of the song for the trailer
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY THATS MY SONG
Kinda a copy cat of the book of life
This looks pretty good but I'm probably not going to see it. I feel like that's how it is with most people watching this.
Ahh finally the book of life 2 is gonna come out
I'm curious which cover of Bittersweet Symphony this is?
Book of life rip off
This is pixer book of life rip off\n\nIf no one remembers u in the living world  u will die in the skeleton  relm STRAIGHT  OUT OF BOPK OF LIFE COME ON U CAN'T DEBUNK THAT
Damn, to see my mothers culture, one in which she tells me lots about, were the festivals are held to emulate what it's like, makes me so damn happy. I can't wait to see this with my family.
https://youtu.be/r0ULgPbKKuk check out this new music video!!!
Reminds me of Book of Life, with a sprinkle of Kubo.
This looks terrible and I'm a big supporter of these kinds of movies but it looks so bad
Anyone else thinking about Grim Fandango while watching this?
NETFLIX, DISNEY,  and ALL movies I REVIEW ON MY CHANNEL! IT'S AWWWESOME
Cant wait to see this in Español Latino
I can't wait for The Book Of Life 2! Honestly, I thought that it didn't need a sequel, personally. But as long as it's handled with care for the first movie, it's gonna be a good addition to the lore.
This is the second animated film to feature Hispanic culture through a theme of Dia de los Muertos. Is that all our culture has to offer cinematically, Hollywood?
The book of life part 2?
This Conan O'Brien biopic looks a bit odd... but I still like it.\n*GO* *TEAM* *COCO*
Trump's about to deport this movie.
Its basically saying A Christmas Carol is the same as Bad Santa. The Book of Life and CoCo are examples of the same holiday and the same cultures + rituals. Its about music, celebrating life after death, and expressing that through the art of animation. I'm sure PIXAR will bring their touch of magic that will give it a sense of uniqueness that we are all in love with!
The grandma is gonna die. Guaranteed.
Saying that this movie is copying The Book of Life is like saying Home Alone is copying How the Grinch Stole Christmas because they are both about Christmas
New Vietnam game highlights 60fps on Ultra settings: https://youtu.be/_ChxsVDJt0E

Can people stop comparing this to the Book of life already? Two completely different movies... 🤦‍♂️
cough Book of life knock off
🐸SEAN HAS A MESSAGE FOR ALL THE WH REPORTERS.┌∩┐ (◣◢)┌∩┐\nP.S. THE INAUGURATION HAD THE BIGGEST AUDIENCE OF ANY AS WAS THE STATEMENT. NOT NECESSARILY JUST THE CROWD IN ATTENDANCE. THE *ENTIRE* AUDIENCE. THOSE BS SIDE BY SIDE STILLS COMPARING THE CROWDS OF HIS AND OBAMAS WERE TAKEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY. OBAMAS WAS AT THE START OF THE SHOW AND TRUMPS WAS HOURS BEFORE. FLAKE NUDES AGAIN.
Welcome to #LosAngeles Sean Spicer- Thank You for your service,.
There's a lot of us who wanted to be focused on his agenda...  but Trump's focus is always on size.
And did anyone notice when he said WERE (friends in the press) and somebody in the crowd audibly went 'ahhhww'
He started out pretty decent, but then he basically admitted lying was okay. :/
Thanks Sean for your service.\n\n\n\n\n\nSAID NO ONE EVERRRREE
... smallest audience I've ever seen on Kimmel and Spicer's spine is the newest flavor of gelato at 7/11... No joke. Just kidding. Joke.
My man Spicy! But where's your neck bro?
Kimmel is such a tool.
Spicer was very professional in this interview.
his shame will never leave him
His friend asks him, Are you going to be telling the truth while you're at that podium.....    The entire time he's saying he will be, he's subtly shaking his head.....  lol.
For the rest of his life, he'll only be a joke.
oh no he did not win the Election...no no no!!
Most of us feel a great sympathy for Sean Spicer. He did a great job under quite hopeless conditions.
When he first walked out I honestly thought it was Melissa McCarthy as spicer
Why do I like him?
disagree on facts not possible ? \nDonald trump is president \ndemarcates say not my president .\nI guess we can disagree on facts
it was a huge deal for trumos fragile ego
Things just got a little more Spicy
ugh Jesus Christ Jimmy why are you giving this guy a platform........ did we not learn anything from the election
He's so obviously trying so hard not to say anything that could piss Trump off.
This guy is a Damn Rock Star
Spicers exact words that day were that it was the largest audience to witness an inauguration in person AND around the globe. A worldwide audience, yet Kimmel concentrates on a photo taken earlier in the day to deflect from this fact.
Trump got elected off the back of people's distrust of lying politicians... Then Spicer helps him create an environment where nobody can take seriously any statement the White House issues. Other people can think this guy's a loveable buffoon if they want
It's like he's just been evicted from the big brother house
He looks like the T-1000
I wish he gave a straight answer about the crowed seize, he's still loyal to the president!
he is still a slimy, lying traitor in my book.
it's always strange to me how much the left hates on this man, and then they completely turn it around and say he was just doing his job lol.
He really does look like Melissa.
Spicer is still in the NAvy.  i think that is why he is thanked for his service.  whether he knows it or not.
We have so many problems, They worry about Dreamers stealing jobs from black young people. Why would black inner city gang members making a mint selling drugs inside ransacked US cities take a McDonald's job? They are holding whole cities hostage and your worried about some honest hard working people working and paying taxes? We need good people not thugs and that's is what we have even before DACA was ever thought of. I'll vote to keep the Mexicans and bring even more diversity through a legal program set up by Congress. That way a few people can come who couldn't afford it. We get better citizens and cities rejuvenated and they get to try a free country on for size. Win win for all. Go President Trump, Go Republicans, Go Democrats, and God bless the Dreamers.
This was his chance to shine and redeem himself, but I think he wasted the opportunity.
Who else expected Melissa McCarthy to appear when Jimmy said hear's sean spicer.
This whole interview, Kimmy Kimmel was trying to get Sean to admit that he was wrong or that the President has lied. Sean was having none of this, and every turn was defensive.
U hung in there..well done spicy
Thats a tight suit
Es mas bueno!!  😄
Spicer for president 2020!
I love how Sean Spicer is capable of laughing at himself, quite a humble man.
Spicy! He and Melisa McCarthy should do a skit together on SNL.
There were 1.5 million people clapping for him period!!
I agree with most people Spicey rocks! He had a horrible job.
When he laughs he reminds me of Spencer Gilbert
I only subscribe if the channel are all about 🇺🇸specially stand with president trump and provide all true news for 🇺🇸 and I hope your channel is.    And I did thank u
He needs to host SNL.
That seat. Uncomfortable. The back cushion is too big and pushes him off the front.\n\nI'm ADD. Sorry.
Look at him at 2:46 he is like hey man I know it was a shitty crowd but i had to say what I was told.
That press conference question from Spicer's 'friend' was sort of pointless.\nA liar will have no problem claiming he's totally honest.\nNice try though.
SPICY!!! By the way: Trump is the best President in history!
Truth is the future.\nCracking factual truth is a serious matter.\nWho's paying for this?
I have to applaud the positive messages on these threads.  The guy was in the crosshairs and took a lot of crap - but he was serving his country to the best of his ability for a President that made life very difficult for him.  I hope Sean or some of his staff reads through this feedback on the interview with Kimmel and he takes some heart from it.
He described following trump was the smarter thing to do and not getting the heat from the people trying to help him correcting errors
Why is trump so obsessed with crowd size? Did they tell you to lie about the crowd size? Did trump himself tell you? Do you personally feel the crowd size was smaller? Why does he keep harping on the crowd size Sean? Have you seen him naked Sean? Did trump actually believe the crowd size was that big? What is it about the crowd size? Back to the crowd size. Why does he even care about the crowd size?!?!?
*Sean Spicer* looks like he'd go at it with 5 *Antifa* young dudes in a Fight Club and laugh about later over beers 😂👍😉
Well I find it funny that the MSM used propaganda to belittle the size of the crowd .
fake jimmy kimmel. karma is waiting for you ...
This video explains a lot, especially why a lots of republicans seem to deviate from reality.
I just wanna like this guy
The administration really did Sean Spicer dirty. I can't believe they made Mooch the director and not him omg. I would be so livid if i did all that and didn't get the job I promised.
I don't hate spicy but I think he's getting too much credit, he did CHOOSE to work for Trump.
He does sound like Melissa McCarthy
He looks healthier. Not the pale face and tired, irritated red eyes lol.
Clear evidence he's just a normal guy that had a bad job and got on with it. Good on him!
After the first 2 seconds of the video, when Jimmy says well here we go, I couldn't help but laugh.
He seems more relaxed. I wonder why....
I like how everyone in the trump administration is basically a reality tv star now. It's pretty sad.
Before, I really didn't get the Melissa McCarthy Thing, but now I see the resemblance is impeccable!!!
He somehow makes sitting in a chair look like leaning against a wall
This was the largest crowd size in history. PERIOD.
Never forget! If you people forgive these people who helped 45 lie and spread false information, then it encourages people to keep serving horrible leaders. Spicer needs to pay the price for hes crime against democracy.
Kimmel gets more dumb and cynical every day it seems
SNL  is going to miss  spicy
Face the FACTS!
Good job Spicer
SPICEY SPICEY
I wish Kimmel mentioned Melissa McArthy from SNL
Hey, there you are again, Sean!  You're kind of cute, the way you look like a hat-less mushroom stem with a tiny human face on it   :)
People are saying he's not that bad and a good guy? He just admitted that he lied essentially and justified doing it to represent the president's voice
Spicer: we can sometimes disagree with the facts\n\nThats the biggest problem we have in america right now. People believe whatever they choose to belive, regardless of it being true or being complete bull..
Trump used the word articulated....nah don't think so! Although he knows the best words
So we are okay with abandoning facts?
This is so wrong what is Facts
Yes he did win but lets deal with facts.
It was my job to speak* on behalf of the president.\n\n* lie
I am disappointed that Spicer is a real person.  I was hoping that was some sort of horror flick role he was playing but he's obviously STILL oblivious to his duty as a citizen to serve the voters and our Constitution and to respect our 4th Estate.  Traitorous, mercenary... disgrace.
Sean's face while Jimmy is recalling the crowd size incident. He KNOWS it was all bullshit.
Packed on a few pounds
Spice boy wants people to like him after he sold his soul to the devil.
Never should your job be able to force you into lying to the nation.\nIf it does and you go along with it, you're a liar and a fraud and also a coward. \nThanks anyways but...if you had some balls or a spine or values, you wouldn't lie to america for job security!!!
Seems like an alright guy, he just had to work for the worst administration ever
Wow I havent seen the video yet, but are you people this easily swayed? As soon as the guy smiles and act likeable on a talkshow you forgive months and months of lies, misdirection and attacks on the free press. Really?\n\nThis guy is a horrible person, and he will be a horrible person once I´ve watched this interview. It doesn´t change anything.
There's only one person I hate more than Trump and it's the person who works for him, or voted for him, or gives him excuses.  The real evil isn't people who do bad things it's people who watch it happen and do nothing to stop it.
In those two-shots, he looks like Mickey Rooney. No offense to Mickey Rooney. 
7:39 His job is to articulate the president's position. Because the president isn't very articulate, right?
he had to defend trumps bullshit 24/7.. he seems quite released now...
I hope Jimmy asks what he thinks about going from being portrayed by a woman on SNL, to actually being replaced by one on the podium. That must have been a loooooong stress cry.
No.  I'm sorry, but while Spicer may be a pleasant enough fella, he compromised his integrity and his intellect to serve as the spokesman for a president who was, at the time Spicer took the job, clearly devoid of the morals, competence, and dignity required for the job.  Spicer had a rough go of it, but I can't have sympathy for him.  He got exactly what he signed up for.
Don't humanize these fcks.
Nothing more scary in the 70's than an old fridge containing Jimmy Saville and Gary glitter.
1 less VLOG on the trending makes me happy
What happens when the soviets attack and we've smashed all the doors off our Fridges? How will we protect ourselves from the nuclear blast wave?!
why the fuck is this trending
I spent the best years of my childhood playing hide n seek in an old fridge....
Hi, kids. Can you say natural selection?\n\nNo? Well, I'll just leave you alone with this old fridge and we'll see if you make the species stronger or not.
I play with an old fridge everyday and I haven't died yet 👌🏻
All new refrigeration appliances have a magnet which enables the door to be easily opened if someone decides to get inside.\nThis video is just old history.
Is it impossible to open the fridge from the inside? This makes me want to climb inaide one and try it.
Please explain how a video with 35k views gets in trending, YouTube?
Wtf will i use for a castle now
This is serious..i was killed in the 70's by an old fridge.
Maybe they wanted to die, who are we to deny a child the right to death by fridge?
More like killing a child's dreams of killing themselves
In America you eat from the fridge in Soviet Russia fridge eats you
I swear they talked about this on a recent Triforce episode?
This campaign must have run deep, I still see white goods dumped, but at least they took the door off
I've been living with one of these silent killers all my life. Please send help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvJb1bVgVRA&t=62s link to another classic uk institution
Russian kids would've no problem
It saved Indiana Jones... yep that happened
Why is this trending? Are fridge deaths on the rise
People say this for many things but this is the best example\n\n\nWhy is this trending ?!
Why does this PIF (Public Information Film) STILL scares the living day lights out of people?.
At least it would preserve the corpse.
why is this trending in 2017
Chilling
Wtf
Yeh, this would have been much better narrated by pflax as Sean Bean
Old fridges can kill??? Omg didn't know the 70s had sentient fridges. They kept that one hidden... 😱
Now the kids are just eating the entirety of the content in the fridge . .yay obesity . If kids knew they could kill might scare em off a bit
Kim Jong-Un making this trend?
The triforce podcast
One saved Indiana Jones.
Anyone here from YogPod Triforce?
Old fridges can kill!!
THANKS EVERYONE!!!
Why is this 33 on trending though
Why is this trending???!? Lol
I'm well happy something very British is trending. Pleasant surprise uploader or did you kind of expect it? XD
Who the hell keeps an old fridge at home?
Why is this trending?
0:13 Boy, that escalated quickly
This was on TV recently.
why would i ever go into a fridge?
Why is this number 14 on trending
This is what YouTube needs more of these old classic British videos
Good!  One less mindless Vlog on trending!
This is trending because in a recent episode of Great British Bake Off, one of the presenters (Noel fielding) was locked in a fridge as part of a transition clip I believe, and there were loads of complaints to ofcom about it, as many children have died by getting stuck in old fridges and freezers.
The most British thing ever. FRIDGES ARE THE REAL PROBLEM WAKE UP SHEEPLE
Indiana jones survived in one
Ok then
why is this trenidng 2011 rly..
Ok. I'll remember
I'm assuming this public service announcement is so on the nose and heavy handed because something serious happened...
Don't play inside of fridges, noted. Thanks again for this. 
It's sad when Google/YouTube promote a 70s ad instead of promoting ads for YouTubers.
The Great British Bake-Off.
The YogPod sent me. Be Warned.
Nowadays the danger of this is invisible because fridges now have magnetic seals instead of locks and they put masking tape over the doors to keep children out.
nuke bomb shield to indaina jones
What a shame! I'm single, on benefits, and I bought a luxury fridge freezer for £2000. It got me into a lot of debt and now I've been evicted. I thought I could live in my fridge as its big enough but I guess not. Oh well, I'll have to shiver on the streets instead.
I remember the BBC broadcasting this child safety film inbetween Jim'll Fix It and Top Of The Tops
Kiss the sky and the gunner were the only 2 songs on the album i downloaded
Mgk turned the myth up in Minneapolis tonight holy fuck
why does this guy go after so many underage girls?? where are the police?? where are their parents??
To all those who can't accept change, unsubscribing, and aren't open minded to music, I say to you.. goodbye!  you shall not be missed. Is this song one of his best? maybe not, but changing is how you move forward, and you have to deal with it.
Last nite i smoke my wife 😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/PQND2E_s7eM this little kid is almost killed by his drunken father! Pleaz share as much as U can!
He's come a long way from stomping on Microsoft tablets!
MGK is going mainstream pop top 40 and I'm into it cause he a snack
we need more of this kind of song
My nigga MGK den went to his roots 🤦🏽‍♂️ he went boy band rockstar on us & put his rapping twist to it
HERE BEFORE THE 1M CLUB
Not original at all
Honestly before watching I was expecting some rapping! I love his new style it fits him.
As soon as I heard the twelvies scream at 1:05 I knew this song would be garbage.
Been a fan since 2008, still a fan. 🤝
If anyone checks out my channel I'd be hugely grateful. Have a blessed day. 🙏
is that Alex Jones?
Erase me? Pretty much the same concept in the video. And same song in a way... love the song though
This is music my friends
This song isn't new....they just made a video for it 🙄
This video reminds me a bit Outkast Hey ya. I don't know why. :)
At first is this green day or MGK....when spark his flow God damn...fell in love😍😍😍
While this is nothing like the old machine gun Kelly and his old music is absolutely amazing not only is it cool that he is trying out a new style but it's also really cool to know that he can do really good with multiple music styles. No matter what type of music he makes his music will always be god like and I would always listen to it. This song is great, love you MGK
Holy shit this is great. Great job
i guess they making all rappers sing these days
crypto coin talks anyone trying to take their lambo to the moon follow it.
🙂. I like this.\nI'd love for you to listen to *Out of Whack* by ninanile. It's a song I wrote. I hope you'll like it :')
Why did mgk make throw away bars for the charts
I wish you the best on your success.
Homie can do whatever the fuck he wants ... cuz he is Machine gun kelly . Got ohio and some on his back and you on his dick... eh-yo click clack this link ta get yer earz finessed... https://youtu.be/4p_agBOsw9g
if your name is machine gun kelly don't be posting this pissy ass shit
This has a wicked blink 182 feel to it. Killed it kells, killed it!
This shit is superrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr trash! I swear to god
The ending was priceless....so funny. I laughed so hard when he got got on stage and was like, oh sh**
This is Green Day with rapping... Well. I hope you paid for the rights for the backtrack. Or got permission. If not, potential suing? Honestly, this is way too similar.
Since when did MGK do rock !
Hell yeah kells number 10 on trending hopefully you get higher lace up!!
aludoss .... take a part of my enter aki !! Really fun .. I also upload music of pleasure to the public give me your comment to see if I have or not future I'm not selling it cheap the first 100 subsc subscribe me! jejejeje ActiVert AdlyDe ...
Interesting change. I like it when artists try new things and I this works👍
The way spells each and every words 😍
The beginning is like buddy holly by weezer and the song is like Green Day
The yeah yeah yeah reminded me of Third Eye Blind, Jumper.
Anyone know what cords they're playing on the chorus?
Fuck him and his shit
This song sounds almost exactly the same as Ashes Remain- On my Own. If you think it sounds like Green Day...you are flat out wrong and need to go listen to Green Day again before posting that shit.
always coming up with that New New
Wait mgk is signed to bad boy??? WTF I THOUGHT IT SHUT DOW in the 90s
Wtf is this nigga sound like an old school boy bad. His name should be machine gun and the Kelly's
You can change music bro... good luck...!
I literally went to school with that girl lol
Some of y'all always forget that MGK is a punk kid and I think it's great how he's incorporating more alternative or pop punk in his music. It makes it a unique combo of rap and punk
awesome bro
Boulevard of broken dreams? 🤔
Nice to see MGK sing 💯
his blue eyes😍💙
My heart hurts :*(
Great video, great expansion

This is so good man!
This dude pissed on camera during an interview. Just saying.
us top videos - are shit
You and those sunglasses! You crack me up. Sending lots of love LP xx
Thank you Lily for speaking so openly, I haven't commented on here before but wanted to let you know I appreciate your honesty. We all have times we we feel low and it's so important to talk about our mental health.
Well done for being yourself. You are actually helping a lot of people. We all feel crap sometimes and talking about it is the key. In fact I prefer watching your vlogs when you are raw and real. I loved it :-)
Try the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - it's incredible.
keep working out Lily.  the endorphins will improve your mental state.  I feel so sluggish when I don't work out. A good jump board session energizes me all day.  Its impossible to not feel better after a workout
Haha I love you and well done for figuring out the rice cooker! Win! I'm a sucker for Lily Pebbles vlogs. My absolute fave vlogger #1 please continue to vlog for the foreseeable future
Lily, I loved this vlog. I fully empathise with you, as I also don't feel all that great these days. I loved how you did lots of small things to cheer your self up a little. Very healthy and nice to watch. Lots of love xxxx
Moany and whingy hmmm. You're human! We go through shit. It's not all rainbows and sprinkles all day errday
Oh lily! I hope you are ok. Everyone goes through these types of moods and phases and I personally think it's good you are being honest and real! That's why I love you! And you don't look pregnant at all. You are right it's the hardest thing when people keep asking you and expecting you to announce something. I find it awful as we are trying to get pregnant with our second child and we struggled so much with our first and had to go through IVF and everytime someone asked me I just wanted to cry. Same as now.... Thank you for showing that you understand it's not easy for everyone and that you are sensitive to this. I'm sorry for you that people keep asking! Oh and I never comment on videos - I just wanted you to know I was thinking of you! X
so naturally pretty lily! thanks for the video x
Try changing your toothpaste. I got a reaction from a strong/ whitening one and my lips haven't been the same since!
Lily i think it's the change of season that's making you feel low. I honestly have been feeling the same very negative and i for sure think it's the winter blues! Love the honesty, after all you are human and can't possibly always be happy in life. Hope you feel better soon xx
Lily I loved this chatty video! Don't ever feel sorry for being your true, authentic self. It's beautiful.
Like you're Vlogs - speaking very well awesome Video
the christophe robin salt scrub is my favorite scrubbing shampoo and it smells amazing! you don't have to worry about getting anything gritty out of your hair because the salt will eventually dissolve under the spray of your shower
p.s. I know when I worked from home, I felt lonely. Maybe an office space shared with others would help?!
Lily, I truly appreciate you being honest about your feelings and conveying your real feelings rather then being superficial. This is especially important with social media constantly showing us how good other people have it....we all feel down at times and it's so refreshing to hear someone else who feels the same way that I do sometimes. Just this Tuesday I was so sad and anxious and I didn't have any reason. Listening to you today made me feel so much better \n❤️
A good scalp scrub is baking soda! It works suuuper well, just make sure you condition afterwards. Gets rid of flakes and product buildup.
Umm... why is this on the trending page?
I'm sorry you don't feel up to par. We all have these days. Maybe we all tend to be this way, too, but I find you complain an awful lot sometimes. There's nothing wrong with it. Just my opinion.
I rarely ever post messages but am a regular viewer. We all have crap days but the majority of us don't have to explain ourselves to others. I can only imagine how hard it is to feel like shit in front of thousands of viewers. I love watching your channel because you're a normal person with real emotions. Just keep doing you. You don't need to explain yourself to anyone. It's human to have feelings.  Much love!
You're lovely, that's all I have to say!
Lily, if you can get your hands on the Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm, I HIGHLY recommend it for dry, chapped, and sore lips. The Shea and Mint version is my personal favorite and the only balm I use, especially during the winter months (and I live in Michigan, which is equivalent to Canadian cold all the time).
I like this :) as lots of people have said it's refreshing to be honest about how you're feeling and ironically it can be pretty depressing watching everyone be so cheerful all the time and leaving out the bad parts. So yeh just as happy to watch this as much as your other videos. P.s just realised I've  been watching your videos for 2 years now! Be they positive or negative! Happy Anniversary :P x
Hey Mandi! I got last year on the US  ASOS site, had to check daily for a while . Good luck!
Completely agree it's so inappropriate to ask someone if they are pregnant.  It's a real bug bear of mine!  Have you seen the doctor about your lips? They could prescribe a steroid cream, and I'd ask them to check for contact dermatitis. Apologies if you have already done this - I know it's annoyingly when people give advice I just really feel for you, they look so sore!
Doesn't everyone have crap days? It's only normal, nobodies life is perfect and to be honest I applaud and respect you more lily as you are real. It's refreshing to see as you don't find that with online personalities, I'd much rather watch a vlog like this on the odd occasion rather than a 'designer handbag haul etc' cause it makes you more relatable xx
sorry to hear you're feeling out of sorts but at the same time it's so lovely to hear someone be so honest! xx
You're amazing. Don't you worry about a thing, gal !!!!!
Lovely vid! Your so down to earth, and genuine! Love your vids! ❤️❤️ Xx
Personally, I find you so much more 'real' than other youtubers. I don't mind the ranting, or grumbling, it's really refreshing actually! Keep on being you, that's why we like you! Your videos are almost like hanging out and catching up with a friend, with bits of travel, makeup, and fashion thrown in. Also total side note, as a fellow curly-haired girl I know you love your hair straight, but I'm so curious so see what it would be like styled with a good curling mousse or gel!
Felt inspired to comment after your instagram story, as I never do! I always come back to your channel purely because you're not sickly sweet or squeaky, but relaxing, straight talkin and a real person! Keep it up!
Do you know what Lily I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this video, it was so refreshing and real. I feel nowadays people try so hard to feel/look happy...You can only appreciate and value actual happiness when you've gone through the lows. There will be sunny days as well as the rainy grey days it's all a big cycle aka the growth of nature. Ok I've rambled...a Turkish Glaswegian 🙏🏻 xx
Your cute. Keep uploading! I subscribed.
Love that you addressed the haters and those saying you're pregnant. I think you look.....beautiful. :-)
Lily where is your black jumper from? I love it x
The best way to get rid of fruit flies is a few drops of dish soap, a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, and water in small bowls and jars near where the fruit flies are. Close all of your windows. Leave the flat for the day and come home to no fruit flies :)
You rock! Thanks for being honest and normal. Hope the dark cloud has passed.
If you put some apple cider vinegar in the bottom of a jar with a funnel on top, it's an amazing fruit fly catcher :)
I really like your long chatty vlogs Lily ! I find them so relaxing and i usually watch them when i have my coffee. Hope you are feeling better!
Such a shame that other women perpetrate this myth that we as women have to be pregnant as soon as we marry. Can women not be happy and fulfilled without children? You do you lily, moany and all xxxxxxxx
Lily, you are a person, not a youtube actor. Keep it real always and be yourself with your happy and not so happy moments. I am thankful that I can watch your channel and that you do such a good job. Sadness and anger are feelings just like others and we should just feel them and not fight them.
Hey Lily! I'm one of your more silent viewers who usually don't comment, but I just wanted to write to you now and say how much I enjoy you content, on both youtube and instagram. I actually think one of the main reasons you're my favorite youtuber is that you always seem so genuine, kind, humble and grounded. In the things you put up it really feels like you show it how it is, and that's why you're such a likable person. When someone can dare to show themselves like that, that's when you feel like you can connect and relate to that person :)  People will always comment stupid shit due to ignorance, jealousy or lack of engagement in their own lives, and that's sad really. When I'm faced with something rude or mean I usually try to think about what is it within this person that makes him/her feel the need to say/do this? and then it's easier to not only know but actually feel that the problem lies with them. Anyway, you're awesome! Hope to run in to you next time you visit Stockholm! ;)
Lily I think you are awesome, you look great and are very relatable! Hope you feel better x
For lips you could try the Arden 8h lip balm. Or a cheaper alternative would be the nivea (or labello) lip butter. Helps my lips survive winter.
Lily try bepanthen for your lips!! even though its a nappy cream for babies, it works wonders for me Xx
Hey Lily, I watch all of your videos but Ι hardly ever comment. I watch your video last night but came here again today after watching your insta story about how happy these comments make you feel. I like your vlogs because they are so genuine. Life is not all about hauls and travelling and fancy events, sure they are nice to watch but it is even nicer to watch that you have a normal life like most of us. I wish you find your motivation soon!
It's funny that we all compare ourselves to other people, and even you do it (as you said), but don't worry about that, Lily! I know i certainly don't compare you to others, i just get home from work and watch your videos as if you were my friend...a real human being!
Loveyou Lily. I love how relatable this is, this is me on a day to day, and honestly sometimes its good to show the world life isn't AMAZING all the time, life naturally has ups and downs, its what makes the ups feel worth it, so it is 100% normal to not feel yourself, and please don't let peoples shitty comments get you down! I love that you are sharing it! :) \n\nAs for the Apple update, I have the same feelings on the new iPhone, just a bit MEH. I'm sure I will want the next one, once they realise the bugs in the face thing - which lets face it there will be bugs! But I am so excited for the apple watch. I have wanted one but just couldn't see the justification in it, but I think now is the time to go for it. I love how I could go out, go to the park with my son, and not need to worry about my handbag and purse etc... it's just fab! \n\nSorry - I'm rambling now, crazy lady in the comment section, but thought i would say hi - as I watch all your videos and rarely comment - but I thought with your mood it might brighten your day to know your not alone, social media jobs can be so lonely, despite the social aspect :) All my love! :)
You are so sincere and genuine - love your channel X
I can't believe people make those pregnant comments! In the hundreds, no less. How bloody rude....
I am feeling the same exact way you are at the moment... so good to see someone else struggling as well, as weird as that sounds. Makes me feel less alone.
my wedding is the same day like yours! 9 days to go! fun fact -  I commented the same last year and I feel it was minute ago! happy anniversary L&R!
Id rather much here someone be honest and true about their feelings, than now that they are being silent to keep me from being uncomfortable/worried/etc. That does a disservice to the person who is experiencing those emotions, and deserves to work through it. And the act of speaking can be so therapeutic in a sense. Considering vlogging and youtube make up a big portion of your life, talking about how sad or shitty you might be feeling is only natural and in my personal opinion it adds to your content and makes me connect better to you.
Currently feeling the same about my work. Really appreciate that you share this and glad to know I'm not the only one! Keep going!
Lily, have you spoken to anyone about depression? Or thought about a change of career? It might help. You've been down for a good while and your life looks INCREDIBLY lonely, just rambling away in your flat alone. Isolation (as shown by how excessively happy you were to see the courier) isn't great for an extrovert like you. In any event, please don't hide how you're feeling - we go through hard times and being honest about yours can help others as they go through their own. x
Hi Lily, sorry if this feels very obvious to you but personally my lips get very sore  and red when I get slightly dehydrated. I know you obviously have other allergy/skin issues as well, but perhaps it is worth checking whether you're getiing your 8 glasses? Maybe that can help you alleviate some of the symptoms. Anyway hope it gets better soon!
It's just so odd that you have to explain to people that it's rude and in some cases insensitive to ask you if you're pregnant. I mean, really? How do they not know that? So ridiculous.
Lily i have the same issue with my lips. Small blisters come up around the edges and ive found the Malin and Goetz lip moisturiser really helps. Before Id only be able to use vaseline but i know its not great to use that all the time. i find the m&g lip balm much more moisturising!
Lily I would definitely recommend using the Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour cream for your dry lips! Works amazing! Xx
Feeling down once in a while is normal ongoing feeling of being down is a sign of depression.  Please just go to your doctors and talk about how you are feeling.  There is a lot of ways to get you feeling better.  I love your videos and would never say anything negative but I am concerned about you.  There is nothing wrong with getting a little help when life gets you down.
Hey Lily, I really like that you don't try to be extra happy in your videos. I think it just shows how genuine you are. I am not following many youtubers anymore as sometimes I am just annoyed by this happyness overload. I guess that sounds horrible (how can someone be annoyed of people who are happy) but sometimes you just want to know that you are not alone with your frustrations and negativity and that genuine people share these emotions. So I hope you feel better soon. All the best!!
Speaking as someone who has dealt with infertility and miscarriage, pregnancy comments are rude and demoralizing. Don't do it ever.
Your not alone Lily xxx I call that stage my moochie season.... I'm not depressed or riding high.... I'm mooching xxxx your in a moochie season xxxx between summer and autumn xxx
I appreciate that you are honest.  Life isn't always perfect even when there's nothing wrong.  I feel your honest vlogs make you seem more realistic because honestly, no one can always be up
Lily try to use Homeoplasmine for your sore lips.Many of models recommend that.
Lily,  love that pink sweater (jumper). Do you mind letting me know. I really want to get it. Thanks xx\nOh nevermind I heard you just say where you got it from
You don't look pregnant
Your videos are the perfect combination of an escape from a hectic day and someone that I can so relate to. Been such a fan for so long and hope whatever has you down gets better!
Really encouraging video; although you may not even realise it! We all have times like this when everything is a bit 'meh' so it's nice to see! Made my feel a little better about my week!x
Thanks for sharing your downside too, glad to know I'm not alone in this! Hope you feel better soon! And then perhaps share how you get yourself out of the rut? hang in there! 💪🏼
I think there's a big difference between actually struggling with being down and just being a negative and unappreciative person.  It's ok to not be ok and spread that message <3
I know people might give you grief for 'being negative' but I honestly find it refreshing that you are just yourself. We all have bad and good days. I suffer with chronic pain but sometimes that isn't the reason for my bad mood and honestly, it's kind of nice to hear that others are just sometimes not feeling fantastic just because they are human! Sure, it might get you in a better mood to watch people that are all happy but I can also get a little annoyed if I sense it's totally fake :P or that it's just happy happy all the time, like who is that happy constantly? Haha. You seem more genuine just being yourself. I don't comment very often and I'll try to be better at it, but like I saw on your Instagram, most of your viewers don't even comment. So don't be discouraged by those that spew negative stuff, as we know with reviews one is much more likely to write one if you are upset with a product or hotel, than if it was fantastic. I also sit alone at home writing my thesis, and I think it doesn't always help with my mood but it can also be difficult to 'get out'.
I love watching your blogs, you seem so down to earth. The whole pregnant thing is so annoying, I think it could be because you have recently got married, I have been married for 5 years & people are still asking me when I'm going to have babies 😟 also my lips are very dry, sore & flaky, nothing seems to help. I JUST WANT TO WEAR LIPSTICK 😢 anyway hope you feel better soon!
You dnt have to pretend to be happy! I follow you because you are so real and i have grown with you ,so thank you! I cnt imagine feeling the pressure to be happy and portray a happy face:)
Hi Lily! You may want to check your B12 and D3 levels - the dry lips, flaky scalp and overall feeling of dullness, gloom and lethargy could well be attributed to that. Hugs.
I'm sorry you are feeling a little down, but don't ever feel like you need to apologize. You're real! <3
I prefer you keeping it real 👌🏼 if you can keep ticking things of the list whilst you're feeling a bit crap, it makes you feel heaps better when you come out the other side. They are just feelings, and they will pass! Xx
People are awful I've been asked several times face to face if I was pregnant when I wasn't just because I get a bit puffy when I have my period.
It's okay to not feel okay. We are humans. Just be yourself ;*
La Roche Posay has amazing products for irritated-distress skin. Cicaplast is amazing. xx from Montreal
Fruit flies are like the annoying pest version of glitter that just hangs around forever. Really hate them!\n\nI've also been feeling down for no reason, it's such a rotten feeling, i hope it gets better for you soon <3\n\nAlso I'm 29 and in a long term relationship and I'm fat and the pregnancy thing is SO HURTFUL and annoying and just so bloody not anyones business, feeling ya on that- it wears you down, almost like human emotional erosion!
Always curious, which car do you drive?
Hi Lily, I'm a non-commenter on your videos but I have been watching them for so many years now that I can say we've almost grown up together! What I can say is that it's totally normal to have down moments, I do have them too. I even stop watching youtube videos during those moments because I feel I can't really relate to the magic life of bloggers... But we are all human and wether you're happy or negative (as you call it) I always always take the time to enjoy one of your videos, even if I have a 1year old hanging around, not leaving much time for myself anymore XD happy week end Lily! xoxo from Italy
Really enjoyed this vlog. I never mind when you're sad or complaining in your videos. :)
I appreciate your realness Lily. Your energy really came through, and we all have days like this. I've also had a crappy feeling week, and i like that you vlogged anyway and didn't try to force the excitement. Personally i don't like watching people who seem to be on cloud 9 all the time, that stuff messes with your mind and you can give in to feeling like your own life is crappy cz it's not on go all the time. Feel free to be honest always, your followers won't mind. I really like your personality, all sides that you share, and no fluff, but i think you're cooler than most. xxx
Hi Lily - I have watched yours and Anna's videos for years and absolutely love them but never comment. They are sometimes the highlight of my day. I don't understand why people post negative comments or try to tell you what to do, thats surely not the point of it all. I loved this video and the honesty of it, think we all go through bits like this where you just feel flat and then things pick up again. Keep posting the videos- I love them!
The pregnancy thing is annoying as a lot of people struggle to have children and with people constantly asking it just makes the person feel worse. Glad you had your say and stood up for yourself. Keep up the awesome work and I hope you feel yourself again soon x
Really appreciate the honesty of this vlog...too often on social media people portray the perfect which can be disheartening when you have struggles. Keeping it real shows you are just human that sometimes doesn't feel 100%. Hope you can work through your struggles.
Lily, you don't need to pretend yo be happy all the time. Life is life and it has low and highpoints. Also, sometimes it can be quite exhausting to watch people who are happy all the time so it's nice and more relatable to see someone who actually has real life feelings. Hope you are feeling better by now. :)
I really enjoyed this vlog Lily, I know you've been feeling down so you're a trooper for doing this and I really respect you for keeping it real! X
Been thinking about you lately as you do seem rather down, \nyou remind me of my oldest daughter so much, hope you are feeling better soon, maybe like others have said have a bit of time off, evaluate where you are in life and then decide whats the best thing to do for YOU.\nSending hugs JJ xx
Oops missed my emoji off, curry looked yummy x
Paw paw cream is great for chapped lips 😃
Your vlogs are so enjoyable😊 love them
Great nails!
Hi Lily! I personally have these days too but instead of trying to 'get over it' and be positive, I actually savor the 'bad mood' and dwell in it. But I give myself a deadline to really feel it out and hopefully understand what's causing it. I found that when I try to 'get over it' so quickly, the feeling never goes away and I just get frustrated. We love you either way, we like you for being you, being real, not being happy and 1 mood all the time! x
Hope that you feel better listen to soothing music and meditate and relax darling maybe your doing to much god  bless and  take care of yourself
I definitely don't enjoy watching people that are overly cheery all the time, I would much rather watch someone more real and genuine like you :)
Lily, you are like a friend to us! :) It's normal we get low sometimes, glad you have shared it, so we can help to cheer you up :) It will pass, clearly, you need some time to take care of yourself first. I would recommend doing things that make you happy, simple things for yourself. And be patient with yourself - you will be happy again soon - difficult moments are the ones, when we grow most! <3 x
Norm Macdonald is a genre within himself. There has never been anyone so uniquely able to harness, through sheer tyranny of will, the comedic craft and timing that he exhibits. ---CodyTheKingOfYoutube
My father went to a reverse psychologist and he told him to kill himself. -Norm
Bloody brilliant. Thanks that was amazing
Oh god yeah a long, rambling joke with a weak-ass punchline really conveys his level of genius. I felt that you didn't make a compelling argument in this video.
This video started off with my favorite long form Norm joke, and I knew it was going to be a winner. My only gripe, and it's not a big one, is that chopping up the joke in that way does sort of water down the experience of it. (Although, Conan's frustration with the joke always sort of annoyed me, so editing around that for the most part might be a plus.)
I agree that Norm is absolutely one of the greats and this video was wonderful as usual. However, I don't think your belief that people will be telling his jokes for years to come. No one can retell a Norm joke. A Norm joke requires the timbre and rhythm of the man's voice, the stare he does, the context of punchline over the course of 12 minutes. You can recite Norm lines to each other, but you can't tell Norm jokes to each other.
Subjective much? Comedy is (to me) relatable ( mostly tragic) experience condensed and expressed in a sarcastic manner. I'd beg to differ with you on this one. Love most of your stuff though.
Not funny for me...:(
Norm McDonald is better than George Carlin.
A thousand times yes... The Bob Saget roast was the highest form of cultural commentary. Dude went quantum.
I've been voraciously watching his videos online recently, and have become a big Norm fan. He's seems really under valued in the comedy world, and you know that's true if one of the greats like David Letterman love him. Watching him on Who Wants to be a Millionaire made me realize how much of a facade his dopey Canadian guy personality is, thanks for bringing that up in the video.  I think he really fits in with modern comedy, and was way ahead of his time.
Now I'm hankering for a Stewart Lee video...
I am glad you made this.
I was always rather meh about Norm.  I saw him almost exclusively in SNL Weekend Update, and his style there just didn't hit me.\n\nBut because the light was on? Okay, that is comic genius.  Now I'm going to have to watch his newer standup stuff.
I've been thinking about Norm so much recently! Good timing.
Oh please.  You are absolutely glorifying this man because you like him.  He will not turn into a legend.  I didn't even know his name 'til now.
This is a comic other comics listen to after the show's done: his structuring is phenomenal, and you know that he knows exactly what he's doing - even if you don't think it's funny.  His roast of Bob Saget is one of the funniest things I have ever seen! \n\nBut I can also see where he'd be hit or miss with people: if you weren't familiar with roasts in general or why what he was doing was so funny, then it was just a bunch of old, lame jokes that everyone on the stage was laughing at harder than the people in the audience were.\n\nIf his joke 'misses' for you, it falls with an audible thud; but if it hits it is out of the park.
If you dont know the moth joke is actually Colin Quinns joke. However, everything besides the moth going there and the light being on Norm made up on the spot because Conan had told him that they had another 7 mins. Norm said he didnt have anything to say and Conan just told him to be funny. Norm sure is quick.
tfw you've been watching Norm Macdonald videos for the last 3 months and out of the blue Nerdwriter uploads a video about him.\n\nI feel like I've been studying for a final exam and this is the review before the big moment.
Thank you thank you, I love Norm,  Dirty Work is one of my faves, he had a great sitcom, and you referenced The Prestige!
Best thing about Norm is he honestly does not give a fuck.
God this is disgustingly pretentious but norm is a god
That's Kitchener Leslie's girlfriend!!
One of his better stories is how he was fired from SNL for being un-funny, but required to keep coming to work.
all you did was ruin the moth joke
I'm opening up a movie theater.
I liked the video, and generally like your videos on comedians in particular, especially the one on Craig Ferguson. I think it'd be a good idea to put those into a playlist on your channel and I'd also like to request a video on Mitch Hedberg.
Thank you for highlighting the genius of Norm Macdonald! He's one of my top five favorite comedians.
I see all of this newfound love for Norm Macdonald, and I grew up watching SNL, and the only joke I really remember from him, are his jokes about David Hasselhoff.
I love Norm. Thank you for the wonderful analysis of why he is so appealing as a comic. I have never been eloquent enough to explain it myself. One of my favorite Norm moments is the Bob Saget roast on Comedy Central. He basically deconstructs the entire roast comedy paradigm without ever making his intentions obvious or being self-congratulatory about what he is doing.  Clearly, the other comics on stage understood what he was doing, but you can hear the crickets in the audience at times, and of course, that makes the dais laugh even harder.
Okay, this guy dedicated pointing out how great norm is and then works in a prestige comparison.... did we just become best friends?!
Praise the Lord for a Nerdwriter video about this man and his understated genius.
Norm as burt reynolds was spot on
one of the best!
Could Norm Macdonald be the only practicing Modernist Comedian? In that the way he crafts his jokes and his delivery of them puts maximum emphasis on the crafting and delivery of the joke. Everything about his mannerisms, where he looks , how he deliberately reads from his notecards, makes me fully aware of him BEING a comedian TELLING JOKES. And that is all part of what makes him uniquely him. You're right. He is a comic genius!
Despite the excellent moth joke and his talent for delivering material, after looking at more of his stuff he seems like a bit of dick.
Norm's so good, he even manages to get a laugh from the unflappable Jimmy Fallon.
Norm is so great. I love the dirty johnny joke he told Howard stern promoting his book last year. A fine example of his long jokes https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eWujBTtbuBM
Bill Burr. Just do a video on him next time you cover comedians.
Norm's the best, the rest is just commie gobbledegook.
Possibly the greatest comedian of all time.
I love your videos. No matter what its on I will always find time to watch them. I don't know if you take video suggestions but I personally think that if you make a video on Monty Python it would be amazing. All time comedy greats that revolutionized what comedy was for that time.
And he got beat by... THE BOOSHMAN! #DanishAndOneill #SayNoToDDDs
All I can say is AMEN! Norm is the true hero of the best comedians out there.
My dad told shaggy dog stories when I was growing up all the time. Hardships,
I've been binging on Norm all month, and was so happy to see this video in my sub box :)
Anybody remember him as norm the genie?
Thank for this video! At first I was ashamed to admit that I really liked Norm's movie Dirty Work but your video helped me better articulate my thoughts about how he's a genius 😸
I always respected how Norm never went onto a TV show as a guest and just did smalltalk or sold some project. He always would provide a mini-show, a short routine. You know your going to be entertained - a comic who 'didnt give a fuck' would just come out and have some mildy amusing anecdote or something. In a Norm TV interview, the host's questions are rarely answered, and almost never sincerely, they serve to set up a joke.
This is the first video I liked automatically before watching. Even as I type this it hasn't started yet.
....but 9/11 WAS a national tragedy!!  :D
Norm ahead of his time because his humor is timeless
The moth joke was told to Norm by comedian Colin Quinn. Norm has mentioned it several times. It is also considered a street joke. Meaning, a joke that was created so long ago and said by so many people that attribution isn't possible. Norm obviously modified it for his own purposes, but he didn't originate it.
norm Is the man.  cause the light was on OMG so funny.
I've always really liked some Norms comedy and the way that you constructed the video was really really good thank you very much
His description of owning a dog in his last special is the most spot on thing I've heard.  Lots more to rave about of course, but that's a recent one.
That moth joke was intelligently stupid.
I love how his mannerisms make him seem goofy but then you find out he reads deep sh-t and is actually smart as hell lol.
I didn't actually discover Norm until a few months ago, but he quickly shot up my list of favorite comedians. Having never actually heard of him before then, it's odd seeing him come up in something else that I'm interested in, but it's also awesome.
loved this. Song at the end please mate?
On the other hand... that Albert Fish guy was a real jerk!
That ending song is straight fire
Norm is my favourite person of all time. I'm so, SO happy you did him, and you opened with the legendary Moth Joke! Thank you ever so much!
is it me or does he look and acts like mohammed ali.
Do a video on Mechagamezilla. He's super small but has a similar vibe to norm but with an irish twist.
Who is Andre the Giant?
I love how the video itself is practically like a Norm Mcdonald joke, starting and finishing with the moth joke and intertwining it throughout
you should do bo burnham next
He said that the reason the moth joke got so long is because he ran out of material (as he usually does on talkshows) and had to drag it out over a couple of minutes. Its not genius, it IS rambling. Its very funny though, Norms craft lies in his ability to ramble with fantastic words and timing. He hates when people put more into his comedy than there actually is.
Nerdwriter you should check out the British comedian Stewart Lee
I believe it was Norm who once said that his idea of a perfect joke is one where the setup is the exact same as the punchline and it still makes you laugh.
Norm MacDonald is widely considered to be the greatest standup alive today and one of the all time greats.
Moth joke is my all-time favorite and I think probably 8/10 people I share it with don't really laugh which is as you say is how he is polarizing.
I can't tell if you're brilliant or it's just Norm.
I love that you broke down The News/Shallow Grave, which is my absolute favorite NM bit. Always love your analysis
That shit-eating grin at the very end of the joke, and the video. I love that man.
I did not understand any of those jokes..
this guy sounds like a real jerk
I love Norm Macdonald. I saw some stand up here and there before his SNL days and he was awesome on Weekend Update, IMO. I was sad to see him go. But you're right about him being a barometer for comedy. People either get him or they don't. Most people don't.
If you don't like Norm then I wish death upon your newborn child.
Cutting the Moth Joke bit throughout the video was a really great idea.
Best Norm joke\nhttps://youtu.be/e3Ev38wpX04?t=3958
MoreComics pls!
Holy shit why is norm trending
YYYEEESSS!!!!!!! NORM!!! NORM!!!! NORM!!!!!💓💕❤
e
Norm MacDonald: 9/11\n*Norm starts laughing hysterically*
I! am Christopher WAA-AAAAAlken
Yeah.. no
wassup Nerdwriter army
yeah. whatever.
Lov Norm!
You ar dumb.
How much did he pay you. Be honest. . .
Can you do a video on Craig Ferguson and his role in Late Night television?
Norm is good. Louis C.K does it better.
Norm's comedy very meh for me. It's like laugh-track shows, I know lots of other ppl find it funny, but it just doesn't tickle me funny bone.
Literally never heard about Norm before (so no preconceived notions about him) and, despite your best efforts to give him praise, I still don't find him funny.
This channel is a dumb man's idea of a video essay.
Do Jim Carey's body language
coming soon to an H&M dressing room near you
This remix makes my soul tremble
Thank you Jamie for all the music you make it honestly makes my day 100x better! I love you Jamie, Romy, And Oliver you guys are the best!
Listened to this during his boiler set, truly stunning! Check it out if you haven't already
Where does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\n\nDare me to, dare me to\n\nWhere does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\nYou've got the body, you've got the body
Love that an unassuming Brit who looks like the only party he ever attended was at a chemistry frat cant stop marveling us with the most beautiful electronic music on the planet.
Jamie xx's music makes me want to close my eyes and start dreaming, the man can do no wrong
I've been listening to you guys from the beginning and knew you'd blow up one day!!!! I love and adore your music! It's gotten me through dark times and made the bright times seem infinite! THANK YOU AND NEVER STOP, PLEEEASE!!!!
my head is about to explode from this perfect masterpiece, Jamie xx I fucking love you

Jamie xx can make the already good songs sounds even better. Such a genius!
It shouldn't never end...
i want a jamie remix of EVERY xx song... #dream <3

This makes me wanna go travelling again! 😍😍 amazing
Best song in his reykjavik boiler room set...
If i get it right a clip by Alasdair McLellan is young and beautiful people kissing each other all day long... all the time ? And partying on this one
just realised the logo for the XX is the same as the symbol for nihilism.  gj XX if it was ur intention.
The video is as good as the music
Shit sold out already??? Please make more, the world needs more of this
Can't say I thought I would see dabbing in an xx video 😅
man this is some great editing! mesmerizing to watch! would love to see the editline for this
see you soon, Xx
jamie xx makes me love life.
Heartd Jamie play this on Jamie xx Boiler Room Reykjavík DJ Set, and 2 days later they release it officially. Great!
I´M IN LOVE WITH THE XX!!! <3
I miss being a teenager...
Finally! Best part of his Boiler Room Reykjavik set in my opinion
i liked it BEFORE i heard it ...
1:59 when the beat drop ! GENIUS!
DAMN THIS REMIX IS SO GOOD!!!! Jamie is the best!!!
The time of minute 2 is sublime, awesome thanks

Jamie XX - On Hold (Jamie XX Remix)
I thought the original song was a Jamie xx remix 😂
Is that cheerleader actually Ali Michael?
RIP EDM.
I wonder if this meets Jim's bowl criteria dyiiiing! Hahaha
What Jim wants is a pasta or salad bowl, which both have low sides: http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/food-drink/best-pasta-bowl-marks-and-spencer-habitat-denby-royal-doulton-a7043676.html
What was the mac lipstick colour you where wearing at the event? I NEED!💗
I knew I recognised you the other day on Goodge street! I saw myself at 7:43 in the video in the blue jacket and grey trousers walking the opposite direction to you lol
Ouch! I bet your ankle hurt soo much xx
Ahhhh loved the dress so much on you that I just ordered it straight away! You poor poppet with your ankle, I so felt for you, I hate falling over so totally got that you felt a bit shook up! Hope it was okay after your busy day! X
The focus is really good. Good 🎥
Never knew they personalized Yorkshire tea! My dad works at Taylors of Harrogate and makes those and I never knew, I love Yorkshire tea!
You look beautiful Tan. I hope your ankle feels better. Please look into a plant based diet as you dont need to kill to cook and no life need be taken for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Love your channel, Ive been following you for the last 7 or 8 years. Take care of Jim and Martha. ❤❤❤
Oh no! This has sold out in my size- I wanted to wear this red dress for a bridesmaid dress!
My best friend and I were so happy we were able to meet u.  Love u sooo much 💕😍😘❤️
You look so lovely Tan, that dress is one of the nicest outfits I've seen. When I saw those shoes I thought they looked dangerous, had some similar and did exactly the same last year. Tore ligaments and was hobbling around for weeks , all the way through a holiday in Dubrovnik! You're a trouper for not crying lol and powering through!
How gorgeous you look in that dress!
I was honestly thinking those shoes are so tall, how does she walk in those? Right before Tan fell 🙈
That dress is gorgeous and oh so feminine! 😍
Out of interest, how much tea does the average Brit consume a day and why do they love it so much?
You inspire me so so much, your my hero. You make me so happy every time I watch you, you make me smile. I've been watching you for 2 years now and since I get really stressed and have anxiety I have loved to come home every week excited to watch your videos and have something to look forward to, like a reward. Thank you for just doing what you do, you are amazing and have really helped me get through tough times. 💕🙂
Hope your ankle is better👍✳️👍✳️👍✳️
can u do more what i eat in a day videos i love them !!
Hey Tan, your so inspiring! Thank you die uploading a new video! But when i read the title i that you were going to talk about mentally getting hurt and i would be interested to hear you talk about that! Xx
Love the new Vlog camera! 💗
Omg I'm in your vlog ahhh I'm so happy 😁✨🙌 it was nice to meet you at reserved
Great video! What card holder did you have in your bag? After one and yours looked perfect as it had a zip for change too. Xx
I have the exact kind of bowl you need and bought it in John Lewis.  Eat my pasta and stir-fries in it.  Sorry I can't photograph it - it's in my London flat- but it's white and perfect.  BTW you always look amazing, I love your make-up line and the make-up you're wearing today.  Would that be Woodwinked eyeshadow from MAC?  Lots of love from me Kate xxx, and from my five yo daughter Maya xxx who is your biggest fan and loves baking your cakes ❤
PLEASE tell me where your sunglasses are from!!!! Omg they are to die for.
I JUST LOVED WHEN U SAID MOROCCO; YOU MADE MY DAY TANYA <3  ! LOVE FROM MOROCCO !
Well wishes for your ankle lovely! Try a heat compress.
This hair ages you.....plz have it like before!
10:38 she get's her ankle bruised 😟
What sunglasses did you have on?
I have so much respect for you! I can't believe you did a meet and greet with a sprained ankle! Take care of yourself Tan 😢❤😚
this dress looks AMAZING on you
The red dress is so flattering on you!!!
Love this so much!! Tanya we love youuuu!!!! Check out my new vids xxx
5:20 - I think he's looking for a soup plate then. Love your taste in home ware!  xx
Sounds weird but your teeth urghhh I'm so jealous 😕❤️
The book you held up, Conversations with Friends, is currently on my bedside table. I am just getting into reading it! I bought it in Paris when on a girls vacation with my best friend. Tanya, I hope you enjoy reading it when you get time 😄
I'm already getting excited for Vlogmas. Am I the only one? The shopping in the beginning just gave me the Vlogmas vibe :D
Aww loved this video Tanya! You look stunning in this video
Where did they go for breakfast? Looks stunning!
oh my goodness - seeing a meet and greet like that shows how exhausting it must be! and on a twisted ankle too! you are awesome, tan <3
I love Kate's outfit! Does anyone know where her coat is from? :) x
Coach nude patent loafers would have been comfortable and looked great with your dress.
Oh wow! It's so weird seeing the meet n greet in fast forward!!
Hi Tanya, I'm also an EGYPTIAN and I watch basically ALL of your videos! I'm a huge fan!💕
I can't wait for your Christmas Vlogs!!!!!!!
Hi Tan! Loved your vlog as per! Bit random but I wanted to make a recommendation for shallower bowls if you're still looking for them lol, Sophie Conran has the most beautiful wider, shallower white ridged bowls that are fab for stir fries & pasta etc. Zoë x
Love that red dress. I felt your pain when you fell. I've sprained my ankle twice and it's not fun. Glad yours wasn't that bad
So amazing to see you loving  my national clothing brand 💓
I love your vlogs so much 💜
that must of hurt!
I love all the reserved pieces you picked out! Great vlog <3
Love youre vlogs specaily when there long! So sad for youre enkel but i hope it feels fine soon!:) And i can't wait till vlogmastime this year❤️🎄 And i am watching youre old vlogmas back so cozy^^ xxx
Where is she at the beginning of the video? :)
Bowl recommendation - look at the brand broste Copenhagen. I think it's what Jim is on about.
you looked amazing in this red dress! also, i need to visit the shop and get the leather jacket cause this is EXACTLY what i've been looking for
You are such a lady! The fall looked so painful but you didn't moan and groan about it and went on with what you had to do, which also looked painful because you had to remain standing. Chapeau bas!
YOU MASHED YOUR PEAS??? I've literally never thought of doing that, I'm shoooook 😍😋
Love you and your vlogs!! i've just met you today on broadway in NYC! outside of the converse store! thanks so much for stopping to take a photo with me, you're so sweet!
Your vlogs always make me feel so cosy! Youve always been my favourite vlogger and I cannot wait for your vlogmas!! Xx
Oh god I hope your ankle gets better Tanya. How do you pull off any outfit look hun? lol :) Your makeup looks stunning in this video. Literally cant wait for your book signing next month!! :) x
Hi from Egyptian girl here 🤗😊
I actually love watching your vlogs! I love how chill they are👌🏼
I tore my ligaments and couldn't walk for 6 months witgout support and physio therapy from falling like this. So it is a big deal and im glad u didnt badly hurt yourself. Becareful and hope you feel better. P.S. your edit looks amazing
I think you might have lightly twisted your ankle there Tan. So I think you resting it is probably good, also should have picked up a compression bandage.
Looking so lovely Tanya ❤️
Love your dress! X
Probably a sprain, so if it's really swollen and bruised wrap it and it'll be better in and week or two
Oh my goodness where did you get your sunglasses, they are the exact pair I've been looking for??!
Where are your sunglasses from😍
Tanya, for what it's worth, I think it worked out better that you had to wear your trainers, especially when it came to taking photos with everyone. That SAME thing has happened to me in high heels and, oh my gosh, the pain was terrible! I actually relived it watching this. In fact, I had to look away when you showed the photo when it happened. Glad you're ok!
Don't you just love when people have actual meaningful conversations with you?!?! I think It's the best, love meeting new people.
Hope your foot is feeling better! You look stunning nonetheless💖
I'm literally watching this while eating noodles from the type of bowl you are looking for.
does anyone know where tanya's sunglasses are from at 4:00?
Also, it's a shame you didn't have some converse with you, I think that would have looked really swish
Did You know that Reserved is from Poland?
what is the lipstick your wearing??? ❤
Tan's vlogs are the best <3
To the girl (anyone who knows) at 15.05 where are stripe trousers from? Maybe like so more people can see? Thanks!
I've preordered your book Tanya x
I feel your pain! I fell and sprained my ankle in July and it took ages to heal. Hope you're feeling better already!
OMG!!! I love those glasses!!! Beautiful and they look so amazing on you! xoxox
Hey tan can you do a video showing your Christmas products?? Thank you!! Xx
great vlog love! xo from my channel to your’s <3
I've pre ordered your book and ordered your xmas calendar
Love the new camera xxx
Going to Reserved  tomorrow!

Trending number 2
SECOND ON TRENDING 😇😇😇😇😇💜
My tour tickets came today!!
I wonder if Tanya would ever like my magic...
Does anyone know where Tanya's pyjamas are from?
Does anyone know if Tan's lips are naturally that size or if she has lip injections/something like that?  She has the most beautiful lips and they look extremely natural.
come on guys we need to share his music man... im donno how he's not bigger..
DUA'S VOICE IS SO PERFECT
I want a cover just with dua lipa for this song. She sounds amazing!
Amazing Dua!!!!!!
my TWO BABES TOGETHER OH MY GOD
Her voice is literally the best
DUA LIPA NEEDS MORE RECOGNITION IN THE U.S.!
Dua is killing me 😭🙌❤️ i need this cover on Spotify pleaseee !!! 🔥
she sounds a lot like Andra. especially the beginning..
Can't get enough of this series
Dua's voice is so UGH
That's how you cover Queen Amy Winehouse!!! Amazing!
I wish dua would have done a full cover of this! Cause she sounds exactly like her !!! I just can't 😱😭
Dua is so cute at 2:50
WOW I love Amy and to hear her singing, was heavy, sounds incredible, it was like to be listening Amy alive, again...😢
I've never clicked so fast before
GET THIS ON SPOTIFY PLEASE
Cant stop listening to this holy shit
THEIR VOICESS ARE A BLESSINGG
This is so beautiful. Thank you and we miss you so much Amy
Omg I would like so much to hear Dua covering Back To Black. It would be great :)
Both are awesome they should do something together
Such a tallented girl!!! Love u
This song makes me want to apologize for no reason.
Não pude me conter ao ver dois dos meus favoritos cantando juntos. E uma música da Amy Winehouse!!!!! Fantástico! Dua e Gallant, os melhores!!!!
I N F I N I T E    R E P L A Y S
Só vim pela Dua Lipa é essa canção maravilhosa da Amy Winehouse, Valerie na Voz dela seria um sonho ❤❤❤❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
This is fucking EVERYTHING. I'm in tears
Love love loooooove this cover! Ugh, soooo much soul. Dua Lipa is such a talent, so versatile.\n\n\nRIP to one of my inspirations - Amy Winehouse. I miss your truly raw, honest music. She would've turned 34 today :'(
You should make a cover and artists  collaboration album
Thank you for this. I needed it this morning.
I wish just rita was singing it
Ugh Dua you are amazing !! I had tears rolling down my face, this was the first song I heard from Amy years ago, this was phenomenal
Shes a beautiful young lady I wish she would sing it alone also very mutch talent
Both very talented, but this just makes me miss Amy Winehouse. Nobody came close to her phrasing, tone or emotional connection in pop music. That song as well, with the Ronson arrangement, was so great. This cover unfortunately just makes it sound like any old song.
This is fucking amazing 💕 \nDua is the best
#1 most attractive female on earth imo
OMG SHES THE SWEETEST AND THE MOST TALENTED GIRL IV SEEN
Wow, this was amazing like always. So when he does these videos is it a surprise or does he tell us early who he's planning on preforming with?
I'm ready for a collab
Dua, this gave me shivers. How could you this possibly give Amy vibes? Such a great happy birthday Amy gift! I'm about to cry
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasss! I am so excited, such a great idea to celebrate and commemorate Amy! <3
Love this .... release it pllllleeeaaassseee
I love them both!Hearing them together,singing a duet is such a blessing!
WOW A QUEEN CANT WAIT TO SEE U AGAIN I LOVE YOU YOU LITTLE ANGEL

I LUV THIS YAS
Fackfreakintastic 😭
my ends have been snatched
The best performance
Damn I wish it was Dua lipa on her own. I mean he cool but Dua is perfection.
Would've sounded better if he kept the same pronouns. Men and their fragile masculinity.
too much Louis, not enough J P
Jp is such a know it all
epic drone shots there on top of the rock
The quality of your videos are out of this world. Really appreciate all of the effort you put into them. Love watching these on my 4k tv, feels like im there!
Some of these shots were incredible! That shot of you guys on the edge if that cliff eas simply amazing. Definitely the most breath taking shots on youtube...or that ive seen ANYWHERE in recent memory! Amazing job!
:)
This vídeo was AWESOME!!! Tks Louis!!!
Absolutely amazing footage with the drone!
Awsome drone footage!
Kitten was absolutely adorable! Amazing videos btw
On trending, well done Louis!
listen carefully at 0.36
É muito cara olhando e pouco cara trabalhando (e vocês pensando que somente no Brasil isso acontecia, huh?)
WOW.. that waterfall
Beautiful 🙌🏼
That kitten wasn't sleeping, it was knocked out ! :D
Hopefully you guys bought him a beer or gave him a good tip for his hard work. Next time take turns digging. As a team it could of moved things alot faster even if he said no say no i insist, make sure he knows theres still good folks out there to help.
It's very possible that the driver would not let them help - it's his responsibility to keep the vehicle in good shape and there are always legal rules in these kind of commercial\nSituations as well.
Just wow! A place to visit in the future for sure :)
If you guys need help or a place to sleep in the Netherlands, let me know. Have fun and fly safe.
The self pumping mechanism is so cool
I've learned from experience that it isn't a good Jeep ride unless something goes wrong. 😂 Anyways great vlog again like always.
Louis try having an overall theme for your interviews with everyone (maybe even ask a few of the same questions to each and then edit tgr the result for the documentary) and then wing it from there based on the culture, situation of the day, etc. I think it would make the interviews more entertaining and flow nicer.
Have Louis fly to his gal pal and do some 2 minute uploads if that.
With 20/20 hindsight bolt-on bead-locks would be a good idea on those rims !
I remember when that volcano went off, I was 'stuck' in the Caribbean for 5 days...
Continuing to the top of the glacier without a spare and no water? Pretty ballsy.
Jesus,  at least get a lil dirt under your nails! \nNot cool leaving one man to do all the graft. \n7mins before ya offered oh the airs going in #facepalm
Yay that's my country ❤
How people like RiceGum get 7 mil subs and Louis is on 2 mil is ridiculous, Louis' vlogs are well edited and he does great things for society like charity work and stuff, yet Ricegum just produces absolute aids. Smh.
You guys need to do a tour of Canada. It would be so interesting.
You need to visit the blue lagoon
The whole time I was thinking this would be an epic game of thrones place
What an amazing place! I knew that but these images were something special..
Oh what an adventure, what an adventure..!
Landscape remind me Reunion Islans (without the snow). You should try it!
Love these vlogs Louis! They make me so happy and brighten my day!
stranded in iceland !! Feeling like Jon snow...
Where they going next the Faroe Islands
when the tire came off the car the guy should have put the lifting jack on the side of the car, then he wouldnt have had to do all the digging and it would be much easier to put the tire back in place.
4k takes to long to upload ...1080 is fine ..upload the 4k versions after the trip is done
Helge is The Man! 💪👈✅
JD adding his what I would do input was pretty useless as no one was helping the dude.
no chains or spare or just in case emergency gear??? Wow...they need to review safety policy! ...or do they have one?😨😲😱
tune 9:00 - 11:00 ? so lush
Most loneliest?!!!!
Wow - Louis your drone shots are stunning !
SELASSIE ARMY!!!
Awesome video, thank you for sharing.
best vlogging on youtube now
Cmon Louis u still using clever clickbaits
The drone sequence starting at 9:00 is 🔥👌✌👍👊.
Epic scenery
Sweet ride
Iceland 🏕🚀
Those drone shots 👌🏼
❤🖕 bro...Keep it up...
Guy breaks his back changing the tire and JP just comments he could have done it much easier. Terrible attitude.
Hey Louis, I reeeeallly would like to know your exact setup on the wing of your Cessna; what 360cam and mount are you using???
Thanks so much for the footage & edit! Appreciate it very very much!
Apparently they're in Greece at the moment, but the gps has stopped at Austria. I wonder what happened.
The most amazing shots from the drone when you are at the top! Amazing. Amazing. Amazing moment and perfect music to compliment. One of my favourite fun for Louis moments of all time! I have never commented on a video of your before today and I have watched you religiously for about three years. I didn't even subscribe until today- that moment made me actually sign up. What a amazing adventure you are on - can't wait for the whole adventure to unfold! Hannah xx
am I the only one who's scared for the gigantic lens being used on that camera without the tripod mount??
These world flight videos just keep getting better and better Louis!
I honestly don't think the documentary will be as epic as we might think.. It'll be like a really long good vlog
Iceland is actually the coolest place in the world :)
Let's get Louis to 1M!!!
Loui I just curious did u block ur subscribe button , u posting best videos on YouTube still u didn't reached 2m subs, people who posting shi** got more than 10 m .... pls double check your account....🤔🤔
Such awesome scenery. Love the bit of you at the top spreading your arms out
I was told in school iceland is more green and greenland is more ice
That drone footage of the truck was brilliant......I loved that last bit too,,,yeah, were in a bit of a mess here with all the chargers and everything .       Louis,  I would freak out if that was my house,  tidy your stuff up!
There are certainly worse places to get stranded, that part of Iceland is just breath-taking.  I shall be there in 2 weeks, I can't wait.
as always thank you 👏🏼
Looking forward to you flying to the Uk. If you fly over Southport near Liverpool give me a wave.
Didn't hear you pronounce the volcano Eyjafjallajökull :)
Who's down for a Cheeky little coffee with Louis? You can count me in when they arrive in Kern Valley airport!
Wow!  That was an amazing shot of the tire coming off the wheel!  5 psi... That is crazy low, but what a cool vehicle to be traveling up the mountain in!
I would love to take that jeep to work, no more Rush Hour on the A roads lol
why are they wearing tshirts isnt it supposed to be freezing
Getting near to the 2 mil!!
i would have used starter flouid to inflate the tire
When I was in Iceland last year we went on a south coast tour and our guide told us that even though the eruption in 2010 caused so much disruption throughout Europe, Iceland's domestic flights still ran as normal!! mental
the tires were way too flat
Go to South Korea
This is the best series after rickshaw run
loving these videos Louis, even thought they're long, its worth it. try keeping up with the uploads bro ;)
Great vlog! Loved the drone shots high on the ridge! Cool shots of the big waterfall and of the green gorge. Glad you picked up an interview or two.
Hey Louis! I'm loving these series, well done! I have just a little suggestion to put in the beginning of every new vlog a 10sec clip of the important parts of your previews vlog to remind it to us and so we can connect the story.
3 guys watching and laughing while 1 guy who is doing all the work???
1 person working hard, surrounded by 3 narcissistic morons with cameras. Come on - grow up Louis!
That song from the montage is lush.\n\nToo Far Away - Direct.
just how long did it actually take the poor guy to get the tyre back on the rim?
At 9:06 your car looks like it should be remote control!😂
Gosh! So epic! So great! And by the way..so lovely kitten.
I love how JP is just such a no nonsense dude. Louie is all like 'guys, this is serious, we are stranded, that tyre must be really punctured...' and JP just says 'no it's not' and actually tries to help find a solution to the problem.
Loui you sorry a... you should of help that man
That sweet pump's coming -JP
Thought Louis was gonna eat the kitten
What country is this
Instead of helping with digging. Good job, louis. Unsubbed - can't take it anymore.
YOUR BACKGROUND IS EVERYTHING!!😩🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Love your style sam !! \nMay I ask where the white chunky heels are from please ?!
How much does this bitch pay YouTube to be featured every week when she barely scrapes 80k views and only has like 300 comments?
Canne believe this shite trends  nowadays when back in the day a dog humping a fat burd was the video to be seen......how the bar has fallen
Some of my favorite videos from you Sammy ❤️
Lol why was this recommended?
You say 'Adidas' so differently lol. Here in Canada, we say A-Dee-Das
I cannot wait for your winter vlogs in London. Specially Christmas /festive season! Yass
Anyone know where she got her leggings?
I probably wouldn't keep the adidas trousers since you already got the other ones!!
What size did you get the adidas joggers in? I'm usually the same as you but everyones saying they come up small ahhh
I adore hearing you talk about clothing, it's so soothing in a way
Keep the Adidas! You have a great taste when it comes to fashion /styling <3 Kisses from Greece!
Love your Videos and also your Vlogs!!! ❤️❤️❤️ and Yes yes yes autumn/winter trends how to style \nGreetings from Germany 🙂
I've been looking for nice vinyl pants like yours but I couldn't finde any I liked... could you tell me you you got yours from?\n\nBtw love the contrast and the adidas look ;)
Why does Youtube promote your channel so heavily?
Keep Adidas pants! They both are cute💅🏾
Sam I'm more of a midi skirts and dresses kinda wearer, if that's a word 😂 and I'm wondering you could do a video of how to style skirts and dresses. I know it's not a common thing, especially living in LA, but it's very hard to find a flattering way to style them. Please consider 😁
Hi Sam <3 i totally imagine you wearing that red boohoo dress with some tights and some thigh highs just in case it got colder.
I love your style! Now I want to go shopping :)
okay here's what I think: keep the Adidas trousers. I'd even suggest returning the AOS trousers but I feel like you like them too much to do that hhaha. Adidas is good quality, it's the original brand so it always looks good, it's stylish (but be careful with the adidas/heels trend! better wear them with the classic black high heels!) and you can wear them at the gym as well if need be!!! other than that, the polkadot jumpsuit is gorgeous on you!! xx
I love how you styled the Adidas pants!
LOVE the contrast stripe trousers too. They look gorgeous on you! xx
Loved absolutely everything in this haul!! <3 Especially that black denim skirt Just wondering where the grey jumper you styled it with is from? Thank you so much!! xxxx
You are a queen of fast fashion
I loooove your style. Want everything in this video 😍😍
This has given me so much inspiration! Love your fashion videos 😘👍
keep the adidas bottoms, they look so good on you!
Loved this video, so nice to see you buy some new bits and try them on! :) you're so lovely! And those wideleg trousers are so cute on you and the red polka dot dress! Yes to keep the adidas pants and yesss to a trends how to wear them video! :D
Loved the Top Shop jumpsuit on you and the dungrees but not that red spotted dress you don't suit such short lengths .
i finally went to &other stories.. oh ma gaaaad ! love it <3
Your hauls are the absolute greatest ❤️ Love your genuineness, and the beautiful pieces you picked up too!
I really love the Adidas pants on you! <3
I'd say don't keep the adidas and keep the other stories x
Sami you look fab in those adidas trackies, keep them!!
Can I ask when the indie and Valentina are going to back in stock? 😍
I love your hauls so much! They're so calming and fun and you can tell that you really think about how new items will fit into your wardrobe
You're so pretty! Love your style 💕
Literally want everything you showed!! Especially the topshop jumpsuit and the denim skirt!!! Its my fave season as well!! Xxx
how tall are you, Samantha Maria
That red polka dot dress is stunning😍😍😍😍
Love you gorgeous girl! ❤️ Your sense of style is spot on!
I can't even tell you how much I love you with curly hair!!!!! It looks so great on you, and that Realization Par dupe is so spot on 👀
YAAS, do that trends-video please!😍 can you do more lookbooks as well? I miss them🙂
I love the black denim skirt. Looks SUPERB on you. I also LOVE the blouse you are wearing. It's crazy to me how much H&M have stepped up their game as of late. Just a year ago there was NOTHING I wanted to buy from them. 
I really like the Adidas bottoms over the AOS stories ones, however you'll prob get more wear out of those ones as the joggers look beat with heels.. & who wears heels that often (not this mama anyway lol)
I love how you make trends completely 'yours'. Everything looks completely different on you, in the best way possible. I love and admire that! :)xX
I love your fashion videos so much aand how u always share your honest thoughts on pieces. Please make more autumn/winter videos. I moved from Greece to Sweden and i'm really not used to dressing for this weather, so some advice on how not to look like a potato bag would be much appreciated! Looking great as always Sammi xX
keep the adidas! It looks great on you
Where is ur black leather jacket from which u tried on with those adidas track pants?!? I luv it soo much!! I luv ur style ur stunning:) xxxx
love the red polka dot but its a bit short
This is my favourite Sammi! :D I know it sounds weird AF but I mean in clothing... I feel like a/w season always boosts your confidence in clothing and I ADORE IT. Keep all the pieces, they look fab on you. xo
I always get a WOW moment when I see you with large earrings haha just because I'm not used to it. So gorgeous
Hey sammy will you do Balmain X L'oreal lipstick review.
Too cute.
Keep the Adidas
keep the Adidas bottom.
Why don't you keep the adidas pants to wear casually like when youre going to run errands or walking your dog or something...i always thought those adidas pants were for days when you want to be casual but cool.
I'm not one for trends but I love athleisure. I've been obsessed with an entire Nike, Adidas, etc. outfit with trainers. I feel stylish but super comfy at the same time.
Keep the adidas!!!!! They look gorgeous:)))
definitely keep adidas trackies sam! so versatile - good for lounging round house, w heels as you've styled and w trainers and crop top on a night out! SUCH a staple. sport luxe is here to stay xxxx
Love this video!\nAnd the Polka dot jump suit looks beautiful on you!
Can somebody please help me! I have a strange body type, I am 5 foot 10 but most of that height is in my torso and my legs are quite stumpy. What stuff can I wear to help my elongate my legs or at least even out the torso to leg ratio. Lol any help is much appreciated!!
OMG please keep the Adidas pants! They are so flattering and versatile! I have them in black red and grey and wear them ALL the time!
Aghhh Sam, now I want everything and I need to save up money as I'm moving in a weeek! 😬
Keep them both i loveeee how they look!
love your videos and ur baby is awesome ❤
Sam keep both...thx you for sharing..eeee i was waiting for you to swatch that Mac lip liner in stone always wanted to get one but not sure its a must have ones. You are getting more beautiful than ever and love the way you talk..and express each items...makes us to try and buy...hahahaha...lovin all the clothes you bought and fashion statements...😄
omg where did u get those super CUTE white heels 😱
Autumn/winter fashion is definitely my favorite too! The colors and layers loooove it so much :) Loove your fashion sense I always get a lot of inspiration from it xx
i've not seen dungarees lately at all
&otherstories pants, definitely!!:)))
Lovely pieces Sammi :)
Can you do a haul of clothes cheaper but still a good style like yours like classy vintage?
Nice haul.
Omg keep the adidas bottoms!! That outfit is 💣 xxx
Keep everything! 😍❤️
Omg I love every piece! Defo keep the Adidas bottoms, the outfit you styled looked so nice! Xxxx
keep the adidas! suits you way better!
also, this is one of my fav hauls you've done! and i've been watching since the  very beginning :)
where are your black leggins from :O they look awesome on you!
Thanks for the video Sam. I liked everything you picked. The only piece that I thought was a bit iffy. It's the red polka dot dress. I would be very incomplete wearing it with that very high wrap in front looks like you could have a wardrobe malfunction at any second. I would even be uncomfortable if I saw someone else wearing it bc you just know her pants will get flashed. I especially loved the jumpsuit and the stripped trousers. 🙂
Sometimes in your hauls you pull a clothing piece out and I'm thinking, idk about that item. But then you show a snippet of the item styled and I'm like, ok, yeah that looks awesome. And it always looks so good on you. You are really good at styling. And you make me want to buy pieces I would never buy. Haha. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, I really love your styling videos and your hauls so keep 'em comin'.
Deffo keep the joggers! X
i loove the adidas pants
Kinda random but I love your arm chair in your try on shots. WHere is it from????
Yes please give us autumn 🍂 winter ❄️ trends.
the adidas pants looked amazing on you! Kinda liked them more than the other! :)
You always wear polka dots
Always giving out the best haul ever
Literally liked this video 5 seconds in because I know your vids are always fabuloussssss! LOOL xxx
I love it when you have curly hair! I also love it when you have curly hair with some curly bangs! so pretty <3
Sammi, for me You are IT GIRL
Keep the Adidas so cute.
KEEP THOSE ADIDAS PANTS!! 😍😍
FILM TUBE 💋💋💋
definitely want the trend Vedio!!
sammi loves polka dots since forever. so classic
Omggg, absolutely loved that red dotted dress on you♡
Does anyone know how tall Sammi is? I love that boohoo red polka dot dress but it looks pretty short on her and I'm 5'9 so trying to figure out if it would be too short for me.
Didn't Vox do kind of a similar video about the Mona Lisa, and how it only really became famous after it was stolen? Or am I thinking of another channel?
How about The Illiad by Homer?
It is a great book go to hell vox \nI read it in school and I wasn't even in the 🇺🇸
You forgot to mention that Harper Lee was the personal secretary of Truman Capote of _Cold Blood_ fame.
Vox is the real Fake News!!
you have to do one on elvis he is overrated af
I was just reading this book
Never read “To Kill a Mockingbird,” and I’m already a freshman in college.
I wouldn't care what you think.
This video really resonates with #MalcolmGladwell 's research in Outliers.  Timing is a critical factor to success.  A great story was able to become well known, because it was published at a time when cheap manufacturing and mass distribution were possible.
The extent to which it became famous may not be impressive, but does that underrate the book if it's still a masterpiece?
To kill a mockingbird was misleading.\n\n\n\n\nI bought it wanting to learn how to actually kill a mockingbird bird!
You have read this book 6 times, you haven't read those other books ever...so...zero times.  That means To Kill a Mockingbird is  infinite % better, not 600% better than those other books.
6 (times you read this book) is not 600% greater than 0 (times you read the other 8 books)... it is infinitely greater
Tf you read it 6 times for wouldn't you basically have it down by the 3-4 time ?
I can just make a book that talks about how I shoot mocking birds. Should become famous yea?
Because it is a genuinely good book, there you didn't have to make a full video to say that.
To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite book of all time. One of my most memorable teaching moments was being able to read and discuss this book with my 10th and 11th grade English classes. My students for the most part enjoyed it and learned valuable lessons from it. The film is also in my top 5 of favorite films.
Im in 7th grade and I've never read the book
This book is boring as I don't know what... I read it in 9th grade Honors English... I do believe it was the teacher teaching the subject... but I'd fall asleep when we start reading... I wasn't much into it... in fact I'm not into any language class...
I grabbed my copy when I saw the video!
More than anything this book taught me how to build a negro snowman. For that, I am beyond grateful.
Thank you Ms. Kim the best teacher I ever had!!!!!!
I killed one cause it called me a smelly bum bum head
I have never heard of or read the book before
I think you read it to much that's why you think it's overrated
I read that purple copy a thousand times in school and that book was in every library at school?
Am I the only college bound student who hasn't read it?
What if I told you To Kill A Mockingbird was overrated? You'd be wrong.
Vox:  Im 14 and this is deep.     Really?  A whole new show dedicated to hipster pop culture is overrated  ?   LOL
Awesome book. Not as good as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn imo, but let me explain why I compare them;\nObviously Lee's first draft was Go Set a Watchman, but that didn't have the flare, potential, and raw development of pure child innocence. In TKAM, she really expressed how our eyes and minds evolve and though we remain in the same environment with the same people, we are seeing different things, or the same things with an inverted view. In ATGIB, Betty Smith does the same, but it's a longer book and I personally think more sophisticated. I think it's *meant* for an adult to walk in the shoes of the child they are reading about and the one they once were. It's longer, covers a longer time period, and in that sense, covers a greater range of development. Also, I liked Francie better than Scout. Francie was very self aware and paved her own path by being the oldest, opposed to Jem being Scout's senior. I greatly recommend everyone reads both *at least* once but I liked Betty Smith better.
yet some new paperback books cost like 20+ $?????
I'm reading this for school. Annotating it ruined the goodness of it\nWe're reading it to learn about justice and whatever because of mock trial
Do Of Mice and Men next please
To understand why _____ you need to understand ________ every single Vox video ever
Ford made quality cars affordable for everyone. Does that mean cars are overrated because most people have one now? Maybe the car was just an awesome invention that Ford made accessable to everyone and Mockingbird was an awesome book that paperbacks made accessable to everyone including students
He should have practiced his pronuncation of el dorado, but great video!
I hated this book when I had to read it in high school
I'm new to teaching middle school/ high school English. To Kill a Mockingbird is actually going out of fashion. It used to be thought as the only book in the literary cannon that dealt with race (that and Huck Finn). Slowly teachers are learning that there are other, better books that students can connect with.
Do Catcher in the Rye please. I read it in college on my own time, and it was the worst book I have ever read. I don't get why it's a classic.
To Kill a Mockingbird is my favorite book
I suspect it's popular because the government school system pushed it on kids as propaganda to shape their morals .
can you do the lord of the flies?
It's not overrated, but it is over assigned as homework.
I never had to read this in school
(5:07) Do I sense a hint of an exodus to Facebook? (shudder)
Pretty sure this book isn't in the Australian curriculum, but it was popular and well known enough that I sought it out to read when in about year 8....I enjoyed it, although I didn't understand a lot of it!!
To kill a mocking bird and the hatchet were basically the only two books I read in school
I think you moved six times and read the book in different curriculums.
My life is a lie
It’s famous because mindless, bureaucratic high-school teachers are told that the book is iconic, so they conform to their script by telling students to adore it. Therefore, your average sheep in society claims that they love To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1984, Le Mis, Mozart, Shakespeare, black-and-white cinema, traditional print and etc. Why do many individuals adamantly defend the quality of all these particular items, as they know little to nothing about these said topics? It is because, once something is old enough, no one can ever question its greatness. If you want to try to come across as intelligent, when you’re really not, become a sycophant; then, you can recite all the traditional works of art your teachers spoon-feed you; thus, allowing you to come across as a blind buffoon acting as intelligent. Why bother actually looking into traditional media, having actual exposure while developing an understanding, when one can simply say they respect it by reciting what their told in school? Also, dismiss any modern artists/material, pretending to have respect for the classical titles that you have never devoted the time or energy to see, hear or read -- opt out of seeing Dunkirk or Logan Lucky, chose to see the latest Happy Madison production, laugh at all the jokes while claiming the film was awesome, but claim to have deep respect for Alfred Hitchcock films they have never scene; furthermore, being some cad millennial who reads garbage like Twilight and listening to trash like Beiber. When I was younger we had more less anti-social video games as opposed to the online garbage that these VEGAN, HIPSTER, PC, SJW, TREND STARTING, INTERNET ABUSING, RALLY ATTENDING, TABLET USING, SOCIAL MEDIA LOVING, EMOJI SUBMITTING, SELFIE TAKING, SAFE-SPACE INHABITING, NON FAT-SHAMING, PRO CHOICING, GLUTEN FREE CONSUMING, CONFORMING TO NONCONFORMING, CUCKTARIANS LIKE TO SHOVE DOWN OUR THROATS!!! \n\n\n\nP.S. life sucks and I hate people >:(\n\n\n\nP.P.S  I wish you would just shut the heck and get out of my life, god...\n\n\n\nP.P.P.S I need aspirin.
It's still a GREAT book
so its famous because it was good, was released in the early 60s, and was featured in the New York Times? uh...cant those things be said for just about EVERY good book released in the early 60s? yet most of them fell into obscurity. your logic is not logical...its famous because its a great book, lol.
Never read it. I've heard of it, but NEVER read it.
I have had to read this book 2 times for school so far and I'm glad someone else feels this way about it.
I got sum ideas for the series: JFK, El Che, Gandhi, Reagan, the Catholic church, etc
It's a good book but it also caught the politics of the times. It had a liberal heart, and people who buy literature are overwhelmingly liberal. if it had had the same literary qualities but had a pro-segregationist bias it would never have made it into print.
I'm not convinced by this. Sure, TKAMB may have been in the right place at the right time to take advantage of mass production, but that says nothing about its merit at a literary work. Not to mention, the video is silent on the matter of the book's actual content and why it is so iconic.\nThe premise that just because one person read this book 6 times and then equating that to it being 600% better than other books is not only anecdotal, but pretty rediculous.\nI'm all for reevaluation, but Vox needs to come up with better reasons as to something being overrated other than, I had to read it a lot and there are so many copies.
Never read it but it seems like a book made for English class
I would give this format a chance.\nSecond look at things is a guilty pleasure. Revisionist History by M Gladwell taught me that.
I should actually be reading this book right now for English ....
To Kill A Mockingbird is AWEFUL
Vox is overated
Next: Vox is overrated.
Disney / marvel movies are overrated
Clear right propaganda
Vox the sjw channel
Fake news
They made Atticus say Calpurina's dialog? 😡😡
can beyonce be next?
let me explain
It's a Wonderful Life has an interesting story on how it became  a Christmas classic. Not because it was well received but because it went into the public domain, giving networks a free movie to air. Obviously, there's more to the story,  but that's the basic idea.
I am sorry I didn't even knew this book existed haha... what is is about?
I bought it a few weeks ago, I don't think it's overrated at all. Was a great book.
Wanna talk overrated? The Great Gatsby is pure trash, yet somehow all the schools love it...
I stopped at overrated and instantly downvoted this. This is one of the best books written in (semi)modern times. To even pretend otherwise is moronic. Between the hillary pandering and moronic titles like this video i have zero respect for anything vox says.
That's like saying JFK wasn't a good president. It's just that T.V. became a thing. Uh no it's a good book It's Harper lee that sux.
I ordered a box of fishing weights from Amazon and I received To Kill A Mockingbird paperback instead O.o
I might the the only person not to read that book in school or ever.
In high school my classes didnt cover any classics except for To Kill a Mockingbird and Shakespearean plays. I took it upon myself and ended up reading Fahrenheit 451, Animal Farm, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the flies, 1984, of Mice and Men, and my least favorite Heart of Darkness in my free time. \n\nPersonally I think most of them were overated and hyped up except Animal Farm and 1984. The meanings in them were nice but most of them just bored me out of my mind. Kids today also dont even read, im pretty sure most students just read summaries on snopes and sparknotes nowadays so :/ its a lost art to anaylyze readings unless you really want too.
This book made no sense
What if I told you that to kill a mockingbird is overrated?\nWe beeeeennnnn knewwww bro
I read it once for fun in 4th grade. - bulllllllshhhhhhiiiiiiiiitttttttt
I have the read this book for school, and it makes absolutely no sense..
The schools I've been in never had us read To Kill a Mockingbird.
In Belgium (Flanders) the book everybody reads in elementary school is Koning van Katoren.
And Godfather is overrated as well.
I do think To Kill a Mockingbird is an important book, but it's not that good in terms of writing
The way you brought up the Pulitzer Prize, I thought you were gonna say it was a fluke year like the book was actually garbage and is acclaimed for no reason
This book was so boring to read as a kid coz we were being forced to read it in school curriculum.
How? I mean white people are so racist and black people are allergic to books, HOW??????
Read the whole book, but wasn't all that great. The child called it by David Pezler is s good book and the whole series.
Please do one on shawshank redemption
My school never required this book, we read The Diary of a Young Girl (Anne Frank)
Do Harry Potter next
PLEASE DO KIM KARDSASHIAN
Its studied in schools all around the world. I'm from UK and did it in secondary school. I think the themes of injustice, prejudice, loss of childhood innocence makes it good to do in school
I don't follow the logic: To Kill A Mocking Bird is overrated because it was a paperback? Because it was published at a time when paperbacks were making its way into schools? What's the logical connection? Penguin has been publishing literary classics like the Odyssey since 1946. Why is 1961 so significant a year? TKAMB's status as a great piece of literature has nothing to do with its first being published as a paperback. It's initial sales number may have, but not its status today.
Way overrated.
Vox is overrated
I remember the ending of that rushed trailer. I thought wtf is that scream when I first saw it
Do game of thrones 6 and 7!!!!
Please do Wonder Woman please!!!!!!
Do The man from nowhere
I enjoyed the film. why MUST every film be some epic 'thing'. and why must critics be such pretentious condescending a-holes? (I'm willing to bet most critics never even saw the film, just based their comments on trailer...)
October's fast approaching... Isn't it about time for a Hocus Pocus honest trailer? :)
'Rare' Cruise misfire? Unless you base that solely on BoxOffice no, especially in recent years.

It wasn't scary, felt rushed and any good idea that they had for the story-line? Fizzled out quickly and went blah. Tom was playing a slightly more toned down version of his Knight & Day character Roy Miller and I kept expecting him to say With me? Without me? With me? Without me? half the time. It was a bit too comedic in some ways and that made it feel off to me.

I love honest trailers and your witty and provocative commentary. However, I think it's unfortunate to do an honest trailer on such a bad movie. There are so many lovable and interesting movies to make fun of and celebrate. In most of your honest trailers, it's clear that behind the remorseless bashing... you actually really appreciate the movie. I love the new perspectives you guys offer on those kinds of movies and I thought that was missing in this episode.
Do Stephen kings it.
Not even watched it because I knew it would be exactly like this ahhahaa
Transformers: The Last Knight
Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000) HONEST TRAILER, Please?
I went and saw this in theaters but was very disappointed with it, and when they tried to throw in bits of comedy I actually cringed in my seat.  I think this would have made a really good tv series, but as a movie its lacking a lot.
Can you do an honest trailer for The Lord of the Flies?
Tom Cruise is a younger man? Than who? Someone's grandfather? Maybe, maybe not.
Can they make the new monster movies to be horror movies or let's Guillermo Del Toro take over them.
Younger man indeed. Consider that Russell Crowe is actually two years younger than Tom cruise. :D
Actually it should call  The Cruise because almost mainly the movie is about him rather than The Mummy.
I'd like an Honest take on some classics, such as Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, or Godfather.

Kiera,  you're the sweetest soul ever. This is such a wholesome video.
I think Louis popping by his paintings means that he thinks they're THE SHIT. 😂
Aww, Louis is such an artist!
Lol, white women took that feminist propaganda so hard that they're raising rat babies rather than real children.
Kiera- I need to thank you so so so much for this video. 1)i love rats 2) your painting was so good so so nice. This idea made me tear up a little, because its so much more than a picture. It's something ur little rat touched and made. I will do this with my pets. <3
I misread this as painting WITH ratson, idea for better video
Beautiful! Loved this idea! Makes me want to do this with my corgi.
I love this so much, ratties are such beautiful little creatures, and it's wonderful to see I'm not the only one who's a crazy rat mumma! So adorable ❤️
Maybe just test out the non toxic paints before you subject Lou to it haha. Test it on the paper you intend to use and nail polishes or other clear preservatives over top to see if it holds. (I never think of this shit before I try new things either) I thought you were going to lay down a cardboard maze with the paper underneath it with a thin layer of paint near the beginning which he would track through. You could make one cardboard maze, rotate it, put a different paint near the start, and even if you didn't get good prints you would have paint scuffles that have an artistic winding to them. \n\nMy personal anecdote related to paw painting: I was in the living room of a rental painting with India ink on the table. I don't even remember what I was drawing! So I finish up, mostly clean up and go take a shower. I never know what to do with the remaining watered down India ink. I'm not going to pour it back in but it seems a waste to toss it. So I left it out on the table. I go into my room after my shower and realize my cat, who never does this, is under my bed. He seems distressed. I realize there's a few India ink paw print tracks in my room and the living room and the table. It made me laugh so much. I managed to clean it all up, except for a blurred par print on the stone of the propane fireplace. So he left his mark there. (And I did get my deposit back). I almost wish he had tracked it over paper so I could have kept it. He also luckily didn't get sick. It was pretty cute to see him ashamed. It was so unusual and so interesting that he seemed to grasp the concept that he did something wrong.
Omg that is such a good idea! I might do that with my kitty, probably have to leave a trail of treats for her to do it but it'd be fun. \nWish we did that for my sister's and my previous pet ratties and miceys. Sadly my sister's eldest rat Jerry passed away this evening :( Lou reminds me alot of him actually, such a cutie pie he was. He's in ratty heaven now with his brother Ben (they was names after the brand Ben & Jerrys icecream).
This is so sweet! Such a lovely idea, I might have to have a go with my pets... although the horse will be rather interesting to do...
I started with a hamster, and I have mice now... but it's gonna have to be ratties next! I love him!!!! <3
This is so precious I'm crying aaaaa it came out so well 😭❤️
This video is so precious! I love it! (^_^)
you are sooooo creative :) you have to get one of your leaf drawings tattooed
That is the cutest bloody thing! 💕
LOVED this video! It was so sweet to see such a special moment between you and Louis. :) Perhaps my favorite video of yours all year! <3
More painting with Louis! I love it
I love all your videos but this is just so cute, it's such an original idea as well 😊❤️
I was just going to add next time maybe just mash up some blueberries and raspberries to use as paints? It would have more of a watercolor effect but could be more effective when drying and safe for little bean to lick himself clean! :D Loved this video and I want to try it with my boys now too <3 xo
I am gonna do this with my rats! 💖🐀
Watching this with my 4 rattos clambering over me. Must try something similar, they're really lovely.
Next time you could try using really well mashed blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, or pomegranates. All of them should be completely safe for him to eat and they stain really well. I've tried painting with them before and would recommend doing a test on paper to see what you like most because the colors will change as they dry. They might stain his fur for a bit though.
Painted by Lou and mum 😭 that is the cutest!!! Xx
I am going to have to do this with my pigeon!
awww this is so sweet!! what a talented little bean! I want to do this with my two girls now :') <3
I'm crying this is so cute!!! You are such a great rattie mum! Staying home to be with him is the sweetest :))))))
This is such a sweet and creative idea! Lou is so adorable, such a sweet little rat 🐀. They look awesome and I love the little card 🌟. Such a cute picture 💖.
This is the most precious thing I've ever seen I would buy these pieces done by a beauty and a bean ❤️
this is the best video i've ever seen
oh my goooooood. i wanna do this with my babies. but they are not as keen on being held without having their feet supported... so cute <3
this is a great idea. not sure my recent boys will like getting painty feet...hmmmm
your rattie art is gorgeous ! i managed to get footprints in that foamy air drying clay that u use for babies handprints of my two g.pig boys Pumpkin and Erik.
Such a cute idea! I wish I were as creative as you are. Would love to have something similar from my dog, Molly ❤️
I love this idea! So cute, I tried doing this with my ratties when they were little using kids paint, it didn't work very well because they were very frantic little beans running about, but kids paint is non-toxic so that might be an option to use if you try again?  🐀❤️
RATTIESSS!\nI love all your videos but your rattie videos are my fave <3
I just saw the 5 seconds that play when you hover over a video and my heart just melted and I exploded in 'AWWWHH's when I saw little bean painting!! <3 now ill actually have to carry on watching!
Try using hair spray over the prints. 😊
Hey Kiera I'm an artist so I thought I'd help. Paint needs a binder to stick, otherwise it will flake off once totally dry (which takes time). If you use just food coloring it will dust off a little, but most of it will actually absorb into the paper (if you are using cheap poreus paper which for this rat friendly project is likely the best idea. If you'd like literal paint, rather then in ink (which food colouring can fall under)  try priming a canvas with chalk based gesso, and making an egg tempera but with food coloring instead of other not so safe to eat pigments!!
I want to try this with my cat and my 3 dogs. Maybe I should put different colours on each one 😍 This is such a bloody wholesome video, I love it so much!
I don't know if my rats will stay still enough for me to stamp them but this is such a great idea! I think I'm gonna try making some pressed flower art with rattie stamps
I love your painting videos they relax me so much :D this is such a cute idea, too! Wish I'd have done something similar with my cat before he passed away, memories are so important! x
Pooing in front of it means he is claiming it as his!  Heehee!
could you make a tutorial on how you make those cards and photoshop and stuff. it looks great. congrats
You could always replace the orange one with a nice close-up pic of Louis ❤
OMG i don't like rats, but your Louie is so cute and sweet 🤗
This is so sweet <3
This was so beautiful Kiera! The green one really did come out so lovely and maybe use a different color next time if you go over the orange one? But you'll approach it how you feel most comfortable doing it and I hope to see it sometime. But either way watching this really helped my mood today. My cycle is in the works so I can get a little bit moody and some days I don't feel like being at work and I feel like napping. But nonetheless this was wonderfully timed and a complete pleasure to watch! Little bean is so talented! Just gets it from his mum ;3
aw now im going to do this with my boys!!! thanks for the idea!
was eating chocolate while he did a little poo, not sure i want it now hahaha. such a cute video though :)
Lou-bean is such a cutie!! He's such a happy guy too 💕
Kiera this was such a beautiful video 😭💚
this is the cutest!! i have two ratties Niko and Taz and i'm definitely getting their paw prints <3
So cute!!! I am getting some art work of my mischief of girls commissioned and I am so excited!
They are beautiful. It is too bad about the flaking off paint but still they are wonderful! <3 I loved watching this video :-)
I did that with my Dumbo Toothpaste! I have it framed now and it's the sweetest memory.
Kiera, try puréed peas and beetroot etc for paint. It wont fade and louis can lick it off! 👅 🐁
Aw I love seeing him in your videos 💕 this was such a cool idea xx
aw yay! i did this with my cat last christmas, you might benefit from a thinner more ink like consistency, with paws i've found less pigment is more. :) very cute bean
I really appreciate the quality of your videos <3
Lou bean you are so talented 💕 maybe you can try non toxic children's paint next time, and just make sure you wash it off before he has a chance to lick it. It'll probably last longer than homemade paint! I might do this with my mousie girl Honey ☺️
what a beautiful idea <3
Aw such a fab idea, it came out really well. Could you try beetroot juice, pomegranate, kale or red cabbage  or maybe use coloured paper and get him to walk through with lemon juice so that is eats away naturally at the paper? (Not sure if those items are safe or not for him though) xxx
this video saved my mental health in more ways than u will ever know :(
You've inspired me to do this with my dog :) I dunno how dunking her paws in paint is gonna go though..
This is so cute!! 😊
You have such a beautiful son.
this looks really great 💕 you're so creative
They're such cute misunderstood animals ❤️
Louie looks like Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle
Adorable, great job!!!!!\n         🐈☮🕉
I used fimo clay (which you can bake) to make my rats paw prints.\nI softened the clay really well (you can get a specific clay softer, but I just used my hands) dunked their feet in flour and 'stamped' them. Really quick and you can turn the prints into a necklace charm!
You're on the trending! This is so cute, I've been waiting for another rat video for ages!💗
aww how cute 😊😁Louie is so adorable !
Oh my god the whole time I just wanted to give Louie kisses and scratches! Such a good lil stamp 😍🐭 I want to try this with my masked dumbo Nugget!
That was such a sweet and wonderful video! Thank you for sharing ❤️
💜💚💜
I love your pint
So adorable!
Your videos always make me smile xx thank you ❤️
I love how you talk to your rats! I've watched all your rat videos, and it's just so funny. You talk to them like they'll talk back, and it's so cute! Haha.
This is so precious omg ❤️❤️❤️
Awww, what a cutie!
Brilliant idea! ❤💚
Tattoo idea: Paw Print ???
Großartige Idee 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Louie is my favourite rat ❤❤💕
Soo cute 😍
Such a cute idea!! <3
did you delete snapchat?
Get ratty paw prints tattoo on you 😍
aww so cute. rats are really underrated pets
Awww this is SO CUTE!!!
She should get some hairless rats😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Nothing against you but, why do you call an animal your son, you know it's not. If you wanna have a son go and make yourself a proper one.
Hi, question: How do you balance mental health with working from home? I recently started working as an artist from home but it's been really hard on my mental health. I have a hard time keeping up with my goals and responsibilities. Do you have any tips for success?\nAt least I've got three ratties as motivation and inspiration :)
I think it would be fine to use a non-toxic paint and pop him straight in the bath afterwards. It's such a sweet idea and such a special thing to have, it's a shame for them to fade away. How old is Louis? He's such a gorgeous boy and looks so young and spry.
Is he a dumbo rat? I LOVE his floppy ears
I hope Louie lives forever! 😘
omg... all of the other rats passed away i am sooo sorry i literally starting sobbing once i heard that i loved ur pet rats sm now i feel bad for always saying more rat videos more rat videos i am so sorryyyy ;((((((((((
I'm so in love man

My family tree has been laid out on my mother's side for generations. Her family came to America from Germany in 1845. When I first got my Ancestry DNA test results, they didn't mention Germany at all! Then I noticed the results were derived from the information they gather about their other customers. So it is rather like going to a fortune teller 🔮 😂
Did she find out that she's white?
YOU WERE FEATURED IN THE APPLE SPECIAL
Emma, how do your parents deal with the disappointment from having to tell their friends - who have daughters that are doctors, or nurses, or teachers, that Emma preaches to kids on YT and then asks then for donations.  Isn't that the same as a scam artist praying on highly influential adolescent minds?
DNA results come in:\nYour ancestry determines you're likely to start a YouTube channel.\n\nP.S. Your test is free if you make a video about this test.
Adult humans are infact not supposed to drink milk by default thus your body wouldn't naturally produce the enzyme to deal with it. However if u've continually drunk it from childhood ur body has retained the production of that enzyme. So when u stop for a prolonged period your body sorta forgets coz it's not a default enzyme for adults ... thus u have trouble with lactose after
My top fave youtubers -including lovely Emma of course- have done these test now I'm really curious about doing my own DNA test. :P
i sent mine off about 2 months ago, bloody place takes age the latest said due to the hurricane your results will be delayed, i used my heritage for it and it was on offer at 69 pounds, cant wait to see what it says, as for yours that a lot of Neanderthal you have and very rare, means mostly your family has bread slowly over the 10s of thousands of year and stayed close to England.
You're an idiot for taking a dna test without truly understanding the implications of the test and its results. There, question answered
Whenever I see you now, I'm just going to think Neanderthal.
Not to be that person but the broadly Northern European could actually be British still. They just can't pin point what the Northern European is. It doesn't necessarily mean Scandinavia but it's possible
I have been watching Youtubers for years, and now I keep up with a lot less than I use to, but I still keep up with Emma Blackery, and Jenna Marbles because those two just do whatever they feel like doing and its so genuine, and satisfying.
She's like the perfect human
You are aware that North Western Europe includes the UK, Germany and France as well, right? Not just Scandinavia?
The moment I subbed: When I predicted that she was going to say: I'm gonna live forever a second before she actually said it :D
You think that's a lot of freckles?\n\n\nI'm ginger.
Emma ! Take care of a good own house, you will need it for a long time
So we have established that Emma is perfect?
Where do you get the spit test thing from? X
I am going to live forever \nHaha 😂😂 we're okay with that
I got I got I got I got black man skin and white man skin inside my DNA
Those are some good genes :D
Can I just say I’ve been here before the shoutout from Apple.
Dna: double helix structure... A phosphate backbone with complementary bases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiology
I didn't know if you give Emma 🥛 she will blow you lol
A lot of freckles...\nEmma: shows a few on her arm.\nMe:  absolutely filled with freckles from down my arms, legs, face and hands.
I'm sure she's had black in her
Enma: Likely to consume more caffeine... Not with my anxiety levels! \nMe: IT'S ME
Not a carrier? Then who brings your groceries places? It's not me, is it? That would be weird if I didn't know that.
That last line will be just dripping with dramatic irony 80-100 years from now.
DNA tests hold as much weight as astrology in science terms. The amount of DNA any individual inherits from relatives just a few steps up their family tree is negligible compared with the vast amount we all share from common ancestors. It means any ancestral history identified by a simple genetic test is just one of dozens of possible interpretations, and to try to trace our lineage directly through our genes is absurd. We are better off conducting our own investigations and creating a family tree to view our history. This kind of DNA testing seems to be heavily promoted at present, but they are fundamentally a scam.
I really love your top
IVE BEEEN WAITING FOR A YOUTUBER TO BE ASHKENAZI JEWISH
mortimer was before boy in a band
Hey, Emma, the asparagus thing isn't about you being able to smell asparagus...it's about your urine smelling weird after eating asparagus.
Are you wearing the same shirt as the last video?
She probably said but where do you do this? I kinda want to find out mine
5:15 sorry Emma, but you are not the first immortal being. There are a few other species on this planet that are biologically immortal, for example: Turritopsis dohrnii, (jellyfish) and Lobsters (Though they could actually die if they fail to molt)
Finding out you have amazing genes then, pretty much, advertised by Apple just after.  What the hell Emma?  What next?  x'D
Welcome to the Scandinavian-Jewish community sister!😄😂\n\nP.S: I'm Scandinavian-Jewish.
Love you Emma I am Swedish
The asparagus thing isn't whether you can smell it, but actually if your PEE smells like asparagus after you eat it. Some people do, some people don't. It's kinda weird.
You are a human
North West Europe normally doesn't include Scandinavia. It usually refers to the area containining France, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and whoever I missed. Scandinavia normally isn't included with that bunch because we're our own kind of (semi-weird) people.
I love her shirt, any ideas where she got it or where I can shop similar styles?
Ive just posted my first ever video... please can someone watch it and let me know what you think? i was very nervous doing it haha
The whole lactose intolerant thing happens because lactose is broken down by an enzyme in your stomach (basically a little thing that makes reactions happen quicker). As humans we are born with this specific enzyme to break down lactose because we have breast milk when we're babies. \nAs we grow older these enzymes are sometimes no longer produced because we should no longer be consuming lactose. That's why people can become intolerant as they get older. \nThis is also why if you don't eat it for a while you body will no longer produce the enzymes so you become intolerant to it
You should watch SmarterEveryDay's video where Detain looks. Bit more at the science of genome sequencing, it was really enjoyable
Why is there #Shook on the title card...
Are you genetically predisposed to being a regressive?
You're 100% bad at interpreting data. Broadly NW European includes British, Irish, French, German, and Scandinavian. Why on Earth would you assume that entire 14% was Scandinavian!? Jesus. You likely have trace amounts of Scandinavian since it seems common among British/Irish folks. I think the Vikings landed on our islands and raped our women.
So funny. I knew seconds before that you were gonna say 'I'm gonna live forever' hahahahaha. You and me both, kid. 😉🙋😏
lol, have you seen this https://youtu.be/1_Ka9uXEEuU i laughed
I have alpha 1 AT deficiency, the third thing down on the list. Lol
Why does Emma keep saying things are odd or creepy it's not guesswork they're literally using science to read your genetics like?
She said people say she sounds Australian. Not at all😂
So basically if a zombie apocalypse breaks out it'll be your blood we'll all need. ....guess now's the best time than ever to ask, are you bloodtype O?
Emma your shirt is so cute!
Lol I am gunna die very early, thanks bad genes, I eat healthy, I jog a lot, but my parents and grandparents have all the shit and I have more shit than they had at my age lololol.
Emma I have a very real question for you... where did you get that top? Please??? You look like a vampire... possibly... IMMORTAL??! \n\nAlso I'm from Essex too! Was born in southend hospital ^-^ thanks for being you, m'dude. You've made me laugh for the past 5 years and I'm so proud of how far you've come.
Is your surname a clue?
OMG, she's going to live forever. Everybody run!
Australians and Brits are the exact same because all Australians were derived from the British people on the First Fleet that arrived in Australia in the 1800's.
Yup, yes I knew it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm Swedish
i very much want to do this, but i'd rather not pay £100
Lmao I didn't know some people couldn't smell asparagus.
She's going to be on the news!!!!!!
I got 61% Eastern European Jewish \n18% Iberian (Portuguese dad) \n12% British (lived in London all my life) \n 2% Irish \n2% African\n1> Caucasian

Celine Tam was very good but against Angelica , very good is not enough
She is one and only angelica hale! Period😣😍

Beautiful song, incredible voice! 10 years old? Unbelievable...i loved Angélica
I LOVE THIS BABY GIRL!
I hope you win :) <3
Aside of her amazing talent that made me amaze is her song choices every song she presented there is a message that she wanted to tell us... Woooowwww phenomenal indeed!!!
Angelica has tge Anericans' favour...1) She is an American...\n2. She has won the simple hearts of the Americans through her sympatative manupilative repeated stories of her long ago kidney transplant and now over the arrival baby sister.....all can see that  Celine was a threat to her...so better be removed to pave way for an American! Unjust!
So clean voice im from philippines proud to be 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Im so happy for Angelica. My votes was worth it.
O M G\neffortless control and technique. Now that's talent!

Yass😍😍😍
She deserves to win
I am streaming Fifth Harmony's He Like That video on my phone while streaming Angelica's performances on my laptop....Harmonizers love you Angelica!
If the first verse didn’t happen it would’ve been a flawless performance. Shame
who agrees that angelica is better than celine
To much screaming
I can't believe this is better than Celine Tam's 😡😡😠
She should sing fireworks by Katy Perry for the finals! The song suits her voice...
Celine Tam is like a pastry chef, everything must be precise and well-calculated for the end product to be perfect while Angelica Hale on the other hand is like a culinary chef, she puts a lot of spices and herbs together and mix it with other ingredient, it might not be perfect but the end product is remarkable and very tasty.
That was her worst performance imo
Light balance is better... She's just another signer
She is good, but sometimes kids with this kind of talent won't keep it as they get older, unfortunately. This is why I didn't really want her to go on..
Gorgeous voice as always...but for the finale, I am truly rooting for her to choose something fun and upbeat. We already know she can crush the soulful ballads, but I absolutely adored Girl on Fire and would love to see her sing something like that again--something to really get the audience fired up. I Want to Dance with Somebody would be exciting!
don't get me wrong she's really good...... but i like darci more........
Celine deserves to be in the finals
Some Pinoys here, mahilig makisakay sa popularity ng iba! That is why Americans are raging about this Filips na nakiki-claim lang! Angelica is 100% American, she was born and was raised in Atlanta, Georgia. This kid wants to give back, America saved her life in near death she had  a kidney transplant. She does not even know Phils is. She is genetically part Filipina, but her father cleared already that the mother has Zero talent in Singing. Pinoys must remember that americans or people in America are the voters, not Pinoys or You tubers outside America.
I would suggest performing preventative maintenance on the sin clock. Dont want that breaking down.
the first alien sown in this (the one who gets saved by the guy slipping) looks very much like a knock off of the predator from Primeval, specifically the baby ones. I call copy right on that!
I love how no one mentioned how gay that flute scene was to the director as they were filming that scene.\n\nGay as in both actually gay, and how stupid it was.
IM SO READY FOR EVERYTHING WRONG WITH IT!!! penny wise got me f'd up
Everything wrong with ip man?
Oram was a waste of a death. He was so stupid that you couldn't even be satisfied/surprised that he died. You were still mad. At least I was.
David's hair was originally brown.
Can you put out a sin video of yourself again and comment on the director shit.
The DUMBEST humans to travel in space. How did they ever evolve to leave the earth.  And they keep making robots. Scientists. Yeah, right.
I can accept a lot of Sin from movies, but the fact that the crew did not take any precautions (respirator at the very least) when stepping onto an alien planet is the biggest. But they brought guns!
Why do you always bleep out the F bomb but you leave in GD. Why not just leave the F bomb in?
SAY: my face is my shield!!!
Can you please do everything wrong with Purple Rain, Under the cherry moon, graffiti bridge...i love prince.
I would have taken sins off for the soundtrack and the back bursting moment when the body flopped to the ground.
Next week: Animated hero sins?\nObviously that's Captain Underpants.
Where do I come from? WHERE DID YA COME FROM? WHERE DID YA GO? WHERE DID YA COME FROM COTTON EYE JOE?

6:00 Indiana Jones and the Giant Wax Boulder\nWell, it couldn't be worse than Crystal Skull!
Do you know someone with cancer, cause I do, many people actually, but personally, my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and since has made a fast recovery, soon to be done with chemotherapy all together, but not all are as lucky. Enter the story of Nikko Worthington, a 13 year old 8th grader at Heritage Middle School in Meridian Idaho. He is everyone's friend and participates in school sports like football, basketball, and even on the wrestling team with me last year. He can make any one of his peers laugh and is an overall amazing kid. I've been through enough years of school with him to know this. Early 2017, Nikko's mother Kristen had been diagnosed with breast cancer and on Valentines Day, two days after her 43rd birthday, she had surgery to remove her tumor and has one and a half years of chemotherapy and five years of medication to get rid of the cancer, but this was only the start for this family. May 2017, four months after his mothers diagnosis, Nikko had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called stage 4 Rhabdomyosarcoma. He has been in treatment since, but every once in a while I can see him in school, still as hopeful and happy as ever. Today, September 14, 2017, I saw Nikko by the front office hugging his mother in his wheelchair while I was eating my lunch, and I knew, they might not be able to do that someday, and I don't want that, nobody does. This morning in PE, our teacher reminded me of his story, one that most students don't even know about, and it was this reminder that drove me to write this comment, and what reinforced it was me seeing Nikko and his mother Kristen today. So, if you want to know more about their story and help them along their tough story, go to this gofundme page https://www.gofundme.com/WorthingtonFamilyHealingFund\n\nNikko, if you see this, remember, it's not always your friends or family who help out in a time of need, it can be just be someone with a heart.\n\nSincerely, River
You guys should do the 1990's IT since there's the new one coming out
anyone waiting for everything wrong with the iron giant? not to hate on the movie, i just thought it would be cool
winx club the secret of the lost kingdom

Can't wait to see the everything wrong with the Emoji movie... the son count would be like 16728383829192883838391837
why does this channel have 7 million. why this channel
Please do everything wrong with 'It' or death note
everyone in the comments is triggered because of cgi, space suits, or the fact that this doesnt have the xenomorph in most of it and thinks its liberal shit for some reason
That's 4 schools you've referenced in this movie. Gotta say, this one really outdid itself.
You guys need to upload more
You didn't mention the part where the crew disobeyed an order to bury the dead captain and the replacement captain was upset about it then next thing you know he disobeys his order and agrees to land on a planet that just happens to be in close proximity
Everything wrong with Life (the Ryan Reynolds movie) and EWW The Return of Xander Cage~
I still liked the movie. I don't think David took form as Walter I think he hacked him
Real question is why does those monitors NEED screensavers😂😂
You're face is parade day. Beware of the Son?
Go and find yourself a fucking job instead of wasting time with such stupid things and publishing bullshits about movies.. fuck your view and all your shit videos!
Please do one on IT
I just saw Hydra. It's a film from 2009, and oho, ho, boy. The CGI snake is worth a few sins on its own for execution, bu wins all the points for being a great movie villain.
EVERYTHING WRONG WITH *IT*\n\nlike if you agree
Can you do a everything wrong video ok saw 3
Everything Wrong With The Book of Eli (2010), please
There was a deleted scene where a xenomorph fought a neomorph which would have made the movie slightly better
Cinema Sins have waxy ears, you heard it here first.
When your horror story only works because the victims are dumb as rocks, you might want to go back to the drawing board.
This guy's an idiot
Everything wrong with The Edge of Seventeen!!
Everything wrong with the emoji movie #1 everything
Sin The Prestige!!!
Y NO THURSDAY EPISODE?
Please do Vanilla Sky
BIG ASS TITTIES!!
Sweet milky android juice... Eww... Lol

Hmmm, an upgrade........
Please do 2017 IT
Finally!
Do wvrything wrong with grabber
hey cinema sins can you do a everything wrong with IT (1990) and after the new IT comes out on dvd can you do one of that? But love your videos keep up the good work
Idk whos David or Walter but did the 10year on planet robot switch with the updated robot or what are you saying? I really dont get the ending
You should sin the new IT movie,if you've watched it,and if you found any sins
Can't wait to see you guys on the Schmoedown.
do a video on flight off the Phoenix
You should really do The Shawshank Redemption. It would be pretty short though.
Have you not done a Cinemasins on the movie 21 with Kevin Spacey? or did I over look it. Also I second McMillians comment about Death Note...sins everywhere. Great channel!
Sin: DON'T TRUST ANDROIDS OR TRUST THE GUY YOU JUST MET LITERALLY A FEW SECONDS AGO ON A DISTANT PLANET!
I would love to see a sins video of The Fugitive. That movie is amazing!
Look at all these survival experts of the unknowns and natural selection because they are the viewers of some colonists that made mistakes because their humans and sometimes they would be confident enough to break away a mission just to explore a planet, and space suits is fucking unneccesary because the spores would enter regardless through a seal or filter, gasmasks neither because it could enter through skin pores, just enjoy the goddamn movie knowing they're human too and thinking the space they are in is less likely to be host of horrifying things.
The part where the white alien that just stands there for a moment and then freaks out was the best thing about this film, more effective than anything. I'm going to pretend I didn't learn that an android basically created the aliens that we are familiar with. The original 4 films were basically about humans trying to control something completely foreign to them that is not theirs to control.
....fuck this movie.
How about Everything Wrong with Megamind?
Still loved it :3
Sins for IT
Where's rogue one? That's the worst film ever
Do it next 👌🏻
How have then not sinned The original IT yet?
Last week and this one there was only one sins video instead of the usual two, is this going to be a permanent thing?
One of the sh*tiest sci-fi franchises...\nWorth only for downloading and then deleting.
Anyone know what happened to Thursday's uploads? That was all I had to look forward too but now apparently they aren't doing it anymore and I have nothing to live for all week
where's the video ??
She kinda looks like the girl in atomic blonde in this, I like it.
GIRL CALL SOMEBODY FOR A VERSE. THESE RECYCLED RAPS 🤔🤔🤔
Wow idk how someone could do a song this terrible and be like, yup, that sounds great, people will love it! SERIOUS DELUSIONS!!!
I hate the fucking woooo! yeahhh!. It's such a well known sample and it kills the lyrics.
I mean, the song isn't amazing. It's a bit generic, but catchy. The video the song together is enough to make me want to add some more squats and scissor-legs to my work out though. Because, ya know.... ass.
Does anyone remember the whole thing when she squeezed a kinder egg out of her minge on stage?
this is what happens when black people live in cold climates where white people come from. they become pale also after enough time living there by old age they are light skinned. look at nicki's pale skin.\n\nalso look at jayz and beyonce, from living in new york each year they get whiter skin, now they got whiter skin that white people almost.
The part where fergie is sing kind of sounds like the beginning part of You know you like it by Alunageorge
This woman samples more than any other artist I've ever seen.
Welcome back Fergie ✨❤️ can't wait to hear that entire album girl! THIS IS A BOP! Slay bish!
What a terrific example to young women.
am not feeling it sounds lame and annoying 😑
I relieve pressure any way I can, Please, don't tempt me
this is legitimately bad, how did it make past quality assurance. do they have that for songs?
Not impressed by this, please give up Fergie.
too many hot bars....where the ghostwriter at 👀
Uh.. I don't know
I started to think that music was actually coming back to normal. Nope. Still shit
does anyone else here You know You like it by AlunaGeorge or is that just me?
why the views is so low??? This song deserves more views!!!
watching it just because of minaj
Her singing sounds like a joke but the rapping is good
You know you like it- Alunageorge
The chorus sounds oddly close to DJ Snake's - You know you like it.... or is it just me???
I'm thick in petite!!! Yassssssssss me too!!!!
If nicki would've started vouging I would've ripped my weave out and ate it
Thanks amillion times Fergie for bringing back your old style of singing back!!! Missed it a lot!!!
Issa no for me dawg. Why is she rappin?
this song is the same as when i get off the toilet and watch down....hmmmm
I honestly can say the best part of the song is 👑🔥Nicki that's the only lit part😕
Reminds me of Scream by Michael and Janet Jackson video
It sounds a bit like You Know You Like It
This is one of those before it's time albums
I don't appreciate the lack of views😐
Damn I love this
Does anyone think that Fergie's rap style (or maybe just the rythm of the rap) is kinda reminiscent of Missy Elliot?
When she uses it takes two in this song and rock that body 🐸☕
Black and white to hide the wrinkles 😁😂😜
Nicki killed this, but it feels like 20 songs in one :(
I have mixed feelings about it.
this is how we DOOWWWE !
And The coons will rush to it, you can't fake swag. Rhythm and blues, soul comes from the core of human experience this bitches just will never deliver. Nice try but never. And this is how we loose that core soul of black music that blacks fail to protect and this fakers think they are the deal. Uh-huh?
nickiminaj❤\nI LOVE YOU MY BARBIE AND MY BABY👅👀\nOF HOUSTON TEXAS👐COME ON  TEXAS HOUSTON👅PLEASE💋
skip to 1:22 thank me later
is it just me or does the video kind of look like a rip off of Cara delevinge's music video with the black and white and the suit thing\nI mean I love the song but it gave me major flashes of Cara's video
the concept is cool, nicki's part is the only part I like. Fergie sounds kinda flat
Shit sucks and y'all know it. This ain't even the REAL.. AUTHENTIC FERG...THIS IS a clone.    Soulless cash cow being
ummmm best part of this song was Nicki :/
rob base is the music for this
The song is crap and even nicki can't improve on crap. Two thumbs down!
To me this song is trash 🚮🚮..I'm not hating just saying
this song needs to be on top of all the charts. sooooo good
Another version of this song leaked where Nicki says I haven't seen meek milli in a week instead of young nicki
THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She's voice sounds raw
YASSSSS FERGIE YOU SLAYING MAH SOUL😍😍😍😍 NICKI & YOU ARE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN🙌🏼
Next time do not leave your computer with your child Fergie! 😂
She should just give it up. All her new music is straight garbage.
Honeslty how much nicki get paid to do this video this song is terrible she's the only thing that makes it halfway decent
it doesn't feel complete
For if you believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ that he shed his blood and died for all your sins on the cross, he was buried and he rose again from death 3 days later by his power then you will be saved and are now are a Born Again Christian and you will go to Heaven forever once you die. Good works will never save you and nothing else will except only by belief in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Once saved, you are always saved forever by faith in the gospel. Ephesians 2:8-9, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 And Romans 3:25- King James Bible. I Love, Thank, Praise, Bless, Exalt, Honor, Delight And Rejoice in all of God, Amen! www.KingJamesBibleOnline.org
Apart from the chorus this sounds kind of like the song you know you like it by Dj snake and Aluna George
Two bitches in one studio
Too basic..people using Nicki to get more views..
THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU LIKE IT!!! DJ SNAKE
i fuckin love this beat
Another flop feature from nicki this year.
Thank God for Nicki Minaj saving this song
also nicki obsessed with the kardashians ..lately
любой русский? :)
Fergie is back!
Love this ❤️
Still better than M.I.L.F. $.
Niki bavk
Love it!!!
damn. nice beat and tone
Fergie bad asl🤤🤤🤤🤤😩😩😩😍😍
Swish swish much?
Nicki 1:23
Her Before 100Milll
Queen nicki
booff fergie  heureusement nicky ;)
I love you fergie😗😗😗
Fire 🔥🔥 Fergie and Nicki killed it!
Me gusta cuando Nicki dice que está chiquita y apretadita (traducción mía) hahahaha
Essa música ja é meu vício 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
YES FERGIE
i dig
Nicki makes every song sound better
That split tho❤
Fergie sounds terrible
I love Nicki Minaj😻💚
I just clicked just to listen to Nicki Minaj
Omg Nicki in a suit 😍
OBSESSED !!!!!
The Dutchess has returned. 😍😍
<3
Díganme qué no soy el único que lleva como 10000 vistas
a nadie más le transmite una vibra me against the music?
She's not trying to sing this song as a power ballad lol the high notes are supposed to sound like this.
looks normal to me
great video guys I loved it <3
Rocket jump: putting a dark twist to an old childhood game
now this is what youtube should be about, need more of these types of video, no drama just film making
RocketJump is a bit late on this trend 😂
Oh look at that their content is back
Why didn't they just use the ladder?
That was great. xD
Oh what up son
You guys still make the best shorts!!!
If the floor was lava, why didn't you get swear to hott
The floor is quality content *
Think about all the no so athletic people who died
The ending though XD
Good to see a more classic rocket jump video
For a second I thought that was egoraptor on the couch
Saw that ending coming from -10 seconds
Near the end I just knew it was gonna end up being a dream for some reason...
To be honest I forgot about this channel until now sorry.
This is amazing, like wow, wasn't expecting this from you guys. I use to watch this channel all the time!  Glad to see your still uploading!
I really like how Brett is just eating marshmallows
This is a free runners wet dream.
hope you weren't carrying any diamonds
This just made my day.
A true viking's death.
This was literally the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life
I really need to play the floor is lava again.
Is it bad that I laughed when he died?
I actually had thoughts about unsubbing but then I saw this. I was actually blown away by how good it was. And weirdly enough, it managed to tug my heartstrings a little, even though they're characters we only know for a few minutes.\n\nThat was an adventure. Thank you, Rocket Jump. You made my day a lot better!
I skipped to the EXACT part of his death and guy sleeping disturbance. That was perfect. Lol
No more shorts *releases good short*
This is the rocket jump we all know and love!
i knew the ending would be like that lol XD
When you mess up the cobblestone generator
If the floor is lava, how are the police cars still working?
I was just about to say if it it real,or fake but then I saw the ending
This actually is my nightmare fuel
Yo when it went back to normal i thought they were gonna be on acid or some shit lol
Love it, my kids play this game
This was a masterwork! Well done!
I'm not even gonna judge this
This was so refreshing to see today. Glad to see content like this hasn't given up on Youtube! Keep up the good work!
this is actually cancer
Y isn't this on the trending charts...smh😐😐
I hear Anikin Skywalker isn't really good at this game.
IT'S OVER ANAKIN, I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND!
College in a nutshell.
This gave me a this is the end vibe
The lava looks like cheese pizza.
1 video per year.... Sovietwomble is better than you guys
An actual funny video, what is this madness!
This was an epic adventure filled with heart wrenching emotions, roommates for life bro.
his left hook just went viral
I cant make it\n\nDude. Theres a ladder RIGHT. THERE
We aren't working on shorts for you guys, we're trying to focus on bigger stuff.
When you release a skit on a meme that died over a month ago(jk I'm actually really happy u guys r still doing skits)
If that was real lava even being that close to lava would burn them
If you were that close to lava, you'd already be dead.
Well I would be 100 percent cooked in an event like that.
In a world...... where the floor as become lava...... three men must survive
is the guy who plays Casey from the old channel balloonshop?
Yessssssssss there back animation is back on YouTube
0:57 different time on clock , too many takes #EXPOSED , xd jk great vid
Rocket Jump back on form! :) Hell Yeah!
Carl's got some niiiice arms
oh what up son
Now that you think about it how long as it been since they have uploaded like this?
Why is this soon entertaining
It's like living with a bunch of kids!! *Good night* NO!!!
why does this give off Zombie Apocalypse vibe
If this channel is still gonna be able to make videos, then it's not dead! Even if your not that patient, go to Corridor!
I wish you guys could see the smile on my face right now. Thank you so much RocketJump. So unexpected after you guys said you were done with shorts, but I just had the greatest laugh... I really hope you still do more even if it's just once a year
Элджил почему еще не перевел роллик?
Lmao
Classic rocketjump gg
That's HOT
wiw si ciik
Ironic
Good night Casey\n\nNO
supernatural awesome
kidualt
Lmao Love it
Finally
3 months too late
Destiny 2 IRL
wow
OMG YESSS
WOAH
Супер!!!!!!!!!!
My eyes hurt.
Calm down
Smiling currently from laughing. Thanks sir
Needs more lava
Outrageous, guys!
This meme is dead
awesome film(:
Aaaaah brings me back😂
4:54 Tardis doors opening sfx.
ok this made me wheeze ngl
The floor is updated meme
You could use poles with three different colours of flag on them to mark the first, second and third circle, different colour for each
He didnt crouch jump through the window. Dislike sorry
would be funnier if you guys put fake streaming vids instead of those images :)
Why am I not surprised D won?
You know what will make this video better? if they started out nothing but underwear and (bra if they are girls) and they have to find the clothes and armor.
should switch it up next time! go paint balling!
adding the in game noise for the guns made this kinda cringey
Wow this was good. That heartless kill tho at 15:00
Why the fuck does the Asian faggot have to fucking win? Can't stand those noodle and dog eating bastards
welp somebody have to made a movie bout PUBG!!
God, is anyone else get really tired of D winning everything?
How the heck does this only have 4K views?
Isn't the music in this video from the Arma 3 soundtrack?
D ends with the clutch
Would have been more accurate if someone died by the wall. I give it a 2/10. :3
This deserves so any views! great video!
stop doing this in real life stuff just play the game its much better
Node have you considered using drone cams instead of running cameramen? Mobile cameramen give away the position of players, right?
I feel like D always wins
the UMP-9 and UMP-45 are different guns... -_-
Hey can you tell brain Exploder/ Mark to put his gopro products on Amazon or something like SSAIRSOFT? I really like his gopro products. Sam your project is still printing... Keep up the good work!
This channel doesn't pop up in my recommended often, but when it does, its cringy-ass shit like this.
15:08 It would say Your Team Remains not, Better Luck Next Time
2:24 SAM! There is no vaulting yet yah hacker!  3:39 D don't let your dingle dangle dangle in the dirt!
Did they stage this because I can't tell I mean obviously they are not shooting anything so how do they know if they get hit or hit someone
Isn't this where the kid got shot in the back?
What would I need to do to become part of the Node team? You guys are awesome!
I was hit hericane irma and  lost power so I coodent watch the awsome vids
next time, have The trama mixed up, matt of D be a ref and hace an airdrop
They need to organize proper events for people to do this, PUBG got so popular so fast that if they did that they would make a shit ton of money.
Well worth the effort
this was extremely boring i skipped half of it
They should do a drone shot and edit in the barrier
what!? Ds team won? how shocking XD      ....also spoilers i guess...
Can you guys try Rising Storm 2?
when mark called for alex before he died it got me in the feels
Music is from ARMA 3 BTW!!!
what airsoft place is this?
Simunition NEEDS to be introduced. . . . . . . .   =D
Cool idea but lame af to watch lol
06:13 Well, it seems Sam and Niko has finally decided to go their separate ways after many, many years of friendship.
>not using the GBB UMP-9\nStill an amazing video.
You didn't really jump from a plane in the beginning. You just used in game footage. Real Life Battlegrounds my ass.
The graphics in the new desert map are unreal
Neat is escape from Tarkov
Now everyone who was in the game owes D and Matt a Chicken Dinner
If there was Real life BattleRoyale , There would be Real life Weapons .... Weaklings !!
C R I N G E
D winner dinners the HECK out of the b o i s
Looking for players of ALL SKILL to join our DISCORD server! FOR PUBG PLAYERS! its called Everybody Sucks But Us! JOIN TODAY https://discord.gg/8gjzeK3
what a play by Matt
it looks just like real life
Is that the same field as the patch video???
I prefer watching in third person.
also have someone thats not playing place guns and gear on the ground and shoot a flair in the air for air drop
http://steam-community.com/?ref=9KFiLRL\ntake 20$ for steam from this link
They should have way more people on the unknown battle grounds and should have snipers and scopes
so this is the new desert map
node in hebrew is fart
Most entertaining airsoft video so far!! I would Love some more!!!
2:37 D finds bag, I'm sorry but was that meant to be? sorry for the joke D
Team Matt & D was destined to win
Should have a Drone drop a care package, pretty sure you guys could get a Matrice 600 with payload
Anyone Give Me The Link Of The Page Airsoft
D was hoping someone say “chicken dinner” but he was ignored 😂
Two things to say: 1. 15:00 Mark needs to be offered a movie roll for that death scene. 2. D is a brutal MF for being the only person to execute a downed person in this game lol.
Chayna numba wan
Add nades next time
This is great
D is amazing
Soldiers wannabe
omg i wanna do this
CRINGE
I'd love matts face gear
CHINA NUMBA 1!
16:07 air drop.
China numba juan
need more D&D
No chutes? Disappointed
China＃1
Anyone thought Mark looks like Euron Greyjoy's nicer twin?
lol losers
MOAR
CHINA NUMBAH ONE
plase drink redbul
Play duck hunt!
do more airsoft and pubg plz plz
Is this PUBG VR edition ? :o
CHINA NUMBER 1
Waiit...nobody is screaming NIGGER? Disappointed.
More people
have fun
Do this again
nice video nice job :)
They are stealing novritschs idea
this was amazing
Guns are sick
Awesome!
This so good
Hey! I'm a small PUBG youtuber and was wondering if someone could check out my videos. I put alot of effort into them. Hope you enjoy! Thanks! :D
WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?
So if it gets brighter with every filter you add... why dont we add a thousand filters so its shining as bright as a lamp? We wouldnt even need electricity and yeah. Oh my god i came to another idea. We could use this to shine bright light on solar panels. But watch out. I did the maths and im pretty sure if we add too many filters we might create a second sun
This works with polarizing filters don't just eliminate light not polarized at a specific angle. The light that does go through is normalized to a specific polarity, so light is changed as it goes through the first filter, so that's why you see this result. It's not a pardox. There's a better explanation here: http://www.alienryderflex.com/polarizer/
What if what we think to be dark is actually just  a wavelength of light that we cannot see? Or that certain wavelengths of certain polarity gets blocked by filter A and B which turns it into infrared, or ultraviolet, or radar or x-rays or maybe even gamma rays.\nThat certainly explains where the missing particles go...\n*And That We Just Can't See Them*\nMaybe we looking at this the wrong way?\nI'm not to sure about this theory, because my science level of understanding is high-school level.
You start with a nice experiment everybody can do at home, and all of a sudden talk about entangled electrons. It's no surprise ordinary people do not understand what voodoo you are talking about.
What if they just shift their polarization to fit the gap though some geometry in the electromagnetic field created by the filter? That way it would be easier to pass though a second one because half of the shift occurred on the filter before
I agree with some comments here. What if the filter interferes with the photons giving them a slight spin/rotation, not big enought to make them rotate a full 90 degrees thus no light passing when filters are perpendicular but enought that when enough filters are stacked, they actually allow more light to go through due to the spin by the filters. I think the error in this experiment is the filter and not the light itself.
Why with 22.5º the 85% of the light goes through instead of the 75%? Because its not linear, it matches the SIN function.
All of the light emerging from a linear polarizer is polarized in the direction of the axis of the polarizer, regardless of the polarization angle of the light entering the polarizer.  The polarizer does not act purely as a filter that blocks or passes the photons.  This fully explains what happens when the third polarizer is added.
What happens if beam splitters or prisms are used with these polarizers?
They said it themselves, polarizers are quantum measuring devices, measuring something's quantum state changes it. Of course, that explains nothing as this is just the most readily available example of a much bigger question, but I find it comforting none the less.\n\nIt doesn't surprise me though that this isn't more widely known about, I bet if you were to randomly survey people they'ed usually tell you that polarization blocks UV rays. \n\nHuh, the polarizers are in a way asking the photons a leading question.
I read a simple book about how LCD cells work, and that explained the polaroid stuff by saying that any light that does pass through a filter between 0° and 90° will be polarized in the direction of that filter. You have light coming from A and going to 45° tilted B. 50% of it passes through and that is now polarized in B's direction, meaning some of it can now turn again to pass through C. The polarization makes like a twist when it passes through many filters at different angles. Only if two filters immeziately after ech other are 90° tilted does light get blocked completely.\n\nYes? No? Maybe?
Polarized light microscopy, which employs crossed linear polarizers, is widely used to characterize the morphology of materials (e.g polymers, minerals).  For example - an unoriented or amorphous polymer appears completely dark when imaged through crossed polars. In contrast, an oriented or semicrystalline polymer displays interference colors through cross polars as it alters the polarization of light that passes through (see birefringence). The same is happening when you insert a polarizer (also an oriented polymer) between the two crossed polars - the light exiting the middle polarizer is now elliptically polarized, which can pass through the third/final polarizer resulting in a bright image
Such channels deserve more publicity yet I see Jake Paul videos on the trending page. Oh the irony.
The shitty music is really annoying, it filters 15% of viewers,  trying to follow another 15% drops out, but at the same time the music gives you the impression that at any point they are going to serve you a kickstarter gimmick and it drops it down to 15%... yet at the end it's 85%. What gives??
I'm not too good with this whole quantum physics thing but going by the logic in the video, it would be possible to create a polariser that only has a negligible effect on brightness by having a large amount of polarising filters angled at small angles away from each other right?
But I like pop science too, it leads me into the mainstream science
But isn't light a wave as well as a particle? Does that play a role?
Pardon my lack of knowledge.  But what stops us from explaining it as thus:  When a photon passes through a polarizing filter it becomes a dormant photon.  It appears to be blocked, but it continues on it's way and can be activated by passing through any filters again.  This would solve all of the problems if I am not mistaken.
This is becasue you are thinking one way about cause and effect. Reverse your assumptions. instead of assuming it is the filter that effects changes in the light waves assume it is the light waves effect changes in the filter. Part of the light causes no effect and part causes an effect. You see light so the natural tendency is to follow the order you used, because of your ability to observe via sight. The energy in the light waves has to go someplace and you are not accounting for the blocked photons change of state. e.g. light to heat; being reflected; etc. which could easily account for your differences in numbers without entanglement. For example blocked is relative only to the photons that pass through as opposed to those that don't. Assume a partial reflection instead, and you have light passing through A that bounces back and forth between A and B and light passing through B that bounces back and forth between B and C. You are being confused by the simplicity of both your method and the set up, but your numbers do not allow for all possibilities created by that set up. Energy and matter don't just disappear but do change states.\nThe problem is not in the theories but in the fact that humans make assumptions according to what they have been taught and how they assume the cause and effect relationship according to their preconceived suppositions.
Please do a podcast together.
Why are we assuming that it should be 50%? It should be whatever the result is. On top of that, we KNOW that all of the photons that pass through the filter are altered in their polarization to the alignment of the filter. So why in the world would we assume that anything different would happen? Also, why are we trying to do the math as if the photons' polarization ISN'T modified by the filters when we know that it is?\n\nI'm so confused by all of the terrible assumptions being made.\n\nThe only thing this appears to absolutely prove is non-locality, which is a perfectly reasonable conclusion given we already know that space-time can be heavily manipulated by concentrations of energy, if not more than that.
I think that you are thinking about this problem in too much of a mathematical sense. In a polarizer, the photon only goes through if it has a different orientation than the film. By this definition, it is statistically impossible for any photon not to pass through the film (by principle that it is the same type of infinity that says that two things cannot happen at the exact same time given enough significant figures). This means that the polarizer has a tolerance for angular displacement of photons entering, and that the act of passing through the polarizer has an effect on the orientation of the photon that also includes uncertainty
The photons pass through all 3 filters. The energy is just emitted as light when it hits the filter at the same angle as the wiggle of the photon, which explains why the addition of the 3rd filter is brighter
am i the only one who feels like this makes perfect sense? i mean i couldnt tell you the math part but i really dont see the paradox
What about heat? If the photons get absorbed or reflected off the filter, the filter should heat up, yes? If it doesn't, that means all the photons passed through anyway, and spontaneously changed their polarization after passing through it.
It's all sorcery. Or Gremlins. Yeah, probably gremlins.
Imagine it like railroad tracks. One set goes north south, the other east west. By introducing another set of tracks at an angle in between, it gets easier for the train to go from one set to the other. The more tracks at different angles, the more curved the overall track, and the easier it gets.
My brain was a mush by the time I reached 2 minutes in the video... How the fuck did I land up here, I was watching iphone X videos..
Wait doesn't it make sense that the polorized filter is changing the properties of the photons? So what if the photons are acting like  a flat board shooting through space and the polorized filter is like a slot for the photon boards to fit through. Now if you put down one filter it forces all photons to go through to be oriented vertically, and if you put another one after it that's rotated 90°, then no light would get through because the slots would be set horizontally. Now if you put a filter between them at 45° isn't it possible that the photon boards would be deflected from their original vertical course and be skewed slightly sideways? And then be skewed slightly sideways again once hitting the last filter? So instead of having to jump from vertical to horizontal it can go in degrees in between making it easier for the photons to jump.
I totally understood all of this... :S
I have a Physics degree and still struggled with this video... (We did cover this in the course but I can't remember)
It seems to me that the polarization of the light is being affected when passing through the second filter. Some of the light is rotated or shifted if you will, thus making it more likely to pass through the final filter, which would normally be like a wall because the polarization was not affected. So why couldn't you argue some mechanism for the filter affecting the state of the hidden variables once they pass through the second filter, therefore altering the probabilities to what you see?
Is there any chance that the entanglement is simply broken during the filter experiment?
It's obviously that the universe is just drunk.
You lost me at 'if'.
Two of my favourite channels collaborating together producing minutes of awesomeness. Loving this:D
The only theory that i can think of is that the amount of photons blocked by a lens depend on the difference in angle with the PREVIOUS lens.\n\nIf the 2 lenses have a difference degree of 90 then all light is blocked\n\nIf the 2 lenses have a difference degree of 45 then a part of the light is blocked\n\nif the 3 lenses all have a difference of 45 degrees a part of the light between A and B gets blocked, then another part between B and C gets blocked.\n\nThis however does not shows why if you have lens A at 0 degrees, lens B at 90 degrees, and lens C at 45 degrees, light can still get through.
what if the wave particle hase a virtual string like thing in its path and the sum in mesuring pint were the particle shuld end up is total the theoretical ways ewen the first or second thing suld be all moust shurtenly blocking it ?
The lie of the wave.
I wish I was intelligent but I'm not.
What if polarisation is like trig and when light passes trought it the angle of the wave changes making it more likely to pass trough another filter working as almost an angular gradient. The more filters the smoother the gradient making it bighter
This is so cool. I'm a physics major, and we literally talked about this exact topic, photon polarization and Bell's theorem, in the first lecture of my Quantum theory II course. Also don't think I didn't recognize that Dirac notation. I knew basically all of this stuff, or at least most of the theory behind it, already, but it's so great to see advanced college level physics be talked about on one of these big science channels that isn't PBS Space Time. They already do that. But none the less. Awesome video guys!
Why is it that we believe a photon only has the options of  passing or being blocked by a polarized filter?  What tests have been performed to rule out the polarized filter affecting the polarization of the light?  High speed objects don't quick changes, or right angles. What if it is like a bullet down the barrel of a gun?  At 90 degrees the bullet fails to pass, at 45 much better, and 22.5 better yet.  Using a series of angles we can create a curve to bend the trajectory of a bullet.  Why is it that a series of polarized filters can't be acting as a curve to bend the polarization of light that passes through it?
So we are all going to use the word theory erroneously now?\n\nThere is a reason this is called Bell's theorem. \n\nThe word you lot need to use is hypothesis.
Is the light bouncing off the filters and reacting with itself taken into consideration here?
*sigh* I mean light gets polarized as it strikes a surface right? Because of it reorienting on a surface, or glare, polarized filters are good at blocking it out. Could photons waving around close enough to the axis of the filter not reorientate like they do when bouncing off a surface? Why 50%? If it was one specific orientation, shouldn't it be a lot less than 50%? So it's probably reorienting those waves within 25% of the filter orientation rather than blocking out ones without the exact orientation needed.
A thorium liquid fuel reactor video, decay cycle, and options video would be awesome for this channel in my opinion
You should do another version without the loud, distracting music. How the hell am I supposed to concentrate on you talking so quickly about something so complicated with that annoying distraction? Why does everybody ruin their videos with annoying, loud music.
I like Minute Physics, I have a beard, and I wear glasses! 😊
God either doesn't exist or is insane, I'm going with the former
maybe systox25 is correct... but it doesnt seem fun that way. so hear me out. maybe, it is not as locally real as it seems, and if the signal between photons must be faster than light while entangled then would the hidden variable be a portion of time itself?  if we entangled them to ground them to move at the same time and space, then what if its through different space-time altogether. here me out... they behave in the exact way we already know they do, and its not the photons themselves moving through this alternate space-time but the signal between photons themselves for a brief (and i mean faster than light brief) amount of time that causes them to behave this way. And the underlying variable isnt presently real but was or will be, real. (also. should have put this in earlier but im tired of revisions... the only reason they are able to move in such a way would be because it is light itself. and only isnt detectable because it blends in with other electromagnetic fields and waves in the surrounding areas, such as the sun, for example... just something i pulled out my ass but yeah.)
The problem here is that it's treating all photons as equal (or the same) and they've all ready proved that they're not .
This shit isn't nearly as complicated as you're making it.  When you pass a photon through a slit smaller than the sinusoidal height it rotates the polarization of the photon.  Imagine throwing a Frisbee between two poles, it either is at the proper angle to make it and get a kick in the direction of alignment at the same time, or it doesn't and bounces off.  Now picture this in a 9-d space where each of our 3 dimensions has another 2 complex dimensions bound to it - it just bounces out of reality and the vibration it leaves behind on the pole is the energy absorbed.  You don't need to lose realism or locality - you're just looking at the problem through a straw.  (Another hint: complex space is what you get when you have something moving faster than the speed of light - the photons just get kicked back in time.)
Locality is most certainly obeyed, we know that it must in order for causality to not be violated.  Classical Realism is wrong though, in the sense that the 'hidden variables' which people were looking for and which are excluded by these experiments only eliminate CLASSICAL hidden information.  In reality the Shannon entropy is NEGATIVE and it is the interaction of the photons and the filters negative entropy which produce positive joint entropy values.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc
What if the hidden variable is actually the angle of vibration of the light, and its interactions with filters is informed by that variable, and can also change this variable? Then, even in the entangled case, all our results make sense. Since the filter interaction operates on a cosine relationship, we would get exactly what we expect. The questions then are related to the difference in angle between two filters. The idea that the photon's state is multiple booleans relating to which filter it will pass through seems ill-posed, what is more important is the photon's angle. To make the entangled experiment more interesting, we should entangle three photons together, and pass them through all three filters simultaneously. Then our results would be interesting- if we see 72% of photons pass through all three, then we know there must be a faster than light communication between the photons.
You know, I'm so tired of the XXI mania of jumping to conclusions that anything you don't fully understand is either breaking the laws of physics or is in 2 controversial states at once. Whatever the answer is, it's logical and clear. Learn to say I don't know. It's not as shameful as stating something stupid with a smart face. \n\nThen again, what else do I expect from YouTube...
Um... this might be a dumb question - but would spin properties be translated *between* photons if they pass through a filter as a wave? instead of as a particle?
the genius who built our computerized world didn't forsee us doing this experiment so thus a glitch in the system. probably will be patched soon.
Whooooooooooooooa, that looks great, must be used in today's new tools.
I think the only way us humans will understand quantum mechanics in any sort of meaningful way that makes sense to our minuscule minds, would be if advanced extraterrestrials visited us and taught us what they know about it. Because this shit just gets weirder and weirder the more we study it. And I think we are trying to mold it into something that our minds can actually perceive, and not how quantum mechanics truly works in its natural state.
Isn't it more likely that two linear polarizing filters 45 degrees apart form a quarter wave plate and create elliptical or circular polarized light? Circular polarized light would have a presence in both of the linear polarized planes and allow light to pass through the linear polarizing filter. Fun fact if you rotate the last (3rd) filter -45 degrees instead of +45 degrees (with respect to the middle filter) it blocks the light in the center. This create another quarter wave plate that reversing the rotation convention of the circular polarization from right to left blocking all the photons.
Wait a second. I think this video might be longer than a minute
OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LONG THIS MINUTE WAS JEEEEEZZZ. LOL awesome vid guys..I had played with polarizing filters before, but didn't know just how cool the mathematics of it was.
Can you PLEASE do this regularly I love this cooperative style because it shows how the process of discovery works in the scientific community with back and forth and slow introductory of new schools of thought and after watching this other videos while still entertaining and informative seem more lecture-ish.
And it's not like we're absorbing the nonaligned portions of the photons polarization energy at each filter with individual photons.  That would create a red shift.  So I guess it's the total energy of the light wave (assuming I'm using this word right) is getting normalized to the polarization of each filter as it passes with the remaining energy absorbed by the filter.  Which I guess would mean that the filters are effectively destroying all the photons and recreating new photons that just happen to have the same statistical mix of wavelength and direction of travel, but with the new polarization mix.  Trying to make this work with classical physics is fun.
The percentage of photons that make it through a lens of set of lenses is the same every time. Doesn't that suggest order and determinism? And doesn't that go against quantum theory which seems to be about chaotic things like cats that are neither alive or dead?
This video was so illuminating and led me to ask Is there a Plank angle? and OF COURSE there is! Thank you!
Maybe its just reflecting photons and not blocking them, so it bounces off b and hits A again, same with C... Also it seems linear in some format, we should try every round digit degree and find a spectrum to see if it actually is linear...\nor maybe its due to the structure of the filter.... Hmmm
Loving these comments thinking they immediately understand a phenomenon that's been unfathomable for over 50 years...
3Blue1Brown is crap; never collaborate with him again!!!
It's just turtles all the way down...
I'm by no means a physics academic, but it seems to me that the differences in the make of the polarizing lenses weren't taken into consideration, looking at articles such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizing_filter_(photography) or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizer\n\nOr, perhaps a wrong example was used which doesn't really translate to the quantum mechanics being discussed.
shouldve broken this up into a few videos. wouldve allowed for digestion of some hard to grasp subject matter before throwing in something on top of it
The best way I can wrap my head around it is that the light is sort of ignoring the first polarizer in a 3 polarizer system and continuing as if its always at 45 degrees.
Your hidden variable is consciousness. But it gets weirder. It's your consciousness that affects the experiment with the influence of your conscious mind and expectation. That it's the conscious influence of the individual particals that you didn't know were living, conscious, and with a choice.
I like how many of the top comments are pointing out the effect that you guys shot down with the entangled photon experiment. Like, did everyone not finish the video?
How does this account for human perception of light intensity?\nThis is probably a stupid question to you, but it's perplexing me
This only disproves local hidden variables but not external ones, i.e(everything being controlled by a futuristic computer program like the matrix)
I have seen the lens effect, but didn't give it much thought, I thought everyone kinda knew that that happened
And this is why I'm not a physicist...
Maybe we are wrong about photons being blocked. Maybe they realign to pass through a filter therefore taking their potential energy and light with them aligning and realigning as required to pass through filters? So therefore all photons pass through all filters by the realignment affects how we count them. After the first filter half the photos realigned and were aligned with and masked by the other 50% and so one. Once we accept that no photons are every blocked, but in effect masked by those they travel with the math starts to make sense. Where's my chalk board when I need it?
If I hear one more blocked by A or pass through B I'm gonna destroy something.
*1+1=3*
Well, maths are wrong?
mind = blown

Thanks for watching today :) This had my heart pounding. Please share today with some friends and family.
U should make socks
You should do tie dye hats @romanatwood @smilemore
Hoy are crazy
that was cool
Coras eyes are soooooo beautiful.  😭😭😩😩❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Wow brits already skinny again
Find the difference      😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
Omg Kora is soooo cute adorable I wish I can meet her
That one time.. at band camp.. who else caught it? 😂😂
can't believe you didn't vlog that
XD ONE TIME AT BAND CAMP I STUCK A FLUTE
Subscribe to me and I'll subscribe back
On camera, the brims look too long.
I remember some of my kittens before they got nurtured, tried to make babies...they were siblings.
please come out with those hats i love those also my brothers elementary school is getting lanyards from you there school is ocean view you are my role model
Country has a 🔥 hat
I love those hats. Not a huge fan of the trucker style
I always thought K9 was just the generic term for a dog but according to the Oxford English Dictionary it refers to a military of police dog! (& I live in Oxford in the UK so we'll go with that)
He look like a father
They had your games at my school dude name pedo
White hat is so dope🔥 i want one😍
You can here Country breathing 😂😂
omg every dang time!!! im never going to be able to get my girlfriend one of those sweaters!!
Love those hats specially the white onr
SUB=WIN THE LOTTERY!!\n \nLIKE=MEET ROMAN!!\n\nScroll=bad luck for a year
Please tell me I am not the only one who noticed that one of the guys with Roman's production has on an Always Keep Fighting shirt from Supernatural's Jared Padalecki...😻
i dont know why but i did'nt get this vlog on my subscription box but i got yesterdays vlog
They should just use labs to lick people into submission and then knock them unconscious with their wagging tail
I love the video
That jacket make you look like you skipped leg day
CORA! is cute.And it sounded like she said antie
They can't make tye dye in the USA? Dude. Your chick is literally as dumb as a rock.
Was Noah really eating a chicken leg with a fork? Lol
This video is #14 on trending !!!
She said daddy OMG
#29 trending tf
A
I forgot they had kittens
Sell those hats!
Ok my. Dad is watching
N0000o
Awhh Cora is the cutest thing ever !!!❤️❤️😭
ROMAN YU SHOULD MAKE VISORS HATS IN DIFFERENT COLOR WITH SMILE MORE LOGO !!!! Like if you agree
😃
36 on trending! Good video!
Hi smile more now
OMG THE BUS!!!!! 😱😱
1st
I love those hats!!
You are great
I swear, Brit is so similar to this one girl in my school. It's so strange.
Please it would be my wish to get 100 subscribers
I hope cora could say smile more that would be soo cute
Did y'all hear country breathing hard as hell 😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
The sample hats would be awesome styles for those of us who hunt. Or at least I like that style. The colors however wouldn't work
I can just imagine how Zues would have acted if he saw you get taken down by that k-9. Little man would have flipped.
may I ask who is country like what's he do.  body guard? . I like him he's cool 😎
I buy one and 3 months later and it wasn't there
I was about to say I have that sweatshirt!... then I realized I bought it from their store...:0
I do not have twitter so I can not see it =(
Roman, you are giving to the police, remember at the Cavs game
Anyone else notice country’s heavy breathing
If a dog ever attacks you you grab the front legs and pull them apart as hard and as far as you can.
The Police drug the dogs sense and it's bad for the dogs brain that's why they are so mad and can smell 10 times better than a regular dog
I can be a pool boy. @LostCreekRambler on IG, Follow me!!!! All of your dreams will come true.
Love the white hat
I think they are making a tv show
Your baby LOOKS SOSOSOSOSSOSOSOSOSO FFFFFFFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT just something I see not a complament
she looks amazing in the hats
Why is he doing BW stuff?
They should have hat that looks like the material they use to make jeans.
Can I get a shoutout please it's my birthday
Sub - meet Roman\nLike - be Romans kid or friend \nReply - have a good day
roman zose would be happy because he is lying in tenis balls in heaven but u can cry roman because he is only yours if u read this we all love you
That's how I feed my eel.
Definitely not a fan of the sample hats. They look too cheesy.
I'm your biggest fan Roman I'm called ace and my mate Harrison is a big fan
Country ur a really heavy breather did anyone else notice?
Country i love ur sounds when u have the camera
Country looks like Wreck It Ralph in the safety suit! I'd love to see a vlog where country does some Wreck It Ralph type stuff!!!!
Roman you are so brave you got attacked by a dog wow love you guys you guys are awesome Smile More
MIKE THE MIKE GUY IS WEARING AN ALWAYS KEEP FIGHTING JARED PADALECKI SHIRT AND IM SO HAPPY
What's wrong with the voice it doesn't match when you talk
What's up with the ring on brits finger? Can someone please explain this to me 😹
As will smith said the best things in life are on the other side of terror 🔥🔥
can i please have a tie die hoddie,thanks
😍 how cute Noah having a cuddle with his Baby Sister 🤗 Cora looked so content 😍💕💕💕💕
Damn Country is a heavy breather
Doing it for the views :D
'It's like putting on a couch'😂😂😂😂
I have a YouTube channel it is cooper Geyer
You need to start wearing that white hat
When are we gonna see the Beard Flip??
My dad raised Razor's Edge Pitbulls. If you faced any of them Roman, you'd probably die. No offense, but the dogs were trained to where you could take them out anywhere and be fine, but if you were in danger, my dad could say grrr and the dog would growl at whoever my dad pointed at, then he could say push' em girl, and the dog would push the person back, still growling, and then he could say crush 'em girl and the dog would grab a limb and crush that limb.
it is def the scene from a christmas story lol
Roman how do you feel about an urchin trending at 7
You should make baby merch for Cora
Country is a total mouth breather.
I broke my radius and ulna plz pray for me
Hahahah this is sooo fun. It very fun watching 🙏
Love this vid and guy soool muchhhhh. So funny.
As a korean i can confirm that this is true
PLEASE WATCH MY VIDEOS . ILL BE CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST SOON AND WOULD APPRECIATE SOME SUB SCRIBERS
Whenever I answer back in English, my Chinese relatives seem so disappointed...
actual experience i had today with my japanese teacher's friend
Omg you summarized my life in 26 seconds
This is cool and beautiful))) Thank you for visiting us))) Good luck to you
I know why it's 2 on the trending\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause he is talking to himself
I'm Mexican, so whenever I speak to somebody who presumably doesn't understand Spanish they get equally as fucking confused
Damnit that's me but with French.
So you want him to fuck you in the face with a gun? xD
me with italian when i visit my family in italy
LMAO this is actually me because im half Korean I can say a few words, and I get into situations where someone who fully speaks the language starts talking to me fluently and Im just there nodding my head frantically looking like an idiot😬
XD\nthis is me in Cantonese and vietnamese lol
Me in Spanish Class
The sonic drowning music killed me
His voice is deep but he looks like the fat baby mamo.
THIS IS SO ME AND IM KOREAN TOO\nAND YOU CAN TELL THE PERSON IS AWARE YOU CANT SPEAK KOREAN
Fuck is fuck in Korean.
Cant make it to the ten minute algorithm but at least he makes quality and original content.
Me in French class
My relatives all speak a different language, and I speak languages they don't because I want to go live in Italy later on in life
this is me in french
When you know Spanish but when it comes to actually speaking to people you can't talk for shit
Uhhhhhhh this makes me cringe. All those moments.\nAnd then when the person realize you have no idea what they are saying just uhhhhhhh. Im sorry!!!!\n\nLol I remember one person thought I was lying when I couldnt speak tagalog. Lol who lies like that.
That's going to be me tomorrow on my AP Spanish test...
How is this still on trending?
French all over again
When my French teacher call on me

Me in French class
Lmao be when someone ask me how to say something in Korean because  all I do is watch dramas.
Me with Tagalog and my family
The Sonic music at the end was a nice touch. Funny
Me with Filipino. Also looks like me when I'm trying to speak to my family. ._.

he sounds so worried at the end haha
Lmao where did you come from? Subscribed!
everytime i go to weddings or some relatives' house, about 90% of the time they speak gujurati and im not fluent so ill say something and (for example) not use the correct pronouns/genders and end up severely offending everyone. oh and also i learnt recently that theres a specific way to address men or someone older than you and how words change when saying something to someone older than you so god knows how many people ive offended in the 16 years ive been alive by addressing them like a child
When I'm forced to speak Canto to family.
Me and spanish (I just haven't spoken it in so long lol)
This is me in Chinese class... Every. Fucking. Day.
I get this aaaaall the time with French. Both sides of my family are hella French! My last name is the Frenchiest French name there is! I even *look* French! And I'm just there like Ah, Oui...Je suis...uhhh...
This is leaving me so many question marks:\n\n\n\n\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????\n?????     ?             ?                ?

ha!
Holly molly number #2 on tending WTF :O
Floyd Mayweather, the swimmer.
Hey Diego get Kendrick Lamar in your show man.
What's going on ?  A hundred dollars ? That's how much I payed for your fight 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ain't that Justin Bieber's ex girl? 😂
Fuck it, I'm going to the pub with $1000 to risk on the pokies in about 20 minutes from now.\nHope they call me Mr money tonight, probably not though, I'll try and we'll see,wish me luck.
Floyds a sharp guy still considering how long he's been in the boxing business for . Not a lot of fighters can retire with a clear mind like his
Diego-How many cars do you have in Las Vegas, Nevada?              Floyd-25 Diego-I have a bike hahahahahha
I THOUGHT HE WAS IRISH
I can't keep watching it's soo good
The last fight until he run out of money...
Floyd is the best hands down
I'm gonna say it. Floyd is funnier than Conor
Floyd just be honest with us....steriods use  for the McGregor fight right?
I got nervous when he started spelling deep
Im new to this, is this supposed to be funny ???
This Punk is cute as hell....fuck him 😂😂😂😂
I love this video so much
enjoy ur retirement champ. u earned it
Yo!!! You should interview more celebrities. Ur hella funny
SUBSCRIBE IF YOU PLAY or LIKE GTA5, BATTLEFIELD, and NBA, I HAVE GREAT VIDEOS
it's called rapid fire not...take your time fuckin leaned. TBE
2:19 why was i waiting for floyd to spell deep wrong
she punched me harded than you punched your ex wifeDont do it like that to me diego
Must be nice to only carry 100$ bills lol
I don't understand how you fuck up the own impression that YOU made up.
I don't even know ariganda\n*Arianna Grande gets pissed*
Is that Rudy man use talking?
Floyd: You did that better than me.\n\nDiego: You should hire me.\n\nFloyd: Thank you Diego.\n\nDiego: Thank you champ.\n\nFloyd: My buddy.\n\n😂😂 Floyd's so chill and awesome.
So boastful that he said ok to being interviewed by a puppet, I love it
Song at the end?
Shit was funny man UK i was with the white man to win but I'm glad Floyd won held his number n went out a champion congrats man
That's how much I paid for your fight lolololololol
There's more to life than strip clubs and being very rich 😂
Damn Mr. Mayweather is soooo fuckin HOT..If i saw Him i'd bow before Him and kiss His feet..Submit and happily obey His commands..
It's called rapid fire haha
This interview got me dead 💀💀 😂😂😂
Can I borrow some money? Or can I take some money?
The legend is back we missed u diego !!!!¡¡!!!!😏
Floyd is a good looking man! dog gone it!
Man lost respect. Encourages divorce? For side bitches? Man. This interview disgust me. In many ways. May it be fake or legit. Either way its promoting evil intent. World is so twisted and i dont get how people see this ok.
Which account, which bank... Lol one day... One day😂😂😂
Puppet: How much money do you have in your bank account?\n\nFloyd: Ha, which account? Which bank? 😄
Honestly Floyd is adorable when he runs his face 😂🖤
Damn I kinda lost some respect for him after this he's such an asshole
I would fucking love watching you interview kanye west
The fuck? Why would Floyd do this?
That puppet sound like paulie
That's racist that's racist
That was sick.
THE BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
Next fight Mayweather vs twon .
Money team
Nice vid
he gonna fight GGG FIRST
...I hate her Floyd,  I hate her... LMAO
*hi**
This high key sucked
hecky nah funny is hell
What a champ
https://youtu.be/1YEatC1v8Rs\n\n\nFunniest fucking parody ever. Not better then Diego bro
Happy independence day Diego
Hilarious
Woah, Mayweather a pretty cool dude too.
Dumbed down filthy chimps.. Dindu Inspiration
Hi
The bank :,)
Lol
2:56
Funniest shit ever
lol very funny
Funnel cake funnel cake funnel cake
Just imagine Diego interviewing Mcgregor
Both a legend
The voice is The viner Rudy Manscu
Aye..this prolly was Floyd's funniest interview 😂😂😂
Lol could not stop laughing

Glad I'm not the only one who basically doubles the amount of garlic in any recipe. Extra garlic is always a must
If your away again with Lilly and you don't want the same videos as her.  Why don't you do a room tour video and view and what you ate in a day.  That would make up another video.   Or a come shopping with me in whatever place your at.
Whenever I make something with potato, before i put it in the curry or soup etc , i put the potato in the microwave for about two mins, just so speed up the cooking process because potatoes always take so much longer than everything else ! Great video, and love the coat xx
Quick tip lea and perrins contains anchovies
Anna, that soup looked delicious! I'd like to point out though, that most worcestershire brands (including the one you used) have anchovies in them... so they're not vegan. Just a heads up for the next time you have vegan people over :)
You should get an immersion blender. Saves so much time for soups like that. You can throw in the veggies straight away and then blend it in the pan.
Would love to see more of these videos 😍
I love your What I Eat in a Day videos. So many great recipes and meal inspo.
So healthy and INSPIRATIONAL!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
150% obsessed with that coat!! xoxo, caylie
Anna I love how honest and normal you are. Brilliant video :)
I only discovered your channel a few weeks ago, but I already love you and your videos so much! You have such a lovely and fun personality, and your content is always on point! Your vlogs really keep me company and cheer me up when I'm feeling down :) love from Italy!! 💜
no joke eating a Block of Cadbury milk chocolate while watching this
Eeek, Anna, just for future reference - Worcestershire sauce isn't suitable for vegetarians :(
Just went to the gym for the first time in weeks and now this video pops up, guess this is a sign to live healthy again hahah - EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOD 👅👅💗💗
1st world problems - and Tesco sell lemon and poppy seed muffins. 🙄
Loved this Anna!
❤️❤️❤️
Love this 💗
Love this so! ❤️
Cinnamon Grahams are life
That soup looked amazing , defo making it tomorrow 👍🏻
Is pizza junk food? 🤔
Love this videoooooo x
Pickled onion monster munch - throw back!!!
Byyyyyeee, love you--cutest cutest cutest bean\n\nI love theeeeese eeeeeee
more WIEIAD videos pls!!!!!!
Great vid subscribed 👌
Aww I want more vlog ):
Looks good!
💕 ur vlogs x
That soup look delicious, I'm gonna try it myself!
What size coat did you go for ? Is it true to size ? X
The link to the soup recipe doesn't work, but I'm guessing it's the Power Protein Soup 😏 \nThanks for the inspiration Anna, you just gave me a good idea for lunch and dinner !
Love your food vids as usual! But the vocal fry was very difficult to listen to .
I love this kind of videos!!
Aaahh that music you use, so relaxing. Makes me think of being at the beach, when I really should be working right now haha
i could watch you for hours and hours!! Love videos like this, more please :-) and by the way: the coat is GOALS, i will order as well. Just for reference: which size did you order? :)
You're my favourite youtuber and absolutely love these chilled types of vlogs! Especially what I eat in a day! ❤️ much love x
This was motivation for me, thanks 😎😇
Your hair is looking soooo glossy and lovely! Updated hair care routine?! x
I love your nails in this video! What is it?!
You are truly a role model. Your vlogs are my favorite !
For a girl who has eaten loads of junk food you look fab!! Love that coat x
Thanks for the healthy motivation.  I've been on the junk food train myself.  Vegetable soup looks so yummy.  I love your new coat too!
Loved your throw back to Barney the Dinosaur haha! Great video, super hungry after watching this now :)
Yet another cracking vlog! Thanks for being incredible with the content... and just in general! www.byharrison.com
Anyone know where you can find a coat like this but way cheaper??
Not Lazy! Judicious use of time. :)    Life's too short to waste time making rice
If you love cinnamon grahams, you might like this recipe for grain-free Almond Cinnamon Crunch cereal. It's seriously SO GOOD. Plus the little squares are cute and you feel so accomplished having made your own cereal that's not muesli or granola! https://www.mynewroots.org/site/2017/08/cinnamon-crunch-cereal-hemp-milk/
Just to let you know worcestershire sauce isn't vegan as it has anchovies in it x
Your life is so soothing to watch. I love the coat! I'm looking for a coat just like that except with buttons.
You have a good attitude about food 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻\nBalance is key 🏆
We love your What I Eat In A Day videos! You always have the best recipes that we like to try out. Also, that cost looks incredible on you!\n-Ash & Shelbs xx
I just found your channel a couple weeks ago and I've been catching up and absolutely love all of your videos!
Hey Anna, have your ever tired mixing your Greek yoghurt with protein powder? I have it all the time and it is amazing for the sweet tooth 👌🏼 especially if you the 0% fat rage Greek yoghurt. Definitely give it a try, especially vanilla protein 😍 xxx
Love that coat!!! What size did you get (for reference, not nosy 😬)?
Could you do a video on your favourite cookbooks or recipes?! I'm stuck in a rut with food and needing inspiration 😊
Im eating pizza off of the oven tray while watching this x
Saw the apricot,thought I'd let you know you have a subscriber from Armenia,the homeland of apricot 😊❤️🇦🇲Apricots are amazingly healthy!
All I would love right now is a Dairy Milk Chocolate Bar ngl!! 😂😂
Hi Anna! I microwave my potatoes first to make sure they are soft. Just be sure to stab them first. I can so relate to not everything cooking and coming together at the right time. Most recently for me it was some lentils in a veg chili.
Drinking wine and laying on the couch while watching this.... I noticed you sure know how to cook Anna! You cut things properly and not just pretend (you won't imagine how many of my friends still can't cook!)
Boil your potatoes before putting them in a curry!
If you want potatoes to cook on the stove you have to add liquid otherwise it'd burn before they cook. Also dice them a lot smaller. But man That soup looked so good! I add Worcestershire sauce to everything too lol its so savory and delicious
you always look so chic, loveee the coat 😭😍
Is there a glossier haul coming then?
Gotta have that balance! I bought some chocolate on vacation so I've been treating myself to a piece (or two haha) after meals..but the meals are healthy at least!! :) The vegetable curry looks so good too..and I'm loving that coat.
Anna I keep trying to subscribe to your newsletter and I never receive the confirmation email. I've tried on different days and it just won't work. Just thought you should know in case it's an issue on your end. Love your videos xo
Hey Anna  I <3 your videos. \nAre you planning to do a haul for capsule wardrobe? That would be helpfull. And also some tips to buy clothes that are current but not too trendy because next year they go out of style!!!
I could not relate to this anymore right now! :)
That coat is everything I have ever dreamed a coat to be ✨ NEED IT
Waiting for your house tour video ...
the food looks great!
Girl you bring joy to my heart ❤️.. and that cookies looks amazing 🍪 🤤
I love these kind of videos!  And I love it on Wednesday's when I wake up there's always an Anna video waiting on me!! 💕💕
Potatoes cook faster in water than in sauce. Done the same thing. I think its better to pre-cook them first and throw them in last :)
The picture of that cookie toward the end look ...so GOOD !!!!!!!! Lovely vlog as usual. xx
Thx for being honest!! I feel like a lot of youtubers upload a what i eat in a day and only show the good stuff or pretend to be super healthy and eat super fancy things and small portions only. 😒\nOn another note: the coat is super pretty 😊
I just went out to the kitchen, picked at a packet of cooking choc chips without any control/ awareness. I have no idea how much I had....What is wrong with me? :P
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS
And now I'm hungry....;-)
Literally brought that coat in black last week - in love!!!!
Anna can i move in with you?? I'm always wearing my dressing gown at home and everyone tells me off! They're so cozzzzzyyyyy!!
Enjoyed this real life what I eat in a day 👍🏻
Your voice is annoying
Loved this 💕
Anna! You didn't show all the chocolate buttons you consumed while watching Bake Off!
What's your take on the new GBBO hosts? We're so stressed out about it here in the States!
Liked it before watching it cause I love what I eat in a day vids/vlogs 👌🏼
I'm actually craving that soup?! I think my body's trying to tell me something.. 😄 yeah definitely need to eat better. Thanks for the inspiration Anna!
where did you get that choose love tshirt?
Nice Vans Anna! Love your foodie vids.
Wow, you're so lucky to have the cherry bombe cookbook already! So excited for it in October! I totally recommend their podcast, it's awesome!
I love your What I Eat In a Day videos! ♥
@The Anna Edit. Heyy, I see you're a youtuber too, I thought you might want to use some of my music. Look how short my vis are youtube com/XimerTracks Tell me if you like it
We started a food vlog in the cupboard that's classic 😍😍😍.
where are your rings from?
Stock cubes aren't exactly healthy. Just make vegetable stock from fresh vegetables and freeze it.
This order of the ancients better have some reference to Minerva/Juno or just in general to the ones who came before. Great opportunity given the setting of the game.
This game is lit!!!
Ive been wanting an assassin's Creed game in Egypt for over 7 years
Sr. DELS eu nunca te pedi nada. Tem elefante, dromedálio, águia e até a cobra do Marrocos que faltou no clipe da Anitta! Eu Quero!
Tbh I like this trailer more then the CG trailer, definetly feel the hype here
meh they'll probably just tag on some more multiplayer only B.S to kill the mina story, make it buggy af and release it without proper testing again. I'll wait on the reviews this time and not be suckered in by the shiny shiny.
I want to play as the Order of the Ancients...
That commercial voice at the end of these trailers, ruins it....
After this they need to work on a new ip preferably an RPG
I am really looking forward to the game, but there are too many videos on youtube of it. Starting to feel like they are showing too much.
I got mine pre-ordered for the Xbox One X
am i the only one interested to know who is the masked guy at 1:16?????
They refuse to say anything about present day. What if they brought back Desmond somehow?
With each and every trailer, i get more and more hyped
1:05 😱 But can we get his flail????
Man, I'm tempted to take off a week from work... this game has me more hyped than any game/movie in recent memory
Am I the only one who enjoys assassins creed multiplayer just as much as the story
Will they have the one man standing horse and carriage in this game like they used in ancient egypt???
1:17 is- is that a child's head in the sand..??
Ac origins is best among others ac please do bater for pc gamer 😍
I Really Think They should put Medjay Warrior's Classes in For Honor Game especially Pharaonic Pharaoh's Nubian Pharaoh's Thats Great Ideal But its Never Gonna Happen i atleast i Try I will Not Buy the For Honor Game Until they Do The Vikings are Ok The Samurai is Ok Knight an Centurion are Noobs But The Medjay Pharaonic Pharaoh's Is Better Epic The Medjay Would Be Incredibly Better Always
Is the order of ancients we're wizards?
Before the Defense of the Ancients, there was the Order of the Ancients.
My god, its looks incredible.
1:28 Awww... That poor Elephant just wanted a noice beg hug , why u kill it dude?
So these are our protagonist's.
I hope Bayek's love wont die for emotional story
There's a moist in my pants
Where r the thousands of haystacks? Lol.... let's learn from recent history.... this game will more than likely to be broken upon release
1:20 is that a little beard I see there?
Order of the Ancients = Court of Owls
I have always been excited for AC games and this one is the best yet!
So are we going to have two assassins or  more  throughout the story
so this is kind of ancient templars?
Why the hell is it called a country when it is not. It's a kingdom, hell, call it a land..pond skipping word jumblers.
Not totally sold on the gameplay I've seen but I think this will have the best Assassin's Creed story in a while
This is dope hopefully it doesn't disappoint it looks like it's been a trend within games lately
Looks great and it so far it's sounding better and better. \nMade by the same team as Black Flag\nTaken a break to make sure the game is polished and has the time its needed\nNo load screens\nWhole country to explore rather than 1-3 cities\nBut still, AC almost always seem to think bigger means better, and I think it will be hard to top 2015's AC Syndicate which was the best game since AC2, story, gameplay, characters, side missions and the city were all amazing.
AWESOME!!, I love reading through the comments and not seeing any negative comments from the dudes who live in there moms basement jerking off to Bethesda games, and calculating frame rates!!
Nah I'll wait for a honest review, I don't trust ubisoft
May the father of understanding guide us.
Love this game and idea only problem that erks me a little bit is combat... I wish it was more... idk dynamic mixed with free lance... idk I just expected a lil bit more but all in all this game is goin to be great, good job Ubisoft!!
Never really been an AC fan, but this looks cool.
It's a hard decision between this and Wolfenstein hmm....
Fran is that you?
I haven't really had all that much interest in this series but this might be the game that does it. Can't wait until October 27th.
Please let this be good
It's gonna be so good going back to sword based fighting
I just can't wait 😍
My one gripe about this series has been all the modern story stuff. I couldn't care less. I'm really into all the old history stuff they do. Great stories their. I couldn't care less about all the animus bs and running about in the present day etc. Really takes away from the game imo. Definitely not needed at all.
one thing to say 0:58, into the cenrtral flames
Just bring the game out
I recognise the narrator is it, Rachael Weisz?
Order of the Ancients = Templars
the egypt theme sold the game to me
The Trailer is Awesome I like
I liked the soundtrack for this trailer. Its sounds very egyptian for me.
I hope modern day will be a third person shooter.....
DAM! The more I see of Origins the BETTER it feels. This is coming from someone who has been heavily cautious of AC since AC3. Origins feels like ir's pulled out every stop and is aiming to rule the series it looks that good.
teaches better history than the teachers of my school..
buggysoft
Before the Templar
please dont screw this up..
0:58 lol
Ben Kingsley at 0:55
Holy jump cuts, Batman.
illuminati confirmed.
Who is hyped for roblox creed origin?
Assassin creed illuminati confirmed
😍😍😍
why dey gotta sound british
👌😻
60$ il just wait till its cheaper
Illuminati game... Cowpeople
Is that Fran/Nicole Fantl? ♐🐰
Let's go
Ooh wee for everyone!
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssss
Blaks are tha best
Ok, this game looks awesome.
They make trailers but they lost ingenuity in the actual games years ago, people need to quit buying ac games, Revelations was the last great ac game
This game is probably going to be boring
Probably not going to play Assassins Creed for a couple more years, they need to sort the graphics out properly, its holding them back
I'm getting the game on the day it comes out
One Question... are they the Ancestors of the Templars?
Move over AC 2 and Syndicate. We might have a new best in the series. Note: I haven't played Brotherhood.
An don't think there is animus story hence the origins
0:58 Guy running into burning market stall 10/10 gameplay trailer
Origins looks so promising i hope it wont fail..
Was kinda hoping for Cleopatra as the Pharaoh, woulda been hot lmao
Basically these are the Templars in the game
I love Bethesda & Projekt Red for creating skyrim / the witcher 3, it lifted the genre to another level and no game will be received good with less complication, character and lore. Hope this game meets expections, its pretty hyped up. Gonna wait for the reviews anyway.
This needs to hurry up and come out already I'm tired of waiting it's too exciting to wait
This is going to be a major illuminati fest this game. Its not enough with the chaos these evil bastards are causing 8n the world, but they're making u pay for a product that has all their religious beliefs and symbols stuffed in it.
There’s a big lie inside this new ac,templars and assassins would not be at that time its all started from Persian guy he’s name is hasan sabah who created assassins or in another world hashashin to do some work...
WE
Plot twist:  The Order of the Ancients are The Assassins! And Cleopatra is against then because she is a Templar.
I need this game. And I shall get it...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I actually have money meaning a few years :|
Only speculation but at 1:08, that looks to me like a ninja. Why they would be in ancient Egypt, I don't know but I've noticed Ubisoft have been testing out the idea of ninja-esque characters across some of their games. Far Cry 4 had the Royal Army Hunter, this Assassin's Creed Origins has a unit that uses smoke bombs which I've seen in a lot of the Alpha footage - both seem inspired by ninjas in my opinion.\n\nHopefully Ubisoft are using this game as an experiment/test box for a long awaited Ninja Assassin's Creed? Maybe we'll get an Origin's sequel set on the entire island of Japan? Add some elements of Splinter Cell into it and oh boy...
Where is modern day trailer
Thanks once for giving them a comeback soon I really miss them
Omg😭😭 Why release teaser when we have a month to wait😭😭😭 I'm actually going to die👍

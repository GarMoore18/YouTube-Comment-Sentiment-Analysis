So if you want a headache, wear polarized lenses with one eye 90 degrees off from the other eye.  It happened to me with a pair of prescription sunglasses i bought.  It was a mistake in the manufacturing and took me forever to figure out what was wrong.  After seeing this video, i wonder why my mind saw it, and gave me the head ache.
Thanks!  A literally brilliant presentation, it is about light after all. So well done. When you guys get entangled no doubt 50%+50%>100%. Need more!
Did I miss something? The light blocked by C should be 15% because it's angle (with B) is 22.5º. If it were 45º then you would expect it to be 50% and this video would make sense. This only seems to suggest a photon changes polarization after each filter.
If you actively measure the amount of light energy between the filters (without filtering it) does it change the experiment? Like the 2 slit experiment- If you quantify the amount of light energy when it comes out of one filter before it goes through the 3rd filter, would that change it?
what   do  you  mean  by  a hidden  variable      ?    also  when  light  gets   filter   through the  lens   you   get  only  the   magnetic  wave   or  only  the electronic  wave
speed od light is crazy ilusion.just minds bounderies
not so minute physics...
r u sayng that photons have personality?
Great animations

Casey, have you tried the colour pop Yes! Palette? I've heard it's a dupe for the Natasha Denona sunset palette. Would love to see you do a comparison.
omg what song is that for the end?? i love it
I love this kind of video!!!!
I'm in California and we havent gotten Fall weather yet and I'm salty bc I wanna light candles & drink pumpkin spice lattes but its too hot!!!!!!!
I live in Southern Louisiana so sadly it doesn't get cold here😅 but my fall essentials are definitely my denim jacket and all of my dark burgundy lipsticks🙌🏻
Casey, check out Rue 21 they have some of the cutest booties
What lippie are you wearing I love it
Casey! There is a new skin care / makeup brand at Walmart called Found. It would be great for you to make a review of it!.
Does anyone know what the song at the end is? I can't find it ANYWHERE 😩
I'd love to see a self tanning video!! I can never do it without having streaks & I also can't get my back!!
What band is that???
Idk why but can't wait for you to get pregnant to see all you buy!!!!
Hey Casey! I am fairly new to YouTube and just started really getting into makeup. I started looking for tutorials on Mary Kay makeup because I signed up to be a consultant but I haven't seen anything on YouTube with people giving a first impressions or even a tutorial on the products. Is Mary  Kay something you've tried or would you ever try it? BTW I've been loving your videos very inspiring! :)
Where is her ring?
omg. I missed this type of video soooo much!! Please keep doing these!!! xoxx
Your video was super 👍👍👍👍
If I was rich I'd get all this lol
calvin kelin made some great thigh high boots last year.. link is included. I'm a southern girl with who lives by thick thighs save lives so these are the ONLY pair that ever fit my calfs or thighs ... my calfs are 16.5-17 around and thigh 24 inches I'm 5'7 oh i have the side and just ordered the leather but have tried both and yes they stretch but keep the shape\n\nhttp://shop.nordstrom.com/s/calvin-klein-polomia-platform-over-the-knee-boot-women/4486446?country=US&currency=USD&cm_mmc=google-_-productads-_-33067284389_-_-96751316&rkg_id=h-3d54b3f22f980b7aae3b6a3d24822196_t-1505628857&adpos=1o2&creative=145503081077&device=c&network=g&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIy4HUncir1gIViSaGCh0nRQCCEAQYAiABEgLJOPD_BwE
Love that lip color! Dying to wear thigh high boots! I understand the big-thigh-need-ties problem! 🙋🏼
Fun and greatFall favorites video! Love Fall! Favorite season ever! Love seeing the leaves changing colors, drinking apple cider, pumpkin spice lattes, going on Fall foliage trips, and of course wearing more dramatic makeup!! ☺️👍👏💃🏿💄🍂🍁🌈
I got my Olive Booties from Just Fab!!
They have olive booties at old navy 👍🏻
You should try JustFab for booties. They have an amazing selection, I get booties from them every fall. You have to subscribe 😒 but their quantity and quality is so worth it 👍🏻👢🍂
Fall is my favorite season. I love everything about it and I love fall YouTube vids!! All the favorites and the makeup tuts😍
Girl! Go to Kohls.com\nLook in shoes and filter for boots and the color green!\n\nKohls is the only place I've really seen olive boots!! 😘
omg I died when you were talking about the barefoot dreams cardigan. I am going to ask for one for Christmas and I was sooo skeptical at first but everyone raves about them! I think I might go for the robe though because I am lazy. Loved this video :)
Loving this style of vid Casey! More please.🙌💯My Fall essentials are: a Duster Coat, Olive Utility Jacket, a Baker Boy Hat, A faux Leather Beret, Cashmere Jumpers, Teddy Style Coat/Jacket in Forest Green or Tan, Biker style Suede Jacket in Mustard or Tan and anything Pearl Embellished! 🤗 I love the Leaves scent by Bath & Body Works and Sweater Weather but we can't get them in Ireland! Oh & L'Occitane Almonde Body Oil for the win.😘
Just saw a bunch of olive green booties at dsw today!!
when she held up the Nars blush & I thought it was a elf blush 😭
I love you Casey! 😂
Marshmallow Fireside is THE BEST!! I even use the wallflower in my closet😋Love Fall and all your favorites. 🍁💕💕💕🍁
I post three times a week and... I love fall 😂😂😂 AND IM DYING TO TRY THAT HOURGLASS FOUNDATION. 😭😭😭 That Nars blush has got me feeling some type of way too. I'd love to get some more liquid lips, but that's like the last thing I need. 😂😂
Seriously loved this video! I love fall.
I went to bath & body works last weekend and finally smelled marshmallow fireside for the first time and it smells soo good... I should have bought a couple lol
I need to go candle shopping!
Girl. At the end of the year bath and body works has a sale for all three wick candles are 8.50. Yes you read that right 8 dollars and 50 cents!!!!!!! They normally limit you 15 per customer in store only. I went last year and I thought I was going to die.
Casey you seem so chill and awesome like I wish we could just hang out and go shopping one day lol
Yes.....keep doing these, don't mind the longer videos🙌🏼
I'm all about olive this fall too!!! Great minds girl! ⭐🍁🍂🍃🍂🍃🍂🍁⭐
OMG is it weird most of these are my fav things? I feel like we just became best friends 👯
Yaaaay for Gucci guilty 😍 it's so amazing 🙂
YA GIRL GOT THE SILICONE WEDDING BAND 👀👀👀👀
Dude. Marshmallow Fireside is hands down THE BEST candle scent that exists. Period!
Anyone think of butts when she said booty.....no one... ok just me.
Yes! I love these videos Casey they do feel like old school YouTube. You should do them more often.
I'll be your best friend 🙋🏼
The shades in that Natasha Denona palette 😍 Loved this Casey! xx
there's some cute olive green booties on 6pm.com !!
Can you do a review on the fenty foundation
I love the color of the top you have on! Lovin that eyeshadow look too! ☺️
I LOVE THIS TYPE OF VIDEO😍
I love how this video is a mix of everything not just makeup 👌
I come alive in the fall time.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     ~the weekend
Can you please do this again for like winter??
Marshmallow fireside and Leaves... the only two fall candles I'll ever need 💓
Need more OG videos like these!!!
Can you please tell us how you keep your hair so healthy!
What ring is that? Is that one of those silicon ones? If so, do you like it?
Just because of the thumbnail, I'm commenting. I LOVE IT.
Hi Casey!! What's a good drugstore foundation brush dupe?
Oh my gosh yes! Those Barefoot Dreams sweaters are so worth the splurge! They sell an actual robe I want to get for the winter. (: <3
I guess I'm going to Forever 21 next payday. You give the best recommendations Casey
Could you do a cruelty free makeup look please?
The Peaches & Cream matte palette is so good! It doesn't look special,  but creates the most beautiful looks. I am so glad I picked it up ❤️
casey DSW has a brand called Crown Vintage and they have the cutest high quality booties at a pretty good price and they have olive ones!
I'm so ready for warm fall colors! I'll be heading to H&M and Forever 21 for some pretty autumn prints. My new favorite candles from Bath & Body Works are Bourbon Maple and Pumpkin Pecan Waffle!
Thanks for candle ideas.  Great video.
Love videos like this. Thanks for sharing!
she always calls those palettes 'made for matte' but they're called 'mad for matte'
Casey do you subscribed to any boxes? If so which ones? Please don't say Fab Fit Fun 😐
Loved this video! Bring on fall!🍂 loved your clothing items!
Haven't watched it yet and want to assume I have none of this
Casey can you start adding food stuff you're liking in your regular favorite videos?
Winter is coming! Yes!
Casey! Will you please do a tutorial/first impressions on kara brooks 3D beauty palates called maskara beauty!
What shirt are you wearing in this video? Looks super comfy ☺️
YOOOOOO THEY GOT CHOMP WASH THAT WAS MY GAME (Edit: They better have the soda one from Mario Party 8 too)
No it needs to be on the switch we don't have Mario part on switch yet
time for a real wario ware game though
that is so cool!
Every single time, I'll pick Yoshi
Sooo why isn't there a switch edition? Lol
N O S T A L G I A
I wish they still did games for Wii U :(
I hope platform peril is on here! !!
I want the fun run minigame
Shut up and take my money!
I haven't bought a Mario Party game since Island Tour. I'm really interested in buying this.
That is a awesome game
I would have someone to play this 😍
top 100 o my god
I NEED THIS GAME!
What about Mario party DS minigames you have to include Mario party DS like if you agree
NOOoOOOOSSSSSTTTTTaAAaAAAaALLLGGGIIAAaAAAAaAA
Yo that suit Mario's wearing in the end, can he wear that in Odyessey. He'd look pretty snazzy :)
I want Aces High from Mario Party 3, who's with me?
Why why for nintendo 3ds\nWhy not for nintendo switch >:(
No more crappy car from Mario Party 9 and 10, i want the original soundtracks and old party stages
I can't wait to play it, it look so much fun.
Your advertised party multiplayer console, the Switch, doesnt get the multiplayer party game......yeah right....
I wonder if you can use amiibo on this game
And switch please
o my its looks amazing i am so exited ！！！！！！！！！！！！！
Some of these mini games are NOT worthy of the top 100. But I saw Bumper Balls, so all is forgiven. But I sure wish this was a Switch game instead. I'm still waiting for a Mario Party game that features every board, and every mini game from the entire series.
SO  THEY TOOK 10 MINIGAMES FROM EVERY SERIES (1-10)
Fight pub  yfucko
yes!!!
I'm so exited Nintendo
Okay but is the board game going to be garbage again like in 9 and 10?
Why is this not a Switch title?
Needs to be for switch
Now all we need is for this to be on the switch
Please bring this to the switch
There's a switch for a reason
this is gonna be an actual mario party game right? not just a minigame collection?
I wish Mario Party DS mini games were included
put it on switch you bafoons
Mario party 11...? by Hudson soft?
minecraft, mario top 100, now I need a sports basketball game on 3ds than im set on 3ds
Nostalgia It's Over 9000!
I'm surprised that this game looks good but I'm also suprised that they didn't have time to make MARIO PARTY 11
The rage that will come from the game
Wouldn't it be awesome if Koopa Kid made a return?
If we're being honest here, I agree with TheBitBlock that they should've done a poll for the community to vote.\n\nAlso, they should release this on both the 3DS and the Switch, because the 3DS version looks like it takes too many assets from Star Rush. Also, it's the 3DS, which has inferior graphics.
I better see Dungeon Duos in the game 😩
I think Hudson has the rights for the mechanics of the previous Mario Party Games (1 to 8)
what about Mario party 11 for Nintendo switch
I hope boo is a playable character
But you have to wonder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did they choose just 100 minigames from Mario Parties 1-10?
Is it just minigames? Or is there boards too?
I like the idea, but why put it on the 3ds?
This will be the best mario party game ever
i would buy it
Yay, another hellish game Nintendo created to split friendships worldwide!
But do they have DS minigames
Why can't they just release Odyssey on the 3DS?
Bring it to the Switch.
PUT IT ON THE SWITCH WTF
Why is this not on the Switch? I ain't buying this for the 3DS, I wanna play this with my friends.
*sighs* ..... can there PLEASE be wifi this time? No? Well make sure to do it for the next Mario Party game on the Switch!
This is the biggest disappointment of the Nintendo Direct video. It really sucks that this is on the 3DS rather than the Switch. Would be a lot more fun, enjoyable, and comfortable to be able to play on a TV screen with friends. My friends and I like to play 50 turn games. That will not be good to play on a 3DS. The Switch would make a lot more since for this game.
Any chance we can get a Mario Party for Switch? I'm really looking forward to one!
Gotta love the loads of people that have no idea what they're talking about.
Playable roster: probably the same as star rush's
Why not make a classic or as we say it: GOOD, Mario Party with the remade minigames on the Switch
As an owner of mario party 8, seeing crank to rank made me happy, but at the same time have veitnam flashbacks...\nmy arms just hurts thinking about it...
Release this on Switch -.-. The 3ds is dead.
Mario Party 11 For Nintendo Switch! Who's with me?
Please oh PLEASE bring King of the Thrill from Mario Party 8
Plz make this for the switch
Hello Nintendo I'm a big big fan of super Mario I hope you coment me
Is toadette in there plz of not I'll be sad
It feels great to recognize most of these, I squealed a lot during this. Finally looking forward to Mario Party again.
*_ITS TIME TO STOP_*
So this is just minigames? :/
How about the Nintendo switch?
Yes. I will probably get this over the holidays.
is this to a mario party with stars and playboard and a story?
Seems pretty cool! It's nice seeing these old games back :)
Nice
This better have hexagon heat
Who else misses 8 player mini games?
Oh my god. They brought back Face Lifters. I can't wait for hideously deformed Bowser faces in glorious 3DS graphics!
ラインナップ見てると半分は思いっきりやってた奴やから感動する
Heat Stroke will be in this, calling it right now.
Come To The SWITCH. Thumbs Ups Boys / Gals... Thumbs Up !
Yyyyeeeesssssss
No DS love?
Plesseee traigan este juego pra la nintendo switch
Thank you Nintendo
This is throwback!
Nintendo this is Awesome

Hey Angelica my dear what you have done to me... I'm addicted to your songs... I've converted this video to mp3 and had played only this song along with Clarity during my road trip for 8 hours... the more I listened the more I liked it... prayerfully may you will be the winner... though you are already a superstar...
Plese angelica sing greatest love of all in the finals😊
waiting for her album..
Her superb voice quality matches the amazing stage design behind her. I thought I was watching a concert. 😍
Oh my word I am blown to pieces with Angelica Hale everytime I watch her and listen to her beautiful huge voice I cry with joy Angel you have a beautiful amazing voice God Bless you and hope you strive to higher goals and you will definately reach the top baby girl go for it  you can do it my fingers are crossed
just you wait when she adds growl in her next performances haha
My daddy said that wow she is just a kid how can she uses different techniques in this song.
I have never had such long goosebumps for like minutes!!
That note at 1:30! Amazing kid!
Wow this is #4 #trending youtube. Can't  wait to see our lovely angel in the Finale 😍 👏  you win it in our 💕 hearts.
She should sing Halo for the finals
I hope she wins
This is perhaps the greatest vocal performance I have ever seen.
She deserve to win , she is an angel
Wow. Her voice is so beautiful 😭😍
Moana needs to step-up her game. This one was a little shaky.
she will win i think
i hope you become the next whitney houston... my goodness
Angelica, you are my angel. Your songs always touch my heart and become a bless. My friends and I listen to your songs every day. I am sure everyone who perform in AGT is great, but you are the greatest. Whatever you are going to be, always give your song to become a bless to everyone. Don't care about the haters. Haters are haters. They will always see you in different sides. They choose their life for that. They just wanted to show how they care to their favorite one, or if they do not have any in AGT, probably they are created as people who dislike you because lotsa people love you.  So, Use them as your strength to give the best to your fans. Angelica, you are already the winner. Good luck for the next performance. Greetings from Indonesia.
Has anyone noticed the symbols in her background (alien like faces in-between spears) especially at the beginning? What could they possibly mean? I would like to interpret it this way - we're in for another treat, another spectacular and ethereal performance of Angelica and we're all going to be slayed again!
That was a fantastic performance
The caption under my thumbnail said Angelica Hale: 10-Year-Old Singer Blows The Audience....I was like 😮
I really hope either u or darci wins this
Love this little girl . Hoping she wins it all
You don't to have feel sad for Celine want she showed her self in this show and people will totally invest in her America will make Celine a star believe in me
Not that good but very good for age of 10. Cheers
I'm gonna eat my shoes If Angelica Hale and  Darci Lynne do not win this season.
She is my favorite @EvieClair @AngieGreen @AngelicaHale @CelineTam @DarciLynne @MandyHarvey my favorite AGT acts!
VOTE FOR AGELICA HALE!SHE IS AMAZING AND HER VOICE IS SO INCREDIBLE! VOTE VOTE VOTE FOR HER!!!!❤❤❤
I want Angelica, Darcie, and Mandy to be the last three, then Angelica to win!
My role model is smaller than me😃you go girl😘
before the video, there was an advertisement of the iPhone 8, and I was like, WOW OMG now, listening to Angelica's beautiful voice, I was shook, SHE'S SO GOOD SHES BETTER THAN IPHONE 8 A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER
Refreshing to listen and admire such great talent
She's better than Celine but i love both of them so much!! The high notes is killing me rn HAHAHA 😂💖

She's a superstar.😄
Angelica.Your song is very fantastic. You are powerful, beautiful and have a good voice. I like your voice so much. And you are so pretty and so cute and lovely.\nAngelica fighting!Good luck
They should change the title from America's Got Talent to Angelica's Got Talent (-_-)  Give me a thumbs up if you liked the new title <3 <3 <3

She is SO GOOD!!!!!!
angelica is so much better than celine. this kid will go big, more famous than justin bieber before the age 13 let me tell u
someday it's gonna be American kid's got talent!!!
I love both of them: Celine and Angelica. They have magical voices at their age. They are the gifts from God. In the first time, I felt in love with Celine because of the high notes she showed in My heart will go on. I prefered her performance than Angelica's. But when I heard Clarity, I knew that where my heart was following. Angelica is so amazing. She not only brings us good skills and powerful voice but also the feeling in her songs she sings. Try your best! my young lady. <3
want extra income try this link http://MoneyComeFirst.com/?ref=35487
She is a human launchpad
This has been my favorite performance. Happy birthday Angelica!
I can't stop watching you. Help meeeeee
Wow.... She's is not child. Music.... Music.... Music....
I want to meet her so badly in person! I've already met her vocal coach and my cousin has sang with her before!
i think the lyric was...\n\n\n\n\nWITHOUT YOU!!!!!!
This will definitely define the word chills that we feel. Angelica is truly an angel.
i don't agree with you that how far i'll go could be her winning song . its too easy for her and the people may not be amazed by this simple song. but i agree with you that angelica can transform an easy song to make it the hard one. she can showcase her vocal prowess by her own way. and that shook me always. for her age, her vocal range and ability is too far from her actual age and that is so unbelievable. she is pretty amazing.\nREPLY
Every time I listen to Angelica I think she is an angel sent from GOD . Her voice is angelic , perfect
0:06: ''I will never win this game''\nANGELICA, ARE YOU SURE? :D
ANGELICA HALE NEEDS TO DO CHANDELIER BY SIA IN THE FINALS OML YES!!!
U r killin' it, Angelica, u r my fav in agt! Hope u can win! U r amazing! <3 ya

OMG- she looks different
Wow she is you amaaaaaaazing
wow.
Itong Video Na To Or Video Na To! ;) \nhttps://youtu.be/0UQnoq0W2iY
Who Knows... Maybe One Day She'll Have Her Own Concert... if that happens, it won't be so surprising...
This girl is too overrated. Pitchy all over the place. For her age she is prob one of the best around, but seriously her techniques has too develop.
Proud pinoy here lols
I like this performance, but I don't like the way she pronounced you as yoh
Lmao wtf is this though
This really is cringe worthy. Future sounds extra robotic singing next to Cher 😨 It just does not sound right!!
this is actually a great idea for the gap especially since the gap was always supposed to represent the bridging of two generations. that's why they sell seemingly regular clothing that elders wear but often have a young flare to them
Hey the King and Queen of Auto-Tune lol....
WTF !!!!! Hahahahha future
Omg I love this😍😍😍😍
Genius....
Damn her voice is deep af
She looks stunning than ever, this woman is eternal 💙
I can't stop watching this
Cher is Dope! Future in this Ad....Ummmm NOT! I just don't like Dude! But, Cher All Day!
she knew exactly what to do with that beat. cher is amazing !
I don't know who the hell Future is but I feel like he doesn't even know the words to the song until Cher sang them and he just copied.
the king and queen of autotune
Cher got the wagon
LOVE IT!! /
but why though.. lmaooo
Only here cuz Zaytoven made the beat
This is autotuned to hell. I don't want to have to listen to their trashy voices everytime I watch a video.
Cher I love you!!!3!;;❤❤❤❤❤
I read a comment about Gap bridging two generations together and I instantly thought although they sell everyday clothing they sfill keep it looking hip. I feel like Cher and Future were supposed to represent that that look. Yeah? No? Lol idk just a thought
beat????
That entrance tho!!! Yasss Queen you betta werk!!! 😍😘❤❤❤
I think thier going to make good music together
Whoever wrote this song needs a new job
Why isn't this a full song?
Two different generations combining making a masterpiece
Idol meets Icon...great marketing Gap. ❤️ it.
Mi Diosa tan bella😍
CHER ,THE GODDESS
Its obvious Future is paying tribute to the Godmother of autotune. Before Tpain and Future it was Cher. Those down south autotune rappers look up to Cher
Wow! Chad Michaels can sing to now
all i see in this commercial are the first 2 seconds lol
I didn't know that Thing 1 could sing.
I can't believe this is the finished commercial - I adore Cher & I think they could have chemistry, but like this? No.
Yikes. That did not work. Like, at all.
Cher got cake
so cringe, #neverbuyingfromgap
When I first seen this I was like wtf did I just watch.. now I'm loving this and need to hear a full version.
im not finna play future u better have gotten hella money for this.
Cher make another CD plssss
Qué bonita Cher
People who hate on this commercial why go on this video and comment about it ?
someone send kathy griffin into chers attic to see if there is some dorian grey-esque painting up in there.
Future...you don't have auto tune naturally coming out your voice box bro.
I came here from a different  video because I thought future was singing  with a transgender  woman  🤦🏽
DISCOMBOBULATING
Cher kinda thick
LEGENDS
Cher went off!
WTF💀
Cher plz record this song!!!!
aaaahhhhh too much autotune.....it hurts my ears!!
Zaytoven 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Awesome
I was here.
love it.
Dunno whats more fake, chers face or futures voice...
future meet future (..she will never die)
What a great out-of-the-box pairing. Love this commercial.
WHO ELSE GOT THIS ON LOOP
Reaction video uploading !
I hate this.
my ears are shitting blood
No joke this bout to be a fucking challege....everybody remember the barney theme song and the little einsteins. I just can't. Shooketh.
THIS IS SO GOOD WTF..... and no i'm not trolling.... i LOVE good music
LMAO WTF IS THIS
Cringe af
Where is the long form version of the song.
Love both of them.
I LOVE THIS...CHER IS SUCH A COOL BEAN...AWESOME💋❤
They look way too good for this Gap commercial. But I love Cher and Future
God please see it I never see but most importantly never to hear that noise ever again. Start to finish all wrong and why you thought you wanna pan in closer to a 70+ is beyond forgivable.
Do you believe in lean after love 🎤😭
Yes, that is Cher's🍑in the beginning. I loved this. Cher and Future!!🙌👏
I really wish this beat had an instrumental.
Wow!😐 but I ❤ it
A recap for context: I caught this as a Spotify commercial, and it was so disruptive I put on my todo list find the Gap on YouTube to tell them to stop it.\nPlease, never do this again.\nPlease...
For a little french like me ... very ivonic, supernatural. A : this is america video ^^
This is such a weird combination but I absolutely love it. Thank you, Gap!
Cher's face doesn't move from all the plastic surgery. What an ugly freak.
Who allowed this?
bad
Sweat shop manufacturing trying to clean up its image with a woman that's got more stitches than a pair of jeans. Oh, this world is so predictable. Sell out celebs
CHER IS SO AMAZING. 71 😍 and 🔥
OG auto-tune with new school auto-tune. love it
It's moments like this that confirms the theory that we're all dead but actually stuck into an alternate dimension.
This was definitely produced by Zaytoven
Classic meets Current.  And Classic IS current!  Cher forever.  Love Future, too.
I've been reading a lot about how this song is ... insert negative comments about Future, Cher's looks, the use of the song. You get my drift.\n\nI am very much behind the intent of this campaign and I enjoy its imperfections. It's about everyday people. Look beyond the capitalism and think - with all the ugly in the world. It's nice to see old and new come together and just be people.\n\nFor those who would criticize the use of a Sly and the Family Stone song. When are y'all going to understand how public domain is supposed to work? Wow thanks Walt Disney, the world doesn't understand how we as a community, a culture, as people evolve.
Too much autotune in 30 secs
Chad Michaels doing really well for himself
Amazing!!!! She looks amazing and  is a major player in music history. But with this ad, she is ensuring her stamp on pop culture remains in people's radar today and in the future.
She sounds like a dude
Horrible! Who is that dumb guy that tried to sing? Lol
...was he trying to say meet me in the gap at the end of just having a small stroke?
Too much trap and auto-tune. 😒
This is so fucking cringey.
Honestly one of the best ads I've seen in a while
Guys please if everyone donates something we can get him off the street. I dont have much myself and know how its like. go to his go fund me\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/helpanthonyoffthestreet

Floyd I wanna do a boxing with you smh I will win :) come on
Floyd mayweather's actually really funny hahah I didn't know
This shit wasn't funny usually your vids are funny
Jesus whats happening to me im turning into a conspiracy theorist... but so many references in his words to reptilian illuminati.. fav color green... he mentioned lucky number 7.. he got beady eyes.. he said he is too smooth skinned for hair..\n\nalso do you notice the racial undertone here? black man and hispanic man getting along talking about beating mcgregor. it was a mexican and black man who beat him. \n\ntell me somebody else notices this shit!
Hollywood should turn this into a movie, like Ted. Only with both of these guys.
Great stuff- Everyone should know this floyd...
This was fucking brilliant jesus christ...
That fight wasn't worth $100, but this interview sure was.
Boxing legend meets a puppet......has that not been already????

How did you get him to give you a interview?
I tried that one time and she punched me harder than u punched McGregor Lol 😂😂😂
Mayweather is the MAN! Bless him and his family.
I bet the puppet could beat Pac-Man

Is it Rudy mancuso playing the puppet?
I can't tell whose faking
Floyd is not a bad person after all but why are there a lot of people hate him?
I thought you didn't drink?
This the Floyd people need to know, the real Floyd

Max Landis made me interested in Carly's music. The guy is insane
OHYMGOD love the part when she's on the black star stage thing and THE LIGHTS ARE FLASHING AND AHHHH THE HYPE
Sorry but I did not like it
Number #1 in MY Heart
Isn't this song from the movie Ballerina??? (At the end)
I love you so so much💘💖💖 From VietNam💓💓
so sad she's so underrated, this song is better than Katy's Swish Swish. like if you agree
watched those kids dance in a series of videos so 🔥🔥🔥🔥
With this hair, she looks so much like Michelle Williams.
This is so amazing!
Hard to think this is the same girl who sang call me maybe :O
i miss her old hair
When she said When this song fails, i make a good coffee, i wana laugh yet feel sorry for her at the same time. Her songs in Emotions such as Run Away With me and etc has not been getting enough credits. Hope im not seeing her in working Starbucks anytime in the future><
I thought she only made one song and it was HAI I JOST MET YEW song =\
Saw this song carly from icarly can sing :o *checks face* RIP.............NICE song tho :P
am I getting a Madona  vibe from this song?! \nomg love it!
this remind me so much of a coke commercial 🙄
What she is saying to me is you can't box her.....love the new look and sound!
Was hoping this song was gonna be the lead single off an upcoming album! Would've made a great lead to an awesome album!
I feel like after EMOTION you were so underrated and I am so happy Spotify recommended this in my playlist.
wait she is not in a contract?
Queen of literally everything
This is one of my most fave songs from Emotion Side B+ and now it has a video! So cool.
Best song of 2017, hands down.
Omg she looks like the waitress from it's always sunny in Philadelphia with that hair!!
😊😊❤️❤️❤️Carly I love you 😍 😍😍new look ,very very very beautiful!!!!!!!!!
I'm missed her,, remember I'm pregnant Tom Hanks like Ohhkay just Kidding
Can someone explain me why she's too underrated?
I was so happy to hear they playing this song at the malls :))
is it just me or does she looks exactly like The Waitress in this video?
Best song ever just click one'shttps://youtu.be/4no34ysa0hE

Jemma is it possible that your brownie recipe can become the crust for a blueberry cheesecake?\n\nIf its possible can you teach me how? <3
dear Jemma I'm a HUGE fan and always make an effort to go to crumbs and doilies when in London because I'm from Birmingham but sadly I'm in year 6 at school so if by any chance you could try and o it on a weekend I would be honoured to meet you in person if not no probs and I hope it goes perfectly for you \na GINORMOUS cupcake Jemma fan:)
Thought the announcement would be you were engaged hence the beautiful ring on your finger ...
Hi jemma how are you! Hope you doing well this is minhaz from botswana which is in the continent africa, i looooovvvveee ur recipes so much and they always come out amazing, i use your lemon curd recipe all the time and i also tried your doughnuts, they were so good. Could you please share a recipe on how to make a rose and pistachio cake or cupcakes . Thank you
Can you use a multiple ring tin with removable bottoms?
Awwww man, I'm in the USA, can't get there 😂
In July I visited your shop and it was honestly such a highlight of my trip overseas. I bought your book and I have been baking from it since I got back 😊 my pick at the moment is the  cardamom, lime and pistachio cake! Can't wait till I get to visit your shop again ...love from Australia 🐨🐨
i think the mixer broke
I’d love to come, but I’ve got school 😕\n\nI’ll definitely be attempting to make these at some point!!

What tins is she using? So beautiful?
I would love to come but i live in Malaysia 😭😭😭to whoever that able to meet Jemma this Monday,please send my regards to her😞
Can any kind soul advise on the longevity of the Italian Meringues? Like, how long can it be left in the open/airtight container? I've read somewhere that advised against chilling it as it adds moisture. Thanks in advance!
Cannot hear mention of a baked alaska without thinking of that one GBBO episode ...
I'll just swim across the canal than, kisses from Belgium
I live in germany so I dont think I can come ;) still... someday Ill definetly will fly to London and eat one of your cakes or cupcakes. Stupid as it may sound, its one of my goals for the next years :)

This looks absolutely divine!! Why can't there be a CDS in Connecticut! :(  how delicious is this! Im craving it so much lol
Burnt marshmallows are the best smell ever.
If only I wasn't living on the other side of the world in a totally different hemisphere. Oh wells. Hope you come down to this side of the world soon!!!
Wish you make your square cake one Thursday xx
The one week I leave london this whole summer... Guess we're cutting this trip short.
Hi Jemma. Can you store those in the freezer for a couple hours before serving or does the meringue crumble/fall together in the cold?
I enjoyed your background music today.
Can you do a French or Italian macarons recepie
Wish I could come on Monday, don't even live that far but it's GCSE year and I've got tuition so I can't make it 😭😭😭

If we don't have blowtorches is there an alternative
If you wanted to make these for a party, how much could you do ahead ? Can you do it all and keep it refrigerated?
That Cupcake Jemma apron behind you is so pretty!
Am I the only one who thinks this is really good?
Man, this is awful.
Remember everything that made Back to the Shack and the White Album great?\n\nNeither does Rivers.
Much better than the last two singles in my opinion!
not a good song.. idk why singers i like say they like weezer
This doesn't even sound like The Beach Boys! :(
let me just say this for everyone SHUT UP AND ENJOY THE SONG!
Makes a rainy day shine.
Last few songs have been okay but after the White Album my expectations were really high!! So far I'm slightly disappointed...
This is fully awful and it's all the more painful off the back of how amazing White Album was.
LOVE THE NEW SONG, I WANT THE ALBUM NOW!
It's growing on me...
This is an insult to Weezer and The Beach Boys
jesus christ the lyrics.
This song has no soul
Not once have i ever heard a Weezer song one time, I refuse to ever listen to this garbage again, fucking awful,
N o T h a n k Y o u . . . . .
Beach Boys = Pacific Nightmare.   Turn it down.....
They should leave the beach music to the Beach Boys
Walking with the Mexicans \nShould I call an ambulance\n\nReally, Rivers? \n\n\n\n\nBecause I would would have called ICE
This album is gonna suck.
Well that was awful.
This song is awful! What happened?
Oh!  First single since they started that I haven't instantly liked. Hopefully grow on me\n.
I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with Weezer. They made me fall in love with them for 7 years then they started beating me. They'd apologize and buy me flowers and I'd believe them...until the next album when they pushed me down the stairs. And I'd keep coming home to them. And they would apologize, and I'd take them back. This time though, I'm finally packing and leaving. It's been a long 24 years, but all good things come to an end.
My first ever hit of The Beach Boys. Combined with a werewolf. What's not to love?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeVEbbheUck
I was hoping it would sound like the Beach Boys - like Surf Wax America sort of did....
ugh...make believe had like three good songs on it...after that--it's just sad. sorry.
RIP the time you could say new Weezer is as good as their old stuff 2014-2016
This is the same band that made Everything Will Be Alright in the end 3 years ago? \nDisappointed...
Its a bit like raditude
How do you go from white to this in 1 year?\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to disagree
Rivers does it again.
I wasn't even born when The Blue Album and Pinkerton came out, but I'm still hoping for another Pinkerton. That is the greatest album to one of my favorite bands that I've ever listened to. I can relate to each song perfectly. These new songs are too much like every other song playing nowadays, no real instruments or deep lyrics. Just random noises and lyrics put together into random places. I want the Weezer with the guitar solos and Rivers' personal lyrics. It's a lot more relatable than the music they're making now. I'll always support them, but I wish they'd go back to the good music.
it's not terrible
Well, I like it. Turn it up, it's weezer!
While this isn't the greatest song Weezer has ever released, there is no denying this is catchy af.
Man. He's really figured out how to make efficient and catchy songs.
My eyes get moist with your tribute song!!!
how you gonna make a song called beach boys without sick harmonies
it's alright. i guess.
I don't understand the comments praising this song. I love Weezer to death but as soon I clicked the play button I felt my life force being drained by how utterly boring and predictable this song is. Not to mention some of these lyrics, christ.
I like the Beach Boys sounding part in the second part of the chorus.
So after two decent rock records were back at Ratitude. DAMN YOU Weezer.
ughhh. Foo fighters and Mastodon release awesome albums and Weezer release this. Forget this and go listen to Mastodons new EP; its epic.
Everytime I think Weezer can't come up with a more cringeworthy chorus than Beverly Hills, they release a new song and I realize it's been going downward for more than a decade now. I mean, seriously? Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys? Jesus Christ. So bad. Well, there will always be Blue, Pinkerton, and Green for me.\n\nP.S.: Yes, White had some good moments. That's it though.
I can't believe ... Why they released a song in 2014 saying I forgot that disco sucks ??? It is all lie... Unfortunatelly, I have concluded that =w= is a fake band... they made blue and pinkerton because grunge at that time was yet strong... if disco was strong  at that time, there would not be blue nor pinkenton, but raditude and things like that... sad to say that, but it is true...
Rivers is trolling us all again
It's different, I like it
Would like old Weezer sound to come back tbh
Once they release an acoustic version everyone will like it, just watch.
TURN IT UP, IT'S THE BEACH BOOOYS\n\nMost obnoxious chorus Weezer has made in a while.
I love Weezer, I love summer, but why do they only make music for this season??
Verse makes up for the chorus, honestly not a bad song, just give it a second listen.
The chorus, to me, is an nice and interesting little tribute. And did any of you catch a couple small Murry Wilson interludes (obviously reenacted)? I did and noticed them right away at first listen. (Murry was the father of the Beach Boys' Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson.)
The chorus is like an anti-commercial. If The Beach Boys weren't already one of my favorite bands ever, I would've been turned off from them forever.\n\nBut regardless, the verses and bridge are nice, and I'll still be crankin' dem Beach Boys at the end of the day.
it's a hip hop world\n\njust kill me
This is chill... I love it
This isn't bad, it's just bland, it's so mediocre, it's plain old pop. If I wasn't told it was Weezer I wouldn't know it was them. I'm not asking for another Pinkerton, so tired of people saying that, but even Maladroit and stuff from Red blows this away. I'll take Miss Sweeney or Burndt Jamb over this any day.
Wood wee I dress just like The Beach Boys
This is just really disappointing, their last 3 singles have all been bad!
The verses have nothing to do with The Beach Boys.
As a single, yeah, this is weak. Moist makes me uncomfortable. But this is the same band that at one point put out Pinkerton. So like, maybe the uncomfort is intentional?
Very cool song! Show the Beach Boys some (Mike) love... they helped pioneer Americana rock and got kicked (unfairly) into the nostalgia circuit - for what, not playing for some pot head hippies at Monterey? - despite their 50+ years of recording and touring. Summer's (not!) Gone :)
Good. Not as good as Feels Like Summer which is excellent but much better than Mexican Fender which is a bit throwaway. New album will probably be OK but I loved White so will probably feel a little let down. We'll see I guess!
This track is big step backwards for weezer specially when you look at the quality that was EWBAITE and white.
It is a hip hop world isn't it weezer
Guys, it isn't bad! \n\n\n\n\nBut it's not good either.
I like the little jab at Murry Wilson
Is it just me or has Rivers been playing it way too safe for a bit too long now?\nI mean, the music is good. It won't ever not be good. As a whole they're too smart and talented to not produce tunes that are going to make us bob our heads.\nBut it's just the safest music. They're not taking any risks anymore, and due to this, imo, they are lacking the passion that originally brought us to their table.
THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!  What an excellent chorus - a real cool ode to Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys!!!  Sweet tune!  Thanks Weezer!!
I get some rhcp vibes with the guitar.
I cant wait for the official acoustic version of this
Hate to say it but it's looking like this is the first Weezer album I pass on, absolutely terrible! !!!!
It'll grow on us. Like Thank God for Girls.
Hey, weren't these the guys that made the blue and white albums and Pinkerton
=w=
ugh
love it!
Una de mis bandas favorita haciendo una cancion sobre otra de mis bandas favoritas, son lo mejor!! los amooooo, y a los beach boys tambien <3<3
HOLY HECK YES
Cancer

Much.  Better
weezer はスゴイですね。
Here at 46k
Genius!
Mexican fender was alright, but this.. Idk.
Radi2de?
Love love love it!
NEVER FORGET PINKERTON
Pros: Scott's Bass\nCons: chorus.
ahh!! beautiful
JUST
This is awful
A nationwide campaign is underway to nominate The Beach Boys for our nation’s highest civilian honor, The Medal of Freedom.

It grows on you, but the lyrics are still weird. Makin' my eyes get moist.
Weezer just might be the worst band ever.

Such a beautiful video
The main dancer is amazing, beautifully danced and told the story so incredibly well. Amazing song, amazing video.\n(P.S. All the product placement for Puma has made me not want to buy into their brand)
lyrics, in case you wanna see the video and sing the song at the same time :\n\nI wonder, maybe they'd never find me\nI've been waitin' such a long, long, long time to feel it\nSwallowed by the waters around me\nThough I took so many wrong, wrong, wrong turns to see it, woah\n\nBut I dance through the blisters at night\nAnd I laughed 'til I cried and cried and\nI ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)\nAnd I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'\n'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah\nI'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more\n\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah\nUntil the sun goes up\nAnd I feel my love comin' up again\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd the dark is gone\nWe made it to the dawn and I don't miss you anymore\nWhen the sun comes up\nI can feel my love comin' back again\n\nIt wasn't easy tryin' to run with these handcuffs\nI had to sleep through such a cold, cold, cold night to see it\nGreen flashes hit me right where I'm standing\nSunlight cut into your bones, bones, bones, started to heal it\n\nOh, oh, I danced through the blisters at night\nAnd I laughed 'til I cried and cried and\nI ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)\nAnd I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'\n'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah\nI'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more\n\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah\nUntil the sun goes up\nAnd I feel my love comin' up again\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd the dark is gone\nWe made it to the dawn and I don't miss you anymore\nWhen the sun comes up\nI can feel my love comin' back again\n\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nGive a little light (won't you give it?)\nTo get a little love back (give your love back)\nGive a little light (won't you give it?)\nTo get a little love back (shine your light on me)\nGive a little light (give a little, to get a little love)\nTo get a little love back (to get a little love back)\nGive a little light (to get a little love back)\n\nOh, dance through the blisters at night\nI laughed 'til I cried and cried and\nI ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)\nI sang 'til my lungs were burnin'\nI'm alive, alive\nI can't hear words no more\n\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love\nSun comes up again, my love\nUntil the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love comin' up again (I feel my love)\nI can feel my love, I can feel my love\n\nSun comes up\nI can feel my love comin' back again

I don't usually leave comments under YouTube videos but Rudimental, you have done me so proud. The video is absolutely outstanding. Superb. Exactly how I depicted it in my mind. How is that even possible. Not many songs strike up so much emotion within me, thank you for being you, Rudimental❤️
this song makes me feel happy....thanks rudimental and james arthur your awesome
Best feature... So in love
this song is everything
love this video for the song!!!
To all deejays, please don't make a remix of this song, you can't do better.
Bizarre. I love James Arthur and Rudimental, why take down a multi=million watched site, to replace it with this meaningless offering.
Whaaat?!? James Arthur & Rudimental!! I'm in love 😍😍😍
Omg love this song so much 😘❤❤
The best song ever 😍💞
Beautiful song it's my jam right now! 😍 so powerful and it lifts my mood every time I hear it x
I spent 3 weeks trying to find this song. i did finally. Shazam to the rescue
Saw James live recently and he was absolutely AMAZING. Watching him perform and hearing him sing blew me away. Turned me into even more of a fan than I was before. Love this song, what a great collaboration! :)
Someone needs to sing this on x factor.
1:39 One of the men,  were Phil Selway.
Felt like the winter soldier when all the business men came in the elevator.
good song. gentle but strong sound.
this is video art and the song is just 'elevator' music
radiohead is the best band  :)
I love you Radiohead.
why he got plastic bags instead of re-useabe shopping bags?
I really love how this video looks like from the 90's or early 2000's , I was born in 1999 and i'm about to turn 18, I'm young but I prefer old classic rock music, instead of what today's people call music they don't know nothing.  I wish that people who lived teenhood during the 80's or 90's knew how lucky they are,  let's keep rock music alive everyone!
Radiohead is always good.  I was needed to hear this... thank you Radiohead. With love from Brazil. ♥
Did Thom do his own stunts for this?
He ain't in a lift, he's in a limousine. Lol
Хрень какая то, про что клип?
Radiohead and Hans Zimmer are working together on a track!
I love the references to other music videos. Love letter to the fans.
Thom is the antagonist of the rockstar cliché
Reminds me of Smashing Pumpkins
💕
Roblox the normal elevator boys.
90s radiohead is back
I wasn't reasy
awesome!!!!
Thanks Radiohead
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddd
OHMUHGODFINALLY
I like it very much
note that he is going down. maybe he is symbolically coming down to earth.
This song is so beautiful. I NEVER WRITE COMMENTS. BUT FUCK this song is very pretty. *sighs*
If you loo at the floor number once it gets to floor 01 it flickers and changes to 'OK'
What about people whose eyes are glued to a little screen?
I DONT GET IT
Wow
In the belly of a whale .......
The kid from paranoid android made my fucking day
I love the way camera shakes at the end it's so befitting
Is that Flo from the Progressive adverts @ 3:26?
That Building were to dammit tall
Notice how the elevators changes to OK for a sec when he gets to the number 01
Who is the guy in the torn dirty clothes
Ok so as I can gather from the comments, this video has a lot of references to other radiohead's videos: the old man is the karma police dude, one of the girls in the beginning is picking a fake plastic tree, there's the guy from the paranoid android video, the dancers are from the street spirit video, the kid is from high and dry.\nI think  the video might be about thom going through different stages of radiohead's career. It makes sense too because the other two last videos, as some people in the comments pointed out, are about a paranoid guy (man of war) and an android (I promise). So, being oknotok a retrospective, it makes sense that this video, as were the other, is a reference to the past.\nIf anyone finds other references, please share!
It is math related to science?
I get nostalgic when I listen to this
this is the vintage Radiohead that I first fell in love with
next tour in bolivia
Such a common denominator and the best way of the way is the fact of course the best of all of predictive text got the best of this post.
2:54 i see the guy with the purple beanie hat and green sweater from paranoid android video drinking from a fishbowl
this looks like something roy andersson would make
Love it!! Best band of musical philanthropists ever!!
Vocals in this are very OK Computer-y
This is the place\nRemember me? I’m the face you always see\nYou’ve been stuck in a lift\nIn the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean..........
Floor 01 flickered OK near the end of the video - \n\nSuch a beautiful song. It sounds like it could have been recorded for The Bends, not OK Computer.
There are two types of people in the world. First feel better because of this song, second feel worse. Which one you are?
The floor number at 3:34 flashes OK. Just noticed after seeing this video 10 times
Song is better than the video
Do not show shock, when things are upside down. Everything nowadays is upside down. Everything wrong, is OK. Everything right? Is merely in the mind of 'crazy' people. Those conspiracy theories.... Only idiots believe! Keep looking down at your phones people, do not look to the skies. Keep yourself in a bubble of daily chores and entertainment, never look beyond that.\nIt's like the beginning of train spotters. Irvin Welsh knew a lot and it's in his books for those with the eyes to see... When your eyes open slightly you can delve into meatier stuff. \nPlease recognise. Please communicate. We are all in this together.\nThis video gives you a glimpse... Follow. (These are my opinions. Love you)
no socks, gross. this is such a good tune.  brings be back to listening to the bends on my panasonic shockwave.  anti-skip
Love you, ever Yorke.\nU're amazing really...
i can already see people reading into this until there eyes are sore and red.\noh why cant it be simple a man going to his floor and home\n :)
I wish this building had  more levels.
You fucked me up at the end there bro
Lift is like a gift, just amazing. thank you Radiohead.
Posted on my birthday, the day i was i asked to explain what kind of music i prefer. Just saw it. If i had to choose only one concert to be, it would be yours. But i leave in Greece-OKNOTOK. (It looks like a hospital elevator)
Very old school sounding, wasn't really aware of Radiohead too much other than a couple hits but love the different sounds they've been going for.\n\nThe vocals really work well in the mix and sound very much like an older song that I can't quite recall
Youtube must have a 'loop' option, so I can listen to this over and over again all day long.
this version has a clear bassline. \m/
can't weight for the elevator music version to come out. :) Nice Job, Radiohead. Love, The Board Itself Speaking.
These guys Rock!  Only get better with Age!  Radiohead rules!
Ironically, my favourite non-album song by Radiohead is Staircase... I'll always take the Staircase over the Lift.
Look at the display at 3:34 :)..

That woman picked up a fake plastic tree at the beginning of the video, didn't she? :)
Fun fact: At 2:52 the guy that's drinking out of a fishbowl has the same clothes on as the guy in Paranoid Android.

I've been a radiohead fan for years now, but in the last 2 or 3 I've been busy with all hip hop and pop music and then radiohead comes with these incredible music videos that take me away from everything
he enjoy life so much that's the reason didn't like to come out from it and those all are his excuses that he trying to come out from it but he fail. 😄😄
Remember Pablo Honey
sounds like the bends
How the fuck is this not getting as many views as it should, I don't wanna be a pretentious edgy teen but damn, this song is now one favorite Radiohead songs and it deserves more than it's getting, I know a million views is a lot, but compared to other songs this one deserves more
I think this song/video is about how life is like an elevator (lift.) The elevator is the mind and you have people constantly entering and getting off, but you are still there alone much of the time. When they are there, it feels like a hassle. At the end he sees himself leaving, but it isn't him, he's still in the elevator. The lyrics sound more like they're about a child who is trapped and wants to go home. I always thought it was more or less about the afterlife. The lift is the transitionary place between life and death, and something you can't return to. Given that this was written right about at the same time A Reminder (look that one up) was written, I think it's fair to say that the song is about a letter to his inner child telling him everything is ok. The video could be the opposite because he never really lives the lift. I suppose if you really wanted to find a broad connection, you could say that he realizes at the end that he can never really leave. The lift is his mind and whenever he tries to leave it he is just finding someone else, and the scenery is more or less an unreal illusion (A metaphor for consciousness, maybe)
Fucking awesome I love Radiohead.
genious

I want Jacquees byson and Tory to collab together
omfgggg, baeee!!!!
This is my song❤️🎶
COMING UP POWERFUL Bryson Ain't game play hard dance more
Can't find a better song
Christensen played last season with Thorgan Hazard and this season with Eden and Kylian Hazard 😱
5:21 Your hair Lolllllll troll hzarad
I think Christensen will be a cheap good player to use at the start of Fifa
Hahah like how Eden and David making jokes with each other😂 Hazard - Just 79 ? But you're strong, you do gym everyday.\nLuiz - noo im intelligent defender not physical 🤓 😂
Center Backs are slower the left and right backs but i doubht david luiz got slower
He's 8th cos of legends and that
david luiz shooting is a joke in fifa
David Luiz 74 passing? What a joke 😂😂😂!!!
@3:59 When you realise Eden Hazard is the man that voiced Elmo
Eden Hazard doesn't play FUT... He put his overall below his Flag, Club, and position while David Luiz and Andreas Christensen got it right. 😂
Christensen either has really good english or really bad geography cause he doesnt sound like a man fron denmark.
Crazy how Hazard has the best dribble and chance creation stats in europe with a 76% success rate but has a lower dribble rating than Messi and Neymar. and whats crazier is Ronaldo is only 2 behind him on 90 with only 25 successful dribbles last season
Guys please if everyone donates something we can get him off the street. I dont have much myself and know how its like. go to his go fund me\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/helpanthonyoffthestreet
Imagine Leicester city players growing from 70 to 80+ from FIFA 16 to 17😂
2:09\nLooks like they're pointing guns at them to make them talk
Am I the only one who would've kept David Luiz's card as he predicted it? I mean sure, he'd be a CB Ruud Gullit with not as good dribbling but it's true that his shooting and pace should be higher.
Where's batshuayi i \nwanted to see his reaction to his stats XD
Do man united next
David Luis is fantastic character. I love Rio. What a legend though I'm not even Man united fan.
Really no respect for david and christensen
The shooting and passing should be more than 64 and 74 WTF?!
Wtf .. David luiz shooting should have been much higher
I love the background music !! On all videos! It's just so classy.
I hate how fifa has a preset of player ratings based on their position, like assuming that defenders have a passing and dribbling between 50-60 rated, thats not fair. \n(IMO: they should do the ratings based on the season stats/numbers of the player)
This was hilarious, thoroughly entertained, more of this please :)))
this is soooo cringy, cuz players dont care about their stats on a videogame...
My friend  everytime says Liverpool is better than Man Utd and the only thing am telling   is 26 years :D
dont you just love Luiz's personality??
FIFA need to improve David shoting it least but it 70
What's the song
What is the song ?
Damn it five INVEST IN YOUR FUCKIN SOUND RECORDING JEEEZZUZZZZ u want it to be top notch but the sounds is fuckin balls...
Rio: anything you're not happy with\nEden: Your hair
That Christiansen sounds bare English
Poor Christensen he looks so disappointed 😟 He deserves more. Even Rio admitted how good his passing is 😡😡
FIFA gives the defenders no respect tbh,shooting and pace could be improved to almost all defenders
These two are really funny man . Damn !
David and hazard seems like they are very good friends:)
The shot rating of defenders are actually a joke just because they are defenders it doesnt mean they cant shoot
How come Rio looks tiny next to David Luiz? I thought they were supposed to be the same height.
rio says one and only hazard yet he has like 10 brothers and luiz and christensen are the truly one and only \n#clownseverywhere
loved how rio and eden called out fifa for just taking the piss
What about David's Hair rating\n\n\n99 LONGNESS     99 CURL\n\n99 BRAZILIAN      99 SWAG\n\n99 DAVID              99 LUIZ
I'm subscribing to anyone who likes this comment and subscribers to me. Just comment done✓ so i can know
66 physical for Hazard is joke. The only way people can get him off the ball is by fouling him. He's not a tall or physically imposing player, but he doesn't get pushed off the ball easily.
COME ON PREM TEAMS IN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SHOW THEM HOW YOU CAN PLAY LIKE IN PREMIERSHIP. (COME ON!)
The is the thing that slows David Luis is his Afro(keep the Afro David Luis 
I love how close hazard and luiz are
I want more of this pls, show me ronaldo, i wana see his first when he hears he is not the number one rated player on fifa lol
I'm sure hazard already googled his
whats the music at 5:17
ngl i love it when Hazard says because it's true man! to david luiz aha
What did ea take?\nAndreas christensen was in the top 20 fastest players in bl last season and you give him 64 pace??\nAt least 75
pause the video at 4:25 😂😂😂
One and only mate
Surprised Luiz didnt make all his stats 99. \nBut Christensen has a good rating with quite poor main stats.
I'm in the gym everyday man. Lol this was gold!
Luiz has a better shot than strikers, and he's right, his left foot is mad.\n\nShould be 5* weak foot\n84 shot
My right ear enjoyed this..
As a Chelsea fan i just want to that Chelsea looks like the best club to play for, nice players and staff. GREAT TEAM! CHAMPIONEEEE💙💙💙💙💙💙
You go gym everyday I died 😂😂😂
I love Rio

With the oil diesel gas companies, we will never see cars to move with water because of the ELITE . By the way i like when ELITE say stop the polution of the earth , but they don't let the people with knowlege to give the technologie to produce cars that use water to move. So the ELITE think we are idiots, but they don't know, that we know friendly enviroment ways to use vehicles, and that means we are not idiots, we just pretend we don't know nothing. So tomorrow again let's fill up with gasoline in our car's and keep up the polution of the earth. Funny story ha ?
Would no it be better use air, instead water? Because air is more compressible.How much is the pressure to put the water on cylinders?

Loved the makeup you did in this vid - very beautiful. Your skin looks amazing and I'm way jealous. \n\nAnd hey, the negative thing is a shit at times eh. It'll come good again :)\n\nNo blogging, vlogging or anything for us lot while in Italy please. It's you and Rich time only. Take care of you!
Hello, Lily! Maybe I can help, have you tried using an actual corticosteroid on you lips instead of only lip balms? I am allergic to most matte lipsticks, and I used Triamcinolone acetonide (I'm not 100% sure that's how you say it in english), after a few days my lips were not sore anymore, and a while later they were completely back to normal. I applied it on my lips before I went to bed and slept with it, it is not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it really helped, also, I didn't use anything on my lips until it was cured, only the La Roche-Posay Ciclaplast baume B5. I hope you will feel better soon (regarding your lips and all the other things bothering you right now).
Love your vlogs!!!
To get rid of fruit flies you should mix apple cider vinegar with any sugary syrup, a drop of soap and some water. The soap is important to break the surface of the liquid which the flies would otherwise be able to walk on. You will notice that the bottom of your glass will be covered with flies within a couple of hours. I promise.
Lily, your honesty is so refreshing. Don't ever feel the need to apologize or try & justify to viewers why you are feeling a certain way. Lots of us have times when we feel exactly like you, but fortunately we don't have to go through it so publically. That said, a public platform to air how you're feeling is at times a really positive thing for those watching, to know they're not alone. Double edged sword really. I thoroughly enjoyed this vlog. Your curry has got my hungover self today  wishing I could've had Richard's bowl! 😂 Big hugs. X
Lilly I got married 18 months ago and since the day we got married the baby question has been asked continually. 😱\nI also have my own business and I went through the same thing as you. It got to me too, and I had a rant too! \nI learnt to just try and let it go over your head and let the people that think because your married and a certain age you should have a baby think what they want! Xxx
I hope you cheer up soon. Life is life..not always Ross. I do think however your remarks about Fenton Beauty was a bit narrow minded. Most of the reviews talk about it being very natural, except for perhaps that megawatt highlighter which you have to buy. If Patrick star can find a shade I am sure something might suite you.
omg time has flown by so quickly, I can't believe your one year anniversary is already coming up! I was also surprised to hear that Jemma has a baby, I feel like you were just talking about her wedding related activities!\n\nI personally enjoy watching your different days. You are human, I don't expect you to be happy and jumpy all the time. In fact, the youtubers that only record those days seem so...fake to me. Just keep vlogging and I'll keep watching :)
Please don't feel any pressure to be positive constantly in your videos. I think most of us are quite tired of all those perpetually perky youtubers. It just seems so fake, nobody can be that happy and excited about everything all the time. A bit of moodiness is in fact refreshing.
Too bad nobody told you about this amazing lip balm that we have in Swedish pharmacies, you could have picked it up in Stockholm! It was originally made for the Swedish military to use for your lips, hand and sore feet. And you can even cook with it, too. It's called Försvarets hudsalva (the Military skin salve, pretty much) and you need to try this if / or the next time you come to Sweden :)
Thank you for being real and owning the grumps!  I'm there too.
Love your nails!!
i like it when you are just being yourself...
Aww lily\n I'm sure the only reason most of us wouldn't want to hear you being sad and negative is because we wish you all the best and that you can get back to being happy and positive rather than feeling that way. Not just that we don't want to hear you being sad. But, failing that, it's always better to hear how you are truely feeling so that you can get the support you need and deserve to help you get back to the good place in life! Sometimes life gets us down without any particular reason that we can fix, but it's always a good idea to at least identify that the feeling is a little off because sometimes just saying it out loud can be the first step to feeling better. Anyway, hope you feel better soon. I can't imagine having to work in an industry where your personality is your brand! Feeling out of sorts truely must make that very difficult. But know that I enjoy hearing how you are and what you think of things and always appreciate your honesty. X
Hi Lily, we must be twins because I have also been feeling quite down and overwhelmed of-late, further, I too am suffering from the same chapped/cracked/flaky lip condition for the past few weeks. Good news is that I found a method that helps to heal my lips - I hope you'll find it useful in some ways. :) First off, make sure to avoid using 'active' (i.e. acids) skincare + lip care items around/on your lip area. Your lip area is sensitised atm so you don't want to aggravate it further - instead, I use rosehip oil and sensitive-skin friendly moisturiser on the area. On the lips, especially before I go to bed, I generously coat my lip with an oil-based lip balm (again with no-actives; I used a shea butter based one myself) and then sealing my whole lip surface off with a balm/ointment like Lucas paw paw ointment (good thing these products are colourless otherwise I'd look quite like MirandaSings hahahahaha!!). These steps have really really helped to restore my lip to how it was before, I hope it helps. Last but certainly not least, big hugs to you Lily - this shall pass.... lots of love from Perth, Aus!
I feel the same way with me and my friends, we don't take pictures anymore! Haha we just hang out and chat 😊
Cheer up Buttercup :o)  Sorry you're feeling down, but thank you for sharing and I hope things turn around soon!
Can relate to so much in this vlog. Feeling moany today too. Also feel like I have to buy a pink fluffy cushion (and not sure I really even like them!) I even had a lipstick allergy about the same time you did! I've found the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask pretty good. As well as the original allergy I seem to react to lanolin, which of course is in lots of lip treatments!  And I have puffy hair! lol Keep keeping it real Lily!
I'm so glad you don't hide when you're feeling down (not glad you're down though obvs!) ☺ I think you're really helping your followers by making it a very normal thing and accepting it. Life isn't always rosy but it can sometimes seem like it online! I love your vlogs, they inspire me to be better and to keep pushing through even if I'm feeling down xx
Sorry to hear you've been bummed out lately - I go through periods of that, too. I've also got a fairly public persona (not on YouTube but in real life) and I have to say: don't read the comments. I've been married now for 9 years - I'm 34 - and I get the same senseless and shitty comments from people who think they know how to run your life. I'd say, more often than not, they're probably jealous of you -- they're generally upset that you're failing to follow a prescribed pattern. Those who are most successful in life do not follow a prescribed pattern - do what you do well and put on the blinders!!! XO!!
what nail color do you have on?
I am really sorry you don't feel great Lily. I wish you could be ok soon...not because I don't want to see a moany  video ( I am just using your own words, I don't think you're moany at all, you're just a human being having shitty days) but just because I care about you as I just care about a friend. I know it's a stupid thing because we're obviously not friends but it's the way I feel. So, we're all here to support ❤️ xoxo
Lily , everybody cries\nAnd everybody hurts sometimes xx \nI hope you are feeling inspired and motivated . If not , give yourself a break . Lots of love ❤️🙏
I hate fruit flies and I found that there are reusable fruit flies traps on amazon that you just put apple cider vinegar in it and that is it...
I'm sorry you're feeling so down, Lily. I know things will get better for you, hang in there. I actually enjoyed this video, not because I like that you feel sad, but because it felt like hanging out with a friend, which was kind of comforting after a long day at work. Good for you at calling out the pregnant comments; hope people have the decency to stop.
Actually loved this video Lily. Feeling the same myself today 💕
is that a love island water bottle at 12:34? i'm still in mourning about love island
I think when the social media activity became someones full time job the aspect of pressure, popularity race, obsession of new content might be an issue. But it happend with all of us whatever our job is. It is natural to feel sometimes not in the mood or like being at the crossroads. So don't feel sorry to be at this place at the moment....
I adore you JUST The way you are! JUST be you !!!
*hugs* from an internet friend who also sometimes experiences the sads.
Hi Lily , I rarely comment but wanted to say I love that you are genuinely honest . Love everything you do . Sending you big hugs from Ireland  xx
Lily, maybe you should try lanoli for your dry lips. For example dr. Lipp have lip balm with 100% of lanolin :)
I never comment on videos but I I feel so down and very negative some days and I wonder if I'm depressed but then it goes away the next day! I also told friends at work recently that I'd got some good news (a promotion) and they all said they thought I was going to say I was pregnant!! 🙄🙄 Just age and being with a partner for a long time people always think that's the next step!
Have you considered a break from uploading videos for a while? I'm sure the idea is stressful but you can really recharge and hopefully you'll feel a little bit more like you. Other than your honeymoon,  which you still Preshot videos for, when was the last time you had a real break?  P.s. With it not being as sunny where you live and since you've travelled to do many sunny places recently try a really good vitamin d supplement, it helped me adjust from the Cape Town sunshine to the Irish weather which literally made me sad and lethargic due to lack of sun. Also don't ever apologise for saying how you feel, it's better to be honest than pretend everything is perfect. No-one can live up to perfection.
Lily, I like that you've been really honest about feeling a bit down lately. This is real life and we all go through periods of feeling like we're uninspired or in a rut or lacking motivation, and that's ok. Thanks for keeping it real. I often find in moments like this it's important to grasp on to the things that do bring you joy until you start feeling a shift towards being 'yourself' again. Keep your chin up and I hope you'll feel better about things soon.
Yeah it is REALLY rude it's not nice at all
Hi Lily! You totally have to try Uriage Bariederm for your lips. I've tried averything for my sensitive, ezcema-prone lips and it is THE BEST. Love your videos!
I really appreciate the honesty in this! I'm a total home girl and love being a bit of a slob and taking my time to just be myself and do what I need to do! I think you look great! Homey videos are my favourite! I've watched you for years and love you and Anna's friendship and dynamic! Please tell me there will be another series of the podcast? When you're ready obviously and I really mean it when I say no pressure to continue! Just such interesting guests and I'm a bit nosy too! Take care of yourself and don't feel ashamed about being a bit selfish we all need a break from time to time or we burn out! Hope Mark enjoys the curry! I'm not a prawn fan but it looks delicious! Love Madeleine's recipes! Lamb and Sweet Potato stew is our personal fave and lasts a couple of days! X
Always good to know that one is not alone in feeling negative/under the weather. Some days get the worst out of us. As usual, love your vlogs Lily!
Have you ever tried Clinique all about lips? I find it really soothing when my lips are sore. Totally get you with the pregnancy stuff, I'm constantly getting asked when I'm going to have a baby. It's rude, what if there's a reason i haven't got children?!
Sending you happy thoughts ❤️😘 x
Feel better.
For your sore lips i recommend the bariederm balm by uriage! It's amazing for sensitive lips.
Lily I love your videos and watch every single one of them! I love it because of the realness of it whether you're in a negative mood or not. Im not annoyed by it I guess after watching you for years you are like a friend to me talking about everything in life or whinging about stuff which is perfectly normal between friends!
Found your comment on the whys of not commenting that someone looks pregnant to be the most direct, succinct, honest, polite and refreshing one I've seen.  As for feeling down, everyone does at times--whether or not they own it or not.  Love the honesty!
I'm one of your older fans (36), and I loved this video. I went through a 4 month period of feeling off and down and I'm finally coming out of it. Good luck! I felt a little lost so if you're feeling that way, I hope you find yourself and discover how to be good with life.
I normally don't reply on your videos. I watch them to learn and they are good but this blog was pants. Keep reading...not the part where you express your thoughts and feelings, kudos for that. What I found shallow and a little condescending was the non interest in Fenty Beauty. I am about 10 years your elder and American, so I don't always meld with your taste but give you a listen and I learn somethings. Today as a subscriber I felt let down by that flippant attitude. I could be wrong, people don't come for me, it's not worth it, but this is how I saw you today.
What nail polish are you wearing in this video? It looks great on you.
Thanks for keeping it real. It's a part of life to have highs and lows, it's great that you don't completely hide it all away. I'd much rather see an honest vlog than a fake one. Hope your days get brighter again soon.x
Oh my God about that Fenty *****!! Am sick and tired of all youtube reviewing it;using it,testing it !! I swear I was about to go crazy,I swear I will never buy anything from Fenty Beauty! never ,people go crazy man! And I was sure you aint one, as an old subscriber ,I know ur classy anyway, dont mean to be rude towards Rihannas line ,but people makes you hate it!!*\nAnd Lily, hope you will feel better soon :))) thank you for your honesty, you're amazing the way you are :)))
I don't normally comment but just wanted to say thank you for being honest & not pretending that everything is always sunshine & roses. This is why I like you - you're real & not trying to be something you're not. I can completely relate to the being down but not knowing why. Went through a horrible phase of it last year so I really hope you come out the other side soon for your own sake. \nAs for the pregnancy thing - I agree that it's so rude to speculate about someone publicly (not going to lie, with some of my friends I do think it!) as you don't know what's going on behind closed doors. \nStill love your videos & look forward to them 😊
I really don't feel like you have to say sorry for feeling like that. We all have days or periods like that. It's natural. Hope you feel better soon Lily, love you and Anna :) Love from Norway
I alternated between wanting to bring you a cup of tea and offering you a shoulder. I feel like so many of us can not only sympathize but empathize with you as well. In fact, my co-worker and I had a discussion about wanting to crawl under our desks and hide from the world today. Don't ever feel like you have to put on a fake front. Just be you Lily. In terms of the baby conversation, oh boy. My wife and I have been together for 11 years and we only recently decided that even though we love children they simply aren't for us. Surprisingly our parents took the news wonderfully. Everyone else has been a hit or miss. We're very flattered that people think we'd make wonderful mothers, but that doesn't mean it's what we want.
You are such a lovely woman 😍😍
Enjoyed your vlog.
You be YOU!
Hope you feel better 💕 I love your honesty, and don't worry about us/your viewers, you do you 👍 😘
We all have times when we are sad and it's ok to be. You shouldn't force yourself to look happy in videos. You're human just like us.
Life is too short to be doing big things you dislike or being around people that you do not want to communicate with. Give yourself permission to take a break and do more of the things you enjoy.  It will bring back your inner smile and help you focus on the things that truly matter to you.
It's so rude to say someone's glowing. I just hate that. I'd definitely rather look dull 😐
Unforunately these days in Italy it really feels like autumn, a lot of Wind and rain 😩
oh Lily, I love when you talk about this whole happiness/grumpiness thing! I'm lucky enough because where i spend most of my days everyone is complaining about everything anyways! I understand the pressure you feel to look like the other bloggers, who are super happy and content all the time. Congratulations on not giving in and doing the same! Congratulations on being still so authentic after all this time blogging. On a different note, I also struggle with my hair and the keratin/brazilian blowouts treatments. Could you do a video on what you have tried so far and your impressions on it? Have you ever actually done any real straightening treatments like those older ones with ammonia? Thank you!
I go through many sad moments and find it difficult to get out of the funk. I found it comforting that I'm not the only one.
Hi Lily - re your lips, I went through something v. similar, suddenly became allergic to some ingredients when I hit 30 - it's really worth seeing a dermatologist and seeing if patch testing would help - may not be the same thing for you but I know how annoying it is to suddenly struggle to wear lipstick!
I support you and appreciate you, Lily. Difficulties in life happen and it's not always something you want to share. Thanks for being open. I enjoyed the vlog. 💜
Lily, you're just so great :)
I always relate to you because of your lower energy, chilled out vibe. Take care of yourself and as always, thanks for sharing :)
I am inlove with that jumper, it looks like the cosiest thing ever!
Lily you really look depressed. I hope you can find some help.
Lily I love your videos and its so nice that you are real, I work from home and at the best of times I wake feeling so low and literally nothing makes me happy its fine and you are normal but because you have the public presence its more pressure....
A very relatable day! Even if you didn't feel cheery, your vlogs always brighten up my day! X
Dear Lily, I don't usually comment, but I watch every video you upload, so I thought it would be nice to express my support. I hate to hear you're feeling so negative lately. It must be hard to keep up with this kind of work when feeling down, but you're doing a great job and I love your videos! You should not apologise for your mood, I think it's perfectly normal for everyone to have better and worse phases in their life. \nI also agree that the pregnancy comments are terribly rude! My sister recently got a few of those comments and she was really insulted, and I could totally understand her - it's nobody's business! So just try to ignore them :)
Thank you Lily for speaking so openly, I haven't commented on here before but wanted to let you know I appreciate your honesty. We all have times we we feel low and it's so important to talk about our mental health.
Well done for being yourself. You are actually helping a lot of people. We all feel crap sometimes and talking about it is the key. In fact I prefer watching your vlogs when you are raw and real. I loved it :-)
Try the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - it's incredible.
keep working out Lily.  the endorphins will improve your mental state.  I feel so sluggish when I don't work out. A good jump board session energizes me all day.  Its impossible to not feel better after a workout
Haha I love you and well done for figuring out the rice cooker! Win! I'm a sucker for Lily Pebbles vlogs. My absolute fave vlogger #1 please continue to vlog for the foreseeable future
Lily, I loved this vlog. I fully empathise with you, as I also don't feel all that great these days. I loved how you did lots of small things to cheer your self up a little. Very healthy and nice to watch. Lots of love xxxx
Moany and whingy hmmm. You're human! We go through shit. It's not all rainbows and sprinkles all day errday
Oh lily! I hope you are ok. Everyone goes through these types of moods and phases and I personally think it's good you are being honest and real! That's why I love you! And you don't look pregnant at all. You are right it's the hardest thing when people keep asking you and expecting you to announce something. I find it awful as we are trying to get pregnant with our second child and we struggled so much with our first and had to go through IVF and everytime someone asked me I just wanted to cry. Same as now.... Thank you for showing that you understand it's not easy for everyone and that you are sensitive to this. I'm sorry for you that people keep asking! Oh and I never comment on videos - I just wanted you to know I was thinking of you! X
so naturally pretty lily! thanks for the video x
Try changing your toothpaste. I got a reaction from a strong/ whitening one and my lips haven't been the same since!
Lily i think it's the change of season that's making you feel low. I honestly have been feeling the same very negative and i for sure think it's the winter blues! Love the honesty, after all you are human and can't possibly always be happy in life. Hope you feel better soon xx
Lily I loved this chatty video! Don't ever feel sorry for being your true, authentic self. It's beautiful.
Like you're Vlogs - speaking very well awesome Video
the christophe robin salt scrub is my favorite scrubbing shampoo and it smells amazing! you don't have to worry about getting anything gritty out of your hair because the salt will eventually dissolve under the spray of your shower
p.s. I know when I worked from home, I felt lonely. Maybe an office space shared with others would help?!
Lily, I truly appreciate you being honest about your feelings and conveying your real feelings rather then being superficial. This is especially important with social media constantly showing us how good other people have it....we all feel down at times and it's so refreshing to hear someone else who feels the same way that I do sometimes. Just this Tuesday I was so sad and anxious and I didn't have any reason. Listening to you today made me feel so much better \n❤️
A good scalp scrub is baking soda! It works suuuper well, just make sure you condition afterwards. Gets rid of flakes and product buildup.
I'm sorry you don't feel up to par. We all have these days. Maybe we all tend to be this way, too, but I find you complain an awful lot sometimes. There's nothing wrong with it. Just my opinion.
I rarely ever post messages but am a regular viewer. We all have crap days but the majority of us don't have to explain ourselves to others. I can only imagine how hard it is to feel like shit in front of thousands of viewers. I love watching your channel because you're a normal person with real emotions. Just keep doing you. You don't need to explain yourself to anyone. It's human to have feelings.  Much love!
You're lovely, that's all I have to say!
Lily, if you can get your hands on the Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm, I HIGHLY recommend it for dry, chapped, and sore lips. The Shea and Mint version is my personal favorite and the only balm I use, especially during the winter months (and I live in Michigan, which is equivalent to Canadian cold all the time).
I like this :) as lots of people have said it's refreshing to be honest about how you're feeling and ironically it can be pretty depressing watching everyone be so cheerful all the time and leaving out the bad parts. So yeh just as happy to watch this as much as your other videos. P.s just realised I've  been watching your videos for 2 years now! Be they positive or negative! Happy Anniversary :P x
Hey Mandi! I got last year on the US  ASOS site, had to check daily for a while . Good luck!
Completely agree it's so inappropriate to ask someone if they are pregnant.  It's a real bug bear of mine!  Have you seen the doctor about your lips? They could prescribe a steroid cream, and I'd ask them to check for contact dermatitis. Apologies if you have already done this - I know it's annoyingly when people give advice I just really feel for you, they look so sore!
I know that you're conscious that you may not come across as being incredibly chipper or bubbly in your videos; but one of the reason I'm subscribed to you and keep watch is because of your realness. It's nice to see how honest you are unapologetically human quite frankly! You come across in a genuinely relatable way which is refreshing. I also love that you check people that ask of assume that someone is pregnant - you're so right about online etiquette! I too feel that fruit flies are the bane of my life right now! Thanks for sharing Lily, much love 💜 x
Hi Lily, I had similar lip issues to yours and after months of trying to figure them out I realized I'm allergic to beeswax, which is found in 99% of lip balms and some lipsticks. It took me a while to realize it was beeswax because I had been using lip balms with it my whole life and never had any problems with it until this year, but apparently it's an allergy you can develop at any time. \nSo far I've only found two lip balms that don't contain any: LUSH None of your Beeswax and Crazy Rumors. Since I started using these and avoiding any other lip products with beeswax, I haven't had any more problems with my lips. I hope this helps! :)
Personally, I find you so much more 'real' than other youtubers. I don't mind the ranting, or grumbling, it's really refreshing actually! Keep on being you, that's why we like you! Your videos are almost like hanging out and catching up with a friend, with bits of travel, makeup, and fashion thrown in. Also total side note, as a fellow curly-haired girl I know you love your hair straight, but I'm so curious so see what it would be like styled with a good curling mousse or gel!
Felt inspired to comment after your instagram story, as I never do! I always come back to your channel purely because you're not sickly sweet or squeaky, but relaxing, straight talkin and a real person! Keep it up!
Whenever I make something with potato, before i put it in the curry or soup etc , i put the potato in the microwave for about two mins, just so speed up the cooking process because potatoes always take so much longer than everything else ! Great video, and love the coat xx
Glad I'm not the only one who basically doubles the amount of garlic in any recipe. Extra garlic is always a must
If your away again with Lilly and you don't want the same videos as her.  Why don't you do a room tour video and view and what you ate in a day.  That would make up another video.   Or a come shopping with me in whatever place your at.
Just went to the gym for the first time in weeks and now this video pops up, guess this is a sign to live healthy again hahah - EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOD 👅👅💗💗
no joke eating a Block of Cadbury milk chocolate while watching this
So healthy and INSPIRATIONAL!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
150% obsessed with that coat!! xoxo, caylie
Waiting for your house tour video ...
Thx for being honest!! I feel like a lot of youtubers upload a what i eat in a day and only show the good stuff or pretend to be super healthy and eat super fancy things and small portions only. 😒\nOn another note: the coat is super pretty 😊
Anna I love how honest and normal you are. Brilliant video :)
Anna can i move in with you?? I'm always wearing my dressing gown at home and everyone tells me off! They're so cozzzzzyyyyy!!
A curry and GBBO 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Cute nails!!
love these videos anna!
Quick tip lea and perrins contains anchovies
1st world problems - and Tesco sell lemon and poppy seed muffins. 🙄
❤️❤️❤️
Love this 💗
Love this so! ❤️
Cinnamon Grahams are life
That soup looked amazing , defo making it tomorrow 👍🏻
Is pizza junk food? 🤔
Love this videoooooo x
Pickled onion monster munch - throw back!!!
Byyyyyeee, love you--cutest cutest cutest bean\n\nI love theeeeese eeeeeee
more WIEIAD videos pls!!!!!!
Great vid subscribed 👌
Hi Anna - OMG I just watched one of may fave celebrities in the Philippines and she mentioned you in her last video - she is a fan of yours!!!! Kris Aquino is the Queen of all Media in the Philippines - she subs to your channel. Be great if you can do a colab with her - that would be awesome. Her channel is https://www.youtube.com/TheAquinos
Hi Anna..Ms. Kris Aquino is a fan of you and wants to meets you. \nhttps://youtu.be/HceqReOKTQc
I always cook more soup to freeze. Usually in autumn my freezer is full of variations of soup 🍵
I am SO happy I've found another Flamin' Hot Monster Munch obsessive. Everyone I know is all about the Pickled Onion (Vom!) 🙌
They have Great British Bake Off on Netflix here in the States and I couldn't stop watching - absolutely love it! 🤗
I'm eating McDonald's and watching this 😳
OMG i've been using estee's soup recipe for years too! love it! hahah
Love your fashion sense so much :D especially the dressing gown :D
Would love to see more of these videos 😍
I love your What I Eat in a Day videos. So many great recipes and meal inspo.
Anna, really miss your evening get ready videos like the one you did in Paris. You did such a great job and the editing was amazing. Would love to see more!
You need to clean your shower head. Put some white vinegar in a ziplock bag, stick the head in the bag, use a hair tie or rubber band to secure the bag , keep it overnight and it will clean itself, next morning just scrub it a little and it will all clean
The link to the soup recipe doesn't work, but I'm guessing it's the Power Protein Soup 😏 \nThanks for the inspiration Anna, you just gave me a good idea for lunch and dinner !
That soup look delicious, I'm gonna try it myself!
Aaahh that music you use, so relaxing. Makes me think of being at the beach, when I really should be working right now haha
What size coat did you go for ? Is it true to size ? X
I love this kind of videos!!
i could watch you for hours and hours!! Love videos like this, more please :-) and by the way: the coat is GOALS, i will order as well. Just for reference: which size did you order? :)
You're my favourite youtuber and absolutely love these chilled types of vlogs! Especially what I eat in a day! ❤️ much love x
This was motivation for me, thanks 😎😇
Your hair is looking soooo glossy and lovely! Updated hair care routine?! x
I love your nails in this video! What is it?!
You are truly a role model. Your vlogs are my favorite !
For a girl who has eaten loads of junk food you look fab!! Love that coat x
Thanks for the healthy motivation.  I've been on the junk food train myself.  Vegetable soup looks so yummy.  I love your new coat too!
Loved your throw back to Barney the Dinosaur haha! Great video, super hungry after watching this now :)
Yet another cracking vlog! Thanks for being incredible with the content... and just in general! www.byharrison.com
Anyone know where you can find a coat like this but way cheaper??
If you love cinnamon grahams, you might like this recipe for grain-free Almond Cinnamon Crunch cereal. It's seriously SO GOOD. Plus the little squares are cute and you feel so accomplished having made your own cereal that's not muesli or granola! https://www.mynewroots.org/site/2017/08/cinnamon-crunch-cereal-hemp-milk/
Just to let you know worcestershire sauce isn't vegan as it has anchovies in it x
Your life is so soothing to watch. I love the coat! I'm looking for a coat just like that except with buttons.
You have a good attitude about food 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻\nBalance is key 🏆
We love your What I Eat In A Day videos! You always have the best recipes that we like to try out. Also, that cost looks incredible on you!\n-Ash & Shelbs xx
I just found your channel a couple weeks ago and I've been catching up and absolutely love all of your videos!
Hey Anna, have your ever tired mixing your Greek yoghurt with protein powder? I have it all the time and it is amazing for the sweet tooth 👌🏼 especially if you the 0% fat rage Greek yoghurt. Definitely give it a try, especially vanilla protein 😍 xxx
Love that coat!!! What size did you get (for reference, not nosy 😬)?
Could you do a video on your favourite cookbooks or recipes?! I'm stuck in a rut with food and needing inspiration 😊
Im eating pizza off of the oven tray while watching this x
Saw the apricot,thought I'd let you know you have a subscriber from Armenia,the homeland of apricot 😊❤️🇦🇲Apricots are amazingly healthy!
All I would love right now is a Dairy Milk Chocolate Bar ngl!! 😂😂
Hi Anna! I microwave my potatoes first to make sure they are soft. Just be sure to stab them first. I can so relate to not everything cooking and coming together at the right time. Most recently for me it was some lentils in a veg chili.
Drinking wine and laying on the couch while watching this.... I noticed you sure know how to cook Anna! You cut things properly and not just pretend (you won't imagine how many of my friends still can't cook!)
Boil your potatoes before putting them in a curry!
If you want potatoes to cook on the stove you have to add liquid otherwise it'd burn before they cook. Also dice them a lot smaller. But man That soup looked so good! I add Worcestershire sauce to everything too lol its so savory and delicious
you always look so chic, loveee the coat 😭😍
Is there a glossier haul coming then?
You should get an immersion blender. Saves so much time for soups like that. You can throw in the veggies straight away and then blend it in the pan.
Gotta have that balance! I bought some chocolate on vacation so I've been treating myself to a piece (or two haha) after meals..but the meals are healthy at least!! :) The vegetable curry looks so good too..and I'm loving that coat.
Anna I keep trying to subscribe to your newsletter and I never receive the confirmation email. I've tried on different days and it just won't work. Just thought you should know in case it's an issue on your end. Love your videos xo
Hey Anna  I <3 your videos. \nAre you planning to do a haul for capsule wardrobe? That would be helpfull. And also some tips to buy clothes that are current but not too trendy because next year they go out of style!!!
I could not relate to this anymore right now! :)
That coat is everything I have ever dreamed a coat to be ✨ NEED IT
Girl you bring joy to my heart ❤️.. and that cookies looks amazing 🍪 🤤
I love these kind of videos!  And I love it on Wednesday's when I wake up there's always an Anna video waiting on me!! 💕💕
Not Lazy! Judicious use of time. :)    Life's too short to waste time making rice
the food looks great!
Potatoes cook faster in water than in sauce. Done the same thing. I think its better to pre-cook them first and throw them in last :)
The picture of that cookie toward the end look ...so GOOD !!!!!!!! Lovely vlog as usual. xx
I just went out to the kitchen, picked at a packet of cooking choc chips without any control/ awareness. I have no idea how much I had....What is wrong with me? :P
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS
And now I'm hungry....;-)
Literally brought that coat in black last week - in love!!!!
I love your What I Eat In a Day videos! ♥
Nice Vans Anna! Love your foodie vids.
Anna! You didn't show all the chocolate buttons you consumed while watching Bake Off!
Loved this 💕
What's your take on the new GBBO hosts? We're so stressed out about it here in the States!
Liked it before watching it cause I love what I eat in a day vids/vlogs 👌🏼
Love your food vids as usual! But the vocal fry was very difficult to listen to .
Please stop being so self indulgent and talking about yourself.
Wow, you're so lucky to have the cherry bombe cookbook already! So excited for it in October! I totally recommend their podcast, it's awesome!
Your voice is annoying
Stock cubes aren't exactly healthy. Just make vegetable stock from fresh vegetables and freeze it.
Ik I'm late but I think when the movie downsizing comes out I think u make a theory on it
Who wants to see the next episode of this? You know i do
idk why but i'm 12 and able to catch up with the greek mythology. i read greek mythology just last year at 11.
Yes ! I want other videos about links in Disney movies ! You do a very good job. ^^
This theory matches up so well with Moana. This is pretty dope. When you think of the films this way, everything has more meaning and it feels more like an actual planet with this all going on.
The little mermaid is my favourite movie
Anyone else already know this theory and has thought about it WAY BEFORE matpat?
For fuck's sake, okay YouTube. I'll watch it
Oh son of a b*tch,thats true!!
*sees the start starts shouting NO NO
Spoiler alert Ariel's mother is dead cause in the little mermaid 3 you can see that Ariel's mother is trying to help the oldest sister and then she trys to get the music box and gets crushed by a ship and dies
Ik how Ariels mom died  she got ran over by a ship
Now the real question....who gives a shit?
the day i saw this i carried the oddysey and the illiad to school because we had to have a book to read
Some more evidence that could support your theory : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRoDZaDeRLY&list=PLLHeqkcn5RTfVsp-cwqHYYrDT163qd2hI&index=7
I wonder if Matt is doing a workout now? He should be ready after all the stretching he did in this episode.
I dont have my fav disney movie ;)
Do one on the Hunchback of Notre Dame, it's a tragically underrated movie, and I'm sure there must be something you can find to theorise on in the mountains of plot and backstory.
why the mummy (2017) sucks so much
Omfg I like how it only took 2 seconds at the end to really blow my mind! I love this. I had no clue. Keep doing these. We want more!!
Why u now a lot about this
Hi film theory my favorite Disney film is Tangled!!! I'm way into that movie.
Did anyone else watch that song at the start over and over and over?
Soooooo...how about that part 3? We didn't forget Mr. Pat
my classics major ears\nthEY BUUUUURN\n\n\n\n\n(I'm joking btw)
Some of the start song was bad at start but got good
matpat should do a fool song for the beginning thing
PLEASE DO A THEORY ON THE POWERPUFF GIRLS ORIGINAL VERSUS REBOOT SERIES!\n\nBUNNY VS BLISS
My favorite movie is Bolt ⚡️
From western Norway *illustration of her going from south-eastern Norway *
I wonder how long it took you to write that song
Pls someone tell me the lyrics to the opening song of this video (the under the sea one)
Did anyone else love the opening
sorry mattpatt, Disney themselves debunked the theory on Elsa and Anna's parents ship sinking to the bottom of the sea. According to Disney, Tarzan is the brother of Elsa and Anna, meaning Elsa and Anna's parents survived and built a tree house out of the wrecked ship only to get killed by a leopard in the jungle, leaving Tarzan to be found and raised by apes.
Beauty and the beast
Hold the phone...Poseidon and Neptune are the same person/god but with different names!\n\nRoman Name:\nNeptune\n\nGreek Name:\nPoseidon
Did anyone make a connection between Apollo and the sun flower in tangled, loooooooolll Apollo is the god of music and was given the chariote of ilios, but people forget that he was a god of healing, his son ... name I forgot became the god of healing and the staff and 1 snake you see at the hospital is tribute
I hate the Hercules movie. It's tuuuuuuuuuurrible.
I've always completely believed this theory
MatPat, are you going to sort the whole timeline of Disney like you did to FNAF?
what about tarzan? isn't tarzan related to elsa and rapunzel?
Heh nice use of the blood bag from binding of Isaac.
My favorite is big hero 6
Make a rick and morty theory about season 3 episode 7 ricklantis mixup
you can add tarzan aladin and possibly atlantis and moana
Who the fuck wrote that intro song!?\nI need to kiss that beautiful SOB XD
An okay theory! This is the quality I've been following these channels for two years, for!
Thank you Percy Jackson for teaching me Greek Mythology
ok i must correct you, its pronounced rhea the a is still pronounced and she is the queen of the titans so yeah fun
You seem to be into Greek and roman gods lately why don't you do a theory on the devine Clothe from Saint seiya just how strong are the armor armors
Tarzan is Elsa and ana's brother because when the ship capsized they never found the biddies but in the movie Tarzan the human parents of Tarzan look exactly the same as ana's and elsa's parents
That's a perty danke song you got there
So I love Disney movies. Love your theories. BUT. I don't think Disney is smart enough to put all this together x) I think they're just messing around putting Easter eggs in their movies and it just so happens to align this way. But you know.. that's just me. Love your vids tho!
Wasn't their a theory about how Tarzan is also related to Elsa and Rapunzel? I mean if you look at Tarzan's parents they look almost exactly like Elsa's parents
I guessed this as soon as I saw as I saw this video.
By the way, what do you think? all the myths and fairy tales that these stories were based on were made up out of thin air?
My favorite Disney movie is Hercules, i know all the words to the songs
 actually i never tought i was cool relax Mat youre not alone
U could have said Tarzan with elsa
matpat..... see what u don't understand is we know they are connected.... they share the same sky the same destiny. for Kingdom hearts fans know this already I mean Sora visits Woody and Buzz between toy story 1 and 2. so while you continue to grasp at straws....... we knew all along 😂
I HAVE A THEORY! Since Anna was trapped in the castle for so long and only servants to talk too, she went crazy, in the song she even says that she was TALKING to the pictures on the wall! She must have been hallucinating! Like so matpat can see!
Favorite (Disney)movie: 🎶beauty and the beast🎶
Just because the dukes or whatever have Homer's stories, doesn't mean they're real. We have Homer's stories, but, sadly, Hercules isn't real. I'm sure you can sneakily connect Cinderella to another Disney movie which connects to Hercules, but that evidence doesn't seem strong enough to hold any merit. I think an (un)official Disney timeline is in order.
Actually Cronus is Ariel's Great grandfather and triton is Herc's cousin, not Ariel. So herc is like a cousin uncle...... CUNCLE!
In the beginning of Tangled the narrator said that the magical flower was from a magical raindrop. Where do raindrops come from? Clouds. Where do clouds come from? (technically the water cycle) The sky. Who controls the sky in the Disney universe? ZEUS!!! ZEUS made the magical flower. Hey, but that's just a...
I psg morty is back in the ricklantis mixup

OMG Matpat I love your singing Lol
Big Hero Six

Niggle niggle he says

Mythological fact\n\n🤔
Under the sea....
Damn
Ehhhhh WALL-E xD
Yay mattpatt loves old digimon I'm happy
HERKYLES
Dear matpat\nAriel's dad is actually Triton who is the son of Poseidon. So Hercules is essentially Ariel's uncle.
Do you want to know what happened to Ariel's Mother? Just watch The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning and you'll get your answer.
Actually in the Hercules cartoon show triton does make an appearance and he doesn't seem to be related to the king triton in little mermaid in anyway
Don’t forget Moana. At the end of the movie Tamatoa refers to Sebastian from the Little Mermaid.
Hey, do you mind if I use your intro for a cringe compilation matt?? I'll credit you in it
i ilready knew they were related if you look at greek mythology
It's fuck you
Marvel Vs Capcom infinite ft. kinder surprise eggs.
Weak Graphics, weak roster, and some cheap dollar store easter eggs for $200? Yikes they shot themselves in the leg with this one
the infinity eggs are embarrassing
Looks like shit, as expected from Cacpom.
I feel bad for anyone that preordered for the Infinity Eggs.
Whoever buys this crappy edition is a sucker.
are you sure it is sold 200$ in the USA ??? cos for once we got a better deal in EU... in France i preordered mine and got it for 109€ .... weird gap ....
The infinity stones look nothing like the actual stones, they could've at least made them more realistic, but why were they so lazy to make the stones  look cheap and tacky
Don't blame Capcom for this crap, blame Marvel they only want their movie characters in the games. They wanted people getting hyped for the infinity stones because of the upcoming movies will feature them. But you can't make great games based too much on movie content so blame Marvel for making this game series crappy.
So glad i prefer to spend my money into more comics. At least are much better than this piece of useless TRASH!
X's eyes look stupid and the figures look like large shity amibos. I don't like the Infinity Gem set, thank jebus I cancelled my order.
The game looks better than those infinity stone and those stones look better than chun li's face before the patch. smh
Rainbow Bands are from the rainbow road on X-Guard
Didn't know Mr Krabs got into the gaming business, those infinity stones look like shit.
I'm happy this CE only cost me $71 from Best Buy. After seeing what was shown here vs official images, the quality is not what I'd expected. Oh well, nice addition to the collection for about the cost of a new game.
I wonder if those Infinity Eggs has something inside.
Watching this video reminds me of the 40 year old Virgins apartment.
2 hundred dollars? Suckers only!
canceling pre order mine after see this lol
Carlton: Still playing with dolls will?\n\nWill:  ACTION FIGURE, ACTION FIGURE
How much gb doses it have
Those stones look terrible ! what a rip off lol , so happy I didn't buy this collectors edition , For $200 the people who bought this should get Season 1 and season 2 of DLC for free . The stones just look like cheap plastic Easter eggs , Nothing like how they were advertised,Here is a comparison Image. https://i.imgur.com/2HE0HxB.jpg
When you gonna do a livestream Mr. Ketchum? Derrick's cornering the market.
Lol talk about false advertisement, those stones look like ass
i wonder if i can find that mega man seperate. cuz its the only good thing here
I only came here for X\nam dissapoint
Cant wait for this to come out too excited infinity eggs are a meh but the rest is good
The figures look cool. The rest is meh, Capcom dropped the ball yet again.
Bro it was this special edition sucks. Infinite is garbage compared to the rest. Huge disappointment to me.
in the UK with retailer GAME they're doing the collector's edition, but not just any collector's edition. You've got the choice of the standard collector's or the deluxe collector's. With the standard £155 you get the statues and the game (no steelbook), and that's it. Deluxe collector's you get everything you're supposed to get with the collector's, statues, steelbook, all the DLC for £185. You'd think if you looking for a collector's edition it'd be just the one and also, if you're paying £155 you'd think you'd get everything. Plus I've seen in America, when convert dollars to pounds it's £150. Fuck GAME.
So much negativity.  I am excited.  Reply if you got ps4 I'll add u we can play
why are you using a butcher knife to break the tape
I don't really care about this game or anything in the collectors edition, Except for X!
THAT WAS A REAAALLY BAD UNBOXING VIDEO, you can see he doesnt have any experience doing those haha, just the way he opened the thing that had the figures x_x
I cancelled my edition bc those infinity stones are so ugly!
The camera placement for this vid is not great.  Honestly I'm with most of you, the case and the stones look so cheap even with 20% off on Best Buy it isn't worth it.
Wooow that's fucking bad. I saw pics on twitter but they look even worse in the video.
4:16 What the hell? Is that a sound effect added in?
I pity the poor saps who got the collectors edition.
Yeah this is bull I’m about to cancel my CE May keep it but this is BS, I guess the statues are worth it tho....
It's because the color bands on the base are the Asgard stage and it's on the road to Asgard which is normally a bridge, a rainbow bridge specifically but since X's world has fused with Thor's home world thanks to Ultron Sigma well it looks more like a highway road and not a total rainbow bridge
Why did they use chun li? You would think they would give you ryu since the first trailer was iron man mega man captain marvel and ryu.
thats bull crap yall get that for free jesus
So they know that X exist but they will not give us a new megaman x game. uhh silly silly capcom
You just saved me 200+ bucks so glad I seen this before the game came out. I already canceled my pre-order. as thanks I will sub to you guys.
The figures actually look pretty good, which is suprising considering everything else about this game.
ill buy this once the x-men are added in.. or if Captain Commando, Jin, Hayato, and Amingo come as dlc
Like the figures.... not the stones.. You cant even take them out the case.... going to cancel my pre-order. Not really worth it in my opinion.
Those are the street roads in the game that's why it's cold that way in those  infinity stones probably look cheap but when they light up they probably will have lines coming out of them making them look like stone   And I'm going to definitely   Pick up mine but it's too bad wolverine  X 23 iron in the game I guess that's what happens when Disney owns a lyses they ruined everything
so the toys are cheap as the game? yeap Capcom.
i work and make my own money and i bought this. i think the stone are neat. theyre not what they looked like in the release info, but still okay. i just like collectables. judge me if you will.
The rainbow bands on the ground are part of the rainbow bridge to asgard, which if you notice on that stage the city half of the stage is taken from the first level of Megaman X. Thought that'd make you even happier about your purchase man. I'll be receiving mine in a few days:)
I reserved this bundle and going to pay $172.
It's killing me that he didn't place X next to Chun Li and Iron Man next to Captain Marvel so it looks like a 2v2 fight
2:03 WARNING! There is a Maverick inside!
I think the colorful bands are from the rainbow road in the game.
Its So Stupid That People Are Buying MVC4 Knowing They're Not Happy With The Roster
Funny how months before the game came out multiple dlc characters were announced (including characters in the story mode like one of the main bad guys as dlc...). \n\nThe roster is at its all time worst at 30 characters with no x-men or really many highly requested characters like Wesker or captain commando, but given trash characters like Spencer or firebrand, yet they're gonna charge us... $30 USD for 6 dlc characters that were already in the game files? (In the big leak venom, winter soldier, monster hunter and obviously black panther/sigma were shown to have files in a build of mvci)
Stop the hate DBFZ fanboys!!!!\n\nYou don't like MARVEL vs. CAPCOM?\nfine, leave the fans alone idiots. Stop gloating about DBFZ. I'm sick and tired of every MARVEL vs. CAPCOM having DBFZ fanboys trashing.\n\nYou fanboys think that DBFZ is the center of attention. But its not.\n\nYou guys like to gloat?\nWell... I'm a dbz fan but I'm not interesting in it. I'm interested in MARVEL vs. CAPCOM: INFINITE.\n\nSo stop it right now!!!!
Just clicked for that Megaman X statue, was tempted to get that but the price was way too high and I was only interested in that X statue.
The only Capcom Collector's Edition that is worth it in my opinion is Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.
What is up with those Infinity eggs they look nothing like the box art!\nExpectations: Crystal clear translucent looking stones\nReality: Poorly painted easter eggs.
Isn't this false advertising? Can't you sue for this kind of thing
These toys look like the ones you get on a happy meal lol good thing i canceled my pre order on this shit i knew it was not worth $200
There's a lot in there It better be, this thing costs 200 dollars
The one I'm personally least interested in is Captain Marvel\nUh oh. Better watch out that those Disney lawyers don't flag your video! :D
the figures look cheap but pretty well detailed. nothing  like RE5 snow globe level bullshit. the infinity stones however look like fucking dollar store plastic easter eggs
It's the dark souls estus flask all over again
Oh right, this game is coming out. Forgot about it due to the poor roster.
Fix the description. It's not Mega Man, it's Mega Man X. How dare you get that wrong. Unsubscribed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously though, fix it.
Those are literally plastic easter eggs from AliExpress or GearBeast or some shit with cheap LEDs lodged under them. This brings a whole new meaning to I'm gonna take you for a ride.
Figures look OK. Stones look bad. Roster looks meh. Mechanics look fun. I have no idea how to feel about this.
Wait what? The stone looks different....  The figures doesn't look good either. I've seen better figures. Not worth for $140 for figures.($140 figures + $60 games) Glad I downgrade to standard. I hope the game is good. 4 days left. \nThanks you for the video.
I wonder how many of these editions they sent to GameStop. I bet all those unsold boxes are taking up so much room.\n\nSpeedy Diver is gonna have a blast finding these.
I love X but what the hell happened during the designing of the statue that made his leg curve like that
Sorry Carol Danvers fans\n\nHA! What fans?
Got 'em
Wow....\n\nGreat statues and Infinty Easter Eggs....
figures lol. they're statues.
Looks super cheap LMAOOO
Aha hahaha hahaha fucking capcom
wow, how much this crap cost?
cheap stuff
DOLLAR STORE EASTER EGGS
ahahahhahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Easter came early
i got scammed......LMFAOOOO!! No0o0o0o0!!1
Garbage
Why do you guys buy trash?
Uuhhh... uhhh... uhhh...
#InfinityEggs
LOL at morons who buy this garbage
😂😂😂
*INFINITE PASS*
This is hilariously bad
12:26\nHAHAHAHAHAHA\nAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Xmen? No okay bye
Was it worth it?
This is retarted why chui li it shouldve been ryu and megaman
I love the MvC franchise, but I'm not very excited about this game for many reasons. I might get the game, although there are so many other games to get.
1:20 who else saw the jew
I like the creativity they put to bring something new...
Part two of this movie will be war with ants 😂
#♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥\n*Based on love alone. God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die in our place. Then on the third day rose Him  from the dead.*\n*Now, though Jesus Christ alone. God has granted us the free gift of eternal life. He will save and heal you, if you ask Him.*
And the whole colony gets eaten by a pack of rats.
I cant wait someone step on them, that would be awesome.
I don't want get caught in the rain when downsized.
Are birds some predators for them now ?
Sideways is my all time favorite movie
So what are we some kind of downsizing?
I don't think the main problem here is bug or animals.It's the people who doesn't shrink.The tiny city is protected by these people and they build a dome to prevent other things to come in.And I doubt that they will make tiny guns.\nSo what if those people don't want to protect them,and try to rule them all?What can you do to fight them?As about 6 inches high,you can't fight them physically,cause to be honest,a normal can just step on you and crush you into nothing.You can't out run them,within one step they will catch up you and you're dead.Even you drive your tiny car,they can just run to you and stomp on the car with you in it and squashed it like a soda can,and you are also dead.\nEven if tiny people has their own tiny military,I can say one normal size marine can take down at least 100 tiny marine.He can just lay down on them and crush them all in to nothing.And your tiny guns won't do any harm to a normal size marine,they can't even penetrate their gear and won't gonna penetrate the sole of boots.\nSo what about heavy weapons?Sure,that would do some damage,but don't forget the normal size people has that too.They can just launch one missile and your whole city is gone.When you shrunk,you are inferior to all the other people who didn't shrink.\nAnd they give you 240 times money that can only be used in that city.The rich or the powerful just don't care these,cause they are already live a great life.But those who don't have a lot money will consider this,it's easier to live in the tiny city than outside.\nSo this movie reveal a new era of slavery and that what I thought about this movie.
Feel like the trailer showed that Kristin Wiig backs out of it.
and ants got into the mini city and killed everyone. this would be a great horror movie premise
God this movie is wrong in every way...
I think the sex perverts would capture you, then insert you into their anus.
How are they gonna deal with heavy rain or tornadoes?
Does Antman make a cameo or...?
Plot Twist, the movie is the ant bully but on a full scale.
Make em all small, then wipe em out with boot strikes! We could have more of everything for ourselves!
So the kids born from the downsized individuals would be downsize for the rest of their lives.\n\nThis would end up creating two separate classes of human beings. One the normal ones and the other the downsized ones. \nTensions would arise and then who would win. Are we seeing the start of the bleak apocalyptic movie franchise
Hang on. How can the normal sized people hear the small people. They'd be talking at very high frequencies.
Somehow, nobody in this movie seems to have a clue that when you are smaller, you don't react the same to gravity.
I was waiting for them all to be attacked by insects/rats/birds, drowned by a small rain shower or for the people who didn't shrink to turn on them (since their basically helpless) and that being their real solution to over population...Apparently I am either way more cynical than I thought or general stupidity brings out the worse in me.
That's Dave ! Dave Johnson ! And Caroll !\nALRIGHT BUT I WANT TO KNOW IF THAT'S A PORTAL REFERENCE
It's like the Attack on Titan but different.
So that's it huh? we're some kind of Downsizing?
I bet Ant-Man feels pretty stupid now.....
That's cute 😊😊
JASON AND KRISTEN???? AND MATT?? AND CHRISTOPH??????? WOW
what ? what? whaaaaattt?
My wife had me searching for mark wahlbergs new film, she meant this one the stupid cow.
Finally an original idea 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
What if it rains?
wait.. so if they downsize, what will happen to their brain? will their IQ also be downsized, so we will end up with a movie with the combined IQ of a  chimp?
1:52 i have a feeling this conflict is going to be people get drawn in with nice stuff expensive things they wouldnt normally have and then they get fucked over. and its like what are you gonna do, tell em no? youre tiny fam no ones gonna listen to you
My cat would kill them.
What if some insect comes by? Thinking about giant spiders gives me nightmares.
Just go to google and simply type: *gexxguides* You'll get the only real working clash of clans working tool in the 2017
So they have the technology to shrink people but not colonize other planets? Little odd
Wait... notice how Kristen Wiig doesn't appear after Matt Damon is shrunk? Maybe she backs out or dies during the downsizing?
Something is not right with this movie I mean it's just too good to be true.
Wouldn't the voices actually sound really high pitched at that size?
It would just take 1 praying mantis to wipe off leisure land.
I can't wait for Cinema Sins with Neil DeGrass Tyson on this...
This is such a fucking unique idea I've never seen. Wow!
My grand-mother tried downsizing once, and now she's in a little urn!
Right for the people talking about the spiders etc. \nThey have their own environment, safe if you ever took a second to look there's a Big ass land for them. No spiders or any other bullshit. :)
This creeps me out a lot more than it should...
What about cockroaches and spiders and all the other creepy crawlers?  F**k that!!!
Obviously gravity is a big problem when shrunk to this size but of course its just a movie....
The revolutions in surgery!
looks like an interesting idea but makes u wonder who would still wanna continuing working after being Downsized if their money translates to something u can retire on. I'm talking about those movers
A bit confused by this, what's the conflict of the story? Will we have to wait until later trailers to see what the struggles are?
You know there is going to be a scene where they're running from a bunch of seagulls. I bet there will be.
This is a good concept!\nBut think about this,\nThere will be Bugs, Animals,And maybe people who don't want to do this or maybe terrorists \nWhich are bigger than Them and can Pretty much kill Us Humans just by stepping on Humans
and then hurricane comes...
Go down to the size of a grasshopper? That affects lots of things. A lot of animals just got added to our list of dangerous predators. Water surface tension? Strength-to-weight ratio lets us jump much higher. Hailstorms can wreck shit on our property. We need around one billion of us to remain regular-sized to watch over all human activities.
The inventor's name better be Wayne Szalinski. That's all I'm saying.
Seems innovative and fun, but where is the conflict??
Great film! I recommend seeing it
I came here from Once In A Lifetime by the Talking Heads
If you herre that small, you would have died becasue of lack of oxygen and suffer blindness
that is such a good idea love the creativity of people today
It would be a shame if I torched the neighborhood with a match and my foot
Operator : 911 Emergency!!! \nMatt : These creepy RATS are attacking my villa to eat me and my wife.\nOperator : Sir, Hold on, Rodent Control Services are on there way right now. Just don't get caught. Happy Downsizing
Everyone please report these Webcam/Pornsites Comments. Thank you!
Looks great... Till the bugs come..
I hope we don't discover Pym particles. Shrinking the human population would make more problems then it solves
WHAT the FUCK i am SO IN
that looks completely insane yet i really wanna watch it
How do you shrink a car? You make a big one then shrink it? sounds more expensive\nAnd if you tell me you make a small one, how do you make a small smart phone? You can't make components that small
You could also save the planet by having World War 3, killing off most of the human population.  I think the most realistic solution would be to limit reproduction, but that'll never happen when retards keep having 10+ kids and the responsible beings barely have 1 child.  The movie Idiocracy accurately predicted the future.
Once in a life time works so well with this
Just looks like a fun happy sci-fi movie.
Jimmy Kimmel is ready with the jokes.
the music sold it for me
I want to see a spin on this idea and make it into a horror movie.\n\n\nImagine what you could do with that.
this is a message from The Illumanati that this will be our new future.
Calling it now...at the end of the movie we find out who is responsible for the actual downsizing procedure and that Rick Moranis has come out of retirement to play Wayne Szalinski again!
Yeah, just wait until nature gets to them! Weather, animals, insects, etc.
this is the most fascinating trailer I've seen all year.
Another massive Jewish propaganda piece - this whole film it's just a metaphor for the shrinking of western civilisation and people on the global scale. They're laughing at us. Look at 1:20, that's a very specific shot. Look who's in the background sealing their fate. Fuck. You. (((Hollywood))) !
this is no comedy? wtf? i just dont get why anyone would make a movie out of this bullshit. its like a kid wrote the script. fuck that

This is so adorable!! 😭😭😭 I want to do this with all of my little animal babies
Aw look at his little old man feet. He's adorable and was a very well behaved stamp. Mine would have me and the house covered in paint but not the paper! I actually got a print of one of my boys just after he passed, I wanted to keep a print of them all. But I forgot so only did 1 which sucks. But think I'll start from now on to do alongside my photos of them in my memories scrapbook. This was so cute x
This is so cute, I wanna try this with my ratties <3
i really liked the editing style of this video.

I love your videos
Get another rat please I mean... You should get another rat...
you should make an etsy shop!!
We love you so much!!
It came out amazing 💕🐁
I lost one of my ratty girls this time last year that I was very close to. Before we lost her, we pressed her feet into a soft piece of fimo, baked it and then had it silver plated and popped in a frame. Little more expensive way of doing things, but she was worth it, and now we have little silver pawprints to remember her by 🐀 (you could always paint the baked fimo or leave it as it is too)
yeeeees!! a beautiful video with the beautiful little lou bean <3 loved this
Watching this weirdly enough comforted me. Been crying since my other half is traveling for 3 weeks from today and anxiety has kicked in (the whole what if this happens to him? Or omg what if he doesn't come back). So thank you for this. It really calmed me 🙂
This is BRILLIANT!!! What a awesome idea, thank you. I'm getting my boys and doing this RIGHT now lol. And my dogs as well and my mouse..
I had to say goodbye to my gorgeous baby hammy today and I'm feeling pretty devastated. This video was precious, and really soothed me.🐹✨😘
oh goodness i'm crying at that little card, so cute!!
Aw I want a little Louie! I'm warming to rats since watching your videos 😊 just need to find rats from a nice home or place first xx
This was such a lovely video :') <3
Such a beautiful video!\nWhat brand of watercolor paint do you use? Where did you get your water color brush(es)?
PLEASE MAKE MORE RAT VIDEOS HE IS SUCH A GOOD BOY
Little rat paw prints would make such a cute small tattoo!
You are such a lovely human. I'd love to drink tea with you and have ratty cuddles xx
Aw, what a well behaved stamp indeed! I'm not sure if it would require too much pressure, but maybe imprint his paws in some clay?
I did this with my hamster and I ended up just diluting the food coloring with water and soaking a paper towel with the mixture. That way he could just keep running though the colors and on to the paper. Worked really nicely and didn't fade! If you try it again I recommend this method ❤️
This was such a precious idea! 💕\n\nI was also a rat mother for three years. My little man's name was Moon and I plan on getting a tattoo for him in the near future. He had two sisters, Starlight and Dreamer, but they did not make it because they were weened off of their mother too early. Moon was a fighter and he made it, then he made my life grand. My father originally got them as food for one of our reptiles, but they were just too cute and my father then switched all of our lizard's food to frozen mice, eggs, and crickets. Moon came into my life at a really important time, I was 17 years-old and had gotten some bad news about my health. So he made me a mother and he was the best pet ever. I wish I had done a cute little art project like this with him.\n\nThank you so much for sharing your and Louie's adventures and love with us. ❤️
This is such a lovely video :) my girlfriend and I have 4 rats, Kronos, Zeus, Hades and Poseidon. I've been looking for a gift idea for her and she happens to adore the rats, so this is something I could give her as a gift :)
This is an adorable idea... I think I know what my little rat is doing this weekend.
What a great idea! I'll have to do this with my kitties!
yup, definitely doing this tonight with my girls. I don't have food coloring but I think beetroot juice and some butterfly pea tea will do just fine.
I misread this as painting WITH ratson, idea for better video
Beautiful! Loved this idea! Makes me want to do this with my corgi.
I love this so much, ratties are such beautiful little creatures, and it's wonderful to see I'm not the only one who's a crazy rat mumma! So adorable ❤️
Maybe just test out the non toxic paints before you subject Lou to it haha. Test it on the paper you intend to use and nail polishes or other clear preservatives over top to see if it holds. (I never think of this shit before I try new things either) I thought you were going to lay down a cardboard maze with the paper underneath it with a thin layer of paint near the beginning which he would track through. You could make one cardboard maze, rotate it, put a different paint near the start, and even if you didn't get good prints you would have paint scuffles that have an artistic winding to them. \n\nMy personal anecdote related to paw painting: I was in the living room of a rental painting with India ink on the table. I don't even remember what I was drawing! So I finish up, mostly clean up and go take a shower. I never know what to do with the remaining watered down India ink. I'm not going to pour it back in but it seems a waste to toss it. So I left it out on the table. I go into my room after my shower and realize my cat, who never does this, is under my bed. He seems distressed. I realize there's a few India ink paw print tracks in my room and the living room and the table. It made me laugh so much. I managed to clean it all up, except for a blurred par print on the stone of the propane fireplace. So he left his mark there. (And I did get my deposit back). I almost wish he had tracked it over paper so I could have kept it. He also luckily didn't get sick. It was pretty cute to see him ashamed. It was so unusual and so interesting that he seemed to grasp the concept that he did something wrong.
Omg that is such a good idea! I might do that with my kitty, probably have to leave a trail of treats for her to do it but it'd be fun. \nWish we did that for my sister's and my previous pet ratties and miceys. Sadly my sister's eldest rat Jerry passed away this evening :( Lou reminds me alot of him actually, such a cutie pie he was. He's in ratty heaven now with his brother Ben (they was names after the brand Ben & Jerrys icecream).
This is so sweet! Such a lovely idea, I might have to have a go with my pets... although the horse will be rather interesting to do...
I started with a hamster, and I have mice now... but it's gonna have to be ratties next! I love him!!!! <3
This is so precious I'm crying aaaaa it came out so well 😭❤️
This video is so precious! I love it! (^_^)
you are sooooo creative :) you have to get one of your leaf drawings tattooed
That is the cutest bloody thing! 💕
LOVED this video! It was so sweet to see such a special moment between you and Louis. :) Perhaps my favorite video of yours all year! <3
More painting with Louis! I love it
I love all your videos but this is just so cute, it's such an original idea as well 😊❤️
I was just going to add next time maybe just mash up some blueberries and raspberries to use as paints? It would have more of a watercolor effect but could be more effective when drying and safe for little bean to lick himself clean! :D Loved this video and I want to try it with my boys now too <3 xo
I am gonna do this with my rats! 💖🐀
Watching this with my 4 rattos clambering over me. Must try something similar, they're really lovely.
Next time you could try using really well mashed blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, or pomegranates. All of them should be completely safe for him to eat and they stain really well. I've tried painting with them before and would recommend doing a test on paper to see what you like most because the colors will change as they dry. They might stain his fur for a bit though.
Painted by Lou and mum 😭 that is the cutest!!! Xx
This is such a sweet and creative idea! Lou is so adorable, such a sweet little rat 🐀. They look awesome and I love the little card 🌟. Such a cute picture 💖.
This is the most precious thing I've ever seen I would buy these pieces done by a beauty and a bean ❤️
this is the best video i've ever seen
oh my goooooood. i wanna do this with my babies. but they are not as keen on being held without having their feet supported... so cute <3
this is a great idea. not sure my recent boys will like getting painty feet...hmmmm
your rattie art is gorgeous ! i managed to get footprints in that foamy air drying clay that u use for babies handprints of my two g.pig boys Pumpkin and Erik.
Such a cute idea! I wish I were as creative as you are. Would love to have something similar from my dog, Molly ❤️
I love this idea! So cute, I tried doing this with my ratties when they were little using kids paint, it didn't work very well because they were very frantic little beans running about, but kids paint is non-toxic so that might be an option to use if you try again?  🐀❤️
RATTIESSS!\nI love all your videos but your rattie videos are my fave <3
I just saw the 5 seconds that play when you hover over a video and my heart just melted and I exploded in 'AWWWHH's when I saw little bean painting!! <3 now ill actually have to carry on watching!
Try using hair spray over the prints. 😊
I had a big ol' smile the entire time I watched this video! What an adorable idea!! <3
Oh goodness, his feet are SO CUTE!
Kiera- I need to thank you so so so much for this video. 1)i love rats 2) your painting was so good so so nice. This idea made me tear up a little, because its so much more than a picture. It's something ur little rat touched and made. I will do this with my pets. <3
awww this is so sweet!! what a talented little bean! I want to do this with my two girls now :') <3
I'm crying this is so cute!!! You are such a great rattie mum! Staying home to be with him is the sweetest :))))))
I used fimo clay (which you can bake) to make my rats paw prints.\nI softened the clay really well (you can get a specific clay softer, but I just used my hands) dunked their feet in flour and 'stamped' them. Really quick and you can turn the prints into a necklace charm!
STEPPIE STAMP! How cute <3
R.I.P   DAR DAR BEEN

Is he a dumbo rat? I LOVE his floppy ears
Please tell me where you got that frame from? Iv been looking for one just like it to put pictures in from when me and my boyfriend went on the Harry Potter tour. Thank you!
your rat really needs another rat friend. im sure you can find another male around the same age.
Can someone please explain to me how this is trending? Only has 11k views
I think it would be fine to use a non-toxic paint and pop him straight in the bath afterwards. It's such a sweet idea and such a special thing to have, it's a shame for them to fade away. How old is Louis? He's such a gorgeous boy and looks so young and spry.
Nothing against you but, why do you call an animal your son, you know it's not. If you wanna have a son go and make yourself a proper one.
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\n14,000 Views in 2 Days = 16 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?

Damn. I was really expecting that ladybug to get blown over like the last one. Stupid ladybug.
Let's have more fun with the different breeds of chicken like fried chicken, popcorn chicken, buffalo chicken (or buffalo wings?), or chicken cordon bleu.

You forgot to say that the chicken breast has to be T H I C C and J U I C Y
I'm new to YSAC, and the only thing I don't like about his videos is the way how he says Pepper pepper pepper. Like for real, how fucking cheesy do you have to be in order to say pepper 3 times? Why not only 1 time? What's wrong with you?
You are taking How To Basic to the next level dude +You Suck At Cooking

YSACism is the goal, not minimalism!
To all those people who asked how you edited that last part, I wanna clear up that that bit isn't edited. I tried this recipe and it is actually that juicy.

I'm glad I found this channel
400degrees fahrenheit,  celsius or kelvin?
Is this an actual cooking tutorial
Anyone else have reservations about this channel? The humor (people claim) is top notch but, after watching many videos, it seems like the same I have ADHD and I'm really not clever but everyone thinks I'm a god type of channels, I swear, I've seen dozens of these. It feels like zfrank and a milder htb had a baby, can be clever and entertaining on occasion but 72% of the time it's just braindead comedy that highschool girls go crazy over:/

Considering how many people are born and raised outside of their native countries these days; I'd say this is all too relatable and it's obvious why it hit the front page :P
This was me in Korea 😂 true story
This is how i feel when i´m drunk
At this moment...\nProZD knew...\n\n\nHE FUCKED UP😎🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's been shown that typically your native language is lost within 3 generations if you live in another country. I hate how ignorant my relatives and parents are. If you primarily speak English in public for 15 plus years youre gonna lose your language a bit no shit. I mean that's the whole idea of school isnt it. Now on the other hand in can still speak and understand my native tongue but i dont diss on people who can't because I understand its only bound it happen.
ASL in a nutshell. You're supposed to sign with a lot of Deaf people to get better, but dammit when their hands are a blur and you're just standing there, regretting your life decisions, it SUCKS\n\n\nAND YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE SIGN FOR SORRY

This is every conversation I had with my 8th grade French teacher
😂😂😂😂 I know. I been in America long time....#sad
So, I'm 1/8th German, but my family left their homeland over 200 years ago, and just married other Germans for like, 150 years.  No one in my family speaks German, but we all look very German.  So when I went to Berlin, people kept asking for directions, and I'm just like o_o
Oh it’s wayyyyyyy harder for me cause both of my parents are from different states in India and mostly every state has a different language and they both sound very similar so it’s sooo awkward when I mix up the words with my family
When your french teacher asked a question you didn't understand and reply with with a 'oui'

That's it. I had know idea and this was in front of my maths class too. I just laughed off the humiliation.

Probably my favourite album of all time ! :-)
my all-time favorite r.e.m. album.  i only listen to the album on rainy days.
This album is a real masterpiece. Thank you R.E.M.
Automatic For The People changed my life.
Beautiful album, great memories
Where’s Michael?
This album makes me wanna turn photographer, work with art, create something that matters.... Thank you REM!
Yesssssss
Wow! Two of the most impressive alternative rock albums of all time are getting re-released this year. R.E.M's #Automatic25 and The Smiths #TQID Both are on the list of my all time favorites.
When Peter says nothing else that came out that year sounded like that I was thinkingUm Yeah?! That's why you guys were great! Same could be said for Out of Time or Life's Rich Pageant, etc. A band that can write Wendell Gee and Turn you Inside Out, I mean, come on. As for AFTP Star me Kitten and Find the River get me every time. Millsey's background vocals are legend.
They never went wrong with Scott Litt. The best producer ever right after George Martin ! Good interviews with Peter and Scott !
OK, I've finally settled on my ranking of R.E.M albums from best to worst, and wish to share it with the world:\n\n1.) FIVE WAY TIE: Chronic Town/Murmur/Reckoning/Fables of the Reconstruction/Life's Rich Pageant\n2.) Out of Time\n3.) Monster\n4.) THREE WAY TIE: Document/Green/Automatic for the People\n5.) TWO WAY TIE: Up/Accelerate\n6.) THREE WAY TIE: New Adventures in Hi-Fi/Around the Sun/Collapse into Now\n7.) Reveal\n\nI'd enjoy a fierce debate with fellow YouTubers :)
I'm hating this video solely due to the fact that they whacked a honking great big preview add on their imitation of life video. Please get rid of it.
One of the greatest albums of all time
Magic, I will be getting this, well done including demos and particularly photograph 👍🏻
25 years. This music is still in my heart. Forever!
Wow! The deluxe edition sounds incredible! Dream scenario right now would be having an awesome surround sound stereo and a weekend to listen to all of their 25th anniversary editions.
Bem que eles poderiam fazer um turne de despedida
Phenomenal work

Thank you
Meu álbum favorito!
Lindo.📀🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶
Where's Bill? A big part of this album seemingly deleted from history.
I bought AFTP in 1995- I was fourteen.  I would listen to it through headphones and I'd cry myself to sleep...but not because it brought me sadness--  it was just so beautiful.  Try Not to Breathe still makes me cry every time I listen to it.
Not their best album, but still cool.
You can grab a piece and go The fact that you guys think I wont eat the entire thing in one go is adorable. Misguided, but adorable.
Berry bark.\nWoof.\n\nI am DEAD, you guys are so awesome.
I'm berry pleased about this recipe.
Who cares about the food. I'm wondering where Barry's jacket is from
*Does SortedFood consciously have Barry in your berry-related videos?*
em-BARRY-sing
3:46 *woah*
a little bit of honey ... 😂😂
Not sure if they have them in Britain, but my favorite ice lolly is the orange creamsicle.
It's soo pretty and Pink
Cannot wait to try this!!
Lower in fat; lower in sugar; delicious. You're contradicting yourself when you say that.
You guys should use lavender in more recipes, it's honestly one of my favorite flavors.
where's the sprig of mint
My God, Barry has become very handsome. He is down right dreamy.
lavender, drop a sprig or two of mint in when blending, then drizzle the top with melted chocolate  before freezing?  or even some green tea macha...hmm
This is very similar to my mamma's home made ice cream. She only uses three ingredients. Greek yogurt. Fruit (usually raspberries since I'm allergic to strawberries) and caster sugar. That's it, than she shoves in her ice-cream maker for several hours to let it thicken. We keep the seeds from the raspberries in as we think it makes it taste more interesting. I think I'll add honey next time to see the results.
We don't get Greek Yogurt where I live. Can I use normal yogurt?
This looks like a winner!
Yay, I got featured in a video ^_^
Now I know how else I can use my frozen berries I bought sometime back. THANK YOU
Why Greek yogurt? I hate Greek yogurt. It tastes of cream cheese. Would a different yogurt work for this?
given that your carbonara took me 45 minutes to make, this seems right up my alley. :)
Hi I'm a long time lover of your channel and I'm going off to uni on Sunday, it would be kinda cool if you did some budget friendly, student friendly dishes
How long can these last in the freezer? Thanks!
Wow I think I wanna give this a go!
Bung some bacon in it.
u could make a nutella frozen bark.. just  blend nutella yogurt and frozen banana with a bit of vanilla...!! perfect for a chocoholic ♥__♥
Great timing - now summer is over! ;)
Would this use with a coconut or soy yoghurt instead? :)
Oo you could do coconut yoghurt, with mango pieces and lime zest 👌🏼
I really wanted to try this recipe but I am allergic to lavender. Is there an alternative
What did he call the cranberries
Does any yoghurt work? Or only greek yoghurt?
I just want to say, I started watching your videos because theyre fun to watch but I dont rlly cook\nBut recently I had a cooking class (weird for a science major, i know, but seeing how geeky Ben is it prob makes sense) and your videos help a lot so thanks
I love these Kenwood made better videos! Sponsoring made right! :) I'm always in search for something healthy but indulgent and rich that can fool me and satisfy my cheat needs, so this videos are perfect ahah
Looks delicious but bad for people with sensitive teeth
What about adding some mint to the mix, just to give it that kick? Mint and berries are great together! (Plus, it would make Ben happy😂)
Look awesome guys!!! But I wonder if we can do it with lime and mint? I love the sour taste and if it won't work just add some rum and booomm we just created a freaking mojito ice cream!!! :))
Ok but Barry looks like a Matalan model. I'm not complaining!
so simple, but looks so good!  would goat's milk yogurt work instead of regular (cow)??
literally about to go make this right now
LAVENDER? Who are you and what did you do with Ben's mint?
in love with Barry's hair😍
I don't know if I keep missing the videos or have they stopped announcing what the next week's theme is? I haven't seen the mystery box in a while and you guys haven't been directing us to the website for a sneak peak on next week's theme as far as I know? Are they announcing all of their stuff on other social media now?\nI'm so confused >.<\n\nAlso I know this is an ad and is likely unrelated to what you guys are doing this week.
man this looks sooo good 😭 once i get discharged from the hospital, i am so making this!!
Ben can't replace mint with lavender. What has the world come to?
it's so fast it's almost emBERRYssing
Berry's poor heart shattered faster then the bark did as Ben destroyed it😂
So I've made this before and my problem with it is that it's too cold to bite into, but when it is warm enough to bite into it makes a huge mess all over your fingers. Does anyone else have this problem and any solutions?
Can you use any replacements for the lavender?
After seeing the headline, I was sure you were going to finish the video by stuffing frozen yogurt and tree bark down Barry's pants. And I'm kind of disappointed it didn't happen.
How can I get rid of the ice crystals? I had problems finding a large tray so it became a bit thicker than I wanted it to be... Will it have a smoother texture if I make it thinner or is there any trick for it?
Em(berry)sing to call a recipe
looks so good this guys, whats the texture like?
Calm down Ben! Just coz it's easy doesn't mean it's embarrassing as a recipe.  You're embarrassing. As a snob. 😑
My father has been making this homemade ice cream for years and years. It's the easiest thing ever and it's so good, only ever eaten it as soft serve
Forgot to call it an #ad.
Soooo....can I do it with cheese and bacon?
What is a lollie?  I'm from Canada 🇨🇦. \n\nThis looks awesome! Way to go! Also love the humour.
Ben, you are the star of this show...you could have your own channel.
any video that involves berries *has* to have Barry in it. this is a rule
Where can you get a packet of Lavender in herb form?
I have the same blender...can recommend if anyone is intersted.
I am sad cz i can't have these 😯
Here's a recipe that I've always been curious to try but never have cuz I never found a recipe: *Lavender Ice Cream*\nI saw the ice cream in the movie It's Complicated and I've always wondered how you put lavender in ice cream.\nMight I request this recipe from you guys at SORTED Food?
This is a quick to make, quick to eat recipe. You literally have to eat it quick, otherwise you get froyo fingers 😃 I would try it though, if it wasn't 16 degrees outside... 🤒
I knew barry's actual bark was coming but i still laughed really hard
Very up-town.  Can also be done with bananas and chocolate if berries aren't your thing and chocolate is..
nice! will make that
The two best things in life have come together.\n\nI've always love white chocolate bark, and frozen yoghurt. THE DREAMS ARE ALIVE.
Twisters
I'm so jealous of Barry's eyebrows
i was wondering if you could make this with pumpkin and ginger snaps for a autumn style?
This is doing to be a healthy snack😍
Definitely going to try this one! Not sure about grab and go, maybe grab shove in my face before it melts all over my hand
YUM!
I will skip lavender.
You didn't listen did you. 😂😂😂😂
Please some more healthy frozen foods pls
Ohhhh sassy Ben You didn't listen, did you?
Ok this, but mint choc chip orrrrrrrr, who knows, endless choices.
Nom
Ice lollys is a dumb name for a popsicle.  Lollipop + Icicle is better than Ice + Lollipop.  Wait.  Hmmmmm....
Cherry brandy was my fav
FAB ICE LOLLIES!!!!!!!
Ben marry me 😘
It looks so yummy 😋
Zaps were the best!!
Genius!😍
Berries too tangy? This goes perfectly with frozen ripe bananas.
hi
I don't like yogurt. Could you do this with ice cream?
looks shit
😍 I wish I weren't on a diet
I can't even stand the smell of lavander, i will never understand why people eat it !
Mini Milks for the Win!! I loved them as a kid too! The vanilla or chocolate were the best \n\n(That's the milk lolly Ben is talking about at the beginning)
Seems delicious, but with the cold and (kind of) stormy weather I would much rather have something warm or comforting. Any chance you guys will make some autumny recipes?
Looks lovely and will be making it with my grandchildren but does it not melt fast?
Can anyone explain to me what lavender would taste like? Besides lavender of course... Whenever I hear of adding a flavor like rose or lavender I get this vision of eating soap or perfume.
Hey I hope you enjoy this new video! Some 370 of you got to see this early as I accidentally pressed the button that I didn't mean to press so the video was live for about a minute this morning, but here's the real version!\n\nMake sure to check out Squarespace because this video *literally* would not have happened without their support.
Teleporters would put all airlines out of business
No word on thec chineese Comac? Feels like they are going to have an impact on the market simply by state subsidy..
Airbus a321ER?
If solar panels became super efficient, they could build an airliner that has really long range. In fact, it would just keep flying, following the sun. Then they could load and unload passengers like aerial refueling. That's the future!!!!
ah cool saw clip of N323AS getting refueled. Iv been on that plane before!
I would say the A350 XWB would be a great replacement for the 757 ? efficient, has a massive range and can carry enough passengers to make it worth while .
I'm not quite sure, after doing very little research, if they have chosen an engine provider for this design. I work for an aviation company as a tube fabricator and I believe that ultimately Boeing will go with the more well known product. Our market share is and will continue to grow. The Paris Air Show was a huge success for us, and our demand is through the roof. Everybody has to travel...
can you convert the miles into Toyota Corollas please? thank you
I always love seeing my old co-worker Dennis on these videos fueling airplanes.
Wouldn't an A330 or perhaps an A321 be considered a similar replacement for the ageing 757's? I get that it's a different manufacturer and therefore added base costs on maintenance but it's still  a viable option, no?
I think there is too much overlap between capacities and sizes even today, why not just use a 787-8 and carry less fuel?
Short distances the high speed train will always win door to door due the time you have to spend at airports before and after flying and the location of airports outside major cities. For example center of London to center of Paris on Eurostar is 2 hrs 16 min.  Flight time London to Paris is 1hr 20 min plus getting to and from the airports, Plus booking in and security.
0:33 bitch be texting for then 50 minutes
Lol the train from London to Edinburgh is both more expensive and less convenient than flying. That's why I chose the BA flight for a recent trip. Flyby may have been even faster, but BA is so much nicer.
I'm not sure we have 15-20 years left.
did you seriously just mention the hyperloop? LOL
Regional flights might be quicker....but air security will take you about an hour of your time. 30 minute flight + 1 hour at security. No...I'd rather take the train.
All Airbus needs to do is to release an A310neo and Boeing 797 will be *cooked*.
I just checked the times for the BA A320 flight from Edinburgh to London and the same flight for Fly Be with their D8D. TIme is the same about 65-70 minutes for BOTH. So you are lying. You simply cant compare it this way. Planes dont fly at maximum speed they have cruising speed. Moreover on this specific flight D8D reaches usually cruising altitude of 25000 feet while A320 BA reaches cruising altitude of 33 000 feet. Different cruising altitude in this case is there for better fuel efficiency of both planes. While D8D uses the 25 000 feet as the maximum altitude the Airbus goes higher to achieve better fuel efficiency. And finally on such a short flight it is obvious that the Airbus wont be there much earlier because of earlier descent and on such a short flight you cant see the difference even though the Airbus cruises about 200-250km/h faster than D8D.\nThree of your last videos are really meh...
Do a video about concept planes such as the x-57 Maxwell and the Boeing Blended Wing body and their potential impact on the industry
When you're talking about trains and electric planes, you have to consider that the American train system is awful everywhere else than the Northeast, so they could potentially dominate the market in the Western united States
United Airlines is plane boring. Also, there is no such thing as a 797. Nothing beats the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
I wonder if soon flying across the Atlantic may become cheaper than $200
You never mentioned the Boeing 747-40, which I am told is dying out, even though I still see loads of them at all of the airports I go to. Can someone elaborate on this please?
Short-haul flight doesn't make a lot of sense... if the city doesn't have a small, more accessible airport.\n\nAnyone who has commuted from London to Heathrow, from NYC to JFK knows that. The commute itself is almost 1 hour with another 1.5 hour check-in time.
Isn't the plane of the future just a car or did we give up on the whole flying car thing?
Wow, Boeing is building a new cattle car for the sky! YAY!
Need hypersonic aircraft
The 787 is the Middle Spot aircraft it is for long skinny routes. The 787 was created just to replace 757, not the 777. The 737 MAX was not made to replace the 757. It's purpose is to refresh the 737 series. The 797 will be a high capacity short range aircraft for routes such as New York to Los Angeles, and New York to Chicago. There is no need for electric aircraft at this point, we still have enough gas at this point to have no demand for an electric aircraft. Plus switching to electric would be a huge fundamental change in aviation no one was asking for. The a350 and the 787 will be sufficient for the next 20-50 years.
Umm...planes are already cheaper than buses in a lot of markets
This is a similar thing they said about the Concorde, which could travel 2x the speed of light
I expected better from the Boeing 797. Also, who's a Boeing fan?
Are aircraft manufacturers ever again going to build a plane that doesn't look like a facsimile of the 737.... ever??
Edinburgh to London is far cheaper to fly, the state of trains in the UK is abysmal.
The plausibility of electric transports has to be considered in question until it is proven not. The most plausible version of the idea, I suppose, is a fuel cell, but a fuel cell does not eliminate the need to carry the fuel necessary to support powered flight. I am not sure about the idea of short haul airplanes replacing the train. The airport has to be gotten to and there has to be screening and boarding. All of this means the process of flying inevitably has to be extremely time consuming even if the time in the air is brief. Boarding an intercity train, even for a trip of some hours, need not be more complicated than boarding a bus or a commuter train. The problem with the train, at least in the United States, is that issue of providing short and medium haul train service is tied to plethora of hobbyhorse issues, notably the idea of downtown-to-downtown service. The problem is, downtowns have their drawbacks. They are often are congested and hard to get into and out of and that they may no longer have the infrastructure necessary to provide for the needs of travelers, especially accommodations and car rental.\n\nThe state of California, where I live, right now is spending tens of billions of dollars building a high speed rail line through rural Central California which most likely will end of being a train to nowhere for many decades to come. In reality, the state could set up commuter-grade service between Los Angeles and the Bay Area with stops in San Jose, Salinas, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Burbank within literal weeks if the will was there. Notably, all accommodations would be available on both ends of the run due to proximity to already operating airports. No, I don't think short haul airplanes are a real competitor to trains, provided the trains are sited properly. At or near airports or in suburban locations would be better options for the end terminals that this downtown-to-downtown idiocy. In between, the existing terminals of the smaller cities would be adequate. VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) could change this picture somewhat, but it could be pricey and an option only for the high end traveler.
I feel like this video was a bit boeing biased.
Boeing 777 X don't fail me now!
The airliner of the future will be a single engine powered aircraft. It will start life as a short distance carrier over land in order to prove its viability/safety/reliability but will eventually gain some kind of an TESOPS  ( The Engine Spins Or People Swin )rating allowing it to travel great distances over water just as the twin engine powered airliners of today proved themselves.
Well from what I have seen much lighter carbon fibre composite planes with much improved engine efficiency and wing span profile improvements are fast approaching are set to be the the next step in aviation advancement.\n\nTho I think we should also look at having hybrid solar planes... we already have light aircraft making use of solar tech and much more efficient solar panel tech on the way.
Train prices in the UK are ballooning so much that in some routes I've travelled it's cheaper already by the plane.\nFlybe Manchester to Southampton for instance.
Can you please make a video about how flights get their flight numbers.
find your airline videos rather insightful, if you ever have time any idea what happens to flights when they get disrupted from hurricanes? because that throws airlines into chaos
You forgot about the A321LR... It has the range of a 757, maybe even more, and seats approx. 200
we never say that word united
Wendover Productions? More like Bendover Productions. Just like that and you're a subsidiary of Brazzers well done 👍
Wait, so Airbus already has a 757 competitor? And nobody's buying it? That makes no sense.
SOOOOOOO Much Boeing bias in this video! Lots more companies then Boeing, you have Airbus, Bombardier and more!
Do a video tackling the gulf carriers!
The video is phenomenal. Thank you!\n\nIt is phenomenal even you said electric motors are weak. They are the most powerful motors ever created ;). In power plants 3 turbines often move a single electric motor more that 1MW power ;).
never say edinburgh again please
Damn, I clicked on this hoping to be watching a video full of those planes in the beginning of the video, but this is so.. real..  It's like clicking on a video called The Car of the Future and the video goes into depth on the 2019 Toyota Camry. Yes, I guess that is technically the future, but it's not future enough, and it's pretty boring.
Over here in the UK train tickets are so expensive that it is often cheaper to fly. Or people just take a coach which is dirt cheap.
The plane of the future needs everything you said in the beginning except for personal jets for everyone. For 200. dollars you can go anywhere in the world in 1-4 hrs on the plane of the future. Now what we need is trains of the future.
May I know where the source list is?
I hate to burst your bubble, but trains tickets will always be cheaper than train tickets, because more customers will be en route, at ANY given time on a train route, compared to an airplane route.  Higher turnover means more $ for the company, and lower costing tickets...
Fuck I want a plane
European aviation channels typically talk about Airbus, just as Americans typically talk about Boeing. Do any of you people THINK before you complain or does it just come naturally to bitch about the most trivial shit?
Planes will have to become electric in the next 50 years because we're gonna run out of oil. The future is exciting, who will make the best electric planes? Tesla??
This channel is getting known, Wendover! I knew it would blow up. Keep up the great work :)
I'm surprised you didn't mention how the 757 market is now shifting towards freighters in order to account for the more modern aircraft that airlines are using. I'm not a betting man, but I would be willing to lay my chips down on the fact that more 757s are freighters than they are passenger aircraft these days.
So the 797 is essentially a redesigned, revamped 767?
Awesome vid thanks for clearing up a lot of misconceptions I had
nothing will be like the 757
I'd actually challenge what you said at 7:04. London to Edinburgh is much cheaper, fast and more convenient by plane.
I think we're more likely to start using synthetic fuels in aircrafts than to have commerical electric planes...
9:09 what airport is that? looks Brazilian
Thanks for this video. Interesting, Boeing 797 will open new horizont.
I was at Boeing during the 767, 757 project.  Boeing should get in to Vac  Trains like Dr. Goddard , Patent 2511979A .
Stupid american. Airbus is 1000 times better than boeing
Y do u keep sayin from the British isles and then Shannon pops up.shannon is in Ireland and we ar NOT a part of the British isles
The 757 <3 My all time favorite
lol hyperloop
Nerd!!
3:09 twin|aisle aircraft
How about the A350-900???🤔🤔
Boeing fan I smell
biased..
Why theres no 777?
H
25,000th like!
crucial attraction etc proposal resign press processing writing.
Is it the C172
BOEING BOEING BOEING .... dislike
FUUTTUUREE!!!!
Electric ones or hydrogen
2:90 the 777x
Bend over productions
A321LR.
Hyperloop
Wendower production= plane orgasm
Im suprised people still fly united.
there's a Chinese plane too: why wasn't it mentioned?
electric aircraft is like cold fusion. NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!
But airbus 350 is the most fuel efficient now...
lol dont worry, hyperloop is NOT a threat to any transportation.
THIS VIDEO WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU WERENT SUCH AN AMERICAN ASSHOLE SPEAKING OF BOEING ONLY. Best regards from the rest of the fucking world.
What about the CSeries (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CSeries) from Bombardier?
For some reason I get uncomfortable when I see how long the 757-300 is.
The 752 is an incredible craft. I cannot understand why Boeing didn't remake it with composite materials and the new engines available on the market to make a fast upgrade with (comparatively) low development costs.
All to well is the best ts song
I love how Andy keeps trying to stir the pot regarding T Swift and not one of these older celebrities gives a shit
THE SCARF IS CLEARLY IN HIS DRAWR, EVEN NOW
its i left my scarf there at your sister house and you still got it in your drawer even now
Maggie looks like she's an aristocrat from the 1930's.
all too well is not just A song is THE song
Olivia B is a legend for asking that question haha! Especially if that's a false name to honour Taylor's cat!
In a song?? All Too Well is #That song
left my scarf there, at your sister's house, and YOU still got it IN YOUR DRAWER even now.
All too well is such a masterpiece
Wait a minute... what happened to but you keep my old scarf from that very first week, cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me?  \nI thought she was talking about him not his sister.. i mean yes, she left it at his sister's house at one point but then he got it and kept it to himself
it might not have been about jake?
im sure Taylor has many more missing scarves
wow people actually ask Maggie about the scarf? lol, it's jake you need to ask!
NO he still has it! in his drawer, even now
Jake has the scarf. He keeps it in his drawer, even now.
Lol Maggie doesn't care
'All Too Well' is Taylor's Top 5 best songs. PERIOD. That is a fantastic song, I want her and Jake to get back together and break up so she can write a sequel.
All Too Well is the best song to ever exist *period*
Maybe someone can use that scarf and silence Taylor swift.
The amounts of fucks she gives is perfection.
All Too Well is her best song
Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks 🙏 https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553
Taylors saying I fucked jake at your sisters house
She been looking grandmothery for the last ten years...she just has one of those grandmother faces
inquiring minds want to know. god I'm going to retch.
Maggie G. looks like Sloth from The Goonies.
DAFUQ she has on, an aluminum foil dress?
I love Maggie's ring!
Maggie doesn’t have Taylor’s scarf. Taylor specifically says in the song that Jake kept her scarf because it reminds him of innocence and smells like her.
Maybe the song isn't even about Jake after all lol maybe it was another dream of hers that inspired it
All too well is the best song that Taylor has ever written. Yes, the equivalent to ATW in her other albums are 'back to December', 'clean' etc... but it's by far the most beautiful she has ever composed. It's her 'case of you' know whattamean.
*ALL TOO WELL IS THE SONG*
i cannot believe it's even trending. FIND THE SCARF ALREADY!!! Taylor needs peace. . . Well, more the Swifties. Lmao.
Taylor is a walking STD. More men than Elizabeth Taylor.
00:40 is that guy 50 cent???
I feel like she should have Kristen scalls voice
Obviously the scarf is Taylor Swift's innocence (virginity). She left it at his sister's house. Swift's Red is actually her best lyrically with metaphors. Her songwriting skills during Red was even compared to that of Leonard Cohen.\n\n\n\nOh, and the album's title is Red. RED!!!!
All to well is the best ts song...https://goo.gl/czCVJA
Rachel Dawes is Jakes brother?! Small world
If she does have the scarf, please God make her cover up that butter face.
Imagine what'll happen if Taylor releases that 8 minutes version...
Shes aging quickly
Give it back!
Why does she look 90?
Secret: Andy Cohen is really......Alex Trebec....
Its my grandma!
50 s laugh...contagious 😂😂😂😂
Find in Maggie
Taylor's too ugly for jake anyways... Cringy piece of shit.
well said Maggie who cares, swiftards should get over it, Taylor's  BS is exhausting
រឿងសិច
*Give it back!*
Her face reminds me of that old episode of the Twilight Zone, when the old man that was dying made his relatives wear masks to recieve their inheritance. js
Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina 😊 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg
She's ugly.
Damn how desperate for 'drama' is he to ask a irrelevent stupid question!!Never mind the person making a career out of bashing old partners/friends..
I think everyone agrees she's one of the ugliest actresses ever 💯😎
She might not have that scarf but she sure has the face of a hound dog ...😕😕😕😕
Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of Hollywoods ugliest celebrities.  Proof that you don't need talent or good looks to become famous, just Jewish connections.
WHY DON'T YOU AFRICAN FOLKS GET BACK TO AFRICA AND SPEAK YOUR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND LIVE WHERE YOU BELONG AND LEAVE US CAUCASIAN PEOPLE AND OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE ALONE AND GO FUCK YOURSELVES! GO MIND YOUR OWN AFRICAN BUSINESS IN AFRICA LIKE THE ASIANS MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS IN ASIA LEAVE CAUCASIAN WHITE PEOPLES ALONE. GO HOME.

Dear BBC could you reveal the air date asap thanks! Can't wait to watch it
benedryl cucumberpatch is BBC's ultimate clickbait.
I guess this will have to make up for the Sherlock withdrawals.
Yeees Benedict! Whatever he does, its just the best! <3 Cant wait to watch this. Its going to be beautiful and emotional just like his movie Third Star. It made me cry alot.
I'm gonna cry a lot.
Υesss, Benedict!
omg..! after The Current War and then The Child in Time trailer.. i'm ready for this.. can't wait! XD
I see Benedict Cumberbatch. I watch. He's just so irresistible (I'm not gay).
Sees Ben Cumberbatch, yep I'm totally watching this.
Heavy Rain by BBC One
The Child In Time airs on Sunday September 24 at 9pm on BBC One.
Can time heal?\nNo but Doctor strange can.
Press x to scream KATE!!!!
sooooohot...just sayin.
He needs to be used for another Sherlock series never mind this
Lost a daughter? Don't wonder around! Go to Bake street!!!
Sherlock has a child 😉👍🏻
This is the one case Sherlock can't solve
2 Best things in it.\n1) BENEDICT\n2) MUSIC
I love you,benny
Hey! If you from future please write, what you think about the film!
Looks good!!🙊 I love benedict❤
this is healing my Sherlock withdrawal! <3
This looks good
Don't worry this is Sherlock Holmes he will find her this finna be be a breeze.
Christ that looks depressing just what we all need. Why can't they do a drama about losing a fiver, or drinking an unexpectedly cold cup of tea, or perhaps a smoking tiger with anger issues and a love for left socks. Off to GPs for some anti depressants tomorrow, thanks.
The role looks perfect for Benedit Cumberbatch and I already can't wait for it! Its going to be something without a doubt!
Jesus 10 years after I had to read this shite in AS English they're making a show of it.  Worst crap I've ever read, and I've read Dan Brown.
I can`t wait. Ah, my love Benedict!
A couple of days ago a couple of dudes drove up to a High School near Rubery in Birmingham, trying to lure a child around 12 to get in their car because they knew her mom. \nI really wish a channel would commission To Catch A Predictor UK. It'd be so popular, plus it'd strike fear into the nonces, knowing they could be exposed to the nation on TV. Please, please, please, please
Shame he doesn't have the TIME STONE
Ben you made this year awesome!\nCan't wait
Book of the week, A bad storm by Theresa Down....................
No Benedict, you are SHERLOCK, you can Find her.
when does it come on ??
Looks so good
I swear they could have just used cctv?
Omg iv read the book ik what happens can't wait to watch this 😆😆😆😆
Penglings
IM NOT READY
I Wonder, do you think that Kate is a Time Lady? I'm just curious.
This looks like it's going to be great! Can't wait to see it!
Ben and the little girl playing - fills my heart up
I thought this was a Wholock episode because of the title
Where can I see it(I haven't got television)?
Is this gonna be a tv series or movie?
(tempted to draft new love letter right here and now) My Darling Benedict--It has been so long!...etc. etc.
Meh, doesn't look as good as The Missing
'The child in time' seems like a good title for a Dr Who episode. The return of the Drs Daughter?
HE WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD DAD IM SO OVERJOYED
Omg yuuuus back at BBC, love a good BBC series especially with benedict
This is going to be available in America right
As soon as I saw cumberbatch, CLICK
Oh mah gah I am HYPED FOR THIS! LOVE YOU BUMBLEBEE CUCUMBERPATCH!
I'M intrigued it sounds so good and i like Benedict's performance
I have been waiting for this since that summer 2017 trailer for BBC Drama. Love it so much.
IM HERE BEFORE THIS GOES VIRAL AND MAY I JUST SAY\n\n\n\nthERe gOEs mY hEArT

when comes it out
When will we be able to watch it then? x
Why can't anyone in the comments speak English?
Taken: Mild version
Anyone with just an ounce of empathy cannot but be gripped by the power of Cumberbatch in this trailer. My heart and stomach are tight from it.
Waaalt!
every film : ben running
Benedict? Okay Im watching this
Benefit cucumbrhatch
Just use your deduction skills, Sherlock!
Doctor Strange looks fucked
That little girl looks like side eyeing Chloe
Aman benedict sen 5. Sezon çekme de current war ve bunu çek :( üzdü neyse bizde bunlarla idare edecez.Bunu ingilizce yazamıyorum ya yetmedi ingilizcem inş Türk çıkar

Can't wait.....
OMFG SLAY YES BENEDICT HAS RETURNED
SHAUN SHAUN SHAUN
Benedict Cumberbatch\n\n\n\n\nWho?
is this Ian Macqueans novel
When?
YEES! Benedict and Kelly together?! Deffo gonna watch this
HASSİKTİR BENEDİCT AŞKIM ÇOK SEKSİYLİİ AHHHH
Looks good
Nice
What will happen to Sherlock? Thats it?
Oh look... The McCann's need more money... So another kidnap series... Notice the girl's name is KATE
awwwww.. Ben!! I must see this!! (but I'm in Germany :( )
Why not make another season of Sherlock if you had time for this :////
He lost his kid in the supermarket lol what a dumbass
Oh my god benedict as a dad
No effects but it looks like it has not done any editing
I feel like there is going to be a twist...that she has actually died and they are in denial
Shit
Looks stupid
It's alright for Juncker. He's an old man! He can create this shit for a considerable percentage of the world's population, take the money and enjoy it for his last remaining few years. Everybody else is screwed! Why would ANY country want ANY of that shit!?
6k views... how is this trending?
I love Brexiting, I am delighted to be getting away from this horrible shower of Cunts.\nThe pain and unhappyness that has been caused to Remoaners, has also been of great delight to me.
Saying it as it is !!
Brexit has been a disaster.
LOL he is right though, i wish we just did a hard brexit and pay no divorce fee at all, screw them we can trade with every were else.
Thankfully soon we will no longer have to listen to him.
Comparing the EU to Eastern Europe under the Soviets is actually disgusting. People were massacred in their droves, Matyas Rakosi, the first Communist Leader of Hungary is known as the Bald Butcher. People were starving while grain was being sent to the USSR. The cunt needs to get his head out his arse and not chat complete shit. Imagine if he'd said the same thing about Germany but comparing their current economic status with what they had under Fascism?
If you had given Cameron concessions, the brexit vote would never ever have happened Or if David Cameron weren't a self interested twat lmao
Juncker, the drunk junkie, wants all the toys. So he can break them, when he feels like it.
Well said Farage 👍
pure scum talking rubbish! which school he attended this cunt?
Any guesses when the next EU bailout will be?\n\nWill it be Greece or Italy?
A little history lesson for you the majority of the British government never wanted to be part of the EU in the first place it was the conservatives who wanted it and went out of their way to invest money into the EU project. the conservatives were voted out and labor stepped in wanting to back away but because we had already invested so much into the EU we were to prideful to just walk away partly due to the money and partly because of the absolutely disgusting (and very typical) attitude of the french towards us at the time an attitude which has never changed. We stayed with the eu despite this but made referendums to our membership one thing that was universally agreed on was the retention of the pound sterling as throwing everything into the euro wold have been stupid, this later turned out to be accurate. anyhooo timeline\n\nThe United Kingdom made its first application to join in 1961. It was quickly apparent that there was a danger of political isolation within Western Europe, Commonwealth states were rushing to do deals with the new bloc, and it had American support. This application was vetoed by the French Government in 1963 with a second application vetoed by the French again in 1967. It was only in 1969 that the green light was given to negotiations for British membership. The United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community (as it then was) on 1 January 1973 with Denmark and Ireland. This proved controversial at the time. The Labour party initially sought renegotiation of membership. This was toned down to requiring a referendum on whether the United Kingdom should remain part of the Community. This referendum was duly held in 1975 with a 67% vote in favour of continued membership.
We need other countries in Europe who want to leave the EU to stand up, and take action!\n\nBe proud of your unique history, and its culture.
What an hypocrite, he acts as he cares of East Europeans, after his Brexit polish & East Eu were first to be attacked by him Nigel farrage Brexiteers supporters, and now most polish and east Eu are preparing to leave as there no promise for them of staying except fake sweet promises
They are utter fanatical maniacs.\n\nI think a spirit of delusion has entered them.\n\nThey remind my of the verse\n\nThen entered Satan into Judas, and from that time he sought an occasion to betray Jesus.
UB burst looks like mr. DNA from Jurassic park
UB Assembly is Trump's favorite Pokémon lol
WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL FOR THOSE LUDICOLOS
Im going to name assembly trumps wall.
UB Assembly will build a wall to protect us from those Ash-Greninja spammers
Burst is my favorite ultra beast now
Does this mean Togedemauro and Mimikyu also get a Z Move
UB Assembly adds a whole new meaning to 'Wall'. Things gonna have over 200 Defense and maybe even Special Defense.
Nilhilego with hands and legs
AAAAAAAAAAAAA I'M SO HYPED! IDC IF YOU GUYS DISAGREE THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
I feel like my dude Assembly is gonna right Guzzlord's wrongs.
Here’s everyone’s Dawn Lycanro.......\n\n\n\n\nNever mind
Ultra Burst is cool
How early should i purchase the game to get that rockruff?
What's happening to Pokemon
Yessss we finally get the game on the same day as everyone else 😁
0:42 isnt that i choose you hat?
UB burst is a clown disco ball.
The new Ultra Beasts look amazing!!!

Holy moly, I would like to have UB Burst
0:29 looks like we might be able to catch mienfoo in Ultra SM
Hey we can SOS hunt Mienfoo in Pokémon USUM cool
1:46 *DAB*
The character just smiles while doing z moves Oh I just love destroying innocent pokemon
Who is looking at this comment?
Am I the only one who sees UB Assembly and thinks It's the.... UNKNOWN
I think I've seen these ultra beasts before I think I had desia vu
Is it just me, or does anyone get some Shadow of the Colossus vibes from UB Assembly?
Here before this goes viral!
Assembly will probably have OP defense
omg 😱 i cant wait to capture the ultra beast so psyched
Lego for the win 🔥
IT HAD A ZMOVE THIS WHOLE TIME
Ok..... well I did not think we would see more ultra beasts but ok.... loving the necrozma fusions though
UB assembly and Gumshoos are going to be gooood friends
ALL I WANT IS ALOLAN PARASECT PLEASE
Hey Ultra Moon future byuers, you will get yourselves a Guardian of Breathe of the Wild as a slave while us will have It
Just saw the trailer omg great thing are gonna happen in USUM

Alolan Muk bred with Niheligo to create UB Burst
Please extend the Rockruff event because I am getting the game for my birthday and it's in December.
WHERE'S MY ZMOVE
New Ultra Beasts like UB assembly *trump breathes heavily*
Christ!
I love the new ultra beast. Burst is weird, assembly isn't.
23rd m8 but 8n't no 1 care. Dont like this comment
Pokemon Sun 2 and Moon 2.
New Pokemon:\nA square\nNihilego's creepy brother
Honestly that clown ultra beast may be my new favourite Pokemon
I need more information about how to evolve rockruff into Dusk form
UB ASSEMBLY is a Minecraft Ultra Beast we are going to THE END confirmed in USUM\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a Joke btw
Assembly is rock-ghost
Yo, but is that UB Burst a disco ball?
This is weird, but I love how the text doesn't just appear on screen. Also does purchasing early mean preordering or getting it as soon as it comes out?
Everyone's on about the UBs, but Splintered Stormshards.
what is this are they running out of ideas
The move UB assembly uses at 1:41 is iron defence. Not any exclusive move or anything.
YAS QUEEN UB Burst is fabulous!\n\nCalling Bug/Psychic on it.
Do people still think this game is going to be bad?
I love how they think we know nothing about necrozma so they tell us what we know from a year ago
You need to give lucario a z move plszzzssszzzzzzz😭😭
I WAS the 2nd viewer
and first to thumbs up
Don't care about UBs or Necrozma. Give me an offensively built alolan Lapras, possibly with a brand new pre evolution for it, maybe even just do a Gardevoir and Gallade style evolution wherein a male Lapras is a new pokemon entirely.\nGive me a way to get Dusk Lycanroc using my own rockruff so I can breed it it with a good movepool, nature and stats, rather then some randomised one off Rockruff.\nAdd some 6vs6 random battles to the online- 3vs3 can be a 'quick battle' side option so that those who like 3vs3 over 6vs6 arent left out.\nNew Eeveelutions for my boy Eevee! Including a normal type evolution because base eevee- even with a z-move, just aint the same. We need a ghost, rock, ground, bug, flying, fighting, dragon, steel and poison types! Why you slacking Gamefreak?!? You started this thing, and even gave fairy a eeveelution- finish it.
Hope UB:assembly can learn fissure
hating these ultra beasts already...
40th
Omg !!!
7th
WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST INTRODUCE NECROZMA IN THIS GAME
13th
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
3rd
I came from verlisfy stream like if u did too
So... Are Pokemon gonna follow you or nah
Digimon Ripoff!!!!
Geez this channel can be very pessimistic
I think the problem doesn't exactly lay on the phones or advanced capitalism, but rather on our lack of struggle to achieve balance.
The more advance phones get, the more damage it inflicts on us internally.
Come home to the impossible taste of your own completion. Come home to Simple Rick's
LoL, really? I pity the society you live in. There's  plus side to living in a small town with a library and nice cafes in it, I guess. And educated, communicative humans that also really rarely use their phones.
I'm happy when my flip phone doesn't go off in a day
or we're just bored
but what about my memes
What about pictures, talking to loved ones, podcasts, music, apps like Cracked, etc.\nNo everyone is addicted.\nBut, yes they are primitive.\nNext step is VR.
I still don't have one and I will never want one!
Thanks \nI won't use my phone that much anymore
Problems with phones...\n   They're not substancial enough to drive nails or screws...\n   They don't come with attachments to remove pet hair or get a damn thing out of A/C vents...\n    Not aerodynamic AT ALL...\n    They make a terrible sound and start smoking when you piss in them...\n    They don't run on water... (or under it apparently)...\n    They seem to HATE ice cream...\n    Sure, they're a perfect window to all the knowledge, technology, and skills around the world... until you actually NEED it (like a real emergency)... and then you can't connect either! So... you're still on your own.\n    They don't handle well in the snow...\n    They don't deal with sand or heat very well...\n    Absolutely no personal common sense at all... (smart? pah... it's as dumb as a rock)\n    Lazy... These things... All they do is make noise and flashy lights. They lay about BEGGING for attention, and once you get started giving in to that... It just NEVER f***ing ends!\n    Delicate... Go ahead, keep it in your back pocket and forget it when you sit down... GO AHEAD!\n    They can't drive. Navigation aids are great and all, but you know what else is great? A F***ing MAP!\n     They taste like SH*T! Even if there was any nutritional value (there isn't) it isn't worth trying.\n      They're expensive as F***! Can you believe that price? Honestly, for that kind of price on a damn phone, it should have a hooker paid for a year IN FULL to play with my n**s whenever I'm using it!\n     Irresponsible...Just leave the phone (smart, my ass) in charge of your house for a week and SEE WHAT HAPPENS... hope you don't have pets if you try this...\n     \n    Now, you might argue that not everything in this list has something to do with the so-called Intended use or application of a phone... BUT it's supposed to be a smart phone, so it should surely be able to score something somewhere... It's supposed to be multi-purpose but that just doesn't seem to fit either... Think about that. :o)
I somehow one day just switched to a feature phone -  something I could use only for calls and SMSs. This video sounds like an afterthought, but nails the point nonetheless. Do we not realise already that we have come to a point that the cost of carrying smartphones has far exceeded the benefits? The choice - to give up our smartphones or not - is ours, but definitely worth attending to. Most importantly,  I guess a smartphone is a metaphor  for our all-pervading collection of gadgets and even the internet too.
Use the phone as a tool, don't be a tool used by the phone.
One thing I agree about the affect of phones is that they not only prevent us from self-reflecting, but also from being present. Whenever we see or experience something amazing, the first thing that comes to mind is taking a photo of it. For example, after witnessing beautiful scenery in a foreign land, most of us don't even stop to soak it all in. It's almost as if the main reason we went there in the first place was for showing off and taking selfies. We witness a personal favorite actor somewhere and the first thing that pops into mind is taking a photo; not thinking of possible questions to ask if we could. How often do we get to witness these things? Then why do we tend to spend them in such superficial ways? I think it's because we're so confident that we have all of the answers of the world in the palm of our hand (literally) that the only thing we can do is try to prove ourselves to others, missing out on life in the process.
good thing i only use my phone to steal my neighbours wifi to give it to my pc and think about philosophy and science all day
well that was depressing
only after looking this video，I realised that I had been kidnapped by my phone for a long time!
independance is what makes us self suifficent. dependance is like having no own opinion (self) and therefor letting other people decide what happens with you.\n\nWith phones, the people who make the phones.
will be great how to use a phone like we use land line
Every one of these videos is an existential crisis waiting to happen
Sorry, but I'm calling bullshit on this one.\nThe human race has had tens of thousands of years to improve morally, and it never happens. We are closer than ever to annihilating the planet and everything on it. We are bored, lonely, and ignorant: A cellphone removes all that anxiety and suffering. It cancels the many unbearable hours we must spend waiting -- in the doctor's office, in the dentist's office, for a cab, for a movie to start, etc. It's the best invention ever. It's your mind's friend, teacher, and counselor; for instance, on Amazon's website, you get reviews of products. Those reviews have save me from making terrible purchasing decisions, information I can hardly get anywhere else, and certainly not as quickly.\n\nDon't be a Luddite. Embrace and enjoy the latest technological breakthroughs, like CGI movie effects. I remember the old movies and TV; they were in black-and-white and laughably cheesy: Superman would jump through a window and then be seen held up by cables flying faster than a speeding bullet. It was unwatchable then and now. No, you can go back to horse and buggy days if you want, say, join the Amish; not me, my computer gives me countless hours of information, discussion, entertainment, and more. And you don't have to put with endless bores wasting your time telling you how the world is, or that I need Jesus to be happy, or that I need to buy that item now before it's sold out, which it never is.\n\nWe love our technology for a reason: It provides a better life, a more interesting life, a life where you are in charge, rather than being bossed around or led astray. Goodbye 20th century, and good riddance!
We deserve pity for having been born in such primitive times
Phones are not to blame for this condition. The problem is that people suck... and its difficult to relate or form healthy and kind relationship with them.
The problem with our Cell Phones is that they do so much that they suck at making phone calls
they have bad battery life and cost too much, then lenovo made the lenovo P2 and fixed that
watching it on my phone and seeing myself in it with every word.\nI think Alanis Morrisette wrote a song about this feeling.
I'm 29 and never had a smart phone . Any one else ?
Interesting stuff as usual. Had me thinking about these new thousand dollar phones. Remember when their primary goal was to communicate with each other? Its funny how we have moved away from that.
I have started leaving my phone indoors... makes a huge difference, takes some getting used to
some people love their phones so much...they put them up their ass...and have to go to the emergency
So the answer to phone addiction... Is better phones? Hmmm somehow I don't think we need to go deeper into this rabbit hole... It's like saying the answer to coffee that helps us to get things done and stay interested, is meth, which REALLY helps us get things done and stay interested. Phones and computers should be regulated by the government. Sounds crazy but it should be that way. They already have power over us with nuclear weapons and superior firepower. But we are the ones that elect them so in that sense we will always have power over them until. Or do we? Reduce phone usage and we reduce the brainwashing of the internet (through manipulated memes, biased feeds and tailored adverts) and we can elect better government. It's as simple as that. But the government doesn't want us to be out of their grip. Once they had television, now they have internet
why does  school of life hate on capitalism  so much?
louis c k said the same on smart phones
Hey guys, I'm the special snowflake ! I don't have a phone, I only read books, I am very sportly, young, I take care of my nutrition (I only eat vegetables though not being a vegan) ; people think I'm smart and humble !\n\n\n\n\nNah jk im a fat student buddy trying not to spend too much time on videogames and crappy memes
When you look back in your life and remember the happiest moments, do they all have something in common? I thought that probably for most of us,  those were the moments where we felt totally absorbed in something we loved to do, to a point where we forgot about time and about ourselves and everything around ..Like when you get lost in a book, in a piece of music you play or when you feel one with the nature. Or when you get into a deep conversation with a friend, watch a great movie or  a concert...  You get into a kind of flow. \n\nI don't have a smart phone, because I thought it would constantly bring me back to the surface.  And surface is absolutely the place where you suffer the most! Imagine all the situations I described above: A phone that makes strange noises at any unexpected moment would ruin it all. \n\nWell I don't mean to offend anyone, this is just a personal thing and I confess that I have a total  obsession with silence and my phone is turned off 99 percent of the time. \n\nBut here is a quote by Nietzsche that is worth keeping ALWAYS  in mind: \n\nThe greatest events  of our lives - they are not our loudest but our stillest hours”\n\n Imagine that you have your favourite cake in front of you. But if you get lost in some thoughts while eating it, you may suddenly realise that the cake is gone!  You just ate it without even noticing it! ( It happened to me more than once with all sorts of muffins! :- ) \n\n If we spend our counted days on earth with constant distraction, in the end,  we may feel this way about our lives  ... We won't know where it  has gone...\n\nAs T. S. Eliot said: \n\nWe get  distracted from distraction by distraction. \n\nThat's the greatest danger.\n\nI don't mean to sound too dark though. Of course you can have the latest smart phone, in case you REALLY need it, and if you know exactly what you want from it, you can use it properly.\n\nFor friends who want to think more on this issue here is a little list: \n\n1. There is a TED Talk by Adam Alter called: \n\n Why our screens make us less happy. \n\n He is a psychologist and professor at NYU and he says that he himself was \naddicted to his phone and to gaming. Imagine! :- ) That motivated him to write the following book: \n\n Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and The Business of \nKeeping Us Hooked. \n\n2. There is a very interesting  Note to Self podcast episode called: \n\n What is our attention actually worth \n\nIt can be helpful if you want to re-think your relationship with your phone. \n\n3. There is a TED Talk by the  ethical design thinker Tristan Harris called: \n\nHow better tech could protect us from distraction\n\n4.  I haven't read this one but Shery Turkle from MIT has a book on the issue called:\n\n Alone Together, Why we expect more from Techonology and Less From Each Other. \n\nYou can also watch her TED talk:\n\n Connected, but alone ?\n\nThanks for this wonderful lesson and for the amazing animation!
How are these made? What software? I love these animations so much.
I got the same problem, just with my computer instead.
No I strongly dislike my phone. I'm paranoid that I might lose it or that it will die because people expect that if they send me a message, that I have been made aware of it's contents.
I'm impressed. Good advice
I try to forget my phone at home once in a while. Very nice message.
because our phones, we can watch videos that tell us to stop using our phones...
Social media is a damn joke.
omg i could listen to him talking about anything and still be interesting
The irony of watching this on a smartphone xD
i am guilty, but at least i was smart enough to realize it rather that denying it.
They're also slowly giving us tumours
Like the idea behind the video, but some premise is worrisome: Yes, we can and must compare the brilliance of our phone with the past. Why? Because our phones are not just devices of despair as some citizen of some first world country would think. They're also the opportunity for most of humanity to catch up, to have access to almost every knowledge of the world, to educate and be better people. It's also gives you the possibility to communicate and not just posting selfies in snapchat, it also gives you the possibility to call your grandma or just to be in touch with people you may not see at any time, because you're poor and you live far.\n\nOf course, there are downsides, but we need to adress them as failure to solve in our long, and continuos (at least for some centuries) technological progress.
Wow! That video was pretty intense! The addiction to phones is definitely self-avoidence for most people... \nMakes me want to go back to 3310 again! :)
I use my phone to watch your vids,which help my self exploration,then contemplate what I learn.\n\nPs. Keep the good work up
Amazing clip. Reminds me of the movie Fight Club what you own ends up owning you.
The funny thing is, my phone has a bed time. By 10pm its away from me! I dont usually sleep till 11pm so for 1 hour I am just in bed being tortured by my own thoughts. The best thing is, I realize what and needs to be done.
Wow. So damn true. May god help us
it look like i am the only person who don't really care about his phone, \nbecause it has no chance to receive any call/message :'(
Ha ha ha I got an add for the Samsung galaxy S just before that
I gave up my phone for 8 hours....When I'm asleep..
If you were a loser without a phone you will be a loser with one.
The irony when i'm watching this on my phone
This may be true for some people but you can not fit this on everyone as you do in this video.
These arent even real phone problems. Ive got a cracked screen. Thats more of an issue than all of this rubbish. My mum cant hear when a text comes through. Thats another real phone problem. This stuff is all just made up waffle. Bet the person who made this video has never had a cracked screen.
Could you an episode on What is Bohemianizm pls...
yeah man it's so fucked up how much we rely on our phones \n\nSent from iPhone
I'm so aware of the hold my phone has on me. I consciously put it down sometimes because of this. Yet I'm not giving it up.
We'll evolve as phones evolve into virtual glasses which enhance vision and hearing of things we could not experience in the past.
I'm watching this video on my phone...
Watching this on my phone
Soo who else is watching on..oh\nHeyy good thing i m watching on my ta.. oh taken again..\nI should use my lapt..god damn it!
its sad.. but I'm totaly agree.. the phone now keep all secret.. everthing of us.. who control tecnology today.. can control our mind...
isn't this topic so contradictive, even while you're transferring this video/message, aren't you using the same channels? Aren't you a part of this chaos? Well, anyways...
Still want a new iphone x for myself
What kind of tinder is that?
Just brilliant. Thank you for this insight.
I never feel addicted, is that good?
This true. Watching stuff on my phone to calm down the anxiety caused by waking up for work, forcing myself for a major work that i need to complete, before making  stressful decisions etc. And afterwards, when i get home, i eat to feel the comfort again. Only a thought self therapy can help to reevaluate things and assure myself that these things that cause stress are just everyday tasks like getting dressed.
I don't own a smart phone. I do have a desktop PC through which I access the Internet, though. One of the old, big tower kind. It's distraction enough. :)
Ha I thought this video was gonna be about like if there was something wrong with phones physically not like this leave a like if you did too😂\n\nAlso sub please I'm trying to win a bet where you get the most subs without making videos I'm doing the bet with my brother but if you don't want to that's totally fine
This is why i don't use a smartphone ...
I think I heard a cheeky electronic version of Chopin's Marche Funèbre (Funeral March) at 3:29  ?
well said
You're right
worth assault transform Palestinian submit well.
Enjoy Life
/r/Im14AndThisIsDeep
So true!!
anti capitalist propaganda
O_O
Lol nah I just like memes
4:57 was a bit creepy...
Great content!
my behind stinks
stfu! you make me depressed! -_-
Applause*
Commie piece of shit propaganda.
Thumbs up for spam bot sponge!
Rereading Walden, and he totally agree,
Pacifist scum.
Self-discipline + phone = 💡
Exceso de información, información que no vas a usar, con algunas excepciones. Solo entra cuando necesites algo muy específico que ya hayas pensado por ti mismo y estaba fuera de tu alcance. La razón esta ahí (en tu cabeza) no en esa maquina todavía imperfecta. Se supone que es una herramienta que te debería ayudar y no esclavizar. \nAhora tendré horarios para encenderlo. Bye
The visuals made it unpleasant to watch.
We deserve pity for having been born in such primitive times...
What's really respectable is she only talked about rejecting her writing credit for one of her biggest hits (My Life Would Suck) because she was directly asked about it, she wasn't trying to brag or show off but just bring light to an issue that is very important and relevant in the music world.
9:10 Dr. Luke's part
Kelly Clarkson didn't want her name near Dr. Luke. So she lost out on thousands maybe even millions for her writing credit. That speaks volumes!👌🏼
Amazing woman! Her ideals are really strong.
I love you Kelly.
Kellegendary Clarkslay. Classy woman. So sincere. I love that she answered the Dr. Luke question, most people would've dodged it.
I love how she was asking if the host's dad is ok after the cancer. Shows she really cares about people even interviewers and not just focusing on talking about herself! :)
Mad respect for her.
kelly is a motherfucking womam!!!
Whoah! I'm too early!\nFirst comment? LOL\n\nKelly though...this was a fun interview and I love Kelly so much!
Yasss miss kelly we stan
I admire the fact that she said singers change an existing  song slightly and then will request a writing credit on a song which implies to the listener that they may have had a bigger part in writing the song than they actually did. I've listened to so many songs with artists having their  name in the writing credits and  years later I hear the recorded demo of the song with the true writer.
I have always liked her
i can see she is secret bff with Adele
Kelly is incredibly talented, classy, modest, gorgeous woman, and this is where I could continue, but.... Thank you for being honest about Idol and Dr Luke
i really enjoy this radio host- this is the first time i've heard of him (im australian) and honestly i've never seen someone so interested and whole-heartedly enthusiastic about his job or his opinions or anything like that. props to you dude
She is such an amazing person. My favorite singer EVER!
Kelly is all american dream!
RIP Eric the Actor
Love her!
Why didn't she take the writing credit and just donate the proceeds to charity? Instead the money just went to Dr. Luke and/or her label...
Fat
HA! This was great. I wish we had Panda Express! 😭 Too bad spending $2 on half an avocado seems reasonable when you've been living in Korea and Japan for a long time!
ahahahahhah! I love you're funny short movies! :D
Hamburgers are called hamburgers because they are from Hamburg Germany... which came originally from Mongolia.
Wait, that voice... It's Emma! I love you, Joanna Sotomura 😍
Videos like this make me SO glad to be single.\n\n#MGTOW
Lol I'd love to process places to eat using this method with a friend lmao
WHAT IS PHIL SAYING AT 0:15 YA'LL \n\njk edit: after like probably 6 repeats, good work today steve I struggled tho 😂😭😅
Hahaha I was so happy to see Chris but he was so mistreated in this video poor Chris! Love Phil making it so complicated as well.
Pro life tip - whenever you get asked this dumb question, you go to the worst place imaginable. Just pick something she hates and go there and order something she hates to eat\n\nEventually she won't ask this dumb question
We all know Ryan directed this
what was this below-average comedy
It's called decision fatigue! Happens always after work at dinner time.
Have I just seen a kind of Sherlock? 😂
It's basic economics 😭😭😭😭😭😭 meeeeeeeeeeee.  And hahaha you know how bad my memory is
When in doubt, choose pizza.
Because this phenomena of getting to choose what to eat is recent. In the past, people ate what they had and acquired what they could, not what they wanted.
This guy could have caught Kira.\nBoth of them.
Is it just me or is this shit boring
4:06 -  You know how bad my memory is \n\nYeaaaah.. Sure haha..
this is effective advertisement right here. My boyfriend and I went to Panda Express immediately after watching this XD
I am just going to get McDonald's
I love original content :D
Lol so true!!!
The next Ryan Higa hahaahaha
The next Ryan Higa!
The next Ryan Higa
The next ryan higa
The next Ryan Higa
Thanks a lot, Sherlock
omg that was so clever
Ugh. I just ate. I can't think about eating more food but I HAVE been craving Panda lately.... Hmm. Maybe just a teensy weensy bit tomorrow.
I feel so bad for Steve er.. Chris lol
I was laughing even before I started watching this video.
L and N have some competition. Light Yagami, watch out.
This video was really dumb. I didn't stop watching it to see if there was a pun at the end but then it just ended. YouTubes been recommending the wrong videos
surprise!!! This is a food kitchen, where all the homeless go, shut up eat your soup!!!
ummm.. could you guys please not compare Wong Fu's video to Ryan's video. It did look similar just because of his way of speaking and explaining while standing, but they put their own hard work into it. They had their own idea. Let's just not put them in an awkward position to reconsider their own ideas by comparing them countless times with Ryan.
This video just proved us that women are so complicated that transformed us men to complicated thing ...
Cool  a lot of fun.  Like. 👍
You know I have a bad memory
seems like you are spending too much time with Ryan
*he went full Asian* 😂
What the heck's wrong with this guy...trying to be so sweet but not...ah oh!! He just let her girl starve to death guessing..harhar.!Don't ever do that to me dearie! Isn't that clear enough with YOU?
Wong Fu never fails to make me smile and after watching all their videos I be like OMG thats so relatable. Been a fan since long and there hasn't been anything since then which failed to amaze me when it comes to Wong Fu.
So Cathy got married now it's Joannaaaaa
Its so long long time since i see your vid. YOu change alot. LOL Great Job!
I love you Chris!!!! I'll eat with you any day!
The part where Phil says What's BLACK, WHITE, and SOFT? And then it pans to Panda....haha that really got me laughing!
I work at panda express xD
The tyranny of choice. Some people want to maximise every experience unknowingly adding more dissatisfaction to the process. Just name 3 choices and pick the best one and be satisfied with it.
Yeah but im handsome and........ NOT NOW STEVE
now i want panda... but i wont go bc i know they're using their marketing techniques on me!!
I'm honestly not that picky. I should be the one worrying what my boyfriend wants to eat.
For me its super easy i just cook myself and feed myself and others too dont like takeouts ugh
HOW ARE SO SMART
I love seeing Chris! Great video Wong Fu Productions! Phil is so handsome. 😌
Man I haven't seen these guys in a while! It's dope to see them in my recommended videos
*lists off an incredible string of facts and details*\n>You know how bad my memory is \nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Let's just go and see where it takes us, LOL.
I thought this was a nigahiga video with all those logic.
kind of reminds me of Ryan Higa's style of fast-paced and out of this world segues! haha love it so much! <3
this reminds me of Scott the pilgrim Vs the world
Lowkey copying Ryan higa eh?😏😏 i see what you did there
ISNT THAT ANNA FROM EVERYTHING BEFORE US
Chris Dinh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is such a gentleman. He is a less awkward Ted. More Skits with Chris !!!!!!! please :)
LOL NATALIE TRAN WAS IN THIS
Youve been watching Sherlock havent't you....
NOOO; NOT THE PANDAAAAAA!!!!!!!
Eat ass next
This purely genius.
The next Ryan Higa 😂😂😂😘😘
Haha! I seriously love you guys :)
worstt wong fu. screw you
**not now steve!**
LMAO
Dog like all asians do
Getting those Ryan higa vibes
Omg this is GOLDEN😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ass
Did Phill just say, Jif?
Hahaha great ending!!!
copying ryan higa
SHERLOCK

I can't stop looking at this look!! AMAZING
I got my highlighter pallet yesterday and it's great!\nbut they weren't even on the shelves yet and I had to ask of i could get it from the little stack storage thing that workers put up. she was like it's not in the 3 for 2 deal yet and I was like i don't care I just want it now I was supposed to get them both but she didn't understand that I disnt want the deal and I wanted to pay more money so I could get it there and then. I ended up only getting the highlighter because she was in a bad mood.\nnot calling soph here obviously and I doenst matter i can get it tomorrow but oh my gosh that worker. 😢😢\nBtw I was allowed to get it she just wanted me to have the deal when I didn't want it.

I really want the palette but it's sold out. 😢
Her make up ❤️
Bunny what eyelashes are you wearing?
dude teen spirit is till my go to deodorant since 1994 pink crush is way prettier than powder fresh imho tastes better too :P
I definitely used Teen Spirit! I still have my mood rings, a bunch of those hair clips, Scrunchy's, chockers and my Caboodle that is greenish/blue with the swing outs on top! My favorite other things were Wet N' Wild makeup, those tiny nail polishes, that pink Maybelline mascara and my quad tower of shimmery blue eyeshadow! 💙💙💙
Honey you can still get caboodles at target and ulta. I dare say that's a newer caboodle tbh.. love ya!
I still have my pink caboodle I got when I was like 7 (I'm 22 now!)
Ur hair in this video 😍😍
Bunny, you should know, I also ate a heap of lip smackers but when I was like five, for no reason, just because.
They need to bring the kaboodle's back permanently. I was born in 1981 and I had an awesome caboodle with stickers and Tattoos all over it.
I was born just outside the 90s but I still watch Rugrats and all those shows😂
I loved Teen Spirit deodorant and the shampoo and conditioner!!! 💕
which lipstick is she wearing?
i use to love teen spirit in strawberry
I had these glitter gels I put on my cheeks and eyes and arms :P I also had a glitter on a brush it would dispense out of the handle haha
My daughter has all those hair pins.
Bunny\nHow did you do your hair?
August 13th is my birthday lol
The personalized nameplate offer STILL STANDS! I bought a Caboodle a few months ago, and got my very own nameplate. :D
I was born in 2001 and I remember some of this stuff
YES MOOREE
i miss american girl doll perfume lmao
Mood lipstick were my 90's staple.
You are beautifully realistic 😙
Thanks for the blast from the past! 👍 one thing I just thought about (when I was 10 or so, in 1992) any body remember Malibu Musk? It was in a lil teal spray can with yellowish flowers on it... Kinda like the designer imposters (remember that? If u love Georgio, you'll love Primo lol) anyway that malibu musk was awesome and I wore it all the time. I wish I could find it again :) btw I still have my purple caboodle from '92, I'll never throw it away!
i got that 2 years ago
can I please have a choker necklace
I have that pink conbutle
So beautiful in this video!!
Haha..i have a caboodle i use for a first aid kit and still to this day using 90s hair ties..u would have a blast😁
Bunny is drop dead gorgeous it's ridiculous!
I have that pink bin
Caboodle still makes boxes and i literally saw the box you have yesterday at Walmart!
I have the exact same make up box
All of that is super fancy i like it😗
I bought my daughter a caboodle last yr at Walmart. They still make them. We actually have the exact same one.
Highlight game is STRONG \n💪🏻🐊🐊🐊💕
You look like my best friend in the 90s
I used to eat lip smackers ...🤷🏼‍♀️
I got one of those for Christmas last year😂 it had some nail polish and some other stuff
I STILL USE TEEN SPIRIT!
I was in my teens and early 20's in the 90's. :)
Your hair and makeup! 😍😍😍
I'm a 2000 Baby and I LOVE LOVE LOVE Teen Spirit Deodorant
If you kept nudes in a Caboodle would they be called Caboodz?
I STILL HAVE A TEEN SPIRIT DEODORANT AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS FROM THE NINETIES AND I'M FIFTEEN AND I KNOW ENOUGH PEOPLE FROM THE NINETIES AND I HAD PLENTY OF STUFF FROM THE NINETIES SO YES THEY STILL MAKE THEM XD
You can still get Caboodles on Amazon!
I have this box right now.... Omfg
Can you bring back DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK
That caboodle is from 2013
I have that box! I got it yearssss ago, I still have it!
I have that same caboodle rn lol
My Daughter HollyAnna Loves You!  I think Your The BeezeKneeze!
I was alive in the 90's, but I was more of a 90's toddler. However, my older sister was a 90's kid and I remember her having so much of this stuff, and I remember having them myself because I looked up to my sister. My sister still has her caboodle too!
Awww mann.... I was born in 2003... So I have the aftermath of 90's (I wish was in the 90's, it looks so fun.It has more stuff. )
drinking game: everytime she says authentic 90's goodness take a shot
There is a game called logo
they still make this caboodle you can buy it in walmart i bought one a year or two ago for my niece
That was so awesome. I knew what deodorant that was going to be, I knew there would be a scrunchie, I knew there had to be a buttery clip, I knew what chapstick it was going to be.... XD That was super fun, Bunny! ❤‍
I have like 15 of those deodorants
Wow, this video made me so happy and nostalgic ☺️
Saw New Kids On the Block and I had IT flashbacks. I'm so afraid
I was born in 2002 so I didn't experience as much as other people who were born in the 90's but I had a small piece of it and those were the best years of my life. Now it just kids sucks cause teens are dressing like young adults and acting like them too.
damn.. I was 6 in 1990!! I had a caboodle too! mine was kinda turquoise-ish... loved that big huge thing!! all of the items in the caboodle take me back!!! 90's rule!!!!!
I have that box... I had forgotten how old they were, and I wasn't even born in the 90's XD I use it to put my make up in.
I'm a '92 kid!! Also BUNNY I LOOOOVE YOUR MAKEUP!! Will you please do a tutorial for it???
That box is from Walmart
My mom has the same make up box she bought it from Wal-Mart for like 15 dollars😂😂
I wish I could rock that hairstyle.
I have the same caboodle
I was actually born in 1990
i have that same caboodle
I used to have a caboodle!but it was the early 2000's...
No body glitter 😱😱😱😱
I was born in 2004 but honestly I feel like i should have been a 90s kid
Your makeup looks so stunning I absolutely love this look on you. Purple is def your eyeshadow color Bunny!
6:10 when you see a cute guy
I have a 90's green glitter Caboodle! :D
I was born in 97. So its mostly just the late 90's things that carried over into 2000 that I remember. But I feel like Ive mostly just seen the 90's through movies
i was obsessed with lip glosses, there was one that came in a little round tin (it was more like a balm actually) idk what the brand was called but they had flavors like vanilla and watermelon and that stuff was my JAM!
You should TOTALLY curl your hair in plaits like you said you used to! That would be so cool xx
I've just gotta say, your look in this video is absolutely gorgeous. like the purple smoked out look makes your blue eyes pop and OMG it's just so pretty 😍
I LITERALLY JUST BOUGHT THAT SAME DEODORANT LMAO
💘Love you💘
Love you!☺️
Who does not love Michael Jackson? *slowly raises hand* xD
I saw a caboodle like that at Walmart
Teen spirit gave me the worst rash ever 😂
iam Ashley cayton and you are so cool funny I like you bff and that was girl in my school that did like eat her pink lip gloss
gonna need me a hair tutorial asap
I was born 2000 but I still vaguely remember most of these when I was like 5 in my aunts room because she kept everything
You wanted to go back to the year I was born :)
6:38 I can smell it I have the exact same deodorant
Does anyone remember those Spice Girls lollipops ?? They were sold at like Limited Too sometimes as well. OMG remember Limited Too?! I thought  I was so freaking cool when I got my first Limited Too bathing suit; it was like a navy blue tankini that said Princess in sparkly rhinestones with a little crown.  Oh how I miss the 90's... I was the best swimmer of '87 FYI.
Tutorial on face and hair please 😍😍❤️
I have a pink caboodle box and had it since I was a child and when Hannah Montana came on 😂I remember she had a pink one and I got so happy.
The pictures from this video really bring out your Lucille ball esscense. You're beautiful. 😙
*bought same caboodle at Wal-Mart last month*
I was born in the 80's but grew up in the 90's and the 90's were the BEST! Your totally bringing me back with everything! I used to use the Teen Spirit Deodorant lol thought I was so cool lol also do you remember the perfume Malibu Musk and Old Navy lol! Can you please tell me what lashes your wearing or mascara PLEASE!
walmart still has hard candy make up , i am dying to get some but at $5 a piece ..nope
I have a Dr Pepper lip smacker and Dr Pepper is my favorite.😂 I had a friend who also ate chapstick😂😂

Fenty beauty really hit the mark with being inclusive with this line. I love seeing super pale and super deep girls getting excited about a line that's catered to them. The gloss I think is my fav, I love universal colours that look amazing on everyone!
You look orange you need a way lighter color!
the foundation matched the rest of your body, and the fenty blender application was so flawless...
THANK YOU for saying your foundation shades in SO many foundations!!!! Biggest pet peeve is when youtubers don't mention the shade they buy in a foundation
Wow your face looks so healthy!!!
So in love!!!
Need this whole collection 😍
290 would be your shade ! (:
Amy you look so gorgeous. What lashes are those please they look amazing
Your so pretty 😍
 3 am in the morning  👌🏼
Girlllll the gloss and highlight!! 😍😍
What lashes are you wearing? They are amazing!
Omg what lashes is she wearing??? 😍
Someone please tell me what brush she was using! 😹😹
perfect foundation shade yasss
Love your channel ❤️❤️
Fenty Beauty looked gorgeous on you!
The gloss....so good
Girl you're trending
Your skin is flawless 😍
Hey babe, You're Trending!!
It looks good 😊
17:15
You are sooo stunning Amy 😍
LOVE!!!!! Amyyy you are gorgeous!!!\n\nAny small youtubers wanna support each other? 💖💖💖💖💖 I will LIKE & SUBSCRIBE TOO.
I thought the foundation shade was perfect for your complexion. Also from other reviews most warm the concealer with their fingers and not rubbing directly on their skin. It looks good on you
her eyes... wow
You look great.  I am going to get some today
Hey what lashes are you wearing? Could you do a makeup look on your eyeshadow please
I feel like this was a pretty good review. Like I didnt get that kiss-ass- vibe. Seemed genuine. Thank you.
how does your self tanner look so good????? could you do a video girl
I thought the foundation shade u wore in the video was an exact match for you after it dried down. Maybe in person it looked off but on video that shit was ✔️✔️✔️✔️✅✅✅✅
its very drying ... you look beautiful
Please do a tutorial on how u color your hair.
when you use your EOS program... do you notice how in your computer when looking at yourself everything looks mirrored? (Example: Touch your right eye in person it looks like you are touching your left eye on the computer) do you know how to fix that ??
You motivated me to start my own makeup channel ILY ! Keep it up love 😍🎥💕
I can't barely remember my phone number and you remembered like 7 different brands foundation shades of yours 😂😂
I sware your like the other me . Love this video so much Amy 💗
3 AM in the morning is a little redundant. lol
I guess were watchin diff reviews cause ive heard the foundation blows lol theres gonna be an army of cake facers walkin around lol
What shade should i get if i'm around NC20? :)
When you're outside do you have a filter on your camera?
I love the trending tab all makeup and celebs \n\n\n\nnot gaming or comedy
I just ordered this foundation for myself from all the reviews of fenty beauty foundations this foundation looks like it was made just for me, the most perfect one. I'm so excited to receive it.
Can you do a video of your favorite brushes for foundation, eyes etc? I'm trying to find a great foundation brush that doesn't leave texture/print on the skin after blending. Thanks!
We are the same shades! Get 240 :)
I just realized we use the same shade in Estee Lauder Double Wear! I knew it was Shell Beige but not the number of it. This is going to help me so much with your foundation reviews. I believe you're the only youtuber that matches me! Thanks girl!❤️❤️
hello anybody want to fry some eggs I am so dead Amy!!!
You should definitely buy the brushes their amazing!
Like hello anyone wanna get some eggs 😂
What's the brush you used to highlight?
i love love ur review thank u for sharing with us ❤
I also got shade 300 but i wanted a shade darker than myself (tanner), not too much that it looks weird though, anyways I feel like it looks a little orange on me so maybe I should go to 290 instead! On you it looks orange too I wouldn't say its darker so maybe we both should get shade 290! But I should say it is also the lighting where you filmed because when you were outside it looked just fine! \nps. I'm so happy I finally found someone who is the same shade as me haha :)
Tbh I think this foundation is AMAZING !!! I personally love it cuz I have supper oily skin and it held up for me all day.. I loveee how it looks on you. looks sooooo flawless <3 nice review overall tho ! would love to see a follow up with your shade
The gloss looks too sticky... i've noticed that on so many other people's videos as well like you can see the stringy-ness when opening and pressing your lips together to speak. That's the only thing from this collection i wouldn't purchase just because of that
Thank you! I can always count on u for foundation color since we're litterally the same foundation color in almost every product. And when I heard 300 I said yep that's what I was gnna get
What's on your nails???? Love it
I think Trophy Wife highlighter would've looked really nice on you.
OMH, literally every check in your skin looked AIRBRUSHED! SO amazing! I need this foundation in my life.
Is anybody an NC20 in Mac that can give me there shade in the fenty beauty foundation??
Idk if it's just me but it looks like the side you used Rihanna's sponge on, the foundation appeared a little lighter while the other side looked a little darker. But when you used the beauty blender on both sides, it looked good lol. The foundation looks great on you though.
Your video is on the TRENDING PAGE!!!! 🤙💋
This looks like a great video, but after you are done would you be kind enough to check out my new YouTube channel and give me some feedback? Maybe even subscribing? ;) https://youtu.be/BhQob6WW-TQ
Stunning like always ! Thank you for this really informative review !
You're one of my favorite YouTubers 😍❤️
The filter you used at the end was crazy
I just want to take this moment to tell you that you are so beautiful and articulate. I love how in depth you get on products. You're such a great YouTube. I love how down to earth and humble you are. Also your bare skin looks really good.
Not usually a commenter however I noticed on the last first impressions for foundation you did, people's in the comments kept saying how they wished you applied a lighter layer first and did a wear test. \nThough I don't agree, cause I'm all about that cake too girl! I think that you doing both of those things in the video just once again proves why you're videos are the best. Really listening to your viewers and giving us what we ask for. Reinforces that you're the most trust worthy guru <3
Thanks so much for sharing your shades in different brands. Really helps a lot!!!
It looked so smooth on your skin 😍😍😍😍
Am I crazy or did this fenty sponge eat half of your foundation? 😄
Now I have to buy the lipgloss🤣😍
I feel like you applied the contour/bronzer a lot better than most reviews I watched. Loved the idea of rubbing it on the brush first :) Since it does tug a bit on the face because of the waxy texture.
I like your vlog style check ins ❤️
Everything looks so stunning on you, you're making me want to put on a full face of Fenty Beauty again!
what shade would you reccomand if your golden sand in the loral true match?
So is the foundation worth it? I always wear estee lauder double wear but looking for something new to try.. what's the next best thing???? Hahaha
I just got the gloss in yesterday, it's absolutely the most perfect color, super glossy and not goopy. You can wear it alone or top it off on any of your fav lippies.
Even tho the shade dried darker your skin look FLAWLESS, girl!!! You just made Sephora take all my money 😩😩 love love love
THAT CREAM BRONZER LOOKS SOOO GOOD ON YOU! I kinda wanna try it now! I've never done cream bronzer.. hmmm
love your videos amy, as always ♥️♥️
She does not even need makeup
Will you just get on with it
I WAS HOPING YOU WERE GONNA TRY TROPHY WIFE 😭... PLEASE TRY IT
The fenty sponge worked better...I noticed a difference in the application
Absolutely gorgeous🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
WHAT LASHES IS SHE WEARING
what brush did you use to highlight ???
Maybe its drying dark because u added a second layer
Why have not ever subscribed to you, its a crime that i'm this late, you did a fantastic job.  I loved all the information you gave, I loved how you showed how to fix the problem.  You are very good at what you do.  Plus you are stunning with or without makeup.
Omg when you went to finish your make up your make up looks so good with the lashes. Looking bomb!
Yes please do a shade update!! I wear Too Faced Born this Way in Sand 😊 300 looked a lil too dark 😕
Did you end up finding the right foundation colour?
How many times can one person say the word Smooth!!!!!!
i'm a nc24 in mac what shade should i get ?
No hate, just seems that this makeup makes you look splotchy and dirty?  Anyone?
It looks so pretty on you.
I love u Amy but make ur videos shorter they r way too long babe 😘🙏🏼
Super late but i love the quality of this video!
Liberals Showing their true colors in the comment section. \n\nHateful, petty, self important, piles of garbage.
Sarah looks like Suh a bitch, like she's been holding a fart and she's just bitter and angry about it
Sarah is typical of all the press secretaries in the past. She often doesn't answer the question people ask and she blindly supports her boss even when she knows it's wrong. \n                She's the newest swamp.
How does anyone think Trump is competent?
Racist don't like to be called racist.
Trump is a idiot savant when it comes to picking people with no character or ethics to lie for him.
Seeing the media cover a news story about yet another black person calling someone white a white supremacist is like seeing the sun rise in the morning. \n\nThere *WAS* violence on both sides, though. I'm not a Trump supporter, I just live in reality. You're already on YT, so look up antifa comp and/or antifa charlottesville for A LOT of proof.
Let's all defend our racist-in-chief
ooh a little heavy with the contour
Your face is a fireable offense
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Triggered snowflakes everywhere. Why don't y'all pray for Hill to stop?
Goddamn. The Trumpanzee's are foaming at the mouth triggered over this one!\nLMFAO
Racist Jemele said it because MSNBC, CNN, talk shows, and the rest of the liberal hate-God media says it. They are complicit in the hate.
Yeah ,\nHow many times can the idiot liberal reporter, plug in the word-\nInfluential.\nInfluence who?!\nCertainly not me,\nNor the majority of Americans with half a brain!\nPerhaps just him, with much much less than that!
Both sides keep talking about an African American community as though all black people are mindless zombies who know only how to think one way.  You never hear them talk about a Caucasian American community, do you?
i thought you fucks liked to rant about 'muh free speech' and how words are just words (pewdiepie)....now you bitching and want her fired? Who's the SJWs again???
I WANNA SHOOT HER CLUB UP (IN MY CHARLEMAGNE VOICE) \nIf one person listens to my music that would mean the world to me. \nYoung M.A Official Audio On My Page.
Never actually confirmed or denied anything,,,, I wonder why .....
That's a woman lol she looka like aman
looking at them ghost skin disease people mad lol
My comment would be,  you can't fix stupidity, especially when poor people are offered a million to be stupid
Here are the best Youtube dramas to watch.

I thought this administration was a big defender of freedom of speech?  I thought it was only liberals hurt by offensive remarks?  I thought conservatives hate PC culture?\n\nApparently the right is just a bunch of babies who are happy to point out when the left overreacts, but also hate when people point out that they overreact.\n\nI'm sick of all the hypocrisy
Jemele Hill is an influential African American figure\n\nYEAH A GRANDIOSE WAY OF SAYING SHE IS A REPORTER,\n\nshe could be a janitor and you could still use those words influential African American figure yes a great janitor figure one of the best!
When the right acts like the left we all lose.
This is America world, please read the comments, hypocrisy at its best. The land of the free and the home of the brave🤔. Freedom of speech🤔.
These people see racism everywhere. Nobody but the progdroids listen to them anymore. Very sad.
OMG! Imgine if Jamele had falsely claimed Trump was not born in the U.S!!!
a question that hasn't come out yet.  When did racism or being racist ever become solely and diversely linked to only African American ridicule?  Isn't racism everywhere or better yet, isn't racism conveyed both ways?  Maybe the white majority is too obvious but there a just as many other cultures that frequently hate on another group fueled by international and/or domestic history.  ...
Put your hand upon my hip...when I (Sergio) Dipp you Dipp we Dipp
She is ignorant and was NOT raised properly!  - THAT much is obvious!! She has even spoken about her AWFUL relationship with her mother and Lord knows where her daddy was.
The world is in turmoil and people are losing their lives left and right but I'm a little shithead who only cares about my ratings so I'm asking stupid questions.
I don't like Jemele Hill. I find her frankly annoying. But asking someone to get fired because of a statement is just stupid.
media instigating a race war again
The Huckabee gene is STRONG! Mongoloid-like and STRONG.
You want to hear more outrageous crap? Look up Sarah's father.
If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.
She got the peoples eyebrow down to the T. The rock would be proud.
In my Katt Williams voice what the fuck is a Huckabee?!😣
The huckabee family protects child molesters and dog killers. Look it up.
Well so what's the problem? Trump is really a racist, and have a lot of racist friends and supporter's. If you support him you may be a racist or a racist sympathizer.
She's a cunt
Oh look, Trump supporters asking why a video is trending in the comment section again ._. 110k views so far, still not sure why it’s trending
Since when did just being white make you a white supremacists?
Mn must use mens bathroom. Saying that is a firable offense at ESPN but falsely calling the the President some racist shit is not. You people on the left are textbook definitions of hypocrite, racists,  and pathetic
Pretty simple, I will not watch or support ESPN until they fire the race baiting Jemele Hill.
Sarah has the patience of saint. Admirable.
Sarah Huckabee is an amazing woman. She is so strong and has such character
Sarah Sanders is one classy woman. If I were in her shoes, I'd tear these propagandist a new one, ever single day. I'd come to the podium with stats against their reporting, their networks, their failing railings, their full politi-fact write up, and a record of their continual obsession with false narratives.\n\nEvery sensible person out there who opposed the former president probably wishes they were more vocal about their distain, when they chose to remain respectfully silent (many for the fear of being labeled a racist).\n\nHowever, this past election sounded off to the effect of a nuclear bomb, and somehow, these morons stand around in embarrassment, pretending like they never heard it. That's ok, keep it up! Please, do continue to double down on this failing propaganda tactic...I mean, wonderfully true and reasonable line of logic; I'm sure everyone around the globe agrees. (Snicker)
Wow there's so many people in the comments saying she's so ugly and black  isn't there a word for judge a person solely for their appearance or skin color ... O yeah Progressive
This broad needs to get laid
When will she stop with all the lying?
Why is she so Fat. She looks like that muppets pig
It's only going to get worse. Blacks want everything given to them and get upset when they aren't treated like kangz. Whites need to have each others back and get over any differences they may have. Whites need to stop worrying about being called a racist as it's a hollow attack. Whites need to forget about white guilt - whites built this nation and have given more to minorities than any other race. These people don't want peace, they want everything and they want whites to suffer. Organize. Share the truth and fight back! Be proud of who you are. Get active creating the change you want to see.
She acts as if she doesn't even wanna be there like leave bitch if you don't wanna do your job. Such a cunt.
Lets not forget espn fired rob parker for calling robert griffin a cornball seems to me espb are double standard company
Jemele Hill has been part of what... 3-4 canceled shows?
White peoples response to blacks 10 demands ... FUCK YOU LAZY leech ... X 10
Lol...she has the same look on her face that Spicer had, just before HE GOT LET GO. HA HA
STOP these outrageous and utterly false liberal statements. The left's abject hatred is dividing the country and causing irreparable harm.
TRUMP 2017 MURICAAAA
FUCK Jemele HILL stupid bitch
Eww I hate her unrested left brow
Dumb dun hill.
Didn't Trump call Obama racist?
E
fu*k you snowflakes!
Exactly, why focus on race baters
Whaittt powaaaa!!!
Black Privilege
she just told that dumbass
subcribe to my channel
Sarah Huckabee should be fired.
This admin sucks ass
What a dumb bitch
Trump is a white supremecist
ESPN is racist
dump her like spicer. shes a fucking cunt
SNOWFLAKE. LOL! Triggered ugly bitch.
Liberals Snowflakes ❄️ are TRIGGERED.
Fuck this dumb Bitch and trump
Jemele hill is trash
This bitch eyes bothers me. Is one offset from the other? Is it a lazy eye? Too much makeup?
I don't watch ESPN anymore because since when is a sports network political TALK ABOUT SPORTS THATS WHAT YOUR THERE FOR like how stupid is ESPN they recently fired a guy for having the last name lee and it was apparently bad bc there was a confederate Robert E lee who was white and the lee on ESPN who was fired was Asian like he should sue ESPN for discrimination over a fucking last name he had no power in picking this is why America is so apart it's bc the liberals purposely do it and then blame us educated people and trump which btw isn't a racist all people who think he is need to get their heads out of there ass bc everything that the liberals use saying he is a racist is so out of context and misleading
Tf is up with her masculine ass face, who the hell is this tranny?
Say what you will but shes an excellent press secretary
Jamel hill is a racist no talent hack.
ONLY TROLLS, BELOW, ARE ON  THIS COMMENT PAGE.
I wish she would have just said how about espn sucks our fucking dicks, they are lying scum.
Who the f*ck is Jemele whatever?  Trump making another person famous. She sounds like a black racist.
Sarah is by far the worst. I almost miss Spicer. This is the face of nepotism, no talent, no personality, no likability. She always looks tired, bored and stressed. I don't even care what the topic is about she is speaking on.
1) What Jemele Hill tweeted what a large majority of African Americans think. Nothing she said was out of bounds or untrue. \n2) Why is the White House focused on what someone's opinion is? There are far more pressing issues that needs attention.\n3) A fireable offense? She didn't tweet on the behalf of ESPN. She didn't say what she thought on the air. She tweeted from her personal twitter account. Also isn't one of America's foundations freedom of speech?\n\nI have a new found respect for The Six. #iSupport
White Trash Cunt House.
Fuck you, youtube!
https://www.gofundme.com/4esiwu8
Espn is disgusting
Some of you are acting sick. This is a human being you're calling names and demeaning. You can disagree with her, disagree with the people she represents, but at the end of the day, we're all human beings with unique thoughts and opinions. And how long is it gonna take before we understand that again?
Dear YouTube: Please stop suggesting stuff from Fox News to me. I think you should check to see if right-wing nutjobs have hacked your stuff.

Finally I am so excited.   I love these ladies.  Cece Peniston is BEAUTIFUL!!!. The camera does not doe her justice at all.    I met her once in Chicago. We were standing in Chase bank  inside of the John Hancock where I was working for an advertising company in the building at the time.  She was standing behind me and she ask something and I answered.  I don't remember the question now.  I was shock!  I said your Cece Pippppp. I got her name wrong she corrected so kindly that it was funny.

back when real music was still made.
I love CeCe Peniston..... great to see her.
this is my first introduction of her, and i love her already, her voice is so Majestic in my ear, its like the voice of African chanter who pray to the nature
Just curious, does anyone know if Wendy started production a week early? Because on twitter I seen recent video's and pics that her studio audience posted from a few days ago.
I'm still doing box braids for just $65. No need to buy hair it's already  included for FREE. Save this number to your phone now and forward it to your friends in Houston. Text 24 hours to 713-five-four-eight-3656.
Finally is such a timeless bop
Love her! Long gone are the days of the powerhouse voices over house beats
I hear so much Chaka Khanisms in this vocal production that I first I thought it was Miss Chaka herself!
Cede Peniston's voice is FIRE! Go head girl!
WOW!!
Yaaasss! This song was my jam back in the day, and still is. Cece still has it!
I'm having a major nostalgia moment. I remember being 9 and dancing around the house to CeCe Peniston's Finally and starting my stuff.
Well i mean she knows the tea about the celebrities that interest her and Beyonce.  Rest of the tea ?   Not so much
Cece WHERE YOU BEEN????!!!!!!! Wowwwww!!! 😲😲😲😲😳😳😳😳 I used to love you!
Gurl this is a dream come true for Wendy
OMG, she didn't age \none bit!
Liked the old one better
Never heard of this lady,.but wow ! such a beautiful voice..
So no more feel it feel it feel it how yo doin??? :((((
Yes I love cc
is Wendy's boobs gettin' bigger 😕😕 lol\ni love her..but i think her boobs is too big for her slim tall body 😂\ni bet she got some boob-less girls jealous..   lol\n\nBut damn Cece...Your pipes still fresh and strong ..😍
I love CeCe's pearl necklace, clutching my own...
I hope this is the new theme song at the start of each episode
Who keeps sending me this videos. of Wendy. She is wack n I don't watch this show.
WHAT. My girl is doing the theme song for my girl Wendy?! YES it's going to be LIT 🔥 Now where is my ticket for my birthday 9/17? On 9/18 I need to be in the building!!
That's my girl....she still got it.!
In here for it
Her speaking voice reminds me of Mariah Carey's.
I hope wendy if you reading this! I'm your biggest fan! My wish is if you can share my channel or like!
Why they keep changing the songs and intro sequences keep the same ones 😤😤
Cece seems like a genuinely happy person & has a nice personality. Something about her reminds me of Taraji P. Henson.
Wendy loves cici. I loved her music  growing up.
I was obsessed w/ _Finally_ and _Keep on Walkin'._ My lil' friends and I made a step to _Keep on Walkin'._ It was hella cute. I've never invested in a full album though. I'm curious so I will be checkin' on the rest of yo' music, Cece. You can still sing.
Im here for cece. Before 7/27/17, i use to watch Wendy williams FAITHFULLY. I needed wendy in my life & clicked on all her notifications. BUT every since the birth of my newborn, I havent had anytime to catch up 😥 its Amazing how i use to live for wendy until my son came into the world, now he be having me up in the strangest hours & sleep mostly in the day. And since that date i havent seen absolutely nothing from WW. But when i saw Cece Peniston? I was like CLICK .LOL. I just had to share that
Great promo.   LOVE me some CeCe -- she is a treasure.
Wait until Monday - this Finally could easily be just Promo for the return - she's had her custom how you doin for her career I doubt she drops the show classic theme song...thats why its a theme song lol...this is just promo work
YEAS!!!!! Love CeCe
Yesssss...
WOW, she looks amazing!!
My queen

Still knockin Cece in 2017 and beyond. I'd love a collab with her and Calvin H. or Disclosure.
Cece P.,  you shoulda Added. Yaaasss  at the end of the song 😁
LMFAO Wendy is NOT good for the LGBTQ community. She is so homophobic/transphobic. Smh
YASSSSSS C.C. U Did That!!! 🔥👏🔥🔥👏🔥🔥
Wendy Got nasty spaghetti legs
If Bethesda wants to gain popularity from nintendo fans...\n\n\n\n\n....they're succeeding.
And Bethesda again shows itself to be better than E.A
This is massive.\n\nBethesda putting other 3rd parties on notice! Lol
Hell yeah, thank you id software and Nintendo.
Wow Nintendo nice call
Bethesda is one of the best allies helping   the Switch if other game developer give it more of a chance Switch will be way more successful. (Now here come the hate comments).
Holy shit Nintendo is back, now if they could bring The Witcher 3 for Nintendo Switch, then there will be a excuse for me to buy a Nintendo Switch. Something tells me SONY is watching and saying holy shit is time to bring PS4 Portable.
Never expected this
Holy shit, this is big, this is fucking Huge!!!
Fuck playing Doom and Wolfenstein on the go will be so sick
first time i saw this in direct\n\n\nme:WAIT WHAT
Can we collect amiibos instead of the pop vinyls in doom for the switch?
Vulkan API Boyz!!!!
haill to bethesda now wee need fallout 4
Amazing move from Nintendo!!!!
Fucking Doom wasn't expecting that, will buy
I guess Doom CAN run on anything...huh..
Where did this boner come from
My PC can max out these games but I want the portability, so I'll be buying them for Switch.
Now we're talking!
This is really a surprise, i don't know how a system wich can't run Overcooked at 30fps will be able to run DOOM on the go... Maybe it's a custom built, or those Switch are gonna melt for sure
The haters are going rage hater mode with this
Did they hire that guy from Polygon to play this build too?
Now if only we could get Deus Ex Human Revolution on this thing. Don't feel like getting a Wii U to play that version of the game.\nEDIT: NVM, I take it back, I just remembered the Switch doesn't have Dual Screen functionality.
low settings 720p 60fps im fine with it just 60fps pleaseeeeee
Switch underpowered umm nope...
damn the resolution looks sub 720p...
Nice announcement ! one thing i noticed is that the downgrade is huge, if they keep the 60 fps stable it will still be a blast to play regardless of the visual quality.
For the people who say that Doom on switch is 30 fps, it looks 600 fps (I know it's 60 fps)
Haters' reaction:\nbut.... but.... Switch has no power... no way... they're gonna be crappy ports... yeah... that's it... crappy ports....
I hope people support this, I have DOOM for the PC and it was an incredible experience.  And now that Wolfenstein 2 is coming to the Switch, I might pick it up for that instead of the PC.  Nice one Nintendo!
Can't wait to be sitting on my uber and killing demons and nazi's violently.
is Carmack still with ID I want this game I'm so happy now.
Nintendo I vow that if any dark souls game is ported over to nintendo switch I will buy it tomorrow.
I got a PlayStation ad.. lol.
and fifa switch is a fifa 18 ps3 port...
Kinda bummed that the Switch version of Doom won't be getting Snapmap. I'm probably one of those weirdos who really loved the idea of map building on the go.
C A N Y O U F E E L T H E 3 0 F P S , M R  K R A B S
If we get the next elder scrolls for switch, I would fucking bend the knee to Bethesda
Yay I can play the games I can never play cause I didn't have the right console
If switch gets doom\n\nOverwatch is a must now.
I can play Doom sitting on the toilet, in my bed, on the bus, in the sewers, on a tree, chilling in a hot bath,
0:23 DID NINTENDO JUST SAYED NAZI!?\n\nmah nigga nintendo is growing WILD
XBOX IN 3RD PLACE NOW FOR SURE! SERVES THEM RIGHT THO HAHAHA
Time for me to cancel my Wolfenstein PS4 pre-order...
Playing proper Doom while on a bus... that sounds fucking good.
I am not at all trying to sound greedy because this is freaking insane, CAN WE PLEASE GET DISHONORED 2 ON SWITCH?!?!?!
Swastika in a Nintendo Direct? *TRIGGERED*\n\nAll seriousness,  I'm glad Nintendo grew up.
I'm cool with some DooM on the go.
I'm glad i didn't buy doom last year. now ill be able to play the best version of the game and I'm really excited to buy and play this.
I could get the graphically superior versions on PS4 but I'm getting both of these on Switch.  Portability > Graphics
If you don't have a true understanding of the switches power. Just save your ignorant comments. The switch is slot stronger than alot of you realize.
I never thought Id hear this guy say Nazi
it's gonna be a weird feeling when the kkk and nazi's are on my switch.
Gey fucking in there... never got the chance to play doom
Watch cod 2018 be on switch.  I'm calling it
Did honestly never see this comming.\nI think i just came a little bit...
OMG YES! DOOM ON THE SWITCH!
Well look at that. Nintendo says the word Nazi and shows the Swastika and the world didn't end. Man fuck these developers and their infantile pandering to the dumbest people on Earth.
Delet this
YYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
yoooo
🎶bandz make Nintendo dance baybeeee🎶
Nazis?  In my Nintendo?
wow, megaton announcement :o speaking of which....  fallout 3 plx?
Iconic:v
Damn
Holy shit man!!!
WHOO!!! 🤘😆
Fuckin hell yeah
NAAAAAAAANIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Thats incredible
OMG WTF DUDE THIS SHIT IS DOPE !
me Sorprende que lo pueda correr en la Nintendo switch
Yay, Doom on low settings and 30 FPS.
will those two games be running on 20 fps?
I hope that the scenes they showed are switch footage (but it's probably not)
It the switch can run it, I'd like to see it for Android/iOS soon too
Can doom even run 60 fps on the switch?
Doom's online mode is dead : /
AND THEY'VE LISTENED! DECENT THIRD PARTY SUPPORT! THANK FUCK! Took their time since the SNES era though!
looks blurry af tho :/ hope it will be 60fps at least
bad quality for nintendo switch\npd: better in pas4 and xbox one\npd: much better in PC Master Race
Lets just wait and see if the game actually runs on anything higher than 480p 25fps before we collectively suck Nintendos dick!!!
Instead of porting old good games, nintendo is going to burn it self with new games that would barely run on it.\nIf Switch could run CS:GO and BF BC 2 on it with a decent multiplayer, their sells would be sky rocketing.
Is it just me or this smells like fucking downgrade?
Nice, but it won't sell well. Nintendo needs 3rd party games released on their system either exclusively or at the very least on the same day as the other platforms.
Looks like it's time to buy a lot more memory cards since the Switch has the same hard drive space as a Gameboy
Bruh, First Skyrim , then Doom and Wolfenstein, now I belive anything is possible. What's next? Fallout 4?!
teh switch has no hardcor gamsssss\nit babby consollllll\nit needs more schuuuut\n*wish gets granted, haters have nothing to complain about*\n....... the gaphics still sux\n*points out it runs on a handheld system*\n*hater cries*\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Older nvidia shield tablet which is less powerfull(half the ram etc) can run crysis 3 on android so surely switch can run about anything on a fixed platform. Super exited gonna buy both! Allready played doom on powerfull pc but gameplay over the graphics and take it on the go muchnwow!1
I wonder if doom will run at 60fps. Because the game was designed to run at a solid 60fps and anything less just won't work in my opinion
Yeah, because the Switch can totally run these.\nGuys I was joking, please stop replying !
How about Prey the Goty
xbox crossplay, please
Noice
Can you run doom on a machine equal to a xbox 360/ps3??????(the switch)....can it even properly run it with frame rate problems???? And a 32 gb harddrive????? No, you can't....iphones even have 64/128 gb....32 is it????? Thats it????
30fps lol
So we can expect to run like shit in that shitty console, so why are the nintytards excited?
You are so beautiful
I really don't know the foundation oxidized darker than your neck area because i noticed in this video that your face is quite darker than your neck area. Or maybe it's the way it looks to viewers

Donate and help out by visiting https://handinhand2017.com/
I live in Florida and I had to evacuate, over 6 million people evacuated the roads were insane. I slept two days in my car on an area rest because there was no hotels available, and took shelter in a church. Im trying to vlog all of this but I don't have how to upload it now. Im currently on my way back to Florida, I don't know what to expect. I tried to contact neighbors to see what's going on in my region but had no luck reaching them. Im scared of going back to a completely destroyed home. Not to mention that power is still off for millions of people. If you have a chance please pray for Texas and everyone that was affected by Irma. This is truly a very scary and sad situation.
Diddy ugly ass worth over 500 million and he's out here asking all you broke people to donate what little you have!😂😂😂
u guyz suck.
Very low views because a sermon from the left bashing the Right
This fund raiser would not have happened if The Donald had not out up a mil. this is not an honest fund raiser its a feel good leftie back rub for their own strike at Trump
they all can do it themselves. they are all rich right there. why are they asking money from us.  if your going to donate, go yourself over or do it  thru  someone u trust#jesus loves#jesus saves
Was this logo designed by a communist?
Might want to change the 1984 victory logo of the event
Weird, I remember Beyonce's Formation video showing an officer drowning in hurricane Katrina clean up.  She is scum
This is only #21 on trending? It oughtta be #1!!!
I live in Florida born and raised and haven't seen any relief money will we the ppl really be helped??
The sad thing is that it takes something like this for us to help each other. That's the problem.
Fakest people on planet earth under one roof.
What if you physically don't have another hand to give.
Well put together, Aloha from Honolulu Hawaii
they even got the despacito guy!
Proverbs 11:21 (KJV)\n\nThough hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.\n\nDon't fear the storm fear the LORD, turn to Jesus as your lord and savior.
beyonce said everything i am thinking ❤️💙👏🏼all my love and prayers are with those hurting
We need you to donate all your money while we get more money from this event than you have in your entire life!\n\nShut up and take my money.
Does anyone realise that that room is worth billions? Raising 14 million dollars sound like a joke to me(considering having them all there). And Apple donated 5 mil of it. I know they have a good purpose. I can appreciate that. But that could be much more if these filthy rich people weren't this stingy. I feel bad for the world but today I especially feel bad for those victims. God bless them and protect them.
We're the actors really talking to people or is that more used as a visual representation of people giving to make other people give?
I am sorry but I do not have a red or grey hand so I feel your logo is just not reaching me.
We can do it together and I hope that all this money does good to all the people who need it
justinnnnnn!!!!! i love you, i hope you get a lot of money to help them
Was I the only one who watched vic mensa's ig livestream
Cam den & ReligionwhistleBlower, Here is how media and entertainment society brainwashed us. They have been showing us that it is ok to go all around the world to those poor countries and kill millions of their innocent people and take away their natural resources. They have been showing us that it is ok to kill 10 million Native Americans together with their buffalos. They have been showing us that black lives don’t matter. They showed us that it is ok to throw atomic bomb and kill innocent people. They took away the name of our Creator from the face of our nation and they let those illiterate preachers who worship idols mislead us, that is why the Angeles of the Almighty, the drives of the wind bring down 1900 tornados upon them every year plus floods, fires, and hurricanes, and mudslides. Our media have been showing us that fast foods are good for us, yet every year people are dying of cancers and many other diseases instead of a normal death. They have been showing us that chemical fertilizers are good, and they say spray your food with chemical poisons it is good for you. Our media have been showing us that polluting the air is ok and we don’t get lung cancer because of that. They have been promoting cigarettes; alcohol and gambling in order for us to die of lung cancers, accidents, family problems, and divorces. They have been promoting all kinds of sex, adulteries and homosexuality in order for us to get different diseases and aid killing 49 million so far. They have been showing us that killing our own people it is ok, that is how they have been promoting guns for all. They have been showing us that white color crimes are ok, that is why they do not charge those highly educated criminals. Everything our media have taught us is against the laws of our creator. You are right they have been hiding the awesome message of our creator based on mathematics ever since 40 some years ago. The crimes that media have committed are far greater than all of those criminals from the beginning of time combined. Leaving the system of our creator only brings down suffering and disasters upon us. Therefore, when the Almighty sends His next disaster just make sure that is the consequence of our own wrong doings, so do not complain. His law is, “Nothing happens to you if you follow the rules of our Creator”.
The comment section is frustrating...
I bet they had a really good time and they partied just inflating their egos these celebrity dirtbags
Nice, but you celebs are idiots! If you each give 1m, so much will be done! I'm never buying a ticket to a concert seeing that these celebs can't truly give back after earning so much from us. Just ridiculous!
Ah MTV. When we aren't busy ruining the very fabric of your family by corrupting your kids with immoral values and depravity, we like to all hold hands and take one day out of the year to give back ;)
Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.   Most people were turned off and would rather donate through other avenues.
don't donate to them because most of the money goes to making this video ads etc.
Those celebrities were all paid to answer the phones on tv.... from donations. And many were seen joking around. The rich don't care. Ever seen a celebrity actually volunteer .... by doing manual labor for more than a few minutes??
Hurricane Harvey - I Won't Be Afraid By Goldy Locks\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgRXYRlQ1is\n:-)  :-)  :-)
Damn 😕Stevie wonder never age he looks younger and younger every time I see him he  been in the music business before  Micheal Jackson 👑 was dominating the music business in the 80s and  and he still look younger than most 30 or or 40 year olds
you want us to donate money to rich people living in exotic locations who are too stupid to get insurance? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA !  HELL NO !!!
I wont donate to anthing Clinton  and Bushes are involved in. They will steal.it and give it to the rich
This is sad they asking us for money knowing we struggling helping each other as it is now, they rich they need to give some money, we need all we got.
17:18 : is that David Copperfield in the back seat ? Couldn't he use some of his magic (dollars) to speed\n things up a lilbit?
Figures MTV(masonic television)would use the masters handshake for their symbol.
**CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX. 97% AGREE WITH THAT CONSENSUS**
As of 9/13/17 @6pm EDT, despite being on more than 12 broadcast and cable TV networks and other media outlets on the web - this telethon hosted by 125 multi-millionaires drew only 16 MILLION viewers and pledges/donations of $44 MILLION.  All totals are not in yet.   http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/hand-in-hand-hurricane-telethon-ratings-1202556721/
is this a break from the usual race baiting and division from MTV and now they want to pretend they can do a come together benefit?
NICOLE KIDMAN GIVE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE WE KNOW ANTONY KIDMAN WAS A PEDOPHILE. #PizzagateIsReal 🍕🍕🍕🍕
Could have been a great thing. Unfortunately some ot these idiots had to prove that their ego is bigger than their heart and start the political attacks.  Shame on those that did and for those who were there for the right reason, I commend you.  I personally donated through the fund set up by the 5 former presidents.
WORSE CONCERT, EVER,  for relief efforts. It was completely audaciously arrogantly pathetically...political. Damn liberals. Why is it that every so-called, self-entitled Artist, is usually a hypocrite democrat liberal? Why? \nI was going to donate my hard-earned hundred dollars to the benefit. But since it was political in every respect, I kept the money. Besides. Those homes/businesses/property damaged, will be more than graciously funded by the federal and state governments. \nNot only that. But being that the entire concert was pathetically relating everything in the world to theoretical global warming. And calling Americans...Idiots, I highly doubt any amount of money donated would go to hurricane relief.  \nShameful. Pathetic. A mildly active year in the Atlantic, and liberal hypocrites proclaim it is the end-of-the-world, with Greenhouse effect, happening globally. \nNext time. Just play some music. Keep politics out-of-it, and you'll get plenty of donations. But artists calling people/viewers, Idiots, is totally uncalled for and extremely biased. And artists proclaim they are not racist. You are fine being next to a liberal so long as you do not disagree with them.
The absolute height of Liberal insanity; blaming the whether on Trump and Terrorism.\nABSOLUTE FUCKTARDS.
are this a South Park episode?
They couldve gave themselves as well this is crazy
The Globe is warming soooooo fast, that our Antarctic ice caps are refreezing at the most rapid pace in recent history! I never knew how such hot temperatures could freeze water so fast!
I like that they used unlikely duos.
Hey MTV, why not show the full clip of Stevie Wonder in the beginning?  Not only his out of place, badly timed ad hominum toward those who might donate, but his insensitive Xian prayer that he sneaked into his speech.

Reading most of the comments for hand n hand some very disturbing.\nAnyway we all subjected to our own opinion. We can't stop natural disaster but can help after it hpn.\nTimes like these is very heartbreaking to see but if we not living as God want us to probably a disaster needed to hpn in order for us to come together as a family n help each other. \nHand n Hand if u all can maintain wat u doing, u all can n will make a great difference in people life.\nShe say Even d scrums from d master table will make her hole , a rich man waste is a poor man's  wealth .wat since it make to pride our self in riches , hand n hand if u all can record every step of d way contributions ah being made. \nHand n Hand shud become the major world aid funding organizations.
By the way... do you say WHERE to get the AID for those people that need it?.. I don't see that anywhere. Remember when Hillary got all that money for Haiti? She and Bill KEPT all that money and oh gave some to their rich friends. To this day, people in Haiti have NOT seen any of that money!

GLOBAL WARNING IS A FRAUD....!!!!!!!    BUT YOU ARE SO NAIVE YOU    BE LIE VE      THEIR LIES....!!!
CAME HERE FOR TORI\nI LOVE U TORI\n\nBTW ISN'T IT IRONIC THE RICHEST CELEBRITIES ARE BEGGING FOR PEOPLE TO DONATE? DON'T THINK THEY DONATED A FRACTION OF WHAT THEY HAVE
Cam den, here is the answer: These Entertainment People have been playing a big role in bringing these disasters upon us, like hurricanes, tornados, floods, fires, and so on. These people have been paralyzing us by drugs, alcohol, on their TV, and movies with all kinds of sex and music to the point that our people are not able to think anymore, and they do not know who created them from ejected semen, just read those posts. These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites. This is the only message could save you, otherwise you are only going to suffer before our Land Lord Creator evict you from His temporary dwelling.
why cant all these celebs donate among themselves instead of asking us for dough. Its a joke.... when will the sheeple wake the f___ up....
This would be a beautiful thing if the money actually went to the people who need it. Yes the real America helped each other and showed their compassion, but all of you celebrities are doing nothing more than what you get paid to do, and that is act.
JJ watt collected 31 million real dollars compared to your 14 million fake pledge dollars and he was at ground zero passing out food and water Hollywood calling the working man a racist and a nazi than begs him for money so hmmmm give u greedy fucktards money or jj watt i went with jj i encourage the rest of hard working Americans to do the same
More left-wing propagandists making money off of a disaster.  I have to wonder what percentage will ever make it to the people who need it.  Good Lord, these hateful, left-wing hypocrites make me want to puke.  So full of themselves.
These damn celebrities good give a rat's ass about the common people! They live in their own fantasy world with selfies! Bunch of hypocritical morons that are out of touch with the common people!!
Money  raised by a bunch of liberals, only a fraction of the money will go for helping those in need, the rest will go in their pockets, Please give to another organization, these folks already have to much money,
Dont there just going to take them money and run like the rich always do I am taking them a truck load of fresh water next week help how you can
very sad ,and it could happen anywhere and will ,but we americans WILL ALWYS SURVIVE AND MOVE ON ,,,,,GOD BLESS US
Japanese television programs should respect the overseas television, :(

Jim Carrey is experiencing a phenomena called nondual awakening. Thats when a person awakens to the essential nature of their being which is one with the totality of all that is. The side effects of this awakening include seeing that the personality one used to identify with as oneself is not one's true face(essence) as well as recognizing that everyone is walking about in a trance of identification with the sense of personal self and the mind thoughts that go with it. This is well understood by some spiritual traditions in india, tibet and japan as well as by contemporary teachers such as eckhart tolle.
I love jim the vessel
Jim Carrey has had some recent epiphany. His entire demeanor has ventured into a very interesting and intelligent speaking person
I'd love to meet you Jim carrey I pray God protects you from all evil!
He's brilliant.  Ugh I love this guy
 You're a caracter that plays you your whole life ☀️
I love that he exists
i think jim carrey is chanelling andy kaufman . he isnt going crazy . hes playing a role .
Jim Carrey should've actually been cast as Genie in the live action  Aladdin movie.. Or Bill Hader.
ITS ALL JUST A SHAM. Well i think thats the point jim is trying to make.
holywood is weird not Jim..run by satanist and reptilian ppl are wakin up and you cant stop this any more
Jim Carrey actually understanding & explaining Tom Campbells My Big Toe...Understanding Consciousness & of course Sacred Geometry!!! Bravo, Bravo!!🤓🤓👌👌👁👁👏👏 Awoke folks
thats too many satanists in one room for my liking, thanks.
Jim's the only real person there. And he's the only one who brushed his hair properly.
Saw this behavior in Charlie Sheen   WINNING! ! remember? whatever this is stay tunned in less than a year u well hear something on why either way live this actor all the best
Jim hasn't lost anything. He has just gained enlightenment
Please play Terence Mckenna - you're the only one who will do justice.
I like Jim Carey even if he doesn't exist. P.S. good one on the Clooney Goons.
Jim is not going thru a meltdown, Jim is woke af
I miss Jim Carrey's suicided mistress.. she was an angel of light :(((((
33 dislikes just  like your masonic rank...Jim..
dam i lov this guy
Jim Carrey is CRRAZZY. Damn.

LIAR
congrats Jim Carrey on becoming a Sufi.
Liar!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
His eyes gonna pop
New Jim Carrey movie - Just Dummer Juan
I'm liking Carey more and more.\n\nI hope he stays with us a lot longer.  I really dig his painting.
Jesus Christ what happen to Chris smith
Hello everyone, this is a comment.
Is this a symptom of STD's?
faux library in elevator at Windsor Arms....tooo funny
i hope jim  basses  through this phase without hurting him self
Jim looks good to me. I think the media just needs someone to trash
A coworker spun this story to me how Jim went completely insane and needed serious mental help, and he really, really believed it. But nothing Jim's said is shocking at all (it's viral marketing if anything, but I'd hope its not), and I wonder how this coworker has made it through his whole life so sheltered from these kinds of ideas that he needed a family-friendly face like Jim to break through the conservative-protestant shell. And now this company is profiting off of people like him, and I guess off of people like me too.
Jim just might see the REAL truth, and he's disgusted.
Not enough Andy Kaufman comments here.
I will say the truth what the hell is going on with out world LOL
Jim Carrey may very well have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.  His hypermobility and other issues make this a strong possibility.
The minute you are perceived by the masses of society as being crazy- Congratulations!!! You are finally very close to letting the ego die and becoming one with the universe. Most people can't comprehend this because they do not spend any time in meditation. They want to label someone crazy as soon as THEY become uncomfortable or don't understand something. The truth is, there are very few sane people who must share the world  with masses of copycat, unoriginal, Stepfordesque people who do their best to keep up with trends on People magazine. We know you are doing the best you can so we accept you as you are. Psst stop taking life so seriously -Jim's right we are basically just a bunch of atoms bumping into one another.
I love how all the people lost in this illusion thinks there is something wrong with him. There is definitely an awakening happening on this planet! I hope it keeps going because the alternative sucks.
I would absolutely love to sit down with Jim Carrey have a few beers and talk about his spiritual beliefs 🙌🏼
He's getting cooler and more awesome as he gets older!!
what jim carry is trying to say is lets stop believing on moon landing 
It's amazing to see, Jim surpass into a multi million dollar actor, starting with Ace Ventura. Lol, if only he can travel back to his prime time years. Honestly, he just needs to move forward and do what he's best at currently. We grow up and mature from doing what we done in the past. I think he's desperately trying to grasp that, that we age. You have to see aging as wine, the older the better.
he says something like ... i do not do the jim carrey character anymore, it's not something you do or don't do, you simply 'are not'. He is somehow still there going through the idea of not being there... It's the apparent game of experiencing you not being there. It's not up to you to accept or not accept 'what is'. This can't be put really into words or understood. 'What is' appears as an apparent jim carrey saying that. It's a cosmic joke. Nobody does the joke.
They're on acid
Depression only happens when you don't accept what is. \nI love you Jim, but depression is for real, and has to be treated. It's not to be taken lightly.
There are  mental issues going on here
Awesome, Jim...I feel the same...people think I'm losing it, but I've always been this way...I just suppressed myself to fit into society...but I'm older now...society doesn't have as much hold on me...so what if people think we're crazy...those who want to listen will and those who don't want to, wont💗
Danny Gabai looks like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber.  Tell me I'm not imagining this.
he feels his own persona is depressing, i call it here first, i have a sad feeling he will kill himself, i hope not.
If I was sitting next to Jim Carrey I would feel like I finally met my brother/father in person after all these years.
Ugh he's trying too hard to be quirky and mysterious he just comes across as insecure and attention seeking. But what do I know I'm just some kid

The title is misleading, there is nothing weird about him. I was laughing and understood the depth of some of his comments.
The problem for famous people that are going thru wierd phases in life, is that its public and they get a lot of atention, when they should be solitary, or just around close people, that love them no matter what. \nI also find it intresting on how many people that gain celebrity status, seems to have som sort of mental instabilitys.\nAt least it shows, we are all human... and also, never be jealous for these people, beacuse theyre just people. \n(English is not my first language, sorry for miss-spelling)
Confused: what's weird here? He entertains, and does it intelligently.
He doesn't get weird at all.... he is simply growing
IT WAS ALL A FUCKIN STUNT
He's awake and trying to adjust to living amongst people who are sleeping walking.
He's a living \nlegend
Sorry I'm back, I just went on a 4 hour Andy Kaufman youtube binge.
creative, authentic for some limited human beings just means weird.
Prophet Carrey.. he's here for enlightenment..
People are saying he's losing it, but it seems like he's always been an odd guy. Just look at his early movies/interviews. His comedy was always goofy but had this existential tinge to it. Like, a caricature of human behavior. Almost mocking reality. I think he's brilliant, and a really bright guy, and he's probably had these weird thoughts his entire life. It contributes to his genius.
Jim Carrey please don't die soon.
i want to be a voyeur on this one.\n\nLIAR!
Really attacking him, aren't you, you perverted shills. He doesn't like you.  There's nothing you can say. He's right not to like you.
What an artist. I appreciate when someone realizes the character they are playing.. great energy.
I love how Jim challenges the cameraman to focus on two fields of view at the same time... and how he becomes the heckler from afar in an instant... how does he do it? I mena, make us know what he's doing regardless as to how unconventional it is?
he's woke up.probably seen what happened with Robin Williams and realised he needed to change.no longer be the preforming monkey.or the clown that makes others laugh and happy and not himself.the time lines even match up
Clickbait Title! Jim was fab..he's a thoughtful non-sheeple genius. Big respect!! to Him !!!!!
Jim carrey is so frickng awesome!! We are all God's children and once we get past all the crap so called smart people make up. Then we will be able to give credit where its due. To the creator of everything God! We love you Jim!
Who else thinks some 'rape scandal' or some overdose will be related to jim?
Hollywood destroying Jim Carrey because he outed the Illuminati. Not nice to see.
Legend
Narcissus. Why?? 😕
Egomaniac. He thinks hes so important. Interupts others, seeks attention.
Depression
❤️
Wtf

Broken jim vs broken matt
Publicity stunt.
Nothing weird here...love this guy

jim is my favorite infector
James
Jim WOW....
I think Jim Carey is preparing for a role which is why he is acting strange
Spiritual awakening the most amazing defining moments in ones journey
Dear YouTube -- Please stop recommending Jim Carrey videos to me. He is a dangerous anti-vaccine mental case that needs serious help, but because of his riches and fame thinks he can do no wrong. I have no time in my life for people like him.
He's not Crazy. He's Awake. Congrats on migrating out of The Matrix Jim.
lol jim carrey gave a lady herpes like a boss and she killed herself! lol he's so enlightened!

Keep it up. Fuck Beiber. YOU make you relevant.
I rate it 9/11.
Back to the good old days!
Omg 666k views when I clicked on it anybody else
my neighbor said this to me the other day
Manson has been on an upswing for two albums now. Love Born Villain and Pale Emperor. The new one is sounding like a good one as well.
i'd like to think we're all in agreement here, but if this is the official video, it is boring AF. Pretty out of character for Manson... but who buys CD's, or are they called Albums again, anyway?
Keep being yourself. One of the only true artists left. Please continue to create
Our music of our demonic beast like generation will abolish corporate and religious fundamental scum as the system will be pissed on hell what we consider enemies shall vanish
Honestly this is pretty sweet. He hasn't had any double bass since 96. just saying.
He's a musical genius..
Jesus incarnate never left, wtf is wrong with you egotistical morons?
god this is so bad
Prison is where we know where you live
Lyke O MAW GAWD this mara lynn manson guy is sooOoOoOo0o0oOoo edgy!!! He said the F word in a song title!!!!! WOWZERS
I'm just commenting this so I can look back at it in the future in case this is his last song
He hasn't sounded like that since Antichrist Superstar.
Much better than that last shitty album he put out.  Hopefully trump has pissed him off enough to being good material to the whole album.
Back to the roots 🤘👍
This sounds like filter, but i like it :D
This is so good! Have great day I'm going to listen the shit out of it
I'm going to see him live in a couple weeks, I can't wait to hear this badass song live !!!!!!!!
I just don't get the message behind this song. Maybe he only did it for fun, after all Deep Six didn't really have a message as well and it was still a pretty cool song.
I want  marilyn  manson music  videos  on my youtube  tablet
Dear God (Marilyn Manson)\nplease make a music video for this song, and make it explicit (as in dirty!!!!!)\nI love you Manson\nCarry on making masterpieces you fucking legend!\nFrom a big big fan Jack Adam Brown
Hope to see you bock in Germany, great Song! Welcome back, God of Chaos
Yeah! A cool new song by the master
the lyrics are disappointing, falling into the same trap of repitition just like basically everyone else.
Is this real am I not dreaming
Always a true artist
Cool 💟 a like Music Marilyn Manson 👅👄💘
I legit thought this was a threat video to Marilyn Manson
This is the Marilyn Manson we know and love. \m/
The king is back!!🔥
of course they know where i live, they surveilled me. but none the less, those were pop idiots and tv sluts. this tune likely has nothing to do with that though.
🤔Do I detect the sound of Helicopter Blades approaching a home at the beginning?..me thinks so. One of MM's strongest attributes is his Mastery of SUBTEXT. Hendrix did it with his version of The Star Spangled Banner and adding the UNMISTAKABLE sound of Falling  Bombs, his Sign O' Time's (lil shout out to our late Purple Prince) being the Vietnam War and images of Jets dropping Napalm on the TV set of most American Households at the time..
As a fan for 21 yrs  I'm not sure yet  if it's a thumbs up or down.....It seems to have the sound from the late 90s  and the best era for me,however everyone's different and prefers different sounds.....but it seems better than he has been doing for the last few years
all that hate and now he's back with a bang :D go MM!!!!!
I prefer cleaner and more melodic vocals to be honest.
Nice job Marilyn!  Modern day poet  and philosopher and so misunderstood
Omg i love him i worship him this song is amazing he truly is god
typical people typical comments. That's why I hate you all.
Just like the old school Manson. Freakin love it. Keep the songs coming man. This is good shit. Can't wait to hear the new album.
I hope that one day he could make good music again... so disappointed to hear how bad he's become.
It is back and i like this song but in live concrt he sings like nothing for me sucks live
Love letter to the pRESIDENT...
Wow this is coming out on my birthday, October 6th. Niiiiiiiiice.
Finally starting to sound like himself, not that weird gay mainstream shit
still fucking up their program...\nlike a boss. <3 <3 <3    C==B hah ha ha...
extremely disappointed in myself on movie clip
Look forward to hearing the rest. Marilyn Manson is one of the few who still puts out new stuff I like as much as the old.

Stop talking shit doug. Talk about experiment, how about Fingertip. They've shoved it up our mouth, theyve tried a new genre but people didnt want it. People kept telling gfriend to bring back their cute concept. Now here it is and yet, people say their songs sound the same. Stop being two faced.
이 곡 전주 부분도 작곡한거에요?
이기용배들은 앞으로 너 그리고 나 같은 노래 안 만들거면 그냥 좀 쏘스뮤직에 얼씬 거리지 마세요. 귀 기 후에 또 똑같은 스타일의 노래로 내고 누가 들어도 레인보우가 타이틀인데 뭡니까 이게...\n\n소성진이도 문제 이거 에쎔에서 허송세월 보냈나... \n이기용배도 훌륜한데 다른 좋은 작곡가들도 많이 좀 만나봐라. 우물안의 개구리 새키야

Will they perform on The Show tomorrow or not ?
To see more of Aaron Carter's interview, visit http://bit.ly/2h1UADj.
I'm glad he's being open and honest with everyone and himself about what's going on. He's a brave man.
Seems as though anyone hanging out with Michael Jackson as a kid or tween, always end up fucked up. Aaron Carter, Mukauley Kulken, Corey Feldman.... I think there might be a link...
i still love you aaron
All I gotta say is that we need more celebs like him how much I can admit to say that he's probably on my next list on looking him up more often expected
This dude needs actual rehab not a TV show. He's just playing to the audience and reading some of these comments people are actually believing this bull. The way he cuts them off to praise them for helping him is such an addict move. He knows what to say and do to pretend to get help shy of actually doing it. Keep patting him on the back for nothing and he'll OD
If you ever knew a junkie than you know 100% if his lips are moving he's lying. I wish him the best.
Omg i hope he gets better
hang in there, Aaron...keep reaching out for help, cuz we want you well <3
He's an addict telling people what they want to hear, pure and simple, he may not be addicted to cocaine or meth, but he is addicted to benzos, and to be honest,  he needs to come out of the closet fully, i bet thats the reason this is going on.
Jeez someone loves saying things that get him applause. Hope he gets the help he needs but being recovered myself, he wont help himself truely until HE wants help. I think, maybe the well is running dry and coming on the show gets him back in public and the subject is eye grabbing. Hes obviously sick-mentally and physically. Way to go bug bro Nick. He is tryin to be as successful as you and you may or may not be helpin
Omg I love Norman Vincent Peale!! My grandpa listened to him too. Aaron has a good heart I think he means we'll and he just needs better influences and direction
Sometimes people need those drugs. Give them some credit. Yeah they CAN kill you, but most medications can if they aren't taken correctly. Time and a place for everything. But for anxiety, it's good to find the right medicine and then get therapy.
How can you use prescription for Xanax responsibly one minute and then get it off the street the next? 🤦‍♀️
Why did he come on the show if he already had all the freakin answers...... honestly I feel bad for him, because you can tell he's really mentally off. He's extremely manic and flighty.
Why are doctors always so damn self righteous when it comes to prescription drugs for anxiety and depression? These drugs were created for a reason! They actually help people! Some people will always have chronic anxiety and depression just as someone who has chronic backpain or arthritis. Give them the drugs they need or shut the fuck up!
Jesus is the  only hope for this world ,he can forgive all your sins .\nMatthew 11:28 Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Revelation 3:20 Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.                                                    only  Jesus can help this  men . for Jesus nothing is impossiblehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHRGh2EiEhMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w39vErgIMMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsMAXhc0Qhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5pZkLWZv-Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga6Qtxzd6vkJohn 3:16 says: For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.Today is your great day the day when God wants to get to your rescue. Recognize that it was impossible for you save on your own. Acknowledge that you lived blind and you were really lost. And above all, believe in the only begotten Son of God so that you do not perish. Celebrate today the victory that God gives you when you repent and leave behind your past. Let there is party today in heaven because your name has been inscribed in the Book of Life. Jesus Christ is knocking on the door of your heart; think no more, open it already. You do not know whether there will be another chance after today because tomorrow may be too late. The time to save is now. God bless you.\n\n                                                                   you will be in my prayer  Aaron  you not alone .. only you need to do is find right way .                                                                                              He is waiting for you with open arms .
Aaron Carter: I don't want to be on drugs (prescribtion drugs)!!\nAaron Carter: There's no WANT TO, I'M GOING TO!\nAaron Carter: I mean what I say! I'm going to do it!! \n\nWhen the audience leave and after the show, Dr.Tavis: Sooo........you're going to rehab right? \nAaron Carter: Well....you'll have to talk to my managers. I have concerts I gotta perform. \n\nHe's full of shit. He's fooling himself and he doesn't even know it.
I love this show! It makes me feel like there is something going on in my life. Although, I'm just sitting in front of a lit box, and the (well paid) people in them don't even know that I exist.
Many people go through this. The greatest battle we have is within ourselves. Having a strong connection to Allah, will help alot.
well for those who say he does drugs he admitted it right there that he will go and obtain these prescription pills off the street. so yes he does legal drugs in an illegal way and needs help. Many people have been there
He's an addict and doesn't have a solution other than the medication his doctors give him to make money.
HE IS ADDICTED TO PENISES
He's a full on junkie.
I really hope he ends up going to rehab. it's so scary.
Aaron Carter man up. Sorry for you but your not ready to help your self.
I wish his problem was the pills but it's not. The pills don't make you skinny. He's doing heroin and if he wants to get clean from heroin he needs 1 or 2 years in rehab.Real rehab  not the expensive resorts in L.A. that want to call themselves rehab centers.
He's fake.  There's always an excuse. He's addicted to pain pills. Point blank period. He's an entertainer and everything out of his mouth is for popularity. He lies about his sexuality to put him out there in the limelight.  He lied when he said he had battled this his white life.  He wasn't like this before, he wasn't a stick figure.  It's so sad that this has happened to him but he needs to go to rehab.  There's a reason why his family wants nothing to do with him.  He's an addict, I have a family member who is also addicted to pain pills. It's rough.
What the heck did Travis put in his face?  He looks like a 40 year old woman!!!
This is heartbreaking...I hope he gets all the help he needs and makes a full recovery..
Lol this loser is high right now off of Oxy.
he's not on a good path...i don't think this show is at all going to help him change. he seems like he's going on a downward spiral
isn't that the book Kevin gave to Nick?
Please pray for him everyone! It's Satan that is trying to make him crazy and he is under spiritual warfare.
the guy is clearly still in the 'lime life' life style he says all the right things but its like... PR PR PR kinda things, hope he gets better. God Bless him
But they dont really tell you what's wrong with him
he went to an amusement park with Micheal Jackson at age 13? you can't write this stuff
Man white people like to cry about stupid stuff
he looks like a fucking meth dealer
Thanks! (I WILL)! ...
Oxy is an appetite suppressant.
He is just saying what people want to hear
He's so mentally ill, it baffles me how he has not been committed yet. I don't believe a word that leaves his mouth he is so delusional , child stardom ruins you . \nI would be surprised if this guy makes it to his 40th birthday
He needs Jesus, he's tried everything but has not tasted how sweet the Lord is!! Give your life to Christ Aaron HE can set you free from Adiction, from homosexuality free from anxiety! I am living proof of this..... John 3:16
Ah fuck off.   He's such a clown
Unfortunately he didn't disclose that he's addicted to Whip-it's (Duster Aersol Cans)
Man if y'all don't give my mans some of that blue dream and let him chill while off the pack he'll be alright
not to interupt you ???? LOL yeah ok
*Hes lying about sept 11*
Smoke a bell SIMPLE

The Firewatch devs gave permission to stream/upload to YouTube to the public. Therefore their DMCA has no legs to stand on, Jim.
Meanwhile Count Dankula maybe facing a year in jail for teaching his Pug how to Hitler Salute...
The cynical undertone in this review is cathartic to bitter old bastards like me.
1. Pewdiepie didn't make jokes about the holocaust, he made jokes about how people are willing to do literally anything for internet fame. Which of course one could argue is rich coming from him, but still - drop the manufactured outrage.\n\n2. The adpocolypse is happening because old media wants to get control of the new media, and control the message there as they already do in print and on TV. They don't give a toss about PDP or terrorism sites. \n\n3. You're correct that the issue of the DMCA claims is separate to the issue of PDP's N-word utterance.
Can you just not fuck it? \nThink I need that on an inspirational poster with a picture of tree on it. Also all the words are different fonts.
I can't agree with your view on PewDiePie's situation.  No, I'm no fan of his.  He's a complete and utter idiot and I'd hate him if I actually gave a crap about him, but the thing is this is merely a symptom of a larger problem in the US (and other english speaking countries, I suppose): the complete lack of understanding of what racism is.\n\nNo, shouting a racial slur when it's not directed to a person of the affected race with the intention of harming is _not racist_.  It's no different from shouting fuck you to someone when you're not actually going to have sex with that person.  That's not what racism consists of.  A person can perfectly be very obviously racist without ever uttering a racial slur and no one will care because people insist on blaming the wrong thing and being afraid of a word like fucking witch hunters.\n\nThis is why I like iDubbbz.  He understands this shit and he's not afraid of words.
So the face of Youtube said the N word on a livestream and those two dickheads made apology videos. Youtube is clearly a sinking ship by this point. Like a ship in a kiddie pool.
African American's literally don't give a fuck....
It seems to be a slip of the tongue
I think TMarTn got more hate than Syndicate did
Here come the pewdiepie fan boys..
Oh no.... YT removing wrong think... darn.... Its almost like there *needs to be* a platform that pays up loaders for views... because patrion isnt a thing.\nThere are other places one can upload videos, people just need to start using them...
Is Jim seriously advocating for regulation of youtube content? Steam Greenlight is one thing, but it would be a detriment for Jim to go against fellow Youtubers. Whether or not you like PewDiePie doesn't mean you can't force him to not freely express in youtube. Jim is a hypocrite
Ok, let's condemn and ban people for saying the bad racist word. Oh, how many rap and black excellence channels would just collapse instantly.\n\nAllowing or banning someone from saying things based solely on skin color is way more racist than any word. \n\nThis video is pretty hypocritical.
C'mon Jim, its not like he said something actually bad like transmisogyny or gamers are dead. Cut him some slack.
One of Jim's unfunny shticks is to look at low-priced Steam releases and then criticize them for not being up to AAA standards. One of these games was The Slaughtering Grounds by Digital Homicide, which Jim shat all over while either lying profusely or just not bothering to do any research. When, unlike other developers, DH didn't take it lying down and uploaded a response video that coined the Jim Fucking Sterling Son meme. Clearly not mad at this, Jim started criticizing all of their games, resulting in hours upon hours of videos where he obsessively talks about them and tries to get his fans to storm their forums, only to then complain when they get banned. Eventually, DH was able to invite Jim to a debate. What ensued was a lot of stuttering and forced laughter in an attempt to stall for time, as Jim started off trying to play his smug internet tough guy persona, only to realize it doesn't work when the person is actually there to respond.
I have noticed recently, when debating whether nazis should get punched, that a lot of people do seem to think nothing you say should matter. That people should be able to say whatever they want without getting fired, banned, boycotted, or punched. That punching someone is far worse than anything a person can say because words don't matter. Except that they do? What you say matters. Marching in the street with fucking tiki torches chanting anti-jew rhetoric matters. Sieg heiling a nazi flag matters.  People want real life to be like the internet where they can shoot their mouths off without consequence. That's not how the world works no matter how much people want to pretend otherwise. They can't go around in the real world saying things with the specific goal of angering and terrifying people and then hide behind It's just a joke, bro. It's just words! It's for the lulz! when those people respond with violence born from the anger and fear these people went to great lengths to create!
If you judge whether people are racist based on their word choice... you're not listening hard enough.\n\nPewdiepie isn't racist, so calling him racist just devalues  the accusation.
Oh please. Liberals would LOVE regulations on Youtube to stop people from saying the naughty things that their fragile feelings can't handle.
Jim, is it not a conflict of interest that you neglected to speak about your own Pogs4Boglins scandal?  Has there been an FTC ruling there?
Thank God for Jim Fucking Sterling Son.
My fist finds these men's faces very tantalizing. So much in fact, it appears my fist has a hard on. Oops, nevermind, that's just my middle finger.
Jim is a fuckin SJW?!? \ngood lord, how many brave critics have fallen under the SJW tyranny?
that's not an ostrich that's an emu
Boy it's a good thing the volatile and grey nature of Youtube is partly held to the whims of a manbaby who can't not be a raging moron for more than a few months.
6:49 I'm pretty sure that's an emu not an ostrich.
Not like the FCC is gonna step in and regulate YouTube. Ajit Pai doesn't have the balls to even attempt it.
devil's advocate: the adults that gamble on these sites are stupid in the first place and doubly stupid if they were convinced by a youtuber to gamble. Now as for the kids, they shouldn't have access to their parent's money to gamble, if they do they have idiots for parents who reap the financial loss they have sown by trusting their kids with credit cards. Not saying what the youtuber's did was right, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for their victims.
Heh, and there I thought your video was good. For mentioning PewDiePie from a left-fascist standpoint you get a thumbs down from me. Ah, I love my freedom to dislike whatever shit I want.
Wowie, look at those dislikes. Maximum jimmie-rustling with this video, Jimmie.
what is his intro song?
Pewdiepie just keeps proving that it's hard to be king.
we don't have the technology. we can't rebult him better and ostrich'er then before
People who make living off YouTube should be purged. pure and simple. Jim you don't seem to exploit YouTube to make a living so your safe
I love iDubbbz.  He says ni**er fa**ot ALL the time and I don't even flinch because I know it's not coming from a place of hate.  He is as transparent as you get and never holds back.   Many Youtubers are NOT transparent and they claim to love and respect every living thing that ever lived ever.  So, if one of them lets a word like n*gger slip out, it gets people thinking about how that person reeeaaallly feels about the things and people around them.  Maybe they aren't being as honest with you as you think.  When something like that happens, you don't actually KNOW where it came from (hate or passion) and that's what makes people uncomfortable.\n\nI wish more people understood this.  It's not the word.  It's the users attitude.  It would break my heart if someone like the Nostalgia Critic was caught on cam using the N word because he always makes it a point to show that he cares about the feelings of others.  iDubbbz never has.  But he's also not hateful.  I don't disagree with Jim about PewDiePie but probably for different reasons.  Jim would probably never be okay with that word being uttered around him.  \n\nAlso the fact that those CS:GO guys got away with that shit it fucked up.
They should have been found guilty they knew what they were doing. It was a cash grab, they're still cunts.
The Internet:  Being a total dickbag and getting called out on it and all of your followers defending you.
The gaming industry is becoming poison and this video expresses many prime examples of why.
Sorry, Jim, but we gotta take the bad with the good. Every time I see YouTube try to shut down channels or censor videos because of content it doesn't like (not illegal or against ToS it just doesn't like it) I get a little more comfortable with the notion of Net Neutrality going away and companies like YouTube having to pay through their fucking nose to keep their monopoly on video content to the ISPs.
I want to scream a huge amen at the free-speech isn't consequence-free bit.  Way too many people forget this.  And it's high time some of these YouTubers started seeing real consequences for their actions -- otherwise it's going to affect the entire community for the worse.
This is a joke, right? You're siding with ProSyndicate and Tmartn as a joke, right?
Now, Youtube drama aside, can a gentleman please answer my inquiry? What are the games featured in this video? They look sort of interesting.
Gotta love Jim Sterling making your instincts scream in agony as he pretends to support scumbags and then letting his defenses down with pewdung
Jim is such a fucking nagger
YAS, JIM! I too believe Youtube should be as regulated as your average cable news network. In fact, I think society should be regulated as well. What we need are shock collars. Anytime you say the word 'fag*ot' or 'nig*er' especially in moments of frustration, you need a little shock. Scratch that. If we wanna get the message across and make sure this toxic language is forever wiped clean from our universe, what we need is a more severe consequence for our 'freedom of expression' (yuck!). Pewdiepie should have his tongue soldered out for impinging his racially-charged rhetoric to those young and impressionable minds. Imagine all the black-identifying children who were watching that livestream, heard him scream that terrible word, and immediately found the nearest ledge to hurl themselves off of like lemmings.
PewDiePIe sympathizers are such scum... I dont even care about the N word thing, the dude is a whiny little child that thinks acting like an amped up 12 year old is funny, people that are fans of this crap are barely a step above the morons that let FRED become popular.
Damn it pewds, stop fucking up. \nPpl are free to mouth off, but no one is obliged to tolerate or enjoy it. I'm sick of some people telling others to shut up and tolerate what disgusts them.
I'm surprised he hasn't torn into Jontron about his whole racial thing if he mentioned Pewdiepie (I know Jim mentioned it on his twitter). Not saying that I agree or disagree with what Jon said, but I do agree with Jim's statement that that the freedom of speech doesn't include the freedom of the consequence of said speech.
Nigga Nigga Nigga oh no im such a bad boy
tmartn didnt even have to hire a lawyer he just told the judges he was sorry while petting his dog. thats why nothing bad happened to him
Here comes the moralizing... If it looks like a church lady, and sounds like a church lady, it's probably Jim F. Sterlingson.\n\nWe get it. N-word: bad \n                  PewDiePie: bad \n                  little boys doing little boy things online: bad\n\nAnd yes, the largest vid-speaker on the prop-box has to set a -golden- (wait, that might be construed as racist) BRONZE standard as the one king to school them all; because the huddled masses are both too stupid to AND have no right to do or think independently, especially at the risk of fee-fees getting hurted. Anything else? Certain Video Nasties you need to censor while you're at it? Any pixelated mammaries in need of surgical reduction? And how soon before one of your acolytes sends \nJohn Anderton with a big ol' blue ball after me because I might (just might!) -vote libertarian- be a racist, bigot, white, homophobe, transphobe etc?
All these people want to get mad over a slur but are completely silent on Anita Sarkesian's support of racial segregation in public schools.
I love Jim videos but god, why did he have to use such disgusting footage ? The game with the giant spider at the start of the video was horrible. Its not even funny, just simply disgusting.
321 of my videos have been marked as not for all advertisers. So thanks pewdiepie for causing me to lose a huge chunk of my income.
If you can't understand the Adpocalypse goes way beyond Pewdiepie and is all about censorship and controlling dissent, what can I say, ignorance is bliss I guess?
Oh ProSyndicate AKA SynHD... I had to explain to my 9yr old niece why SynHD wasnt present in most of CaptainSparklez' Mianite episodes. I had to explain what he did. \nI dont get why Tom felt the need to lie. Greed I guess. But it was and still is extremely disappointing.
Wow, allot of people thing Racial slurs are just Bad words wtf has this world come to.
So you can sarcastically defend people trying to get children hooked on gambling and doing matchfixing, but someone saying a dirty word is a bridge too far for you because you think him saying it might affect your wallet? Have you considered wearing your smelling salts as a necklace for the next time the vapors hit?
1. First part was important as it harm people.\n2, SEcond part was quite stupid. USa tv shows have Black people call each other nigga instead of hello or friend like every 5 seconds, How exactly you expect 99% of the world take white boys whining about racism seriously after that? Ofc he used that word because everyone uses it, Words and their meaning changes, Its not a racial slur anymore,
Did u see how shit the character and the chute looked when parachuting down. No physics in this game😬
Why do you use the same fucking music in every fucking video. There are tons of songs not being cock mongled by copyright but you're insistent on using the same fucking music for every video. It's fucking lazy is what it is.
YouTube Kids (apps) exist, leave my content alone I'm an adult subbing for the content I want to watch, all these content creators censoring themselves and altering their content to make money off their content all because of PewDie-fucking-Pie and the WSJ debacle ruined it for everyone else. If I want to watch content with vulgarity at the age of 21 why should that impact everyone else?? Push the app that does exist and leave my grown up content alone. I'm a fucking adult stop family friendifying my entertainment source and by extension life. As an Australian this means my entire country will be censored soon so quit it YouTube. Cheers cunt.
What a fucking joke: advertisers can put up with scheming gamblers but not with a dude who says the N-word. Come on, Sterling, get a bloody grip.
In PewDiePie's case i really have to condemn issueing DMCA Takedowns against him for that. I'd like to advise you to take a look at YongYea's video about it, but basically: That's ripping down a door you cannot rebuild. Not because of PewDiePie, fuck that overrated piece of shit, but because issuing DMCA-Takedowns for personally not liking someone, is a shady practice. Yes he fucked up, yes he sucks badly, but they DID officially state that streaming their game is fine, and THEN going in to issue strikes against whoever they want whenever they want for any reason they want is simply not okay. You can not give the ok to everyone to use that thing, and then randomly tell certain people it's ok for everyone but them, just because they personally don't like them. Especially when you take in that some of these people do this as their job,  AND he did also ask anybody else who has had a game of theirs streamed by PewDiePie to do the same. So basically, they are trying to ruin a persons entire life because they personally don't like him. \n\nImagine you walk down a street, see a guy and think Oh i don't like that guys face i think i'm going to kill him and everyone is supposed to go Oh yeah but that guy did say something bad at some point in his life, so it's fine. It sends a dangerous signal to the entire industry and that is something we should not let happen, no matter what trash the person in question is.
I can disagree without being persecuted, right?
i totaly aggre with your poinion on pewdiepie but i'm fucking pist that you ended up doing the same thing when you gave that game a 1/10 because of how pist you were
In these comments: A bunch of white guys defend another white guy using a racial slur, yet when a black guy sits quietly during the national anthem (for example) those exact same white guys absolutely lose their shit.
LOL the amount of dislikes
Pewdiepie did nothing wrong.
Samuel Jackson approves
the dislikes are seriously depressing
I disagree.
Delete delete delete in 3 2 1 BOOM!!!!
Are traps naggers?
Invite Destiny 2 plz
Thank you.
Way to be a fucking hypocrite huh?
I feel like this level of sarcasm will still go over the heads of the 'average' American of states person
I hate the SJW movement. I swear a lot, drink, and am generally very relaxed with the use of words others might consider taboo because Im not easily offended. I like pewdiepie. I liked watching his content and have loved his new pubg streams, because Im a fan of shooters. But Im not making excuses. Some people may crusade that the nword is a taboo and all taboos must be erased, but the truth is just because a few people can be okay with something doesnt give you the go ahead to drop words without thinking in front of a crowd. Sometimes you can hurt others, and people are going to lash back in that scenario. People who want to do the right thing are given gas to the flame when you act this way. And I think its a shame he did it. I think its a shame that Im not surprised.
So we can just pick and choose who can and can't use racial slurs now. Idubbbz can say it all the time and even h3 has said it from time to time but everyone was okay with it because we knew it wasn't them trying to be racist. But when pewdiepie lets it slip out and apoligizes for it, he is guilty and is a racist?
Jim, I think you need to be clear on whether you believe the Firewatch dev is abusing DMCA or not. It's starting to look like your contempt for PewDiePie is holding precedent over something that is a potentially larger issue. If they were to get away with it, what's stopping other devs from copyright striking other let's players that they dislike for completely unrelated reasons to the actual let's play?\n\nThe firewatch devs gave streamers permission to make videos of their games and the dev even admitted that PewDiePie's videos likely helped make him money.
Sorry Jim, you had me till 8:30, then you ripped on a guy using a word. One word? Those other fools IMO are guilty of crimes sure but Pewdiepie? We have all said worse. Anyway keep up the good work mate.
This is probably the worst episode of JQ ever. Lets hope the show does not keep degrading in quality
Yep lets just throw Pewdiepie under the bus for being *purposefully* taken out of context by a group of so-called journalists, and again for using a word which is actually *too* common in many highly-competitive multiplayer games. Obviously he's the one who didn't do his journalistic research on actually understanding the context of events, and obviously he was the one to turn competitive multiplayer games into an insult acid bath. Oh wait no, he just said a word he shouldn't have, apologized for it, and then was falsely struck with a copyright strike by a begrudged developer of a boring walking simulator game he played over 2 years ago.\n\nAlso the adpocalypse was not Pewd's fault, it was the fault of YouTube overreacting to news coverage of a Coke Cola advertisment being on a terrorist propaganda video. YouTube now has an AI which uses algorithms to automatically demonetize videos based on their titles, and to a *shadier* extent, the content creator.\n\nIf you seriously think YouTube hasn't been actively gutting itself over the past 2 years you are rather oblivious.
https://i2.wp.com/theralphretort.com/wp-content/uploads/JIM1.jpg\n\nhttps://i1.wp.com/theralphretort.com/wp-content/uploads/jimmmmmmm.jpg\n\nJust to remind Jim Sterling he too is one of these boys.
I agree with you bagging on PDP, but I feel you also need to take a harder look at the Vanaman reaction.\n\nPDP was a dick, unquestionably, he said something idiotic in the moment and should get a lot of flak for that. He's a huge role model and the face of youtube. He has much more responsibility than he'd like and people are now holding him up to that, so I suppose he'd better cry himself to sleep in his millions and then (at the risk of misogyny) MAN THE FK UP!!.\n\nThis Vanaman characters response is disproportionate, vindictive, mean spirited, incredibly divisive and with the intention of destroying another persons livelihood. Why didn't he just say that he didn't approve/demand an apology/ request that PDP take down videos featuring his content/ suggest a large charity donation or all of the above reasonable and rational reactions. Be the bigger (dammit) VanaMAN.\n\nTheirs far too many nasty fks using 'morality' as a shield and they need to be called out on their bullshit.
do words or actions make a person racist?
Pewdiepie is a liablity\n\nJim Pewds is bigger than 90% of gaming channels on youtube combined face it hes is the fucking face of youtube for a reason. If he goes down so does a significant part of youtubr
I don't think what Pewds said is excusable, but I also don't think it's fair to say he has to worrie about other people's channels just because he happens to be the top youtuber, it's not his responsibility\nBesides am surprised how Jim spended so little time on the Dmca takedown claim, this is a creator that took down a video, without reason, admiting that the only reason was because he didn't like pewdiepie, it's a complete abuse of the law, expecially considering that he had previously given consent for streamers and gameplay.. You would think someone like Jim, that had to deal with this shit in the past, would criticize the creator for abusing this sort of copyright strikes
I have to disagree with the notion that Pewdiepie should be held accountable for the Adpocalypse, because what dumb shit he says reflects on his character and his brand, not Youtube's.  At least, it really shouldn't. \nInstead of pushing these vague advertiser friendly guidelines onto everyone and having bots aggressively stripping people's income away with no feedback whatsoever, Youtube needs to set rigid, clear guidelines for what is and is not acceptable on this website.  No one else has the power to do that but Youtube.  If you break these guidelines, then you put your own channel at risk, up to Youtube's discretion.\nThe reason Youtube even went in the awful direction it did was because the charlatans at the WSJ wrote article after article debasing Youtube's public image based off of claims taken out of the original context and warped to become a message that isn't accurate in the slightest.  Youtube made the executive decision to punish everyone and kneel to these ridiculous accusations, instead of defending the free speech and independent nature of its content creators.\nI don't defend hateful or extreme content behind hosted on this website, but Youtube can't remain laissez-faire about what gets uploaded while preemptively demonetizing hard working users because some bot that can't understand context thought their video was hateful.
someone said a single word and because they said that word they are evil racist filth.
PewdiePie has nothing to do with Tmartin and the other twat. Yes it's absurd those two got away with their little gambling scheme. But PewdiePie saying some racial slur and being blamed for the collapse of youtube in whatever form is frankly absurd. It's his responsibility to represent himself, not everyone else who might some day hope to make some money off youtube. And Jim you are being a hypocrite here. You go around making episodes where you pretend to have sex with some plastic chips or whatever, swing around some giant purple dildo, tape cereal to your face and do god knows what, to name a few. You're not exactly mainstream family-friendly advertising material, either. You may think that's not nearly as bad as saying the oh-so-naughty n-word, but frankly that's subjective and irrelevant. Only reason you are not in the same crosshairs is because, yes, you don't have the same audience size as someone like PewdiePie, or simply because some MSM outlet hasn't found you and decided to make you its focus on the depravities of the internet or whatever other bullshit.
I hate white people to, jim
Fucking niggers.
imagine taking the f word literally every time someone said it
Humans are really weird. Worship men who are greedy and narcissistic! Losers sub to these plp!
Holy shit...what's with the downvotes? Pewds fans?
I haven't looked in the comments, but I already know that it's gonna be just full of guys defending some dude they don't know, and acting like sucking a stranger's dick for no reason is the ~ *edgy and hardcore* ~ thing to do. ;3
Sure blame, PewDiePIe, and not YOUTUBE AND GOOGLE.
Go Pewds! Fuck the haters!
Congrats bro!!

I never watched a vlog and a more than 10 min video and I Completely watched this thing straight without checking the time. Holy sh*t I never knew it was even 15 mins I thought it was like 7 mins
I was shukt by this vlog
Hey Wil! I subscribed to you when you were ~670,000 subs. How I wish I had seen your vlogs back then. I don't watch TFC as much as my wife, but I have the abs-cbn news app on my phone - and that's how I stumbled upon an article about you and your battle with 'C'. I just want to thank you for being a positive influence not only for me, but my whole family. I'm now determined to get my masters done and I'm always playing motivational videos (the one where you, Daniel and Jacko were in Guam and you guys had telepathic wave lengths going) for my boys to continue making sacrifices for what they want. I can relate to you my brother - my US Navy Dad retired and thrust me into a school in Manila - and I didn't know a lick of Tagalog. (I went to school the same school where Alodia graduated college from). I thank my parents every day for their decision to retire in the Phil. I LOVE the Philippines! God Bless Wil - we are praying the rosary every night and include you in our prayers!! You will overcome this!
i had another suggestion in mind but its kinda...you know since ...
it's frozen..?  we could probably expect some Elsa in the future?  Elsa Dasovich.   :)\n\ni'm just kidding. i hope i didn't offend you.\ni hope you get stronger everyday.
Pudra is the best!!! 😂😂

Isaac melts my heart. The way he goes hi mummy as soon as Lindy steps into his bedroom 😭
It's so great that you are opening a bank account for Ayla. I really wished my parents did that for me at some point when I was younger (but its only a false wish since my parents were immigrants and didnt know a lot about how a lot of things worked...)
My little brother loves paw patrol too and he's about to be 5. It's late at night but in the morning I'll show him this and see what he says about seeing Paw Patrol live lol. I love your vlogs! ❤
I stop by every 3-4 months and get soooo excited to see how big Issac is getting!
He is the cutest baby ever 💛💛💛
I remember you from 5 years ago wow! I remember your brother saying stare into my eyes your balls will be paralysed hahaha :/
So close to a million!
Issac's speech has gotten so much better. It's so sweet to watch him grow up <3
Enjoyed Tim doing a bit of vlogging~
Judging by Isaac's reaction (or lack thereof) I'd say no it wasnt worth it.
almost 1 mil bubz! I've been here for years and still going on strong!
Such a sweet family
Wow you live in NI? I realised your accent. I'm Cantonese and Vietnamese. Usually go to the arena for the Belfast Giants Games. Your kid is so cute. Great to see locals 😊
That moment when he says...on tv\nLol
Worth paying double full price for paw patrol for Isaac to see it!
Wow bubz you're sooo close to 1 mill subscribers! Seems like you'll get there by your next video!! Yaayy!!
When are you guys going to do a new intro with Ayla? ☺
aww bubz, i am so tired with my pregnancy, i am 3 months with my first born and thank god i have been watching you since your pregnancy with isaac. I suffered hyperemesis for 2 months and rejected taking Plasil. i lost a lot of weight and i am so concerned with my baby. but the doc says its healthy. i am just concern my weight is still dropping i still cannot eat. i am very much dehydrated my lips were chapped and dry. water didnt taste good so i sometimes drink electrolyte water to replenish me. but with all these struggles i am looking forward to finally meet my firstborn! godbless and love much mommah bubz!
Issac means laughter. May he grow full of joy and laughter.
Was it worth it? Lemme work it. I put my thang down flip it and reverse it
I love your shooting stance, it's very serious. 🤣
Are you going to create a new intro to your videos ? 🙂❤
The things we do for kids! :D Should have just bought a dvd LOL
Tim actually hit one of the markers
Damn, what a bad turn out o.O \n\nWe had booked to take my nephew to see that in August at Manchester Arena and due to the closure of the arena a new venue was found but it was a month earlier and original tickets weren't valid for the new venue so we just got the refund and saved ourselves the hassle of rearranging days off.
'If u smile I'll give you popcorn'Hey u cant bribe me like that >:3
I love your vlogs big much!! ❤️
Omg! Issac is talking a lot lately!!! He is so adorable <3
Ive never seen a cuter smile in my life
Wow you saw Busted? before they disbanded and Matt started his own venture? and then the other guy started his own venture? and now i have no idea where they are...
Lmao Tim's face had me cracking up 😂😂😂
Tim face is so funny..haha
Bubz, I love your vlogs. it brings me joy seeing you guys. ^^\n\nbtw, I noticed that there were spams of nasty comments and inappropriate links. So please report it when you guys see it. I've tried to report as many as i can. I don't want the kids on youtube who watches bubz's videos to see it. So horrible..
I realize, my parents may have taken a more extreme route for me because my first concert was the KISS reunion tour in 2000. I was five years old XD
Where the fuck was Ayla?.... good video tho lol
Ahhh Paw Patrol!! My younger brother is like 9 months older than Isaac and LOVES Paw Patrol. He has so many books and he makes me read them every day.
BUBZ WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE A NEW INTRO FOR YOUR VIDEOS
My wee sister loved paw patrol live. My mum's sister talked mum into taking my sister and our cousin. It cost them an arm and a leg.
That is the same living room where you used to make those funny comedies
Tim watching paw patrol is how I feel when I am at school.
Remember seeing busted at the odyssey too 😂
Please check out my friends up and coming beauty YouTube channel --> https://youtu.be/AsTmcXNWUwk
Aw, this reminded me of when I was 4 and my mom was SO excited to take me to a LIVE Barney show. But she accidently took me the weekend after it happened, so I never got to see it :( At least she tried!
I was watching some of your old vlogs and I remembered how Tim was really fond of Despicable Me! Think it would be a good idea if you let Isaac watch it, I'm sure he will enjoy it ☺️👍🏻
Loving that new song of JB -Friends 💜
My three year old Girl loves Paw Patrol too. Love from Tassie, Australia.
I took my boys to see Paw Patrol live as well. They loved it. Lol\nMy oldest son (4) has a paw patrol bed
TIME FOR A NEW INTRO
I was just watching sacconejoly channel, they will be at a meetup in Belfast in Nov. Would be cool if you could meetup with them.
Wasn't full price about £65 each regardless of age? We almost gifted our nephew but decided the money could go further!
Lindsy well done you are 18 on trending and I just wanted to say I love watching Isaac grow up it is so cute and thank you for posting about your life!
Ricky !!!! Omg, now im gonna go see what he's been up to on he's channel lol . I MISSED him ! I knew my eyes weren't playing tricks on me haha .
lol Issac and Tim have the same expression when watching the paw patrol show, like father like son. It always fun watching you guys!!! Love you guys!! <3
Hi Bubz! I have watched you since before you were married and I am basically committed to watching your videos still, I love it so much! I'm sure you guys know what you're doing but due to my own past experiences i sort of became worried for Lala because my mom tried her best not to neglect my older brother and instead she neglected me. even giving me to my grandma really did some damage to me because i didn't know what a mother's love was supposed to be like growing up. Again, i think you guys know what you're doing and i only see glimpses of what goes on, through your videos. But please don't let ayla be removed from your presence for too long or she could feel disconnected with you, as to this day (been praying for God to restore my family) i have felt disconnected with my own family. please do keep me in prayer as well as you can see i need it, haha. anyway, it was a small worry, but i'm sure you guys know what you're doing, and i'm sorry if this came off the wrong way. God bless you and your beautiful family!!! Love youuu!! <3
lol! Isaac was obviously unimpressed throughout the Paw Patrol show. haha...
You guys made my day 💝 may I know what's in your lips at 2:24? It's looks so natural and fresh. You are glowing from deep within 😘. Lot's of love from the Arab Emirates 💐💐💐
The most beautiful family in the globe!
Bubz I think you've scarred Issac 😂 paw pawtrol will never be the same
Hey Bubz, what color of lip tint from Em Cosmetics did you use? Love you and Ng fam!
Issac is talking so much now!!! LOVE YOUR FAMILY!!!
Rickhe with the violin dancing was the best belly laugh I've had all day lol
Isaac is so big now! I guess It's been a while since I last saw a vlog of you. The way he puts on his cap is so cute!!! 😍
Isaac is growing up so fast! ☺️
Isaac has gotten really good with his speaking, I'm happy to see his improvement. (^-^)
I know now not to take my kid to see Paw Patrol when I have one haha XD
aw! Isaac is so sweet hi mommy ... miss Ayla on this blog : |
You guys are one of my most favorite family in Youtube. You guys are so genuine, humble & did not change despite having many followers. Wishing your family all the happiness & good health!
He is getting so big
Issac is such a sweet boy!! I enjoyed your vlog as always thanks!!
oh my god the last shot where his eyes roll
Isaac is getting so big now woah!
I thought you were saying papa troll. I was like what is papa troll.... Lol
if you've gone through all the paw patrol episodes you should watch rescue bots. It's my nephew's new obsession after paw patrol.
now I want to try that shooting toy XD
Hahaha Isaac's facial expressions at the end😂
it's amazing to see how far Isaac's speech has come along, i'm so proud of him ❤️ you're such a beautiful family
So nice seeing how Isaac has grown! My nephew loves Paw Patrol too. And you have a baby girl! God bless your family Bubz
I feel so sad that those people have to perform in a nearly empty room :(
Bubz you seemed more excited than isaac to see paw patrol :D
Is anyone else seeing all these pornographic comments under the video? Wtf i reported as many as i could but there are a lot if them...
Where is domo and chubby?
on tv :') AHAHAHAHAAAAAAA
Isaac makes me smile Big Much! 😀😀😀♥♥
aw isaacs smile !!he's so cute !
paw patrol sounds like papa troll
Even though paw patrol was... *cough* shit..😂😂😂
Isaac looks like ricky.
No Lala? :(
so cute :-:
Isaac you too cute gah!
so close to 1M bubz!! wooo
Hello Bubz Fam💗
Addicted to your vlogs, so relaxing :)
Lol this is 17 on trending
New intro? Please?
Uncle Rickeh is ruthless.  :)
omgdays that cute smile XD you bribed your son!!! XD
I love love your bath tub !!
Ricky is attractive
I've been hearing people say Paw Patrol for so long and just realized that it isn't Papa Troll.
Unscripted for me. Monthly or bi-weekly vlog. Basically Last Month or Last Fortnight. Releases from the hideous obligation of weekly shit but we still get _somethin'_ . Please do this
14:50 i'm gonna put it in my puuuuusssysyyyyyyyy
Why does tom have black eyes?
around 6:30 when he said Chicky Chicky my mind went Steal a chip
Tom is my spirit animal
0:00 Rare footage of tsar bomba exploding in the Arctic ocean.
He's chubby!
Oh my GAWD Thomas, stop calling Charlie Elliot. Dats not vewy nice.
Hi :)
I would love a podcast!
great weight gaining...looking fat and sexy big bear
Who remembers edd 😰
I would love a podcast. I sometimes find it hard to watch last week so i end up listening to a podcast. I just love the raw input of thoughts and hearing peoples beliefs
Monthly sounds good.\n8:04 Of course that's your interpretation for jesus.
That thing about soulmates bit so close to home wow. I never thought about it like that but the most toxic friendships I've ever had have felt like the most incredible at the time. I wouldve called them my soul mate. Wow Tom wow.
Make last month then every 12 months make last year
You literally remind me of my best friend Logan, and that's such a beautiful thing to me 😂 we just need more people like you both
I like the idea of a last month maybe? I think that's been suggested before and I reckon its a great idea
Podcast is good do it on a saturday then more people could watch it *dont script it* and make sure eddie and elliot is in it
I would enjoy a last week podcast.
8:32 there is a man drinking directly from the bottle not giving a shut while Tom is walking
Tom we still have ice cream tacos in the US. I feel like you've missed a lot of opportunities for that
hey tom i like ur stuff and everytime im sad i watch ur stuff\n\njus wanted u to know this\n\nok bye
8:50\n\nI need that shirt.\n\nWhere can I get it?! I need that shirt!!!
holy shit you should so  a sitcom!!!
Definitely a podcast anyway, its pretty much the perfect thing to fill the void and (depending on how you do it, for example audio only) that would fix that subsection of the comments that obsess over your weight. \n\nIf you wanted to do something scripted you could even just release the weekly sketches from reddit on occasion. It could even solidify this channel as the personal with the fans one, in a way, and it would be super entertaining as it's own thing too
every month you could release a vlog for the month. except each day only has one minute. could be in the style of 8:27 to 8:38 sometimes\n\nedit: and 13:42 to 13:58
And where did you found him?????
They call him Matthew Christ 8:05
Holy shit I am the exact same build as Tomska 😂😂
4:20... Fav moment... and Fav Time Card... (I Rounded it Down to make this comment funny... My *Actual* Fav moment is at closer to 4:21)
I'd love a podcast, just dont have a completely scripted one.  Just talk about whatever you guys like, same as in the vlogs
Why don't you have weekly videos of you opening mail and the submitted sketches, you can spend way more time on it
Wow. Someone who hates Jesus more than Jehovah's Witnesses do
Are your parents back together?
I'm really sorry about this but you use to be so skinny man...
Just do Last Week. You lazy ************* ;)
I'm sick of watching and listening to privileged cunts
this is my first time watching your videos, you come across as like a really nice down to earth guy. I kinda like these simple/quick kinda vlogs
Originally, I was on board with the podcast idea, but, after reflecting on what I personally like about Last Week, I found that I most enjoy the quick succession of entertaining cuts to random events or comments that happen throughout the day. A podcast would have its moments, but I feel that the entertainment value of the visual jokes and the (probably previously-thought-out) cuts to Tom & Co.'s random quips every now and then give Last Week a unique, funny feel, that I don't personally find in many other vlog series, wouldn't be there in a podcast. Personally, I think, as a replacement for Last Week, you should do a bi-weekly or monthly vlog series. I don't want to lose that feel I get from this series or the excitement I have when I see a new upload that just won't be present with a static, talky podcast.\n\nI commend you for making it to the end of this wall of text, and I hope others agree with me. Thanks, Tom, (& friends) for making a super entertaining, awesome series that is definitely one of the highlights of my week.
Tbh, I would love to see more you improving skits in public
13:20 When two of my 'soul type' get together it pretty much is a simplified enactment of weirdmageddon, were it is just a feed back loop of weirdness and slightly creepy laughter that takes over any space its in and it just becomes a cacophony of the unusual, and unstable.
podcast is fun, but you need to have guests to come on, like charlie or sammy. cause I watch this to see how your week was and I love the cameos of your friends.
Your footage from Florence gave me huge flashbacks from when I was there two years ago for one of the best holidays I've ever had. I've been in and loved these streets! Dang I need to travel more.\nBut your recreated sketch in Pisa was so freaking funny my man
I'm not too sure about the podcast idea to be honest.
Lie to me yessss so good
14:46 the thiccest \nI love you tom
No, Jesus found you
OMG at the leaning tower part I didn't know I could wheeze laughing that hard. I might have developed asthma but worth it. Probably. I'll send you the doctor's bill. Cause I'm American. FML
You should do a Squidge Vlog where Elliot plays the voice of Squidge. Pls. Pls do dat. Dat would be vewy nice.
A podcast sounds awesome Tom, I'd really like to hear your views on things going on in the world :)
the university of ... they're here...
Noooooo ! I want last week to be forever. I just started watching these :(  cruel.
Cool now we have a preview of The Complete History of Me (3/3)
do the podcast and then maybe keep doing last week sketches??
Podcasting would be great but i feel as if monthly vlogging would be better but with more effort. i like both really but your content is your content. you can do what you want
What about a more behind the scenes look of how a sketch/anything you make evolves from start to finish? (including the many creative breaks you, Elliot and Eddie take) :D
The podcast idea sounds like it would be good, but whatever you choose to do, Tom, I and many other fans probably, implore you to not replace it with something scripted. The insight of naturality of your life that Last Week gives can't even hope to be replaced with anything less than your reality.
Charlie is so beautiful x
Pretentious Monthly Scrapbook or weekly 30min-1hour podcast.\nI'd say Podcast is best. You, Eddie, Elliot (possibly Charlie) can host and just bring friends like Chloe, Sammy or Jack Howard in to guest. Talk about a certain topic or just about anything that's new for you all. It could be a chance to promote your friends upcoming work too!
What happened to last week I fled the country
I really enjoy the vlogs so I'd be happy with a monthly vlog or something similar 😊
Last week...TOM WENT SWIMMING AND MADE GOAT NOISES THE END
Twas preeetty gud. On a side note i think squidge may like elliot more than you
i love the podcast idea and the like the concept of a monthly scrapbook. although, something scripted sounds interesting, doing a david dobrik kind of scripted vid per week/month would be entertaining for all imo
I think a compilation of you imitating statues would be perfect to fill the void.
0:42 It evolves to a dildo!
Definitely not scripted but I'd still like to watch the Reddit skits and a monthly vlog sounds cool, especially if it's called pretentious monthly scrapbook
Last year i met someone who had a very similar soul to me and had a big impact on my life. We went to our first gig together and the friendship just grew toxic cause we were jealous of each other hanging out with other people and doing things with out the other. Not sure how your friendship grew toxic tomska. But i guess thats just part of life today this person has influenced me in such a big way and all you can do is be happy for all the things you enjoy which they introduced you to :)

Not so little Stevie CAN SEE NOW.  Because he sez, if you Be Blind if you done believe Dat  Global Warming dont't be for real for real.  Did little Stevie acquire a Lisp? OR an love relationship affinity for men?
What is more likely? A relatively small group of eco activists are using their limited funds in a massive global conspiracy involving 97% of climate scientists to damage the economy in order to do something OR oil companies and such are using their obscene profits to bribe whoever they can in an attempt to avoid responsibility for any consequences their environmental activities will have?
Wow, what a worldly definition of love. Pure evil. Soli Deo Gloria!
The sky is falling!!The sky is falling!!!! @James Brown INCREASE in storms...Not so http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user230519/imageroot/2017/09/12/2017.09.12%20-%20Hurricanes.jpg there was more hurricanes and tropical storms in the 1800's!
Climate change deniers are either blind or ignorant So Stevie is admitting to being a climate change denier?
Yeah, Stevie, you were always blind, seeming pretty unintelligent yourself right now insulting people that don't have your liberal, muh feelin's views. Yet another platform for all of us to hear celebrity politics that don't matter right now. Watch Jerry Lewis years of telethons to raise money, and see how it's done. Just shut up and sing.
Ok, stevie wonder calling out global warming is like Marlee Matlin calling out noise pollution....REALLY? great musician, but drank the liberal cool aid...you moron! Stick to music or give a sollution!...does ANYONE have a sollution for global warming while these celebs' are flying around in their carbon emitting private jets, heating their multi-million dollar mansions and driving around in carbon dioxide spewing limos...oohh the hypocrocy! At least these idiots are good for a laugh... No wonder President Trump will win in 2020, these idiot celebrities are chasing people into his arms...MAGA!
WHAT STEVIE IS TRYING TO SAY IS HE DOESNT BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING
So Stevie Wonder said that blind people don't believe in climate change because the blind and unintelligent can't see it. Oh well Stevie why are you talking.
The hypocrisy is almost sickening. I'm sure Stevie enjoyed his plane ride home on his private jet. It seems this global warming thing only applies to us little people.
What a cringe fest! Nothing but a gigantic photo op for these self indulgent, sanctimonious assholes. The country will do just fine without your cringy mugs all over our tv screens. Keep your worthless talents and stay out of our homes. You degenerate scumbags wouldn't know charity if it kicked you in the ass.
It's a charity event, not a political rally. He was out of line.  At the very least, if you're trying to raise money, you don't insult those who MIGHT donate, duh!   Yes, I think climate change deniers are unintelligent, I agree w/ Stevie, but I certainly wouldn't say that if I was trying to raise money for a cause.  And on a tangent, his little Xian prayer could be seen as insensitive to non Xians and Nones.  He's a hypocrite.
LOL I did think it was funny and ironic... of course Stevie was trying to tell people that HE don't believe in Climate Change lol\nREPLY
Aw man...  I used to have so much love for Stevie until I saw this speech... Blind and unintelligent.
Praise the Prius! Halleluyah! Repent, you heretics who do not believe in the Doctrine of Man Caused Global Warming! The End is Near!
Hey celebrity assholes, what's your carbon foot print?
Only an idiot would believe celebrity propaganda.
and when did Stevie see the data?
If you don't believe in climate change you must be blind or unintelligent...\n\nI guess Stevie isn't a believer!
I love the scroll America's Got Talent will air immediately after this program. Especially during Stevie Wonder and Beyonce's rant. ROTFLMAO
stevie is so in your face! bless you man ! i applaud Stevie with his message here's a disciple of Mr. Wonder tribute to this genius Cause we've ended as lovers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h12kms2ceRo
I totally agree Stevie! So global warming isn't a thing? Well keep doing what your doing dont change and then dont complain when we see more hurricanes or worse! Then we will have another benefit concert for maybe you or a family member or friend of yours hat was effected by it. Thats right .. Just keep doing what your doing. Stay ignorant. But at the end of the day we get what we deserve with how we treat each other and our planet
DJ KHALED ALERT!!!!!!!!!!\nAs I was watching this telethon last night the camera man showed DJ KHALED multiples of times with that red jacket on looking like THE KOOL-AID MAN and each time he was taking a phone call.  For some reason I had a vision for a minute of DJ KHALED saying \n PLEASE CALL 1-800-258-6000 BECAUSE WE THE BEST HAND IN HAND TELETHON \n(laughing) I bet he would have said that shit right then and there!!!
The group with the largest carbon footprint in the Universe is lecturing us on denial.
Let Stevie Wonder be an inspiration to us all, by stopping his touring and private jets, and huge resource sucking homes.
I want to know how much each of these super rich Hollywood libturds are giving to the hurricane victims.
Preaches love and then spews hate. Has been trying to hold on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gRAMAU7swM&t=16s
That's why I'm donating directly to charities.
I believe in channel change
I believe in climate change. I believe it's been around for billions of years, and not just the last 20.
Stevie has never seen a Republican that he didn't hate.
All you climate change deniers are Stupid FOOLS!
love you stevie wonder!!!  TY for standing up for scientific studies of climate change & pollution. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=global+warming+hurricanes&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C22&as_vis=1&as_ylo=2012&as_yhi=\n\nAmerican Meteorological Society: Climate Change: An Information Statement of the American Meteorological Society\n\nIt is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide.” (August 2012)\n\nAmerican Physical Society: Statement on Earth’s Changing Climate:\n\nWhile natural sources of climate variability are significant, multiple lines of evidence indicate that human influences have had an increasingly dominant effect on global climate warming observed since the mid-twentieth century. Although the magnitudes of future effects are uncertain, human influences on the climate are growing. (November 2015)\n\nAmerican Geophysical Union: Statement on climate: “Human-induced climate change requires urgent action.”\n\nExtensive, independent observations confirm the reality of global warming. These observations show large-scale increases in air and sea temperatures, sea level, and atmospheric water vapor; they document decreases in the extent of mountain glaciers, snow cover, permafrost, and Arctic sea ice. These changes are broadly consistent with long-understood physics and predictions of how the climate system is expected to respond to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases. The changes are inconsistent with explanations of climate change that rely on known natural influences.”\n\n (Adopted December 2003, Revised and Reaffirmed December 2007, February 2012, August 2013)\n\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science: AAAS Board Statement on Climate Change\n\nThe vast preponderance of evidence, based on years of research conducted by a wide array of different investigators at many institutions, clearly indicates that global climate change is real, it is caused largely by human activities, and the need to take action is urgent. (December 2006, Reaffirmed December 2009)\n\nGeological Society of America: Position statement on climate change\n\nScientific advances have greatly reduced previous uncertainties about recent global warming. Ground-station measurements have shown a warming trend of ~0.85 °C since 1880, a trend consistent with (1) retreat of northern hemisphere snow and Arctic sea ice; (2) greater heat storage in the ocean; (3) retreat of most mountain glaciers; (4) an ongoing rise in global sea level; and (5) proxy reconstructions of temperature change over past centuries from archives that include ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments, boreholes, cave deposits, and corals. (October 2006; revised April 2010, March 2013, April 2015).\n\nAmerican Chemical Society: Statement on Global Climate Change\n\nThere is now general agreement among scientific experts that the recent warming trend is real (and particularly strong within the past 20 years), that most of the observed warming is likely due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and that climate change could have serious adverse effects by the end of this century. (July 2004)\n\nU.S. National Academy of Sciences: Understanding and Responding to Climate Change \n\nThe scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to begin taking steps to prepare for climate change and to slow it. (2008)\n\nInternational academies: Joint science academies’ statement: Global response to climate change\n\nClimate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However, there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. (2005, 11 national academies of science)\n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2014.  Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers\n\n“Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of green-house gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.”\n\n“Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.”\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program, 2014. Highlights of Climate Change Impacts in the United States: The Third National Climate Assessment.\n\n“Over recent decades, climate science has advanced significantly. Increased scrutiny has led to increased certainty that we are now seeing impacts associated with human-induced climate change. With each passing year, the accumulating evidence further expands our understanding and extends the record of observed trends in temperature, precipitation, sea level, ice mass, and many other variables recorded by a variety of measuring systems and analyzed by independent research groups from around the world.” (thanks @pixilateddream for this!)
What a joke! How about a debate instead of demonizing people! These celebrities no nothing and they're all hypocrites!\nhttps://youtu.be/TCy_UOjEir0
Guess I'm not listening to Stevie anymore. Brainwashed imbecile. Stick to music.
University of Miami President Julio Frenk, when speaking on the 8.1 earthquake in Mexico, tied it into climate change. When we deny climate change and all of that, and refuse to take action, we are affecting these poor people, he said, referring to the victims in Mexico.\n\nClearly climate change, the evidence is undebatable! — survivor of 8.5-9.0 quake (estimate) that destroyed Lisbon in 1755.
just sing Stevie.  What an opportunist to come out and say people are unintelligent if they don't agree with you….
He is blinded by ignorance.
#truth
He's not mocking anyone. His words are crystal clear.
This was the saddest sight I've ever heard .
Just described himself blind and stupid
We're gathered here today to raise money for the Clinton global initiative to which will pay off the Haiti ponzi scheme
poor Stevie, everytime he opens his mouth to tell everyone to open their hearts and eyes, he gets into trouble. i hear even some pastor is after his neck. sounds familiar? the last time a popular man opened his mouth to tell us things we didn't want to hear, he got crucified ;)
Global warming...is a political persuasion. I'm not ignorant. God warns of judgement. This is just another money maker for democrats...just like abortion.
blessed are the blind who still can see !
this jerk is one wonder of a left wing stooge
He gets to try to shame people who are not drinking the communist koolaid!
Did he say they must be blind or unintelligent?! Oh mine!!!! Really!!!???!!!?
Stevie Wonder must be blind if he believes in man made global warming.Oh yeah,he is.
That's nice Stevie, now go back into your bottle of formadahyde
Have you ever seen Stevie wonder wife? \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you you haven't either has Stevie wonder seen her.
You must be blind to say dumb shit like that, stick with your music dummy !
Well, little Stevie I must be blind and dumb then. So I'm gonna trot right down and sign up for me some disability checks. Fuck this working 50 or 60 hours a week just to pay too much in taxes.
Blind or unintelligent? When's the last time this guy looked into the mirror? Oops!
All combined, these celebs put more up their nose each month than they raised with this telethon.
Way to go Stevie... Everyone knows that the BEST way to maximize donations coming in to your little fund raiser is to call a majority of would be donors stupid.... I guess he can't SEE the irony....
Blind in more ways than one.
These fucking ELITES don't give a fuck about the people of Harvey and Irma, they're raising money for the DNC!!!
Another dirtbag liberal running to have a benefit si they can spew their leftist politics. Shove your benefit up your ass turd mongers
Hey celebrity assholes, did you give a million dollars like Trump?
Someone tell that dumb nigger there were more hurricanes in 1988 even one that was bigger than Irma....dont take cheap shots at the president steve
Anyone who thinks a hurricane is climate must be blind or unintelligent.
If he wasn't blinded by stupidity he'd open his eyes and see that weather happens.
Your a fool that cant see the truth and you have the audacity to lecture others who can, pity on you
geo engineering !!! NOT climate change you idiots. \nwatch - O.D.D. Watching Geongineering ~ Worldwide Ground Based (WSAC) Weather Makers
Another Liberal Loon
Liberal sodomite scumbag will burn in hell
thank you marytyhitvan
Stay blind you blind bastard
The people in this country that sit back and roll their eyes at scientist telling them that Climate change is real and don't believe them scare me. Yes Irma was not the strongest Hurricane and She may not even be a product of Climate Change, but Climate change IS real and the fact that you refuse to do anything about it and vote for people who also refuse to do anything about it is why we'll all get to say TOLD YOU SO when it all hits the fan in 50 years. Besides that, I seriously don't understand why it matters? Why if you don't believe in climate change would you not want to just say Hey, this is probably not true, but we only get one planet to live on so maybe we should try to take care of it, You know...JUST IN CASE!
Stevie Wonder revealed that he is part of the antichrist new world order and the last stand of rebellious man against a holy, Almighty God! Their end is eternal damnation. Read Revelation 19:11-16; 21:8, 27; 22:14-15 etc. Ready or not - Jesus is coming. safeguardyoursoul.com
never seen any of these losers in Texas well the blind nigger gets a pass we got enough of them besides I think all the air Jordan shoes are gone now
Love, love, love, but hey, fuck Trump
so we are supposed to listen to a blind nigger fuck you O YA he can't read this lol hahhhhhhhhhhaaaa
To this day, I still dream about Sydney Fish Market and am so excited to go back! (beware those darn ibises though.. Aussies know what I'm talking about) Stay tuned for parts 2 & 3 of Worth It Oz - what country should we visit next? \n\n#BuzzFeedWorthIt
You guys should have come to New Zealand and so you could have some real seafood.
Does anybody else cringe at the way they say Melbourne and Brisbane! 😖
You guys really should have gone to Queensland. BEST SEAFOOD EVER!
Brisbain\nMelbern\n\nI'm sorry but that is not how you pronounce it
this is a jewish funded, and jewish propaganda channel. this channel is top brainwash people slowly.
of all the cities he didn't name their capital
thats not how you pronounce Brisbane or Melbourne.
Please make a worth it about orange chicken
I love that seafood was done but I feel comparing three different types of seafood is unfair. It would be like comparing chicken vs turkey vs goose.
Adam is my favorite part of every video
You know it's good when Adam decides to say 'it's very good'
New Zealand is better
The moment when the winner of a seafood competition isn't even seafood but fresh water Marin .
7:10 I really like how Steven is so caring... I just feel like those two white guys don't treat him with respect when it's basically his show.
Would the Cirrus dish be seafood since it was a fresh water crayfish
is it still called seafood if its not from the sea? :P
Adam looks like the most adorable little fisherman in that outfit
gf.me/u/ct77sw please help us out! 😭
can they PLEASE! make a WORTH IT CHANNEL!
NO!!!! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOO.... THAT ANIMAL WAS STILL ALIVE WHEN THE GUY CHOPPED IT IN HALF AND STARTED SEASONING IT!!!!! NOOOOOOOO
I'm so hungry and Im watching this. #hungers gone (≧∇≦)/
i've had everything..
Water may reduce the amount of flavor, but it's the humane way to kill a crustacean. Slicing one in hallf and spreading butter on it's insides while it's still alive is not.
Stop pronouncing Melbourne like that it hurts...
213$ isnt really that expensive, there are alot of places where it's much much more expensive...
Poorth? You said it completely wrong go learn how to say Perth correctly.
rename this shellfish so you don't waste the idea of having straight up fish
go china and do $50 hotpot vs $500 hot pot
What is it again? Worthajatua?
Hope you enjoyed your stay in Australia! Wish I could have met you guys!
I love the quiet guy Adam💕
5:23 crawfish is like \n\n\n\nRead more
10:47 that smile reminded me of the sloth's smile from zootopia
10:34 actually its illegal to harvest abalone using scuba gear. you need to do it with a snorkel.
I hope you guys try Belgian Trappist beer. It's the best
What glasses and clip on sunglasses are Adam wearing
At 5:33 you can see the heart beating....idk how I feel about that.
When I see Steven .. I see Seungri ಠ_ಠ why
That's probably the best pun you've ever done\n\nNo way!
I feel like this series is what makes BuzzFeed it's money lol
8:38 omg Adam <3 <3 <3. how is he SO cute?!
They flew by business class!
can't wait for the next episode!
They are doing the MelbOUrne on purpose right?\nAlso, doing wine? Best go to WA.
Andrew come down to Louisiana and have a chargrilled oysters! It will change your life!!
Maybe road trip to each state? As far as travel there is Italy, France, Brazil, India, Thailand, Germany, South Africa, and maybe an obscure place or atypical.
like for andrew and adam's return
When I saw the lobster get cut in half I felt really bad and had to exit the video.... I think I won't be able to eat seafood for a while now
Brent is a savage
that lobster was still alive
The song at 4:57?? I swear it keeps showing up in their videos and I can't figure out what it is
Anyone know the song that starts around 5:02?
AUSSIE REPRESENT
Next do $2 toupee vs $500 toupee
yay melbourne rules!
DO STREET FOOD PLEASE
HIS NAME IS BISHES? I CANT LMAOOOO SWISH SWISH BISHES!!!
OMG, did Adam actually react to something?
Ha mell burn!
He missed Adelaide.. 😂

It's Mel-bin! Your Mel-born montage triggered me. Hahaha <3
$ Fruit vs $$$ Fruit!
7:29 LOL i thought he was gonna yell SUPRISE MOTHA F***ER
Do vegan food!!!
Fish and chips episode!
I don't think this is a fair comparison tbh. The things you guys ate were vastly different from each other.
could have gone to maine or Massachusetts for bomb seafood
These people get paid to travel and eat food. Im so jealous
That oyster guy talks so fast he's giving Trisha paytas a run for her money
i love that adam is always included and thought about.so sweet
How has there not been a Worth It sandwich edition
Come on you don't have to bleep out the swears.
Is this in USD or AUD?
I love Adam he's so sweet and quiet but he's precious
The ocean version of an astronaut😘
This episode makes me so proud to be Australian!
WHY did I not watch this earlier because I love buzzfeed and I live in Australia
Come to England next or the u.k
This is probably the only thing out of BuzzFeed I like.
the try guys, ones called steven, STEVEN TRIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nginger nonce
I love this team so muuuuch 😂😂 Adam ❤❤
Alice Springs?!!! That's from Kangaroo Jack!!
WHATTTT STEVEN GETS HIS OWN ALCOHOL IN WORTH IT
Worth it is only thing buzzfeed makes that I want to watch otherwise their videos are just sexist against men
you should go in italy to eat pizza and do another worth it. or pasta. you can't even imagine how many types of pasta there are out there. and if u want, my grandma could cook something for ya
7:31 Surprise Motherfucka!

I did the video about depression on my channel if you want to check it out
Chester is an hero, he didnt deserve to die from auto-erotic asphyxiation
Anyone else sick of hearing about this guy? We get it he died, it was his own choice, life goes on.
Fuck Kaepernick. He made his bed, now he gets to lie in it,
No where on YouTube can you find Max Kellerman part which is the most profound part of the interview? ESPN your YouTube just happens to leave that 2mins out 🐸☕️
Funny how ESPN conveniently left off Max K.'s comment  (which was the very next thing said) calling out the country and the NFL's racism.
And of course ESPN does not upload Max's LEGENDARY rant during this segment..... or let anyone else upload it
Who cares...what does him getting hired do to help anything
Stephen A Smith is so phony he was just last week he was criticizing Kaepernick and his girl
i went to a predominately black school. ripped books?? How about smashed toilets, spray paint everywhere, overrun with drugs etc etc etc. Black youth DO NOT want to learn. Thats for pussies. They want to excel at being a Thug!  Male and female alike. Never have one race been given so much, for so long, with no prosperity except for rappers and sports stars. In 30 yrs. Mexicans and Asians are buying houses, cars, owning businesses and prospering.  In 200 years, Blacks are back peddling.Just sad:(((
Why wont they play Max Kellerman's take on the subject..???\nPerhaps they do not want other white to gravitate to his assessment....\n\nH~
I love how intelligent and factual snoop is. Considering him smoking a quarter ounce before the show 😂😂
Listen up kids, just don`t kneel during the national anthem ...period!
The 1 thing that these fake sports networks refuse to ask is, Why didnt CK protest the year they went to the Superbowl?  Wasnt there police brutality then? The question everyone should be asking is , is CK using racsim to stay relevant?  When CK had all those endorsements during the pinnacle of his career,  wasnt there racism and police brutality going on? If CK wouldve protested the year he went to the SB, it wouldve been more impactful for a star on the rise to make a stance but this shitbag waits until Harbaughs gone and once he starts to become irrelevant and nolonger had the sponsors , then he comes out with his protest. These billionaires arent stupid.  They know exactly what hes doing. When the lights were bright and when he had the world by the balls he kept his mouth shut. But the moment he loses his job, hes protesting about things hes never experienced.  Timing is everything and CK is a fraud using racism to stay relevant
So we're not gonna show the best part, Max preachin' the truth?
If Kaep's receivers were 8 feet tall and could reach overthrown passes, or under 5 feet tall and could scoop up dirt balls at their feet, he'd rank in the top 5 QBS of all time.
Reading Calvin Snoop Dogg Broadus Jr.'s biography and music art, I learned much like Tupac and untold numbers of American urban story-TRUTH-tellers, Calvin composes music vividly describing America's current National HEALTH CRISIS, aka America's Culture of African American Child Abuse, Emotional Neglect and Maltreatment that evolved from America's multi-generational, ignorant, once legal Culture of Racism!\n\nReading Calvin's art I learned he composes music HATEFULLY demeaning and denigrating black or African American teen girls and women, aka the MATERNAL HALF of America's black or African American population, as less than human *itches and hoes unworthy of basic human respect. \n\nReading Calvin's art I learned much like Mr. Barack My Brother's Keeper Obama WH guests and friends urban TRUTH-tellers Kendrick Lamar and Nasir Nas Jones, Calvin composes music vividly describing the VIOLENT, SUIC!DAL, HOMIC!DAL people and community harming behaviors he engaged in, or witnessed his emotionally ill friends and other community members engaging in.\n\nFrankly, after learning of Calvin Snoop Dogg Broadus Jr.'s potentially life scarring childhood and teen upbringing, I have no doubts what-so-ever Snoop Dogg (born 1971) is one of COUNTLESS “EVERYONE(s)” the late popular American urban story-TRUTH-teller Tupac Shakur (born 1971) is speaking about in his (often misinterpreted) #THUGLIFE Child Abuse, Emotional Neglect, Abandonment and Maltreatment *AWARENESS* concept!!!\n\nThe Hate U Give Little Infants Fvvks *EVERYONE* ~Tupac Shakur\n\n“We need more people who care; you know what I’m saying? We need more women, mothers, fathers, we need more of that…” ~Tupac Shakur\n\nIn case there is any confusion, I am writing about and sharing evidence of America’s MUCH IGNORED, oppressive, potentially life scarring African American *PARENTAL CHILD CARE* HEALTH CRISIS that I, as well as a growing number of my reasonably responsible, caring, concerned American and foreign born neighbors believe is impeding our American neighbors of African descent from experiencing the equality and respect all peaceful, reasonably responsible Americans are entitled to enjoy.\n\nPeace.\n___\nAmerican *(Children's)* Lives Matter; Take Pride In Parenting; End Our National Health Crisis; Child Abuse and Neglect; End Community Violence/Fear, Police Anxiety & Educator's Frustrations\n\nTagged: #JamylaBolden, #TyshawnLee, #KingstonFrazier, #AvaCastillo, #JulieDombo, #FredrikaAllen, #EthanAli, #LavontayWhite, #NovaMarieGallman, #AyannaAllen, #TrinityGay, #THUGLIFE >>>REMEDY>>> #AFRECAN\n\n*America’s Firm Resolve to End Childhood Abuse and Neglect”*

IM sorry which triggered bitches on which sides of the spectrum want to make more of it lmfao...........pls project all problems in life into the issue as apparently there is more to look into.....oh people that have the right to pass on this guy did......and now its coming into question???????????really in question? or the issue of indifference and  this isnt the land of the free and home of the brave that is really being brought up again due to it selling quite well in our climate........its ok im sure colin is the only one that believes  this isnt the land of the free and home of the brave triggered salt bitches come here to shit on him as a safe space i guess........bc  this isnt the land of the free and home of the brave is apparently a view only held buy 1 guy enough to equate to 1/2 the country hating him.........for some reason bc  this isnt the land of the free and home of the brave is only a thought held by 1 american apparently  lmfao. meanwhile i await the signs of a one world govt/globalized army etc....that is free to commit world wide atrocity with little to no opposition taxing and enslaving the world on a global scale yeah w.e. Hegemons got a far wider scope than the typical laymen looking at the world through a straw while breathing through the same straw. lmfao keep projecting that its colin thats the problem and in reality this 50% thats not exactly or literally 50% of our population but the deplorables that projects their hatered to the remaining population onto colin lmfao.....and every other object that the hegemons put in front of you to scare you into your next panicked act or impulse.....lmfao you fools cant even choose your own choices or decide or rationalize anything you merely look to your decision makers to do as the hegmonds intend for the proletariat god damn
It's all the backlash and constant questions the team would get if he was picked up by a team. That and they would lose a little money. That's from the fans not understanding and/or not caring about what's going on with the uncalled for killings and brutality from police against blacks and no consequences for it. Too hard to see through the lens of another person and being closed minded. For some it's just racism. Teams don't want to take the chance of sacrificing their comfort zone or likelihood of the franchise. So for those who say why then just move? Shouldn't have to, he was born here and ancestors had a BIG stake in building this country for shit. He opted out but he's good enough to be at least a backup somewhere.
An AIDS infected Male slut, and a Pot head druggy that promotes Black youth to drugs and a life of crime! Yeah, we want their advice! Lol! On a racist Black loser QB that hates Blacks as much the KKK does! 😂! \n\nNot one of the three live in a black neighborhood!!!\n\nThis is hilarious!! You can't write this type or ignorance!! I love it! Daytime drama! As The Race Card Turns!!!!
Season already kicked off and still no Colin lol
Are y'all blind. He  got benched as a back up quarterback way BEFORE he starting kneeling. Why don't anyone remember this? He underperformed during practices WAY BEFORE he starting kneeling during  the anthem. So please.....lets cut the BULL CRAP AND THE FAKE HYSTERIA.
lol snoop says teams need someone like Kap that will help you win right now.. Kap's had a losing record the last two years in a row, he's a trash qb and too much of a liability
Same happened to Mahmoud Abdul Rauf in the NBA
a black athlete that kids might look up to is in the media for standing up for social issues and using his own money and time to help others!?!?!?!?! GOD FORBID
Kap is getting what he deserves the NFL is doing the right thing
I'm done with ESPN. Its become too political for my liking. Having Snoop Dogg on the panel is not appropriate. Goodbye
probably the first time, I heard snoop talk without saying bitches and hoes..
Only difference is backup QB's are not asking for millions of dollars. Fuck Kap, He's trash and needs to just focus on his black panther bullshit..Lol
It's crazy looking at snoop now compared to the death row days 😂
Snoop look like he got stone 3-5 hours before he got on the show...
snoop and magic, I don't think they're could possibly be a cooler panel
Kap should do like Terelle Pryor and switch to wide receiver
Help a team win????? Hello helped the niners win one game out of eleven with his 1-10 record last year.
We have a pussy grabbing lying racist as president, but Kaep is being vilified for protesting.
For fucking Christ's sake, COLIN HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING BUT WEAR A FUCKING TSHIRT, AN AFRO, AND TAKE A KNEE!!!! It's not like he is out brandishing a weapon at civilians! What is so wrong behind that?
Kaepernick will not buck dance ok back down. I support Kaepernick 100 %
Why doesn't he just go to the CFL then?? LOL
Conservatives get black balled in Hollywood all the time for their beliefs. So whats so special about Kaepernick getting black balled in the NFL? ESPN employs BLM activists instead of sportcasters to pump out white hate and Kaepernick supports that. Let him go work at ESPN and join the club.\nJust because you can throw a ball does not mean your owed a job in the NFL. You think Kaepernick is the only one who has more skill then some in the NFL? If you apply at my work and I don't like you, I should still be forced to hire you? F that.
What happened to the very next comment, made by Max Kellerman, ESPN? Didn't want anyone to hear that again, huh?
Love these guys (except for max) but talking aboit bads schools and bools being torn. Magic has clearly never been a teacher. The kids r awful, they r the ones tearing the books.
Snoop probably went to ESPN high af😂😂
That's y we NEED MORE BLACK OWNERS!
Yea this is what we needed,nigga that has aids to talk about black problems...whats next??Magic johnson faggot tranny son will come to the show to speak  about tranny lives? Snoop Dog like 60 year old stil reps crip gang and killed innocent men and they not put him in jail...yeah these are the voices black peoples needs to listen...some aids dude that has tranny son,and some 60 year old nigga still acting like he gangbanger
Snoop needs to be a regular on this show. I'd rather have his real opinions on things than hear Will Cain try to analytically dissect and disagree with everything SAS and Max say. Would put a real positive spin on this show, which sometimes tends to devolve into bickering and arguing over abstract points and ideologies.
Is Colin Kaepernick going to take the Colts to the playoffs? Nope. The jets? Nope. The jags? Nope. He's not some transcendent player who is going to make your team great so don't try to tell me that if they cared about winning they'd sign Kaepernick. Oh by the way it is a good move for owners to not sign him because there are lots of people protesting the NFL over these guys kneeling for the anthem so regardless of how Stephen A feels, Kaepernick did offend a good portion of the audience.
Come subscribe to my channel! The top 100 subs will be entered in a giveaway!!!
why does she talk wtf. just sit there and look hot. women shouldnt be analysts
CAN WE PLEASE FUCKING STICK TO SPORTS!!!!
but who wants him ?
Oh and by the way.... hard drug use in america has increased again in america as if its the 80s......  and guess what culture is the most followed/popular with the new generation?.....     I know people are still too primitive to understand this but racism in America is not your number 1 problem black ppl..........    never has been.   Who lives freer than black males in america?  Watch your television
That's true snoop dog!! But them folks ain't trying hear that.. it is what it is..
Snoop Dog is actually better than Will Clown
It's not football something u u use your hands dumb Americans
Stephen A. Smith and snoop hit me up guys, I got some doctors that could fix those hairlines that go all the way back to segregation.
Kap is going to be recognized as one of the greatest humanitarians of all time, keep it up white America.
Lost all respect for snoop' s heroin smoking ass after the Floyd and Connor fight
Hey I don't turn on ESPN for politics now I got to stop watching ESPN because it a Biased Network come on freaking racecards going to now be in sports give me a freaking break... Why don't you just go on strike and not even have the football season just because of one jerk
Snoop the sell out,  SAS is more gangsta
Magic Johnson and Snoop Dogg. Thats a lotta greatness right there
Maybe he's too much of an off field distraction that hasn't produced enough on the field to be on a team. 85% of the league is black. Shut up with this racist bs.
Stoop dog on the set
Colin wasn't helping my niners win the last season he was there. He had a hot couple of years. He's not an elite passer. The other stuff just the icing on the cake.
so, Pac wasn't cool with Snoop Dogg?
why does it seem everyone that is backin colin now was quiet as shit at the time of his protests?
Trust, if you can ball or be top 10-12 at your position you ALWAYS get a second shot in the NFL. But if you are just ON THE TEAM you become a distraction and not a team enhancement. PERIOD.\n\nSo there are 12 QB's as a GM i would take over Kaep, easily. And my NFL team building strategy at the QB position changes drastically if my QB choice is under top 12-15. I move the time and dollar resources to full other needs on the team until my QB options improve. But to offer you a second chance you can just be a guy on the team.
thought magic had dreads in the thumbnail lol
Steven A. 100% right when he said, the NFL owners feel it will effect their bottom line, it sounds good to me. It is a business after all. And with 70% of the NFL player being black it's obvious this has nothing to do with racism. Blacks will still try to interject race into the reason, but they always do that all the time.
Good thing Colin had some skills because he's about the ugliest MF in football.
If us working people brought our politics  into work and cost the boss MONEY  we'd be out on my ass real quick
The NFL will be just fine without Colin Kaepernick.
People seem to forget that Colin Kaepernick grew up in a white family and a town that is basically all white in Turlock California. Why isn't anybody talking about that. And I live 20 minutes north of Turlock and I used to work there and I can tell you in equivocal that town is very Prejudice towards so-called minorities. I was working at a grocery store called Save Mart back in 2005 just helping out for 2 months because I worked in Modesto and these people acting like that never seen a black guy before I felt like I stepped into the sixties..
cilon krapdick is a nigger and so is poop dog
CHARLOTTVILLE ? REALLY SNOOP ...WHAT ABOUT MISSOURI or EVEN MIAMI 🤔😏\n#GTFOH
I'm good on football, I'll just catch the Raider highlights
well since you all backing up mr colin kaepernick...let me ask you all the same question...why kaepernick didn't do this kneeling shit when barack obama was in office for 8 fucking years?
The man went to the Superbowl, and the following year, went to the NFC championship game. He can ball-out with the best of em.
UNTIL HE'S BACK HIRED THE NFL IS FIRED IN MY HOUSE
White supremacy is the conscious or unconscious belief or the investment in the inherent superiority of some, while others are believed to be innately inferior. And it doesn't demand the individual participation of the singular bigot. It is a machine operating in perpetuity, because it doesn't demand that somebody be in place driving.\nMichael Eric Dyson\nIt doesn't exist!
Naw answer his question. What did he do that was so bad?
LMFAO!\nThey are asking the opinion of snoop lion, snoop dog or whatever his name is.  This guy made a living by rapping about violence and fucking hos. I guess they have to get the opinion of the average black man.
ESPN is a fucking disgrace u have a scumbag like snoop who make a video about killing Donald Trump and people should take he's black ass seriously fuck out of here.
Tom Savage lasted two quarters before getting pulled. \nMatt Moore didn't even get a chance to be the starter when Tennehill went down.\nMark Sanchez  is the third string QB on the bears.\nGeno Smith broke his jaw on his team-mate's fist but is good enough to backup Eli.\nBut Kaep can't even get an interview. The NFL is just 32 billionaires making money on the backs of people willing to destroy their bodies. There are 30 players in the NBA with guaranteed contracts of more than $100m. There are zero in the NFL.
the moral of the story here is snoop dog set up and got 2pac murdered in Las Vegas 1996 and got away with murder twice.
All this because of some fat, overweight, ugly, donut sucking white assholes
The problem is that he isn't good enough to be worth the distractions he will bring. If he was a Tom Brady or an Aaron Rogers, teams would sign his ass in a heartbeat.
Snoop got that clean lineup lol
SNdoubleop
Stick to sports espn
Msespn at it again
When did ESPN become SJWN?
Snoop almost Snitched! :-)
Craig Hodges
Racist people hate kap #FUCKracistPatriots
Kaepernick gon end up broke.
White Supremacy is Americas TRUE Tradition.
Colts, Jets, Broncos, Jaguars, etc need him asap
echo chamber
Kaepernick doing it just to impress his pretty girlfriend from ISIS
LOL the retards in commenting are being so dishonest. None of these guys know shit about football.\nKaepernick is a backup, or a starter on a bottom 5 team at best. Once you look at all the negative publicity he brings with him it's no surprise whatsoever no team wants him. Miami would've signed him, but wait huge Cuban population who hate Kaepernick because of his Castro support ( pretty disgusting, I mean the guy was a genocidal dictator ). Also, the Ravens were set to sign him, and his gf sends out a racist as f tweet that ruined the deal, as Ray Lewis has been attesting to.\nThere are studies that have been done showing the NFL's loss in viewership was directly tied to these anthem protests, so if a player is already bad and does this shit, none of you can act shocked or disgusted when they get cut.\nThe owners have a vested interest in keeping viewership up. Capitalism only cares about making money, it doesn't care about your skin color or your sexuality morons
What these rich bozos don't understand is that the middle class OVERWHELMINGLY disagrees with Kaepernick's tactics. They see it as disrespect toward our military. So regardless of the truth in his protest, MOST, and yes, MOST, sports fans see it as disrespectful. Stop trying to twist it into a race thing because it ain't.
When will the race baitors of ESPN realize Kap is a garbage QB? Sure some QBs in the league are trash; replacing trash with trash just leaves you with the same old trash
This one of the few times you'll catch snoop dogg not high
This is the last of the three trial Basics videos! This pushed my quick-explanation skills to the limit, but I figure that slow down the video and replay if necessary is better than let people get bored...
0:45,Who else checked if the quality was on 144p?
I was always wondering about this. Could you also make an advanced version please?
This is essentially how I assumed compression worked, but I'm glad I have the verification now
Laughed too hard at the worms/words pun! Too funny
Arithmetic encoding can compress text even more than Huffman coding, but not if each symbol is encoded separately.
You should get LBRY and upload your videos there! :)
Great as always, Tom
This takes me back to uni, heh. I'd actually forgotten everything about Huffman Coding except how it looks and its purpose. Cheers!
Useful information. I definitely learned something today. Thanks!
i expected better research from this channel. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is Will Smith's magnum opus.
WE WANT MORE!! doesnt have to be basic but just MOOORRRREE
I'm sorry, but Wild Wild West is not Will Smith's Magnum Opus. Everyone knows that's Summertime.
What do you have against Will Smith?
So cool! Would love to see one with a breakdown about zip files.
3:30 – *Finally* , after three and a half minute of blah, blah, blah!! Now, *TELL IT!!!!*
'worms' see what you did there
So is the tree itself somehow stored in the file? What's the syntax of that?
That's a great idea!
Loved this. I was wondering where the other 2 episodes were but turns out I've accidentally already seen them. Love you Tom! Keep up the good stuff x
great series Tom. keep them coming !!!
.otherwise you end up sending the wrong worms... haha very good.
A basics video with two machines who you programmed in 'basic'. Brilliant.
I made a program that does this and I went from the original being 29544 bits and the compressed being 21008 bits. That is 71% the original size.
I don't understand how the compression method dictates the order of the characters when they decompress. Seems like a rather important shortcoming there @tomscott
I wrote a huffman compression system once that reads in UTF8 and does huffman compression on the selection of unicode characters that are used, used it to reduce transfer times for some script files for a game addon.
Nice, Simple, Effective!! As always!!
what about middle out compression?
Considering this is Binary, I wonder what we could achieve if we could accurately read/write halves, quarter, 1/8ths of a charge.  \nPerhaps unlike quantum computers, with as much accuracy and speed of current hardware.  \nCould we be even more sloppy with our implementation than the 8-bit encoding?
This was so interesting and good. Wanted it to keep going!
The lossy compression bit was brilliant. Making it look compressed at the right time.
I, too, hate it when I end up sending the wrong worms.
No need to make Unicode seem more complex than it is. The ascii characters have the same code points in Unicode. Unicode just gives you more including characters for other languages. Could just say they are stored as extended sequences which in UTF-8, they are.
I've always wondered how this works, this is amazing!
this feels like something quantum computers could speed up, i dont know though it just seems like it
That's a numberwang!.. Oh wait, nice explanation.
0:54 Worms ahahahah I see what you did there
Hi Tom, thanks for these! We spoke a while back about doing some videos like this for GCSE Computer Science students, this is perfect. Hope the trial goes well and you fancy doing some more :-)
haHA!!! Worms. I don't get it?
Love it when a youtube video makes me feell like I lerned something. Tbank you, Tom
sending the wrong WORMS  haha , I see what you dis there !
great video!  I have been wondering this for quite a while (but been too lasy to look it up ...)
I thought it was: take the most common words, assign a brand new character to each of them, and insert whenever that character comes up.
That was interesting 👍
Really amazing video quality. Something very different this time. I love your channel...
What is the work joke? I don't get it
... send the wrong worms. Ha! I see what you did there!
And I can apply Huffman to save the Huffman tree, and the Huffman code, or again. So actually  we are just trading space for work, right? Or storing information into work? That's cool. Maybe it's what the universe is doing right now, unveiling its stored  Huffman code through chemical reactions.
Yeah, cool stuff. I'll just keep using my golang gzip/(whatever your preference is) library since I'm trusting scientists to do this for me. Seriously, I'm too busy actually building things irl to re-invent the wheel just for fun.
I wrote a full on huffman compressor for fun once. I was disappointed that it only yielded about, like you see here, 30% compression (leaving 70% the original size.) I figured I did something wrong.
I read the thumbnail as “How Computers Computers Text”
As usual, darned fascinating! Please continue with the series. I know _some_ stuff but I'm learning lots!
Always wanted to say that I love your voice, Tom. This is actually the reason why I subbed.
Can we please get into foreign characters?
You should keep doing this kind of videos, it was enjoyable and really informative - don't get me wrong I always learn something from your vids, but this was one of a kind-
I love this channel so much
Tom, thank you for reminding mr how good Youtube can be.
Cnt u leve out ltrs nd jst hve a way to ad thm in at th end? So long as ech wrd is uniq or has cntxt clus?
Wow I can hear the buzz from the old monitors that's funny
This guy is vsauce IT edition
Now i understand why windows have 64 bits and 32 bits.. \nwow thanks sir!! :D\nEdit: by that i mean\n64^64 or 32^32 bits \nRight? :)
where did you get two working BBC model B computers? - haven't see one for a couple of decades
I love you and your vimeos.
xz -9ev some_huge_file.txt  (now let's wait a few days)
0:50 Otherwise you wind up sending the wrong worms\nI see whatcha did thar...
Next vid will be intermediate and cover zip files.\n\nThe way you explain things makes everything easy to understand!
So you're telling me Will Smith *wasn't* rapping about the Wild Wild West wiki I'm sure exists about that movie?
This one of only two things I remember from my programming module - the other is a habit of typing both the open and close brackets at the same time.
i think i understood that...
I like the series
If you break in to house and steal cold cuts out of fridge are you then a hamburglar
You missed range and arithmetic encoding :-)
Nice job with this...
Tom! This video leaves me wanting for so much more!!
now do GZIP/7z/RAR... jpg/png/bmp... mp3/wav/ogg... i gots to know
what ya gonna do when you hit 1mill subs?\nPS really love the series
Can't wait for the video on zip files :)
Or as it's known today; Huffcod.
I feel like an expert
I hate it when I send the wrong worms
I love this series. If you decide to continue, I would be very much for it!
Hoffman ripped off Euclid but a search tree is a elemtry algorithm
These series are great, Tom. You have a knack for explaining complicated concepts intuitively without losing what's important. Do you use any unconventional techniques for understanding the concepts deeply enough to capture the gist of them like this? My current strategy is reading and trying to incorporate the concept in my current knowledge base, but it usually takes 2-3 readings to do.
I know about this stuff already but still watch it because Tom Scott is a good lad
This is magic. I've just finished my text compression algorithm in C++ the day before yesterday, and this video was uploaded. I feel I'm being observed.
cool story bro, gotta split mid video to go watch the will smith music video
Ha! a love the send the wrong worms :-)
Awesome presentation....inspired by you...I am an IT engineer...:wanna start my tech channel too after viewing your video and fan base....wish me good luck ☺️☺️☺️
0:50 ...sending the wrong *worms*  I see what you did there =D
Why can't I give you 5 likes for this video :-(
THANK YOU TOM SCOTT!! I have wondered how compression like this worked for the better part of a decade, and I've even put a decent amount of time into researching it, but it never clicked until this video.  You have the best content on this entire platform, both in subject matter and quality.
Very nice graphics, too!
Do zip files now!
sending the wrong worm haha
the wrong worms 😂
Damn Tom, number 23 on trending. Grats!!
Please Remove Background Noise
Wah Huffman Coding is so clever...
Why no advanced videos on Computers?  I already read about all this stuff.
Nobody seems to be addressing the elephant 🐘: how is the tree stored and how is it read?

Something seems a little off... but still looking forward to it
if i see you on my bus again imma fuck you up
Maybe that Bryan Cranston (Dr Time Whatley) is shown in this trailer as a Psychiatrist means that it is actual Bryan playing a role within the show? As in they are filming in this scene? I cant think of anyone else who previously played a role on Seinfeld then showing up in Curb as a character and not as themselves, but I could be wrong. Maybe Larry is filming a show within Curb. Curb is meant to be Larry post Seinfeld so by that rule Cranston cant really play another character besides himself.
He speaks for all of us...
Larry David is an america hating jew bastard.
All i can see is Bernie being an asshole and I love it.
The picture quality looks Amazing!
I love watching that show Larry David is funny as Hell
Alert Alert Alert Jew overload! I can't wait.
Seeing Richard Lewis back just made me smile and feel warm inside. That man is so good for the show.
Whoa. Insight to what I was afraid of. Looks like he went over the top with his Larry David persona and is going to taint the reputation of the originl Curb, Fingers crossed this was just a cut of the dumb stuff though.
My baby is back!!
Haha! Lady sprays Larry with perfume.\n\nLarry: Fuck! \nAnd shoves her to the floor. Classic!
omg I lost my shit when Leon said he still fucking won!
I hope people aren't too offended nowadays for his wonderful style of humor.
Is it just me, or does Larry seem like an even bigger dick in this season?
You can't go home again.  It looks like he's trying too hard.
So worth the wait.
I can so relate to that last bit. When couples tongue each other in front of me I really want to just say Can you just take that shit somewhere else
One of the two finest and best comedy shows of all time. Of course the other one is Seinfeld.\nCannot wait to watch the new season. \n\nBig fan from Saudi Arabia.
I was in a hot dog eating contest..and I was constipated...and I fucking won!
I hope he keeps doing this for years, it's just going to get funnier the older he gets.
the change in camera quality is throwing me off
god bless larry david for bringing a new season hope season 9 isnt the end of it.
Thank the Gods. The Golden God. Larry has returned to us like the crashing of a thousand waves.
Larry David is so fucking funny!!
subscribe and view my videos !!!! :) <3
If I see u on my bus again...
Anyone know how I can watch this in the UK without waiting for bloody ages?
YOU GOT LONG BALLS LARRY
The world is in the death knell of a nuclear circle firing squad and this guy steps into the center to do his haha schtick ?
The best comedy show ever...pretty pretty pretty awesome 😂
God knows how long I have been waiting for this. Just air them already!
17 years since the show premiered and we still can't watch re-runs on TV.   A-holes.
I've never seen this show but if this means more memes yeah
Seriously, I thought most of these people had died already.
I'm allowed to be happy for this, but not in front of Larry! And only mild laughter.
NOTICE LARRY IS GETTING ANGRIER AND ANGRIER AS THE YEARS GO BYE, JUST LIKE ME
1:08\n\nWas that a shit bow?
nick-picky observation I know, but I saw the mattress/airbed he landed on at 1:09
His shit is kind of getting old and worn out.
You know what was great about this trailer? It hyped me up for the show without giving away any spoilers, a basic promotional technique that most trailers today have forgotten how to use.
i've never seen this show but just from this trailer it looks pretty damn funny
...do you like a chip and a dip?
I am so excite for your returning, Lawrence!! I hope to perhaps edit this New Season and sneak my Face and Torso inside it!!
Larry David is up there with Sigmund Freud ,Einstein, Nabakov and Jesus in my best Jews ever list. Last time I was this pleased with developments my wife told me she was pregnant. Fucking Marvellous.
Huge fan of LD we both share the same bday July 2nd plus his show funny af😂😂😂😂😂can't wait
I came for the curb and left
If the previous seasons were even a bit scripted, this one is alltogether... And I doubt the previous ones werent
you're allowed to be happy but uh... not infront of me...
Omg, I love this show! can't wait. I desperately need to laugh!
What kind of stain was it?  True comedy is back!!!!
If Larry shaved his head he'd look like Patrick Stewart.
anyone seen the leaked episodes from this season and how were they compared to the older seasons? don't think i wanna spoil it as there only seems to be the second, third and fourth ones available..
117 people don't respect wood.
Mankind's greatest creation is Larry David.
1:07 Larry gives a shit bow lol
i need this
Jew Box Hero.
0:58 FUNKMAN!!

hopefully more political incorrectness and less sjw pandering.
Sanders/David 2020
Alright!
The meme. The myth. The legend
Love, love, love this show..yes!!
Looks pretty... pretty... pretty good
Leon 🤣
YESSS FINALLLYYY
Awful show. Larry David is repulsive.
wow...........he looks really, really old!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
my favorite bald ,avuncular Jew
Walter white
Fucking Finally
nice
Is that Michael Fassbender @1:12?
Fucking Jew piece of shit
Larry fukin David. Enjoy your millions while you can, you unfunny prick
Schmohawks!
YEAHHH!!!!! I miss that crazy loon!
Bingoooooooo!!! Can't wait :)
Oh God oh God oh God hes back!
Genius comedian
Cranston as Larry's therapist?!!!!!
I have bought HBO every year for many many years now I am done with you liberal pieces of shit fuck you and fuck your network and fuck all you America haters not buying another fucking product from Hollywood. I'll guarantee you're going to lose so much fucking money and you assholes will never win another election trust me
This is a blessing(and a paycheck) Larry. Look at it this way, nobody stays up and watches SNL any more so it's just a wasted cameo. And at CYE, nobody ask if you are a Racist, NAZI or Klansman, at least not to your face. And Baldwin is on a losing streak and needs the money to keep his wife's tennis coach employed. But if it means that much to you, Bernie might run again in 2020 but of course we know Hillary will be running so it will be another short run for Bernie and you'd be out on the street again. At least at CYE you've got a check.
They're all really showing their ages now.
Funny show. But undoubtedly neo-liberal propaganda.
Weak meme
Unlike Seinfeld, this has gone on a lot longer than should have. Should've ended it season 5
Rihanna definitely raised the bar for me. This shows other companies there is absolutely no excuse for putting only 5-10 shades out there that only cater to a certain group of people. Its a 10/10 for me as well!
the way you applied that contour!! hunttyyyyy!!! that was genius lol
First off this was by far the best review on Fenty that I have seen and we gotta get you to a Million subscribers!!!! You are the F*CKING BEST!
Okay you did a really good review like it made me subscribe to you...I'm glad you took the time to learn the product and your voice is soothing and you sound like you seriously took the time to learn everything you put on your face and I like that you taught us how to apply that trophy wife...you did that!
WOMAN YOU LOOK LIKE THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF. MAY YOU BE BLESSED XXXXXXX
THANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL THE EFFORT YOU PUT INTO YOUR VIDEOS. Seriously, all the product descriptions and prices INCLUDED IN THE VIDEO not in the description, side by sides, talk overs, LITERALLY ALL swatches, EVERYTHING. Nobody really does this anymore and it's seriously so helpful I'm not sure why people stopped. AND ON TOP OF THAT YOU STILL DID FIRST IMPRESSIONS/TUTORIAL AND ACTUALLY CAME BACK TO LET US KNOW HOW THE MAKEUP WORE WHICH NOBODY EVER DOES. BASICALLY MORAL OF THE STORY IS THANK YOU GIRL I ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR EFFORTS AND THEY ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED 😍❣️
I have so much to say where do I start!! First off THANK YOU so much for saving me that night of the release with all those swatches you did! Seriously saved me a lot of time at checkout. This IS the best Fenty Beauty review I've seen thus far. I love your attention to detail and how thorough you are! And thank you so so much for showing how to apply Trophy wife the RIGHT way. I know it's pigmented but I'm waiting for mines in the mail and I just kept thinking I was going to practice applying it as lightly as possible so I didn't have straight yellow on my face lol. You made that application trick look so easy. That highlight is gorgeous obviously not for everyday but for when you want to show out! I recently subbed to your channel but I definitely need to binge watch your vids once I get wifi back thanks to Hurricane Irma smh. Lastly your thumbnail of those gorgeousss pictures you took looking like you should've been in that fenty campaign. Girl you had me deceased!! You NAILED that. Omg do you look gorgeous in those photos. Those pictures was spot on! Again thank you, you are MUCH appreciated!
This was a great thorough review.
Wow queen! You couldn't have done any better 💕
I love your review very detailed. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾you know your stuff as well
Omg I always wink back at your cartoon at the beginning of your videos😩😭
love your contour trick, it looks so flawless !!
This is the first video I've seen of yours and my gosh you are stunning!!!
I love how professional this review is. You really thought about the best way to show everything. Loved it all!
Looks good I am curious about the products
I love the idea of using the cream stick in the centre of the lips and the gloss on top. I have a bunch of cream highlighters I never use, so I'm going to try that.
this up old styles is funny
BEST REVIEW OUT HERE
Your makeup is BEAUTIFUL! Seriously! I've watched a couple few reviews of fenty and yours would be the reason why I'd buy! Simply gorgeous!
Your video is the best I've seen thus far
best makeup review of the year
Tbh out of all the beauty gurus/youtubers I follow, Alissa was the only one who DID her JOB and really gave us all the tea concerning the products/ shades / swatches and everything at the release party. also her make up always slaaaaaays so u know her review is the most relevant rn jusssaying
This is definitely the best review I've seen!. Not predictable, you've tried other ways of using the products and you've used products the range. Xx
Can You Be anymore gorgeous 😍😍 the thumbnail though 😩❤️
I love your videos 💛
your intro is the prettiest intro i've ever seen wow 😍
Such a good damn review!! Thank you!!!!
does anyone know what eyelashes she's wearing?? so pretty!!
Oh man. Wish I had lips like yours. Also your video is so informative and you're such an articulate speaker. Loved watching this.
The best people I've seen  review Fenty beauty are you, Patricia Bright and Holly boon x
You re eyes are beautiful 😍
One of, if not my favorite review of this line! You have a new subscriber in me. :-)
You explain and expanded so well in all your videos..i watched other reviews of the fenty and yours is very explanatory! Love it 😍
Wow this review is absolutely great :) The explanations, the camerawork, the animations, your personality... everything is on point! You also took the time to test the product before making your video...\nThank you so much for teaching me so much in one video🌹! Your make-up doesn't look as cakey as on other Youtubers as well. I know not how to apply make-up properly, and you are obviously very talented. So you just won a new subscriber ^.^
THIS IS HELLA BOMB😍😍 I LOVE U ALISSA❤️❤️❤️
Seriously the best review, love love loved it, now for Aunty Jackie to drop hers and I shall consider buying lol.
I love that you give techniques of how yo do what you do! Many don't do that but this is so key for us learning! Thanks!
Your swatches are probably the best I've seen! Excellent intro to the products, girl!! Thank you :)
I Swear You and Arnell Are Just The Cutest Yet Fiercest Ever! Ugh I LIVE For You Guys and Can Just Watch You Guys All Day!
Best review! This woman is f*****g gorgeous!
This is the best and most well-thought out review of Fenty Beauty that I've seen! #newsubbie👏😊
Thank you boo you are absolutely amazing... and a great teacher. So beautiful 😍
How does it work for skin types ? I have dry skin and I don't want to risk dry patches coming up because of the Matt finish
so glad you did a wear test, i don't think people know how important that is!
Loved this review. So detailed
I've been rocking with you and your sister for the longest on here lol...I think what makes a huge difference in this review in comparison to others is that you don't downplay the product because of your preferences. People have said many things over reviews you've made but you've been honest and the same Alissa in every video. Even if the product didn't work for you. Thanks for being 100 across the board with products 😊
Wow! I love that brush technique. I will try it next time!
Your video quality is giving me life girl..
You showed different ways to use the match stixs, bravo 👏
Wow, that's professional as f*ck!! Love it 💕
Best review by far!!
She is the most stunning girl i have ever seen
You killed this look....you made everyone els look like amateurs!!!!! Gorgeous
Best review I've seen. You look gorgeous. Makes me want to buy more Fenty!!
So pretty, but I could not get away with that much highlighter. I'd look like a glow worm.
Please share what lashes you wore! They look soo good on you
I love ur video layout...ur a true pro :)
Gorgeous look! Im so excited to get some of this line. My paycheck can't come quick enough
I've waited for this review I am so at peace rn
Gorgeous look! love how much u experimented with the products
you're literally our mother
I hope RI sees this
Why does it looks like a giant patch of unblended bronzer on one side of your forehead
+Alissa Darrrrrrling, will you be my friend?  Absolutely gorgeous, absolutely!  You are so cool, (at least through the screen)  When you come through NJ/Philly area let me know so I can bring my daughter to get a class from you, Thank you.  Blessings
Everyone needs to watch your technique before putting on trophy wife. MOST youtubers are going wayyyyy too heavy handed and ruining their look because they don't respect the power/pigment of trophy wife
you never disappoint girly. love this 💖
Wow, Alissa, wow!! I watch your videos consistently so I am aware of your format. But after watching many reviews on the launch, yours truly stands out as informative and professional. I so appreciate all the work you put into everything you do.
Thanks for the review, Alissa! ❤️
I literally skipped over everybody review until you uploaded yours !
You're so beautiful!
This is by far the best review I have watched. Loved it!💖
thank you so so much for these amazing videos, i can see the amount of time and effort you put in. i have the same skin tone as you, so your videos are always so helpful to me. you are so beautiful btw.💖
Yours is The best Review Yess to the editing Sis 💙💙💅🏾
Alissa both of the looks you created were amazing! Thank you for this review and for taking the time to perfect the technique for these products. Can't wait to try trophy wife the way you suggested! Best tutorial on YT!
💜💜💜💜 all the products... but it's sooo gorgeous on u Alissa, thx for the review #snapfam
This was the best review online!
I did 5 years of college and I learn more from one video of yours.
Wow your editing skills are Amazing, Alissa you are so talented 😊😙
This student took notes, love the review!
This look sooo good , the highlighter color job is on point¡¡¡¡
Some of your close ups in the video got me tripping thinking you swapped places with rihanna lol
I can't stop watching reviews! But I do love that you took your time tested prior, as well as utilized how you normally would do makeup. honestly I loved the detail and thoughts posted too. So going to try the matchsticks afterwards and try your method, thanks <3
Love the editing and overall quality of this video!!! Great job :)
I waited forever for this video. So professional and you didn't cake on the makeup like most other beauty gurus. This line is for natural makeup not instaglam looks. I don't think there's anthing wrong with a super fill look but I hate seeing youtubers use this line incorrectly and then fuss over it as if it's the line's fault and not their lack of skill.
Your positivity is just BOMB 🤗
Gurlllllllll subscribed 👌🏼😍
U look unreal 😍😱
You're gorgeous & I adore your attitude ❤️
THIS IS A MUFFCKING REVIEWWWWWWWWW !!!!! YASSSS , PUSH TRHOUGH Alissa !!!!
love your eye look
Love your videos
So Dope! Love it!!!!
Absolutely stunning
Wow....Best review!  Beautiful 💕
Anyone know what lashes she used lol
I love youuuuuu Alisssssssa❤️❤️❤️
This presentation is EEEEEVERYTHING!!!!!!! 😍😍😍
You're sucha beauty
YOUR QUALITY HOLY SHIT DUDE 🔥🔥🔥
Can you tell us the name/brand of the brush you used to contour and highlight, please?

Omg he looks and sounds SOOOOO different,looks different at least
*Little sailors where you at?*
Some people are better fat
Wooow, I can really relate to the song...its so sad if you keep giving someone many chances everytime they mess up, they eventually no longer see That value in you in their lives, they just tag you along so that when they need you they will know where to turn to....But on the other hand they dont know that Every time they walk out, the less you love em.... Just lastweek I was actually laughin when I realized that my gf messed up again, and I just decided to just cut ties with her for good.Then when I heard this song I was like damn  Thats me...
Uh!... chills in my entire body . #Perfect
WOW Absolutely AMAZING I like it no I LOVE IT

You lost weight too much .
My fist time having sex was like my first time riding a bike. My dad was holing me from behind.
I just wanted to see the face of the guy Sam was hugging
Why would anyone dislike this?
WHAT A SONG...
Too Good At Goodbyes or Perfect ????
im not crying you are
Is that Sam Smith in the video!!!!!😲😲😲😲
Im just waitingfor the day Adele and Sam Smith record a song together!! LORD OMG
I'm not crying, you're crying
He's lost too much weight 😢😢
I wasn't expecting something less than this my amazing Sam Smith... Very beautiful video, although heartbreaking...You're becoming better and better every single day!Love you!
sam is the male version of adele
Why am I crying. Wtf. I was literally just dying over baby fail videos
this song is still sad even the music is pop
All the feeeelllssss! 👌 love you Sam! ❤
Another awesome artist that don't even need instruments and just belts out the tunes.Nice ✌👍
His music makes me want to fall in love and get my heart broken so that I can relate to it 😍 his voice is angelic and beautiful
I really hate the one minute intros/silences at the beginning of music vids these days
He looks so good 🌻
this song makes me want to friendzone my dad
so powerful.
If he looses anymore weight he’ll end up looking like Mike Skinner from The Streets.....
he looks like an egg
This song is amazing!! Lol  definitely have hit the replay button over 100 times!! Feeling even sadder now though lol
Ow! You look so different.
This dude got skinny, grew a stubble and now is depressing af
what happened to you, sam :((
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Still getting that gay vibe from him
The moment I had to say goodbye to a special person concided with the release of this song. It touches me like, a lot. I was too afraid to take any steps in my relationship. I was afraid that he may leave me, or all these feelings may be too soon to happen. So I chose to step back. I chose not to get too close to him. And now I lost him, even though he had never been mine. It's time to say goodbye. If he can read these words, I want to say: Babe, I'm sorry for everything that I've done. That's all my fault. For letting you go. Wish you happy with your girl. I'm sorry.

He looks thin now.
I'm not into this Gay music bs.
I swear like 100 of these views are mine... \nReload...Reload...Reload
i really want a sam smith album where half of them are hardcore love songs and the rest are heart-renching break up songs.
Sam took some drugs and when to rehab and came back with another platinum record.
So emotional as usual
He looks horribly ill now. I much prefer old Sam Smith. You are much better well-built instead of damn skinny as now. Why do all people prefer to be skinny eventho it doesnt fit them? 😰😰😰

1 Billion Views Let's Do This Mixers and CNCO Fans💖
i don't know there names but the one at 00:14 has really beautiful eyes😍😍
there is 4 girls and 5 guys. how are they to split.
This is so amazing, I'm sooo proud of my girls😍😍😍😍💗💗💗💗
Love u Little Mix. Keep it up girls don't forget girl power.💋❤😘😘
there is 4 girls and five guys. which 2 guys are going to share girl
what if they made a part 2 ??
WHY ARE THERE NO LEIGH COMMENTS IM TRIGGERED
You know how there's always one average looking one in a group of friends? Yeah, so what the fuck happened to Little Mix!?😥😍😍😍😍
i need English sub....
They all look great but...this song is so fun to dance to, I expected more than just passing roses and letters from table to table. Little Mix usually make better MVs than this tbh. There should've been so much more dancing 😭
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE BEHIND THE SCENE
I NEED TO KNOW WHO IS WHO THOSE DAMN BOYS
Leigh-Anne and Richard Camacho would be such hot couple😍\nLike if you agree
YESSSSSSS LOVE YOU LITTLE MIX AND CNCO❤️❤️😭❤️❤️
who is that black leather jacket guy with studded ears. Damn he hot
They didn't come to play games ! This video is fire ❤️❤️😍😍
Too lit🔥 I'm burnt. Dead-ed.
im laughing those guys look like kids compared to the girls
I love this song sO much!! What a great collaboration~
They need to write a song with ariana grande 😍😍
Its strange the two bands dont have any scenes together....were the videos shot separately?
I'm so loving this video.\n\nPerrie- She is like a goddess here. How can someone be so perfect. Really a jem.\n\nJesy- Looks like a perfect Latino girl. All those jealous people making fun of her body, are visually impaired and born fools.\n\nLeigh-Ann- Loving her dress and make-up. Definition of the word 'class'.\n\nJade- Nothing to say. She has already said everything with that crown on her head. That crown is shouting, I am a queen, bitches.\n\nLittle Mix- The definition of perfection and beauty.
i don't like the vedio clip it's so usual from little mix
JADE is like Princess JASMINE
Love this song 💜 wish the both bands danced salsa 💃 together !

CNCO & LITTLE MIX IS BEST
Bueno para mi opinión estuvo más o menos porque nose pero siento que le faltó algo pero todo lo demás está bien
4 million in one day? Wow that is Really low😂
THOROUGHLY DESERVED!!!!!
San Junipero is so fuckin dark...EVERYONE dies at the end and it's the happiest episode of the Black Mirror series 😂 \nI love the show.
Awesome!! Best episode of Black Mirror.
Love Charlie, Screenwipe, Newswipe, Yearly wipe, Dead Set, How TV ruined your life, amazing guy.
Black mirror is amazing. San Junipero is by far not the best episode but i happy to see he won a award for the series.
Am I the only person who thinks that San Junipero is the worst Black Mirror episode
Why is a video with 5.7k views on trending?
The Final True High-Quality Anthology Series To Win An Emmy!!!!!!!
I still get chills from San Junipero's ending. Its so well done! Best ep of season 3 imo
Why is there a big fuck off video link right on his face??
Brilliant! Well done Charlie.
San Junipero is overrated
I never understood the buzz behind San Junipero maybe i need to watch it again
loved this episode but i think shut up and dance was the best episode of this season
damn, i love him so much
What's the song playing in the background while he walked up to the stage?
Worst episode of the series, was dogshit, what the fuck, is this just for the sake of diversity?
I love how happy Seth McFarlane is hearing Charlie has won
Charlie is the only real one there.
Absolutely deserved, one of the best episodes of Black Mirror 👏🏻
HE FUCKING DID IT, YES!
that episode was shit like all the other american ones
This is probably one of the lowest quality videos I think I've ever seen.
Wtf is with the stupid ad in the middle of the screen IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPEECH!!!
Shut up and dance was by far the best
San Junipero is too uplifting - other episodes were far more deserving. Maybe they just picked it because it had the gay shit in it, idk.
360p video 20 FPS recorded with a screen recorder. = Trending.
*****Nice Video*****\nDo you need a website ...\nhttps://www.fiverr.com/soohag/create-professional-website-as-your-requirement#!
First time I've ever seen Charlie Brooker sincere
You can never tell whether or not Brooker is being sarcastic
Mouse pointer and I-Bar cursor. C'mon man for such a short clip stop and redo it.
The bar has truly been set low.
I'd love this to be watched by him on 2017 Wipe

good
He'd better not stop doing Screenwipe it's the best show of the year.
Prick
nice
Not the best, but congratz
Worst episode of black mirror. Only won cause it was about lesbos. Progressive virtue signalling shits
How's this 4th on training
Best episode of black mirror!!
Mouse pointer and I-Bar cursor. C'mon man for such a short clip stop and redo it.
seth looked very happy it won
Dear The Real, it is super tacky to have 3 clips of less than one minute covering the same topic. It is annoying to your subscribers. Just have one clip. We don't need teasers, just upload it when it is ready like Wendy does.
Seriously, when are the Real going to start uploading the whole thing?? This may be a shocker for you but not all of us live in the US....😒
Where's girl chat?!
No one should support R kelly period stop funding this child molestor
#PettySexxy# 💁💁💁\n They barely seem compassionate for this young lady. They just want the tea for views 😒
God forgive me but after watching the whole interview, I do not believe this girl. She mentioned his friend having her number that's how she got invited then later on says R.Kelly got her number at the party. Why didn't he have it from his friend? Also cell phones weren't allowed but yet she was able to use a cell phone? Another thing she was 15/16? Then what was she doing going to his trials shouldn't she have been in school? Where were her parents? All she mentioned was they looked for her but come on who let's their kid go missing on not report it... Im sorry but The Real is so dramatic and acts so conern but how did they not pick up on those little details??
Okay, don't come for me, but I just have some honest questions.\n1. Where the hell her parents\n2. Why the hell she even signed up for this\n3. Did she get kidnapped or did she sign up for this\n4. Why the hell if she got a cellphone, she aint call the POPO\n5. This topic is important, but why it gotta be the FIRST interview of the new season, so depressing lol :(
This is sooo sad. Didn't know there were allegations of abuse. He is sick. I don't think he is fooling with anyone under 18 anymore due to his past situations. However he still has a house of young women under his control. It's sad that young women allow themselves to be used this way for a Louis Vuitton bag. \n\nHopefully this brave young lady can shed some light on these stupid girls by sharing her story on how bad a situation like this can get fast\n\nI love yous and shopping sprees to being choked and spat on. \n\nNo real man is going to respect you if you whoring yourself out. The demands will become more and more extreme.\n\nBe smart.
When you're 16 you know not to say okay to everything.  I feel sad for this little girl but just because there're celebs you don't agree to do everything for them.
R Kelly is sick. Why isn't he in prison?
She seems like she is lying through her teeth.
They disgust me #thefake
Spilling all the tea ☕🐸 it's a palm tree of shade. 🌴
the audio really bad...the background noise..damn please audio team...dont do us like that for the entire season
these 4 are really bad interviewers. they really don't know how to ask questions. \nseems like loni wants to laugh.
I wished the hosts asked a little more questions . Poor Tamera looked so disturbed and concerned ..
Something is off with this girl. Her parents know all about R.Kelly and they let their 16 yr old be with him. This is all for money.
I see The FAKE is back!
This girl is stupid. You volunteered yourself and you being 16 and saying okayyyy to everything is just dumb.
Thats sick R KELLY gross pig🐷🐽🐷🐽🐷🐽🐷🐽🐷
What the hell is this?!?!?!?
Ok she knew what she was doing was wrong tho? She said it she felt uncomfortable. I'm sure she was scared but if some random ass person tells me to get naked I'm not going to if I don't want to. Yes she was 16 but at 16 you know what the hell you doing .. what r kelly did was wrong nonetheless I am not condoning his actions but still I feel like she's saying all this to make herself known
I hate when people say i was just a teen, that means you are old enough to know right from wrong. She knew R Kelly was a pedo, but he is rich & famous so she wanted to be with him now she wants to play the victim.
Truth is... R kelly is still not guilty and these allegations haven't been proven. She could be making this up...who knows.
That bitch lying she was fucking before she met kellz
Yes this sad for him, but am I the only one thinking she looks ridiculous as well? At 16 I would've known to leave immediately!!
im early where's You Tried It! with the funny comments?
Let's exposed that DNA trash!!! .... Tanks the REAL For  R E A L topics and issues!!!
How did he find her though ??
What the hell is wrong with R.Kelly...
Why would he choose this ugly ass ain't germima looking chick to train him sexually?
At 16 you definitely know what take off your clothes leads to.
1. How old is she now because she still looks under 18. 2. Where were her parents?
Please let's stop listening to his music and not fund this child molester. We have to protect eachother, our children and young women from these predators who think they can get away with everything because they have some money! Cut his paycheck! We need to unite and take care of eachother.
She's telling portions of the truth,  that's why she passed the lie detector test. She must be very ashamed of herself. Embarrassing, to let herself be used like that.
So nobody notices everytime they need a distraction in the media a new story comes out about rkelly right when everybody is trying to find out what happened to Kenneka Jenkins
I was sitting here watching this on tv and I get a notification that this channel has uploaded this same conversation. All that speed and STILL no girl chat. Why Sway? You know damn well half of us are mostly here for girl chat. Stop playing.
I agree with the comments post the whole episode more people would be able to watch
didnt kells tell this bitch to keep it on the downlow?
I don't get it. Is R. Kelly's music hypnotizing these girls AND their parents like the Pied Piper or what? I mean come on. Are these girls under eighteen? Then how are they with this older man?//I think some the parents are pimping out their daughters for economic relief.//It's not far-fetched. There have been cultures who sold/gave their daughters to men with wealth to ease the family's financial burden. Sad but it happens.
The fact that they never post the full interviews like Wendy does is extremely annoying to me. Not everyone records the show, has time to actually watch the show while it is on, & not everyone lives in the USA😒 Really about to loose a fan over this bs
You guys are given her a voice. Thank you!
didn't she lie and say she was 18
WHO ARE HER PARENTS?
I thought she was talking about when she was like 6 but 16??? She knew exactly what she was doing
this is disturbing all around. Also, I know it's not entirely bad to be skeptical but I don't understand why some of us are acting like being naive while you're in your teens is so unbelievable... Unpacking and trying to find loopholes in her story although she comes off as very sincere here when this man has been proven to prey on young girls. Anyway, now I understand why my mom was seemingly overprotective with us..
I feel bad for her. People are blaming her but she was A CHILD. Had it been a White 16 y.o the whole world would have criminalized R.Kelly. But I see all of these comments who come from minorities and I feel disgusted. This might happen to your child!
I was reading the transcript, and her statements literally made no sense...so I came for the video.\n\nI don't follow this statement, but maybe it's just me...\n\n“I went out there to his tour bus and you have him naked and you have her naked. And I’m looking like, ‘OK, what is this?Because Rob [Kelly] is the one who took my virginity, so I was like, ‘What’s going on?’\n\nDidn't follow here either...again, could be me...but I recall that she said that R Kelly took her virginity...however, she said that she engaged in sexual activ... y'know what I don't know. \n\nAnd he said, ‘Don’t worry about it.’ I guess he saw that I was looking uneasy. I wanted to know what am I doing. That’s when he told me to look at her and [said], ‘She’s going to teach you everything you need to know. She’s going to please you.’ He told me to remove my clothes.” That's when Pace engaged in sexual activity with the female trainer.
WooooooW..... Wasn't expecting nor ready for This Type of serious interview. I need to see the full interview.
Underage teens aside... I think R Kelly is on to something. Gotta listen to his albums again
Feels like it's over...
Where are here parents? Did  they appear on the show with her? Did they get paid off by him to keep her? He needs to be jailed. If they were white girls he'd be in jail already.
They need training on how to interview ppl, especially with sensitive topics like this
I'm sorry but this could not have been me. Luckily at the age of 12 I was already super aware of these kind of dangers... At 16 you should not be this naive. Everybody's different but I personally would never have put myself in this kind of position. I went to many concerts but doing a meet and greet or saying yes to invitations like these was never for me because of reasons like this. Everyone knows what happens backstage with (what seems to be a lot, if not the majority of these kind of) male artists.. \nI hate that she had to go through all of that though. It takes a lot of courage for a young woman like her to speak out about this and raise awareness
Y didn't any of the women on The Real question her about y would she exchange phone numbers with a full grown man and she was underage never alone going on his tour bus or even coming to a party and parading back and forth in a bikini for him she's not that naive I think she knew exactly what she was doing she was really going for the money Point Blank Period
I don't know how to feel about this. Why would her parents let their 16 year old daughter be in the hands of R Kelly? Everyone has knowledge of what happened with Aaliyah, so why would any parent risk their daughter being put in the same position. Also it's not the girls fault, but at 16 and as a teenager that's when you voice your opinions. Most 16 year olds are out spoken, and if they don't agree with something they say it. So if she didn't like doing that she could of voiced her concern, and did everything she could to get out of the situation, to leave faster than she did. I also felt her story on how she got out seemed to easy. She spent so many years there trapped, so how did she leave so easily? Parents shouldn't put their kids in the industry so fast because it's home to the devil. I hope R Kelly gets what is coming to him.
Did he pee on her?
You enjoyed it and you wanted to be with a multimillionaire RnB superstar. Stop the hypocrisy, you were there by choice despite your young age. Actions have consequences
This is very Wendy William s
so for this season the clips are going to be even shorter? Cool, unsubscribed!
This is what happens when you don't have a father figure in the home to guide you about men.
Rkelly ain't nothing but a freak, but hello u got older women who probably don't mind, doing this...but she is young, but some of these girls are fast too🤔
STOP SPREADING RUMORS ABOUT MY BOY R.KELLY
Tamera and Jeannie look great 😍
these b****** is so fake now and days that kills me this girl sitting here lying knowing that she wanted to engage in everything or else she could have left and she would have been replaced we all know this you don't think R Kelly has literally thousands of girls who will love to be his sex slave come on people wake the fuk up😡😡😡💯
Omggggggg Jeannie brought back the dark hair and I can't she looks so amazing !!!!!!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I thought the kids were 12 thou cld be mixing them up with Micheal Jackson rumors. I'm not great with celeb gossip lool. Dunno why he put that much effort when girls were already throwing themselves at him but okay
The ladies look so gorgeous, like omg. But can they stop throwing so many questions at her? Like damn, she has been through so much trauma. I can't imagine being pestered like that. Give her space to feel comfortable and talk. Let her open up on HER own terms.
I'm really confused. I hope they upload the entire interview in one piece.
Random & I could be wrong...but it looks like she wearing some of that Fenty Beauty Trophy Wife..I guess she had to get right for TV....
No I didn't forget about the other pretty ladys on there it's just she the reason I watch the show.  Miss L
Stfu she was 16 if u never been in a situation like that then again stfu. U have no clue how scary it is. She was scared she went along cuz she was scared. She 16 with 3 people in a room with a hidden agenda. Wtf why is rkelly still on the streets. Some stupid bitch talken about she like it. When u got 3 sick fucks in a room hello it's called survival mode
Enjoyed the New Real! Keeping it realer!. My favorite 3ladies Lonnie Tamara and Jenny Mai. Luv the Show .
Also well done The Real on sourcing her as a guest!
Lying ass bitch

Girl ⛔🙅lying 😂😂😂
boo hoo.
R Kelly is a pussy boii... period
She a ho
Whole interview pleaseee
Post full episodes please!
Hoes looking for excuses for their hoeness. You was 16 when you made that decision, you was looking for a come up instead you made him bust a nut. Smh...
She's ugly.
I can't wait for the longer clips. Is she supposed to be the young girl R Kelly peed on???
Wow
😱just grabbed my invisible pearls
oh lord
Strong Women !
Ok sis...
This heifer lieing they dont even believe her bullshit.
I applaud this beautiful queen.  She has the courage to speak out against this sick pedophile.  Black people still buying tickets to his concert and everything.  YOU ARE ENABLING A PEDOPHILE.  He rapes are young black girls, and you pay to go see him in concert.  What is wrong with you people??  SMDH.  I hope he rots in hell.
I'm not sure why she acting like a victim. U proactively went to the tour bus. U stayed when u saw two grown ass people naked. Then u let the check freak you out. Then stuck around to get it on with Rkelly. She knew and we knew at 16 what was right or wrong. Stop the bullshit. But yes. Rkelly is a sick bastard. Lol
How is R.Kelly not under a jail
This man should be locked away. Unbelievable.
Her dates arent even matching up... in 2008, she would have been 13-15.... Her parents didnt say somethin...🤔. AND i know there are adults who know better and still prey on young girls like her.... BUT THIS ISNT ADDING UP TO ME... somebody is lying... Robert Kelly really needs to handle his business and get some help
Do not shame her, shame him. He was an adult who chose to engage is sexual activity with a minor. That makes him trash, that makes him wrong, and that is 100% his fault. Its irrelevant if she agreed at first. HE IS STILL AT FAULT. THIS IS WHY MEN ARE TRASH.
Never forget what Corey Feldman said about theses Hollywood pedos..they are the top stars with money!
lil whores wanted to get paid. Selling themselves to grown men for money. Teen girls prostitutes all the time. Don't get mad now lil bitch, you knew what you were doing and you knew what you wanted and you sucked and fukd for it!

hab schon Besseres von ihm gehört
Can't wait for the album. Bjork has been a lifetime favorite of mine.
She lost the path. Boring.
Thank you, Mother. You came back to save 2017. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
CHILDREN WE'VE BEEN BLESSED BY MOTHER GODDESS! BEHOLD HER GRACE!
Absolutely stunning in every sense. This video somehow manages to throw a lot more depth and power in to the song. If you hated her last four albums (Medulla, Volta, Biophilia and Vulnicura) now for their sparseness or overall lack of conventional pop melody I think you're flogging a dead horse by this point and being a tad ridiculous. I for one never wanted a lesser version of Post or Homogenic every album. I had my doubts on first listen because of the repetitive lyrics, but this is incredibly hypnotic, and I'm really excited to hear Utopia now. Easily her best music video in the last decade too and that's saying something.
I have no idea what I just saw but it is undeniably Björk. I'm so curious to know what the rest of the album is like.
I'm still in love with her and her music, can't wait for the album !!!
I have to recognize this is a different level of music which is kinda hard for me to understand but I like this song tho.
My wig is in ICELAND
RAVE MOTHER, ETHEREAL DANCE, OPERA OF THE UNIVERSE. THANKS!!
I want to go to her planet
I feel like I'm in space
I'm here for this gucci dress
I need this more than ever 💜
Everything that anything could hope to be.
Yes!! Bjork is showing that when we create from love from the heart and take care of one another...The Gate of loving light opens the heart and love grows exponentially.  Just wow! These are the energies I've been feeling coming into the planet.  The rainbow opalescent light frequencies from the heavens. ✨💜💫
She is the Devine.
How creative and lovely.  Can't wait for your next piece of art.
SHE JUST KEEPS SURPRISING ME...LOVE HER FOREVER!
I know I'm probably putting too much depth in this, but the homunculi look like they have her same dress(shoulders at least).  Is this song about loving and caring about aspects of yourself but also making sure those aspects also 'care for me'?  As a side note I kind of want to replay Child of Eden again for some reason now. :D
Feeling like flying, like being out of this world, like dying and getting back to live again....This Godess named Björk is the only one who causes all of those feelings and more on me with her music...
Is this last episode of Sailer Moon the reference for this video ? https://youtu.be/UnOEmTbSVxg?t=13m1s
All is.full of.love is still.her best video....
As always, Bjork is ahead of the time. A masterpiece.
experimental electronic vanguard ....she's the best ....a genius !!!   <3   <3   <3
is this what DMT is like?
dying, being reborn and then dying again
she never fails what a goddess
WHY I LOVE THIS SO MUCH?
I hate those here before this goes mainstream coments, but this time I wish they were true because I know that good music like this never goes mainstream.
She's not human.
It's an amazing song, you can clearly hear Arca's touch.
Time to add the Bjork genre in music awards. It's way overdue.
The legend is back 😍
Look Lady Gaga this is the way you are supposed to do it...This is the real shit!
The fuck, why is this trending? Might as well dress up as a fucking lamp and snort Kellogg’s then dance around for 3 mins. Easy money
*Tf is happening ughh first these chinese guy song trending on 2 and then a this shit too what in the world is wrong with youtube* !!!!!!!   The entire trending page is wasted 😩😩😬😬😬😬
After the painful wound on her chest (vulnicura), she now transforms all that light into a beautiful prism that heals her wounds and makes her happy.
don't watch this when you're high
4 minutes in and I'm still waiting for the music to start...
I love Björk to death, but she desperately needs to distance herself from Arca.
I want to watch this movie
I miss the old days when her music was just awesome tunes and every song wasn't an experimental art piece. Sorry.
I am a \n\nMan\nWoman ✅\nOther\n\nLooking for\n\nMan\nWoman\nMy wig because of björk✅\nOther
So boringgggg :(  I don't like the song. Where are you bjork?  And I hate the refrain care for you 1 million time. Sorry, I want to see violently happy or alarmcall or joga. So much better .
Remember when she made actual music?
Wow. This is the meaning of ART. Congratulations to Björk and Andrew Thomas Huang
listened to this while playing Vangelis- Rachels Song in another window... I'm obsessed

Esto es realmente arte musical como visual... ¡me encanto! Björk eres una gran visionaria... una verdadera artista.
Verlo y sentir que algo se desdobla también en ti.
Mis palabras no son absolutas pero cuando terminé de ver el vídeo capte un mensaje....  Este vídeo es sobre AMOR, pero no un amor normal, sino uno más trascendental y espiritual, amor que para nosotros los humanos es el más difícil de obtener y dar... El AMOR hacía uno mismo.
Quisiera que existiese un botón que no fuera ni me gusta ni no me gusta, que fuera más como me cae bien, pero aún no la digiero/mi cerebro no ha procesado/dado un veredicto, yo qué sé, esto es un martirio.
Me recuerda a mi trip con Salvia Divinorum xd
Si el amor fuese tangible, se podrían percibir estas figuras luminosas y salvajes llegando a su hogar.
The video is givinng All is Full of Love teas... The song? It's shite. ARCA sucks ass.
I vaguely remember this chick when I was very young. Just recall thinking she was a weirdo. I remembered correct.\nGoing all goofy doesn't make you an artist. How she ever got signed etc must of been some divine miracle of a drunk man.\nLiterally not an ounce of talent.\nLAME.

Morty has changed a ton this season. He is becoming more like Rick.
I have definitely noticed a slight change in how Rick treats Morty than how he used to treat him in the previous seasons. He used to treat Morty with absolute distain but kept him around because he was a sort of cloaking device for Rick. But over the seasons, I've noticed that Rick is showing more care towards Morty and even the rest of the family, even though he tries his hardest to make them believe he's just using them for something when he saves them or he just didn't feel like having one of his grandkids die. I once heard a quote from a certain tv series that goes, When people see good, they expect good, and I don't want to have to live up to anybody's expectations. I feel like Rick actually does want to show more care towards his family, but his rude and demeaning nature would just butt in unannounced and hurt his family more, than if he just was cold and demeaning 24/7. That's just a theory, but let me ask this one question: why would Rick show any moments of concern to his family or anyone if he truly didn't care about anyone or anything? Why would he even care to act like a loving grandpa who loves his grandkids sometimes instead of just treating them unkindly and calling them names like normal? Wouldn't that be easier for him? There's also the theory that since he's lonely, he just wants company and is manipulating Summer and Morty to come with him on adventures. But he could just have Noob Noob , Mr.PoopyButthole, or any other creature come with him on his adventures...so that's something to think about.
It was originally going to be called doc and Marty.
And ... what about dont care about this shit and have fun.
he is every way, we're watching one of their stories.
Wow this is the first rick and Morty video I've seen that actually brings up some interesting points. Good job
If all ricks are equally intelligent, then it makes them a majority. A norm, to which one genius is unique in his/her own way, a minority. #fukthesencitadel
Its called slight character development...
Take it to the limit why dont you!
I do love this show. First time I heard about it, I thought it was just a cartoon for very young children. Then as soon I heard the swearing, I was like WOW... OKAY... THAT HAPPENED.
Thought this would be about from the first few episodes to the first fucking god awful wubba lubba dub dub
bipolar in a way
so is he mexican or what
I think Rick is changing but so is Morty. From the series start we slowly watch Ricks care for Morty and the family go from 0 to 10 while Morty does the opposite.
I'm surprised they didn't mention Rick's treatment of Morty in Meeseeks and Destroy after he finds out what happened with King Jellybean, and how he subsequently shoots him out of sight of Morty
1:22  3:13  I dont remember such episode. Who knows what it is? Thx
He's a one-line joke. Please stop trying to read more into it.
You only have 5 seconds to stay alive!! 😬😬🚀👟 https://youtu.be/Rusn8Bu4qyU\nTurn it up nice and loud 🎼🎧🥁😄
The fan base of R&M is bad, you are the people that ruin the show
I thought rick always cared about his family, he just doesn't show it to them
i knew i didnt want to watch this show for a reason
We're not going to talk about how Summer went from annoyed teenager in season 1 to badass that saves Rick and Morty both daily in season 3?
Like my latest video and I will sub to you
With this close examination of Rick I feel like there is a stong Nietzsche vibe with him: that his family is to God is Dead as he is to the Ubermech, he is trying to find a way to also become stronger emotionally\n (Hopefully this made sense and people can roll with it)
I didnt believe a one word this woman said. Its cause her voice was that similar to a womans
But maybe *_Our Rick Was Shot And Morty Taken For The Machine Morty Torture_* or am I just retarded him yeah probably probably.... the second one
I am in great pain , please help me
I didn't think he did, he's still the same asshole but now he has to be careful of Beth
He has Quantum Emotion that's it.
It's all changed because people think it's cool and original even after a year because they have seen it on Reddit so everyone follows the crowd trying to be edgy etc
How has Rick changed? He hasn't, and he can't. There is one simple fact that is Ricks don't care about my kind. He never has and never will.

Hi guys if u sub to me I will sub to u
rick changed into a woman, or man, or lady man
It wasn't a fake backstory. It was simple rick's reality.
I, for one, do not enjoy having my terry flaps squeezed.
I don't think Rick has said his catchphrase in a while now, which is good :o
It's just a stupid comedy? What is this rubbish?
HoooWeeeeee, clever analytic, but, with some of that (imo) you are wrong !... But i like to point out something interesting that makes the show greatly different (apart from its brilliant creativity) from other ani's like family guy, simpsons & american dad, that are stuffed with gross evil psy that without doubt can induce idiocy in real people as viewing fans emulate the psy & powerful personas, mainly due to the shows/ characters proven popularity's. So to explain this i ask: Who wants be like & do the things of the characters in Rick & Morty ? I''m sure very few will but also i'm sure that many real men can admit to allowing themselves consciously to be 'a bit Peter' on occasions, that also likely proved to be detrimental upon their real personas (speaking from experience). So with R&M all we want  to do is recite the funny catch phrases & continue to be entertained by its bizarre psy fantasy & great art. After watching R&M several times now iv'e come to the opinion that the show has some sort of 'inverted goodness' about it, on occasions in its story lines, such as the Unity story where the kids show disgust (rightly so) at the stinky post orgy, drunk grampa who obviously lost touch with all morality, who then eventually realizes his gross perversion, hanging his head in shame, alone with his self disgust (rightly so)...\nAdditional note: whilst (imo) family guy, simpsons are mostly seriously failing to be funny, american dad,s recent seasons seem to excelling with creative stories & funnies (but of course still have somewhat evil content).
What's the song in the background?
I noticed rick could predict every possible outcome in the future amd always stays one step ahead of everyone but as the series progresses he seems to get caught off guard and losses control of situations like that one crazy mission with morty and the day he had with jerry. Why is that???
He cares. He killed Morty's assualter Mr.jellybean or whatever
I mean...it's not really that original. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Rick and Morty, but this back and forth personality is constant throughout many animated shows.
I love the pickle episode
I thought it was just me who noticed this change
Maybe they are the same person , and it is about caring for himself only a bit?
Are you being controlled by unity and asking this question everytime
rick and morty is just doctor who for registered sex offenders
I'm just glad he doesn't burp after every line anymore.
He is boring now
Lots of emotion v lack of emotion, could be the fact hes an alcoholic >,<

Guys please come and check out the content on my channel because I'm looking to get some subscribers and share what I'm doing with people. I honestly hate posting comments like this but how else are you meant to try and show people what you're making?
Lol, I just watched episode 8 before it got taken down. New favorite episode
Has rick changed or has something changed rick (insert inception noise)
If u subscribe to me I'll sub back
Every show after a few seasons has their characters change.\n\nWriters always take a few seasons to figure out what the characters are ultimately going to be by the end of their run. Watch any show and compare the characters with how they were in the first two seasons to how they were midway through the show's run to the end.\n\nThough this is different from older sitcommy shows since now shows are serialized and ongoing in writing, than stand-alone shows that don't build on a continuous narrative or a growth in characters. So it is more reasonable that he is intentionally changed to show growth.
Rick may not care what other people think but he certainly cares about what his daughter thinks about him. Throughout all of his travels, Rick returns to some version of Beth. He strives for a life with at least some part of her. In the Cronenberg episode, Rick could have gone to any concieveable universe to run away but he chose to go to one where everything is pretty much the same.\nIn the season 2 finale, Rick could have run away on his own or kept living on the run with his family but chooses to turn himself in so he can topple the Galactic Federation and return to the way things were.\nAnd in the Pickle Rick episode, Rick has avoided Beth all day but after Jaguar advises Rick to spend time with his daughter while he can, Rick actually swallows his pride and attends and participates in a family therapy session. This is also one of the few truly happy endings ever seen in an episode.
The new writers are changing Rick in Season 3, he was the same old rick in the April fools episode but he's become completely different after. I feel in the minority that I don't like season 3 so far, its different in so many bad ways.

Holy crap this is still trending. You Christians really do shut everything down on your magic day.
I want you to take your opinion and shove it wayyy up your asshôle
This is the worst, least comical show I've ever seen
*The beginning of the end for Rick was the (burp) portal gun. This gave him two reali(burp)zations. A- There is an infinite number of Earth's with a never ending supply of Morty's, Beth's and so on. 2- Even though there are infinite (burp) realities, he knows (burp) he'll never get back to HIS original reality where his wife is not just a replacement from Guatelawhothehellcares. These two things in my opinion, have completely des(buuuurrpp)troyed his compassion and value for life. Much the same way we value a fudgicle.  If you drop it.. there's another one in the fridge. Hence the conflicting emotions. PICKLE RIIIIICK!!*

*WUBALUBA DUB DUUUUUB!*
This show is shit
looks like perfect illusion and applause have a baby
lol the tune is the same as Rise Up by Jasmine Thompson 😂
It wasn't looove it wasn't looove it was a perfect illusioooon
is the crotch area of his trousers intentionally ripped with holes?!
The most sexy singer❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍❤️❤️😍❤️❤️😌
Was just watching the news and found out he filmed this 5 minutes from my house.... UGH.
love the aesthetic in the vid
his voice, oh im in love
Please give my tracks a listen. I only record using an xbox headset, and need the money for real equipment. Negative or positive feedback accepted.
This is likea flashback to 2010 what
So beautiful T_T I'm crying
Baby you dove into that cold ass Pacific water?
I LOVE YOU NICK!!
I love the song but the music is too similar with #perfectillusion
his voice sounds like feathers I love it
I like the song but don't understand the video
I mean... you can come find me instead
Where to find you
It's looks really similar as Daniel Johns - Aerial Love video
Hey buddy you in london?
Childhood crush is always gonna a huge crush like my crush is nick Jonas
this song makes me so soft, it melts my heart \nluved the music video
Ugh still just as talented and good looking as he was 10 years ago. 😍😍 Even more so now lol.
was I the only one who found his crotch incredibly distracting?
Why is he wearing two jackets in the desert oh he took one off
This was shot in my hometown!
I want to know badly where I can find that hooded sweater...it's awesome. But I never really know where to find you. (But seriously, does anyone know?)
Its so weird because ive been drunk on this beach and basically grew up on the same sand and to see it being recognized for its beauty is amazing
Where can I buy that sweatshirt? 😲
Can we talk about how Nick is driving a Maserati on the beach?! That's car abuse. Poor thing...
Fantastic talent you and your team!
Your Music keeps getting really good to Listen Too💚
A singer not stoned,not having almost naked girls dancing in bg,with no stupid rap or lyrics.\nI love ya Nick❤ and you deserve much more and that day is not far.
My love since 2005😍 he slays my life❤️
I've have always loved him since the Jonas Brothers! ❤ I will forever love Nick 💋❤ we both have diabetes (type one) and I've wanted to meet him and tell him he is my inspiration to keep fighting and to not let diabetes take me down!
Zedd already did a song called Find You. It's much better.
Find You ! so cute as always
It only takes 2 secs to know a good song... 😍😍
I'm right here my boy.
Please answer me one day! I know you see mee
Pause at 3:03 if you wanna make Desktop wallpaper :D
Is he trying to make pants with rips/holes on the crotch area a trend?? lmao
Who keeps on breaking this man's heart?
OH LOOK.... HE BORROWED ZAYN'S CAR FROM DUSK TILL DAWN....... interesting.
I was lowkey hoping this was gonna be a cover of that one camp rock song
Lol still the same theory
Fuck... he's growing out his hair😛
I love This Song. Thanks Nick
I knowed for this song before to be in yt
He has such an incredible voice, I wish it wasn't auto-tuned to this extent. If you look up his live Broadway stuff, his voice is amazing.
OH! I liked. I love you Nick
biggest inspiration ever your amazing nick (coming from a fellow t1d) 😍😍
You were my first celebrity crush 😂❤❤\nProbably up to this day😏
Who is here before 1 million?????
My fist time having sex was like my first time riding a bike. My dad was holding me from behind.
The SONG  , the clip , the lyrics , his moves , the voice ...everything everything such a masterpiece 😍😍😍
Everything he does with music perfect in my opinion.
This is best his song .Very good progress
Hoping you can read this,I like your voice and your music so much. It's unique and great,keep doing what you like
I was better as a fighter ...
I am like dead after first listening, Nick i so, but so underrated!
I'm here before 1M cant believe it
He looks a lot like one of the Jonas brothers. What ever happened to them?
This song has 2010 vibes. It brings memories for SOME reason. It's a great feeling
Jeez where is bear grylls when you need him
Literally I have been watching him my whole life. I basically grew up watching and listening to you. He never has a bad song!!! Love you Nick <3
This might be his best song so far! Love it
Nice bring back the Jonas brothers lol
any rappers, singers, artists ect - check my beats if ya gotta minute, it'd mean a lot!
kinda boring haha

In Russia you attack the terrorists
The Muslims are at it again!
Crisis actors. another staged event, sad people believe the lies there fed
Ok so a bomb goes off on the tube, what do you do? You film the flaming leftovers, not knowing how dangerous it still is.
Let me guess, the lidl bag had mental problems, and suffered from islamaphobia, the bag will be given counselling and a £5000 payout, sadik khan will hail the bag as a hero

How did a burning bucket manage to injure 18 people and spew a fireball through carriages if it couldn't make it past a plastic bucket confused...?
Is that a Galaxy Note 7?
MrShrimpton said it was der Germans.???
The woman who is pointing at the bucket, why is her back splattered with  the milky substance that the bucket supposedly contains and why is she carry a very familiar looking flag with stars, in her hand, was she supposed to be a crisis actor victim and then given another role?
It could be a dildo vibrator that's overheating. That's my surmise.
Such a fake terror event - see Ole Dammegard's work.  This bomb that put so many people in hospital, didn't even throw smut or soot on the adjacent walls, windows or fabric seats of the tube train.  So it can't have exploded or sent fireballs down the train.  It's a shame people got trampled, but this is such a bad hoax.
BREAKING NEWS!!  the bag was completely incinerated, however, the attackers passport managed to be blown to the other side of the cabin from the explosion.... this is the news; we don't lie to you....

That bald dude always looks like he just seen a ghost.
Picture a bunch of zombies walking around at the bottom of a lake. With all the other suspension of disbelief required for the show, why is that a hard concept?
We all know Jon snow destroyed the wall clearly the dragons are cgi fake news
In every scene there should be a guy taking a piss in the background.... 18ct gold Eddie
let's not forget that this season was only 7 episodes, so they're not not going to waste a bunch of time with them travelling, and showing every little thing like them shitting and eating.
My question is where the fuck they got these gaint fucking chains
Seriously though they have hundreds of thousands of Wights and they have multiple goddamn giants. You really think it's that far-fetched for them to pull a fucking dragon out of water. People think way too much into this shit. IT'S A FICTIONAL TELEVISION SHOW!
Eddie bravo go pick up the book, jackass. Fucking jeez the world building us nerds love so much in the books.  Does this retard understand that? Just take the effort and pick up the book or, wax poetic about Chen trails and whatever ridiculousness.
The last two episodes were damn near fan fiction?
Mr. Bravo always on point!
Ok, let me sum up some ideas here.1. The got the ship chains from Hardhome.2. They had some wights or giants get down there and tie the body up.3. Travelling DOES still take a long time, its just they're skipping this time between episodes cuz they got no screentime left for that stuff.
They trolled the water for the dragon. They didn't have to jump in and put a chain on it
They could've easily bring the dragon back to life as a White Walker and swim up or crawl out by itself.
Stop calling her fucking Khaleesi.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  It's a title not her fucking name.  You don't go around calling Jon, King in the North.
they dont go into water in that boat scenen beacause they cant float!. following them does nothing since they would be up in a surface and the walkers on the bottom of the sea/lake,
I don't give two shits what Eddie flat earther Bravo has to say about anything.  He's a complete twat.
If only Eddy could apply this level of thinking to 9/11 and flat earth. Dragon were pulled up with hooks in my mind.
The Wights cant swim but since the dragon was on the bottom of the lake it isnt really relevant, i assumed they just walked down there and tied these chains up, or the White Walkers did. I'm also assuming Eddie is referring to Hardhome where the Night King didnt pursue Jon when he and his allies got to the boat, its common sense a boat is faster than a person swimming let alone a Wight tryin to charge after them.
Even a guy who thinks earth is flat knows how shitty season 7 was.
Friggin idiots. Clearly they haven't given their arguments any thought.\nWhere the chains came from is a good question though.
no they didnt fuck up\nyou are both...ahh fuck nevermind\ni must be drunk to even try to nerd you out
two wights literally tried to drag tormund under the ice when he got knocked down. they cant swim, but why couldnt they just have sacrificed a few hundred wights to get the chains on the dragon. a zombie dragon is worth at least a few thousand regular wights. the time warp complaints are incredibly valid.
they can't swim eddie, they can sink though. sacrifice a hundred undead for a dragon, easy choice.
Khalesi dropping a deuce off the castle lol I'm dying right now
Yeah Eddie was right. I failed to notice that as well... :)
FYI if you read the BOOKS youll see danny is shitting with diarrhea for most of book 1/2 and they explain who is carrying food and where they piss/shit .....ijs seasons 1-7 plot holes will be explained inthe books ....
Debating this TV show like it's UFC fight.
never said they cant get into water just said they cant swim
I have never watched game of thrones and now I feel a weight off my back cuz I will never need to. . . . . I have waited years for a reason not to watch this stupid ass show that everyone wants me to see. . . . . . thank you for explaining to me why I should not bother with this dragon shit in the first place.
they cant swim because they can't float. They aren't breathing so they have no air in their lungs. Dead bodies sink. They float back up eventually due to the accumulation of gasses from decomposition but once those gasses dissipate they sink again. The dead would have no problem getting to the bottom of the lake to chain up the dragon, they just may not be able to get back out.
they don't like water because they can't float. they can still go in the water, they just sink to the bottom
Its not that they avoid water, the wights are unable to swim. They can exist on the floor of the ocean (think pirates of the carribean) they walked the chains down there and hooked the dragon up.\nNothing in the show has 100% established that water does anything to them in terms of magic.
Eddie talks about GoT like he talks about flat earth and 9/11
The whole thing has a lot of issues, and this past season's writing was pretty bad. Not to mention it felt very rushed, HBO must want this thing over and done quick. I guess the show is getting too expensive, or they're wanting to move on to a new series.
eddie bravo just regurgitates info from popular GoT channels on youtube without giving any references. (same with his conspiracy theories)
Eddie. they have zombie giants. Its a tiny lake
so, eddie thinks lifting a dead body would be way harder than lifting a steel body. a dead body has give to it and won't dig in.
I love eddie. He is normal.
Yo, soooooo I love you Eddie Bravo... but damn man! You don't dig fo shit nigga, the chains had been set prior to the event shown in the episode. The Night King has Green Sight and is connected to the Three Eyed Raven. The ambush we witnessed had been layered down by from visions dating back thousands of years, the location of the battle ( abandoned ship ports with it's forgotten boating instruments...most destroyed under the elements or left sunken..  hence the chains left lain below while still attacked to the shore) The time of Jon's arrival, allowing him to leave Hardhome after seeing the first attack. Literally the episode mentioned on the podcast points to the punctual plotting of the undead. When the Night King kills the Dragon with the ice spear shows his ability to easily overcome long distances. Had he not been baiting Jon's known rescuer to some optimal area he could've easily ended Jon along with the rest. Waiting for the Dragons was the point of which reality should set. The Ice King has played those few who've given his threat credit in the realm. The undead are five moves ahead and always have been, those chains laid by the men who manned them centuries ago. Don't stunt on the show, its deeper than most fans would like to go. #10thP4L Still Love Mr. Bravo Tho
The wights went scuba diving and tied them up, the night king just sacrificed a few
Nobody has an imagination anymore. Where did it say that the dead can go into water? If you got a fucking dragon why would you go into the ocean???
Holy shit Eddie, it's been 3 seasons since Game of Thrones made any sense at all. Everyone still watching probably doesn't care about or doesn't notice the plot holes.
Every time I see Eddie bravo the fist two words I click. About this, he's 100% right.
Fuck it Eddie Bravo is my hero lmao I was so pissed that episode 7 was the finale that I didn't even think about the water conspiracy lmao
They don't like salt water. Fresh is cool.
what about the skeleton that fell in the water then rose to the surface and grabbed tormund?
They didn't go into the water because they couldn't reach the boats while walking on the bottom of the lake/ocean. It's obvious they can't swim because bones aren't buoyant. I think any White Walker could also walk down there to chain the dragon, they're strong. They wouldn't send the weak wights/zombies down there to do it.
So we just gon pretend jon snow aint smash.._.. Someone we waited 7 seasons for him to hook up with \nOnly to find out 30 seconds later she was his aunt
How the fuck is this shit on trending? N azis at Google missed a step. Watch how it dissapears.
Eddie is naturally twice as funny as schaub and Joe yet both of them  are making millions as comedians? Its ironic how much better eddie is as a comedian than Joe , Joey diaz, schaub, calen, Ari..  I think because out of all those listed hes the only genuine person.
Well they obviously can get into water since they almost dragged Tormund under....
Why do they want the dumb little shit that nobody else cares about? You wanna know all that dumb shit, read a fucking history book and find out how the Romans did it. Jesus Christ!
They dont swim. They arent afraid of water. Were they going to wade out to the ships? They could have walked right in but for what?
I just cannot stand how none of the main cast wear helmets.
shes gotta fall off once or twice man, just a couple accidents LOL I fucking love Eddie man, this shit is gold.
Bodies can wash up on shore. The Dragon might have.
Yeh they can't swim, the ones the night king sent down there to attach the chains would just stay down there until the power that keeps them alive stops. Just like at hardhome where most of the wildlings became part of his army, he could've sent them in the water but how would he of got them out, he didn't because it would've been pointless.
No no. The walkers can't swim. They would sink to the bottom. So The walkers just jump in and sink with the chain, then tied it down at th bottom.
The chains just sink there is no carrying the chain down there
See how Eddie analyzes it deeply.  That's how you got need to be, instead of being spoon fed opinions by the mainstream media.
Funny how some people are always looking for what is wrong with something instead of appreciating was his AMAZING about an amazing show ;)
It's a conspiracy Eddie!
Undead fish/sharks/whales and about 300 dead whites
Everyone knows White walkers are really into BDSM that's where the chains come from.
nobody gives a fuck why or how they did that whit the dragon, its a fockin tv show.\nand its fantasy too.....FANTASY DUDE
The chain thing is really dumb, let's just start admitting that. We, as audience members (who love the show, if only to enhance this example), can cover up this hole all we want to try and stay in denial that GoT's quality decayed a lot during this season. The one explanation I found convincing is that wights cannot swim, but they may very well dive and do shit, even if they're rendered useless for anything else. It's not like the WW can't spare a dozen or more of their thousands of undead soldiers. I can handle and cover up for the writers up to that point. What is way dumber, fellas, is showing ANYTHING from that scene where the fucking dragon comes back to life so that we know for CERTAIN it will attack the wall at the end of the season, destroying all possibility for tension. Are the writers fucking drunk when they write the show? Who as a big shot Hollywood showrunner would make such a fucking rookie mistake? Dan & Dave, guys. Dan & Dave would, and did.
I looked at the wights like the guys in Pirates of the Carribean. they can walk underwater(dont need to breathe) but cant actually swim
Actually Eddie is right about the getting the dragon out of water. But who cares, when I watched it I wasn't like damn that's unrealistic. I was like uh oh Jon Snow is in deep shit now.
where did the chain come from?
There's only inertia when the dragon accelerates or decelerates.  So when she is just flying constant speed there is no need to hold on too tightly.
So how did Season 7 freefall straight down into it's own footprint??? Looked like a controlled demolition to me bro.
The Night's King must have the same powers as Pinhead from Hellraiser.
Eddie is usually a tool but he is spot on. I thought episode 6 was one of the worst episodes of the series.
they never show her training her grip strength. - God that's funny Eddie
It was the undead giants
They do understand that this is in a magical world that isnt earth IE a mythical fantasy tale, fucking morons.
There's dragons and zombies and zombie dragons. FUCK THE LOGIC
pretty sure the chains had hooks, so you prob could drag the chains through from the edges like a dragnet
im assuming its one of the whitewalkers.
I think they just sink,so they could walk on the lake bed
And why aren't we talking about how the army of the dead would had been blocked by the wall had the humans simply sat back and trusted it?
A hole? Read the books.
Why am I always getting these fucking Joe Rogan recommendations? I'm not subbed to any of this shit. I hate Joe Rogan. The guy is a bernie sanders liberal degenearte.
HAHAHA EDDIE,  WHO WENT SCUBBA DIVING TO GET THE DRAGON LOOOOL
Eddies fucking bonkers some times.. Hes wondering where the food and water is for the Armies like its some impossible task that hasnt been done throughout human history 1000s of times. How do you think the Romans did it.. or the Persians .. Armies have a supply train following.. You can accept Dragons and Zombies but not soldiers stopping to shit in a hole(latrine) they dug.. thats too much of stretch?
Hey bro, you're fucking my high up
Eddie, chill. They can't swim. Sacrifice a few soldiers. Specially when you got unlimited source of soldiers.
You want Khaleesi dropping a deuce? Read the last chapter of A Dance With Dragons.
... they didn't jump in the water to go after the ships because they wouldn't be able to get the ships... and they could and would send some to the bottom where the dragon is even if those getting the dragon wouldn't ever swim back up... no, not buying it. the REAL question is where the hell did those massive, massive, HUGE chains come from? in so short a time, no less.
I thought they couldn't swim, but there was absolutely no reference to them dying underwater... So presumably the army dragged the chains, and some bodies went underwater with the chains and essentially sacrificed themselves (although they probably just walk under water forever) while the rest of the army pulled the chains up. \n\nI don't get how he doesn't see that being possible, at no point did I see the undead being unable to walk under water, I just thought they couldn't swim.
They cant swim, they sink, no lungs to float, they are dead, they can go to the bottom of the water to hook a chain to a horn.. dumb alphas.
The illuminati hooked it up Eddie, come on!
Man game of thrones is so shit it's so full of plot holes it's ridiculous
Keep doubting Eddy
How did they.. How did they? How did they?   MAGIC    \n\nMOTHAFUCKA.
Zombies cannot lift chains, Illuminati confirmed.
0:55 Jayzus, oh shit. Red pilled on that dragon. 😱👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
The giants dummy
Eddie multi level flatearth trolling hard😂 LMAO!
You could drag the chain perpendicular to the dragon and toward his head. Once your underneath his head, you cross the chains over, then pull him up. \n\nWouldn't be easy, or necessarily work the first time, but I imagine they don't have much better to do.
the way he talks is verrrrrrry annoyingggggg
Some of these shiny millennial channels are unwatchable because of the stupid fast, high pitched voice they put on. He's like a fucking robot that's been programmed to annoy. Sounds like 'What's up guys' la la la la la...
The mini is currently the best (legal) way to host OS X in a datacenter. There are even special rack trays for them.   The Xserve is dead and gone.
Why does Austin Evans exist in 2017?
They exist to be used as a server that's small and low factor enough to be on 24/7 running Mac os server since they got rid of the XServe.
I don't know what's worse. The Mac Mini or your front teeth.
You enunciate at all the wrong times in your sentences. Where were you raised?
Hey guys, this is Austin.
As a fan of you and Vsauce,that ending was super cute <3.
And yet a 3 yr old mac is still infinitely better than most pc trash coming out this year.
His shirt matches the HP Pavilion Wave.
Wow, you don't even get a mouse and keyboard.
I bought 30 of them this summer to mount behind large interactive touch panels. I had to beef up the RAM and order them with SSDs just to make up for the extremely dated internals. I have always loved and used the Minis in different types of structured installs, but they are getting to be harder and harder to recommend. There really isn't any excuse for this either. It would probably take Apple engineers less than a month to sort out even just a Skylake compatible board/chipset and toss a few thunderbolt 3 lanes in there for modern connectivity. \n\nAs it is right now, I can only really use these at 1080p or I see terrible overall system performance. They will push 4k resolutions, but they STRUGGLE. C'mon, Apple!
why does austin evans still exist in 2017?
Cool! I want one!!
Hey Austin I'm a huge fan of yours. I love watching your videos to learn new things. I am very interested in learning about computer software and technology. So your videos are amazing. I'm a junior I'm high school and I am very interested in tech but don't have much money for stuff. Do you have any suggestions?
I highly doubt the iPhone X will even lick the 8,700 mark for multicore. I know they are rumors but come on...
I skipped the latest Mac Mini for the 2012 Mini (since it's easily upgradable). I quadrupled the memory and loaded dual SSDs, it still kicks ass years later. Intel graphics but I don't play games anyway, so I couldn't be happier with this system.
i have mac mini and upgraded to 8 gb (2x4gb ram). I watch all steaming . as for hard drive, i backup to  external disk .  had it over 4 years, no issues and no stupid kb monthly rollups from microsoft
Lmao if you never had one, then you won't ever know
Because it's easier to put a Mini where the sun does not shine, than a iMac.
I rlly like the videos,is a good way to pass time.
Hey Guys, this is an Annoy-o-Tron
Without MacInCloud or a similar service or the use of a VM you'll have trouble uploading an app in to the App Store as it's locked down to only allow uploads from Apple Products (officially that is), that's why. I can think of no other reason.
It exists because apple says we need it
I have the mid 2010 model and it still works perfectly fine for me.
To answer your question, it exists in 2017 because it was released in 2017.
Why do you talk like that, it's weird
My school uses these
Why do Why Does it Exist videos exist in 2017?
They use them in school
Lol 500 dollars for an old dual core with 4GB or ram with no ventilation whatsoever.
Thanks for watching?! What happened to see you in the next one?
quick answer to the question: money
i'm watching this on the same mac mini!!
why does Apple exist in 2017
Little Austin... It's here for the idiots, the apple fanboys, and stupid people. There you go Austin.
Why does it exist in 2017? *next year comes* oh shit guys we gotta destroy all outdated hardware so Autis...Austin doesn't ask!!!
Why does Austin evans'S channel still exist in 2017??? :()
Me when he's a logic fan...
I own the latest edition of the Mac Mini. It's got an i5 3.2 ghz, 1TB HDD, and 16 gigs of RAM. I've had it for a while and it serves all my needs. However I don't use it to work with, I use it so that I can connect a desktop and use my TV as a giant monitor. It's for family use, meaning it's being used to watch movies and TV shows every day, with some occasional gaming. If that's all you're into, then I suggest this machine as long as you're cool with using an old machine. Other than that, just get a laptop
Dear every tech reviewer ever, stop comparing Geekbench results between different architectures (ARM/x86), they aren’t comparable.  At least in the way you are interpreting them.
Can you link a Mac Mini to a computer screen only? :0
Is my comment about Austin Evans worth it?
vsauce <3
Curiosity box looks legit
omg the way he talks...Mac miniiiiiii  omggggggg I talk like thiiiissss. videooooossss he kinda sounds retarded no shade
Nerd
What is that
Lik ma bal
Some would say fewer ports lol
Omg the way he speaks lol 😂 miniiiii
Austin Sauce
Sub if your from trending
I hope in the future applllleeee consolidates the mac miniiiiiiii and the mac pro into one unit available in weak to super prooooo
Total ripoff... Hackintosh is the way to goooo
There are rumors of a new one that may be coming out later this year. No details on its specs yet but a new one is needed. Even though the latest ones will work with 4K, they're not great for it. We have a couple hundred at work on 4K displays and they work decently but definitely stutter to keep up when there are large graphics on the display.\n\nSome games have issues for it too.
Is that Logic's record at the back?
Your reviews\nAre Great\nBut man\nYour cadence \nIs driving me nuts
Why do you speak like that?
Apple ahead of their time? Yeah right.
Just buy a 2011 Mac Mini. I bought one used last year for $300, sent it to OWC to add in a SSD drive and it already had 8GB of ram and a 500gb HDD, Runs Final Cut, Photoshop and Lightroom well enough for me to do my client work on. It's my main desktop at home. Even though I have a newer MBP with higher specs, I use that only for when I'm on the go away from my house.
So will this offend anyone's gender?
I have a Mac mini and I just use it as external storage for all the pics my iPhone won't store.
i was literally about to make a video about this, im beyond mad
This guy speaks heaps of bol*ox! I've been using Mini's since they came out. Video editing - no probs. Anything else - no probs.
A gently used mini mac is awesome. I love my last 2. Ive owned three over the years. Virus free always (added value).
Apple is the most overvalued tech company and it doesn't come close
I kind of liked the specs on the 2012 mac mini.  But definitely not worth the 1K+ price tag (used).  My current laptop is a quad core with 8GB ram for about $300.
It exists because allot of people don't need a big machine. Mac minis are a great computer for basic use. I use one as my media centre that I got used and wouldn't trade it for anything.
But can it run crisis?\n\n\n\n\nRead more
...because it fits in a network cabinet.
Feel like a system of this size could be very powerful with the latest gen intel cpus and nvidua gpus. Full desktop versions in laptops, surely they could be used in a system of this size?
I just bought a Mac mini to use as a media server for my home network. It's running Air Video HD & Plex. Super sweet.
Schools, selling it to gullible schools
Why does Austin hey exist guys 2018 in this is ?
Because Apple made it??\n\n\n\n\n\n?
I'm happy with my 2011 Mac Mini, but I don't need much. Web browsing, photos, word processing. And it's got a CD/DVD drive in case I really want to preserve something, like family photos, that will survive a cyberwar. Now, about Mr. Evans' voice, which some here have criticized. It's not too bad, just amateurish. What he's saying is scripted, and if he learned to mark his copy before making it, it'd sound better. He needs to learn to vary his delivery so he avoids things like dropping down on the last word of every sentence the way he tends to do. If he did, it'd make his longer pieces easier to to hear and concentrate on because you wouldn't have the distraction of wondering why he's talking like that.
wait in two year it will be $200 lol
Apple needs to come back to the Desktop game. They have the same old iMac that gets refreshed every couple years, but no major changes or improvements. They have the Mac Pro that is still basically untouched since it's release a few years back. And they have the new iMac Pro coming, which isn't really an everyman consumer desktop like the iMac or Mac Mini.\nI feel like if Jobs was still around, the biggest difference with Apple would be that I'm certain he would still be pushing for everyday computers at an affordable premium. Whereas the Apple we have now just doesn't seem to care about computers anymore, so much as they're all about their smartphones and portables.
Why do I exist in 2017?
I rather choose a Windows device instead. Cheaper and better performance.
When u find out ur pc is worse than the mac.
I think I've found... the most annoying... Youtube channel... on the planet...
When your t-shirt looks like the HP computer...
He ends his sentences like a tv reporter. lol
Trending no. 5 in uk today
When a phone is faster than a mini computer....
Dude my Mac mini doesn't even have a speaker
The MacMini is good for offices that require Macs to run as workstations for employees. That's what is done in the place where I work. \nIt's the cheapest way for the company to get multiple Macs up and running, and because it's a Mac, it can last long, saving the company some money in the long term. The oldest MacMini in the office is the one from 2010 running as a server and it still works well for running basic apps.
Why does it happen? Because it happens. Roll the bones. Roll the bones.
Why do this titles still exist in 2017?
Why are there feminists in 2017?

Hey Vsauce Mac mini here
i love shooting macs, worst computer ever :p
The lip sync seems off
Can u review alcatel u5
LG STYLO 3! $33 DOLLARS
First comment bitches!!
someone should do a compilation of Louis saying Aiight i got a cheeky little coffee :D
13:02. Just beautiful💚💚💚
Get a job
CHEEKY LITTLE COFFEE COUNT: 10234091230491234123412346725367682352231
Woop woop! My home town of Wick!
Love you bro! I want to show you around Sydney Australia !!! Even better, fly into a small coastal airport in NSW called Albion Park and leave the rest to me!! Peace out BOOM!
Have JP review theses video's. You guys are in baller heaven.... or is still on a bicycle in Idaho. https://m.youtube.com/user/streetattractionuk
I got excited as the arrow in the thumbnail pointed to where I live and I was like WoAh you live in Caithness\n\nAnd then he said england.\n\nLies\n\nOnly lies
both planes are awesome in their own ways but if you were in his Bonanza JP and he would be rubbing shoulders anda cpl hundred pounds of useful load would be left home for maybe 3 to 5 knots advantage\n\na Bonanza is lighter on the controls but having owned both types i'll take a Centurion any day in weather and IMC conditions..much more stable
Scotland reminded me of game of thrones scenes
Louis has such a peaceful attitude. Even when they dog on his plane and say little side comments about changing GoPro batteries. If this is the personality of pilots no thanks.
If would love to do this. But you need lots of money to do it.
What part of Scotland is his mum from??
Funforlouis where abouts on Scotland are your mum side from??
will there ever be a place where louis can get just a cup of coffee? wherever he goes the little cheeky one seems to follow
Come to Inverness
Im from dublin!
2 weeks ago
6:19 Guy on the right looks like scout from tf2
Love the beats in this episode!
I'll take some cashews. I like cashews. and then you wip out a banana.  :-)
This is by far my favourite set of vlogs on this channel so far. Pure authentic adventurous content. Keep up this kind of stuff up, don't work yourself too hard and thank you infecting the world with positivity
Great stuff, love that castle!
Their staying at the Norseman hotel because I go there a lot it is kinda expensive but not to expensive it's called the Norseman Hotel in wick
Dude, why are all your coffees cheeky?
Those aircrafts scare me.
Great Vlog Guy's :)
Sightseeing is just a BIT better in a 210 (high wing, no struts) than a Bonanza, Matt!  (But Bonanzas do fly better :) lol)
I want to know whether or not the coffee I'm drinking is a cheeky little coffee or not. I don't know how to tell the difference.
7th on trending bro 😮
Everything about this video is top notch, Great Job!
OMG THE TREE HOUSE SUPER COOL! =)
Simply put this series is legendary.
Nice video man
Is he going to Scotland??
Like if you're from Scotland
Yo i love your vids. Avid follower. Im from London but living in jakarta for a couple of years. Any plans to stop over in indonesia?
loving these vlogs so much! Dont worry that theyre not up to date!! It is not a problem :) :)
That Scottish castle was awesome!
That freaking castle!
i enjoyed this
Great drone footage.
I live in wick.
https://youtu.be/Eupd8Nu1h3o pretty cool from cbs interview with Matt when he flew around the world.
Wow amazing inspiring video. Keep sharing. Love and support!
Yay Louiiiiis!!!! Damn you guys are working hard in this trip, stay healthy!
Brilliant I heard you were in wick, shame I never bumped into you😢❤
Time for Louis to find an editor alot of the other vloggers are doing it these days.
Is it a cheeky little coffee and  a cheeky coffee the same thing?  Asking for a friend 🤓
Louis you don’t have to loose sleep because of us! I personally will wait. Its better to be healthy and sleep so get your rest and do the editing when you have enough rest.
This is really nicely filmed!!!
Thanks for promoting our beautiful country. You are welcome home anytime.
Nice to see the guys smiling in unison! \nGood vibes!\nShout out to the pilot/s ♡☆♡
Really great video guys. Louis really good to see you engage with the camera with some knowledgable rehearsed content, being a lot more like a presenter. In fairness, you did explain you hadn't had much sleep prior to going to sleep on the plane, but this could be a useful time to give some camera feedback even if these are facts that JP and Matt have relayed to you first. Louis seems a lot more upbeat now that he is back in the UK in this vlog. Presumably, as he is now regaining control.  \nWhat amazes me more than anything is how healthy Louis looks yet clearly needs to be healthier. Dude, you sound knackered, lay off the caffeine and do some more exercise you sound like you are in really poor shape dude. The last tip .... never make eye contact when you are eating a banana dude lol!
Why did you leave Scotland in the first? *draws Tesco discount shank from north face puffer jacket*
Just wondering when is Louis' coffee not cheeky and little ahahah ;P
Thanks Louis for making these videos. My mornings be like, yeees, new episode is out. I'm happy for you and your happiness about how you are happy about how you live your live. Motivational and you keep others moving just by being yourself. Cheers
Louis sleep is important. I hope you guys stay a couple of days in a location soon so you can all rest. Love these videos tho. Great series!
freaking out that my little home country is in your video Louis! you should come and visit the Faroe Islands. It's a very special place with unique nature :)
The music remind me of samurai champloo lol
Omg my ex is in this video at 12:45 what a coincidence
I ONLY FOUND OUT IT IS IN 4K NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please do a tour of Scotland and come to Fife 😍 I didn't realise you were half Scottish. We love you 😁
Yoooo most my dads family lives in wick and Thurso I knew I recognised that castle 😄
Louis...you don't come to Scotland enough
Haha, here on my up next video queue there's a video from CBS about Matt's flying around the world.
Pretty cool to see that castle and can't wait to see the abandoned one!
Experience is by far better then 2D sofa riding
wow this is very delayed. Alfie made his vid when you arrived 2 weeks ago. You must be in spain or something idk! xd loving the vlogs
i really cant listen to the flight mic when you can hear everyone... louis alone is fine, but jp and the other dude just hurts in my ears.
Enjoying this epic trip.Can't wait for Africa and Asia...
I love your videos man, if you make your way to China I gotta get you in my vlog!
Fun fact, Matt ended his around the world trip at High Performance Aircraft at Gillespie Field in El Cajon (San Diego), California. I work one hangar away from that and watched him during his press interview when he landed.
Great music for that epic drone shot!
One of the main ingredients in haggis is sheep's lung.  Haggis is banned in the U.S.
Love the 4k, it is worth the rendering time.  It will also help future-proof the documentary.  Keep up the great work!
What's happened? You haven't flown in over a week
OMG!!!  That Castle!!!!   Amazing!!!!  Love these videos!!!!
hello all, come and check us out
Can everyone subscribed to me please I do gaming videos
this is so inspirational - i would love to travel the world some day❤️❤️
Awesome video. Seems like the drone camera is a bit wonky though, horizon is off in all of the clips
Welcome to Caithness. My home county😊😊😊👌👌
Great Vlog bro. Loved that castle.  Don't stress yourself over getting the vlogs online all the time. We're all human and travelling round the world can't be easy - make sure you sleep and get enough rest. We can wait - your health is more important Sir.
I just came across your vlog by accident and you landed in my home town! So cool! A little bit homesick now though 😂 your whole trip looks so awesome, gonna have to go back and watch the rest 😀
why did the route change from islamabad to mumbai?
On my word!!! I agree with Louis that tree house is is awesome! I have never seen anything like that with the trees coming out of the roof. It definitely looks like something out of Lord of the Rings or something. Someday I want to go to Scotland too because I am Scottish as well.
What plane are you flying
Love it! I just started my own vlog, I'd love for you to check it out. Keep up the amazing work!
Oh hey it's the North Korea dude
what are the fuel prices for planes like this ?
Just out of quitosity, why dont we have to wear those dry emertion suits when you are on a comercial flight? Just intrested thats all
why didn't you interview @DaveErasmus for your upcoming Aftermovie ? 🤔
Those suits are cool and so smart your being safe.
Can we all acknowledge how extremely unfit Louis is. Like he is out of for 85% of this video and thats from walking from the plane to the car. Kind of worrying.
Three white males, this triggers me so much. And the way Louis says guys rather than gender neutral people.
Louis spends half the flights asleep, what's the point of flying round the world if you just sleep through it!!
show less of inside of the cockpit and more of the outside scenery...less facetime...!!\nit'll be much better to see the outside scenery than same people talking everytime..\nanyways loving the trip...!
Food for louie
I wish I was a YouTuber? Can I hit 1k before he hits 2 mil?
I seriously had a very difficult time uploading this. I don't like to put anything in my videos that might bring your mood down so please forgive me. I just need to start opening up a little more for you guys so you can understand some of the things that are taking away from the vlogs. Thank you so much for being here either way. I love you so much. See you Tomorrow. :)
you can do it roman
White trash
Hi roman
Hehdhdhhdhi\n\n\nUdydhdhyf

Im in the UK I wanna snuggle your mate on the rocking horse Roman ;)
I've been watching literally EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF EVERY VLOG since before Roman had 1 mil subs
You know what Roman? You need some time off, no needed to be sorry, if anyone expects you to record every aspect of you and your families lives, they need a serious reality check, take as much time as you need man, you can only do so much, you and your family are leaving behind a lot of memories for YouTube to share, so even you stopped youtubing, I believe this channel still would grow, only the real peeps would stick around even if you quit, all I can say is, you and your family keep your heads up and smile more, many blessings sent my friend.
We understand.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEEAASSSEE do not apologize for being a human being and having real life problems ❤️
Roman I will always support you no matter what
Stop stressing ur going to be ok stop handing over projects to the man
We are here for you man

Roman u have it rough take a break from vlogging until u finish the project. True Roman Soldiers would approve
its okay roman i wont leave no matter how loong you take a break whether it 2 days or 2 months.
It breaks my heart to see some of the comments you have to read daily! You are doing an amazing thing with your project the channel can wait till it's finished! You put your heart into all that you do and your probably exhausted and stretched super thin! Focus on your family and the project and us true Roman  soldiers will be waiting! I love your videos and they are a part of my daily routine but I would hate to know I'm sitting here enjoying a video that is causing you stress and pain! Take care of yourself! I'll be praying things level out and get in balance for you Roman! God bless you and SMILE MORE!

Youbdont do your best you do it becuse you are good man and I love  you and your family
Game Atwood would be a great name for a gaming channel.
Roman, you're doing a great job. You're trying and that's all we can ask. Keep it up! -long time follower Kayla..
Roman honestly man do what you gotta do man, as fans we'll understand. Balancing the vlogs and a project like this is not easy and it sucks to see you like this man. But hopefully you'll pull thru man best of luck ^
You make my Day so thank you
Roman, you're an amazing person with an amazing family, doing amazing things in this world! Keep your head up! Don't get discouraged, everything will work out! Smile more, right? 🙂

Oh no!  You're stressed?  You're away from your family?  But you're still making thousands of dollars crying in this video?  Don't feel sorry for you at all.  Why don't you start acting like you have it made instead of these pathetic sob stories.  Dislike!!!
I understand you bro and i will always watch your video because your my inspiration bro. Do not worry, just be you. Remember this roman, SMILE MORE!
Came. Dislike. Left. Fuck this guy
Its okay roman.

Fuck off
ugly ass nigga
Thank you Roman (285)
Youclickbateyfuck
Niggers stink and make me sick
MY POOP IS BROWN AND IDK WHY THO
You're the best youtuber ever and it is ok to share your problems.
Roman we are lucky we're able to watch these and we really appreciate you making them. Without you some of us maybe wouldn't have smiled that day. You are such a great inspiration and we all love you. Thanks roman for making me smile everyday
Roman we completely understand. This is life and we love when you share it with us, that's why we come to this channel. You can talk about your problems because every one has them. Roman we love you and your family and I love watching your videos every day. Just stay strong.❤️💘😊💘
I'm so happy my girlfriend is way better looking than his that has actually made my day
Love you Roman no matter what how your energy is like we all love you xx
Real Roman soldiers don't leave because you're going though life. Like really. Love your videos Roman keep up the good work.
What's your fan base? Why am I watching this? Documenting someone tf?
Love that you share your 'real life emotions' and don't apologize. It makes you even more relatable. ✌️
We understand Roman you can make a five minute blog and we would still be happy.😁
Who ever subscribes to my channel and comments done, \nI will subscribe back to them
all people who care understand don't worry x
Remember when his videos where funny?
I like when you share problems. It feels good to know that you're not different and sometimes the way you solve your problems can inspire other people to solve theirs. I think you should do that more.
He looks like The Mis
You do make me happier
Keep your head up Roman, you're doing great! And Cora just keeps getting more adorable by the day!!
It doesn't matter how big or small your problems are, everyone has them and you need to stop disrespecting ppl about it because you can make it ten times worse. Stop telling people that their problems are nothing compared to yours because you are making it worse and that's seriously horrible. There's probably someone out their who has it harder than you.
i wish i was you SIR
Sorry I don't talk to strangers
Roman, there will always be plenty of us out here that support you! I enjoy your vlogs, at whatever rate they are posted, and at whatever length. This project is just building anticipation for me! It's like waiting for the midnight premier of a new Harry Potter movie (yes, I'm older than most your viewers...). Your family is beautiful. What you are doing is beautiful. Thank you for sharing all of this with us! I also travel a lot for work, so I know how it feels. You feel guilty for stressing over problems that don't seem like a big deal, but it's not anyone else's place to judge how something should or shouldn't make you feel. Your feelings are YOUR feelings and it's what makes you human! It's also what makes you an incredible vlogger because you care about your audience and the content you are releasing. I think it's good that you open up your heart and get these things off your chest. Some people won't understand, but that's okay. You will never be able to please everyone! You say it to us at the end of each video, but don't forget that YOU are beautiful. YOU are one of a kind. And YOU make millions of people smile more each and every day. Again, thanks for what you do!
What a tool! Why is this sh!t trending?
Romana just do what you do brother it's all good
WE LOVE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ROMAN❤️❤️
Roman you know how your partnering with the middle school I go to that school
I bet he's making a film 😂 tough life ...
Try having real problems then get back to me..  you're the kind of YouTuber whos made YouTube gone to capitalist money hungry shit
I wish you didn't exist
A like from me for your honesty.
NO WE DON'T!
We love the good and the bad and I still burst into smile even at your bad vlog no worries and SLEEP DUDE! Sleep is your friend :)) have fun
Grow the fuck up.  jesus haha
Paulinho 👏👏👏
MSN is not there anymore 😢😢😢😭
Eu sei que ninguém vai entender, mas vamo lá Paulinho
Messi will always be Messi no matter wat..thanks for the pass
http://www.ermail.com/klik/UHJQamcM\nHey Guys check on this link and have fun.  Great to enjoy.  Have fun and earn and good game too.
La Liga stadiums always seem to have empty seats lol.
Please, next time don't put final score on the title. Thank you
Dembele is out for half the season 4-5 months
how can barca be this bad?? it doesn't make any sense...
Glory supports are real in these comments thinking they know shit stfu 10 year olds
Spanish people are fucking retarded, look how their commentators sound
Predict sound credibility born obviously international orange freeze gate even.
Ter Stegen again & again. Making same mistake like he did last time vs Real Madrid. He should learn to stay at goalpost to widened the distance & increase the chance to block long shoot. If he doesn't learn this, sooner or later he will end up being burden to the team again. Neuer, Navas & Buffon have better knowledge on this
Why is pique still in the squad? He's just getting older and horrible as a defender. Time to drop him asap
That freekick by messi was so good and the goalkeeper managed to make a world class save. The curve was perfect, what a save from the goalkeeper.
Gaku Shibasaki👍\nProud of him being Japanese🇯🇵
pliz dont discuss signings... its over now ,more over d coach know how to use them n at what position ..juz enjoy barca ...d beauty of football....gr8 goals nyways
What a goal by the Japanese dude!! And what a save on Messi's free kick!
Barcelona's defend is fantastic with umtiti and semedo
Pique was terrible in this game
Who else want semedo in starting eleven like
Remember these are the sort of games barca lost or drew last season which cost them la liga. So a brilliant start.
If you say goal again i hope your mother dies of cancer
He is strong.. He can be a false number 9😐
Is Barcelona become AS Roma??? jk
നെയ്മർ ഇല്ലങ്കിൽ നമ്മൾ ജയികും
The Getafe goal was from Mars .
WE THE FANS OF BARCELONA, castigated PAULINHO....why? I mean seriously PAULINHO .....he is coming to D GREAT BARCELONA....NO PLZ ...but when he arrived to d great Barcelona,  MY Realmadrid, MU, Chelsea  fans  made fun of me and they used to say this is the level of barcelona ......What I replied them...wait and watch bcoz we are just fans and don't know the capability of other players who played in different countries and with different clubs....SCOUTS R THERE....and they brought him to D GREAT BARCELONA......IT MEANS, SOMETHING IS THERE........AND NOW important 3 PTS, due to this 3 pts, last  year we lost laliga .....
Where are the fouls done on suarez which shd have been penalties
FC Roma xD? 3rd kit is similar to roma no?
Asian football is improving, Japan has a very strong national side so does Iran! And China is starting to get on the right track as they are spending billions on the football not only buying big names from abroad but also on its youth program! I see China to top Asia in the next two decades time! They will have a very bright future
A clear penalty for getafe and a red card for pique but as always UEFAlona gets away with it
He scored 1 goal wtf why is everyone bumming him now
Neymar one of the best player out off the team but messi is wonderful
This team is nothing. They might as well trade Suarez and Messi.
5:03 lol, look at Jordi Alba getting on his knees! It´s been a while since Leo shot a freekick like that.
roberto is not for semedo position. If he wanted to replace him and give him some rest he should put vidal in and roberto is great in the midfielder, but really our midfielder sucked today but whatever new coach is doing it is working so far and new Kit away for barca this season is poor, red not cool at all, not barca colour at all.
Vai Corinthians Paulinho
NOOOO WHY DEMBOUZ?😢❤
Paulinho = Vai CORINTHIANS.
Lord Paulinho scored!!!
This is cool
เปาลินโญ่ สุดยอดมากครับ
Nacer brasileño es nacer con el futbol en las venas cuando no aparece el mejor del mundo LEO o SUAREZ MORDELON aparece otro mostro como  paulinho dejen que agarre ritmo para que lo vean crecer \nLastimosamente se lesiono Ousmane Dembélé pronta recuperación
messi did a good shot 😵😵
Dembelé  120 kilos ,   JA JA JA JA JA
Where is messi goal? Oh wait....
Wow barcea
good
Dont forget about denis
the  outro is awesome
Paulinho beastly supersub.
suarez needs to be benched small
noooogggggggooooaaaalllllll😆l
Viva Barcelona 😍😍😍
la mejor liga del mundo JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA.......... la liga más dispareja del mundo diría yo
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!

Dembele hahahah make me laugh so bad for 150 million hahahah
Эу сучара
Barca Barcccaaaaa!!!!

Shibasaki is very very good 💪
No se porque pero este nuevo  AS ROMA no me gusta!
Paulinho The BEAST
XVIDEOS -----> GETAFE. YOU WON'T BELIEVE 👌👏👏👏
Yes, Paulinho my BOOOOY!!!
Paulinho!🔥
Paulinho 🐂🐂🐂🐂💪💪💪💪
Paulinho body balance =  99
Cabrones enseñen el penalti a Suarez que no pitó el arbitro
Dios mío!!!!! El estadio del Getafe lleno!!!!! The end is near!!!! Pedid un deseo!!!!!!
2:24 fuera de juego no pitado que no cuesta un gol por muy poco. Pero no pasa nada que es contra el Barça, así que 0 repeticiones, ni se comentó. Todo OK
Está para gol del año el del año el de getafe
sigo pensando que paulinho no vale eso :/
Cual es el nombre de los narradores
Pauliño marco, porque al defensor de Getafe le falta experiencia. Prácticamente lo dejo avanzar. Aunque le voy al Barcelona, reconozco las cosas como son. JUGARON MAL, El equipo no se acopla.  Este año no hay liga, ni copa, ni nada para el Barcelona. Este año solo Fichajes POPULISTAS, pero NINGÚN planteamiento serio. Jugadores MALOS. Mas de expectativas que de resultados!  Los buenos jugadores demuestran quien son, estén donde estén. Y ese grupito para mi no tiene nada especial de nada.
Pigue nie bzyknął Shakiry przed meczem bo to jaki ten chłop gra ostatnio piach to masakra:/ Potrzebny stoper od zaraz
My dumbass thought Barca were Roma
Paulinho gemius🏆🏆🏆
Who would you cast as adult versions of the Losers' Club in the inevitable It sequel? We're going to have to go with Amy Adams as Beverly.
Who's seen this ???
A bully in marvels ant man ?
The pinned comment at the top is proof of the validity of this video and this channel....that would be none.
Did you guys remember the train scene man that was good shit....
Looper stop click baiting, for fuck's sake.
it's book accurate...stop comparing it to the mini series.
dc by Eagles played out late now\n\nPlay
Sophia is somehow 5'0, she looked taller but ig that's editing for you
Can I just say\n\nGOD I LOVE THE ENTIRE CAST SO MUCH
It was a really really good movie
THE MANSION IS FROM AMERICAN HORROR STORY😮😮😮
GUYS PLEASE SUB TO ME IF I HIT 1000 SUBS MY FRIEND WILL GIVE ME 100 DOLLARS CASH PLEASEEE
I was disappointed . They did not carry over the spirit of the book
me encanto
red bull clownathon@
Nfk
Scuffed j's
I saw the movie today... and i cant sleep from watching it... so i go to youtube and scroll through trending...my heart skipped a beat.
YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE MOM!? THEY'RE GAZEBOS!!!!
I get the point of the vid, but the acting is 100x more important than how they look.
This I by far my favorite movie if you haven't seen it yet go watch it NOW!!!!!🤡
Next video idea: *How IT should really be spelt*
Title has me like Caste of what exactly'?
Why would a good looking girl be apart of a group called the loser club
a GAY clown would feed itself quite well in every smaller US TOWN I guess
Jack Douglass\nShould be Pennywise
Skårsgard needed hella lot more lines
*Beverly was THICC*
fuck that, i'd rather watch the original.
I Like The Bill Skarsgard Pennywise The Best Also There's Awesome Music While There's A Horror Movie Going On
No
I LOVED the new IT movie!!
This is not the type of clown you would like to see at the carnival anytime soon. I died laughing at that, intentional or not it was funny. (In the book, at the carnival some bullies get angry at a gay couple, which leads to them throwing one of them over the bridge, in which IT takes him and drags him under.)
Tozier not Tojer.
they did good but the guy with the stutter is way taller than the rest of them and it looked like he was two-three years older than them.
🎈🎈🎈🎈\n   🎈🎈🎈\n      🎈🎈\n          🎈\n           🤡
Stan Uris was totally worthless in the movie
*OOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG, can't people every be happy with what they got/get?*
I'm gau
Of the Loser's Club members, you listed the Black kid and the Jewish kid last...was that intentional or merely unconscious?
I think they all look ok
The cast looks just fine to me. I loved the adaptation and so did Stephen King. So changing or wishing changes is pointless.
The movie was a pile of shite
I was expecting for drawings
Patrick looks like Rodrick
i love clowns, I love grapes
Dane Dehaan as older Bill
Know
Pennywise teeth remind you of the teeth from the things in dreamcatchers
fans of IT won't soon forget her name.\n\nYou're making the assumption that I remember any actor's name. There are very few I can think of off the top of my head. Maybe a half dozen, and that's from memes. Don't have much memory for people of little importance.
The characters just have new ITerations
I see Chris Pratt playing Ben
Why is Pennywise's nose so huge in the thumbnail?
The only thing is... the creature IT, uses the form of Pennywise to better catch his prey, children. He's supposed to be a family friendly looking clown, kind of like Tim Curry's portrayal of him, but Skarsgard's portrayal seems alot more like he would frighten kids away :L
Am I the only one that wants no name actors for the adult versions of the characters? The movie star presence would really take me out of the movie
fin made that movie
Pleas I wish to get 1000 subscribe pleas help me \nPleas
Still an awesome movie. Stephen King is a GOD.
Who else wished IT wasn't in chapters?
This movie was ass
Personally, I thought that Tim Curry's Pennywise was scarier because it was more realistic, and that's scarier (to me, at least). I wasn't scared of this one since it was obviously CGI'd.
still ship the new kid and bev
Wow I literally got an It ad 😂😂😂😂
Lol is it just me or does mike hanlin look like mohamed ali
Watch IT again look at the front of bills hair its red its a firey red in his fringe!
This is quite possibly the most unnecessary video ever made.
Stan Uris in the book does not have a sense of shaken faith. It is the opposite. His faith combined with parenting of his parents prevents him from fully accepting that something absurd and crazy like a powerful creature Pennywise exists at all. The book says that his faith and culture always pull him to worldview that everything makes sense, has cause and effect, and some kind of order.
For the grown cast they should be: Jessica Chastain as Beverly \nRyan Reynolds as Ritchie \nPatrick Wilson as Ben\nJames Mardsen or Paul Rudd as Bill\nJosh Lucas as Stanley \nAdrian broody as Eddie \nBoris Kudjoe as Mike
Amazing acting.
Nope...Pennywise in the original was the scariest character EVER! I'll watch this because Stephen King is THE MAN, but i'm not expeccting better than the original.
Repent from sin, Jesus is Lord, crucified, buried, and risen from the dead, died for sinners, turn to Him
Who else thought the guy that played pennywise cute
Who else got an IT Ad
Who else got a advertisment for IT before the video?
Pennywise-Jackfilms
Already watched twice at the 🎥 anyone else watch more than once
I could play Finn Wolfhard's character. I'm 100% the character.
Another thing is that the  black kid  was called the n word and dealt with a lot of racism for being the only black kid in a white small town.
Y can't I make 1 mil views
The guy that plays it is fine as fuckk
How the cast of what
I love this new movie so much
It was a great movie I’m starting to feel clown season is going to happen again
Anybody else laugh during all the IT scenes?
I'm not sleeping now\nPlease get me something to help my fears\nClowns are scary
🎈
Jack is a smol bean
Eddie is so hot fucking cute
fucking gazebos
Good job being fourteenth on trending
Clown's Are Scary!
YAAS FINN
Y un comentario en español :v

Pinche payaso no da miedo da más mi suegra en ropa interior
Serious question: why does IT say beep beep richie? Like..richie didnt have the beeping watch, that was eddie. Is it bc he swore alot?
The movie was great, if you haven't watched it you should.

Why does my facial recognition software pit a 96.912 percent match for Ty Cobb(the presidents lawyer for the Russian investigation into the White House and Russian collusion) match up with Hollywood actor Russel Crowe? It has never been wrong before.

No coincidence that the first time arsenal have ever looked like not getting thumped by a big time is when ozil doesn't play. That was the most solid arsenal defensive/midfield performnce vs a big team in years. Deserved point for both teams. Arsenal barely created anything second half but considering they are away from home draw Fair result
0-0chelsea/arsenal\nif I get it right you need to sub to my channel
Sumfin had some bubble at the border an got in some barney wiv the rozzers coz he ain't got enuff bangers in is rocket for a week long stay so the home office told im to bugger orf up is own end
Get this shit off trending now
Lol this is on trending
The best game Robbie went to this weekend was MK Dons nice to meet you mate.
I don't watch football. But this guy sounds important.
Dude I'm waiting for your post match cries 😂😂
Robbie's got the sniffles
Is that the M1 just north of Dunstable you're driving on?
Another 2-1 prediction from Robbie. If his predictions had all come true Arsenal would be on a winning streak going back years and years.
15-0 South Africa in the 12th inning of the second round. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNailed it.
come then you muppets, its dead innit, all the critics dashed
Notice how he's such a slow driver that he never drives past another car but he is always being overtaken
Robbie looks like a black version of sloth from the Goonies
My boys, chelsea fc keeping it real, unlucky on your win
How was your entertaining draw?\nhttps://www.google.de/amp/s/talksport.com/football/listen-arsenal-fan-praises-fantastic-cologne-supporters-i-wish-gunners-fans-were%3famp
As usual just lately it will depend upon which arsenal team shows up ,we have proven we can beat them!!!!!!!!!!!...but ill settle for a point,
you can only be dreaming imagining a Chelsea defeat. home and better. in all level.
My brother said if arsenal wins he will swim in the River Don 😂
he only got up for the match for the views
Bit dangerous doing this while driving? Need to show respect to other road users
we are in big trouble!!!! our formation means fabby will be a free man in midfield
he has alexis on the bench like wtf... iwobi is starting
how can you not love Robbie? i aint even a arsenal fan but i just love him troopz+DT true passionate fans
You cant miss this game ? ?  I dont understand what is so special about getting humiliated .
I guarantee if Chelsea win this video will be deleted
first,the line up has to be on point and second,they have to be up for it
GOO ARSENAL , WE CAN DO THIS
Shame Sanchez is not starting but still a great lineup got Kolasinac powering down the wing he will cause trouble, then we can bring Sanchez on later to finish them #COYG
they dont have there best two players on the pitch. Wtf wenger
Ozil left out of the squad completely he's really gone missing
The small pitch doesn't suit arsenal
i feel like everyone thinks Chelsea is gonna win then arsenal gonna win and people gonna be shocked.people gonna cheer when they thought arsenal was gonna win wtf
If he start the right team we are going to be a victor trust Lacazzette  will score alongside Alexis.
Robbie, I feel sorry for you because we're not going to do this \n\nFor all the reasons you listed I predict....\nChelsea 4\nArsenal 1
We are going to win with 0:6💪💪💪
how is this on trending 😂😂
4-1 Chelsea, Xhaka red card. Sorry but we're terrible like that. Wenger will of course blame the ref etc.
Robbie is ill..they gonna bottle it again..im a goonner but it's the reality
imagine sitting next to him for a plane journey
Robbie, you've been sniffing the coke haven't you
Why you always on trending 😂😂
As soon as I heard Ozil was not playing I knew we had a chance. For once we had 11 v 11 from the start in a big game.
0-0 not bad....\n\nChelsea are shite this year...
Come on AFC beat CFC today! For Man City
Arsenal should be 3-0 up at half time, Chelsea playing for a draw against their biggest rivals yet again
Arsenal don't stand a chance
We played second team against Cologne ??? \nWhat match was i watching LOL\nwe played our first team in europa Robbie.. Only ozil ,ramsay and laca didn't play.. (Xhaka being there not being there doesn't really make any difference)
Draw would be a good result for us but i hope we would win it
Robbie's comments...,I can only say I wish,lets have Laca,Sanchez and Ozil all on and on fire. then maybe  Robbie will be right
Ugly fat BALD
you wish.
jesus christ thats one ugly mug
0-0
Arsene wenger out
0-0
Ur predictions are always 2-1

Chelsea 3-1 Woolwich Arsenal

Have to give Arsenal credit today they were solid all day but poor in the final 3rd #MUFC
Good game. Everyone played well apart from iwobi!  He looked lost and just looked lazy.Even ramesy played well
COYGGGG....SHOW SOME FIGHT! We have to make sure were not exposed at the back, like we were against Liverpool.
HAHAHAHAHA TRIFFIC RESULT FOR SPURS
Middlesbrough fan but what a block by qpr on the goal line
3rd goal was off
trffcv
another loss under holloway, stats are apalling, i agree the ball was out for boro third goal
Screenshot, looks just out to me.\ns26.postimg.org/3mkgxujh3/out.jpg
Qpr have more youtube subscribers then stadium capacity lol
That ref and linesman are a joke,that was obviously over the line
QPR two very lucky goals Boro made hard work of it UTB
After it was 2-2 I new Middlesbrough would score a third cause it's QPR and we also through it away.
We still didn't deserve to win. Our second goal was very scrappy
Go on furlong lad 👏
Trending with 7.3k views? Hah
Why is this trending tho?
UTB
WHAT THE FUCK LINO
The ball was out of play for their 3rd goal?!
Your fuckin shit
Deserved at least a point.
I would have loved an offside cam on Morison on that first one.
Should of been 4 or 5 Leeds got off lightly ... COYL
MILLLLLLLLL
Milllllllll
I can only imagine how much fun josh is having right now. Poor simon
Great goal keeping...that's all I have to say...🤐
Top of the league, your having a laugh!
Millwall the laughing stock of London
The only time millwall will show up all season. Mark my words.
play offs why not never say never
I bet Millwall payed YouTube to put this on trending
Well done Millwall from a Wednesday fan! We all hate Leeds scum.
5k views and this is 5th on trending. gg YouTube.
Bad day at the office for leeds but credit to millwall they were all over us and fully deserved the win. Good luck for the rest of the season mfc apart from when u play us again obviously. MOT

i hate sand as well, i recently went on holiday and we went to the beach i was dying inside
Does anyone know what the balls were called at 12:20 ?
So frustrating its actually depressing..
This was hilarious also shortly after this he fell over face first on the floor but luckily he had his helmet still on.
Doesn't help the fact that he's carrying the weight of three people
Literally the most shocking display of physical prowess I've ever witnessed, and likely the only time Richard Ayoade was the coolest man in the room lol
Type of guy that gets pissed on the first pint!
Just watched this with the Benny hill theme playing as the background - hilarious!!
gg samwell tarly
Fact: they really do lock them into the rooms on the crystal maze and since being shut into the planet room Rob has had to become a pole dancer and put his new found skills to good use in order to generate some income for himself.
Why is he out of breath?
As soon as there was hint from the team that he should turn back, he was like - 'fuck this I'm heading back' 😂
Check the nick of that fat desperate cunt
Change speed to 1.5 and you may just cack your pants.
This team looked absolutely on fire to begin with, like they'd actually studied the show and were going to boss every single challenge, but it went downhill pretty quick. I mean they were entertaining enough, but not quite as clever as they thought they were unfortunately.
This is why aliens refuse to visit us.
Gotta go down as tv gold.couldnt stop laughing the other day when we watched it.
In a way I don't really expect much from someone who dresses up as a furry!! x'D And he was doing some weird pedo panting in there too on those planets.
THE FLOOR IS -LAVA- A HEALTHY DIET
I was laughing like fuck when i saw this on Friday
Can he swing it towards the green one?. He's struggling with the orange one right next to him mate.
Just watched it again, and it's still hilarious, just noticed his laboured breathing throughout the ordeal, the ludicrous advice from his team ( do the thing) and the girl snorting with laughter towards the end. Pure class. Afterwards he was trying surreptitiously to get his gloves off and couldn't even manage that !! Please put the whole thing up !!
This moment is going to be on best tv moments next year. This episode was hysterical
When did this show start again and Richard as the host brilliant.
That fat fuck s a retard... he doesn't know how to control his own damn body
This is what happens when you don't keep fit.
10 seconds in and it sounds like he ran a marathon. Wrong guy for the job
Wheres the mad bald gay bloke in the tiger jacket?
Don't make me shave your captain  ~ the human race 2017
One of the worst things I've ever watched! 😂😂😂😂 poor fella
Ground control to major Tom?
I was wacthing this last night and laughed so much I woke my family up
That's what happens when *real panic* sets in - you end up going round in circles!!!\nLucky the game wasn't a 'timeless' one.  Rob would still be spinning...
When that other guy tripped on the fuckin stairs as well, priceless team
Some say this is lost NASA footage
That would've annoyed me being his team mate..I'm frustrated easily and his heavy breathing and failure at something so simple would've infuriated me..I'm a bad team player when it comes to having weak people in my team.
I know this man, he works in the same place as me. aww bless him.
the team were fun but...and i'm sorry if you reading this team..they were not the best physically built for the job...not very athletic for the physical challenges..the best Member being Martin IMO\n\nthey were there to have fun though i'll give them that and the beard dilemma was daft yet noticeable...if they ended with 5 seconds they could have been the new  team of..rubbish but loveable\n\nstarted strong and then...ohhhhhhh dear
I am REALLY Hoping this Episode & this Moment is Highlighted on This Week's Gogglebox...
I keep thinking this is nick crompton
I feel like he was this bad on purpose, to leave a legacy on the show he likes so much.
My parents said it would go viral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were right
I feel sorry for the guy because there is no way he's running away from this
Thank you Rob for the laugh, you really are a donut going round and round
It was even funnier when they only had 5 seconds in the dome, quality content from the team. :)
This is the pinnacle of British TV
Watched this live too. Funniest thing on TV in AGES!!

When furries get on the trending page for some hilarious TV. Furry being a meme for good reasons right here. Worth it.
Well what do you expect from a cavalcade of fucking furries.
Four of the contestants are in desperate need of a gastric band.
Genuinely haven't laughed so much at a tv program. Not only this jem but the fall in Aztec zone... amazing. Best episode of CM ever!
I'm so glad I don't pay my license fee.
Do the thing!
Rob will never get laid again.
What a useless human being , i hope his friends disown him after that.
Who else thinks the up and down camera is strange and the phone kinda looks kinda like a lg
For a phone that's all a phone
The top part of the phone stresses me out. So that's the reason I'll never get it!!
So you are telling me people should not buy it to not support this kind of behavior from the developers / company BUT you will still buy it and support the company??? WHAT?
I have the 7 plus 256 gig I was pissed no different really too the 6s  I am not buying the X or 8!! Sort your shit out Apple !!! Been with Apple since it 1st came out the tech you put into it has been in Samsung etc for two years AND NO HOME BUTON!!!! WHAT THE FUCK THE HEAD PHONE JACK PISSED ME BUT GONE TOO FAR ! If you make a XS and sort your shit then just maybe because playing with girl friends new Samsung it's amazing stylish the screen is mind blowing water proof head phone jack finger print on home button !! There was NO need too get the home button off it. Apple has gone down hill since jobs was Alice he be turning in his grave Apple has gone lazy unoriginal ripping off tech that is all ready two years old and the list goes on and oh FUCKING GLASS AGAIN!!!
Huawei p10 plus ,check specifications  the best phone 2017
I like the concept, but the execution....eh.....\n\nJust doesn't seem too convincing to opt out of the iPhone X.  I mean, I'm going for it, but for what's on offer vs a more tried and true design.....and let's not get into the price, and that availability. But this video didn't fully convince an on-the-fencer to stay away from the iPhone X.
Omg i get iPhone x for free!
I see you apple👀\n\ncopying samsung not on my watch 🌚
The holding up your phone to ur face to unlock it really bugs me, what if you don't want others to know ur using it or you want to unlock it while driving.
Boi my phone has 12g and is fine
Your name is Philip?
One of the reasons is the price! 😆
No need to buy a cheap case when the phone itself looks like a cheap case. (my opinion)
why make all the useless gesters just actually use the force touch to go back and hold down and double tap
It's a very Xpensive iPhone.
I have an Iphone(6s), ipad, Macbook pro and I used to admire and respect Apple.That was then. Now Apple has gone over the edge with their ego. The cropped out screen is ANNOYING. the lack of a headphone jack is DISRESPECTFUL to the clients, denying an option everyone offers. And they present all of this as an advantage or the future to their hypnotised/brainwashed fan base. DISAPPOINTED. Moving to Samsung.
Apple has been working on this product for years, it's better than Samsung
My S7 is about half that price and does nearly everything, and WAY more customization with launchers. The iMessage argument is horrible too, because most my friends use Snapchat or FB Messenger anyway. \n\nGot my replacement battery on the way and a 128 GB micro SD.  Very positive I'm gonna get two more years on the S7
To everything apple pro would you have the iPhone X as your regular phone please reply thanks.
Apple and everyone just buys into that brand...  And they are doing business with you coz they got goodwill  value and they will be selling crap to you...  O hey!  You'd still buy it though 😂
So true, I give Apple two years to get it together or I'm switching to android
All I can think reading this time line is there is a bunch of poor people who complain about a phone that realistically cost 550 because no one keeps their phone for 2 years and you can typically change your phone every year with carriers now and there is a bunch of idiots crying about who's phone is better Android or Apple while they are both taking our money and going on vacations together laughing about how they have humans fighting over phones. It's preference, u either like the freedom of Android with the set back of viruses and app issues or u like Apple and you like the integration and the security. Either way you are not caring about the price. Let's be honest if u like it u want it you can buy it you will. Humans like buying things that make them feel good. For some it's iPhone for some its Android. Who cares what someone else's spends on a phone it isn't your money. Android are coo if you like them. Personally I like my Apple product I like that everything is connected and what I can do on one I can pic up on the other and finish. I don't have to worry about did I move this over did I save this I know when I get home connect to wifi and go on my computer all the pictures I took for the day on my phone are right there on my computer and I did nothing but turn on wifi.
64gb in a phone is plenty of storage, unless you shoot 4k 60fps video every day or have a 100 movies on iTunes 64gb will be enough I promise you that. I have 1,500 songs and 92 apps installed on my iPad Pro only using 38gb total.
I hope the iPhone x is a fail tbh
I-phone XI=No volume buttons,you have to open an app to adjust the volume. And no more face-ID you'll have to prick your finger and provide a blood sample😂😂😂. It will be Awesome and the top selling I phone ever.
Didn't IPhone just make a phone that was waterproof? Samsung has had a waterproof phone since I don't know........5 years? Samsung created VR. Samsung has made Smart Air Conditioning. In 10 months: Come get your IConditioning! And why the heck are they forcing us to but things to use the damn thing! They are stealing our money. And don't get me started on those prices........
WT happened to iPhone 9??? We got 6 7 8 and it jump to x witch is 10 Wrs iPhone 9??
Until Apple actually makes their own displays, it will always be inferior to Samsung displays.
The alternative design of the screen which would have been better probably didn't happen as it looks a lot like a Samsung s8 active or LG G6 and apple is to high and mighty to admit another company got the better design first.
I hate companies that punish repeat customers with extreme prices. Its like having Spectrum/Time Warner... except in this case you can just get a fucking droid and make Apple pay... but nope, everyone has to have the same device as Kim K to be popular...
Alright I really need help here because I have the choice to get the 10 or the 8/8 plus but I honestly don’t know which one to get please help me decide people!
I can't wait for you to stop showing that pos white bezel mock up
Whoever buys this iphone X is contributing to the rise of apple prices
Rip off bought a S8+ with fast charger for 590 euro secondhand f*** you Apple
U probably shouldn't buy it early because it is a scam
In Australia it starts at $1579 for the iPhone X
Question, did you do a review of the 12.9 iPad Pro 128G.? There are a lot of people having cellular issues with them. The Apple Smart Keyboard makes it worse.
Omg, you put out a video of 10 reasons to not buy the iPhone X, but at the end you said you'll be buying it! DISLIKE
Well you make like 231K a month.......YOU ARE RICH!!
What about touching the home button twice to pull down the screen for easy reaching the top of the screen in iPhoneX?
don't buy an iPhone X... says the guy who bought an Audi A4 brand new
My next phone will not be an iphone.
I honestly don't like the echo in the videos lately! Tune it down a little!!! It's hard to pay attention over it with my headphones.
I would buy but im broke after getting steve jobs corpse of the black market. Its essentially the same as a iPhone X as they are pointless overpriced objects that meke me hornier than a wasps nest when its inside me vibrating.
I don't know why but when I look at the back of the iPhone X it makes me feel like it's watching me!
who will win \na iPhone 10\nor PS4
Apple shouldn't remove the home button. It was my favourite feature..
most andriod users dont care about the storage when you buy it becouse.........\n\n\n..........we have SD cards
Not sure if I am the only person who thinks this way but, the iPhone X (and the other ones) look butt ugly. Apple can't even decide if they want to go with a full metal body or a glass backing... they are a fish out of the water with a crappy apple in their mouth.\n\nAlso again they did a software upgrade, however, the generation before of course can't be upgraded to it. It's kind of like when they brought out Siri for the 4s(I believe) and the 4 couldn't be upgraded to use it. Tho secretly you could upgrade if you installed some hacks and had the 4s' serial code. Kaching kaching, apple suckers.
If it was in bloxburg \n\n\n\n\n\nDONE I HAVE IT
Awesome video!!!!  Was on the fence if I should upgrade from iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone X but I don't feel it's worth it. And yes I did noticed that the OLED screen does appear dimmer than competing models. I thought it was just me!
I will still buy it 😄
Never trust a man named EverythingApplePro because he is a liar that envies money.
Apple is a joke of a company yet people are stupid to see that
I think people only even like these phones is because celebrities use them
I have noticed that when new iPhones come out, in my old one, the battery dies or some part fails and I have to either fix it or replace it..\n4 times in a row same shit and nothing revolutionary about it.
It should be the one and only reason why you shouldn't buy it. It costs 1000!
Even after buying that expensive fast charger, it doesn't charge as fast as Samsung or.others do
i can finally buy the iphone 7! my dream is coming true! it is $550 because the price went down!
That camera hump looks terrible! Why is no one saying anything about that other than the screen. Look at the flagship Samsung phones no camera hump. Come on Apple!
I really hope everyone saying they won't be it actually won't so I won't have a hard time preordering
Please people don't buy this...so there will be more stocks to those who will be wanting this. :))) #DoNotPurchase
I found this website and they've got 100 free Iphone x's for trial! i followed the steps and they're shipping mine now! Check it out before its too late phoneleaker.com/iphone10
iPhone 7+ is the last upgrade I will get with the iPhones. At least I can get a splitter so I can charge and use my earbuds while my husband is watching TV and I can watch the weeks before shows. \nI think they are going too far now with the changes. I wouldn't want the wireless earbuds, you have too charge those also. Bottom line, the iPhones are getting too expensive and they are taking away too much things I feel we need like the earbud jack and charger port. \n\nDon't you have too buy the charger separate for the new iPhones now or does it come with it. I thought I read you had too buy it. Just wondering 😋
4:59\nYo he has an emoji movie app
You only have 5 seconds to stay alive!! 😬😬🚀👟 https://youtu.be/Rusn8Bu4qyU\nTurn it up nice and loud 🎼🎧🥁😄
You're paying 1k to swipe a piece of glass. It's all an illusion of what it does. £150 phone does the same
It's the iPhone 9 since the phone released before it is the iPhone 8
y not not buy buy it it
#1 it's an Apple product. Nuf said
In case you don't know, the only thing wrong with taking out the headphone jack is that u won't be able to charge and listen to headphones at the same time.
I wouldn't need this phone anytime soon. Sticking with my 6 until it's slow or broken.
Will the lazer do any damage to your eyes or your skin\nAnd if so will Apple be liable for any damages to your eyes or skin\nI will not be buying nor upgrading this year.\nAnyway I’m sure Samsung has face recognition \nAnd I’m also sure that every Apple phone has a Samsung screen.
is it just me or does it sound like hes in an empty cave?
Nah this phone suck. Revolutionary my ass.
Great Video!
I want a iphone
$1100 - ‘nuff said.
Exactly get a Samsung
Wow congrats apple welcome to android 2015
Samsung fans can f off
iphone X 😍😍😍
OnePlus 5 FTW
I hope apple whatches this
I have an iPhone 4s 😂😂
10 features iphone copied from Android
If this iPhone X was going to be the only iPhone released for a few years then it would be worth it. But its just stupid that after just a year, your $1000 phone isn't even the best anymore.
You people must be insane if you're going to spend aprox1200$ for a Phone ( accessories bought separately ? Really Apple ? )  , just because it's IPhone ! Does it do pancakes or something ? Apple is just another greedy company who's running out of ideeas and tries to squeez every single coin from your pocket ! Be smart , say no , there are so many other phones on the market who K.O. Apple at every chapter , especially pricing !
We should boycott iPhone X worldwide
I want to pay for it in pennies
It's time for an apple revolt.Their bullshit new designs have pretty much shit on what Steve Jobs built the company around , they've got him rolling in his grave at this point.
Know why iPhone 9 didn't come out? Because 7 8 (ate) 9.

Did u record this in the bathroom?
Good analysis. I plan to keep my 6P for another year.
Am I the only one who actually likes the iPhone X?
I actually have zero idea why people still buy Apple products. Like there is literally no reason to against the competition.
IIIVANNN PERISIC !! ⚫💙

#ForzaInter
Forza inter
Terza giornata!??? 😂😂
Ci stava il pareggio , l'Inter non meritava di vincere , il Crotone ha fatto una grande partita e secondo me ci salveremo 🔴🔵🔴🔵🦈🦈
Worst game all season, including pre-season, still winning tho..
The home side fought very well
forza AZZURRI
A shaky win
LIGA SERIE A TIM,presenta nola seriea tim
Ecco guardate bene questa prestazione che una partita così il Crotone non la fa più
Il Crotone ha solo un buon portiere. L'Inter ha forse il migliore portiere del mondo (è tra i pochissimi in lizza per esserlo). Forse a portieri invertiti il risultato sarebbe stato diverso.
Ma che partita ha fatto Crotone? Non merita la sua posizione nella classifica, ne del Benevento
That line-up might be full of talent, but the midfield is way too offensive, it looks like a team Zeman might field. They'd get relegated immediately, especially in considering how tactical Serie A is, but they'd be a lot of fun to watch.\nAlso, can Kjear and Glik play in a three-man defence? RCB and LCB are not the same as a regular CB.
Inter caralho
Solito ci lo inter
Ci stava un botto il pareggio 2-2/ 1-1
Solita Inter fortunata
Solita inter ladrona
...if Adalaide Byrd was there, she'd have given the fight to AJ Carter somehow...
Second knock down he was clearly unfit to carry on bad call ref
dubois needs to step up in opposition for his opponents sake.
Fuck me, he went down quicker than Khan's missus on AJ.
I understand they want to build up boxers confidence against weak opposition but why the fuck are they putting fights against factory workers and cab drivers on fucking telly
118-110 in favour of Carter
Bad call from the ref. Should have called it at the 2nd knock down
giving a fuck about the person lying k.o'ed on the floor potentially seriously injured just means you're not a psychopath and not much else, just saying
This is the new Mike Tyson trust me
Shouldn't of been in there
why put him in the ring against such weak opponents... mike tyson was world heavyweight champion at his age.... they will never get a shot with bullshit promotors like frank warren
I love this kid! Defo would lead in the boxing ting! Only 19 or turned 20 ! Hella young
id get KO'd for a pay day too carter its all good
Has some solid power but as always, knocking down weaker opposition doesnt really give me an idea of how he is going to be. Against menudo he was rocked in the first round, so I want to see him take some shots against live opposition before making a call. I wish him all the best though, seems like a nice lad and still got tonnes of time to develop.
This man here takeing alot people out aj Joshua will get it promise ye
Ref shoulda stopped it after the second knockdown - something horrible about refs letting fighters get knocked unconscious unnecessarily...
Uk's Sonny Liston 🤔
DB needs to be fighting in the mortal kombat tournament with liu kang and sub zero not fighting in a boxing ring
is the Referee not fired yet?
Beast! Will be champ one day for sure.
Uk boxers are on a lead
No disrespect to carter but I have seen a few of his fights and he's an awful fighter, DD is to stiff, going no were
Didn't realise that guy is British.
DD is gonna dominate in the future!! 👊🏻👏👏👏
Good lad. He looked genuinely worried about his opponent after the KO
This was my first ever boxing match, sat close to the ring, wasn't expecting to see someone pulverised within 60 seconds
definitely a future champ
Steroids
happy bday aj
Well done for trending!
Newcomer.
BEAST !
Dangerous fight
This boy could genuinely give AJ some problems in a couple of years time! 🙂👍
give the video a thumbs up!
Hearn won't be letting this guy anywhere near Joshua's dodgy chin.
he will destroy joshua.. :)
Let me guess, stepping up the hype against nobody's, if he's that good put him in with someone worthwhile.
Rumour has it that Dubious banged out Joshua in sparring
You do not belong in the U.K any longer
Shawty Goofy af but she getting it I really respect her hustle I remember when Shawty was a dancer now she this I wish her nothing but the best Shawty doing her thing stop hating on her!!
She sounds like Riley from the Boondocks 
Expect to see her in some funny movies.
Cardi is super cute and sweet from the show and the interviews I've seen. I obviously don't know her personally but I wish her nothing but success. She is a smart young woman, so I don't understand the hate from sum ppl. I think her comfort zone is going to that voice but she does say real shit. She's young, having fun and how could ya hate on that? Do ya thang Cardi!
She walking a thin line between annoying af and funny af lol I like her more now
Caaaaaaardiiiiiii!! You gotta love her!! She's mad funny stupid!! Love her hustle and personality!! God blessed Cardi!! DO NOT CHANGE!!
Lol bring it on ..... like the white girl against the black girl...... cardi not black but I'd pick her over the white girl.
She sound like her mouth full of marshmallows
Y'all lame for not mentioning Janet Jackson addn bodak yellow on her tour set list.. y y'all falln off now suckas.
lol shit i dont got my license and im 21 😑
She went to college mind blown. Yoo why does she be acting dumb retarded and she's really not. #acting
Imagine Cardi B having a conversation with LaVar Ball... That would be classic!
Df she sound like madea but younger
She's high af lol
I like her music but she sounds a little dumb
The BAHAMAS FUCKS WITH CARDI💯. She's a kool kat
Cooome on Hits! Let's make Cardi B #1! It took Lauren time to perfect her craft and Cardi is the same way. Just let come it to you Cardi. Oh by the way stay in the hood! The hood keeps you grounded and in tune with your hustle. That's where they made us at Baaaby!
Thats my girl..but turn down that weird talkin style..or better yet cut it..its a lil on the annoying side Cardi guh...much love
wtf is this uneducated idiot famous they talk about that cash me outside idiot yet look at this clown all that fake talk and shit we will make garden gnomes famous now days
Can she speak properly for longer than 54 seconds?
' AH SSHHA AAH MM AA HAHA SSHHH YOU KNOW' - cardi b in a nutshell. Fucking goofy and just annoying. That goofy ass voice, grow up, Jesus. Not a good representation of hip hop for fucks sake
plz Cardi dont change just stay real like you are now. just be who you are that's why u close to ppl and they love you lol . good luck tho
Y'all let's get bardi to #1 pleaseee lmao ... I love this girl #bardigang
Love her, but she's overdoing that lil voice now.
i love this woman..
Cardi had the highest streams in the country this week, she's expected to be number 1 when the charts update.
BET award don't mean shit. It ain't no Grammy. No billboard
Charlemagne's a dick even when he's not.!0!lol 😂
Why is she talking like a 5 year old?
happy for her. love her
Well.....lets see what the industry does with her future.
It is like the movie wake up charlamagne !!! 🤦🏽‍♂️ it is for the culture no pun offset even tho he's off-set .. 🙇🏽
DJ Self has to be kicking himself.
She's so high she can't talk and articulate thoughts. She's high off life as well. Congrats to her and best wishes.
Damn... The CardiB interview already reached 1.5 miιιioη νiεωs
My bissssssh!! I love her
i love Cardi and I'm happy she moving out here!
17:28 - if she does get number 1 she will be the first solo female rapper to hit number 1 without a feature since lauren hill - its been 23 years - wooow !!
I hate that weird voice that makes no damn sense. I would've been annoyed to hear her on the radio. However she is very entertaining. I doubt people like little girls look up to strippers. Little girls like her because shes pretty and funny af. That's why between her stripping past and talking annoying people don't like her. Yes she's down to earth but she needs to talk right and stop saying stupid shit for people to look at her differently. Take these interviews seriously and get media training. She doesn't really answer questions intelligently,theres lots of akward air space. ..And the The guy on her right is crushing on her bad. Obvious much😅??
Envy says the most dumb shit! He's so annoying
Worst part is she didnt realise she fucked up. she also looks terrible
My girl....she says She ghetto, but she not DUMB  and that's for all them Hating Females.
THere is so much positivity in the room, and in the comments, and they keep putting good vibes out into the universe, bout to be number 1, soon to be number 1, goin to be number 1. I Love it!!
The most stupidest interview ever!!! Ever!!!!.. I swear she acttin like a pcp head.. Generation lost like a mofo!!!
I've never seen the Breakfast Club be this nice to anyone. I love Cardi B and so proud of her! Keep flourishing sis
She not funny she ratchet. She will never b like Nicki the Queen
What's wrong with her ?
Nicki was brought up for 4 seconds but they want views so they put her in the title. Queen 👸🏾
in + cardi all redy had offset so nicke is a old hader
I love this girl
lol she's giving me a headache
Cardi is too real for everyone! Love her!!!
I'm so proud of you ma!
MOst people that grew up in NYC and the surrounding  b'rows do not have a License.  All of my family from there did not get one until they were over 20 yrs old.  Most do not grow up with a car of their own, there is no where to park the damn thing, and its public transportation everywhere.  I remember thinking that was so weird when i would visit my fam in BK and the BX since I had my license at 15, but as I got older it makes so much why if you were from there you would not have one as a teenager.  I would not have got a License if I was not going to be driving.
I Think She Is Beautiful But Her Spirit Is EEEVVVEEERRRYYYTTTHHHIIINNNGGG!!!
First time hearing her speak. I have to say she ignorant as hell.
She is hilarious!!! I really enjoyed watching this
The way she looked over at her manager when they brought up Nicki Minaj says everything 😳
U gotta love her energy lol badone wit a bomb personality
she gatta be a Libra I overthink a lot too
Not a hater, not feeling this interview. There was nothing to talk about.
I love her she is really a motivation for ppl who think they aint gone make a upcoming in life
This is for the culture?  Do ya really wonder why the world is in such a state?  Sad.
Why does she talk with that silly kid accent.
Ppl say cardi is ratchet an loud an all this other negative stuff but I love her positive energy and her realness is undeniable 👏🏽😻
Why does she talk like some South Park character?
17:45 awkward asf lol
#CardiForTheCulture!!!

So if I sell drugs or extort money to make it to the top...You all would respect and support? I'm just asking a question...
Lol no offense, but good luck to dethroning Nicki Minaj. I'd like to see cardi B break Aretha's record. Cause Nicki the only solo artist to ever break it. Nicki been around 8 years. So please, lol, tone it down. Its one song. Now lets see her keep it up for 8 years and break Nicki Minaj's 77 hits record.
Cristine is the closest thing we have to parental supervision on Youtube.
Hey Cristine remember a couple of years ago when you did those reciprocal gradient nails were you put the top coat on before you removed the glue ya I know those dark ages were pretty rough with only glue to lean on but could you possibly do those same nails but with HOLO 💿📀💿📀💿📀💿📀💿📀💿📀
The introduction 😂💕
do you think that if you used these holo flakies with a skin safe glitter adhesive, you could make it into a holo highlighter? or is that just like putting glitter on your face idk i thought i had a groundbreaking idea lmao
Please can you do the video on how you made your own cuticle pen. You said you would \n🙃
So uh, here's an idea....\nBUFF HOLO ONTO EVERYTHING like everything 😛
Ok I'm obviously not the target audience for this but I watched the whole thing and laughed my ass off!
I really love this chick and how she says beautiful in this video is hilarious dwl. But imma get me some of that holo thing
Don't you just love when auto correct corrects Holo Queen to Holocaust Queet \n\n\n...
I just came here for the holo.
holo queen right here ya'll better not mess with her holo cause it's HOLO EVERYDAY BRO! (christine reference)
i choked on my drink when she mentioned the one thicc bih ditty song, holy shit :'D
OK so, apocalyptic beauty on etsy has a HOLOGRAPHIC glitter highlight! It's called pixie essence liquid warpaint glitter highlight can you please try it?
CRISTINE THERE ARE HOLO SNAKES!!!!\nWhite lip pythons scales are holo, I had seen pictures but I thought they were fake but now that I know the name I can for sure say that they are REAL AND INCREDIBLE (white lip python, Google it)
All of the holosexuals wya?? btw plz do a video trying to copy all the russian nail artists. i love you christine💜
do a whole jar of the holo flakies on your nails HOLO MOUNTAIN
You should make a cute natural nail with Holo flakes
I was watching your video and my husband looked over my shoulder and said...ooo that halo lmao. He knows!!!
I think after the top coats the solar color dust looked slightly  more bright sooo
Every time she says flake take a shot
wait what i didnt know this was a nail art channel
Omg ! I guess this is the highest number of likes given by Cristine to the different comments for one video ...
I demand a Holo song
Why are u so perfect
Please do a collab with Jackie Aina! She's a beauty guru, and I think both of your personalities would be the best match ever!!
I want to eat the flakes
My sister just asked what is holo and i had a heart attack
It’s only been 80 days since an actual nail art tutorial. U nail art bro?
What sort of camera do you suggest someone who wants to start a YouTube channel?
Who else is ready for HOLO-ween??? 💿
100 layers of holo powder on your nails.
Happy Citizenship day!! (Is that a real thing in Canada?)
How many matte tacos does it take to ruin holo
I literally learn everything from you
Are you getting weirder? Not complaining, I love it.
No way Christine doesn't snort this shit in her spare time....
Who else wants to see Simply Nailogical's Greatest Holo Hits Volume 3?
Can u do a holo bath bomb? 😅😅😊😱
No, I do not have a holo problem\n*continues to buff a second layer of holo onto their nails*
*MY EYES HAVE BIN GRACED BY THE HOLO GODS!!!!!!!!!!!!*
Omg a nail video, where you actually learn something
Cristine I dare u to swim in a bath or pool of holo
You need to make another Holo Album
This makes me even more holosexual where can I get this
You are amazing though!😀
When I first started watching this channel, I just wanted to look at nail art and now I'm snorting this shi - wait what... 🙄
I have some ideas! Paint the underside of your nails holo\nOr the most boring nails ever and then make them fun
I keep my nails black I don't know why I watch all of these
How to get me to click on any video: Put holo in the thumbnail.
You should mix all of your holo powders and flakes together like you did with mixing nail polish
Holo baby one more time
I appreciate how you test them systematically and only have one independent variable at a time -- all the while providing clear commentary and keeping a good pace that's not too fast or too slow. Holo is a SCIENCE :P It makes it much easier to watch and make sense of all the brands and techniques thank you Cristine :)
This may be a bad suggestion but here goes: Find the most transparent black nail polish you can and see how many coats it takes for it to look opaque.
Any one else watch her snapchat story and think she should make a H💿L💿 music video 😂
This video was very nostalgic. It's got that pre polish mountain feel to it. \nAlso I'm disappointed we didn't see what's on your other hand.
Are you still wearing your aluminati   to nail art?
Do the 100 layers of holo powder challenge I looked it up no one has ever done this
Glitter? In my holo?\n\nIt's more likely then you think.
for about a minute 2:32\ni hear the Canadian accent and i love it
BECAUSE OF OUR HOLO MOM, MY CUTICLES LOOK PRETTY 😭😭😭❤❤
*not related to this video* the other day on snap you showed teas that you bought, what was the name of the company again?
Watermarbling that you could try.  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2027740727456538&id=1630195383877743
.
i wanna fuck your holo nails
cristine is high on holo
Pom Pom nails!!
My eyes are dying
Notice me holo senpai
*2:32*  aboot a minute
CAREFUL TAYLOR WILL SUE
Holo mountain!!!!
😂😂
Holo 🤤
Use make your own nail polish numnoms
Yaaaaaaas
Bake that sh9t fo' a minit.
HOLO=LIFE
CRISTEN THE SCIENCE QUEEN.
You should try num nom nail polish maker
HOLO MOUNTAIN PLZZ!
Omg your camera is amazing
you should make a holo facemask
Finally another tutorial😭
Anyone else thinks she talks like Jenna marbles sometimes?
Dear God....
My eyezzzz....all dat beautiful holo is blinding mehh
Try Jamberry nail wraps!
Holo crap!\n(Holy)
I had no idea my earphones were on full blast and that intro scared the shit out of me
3:12 yeah buddy the holos are here 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 HOLO 4 LIFE 💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿 love you cristine ❤️💛💚💙💜
This might sound like a crazy idea but I think it would be funny if you took all your peelies and strung them on necklaces/brackets, because if anyone can make something totally weird a trend it's you Christine.
Couldn't watch this until rn because I had my phone taken away. I cussed. Oops. I'm glad I got it back today. ;-)
Where's my drugs?

Omggggg what did I just see ? 😍😍😍😍😍😍
why is this shit on my feed. whats with the rainbows. let me guess.
Wow awesome  vocals & song tells a story and speaks to people . \nEnjoyable and sweet love  the chorus.
This added 10 Years TO MY LIFE
Miley as a really great voice ! And the more mature she becomes the more I like her. Never been a fan, but I'm discovering her true talent  little by little. I love it !
This was my favorite
THE PERFECT SONG!! I LOVE YOU! 💞
She's so beautiful!!!!  So proud! 😘😘😲😲
The greatest voice ever :)
Is leslie still her best friend?
Shit! It's my favourite!!!!!!
she can still wreck my balls any day
Why is she so perfect?
Love that version so much!
I always loved this song.
Jesus Christ Miley.......stop making me feel old ><
Its like Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus decided to switch places.....
This was my top-favorite song from her ever as a kid...even now it's still amazing. This makes me so emotional & happy. Means to much to me when I think back at how much I loved this song <3
Glad she got rid of the lesbo haircut.
THIS is d Miley Cyrus who I missed lol thank god she's back :)
Miley good job for cleaning up your ways
I can't stop imagining her doing this performance totally naked.
Redeeming the teenage Miley songs in her new sound ?!?! Yes please!!!
This made my day, month,and year
I still LOVE this song. Omg! ❤️
listening to this gave me such a good feeling
Miley is a MAN! That's for sure.
what a throwback!!! I'm crying
Hey , i'm Miley Cyrus from Hannah Montana and you're watching Disney chanel♥
Is this version recorded somewhere? Love it so much more than the original recording
I can't believe she did this song!!! YESSS!!! 😭😍😭😍
my inner 10 years kid is crying right now 😢😢😢
Im dead. Like, ive been waiting for this for so long.
i need this in spotify rn
WHY AM I JUST NOW SEEING THIS
I love her so much 💕💕💕
This is everything. My child self is quaking rn.
This is my everything, my inner rock chick is a little sad though😂
My inner 10 year old self is screaming and singing haha god I miss being 10 ❤ love you Miley!
This Country Version kick's the shit out of the Hannah Montana Version, continue the country root.
Little Jess inside of me is screaming
Always loved this song no matter how old it is
I love this 2017 version ✨👏🏾
Beautiful voice but dam if she didnt ruin her legacy by doing that rap song. Seriously I close my eyes and try to enjoy her voice, and her tongue out her cherry red lips, and head side cocked with that dumbass look on her face pop in my head
I never watched Hannah Montana ... I'm English... I don't think we even had it in the UK. I genuinely though this was from her new album and I fucking love it!
Oh wow, this took me back. See You Again was one of my favourite songs when I was younger 💃🏾
this used to be my jam omg
i feel sorry for whoever didn't grow up with hanna montana and the old disney, that was literally my entire childhood. i never thought she's sing those songs again 😭😭❤️
what is up with how good her voice sounds?
Just think, You can be NO TALENT PLAYERS, jus zuck some HERPES RIDDLED odd TAINTED tHING, An EVIL will Ride Your Sore Ass Until it Falls In. Shame To Pimp ones child!
Beautiful song perfect lyrics sensational voice. Best tune this year by far. Go Miley! be yourself I'm luvin your work.
Is it just me who always thought she said my best friend lilly said??!
Of course people bring up Hannah Montana. She's a person, not just a character for your pleasure.
LOve this....but i also miss pablo the blow fish on a weird level.
does anyone know how i can get my hands on all  of the guitar players?  yummy
Oi my girl! Best thing I've come across. Memoriessss
THE LAST TIME I FREAKED OUT\n\nI JUST KEPT LOOKING DOWN\n\nI ST ST STUTTERED WHEN YOU ASKED ME WHAT IM THINKING BOUT\n\nLIKE I COULDNT BREATHE YOU ASKED WHATS WRONG WITH ME \n\nMY BEST FRIEND LESLIE SAID OH SHES JUST BEING MILEEEEY
can i get an amen
She has improved a lot since then. I think she needed to embrace her raspy voice
100 times better than original! so grown up
Proud moment for a girl who started loving her since she was 11 years old. That girl is me <3 <3 My role model for life!!!!!
I didn't know I needed this
I don't give her enough credit. But, shes pretty damn good.
This is so beautiful, her voice is so underrated. Absolutely amazing. I don't care about the wild phase she went through. People change, and just because she's in the eye of the camera people judged her. It's healthy to go through phases. And now look at her, back to her old self. Watch all the haters come crawling back.\n\n\nIly miley forever 😭❤️🤘
MILEY SINGING SEE YOU AGAIN AFTER ALL THIS TIME. IM CRYING
This gave me life.
Miley Cyrus is free from the demon, now Katy Perry is possessed.
someone tell me why i'm obsessed with this
And they say she can't sing!?
I remember listening to radio Disney on my shower radio in sixth grade and I would shower for as long as it would take for this song to come on, and I'd sing it and think about the boy I was crushing on. He eventually asked me to dance at the first middle school dance and my heart freakin melted. ❤️❤️❤️
This kinda sounded like older country, like Reba's older music. I love it😍
my favorite country songs is everything what miley sings😍😍
I knew I wouldnt be disappointed when I would click on this video. yas Miley <3
I didn't liked the bangerz era, but still supported her, but this Miley I'm diggin'
physically and mentally having a break down
'It's fun putting your name in songs'
My childhood song. Omg :
Welcome back Miley 😍
Memories (':
❤❤❤❤❤
OH MY GOOOOSSHHH YEEEESSS 💕💕💕💕
Thank you for this Miley omg
Tasty :)
nine year old paunai is scREAMING
Am I seeing things?

FEELING SO BLESSED THIS EXISTS

Oh... my... god... MY SONGG
Why are you soooo good??
Classic
OMG THE CHROUS
O-M-G
Ears are blessed
Que lindo que sigas siendo tu misma 😍
Music horrible
Nick Jam tiene un estilo único, ni maluma ni j balvin el creció solo buscando y su sencillez esa sonrisa lo tiene todo
this song makes me wanna wipe my toilet paper with shit
she looks like a teenager with red hair <3
I'm not understand what she saying but love to listening
I wish i was understand Spanish
that red hair brought flashbacks of when she first started, she's still as awesome and beautiful 🔥🔥
She's stupid. She mispronounces some words like a native English speaker would. She dies her hair and uses creams to look whiter in order to look more Anglo-American. Now she pronounces Spanish words like shit.
To all the people who don't understand Spanish or this song. Don't worry Nicky Jam  and Shakira often remake (in other words translate) their hit songs in English.
SHE GOT FENTY BEAUTY BY RIHANNA TROPHY WIFE ALL OVER HER 🙌🙌🙌🙌😎😎😎😎
Do we realize that Shakira is 40?
Spanish not agin , can't  understand... and  love you Shakira
After despacito......everyone wanna sing in spanish......back to the roots.....here we go
I love you shakira. She is best
Ms. SHAKIRA, when i can see u not good looking?
The old shakira is back everyone 😍
When you have no idea what the song says but it's Shakira and Nicky so you shall listen and enjoy!

I pique?
Miau? 🐈🐈
Apoyo full al reggaton estilo antiguo y muerte al trap
puto el que lo lea
a mi no me gusta Nicky Jam pero en esta colaboración su voz la pega
Cada música que estrena shakira siempre pega😎🎵🎶
Querida Shakira. Tienes mucho talento y tu carrera es incomparable para latinoamerica. Se que te da miedo quedar sepultada en la industria y que lo que vende es el reggaeton y el trap, pero tu eras la princesa del pop latino. \nDeja de pensar en tus bolsillos y vuelve a hacer la musica de calidad que hacias no hace mucho .
Solté el reggaeton porque se convirtió en un concurso de belleza🎵
🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴colombia en lo alto gracias a shakira🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴
pero que en mi cama sea salvaje y peligroso .... jejejejje
Me encanta shakira pero esta rola no tanto...😜
Quiero un perro fiel jaja  yo tengo miedo de que mes gustes y que vaya a enloquecer 🎶
su movimientos.      De çhakira jaja  lo  máximo
que te pasó shakira de temas como día de enero a este, te perdimos ahre igual si
Enloque— que— que!!!  ¡¡QUE!! solo es capota y pintura.  Shakira debería de retirarse y darle paso a la siguiente generación.
Está en #1 en tendencia por Shakira, no por Nicky 😉😍
Yo creo que pique I Shakira se an separado por la canción I por las noticias
Ozuna ft shakira like si romperian esos dos juntos
BASURA ESE NICKY JAM ESTA HECHO UNA MIERDA
A mí me suena parecida a la canción Chantaje. Me gustaría escuchar otros tipos de letras, tanta sensualidad se me vuelve monotonía. Es solo mi opinión personal.
0:16 parece ally o como se llame de los 100 xdd
gua que padre cansion la amo llo la escucho cada rato escribir si te gusta 😆😊😂
Tendencia número uno en Argentina\nhttps://youtu.be/L4242Sr9Pm8
Despues del 0:25 lo demas es basura !! Shakira es mejor que esto !!
En la transacción y el calor rojo
aria lo. que fuera por conoserte

Vaya mierda de base
Amo a shakira pero debo admitir que en este video se le nota lo iluminati,el dorado significa exito en su secta y el rojo tambien tiene gran significado para ellos por eso artistas como rihanna y shakira y otras mas se han teñido de rojo su cabello,si no me creen les recomiendo una pelicula que se llama el demonio neon es una pelicula que muestra algunos de los rituales y de las cosas que deben hacer para ser famosos de hollywood.
Eres la mejor regguetonera de todos!
Porq los gringos tienen mas like k los k hablan español?  Vamos like k los supermos
Ya que mejor lance Trap como siguiente single y levante en visitas porque con este no jue.
Shakira con el pelo rojo me recuerda a sus inicio de ojos asi 😀😀
Era todo lo que quería ver de ella hace tiempo... \nPerro fiel is a fucking song ¡!?
pero que feo baila shakira no se unos pases rarisimosssss q baile normallllllll
1 tendencia en CHILE.
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️Ayuden a que certifique las de la intuición y sale el sol ya casi lo logramos!!!!!!⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
Shakira como siempre llevando a colombia al frente del mundo eres maravillosa ¡¡ERES LA MEJOR !!
Nunca falta ese menso que dice primer comentario  3 dias despues del video jsjsjsj :v
música comercial, basura reciclable, que asco xDDD
deja de joddr Shakara que ya tu estas vieja.
La canción esta buena realmente me gusto pero shakira siempre baila igual...... es aburrido me gustaría verla variar en el baile
No se  le puede poner me encanta  solo está chida la canción 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
A shakira se le acabaron los pasos de baile que ya le cambie siempre mas de lo mismo... poque le acabo las odeas a esta chaborruca
Próximamente Shakira ft. JBalvin
Esta Shakira siempre hace los mismos pasos en todos los vídeos
Why is this trending now lol
Blame the whitey right?
Why is this trending? But it's cool. One day I will be on trending
Why does every show about black people somehow have to mention how much they hate white people lmao
Season 2's finished, why is this trending now?
Someone said this is the fresh breed of black privilege and embodies typical rich BLM members. I aint seen it but that's what people telling me
nice job youtube
white people complaining in the comment section.....don't worry be happy 😂
Liberals have lost their fucking minds, who on earth would want to watch this? A TV show about a black tranny?  I'm about to vomit
What's with the white people hating?
This is blackwashing. Why are there any white people in this?
I remember the first time I watched Issa it was on Awkward Black Girl i still watch it on youtube
Shit tv show shit acting shit black people

Why the fuck is this trending,.? Hardly believable. YouTube is not even trying to hide the trending manipulation anymore.
Pure ideological propaganda
In real black relationships the man beats the women and then leaves her and the kids to somehow make it. So I'm not really buying the whole gimmick of class and good manners that this show is trying to portray the black community as having. Maybe add in a scene of a black man squealing 'WELL DO IT THEN NIGGA!!' at one of the women who then swings her handbag at him and gets savagely knocked out to the chorus of 'WORLDSTAR!'.................then I will tune in and watch.
HBO is going downhill. A shame but every company has to peak at some point.
Not sure why I passed on this when it first premiered, but this show looks good.
See, I get it. Its an all black cast. That's okay. There should be variety for people to find a show that they find relatable...but in game of thrones, Rick and morty, breaking bad, Shows that mainly feature white people or white writers, at no point imply they 'hate black people' by having one of the characters do something or say something racist.\nSo why do we think its okay for shows like this to have an underlying hit at white people?
What is songs?
Where the white women at????
I will sub to anyone who subs me when you are done comment done:)
Paul always -- ALWAYS -- sings significantly better when he has a friendly foe sharing the mic with him.
I have a few friends who still don't buy Bruce's legendary status. This clip and the one of The Stones a few years back inviting him up for Tumbling Dice oughta silence them. The Stones, Sir Mick and Sir Paul don't just ask anybody on to their stage. Bruce has earned his way there. Brooooooooce.\nOh btw, love me some Paul. Still rocking and killing it and looking like a happy kid doing it!! The best.
Hey by the way I love this video so much and I love paul mccartney! ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
Was an awesome show! So glad I was able to witness it in person! Paul, Bruce and Little Steven greatness!
Seeing paul loving playing just as he did when he was young got me kinda choking up :')
Good to see Silvio Dante made it through the war with Brooklyn alright.
Paul McCartney now 75. Hope I can still be around at that age. What an amazing guy.
Along with Dylan, Young and Johnny Cash my all time hero. Long live The Boss
Holy shit. I would've lost my fucking mind if I was there.
The joy in Bruce's face to be back with a Beatle. Wonderful!
The boss rocking a les paul like his ol' teenage self! Suits him well!
Jim I need a copy of this show
ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!{BREAKING NEWS}\nHello guys, checkout some very very interesting information about Bruce Springsteen that everybody MUST know here http://bit.ly/2yg6zEZ
Best concert of my life! Thanks for posting!!!
I was there. Great videos Jim. Thank you.
I was in London 2012, the concert he mentioned, when they first sang this song together
I was there!
Thanks God
É ÓTIMO COMO CANTOR. ABRAÇO.
Stevie!!!
Me too
why the crowd are humming?
Is the crowd booing?
the only thing I don't like about this is that Springsteen is faking it on guitar - you'd think he would learn the song and play along - it's only 5 chords
Thought he was dead.
Mccarthy is an old dog
Did I hear people booing??? Why on earth would they do that??????
Rolling Stone has posted your video FYI  https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-mccartney-springsteen-play-i-saw-her-standing-there-w503567
Boo!!
why the crowd are humming?
For anyone who's wondering.. She's talking about disturbing london.
Imagine being this talented and don't get as much recognition and views as some shitty singers ... think about that.
That body, that voice, that face, that beat, those words - why are you so underrated? society's got no class.\n\n(btw i'm not claiming that her appearance should be a factor that sells her music, but daaannng shes so gorgeous 😢😩😩😍👏👏)
SUCH.A. POWERFUL. WOMAN! 🙌🙌\nHonestly, words can't even describe how beautiful this song is; there is going to be haters downing and mistreating Jessie's artistry and how she chooses to share it; YES the video is sexual, but what's wrong with a little empowerment? It is her choice, she's a grown woman and she is sharing a very special message... Close your eyes and 'Think About That'.
I think about JASSY J
Building my life on your lies,\nYou just laughed when I cried,\nThink about that...
Justin bieber is a idiot because look that viedeo 😑😑: if you look that you will hate justin bieber
She's just amazing.. no words can describe how woderful she is! 😊 Love her music and love her more! hope she deals asap with the health issues she has 😔 💜
It sounds like Christina Aguilera´s Stripped vibe to me. Something genuinely real, she´s really saying the truth inside her. This is beautiful. Go Jessie, you´re great! ;)
Loved her first album for true songs with meaning. Her music then went too mainstream and like every single other artist but also bland. Now this is the Jessie i loved initially. Real lyrics. Real emotion.
Heartbeats where are you? ^_^
Yeah Girl!!!!!!! You got me thinking
THIS. IS. SO. GOOD!!!
I swear this is gonna be her best album!
Love the song and the video! On constant replay! People saying Jessie is showing too much skin need to let Jessie do Jessie. If you don't like showing skin, that's you. Go ahead and wear your winter coat in the summer if you want. 😂 That's your body. But, Jessie will express herself with her body as she pleases. NOW THINK ABOUT *THAT*
Jessie has such an amazing body😍
This is the music that she does best. This fits her as a glove. Beautiful art.
I love you so much JESSIE J!!!!! You are a Badass! BEAUTIFUL!!!!
TACKY VIDEO THAT DOES NOT RELATE TO THE TOPIC SHE LOOKS LIKE A CHEAP WHORE AND THE SONG IS LAME PERIOD.THATS WHY SCHOOLGIRLS ARE WALKING AROUND DRESSED LIKE WHORES BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE HER.THERE IS NO NEED TO BE DRESSED LIKE THAT.AND ALL FOR A CLICK OF A MOUSE ON HERE.
Take that Luke James! Jessie survived your #Bullshit! Inspite of all you #LukeJames put her through, #NeverthelessShePersisted. Congratulations Jessie J! You've won!
I'm gonna be honest...\n\n\n\n\nI came here for the video
This song is just stuck in my head
Damn J. Fuck it up!!
I love you so much 💚💚🇸🇦
I love her personality, and her voice - it takes me places 😍
I love it that's my baby
SHOW HIM WHAT HES MISSING BITCH IS NOT PLAYING NO GAMES
This.... This is fire. Real, personal stuff.
Got Alicia Keys vibes from this, which I deeply appreciated! Jessie's voice is so powerful and passionate, matching perfectly with this kind of music <3 The soul in her voice really comes through with these mellow complimenting beats
it's very very good music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When I first listened on Spotify, I thought this was a black singer but turned out its Jessie J!!
That's right...let it out...and keep it real.
on my channel with lyrics
I love this woman!! Awesome as always....
This reminds me of Dirty Laundry by Kelly Rowland.. Anyone else?
Bitch she's back by popular demand 😉🌹🌹🌹🌹
Love this song and the video. This gonna be her best album ever! \nWhy Jessie J is so underrated ? 😫
Damn jessie😭😭😭 felt everything you wanted me to feel with this jam... didn't even need the video😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are one of the most underrated artists Jessie! I think you're amaazzing! Best of luck with the new album - I'll always be here supporting you x
Im in love with song ❤ I like to think she was inspired by Beyonce and the Lemonade album 😍
Set seems very much like Maggie on The Walking Dead. I love Jessie ♡. This video help me to do hard thing and help people to do it, who agree?
Ye why you do this to me still I feel like stupid ago you Your are to high for me don't do it .

Hey guys, we just started our new channel where we make reviews of shitty cameras, all under 10$ and see what comes out of it Go check it out if you want! Thank you
This is what i call a MASTERPIECE! Thank you beautiful soul. Love you.
She's back. And she's better than ever😍🔥
where is the kid with the lyrics!
The best singer ever😊❤️

THE QUEEN🎧❤❤❤❤
Giving me those Beyonce vibez...
❤❤❤❤❤
Essa sonoridade classuda cheia de poder eu amei super, chega de farofas Jessie. Valorize sua voz em canções assim ! Brasil loves you. ❤
why jessie don't get many views ?!\nshe have over 6M subscribers ?
Such a great song as always ❤ miss u girl 😘
I like Jessie J but the song is so boring :( \nLove the video
Is this bitch still trying to make it in the U.S.A? Gets big in the uk then fucks off? And the music your doing now is shit you have lost your uk grime thing.
Idc what the message of this song is supposed to be, the fact that she HAD to show her ass and took this like an oppertunity to show how big her ass is like most of the others singers, rly annoyes me so much🙄
I seem to b the only one who doesn't like her singing voice (that high pitch) I mean, this is a funky song....but I can't help feeling a little bit like its way more dramatic than reality
Who hurt you babygirl 💔
2:05 that ass!!!!!!🍑😍
Guess she ran outta money.
Wait so is this part of R.O.S.E or what?!?!?!
Probably another Flop... 🙄
So whacking off into a cup and having random women you've never met give birth makes you a father...??\nHow beautiful.
This nigga's been copy and pasted onto a woman's body
Cool. I'm sure the others who chose to be anonymous probably unknowingly had sex with one of their offspring 😯😰😖
they all have the same nose.
This is so wholesome. Don't even bother reading the comments though.
He masturbates a lot
All raised by crazy cat ladies who couldn't find a man.  This is not ok.
So did they all shake his hand first?
You know some of those boys where thinking damn it I have so many hot sisters.
Think the fat one blames being fatcon genetics ?
When the squad hasn't seen eachother in forever. I'm sorry... I try.
Imagine the mothers asking him for back child support all at once now.
White people doing the most
Guys a Racist no black kids
what's ur dad like? i wanna meet that dad
His pull out game is weak
WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH
-We have our daddys sperm in common
I wouldve never made these ugly children
He needs to be called by his name or Mr. Sperm Donor.....to call him Dad is an insult to every Man that has actually  MADE ALL OF THE SACRIFICES to RAISE THE CHILD.
I bet some of them sleep together in the past no wonder some of them has shame on their faces.
2:23 I have a feeling she says it alot, if you know what I mean
I wish I'm good looking and tall as a man... i'm only 5'4 and can't donate sperm for money. Literally free money.
And all you jerk offs out here just waste your cum for nothing
This is the weirdest family reunion I've ever seen.
So every time you Jerk Off and dispose your cum. Does that count as murder?
Man, if I found out I had 18 half brothers and sisters, the last I would want to do is meet them. I barely talk to the two I have.
ages 16-21 my ass most of them look 30
LMAO at 1:47 two of the girls have Snapchat filters on the photos he framed and put on his mantle. 😂💀
Американец Майкл Рубино в молодости был донором спермы. Недавно он встретился со своими 19 биологическими детьми.
Child #9, please.
Ummm...what?!
Wow!!
Wierd
Dad?
Julhreeze
Hell no
seems like a maury episode
Yuck
Hello number 9
Lmfao
They're mostly attractive
А мужик молоток, и детей наплодил, гены свои передал, и от воспитания увернулся на совершенно законных основаниях.
Wow
19 kids and counting, lol
tf
It's so sweet how open he was to getting to know all of them meanwhile so many actual fathers take zero interest or responsibility for their kids
I honestly wonder if any of the kids were attracted to each. There is a phenomenon that causes incest with separated family members.
It'd be kinda nice to be a part of that.
Goes to show being fat isn't genes but habits one tht  fat girl lol
They aren't his kids
What a great story
Lol he has some hot daughters
Too sweet...he has done jus what God wanted us to do....MULTIPLY!!!!🤔😊...seems lik a nice man as well
Hey remember when you were inside me? (Hard pause).
He looks at them.....omg, you where all once in my balls 😲
he might have been your father, but he'll never be your daddy boy
Vince vaughn had a movie like this
Is it just me or does it look like none of these kids were raised by hood rats?
He became a donor to earn money
This is a recipe for some weird relationships.
There is just 13 siblings there
I would have walked in slowly and dramatically with my hands folded, and I would say hello my children
Michael is a very rich man.  A wonderful story.  Thank you very much.
There was a movie similar to this story wasn't there?
One shot of sperm has more kids then this inside it
I can't remember the name of the movie. It's exactly like this
This is sad and creepy af. \nDude whacks it off and makes some good cash 💰 and reunites with his kids on a tv special (probably to make more cash) almost 20 to 25 years later and he's a great guy\nWtf is this world coming to? (no pun intended)
This nigga has 19 children and I can't even get a text back.
... an artist in his 30s began donating sperm to help families.....  sure.. that is probably the nicest way to describe this
Imagine if he was a non white dude, all the comments and how this would be viewed. But hey a white guy, let's put him on a pedestal.
Damn he's a good ass dad! That's a cool way to have kids and not pay child support
whats the name of the machine that mechanically  milks cows?
everything feels so forced, but nice gesture to get them all together
Bit strange to me. No wonder why most donors choose to never see the kids
Family guy in real life
I found my 8 half siblings & only half wanted anything to do with me. And 3 of the 4 that did were superficial to protect their family business. Kind of disheartening so I put the block on them & went on with my life. I didn't feel pain from it before & so why have it now? Not everybody is able to be open like this family I guess.
So he has 6 ghost children?
I'll take #9,,, yummy young man.
This is family guy all over again
Chuckle..the best and kind news
Mike seems so overwhelmed by the awkwardness
The one in the pink can be my sperm donor.
They're not his kids, nor does he owe any child support.\nsperm donors have no obligation to be fathers, else no guy would donate.
*At least they're all all adults NO CHILD SUPPORT!*
Он за один раз сделал столько клонов? Или 19 раз включал свой принтер?
Damn not bad looking kids.
wow number 9 is looking fineeeee
Décadence sociétal
*Cringy af*
Super weird
Real life 'Vicky Donor'
White pants is real smashable.
Not siblings. Step-siblings.
Weird
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This looks like one of those moments of regret.
Aww, that's so adowable!
So 19 women, decided they wanted him? To be there sperm donor. And that means 19 women were single moms, because none of the kids had previous dad figures in there life....wow im shocked. None of those moms could find a husband
Pls someone tell im not the only one thinks making you wife's  pregnant by somebody else sperm is disgusting
Okay, that Yet-Another-Horse mount is cool and all but what about zergling mount? Or any Starcraft mount for that matter?
Maybe add a surrender and I might come back.
They should change the sound when D.VA jump!!! for a new skin!
The zerg skins are the best...Butcherlisk, and now anubalisk! They should bring out a zerg dehaka......
great skins but i still kinda wish taht the other heroes got some new ones *cough* greymane *cough*
The artists and designers of the Heroes of the Storm team responsible for making those skins (and color palettes) are WAY better than the guys working on the Overwatch skins. Why can't we get those skins, or similar ones like that for the Overwatch heroes in the actual Overwatch game?
blizzard i want the rock 'n' roll racing larry announcer! would pay top dollar for it! ;-) pls do it!
that skin on 0:16 would fit destiny perfectly *call you in Guardian*
way too much overwatch stuff, dva has more skins then heroes that have been in since the beginning. wtf.
I still think tracers master skin looks like a todler's air plain/space shuttle costume.
what about new skins for Greymane
Is that widowmaker at 0:55 ?
D.va the Destroyer is my new waifu.
Can this dva skin PLEASE be added to overwatch, I'd pay for SO MANY LOOTBOXES!
1:36 Deathwing spray.  Because of D.va skin or teasing new hero?
Those pachimaris need to make their way back to OW.
I want purple rib bit Lucio c:
I wish Overwatch had as many skins as HOTS. Variety is fun.
well, rip deathwing as a hero but thats fine.\nits nice that they are releasing so much content and the blizzcon is 1 month away.
D.Va skin looks like something from Doom.
so freaking glad I saved my coins...because supports are never enough!
So, is Ana a new character? If she is, it would be nice to have Widowmaker as her own character as well, instead of being a skin of Nova (that actually looks kinda weird to my eyes).
i am from egypt and i can confirm that woman voice acting is from egypt too because of her accent
they need to add monster truck from rpm racing and it will be able to run oveer terrain and kill people
Can the Shrike skin be a hint that a Destiny hero would appear?
FINALLY a new Varian skin.
Blizzard is killing it. Riot went stagnant after taking a crack at Blizzard's mod game, DotA. Blizzard packs a ton of content in less than half the time Riot snuck in to get paid.
now that's 1 hot dva skin
Finally an Overwatch character that isn't hyper mobile
i am dissapointed the D.va of all people got the deathwing skin... but that might just be because i REALLY hate D.va from both lore and gameplay standpoint.
stop making all the best skins for a game no one wants to play
Please can you look to make some skins for otherwise over looked heroes like Guldan and Nazeebo.
you can smell the destiny 2 marketing from a mile away.
so they are not going to add the beautiful captain amari skin...
PLEASE BLIZZARD WE NEED THE OW SKINS ON OW! MAKE IT HAPPEN
Would be nice with young Ana skin.
So Blizzard, you 're straped for cash? Sure fair enough, here's some of our money.
The Pachimari sprays and Player Icons are the best things in this upcoming patch. Nothing can beat Pachimari.
Sick now we need the Innkeeper!
Meanwhile I still cant bring myself to play this game anymore cause its been broken for 2 years now. Game runs flawlessly even on extreme settings but freezes for 2-3secs every minute making it totally unplayable and unenjoyable. Ive tried every fixes I found on the internet but in the end its Blizzturd who wont fix the mess they created. I used to play HOTS every day back in beta/early launch up until Skeleton king/Johanna release where an update broke the game and has turned it into a unplayable mess.
I just want a female Draenei as a playable character. :o
Nice, Arthas´s Invincible is finaly in the hots!
Well well, this fancy new D.Va skin has been obviously designed by Mei.
Still no greymane love, what a surprise
Would be so cool if we can have D.va Destroyer Skin for Overwatch aswell!
Aw, I was hoping for Junkrat to be released first.
D.Va is becoming the new Nova and Li Ming by receiving new skins and recolours every patch! xD
I need that Red Varian skin.
Where are the GENJI SKINS AT!!?!?!?!?
Varian looks like he is about to rush B...
Looks cool I hope for Junkrad next but Ana is a good choice. And a roadhog skin for Stitches please :)
We need more murlocs in the nexus.
Pink Lucio? Now I can be annoying with my skin too! :D
*sees Deathwing mech do a bunny hop* I've seen everything now..
Still waiting for something resembling Carbon Fiber Dva skin, even if it was default skin recolor.
is anyone know what song name is this in hots?
can you fix the buggs 1st? just had a game where as tyc i couldn't ever place drill. stop pumping out new stuff and fix the silly 2 shots and buggs.
~70% of these skins and mounts are made like take an already existing skin or mount, recolour it, or modify it a little, done, money please. What I'm saying is stop being lazy Blizzard...
Now these are the kinds of skins I am ready to throw my money at!
Can't wait for Ana, but rip Deathwing our lord and savior... D.va's skin is very nice though!
Would be awesome if D.va's Destroyer was actually foreshadowing Deathwing
JA JA MEIN KOMMANDANTE
Invisible horse...hollow man...HOLLOW HORSE.
That D.Va skin is hot fiyah
Wait Lucio is in Hots?
Prophet Velen! ;(
skins are very destiny-ish..subliminal advertising?
Awesome more recolors to dilute the reward pool!
come to brazil
RUSH B (c) Varian
D.VA IS HOT!\n... Literally
Dommage que Varian est deux bouts de plastique au lieu des éclaires du trailer.
Boston Azmodunk.\n👌👌👌
0:57 if urgot got the dunkmaster darius skin\n\n\n\nwrong game
Killer music
Pedobear Varian
Pachi Pachi Pachi!
OW CANCER
min 1:36   Deathwing confirmed
1.Abathur skins plx !!!!!!
STILL WAITING ON ALARAK ANNOUNCER
still no greymane skins...sigh
Hots rules
Deathwing D.Va pretty sick though
hope deathwinf d.va has matching sounds
poor lunara got missed again
op op !!music name?
If Commandant Varian doesn't yell ''ANUUUU'' and/or ''CHEEKI BREEKI'' during parry then I'm uninstalling this game.
hahahaha Finally Ana Can Hit Genji to heal
音乐真难听
Oh goodie... more... sprays?
Wird jemals wieder ein Rehgar skin releast
Will deathwing be next hero?
OOOMG ZERG D.VA BEST SKIN EVER
1:35 they hinting Deathwing tho??
I tried to get into this game but then I realized I had to pay for all the good stuff
okay, stop doing the old skins just adding collor , this is bullshit !
i plan on getting hots what are the most difficult characters that i should i avoid unlocking?
so, ehm nova got the widowmaker skin because u didnt want to put a second sniper into the game. Ana isn't a sniper?
More Valeera skins yet GM hasn't gotten a new skins since the Iphone 6..
*THUMBS UP IF YOU THINK THIS LINER CAN DEFEAT VOLDEMORT IN ONE GO, HAH!*
Quite shooketh she didn't take the official Pottermore sorting hat quiz created by the QUEEN J.K. Rowling herself. She still aced this makeup look no problem tho. I'm just sure she would've gotten a different house if she took the real quiz

Pottermore put me in Gryffindor but this test said You Are ALL THE THINGS! Interesting. It said that I am an almost perfect combination of all four houses and that it is incredibly rare. I love that you took a Sorting Hat Quiz, Nikkie. <3
SHES SO MUCH PRETTY WITHOUT HHER MAKEUP! SHE HAS NO PIMPLES, HOW!?
ummm. anyone else get a broken messy highlighter from her?😞
She should have done the pottermore test
You should do a video about only food no makeup challenge

This makes me cringe
Don't worry London mayor khan will just say this is all normal events in a city...
Oh no!!! More terrorist attacks on our homeland!!! Better bring in more refugees!!!
Religion of peace is so peaceful!
Theresa May might as well join the Labor Socialist Party. She is a cowardly panderer and a traitor to the real British People.\nMeanwhile the Hilary like mayor of London, Khan, sounds like Hilary saying 'we will not be divided'. Your Country is already divided you fool!
Its sad people don't know we are the ones that brought this upon ourselves\nWe destroyed the middle east and destabilized it and fueled a extremist ideology. But hey people rather just blame others for a complicated problem than rather actually doing anything to fix the root of it.\nIgnorance is a bliss.
Didn't you guys expect this? It's normal for living in the city.
I wonder what poor smuck they are going to blame for their false flag.
Why do they have to investigate it to be a terrorist attack.  Nobody has went to wilkinsons and bought an ironing board that blows up
Was probably the new iPhone
they were packed in like sardines.!!.why is it not illegal (for insurance purposes especially).surely if the train is jam packed with sardines,it should be illegal?,just a thought!...if you get on a bus....there is usually a sign stating the amount of people that it is allowed to carry?.yet they pack em in like sardines!.are the sardines then covered by insurance?.......sounds fishy?
Every single terrorist was a moderate once
Inside job. MI5 corrupt terrorists, planted the bomb! All part of the agenda. \nProblem reaction solution!
The leftist our gunna kill us all
London was attacked by Romans, Germans and now terrorists.
Imagine my shock, another terrorist attack. In England of all places! Very surprising!
I wonder were is the al Qaeda the taliban disappeared to now a days.
why wudnt they bomb and kill poor children and people becus there getting sent jail couple month'years and back out again and repeating them self.. wronge evil people .once they leave UKIreland go to there own country learn bomb makeing shouldn't be aloud back to UK ....yes police be around tube station for next week make people feel safe but what happens next week when there none ...24-7 Need police everyday not just wen bomb goes off !!!!!!!\nno were safe....
And yet, as some sort of counter, they'll bring up American gun violence despite our 300 something million population and the gun violence only being prominent in areas that treat guns as they would the devil. And yes, most of the murderers who shoot up people are mentally deterred and not at all politically motivated. Believe it or not, people will do anything for their religion, people are very easily brain-washed.
Most watched city on earth with cctv and know one seen any one walking on a traine with a bucket but if a person wheres air max and a baseball cap they find out where they live in hours and have there picture up a every where ...
The Religion of Peace Strikes Again !!!
I heard of this this morning and I was just like \n\n*just another day in london*
Cowardly, evil subhuman muslime filth need to be butchered off the face of the earth!
Ffs..does this incident qualify for the lighting of candles or does someone have to die..I will phone  sad IQ khan ..he will know
are they sure it wasn't someone using a discontinued samsung galaxy note 7?
That officer ran out of tape and looked anxious
Izlam .......... iz ........... EVIL\nget out and get your loved onez OUT while you can.
Stay calm,  you're being invaded.  They will slaughter you.,,,
This is what happens when you let millions of people whose ideology directly conflicts with the UDHR into a civilized country.
Someone just left their Note 7
Why do these terror attacks happen now?
this is scary i use the London under ground and seeing that really scares me
We should stop all reporting on these incidents. All we are doing is playing into the hands of fools who get glory and recognition on TV and in the papers for what they have done. We are, in effect, keeping their momentum going and playing right into their hands.
A bucket in a train, is that the best false flag theatre MI5 could come up with? LOL.
Looks more like an battery explosion/fire to me and batteries can catch fire and vent very quickly  - it will be interesting to see if this really is a terrorist incident.
All day I was wondering why my school was on lock down and now I realise how close I was to the attack. I get off at Fulham Broadway the station before Parsons Green. Not gonna say my school name but the motto is: Respice Finem.
Some builders paint went on fire
Europe needs to stop letting in all these refugees
Those responsible dont ve to use the tube\nThey are well protected
Yep England keep letting them in, oh and pay for them too..
No doubt there is an investigation underway and maybe security will be found 'wanting'. Politicians will once again be rolling off the heart felt sentiments and maybe some people will call for hanging to be brought back (dead jihadis!) and once again most people will lose sight of the obvious fact, how did they get into our country? Do you recall not so long ago the scandal of murderers being allowed to return from Syria, the only people who can allow that to happen is the government. Bearing that in mind, are the government not criminally complicit for any deaths by terrorist who have returned from Syria? Your views appreciated. God bless you all.
As long as you have a political ties with KSA you expect more than that!
i am sorry to say this, but feal i must. if there is a god, i,m sure he wouldt want all this blood bath and war. the god i grew up to know wants peace and harmony for all mankind and woman, not war and killings and bloodbath, peace and love.
Theres no proof that its an act of terrorism
lol it was the reporter
The world disgusts me now. What people do to each other
Wake up england wake up its getting late
London just can't catch a break can they.
Hey! Wait for the next attack. Till then  let the religion of peace lull the politicians to sleep.
Relax everyone they were obviasly explosions of peace and friendship.
So how's that diversity working out for you England?
Terrorists are like fleas you just can't get rid of them. You can give the kitty a flea bath, treat the kitty with pesticides and put a flea collar on the kitty, and yet the kitty will still have some fleas. So at the very least we should start viewing these terrorists as parasites. Then if somebody ever discovers how to get rid of fleas on a cat, then perhaps we'll know how to eliminate terrorists.
You are maintaining those people's in a welfare State,you are wrong,and this's the results.
Oh hey look, number 14, nice job u.k, making the world see how peaceful and nonviolent your immigrants are. Honestly the u.k is one of the saddest countries now. They're literally being plowed and they're just laying there taking it because they aren't racist so they won't close borders
It was confirmed as a Japanese Terrorist.
This is not a terrorist attack
cheers for funding them US and UK governments.
If we don't remove Kebab, this will just keep happening.
Oh look, it's more diversity...why are y'all complaining, it's just their culture?...don't you go being a racist bigot now, ya' hear?
People in the comments keep making jokes but what they're too blind to see is that this is serious and people have died, and are still going to die. I live here and it's scary knowing that everywhere I go there could be another attack. They have not made it safer because it's happening more often. Bullshit government we have over here!
Prayers from London to London 🙏🙏🙏well done America for not letting those refugees in 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
why do i get te feeling that all this is a lie? i guess im not surprised anymore oh and one more thing TERRORISM HAS NO RELIGION
Mayor Kahn of London is the problem not the solution.
and then the mayor is seen holding a dove...
Another fine job by MI5.  Terrorism is not existent since 1998.
When she says 4 attacks she casually missed out the attacks that were stopped at the last minute.
well at least they have common sense to say what it is right away... Americans (i live) be like... we aren't sure what it is and will let you know next week....
Morons are ruining Europe. European vacation? No thanks.
In other news... Sadiq Khan said he would be awarding the two arrested men the London Peace Award for their efforts.
You've been bombing all life long  , so stop creating motives, to me it seems like that's a strategy of yours to keep your selves involved in the middle eastern affairs, therfore you should bare responsibility for what you do ... stop your war crimes and keep hands off the middle east , be ashamed of your selfs, you're the one's who created the PALESTINIAN problem and you're the ones besides Yankeeland who helps prevent the PALESTINIAN SOLUTION being puppets of Zionism, you must be ashamed of your inhumane acts , stop your ironies you're causing terrorism to then use it as a challenge of media and as an excuse for your war crimes , definitely it's an anti-islamic aggression you getting away with it since ww3 ??? !!!
Is it just me or is the woman's voice really annoying? It sounds like she's spitting in my ears when I have my earphones in.
the religion of peace strikes again.
I even lost count how many times London was attacked this year alone. The old English charming town is gone forever. Sad but true.
Another ISLAMIC attack in London. I'm surprised. Boy that religion of peace really injures and kills a lot of people. Hmmmm
Religion of peace leaves another calling card. Gee.....could it be islamic terror....uh....let me think...reason says yes, but my multicultural side says it can't be....it's so confusing.....NOT!
Religion of Piece !!\none human piece here ...another their
Fake attack
What a peaceful Religion. So peaceful. The religion of peace. Yes. Quite.
Still no word about Iraqi WMDs
Bullshit little bit fire
Thank you ,Sadiq Khan.
Terrorist incident
Any casualities?
London my love
Unbelievable...
Thanks Tony Blair!
Help biafara people in Nigeria.
Probably note 8
latihan. hahaha
And the Breaxit!😕
Ragheads at it again lmao
😣😣😣😣😣😣😣
Those pesky christians!!!
I live in a small village in England where they haven't arrived YET. I keep a purdey  in the kitchen ready for when they do.
BRITAIN BELONGS TO WHITE PEOPLE
I sometimes think to myself what would the world be like without religion 🤔
kill the terrorists' families??
We should hit back, return the serve!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If this was a white man doing this then it would be called mentally ill man blows something up
Muhammad was a pedophile
STAGED!!!
Cutting up donuts -- that is genius!!
Who else missed her Vlogs?!
Estée I was smiling ear to ear when you interviewed Lupita! Like my cheeks are hurting because I'm so delighted for you - it's such a cool opportunity. Lupita has such poise and grace so I can't wait to see the video on Lâncome's UK channel. Love that bit about the camera being as tired as you - legit lolled. So much love, keep killing it Estée! 💜 x
Love seeing you and Allana together. Two Canadian girls making it big! 🤗❤️🇨🇦 Your interview with Lupita went very well. She is a real beauty!
Thank you Lancome for supporting our lovely Estee <3 Great colaboration
Do you ever just pinch yourself and think how did I get here?.  Couldn't happen to a nicer, more genuine person.  ❤️
forever hoping my greyhound and I run into you one day <3
That was so cool! You did a wonderful job.
Missed your vlogs so much 💖
Yaaaay, you went to The Butchers Daughter! That was the place I recommended when you asked about turmeric latte, I hope it was delicious!
Every time I watch your vlogs, I am always reminded how humble and funny you are. This video is the perfect reason why you're my role model. Even though you've accomplished so much, you're always so honest. I appreciate seeing the behind the scenes of everything you do. Thanks for always staying classy yet sassy 😘 xx
Both of my doggies just passed away so thank you Estee for posting a video today to make me feel less alone <3
I dont think I have ever seen donuts look so good like damn!
I'm so happy for you Estée!
wagwan 🅿️engting u r 🔥🔥🔥 hmu w ur bbm pin B😍
Yaaay missed the vlogs! <3
Estée! Seeing your cute Reggie boy over the years inspired me to get a greyhound too! I now have a black greyhound named Ollie and he's the love of my life!
Lupita!! <3 Awesome Estee
Love it, Estee! You do such a great job on these interviews. 😊

Lupita is everything goals, but those arms 😍 #armsgoals
Lupita is so lovely
My two faves 😩😍
Black top, green trousers: dapper kim possible!!!!
Congratulations!!! Wow 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 Lupita!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Oh Lupita is such a nice person! Glad that you have had a chance to talk to her, the interview went really well! Good job Estée! :)
So beautiful! My ideal woman!😍❤️
I paused doing yoga momentarily to admire those greyhounds because OH MY LORDY, THEY WERE SO STUNNING 😍😍
I really miss your videos/vlogs, I can't stop smiling while watching this. Also you look so good! Your outfits (and brows) looks amazing! That Lupita interview too, SO HAPPY FOR YOU💕
since today i am following you again. i unfollowed you about two years ago because i did not like your then- vibe that seemed to me a bit narcissistic. now you are obviously so centered, relaxed and good in your skin. i appreciate your grown up approach to your channel and the responsibility that you are willing to take and to use. plus that i believe that aslan stimulates your creativity which i think is so special. congrats estee, thank you, looking forward following you. hugs from switzerland.
How exciting! I love your vlogs!
💕💕💕
OMG she is just so beautiful, even the way she speaks is just mythical, love love love Lupita!! <3
How exciting, Estee!  You ROCKED it!!!  XOXO from Eagle Rock, CA!
Lupita is beyond gorgeous! Also i loved your outfit with the mango trousers x
Thank you for being so transparent and showing your Lancome guides. There is some times so much inauthenticity in blogging and it is refreshing to watch your videos. ❤️❤️❤️
I love those green trousers!
The 'h' in horchata is silent 😉 the donuts look too good. So delicious
wow such a fantastic opportunity to interview Lupita, she is a fantastic woman! Thanks for sharing this with us Estee, another superb vlog!
OH ESTEE My world is complete again seeing you vlog! They are my partner and I's favourite thing in the world :)
So happy to see an estee vlog in my sub box x loved it x
I miss New York so much love the vlog
I love your blogs more than chocolate... and that is saying something! The reason is definitely just how lovely and classy you are Estee! You are calming, funny and just a joy to watch 😃🤗.
Ummm... Is there any better way to see NYC in one day than spending it meeting the fabulous Lupita??!! She seems so lovely - what a wonderful opportunity!! I absolutely love the black heels you wore at the end! They showcase toe cleavage so chicly!! The doughnuts also looked like they were amazing!! What a wonderful vlog - gracias!
Great video, Estée, and it's good to see you back! An FYI: if you're ever feeling like you need a bit of home comfort, there's a Canadian selling poutine, the real McCoy, on Brick Lane at a food stand. My daughter went and she said it's authentic! 💕
Thank you for your video.

Hi Estée have u lost weight recently ? Probably because we haven't seen u much on YouTube looks like u have
Estee please be safe in London since Theresa May called for martial law. Cray!
Yasss Estée 💕🙌🏼 killing it like always, and you did great on the interview ✨
estée you looked really hot in that evening outfit!💕
Omg I remember when you and Claire got those dough doughnuts way back when! I'm so excited to watch the interview with Lupita too, I can tell you killed that interview :)
Thanks for making videos!! Love the vlogs!! Wide angle lens is making me ill. Why so wide?
Lupita is effing beautiful and seems like a cool person!
Ohhh I have to share this after watching the interview! I'm a nurse and 99% of the time on my shifts I wear barely any makeup. Mostly because of the hospital, i just feel gross with it, but also because it somehow just gets all over my face by the end of the shift. My coworker, on the hand, is just how Lupita describes herself - wearing all sorts of lipsticks based on what she feels like that day. My coworker will wear anything from a dark red to a bright plum. And somehow it stays put all day! I really don't know how she does it!
We actually started the process of getting a greyhound a while back (inspired by Reggie of course!) but they wouldn't let us because I have a young daughter 😭😭😭
Psst the original Dough is in Brooklyn ... I think it's better, cooler at least! Donuts opposite the projects.
That Sephora and Dough Donut shop is literally across the street from my job ☺️ how cool would it have been to run into you!! 😊
Are you employed by Lancôme?? I love your sense of style!
Well, I'm sure the trip was worth it! 😉😃
What camera do you use for vloging!? the video quality is amazing!!! love everything you do:)
Lupita is such an amazing human being and so goregous
from the minute i saw her in that pastel blue dress she has been my girl crush.  Lupita is the total package.
Ohh lady, I'm so happy for you! This was amazing! ☺️
On first name bases with oscar winners ! Well done !
So, so, so, SO good to have you back!!!
You're look at the beginning is very Elaine from Seinfeld 👍👍
Aaah never been to New York,but thanks to Claire Marshall Doug doughnuts is definitely a place I need to visit if I am ever there! Loved coming along to this city with you :)) x
I went to Dough when I lived in NY because of you and now seeing you going there in the vlog made me so happy!!
You did an awesome job interviewing Lupita! What an honor to meet her; she looked stunning! Both of you make great ambassadors for Lancôme. Thanks for sharing NYC with us, even if only a few hours. ❤️
loved this video! keep it up estée! <3 <3
Love the Church's Estee, my parents' family business is selling English handmade shoes (repairing them is the family tradition really, a family tree of shoe repairers!) and we also sell Barkers which have some pretty colourful ones out atm for ladies and gents, just thought you might like to browse their ladies collection too :) loooong time fan of your videos, love them! xx
Your vlogs are the best! I found myself smiling throughout the video :)
wow you two are so beautiful!! Love you ♥
You have such an attractive way talking with people, I feel like I could hear you talk with me all day! Beautiful vlog tho 💖💛
Awwww...I missed this, whoop! PS: That leather skirt is hawt on you whoa, Lady!
It's true every time I see Estée interview people in her vlogs she does such an amazing job! Ps those donuts looked amazingggg 🍩
So good to have you back, I've come home😊
Aww Estée, I saw a post on one of the Greyhound Facebook groups I follow about a lady meeting you in NYC with her doggies, it caused quite the stir in our little group, everyone was so excited! My boyfriend and I adopted our greyhound Ash because we fell in love with Reggie, it was the best decision we've ever made, they are such gorgeous sweet gentle dogs, truly magical characters with the biggest hearts :) Thank you for all you do to raise awareness of team pointy, I'm sure there are loads of other people like myself who adopted a greyhound after seeing Reggie, you're doing a fab job at spreading the word about how awesome these doggies are.  xxx
I was just reading Bloom and saw that you uploaded! Love you and your amazing videos Estee!
I understand why you've stopped uploading videos lately but that has made me realise how much I enjoy watching your videos. Thank you for doing your job with happiness and positivity , you deserve the best. :)
You are frickin glowing in the first clip!!!
Looks like you jumped out of a 50s men's clothing commercial. Super groovy.
YOU GO GURL! So proud of you!!!! I'm praying one day that I visit home in NY you will be there. Or when I eventually travel to London I could meet you. Please come to Atlanta.
I think your style was kinda granny :P
Gosh Lupita is like a godess, and that deep voice... daaamn
Estee - where are your blue earrings from? I love them!
Estée! You also inspired me to rescue a greyhound as we unfortunately still have greyhound racing here in Sydney :(
That leather skirt tho. <3
I would be nervous too, she looks like the darkness within
Total Shit,neanderthls need to die from cancer quicker!
Am I the only person who's never heard of Lupita?
Doggies!!! i'm the same when it comes to beagles :)))
coming to stalk you in my robe soon, miss u already
Loved this so much. Estee you are the REALEST. Thank you for that xx
Hahaha poor sleepy, insane estee
Next time you're in NYC you should try The Doughnut Project. SO GOOOOD. I love Dough so much as well, but the Doughtnut Project might be my number one pick in New York. I'm drooling.
gurl, you could've used a better lighting!!!!!
Who is the lady singing? BBC can you list the back up singers name too in the description. Think they deserve that much. Thanks!
VULA MALINGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How's he find time for this with prepping for the champs league at the same time
PLEASE release this version on Apple Music
Better than the original
Please put this on Spotify 🙏🙏

Weak as fuck \nOnly white boys listen to Lukaku
If you read back what you just said it is jibberish. Are you just a man that can rhyme dot with tot?
Such a great cover. The vocalist is called vula and shes a uk legend. Does vocals for everyone and collabed with basment jaxx back in the day.
Yea gotta admit that was levels !!! Espesh that las on the Vocals
Can't understand a word Emile Heskey is saying.
I love this too much🙌🏾😭
*this is a nice version of stormzy*
Stormzy the best thing to come out of the UK in a long time
The girl in the back has a mad voice real talk, compliments the song nicely
All the students ready to jump on his dick,he's sooo edgy,love him and his vibe and that thing he does,he's goat and all that other bollocks they do when hearing him
Stormzy = music for 14 year old white girls!
george the poet much?
This sounds so good😍😍😍
Mad to think that Stormzy was 7 (just a rain cloud) when this track first came out!
How disgusting is Tulisa's cover compared to this
Omg I loved the original when I was small!!!! This is so nice to listen to tho, very chill! Good job to everyone x
Reminds me of back home 💜💜
No talent at all, he just talks, that's it
This is acc fire Romelu well done mate
Stormzy should die already. He just ruined a classic.
'Every time I touch the mic they say BO!'
The singers are AMAZING 😍
Put it on itunes
The more I listen to this, the more I love it
Is she singing for a bar of chocolate 🍫
Should get a release providing credit is given to the original artists too
😫💖💖💖I fell in love again
This has made my day. Song brings back so many good memories.
The singers are brilliant. His style of rap, maybe his accent just reminds me of googoogaga baby talk though...
This is a little bitty litty
stormzy at his best in the bbc  radio1 live lounge
Would be pretty great if it were not for Stormzy
Ayee I like his flow
Youngers don't even know this tune , but they gunna beg it now.
Yes boi
This is wicked
BOOM! Heavy version.
This is shit.\nShe's good, but he's crap.
I need the lyrics!!
Hahahah stormz on the dadada 🤣🤣 made it littttt

Stormzy is amazing 😂😂😂😂😂
Peace for my ears  ! 😇 Amazingly perfect ! 👌
Blk dude rapping about being sweet like Chocolate lol
Saucy
Stormzy went in!
1:20 She is soo cute
Can't take British rap serious. How does this man make money from singing?
I love stormzy but he ruined this song. He destroyed a classic.
Had this on repeat all weekend (y)
Awful, backing singers were the stars.
Needs eloqution lessons.
Laaaaaame !
100% pure garbage
Amazing job 🔥
The back up singer likes too much chocolate.
Stormzy has turned into the biggest pussy
I hope I'm not the only one but I hate asuka she is going to ruin the raw women's division honestly bc of her I might not even watch raw which would be hard bc SASHA is my fav but asuka is just gonna ruin EVERYTHING
Cathy Kelley for Raw Women's Champion!
Of course we're freaking out, who wouldn't? I mean, not in a positive way, IN A NEGATIVE way because RAW is well-known for messing up big stars like Bailey, Sasha and the rest. Now, Asuka?! Jesus Christ...
ASUKA / CATHY / RONDA - I see them I get a bulge. My fault?
welp time for asuka to not matter in the wwe anymore
Can't believe Americans still think wrestling is real 🤣
0:03 really missed her chance to say WELL I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT SOME BAAAD NEEEWWS
Asuka. Raw Women-s Championship FOREVER??  Like in NXT.
Freakin' awesome news, can't wait.
R.I.P. Asuka
It is rumored that asuka is going to debut after No Mercy and her first opponent is Emma , does that means that emma is going to win the title at No Mercy and asuka challenges her for the title ?
I hope she comes tonight to beat the living slag out of alexa bliss
She will be ruined within 3 months, guaranteed.
I'll be snickering when she gets booked to lose after 2 months via roll up. She deserves it for not putting anyone in NXT over.
Asuka is like woman Daniel Bryan
Yeh, fans are worried Asuka is coming to Raw...........................only to have Vince book her terrible and ruin her like Bayley. Not only that but have her lose her streak on Raw, or a B-level PPV like No Mercy or even have Emma pin her in a distraction roll up.
Give Asuka match with Alexa for women's championship
Oh well it was nice while it lasted. Her career will be ruined on RAW.
Probably because they're worried for her career
No im not freakin out. Just a japanese no mic work just kicking no look girl
NXT talent either dies on RAW or has no thought how to use it before they become just another piece. Anyone looking forward to Asuka becoming a four time Women's Champion in a span of three months?
Great, someone else who will have a small script because of her english
Yea fans are freaking out because the demotion to the main roster hasn't  been so great for NXT call ups
Can't Wait 4 That, She Will Be in a Class All By Herself
We're freaking out because we know she will be ruined!\n\nAlso, WWE uses fans instead of WWE Universe WTF?!
😘😘😘
I do NOT trust this creative team to know what to do with her.
Welcome to RAW. The empress of tomorrow
I'm not definitely freaking out because I can care less about her coming anywhere she was better on nxt because I never watched that
If alexa defeats asuka i am done
no one is ready for Asuka
Nia will never ever taste what it's like to be champion once Asuka gets there. She had her chance twice for Asuka's NXT title and she was defeated twice. Even without Asuka on Raw she never became champion at all. What more with Asuka there?
Asuka Is Going To Win The Raw Women's Championship Easily
asuka didn't steal a thunder, she didn't even need to\nbecause she's the empress of tommorow!\nthe sun! asuka!!
Check this video to know the difference between Chinese burger and Mcdonald or Burger King burger  https://youtu.be/QqRkhtaVBM0
1 Japan Female Wrestler left NXT and 1 one more Japan Female Wrestler join NXT Womens Division
Top 5 wrestler in WWE right now whether it is men or women.
Rip, get ready for asuka to lose her debut
Fans are freaking out because Vince will bury her
if fans were crazy it would have been depicted by video views\nasuka just another female wrestler
im not freaking out :))))) im really sad for raw womens division :))))))) plus her brock lesnar type of character will flop and wwe will keep pushing her in spite of that :(
SD Live would have been better or she'll end up like Bayley
Asuka is heading to Raw Women's Division where she beats almost every Women back then on NXT. While she haven't faced most in the SD Live Women's Division. Makes sense since Raw Women's Division needs a boost I guess
I hate this girl she just want money 💰she should have worked in the movie IT
She'll lose her first match on the call up against Dana Brooks calling it because Raw.
but what about braun and lesnar tho?
I have a question, so does her undefeated streak from NXT continue when she arrives to RAW or does it it start over!?
Asuka is going to be held back on how hard she can hit others and move set will be sliced in half. Her finisher will be changed to a damn super kick.
I just need a match Fatal-4-Way Elimination.\n\n•John Cena + Nikki Bella\n                    VS.\n•CM Punk + AJ Lee\n                    VS.\n•The Miz +Maryse\n                    VS.\n•Carmella + James Ellsworth
Well come To #Row
Vince will have Mickey James squash her in her RAW debut.
RAWにアスカ被害者の会ができちゃうのか…。(既に何人か犠牲者出てるけど)
Another roster addition that creative won't have a clue what to do with
she will be ruined within first 2 weeks on raw  MARK THIS WORDS
now we wait for MVP
*DO NOT RUIN ASUKA OR WE RIOT!*
Nice job WWE, you ruined the surprise. Idiots.
freaking out at the fact that Asuka is going to get buried
Vince and Kevin Dunn are going to ruin her on the main roster.
https://youtu.be/t0mAtYJja0c\nBest wwe video ever watch now
Asuka will bury everyone in the RAW division
Asuka going to bury all the women on raw but Alexa because they love blondes
This is promotion mode ???😂😂😂😂\nWe want fight
Watch Out... A REAL Woman Wrestler arrived.
Find the difference 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕Subscribe 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Look at this loser, running away from NXT before Liv Morgan could defeat her so she can keep her little streak. Well you can keep it, for now! NOBODIES READING FOR LIV MORGAN!!!!

Chances are you won't even see this but I hope you start doing more themed cakes cookies, cake pops etc.

For all you you negative fake fans, fuck off!!!! In Klopp i trust and future looks good. KEEP THE SPIRIT HIGH. YNWA SWEDEN
klopp is a world class manager ...to any fan commenting otherwize you're not a real fan ...if you can't support us when we draw or loose then you're not a true fan ...!!
Calm the fuck down you bunch of infantile imbeciles. Klopp's got at least 5 more years to build a team. We haven't got money on the scale of you-know-whos nor the type of manager who needs endless amounts of cash to buy, sell and buy again, top quality players. Klopp will bring us success in his own way and time. Have some patience and take it on the chin. I know some of you crave bragging rights cause your mate's are laughing at you and your shit team. Man up ffs!
be angry all you want but atleast find a good enough reason to be. People slating the defence: apart from the defensive error the defense delt brilliantly with all that Burnley offered, robbos positioning was exceptional.\nPeople slating the attack: You have the right to criticize the forwards for not linking up as well as they could have but ultimately we did make enough chances and apart from the final pass we looked to break them down. Keep in mind that this lot kept out Chelsea and spurs as well, but every draw or negative result is takn in a generalised manner by Liverpool fans.\nWe had a plan, they had a plan, they executed theirs better than we did ours, but we also got unlucky. I take positives from the fact we have the elememnts now with coutinho playing deep to open up smaller teams, ultimately when this particular lineup of players gels together I can see us doing bits. We've already seen our counter attacking lineup, with gini can and hendo tear it up.
Wow, i didn't know how toxic the liverpool fan base is! You're not real fans, please accept, klopp deserves better than you people.
The German Brendan Rodgers.
We are liverpool... our manager will do right by the club. Not signing for sake of signing. He is building a tean not buying a team like other clubs .
Man Im starting to get sick and tired of these so-called fans posting their bullshit online, the LFC Facebook page is full of fucking idiots trashing the team and now this comment section is getting worse, if you are a Liverpool fan then get behind the team, if not then fuck off. #COYR #YNWA #LIVERPOOLFOREVER
One man team - no Mane no win.
I was a Liverpool fan before most of the people in this comment section were born. But you know what, I agree with them. Klopp is a moron, he's blinded by his own ego and never admits to any of his mistakes. Also, he's stubborn, the reason we dont have any new center backs is because it's an admission of fault from his part if he buys one. Remember, all last season he said we have a great defence and that we don't need new players. So he does't want to go back on his statement. That's how stubborn and dumb he is. This team won't win anything, mark my words. I hope Klopp gets fired before the January window, so we can get a proper defence in place.

O and time 6.20 he going Newcastle Lmao and the team going Manchester Lmao told u not top top management shame lfc are a good club and think they use recruitment agency when they doing the hireing lol
Win/lose/draw...players get paid the same wage, dock em and you'll see improvements and the chaff will be separated and sold for peanuts to Arsenal
Remember when we had Coates Enrique Borini and Lambert?😭 it's not crisis mode yet stick together
Should have signed a CB
Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. Fans are so emotional and fickle. two weeks ago after the arsenal game everyone was on top of the world. now, two draws and a loss and it's like we need to support the team in times like these comments. yes, our defense is shit but it's early days. A couple wins and we are back in the race and it's group stage in the CL, all with 1 pt. everyone fukn relax.
Get the results & talk less, Old Bob just get the results to do his talking!!!!!

I agree the defence is shocking and we need to sort it out. But we don't need to sack him, give him some time. I understand he has been manager for a while now but let's not be a Chelsea or man city. Let the manager do his job. If we sack him,  who do we get in?. There is nobody so let's get behind the team.
Wait until we get Keita we will never concede. \n\nKlopp is doing the right Thing, fair enough we didn't get a cb in the window but what u gotta remember: \nMane: Sent off\nLallana: Injured\nClyne: Injured\nThat's 3 of our main starters out and yes we did basically have our main team out but lovren wasn't in it, and the three people I mentioned I believe could change the team easily. And for all the fake fans who are complaining are not true fans. Like if ur a true fan. #YNWA
Fraud get out of our club #ynwa
We drew a game against a team that have had results against Chelsea and Spurs. I didn't go the game but I listened to it and watched extended highlights. It very much looked/sounded like we battered them. I'm a little bit bored of the goalkeeper/defence debate. They're all good players, they don't get any protection from the midfield, as the midfield are intent on marauding forward. It will get tweaked and we will put together a decent run of results. All the haters need to 'calm down'.
5-0 drubbing from city, 1-1 against Burnley at Anfield..\n\nPeople are upset because early on, we haven't seen any improvement from last season (so far) people are angry, and no one has a right to say that you can't get angry as a fan, it's like saying you can't be a human being and support Liverpool. Shut the fuck up. \n\nME personally, I trust in Klopp, and he is getting a rude lesson in the premier league at the moment, and it's in these times managers learn, and become better. \n\nI'm patient, but don't say to someone they're not a fan because they're pissed off, not everyone is going to rationalise things in the same way. We go again.
Aaaaargh! Tough pill to swallow, that. Wasteful again in front on goal. Feels like 2 points dropped. Disappointing. Although, that's not to say that Salah's goal was amazing! He was probably the best player on the pitch in red today. Again, he looked dangerous, and £34 million now looks like a steal. Solanke looked good when he came off. Phil Coutinho also looked dedicated. Defensive frailties again costing us, same old Liverpool! Let's try and be more ruthless next time. \nC'mon Liverpool! We go again against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday night in the League Cup. C'mon Redmen! #YNWA ⚽️🔴❤️
Mashraf Brownie well said buddy...Klopp was the best thing that has happened to this club in years...now you want him gone😂😂😂 you fuck tards😭 HE HAS MY BACKING, HES MY MANAGER YOU FUCKERS
Actually ,this time we didn't draw because of the defence.We lost point today because we missed too many easy chances
Football is for nerds.\n\nPlay League of Legends scrubs
Klopp is a one trick pony and never seems to learn from his mistakesThis defence are leauge of lreland standard,,,,,no offence to leauge of lreland
has he won a trophy at Liverpool yet?
Excuses galore. There is always   if ,but , only . JK is a great guy but not a great manager. We now sit 5 points off the top and the season as really only just started. I fear the winter as we get injuries, suspensions and involved in more and more competitions. Until we can go to places like Watford and win 6   0 then we will always be average . If we do not buy at least 4/5 decent players inc a goalkeeper then we will be out of all competitions by March . I have no doubt we will field a weak team in Jan for the FA cup and JK only aim will be fourth place for UCL again. Which to me is pointless if you are never going to win it .
disgusting behaviour by the club should have sol phil and bou9ght a striket
we are going on a winless streak till manu game ifwepay like thid
he needs to make subs earlier
To all the Liverpool fans getting irritated about negative comments. This is what Arsenal fans go through every year from 2003.
All this klopp hate is ridiculous. Sure the defence is leaky there's no denying that. But he has assembled one of the best attacking squads in Europe. Period. People are too impatient. 2 seasons in charge and he's brought us to to Europa final and within the top 4. Rodgers had his one off season which brought us close to the English title and before him was the epic champions league title in 06. Rome wasn't built in a day and quite frankly even if we aren't a title contender this season we play one of the best football on our best day (which honestly aren't far between each other). I have faith in klopp and our squad and I have faith he will continue to build and assemble a title winning team. And a question to all the klopp haters: what manager are you guys praying for that is available to just come and suddenly win titles?  Klopp and the reds knows there's an army of faithful who will always walk with you #ynwa
Patience is the key for success. LFC fans please give time to this guy. Because in dortmund he had time and independent to take decisions and another main reason was at that time, no other club had so much money to buy ready made players. For eg see Burnley they are happy with one point also because they have no money and fully support their manager. They think whatever he do is good for Burnley. When they where religated he was the manager and now also he is the manager.we have to learn from Burnley,because this guy  is much better than plastic managers like jose and pep.
Always a lot of talks... bla bla bla... and after dramatic disaster with City there is a worse match against Burnley. All team puts effort to attack, to support Salah but they don't arrive much goals...and, on the other hand, defense is too much under pressure collapsing first or later!  SALAH left Chelsea and Chelsea started to win again.!  Klopp & Flopp a strong disaster.!😂😂😂😂😂
Klopp \n\nPro's\n\nExciting attacking football\nPotential to smack sides of all abilties\nMotivating\n\nCon's\n\nDefending transition, since the fullbacks get really high up the park as he attacks in numbers\nEgo and stubborn i.e. won't add an extra defender to defend a lead.
a lot of weekend/game day managers in here that think klopp doesn't have the defense sorted and think he's naive/arrogant to the quality of the back performances. hard to think you can't comprehend that he probably wanted to buy specific defenders, and had x,y,z plans and adjustments for defense. the reality of the deals not being closed in the window (not in his control) means he has no choice but to show positive reenforcement in the belief and work rate of the players he has to work with. on the pitch for game day or in the training grounds and at the end of the day—it's always the players, not the manager. if he doesn't (in the public eye) show that he at least believes in the system and their ability to play in it—then the players wouldn't give any shit either.
Fucking idiot turning into Wenger! Play Gomes centre back! play two defensive midfielders or even play 5 at the ffs 😂 find a fucking solution! Dropping and replacing klavan and lovren with each other is a fucking waste

Win lose or draw it's Liverpool forever. We are going trough a bad patch now but it will get better all clubs do at some point in the season it's better for us to get it over with early. We will get new players in January and finish the season strong. Jurgen knows what he is doing we just have to have faith in him and give more time. He is the best manager we have had in a long time.
When ur winning ur happiest fans in england but soon as u lose or draw u never stop fucking moaning stfu u shit fans UTC🔴🔵🔴🔵
Disappointed with all the negative comments.. we have to keep encouraging and supporting him and the team no matter what! #YNWA
Flopp is changing the team so often he is destroying the team not building it. Players have bad moral. Not to mention lack of tactic, players are running like zombies with no apparent plan. he is wearing them down. He plays players out of position, does not use ones he has, delays changes, did I say he does not study the different teams we play. He probably tell the players come on boyz go there do your thing, and thats the plan de jour and every jour
I hate what we are right now and I won't excuse anything, that being said I won't stop supporting both manager and players. If you think different then you should check your self\nKlopp is a world class manager who has access to world class coaches, our owners seem a bit tight in terms of net spend but we have improved. I am not satisfied, I complain but I do not wish Klopp out as that would be stupid.
The best manager in the world!!! Our klopp!!
Created enough chances? We had 2-3 real good ones, one of them leading to the goal. That's pathetic if you have 150% ball possession. Klopp needs to take a cold shower.
Stick together still early days
This guy never has any fucking answers for anything on or off the pitch. What a pathetic excuse for a manager.
Im a Liverpool fan but this is so true:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttack wins you games,defence wins you titles.   Btw im not Klopp out.Im defence out new defence in (especially cb's)
theirs only 2 reasons we didnt improve the defence Klopp or the owners.We had a supposed £2000million to spend ,and we spent at the most £50 million at the least £30million after selling players.Something is definitely wrong .Why will no one ask him directly why we didnt improve the defence ,its a joke to every other team and their supporters.I feel embarrassed
If liverpool defenders were more confident in the air  challenge better and were tighter at the back we would not concede as many goals.
All WHO says klopp out Are fake fans
First time i am a doubting this man, its the same old shite. This season was supposed to be different, in reality very much the same. Obviously is a brilliant manager, but teams have figured us out and he has no answer to this. I can only hope he will soon.
Solanke  must start next match ,he's more proactive in attack than Than Firmino.
If you are #KloppOut then you're simply plastic and deluded.
I’m sorry the back 4 is apauling I don’t know what to say. It’s bs, Why don’t we put Moreno LW?? Everyone moans about him playing to high when he’s in LB why don’t we try him LW whilst Mane is out, push firmino back to his no. 9 role. It’s hopeless,  Klopp said ‘there was no CenterBacks on offer’ De Virj from Lazio, Koulibaly, anyone but Klavan and Lovren. I feel sorry for Matip for what he has to play with. Come on guys it’s not hard. If u take in the fans opinions and ideas maybe just maybe we might do something. Ideally I don’t wanna see Klopp go But I DO wanna see changes. It’s BS!!! COYR // YNWA
so many negative comments and klopp out screamers. i understand that but people are angry about those point losses over and over but i also think you need to realize that liverpool haven't been an elite team for many years now. yes they need to address defense but its easier said than done. the marked for middle inns is such small and once anyone on high skill level hits the market you compete with lots of top clubs. even city had huge probs to find defenders. and what i want to add cause of all this negativity after the sevilla game - just please don't forget that pool hasn't been real madrid the past 2 years. sevilla won the euro league 3 times in a row. spanish top team since years. and liverpool dominated and could have lead 4-1 at half. plenty of things to improve but its not all that dark
With or without Coutinho LiverJail is still disappointing!\nThey should let him go! Karma is punishing Klop!
As a LFC Fans, I'm extremely disappointed and also very angry seeing this team playing dirty football. Sturridge was not good at all today and he was still on the pitch. Solanke is better and he never plays always on this bloody bench. klopp always use the same plays so it doesn't shock me if small team is beating us. Spending lots of money on good player and they don't even play. Nowadays I'm asking myself if klopp is a great manager or not. In every we can see the same mistake everywhere. \nSubstitution after 75' of play, even if the team is loosing. in 15', the game can't change with only one fresh player. \nKlopp so disappointing to have as LFC manager
I am a diehard Liverpool fan and I have always supported Klopp but to be honest Klopp is stubborn and it costing us a lot. I wonder why he wants so much forwards and midfielders without sorting out the defense, it's not like he didn't know about it all along. I never thought I would be saying this but I don't think Klopp is good enof for Liverpool
After 15mins you could predict how the game is going to end, Klopp is an excellent manager so is Sean Dyche for getting a point out of this game, well done to him, however the focus must be on how Klopp fields his team, in my opinion he should have started the game with solkane and ox, you could see firmino and salah was looking tired. Klopp will win games with this side Gk- Ward , LB -Robertson, CB -Matip, CB Gomez, RB -Alexander, MF -Couthino, Henderson, GIGI, FW- Mane, Daniel, Salah. Subs - Simon, Lovren, Firmino, ox, solanke. Comment your best xi LFC Fans.
Time is ticking now on this manager, his choices in the transfer windows are turning out to be woeful. Any defensive coaches work at Melwood?
Disappointed but we need to keep going and believe in Klopp. thought we were could have been more clinical and credit to Burnley they were very disciplined. YNWA
Wtf was that!?I'm sick of this shit.Klopp with a hard heart I'm telling you man...you are wasteing everybody's time.The bad news is that you could do more but you are like all germans...stubborn,in everything good or bad.After 2 years you only have 4 players Mane Matip Salah and Wijnaldum and Milner mostly on the bench so doesn't count.Taday was bad luck but we could easyly lose.Poor plan for first 11,no plan B and nothing  good in the future only a 6th place maybe.
These Klopp out comments aren't Liverpool fans. You see the same exact guys on other videos declaring themselves as Manc fans. Don't fall for it, jeez.
rome wasn't built in a day. he inherited lovern, Henderson and  Firminio what do you expect lol\n\nbe patient
Fuck you kloop we are sick an tired off your fucking hope  gooooooooooo
I haven't been critical of Klopp but I have been noticing he is not really good at game management. The times at which he makes substitutions always baffles me. I think he is too much of a patient person overall. The substitutions are sometimes too late in the game to have an impact and why the hell didn't OX start out wide over Firmino he needs rest anyways smh
Be patient , good game judge him after this month
trent can't cross klavan can't head pass nor has the confidence to drive the ball and force the issue everyone was way to stagnant and standing around at times all that being said this is my elf cup XI ward trent klavan lovren moreno- gini hendo ox-solanke coutinho firminho coutinho needs to play more forward until mane comes back
lets see what excuses KLOOP comes up with this time
Lmao Klopp put Liverpool back in the champions league and this the thanks he gets foh
Everybody saying we need a new center back but IMO we also need a proper defensive mid too, even if we buy a good defender we will still make the same mistakes.
Strap in. Could be a long road. \n\nAn Arsenal sympathiser.
I don't know how can you enter the season with klavan, matib, Milner, moreno, lovren, the rest are trash. Does he really thought he's gonna win the league with this trash ass niggas come on man I can see you built the midfield and the front line well done on that but you are not interested in defenders. You need to steal some mourinho tactics. If this midgets on the front line face those tall and strong guys from Manchester believe me this guy is talking about improvements on nothing.
How can you put Klavan after all his bloopers in defense? Klopp are you blind? Stupid? Or corrupt may be players pay you bribe for gaming time?????????
klaven is useles and lovren in defence. kloop needs to put gomez in in central defence
Remember  spurs only managed a draw today. I bet we beat Leicester  next week .
no mane no party
Lol Liverpool r sponsored by new balance... Fitting!
Love his wig.
Fuck Klavan
Looserpool
Fancy doing a swapsy for Koeman ?
DID WE MISS SADIO MANE TODAY?
Its your wrong doing\nNot signing defenders and DM. 18 months in and defence is worse. The issue against orgnized teams, do you go and buy a strong striker who can finish and bully defenders? No yiu waste 40 on ox the overrated Ibe\n\nCharisma buy you time. Fans like you, but same stupid mistakes for 18 months! Tick tock Mr deluded one
To all the people who don't understand how the transfer market panned out , \nKlopp didn't buy an CB because FSG put out a statement without the knowledge of klopp which inhibited klopp to go for his top target . \nNow sure we can bitch and moan we didn't get a plan B, but that plan B ain't giving us a chance to win a title so we've waited 20+ years already , instead of putting all that baggage unfairly on klopp with half a squad that isn't his players, maybe it's worth waiting an extra couple years and for once get top targets instead of settling for plan b ... social media has just given license to too many people who's impatience would've seen shankley sacked in this era... shame
HOW CAN LIVERPOOL FANS SUDDENLY TURN THEIR BACK ON THIS GUY ITS ONLY BEEN 5 GAMES REMEMBER BURNLEY BEAT CHELSEA, DREW TOTTENHAM .....STOP BEING PLASTIC FANS OTHERWISE IF KLOPP GOES IT WILL BE FURTHER DISASTER FOR YOU PEOPLE NO BETTER COACH IS AVAILAIBLE
Keita. Mane. Salah. Let the man build a team. Unless you want to sign another Welsh pirlo.
Will lfc win a trophy this season ?????   Answer = NO --- fact.
I love Liverpool and support them even when we played shit. But I cannot forgive Klopp for 2 main reasons: \n1) Renewing and extending contracts of our most vulnerable players and those who are not consistent let alone 'world class'. Who are those players? Simon Mingolet and Dejan Lovren got contract extensions during Klopp..baffles me to why it was done.\n2) He had 4 transfer windows..okay let's just say 2 windows  (summer windows) and he did NOT fix the part we were most lacking in..i.e Goalkeeper and Centre Back. We infact sold one CB..the jury is out if Sakho should have returned or not. Fact is we have not improved defensively when it was so obvious. \nAttacking we are v good. No doubt. But you cannot win leagues with leaky defences. Period. He's got till January to fix this in the window or I'm totally going Anti Klopp.
I can name 500 defenders better than fuckin Klavan. Utter utter dogshit!!🐕💩If Klopp can not see what everyone else sees at Anfield today then he's a cunt. His fault for not strengthening at Centre half end of.
Haha you scrouse shit heads  cant even beat Burnley , Glory glory man United , Glory glory man United :)
ASK KLOPP THIS:\n\nJurgen, your title rivals beat you 5 - 0 and then you draw both your next games, one of them to so called inferior opposition...who will Liverpool beat next?\n\nThe world has no clue who we will beat and who we wont beat, can you give us a clue whats going on?
We are in Champion's League.  We have a team that has a chance to do something good.  Klopp is building a good team. He made a mistake not to get a good defender but we need to keep supporting.
Gk- Mignolet\nRb- Clyne\nCb- Matip\nCb- Gomez\nLb- Robertson\nDm- Can\nCm- Lallana\nCm- Coutinho\nRf- Salah\nLf- Mane\nCf- Firmino\n\nPlay this team and we'll win! Just need our injured players back 😢

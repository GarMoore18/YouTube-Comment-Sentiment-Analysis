He said “peanut butter day as shit”😂
Golden State Warriors Will Sweep The Cavs In The NBA Finals 2018
Glad to see them ballin’ together again.
Lebron is cursing and shit... I don't know why people would think he would leave , we never saw him that happy.

This nigga LeBron the real life Mr Krabs
This is the best video of all-time
Coach Lou, can Dwade & I stack our beds on top of each? So much room for activities
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
How these guys have haters is beyond me... you give your heart out every night for 10+ years, keep you cool in the media, battle through injuries and adversity, train non-stop every night... and people want to talk shit.
Dewayne wade gay ass chasing dick ass. I lost all respect for wade we don’t want your trash ass to retire here bitch.
who will be Cleveland's starting 5?
Best duo in nba history
that's a great question from Dwade about Cleveland. I'm from akron Ohio and stayed in the akron area. Never had i ever heard the term the land until right before the playoffs in 2016.
Who is LeBron James and Dwayne Wade
That bromance is a little sus s/o to them
It is said that Hazrat Dawood (A.S) Qoum of about 70,000 Prople lived near the bank of Sea aella . They were very happy. Allah examine them by ordering them not to do fishing on saturday.\nhttp://www.islam360.ga/2017/10/how-12000-human-beings-turned-into.html
Am I coming off The Bench tonight? I don't know! Ask Coach #The Hiker (Movie African)
I know this shit probably lame asf but can you guys check out me and my nigga freestyle tape. I just want some constructive criticism for the next one. Thanks to everyone who checks it out🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯 https://soundcloud.com/kwilksp/sets/19-ep
Rachel was about to start some drama after LeBron made that kid comment, but Wade curved that shit & switched the subject lmaooo veteran move
aww it's crazy. lebron james i had dated many guys whom didnt have a father figure in their lives. it's crazy but true
Dwayne wade like I came here for another ring..
They are so funny 😂
I hear so much shit about Lebron and Wade getting old that I forget they’re only in their 30s.  They look young and energized in this video
this interview is like dajavu, I think i've seen I similar one of these two before talking same way..
Happy these two are reunited
Seeing these two duo is a breath of fresh air! 🔥👑
They are friendship goals
Kyrie a kid facts if you disagree then you suck dick simple end of story
Good stuff I like the chemistry pretty funny the way wade just crashing at your place awesome
Fakest person I’ve ever seen glad he’s 3 out of 8 in the finals
wow. I need a reality show
I love there friendship these dudes are true friends not NBA friends
Kirie the Kid :))
Lebron, people will like you more when you come out of the closet.
he still has pandora with commercials bcuz he gets tidal for free lol \nhes still cheap though lol
This is baby Ricardo help him grow up!\n  ( • - • )__     (•-•)\n/(        )         (__)\n /         \        \n1 like = 1 year in his life\nLet's see how old he can get!
i dont believe in super teams...lebron is so whack
Rappers could learn a lot from athletes about friendships.
Peanut butter is consistent, it don't miss games, - Dwade 2017
Wait a minute... did he low key call D Wade “dry”...😂😂
i let too many guilty parties wager losing bets and now theyre upset i didnt do enough to warn them
Look at Lebron's thigh it's so developed
Two smelly **fucking NIGGERS.**  Who cares about the NBA....and all their **niggers.**
put your leg down boy, cant call ya a man for sitting like that. where did all the classy men go.
In sync best friend shit right there \n\n3:48 and 5:10
She looks like she wants some
Wade is Lebron's little bitch for life
These two are definitely fucking. Wade is a disloyal bitch for going to Cleveland. Miami should burn his Jersey.
Aww they look so happy together, is gay marriage legal in Ohio? 🤔
Dwyane Wade? Fuck that.\n\nThere's only room for one black guy called Dwyane in my life - Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson.
Guess what? I found a site that's giving Boost Mobile reboost codes away for free!  http://ow.ly/KsKF30dCmoK
If you live long enough folks make sure you have a dwade to your LeBron James.
Lebron is a bitch and Wade is a bitch too. Fuck Lebron...suck some shit you bitches! Sounds like she is interviewing a gay couple.
I don’t know about y’all, but jelly on toast w/o the peanut butter is delicious. You can DEFINITELY have a jelly-only sandwich, D.Wade. Also, LeBron, if your peanut butter is dry, you’re not doing it right LOL. Great interview, Rachel!
Battle of the Hairlines
Both these kids have no idea what they are talking about politically...
Does LeBron really have Pandora with ads? Lmao
Better chemistry than Kobe and Shaq.

Right after last NBA season I saw Dwyane Wade with Gabrielle at a restaurant in Miami, and as he was leaving I asked for a photo and he said no... Good dude
LeBron you know she's a whore,  use your nigger magic.

Why is this #17 trending 😂
To be honest I would have spared him xD
See you when you get back, man. Hopefully see you before then. Take care of yourself
I think perhaps a part time job might be good for you? You seemed quite happy at the bookstore, and it gave you a place to go, be around and talk to new people. I personally think it's important to have one's life in chunks so you can appreciate how different all the places are. (Work, school, hobbies, relaxation, exercise, visiting family) Being in one place too long kinda makes you go crazy and overthink. But I find that being productive in lots of different areas helps keep you productive in the creative ones simply because your mind wants to just go to the next thing, and if it's a creative one, it just does it automatically. Maybe it's just me. But food for thought.
Overthinking. Don't let it ruin you
I love you Dan...we all do...don't forget that ❤️❤️❤️
We'll miss you, but you being happy with what you do is infinitely more important. I do really look forward to PMS and hope you'll be back soon, but I hope even more that you get to find what you want and take genuine time out for yourself!
Acknowledging a failure and realizing how something makes you feel is the only way to improve yourself. Even if a well articulated word wound pushed you there.
Hey mate look, I don't think that you're a failure. Gosh I teared up when I heard you day that because i used to think that I'm a failure. Because I keep beating myself up emotionally. I lost all my confidence and ended up being depressed. I know that's a bit dramatic lol and you probably won't end up depressed ahaha. But who cares if you don't upload everyday in October. It doesn't matter, you didn't fail anybody. Learn how to not give a fuck ahaha idk. You're an amazing content creator and i can't wait for you to upload your next video whether it's next week or 5 months later idfk. I'll wait patiently. hugs XX
You aren't a failure. It didn't work out and that's okay.\nEvery video you make can't be perfect. I mean listen, I'm super new to this so take what I say with a grain of salt but... I've been uploading a video every 2 weeks since the beginning of the year and I love making things but sometimes it's a struggle to think of what you want to say. I don't even know if I could do something like VEDA. When I'm stumped creatively I consume other peoples content. Watch some YouTube videos, watch some new films, read a good book, listen to some podcasts and have a think and I'm sure all those creative juices will get flowing. (ew juices)\n\nI cannot wait to see what you make when you're back. :) Don't sweat it, you got this.
I've had an argument (sort of) with my mum the other day, that basically consisted of me being angry that I was never good at physics or chemistry, because I could've been a doctor and do something that mattered, and instead all the things I'm good at are creative things, and all of those things mean I'll likely have to work my ass of for my whole life to be able to put food on the table and forget about retirement.\nAnd my mum looked at me and said But art does matter. Especially today. You might think that we need more doctors and scientists, and that's true, but in times of social crises there need to be people who look at society and comment on it in a way that speaks to people. We need artists.\n\nIt was the first time I ever heard her say anything like that to me, in hopes I go and make art. And so I pass it on.\nArt is a process. It's an exploration, it's a commentary on the world, on reality. You can never keep doing the same thing over and over again. With each thing you do, you should explore something, learn new things and principles and by the time the artwork is done, you've grown. (Which is I believe why good artists are never fully satisfied with their work, cause by the time they've finished, they've overgrown it.)\n\nIf you consider yourself a creative person, there's no failing, not really - the process is art, because the process is learning and exploration. You only have the tough job of putting you process out for everyone to see, while others can keep their process to themselves and put out the finished product.\n\nxxx
God I really wish I had the time to do what you're doing. I'm in my last semester at uni and I've not been doing as well and I would love the time to think about what I'm doing and who I am and come back. I'm glad you're able to do it though and I'm interested to see what comes from it!
This is actually inspiring,  no I mean this has inspired me to legitimately make something....thanks Dan!!!
You'll be back and we'll be here, no pressure!
You might wanna try uploading something unique and spontaneous. It’s up to you what you do
I completely agree with the comments that VEDO isn't a failure because its caused you to look introspectively which is a crucial for personal growth BUT also wanted to point out that the period right before growth is SO uncomfortable and shitty. But it is worth it. \nI like to think of the uncomfortable stage like a caterpillar changing into a butterfly - like that has to be uncomfortable and confusing as f**k for the caterpillar! But works out so beautifully in the end
Wishing you the best of luck x
But like...whateveeeeer, the world's not gonna end. That was not a fail. That is not a failure.
a lot of wisdom, a lot of strength, fuck vedo you do what feels right (can't wait for the next pms :)
Well Dan, I can respect the reasons why you'll be taking time off, and I plan to watch again when you post videos. If I can offer a comment to tuck in your pocket before you go, it would be to tell you the reasons I watched your videos in the first place.\n\n1) Like your accent, true fact. But you're charming too.  \n2) Enjoyed your interactions with your friends. It reminded me of being young and having more social times, getting out and embracing live and having little adventures and fun times, full of laughter. Loved that day you and Louise went to the antique fair and purchased loads of cheese. (Totally something I'd  consider a awesome day out. Why yes, practically ancient, I am.) \n3) Like your sly wit. \n4) Like Baking With Layton, lots. I tend to doubt things will turn out, but hey, I'm wrong quite a bit. : )\n5) You and Hazel, in a collaboration is a win every time, for me, at least. \n\nCheers, and here's to your health!
You should do vlog every even/ odd day (veedo/ veodo)... another time though x
We fail because we are human.  I enjoy your videos whenever you post them :)
Failures in life are horrible necessary things that set you on a path to learning. You should absolutely allow yourself the time and space to think about what happened, what you need and what to do next.\nIt's not the end of the world that VEDO stopped in the middle of the month, we'll all end up missing your face and voice, but what's the point of you're miserable?! I'm not that much of a sadist.
Love your hair. How do you ask for it at the hair dressers
On different circumstances this video helped me a lot to watch today. I had my first gcse dance exam and I blanked out through 2 counts of 8 and I just stood there debating what I should do before I ended up rushing back into it. I came out of the studio and hid in a corner and sobbed! I'd still got another dance to do a little while after and even though everyone was telling me how it wasn't noticeable and no one was ever going to know how badly I messed it up (because I was in a group and so it just looked like there was a focus on the duo ) it was still important to me that I had put so much time and effort into the work to have just blanked out and forgotten the whole section. I'm still angry and upset over it but that doesn't mean that I am a failure, it just means that I let nerves get the better of me. Hopefully it wasn't all that noticeable and I still get an acceptable grade out of it.
The word failure has become something big and terrifying today, but it honestly isn't. Failure is making a mistake. Failure doesn't mean that you always make that mistake or will again, and failure doesn't define a person. Even if you fail, you can accept that you did what you did and learn from it. Failure means you're learning and growing. Next time you want to do another video every day of a month, think why you want to do it. I hope you take care of yourself first before your channel. <3
Practice some self compassion! And remember that your whole worth is not entirely dependent on external factors - I.e. you do not become unworthy because you haven't succeeded. You are still you, and people love you for that! Replace your self critical thoughts with thoughts of things that Hazel would say, and be a friend to yourself ♥️
You're my fave vlogger bc no one but the vlogbrothers are as engaging, articulate, and intelligent. And that comes pretty naturally to you, so keep being you. :)
Ill miss you Dan! I really do love everything you do even if you just ramble to the camera because its like having a conversation. Im glad you are taking time to make yourself happier with what you do. Just know that we will be here when you get back ^^ we love you Dan!
you didn't fail, you just realised it's not for you and that's okay !! im looking forward to future videos x
Listen Dan , i’ll be serious for a bit\nYou are not failing in any way or term \nCuz if you didn’t realize, you care about quality over quantity, which mean you care about how you are presenting yourself to your audience, which mean you take your youtube job seriously, so that probably mean you’re a successful person , maybe you’re not a big youtuber , but that doesn’t mean you’re not successful !\nALLLLSSSSOOOOOO\nI watch your videos because of your voice , I don’t really know why \nSo even if you uploaded a video that was “rubbish” believe me I will still watch it , as long as you’re talking in it\nSo you can make sure that i’m always giving you views -unless i die or smth lol-
You'll figure it out.  Everyone does things differently and you just need to find what works for you, and makes you happy and fulfilled.  You haven't failed - you've just found something that doesn't work for you - and that's progress :-) xx
I really like what we see of you and I want to like your content but it always feels like there’s something missing for me. I hope this is the start of some refreshing videos from you when you return
I'm sad we won't see as much of you but I'm so excited about the outcome!
Maybe try abomped... a bit of my project every day... then post it on the last day?
and we'll be waiting for you❤️
I love how all the comments are just complete & utter support, we love ya & want you to be happy with what you're doing. You haven't failed, you've tried something again & realised that it doesn't work, you've grown. Being creative in any sense is so much harder than people realise, for every new story or poem I write there's about 10s of ideas that haven't worked out for me. But then when you land on the right idea, enjoy making it (such a big part of the process) and end up with something wonderful  - it's worth it all. If you hadn't started & stopped VEDO you wouldn't have realised that this is how you need to create right now :) sending all the positive vibes your way x
You're a creative genius, everyone who is anyone believes that your skill and talent to create and entertain is something so special. I'm glad you're listening to your head and it's not a failure to discontinue this, it's a decision. And we respect your decision. We love and believe in you ❤️
That idea of what failure is was really nicely put in a song called Rich by Marillion,

oPWiR4jrqpI,\n

oPWiR4jrqpI,\nFailure isn't about falling down, failure is staying down.

oPWiR4jrqpI,\n

oPWiR4jrqpI,\nLooking forward to seeing you getting back to making content that YOU think is worth uploading.
I know I’m joining the wonderful hoard of people in these comments, but I just wanted to say they you haven’t failed. Yes, you didn’t upload everyday but if you had it would have likely been all filler... while I love your videos and will watch them regardless because I like the way you think and speak, they are always more entertaining when you enjoying the process of creating them. You can’t force creativity and that’s ok ❤️
daniel i enjoy your videos. not only because they make me smile and make that weird snorting sound i make called a laugh but because you are so lovely and kind and i just want to hug you and make you some comfort food when you’re sad because somehow whenever i fall into a deep depression you always post a cooking video and i wish we could be friends so i could maybe cheer you up but for now a simple thankyou, a like on every video and recommending your channel to everyone is what i hope is enough
Before I continue on with this video, your 'bit white' is my normal skin tone <3
Yeah go ahead and kill off some dragons and level up, and then come back and show us what you got.
I’m a teacher to 11 year olds and I tell them daily, failing is proof you’re trying. Failing is growing. \n\nYou’ve not failed, you’ve grown
You haven't failed, if anything this lapse in creative inspiration will lead you down a path you never would have walked down if you hadn't admitted to yourself that what you were doing wasn't making you happy. We'll all be here eagerly awaiting the next chapter of your YouTube adventure and if you decide that making YouTube videos isn't for you and you find another outlet for your creativity then I for one will be right there behind you. Never give up. <3
i still love you daniel xx
It sounds like this revelation is gonna take you on a new path and that's. Exciting. You are giving yourself a new freedom to create some amazing things dan and even if you make a few supposedly crap ones along the way, that's fine. I don't even think anything you've made this month was crap, everyone loves simply listening to you talk. We are all ready for whenever you next release a video and we all support whatever decisions you make, including this one. Don't be too hard on yourself bubs❤️
I think as a society we put so much worry into not failing, but failing is how we learn. We fuck up and we go, oh, alright i didn't like how that felt, im going to make sure next time i try harder or differently to get a better or different result. \nFrom what you said in this video, it sounds like you've learnt from your mistakes. So when you're ready, dust yourself off and get back on the metaphorical horse as long as you decide that metaphorical horse riding is for you.
I am so curious as to what the comment that sparked this was
love you dan <33 looking forward to the new content when you're feeling better. have a good break <3
You haven’t failed. I promise, you’ve just evolved
Hmmm I think you're confusing trying with failing - the reason I keep coming back to your channel is because I can see my own desires to be a certain person and produce certain types of work reflected in your ambition and intent and desire. You're giving everything a go and trying to work out which is the best fit for your channel. If your most recent attempt of VEDO didn't fit in with your idea of your channel, that doesn't detract from your identity and impact (tbh, just look at your followers - more and more I'm reading comments in your voice because their turn of phrase has absorbed your mannerisms). Deciding to stop and make deliberate choices, videos and express considered thoughts, ideas, content, is what is really admirable (and more needed on youtube/creative platforms, imo). If you didn't feel like VEDO worked, then that's just crossing an idea off your list, but it doesn't mean the end of the list. And your personality is such a likeable and kind (and witty) one, it permeates whatever you create anyway. That's why so many people are commenting what? You didn't fail? I loved your VEDO videos! Hope you gain some insight on your break :)
Don't look at it as failing. I started the year with a plan for a project to make a video celebrating a holiday/festivity every day of the year. I got to June but felt less and less happy with it as I went. So changed what my goals were. I took August off completely from it and am now I've restarted but if I miss a day... Well I miss a day. I've failed by my original scale sure so I changed the scale.
This is what happens to every YouTuber ever, this isn't new right? I mean everyone tries for an upload schedule and they realize it's gonna be hard work cos it then becomes a job
See if you resonate with this one: your Youtube channel is great, you're great.
Lol I don’t really get it because I liked all the vedo videos ._. Is it just me? Anyway you don’t need to do things you don’t want to!
I have no idea what VEDO is, and I've never seen any of your videos before, other than this one. After watching this I would suggest doing something you enjoy, and stick with it, develop it. No business succeeds without a plan (and I'm assuming since you said you do this full time, that this is a business). If you don't have a plan, just don't do it....... there's only so many times you can wing it. Good luck!
We will all miss you greatly. Please don't be so hard with yourself. Coming from someone who is extremely unforgiving of themselves. You never failed at making me happy. I loved to hear your options on matters across the world. Take care. You'll do incredible things. 🖤
dont feel bad. everyone here loves you.
I am so so happy you made this video. Ive always loved your channel, and I come to it for comedy and reality and funny stories and true human moments between you and the people you love, and I completely agree that you haven't seemed like yourself. Personally I think you should go and travel for a bit. Two weeks in Italy or something, reset your brain and change your surroundings and come back fresh and inspired. I can't wait till your passion flows through again. Love always x ❤️
dude, fail away. it's fine. it's also not entirely true. come back.
Personally I watch your videos for you and your personality. I love your perspective and opinions, even if we don't necessarily agree. I just find you so very engaging and charismatic that I would literally watch you do anything; you could be painting a wall or building furniture and I'd find the conversation funny and captivating. \n\nJust don't stop being you.
Daily videos seem very unrealistic anyway, honestly don't beat yourself up about it! You do you!
I believe in you, because I've been watching your vids for years and have seen so much good come from them, so I know lurking somewhere are some pretty damn cool, creative ideas. I'm looking forward to seeing them whenever that may be. Good luck! Breaks are super important, especially for creative tasks.
LOL u sux (kidding). There's nothing more demotivating as a creative person than when you hit a wall head on like one of those crash dummies. Glad to see you're aware enough to say, Yeah this isn't working for me. I'll regroup, then hit the ground running, rather than stressing yourself out trying to hit a deadline. \nNote: Amount of times I said, hit in this one comment = 4
You have not failed.  You learned, you grew, and gained experience to carry with you into further creative endeavors.  You're doing just fine!  Take what time you need; we'll be here when you're ready to come back.  <3
failure is one step closer to growing. i'm glad your taking time for yourself, that's important :)
One thing that's helped me a lot as an artist has been to realize that nothing is really failure if you learn from it. It's the opportunity to look back and learn, and move forward. All is forward motion and growth. To be honest, generally my biggest failures have been being overly worried about making something great and not being there fast enough. But it's okay if you're not there yet. Set out to learn and every step from there can be some kind of a victory.\n\nAlso, I really loved your vlog about getting excited about being a creator while doing set lists with Dodie. You sounded so happy.
Whether you manage to make a video every day for a month or not, I enjoy the content you put out and I appreciate the fact that  you care about its quality!
Fair enough, no stress 😊 Take your time, we’ll still be here when you’re ready ❤️
I completely accept this and I hope that you find what you're looking for.  That being said, I already miss your videos.  Thank god I can watch your old ones <3  \nAnd you're not a failure, Dan.  You're a person who wasn't happy with your work.  There's nothing wrong with striving for something you can be proud of.
You didn’t fail, you just figured out that vlogging everyday isn’t what you want to do. Personally you’ve been one of my favorite youtubers for a long time and all of your videos ( even the ones about game of thrones which I know nothing about) have all been amazing and interesting. Even if vlogging everyday isn’t for you that’s alright and I’ll still continue to look forward to you’re uploads no matter how long they take. You shouldn’t try to please everyone, all that matters is that you’re pleasing yourself with the content you are uploading. :)
Time is a great healer. Take it and cherish it. I’m sure you’ll find your voice and comfort somewhere in between. I have been watching your videos for a while now and have always admired how articulate you are when it comes to relaying how you feel. What you do is brilliant because its genuine. Don’t beat yourself up my friend. I look forward to your future videos and wish you all the best...
with inktober going around I saw a great piece of advice. \ndaily challenges are supposed to help you feel good about yourself. at the end you want to feel satisfied that you did something challenging, not exhausted because you did something overwhelming. with inktober the advice is to reduce scale. instead of doing a whole full page illustration, instead make a one inch by one inch square and do that every day. \nI don't know what the equivalent of a one inch square is in video production, but it's an idea worth experimenting with. \n\nalso you're not a failure, and I super enjoyed the chilled out rambley vlogs about not much, and I hope you find what you need to maintain your happiness, and I would offer to fight anybody who says you're failing. I wouldn't actually fight them because IRL I'm bundle of fear of confrontation and misplaced anger in a wheelchair, but I'd offer it.
If I may, your initial attempt and intention to create in and of itself is an act of courage. You did not fail, I think, because I believe that the crux of a video everyday project such as vedo is the form that a desire to create may or may not take. I think that your intention, perhaps calculated, is more valuable than the result you achieved. And I think it should be framed as an achievement because you did create. You did tell stories. You did produce pieces of work that captured portions of your life and that is a meaningful truth regardless of their quantity. I like you because you are Daniel J. Layton. I'm thankful that you create. I will be here when you are happy to come back to this space.
Dear Daniel J Layton,\nLast night I had a dream about you. In the dream I was going to a play and you and your friends were there also. I was initially so excited to see Hazel and Jack and Dodie because I have been watching them for a long time. By the end of the play, I set out to find them. I found them behind the the building and said hi. Then I was looking amongst the group and I couldn't find you. Eventually I found you standing in the back, alone because you thought no one wanted to see you. But, I wanted to. I said hello to you and you hugged me and we had a lovely chat like we were old friends that just hadn't seen each other in a while. I know it was just a dream but that's how I feel when I watch your videos. I feel like they are the warm embrace of a good friend. I liked you VEDO so don't say no one wanted to watch it because I did. You can do this, my friend. I believe in you and what you can do.
The reason I love your videos is because there're always so honest and you're so honest and honestly you're just a fantastic human being and I love every second of watching you! So just keep making videos like this if you feel like it, share your feelings, then we shall share our love <3
If you're not having fun, we're not having fun. One of the best lessons any type of creator can learn.
Like a shitty sequel, it's rare you can recreate that magic - maybe try something new :))
‘Failure’ isn’t necessarily a bad thing to do. The meaning of failure is ambiguous, and can sometimes be the best thing that can happen to someone. Don’t shy away from failure, how will you ever have the motivation to achieve if you’ve never failed? Even if you feel you’ve failed, awesome! Look at all the constructive criticisms you can give yourself right now! Think of what amazing things can happen out of failure! GO CREATE WITH ABANDON AND TRIP UP ALONG THE WAY!!!! xxxx
Taking some time to figure things out is a really beneficial thing. I hope you find a conclusion that gives you peace in what you're doing.
Kick some arse while you're gone! Your own I guess? Stay safe and healthy x
I'm the absolute worse at ordering food at a restaurant. Too many options. I always have to start with what I definitely don't want. You're pairing down your channel's menu and figuring out what kind of space this is. Chronically where you're out, who you are, and trying to grow from that. Learning what you funny want. With so much learning happening, how can it be failure?
I actually really liked your videos in october. They weren't the most thought out videos sure, but I enjoyed them. I think it's ok if you decided to stop with those, especially if you yourself didn't like them. And you're certainly not a failure. Hope you have a nice day!
There've been quite a few comments on whether or not people, including yourself believed that you have failed, but what I think is more important is the idea that we need to reframe failure as a concept to be used as a creative tool. There have been many people that have said that failure is a critical part of the creative process and because failure is seen as bad by society, creativity in many ways has died because instead of trying something new and learning from it, we tend to hide within ourselves and don't take on those risks. \n\nIn attempting VEDO, you did try something that many creative artists will do in that of recreating the original outcome because it not only worked, but it was enjoyable to do. This, however, is a concept that I know many authors will go through with their second novel. They try to recreate the formula that worked the first time because it is familiar and it worked. This does lead to issues with the content itself because no moment can directly emulate another, it is an impossible standard that we so strongly desire to be feasible. \n\nBut I also believe that if this is a failure, it is definitely one that can be learned from. From a creative stand point, failure needs to be an option to have truly great art. That, plus the fact that as you develop your abilities, the process is linear while your taste and knowledge of your ability might be well beyond that. It is through failure that we learn what we are capable of and what we want to see in ourselves. You just have very high standards, something I really enjoy about your content, and I'm glad you opened up a conversation about failure as it is something that desperately needs attention in the creative world. \n\n(Also, you should check out Sir Ken Robinson. He has a lot to say on the subject)
It’s good to take some time to think. \nI hope you come out better on the other side.
dan, we've heard this before. pull yourself out of it and just make something wild. stop thinking so much
You did better then me, I got to announcing I'll do vedo thinking it would help me sort things out and had no plans since it worked during vedim, yet also means that I had no ideas and just didn't upload because I didn't want to upload shitty content again after starting to improve
Take your time and I hope you find the answers you're looking for. xxx
It’s okay! I’m failing VEDO, too! I’ve been in a really messy headspace and I just can’t be bothered and I know how you feel. I started it thinking that it would give me some sort of structure, thus being beneficial for my mental health. But I’m proud of you for putting yourself and your work first. Making content that is worth being watched is a tricky thing to determine. You are not a failure. You’re figuring it out. That sounds like personal progress to me. 💖 all the love to you and your videos. I love every single one.
I can't believe you've been full-time on here for 6 months already! I wouldn't say you failed, Dan. Every challenge and video you post is a learning/growing experience. The VEDO videos were wonderful and we're all here for whatever you'll bring to the table :)
You make things that you feel happy with if you end up uploading a video a week, every two weeks whenever people will still love you and watch you. Your PMS videos are amazing and so is Baking with Layton. Basically all I want to say is if you feel that you failed or think that you failed because you didn't upload a video everyday that is okay everyone fails at things because even the Undertaker fails at things and look at him he is a fucking legend and in my horrible less than 20-20 eyes you are amazing and a god damned legend. <3<3

Q:A\nQ: Can I have a copy of this script?\nA: No. It is illegal (federal offense) to hack any private/public network.\n\nQ: RIP WPA2\nA: WPA2 is not dead. You will just need to patch your iPhone, Android, macbook, PC, or gaming console.\n\nQ: Nooooooooooooooooooo\nA: It's not the end of the world. See answer above.\n\nQ: I use WPA1 or WPA am I safe?\nA: You are even more at risk. No you're not safe\n\nQ: I only ever use iPhone and Macs. I don't need to worry.\nA: WRONG. You are still at risk. Please patch all Apple devices, along with your AP (router)\n\nQ: I thought Apple was immune to viruses?\nA: This isn't a virus, it's an exploit to steal/forge your WiFi data being sent/received\n\nQ: I use VPN. No need to worry\nA: That's funny, no really it is. You're not safe, but keep telling yourself that if it helps.\n\nQ: Please, I use Linux... No one is more safe than me.\nA: ... WRONG... If you believe that, then maybe Linux isn't the right OS for you.
Where can I get these files
This is the reason why I still use lte
NONCE. Fam that has a whole different meaning...
Excellent information. Thank you sir, you are a credit and programmers like me would be lost without you.
İllərdi bunu heç kim görmədi ? Nəsə burda qaranlıq məsələ var.....
How to install krackattack tool in kali linux
Thanks for the new! This vulnerability is very important/dangerous!
can older version leser than wpa_supplicant 2.4 be used?
thank you very much to discover such flaw in wifi security before evil hacker discovered i aware people about this flaw in wifi security
so , the attacker got internet access?
give us the script :D
A genius explaining what GOD'S can't explains.
finanly wpa2 fucked................yeah Google go on find it and patch........
Amazing and terrifying at the same time remembering how vastly used is WPA2. Absolutely magnificent work. Thank you.\nI have some questions in mind:\n1. Is this attack causing victim client switch from legit access point to a rogue one (e.g. your computer on demo video)?\n2. Make sure victim can access the internet << Does it mean attacker have to provide internet access from somewhere else if the attacker doesn't have the wifi password? Also does it mean this attack doesn't reveal the wifi password?\n3. Can the attacker join the actual network without password or it is just disguise itself as a access point without joining the actual network?
Thank you for making it clear....   I normally use a personal VPN i have setup at home.. will that add an added protection and protect from this type of attack ?
Ohh shit.... Why are you telling this to everyone? Idiot just remove this fu*king video
thank you master! time to hack my crush
Is it me or does it look like the attacker actually needs to know the MAC address of the device in order to carry out the attack. Therefore he would have to be on the same private network to do a MAC scan already?
Do we need to update our router firmware as well as devices?
back to the RJ45 xD
any one knows when will the code be released??
Create A Fake AP and talk with Client Device to achieve 4 way handshake, we have already done. what is new in it??? OR are you just want to get popularity over web with this ???

can you please provide these tools? I need to check my whole network in office and home.
العربي يضغط لايك😂
he says ...update all of your wifi devices. does this include wifi routers/access points or only the devices (clients) that connect to a network over wifi, e.g. smartphone, printer, roku, desktop, tv, yada yada??
That is very good research. Thanks for your effort to correct the loopholes in android and Linux.\nData would be still encrypted by SSL, if users carefully visit the websites by checking the HTTPS and Certificates(certificate issuer must be trusted CA). If website request received without SSL(HTTPS) then do not provide information.
Please provide your python script
amazing man! can you improve that method?
If I understand this correctly, you are connecting the victim to the rogue WiFi network, so you don't break the WPA2 encryption in real. You just forced the victiom phone to connect to the rogue WiFi without the victim knowing and then intercepting the packets as MItM attack. OR?
This was fixed on android 6+ with the august security patch - at least in my testing
Which linux distribution you using plz tell
we fucked up to the mother :v
Does anyone know what distro of Linux this is? #cheers
wanna krack? wkwkwland :v
Whats version Linux in video ? Please!
I don't have WiFi anymore, got an unlimited 4G data plan
Nice. Now they need to release their exploit or someone else will do it.
i think its fine
So what im i suppose to update and where?
I lost it when this guy knows soooo much about computer security but still uses Simple Screen Recorder LMAOO
its cool and at the same time scary for me who uses a custom rom
OLD NEWS. Get with the times
By 'updating your devices' what does the author mean? What specifically I should update on my Android phone and Laptop?
Apple are patching it in a FEW WEEKS.... R.I.P. Wifi
You've discovered the NSA's backdoor.
Glad this is on trending.
All your Wifi base are belong to us !
so that means hacker could check all my porn data files????

Wow the most meaningless comments get the highest upvotes here (like noo and shit etc)\nJheez
No offence but this has been easy to do since 2004 why is this on trending now? Either me and my cronies are far far ahead of this current generation or your video is an already well known thing.
You know these kind of people piss me off.   Last week this wasnt a issue now they published this method and every ffing criminal in the world knows how to do this.   In my opinion publishing this crap to the wide public should be punishable as they now basicly gave access to billions of devices arround the world of wich 80% wont ever see a fix.  So despite their possible intentions they made  billions of devices voulnarable and gave access to many more billions of accounts.  So despite claiming to have good intentions they screwed everyone. Ofc fixing is good but the idiots didnt think this trough when publishing this.
Are we all fu**ed right now? Gotta go update everything brb
i know that for a long time. fuck you for share that information
But if the patch is not out for your device or platform then using a vpn can help: https://www.purevpn.com/blog/how-to-overcome-krack-wifi-vulnerability/
for all the people saying wpa2 is dead. ALL the kracks attacks on linux can be patched right now. so the only victim left are android devices and i think they will be patched soon. so wpa2 is not dead yet.
someone did it to me
Which linux distro or desktop environment he is using. It doesn't seems like Kali or may be Kali with another Desktop environment?

I guess I was expecting something like Die, Klingon f__er! or Isolate that core breach or the f___ing ship is gonna blow! Instead, we get this. HISTORIC.
Garbage.  Shaka, when the walls fell.
Thank goodness my favorite swear word survives until at least the 23rd century.
nope this is not fucking cool
I can't believe we're in a universe where I can say Seth MacFarlane could write a better Star Trek with a straight face.
That was the most unnecessary “fucking” line ever.
Un-fucking-believable, is what it is... That somebody actually approved this scene to be written, let alone filmed and aired.
The reaction some people are having to this is completely ridiculous. \n\nSaying fuck in this scene worked fine in the context in which it was used. \n\nThis is a young cadet on her first ship assignment getting very excited about a scientific discovery, and having a slip of the tongue. She’s human, it happens.\n\nIt’s blatantly clear she knew she screwed up, and expected to get reprimanded for it. \n\nIf someone had said fuck as an insult, or to degrade someone, or something negative like that I could understand. But that isn’t how it was used. \n\nPeople have used profanity in Trek before, this is nothing new. \n\nNot to mention there’s been worse shown and done in other series than someone using the word fuck.
That's a first!,  Fucking Cool.
It just wasn't needed. It was only forced in to make the BORING conversation sound more exciting. I perfect example of lazy writing.
I'm a big fan of Cadet Tilly.
Gene's rolling in his grave
sad really really sad that this show continues to show the worst in human race instead of the best like it was originally intended, and it used to be a show that was family friendly,  not anymore I guess really sad
It feels like this was for pure shock value, it had no context that justified it and it added nothing to the scene or dialogue. Sadly, I think it was done on the basis that the internet would be talking about it, as indeed we are!
It's Star Trek, ....not Breaking Bad.\n Resorting to totally unnecessary shock and awe F-bombs is a sign of a limited intellect, lazy writing, and wreaks of an obvious attention grabbing ploy for ratings.
Hebbywood garbage.
Think of all the parents having to explain what fucking cool means to their kids....
A: Hey, let's explain our illogic idea of a spore drive and a blablatard with some techno-babble to the audience! \n\nB: But what if they got bored ...?!\n\nA: Hmmm ... Wait, I have an idea! Tell the goddamned audience that our idiotic idea is *fucking* cool! \n\nB: OK, the fucking will do the trick! Problem solved!
THIS IS SO FUCKING COOL! - Lt. Sylvia Tilly (actress Mary Wiseman) - Well, it's canon now. About time! :D
Obligatory (?) 1990s-throwback nerd chick whose acting is worse than a Troma starlet's awkwardly says the F word. Worse, she says cool!! Stamets, the all-business Gay fungus expert, then reassuringly repeats the embarrassed cadet's long-dead phrase back to her. Stamets looks like an android. He could be this show's Data. He makes Maskatron look like Howdy Doody. But he tells his bubbly chum she's right...his discovery (if you will) is f-cking cool. Oh, snap! La Forge doesn't even know what taking a leak means just over a century later. This is SO f-cking *not* Star Trek. It's Galactica reboot part two. The Trek Kelvin movies had the excuse of going for mass appeal with their action and comedy. They can easily be ignored. Discovery the series is a bell that can't be unrung, and the sound it's making is a death knell for the greatest science fiction franchise in TV or movie history.
When the producers and writers of a Star Trek show think, an f-bomb is a sign of maturity of a show, while in fact it is a de-evolution, you know you have a bunch of idiots, who are all way over their head, running a show.\n\nBTW: The exposition dialogue in this scene is so blatant, it hurts. They could have shown text cards inserted into the scene instead with the same dramatic effect. The writing of this show is even below fan film productions. Is this the Hollywood standard now?
Wooooooooooooooooooooooo! Final frontier! Hipster trendy! Cutting edge! It's what is HOT in Hollywood.\n\nThe F word on an Abrams inspired abortion of Trek.\n\nHollywood is a dead corpse run by perverts.
If Gene Roddenberry were alive to see this, he'd be turning in his grave.
Hey, let's drop the first f-bomb in Star Trek.\nSure, what context were you thinking for that? Some epic speech? A real tense, dramatic moment?\nI dunno... throw it randomly into some technobabble.
I hate STD and where Star Trek has fallen to since Enterprise ended. It used to be a great human drama that you could sit down and watch with the family. You could discuss episodes and have fun watching some occasional action without being exposed to garbage. Now it’s just more “pew pew” sci fi with sex, gory violence, and swearing. On top of that, they screwed up the Klingons, ship design, and the overall canon. \n\nI never thought I’d wish for a Star Trek show to fail but I sincerely hope STD gets cancelled soon.
Ahead warp 5, lets' get out of this crazy universe, and find where the real Star Trek went!
How is this lazy writing, people?\n\nDo you know how unrealistic television shows and movies are when they have to abide by television and ratings. Do  you know how many shows have to subvert their language when in reality they'd most likely be saying Fuck a lot of the time. Kid-Friendly or rather Viewer-Friendly doesn't make something realistic. \n\nIf you've never heard someone say Fuck or any derivative of that word, you're living in some kind of fantasy world separate from reality. I was in high school I've heard students cussing out teachers for crying out loud. \n\nNot creative?......maybe but only if something like Frak from Battlestar Galactica or a replacement word is actually creative, or removing realism from television shows to abide by standards. There are so many shows where I have to roll my eyes sometimes, because its obvious the character WOULD swear but can't because....TV. It kind of gets ridiculous.\n\nI don't even want to get into argument about the ethics or morality of cussing so that's just my thoughts on it.
You know what's fucking cool? Every star trek series but this one...
Oh man they said fuck! There are so edgy................You want a truly Star Trek ish show watch Orville
Bahahahah!!!! Unnecessary and yet Hillarious, I didn't watch this show but I will now
It was awkward usage to be honest 😅
The real new Star Trek\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCBuaTnDsQs&t=303s
who the F passed this scene..swearing...guy scenes...what next alien orgies...mmmmm....Not wat it used to be...
I like Lt. Sylvia Tilly but the fucking  line what was that Also the other starfleet guy in the cell with lorca said SHIT so two swear words were used
Finally the f bomb boldly going where no f bomb has gone before! Fucking engage maximum warp!
Picard: Shut the FUCK up wesley!!....just wouldn't have the same dismisive bluntness as shut up wesley more aggressive no fuck's in star trek please or star wars hey obi-wan, yeah you, go fuck your mudda
Is that Daryl from Adventures in Babysitting?
Oh shit everyone is this comment section is an expert on filmmaking and script writing!!
this isn't Shakespeare ffs, get over it
AirWolf. The show about an attack helicopter's pilot episode got an 18 sticker for dropping an F bomb. Will enjoy seeing what rating that episode get's when released on DVD for double F bomb.
This series has no honor.
Well at least they didn't use the F-bomb to insult someone that might have been not appropriate
STD is fake star trek
Tilly is the best!! I love her!
This show keeps trying to not be Star Trek.
It's the end of the world as we know it.......
This is Star Trek but it does NOT feel like Star Trek because it is NOT worthy of the Star Trek lable.
Pathetic, sad and completely unnecessary but hardly surprising since the MPAA allowed PG-13 films to contain the F-bomb as long as it's not used in a sexual context. It's become a trend, for example every X-Men film has contained it since First Class. As for Star Trek, Chris Pine as Kirk already used minor profanities in the ST reboot films so watch out for an F-bomb in the next one.
This mum-bo jom-bo tec speak makes no sense not to mention the horror of what's it's doing to establish cannon. Can't understand all the hate the cast receive for their acting on this show. For the most part their fine, just a little to much Michael what's her face... that and rewriting most trek lore. Well this could be a mirror galaxy or some random bullshit...who knows.
Came here just to see the downvote reaction.
So I stream it through the CBS app, is this what they're showing on regular TV? Like they're dropping that on regular TV time? 😑
Look at the clip. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ljjkO5rZNcI
Battlestar Galactica did it better.
Lazy writing
Oh calm down.  The science in Star Trek has always been babble - just a pretext to explore social, political & philosophical questions.  The function of this f-bomb is just to illustrate a joyful, unabashedly nerdy enthusiasm for science & invention (even if the science & invention themselves are just filler).  It's adorable, and I think most people who've worked in a lab, etc., would agree that it rings true.
Lmfao that was a surprise when we heard this!
*The F-bombs are at **1:31** ...*
omg yo she said fuck
this show is a disgrace to the franchise  ! it just shows how bad the writing is that they have to curse ..
R.I.P. Star Trek
Badly written. Yet another wasted moment. THIS CRAP is NOT Star Trek.
Sorry this is terrible acting. And who are they talking to? Each other? Are they teaching an invisible class of science students? 
This is not the first time this has happened, profanity has been used in the franchise look 👀 I can’t agree with any of that, the insults by Doctor McCoy in the original show aka Green blooded, devil, unfeeling computer! “ 🔥 Come on! 🔥I’m a fan and always will be. So having said that I’m going to defer to Mr. Spock 🖖 And y’all can tell me that this kind of thing has never happened before, sorry it has. Profanity has been used before in Star Trek, look 👀 sorry 😊https://youtu.be/ljjkO5rZNcI
Oh my FUCKING GOD! The amount of bitching about this show has become FUCKING ridiculous!
Well, that was... awkward?
More like....Fucking Lame!!
The whole series is plagiarism. They stole pretty much everything from an indie sci-fi game. Details here. http://anas-tronaut.blogspot.no/2017/10/star-trek-discovery-tardigrades.html
It's not just the swear word, although that was excruciating, it's also how boring the conversation was. I can't remember any of it and I only watched it 7 seconds ago. The actors come across like they are reading lines and not speaking naturally. Horrible.
I feel sorry for Gene Roddenberry.
horizontal gene transfer, vertical gene transfer, diagonal gene transfer, its the science of the future guys. pew pew
This show had a very slow start.  The characters did not interact well with each other.  Well I guess that shows the times we are in.  TNG in the 90's, everybody working together they knew each other well.  STD is all about lost values, making impulsive decisions, the all about me arrogance.  So now we got cursing on Star Trek because the storyline is weak.  Whats next?  Get the recording device as you watch and capture your partner bleeding out after a Klingon attack!  I can see them now sharing those gruesome holographic images.  The new Iphones of Star Trek.
Man, I've watched star trek for years. Each series is a little different, and this one is a little more modern and edgy. People getting torqued into bloody messes, and people saying fuck... hell yeah, boldly go where Star Trek has never gone before, and gimme more!\n\nI, for one, am enjoying Star Trek Discovery.\n\nPlease note, that I am also thoroughly enjoying The Orville as well. It is more Trek-like in a conventional sense, and doesn't overdo it with the comedy like I was expecting.
So, in other words, they renamed Andromeda's (another Roddenberry concept) Slipstream and it's need for an organic pilot.
It's fitting I think a lot of Star Trek Fans said Fuck when seeing this abomination calling itself Trek. Star Trek's first STD in all its glory.
Ugliest, most unprofessional and inept crew in Trek history.
As a long time Star Trek fan, I can't believe that CBS is actually airing this garbage...even if it is only online.
Nice try, but I'm still not watching this SJW propaganda.
What's next, full frontal nudity orgy scenes complete with throbbing erections on the holodeck? They did it with Westworld already, so it'll probably happen here.  Star Trek is going to lose a lot of fans over this.
Nerds have a problem with change.
Yeah...is that supposed to impress? Because it doesn't. Come back when you know how to write an interesting scene without relying on swearing.
What the fuck??
Well and its time this show fucking has a warp core breach and blows up and goes off the air permanently!\n\nGene Roddenberry is rolling around in his grave. \nRIP STAR TREK
It kinda pushed the show into self-parody territory. Like it's trying to 1-up Orville.
And this is something I would have to pay extra for?  No thank you.
As if Big Red the feminist tragic,...the cross-eyed gay moron and the Bull Dyke Vulcan without logic\nwould be accepted in Starfleet,....pfft.
Keep bitchin on star trek sheeple and we will have to wait another 12 years for the next show, god forbid the formula gets changed up slightly or they try anything different!
'muricans being stuck up, as usual. Reading the comments here is ridiculous to me, living in Europe.
In Star Trek, pregnant women wouldn't have to go through labor to give birth.  The baby could just be beamed out.
The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth, whether it's scientific truth or historical truth or personal truth! It is the guiding principle on which Starfleet is based. And if you can't find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened, you don't deserve to wear that fucking uniform!
One of the plus sides of going on to a streaming service vs. regular TV: no censors.
When one simply has a warp core breach they simply say. FUCK!\n\nOh please canned this FUCKING star trek jar jar abrams fucking abomination now!!!!!!!! \n\nGene Roddenberry rolling around in his grave.\nRIP STAR TREK
How did you all feel when Data said Oh Shit when the Enterprise D went down?
This video made me forget about all my problems.

Oh how beautiful! Much love to you and your son! Thank you for sharing
Probably more afraid and baffled, where do all the sounds come from mum can talk 😊 It must be like entering a brand new world, from totally silence to all kind of different sounds and noices. Everything is already new for a baby and then it changes some more.
On nr 2 in Norway
I got month ago too brother, what the hell is going on?
Your voice is so wierd please stop
Seeing him cry made me want to cry❤️
Who the f would dislike this video
One of the most beautiful movies I have seen  if not the most beautiful.
This is a beautiful human being you're holding in your arms... Make him happy as much as you can every single day 'cause God has granted to you the greatest love of all with a gift & privilege.
This is amazing and touching. God bless you and your child.
I'm usually more of a dog person than a baby person...but this is beyond precious ❤
I am almost certain I have seen this before
God bless this baby! This is so beautiful...
Nothing like the warm touch from a mothers voice!
How... is he controlling his emotions so well...?! he's like just out of the oven?!
Awss that so sad and same time so cute
You should add ad's on the video now before it blows up.
Now play some metal
i love u too cutie pie, we all love u... on the festival of diwali... i wish for ur best future nd lots of happiness in ur life.... i knw for sure that u wil b alright becuz all of us prays for ur health nd better life.
I wonder what's going through that child's mind. We tend to apply emotions to situations like this that simply aren't applicable, but there definitely seems to be some conflicting emotions here between perhaps a tiny bit of fear and a sense of belonging or happiness with it.
Wow <3 Moved me to tears alright! Charly is the sweetest!
It's a precious baby!! So sweet is!💗
How can someone dislike this? This is amazing! :D
she's beautiful! so sweet!!!
I'm not crying, you're crying! This is so sweet!!!

Pretty sure the damn baby is just scared. What's wrong with people?
It's only a baby 😓😂😓
Anyone who doesn't get a tear. has no heart.
I didn't cry what do I get
Lol
I think it's just taking a shit
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING!!! That is one of the cutest fucking babies I have ever seen in my entire life.
I find it sad that a video that is showing a hearing impaired baby getting a hearing aid doesn't have English Subtitles. I would understand if the mother wasn't speaking English, but this is not the case. Also, being a hearing impaired person with two hearing aids, I can tell you the the baby's reaction might be due to the volume being too loud and/or not calibrated properly for the infant. I know that when I got my first hearing aid, it was so bad that I had to take it out until they adjusted it properly. It must be very difficult to do this for a baby. It's hard to determine it is at a comfortable volume.
this is so fucking cute 😍
Boring!
OMG OKG OMG OMG OMMGGGGGGGGGGGGG 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 CAN'T STOP WATCHING THE BABY'S REACTIOOOOOOONNNN
Dodo is 100 times better than that tiger production. Dodos video are PURE funny with absolutely no abuse
AHAHahaha I saw 3 dogs. Wrong... 4 and so excited buddy
This must be the greatest park ever!
There are too many Pointers in this video. So many, in fact, that I am out of breath just from watching it :^)
We have the same conversation in my car
Im sorry i died at the speed up😂
How is this amusing. It raises the excitement level of the pack and distracts the driver. If he crashed the car all of those dogs would be propelled forward through the windscreen. Would that be amusing and on YouTube!
I can't help but think of the cat lady syndrome..even though this is a man with many dogs.
love how the owner never stops smiling
yep that's my life. My dogs do the same thing and it doesn't matter how many times a week we go they still act like it's been years and it's just the most amazing thing in the world and to them it is which makes me so very happy.  But seriously ... The Barking in the car can be a bit much so I feel that guy's pain.
I've never seen so many dogs in one car. I can barely deal with one in my car.
nice video...\nbut some doggy seat belts would have been perfect
0:25 lmao
I mean. \nI guess going \nto the park is ok 😕
I wanna see what happened when they reach..... 😛😛
Two cute.......  4 dogs. That's impressive. Just make sure anymore dogs U get R rescue dogs coz they so much need homes.
Hahaha... they are just like little kids.  :)
MY GOD!!!!  4 German Shorthairs!!!   DUDE i don't know how you do it?  My hats off to you!
I know it's a lot of hassle but... It'd be much safer for your fur babies to all be in the back with harnesses.  If you got in an accident the one in the front could be injured by the airbags and the others could become projectiles.\n\nI can tell they are very loved and well cared for... Just wanted to share a safety tip. 💕
Now that's what I call one excited happy bunch of GSP's!!
I have a GSP sweet dog never barks only for seconds when we leave to go hunting only if I have a gun. Around house or yard never I think she's always hunting !
Is this what heaven looks like?
I fricken love this , but it's a little dangerous to have dogs lose in the car like that. Still cute as hell though
Some say they are still howling today
Plot twist he's taking them to the vet.
From their perspective,everythings are moving while they're at rest.....and it's sooo weird
Our dog does this on the way to the pool at my brothers house.
Dodo for the deaf. I like it.
what breed is that
I like how the last dog just pushed her way thru. Thought there were 3, and then, pop! There's a 4th.\n😄🐕🐶🐕🐶💕🌻🌴🍁🍂
If the driver-owner can handle all those dogs, he can handle anything.  One is enough for me.  Friend has two and that's okay too.
German Short Haired Pointers are the best breed bar none. These are a bit agitated but usually they are the most calm and collected dogs on the planet. I had one growing up and again as an adult I had one. Smart, sympathetic, playful, but they know when it is time to be laid back. Many fond memories. Hopefully when I am ready to get another dog it will be a GSP.
Why do you need all those dogs! Mental problems
they sound like little children being kidnapped
As cute as it is it always makes me a bit nervous seeing pets unsecured in vehicles.
Ahhh.. The lovely sound of dogs.
That got old real quick...
hopefully he's not a hunter...
You need a bigger car.
that's a rowdy bunch there!!!!
I always walked her off her leash.Besides I own a ranch and all the dogs out here are never leashed.I never had a problem with her. A dog is only as good as it owner..
Who doesn’t love to go to the park? It’s a fun place for everyone yay! 😅😅❤️
Hey! Get in the back.. hahahahaha
Hahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahh \n\nThis is funny. It's so cute though
Wonder what the furry kids do when dad tells them it's bath time. Lol
Where are we? Park? Omg omg omg omg omg omg!!! Omgomg omg omg omg omg omg omgo omg omg omg omg omgo mg omg omg! Omgo omg omg! Okay. Is everyone good now?
Beautiful dogs. The one that came from the backseat to the front, looks like he’s got a brown hood on. Too cute.. all of them!
Me in the future, I swear.
How cool is that?
Cute, but not too smart.  Not the state of mind for four large dogs entering a dog park.
XD SO FUNNY  WE NEED MORE
Oh my goodness! Those boys are EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
they're so cute!thanks man for letting them go out to the park😍
Awww I wanted to see them run around and play. 😍
Haha! So many excitements!
happy dog's!
😂😂😂😂😂
Haha best 👌
Just like Kids!
ahaha! How cute!?
Freedumb is everywhere

Beautiful dogs.
Awesome!

😂
Cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute!
Hahaha
Its a HOWLRide
Damn dogs😂😂😂
Sound like justin bieber fangirls
Doggy Disneyland!!😃
My ears have exploded
Life's simple pleasures ...
Just like little kids
sooo cute
Awww So Cute!!! 😄🐶😄🐶😄🐶😄🐶
No no no no not da vet!!!\n\n\nDun dun duuuuuuun
It reminded me when I used to bring my dog to the mountain... she couldn't wait until we got there... I miss her so much.
People always say this but....who would dislike this?? Like, the titles are never click bait, you're never subjected to aggressive pro animal rights mantras, only ever given show animals love, so people can't even complain that they're having opinions shoved down their throat....its just plain ol cute videos of cats & dogs....
How stupid is that not to have dogs safely secured in the car
The only issue I have with many of these videos, is lack of secure restraint of animals in moving vehicles. You wouldn't let your kids or other family members roam around a vehicle while it's in motion, why your animals? It's such a risk to their safety that should seriously be considered.
Why kind of dogs are these?
Awwww! You have a lovely tribe of liver dogs 😊💕💛❤️ I loved their musical howls hehehe
Lol....adorablesness😘
They ended up at the vet instead. Jk hehe😝
Translation: Dad not the park! We owe the Pitbull gang tons of toys! \n(The one who came to the front) Archie is coming towards our car! (Archie is gang leader)\nAll in unison FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUKFUFKFUKFUFKFUFFFFFFFFFFF
What breed is this
That was cruel, I think they thought they were going to the drive thru at McDonalds.
wow how do u control that much excitement in the park....i mean even one of these excited dog can pull away a man if they wantd..n u hav 3 of them...
Plot twist- Daddy took them to the vet instead....\nlol
‘horse... j-hope look in the mirror’\n\nJUNGKOOK YOU LIL SHIT
Taehyung warmed my heart at the end, he knew exactly what he wanted and was really excited about it. I admire his ambition. He's so cute 💗
Thats why i love tae, he is so unique & clever in a way that differrent from others, preach to say he is out of the box mind thinker & ppl that dont understand him call him weird like hell no. He’s into art, most of creative person have different style of thinking & express themself in their own artistic way
MaknaexMaknae we're coming for my baby Hobi xD they need to lay off xD lol when he thought of the heart shaped mouth! I felt so proud for him xD that's a good idea! \nLololol Yoongi had me GONE when all he could think about was cute xD what a guy xD same with Joon! They are masters of marketing strategically! Lol as expected of the genius' 💕
I can't breathe because of all this cuteness!
they are all so good at this!!!!!!!!!
THANK YOU FOR THE ENGLISH SUBS \n\nHALLELUJAH
taehyungs voice is so sweet n soft wow
Hahaha❤️ I love seeing them do this❤️ I do this type of stuff in my free time ❤️ I love to draw ❤️
I hope they show Suga and Jimin more in the next episode! I wanna see what they're doing too!
Hobi's character is so cute! but then it has a sad backstory ;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;
When you have the same face mask as Namjoon 😏😂 Also V's and Jhope's masks are adorable!! 😆
Jin has no chill in this video😂😂😂
Before video: *sighs* there’s no subs but still gonna watch it\n\nStarts vid: 😱omg there’s subs😭yesssss this rarely happens
I think Tae's idea is perfect)
V's idea is awesome! You could even add any existing character to his head LOL!
Is Taehyung wearing a...Gucci...tie...?\n\nwell, this isn't a surprise really.\n\nTaehyung and his Gucci...
This video is so cute i cant stop smiling
i love them and their drawings :(
HOW\n\nON EARTH\n\nARE THEY ABLE TO DRAW SO NEATLY FIRST TIME AND SO WELL\n\nAS AN ARTIST I WISH I COULD SO THIS LMAO CRI
Guys, is there going to be an EPISODE 2?!
4:57 - I think we all know why the girl laughs like that
So basically this was done before September came
*YESSS WERE ACTUALLY TREANDING #26 IN THE UK*
Somehow I think v can work in something like a creative management coz his idea is always out of the box but really work!
OK SO THIS IS ALSO TRENDING 😏😏\n**POWER OF BANGTAN**\n🔥🔥🔥
jin so friendly with the designer...
Wait Suga's a cookie... I guess when we call him a snack, they thought we weren't joking
Jungkook: Horse? Look at the mirror and draw yourself.\nJ-Hope: There's cameras here so don't make me swear. \n....\n....\nMe: Wait... J-HOPE SWEARS? WOAHHHH. :0
Jungkook we all like you but what you did to hobi is SERIOUSLY MEAN Dont do that !!!!
Kookie is my bias and I know it's all just for fun...but I still feel bad when they poke fun at Hoseok about the horse stuff. I'm pretty sure it isn't his favorite joke. Idk he's a good sport <3 but still
They're so mean to J-hope, you can tell it hurts his feelings...
TAEHYUNG HIMSELF LOOKS LIKE AN ART PIECE!!
All of these characters ate adorable but I love Mang the most
This reminds me of an American reality TV show😂😂
i know this was way before they appeared on Knowing Brother (based on their hair colour lol) but i really want my fellow Armys to stop calling hoba : horse etc , because when they were on knowing brother he said he wants to get a new nickname since he hated being called horse !!!
I love this!!! They're so cute ‹3
wait but wHere the hell is yoonmin? 😂
NVM
0:04 aka mine
My heartu
This is just so cute. I’m soft.
Did Suga just disappear when everyone else started to draw??
First of all, THE ENGLISH SUBS! Strong power thank you <3
aww they are so cute 💕
THANK YOU FOR ADDING ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!
V is a genius! He truly has unique ideas 😍
Jhope really drive me crazy lol but i still love him so much
Tae is such a genius, seriously. I love how he thinks out of the box.
BLESS THEIR ART♡♡♡ AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUBS
I can’t believe I stan these line stickers
Love from New Zealand ❤️🇳🇿
CAN I JUST THANK YOU FOR THE SUBS? YOU ARE THE BEST!

BT21 will be having merch at Dec~~ hope I could afford haha
I want to see jimins drawing
Mükemmelsiniz İ LOVE YOU  İ LOVE BTS ❤TURKEY ARMY ❤WELCOME TO TURKEY🇹🇷🇹🇷
I loved it how Hoseok looked like he was going to start swinging when Jungkook called him a horse shgfhdgf and Tae was extra cute with his baby chick face mask under his chin in this vid. Also 4:47 sounded like 'mamamoo' which I'm all for if I didn't perhaps mishear it 👀👀👀
if you listen to each of the characters ouo it describes them ouo \n\nalpha is jin oppa\n\nhorse is jhope oppa\n\nheart is v\n\nkoaloa us rapmon and he was drawing other emojis
Lol, V's collection of heart face character though. It's actually a great idea even though it's quite unusual.
If I were a female designer, I'd probably sit next to taehyung as well
taehyung already has so many ideas and thought since the beginning, and he looked more and more artistic nowadays👏I can really see that he will open an art show in seoul someday in the future
I really want to buy hoseok's character plushie if there's so much because IT LOOKS CUTE
I wanna be that persistent in life as hobbies ears are, everytime he wears a hat. :D
2:41 Jin picking on JHopie's drawing, 2:46 Rap Mon telling Jin to ease up... Daddy keeping mommy from nagging the kids! #namjin feels
JIN IS SO EXTRA. I REALLY LOVE THS ALPACA
For someone that really likes drawing, that table is HEAVEN OMG I WISH I HAD THOSE
OMG Jungkook and J-hope! They're still at it with the J-horse! 😂😂😂 I love them all so much
When will episode 2 come out?!!?!
These characters are gonna turn out so cute istg
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE! LOVE Y'ALL
the fact that j-hope's drawing is at a level i will seriously never each is kinda mind blowing. Also V is so cute with his heart faces !
Taehyung's character w/ the wormtail makes it look like.....sperm
I really do Love Tae's character, Tata ❤❤❤❤❤ can you tell? 😳
Aww they are so cute ♥♥♥♥ BTS ★★★
Tae looks like a kindergarden boy with his professor 😍😍

Keeping up with the sluts
Dead eyes, expressionless faces and vaginas like old wind socks, The Kardashians.

No need to learn the alphabet in Scott and Kourtney's house.  It's all about the numbers.  Money and ratings.  :-(
The trashiest family in America, make them go away...please.. I have money
Can someone tell me the number of this channel
First yasss
This comments section gives me some needed hope for humanity.
* palm * You don't have to like Radiohead, but to deny their musical talent is just foolish.
I can't face the evening straight.....This comments section offers me ESCAPEeeee
Oh Fox News, thanks for the laughs
Yeah..... She belongs in fox news
Well, jokes on you, I love Radiohead and I'm fat
Fox Mocks all the good acts, even Kendrick Lamar suffered the same.
The annoying thing about any music that doesn't perfectly fit the mold of what popular music has been for the past century is that it always gets dismissed by dumbasses with faulty logic\nRadiohead: moaning sounds over ring tones\nMetal: guy gargling over a lot of noise\nPunk: mediocre guitar players and a guy yelling into a mic\nRap: they're just talking and cursing a lot\nUgh like shut up already
I bet she thought she sounded very intelligent.
0:26 I feel you bro
At least she said they were elaborate at moaning and whining...that's enough for me. Even she can't escape the subconscious level Radiohead-music sneeks in to anyone's mind after a while..HA! Busted!
Me Watching This: What's This?
Fox News aside being a beehive of racists they're idiots and are a prime example of GOP being a mental disorder and they act bias, attack bands, gun control, Jim Carrey etc.\nNews should be called NEWS not a fucking predatory channel.\nNews should not be biased.\nAnchors should be fired if they attack anyone.\n\nbesides fuck news looks out of shape, malnourished, hickish and dumb.\nAll they can do is blame their problems on others.
With her opinion which is of no consequence at all
I don’t know what’s pathetic, here take on Radiohead or her having to lie about liking them just to be with other men. Seems like she hates herself.
0:26
What a stupid fucking cunt
Everything in its right place. An attention seeking blonde woman on Fox News and Radiohead (hopefully) in the hall of fame
Give up the host.
Fox is such a uneducated filth
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Radiohead. The music is extremely complex, and without a solid grasp of poetic analysis most of the lyrics will go over a typical viewer’s (radio)head. There’s also Thom Yorke's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Chomsky, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of their music, to realize that they’re not just sad- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Radiohead truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Down Is The New Up lyrics which itself is a cryptic reference to George Orwell's 1984. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jonny Greenwood's genius wit unfolds itself in their ears. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\n\n\nAnd yes, by the way, I DO have a Radiohead tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
She might be wrong.
On one hand,  I think she's joking.\n\n\nOn the other, I say we make her listen to The King of Limbs to really really REALLY confuse her.
Bet she thinks amy Schumer is a real comedian, dumb bitch.
Stupidity is strong with this CUNT
As I heard once : \nI've never hit a woman, but I surely can hit a bitch. And if a women is too much insolent, she become a bitch.
She probably only know like 3 of their songs, that's one of the bands that's really help the progression in many different king of style in the music industries! how can you did not recognize the group is talented to create this types of music... Your opinion value nothings to me!
I want her to disappear completely.
why does this have so many dislikes wtf
reminds me of that whore who just found glasses meme
I don't mind if she doesn't like Radiohead, but I hate how she generalizes Radiohead fans and mocks them. I love their songs and I'm healthy both physically and emotionally. (Actually I find her comment a bit hilarious at the same time,though. Sorry for my bad English. I'm not a native speaker.)
She associates Radiohead with all the wack dick shes gotten over the years. Thats why she doesnt like it.
She basically just slagged off a great band while simultaneously confirming she's a slag.
One day he'll get to you\nAnd teach you how to be a holy cow
“I will eat you alive” -Radyhed
Oh boy, I was trying so hard to respect wamen but, shit mate, I can't
Had to toss in some thinly-veiled homophobia at the end for good measure, of course.
It speaks poorly of her to have to pretend to like something to get the attention of someone.
Ha! I'm sure those guys listened to Radiohead, in part, to lament having to have spent time with you. Attractive, intelligent, yet without a clue.
Clearly her music knowledge or musicality are simple, too simple actually. Clearly, i bet that Classical Music not even her choice at all. Simple minded human who dont appreciate music progression will talk like this.. cant blame her... her comment doesnt affect Radiohead at all. Plus Radiohead Album Ok Computer has been archived anyway. So..... meh!! Move on... Next!!??
When Democrats took power they tried to wrap all of their dreams and desires into one big package, that's Obamacare.\n\nBoth party's in Congress have tried to Usurp power and has been by writing Ex Post Facto Law into our society by taking a good Bill with good intentions, and attaching trash to it! \n\nThey look for a bill they know will pass, then they write an amendment that will counter some other legislation that is already law! \n\nIn doing so the new laws, contradict the old laws, and no longer have any legal teeth! \n\nSo, when we the people who live under these laws stand up and say something about it, all we can do is Gum them death! \n\nThis is why our Founding Father's wrote in the Constitution, that no law that contradict the first 10 laws are allowed! Those laws are UNCONSTITUTIONAL, EX POST FACTO & ALL LAWS WRITTEN THAT ARE NOT INLINE WITH THE TRUE AND ABSOLUTE MEANING OF OUR US CONSTITUTION, ARE NULL & VOID.\n\nUnfortunately, the Patriot Act, the NDAA and now the soon be Liberty Act, and ObamsCare, are all Ex Post Facto Law's! \n\nThat's why none of these Congressmen & Senator's have any reason to retain there seat's! \n\nOther than the newest members and a hand full of dedicated people like Rand Paul should be in Congress!\n\nWe are coming after you, https://youtu.be/dSdeMdo_mic\n\nLV money trail, https://youtu.be/tVDVsw6xEpc\n\nHillary's America, https://youtu.be/L0eH-lSNUaY\n\nGirl named Hillary Sue's parents for naming her, https://youtu.be/_aWXnNJTzWE\n\nBiggest Conspiracy in US History! https://youtu.be/9_I3IHgJT-M\n\nThe real Russian plot, https://youtu.be/CpQDk8vb2uk\n\nD.O.J Bribed Russia, https://youtu.be/3EFXSHhonq8\n\nLot's of criminal activity in FBI, https://youtu.be/dobKjYM9DRI
how to get views, right?
Nobody should this seriously, just in itself it's idiotic...she's just making noise. Sure she has an opinion and that's fine but to say they aren't talented to just idiotic...well I mean it is fox news, I feel like she thinks like she's gonna stir the hearts of people with this 😂
I like the gg sign, it shows you cant argue with a stupid bitch like her
I'm sure her collection of 12 cd's is impeccable and in no way contains a single Adele album.  Because only talented musicians make clean and technically proficient yet re-hased music.  Stop chasing basic indie replicas in stripped shirts.
She pretend to mocks Radiohead but she is only making a fool of herself. This only shows how ignorant she is about music.
This is what happens when you put people who are not professionals in a context that require profession. or a certain level of expertise...which this girl clearly is lacking.
If that opinium was from a music critic i would accept it, even tho i disagree with it, but i would have understood it.\nThis person should stick to talking about the teletubies or something like that, suits her more.
Fck her i don't know her fck her go to hell
We make sad and depressed songs too ! Come check it out if you are a whiney Radiohead Fan !! =D
As if I needed even more reasons to hate this excuse of a 'news' channel.
I see Katherine is a fellow patrician. The plebs fear the patrician.
So this is just Punchup at a Wedding but on tv then?
don't attempt to construct a full opinion and present it to tv if all you listened to is one track from kid a
and she looks like a trashy pornstar ，who listen to Radiohead only for that D
Nobody should take this seriously. Fox News is a joke
First of all.. SHE'S RIGHT. Second, she's doing a bit. If you can't tell she's doing a bit, then you're a faggot. I like this chick and I have no clue who she is. She's like a female Gavin Mcinnes; saying outrageous & outlandish things for a reaction, but are based in fact. I don't think one thing she said came off insulting to Radiohead. And yes, Radiohead fans are generally pretentious hipsters who CAN'T WAIT to tell you about how much knowledge they possess regarding music and veganism. And why are you guilty white guys so Anti-Hot blonde, on Fox News? I'm a fan of Radiohead and have seen them live, so don't assume I'm some Top 40 radio hits listenin' yuppie.
It's not fame and power, it's being shallow and having bad taste.
I agree the only good thing about Radiohead is their music
I bet 100 bucks that she likes Justin Bieber
seems she's bitter about some sad sod who saw through her facade and realized I'm better off alone sad and malnourished than share my wasted sperm on this waste of sperm.
Lmao this bitch is complaining about having to pretend to like Radiohead. Maybe you should raise your standards, dumb bitch.
The guy on the far left of the panel clearly wanted to throttle her.
the thing is, that bunch of bullshit was completely scripted, i kinda feel sorry for the woman, she is gonna get a ton of crap and hate for a thing that her superiors told her to do...
I am strange, malnourished and sad! Call me xx, cellphone number is the 5
That's just, like, your opinion.
i will eat you alive and there'll be no more lies
0:26 sums up this entire video
Wow she has an opinion. Good for here because I can't stand that type of self serving attitude. Sometimes things aren't about you! I'd be curious what she listens to, probably nothing, all she thinks about is dick.
She should smoke some reefer and listen again.
Why in hell are the Moody Blues not in the Hall of Fame yet?
Well... I'm Strange, malnourished, and sad...and I *love Radiohead* since I'm 14, so...\n\nI dunno if she's wrong, I don't know anything anymore.\nIt's like I'm not here.\nThis isn't happening.
burn this whore
Best reaction ever 0:26
Radiohead will eat you alive
Kicking squealing Gucci little piggy
*FUCKING NORMIES, REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!*
I bet she listens to bands like Mumford & Sons and Imagine Dragons or any other intolerably bland music.
Poor poor girl...as superficial as synthetic... Burn the wich!
She probably listens to Adele smh
We have crashed her panties*....
F#ck Fox News
She buzzes like a detuned radio.
That chick's got myxomatosis...
It's True!
Mujer idiota

Típica rubia imbécil con cerebro de maní que no tiene idea alguna de música...Te apuesto que si le pones a Maluma, la muy tonta se derrite de inmediato.
radiohead arent famous... they are talented !!!
wtf i love radiohead now
Ok.
Yo soy gordo y feliz y tengo una bella familia y me encanta radiohead desde que tengo 15 años es una de mis bandas preferidas y no por eso ando depresivo y vomitando mi neurosis al mundo al contrario ..asi que tapate la boca antes de hablar gringa facha
Hey man, she's got a point. If the past 50+ years have proven anything, it's that the best songwriters, even artists in general, are overwhelmingly conservative & right-leaning. We all know this.
La cara del gorila que esta al lado!!! .. que mierda esta hablando esta mierda rubia!!
Can somebody shoot that cunt please?...
456 obese radiohead fans disliked this.
lol she described it perfectly!
Ive been playing this song when i put on my makeup, and this has been making me and my beat look smokey a'f !

Awesome this is awesome but I really get gay vibes front this music video lol

Take a small bite everyday
Next time someone asks me what glo-up means I'll just show them pure coconut head ass Taemin from Replay then subject them to Lee Slaymin's Move cuz zayum
Is it too much to say this song and dance give me Michael Jackson vibes?
A minutes prayer for all the SHAWOLs, whose breath departed their bodies upon seeing this. For that must be why the views on this aren't exploding into the stratosphere.
woahh compared to his debut days he glo’d up real good
why was this the most sexual thing i've ever watched. omg. beauty.
Teaming new moves his hands in ways not humanly possible
I can't!  I'm dead!
amazing song, sensual dance,  entire video in the rain, revealing clothes.....\nTaemin is feeding us well honey!
My sexuality is so confused right now, but I'm still dancing.
Why are people sleeping on this tf???!!!????
Legit almost fainted on the sidewalk when I saw him sway his body oh so slightly at 1:00.
0:39 made me swoon, this is seriously wonderful
His killing me as always! Love this whole album!!

I didn't know it was physically possible to be more attracted to him. I love seeing his evolution as an artist, this is just really beautiful to watch and the dance is SO SEXY hot damn
I am not even a Shinee fan and I think he's the only kpop artist worthy as the walking definition of sexiness! <3
I was watching so many rookies that I actually forgot how AMAZING the kings are, omg. The feeling I got was like my universe was expanding once again, wtf, I need water. I'm so happy talent exists. Vote Taemin for president?? lol, you wish. Vote Taemin for god already.

does anyone else get gay vibes from taemin?
is it just me, or does taemin suddenly look sooooo much older here??
i love how the dogs keep trying to steal the questions 😂😂😂
What is the song called at the beginning of the video?
ADORABLE I LOVE THE COMBINATION OF DOGS AND DEMI ITS SO CUTE
No shade cuz i like Demi but what number one single is speaking of? @2:55
Adorable queen with adorable puppies ☺️💜 and her laugh is the best 😂 please do this with Ariana 💖
Her laugh is seriously the best thing ive ever heard 1:27
Her laugh tho...I WANNA LISTEN TO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN
Seeing everbody commenting 'I NEED TO SEE ******** WITH PUPPIES' and me thinking we need shawn mendes on this show but then 2 secs later reality comes crashing down like the fourth wall bc HES ALLERGIC 😭😭😂
I have the deluxe i dont see the song smoke and mirror..does anyone else?
Make a video playing with puppies w| nick Jonas
Please do Norman Reedus plays with puppies and answers questions!
I've always loved Demi since I was a kid BUT DAMN THIS DEMI IS EVERYTHING I WANT TO ME
lol 😂 I need a dog 🐶
I want this with 5sos3 is out :(
The puppies are cute and this is a creative idea and all but it gives me so much anxiety. I think if anything the information would come across better in two separate videos. Answering questions, THEN playing with puppies. Idk just a thought
Most of the songs she mentions aren’t on the album
I love your tattoos you got on your arm.They look beautiful 😁
Demi Lovato what's your phone number please tell me
her laugh when the dogs peed is keeping me alive
I never loved that much an artist as I love Demi, since the very beginning 🖤. You're such an inspiration for my music. This girl 🖤🖤🖤
If I ever become a celeb or anything can I get both puppies and kittens? 😂💖
She’s the love of my life
PLEASE DO ONE WITH HARRY STYLES (but with kittens)
i love her so much
Demi and the puppies are so cute!!!

SHE IS LOOKING BEAUTIFUL AS ALWAYS, DEMI SLAYS
skip to 0:36 - 0:57 - 1:27 - 2:18 - 2:30 - 2:37 - 3:07 - 5:55 for the cutest laughs. you're welcome :)
This is my favorite video ever! Because it has Demi love to and puppies the best things in the worlddddd
Demi’s laugh is EVERYTHING!!!
When did Demi have a number one?
the dogs are so cute they are just playing all around her lol!!
At 4:13, she says the most personal song on her album is Ready For Ya, but that’s not a song on the album. I’m so confused lol
im a guy so this is a very accurate observation. she is literally one cheeseburger away from ballooning into a fat bitch. how does nobody else see this?
Her laugh gives me life!
Puppies are so distracting wth 😭❤ I only got half of what she said
i love her laugh
I love you so much, you’re such an inspiration to me! 💜 & I love you’re laugh it’s too cute 😂💜
“Your a boy, I just found that out” 😂😂
Demi Lovato being as beautiful as ever and also puppies? My gay ass really can’t take this
If you ever do this with sabrina carpenter, it will be the end of her
Her laugh is the best
Demi's laugh is everything 😍💀😂
Puppies and demi, my two favorite things 😍😍
6:18 that moment you wish you were that puppy.. lucky baby ❤
Wow that puppy can talk and read 😱😍
When she said awe puppies and burried her face in the dog my heart melted
Smoke and mirrors and ready for ya? Aren’t on the album? I don’t see them? Unless I’m blind?
I want a puppy just because demi lovato touched it
I love Demi’s laugh she is just so wholesome
I got the deluxe album and smoke and mirrors isnt on it but nevermind i still love it haha
i love these! do one with harry styles!
Little Mix should totally do this x
why are my two fave songs not on the album?
MY GIRL!!!!!!!! YOU DA BEST DEMI!

Oh boy here I go spending again!
You know considering the smallest things offend people nowadays I'm surprised Ubisoft (or any studio for that matter) is allowed to make these games or tv shows but boy I'm glad they do
Available now?  My copy won't be here until tomorrow :-(
nudity at 1:03
Unlock the game. For god's sake unlock the game
SO GLAD there are no LOOT BOXES in this game.
Is it already out or is it gonna be available tmr?
I got it free jajaja
I love the last game
I finished Stick Of Truth so I'm definitely buying this game.
I like how it says out now and the game isn't even out yet. Biggest fail ever.
nem lança para xbox360
super Craig! is gay
This trailer is lit lmfao wtf
well great my order hasnt come yet
I'm going to be f***in broke as hell
I love how the lady announcing the free purchase at the end sounded so out of place compared to the trailer and monotone.\n\nI kinda wished Cartman would interrupt her or have him do the announcement
confirmed, you can play as a female character in the game BUT everyone will still call you a HE for some reason
I can't wait
When are we gonna get The stick of truth ?
I just don^t understand how it is possible . I can play on my PC in Prey (2017).  And this game doesn^t . How ? Somebody explain me.
Xbox Live can take all my money but NO STICK OF TRUTH UNTIL LAUNCH. Oh well I'm excited as hell
WTF is southpark doing making another fucking amazing game, like come on give other games a chance  you cant make something this perfect
Can't wait to pick this up later! Love South Park humor!
Love the game even it isnt already launched. I'll make a video about the game :3
that shold Be a movie
I hope its out and as funny as stick of truth
Holy f--k!!!! I'M SO EXCITED..........*looks at steam*...........you son of a b--ch..........
Today,...The Heroes of South Park will Rise!
can’t wait for assassins creed origins
Ubicrap u r game has been cracked.u use denuvo.we r not buying this game.bethesda is not use denuvo in evil within 2.we already bought that.
Need to buy this game.
Please make us a switch version
Available now *cries on steam.
This game is somehow more crazier than the stick of truth
If no one else will say it I will\n\nThis game is severely over priced
are they allowed to swear in traliers
Epic 😃
Downloading right now! The Stick of Truth was hilarious. I don't doubt that this will be just as good
Is the stock of truth a preorder bonus?
This should be on nintendo switch
Here's another idea when you say you have customer support actually supports your damn customers
1:40 is when the trailer ends
YOU MADE THIS GAME
F affa.....Fastpass
Did she twerk to attack at 0:58

So what is it called when you give someone money for something and they don't give you the item you paid for isn't that I don't know stealing
Omg
Where's Mintberry Crunch!?
That last line😂
Give me my game and my Coon figuring that I ordered last year you thieves
Well who ever SOT free with purchase wish it came true
I don’t understand how people are playing it right now
Cartman's laugh when he says 'whole'. \n😂😂😂
Who else is waiting for it to release?
it releases at midnight!!! whooo!!!!
I live in the US and my PS4 says it has 16 hours 19 minutes and 55 seconds left. \nAnd 6 hours left on the pre-load.\nObviously leaked.
Great performance from Alexandra. I wish she’d return to music . I miss her amazing voice and music.
It's impossible for me to watch this and not have the biggest smile on my face ❤️✨
Pure class.Looks like 2 professional dancers.
She can sing, she can dance, she's pretty, and she's unproblematic. Absolute travesty that she's not selling out stadiums all over the world
“All my ladies you can do it. You can do it even better in broken heels” LOVE ALEXANDRA!!!!
LOL at all the jealous people disliking the video. I know the 'jealousy' card is overused but it's obvious in this case.
No offence to Alexandra- she’s amazing, but I can’t help staring at Gorka. That man is beautiful....
9
This is everything 😚
She's so fast you can't even put a STOP Sign in front of her
Damn girl she's🔥👏💞 on fire
I think you will find that is proud Mary by Creedence Clearwater Revival.
As a huge Tina Turner fan, she definitely did her proud!! Amazing!!
Best dance so far by a mile, no slips. She's joined the group of great jives up with Scott, Jill, Austin, Jay and Ore. 10.
Brilliant 😁😁😁😁
THEY LOOK FAB! I'll be so upset if they don't win they are clearly the best
Who remembers the days when X Factor was better than Strictly ...
My winner by far 😆😆💛💛💛
Bloody hell, that performance  was fire. I might just watch the series.
She’s on speed clearly
She was tina here ..
Ok this is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen
MY GIRL ON TRENDING
Amazing !
U
Just WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ALEX BURKE!! YESS!!
hi
#1 on trend!
I love Strictly
gooD
Ohhhh dear me
video verry good luck
https://youtu.be/ebeoacmAhXc ur welcome
1010101010!
She was great.
OMG
Good afternoon
1 on trending congratulations guys!!!
By ccr not tina turner
Diva!!
Alex and gork, absolutely amazing, Sue 💞 🎶
what is dis
Woah! What A Dance! Enthusiasm Truly Seen! For Dancing A Song From The 2015 Group Dance Finale, And SHOCKING ME In The Start, I Give A Big Fat 100!
still living for this!!!!!!
B O N E L E S S T R E N D I N G
My jaw dropped when I saw this on TV !!! SHES SO GOD DAM GOOD
I'm not an Alexandra fan at all, but OMG can that girl dance. That was sensational, and the body on her. Absolutely fantastic
best evil dance ever seen... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo22Al8H7GU
Come on Tina , give her a call!
Thanks to the band and singers for keeping it tight...
Hey guys, I've been making YouTube videos for a while now and I'm really trying to reach 200 subs, I would really appreciate it if you subbed ❤️
I takes a lot for me to take my eyes off Gorka and she certainly did! Absolutely phenomenal dance, especially this early in the competition!
PRO ENTERTAINER BEING GOOD AT SOMETHING WELL WE NEVER SAW THAT COMING DID WE
That was awesome.  \nI might start watching this show now.
Her husband disliked the video 127 times
She’s an amazing dancer. But to pretend this is a 10 is misleading. She clearly has sickle feet. Aston (as much as I’m not a fan of his dancing, forcing as much hip hop moves in to the dance as possible), got railroaded for having pigeon toes. Not fair this was given a ten. But her energy was awesome and she is clearly the strongest dancer. Still a winner.
OMG I remember watching Alexandra win the X factor years ago when I was a kid! It's great to see her more!
The footwork is incredible
*retrieves jaw from the ground*
This is a great performance from Alexandra.
She is a star 🌟 she is bringing soul back to life! Love her! ♥️🤗 I hope she wins! 👍😎
Alexandra's mother would be so so proud of her...she looks amazing up there....
Hope she wins the show!
Addictive, can't stop watching it, that was superb. 👏🏽scd I agree routine was hot.
Whoo who!!, That was fabulous!, I think I’m in love with this couple 👍 awesome job Alexander and Gorka
I can't believe they got 39 on week four
1like = your person of choice will win\nSubscribe=you’ll be on strictly
reminds e of Alesha and also Nathalie gummede    and all the fuss because shes ccouldnt t do her jive  to this song and she was the favourite at the time
Do a good deed today and click the link to my video to help me reach 10,000 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO8EnOeMrRI
Song is by creedence clearwater revival...tina only covered it
John Fogerty was such a great songwriter.
Dont watch this video .... \nI repeat its a trap. Dont watch this video\nhttps://youtu.be/W7GY8HPG-pc
Alexandra deserves to win this series! That's only if people stop voting for Ken & Barby!
My Grandma is obssessed with strictly come dancing
She's so sexy 😍😍
How to get Spotify Premium for free on my channel thoooo
Go girl, you are killing it 💖💟
Look at the two of them go!
Trying to reach 20k views I’m on 17k please help,me get views by watching my videos please 😆😆
Riccardo Cocchi & Yulia Zagoruychenko  are the best!!!   Incomparable \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RZ2g8Kw198
Cutest elephant ever!
She should do porn instead.
I don’t know why this got tens. She was so technique wise shit.
I black who can Dance so what? \nWould anyone be surprised if a white invented flights to the sun?

🐰If you subscribe to me and i will  subscribe back 🐰plz 🐰
kalyeserye
One question, why did the BBC cut Alexandra hair in the thumbnail?🤔🤔🤔
Can you sub me I need to get to 325 subscribers before my birthday 28th October it’s all I would like for my birthday! Besides giving my family more love for the next chapter of my life 💗💗💗
why does she have different hair in the thumbnail?
Definitely a great performance from Alex and partner but I hope Craig was on his feet in disgust about them not sticking to the '10 second rule'!!!
Check out my page 20 years in maximum security prison
This was an ok performance but not worth the 10s given. Picking a winner at week four is both biased and a little premature.
Her singing career didn't work out so she's doing this ahahah #fail
Brilliant energy, but the slide between Gorkas legs wasn't as smooth as it could have been and where were kicks and flicks ?  Also why no comment on pincy toes that seems a big deal with certain celebs?  Great dance but not a 10
shes a trained dancer though!!! it'd be like David Beckham playing in a celebrity football match¬!!!\n\nthe fake tears every week dont help either!
Oh dear oh dear, choreographed by Craig Revile Horwood in Sister Act and you say she's not a professional?? Shame that the comments have been removed from here regarding this.
Trouble is she ain't no amateur. West end show, coached by Craig, cheater!
I'm an Arsenal fan with a new channel so if any of you have time to check out my vids I'd appreciate it so much 🙏🏽 (Remember to sub if you enjoy! 💪🏽)
Robbie repeating You're a world class player big money blah blah blah. about Ozil is so dumb.  Ozil ain't MUFC RVP in 2012. It's like he's reading a personality plus trait on FIFA. Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world and even he missed a sitter recently. MUFC bitches
When Welbeck misses he's bambi on ice, when Ozil misses it's not his fault because he didn't deliberately miss.
let robbie talk for Christ sake
He seems to have a speech afliction.
This nightmare will continue until Wenger and the board are out.... end of.
Watford came to that match with no fear...Arsenal defence is not strong enough
if you can't score park the bus
someone should punch dt in the mouth
Oh arsenal we hate you COME ON YOU SPURS🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
DT Kissing Ozil Arse again. Did Iwobi miss deliberately? Ozil is ex Real Madrid, Iwobi is ex academy🤓
h
I love DT! Mate, if you ever make it to Houston Texas(I don't know why) I'll buy you a few pints. You are my favorite Gunner along with Robbie!
What a mincer DT is. Better chance of him bumming you than fighting you.
I'm not a arsenal fan but dt makes this channel very interesting
Chill out..lol..its only football..well not in Arsenals world.😎
Hit the nail on the head. Major underlying problems. You can't polish a turd
Ozil must go,he is a complete shit
Arsenal should be added to 1000 ways to die.
DT was stupid. ....no player misses deliberately. ...get a grip and stop defending ozil
Thats too strong, thats too strong Robbie SHFU DT!! Ozil is overrated and let the fans down. He does not care! I agree Wenger, Kroenke, Gazidis and so on are the main problem. Instead of buying Ozil, they should have pushed for Higuain. But, Arsene is indecisive and as soon as another club competes for a player, he buckles! We gave in to Napoli for a measley 2 mil. pounds. Then he should have used the buy back clause to get Cesc back the following season. Cesc is way better than Ozil in my opinion, and I have been saying this for years! I was saying during the Watford game, please do not let Ozil enter the pitch, bring on Wilshere who is hungry! I also felt he should have sold Sanchez as he does want to be at the club, but Wenger is clueless and undecisive. This goes much deeper than the issues I have portrayed and we have to put up with at least 2 more seasons with Wenger :(
Man City is slapping things up cause they make it rain cash on that cash club, what ya expect?
arsenal fantv is more entertaining than their games
Robbie if you ask a question then have the decency to let the other person answer, stop cutting them short
Subscriber to me if you want arsene Wenger to be sacked
DT is the only one who is level headed enough not to blame Ozil for missing his chance.
Not only Watford laughing at the Arse.Ffs...just fukin accept you ain't all that and believe me you won't get soooo carried away with your shite performances and lack of bollocks in your team.\nThis is not a dig at your club, just a statement of fact.\nI'm west ham...I know we're shite so I'm never suprised when we put in shite performances on the pitch.\nIt's like England FC,Does anybody seriously believe we'll win the WC next year?\nNo?Why?Cos we know we ain't good enough.Iceland ffs.\nSo don't get suprised when a good Watford team who never say die roll you over.\nRing Ring....reality calling.
Surely I'm not the only one that has watched this for over 3 times
His from Luton and support arsenal lol wt mug
Emre Can in the background
watching totenham's against real madrid made me realise how extremely below par Arsenal is, Arsenal is slowly becoming a Mid Table team right before our  very own eyes!!!!
After every arsenal game here's my next stop happy to see at least we're the best in something
I'd like u to see run a football club we will see arsenal in the championship
Arsenal are a joke
Everytime Arsenal loses a match, this guy get richer.
If the one with the ridiculous hat had a brain he would be dangerous...What crap. He should blow it out of his arse\ninstead of on this nonsense site.....
Arsenal have most stupid fans. They get spit into face almost every week and they keep saying its just raining...
Im a united fan but i watch more arsenal fan tv just for the laughs
He's from Luton looooool
2:20 and 4 minutes later says 6:17. You know, because he's such a rationale man
ozil is demanding big money, to compensate for the lack of ambition of the club.
Blah, blah, blah, arsenal will win the f.a cup, and europa this season, and you will still be bitchin, what more you lot want,
Be a million views soon
Canadian mass sensitive opinion demonstrate wisdom report historically necessity.
Why does he think Ozil is really good at the moment he's doing shit
This guy needs to learn how to direct his aggression!
this shameless creature called robbie my name is desperate larry no no bob smith
Watford played well, they got lucky. They added new players and they only recently become a decent side. I give em respect
A major problem is this strange accent that seems to be prevalent across the UK. What happened to regional dialects?
Ozil missed is not that dramatic. Players like messi , ronaldo missed easier situation like those very often.  Agree with DT , letting fans down is a word too harsh to use.
It's more offside than your belly!
Love the way DT shut that mug up lol.
‘We’re a top 6 team’ shut up😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish I was as tough as DT he's so dangerous
I feel bad for Sanchez and Özil, they deserve to play in a better team. They are world class players
ha ha ha ha ha he comes from luton  why ent he sayin fam and blood anymore non stop i thought he was from jamaica the other week
This guy is such a mug
BMT HE DOES NEED TO STOP TAKING LACAZETTE OFF AFTER 65 MINUTES, ITS SO JARRING, LET HIM FINISH THE GAME
Tell me how this guy actaully had some pretty good points and then he brought up Arse Wenger
Fat Robbie he always put the blame Ozil for arsenal lost thanks DT for defending Ozil
DT just imagine how good it is to be a tim winning every single week fucken amazing also up the ra🇮🇪🇮🇪
It's not just Wenger, It's Ozil, and every other player on that team. All garbage, Sanchez playing like garbage on purpose because he's stuck in a trash can of a club. complete overhaul needed.
The thing about Arsenal is there to flat, they need to use there big name players to attract more talent. That’s why Arsenal need to spend yeah Lacazette decent but is he really going to attract world class players? Cause the CL looks miles away now
To be fair its not just Watford fans who are laughing at you hahahaha Muppets.
#4 on trending. Robbie is laughing his head off haha
How can someone be so evil... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo22Al8H7GU
Amir kahn in the background
So what is an arsenal fan. I don't think I have ever seen a real arsenal fan. They diss there own club
what is this role reversal at the start\n\ndt defending players robbie going hard\n\nwat
I'm glad the fa banned the Watfords player for diving. A nice 3 game ban
Lmao after so much shit talking ozil's miss I went to see it. It's a common damn miss. World class players miss chances like that very often. Arsenal's problem is that they have very few chances like that, so whenever someone misses, it's a freaking tragedy.
I hate arsenal and one day I will take over the world and make all of you work In a death camp
It's called gettn owned. Ohhhhhhhh
How is Watford>Arsenal
gobshite
THIS FAT TRAMP THINKS HES HARD LOL
He speaks alot of sense tbf
Man's from Luton. Proper stinky gypo!

Get this arse nal your just Shite utter Shite
I enjoy seeing Arsenal rot
Do you not think all this shit is getting boring now?
this video made me want to sit under my chair
GO FOR THERESA MAY!!
i wish you would just go you parasitical hack with you same ass fake shit
1:33 She's improvising Brexit, like a never-ending Jazz solo.
First time i came across this video and i already love him already!   lol
this is better than the actual news
Let Boris show you how it's done... But seriously Theresa fuck off!\n\nThis killed me😂💀
Swearing in front of children. Nice one
When you understand that politics is based on money and power and the dividing of people.\nYou totally understand why it gets people worked up like this douche.\nBrexit the whole f in thing. \nAnd can someone please look in to Tony Blair a bit more? I remember him bringing a ps4 back from the US, was a gift before it was out. and he got away with it cos he was PM, well let's bring it all back up. Toss these a holes in to the pits!\nPlease, thanks!
Unlike Teresa May.. Palletways deliver!  I think the driver IS a straight white male.
Come on Jonathan where's your diatribe against the vicious cruelty of Universal Credits? If you can't stick it to the slime balls on this you have lost it.
Jeremy Paxman asked her if she believed in Brexit during the campaign and she declined.
If you U turn twice, you're back where you started 😂 true!
This is a long ad for Palletways.
I agree entirely with his summary of May, but very, very misleading and sensationalising the case about EU nationals.  Nobody at all is saying foreign nationals will be ejected from the UK if there's no deal, the issue is what rights the people here and UK nationals in the EU will have, and which court will hold jurisdiction in both cases.  Those aren't small matters that can be rushed into or done blindly.  Labour said they'd grant EU nationals here residency rights, but said so without having any clue what that would actually mean in practice - that's just a ridiculous, negligent, and irresponsible stance to take because it would give the EU complete control over deciding the outcome, and the UK with no cards to look after our own citizens living in the EU.  Oh, we'd just trust the EU to do the right thing by the UK?  Ha!  In the words of Pie  fuck off!!!
I do not recall the last time that in such a short space of time have I heard such a vulgar, disgusting barrage of swear word's, was it at lunch today? Or breakfast this morning? Hmm, I just dont recall, I love it.
Totally brilliant as ever Mr Pie!\n\nThe weird thing is that nearly 5% disagree with you.  What planet are they on?
Great stuff!!  Once again Pie tells it how it is.  Take his advice Theresa. - please take his advice.
No one voted for this well not actually right is it?
Someone actually worthy of being on the trending tab.
Pie Takes the Cake. This guy... people on the street are staring thinking he's a real newscaster.  this is awesome... if I wanted to know about what was going on in Britain... I would watch Jonathan pie.
I hope Tom Walker is not ever considering visiting North Korea - if he does, he won't come out alive! Also, if Laura Kuenssberg now needs a bodyguard, then certainly Tom will need one as well. I'm sure his persona here has ruffled a few right wing feathers along the way, particularly if we are to believe that Jonathon Pie had some influence on the younger voter voting for Corbyn in the last election!
Why are English people so cringeworthy? Particularly when it comes to politics.
A remoaner if I ever saw one.\n\nYou can just tell he's the type of doode who catches you fucking his wife and wants to take a walk in Hyde park with you to talk it out, little cuck.
This woman told the whole world during the election campaign that she is a difficult woman she warned the British public why complain now anyone who vote for her deserve what they get she didn't force anyone to vote tory everyone has the free will to choose to vote labour Conservative or any party but lies promises brainwashing and you all taught immigrants were a threat to your own selfish interest got this country to where it is don't blame the government blame yourselves if the people are good the leaders will be good if the people are bad then the leaders will be bad it's the public who elect the leaders the leaders don't elect themselves
1:00 we deliver thats the most straight forward slogan ever.
why does this remind me of DT on Wegner
Every 1 COME TO THE MILLION MASK MARCH  November the 5th
He really stuck the landing on this one. Bravo.
Jonathan's on the trending page! Next stop 10 Downing Street.
Not Palletways again! They've been video/film bombing since the bloody 70's!
As a Muslim who has mostly voted labour my whole life and who voted Brexit, may couldnt organise a piss up in a brewery. If shes not going to deliver she needs to hand the reins over.
The message here is....fuck off.
Reminds me of Glen from The Thick of It
Stop beating around the bush, are you a Theresa May fan or not????
get off the street you bellend.
So much gloom and doom about. By cunts like him. Life has never been so good living in the UK at any time in the last 10000 years. We are leaving the EU and corbin will never see power.
Stop sitting on the fence and tell us what you really think Mr Pie
I wish people would leave the woman alone! Let her get on with the job and quit the speculation. Pathetic video.
That was some delivery. PM you watching....
But seriously Theresa, FUCK OFF!! 👏👏😂😂\nTime for change! Wenger out...
I love how the bagpipes ramped up along with the speech
i am worry that he might get heart attack ... 🙄 he get high blood pressure
This would be a news programme I could get behind.
Thinks he a newsman he’s just a stupid cunt
Brexit in a nutshell... Well said
Good show.   The woman is incapable of doing anything but swallowing whatever is poured into her poisoned chalice.
Fuck off theresa may back in the kitchen where you belong ya daft bint.
so what do u suggest we replace her with, marxist corbyn the ira lover
You got my attention , well done
She shouldn’t be in power
BLOODY BRILLIANT took the words right out of my mouth respect !!!
May out, Pie in.
I'm on the right side of the political spectrum 😎.
What’s your thoughts on the poverty slope of austerity they call “Universal Credit” Mr Pie ?
Watched twice. This one is a gem!
Do you have to swear every 5 seconds? Or are too thick to talk without filling the space with uneeded vile language? Yeah I get swearing can bring a across how strongly you feel about a subject but that much just makes you sound like you suffer from tourettes or just brain damage.\nIf no one voted for Teresa she wouldn't be prime minister but she is and she did it legally lol
These people in power need to be dragged into the streets and have a cucumber forced up their arse.
Who else is going to do Brexit ? Labour ? Liberal Democrats ? Don't make me laugh. As far as I don't like Teresa May I'm afraid that she's the best there is right now. (Will not reply)
Love a slice of the pie... Real views presented in comedy. Keep baking these pies please!
Im starting to wonder if Teresa may ever wrote information on her hypothesis in any coursework she may have gotten or did she just pay someone else to answer for her?
So is it time to Fuck off Theresa or time to fuck off, Theresa? I can’t do anything until I know if it’s addressed to her or a call to arms for the rest of us..
Somone get this man a raise
Not going to lie,  this guy is not funny whatsoever
The people in the background like Dude what the F*ck
This Pie is well past his 'Best Before' date 🤢
Muh straight white male If only you had cancer as progressive as your politics. Its not racist if its against whites, sexist if against men or bigoted against straight people, right? Cunt.
he said no one voted for eu nationals to be bargaining chips I personally voted for brexit coz I'm sick of all the eu nationals I really don't care about tariffs etc, I'm sick of the fucking bozos!!!
Put this guy in Parliment.
2:11\n13\n(6_+)\nPay the Bill or the kid gets it!\n(-_-)\nBetter do as he says 33!\n(9_+)\nNo!\n(-_-)\nMe either!   I'd rather die!
Sub-farage omg

This comeback is going to be epic. Prepare my fellow ONCE to be sent to the heavens ONCE again. No matter how hard you try to endure the beauty and sound they produce, you’re going to get slayed every time.

If I were in music I'd definitely have Dame Dash by my side...
i knew dame did backflips when all that shit came out cuz hes been voicing that for a whole decade i remember him getting blackball in hollywood cuz he bark at him ... good or bad dame keeps it real i give him that ...
I don't want to tale the wrong story but didn't Dame say he hugged one of Harveys women and Harvey got sour ??? I can't figure out the angle on this Harvey Weinstein news because they never BAG a White Jewish man like this . He fucked with the wrong somebody.
This is why so many sambo, coon, uncle tom and bed wench negroes(male & female) talk so negative about Dame. Because he wasn't scared of cracKKKer's and talked bad to they shady azz's LOL.
That BIG artwork in the back is dope.
Dame dash defines a strong black man. He refuse to sell his soul for a dollar.
I like Dame he is the definition of a real husler.
if dame would had pulled off paid independently
Now everyone knows why he was BLK Balled he knew too much lucky they didn't smoke him
Dame dash spoke only nothing but the truth on the culture vultures lyor Cohen etc Dame dash is da truth that blackballed Dame for speaking up to the powers that shouldn't be old slaves was in chains new slaves are in denial Dame dash n myself only got but knowledge of self
Soon as this Weinstein thing started to blow, I thought about Dame's relationship to them and how people will look at him now. I worked w/ people like the Weinsteins in entertainment.  Please trust, many people knew and remained silent. They took the money . There is the lesson.
What he said about his daughters is exactly how I feel. I saw this shit and I looked at how I would want my daughters treated and was like naw I ain’t fuckin with that. It’s funny how all the shit he has said and done came full circle.
I dont always agree with Dame but when he right he be fucking right....
great interview...Dame you continue to inform and inspire. I worked with you when I was doing Artist Development at Polygram. I rocks with you bro. Respect/Salute!!!
So nerds are disrespectful..🤔 lol
Why did Obama send his daughter to intern for that scum Weinstein?
Dame is a GENIUS
So Dame. I dig everything you are doing and your speech and perspective on this society. However, if you recall. You threw Cosby under the bus a while back. But in this interview, you seem to dance around the issue of Weinstein. At least you use a different code of speaking about Weinstein. Why is that???🤔
Once fucking again dame prove yall fukk nigga  wrong he neva get his kudos it's sad how mf is slow nd it hard being a being a futuristic dang stay dropping jewels on you slow motherfukers they hate on great mf dame dash
i remember dame talking about the weinsteins years ago! i didnt know what he was talking about but i rmember his dislike was undeniable
I Like The Franc... - PAUSE! lmao! Yea, baby! Harlem to Luxembourg - Get Ya' Cheddar!
17:51 A lot of people get famous and become dark 'cause of what they to had to do to get famous; *it takes a lot of your soul*  - Dame Dash -
I NEED THAT BIGGIE PORTRAIT!!!!!!!!!! HOW DO I GET IT?????
Dame real street dude real af I believe over Jay z anytime Jay-Z a good artist but a puppet a uncle Tom a cracker slave. Fuck niggas be like he got money why  you hating.
Dame gone be on top. N da end Jay sold out to be lyors Lil girl
If anyone doesn’t respect this dude’s candor, you’re the nerd he stays away from because you’re a victim of society’s mind conditioning to think differently from this type of mentality.
Love Dame too, but Dame know about the casting couch.  He has to know what women and men are doing for celebrity.  Groupies and video vixen operated in a similar fashion.  People are attracted to power and willing to compromise for power.  Dame is ostracized because he wont bend the knee and kiss the ring.
I fugg wit dam but he's hypocritical right now. we don't turn a blind eye n Harlem but at the same time supporting no snitching....what's it gonna b fam?
That's me all the way, there's been a lot of times I had to stand alone, but for the truth it's worth it..
Dame if you listen to dame closely he defiantly always dropping jewels 💎 like a preacher only thing the preacher fake!
Always got time for Dame..and big up yourself Kenyatta
@ 25:29...Stacey Dash??? I thought they wasn’t cool. Can’t break family I guess.
He that rebuketh a man, afterward shall find more favor than he that flattereth with the tongue.\nProverbs 28:23 KJVA
Love this guy (Dame).  Because he always keeps it 100
Dame is Lying about standing up for the weak. Seen him midtown shopping, he was walking out the store i was walking in and i was like ohh what's up dame...he said Get the Fuck away from me
Did you hear the contradiction, black dudes talk more bullshit,
I love how Dame talks over bro every time he tries to contribute to the convo 😂😂😂
wait are you saying Jay z is touring cause he needs the money? please let me know cause if you believe that with all due respect I have end this conversation and use my energy to debate with people who know better
keep up the great work
Perception is power. If u cant be a boss have a boss mentality.
Hold up if u run a company.....Can yu get voted out?
Damn is truth, he’s evolved into being king , he’s full of knowledge in this business world ✊🏽✊🏽
Dame is a underrated GOAT and always been mislead, but he speaks truth and facts but he been preaching shit before like he said became popular this is not the first situation either. I've been researching and learning about this dude for years now, I'm just 24 so I wasn't comprehending who he was as a child growing up. I love what he values, and that's himself, his people and family every powerful black man should, Kenyatta too and I have a great pleasure following these guys because of what they stand for. The devil is real and your independence, freedom, and integrity matters more than anything, nevere sell your soul, don't care what the price at the end is...I rather be poor, struggling but happy rather than rich, hot headed and depressed because people control my life/freedom f-- that. :| It's half the reason why a lot of rich ppl complaining or committing suicide now, the pressure is real out here in the fame world.  Thanks for this video fellas <3 x
I value Dame alot. Luv his perspective & perception. He delivers his messages with righteousness, genuineness, substance & quality. Money can't buy that! Dame Dash is priceless!No bs. Doesn't get the credit he deserves. I got nothing but respect & Luv 4 Dame & Kenyatta bc im big of positive energy & good character!
I swear even back in the days I digged Dame,  real dude and people let media and false perceptions take away that his is a true Black Icon who did for our people,  y'all need to recognize.
Great interview. You are going to be old longer than you will be young. Invest for your older self. Salute to dame.
Dame Blacked on Harvey in a Hollywood restaurant back in the day! And, because of it they blackballed him! Now look what happen! Dame was always 💯‼️
Dame has always been ahead of the curve smart man 💯 but he will never get his credit because he's not up how he use to be
Good Game. Thanks Kenyatta and Dame. Just subscribed please subscribe back.
Props to Dame for the code
Dame on point, always great content to help push the Culture in a forward progress. Appreciate the call to action guys. That's Wasss Up! 👌🏾
Spoken like a TRUE HARLEM CAT!!!!  LOVE DAME!!!  ALL THESE MUTHAFUCKA CONDOLING THESE FOUL DUDES
Dame always been solid. My guy
listen to his breakfast club interview from 12 min to 27 min some real gems take it in and learn
This is why I respect this man, because unlike other so call men in this world he has a thing he try to live by called honor and I think the world is lacking people that have a honor code and that the reason shit fuck up good echit code to live by.
WE LOVE U DD !!!!! \nENGINESHARK.COM
This nigga is a Harlem nigga so if you're not from n.y. or jersey most of what this nigga is saying is bullshit its a reason why he is in we t.v.
Typical sleazy,perverted, Hollywood Jews. Prop for Dame for standing up to him when everyone else bows. We get gangsta with our own and take shit from these devil's.
Dame dash is a legend truth love he stands for truth bless him and I stand with him. He should be the biggest mogul than jay z or other fake Money hungry dirty bastards
These jewels Dame dropping are truly priceless...he telling us the truth...so many ppl wouldn't dare to say what he did.
I doubt he knew everything that recently came out about Weinstein.  How you treat people definitely stands out pretty quick, but his discretions with these women was hidden.
Subscribed lets get dame back to the top again top dog ...to under dog ... back to top dog!
i dont understand people that dislike this vid???
That moment when you learn that Paris and France are two different places
Dame been sayn dope sh$& ; however, this sum of the most insightful wisdom he's ever said. ✊🏾
So why this scumbag jayz work with Harvey knowing what he knew?  Homie does anything for money?
smart answer by dame. he never dived into the main person but related to the lessons he is trying to push
Sit back and be cool😎....most importantly have INTEGRITY!!!
Dame chill\nTake this video down\nThey did prodigy \nNobody safe\nU talkin that pedo shit\nTake this vid down\n\nHarvey is in this position cuz he wants to be in this position
The power of restraint is true power. Love that dude!
Thank God for self awareness & problem solving skills. I always knew time would Favor Dame.
Please drop more videos...i would pay a subscription for this content daily
Thank you Mr. Dash for always sharing valuable insight
dame tells the truth. the truth is never popular or accepted by 99.999999999% of the people. Most people are scared of the truth. salute to dame for being his own man. extremely rare not just these days but throughout history
Your interviews are hella Turnt up Fam
Dame is Judah
The realest
Good shit dame !
💪💪💪🤘📐📐📐
Dame so misunderstood
Long live Dame Dash.
Dont trust any white person

DAME YOOU SHOULD MAKE A PODCAST
Wow Wow Wow
Love dames talk and swag..but we all saw that boxing match..he ain't puttin paws on anyone.
No outcry about Michael Jackson molesting young boys, now Weinstein happens.  Male bashing is gender-baiting.  High school guys molested by female teachers don't give a shit and physically strong enought to fight back unless they are pussies.  That is the truth.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN DEF BANGED OUT JAY Z
Black rappers fuck anything that walks.  Booty.
Everyone pays for pussy, especially MARRIED MEN.
For everyone to know *this video is from 2012*
Storm Ophelia just blew the roof of my local football (soccer) pitch!
All these celebrities that have been SOOO full of virtue were ALL complicit with the sexual deviancy of Holywood. They all knew what was going on and did nothing until someone else had the balls to speak up. Actors and musicians = Hypocrites! ...Golywood is DEAD to me now.
Number one on trending in UK is a fat pervert standing next to a road talking to two women........fantastic
There are actual atrocities being commited the world over and this bollocks makes the news. People actors and actresses couldnt be more full of shit.
Vid ends at 1:15 thank me in money.
Showbiz types hug.  It's insincere and means nothing. Hence the term air kiss.  If you think everyone who puts their arm around a  showbiz colleague actually likes them you're beyond naive.  I believe Weinstein's wife was present here too. This clip invites the usual suspects falling over themselves to suggest this exchange is meaningful in any way and we get the usual misogynistic epithets being so casually expressed. Depressing stuff.
if body language is anything to go by shes incredibly aroused &displaying sexual interest in a) Weinstein.. or b) the tall black bodyguard behind him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor her sake i hope its the bodyguard :/
Alot more harvey shitstains still out there, they must be pulling some serious favours with the media tycoon's, who of course are also upto no good, so much for the media lmao,The  Lamestream Media's day's are numbered.
Must be true then I mean what’s not to believe when its coming from an ex junkie who was probably of her face at the time.
This video shows nothing incriminating, just Harvey looking like a creepy old man
FFS SHE IS LITERALLY SMILING AND LAUGHING WHAT IS WRONG IN THAT OMG IT WAS IN 2012 TOOOOOO
The only reason an attractive woman would ever touch or flirt with a fat and disgusting man is if she's after his money.\n\n\n\nI know this from experience.
Paedophile who travelled from Southall to Slough to meet a 13 year old girl is caught...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqD2CDI84z8
HARVEY THE DOUCHEBAG GOT AWAY WITH ALL THIS STUFF FOR SO LONG. I BET HE SAID SOMETHING TO UPSET THE ZIONISTS WHO CONTROL HOLLYWOOD SO THEY HAVE EXPOSED HIM TO RUIN HIM. WHAT GOES AOUND COMES AROUND, THATS JUSTICE. HE WAS SCREWING PEOPLE THAT DIDNT WANT IT, NOW HE IS GETTING SCREWED AND DOESNT WANT IT
Why is this on trending if it was uploaded over 5 years ago?
GUYS THIS VID IS FROM 2012
This is fucking old I'm Suprised That this is Trending
A lot of women gained their fame by being nice.. their Masters didn't mean it would be a 1 time deal though.\n#GoodOleDays
OMG fuck off with this shit it's all over the news we don't need it to be trending we get it! he's a bad person! sick of hearing about this guy.
How is this 1st in trending
He’s good \nBut he’s not quite jimmy savile
Yeah but when was this?
Any context? When was this filmed?
Okay this guy abused his power no doubt but got laugh at the sluts who willingly gave him what he wanted to not risk damaging their career. Obviously their dignity and self respect went out the window with some of them

HONESTLY YOUTUBE WTF IS THIS ON NUMBER ONE TRENDING
Woah. A video on trending that has nothing to do with Anti Trump
THIS WAS FUCKING 2012, SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW BACK THEN!!!
*The shit youtube make trending...*
I don't condone sexual abuse in any form, but why do all these women attack him now? Seems so opportunistic, he is a bag of dung well and truly but really are they any better than him for keeping this a secret for so long?
Harvey Weinstein may be an asshole but all those hollywood actresses are just lying fakes. They literally whore themselves for a role.\nOf course not they act all outraged on twitter because the dude served his purpose.\n\nFAKE WHORES.
Hollywood whores will suck a small, circumcised kike cock for a role but cry rape when it suits them.\n\nHarvey Cum Shot for the Plant Pot Weinstein did nothing wrong even though he's a nasty kike.
Y’all know this clip is from 2012 right? Before any of Weinstein’s victims came out about any of the abuse? It’s really sad seeing all these people in the comments talking shit about Jessica, especially since it was BEFORE the allegations.
Have to be honest here, Jessica Chastain  is extremely over-rated as an actress & for a shit actress she is in so many big budget Hollywood films & as the open secrets in Hollywood are coming out on a daily basis, I can see how she has been cast in so many films, the mattress on her back helps, hence the uninvited hug for Weinstein.
God, Jessica is all bullshit, she's so hypocrite. My respect for courtney, she has the face of I don't wanna be here . But in the end of the day, she was there, so, her fault too.
It's easy with all the women claim to be molested by Weinstein: you fuck me, you make me famous. That was the deal. Now they feel regret and claim sexual abuse. Gimme a fucking break. I hope the entire dregs get pulled up. Destroy Hollywood
Looks like he’s landed a 4some by promising lead roles for all of them #mogulpaedophile
why the hell 5 yo video is trending? wtf, YT broken again/still?

SO THIS IS WHITE PRIVILEGE NO ARREST AND IS ALOUD TO GO TO CLINIC HE SHOULD BE ON REMAND IN JAIL WTF SO MANY HAVE COME FORWARD AND WHAT...I CAN GUESS HIS BACKGROUND ITS NEXT TOO PALESTINE THE WORLD CAN SEE YOU...THE RIDE WILL STOP YOU HAVE CAUSED TO MUCH TROUBLE SUPPORT IS FALLING LIKE THE WALLS OF JERICHO...IN MY OPINION
Pot calling the kettle black these dirty Hollywood perverts don't no if they are coming or going.that also includes these actresses coming forward where were you when he first did somthing why not go to the police like a normal person. You chose not to because you sold your self . Now when your other pervert masters have gone sour with Weinstein they have asked all the perverted actresses to step in all the same thing a bunch of dirty sexual preditors and hoes
I hate drump supporters they do shit like harvey weinstein did(rape women).. its cus of trumps attitude for women grab them by the pussy and how they can get away with this sh*t because they are rich. disgusting
video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.
0:54 - Damn that hug just screams desperation. So this basically proves most actresses prostitute themselves to rich producers just to get famous! \n\nHOLLYWOOD IS FULL OF GOLD DIGGING SLUTS JUST READY FOR THE CHANCE TO FUCK AND SUCK THEIR WAY TO THE TOP!

So that's how Jessica Chastian climbed up the hollywood ladder
Casting Couch baby
Gross. Harvey may have raped some women, but think about the hundreds actresses who whored themselves out for movie roles and fame. Hollywood is so disgusting.

wtf why Gomez to starte the game because of Gomez we can't win the game we have better player dannis, deloufae n Roberto to starte the game instaed of Gomez this is first time varvelde make mistake in the squad to lose the point I hope he won't make a mistake again in the next  many game to play otherwise barca derserve to win this match
I feel the commentators were trying way too hard to pronounce the player's names in a Spanish way.
its the death of football the ball is so light and fast the keeper cant see it you rarely see anything spectacular from keepers because the ball is so fast they only can block it by instinct \n90s produced amazing players in all positions now they try to benefit attackers and dribblers as much as possible but the real highlights belong in all parts of the game\n90s and early 2000 teams used to be a lot more complete but now football is dead because all they care about is goals
4.12 was that pronounced correctly? Xd
That last pass by Andre Gomes was really skillful. I wonder if he meant to bounce it on the ground
gotta say i love the commentators in this match!!

Deulofeu should be starting almost all matches right now along with Denis and Roberto. Rakitic should be benched imo and give Iniesta a rest often times. Andre Gomes should also play more against weaker teams to get more confidence and keep him going. He can improve.
Why cant this commentator pronounce their names correctly😂
These commentators are so shit.

IDIOTS..WHO HAD WORD.... I WANT TO BE IN TEAM WHERE RONALDO IS THAT FINISHESSS ALLLLLLL...... HAHAHAHAAAHAHAAA
Barca is different from Argentina. Messi isn't always good and nice to score and be a Messiah to carry his team from disappointment. It's just a simple thing, because Messi is human. He needs to be relaxed to have the best manner. At Barca, the players around can score without Messi, but Argentina can't. This makes me so sad and unhappy.\nHope Messi will always have the best emotional before every match! <3

I think we and our boys did great in charts. I have no idea why news articles like the one that was released would be written. The song is great, our boys worked hard, and the charts were great. BTOB also did great and there is no reason to compare the two groups dear media outlets. I know I am saying this without any basis, but this seems like Cube is jealous of our boys doing so well and is hurting both groups at the same time. And is using low ways to do that. I do not want to think that charts were compromised bec of Cube.. In any case, if our dear oppas read this WE LIGHTS THINK YOU DID A WONDERFUL JOB. Do not listen to haters, they do that bec they are jealous of your great work <3
*I wish they will wear their job uniform to perform at the stage of music charts!!It will be fun* HAHA

Hi❤Lights, firstly i feel so frustrated by CAN BE BETTER MV views because it increase so slow event tho i hv been streaming since day-1 on my PC,Tablet,Ipad and 2 iphones. So i try to upload 1 random video on my youtube account and i put it on unlisted mode,so nobody can views it without the link. Then i make playlist of that 1 video,i just let the video played up to 2/3 second and i keep on tapping my playlist video and jump/skip the video. And it works it does counted in just few second  i can get over 30views. So to get many views actually we all no need to play the video from start to finish. I  hope y'all can help me to spread this to others Light, so we can get 5M views by 22nd oct..because i deadly in need of #CELEBRATE dance practice ❤🙏🙇 \nSorry for my bad english,hopefully understandable😄

What is highlight their fandom name?!
Am I the only one to think that this song kinda sounds like Plz Don’t Be Sad? :/
View???????
In the original Japanese, Michelle was actually talking about Adam and Eve, and how they would have shared the first kiss.\n\nIf you look closely, the couple kissing in the shadows are actually Serena and Darien, since you can see you-know-who's iconic odango's. Presumably, Serena is imagining herself and her prince to be the iconic couple.
This is trending? what!?
I watched this expecting a meme. There was no meme. I just watched 37 seconds of anime. I hope you’re happy.
Why dis trending. I mean i love sailor moon but still...
why is this on trending ?
Why is this trending I thought this was going to be a meme or something
Brad....sounds like a fuck boi name
TRAPS
Wtf did i just watch
Shit
Wtf
This was 3 years ago wtf whys it trending smh
Why this trending
That's funny, I've never heard of a Brad that goes to our skeül
Yeah...........Brad............riiiiiiight lol
0:18 That looks like Serena and Darian then Brad lol
Damn how many cousins does she have?
Michelle:I wonder where he is today... *Looks to Amara*
The dub tried to make Michiru and Haruka's relationship as straight and non-homo as possible but I think they somehow ended up making it even gayer lmao
Wow, the dub was really brad.
This Brad boy does have a nice set of knockers tho
Haruka and Michiru tried so hard to hide their relationship in both languages for this season but the dub made it even less convincing. XD
Oh man, this translation is so stupid... Michiru was actually talking about Adam and Eve! I can't understand why they changed it...
Is brad also their cousin?
Michiru actually kisses someone. I've never seen Haruka or Michiru kiss before
Funny how Michelle looks a lot like Serena in that flashback, and Brad a lot like Darien
My sweet Har-Bread! Oops did I say bread? I meant brad...Sh-He's not my cousin because that's silly!\nThis is how I see this dub
Amara: /checks watch/ Well, would you look at the time... Its time for some good ol' Frick Fracking
I'm sure brad is closer than you think. XP 
They talk about this guy like he's dead. Maybe Amara secretly killed him so that he wouldn't be Michelle's cousin
Sounds like Michelle just ate a sandwich with a thick layer of sticky peanut butter on top.
'My sweet brad shouldn't that be My sweet cousin
IM HETEROSEXUAL I SWEAR
hahaha they're not even trying
I love Amara's laugh at the end xD it's like she's saying yeah..Brad's real... XD
Yeah, I wonder where Brad is now ;)
Brad must be her cousin, too.
Amara is laughing like: oh is that what you're calling me now?
More hunkier than Mike XD
Can anyone please tell me which episode this is please? I'm discussing the erasure of queer representation in the Cloverway dub of Sailor Moon for a project.
he's cheating on you with jessicaaa!
OH BRAD~
I guess Brad had a sex change
Brad? That's not how you spell Haruka!
It sounds like she's saying my sweet bread.
COUSINS INTENSIFY\n(yesssss my favorite clip, im so happy you uploaded it!!!)
You ever wonder where Brad went, Brad?
All know that was amara lol!
UH, why is Brad kissing Serena?
Neptune: My sweet Brad, I wonder where he is today…\nUranus: *scoffs\n\nYeah, Uranus knew she was bullshiting!
That moment when you come back to this video, and see 69 likes Kappa
I swear they are purposely making fun of their relationship ... In the dub 
Last I heard, Brad was dating Twilight Sparkle and got eaten by the Reapers or something
so in the past Michelle was wearing odangos too? and why does Brad looks like Mamoru?
We all knew where they went after this...
Who the fuck is Brad?  Is he another cousin of Amara's?  Just how many cousins does she have!?
(COUSIN MENTIONING INTENSIFIES)
Cute❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😹🌙🌙❤️❤️❤️🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
I know who Brad really is...
I thought in the original Japanese version instead of Micheal saying Brad I thought she was saying it was Amara.😂 Can't blame me, right?
Are you sure it was just a first kiss? More like first time in bed together since nobody has their first kiss naked...
see ya
Wonder where he is? While 'he' is smirking like crazy
Lol at that shadow actually being haruka/amara thank goodness were getting viz to be honest with it all
Brad looks like Mamoru, come to think of it brad it Mamoru !
No commit on this... u wouldn't like it
GAAAAYYY
I love the background misic. Giggity.
Haruka Tenou doesn't say 'see ya'.
Oh my sweet bread
I wonder where he is today? LOL Try two feet across from you, Michelle!
I'm loving these new songs, really glad I (eventually) pledged for their new album..I thought the whole idea of a Professionals without Steve was unthinkable up until pretty recent to be honest, but this new version has really won me over and I got to see them at Rebellion and they were fantastic!
Very, very good new song ! Very fresh !
I like this sound. Looking forward to getting the LP! Our band, FACE MONDAY, actually have quite a similar, gritty rock sound - you are very welcome to check it out on:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmP4K-Dnq68
Sounding brilliant cant wait for the album well done lads
Classic new Professionals song number 2 and Chris McCormick just seem to get into every good band nowadays but it's because he's a talented musician so I understand. The new singers voice does really grow on you after a while and I like gritty voice he has. Look forward to the album very much.
super titre
もういい加減流行りの何十年ぶりの再結成&アルバムやめようよ。\nやっぱりの内容だし、ピストルズはライドン以外はロックスターに成りたかった輩ばかりでパンクスピリットのかけらも無い。\n映画も何十年ぶりの続編が多いが要はアイデアが出尽くした感がある。\nネームバリューの方がオリジナル創るより楽に稼げる。\nテン年代から酷くなった。\nデフレパやガンズ、カルトのメンバーがゲスト参加自体最早パンクではない。\nnot punk
Never mind the bollocks... heeere's Cookie!!! :-)
Cracking tune.... :-) x
I wish my teacher did all this
That poor Hispanic kid
I like that he’s actually happy to be there.
Where’s there backpack man they lucky it’s \nLike they don’t got hw bc they don’t get to bring there backpack home give me that teacher!😂🤣

This was too koo

flips

Hi
h
😂
Good for you
1
I foresee a long successful career in the music industry for Harry 👍
I want him to continue acting. Dunkirk was so good.
Why does it feel like Harry Styles died and they’re doing a tribute to him???
Perfect is an understatement to describe Harry Styles 💙
He's so old now 😢😢😢😢
Before you read this comment, I just wanna let you know that it was written for every single directioner out there who r still supporting and believing the boys. Hopefully you all read it👇🏻\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf u r reading this comment..I just wanted to say thank u for being loyal to 1D and for not letting them down and for supporting them and waiting for them. You are the best ppl, please stay supportive and never stop believing. And hopefully u have a very good day💙
Gone solo so he has all the underage girls to himself
To be honest when he was in 1D I did not give 2 sh*ts about him but ever since he went solo i took notice of him and im a real fan of his music now :)
Obligatory Beatles comparison, they still curse pop acts with those things? Dear me.
So proud of our boy <3
he's so cheeky and mesmerizing, that's our bb ♥
He’s not that good at singing.
Harry and Mitch at 7:28 ❤️❤️ my ship of the year
He's got the slight lilt of an American accent....I'm not sure how to feel about this development...
I found this video ALMOST boring because I already know all the details of his career and all I wanted was the interview
HE IS SO FRICKING CUTEEEE
🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🙌🙌🙌🙌😁😁😁😁🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷 come soon!!!!
The old footage makes me a lil sad
This guy aged twice as fast as everyone else
I think its time we admit one direction will never be together as a band again. Sucks but its reality
They will never get back together again  💔 one direction is over
This literally makes me so sad
British/Irish
cutie
best video!!!!!
im crying help me
Haha they pulled down his pants 🤣
The hairline fits him really well tbh
Gay
Ugly
His hairline is already going :(
Somebody respond me this pls: is he officially out of 1D?
I really think being in one direction helped them and shaped them to became the great solo artist they all are now. 💕
I have to click stop and go away cause I know I will be cry.
I love you Harry from Bolivia 😍
I feel personally attacked by those This is Us clips
I watched 6:10-6:17 like 167 Times now?? I just love him so much
6:15 i can't handle his cuteness
*HE USED TO BE A BAKER* 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
He's always been my favorite. Love his voice and personality 🖤
This guy has a future......!
Harry I love you soooo much how matter you are , and I can't wait to meet you
How can anyone not love this guy? He's the BEST EVER!!!
They didn't need to rehash the One Direction story. Why not focus on more of his solo work
‘I like to duck and dive’ 😂😂
I'm so proud, I just want to cry honestly
When he's singing on the couch and his whole body moves because he's putting in so much heart😍❤❤
First time hearing their songs.  He sure looks like the Artful Dodger, Jack Wild.
His lips are the prettiest colors. \nHe's still figuring it out? Oh.. he's just so humble. He sings the best of all singers nowadays.
I got honesty, vulnerability, hope, conviction and passion for his craft. here's hoping Harry remains uncorrupted by success.
why im so affected with everything that is happening to to him and in every little thing that he does? 😭
When ypu start crying in the middle...while the playback plays and your thinking 'where has time gone?' 'Where are my boys....I want them back...' its so hard.
here it is. THE LOVE OF MY LIFE, MY SUNSHINE, MY MOON AND ALL OF MY STARS. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU HARRY
His voice is amazing.
10/10 SUCH a beautiful human oh my gawdddd
He's dad's taste for music is mine ❤️
6:17 my favourite part of the whole video 😍😍
That’s my baby ❤️❤️
Harry styles in One Direction is like Justin Timberlake in NSYNC! They were arguably the most famous one in the group by far!
He has such a beautiful soul
I'm so proud of him I'm crying
Harry styles is a legend
He's so down to earth, it's attractive
My god his voice is amazing
Very mature, some celebs can’t relate even tho they are older 🤷🏻‍♀️
He's always be my little boy, in my heart❤
I can't find the Only Angel live in the studio!! 😭😭😭
I still get a bit emotional seeing the X Factor moments. I'm so proud of how far he's come.
God i love him so much
Zayn is the real inspiration here. Remember
6:16 My heart just melts completely 😍😍😍😍😍 He's soooooo cute
I just fell even more in love with him. He’s so genuine and sweet and just an absolutely amazing artist TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS EVERYBODY PEACE OUT
Only Directioners know exactly what it feels like to be proud of someone like Harry, and be sad at the same time. lol #DirectionersAlways\nI hope and wait for a 1D reunion, but if it never happens we know that the guys are always together in ways and that 1D will always be a part of them as much as it is us. I'm always so proud of Harry, Niall, Louis, and Liam because they've always been supportive of 1D and never regretted any of it. They show such respect to 1D and its fans and that's so admirable. Even if they don't reunite, they still bring us amazing music.
It's just beautiful!!!!💚
The One Direction clips had me crying wtf😩😭😭😭 proud of my boys❤️
look how Russian police tries to stop this mad  man\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sgcDVIfoD0
oh my god it's my dad 😭💓
When I heard that x factor music....my heart......not again....... I cant😭😭
I'm only 23 I rolled my eyes so hard my head hearts.\nHARRY YOURE NOT 23 YOURE MY BABY SHUT UP
I am so grateful to have been able to see him this past week in Austin, he's so passionate about music and you can clearly see how much he loves what he does. Such an angel.
I love that he doesn't feel the need to put a label on his sexuality or put it in a box. People these days are so keen to labeling everything. I just think he's such a cool artistic guy.
So glad to call this man my idol
Really good interview simple, forward yet told engagingly.
dear god he's so charming
esse sotaque me mata
I'm crying.
6:16 ffs harry
:-(
MY BABY

love her accent
Przez ponad 6 lat miałam potworny trądzik, który spowodował tyle problemów z moją psychiką, że aż się wierzyć nie chce, że tylko pryszcze są w stanie wywołać tyle zamieszania. Najgorszy był okres gimnazjum, pamiętam jak jedna nauczycielka powiedziała mi, że muszę spróbować coś z tym zrobić, bo jest to naprawdę obrzydliwe. Szkoda, że nie wiedziała, że jestem już na dziesiątej terapii. Nie wiem dlaczego społeczeństwo dalej nie rozumie, że to jest choroba. Gdy widzieli mnie jak jem coś czekoladowego - mówili, że to przez to. Gdy widzieli mnie bez makijażu mówili, że powinnam chociaż trochę to ukryć podkładem. Gdy miałam podkład to mówili, że to jest obrzydliwe, że zakrywam moją prawdziwą twarz. Słyszałam wszystko - że się nie myje  i że mam grzyba na twarzy. Apogeum mojej nienawiści do siebie było w momencie gdy wchodząc do któregoś z kolei dermatolog pierwsze co usłyszałam to Pani nie wstyd z taką twarzą się pokazywać?. To słowa lekarza. LEKARZA.\n\nDzisiaj już nie mam trądziku, chociaż jak Ty boję się że on wróci. Ale do wszystkich osób, które też płaczą i wyją z powodu tej choroby chciałam tylko powiedzieć, żebyście nie przejmowali się tymi ignorantami, którzy rzucają w Waszą stronę obelgi i hejty. Wasz trądzik minie, a oni już na zawsze będą debilami.
Thank you for making this. The emotional toll that acne has on a person is never talked about, but it's so real.
exactly what i feel like, love it
Accutane does save lives
Królowa polskiej kinematografii. Gdybym tylko mogła pójść do przeklętego heliosa i obejrzeć tak wartościowe dzieło (i tu nie przesadzam) jak Twoje, byłabym w siódmym niebie. Jestem z Twoim kanałem od samego początku i niesamowite jest to jak od tego czasu urosłaś. Szok. Niedowierzanie. Gratulacja. ❤️ ps. jakiego programu do montowania użyłaś? :)
I had acne for such a long time and when my sis finally had acne I told her everything I knew. At first she shrugged it off but now she’s finally tried to listen to me. I hope ppl with acne know everything will be okay once you try to actually work out on your acne issue.
I'm crying on the end. And yas, I have this terrible shit on my face. And sorry for my bad english
so true... it is all about me. my hormonal acne is getting worse but i don't lose hope :)
it was about 3 years ago when on my face some spots started to appear..from that period acne started growing and growing, faster and faster, until last year, when i couldn't go to bed and sleep because my acne was burning my face and i was constantly as red as hell. it was terrible. i prayed my mom to take me to the dermatologist, who gave me pills and a creme that i still uss today. all that i want to say is that if you're reading this, and you have acne, just live you're live, because it will get out slowly or not. wear makeup if you want to, it will not ruin you're skin more (just don't wear too cheap fondation, try the ones specifically for acne ir the ones without silicons). if you're reading this and you don't have acne, don't bully, it's not worth it. imagine being in the situation of your victim. don't be dumb, people don't have severous acne because they don't wash their faces or because the don't eat that healthy. think about it.\nbtw you are beautiful, and do not suffermate too much on your skin, think about what's behind it, it's what is inside you that make you beautiful♡\n(sorry for the bad english, italian's struggles eheh)
To prawda. Tylko ci co mieli/mają trądzik są w stanie zrozumieć. To nie jest tak że przyczyna jest tylko jedna... Tyle razy słyszę to przez to, że się malujesz (co z tego że używam do tego najlepszych kosmetyków na jakie mogę sb pozwolić, to nie ma znaczenia) - tylko to, że makeup to makeup... Słyszę to na porządku dziennym to przez makijaż ty w ogóle coś z tym robisz?, nie widać zmiany  albo boże ale wyglądasz, na twoim miejscu nigdzie bym nie wychodził/a - to najgorsze, co usłyszałam... A ja widzę zmiany czasem większe, czasem mniejsze. Miło by było usłyszeć, że widać, że mój trądzik się zmniejsza czy coś... Tylko trochę wsparcia czy mile słowo. Dzięki za ten filmik może ktoś zrozumie, że to coś więcej niż 'pryszcze'...
i have acne right now, all over my face. Im taking a medicines but for now it doesnt working. I look like a monster. i can't even sleep coz it hurts :( its the worst time in my life
Hey, I love your videos. You speaking about topics nobody else wants to talk about. Your videos are very nicely made. Your narration really helps me understand certain things and help me say I myself could not. The message of your videos are so important, thank you for making all those videos.
you literally explain what i went through and how i felt
The animation is sooo good and creative
I have been using this for a few months. I saw results after using!  Argan Rain Argan Oil  for my sensitive skin!
I hate when People tell me im wearing too much make up. They have no idea what im trying to hide underneath.
love from india  \n.. love your voice
I suffer with Rosacea much worse than Acne because its stated as untreatable skin condition imagine how I feel when I'm told there is no cure
this is how i feel
oh gosh you posted this at the exact right moment i needed it... My skin has been doing okay for quite some time now but a new pimple appeared recently and just won't go away and it's bringing my confidence down by a lot. Glad to see someone else putting down my feelings in words. (also damn good video)
A lot of animations are appearing on the trending page, so maybe this one can too.
I've had acne for the past 5 years, it's not as bad, but it still bothers me... Thank you for this video, it was amazingly made, I'm loving this style!!
Thank you for your open mind and that you show your empathy. Even just to know there's someone understanding you is letting you feel better. :) <3
I honestly do not understand anything but ... I NEED SUBTITLES IN SPANISH BECAUSE I KNOW I'M GOING TO LOVE ♡
I had severe acne and I related to this 100%. I was also poor and I had low self-esteem. But I had an opportunity to take accutane, although it cleared my skin to this day, it wrecked havoc mental health. I had severe mood swings so I cut it off early (which was really risky). It was a ride but I think I grew out of it. I used to hate my scars though, but now I've gained confidence enough to wear tank tops and swim shirtless if I want. Although I still feel a bit shy about it. I won't let it effect me as much as it used to. Thank you for this video.
I love your video.
You totally nailed it, in particular when you talk about what other people says. Hugs
Perfectly made animation 👍\nThat is exactly what I was thinking for over 10 years. It caused more serious injuries than only ugly skin. It is good that you said about it.
I love your voice..... and the animation (?) is so great!!
My life in a 4 minutes video🤔
Thank you for making this ❤️❤️❤️
THIS IS SO TRUE OML FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS IT!!
Love you so much <3 and thanks for this video. its super supportive.
I got inspired by your use of animation in your video to give it a shot myself. I struggle really bad with acne still but I try to not let it define me.
this is excellent content, and your voice is perfect.
I had acne for NINE YEARS.  It was cystic terrible hormonal acne.  I had the worst in the class at school. It was painful to touch and foundation was my best friend. I went vegan last year and I've been acne free two weeks after I started that diet. I will never go back to being Non vegan. What u put in ur body shows on ur face. Now when I tell people I had acne they laugh and can't believe it!
I never thought acne could be such a big deal to people. Very insightful
Twój głos jest tak cudowny💕 Mogłabym go słuchać bez przerwy😍
post notif squaddd. Love u babe

You never cease to amaze me Kasia!
Spanish :(
True😭
Amazing!!
Tez walcze z tradzikiem hmmm od 10 lat. Bylo zle. Bardzo zle. Dzisiaj troche lepiej, chociaz rodzina nadal widzi mnie jaka pryszczata gowniare. Ehhh, czasami mam wszystkiego naprawde dosc. Nie umiem na siebie patrzec. Wstydze sie sama siebie.
fucking true.....
you're lovely
Miałam jako pierwsza w klasie tradzik z powodu zbyt szybkiego dojrzewania. Wiekszosc osob mnie wysmiewala i upokarzala. Gdy po trzech latach brania lekow i utrzymywania diety mój tradzik nie pozostawił po sobie ani śladu moich głównych kolegów prześladowców dopadl właśnie bardzo surowy okres dojrzewania. Karma wraca :)
Dziękuje za ten film! Ludziom wydaje się, że trądzik to tylko problem natury kosmetycznej. Tak naprawdę największe zmiany są nie do zauważenia przez osoby z zewnątrz gdyż zachodzą w psychice. U mnie trądzik zawładnął całym moim życiem. Stało się to wręcz obsesją-ciagle myśle co mogę zrobić, czego nowego użyć żeby się tego pozbyć, może kolejna wizyta u innego dermatologa, albo kolejna dawka izoteku. Ciągle jakaś nadzieja, że „to na pewno pomoże” jednak okazuje się, że niestety nie. Zamknąłem się w sobie, mało co wychodzę z domu, nie mam najmniejszej ochoty żeby się gdziekolwiek pokazywać, a czasem nawet odechciewa mi się żyć. Ciągła presja wywierana przez media typu telewizja czy instagram gdzie wszystko jest idealne tylko pogłębia depresje. Gdy już muszę wyjść z domu to czuje na sobie spojrzenia ludzi. Podświadomie wiem, że są to zwyczajne spojrzenia, ale w mojej głowie przedstawia się to tak, jakby Ci ludzie patrzyli na mój problem i czuje się przez nich osaczony. To całkowicie zrujnowało moją pewność siebie a co najgorsze również w pewnym sensie zdrowie-czekoladę jadłem ostatni raz chyba 6 lat temu, bo jak zjem to może to pogorszy sytuacje itp. Urwałem przez to kontakty ze znajomymi i można powiedzieć, że na własne życzenie zostałem sam z problemem, który męczy mnie już 8 lat... I w taki oto sposób ja, jako osoba umarłem a żyje we mnie trądzik, czyli jakby druga osoba która przywłaszczyła sobie moje życie.
Nigdy nie miałam trądziku, ale miałam cerę w tragicznym stanie. Mimo dbania o nią, makijaż nie utrzymywał się dłużej niż godzinę. Makijaż wyglądał tak, jakby ktoś przejechał po twarzy mokrą ściereczką i mocno pocierał. Wstydziłam się, gdy ktoś na mnie patrzył. Na szczęście zaczęłam brać leki, kupiłam kosmetyki z wyższej półki, regularnie chodzę do kosmetyczki i w końcu moja twarz wygląda w miarę normalnie, wiem, jakie to ciężkie, gdy wstydzisz się patrzeć na siebie w lustrze.
That's an impressive start in a field of motion graphics, such clever solutions! May I know how much time it took you?
Zmagam się z trądzikiem już ponad 6 lat. Próbowałam wszystkiego. Zdecydowałam się nawet na kurację Aknenorminem, która była ostatnia deska ratunku. \nWszystko wydawało się super, trądzik znikał. I mimo że miałam wtedy spore problemy ze zdrowiem, byłam szczęśliwa, że się pozbede trądziku. \nJednak trzy miesiące po zakończeniu kuracji, wszystko zaczęło wracać... \nJa się już poddałam, bo nie mam siły i nerwów do dalszej walki...
Kilka miesięcy temu, pod filmem o izoteku pisałam, że zaczynam walczyć z problemem. Było tylko gorzej. Było strasznie. Kaszka przestała być kaszką... obecnie jestem po 8 miesiącach izoteku. Moja buzia jest piękna, odpukać. Ale to co przeżyłam... koszmar. Dziękuję za ten film. Niewiarygodne jak choroba działa na psychikę.. Bywało, że budziłam się co noc .. tak koło 3ciej i biegłam do lustra, by zobaczyć czy choć jeden zszedł... Wchodząc do tramwaju ukrywałam się za szalem licząc, że nikt na mnie nie patrzy.. mało tego. Oceniałam wszystkich siedzących obok, czy oni też mają problem czy nie... chyba czułam się SAMA z tym problemem, dlatego. Odwracałam twarz od ukochanego, by tylko na mnie nie patrzył - to bolało najbardziej.. i jego i mnie. Apogeum było w święta Bożego Narodzenia (2016). Każdy, na Boga, każdy przy wigilijnym stole życzył mi  i żeby Ci to zeszło z twarzy. Pierwszy raz usłyszałam tak bolesne życzenia. Oczywiście płakałam, ale pierwszy raz naprawdę chciałam, by się spełniły,a nie tylko przeleciały przez usta i uszy i poszły w niepamięć.
Najzabawniejsze jest to że trafiłam na twój kanał nie wiedząc że jesteś polką i chyba przez 3. misiące oglądałam twoje filmy niczego nie świadoma. Świat jest mały:3
Katarzyna! Ciebie nie ma i nie ma na tym jutubie, ale jak już wrócisz to tak dojebiesz, że szczena opada! Jestem ogromną fanką Twoich kreacji <3 :D
nareszcie ktoś realistycznie podszedł do tego tematu. trądzik jest bardzo problematyczny bo nie dosyć że czujemy dyskomfort psychiczny to i fizyczny. cała bezradność w leczeniu oraz zakłopotanie w oczekiwaniach społeczeństwa jest uciążliwe. \n\nmam nadzieję że film trafi również do większego grona ludzi bez trądziku.
Zgadzam się, bardzo trudna choroba, która przez wiele lat nie pozwala ludziom być sobą. Szczególnie trudne dla chłopców, którzy już w żaden sposób tego nie ukryją. Izotek, jak nowe życie.
Mogłabym słuchać Twojego głosu godzinami 😊\nDziękuję Ci za ten film. Poruszasz tematy, które sporo ludzi ignoruje, dlatego tak bardzo lubię Twój kanał.\nPozdrawiam!
Nawet taka forma jest małym arcydziełem; to zaszczyt być Twoim patronem. ♥
Najgorzej jest odkryć trądzik przed ludźmi. Zawsze zakrywałam swój problem, zamiast go zwalczać. Dopiero gdy Pani dermatolog definitywnie zakazała mi nakładania makijażu, tak naprawdę rozpoczął się mój prawdziwy problem. Moje życie przewróciło się do góry nogami. Zakrywałam twarz włosami, chodziłam ze spuszczoną głową, nikomu nie patrzyłam w oczy, odizolowałam się od ludzi. Był to mój największy kompleks. Do tej pory, codziennie dbałam o to, aby przed wyjściem rano z domu wyglądać perfekcyjnie. A tu nagle ja i obrzydliwe, czerwone krosty na twarzy, widoczne z końca ulicy? Nie obyło się bez dnia bez płaczu, braku chęci do wstania z łóżka. Miałam nawet w planach odsunąć od siebie najbliższych, bo nie chciałam, by musieli patrzyć na moją odpychającą twarz i wstydzić się za takie straszydło. Dobrze jednak, że wybili mi to z głowy i przez całą, długą walkę, wełną wzlotów i upadków, wspierali. Z całego serca jestem im wdzięczna. Teraz pozostały tylko blizny, także najgorsze za mną.\nMasz rację. Ten, kto nigdy nie miał poważnego problemu z cerą, NIGDY tego nie zrozumie. Może gdy raz rano namaluje sobie na całej twarzy czerwone kropki i będzie tak chodził cały dzień, chociaż odrobinę pojmie ten ból. Wzrok wszystkich na Ciebie i dociekanie pewnie myśli o mnie, jaka jestem ohydna. Nawet człowiek o mocnych nerwach, jak ja, wymięka.\nŻyczę powodzenia wszystkim, którzy walczą! Cierpliwości i duuuuużo siły. ❤
Od wielu lat zmagam się z trądzikiem i to chyba tym najgorszym - za słaby na poważną terapię, za mocny na leczenie zewnętrzne, punktowe. Nauczyłam się z nim żyć, przyzwyczaiłam, że to tak wygląda moja skóra, która nawet w najlepszej kondycji pokazuje swoje blizny. Każdy z nas ma jakieś problemy i musimy się jako społeczeństwo nauczyć, że obraz przedstawiany i kultowany  w mediach to nie jest norma do której wszyscy musimy zachłannie dążyć, aby być pełnowartościowymi.
Izotek to była najlepsza decyzja, jaką kiedykolwiek podjęłam
nigdy nie miałam poważnego trądziku, cieszylam się czystą skóra, niestety teraz polowa mojego czoła została wysypana ochydnym pryszczami, czuje się tak paskudnie i tak nieatrakcyjnie, boje się wychodzić z domu no bo jak to, ta idealna dziewczyna z idealną cerą a teraz jakieś syfy na czole? boje soe opinii ludzi i to cholernie soe boje.
Ja już 11 lat się borykam z trądzikiem. Powoli widać koniec. Dzięki Bogu. Ale już i tak nie jest tak jak kiedyś ;)
W tym filmie przekazalas dosłownie wszystko przez co przechodziłam i co chciałabym powiedzieć każdej osobie, która mnie/ nas nie rozumie, dziękuję ❤
bardzo podoba mi się montaż!
Jejku, nareszcie czuję, że ktoś to rozumie :') Mam trądzik od około 4kl podstawówki, a pamiętam, że już wcześniej pojawiły się często na mojej twarzy pojedyncze krostki. Byłam przez to gnębiona i nielubiana aż do końca podstawówki. Przez to zdazalo się, że specjalnie symulowalam chorobę, żeby nie iść do tego okropnego miejsca, pełnego osób z gładką cerą, które tego nie rozumiały. Dodam też, że nie miałam zbytnio przyjaciół, jedynie 2 dziewczyny z którymi była to bardziej relacja koleżeńska, więc nie miałam komu się wygadac. Rodzina również nie reagowala. Oprócz trądziku jestem niestety posiadaczką mocno przetłuszczającej się cery (z którą nadal się zmagam, mimo mocnego nawilżania twarzy) więc, z tego też zawsze mi dokuczali, a wiadomo, jako dziecko nic nie mogłam z tym zrobić, mimo że regularnie mylam twarz. Wracając, wcześniej jakoś sobie radziłam, ale w końcu w 6 klasie nie wytrzymalam i się będąc głupim dzieciakiem pocięłam się, czego nadal bardzo żałuje. Jednak nadal, zero reakcji, ale to i lepiej, nie chciałabym, żeby inni mieli kolejny powód do plotek. No, ale szybko zniknęło, problem załatwiony, jednak urazy z tej podstawówki zostały. Od zawsze byłam nieśmiała i bardzo nerwowa, a po tym wszystkim to się tylko pogłębiło. Naszczęście, poszłam potem do gimnazjum. Nowa klasa, nowe osoby, czysta karta. Mimo że wtedy się jeszcze nie malowałam ani nie dbalam o cerę, nigdy odkąd jestem w gimnazjum nie usłyszałam nic przykrego na ten temat, przynajmniej nie prosto w twarz. To serio poprawiło moją samoocene. Zaczęłam się otwierać na ludzi i byłam w stanie normalnie pójść do sklepu bez strachu, że ktoś się na mnie krzywo spojrzy przez trądzik. Obecnie jestem w 2 kl gimnazjum, nadal się zmagam z trądzikiem i wieloma bliznami po nim i mimo że się maluje, przez co nie widać tego aż tak, jestem w stanie wyjść np na miasto bez zakrywania go. Jednak mimo wszystko, zle wspomnienia zostają i zostaną pewnie juz na całe życie, przez co często mnie męczą przed spaniem. Więc z własnego doświadczenia powiem, że trądzik naprawdę potrafi doprowadzić do wielu urazów na psychice. Jest to naprawdę straszne, tym bardziej że jakby nie patrzeć jest to naturalna rzecz, na którą nie mamy wpływu. \nRozpisalam się i pewnie wszystko jest napisane chaotycznie, ale jakoś czułam potrzebę wygadania się, tym bardziej, że na yt jestem anonimowa. Pewnie nikogo to nie obchodzi, ale jesli ktoś dotrwał do końca to gratulacje, a wszystkim, z których się śmieją z tego powodu powiem jedno: olejcie ich, naprawdę, szkoda tylko czasu i nerwów. Pozdrawiam
Kolejny filmik jaki stworzyłaś, który jest cudowny!\nUwielbiam twoje prace i estetykę!
Świetny film, nie tylko pod względem wizualnym, ale też treści
Wspaniala animacja, widac ze wlozylas w nia mnostwo pracy, ale wole widziec ciebie w twoich filmach - masz wspaniala ekspresje
W końcu ktoś o tym powiedział! Sama mam trądzik, który co chwile wraca i bardzo utrudnia mi życie, czuję, że popadam w depresję, przy rozmowie nie umiem spojrzeć drugiej osobie prosto w oczy, nigdy nie wychodzę z domu bez makijażu, nawet gdy idę wyrzucić śmieci czy do sklepu pod blokiem. Po prostu nie umiem się przełamać, zamknęłam się na ludzi i najchętniej to tylko bym siedziała już zawsze w domu i nigdy nie wychodziła ze swojego łóżka, ale trzeba jakoś żyć. Trądzik to nie tylko parę pryszczy na krzyż, to choroba, która niesie ze sobą dużo złego oraz zostawia po sobie brzydkie ślady, które mogą być bardzo trudne do wyleczenia. Dziękuję Ci za ten film i życzę Ci, żebyś już nigdy nie musiała się martwić trądzikiem.
W 100 % się z tobą zgadzam. Niektórzy wytykają innym trądzik, śmieją się. My ludzie powinniśmy się wspierać, a nie złośliwie dołować innych. Ci co tak robią, muszą wiedzieć że karma wraca i ich może dotknąć ta sama złośliwość, lecz w innej kwestii.
Genialne oddanie to co niejednokrotnie czułam, wiele razy słyszałam i zgadzam się w 100%. Mam nadzieję, że każda osoba która zmaga się z tym problemem, odnajdzie w sobie siłę by z nim walczyć.
Tak, umiem sobie to wyobrazic. choruję na chorobę hashimoto. Masz racje Kat
fantastic video. also I really wish you made ASMR videos. Your voice is so triggering to me :D
Jestem dokładnie na tym samym etapie - kilka lat trądziku,leczenie różnymi maściami,antybiotykami... aż w końcu izotek,a aktualnie idealna cera i strach przed powrotem tego potworka:(
5 lat użerania sie,niska samoocena,nowy antybiotyk polepszenie,powrót,gorszy powrót o tak caly czas :D za tydzien znow jade i znow usłyszę ummm musimy wznowić kuracje,to tylko kolejny wysyp,placz i brak rezultatów,ale nie mam prawa byc smutna czy zakompleksiona bo inni MAJA GORZEJ :d!
Wow. Zupełnie inna i równie dobra forma !
Szacun za animacje! Kasia, Ty to masz za dużo tych asów w rękawie :)\nAfter Effects? :)
Kasiu, mam wrażenie, że wszystko to czego się dotykasz zamienia się w złoto. Uwielbiam Twoje prace. :)
Walczę z problemem już 10 lat. Brałam dwukrotnie izotek.
Well... I have this problem too ;-; Year of trying to fix my skin and finally, a few months ago I found a doctor who gave me appropriate medicine. And it's working! ^^ My parents promise me I'll get a piercing when I heal my skin soooo it's going to happend :3\nSorry, for bad English ;-; I'm from Poland
This video has done more flashes than Doublelift in WORLDS :-)
EU>NA
isnt it Guangzhou instead of Shanghai for quarters?
TSM is the most OVERRATED team of lol history. Their fanboys are seriously such a bunch of tards.
I love the part where TSM made it out of groups...\n\n\n\nOh wait
GAM :( the Best way to play LOL :(
OMG WESTDOOR DID NOT SOLO FAKER THERE FAKER COULD'VE KILLED WESTDOOR IF IT WERE'NT FOR THE INCOMING TP FROM SHEN AND SEJUANI
Very exciting games ahead. All the best to the teams in top8 !
3:03 doublelift saving flash for next worlds
Video did more flash than Doublelift did against Misfits.\n#FreeSM
Jesus this woman sounds so cheesy
>TSM\n>TSM Fan\n>*deep exasperated sigh*
This finals is going to be epic!  Misfits will battle through it all taking down the former world champions SKT and make it to the finals where they will meet the NA titans of C9 who shattered the hopes of Korea taking down the pre tournament favorites in LZ.  The finals between EU vs NA will be fierce between the powerhouse from EU in Misfits Gaming taking on the miracle runners in Cloud 9.  Let's see who will come out on top as the rematch from rift rivals carries on to determine the 2017 world champions.
Tbh the scariest group this year is SKT not because of all the other years or how they're known to be dominate in group stage but how they made those comebacks against EDG, not once but TWICE.
OMG 6 top seeds from LCS, LPL, LMS, GPL, TCL is out of Worlds 2017, this season has the worst meta and astounding from second and third seeds. Idk when Koreans meta collapses lol :(
Legend has it that dlift stil has his flash LUL \nIm done with tsm lets go c9 and fnatic
I thought QFs are in Guangzhou? Is it in Shanghai now?
EDG deserved to get knocked out, but it still hurts seeing them go out like that. SKT the Dream Crushers.
Last time i expect something from TSM
Quarter will  in Guangzhou , no Shanghai!
RING is second seed, not first\nQuarters are in Guangzhou, not in Shanghai
C9 go to Q with 3-3 without tierbreaker and G2 finished on 3rd place. They dont have even chance to play in TB. Ehh... C9 will be eliminated btw. so its useless spot.  Sorry NA, thats is true.
Na wins fungames like riftrivals and they all think they are gods\nBut than the worlds comes and you can see how bad they rly are\nAfter so much bad performances na should be a wildcard region haha
Quarterfinal is in guangzhou not shanghai and RNG is not chinese NO.1 seed
LETS GO C9!!!! I HOPE THEY WIN THIS ROUNDD!!!!! i dont know if they can win it all, but i hope they get out of this round :)))
when is the finale?
ShangHai??? You mean GuangZhou??? It should be Guangzhou Shanghai then Beijing...
Why does it seem like all the NA casters pronounce LongZhu as LongJew (even here)
Anyone remember when TSM said that they have an easiest group. Yeah, that the result
yes as expected of korean teams and yes no fans will be shouting tsm tsm hahaha
Releasing the power of evil lmao,
NA for the win
No more wildcards wasting our time at group stages. I love this year's World Championships
So how screwed is everyone's Pick 'Ems?
What's the song called? anyone now?
And if you give SKT an inch, they take a mile. The way she said those lines was pretty cringe,
Kalista thumbnail yet kalista has been banned 100% of the time
Legends says that doublelift flash still haven't being used
Best moment in grope stage for me was that 5 min nocturne ult. That was epic!!
This is why c9 is way better 😂 was a tsm fan
im from NA and is a shame to have trash. iboy and levi will replace tsm. if tsm is smart.
Factual error at around 1:25:\n\nShe says G2 took a game off of Chinas number ONE seed RNG, but RNG were Chinas SECOND seed. G2 were the first seed team in their group.
that very moment when the pick'em quest comes up during the  most random world stage of league of legends history...what am i supposed to choose??!!!!
You can read this whenever you want:\nTSM eliminated of groups.
I tho quater final was in guangzhou ????
Isn’t the quarterfinal takes place in Guangzhou?
The question i ask myself every worlds is how korea is so good, what special power do they hold 🤔
So its ganna be LZ vs SKT while im a SKT fan LZ having been playing really good. Idk man feels like LZ might win worlds but then again you can't just count out SKT they always seem to surprise you.
who is that girl ref and not joanne
Best of Five?  But I thought fans preferred best of ones?  Kappa
The only thing people are talking about is TSM. QUARTER FINALS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOUR STILL TALKING ABOUT TSM. Can't we just talk about the teams in the quarter finals?
Im so sad for G2, go to reddit and read Perkz twitlonger Post
Cody-Sun flash back hehe i see what you did there...
Quarter is in Guangzhou not Shanghai
the title is something doublelift never does
Isn't it Guangzhou?
Its not like doublelift would win the game with a flash, he would be the last man standing vs all enemy team
China's no.1 seed is EDG...
RNG wasn't China's first seed LOL it was EDG
I liked the editing at 4:22 when SKT landed on Blank Wolf and Faker. It was nice.
And nope again, Quaterfinals will be held in Guanzhou. How many rookie mistakes do you have to make? Do your homework!
Haha tsm fail again XD
Its Cheng Du actually……
final will be skt vs rng....
TrashSM, yes, it sounds good
RIP SSG
R.I.P TSM
Hardest pick'em in my life
GO KOREA! xD
RNG is LPL 2nd seed though
skt1 champs 2017
0:29 What? Long-Jew?
inb4 fnatic win worlds
Final is gonna be Longzhou vs RNG.
RNG is the second seed. RITO PLS
NINETEEN O SEVEN FENERBACHE NINETEEN O SEVEN FENERBACHE NINETEEN O SEVEN FENERBACHE
NA JAYCE
i love skt wolf. Hes cute ❤
LOL flash
Quarterfinals are in Guangzhou thanks.
Is that Froskurren ?
Rip misfits
Its GuangZhou not Shanghai ...
Love lol
TSM LUL
tsm should get a new jungler
thats a anoying voice wtf
Na first seed, Lpl first seed, Lms first seed, Eu first seed, first seed yeah sure, XD
Skt yet again, carried c9.
1:26 No, RNG were not the first seed from China, they were the second one. They lost to EDG in the LPL finals. If they were the first they could not even have been in the same group as G2.
I don't really like girl doing the commentary
It's not Shanghai, it's Shenzhen
Lz vs gam Biggest comeback of the tournament??.. nah its skt’s comeback..
Did someone in the other vid say that if TSM cant get out of the group stage, he'll kill himself, well whoever you are... just do it...
Westdoor's Fizz was laughable that game. Bringing 1-2 people 24/7 with you to kill Faker and call it 1on1  was cringy af.
Chinese Taiwan team, not Taiwanese team
Why TSM fans so quiet? 4Head
Wait, the quarter finals are in Guangzhou not Shanghai......Shanghai is for semi-finals!!!!!!
RNG Vs LZ final!
0:46 biggest Comeback, wtf? Have you ever Seen SKT vs EDG ?
She sounds amazing live 👍
Love Her! That voice! And she is awesome!
I'm usually not the biggest fan of pink but I absolutely love this performance. I love the energy the whole\nBand is giving off during the performance.\nIt's amazing. Makes you feel the emotion and want to be there. Kind of reminds me of being at a Celine Dion. The whole production and energy is just ridiculously good!
She doesn’t need auto tune to impress people, just by being naturally herself is enough to win over billions of hearts. She’s just pure amazing. A true inspiration. So much love for this woman. 💯❤️
I'm surprised they let her release this
I want to be her when I grow up. <3
Everytin she does is kl
Pink rocks!  Love how she interacts with her band.
Perfect song, awesome voice, crystal clear live singing & so many of real emotions...
What's most amazing to me about Pink is that since she blew up in 2000ish she has consistently had hits... That is almost unheard of
Plays on the radio more than I'd like but still brilliant.
Pink is amazing! Love the new album!!
Btw, anyone who agrees that Pink and Stevie Nicks would probably make an awesome duet? I would love to hear Stevie do 'Edge of seventeen' with Pink... *a girl can dream*
Come on pink your old stuff is much better, this is shite lol.
So happy she is back :D great vocals, good song and a nice outfit. Al together awesome
She is an incredible artist. I love her. She puts her heart so much in her music. I almost want to cry...
This song. Every time. So many feels. <3 P!nk!
Amazing voice, never a disappointment. Can't wait to see her next year in So Cal.
This woman is such a inspiring person \nLove her
She is and always true to herself. She is who she is, she is strong, she is a mother, she is a wife, she is a badass, she is so talented and she is what girls should aspire to be like!
I wanna see P!nk live so bad!
What about all the happy ever afters 😭😭
Please don't leave me, P!nk.
My god I love her. She has a powerhouse vocalistm she is a wonderful human being. She I'd bad ass. I am seeing her live in May and I fucking cant wait
She's always been great!
Fantastic, looks great, song is great, her singing is just amazing (has she always had such a good voice?) and she is gracious enough to give her backing singers their own “time”. Well done P!nk. \nI’ve seen her on Ellen’s talk show recently and she seems to be a really nice person to boot.
Cannot get enough of this amazing rendition. P!nk continues to fight the good fight. She is an artist who makes me feel it's worth spending my money on her music.
Amazing! 😍😍
Her hair is effortlessly amazing all the time.
I like Pink because she can sing WITHOUT auto tune, meaning she has actual talent. As far as what ANY singer or actor has to say politically, economically, or socially, don't care and don't want to hear it in any manner shape or form, any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
*_PINK IS THE BOMB!_*
My dream is to sing on that stage one day....
didnt know she was a Somalian pirate.
I know this is random but her guitarist back there looks just like Kristen Wiig! Lol and of course Pink is amazing as usual. 💓
Love her so much❤
Do a good deed today and click the link to my video to help me reach 10,000 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO8EnOeMrRI
god damn this song is annoying, they play it on the radio constantly
Can't believe this shit is popular, music and politics should stay separated
She kills it every time. She can't do any wrong in my book. She is amazing
Legit thought snl was about to make fun of pink and I was like how tf are u gon make fun of a great song
And I want that outfit!!!!
Pink is amazing all her songs are amazing LEGEND 💜💜💜
I don't like it when stars plagiarize the King MJ
I'm just back from holidays in Spain where I heard this for the first time and I'm obsessed with it by far my favorite pink song.
such a powerful voice and message! amazing..
God, I love that woman.
I just love this song! ❤️
She sang her fucking face off... bravo!!!!!
Such an amazing live singing voice in my opinion, a real breath of fresh air today, I've  been a huge fan of hers for many years and she never disappoints !! Can't wait to see her live at MSG next April !! U ROCK PINK and I LOVE YOU girl !!
The Magnificent  Pink . Loved that.
Beautiful!!
I like this song
Your amazing  I love you 💖. Such an inspiration.  You rock it everytime.  Adding to my playlist
She’s got a beautiful voice ❤️
Love Pink.

Slay queen SLAY!!!!!!🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Such an authentic heart.  😘
Whiney liberal anthem
You should sing opera, Pink.  Great band.
gawd almighty-- what a set of pipes.....does play an instrument?
A great singer and songwriter. Love her
Damn...I'm 33 and P!nk has been badass since I was in high school.
Is that her real voice ... Because wow.
Can't wait to see her in Abu Dhabi 2017 F1. X.
Beautiful song from a  beautiful lady,
Thats how you own the SNL stage. amazing
UMMMM... 😮 amazing performance...! I can't help but feel like there is a deeper meaning to her lyrics and she's talking about how we as global brothers and sisters have been lied to and deceived by the few elite who are actually in power... F U, ROTHSCHILD, ROCKEFELLER ZIONISTS BANKERS ETC!!
The way she interacted with her backing singers nearly brought a tear to my eye. What an authentic beautiful inspiring woman.
How does her voice just keep getting better?
I had no idea she was that good. Wow. Great band. Really great backup singers.
Love this amazing, freakishly talented lady. Saw her on tour in 2013 and hoping to see her again! I love the fact she sings LIVE, no auto tune BS!!!
P!nk is such a M!LF  #SNL43
If you want me to sub you just reply me I love helping people  out☺️☺️💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Incredible voice.
Speechless.
She sang the fuck out of What About Us! Powerful vocals!!! So happy she saved her voice and quit smoking amazing!
Real non fake pop star.
Beautiful  voice of an angel . Lovely   Gentle soul.  Sweet honest loving caring human humble \nI pray that no matter where you go in your life your ready for more of life's journey \nGod Bless you

Troy Deeney In Wenger Out
3 fake motherfuckers and a real person
Deeney might not be the most talented of footballers, but he is intelligent and has the right mentality that Arsenal lack. Keown also agrees indirectly that AFC lack cojones. Wenger out!
It’s interesting how people are praising Troy for berating a team that consistently do better than his, season in season out and have won far more trophies than his. If I was in Troy’s shoes, even if I think all what he’s saying (which is true) I would be careful what I say. I will just keep my head down and continue playing my game and leave this kind of talk to pundits and fans.
WRONG WRONG WRONG - low thinking skills - none should have been penalties - it's not about we have them against us so it's justified - tv evidence should be provided - stop this banter about Deaney and his ability to rile Arsenal, That wasn't a penalty it was a bad refereeing decision - TV EVIDENCE would have shown it - enough of the bullshit - its all opinions yet any neutral sees it and it's a dive.
thank you very much Troy deeney I respect you even though I'm an Arsenal fan thank you for saying how you feel.
Wow get the nee pads out for all the Deeney comments....
I'm seriously hoping everyone at arsenal watched this
Only Iwobi and Welbeck seem ready to fight for Arsenal
Well said Troy Deeney. Thanks for calling it what it is. Hopefully it will change something in the Arsenal players mentality, unlikely though. They are happy earning easy wages, with no pressure from the manager or board. We don’t to need to win the title or anything because we are already a money making machine, ain’t that right Stan?
Troy is eyeballing the pundit job better watch out Savage...
watching totenham's against real madrid made me realise how extremely below par Arsenal is, Arsenal is slowly becoming a Mid Table team right before our eyes
he has got a mug that you would not get tired of smacking, dissing the mighty arsenal like he is a world beater what has he ever won in his career giving it large let in 6 at city
Arsenal have no nuts? Looks like they need to sign a snickers in January.
He said the truth.\nArsenal is fucking shit this season!
Hats off to Deeney. Exposing Arsenal for the mercinary shithouses they are. I feel for the Arsenal fans, they deserve better than this for the money they pay every season.
Nonsense. What has his bravery done for Watford? They'll never finish above Arsenal despite their nuts
No english team, even the national, have 1 cojon at least
Fook me that boy is ugly bless him, slagging off arsenal, just a run ov the mill prem player, never never never get in arsenals team
always a blue nose!
Troy Deeney speaks sense and is so honest about what he brings to the table, England need more players him
ya still a sack of shit deeney, I'd rather have titus bramble play in your position
I am an arsenal fan and I totally agree with Troy he is so right
Overweight  Troy Deeney what a tube that's why he's still with a bucket team the cunt dived and cheated I blame the ref he should be punished it's time to punish refs for there stupid mistakes it's costing teams
Brilliant, someone should seriously look at Troy as a pundit whenever he chooses to retire.
Im an Arsenal fan and he's not wrong with anything he said about us.
who gives a fuck what a bloke called troy thinks...shit cunt
This guy also kicked an already unconscious guy in the head on a night out.
Is the guy in the ponytail a real person ? That voice with that hair with those clothes is a peculiar combination
When was the last time you finished in the top 4....or top 10?????
As an arsenal fan, this is sad to hear.
Man sounds like he has mucus in his throat😂😂
Omg get him on as a commentator!!! Never heard anything so real- us fans relate to guys like that- he needs to be on match of the with ian wright
Deeney says hes the man with no ego - come off it Mr self proclaimed hard man.. Also his ego has just told the arsenal defence how to play them in the return fixture...man before team
fucking humble bloke hes a perfect example for young footballers
Who is this guy?
Can't even hate on Deeney. My blood is Arsenal but he nailed everything. Better attitude than everyone apart of our damn club.\n\nI feel he has some love for Arsenal knowing how his son supports us - it's sad to know the reality of how poor things have become for us.
Hi, i am a new fifa 18 youtube gamer, fifa 18 and i'm trying to grow my youtube channel SUBSCRIBE! MY BIRTHDAY CAN I GET SOME SUBS PLEASE
Lol troy deeney jus told them brum style!!! Their not on it!
Way to go Troy......he is great inspiration in so many ways :)
He invited his prison friends and scored an own goal Last season
Arsenal fan but Deeney told it true. Props to him
Damn, this nigga fucked Arsenal hard. Fucking Arsenal man makes me have a heart attack every weekend
Troy is a smart guy.
Watford are doing a great job, everyone though they was going down. MARCO SILVA.#
state of savage's haircut
Respect to you Troy
Nice to see a footballer actually give a true opinion on something instead of a textbook answer. Refreshing to see!
Pillow bath European here defendant violence wave bitter down best so
How dare you Troy! Arsen just bought a packet of KPs.
If Troy Deeney can sit there and point out these flaws not long off the pitch, surely the Arsenal players themselves know that they've not got the grit or fight to ever win the league. I've never thought Wenger's failings were tactics, it's always been in his lack of mentality in leadership to incite a reaction out of his team.
is it jus me or is deeney speaking like an arsenal fan
i can just imagine Roy Keane in this arsenal team,he would be sent off every game for hitting his own team mates,this was a case of men against jelly babies
Arsenal is a failed state. They need aid and water and urgent  restructuring. But they are held captive by an evil dictator.  There's only one man who can save them.  Trump.
Big up to troy. Only if more footballers were like This!
Deeney just saying everything arsenal fans have known know for a while now
Can't even get mad it's true
Deeney a Watford player is finally the first player to say what all fans think about a modern day but mostly shitty arsenal back four
90% of the likes on this video i guarantee are from Gunners
I mean yeah they won but cmon acting like Watford beat arsenal all the time...1 win yet come end of season arsenal will be around the top Watford will be nowhere near it
I want a mouthful of egg fart
Since when do current players come on the show? This is great. Cojones
Derby will be remembered for his post match interview and never as a good footballer!🖕😊
Bolasie scores the winner against Arsenal, then trolls arsenal on twitter by saying hes going to enjoy arsenal fan tv, Troy deeney scores against arsenal then goes on National TV and says Arsenal dont have nuts and he loves playing against them, Arsenal have been hammered by big teams so much times that now even smaller teams like watford and palace want a piece too
such a normal bloody person not some marketable twat. big up deeney
Deeney isn’t even being a prick because he’s such a lovely guy. He’s a great leader and that’s clear.
Arsenal Wenger listening the boss?
Arsenal are fucking terrible
Robbie savage is a cunt!
What a lad
Troy needs a cameo on AFTV!
Troydinhi
Like an empty Asylum!!
DEEEENEEEEY
Troy Deeney looks like a bloated Drake!
not champion arsenal
Great from deeney here
Troy has cauliflower face
Mans not hot
Stfu Deeney ur trash.
well thought out guy
Big flattering ram

Deeney look like Shrek fam
Deeney for England makes pure sense
respect
SPOT. FUCKING. ON!
Hes right.. wenger no nuts but bananas, players no nuts but ananas.. upset man
DETIK DETIK SEBELUM MENINGGAL KIPER PERSELA CHOIRUL HUDA https://youtu.be/WvL6wpZQQQk
very honest interview!
Deeney for president
England captaincy please!!!!!
He’s excellent
Aii Deeney kept it real
Troy Deeney looking for Nuts 👀
Deeney needs to shut the Fuck up. His side got a gifted penalty and all of a sudden he's the guru of Arsenal futbol club.. this is a man who is starting on the bench for Watford, has never won shit and has never been good enough to play for a big club, let alone represent his country, now he's running his mouth about Arsenal and Ozil? Shut up mate.. !
Seriously though Troy Deeny plays for watford how can he be criticising arsenal like arsenal are bottom of the league? Jesus... talk about getting gassed..
loool man scores a goal afta 14 matches and thinks his the best in da leahue fukin watford bencher
this swollen drake needs to pipe down
Came here because of Dave's interview on Kimmel.
Wow this is gold right here.
That there is a prime example of a White Elephant gift lol
Colbert was pissed because he always has to be the center of attention no matter what. As a question or something. Be human Colbert damn it
Conan is boring. He comes across as full of himself. I don't understand the comments being so positive about him.  Oh well maybe it is me.
Only here for Conan.
So, I love Coco as much as the next guy, but how high would you say he is on here?
That is no joke the best Conan bit I have ever seen. Nice, man.
Letterman fucked Bill Hicks over. Nuff said about his character.  Sooo disappointed in you Stephen.
Why is he shaking like Kramer? 🤦‍♂️
I wanna cook breakfast shirtless for Conan
Who put this together ? *!!!!!* ROFL 😂😂😂
PICKLE RICK motherfucker!!!! Love you conan!!!
Tintin?
Conan is KING!! Colbert is garbage!
Conan is the king
Dave gave Conan the horse hoping it will poop all over the studio floor to get even with him for taking the Tonite Show years ago when Johnny Carson retired
Conan has become a hollywood dickhead.
He sounds like a cartoon character lmao
Conan on his son, love this guy.
Hollywood: where Serial Rapists (David Letterman) and Anti- Semites (Mel Gibson) are welcomed with open arms.\nShameful
conan is way less funny than he thinks he is... imo...
Watching Conan in the wild is the best!\nNEVER LAUGHED SO HARD THIS YEAR
Thanks for the spoiler in the title. Still an awesome clip!
The horse was supposed to have shit on the sets of your floor... And you had to return it back to dave.
to quote Coneys' dad I see you found a way to make a living from your disability I should be $o disabled!
Conan is practically interviewing himself. That ending was genius
Lmao at 2:35. Conan's getting into the story about Dave responding to Conan's tribute that he wrote and colbert interrupts like an idiot. You can see it in Conan's face like yes obviously Dave responded that's where I'm trying to go with this story that we've already pre rehearsed colbert is kinda ass
I dont get guests like me god
i've never laughed so hard at conan, but i guess i don't get to hear him talk so much on his show. when the music played at 9:23, i lost it
LOL at how they moved the interviews up on the playlist so people would bother to watch it on youtube. i mean i guess it is conan
A truck is too wide to get on the Warner Bros. lot !?\nHeheheh...   funny.
A joke from Letterman that went totally wrong lol
I love it when talk show hosts guest in other talk shows. It feels like a series crossover.
someone else tought it was funny how they fighting verbal about if they do call david latterman Dave or David Letterman...?
i love the story, but colbert can't give an interview to save his life.
Conan needs more smoke up his backside from the comments.
Conan should wear white shirts so his paleness is not as obvious
Conan and Bill Burr must host together their own talk show. It will fucking rule.
Hahaha love how Dave responded to this. Hope it will be an ongoing fun feud between them.
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth Conan
Conan is the best !!!
I love Conan so much<3
Was Conan high the whole time omg
If Conan dies, I'll be in my 40s or 50s, so maybe 20-30yrs later. I'll probably stop watching late night shows. I'll also probably spend some of my time reminiscing this man. I never love and admire American host as much as I love Conan O'brien.
fuck leno . Conan Rules
where  is  stephen ?
Conan has no equal
Ha! I love Dave!!
Dude this was better than Conans actual show
Hate Colbert, but had to watch this for the man Conan
Stephen: Do you have a farm???\nConan:No! I don't have a farm! Stephen you know me! 😂😂😂
They didn’t invite Andy because they knew it would had broken viewership records. People would had ordered cable just to see this interview. People would had lined up for days. I moved to NY just to meet Conan and he ended up moving right before I was going to go see him. Support my channel and maybe one day I will get notice by the great one. Who remembers how the big networks use to push his shows so late. That was messed up but yet he was the GOAT of all Talk Shows. #justnyc #teamcoco #folow #me #return2nyc #conan #cocnanobrian
and Dave's story was (as told by him to Jimmy Kimmel) - the horse was supposed to take a crap on Conan's stage, and Conan was supposed to send the horse back, and Dave gets his money back. Love these guys.
When Steve shakes Conan's hand I can just imagine conan saying something like I just keyed your car prick
Conan has never been nor will ever have much talent.
Apparently Letterman sent the horse so it could crap on Conan's show.... and he thought that he was gonna return it😂
Conan seems to have lost it and not lost it at the same time in this interview.
What's even funnier is the horse was suppose to just go on stage take a crap and leave. It was a big joke, but conan ended up keeping the horse.
I love this man, “I don’t get guests like me.” Lol
Please, sir, you've been drinking XD Right from the start.
Conan is the best! <3
CONAN IS A FUCKING LEGEND \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Watch the Jimmy Kimmel segment when Letterman is a guest and explains why he gave Conan a horse and what was supposed to happen.
i love conan but he sounds like he is on crack here
It feels so backward watching this. Conan is a far far far greater host them Colbert. Colbert is terrible lol.
YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN COLBERT !!!! THAT'S THE MAGIC !!!!!!! 4:27
I love Stephen Colbet, he's the original because you see he doesn't have a fake laugh compared to other host.
They need to give Fallon's job back to Conon.
Conon is funny as hell. One of the best!
This horse story is the best, LMAO!
Letterman NEEDS to be in the late show SOON! That would be amazing.
yeah-huh. a horse trailer would never fit on a studio lot!
I hadn't seen this until I heard Letterman talking about it on Kimmel's  Tuesday show. Friggin' hilarious. Dave had a specific purpose for that horse.
This is so weird seeing them together, my eye immediately went to Conen with the thought why is colbert on conan?
Dave is such a piece of shit
I remember when Letterman had his last show, Conan told people watching _his_ show to change the channel at the half hour mark and watch Letterman's show that night instead.
He looks like a carrot.
05:29 lol the look of that horse .... priceless xD
#teamcoco ftw
CONAN #1
wendys' burgers suck conan
dang stephen felt upstaged
Colbert isn't funny.
he is so overrated...
Wendy’s
Conan is the dudes dude.
Garbage show.
Conan yells through this whoie show :{\nStill my Fav!
cocaine
Conan > noblet
Fuck Jay Leno.
LMFAOOO OMFG I AM FUCKING CHOKING ON LAUGHTER HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH
The Mandarin without melanine...
Those 9 minutes felt like just 2 minutes
*girl screams* Please, sir, take a drink. Conan kills me with the little shit
Who else came back here from David Letterman on kimmel
How did I come across this garbage? A self proclaimed Red Headed Narcissistic King and a faggot with glasses who doesn't know shit about anything. Love to crack both of their sculls in two..
Talk show host - ception
Letterman rules! Colbert rules! Conan...not so much
Men tend to react with fight or flight and women with friend or freeze wow never heard a more sexist justification for false rape accusations against men where there's even video evidence she was into it while simultaneously blaming male victims by asking why they didn't fight or flight.
Richest duck in the world. You leave my boy McDuck out of this, fuckers
I agree with a Cracked video.  It's the end of the world.  Seriously, though.  This was a good video.  Very good points.
Tarantino came out and said he knew about it and he did nothing because he didn't take it as seriously as he should have. So I guess he wins a tasty Oreo mini.
Petty joke junction is just bad.  Bad.  None of those jokes landed, mostly due to their complete and total irrelevance.  As for Rose McGowan getting banned on Twitter, that's a non-story from the internet outrage machine of clickbait journalism.  She shared someone's personal details in a tweet, got banned for it, fixed the problem, got her account back.  Whether or not people were zealously policing her posts because of what she was saying is irrelevant, here, she broke a rule, fixed the problem, got her tweeting powers back.  If journalists could find five minutes of integrity and investigate the gender, racial, political, or subject matter bias of those against whom the rules are actually applied, that would be a story, but until then, I just wish people would actually report complete facts, not just the pieces that suit their narrative.  Rose McGowan was tweeting about sexual harassment.  Rose McGowan got banned from Twitter.  That makes a better story than the complete truth, and it's not a lie.
Can you go back to making funny pop culture videos... This is just sub-par liberal media that others do much better. I'm left wing but you just seem angry and unfunny.
You know what...you are the problem.\n\nCracked... What a fucking pile of shit.\n\nMen are the problem? This is why the left keeps losing. This is why the left has become a stupid meme. It's no fucking secret that cracked became a liberal circle jerk a few years ago.\n\nI bet these youtube comments are just as cancerous as the comments on their articles too. \n\nIts  a Hollywood problem. Why? Because all of Hollywood knew, all of Hollywood kept quiet. \n\nWomen included.
He's fighting to be the biggest cuck on YouTube and is climbing the ranks fast.
He didn't leave the country, he's in Arizona (more to our shame).  Not as far to travel but still a great place to say you're  fixed after giving some quack tens of thousands of dollars.
OK even if it's a problem with #ALLMEN, shouldn't we at least be boycotting Hollywood?\nI'm betting most of you won't be doing that.
So, because an actor plays a badass with a gun *in a fiction product*, guns sell more and the violence culture is boosted? Sheess, next line will be videogames are making our children more violent... Remember, America: not the whole world is like America.
Cody, shave your face, button your shirt, wear a bow tie and look like a professional if you are trying to be one.  Otherwise you can’t expect anyone to respect you as one.
I would like to patreon some news as it has become one of my favorite shows and I want to keep it coming
ALL THESE FAKE JEWS STICK TOGETHER
I'm surprised at how many dislikes there are in this video and disgusted if I'm being honest like who the hell are these people
Best episode yet
Jimmy Saville.
its not my problem you fucking pleb
Do you know how easy it is to lie about being the victim of sexual harassment?
Pretty ridiculous to shit on Affleck for not playing the white knight and coming out against Weinstein. You want him to have publicly forced victims of abuse into an earlier confrontation with their abuser? How on earth could this be Affleck's prerogative? Say it and fix it! is an incredibly childish demand.
By the logic of the title All men are responsible for what another man does, so all white or all black people must be responsible for what their entire race does, or maybe all christians or muslims are responsible for others of their religion? MAYBE all women are responsible for each other as well, such as false accusations (not this case above), pregnancy, emotional support? \n\nRape is rape, forcible sexual fornication. Sexual Assault is as bad but not penetration. Again both are as bad so outside legal speak it does not matter how she worded it. He did horrible shit. But let's also not forget that people (not just women) but people lie about rape for many reasons, in this case I DO NOT think it is a lie at all but I'm saying we can't just take every accusation as 100% true, unfortunately this is why we need to prove it like any other crime. Because people can lie even about horrific shit like this.
I'm not going to be made to feel guilty because some man sexually harassed women. I don't feel guilty when a man stabs or shoots another person. Crimes should be punished accordingly but not everyone is the same.
There you happy now we made fun of wienstien, now can we please get back to trying to destroy Trump. Because Trump saying things about women is the same as Wienstien forcing his way into a women's home and violently fucking her in the hallway. The absolute state of the left.
I'd loooove to see this propagandist go do some on the ground reporting... like a news person. :p
Rose McGowan was silenced by twitter because she doxed someone by tweeting private email addresses. It doesn't discount the real story but it does feed into the argument idiots make by not discussing things that dont fall into (how true it may be) narrative..
Why pay for college when I can be lectured about how horrible all men are for free on  YouTube. 😒
ken doll had sex with a leggo.....holy shit
Wtf happened to Cracked. It's turned into utter dogshit. SJW, sexist nonsense. And this guy must be a self-hating piece of garbage. Anyone who believes that this is a problem with men as a whole is fucking retarded. It's not a male problem it's a HUMAN problem. \nAlso, fuck you. I hope you stay in your echo chamber of hate because it's what you deserve.  Keep hating things, it's what you far left do best. I hope you hate conservatives and Trump so much that you shrivel up and die. Fuck you. Pathetic scum.
Wait what's the 5th reaction to stressful actions. Or did I mis hear him saying there was 5.
The show is developing well and this is an extraordinary episode. Petty Joke Junction was a great idea.
more anti  male   garbage  from cracked
I figured out why Cracked's videos have been much shorter lately. Their production budget for Some News has ballooned from replacing all the mics they keep, righteously, dropping.
His own face just found out wot hes done.that is sum deep funny shit.in fact harvey shud use it as his defence
This is stupid bc he only judges males not females they both knew what was going on , so please don't say it's only ben's fault (or who ever's ).Where is beyonce or taylor swift or emma stone ?? What they are women so they aren't responsible for keeping quiet ?? And what about women's harassment  on others (women and men ) ?
We are pretty fucked (im from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷)
uh... stop the narrative of rose mcgowan being silenced by twitter for speaking out... she was silenced cause she released a personal phone number in a tweet...  which is against their TOS...
I wonder what he did  to be exposed , this is probably a shame ritual or they are trying to distract the masses from something..
That clickbait title. Yeah, I agree though. Money and power corrupt people and lead to abuse of the weak. This isn't a new idea.
Yes, it's a man problem because the vast majority of men rape women. OK, Cody. Maybe you should try comedy again because whatever this is, it isn't working.
I could do without petty joke junction, but I guess you guys are trying to bring back the comedy show part of this.
Beware of the wolf wearing the skin of a sheep..\nThese azzholes feign a higher intelligence, while propigating a toughter cage for us to escape. RIGHT NOW the DOJ is working on a whole new bundle of laws to turn flirting between teens illegal, as long as a cop sees it in a certain way. Look into the new laws being worked on. Bloomberg is reporting on it like it's a good thing, and this show is just as much of a DNC sect as they are..\n( -_-).. not like we have anywhere safe to run to.\nGood luck people : )
not a Hollywood problem yet every single example thought up outside of Hollywood was still in show-business. Clearly no pattern here. Nope, none at all. It's just menz. Ignore that he spent the entire video explaining that the only reason this was able to go on is because the industry punishes people who come forward. Clearly not an industry problem at all.
Great video and points of discussion. Thank you from a female. :)
Nah...its an asshole problem. Give any asshole power, they abuse it. Man or woman.
Black crime is a black problem. \n\nIf you're put off by this statement but think the video's title is fine, you're probably a moron. \n\nNB4: LoL look at teh trigured mankin If there's anything men love more than rape, it's being rhetorically lumped in with sleazeballs. Also manspreading.
Actually, Weinstein was banned for 12 hrs by Twitter because she posted a phone#, which is actually against their terms of use.
What's with the tie?
We're marching towards a future where we're increasingly disconnected and power is more and more consolidated into the hands of a few.  This will only get worse.  A good evolutionary strategy would be learning to like being raped by powerful men for economic/social favors.
If i want your opinion cracked, ill go back to 2009. The future is now old man
The whole of this subject aside... Your petty joke junction segment is really not funny!
Our new brief, hopefully one time segment, Shut the fuck up, develop empathy, read a book, and listen to a woman.\nBravo Cody and you whacky Cracked kids
Every time Cracked is doing a thing about toxic masculinity and all that shit, I'm very grateful that they're doing this good stuff with their purview.
huh this seems pretty bias i'm gonna go somewhere else
A men problem? You fucking dickhead. Ive never once raped, or assaulted a woman. Neither has any of my friends, brothers, uncles, father or grandfather. Piss off with your agenda.
I see the pathology of the new ceo is only putting leftists in trending again. Let's blame men, not evil people. When the right uses identity politics by blaming black people for crime or muslims for terrorism, we frown upon it and rightly so. But it's okay when leftists do it. Sexual assault doesn't happen because you're a man, it happens because you have an evil streak resulting from not being able to adapt yourself (even if biology is a factor) to society.
Its a power problem not a men problem you are fooling yourself if you think it wouldn't happen if women were in power
Do these terribly offendable boys honestly think anyone actually believes all men are bad and don't speak up and so on? No. You do not. So get off your soapbox. The problem is not enough do. Sorry you don't want to hear about it.  Do something or sit down and shut your mouths for once.
Why do I love Daniel O'Brien, yet hate Cody Johnson?
As a man it makes me physically ill to be associated even by gender identity with vile, dishonest and sexually aggressive scum like this.  Its not complicated, stop for a second and imagine if someone was going to do to your mother or sister or daughter what you are about to do, then if you think it would make you outraged don't f**king do it.
The 'rape culture' thing sounds suspiciously to me like the modern day equivalent of this..\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria
It’s a Zionist problem.
1. I live in Santa Rosa and have a penis. The entire thing was my fault.\n\n2. Hollywood needs an OSHA. Rapey keyholders need an agency dedicated to stopping them.\n\n3. The bro clubs in nearly every industry are supported by women who look up to them. (Envy them?)\n\n4. Wait a minute...is the entertainment industry a modern day Catholic Church?\n\n5. Yes, one should be proud to eat pussy.\n\n6. Powerful rapists are confused by gold diggers, and it’s a circle I would never be a part of. I just...I just don’t know how to feel! I’ll just be angry and ashamed I guess.
Fuck Hollywood. Fuck Celebrities. Fuck Fox News. Fuck Trump. Fuck the Patriarchy. Mkay, think that about covers it.
4000 dislikes? I didn't know that were that many offended rapists subscribed to Cracked.
This newsperson is fucking awesome
Thereby tightly efficiency eoixkw deck accuracy spend combat.
i love petty joke junction
More like a jew problem. Amirite fellas?
This was trash
Petty Joke Junction ruined this video.
Does this guy shower?
Bro...this was everything
Pretty disgraceful gender stereotyping
Harvey Weinstein.  Roman Polanski.  Woody Allen.
Rape
(((problem)))
Amen.
FAKE
Cracked is going all SWJ
🙌🏾
thank you.
Absolutely disgusting the lengths these Hollywood elites will go in order to defend their corrupt and crime ridden industry. Whoever is responsible for this apologism should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. Videos like these are the reason Hollywood needs to burn to the ground.
Stop saying men. Say sociopaths. What you're doing is the same as showing five black guys that robbed a house, then referencing them as a black problem.
Harvey Weinstein abused his power and sexually harrassed many young women but no, let's blame the men in general. \n\nLet's just paint all men as sexual harassers and that will make the world so much better. This is not a men problem, this is a screwed up person problem and painting it in this way is both disingenuous and dangerous.
Everyone saying Hey, why are you saying ALL men are like this? because it says so in the title, that's just false. The title reads: Why Weinstein isn't a Hollywood problem, it's a men problem. It does not say all men, just like it's not saying that everyone in Hollywood is a rapist. What the title and the point of the video is about is that there is a systemic thing in the culture of men in general which promotes this type of open secret behavior. Cracked gave multiple examples of many other times this open secret situation has happened outside of Hollywood. It's supposed to make you think about all the stuff that men let slide by other men that they really shouldn't. That's the point. Nobody is saying that you, or your son, or your husband is a rapist, pedophile or sexual assaulter. Learn to read.
How about mass chemical  castration? Then no more rape, or sexual assault. It's all guys fault. Let's just eliminate the problem. Besides girls can't sexual guys right, so let's just feminize the planet people. I Know might sound pretentious but when nobody believes what you say. You start to get a lil edgey with your words.
You look like a cardboard cutout of Ben Affleck got Dorian Grey'd daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn. That was such a devastating mic drop, the mic on my laptop, the mic on my gaming headset, and my Shure SM58 all stopped working for 24 hours.
It's funny, you weren't saying it was an everyone problem when fox news was found out to be hiding sexual assault but as soon as Hollywood is shown to be nasty you turn the blame on everyone.\n\nHypocritical.
I find it really pathetic how the channel will only like comments that are supportive of this video, what a spineless coward.
Because of reasons that have nothing to do with PATRIARCHY or FEMINISM,  rape is often an extraordinarily difficult crime to prove.  Often, it produces the same evidence as consensual sex, and if you shower, which is the first thing I'd want to do after being raped, that's the end of that.  If a man is prosecuted for raping a woman, the woman is going to called a liar, not only because of sexism, but also because when the evidence is the testimony of the alleged victim, that's the only way to mount a defense.  I'm not saying that  gender politics don't play a role in the proceedings, but the problems go even deeper.
Nice title, you dumb cunt how have you got a million subscribers?
the amount of downvotes this has kinda serves to prove your point that people really don't seem to give half a shit how many women are sexually assaulted by male celebs. its so sad and actually really really scary that more than 3k disliked a video with the message rape is bad
You lost me with whole don't look badass with a gun in a fictional movie part. It's art, we watch just as many action films in Canada as you do in the states, action films have nothing to do with gun violence. You sound like tipper gore protesting songs with swear words.
You're already blaming a whole group of people for a problem.  Hitler blamed a whole group of people.  Don't do that
One minute gender is a ‘vast spectrum’. The next, when lefties need to defend one of their own, it’s completely ‘binary’ and ALL MEN are culpable for the actions of one creep. It’s totally obvious how unprincipled the Left are. Do you think were idiots? And I’m sure the next time a Muslim (who shares a foundational text with all other Muslims) commits a crime you’ll be back to saying #notallmuslims. But for now let’s lump all men together as though they shared one mindset. We’re all would-be rapists, apparently.
Fuck you cracked you mangina simps
This is downright sexist
Every fucking guy in the comments section , just wait for few more years and people will be criminalised for just looking at woman. \nJust like how we are all comfortable with calling every old person who is kind to kids a paedophile.\nSociety really needs to get its shit  together .\nWe talk about equality between men and woman and yet none exists . You can’t just fucking pick and choose , it’s gotta be the good and the bad stuff. \nNot everyone may agree with me and It may not be the popular opinion but popular people are fucking dumb and that’s why it doesn’t really matter.\nNot sympathising with Weinstein here , he may be a total cunt . But, looking at the other side of the story here and speaking to every woman or guy who sucked a dick to get to the top to only call themselves a victim . \nEveryone wants to be victim but yet no one wants to blame themselves and take responsibility.\nSomehow hiding behind a fucking screen and closing your eyes and blindingly swiping yes on every  one on tinder is fine but try that in real life and you’ll get roasted ????\nDouble fucking standards!
Years there's been speculation of a large sexual deviant ring in hollywood, instead of going with that story, lets stick to disgusting sexist gender politics, keep people divided.
when I say men are trash, cody is not included

Diogo jota is incredible
Congrats from a Benfica fun you are going up \o/
As a portuguese is nice to see portuguese youngsters shinning on Wolves especially Jota..Wolves are going up for sure!
I hope we can keep Jota...
im a aston villa fan, well done wolves good game.
WOLVES AY WE🔶⚫️🐺
What a game, what a performance what a result! The wolves are going up! \n\n#COYW
You're team is far too good for the championship, definitely going up
We are to good for championship COYW🔶◼️🔶◼️
Absolutely battered them! Could have been 4 or 5 ! COYW
For the first time in ages, I watched a Wolves game and couldn't help but smile. It was like watching Brazil at times.
Signing Jota on a permanent is the most important part of the January tranny window !
39 on trending lol
Wolves squad is too good for the Championship, they will def lift the trophy in the end, can't wait to play in the Molineux in FIFA 19 ~~
Clicked like before the video began. Well done Wolves! Put these wannabees in their place.
Hi ho wolverhampton
Wolves aye we 🔶◾️🔶◾️

champions league football... here we come...
Leo bonatini was in saudi arabia before coming to england, he wasnt that good when he was in saudi. But Wolves, is he doing goot this season?
First time I've seen the new team.  I think we at last have a new Peter Broadbent in Reuben Neves - he doesn't waste a ball.
Should have been 4-0 if not for shitty refs.
DIRTY SCUMBAG HUTTON KICKED CAVILEIRO ALL OVER THE PARK AND WE ALSO HAD A STONEWALL PENO SHOUT. WE GOIN UP ANYHOW, C'MON ME BABIES ;-)
It was a scintillating performance with technical ability that tore villa apart... a long way to go but that has to be a bench mark performance which if way sustain will see us promoted  !! WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS FOOTBALL CLUB  - pride of the black country  😚😚😚
Wolves for the championship. I am a Villa fan and I have no problem in realising that wolves are just too good for this league. Then ran the game, we had no chance. That Jota guy was immense, he would just pick up the ball and instantly turn on are defenders. Looks like a mini Griezmann.\nEven though people were predicting Villa as champions, I honestly saw us as playoffs, I do think we will achieve this but it will be hard.\nI know this might sound weird, but I would love to see us, Wolves and Birmingham pack in the prem, because them the derbies would be in a league where they do belong.\nFair play Wolves, you are a lock for the championship, great team, great fans, great coach.\n\n#UTV\n#COTW
Could we get this without the fake after-the-event commentary? Someone who knows the players' names and can at least feign some interest?
The force is strong in these lads! 🔶⬛️🔶🔝
John terry is a bawbag
Nice one Wolves from a baggies fan 😀
Proud of these boys, ay we?
Well done wolves proud of you
I am a walves  fan we are going up this season don't think we're finished top second place I reckon and we are going to the Champions League bring on Barcelona and Real Madrid win them all
We will give City a run for their money
I knew it was 2-0 begore video probably because i went and watched it at the stadium #WolvesForever
WOLVES AY WE - who are ya who are ya , thought you were gona crash our party - COME ON WOLVES our time is coming
Portugies all players are so good in wolves club the club have so many skillful players thanks the club it makes portugies team better
Completely outplayed them this is our year 🐺🐺🐺
Great win guys can you check out my little boys football channel little superstar thank you
The commentator is great at stating the bleedin obvious isn't he? it's headed over.. it's...just wide. I know you have to tailor things to your audience but even your average Wolves fan can see that!
Good game, awful commentator, he barely even mentions any of the players names

Just the best football I've seen in a long long time and that includes Premier league and Champions league. Diogo Jota and Ruben Neves are world class players and the whole team is superb. Fantastic football and a wonderful time for Wolverhampton Wanderers FC and I love it
hahaha john terry you slimy slow has been

Second goal was handball surely. Deserved win though

My brothers and I used to play this but without the suits or vr or air conditioning
This is hilarious to witness.
I was waiting for that last part to happen

This is the most clever thing I've seen in a long while
Even just the suit is impressive. I hope all public virtual reality will have those suits in the near future. Also this is an impressive way to have interactive local multiplayer. Good job guys👏👏

Le grand barça
Que grande Messi ♡
Yo sabia el barca no iba a dejar ganar . Toma cholo pensaste que ibas a ganar
Resultado injusto, el Barca mereció ganar el partido :v
I don't support either team, but the whole shushing gesture towards opposing fans needs to stop in football. Why not show some class and run over to your own fans and embrace them for backing you, rather than stoop to the level of the average fan giving you verbal abuse for 90 minutes? The only time I can condone the shushing gesture is if racial bile is being aimed at players, that shit is NOT okay.
It was a great game nobody won nobody lost it was a Draw go barca go messi go team go
Velverde really trying to fuck up Gomes career placing him RM. C'mon man give him a first place as a CM. 2 shots.
Griezman was on a mission
The english comment u r looking for
Just an English comment passing through :P
Penaldo Tapinaldo Divenaldo is the worst player in the world
Good and fabulous match performances from every players of both the team.\nYet Stegen  - Awwwwww \nAf  a long time. Been an good match to watch.

Abajo el barsa
Parece enfadado Bojack Horseman
amo el festejo de suarez jajaja NACIONAL TE ESPERA CRACK
Terdggsgewrjd
Porquería de resumen: en que no viera el partido parece que sólo jugó el atlético. No sacaste más jugadas del Barça como el penalti a Messi. Dedícate a panadero, esto no es tu fuerte.
Piqué debería salir y pedir perdón a toda España, sería la única manera en que los pitos cesaran un poco, por que esto tiene pinta de que en cada provincia que vaya serán pitos y mas pitos
vaya puta mierda de miniatura un payaso provocando a la grada que inutil
Fue un buen partido
Si os gusta el cine os recomiendo este nuevo canal de YouTube!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Xi-e7i8lKOE
Like si quieres que Claudio bravo vuelva al barça
Seguí haciendo goles Luis, es lo que molesta parece.
Los dos equipos están masomenos al mismo nivel.. aunque al Barça le hacen más refuerzos..
Porque el Atlético no metio a alex hunter?
Buen video y buen partido 😊 sigue asi OMG me encanto like
TODO EL MUNDO QUE ESTA VIENDO ESTE VIDEO SE TIENE QUE SUSCRIBIR AL CANAL, DAR A LA CAMPANITA I DAR LIKE / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrvuaofJ68Y
Solo ponen las ocasiones del Atleti o que? Y la primera de Messi en el minuto 1?...
Cuidado que pega como cotto\nNo sé cómo llegué aquí
Fue un buen partido y el resultado lo vi mas o menos justo por lo que se vió, en los últimos minutos si hubiéramos aprovechado varias ocasiones de gol probablemente hubiéramos ganado el encuentro.
Que pena el barca estuvo a nada d ganar
Bonito partido 👌\n\nMuy buena segunda mitad del Barsa :D
Puto vampiro de mierda que se vaya a comer pollas el jugador mas guarro de la historia de la liga y hasta que no acabe la mafia de la liga con sus presidentes corruptos siempre recibira ayudas este mierda club
Vaya Criticas a la celebración\nA sido igual que Messi al bernabeu o Raúl al Camp nou\nCada uno celebra los goles como quiera
Miren a estos chavales jugar al fútbol https://youtu.be/nneL0I3l-dU
Cruz Azul y el barca están igual
VIVA ESPAÑA UNIDA!!! MUERTE A LOS SEPARATISTAS!!!\nY AUPA ATLETI!!!!!
Soy del Madrid y hubiera merecido que ganará  el barca  porque el Atleti es una mierda verlo jugar marca o algo y a la defensiva,eso no lo hace ni el Málaga xd
Suarez mandando a callar al atletico k payaso
Suárez es dios
Messi el mago ,,desaparecida buahahaha 😝🖕🏽
Common play torres at the start not as a sub.. Torres is really ruining whatever career he has left by staying at athletico.\nThe playing style of athletico doesn't suit torres a bit and that is destroying torres
Que grande Suárez mandando callar para darse un poco más de importancia por que actualmente no está entre los 20 mejores delanteros
Jaaajj Luis Suarez is a boss, shut the fuck up wanda
Como siempre el atletico es griezman y el portero y 9 mas
Man city are buying Messi
Atleti demostrando otra vez las sucias ratas que son. Su fútbol es de vergüenza y que la afición lo apoye es denigrante. Así NUNCA serán grandes. Que fútbol más SUCIO.
Fursbol,deporte de niñatos campeones en tirarse y fingir,de ultras,donde todo vale,piedes subirte a una valla con un nene de cuatro años a decir bobadas que encima de aplaudirte te sacan en el dia despues,donde once pisa praos de octava categoria reciben mas ayudas que auteticos campeones de otras disciplinas olimpicas,que ademas,al llegar los juegos y quedar cuartos a todos estos fursboleros que no empataron con nadie a nada en su miserable vida les parece un fracaso de la hostia guiados por esos iluminados del marca y del chiringuito,esos Hermel y Roncero,archi conocidos por sus exitos y conocimientos(e imparcialidad :) ).Si un deporte de mierda,con una inmensa mayoria de aficionados de mierda,con unos valores de mierda,para una sociedad que apesta a mierda.Eso sin mencionar lo ladrones y defraudadores que son,ni de los MILES de millones de euros que deben estos hijoputas a Hacienda(o sea,a todos)Un delirio,pero como por el fursbol la masa traga lo que sea,desde pagar un dineral por un partido de ful un lunes a las diez,hasta justificar lo injustificable(peleas de ultras,jugadores delincuentes,presidentes defraudadores )una joya el futbol,vamos...
Madre mía Griezmann...
Barsani hər halına sevirəm
AUPA ATLETI
00:53 si eso entraba ... 😱
Hala Madrid!!
Estos culerdos son un disco rallado,son tan aburridos que solo saben decir que Mezzi es el mejor de la historia,aunque empaten
El hándicap es real
Bien por Suarez callando a los españoles xd
El Farza tan sortudo como siempre 😂😂😂
A quien ace callar el payaso ese de suares es un empate y lo ace ni que ubiesen ganado la liga le falta mucho para acer callar que payasos por favor esos cules que payasos an sido siempre y son por eso tienen 5 champions y nosotros 12
Did anyone realize they changed the music Bc of copyright
I'm not Latino but I grew listening to Selena and she inspired a young black girl more than she'll ever know! I still cry when I listen to her music and watch her interviews--even the movie (the ending, I just lose it) , so much more life and love to give...a smile of a thousand suns...but her spirit carries on, through all of us. LEGENDS NEVER DIE...Muchas Gracias Reina!
I miss the 90s I love Selena
I shed a couple tears when I saw it at midnight before bed.Thank you to Google, especially to Perla, I saw the interview with Suzanne Quintanilla, just awesome. Love Selena forever!
Maya...Guurrrl. Can I get a hair routine/tutorial from ya??
im tired of calling my self salvi American, I'm just American
I'm so glad that everyone pronounced her name correctly. Some people say sehLEHnah instead of sehLEEnah. Thank y'all for keeping a little piece of me alive.
That black chick is not Latino she's black lol
THAT'S MY QUEEN!!!! SHES MY QUEEN😭😭😭😭
One of the students in my school worked on this. He works at google.
I loved Selena growing up because she was multi talented , she was kind, she was an intellectual and most of all because she looked like me. She had  native features and she had long black hair and brown skin, lets face it Latin American media doesn't promote people that look like Selena. Like Selena's sister Sister Suzette said  She wasn't A guerra.  because of Selena,  people who look like me have an amazing a beautiful person to look up to. Thank you for that Selena 😪❤🌹
Seeing the google doodle made my heart smile. Anything for Salinas ! Rest in peace, princess !
My heart went bidi bidi bom bom when I saw it and I cried tears of joy and happiness I love and miss Selena so much.
*I can eat a whole medium pizza by myself....I LOVE PIZZZA*
I wish I could see her a least once
I TOOK A PICTURE OF IT IN SCHOOL AND SENT IT TO EVERYONE I WAS SO HAPPY
I love how that doodle came out on my birthday!😭😍👏🏼
I watched the Selena movie when I was younger, I was sad to hear how she died
When I saw the doodle I couldn’t stop crying
I cried too while watching the google video!
thought I was the only one who cried when this came out 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
okay who is this Selena girl?!?!
IM MAD AT THE FACT THAT THEY DIDNT PLAY BIDI BIDI BOM BOM when they were watching the doodle , they played another cumbia like wtf
So sad...sing with the angelitos, mami. Sing your heart out. 🌹
To confirm something, there’s a difference between Hispanic and Latino
I was so happy watching the Google tribute before doing my homework and just seeing it pop-up in that moment, it brought me back to my childhood and how much I continue to love Selena #selenavive
I've always said Selena's name in Spanish so hearing them all say it in English bothered me the whole time😅😅
This was crazy i was reading about her in north to aztlan and i went on my phone and i saw this!!!!!! #rip 😢😢
Omg i just watched the full doodle and i started tearing up la reina de la cultura mexicana!
And there goes my mascara...😢😭
I'm Chilean and me and my dad love Selena. We watch her videos almost everyday, we really like her and still feel so sorry because she was killed so young. Gonna show my dad the doodle.
I completely started crying when I saw that the doodle even had the lipstick on the mic 😭❤️
I'm not fond to the Tex-Mex music, my heritage is South American, but also I am the only Hispanic at my office and seeing the Selena doodle on every screen at work filled me up with so much pride, them I played the song and I teared up. Lol
i was at computer class and im like SELENA IS ON GOOGLE AND I CRIED and rembre my mom told me that she was watching her on tv when she was 5 and just be happy and then when she died she cried
Selena will truly be forever miss that being said I hope Google does the same thing with Aaliyah
I freaking teared up when I saw it....
She had fantastic interview skills, like she never had a switch personality wise. You got the same person no matter the setting..
Selena Gomez was named after her. They are both Mexican-American and they are both from Texas.
I got all teary eyed and mushy when I saw it!!!!
When I saw it I also cried 😭
It took me 3 separate tries to watch the animation, I couldn't see through my tears. This is a beautiful tribute to the legendary Selena🌹
I was a mess when I saw it that day, and i am a mess all over again now.
It shouldn't be Latinas react, it should be all people react.
Omg she said Selena with an s just like the bumper guy from the movie :'D
I wasn't even alive when she was around, but just seeing the sheer emotion and passion and genuine sadness being projected by all these people really makes me feel it too, I cried. I did not know her when she was alive, but her music is and will always be inspirational, RIP Selena. A true legend.
my husband and I cried watching that google video!
Yesterday I wondered why Selena why she was on Goole doodle until my aunt told me today that it was the release of her first album
I was so happy when I saw this on Google. I've listened to her music all my life. At one point I think I had all of her CDs lol. Viva La Reina!, Siempre Selena
I saw this google doodle yesterday and I teared up that morning. I love her so much! I'm not even a Latina yet I still fell in love with her and her music. She has the ability and power to enchant anybody. I'm taking Spanish as a language class and her music made me want to keep learning so I can understand everything. I'm glad Google made this.
They even got the lipstick on the mic 😔 I love you Selena
i at school i cried lol
I remember growing up in a small town in Canada, where at the time there were probably like 10 hispanic adults. I remember going to school (elementary, grade 1) and one girl telling me that I couldn't play with them because my hair was black and not blonde like theirs, so i spent all my recess' alone in a corner of the playground because no one wanted to play with me. I remember crying myself to sleep, hating to the idea of having to be alone and ignored again the next day at school. Then one day on a Saturday, a tv show had a girl with black hair, beautiful and so talented, singing a song that i was loving, that uplifted everyone in the room. My mom bought her album and would play it for me all the time, eventually through watching/listening to Selena be confident in every way being who she was, made me feel better. One day, at school again we were having free time and the teacher turned on the radio, Selena started to play and the kids in the class started to dance and asked our teacher what she as saying, the teacher didnt know and she explained Selena is Hispanic/Latina and that she is speaking spanish, she asked me if I knew what she was saying and of course I did, i quickly translated (as best as i could) and suddenly the other kids started talking to me. I don't know, perhaps I was just a sensitive child but Selena really pulled me out of a tough situation, she made me feel like its okay to be me and in the end her music is what made others accept me for who I am. Definitely a legend.
My mom loves this singer and it really surprised me
It's celebrity day for our spirit week tomorrow, and I plan to be her. I'll never be able to ever be like her but I hope I do her well
Why do all these channels also feature Latinos? When it comes to talking/reacting to Selena?
Wow I'm glad they did a doodle of our queen  💖💖
AS AN MEXICAN AMERICAN WOMEN THIS MAKES ME FEEL SO PROUD SHE WAS SO TALENTED WE MISS HER SO MUCH GRACIAS GOOGLE❤️❤️
The google doodle made me so happy
I love this feature ! And I love google for and the amazing team of artists for creating this!
Did anyone elses google assist pop up im thr beginning. @Android Owners
Maldita Yolada. Pudrete perra!
Realy that make me cry
OMG I SAY PERO LIKE TOOOO
Yassssss
I teared up watching this amazing doodle ♥️✨✨
What I don't get is why they continue to use the term Mexican-American last time I checked America was a continent not a country. Mexicans ARE American, anyone born in the continent of America (Canada, U.S., Mexico, South America) are all American.
My Spanish teacher had everyone in the class open our computers, turn the volume all the way up, and play the doodle. It was like an unceasing hurricane of Bidi Bidi Bom Bom and it was great
Ashamed she got murdered at such a young age....Always in my heart Queen Selena😭💔💔🌹
I started crying when I saw it✨(reina)✨💥
bravo, well deserved selena!!
“Bidi bidi bom bom”💛😇🤧
It's a shame I didn't get to meet her 😭😭 but I freaking love this ❤❤😭
Did anyone notice the lipstick on the Mic she was singing in😊
Selena will always be my Queen <3
Selena was QUEEN...someone who will always always be in all our hearts forever...honestly if she was still here she would be far ahead of Beyoncé and all the other pop stars of this time.
Omg I’m only like 14 and I’ve been knowing about Selena since I was super little
selena is proof of the latino power she is a symbol of what we can achieve in the us.i still cry that we lost her to soon.
The best Google tribute ever!!!! Lo mas hermoso ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lmao if y’all are gonna preach “Latinx”, day latinxs instead of Latinos, butnof course Latinx doesn’t make sense.
I FUCKING LOVE THIS GOOGLE DOODLE 😂💛
Queen Selena 💗
Its a bustier 😂
CHANTEL IS LATINA\n\n\nSINCE WHEEEENNNN!?!?
😍😍😍😍
Everything for Selena's 👑👑👑👑
Aw😭❤
I cried omg
Siempre Selena!💜💜
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
SELENA MY QUEEN
Love Selena soooo much😍😍😍
Anything for Selena :)
Tears running down my face 😭
❤
my reaction was so joyful!!
CUTE!
My favorite is el chico del apartamento 512
¿Porque hay personas que le dicen Selina cuando se llama Selena?
I cried so hard 😭
why y’all got a black btch in the vid?

Can you guys recommend songs similar to this pls :). I LUV THIS SONG BTW!!!!
wait \nwait\nthat was jeonghan\nthAT WAS JEONGHAN IN THE BEGINNING?!
Everyone has demons.
WAIT WAIT WAIT! So Marvel is doing a psychological horror movie on the new X-Men? \n*Something tells me that is not going to end well
Pass. Having Majik in the movie caught the attention of my 17 year old self, but this isn't a movie I'd be interested in watching.
just seems like a horror film instead of...a marvel x-men film o.o
Please, please, please, let this film have an R-rating. That's the only way I see this film working
Marvel is making X-Men horror now? ._.
kids..maybe ur moms won't show u how duedue looks but here u can see a big ONE
it just give me some of Legion vibe! Seems cool! And btw can we have a season 2 for LEGION?
Is this really x men or just another horror movie?
Roses are Red clowns are near We'd all be safe if Harambe was here
Where's the wolverine tease?
Anyone else going to watch solely for aryia stark?
Watch this one though, web series Irishtown https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTMlNc4jZPo&t=43s
Can't wait to not see this.
I think they're taking it in a different direction, trying to stand out from the rest of superhero movies, which is consistent with what Fox has been doing in the last 3years with the X-Men franchise, and which gave us Deadpool, Legion, Logan and The Gifted...so let's just wait to see, because it might be great.
So... Is this a movie of mutants fighting against ghosts?
I have a feeling that moonstar will play a big part in this movie
I came here.cause I thought this was from logan
I have a feeling that they are captived by Transigen or The Reavers
Just watch; this is going to turn out to be _really_ good.
I wonder if anyone had to be sexually assaulted before getting a part in this movie?
Subscribed, hit the bell and gave a thumbs up! Thanks!
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
Tryna pull a M Night Shyamalan? Horror movie with a superhero movie? we'll just have to wait and see if it's any good
all I want is quicksilver
Can’t say I fully understood it but I like it.
Still don’t get it.
I see Jonathan from Stranger Things\nAlrighty
Wait what the same new mutants from the comics?????? I guess not
What the hell is this? This is not the New Mutants I was looking for.
If you were to copy the font of The Wall for your title, maybe don't play We don't need no education while you are presenting the title. Great trailer though, look forward to it.
Is that Bjork in the title pic? Lol.
Boring and cliche trailer.. the begininng was fine but they tried to much of shitty jumpscare.
I think education is the least of their worries now.
Illyana looks like she jumped out of the page; and that's the only things that looks remotely like the comic
Pink floyd...
A horror X-Men movie?
1:12 stranger thing vibe stranger thing guy
A horror x-men movie? I'm in.
The X-Men Franchise has quite literally now become the punk rock teenager that's purposely being rebellious and edgy just to gain their parents' attention because of how much they hate their popular siblings, but in turn have served to only anger their parents and lose society's respect for them.
Thought this was ninja turtles 3
*I really hope this bombs, and bombs spectacularly.*\nI grew up reading the New Mutants, as it was intended in the *superhero* based genre. And not some stupid horror slasher, with the these brilliantly, and lore rich characters just shoe horned in as the hook.\nFor all those millions who hate horror movies, who want see it, an awesome action packed movie, can be *watched and enjoyed by Everyone.* and not just the gore-lust-demographic.
wait what. I've never seen a horror by Marvel , this should be interesting
Ahh nice concept, they went out their comfort zone and took a risk. Will totally watch this and give a proper critique
Does anyone know who sang this version of another brick in the wall
R.I.P. kids who clicked on this thinking it was a new teenage mutant ninja turtle movie.
This looks more like a horror then an extension of the X-men.
This is not a hospital, it's a haunted house ......
My bet it's not actually ghosts but a psionic attack to break the kids so they can turn the kids into their perfect mutant weapons.
Popular movie most likely yes , good movie? no.
So from Logan a dramatic sad movie. To a superhero horror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI never thought the words superhero and horror would have been used together. I BLAME FOX FOR ALL THIS
They are ruining x men ever since gifted
Oh i thought this was X Men HAHAHAHA
I'm just waiting for that hugh jackman yell
I saw that girl out of game of thrones
Welp....not going to watch this
Education connection try it for free! That's what I heard
The new season for horror story looks great
what a twist?! X-men franchise with horror genre? i love both horror and superhero, and this thing combining those two
X-man or horror movie I don't understand
What?!
pink floyd..
Aaaaand Stranger Things.
C'moooooon Anya Taylor Joy nude, please!
Valar morghulis
was that.. noo.. smiley?
Silence... Scream and flickering dubstep sound....silence...Scream and flickering dubstep sound... silence..... no thanks.
To add on, I'm a little skeptical about the success of The New Mutants movie. I know nothing about the original comic but, if this is going to be an ongoing series (which, judging by the title it seems to be) then I don't see how the franchise will sell when the pilot is horror driven. Now I'm going to go out of my way and mention Harry Potter. The tone of that franchise went from light to dark. We've seen those characters go from innocent to remorseful. We had time to watch those characters grow and develop. When their darkest moments came, we were ready for it. This story however, starts from the darkest of the dark. Are we going to see these already dark characters become even more dark? Will we get any chance to laugh and grow with them? I don't really see how that would work on screen. Maybe The New Mutants franchise is something that isn't meant to be adapted for the screen. -If I'm wrong and the studios are somehow able to pull it off then cudos to them!
Xmen?
Demon bear
Demon Bear?!
WHERES WOLVERINEEEEE
Hmm horror film ?😌😌
Finally, some Magik love.
1:05 I see NoOne ...
Disliked after realizing it wasnt \nX-Men?
Hm interestingly crazy
SO LITTLE VISUALIZATION
Geesh, this documentary about conversion therapy institutions looks terrifying...
looks lame
Terrible trailer.
https://youtu.be/Uf_-kpUJ4m0
Arya 😍
Danielle Moonstar is beautiful.
We make R-rated Marvel films.\nReally? Let's make it horror then!
Is this a marvel horror movie?
this looks nothing like a marvel movie.....
So is the blonde chick magik or crystal (sorry not a new mutants fan)
I always knew Aria was a mutant 😍
Marvel is getting on the horror movie band wagon
Did I just see the girl who plays Arya Stark?
So... superheroes?  Sort of?  If you squint?\n\nI hope this isn't just a reaction to Logan's success as a gritty genre movie.  It seems like every time a dark, moody superhero film comes out, some suits get the idea that what gets asses in the seats is muted colors, depressing visuals, and violence.\n\nMan, if Marvel Studios were in charge of this I bet we'd at least have Warlock.  Crazy biomechanical mutant Groot guy!  Think of the visuals!  But, nah, Fox gives us... young adult horror movie thriller?
I'm confused, is this x-men?
are these the same mutants we would see in the xmen universe, i knwo theyre not the same characters but when they say mutants do they mean marvel mutants?
Cool how they're finding ways to keep things interesting with comic book movies. Hope to see X23 in New Mutants.
looks like it had nothing to do with x-men AT ALL.... and why you gotta make everything scary now. jeez 😝😒😕
good... but the mutants?
Why New Mutants Is Like Some Horror Movie..?? Can`t Understand The Subject..!!
Uhhhh the was no plot in this at all...
Marvel is about to get SCARY! 😱
Ummmm that’s not fair. Luke Evans destroyed my ovaries
Luke Evans.... One of the most gorgeous men on earth.. :O
Usher won usher always wins usher still as good as when he started

I seriously can't get over Luke's voice
LUKE EVANS IS THE SEXIEST. DONE DEAL. HOLY SHIT😍

WoW!!!
I'd pay good money for Usher to cover Marvin Gaye's hits.
O  M  G Luke Evans is amazing 😱😱💖💖💖💖👍👍👍👍
can someone list down the song they sang
The back up singers are look like a Filipino.
Names of the songs?
why does it seem that less and less of the Filharmonic are there every time?
Searching for sexiest male vocalist? His name is William Singe 😍
Usher sang circles around both of them, he didn’t even have to try that hard, his voice is the smoothest!! 🤗💞
What's the name of the last song
BTW these songs are smooth and shit but when it comes to sexy, yeah I don't think so
I love everyone voices.
😂😂😂😂😂
Luke I'm fading 😍😍😍💀🌹🌹💘💘
LUKE EVANS!!!!! o.O

Luke u r tall and handsome as hell

That was so fun to watch.... good show to u guys! Love u, keep up the good work!!!
Seriously brought a smile my to face when they busted out the Al Green =]

I'm sorry but Luke wins hands down then Usher and then the other guy
Ads in the middle of a video. Seriously YouTube?
Luke is so handsome and adorable And I just love him😍

Oh wow no one sings like gaston luke is on fire

Usher would have sung Nice & Slow... just saying
why they have to have the same intro to every single riff off??? can someone explain this??
i want a sexiest female vocalist riff off with Britney, Lana Del Ray and Ariana Grande
Luke Evans is gay. Just an FYI. He’s probably more interested in usher than you ladies
Usher won this for me all the way
What's the first song that James sing?
Bruh...somebody PLEASE get Matt Bomer on this!!
James can u like please SHUT UP we just want to hear usher and Luke sing together because their both so smooth!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n❤️💛💚💙💜💖😃🎤

Oh God, he is so damn good at telling stories!!
Turns into Walter White at 4:10
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.
Maybe the travel agent said 15 and hopeful Brian Cranston heard 50 xD
Who else read the title as Bryan Cranston Got Caught Having A Sex Tunnel In The Alps
Anyone else notice Colin Farrell has his Fantastic Beasts haircut? I hope he comes back, he was one of the best parts (Much better than Johnny Depp).
Hitman really let himself go
He reverted back to the hilarious Hal from Malcolm in the Middle days
i like how he is pants in america but says trousers in the uk..
Wow his story telling skills are great.
0:01 That's an odd way to turn your head Colin
I was like 'how did he have sex whilst driving his car?'  Oh it was a train.
How many marriages reach reach 29-30 years these days?
Colin Farrell: Hold my beer.
Just how?
hasn't the guy got any shame? if I caught someone exposing themselves in front of my kids, I'd beat the granny out of them.
I'd love to see Bryan and Colin in a movie together
Best story teller ever! love him!
I could listen to Bryan tell this stories for ages!! XD
He is a great story teller!
What a legend celebrity of our times a one worthy of celebrity title
This story sounds like something that Hal and Louis will experience.
47s put on the beef
easier with woman on top in car

he Awesome in Malcolm in the middle...
He's a master story teller
Absolutely love the man!
god this man is funny
This is the most ridiculous awesome story everrr LMAO!
Bryan Cranston is just such a great guy! Comedic, theatrical and plain nice.
How can you not love Bryan Cranston
That was a really good train noise
I’m just seeing and hearing Hal
I knew it! Bryan is that stranger in the alps John Goodman mentioned in the TV edit in The Big Lebowski.
Cranston always tells the best stories. Had Cumberbatch and Redmayne on the floor last time. That countdown to the sex tunnel was hilarious! 😂
been watching Graham Norton since V Graham norton on channel 4 , who remeber when Big Brovaz came on
So you could say, he found a stranger in the alps..
Bryan Who?
norton show best
Such a likeable guy.
Lol 15 minutes wasn't enough for him?
I'm I.T
Say my name
Should of have had him on the red chair!
What I love about ‘The Graham Norton!” The guest combinations , I came to see the guy from breaking bad , also got Nardole (Matt Lucas)
I'll take 15 minutes with Colin anywhere under any conditions.
Thank God for Collin's reactions lol
You know what would be funny, if we found out he had sex with an alp in a tunnel.
I would invite him to my party!
he told this story in a interview like a year ago
Tunnelling a tunnel in the tunnel.
Maybe the agent said 15 minutes, but he heard 50.
I Love You So Dam Much Graham Norton!
Hahah he’s so good at story telling 😂👌🏾
I can't stop laughing at his impression of italians 😂 so on point expecially the gesture at 3:59
Mute the sound. Bryant's visual action is more interesting and easy to understand lol
Bryan really knows how to tell a story. He is brilliant!!! :D
SEE WHAT HAPPENS\nWHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS
I can see the memes
Poor mans jonathon ross
best story teller, him and Chris Pratt
Colin’s hair looks awesome! Very 90s. I love it.
Bryan is not Walter white but he really hal
lol hes a natural...
Say no more. -Bryan Cranston 2017
me lol
Crystal!  ;)
Haha such a funny dude
Say no more 😂
Amazing story teller. Lol
I love him
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Great story. Xx
Amazing story :D
All hail Bryan Craston for this story XDXD
Awesome
Say no more fam.. 😂😂😂
What a weird story to tell lol didn't think he'd go into details lol god damn it Hal! Lois must've been mad
He is the one who knocks.Makes sense 😂😂
I love how he told this story word for word on Conan a couple months ago. Cranston you dirty dog
Colin Firth is HOOOOOT
HELP! PLEASE HELP ME GET TO 10,000 VIEWS WITH NO SUBS!!!
So night shows can talk about sex but invidual creators will get punished for it?
Recycled by Colbert interview.......
Or did his wife say stay out of my territory!
Ukh that farrell such a hillbilly... doesn't know how to act in public... go dig up some potatoes 🥔....
Must say ., Brian's 📓 makes a great *read., \n\nSadly, no bits @ v% 🌹🎦 event., or London specifically., wit 'Malcolm [ the Middle 📺🎬'. \n\nGlorious last line by moi Total *mC2F by Colin. 💙😎
This would have been an awesome if they hadn't had Bryan Cranston on the show. He is intolerable.
Bryan Cranston is a SOCIALIST LIBERAL QUACK who wants to DESECRATE places because he’s a LIBERAL and LIBERALS destroy everything and want to destroy a generation of proud Christian republicans like myself.\nNO TO SOCIALIST QUACKS\n\nTRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP
The Heisenberg part of Bryan's brain kicked in when he said Get Off Me
From his gestures and that cross that he made I can totally belive Colin is gay

SATANIC HOLLYWOOD
2000 views, clearly trending.
you look behind the catchphrases and there's nothing there. spot on.
That was fascinating. Find it a real relief to listen to someone who has their head screwed on about this.
That's Sir Starmer, QC, in reply to Her Majesty's Government, Warmongers LLC .. And limited they are.\n\nArdent Brexiters seem to think Democracy is the dictatorship of majority, or that a prerogative is a holy sanctity that mustn't be disturbed in any way. Well, it's not, rather a proper discussion towards consensus, which requires all parties to get off their high horses. Repeatedly shouting we decided and that's it! is not a democratic practice, in fact that's warmongering. Prolonging transition period  or another vote is not reversing Brexit or undemocratic -- in fact it's a common practice as many states and nations around the world review and re-vote decisions. And yes this practice is true had the opposite happened -- had Great Britain chosen to STAY in the EU its citizens should have been given another opportunity [to vote leave] in the future. These decisions go back and forth between the electorate, politicians, officials, etc.\n\nAnd that's DEMOCRACY. So shuffle the deck and play another round (i.e. talk on how to do a proper Brexit).\n\nVote-Talk-Resolve X 10000 times.
Trying to kick the can down the road.   Still face stark future post brexit.
Peston never used to act like that, Where's he got this exaggerated persona from, he seems to have flanderized himself.
Yawn!
It's disrespectful not to refer to him as Sir Keir. He is a knight after all.
Spot on as usual Kier. I can get used to reasonably detailed but straightforward answers.
Strange because Keir Starmer said on BBC's Daily Politics that if The Government chose to leave without a deal, The Labour Party would vote to keep us in The EU. The talks should have been trade based instead of firstly focusing on Citizens Rights, The ECJ and Divorce Bills. I, like many others, voted to leave and if this is stopped for any reason, then democracy is dead.
All political parties continue to sell the message that there are only 2 options,\n1. Get a good deal. \n2. Leave without a deal. \nBut there is clearly a third option, \n3. To stop Brexit now and then negotiate with the EU from inside the EU club backed by a strong leave mandate. \n\nThe precipitous lodging by the May government of the Article 40 notice was clearly aimed at solving internal party problems with no real consideration given to the interests of the UK or the EU.\nAt the same time the opposition parties allowed the Article 40 notice to proceed without a great deal of opposition or question for fear of losing support from Leave or Remain voters. \n\nThis was and is the state of the political process in our parliament, which has lead a government with no clear mandate to enter UK/EU negotiations in an unplanned, uncoordinated and unduly optimistic fashion. \n\nThe present state of the negotiation is now generally accepted to be unlikely to result in a beneficial outcome for anyone. At the same time our parliament is more divided than ever and the political parties continue to follow a path which could lead to the breakup of the UK and the destruction of our democracy.\n\nWe (the voters) need to save our country from our political parties and our political parties from themselves.\n\nTo this end we ask our Members of Parliament to put aside party loyalties and Pledge to serve all our people in a Unified Cross/Party National Government mandated to stop Brexit now.\nhttp://www.fvvra.org/the-fvvra-pledge\n\nGordon Middleton\nFVVRA.ORG
how much do you have to pay google to be trending?
So, labour wants the ECJ to have some sort of hold over Britain.
Nowhere in Article 50 does it say 'With a view to a future agreement'!
We were told we would 100% get a deal and the EU would never restrict German manufacturers or French farmers from selling to us. A no deal is the worst possible deal.
Keir is an Agent of the EU.  Be careful Briton, many traitors about.
Establishment traitor.
The thinking man's comic book movie. Yeah, it's making me think about watching something else.
The way that they effectively take the piss out of not just Star Wars fans, but literally every single Internet-based modern trend (and the people that perpetuate that) ever is amazing. They are really good at it.
please don't stop making these, the parody is brilliant
Where did Mike find that -hideous fucking- very cool jacket?
I wonder if you wanted Disney to help you see the movies and you got so butt hurt you started this shit. Not really funny 😒
Is Rich Evans masturbating going to replace actual content?
I want to see a Rich Evans food review channel
Can we have the 30 minute clip of Rich fucking a Porg?
If that was a swipe at reviewbrah, I'm unsubscribing.
You guys are awesome, made my day :)
It's back again, everybody. It's back again until it's gone... and then it's back again.
Me personally I loved this episode.
Mike can use this as his NPR audition tape someday
11:30 - 12:20 I haven't laughed that hard in a while.  This is golden.
6:04 I'll try spinning! That's a neat trick!
Its got a name people!  Get ready for Star Wars SOLO! Thank you Ron Howard, mans a fucking genius.\n\nOr some could say that Ron Howard how could you go so low.
This is what it means to be alive.
8:16 - 10:19 is kind of genius.
I love that there's a police siren going off in the fake food review.
I feel like Chris Stuckman and those other movie reviewers should watch this series and get a fucking clue.
That humongous Kylon Ren in the back, the cups based on a trailer, the pile in the bottom right, the red eyed Vader... the best set of the series so far.
Rich, you give and you give, man
One of us... One of us... us of One...
Stay classy Rich Evans
Holy christ, I'm going to suffer a rectal prolapse I'm laughing so hard.
I wanna meet the 12 year old StarWars fan that watches these episodes and doesn't understand...
god rich evans makes me laugh non stop
So true about the dumb jocks being Star Wars fans.
Mike's suit cracked me up :DD Love you guys!
The joke is that it's redundant.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I would absolutely watch Rich eat that entire burger.
What a pile of mess
This came out days ago, and I just spent all night last night trying to sleep, haunted by Rich Evans saying in the house over and over again.
the joke is wearing thin. but I guess that's the point
Damn it, now I'm hungry...
That trailer reaction was one of the funniest things RLM has ever produced.
It aired during football because Disney owns ESPN and it is the only time people watch ESPN now.
That fuckin burger looks like a coronary in a box 🍔 📦
These guys just get it.
I'm sorry to say you should have waited a bit longer in order to analyse the Disney™ Han Solo™ Solo Film™ SOLO A Star Wars™ Story by Lucasfilm™ a Disney Company™
16:16 went too far into socialist thinking right there this is how people talked on tv in eastern europe back in the day
This is the best
I am crying watching this lulz\n\nPure comedy gold.
By far my favorite episode of The Nerd Crew.
12:01 Thankfully, I looked back at the screen just in time to see Mike sip from his porg mug with his pinky extended with that goofy look. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Thanos ᶦⁿ ᵈᵃ ʰᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵘˢᵉ
Funny because it's true.
I can't wait for their review of the last Jedi.
And don't forget about Poop Again Twooooooooo. Jack Packard in the hoooouse!
Even by RLMs standards, this is a truly exceptional video.  Their magnum opus.
That Chrome Stormtrooper boss (no, I don't remember her name);\nThe producers must have seen Game of thrones and told the director that they wanted the big blond sword fighting woman in the movies. I am pretty sure this is how plots are created nowadays.
I lost it at the end
I actually did not realize that people made reaction videos to trailers until now. Humanity is not worth saving.
nerd crew is basically the non-political half of gaming journalism. just praise everything pretentiously
Do they actually own all of that Star Wars shit?
Easter Egg?  Jason Mask slightly hidden to the left behind Jay.  This had to be recorded Friday the 13th since it was uploaded the following day.  If so, I'm guessing it was Jay's idea?
Now I can’t wait for your next reaction video to the next trailer to the next movie! Very Cool! \n\nKeep it up, RLM!
I can't wait until Starwars becomes the next Scientology! Tom Cruise can play 50 year old Han Solo!
I can't believe The guy from Screen Junkies is accused of being a sex pervert or of sexual harrassment. I would have thought it was Rich Evans the whole time. You think you know the world. \n\nCheers Rich Evans. and Screw you Jay for being friends with Andy Signore
Nothing like watching this while trying to sober up and eating a hungry man tv diinnnerr
Please do best of the worst on Netflix The Babysitter by McG. It might be the worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. Holy shit its so bad it defys logic.
please never stop making this series, it's hilarious
This is the most sarcastic thing I've ever seen. Haha...
I didn't watch it, but I'm sure it's great.
These guys are my VHS player's spirit animal.
This is the best Nerd Crew since the first one.
I could power my car on this sarcasm.
When do we get the response video to the announcement of the title for the Han Solo solo movie--SOLO?
As much as I love these satires. I'd like to see what they really think the new movies will be about. They were spot on for Force Awakens speculation, which granted wasn't that hard considering it was such a retread. But I'd still like to hear from them.
Holy shit. This was done with care.
We are all individuals.
How long until it's revealed that Mike's been sexually assaulting Rich? Now we play the waiting game....
might be the best nerd crew episode yet, thanos in the house
Gotta clap for it
Why....\nTHE HELL.....\nDoes Mr.PiggyEats NOT exist?

Well-- that's kinda tasteless.
I don't even watch these shows and I recognize these cookie-cutter personalities and canned reactions so well, it makes me want to die.\nVery cool.
OH MY GAAAAAAAAAAWD
I need that jabba mug!!!
16:18   I died.
Mr.PiggyEats is a great fast food review channel. I can't wait until Evans eats his gun. I'm sure that the last thing he'll taste will be good.
I love popcorn.
I wish Rich Evens would adopt me
Spoiler alert! Porking a porg.
Ah Poe's law....

Very cool
I would deadass subscribe to Mr. PiggyEats.
Haha that Justice League looks shite.

I guess you guys feel my pain. Our culture needs a defibrillator.

_The world is a perpetual caricature of itself; at every moment it is the mockery and the contradiction of what it is pretending to be._ --George Santayana
What the fuck is wrong with the audio?
Do people like this painful sarcasm?
Oh I get it they're being ironic
Oh. My. God. Not again. Please, stop making YouTube videos. YouTube is not a place for art. Or, at least, make some art on the side, and promote it with you YouTube channel. You know, make some independent movies, and build an audience by speaking to them, and then using this platform to promote that art; I mean, essentially, use this space, YouTube, to speak directly to your fans, and then build upon your fanbase by being more interactive, pretty much exactly the way Kevin Smith used the internet to create fans and direct them to his art throughout the 1990's and early 2000's with the View Askew site and message boards and then, later, with podcasting and live shows (and Twitter).
The fact that the world number one diver does cheap Halloween costumes while living in prime estate astounds me. I feel so blessed to be living at this age and time.
The sound he makes when he takes the box off is hilarious
Let me just say that, Lance has his hands full with you!  LOL, what a clever boy you are!
Shite
Love it. Trying to get out to use the restroom may be a little difficukt but lovw the idea and outcome!
I just saw a pic of Tom, Lance and their new fur child ''Stewie''......cute as can be.  :-)
Hilarious! Looks great, hope you really wear it out and about 😬
Is it just me who thinks the lego head looks like someone who's shaved and now has blood and big bumps all over his face😂
Make one for ur husband too.. its cute🎃
Love this video😂 such a cute costume💗
Did you ever want to be a Blue Peter Presenter???
Hey, why aren’t you diving?
when are you going to do another live workout?
Oh my God. I'm so in love with you
Is it possible to sit down in this costume?
Woah i didnt know you had a channel I've subbed and liked and notifacationed
When ever he comes out with a video, it reminds me of swimming. ♥

I really want to see how you got out of the full costume again without cutting anything because I would be stuck forever
em lego is play good in danish learn sumtin new every day
Too much effort.  Tom really should have done something with a g-string and some body paint.
so cute i love it
In a more professional than it needs to be way, if anyone tries this in the future, grab a product called Gesco. It goes on before the paint and helps the paint stick on better and is generally a good underlying coat for any absorbing product (cardboard, paper, etc).
You could have a cutout eye and glue it or something on to yourself as a cloud to make the 'iCloud'
this is so cool, so clever Tom
The music is on point Tom!💃🕺👍
and you can breathe, which is nice -Tom Daley 2017
This was so funny! Not very scary but a good idea 😂😍
You’re like 20 bro stop making costumes especially roblox people
Good and Terrible....
This is your most environmental friendly clip!! We do not need to buy everything, it is much more fun and environmental friendly to make our own costumes!
Dude!! that was impressed... I had fun with your video about HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN COSTUME.... lol\nGreetings from your fan from Paraguay!
He is too sweet. I wish there were more gay boys like him, dating is hard.
Tom, I met you on the London Underground Train in and took a picture with you and so did my sister! Sorry that I forgot to say thanks, but you are a great diver!
Legend has it... Tom is still trying to get out of the finished costume. :)
I enjoyed listening to the Thriller cover music in the background.  Good choice, Mr. Editor.
This is so cute and hillarious=)) i can't omg lololol
I have such a crush on Tom 😩
can i say tht u're so cute and not even scary sorry tom but the costume well done👍
With your cuteness, you can't make a scary Halloween costume, I'm sorry!
How did you get the arm holes even?
so creative Tom, I love it!
He is so cute. Like lil brother :))
such a little kid at heart - love it!
You need a mesh where the mouth is so only you can see out, but people can't see in.
ahaha this was so impressive and funny at the same time i loved it!!
Hiding your hot body with a box... That's a crime for sure!!! ;-)

I like this one https://youtu.be/LCAycxm7JzU
youre the fucking best my guy ! keep those writs working !
Amazing! Your playing is so clean and well executed!! Sick job dude. You inspired me to do a video and get back behind the kit! Ive done one and plan to do many more so thank you!
So tight it almost sounds like MIDI ;D
lots of love and respect matt keep going
Awesome cover!! I am your big fan!! ..trying to be u..check out my channel - ayush ranka
could pls add the remix without the drums,i want to try thus one my own  i luv it bro
And I thought I was a good drummer...
As soon as I heard the song Games by Demi Lovato I came right to your channel to see if you have a cover of it, please do one!!
please do cover for marshmello - silence (illenium Remix), i think your's drums will make it better
Don't ever stop doing covers. PLEASE!
you are such a good drummer
The way you mixed the high hats is really sick.
Where is slushii's credit? The drop in the midde was his remix of voltage. This wasn't just a remix of would you ever.
Wow. Cooper and Matt. Both were great!
Matt, don't tell Luke, but I like your covers a tiny bit more 🤘😎
Your the best bro!
You are my GOD\nRespect man hatsoff to your playing u are my idol\nLove u crazily\n😍😍😍😍
1 million face reveal of the camera man 😂

how do you tune your floor toms
The beat amazing work on that matt
WOW! So amazing job!!! My favourite now!! The drums fit so well with music!!! WOW! GREAT JOB!! This is so amazing, I am speechless!!
I would go away with you, Matt :D
Instead of just always playing video of the logo in the beginnings you should maybe do like cinematic shots of your drums or something. It'd be more visually entertaining and appealing.
Totally agree! And you know why.... In that music you can express your creativity to max power....  Because it is a fact. You are so far the best drummer of the world..... Nothing less!
I think you should cover some metal/ rock
2:10 His hand movement reminds me of  Mike Mangini :P
Absolutely phenomenal.  I'm blown away, well done man.
Nice riffs \nYou brought back some metal there
I challenge you to play this song\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wpkeZ2kwpkM

Omg Joe. How. Like how are you looking so handsome.

Sri Lankan Elephant Chasing Due To Foolish Activity. plz skip the button http://1ink.cc/WEu4
Mint and grey!!!!
Lovely singing voice :)
I see pink and white
i cant be the only one that sees pink & mint 😂
Why can't people realise you can buy customised vans 🤦🏼‍♀️
Go into a picture editing app and use colour/color select, its just shades of blue and grey...
i can see both colours
i swear sometimes I see mint and grey and other times I see pink and white
I see mint and green but it’s actually white and pink
No body gives a shit what colour the shoe is.
its pink and white
I'm 11 and I can't get it in my size
sub to me ill sub back with bots
I saw the shoe in Light Turquoise,Grey and Dark Grey
On the shoe I first saw pink but then when joe clicked off it and back on I saw mint x
Mint and grey shoe my mum said pink and white straight away
ITS AQUA AND GREY
what song was that??
It's teal and grey
This is so last year
I see pink and white  van.
I agree with Joe about the shoe colours
I see pink and white
The shoes I originally saw in blue and white, but when I thought about it I started seeing it in white and pink and now I can’t see it the other way
joe do another video of you playing guitar and singing you are so so good at it like so he sees this every1 if u agree
The shoe is pink and white
i see it different from different angles but i first saw pink and white
bOI I THOUGHT BYRON WAS THE LEAD SINGER OF COLDPLAY
It's a picture of a pink and white shoe that's been altered to make it appear grey and turquoise. Look at the greenish hand.
You both look like ET in the thumbnail
I keep on looking back at the photo and it keeps switching from grey and mint and then pink and white... what is happening?!
Joe playing the guitar 😍
it is pink and white
It’s pink and white 😂
It's mint and greyyyy 😂
You're really good at guitar
I also see mint and grey
it is a nice shoe
There must be something with my eyes because with the dress I saw white and gold and now I see mint and grey, I can never see the opposite?
I see pink and white!
i see pink and white
Joe is right about the shoe
Joe is right I see grey and mint. There is no white or pink!
joe, im sorry, but wtaf is that mask

That's why the sky was orange! 😂😂😂
I saw white and pink
You should go to the X factor
I see grey n greeny idk how ppl see pink, even tho it is pink n white u r looking at the same photo on the same phone it’s ur eyes that make it different
Literally the shoe...Im in  Warrington and its viral on Facebook!!!Im 9 (Im on my nans acc tho) And me and my brother (17 year old and 3 year old brother) Say that its still grey and this mint colour and my brothers girl friend said that its white and pink and me and my brothers (Im the only sister ;-;) were like ITS GREY AND MINT!   >:O And ive seen it  5 times...and its still grey and mint. xD
“ why have u got a bawbag on your chin bro “ 😂😂😂😂😂
I really want someone who can play guitar, because then they can play me a song to fall asleep too 😌
I agree with joe
I saw mint and grey on ten shoe and on the dress I saw white and gold
Make sure the plant has enough sun water and fresh air
On my laptop I saw it as grey and blue and I showed my parents and they only saw pink but I didn't see pink? But looking at it through your camera it does look pink?
I see it grey and mint
i’ve always seen it as mint and grey, but now that i looked at it through the phone i saw pink and white, but whenever zoe would move the phone i would see the mint and grey so it kept changing with me
Well then what did everyone see on the thumbnail ..
Mint and grey guys
good vlog with him playing the guitar
I see mint and grey nothing else....
Joe I think the same as you

Glad they're taking a new step in their music, I guess the Album title say it. I've been there since Night Vision, and I will be till Imagine Dragons is disbanded
These guys can play electric instruments in water despite the electroshock. Freaking awesome!
So, is no one also going to comment about how they used the pool for Cirque Du Soleil’s O?

Getting a linkin park vibe... kinda \nbut im digging them
THIS is a masterpieceeee !!\nHELLO FROM RUSSIAA \nDAN!)
The best song out of all imagine dragon songs!!😄😍
The incredible music aside ... this music video is hilarious. That struggle to keep the instruments above water and then the random and sudden transition to everything is on fucking fire.
This is my new jam
🔥Hot as hell🔥😈 Can't stop listening😆
They always make me feel happy whenever I’m feeling sad or alone. Love  ❤️ you guys!

ai fan của imagine nào? hãy cho tôi thấy cánh tay của các bạn <3 mà công nhận nhóm này toàn bài hay
My sister likes There songs but í Dont í LIKE. LIKe 3 songs 
Hh
This guy has some good points but he sounds like KSI and it's off-putting
Anyone else think this guy seems like a massive nob?
This white man looks black
3:17 is what your looking for!!!!!
Please don't reduce this to AFTV level! I know you've seen an opportunity to make monies like Fat Robbie has from his channel, but at the expense of your club? Keep it classy mate. We already get the 'buying success' and 'plastic' jibes. Don't need AFTV levels of ridicule too!
FOR ALL SPORTS FANS THAT CRITICISE THEIR TEAMS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU WORK HARD FOR MULTIPLE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE, BALANCING ALOT OF THINGS AND PLEASING UNGREATFUL PEOPLE.
It’s either get Belotti or bring back Tammy Abraham
He’s dying to be like DT of Arsenal fan tv lol
I’ve got several points here so I’m gonna just spit them out. \nMoses is fucking dreadful, seriously, I’ve seen better crosses from my grandad with a tennis ball.\nApzillicueta is our only centre back who can pass a ball, it is getting ridiculous seeing our defenders punting the ball back like it’s a fucking drop ball. Why isn’t Zappacosta starting? Why did we sell Matic? Why doesn’t Rudiger start? \nFuck of Conte. \nUseless pile of wank.
Pretty sure this guy goes to my Uni 😂
Trying to be like arsenal fan TV to get a few more views
Hahha Chelsea are fucking shit! \nForever a small club! \nPlastic and shit fans!
How dare he diss Willian. Guy is over reacting. Its one defeat against a Palace team who were up for it. Get over it and move on ffs....
Can't blame bats I mean think of all the crucial goals he's scored for us? In my opinion he deserves more chances.
Plastic fans, plastic club, always will be
These guys are laughing like they've never heard that expression before... it old, guys. My friends were saying that in secondary school back in the late 90s. As for Chelsea... yep, you said it, no leadership, no strength in depth and no recognisable and proven striker.\n As for Palace, c'mon chaps. Only way is up now. Fans were terrific as always. There is a team spirit, a positive one, at Palace that can't be emulated or obtained by any other team. The day we lose it, is the day we no longer exist.
He's trying cunt of Willan I can't see why love child I guess.
Chelsea’s fan base is a joke.
Straight up I think this dude has autism
You need a hole in condoms, it`s where you put your knob in.
I can see G.Hiddik replacing Antonio before Christmas in emergency. And then having Mussonda a regular starter and Willian going on loan to Fulham or something.
This is just lol
Costa and Matic were missed. A Chelsea fan was mocking me a few weeks ago when I said Chelsea would miss him\nChelsea do not play to Batshuayi's strength, it is sad. If you play Messi as a Target man he would be shit too\nBatshuayi is not Costa, he is probably better as a wide forward or when playing with two forwards
Bet you didn't think he was useless when he got the winner in Madrid.
Fucking palace 😅😅😅😅😅😅nice to see the scum be put in there place'''
If we can win one of the cups, and have a decent UCL run, then it would be an ok season
Hammering willian?! I would gladly take him to man utd. You guys missing matic so badly but do not even know it.

100% agree with this guy
Are these the people that live in London these days? Fuck me what a third world shithole.
3:18 was why you came here
Lol that must hurt..palace not scored and then they beat Chelsea omg Chelsea are shit
Perhaps try interviewing a real Chelsea fan & not a kid who has only known the success of the last three years.
All condoms have holes in them. That's how you put your dick in them.
City and united for the title, pep vs jose
Doesn't a condom already have a hole in it?🤔
Where do these people get time to rant like this? Son, you're a Chelsea supporter. Not a board member.
No bus no party. Why does conte inisist on playing on the counter. Why not commit instead of comitiing after you go down. They are not man city. Less than 60 percent possession which is disgraceful. 70 percent easy and if you have the ball. You will score. You have the quality in hazard.\nTo stop chelsea is easy. STOP THE COUNTER ATTACK AND CONTE IS USELESS.\nWhy play with so many defensive players?
Shit team shit supporters and thats the sample of it
Why do chelsea fans moan just because they've lost one game?You lot win trophies year in year out and your fans are cocky after you lose 1-0 or 2-1.you lot have a problem...
This guy is bigger than DT.
Shit club very little history 😂.
why do all these random cunts keep stopping by and thinking they can give their 2 cents whenever they feel like it? mad disrespectful.
You will never be Arsenal fan TV
I hopw to god ancelotti replaces conte this summer
I don’t know why black and Asian people support chelsea are you guys deluded they’re deluded. A bunch of middle class snoby asians and blacks support them don’t know their roots uncle toms
he can't even make won successful dribble, the moment i saw willian on the line-up i knew we were going to struggle. charly came in and his first dribble had a better chance at goal then willian attemping 100 dribble and failing 99.
It really feels like the team can't be bothered, rather than Conte being to blame. But then again, the team, and manager didn't show any passion. It feels like the Mourinho disaster is happening again, only with Conte at the centre of a shit storm.
Fab was the only starter who actually played, he wasn't excellent, but compared to the rest he was ok. Mosonda should be starting ahead of William until he fixes homes himself up
You was singing his name when he scored to win you the league 😂😂
Hahaha ... :D \nBatsuayi indeed is very mediocre.\nBut let's hope Chelsea could bounce back. Let's support our team instead of mocking them shall we?
Zappacosta should start now that Moses is out injured
Why conte thinks or believes he can go 2 seasons playing one formation still baffles me! This chelsea team is easily predictable because the manager has failed to keep opponents guessing.substituting a striker when u need one and Willian starting games ahead of Pedro!!!!!!
Ppl can't even handle  one bad result. This is the beauty of premier league. Last season conte was magical this & that now suddenly he is this & that. Give some time we don't have proper 11 now due to injuries. Keep calm & support. Dont b glory hunters like man utd , arsenal. We don't have history but we are making in the process. Keep calm. KTBFFH.
One of the worst Chelsea proformances since the founding of the club all the way back in 2003
Conte is becoming a bitch because he is not like he was at juventus. And if he gets the passion, ruthlessness and desire from juventus we will win the efl cup because we are shit cahill that anus, willian that anus,bastuyai that anus, they don't know how to play willian and bastuyai went from Messi to a Sunday league player. We need to sell them and buy better players but we all know it will never happen because our board is also shit and the fucking owner doesn't take matters in his own hands and sack fire and kick them (board) out of the door.and the last one we need to stop trying to get fouls and man up and aim to get a goal.
what a shit from Willian everytime when he gets the ball he loses it freely why. Batshuayi is another fucked up player being overrated what a shit. every time we start batshuayi and captain its a lose Why. are they committed to the team or they are being paid to fix games. Willian, Cahill and Batshuayi should be benched no matter what those players are fucking useless. Rudiger and Christen are much better on the back than what this old guy is doing for us. \n\nYeah Batshuayi is like a broken condom
He talks like Mo from AFTV
Title is over man. Summer transfer was underwhelming coupled with these type of performances. Best we aim for top 4, try to win one of the domestic cup n maybe a decent run in the ucl.
Stop interviewing this guy. He speaks anger and not football.
If we can’t beat Crystal Palace and Burnley, what’s the point.
These southern fans need to get a grip imagine if you supported a club that actually struggles.
Batshuayi should just get outta club asap...willian has really been shit of late though...cahill should just be like JT and admit its past his time and settle for a spot on the bench but he is probably selfish thinking of a spot in world cup...i have a feeling this season will be like the season after we won the league two years ago....
City are light years away from any team in the PL right now. The top 4 is the real competition
Lewis someone called in sick we need you to come in early
Fucking hell that chant at the start might be the worst chant in football history
We won't win the league for sure bcoz our squad depth is just totally shit.For Man City even without Aguero they are thrashing teams left and right bcoz they have another proven striker Gabriel Jesus.For United if Lukaku gets injured they have Zlatan , Rashford and Martial.But we have useless Batshuay.When he plays we become so shit that we can't even beat fucking Palace!!!!!!
You completely made my day mate. These words are 100% Chelsea now 😡😡
Trending with 9.2k views, well then I guess that Russian tycoon even bribed YouTube mods then.
The production value behind this channel is so mediocre like the history of Chelsea Football Club. 👀

KANTE FC, no kante no party guys
BTEC ArsenalFanTV
i salute this guy
Call me delusional but I still think we can win the title, Man City always have a great start to the season, yes this year they've been pretty explosive but there's no chance they will keep hammering teams the way they are. UTD are playing garbage football recently so I expect them to drop more points, morata will be back this weekend hopefully and our season can restart from there. We had a worse start last season so there is hope.
Somalian is a chelsea shirt 😂😂 man these leeches are everywhere
Always crying like a baby back bitch, no shame in losing to the mighty eagles. Were due a win.
A black Chelsea fan? Must be a paid actor
He is trying to act like troops # AFTV IS BETTER
This is way more hilarious than arsenal fan tv

Puerto Rico (a.k.a Welfare Island ) A TRUTH THAT MUST BE TOLD\n\n \nThe USDA\nFood and Nutrition Service told CNSNews.com that, on average, 4 million people\nreceived food stamps in Puerto Rico each\nmonth in FY 2012. \n\n\nThis\npathetic miserable island is distinguished by its high crime, poverty and\njoblessness, which are far worse than in any of the 50 states. The territory's\neconomy, moreover, has fallen further behind the national one over the past\nfour decades. Bad inept government is largely to blame. \n\n\nYet most\nAmericans are oblivious and unaware to the Caribbean\nisland's problems. After a Century of American Citizenship, Puerto\nRicans Have Little to Show for It. After one hundred years of citizenship, the per\ncapita income of Puerto Ricans is roughly $15,200—half that of Mississippi,\nthe poorest state in the union\n\n \nPuerto Rico\nhas a population of 4 million, meaning 40 percent of Puerto Ricans are on food\nstamps paid by the federal government\n\n\nAlthough the\nsupplemental assistance cash is designated for eligible food items, it is\nwidely acknowledged that participants use most of their allotted cash for\nnon-food essentials, drugs and illegal gambling, now that is dumb ! \n\n\nThe Island\nis filled with high crime, drugs, thieves and killers, way too many hard core\ncriminals for such a small island and a fake witchcraft religion that has\ndivided the population. \n\n\nMost US\nHispanics stereotype Puerto Ricans as dumb, or of lower inteligence but.. as you can see there's some\ntruth to it:\n\nThe food\nstamp program has had a negative effect on the population they even admit they\nuse the money to buy pot and cocaine. The 'boricuas' of 100 years ago would be\nashamed of the current crop of 'boricuas'. No wonder why most other Hispanics\nconsider Puerto Ricans, lazy, dishonest, corrupt and heavily dependent on US\nGovernment handouts. Most other Hispanics agree that Puerto Ricans speak the\nworst Spanish language dialect in the western hemisphere, in fact they don't\neven speak good English either.\n\nAmong other\nproblems: rampant identity theft by P.R. immigrants - often from the 'welfare'\nisland - who use stolen Puerto Rican birth certificates to obtain U.S.\npassports, Social Security benefits, and other federal services available to\nPuerto Ricans because they are U.S. citizens.\n\n \n\nIn a recent sample of 8,000 passport fraud cases investigated by the State\nDepartment, 60 percent involved Puerto Rican birth documents purchased\nillegally for as much as $10,000\n\nPuerto\n Rico's annual income per person was around $12,000 in 2004,\nless than half that of Mississippi,\nthe poorest state. More than 58% of the island's people live below the\nfederally defined poverty line. That poverty rate is nearly four times the\nnational average, and more than twice as high as in poor states such as\nKentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia. \n\n\nHas anyone\never noticed how much ( false ) pride Puerto Ricans have? At the same time many\nPuerto Ricans are filled with Anti-American sentiment. Most Puerto Ricans see\nthe United States\nas a symbol of Imperialism and a very oppressive country to their beloved\nlittle island ( smaller than Jamaica\n). While many Puerto Ricans have spent time in different cities throughout\nUnited States, return migrants and their children are often ridiculed because\nof their inability to speak Spanish with the same accent and lexicon as natives\nand their poor English language skills, so the Dumb Puerto Rican is NOT a Myth.\n\n\nPuerto\nRicans are the most violent offenders in NYC, they are the poorest group in\nNYC.\n\n\nThe Island of Puerto\n  Rico is known as Zombie\n Island due to the all\nthe crack heads. The wrongly imposed name of ' La Isla de El Encanto' this a\nMyth and a distortion of oversize proportions !, Puerto Ricans have been here\nin the US as long as Italians, Cubans, Colombians, Dominicans and other\nHispanics and while Italians, Cubans and Colombians have moved on to the\nSuburbs, to upscale single family homes Puerto Ricans are still living in the\nprojects in section 8 housing ghettos and high crime neighborhoods ( The Hood\n).\n\nWell the logical question must be asked. Why would a prideful bragging\nirrational with an identity crisis people such as the Puerto Ricans constantly\nvote to remain an American\n Territory (Commonwealth\n)over the past 5 decades? \n\nThe people\nof Puerto Rico vote every 4 years (during\nthe same time we hold our American Presidential elections) towards becoming an American\n State, remaining an American\n Territory or becoming\nIndependent. \n\n\nDuring the\nlast two elections Puerto Ricans rarely voted to remain an American territory\n(49% of the vote) over becoming a an American\n State (48% of the\nvote). While the voting toll for Puerto Rican Independence\nwas a mere 1%. If Puerto Ricans are such patriotic and proud people how is it\npossible that only 1% of the population wants to become independent from the United\n  States? \n\n\nThe answer is Welfare. Each year American tax payers send over $17 billion\ndollars to Puerto Rico in Welfare (social\nservices) alone. These social services include food stamps, public housing (Los\nCaserios), and college tuition for Puerto Rican students attending American\nfunded universities. To make matters worse Puerto Ricans do not pay any Federal\nTaxes. This means that American tax payers are getting back very little into\nwhat we are putting into Puerto Rico. As\nan American Tax payer we all have a difficult time sending our tax money to an\nisland that constantly votes against becoming an American\n State. You don't have\nto be the smartest cookie out of the bunch but it's safe to say that there is\nnot much logic behind this.\n\n \nWhat does\nthe United States\nget in return for all of our tax money and services? The answer was the Vieques\nMarine Base which served as a strategic base in the Caribbean\n Sea. However, the United\n  States lost the base when angry\nPuerto Rican protestors were claiming that the Base was a symbol of American\nImperialism. Many of the protestors even burned American flags during their\nprotests (yet Puerto Ricans rioted when American boxer Bernard Hokpins tossed\nthe PR flag to the ground).\n\n\nThe other\nmediocre, insignificant service provided to the United States\nfrom Puerto Rico is a very small number of\ntheir citizens who serve in our arm forces. However with Puerto Rico's\npopulation of 2 million, Puerto Ricans do not even make up 5% of our Arm Forces\n( If you asked a Puerto Rican they would tell you a lie that 90% of the United\nState's Arm Forces are Puerto Rican !).
Its not Trump and Dumbass,  why can't you Dumbass's put out the truth .
This is the standard in our culture if your wealthy you get away with things as people try to carry favor with you by helping you out yet eventually it comes to light thankfully our society is improving slowly yet we must realize that there is more good in a group then bad like not all men are like trump all whites are not like white nationalist not all republicans support trump not all blacks sell drugs pick any stereotype or bigoted ideal however in order for this to be realized it’s not enough to say oh I find this horrible you must act it can be as simple as seeing someone being made uncomfortable an instead of ignoring it step into stop it additionally if you make a mistake own up to an then work to rectify it
Word is that this talking head has witnessed Harvey Weinstein showering many times. Clearly, he's upset that Harv prefers women. Poor Seth has become a woman scorned.
Wait... I'm confused. Wouldn't asking for massages be asking for consent? Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
Trump supporter logic: CNN is so biased that means they’re fake. \nAlso Trump Supporter Logic: Fox News is not biased at all what are you taking about.
If Hillary had been elected Weinstein would have probably kept going. She's into WAYY darker stuff than him. And to be clear, on the scale of evil, in America's elite circles, harassing or assaulting 25 women is peanuts ... oh ... does that offend you? Good. Because there is REAL actual evil out there just carrying on, every day, meanwhile we crucify this idiot and think there are life lessons and social change to come from it. Anyone who changes how they live their lives because of this story is a blithering idiot. Sorry : )
Wow, the attempt to associate Harvey with Trump has already begun. Harvey was as left as they come, nothing in common with Trump whatsoever, more like the rest of the entertainment business then anyone else, YET somehow now we see his picture in the same shot with Trumps. This is classic denial, misdirection, and blame shifting. Total propaganda piece right here.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA GOTH TRUMP!!!
oh sure tie trump to this scumbag wienstien. what a load of crap. Seth is just a typical liberal lying peace of ecrement. So damn sick of this incessant dribble from all the Hollywood and media scum. No wonder people are sick of this crap. 2018 is going to be rough on the democratics if this crap continues. I have to go puke now.
I'm not a Trump fan but geez you can't say a thing about a woman or you will be deemed sexist. \nTrump often called Ted Cruz a nasty guy. Trump called Hillary a nasty woman and that's considered sexist. Stop making women victims all the time. Otherwise the Republicans will keep winning.\nWe need to stop name calling because it's mostly fake news and Trump is going to win again. Look at all the thumbs down this video got. Seth is grasping at straws. He use to be soooo funny. What happened????
What does the behaviour of a few men have to do with alleged systemic sexism? I wonder if these assholes will ever take on the pervasive, and actual, systemic discrimination and sexism against men under Family Law and in divorce court. Hopefully not, since the humour here leaves much to be desired, they'd probably just suck at doing it anyway like they suck at this.
Are you serious?? The President DID NOT RAPE ANYONE. PLUS YOU IDIOT HE SENT A TON OF STUFF OVER THERE BEFORE IT HIT SO THEY WERE AHEAD. WAKE UP. HE HAS DONE MORE IN THIS SHORT TERM THEM OBAMA DID THE WHOLE DAM TIME. WAKE UP YOU IDIOT. YOU SHOULD BE FIRED FOR NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.
Hey Seth. Did u know ur little brother seems like ur big brother? Also, apart from the hair and height, u guys are twins. U even have the same voice! Except ur brother's like the more fuckable version of u :D
Also, of course Weinstein expects to get away with it. It's not like he harassed and raped all those women last weekend. He's gotten away with for *years*. Because women are not believed and are expected to put up with this man-child whiny toddler routine. Because boys will be boys right?\n\nUgh, infuriating. At least men are starting to speak up--figures like Seth Meyers and Colbert and such that has large audiences.
Weinstein fucked some and harassed many high profile A-list actresses. only powerful and successful women came out but i think there are many others who were silenced. However now I know that all the outwardly beauty and charm is only one side of the success, the other side being sexually harassed by powerful men to become successful. Comparing them with what Trump did is a diversion from the whole matter.
And when are we talking again about Louis CK?
Yep, that's America now days. Crooks and sexual predators run this country.
So easy to point the finger and in regards to male entitlement we have no entitlement in 2017 and i for one believe in equality if not specifically the toxic version of woman's lib we now see, the law society and especially the left is ready to crucify anyone with views opposed to their constantly and unimaginatively run mill of tags for each and everything they do not understand and feel threatened by and obviously this includes individuality. Seth  you are but a parrot and leave me unimpressed, not only that but because you are unable to stomach people who are  able to handle being what they are which in some cases mean masculine then that is an issue of your own.
Great call Seth, three of a kind.
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you

Sri Lankan Elephant Chasing Due To Foolish Activity. plz skip the button http://1ink.cc/WEu4
Lol goth Trump
Give credit to the less-powerful men who harass women with sexual comments and physical assault. Don’t save it all for the sexually predatory celebrities!  Men don’t listen to women so it’s up to men to come together and speak out. There are so many decent men but if they remain silent the disregard for the humanity of women will never stop.
Both Trump and Weinstein are two perverted birds of a feather,\nin prison with matching orange jumpsuits they'll look good together.\nHere on Earth their wealth and power will help them both get away,\nthough after life SATAN may say, It's here in HELL you two shall stay!\n\nQ: Where do Trump and Clinton's vacation location overlap?\n\n A: On Jeff Epstein's pedophile island. \n\nMaybe despite the left/right rhetoric these establishment politicians (Trump/Clinton) and their major donors (Ailes/Weinstein) aren't all that different; power hungry narcissists who get off by dominating women and those weaker than them. Pretty typical behavior for clinical narcissists. Hope that there actually is an Earth deity called SATAN to punish these wicked powerful men in HELL as they will likely escape justice here.
Seth Meyers and Weinstein were buddies. Cut the BS, Seth.
Looks like the southern inbred redneck pissards shat their pants in rage when they saw this video. Those misogynist monkeys are worthless, they should be put down.
Bill Clinton is a rapist! :)
Business meetings should not take place alone in a hotel room or bedroom. A red flag should be if someone wants to have a business meeting alone.
Is this were we ask Seth how many times he voted for some with last name of Clinton?
Where's Bill or Hillary?   To People watch late night comedy to formulate their political opinions, good luck in the coming civil war.
Fucken liberals never taking blame even the liberal Hollywood pig is Donald Trumps fault. You forgot to mention Bill Clintons bj in the oval office. Your show sucks
Thank you.  Most people avoid this topic altogether.  This gives me a place where I can go on to another day while I fight a quiet battle against a monster.  Laughter is a big deal.
Seth is the definition of a cuck
Bravo Seth, very well said. I was so sad to see Jon Stewart retire but, for me, Seth's Closer Look segments have since filled the void Jon left behind. Seth is to Trump what Jon was to Bush, a refreshingly clear voice of logical criticism that is delivered in smart and entertaining satire.
more leftwing propaganda,so sad
Words, actions... if you don't know the difference you should probably just kill yourself.
Oh no, we can't have a Connery-style Bond movie in the 2010s. The public won't tolerate sexism and non-consensual groping and kissing! This would be a scandal in modern times!! - Dude, you people elected Trump. Whatever you do, just don't be a hypocrite, okay?
I see a culture of systemically believing female accusers without proof.
Stop trying to divide our country by attacking the prez and spreading out right lies. Harvey Weinstein Needs to be delivered through Christ of his demons its a very serious thing and lots of people just make a joke about it.
Name one women who claims trump raped her..  Bill Clinton on the other hand raped a little girl and got away with it by arguing that she wanted it. Who was his lawyer during the trail? Hillary the champion of womens rights. Its funny how the economy is at high and unemployment is the lowest its been in years. Good luck being 🐑🐑 cant wait to be 80 y.o and say i supported trump.
no, no the flooded bathroom would be covered in gold
Donald Trump? You mean Bill The Rapist Clinton, Seth.
While Trump talked the talk, Bill Clinton walked the walk; yet he warrants not even an honorable mention from leftist Seth.
Harvey is one of 10 thousand. And thats not including the pedos.
Donald Trump is crazy,i am sorry American they had no one better to be a President,,,so so sad
WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP YOU ARE!!!! AND YOU GUYS FOR EVEN WANTING TO BE IN THIS EVIL MANS COMPANY!!!!CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO BE EXPOSED SETH!!!! WHY ARE YOU ALLOWED TO BULLY SO MUCH???? YOU SHOULD BE STOPPED!!! AND THE GOD YOU MOCK!!! WILL DEAL WITH YOU PERSONALLY!!! AND ALL WHO SUPPORT THIS EVIL ASS!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT DAY!!! WHEN YOUR ARROGANT SELF-ABSURD ATTITUDE IS EXPOSED FOR WHO YOU TRULY ARE!!!! BE ON GUARD!!! YOUR PUNISHMENT IS ON THE WAY!!!! THATS GOD'S PROMISE FOR THE WICKED AND EVIL PEOPLE LIKE YOU!!! AND ALL WHO AGREE WITH YOU!!!! PLEASE FATHER GOD!!! SHUT THIS MANS MOUTH UP FOR GOOD!!!! HE DOESN'T DESERVE TO SPEAK THE WAY HE DOES!!! NO WONDER THERE'S SO MANY BULLIES IN THIS WORLD!!! BECAUSE OF PRICKS LIKE YOU WHO THINK ITS OK TO SPEAK LIKE THAT OF OTHERS!!! MAN!!! YOU ARE IN FOR SUCH A RUDE AWAKENING!!! YOU TRULY ARE!!!! AND MOST DESERVED!!!!
I find it annoying that they use that he's a dinosaur as an excuse when there's tonnes of men that were born around the same time that don't sexually assault or rape women???
Seth is a liberal but puppet
Seth Meyers is neither funny, relevant, or worthy of widespread circulation.
Did you see that?\nwww.shooppingo.com
Great segment. Thanks for speaking up Seth & team.
He is an ornery misogynistic old cruddy white man.
Preach!!!!!
👍😎
No Clintons or Kennedys?
I cant stand Seth !!
*God Emperor Trump* locker room banter joking  that when you're  popular women will  *let*  you do anything.\n\nAnyone to the left *Sexist, misogynist, sexual abuser* \n\nPerson with a brain where is your  *proof*  that he sexually assaulted anyone. \n \nThe left  He made *Jokes*  or more often they just lie.
Hate to break it to you, Seth, but you're a part of this systemic sexism. You and your peers were complacent in covering up for him and not speaking out.
I personally think, for trump, its a Power Entitlement and the masogany came along with the power trip at a younger age growing up with a silver spoon shoved up his orange orangutan Ass .... I say that cause ANYONE who disagrees with Trump is going to be attacked in a middle school kind of way .... I'd just like to see someone knock trumps ass out if he says anything to their face .... Just cause you are president doesn't give you a pass at saying what you want to anyone ....
Seth Meyers just kill yourself you're pathetic anyway just a matter of time cocaine & zepam medication are not a good mix !
Why frame a whole episode that is not different then others about trump as one about male power? Omg
Seth's right hand has a very strange resting position....
My questions: Why didn't these women come out when it was happening? Why did they wait so long? Just like the women with Bill Cosby? I tell you why, they wanted to make a name for themselves first. They wanted to get that status. Not saying it didn't happen-because I'm sure it did. Hollywood is a cesspool of perverts. But when Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Todd Bridges and countless others came out and mentioned what was happening to them. They got oust from Hollywood big time. Corey Haim even killed himself. And they were children at the time too. So, what's wrong with this picture?
Love you Seth I look forward to your show every week!
You know I bet that T-Rex can type 100 words a minute.  Maybe he should be President?
best commentary ever. Meyers for president!
Thank you for calling men like this predators. I am fed up with terms like sexually inappropriate. It has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with predation.
Simultaneously galaxy lamp happen restore crucial form corporate reference.
Lets remember what Trump said about  Roger Ailes . ''He's a very good person': Trump DEFENDS Roger Ailes and smears the women accusing him of sexual harassment saying Fox News boss 'helped' ungrateful accusers get ahead' So if your  Trump supporters its ok?
I cant believe I actually clicked on this clip expecting Seth to talk about the real issue.  Alas, after 3 minutes I turned it off.  Same crap.  Trump may be wrong about a lot of things, but on the subject of calling Seth Meyers what he is, he is very accurate.  Go find some new material Seth
Well said.
best closer look ever
Trump sounds like a 12 year old boy with his twitter fights, calling people names, etc. and all of these adults at his rallies listen to him and think he is smart and a great president. Are you f**king serious!? Also, it's hilarious his supporters have Drain the Swamp signs because Trump added to the swamp with Goldman Sachs executives, his campaign donors, and billionaires. Also, Trump bitched about Hillary (Goldman Sachs, cutting Wall St. regulations, adding soliders/war, jobs, unsecured computers, elites, etc.), BUT he is doing the same thing. Trump is a hypocrite and a conman.
O,o
Meyers YOUR AN IDIOT!!
http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration
Didnt Seth Meyers get his big break by working under Weinstain? Oh the shame of it!
I watched trump blaspheming Jesus Christ and called him weak and stupid for allowing himself to be nailed to a piece of wood he's the antichrist
I MIGHT NOT always agree with Seth and I do NOT like Liberals.  but come on, it is common knowledge that TRUMP did NOT know what the 25th amendment was!!  REMEMBER THAT A WHILE BACK, Glenn Beck proved and stated that Trump is NOT a constitutional conservative and MARK LEVIN has also said this!!!
Throwing the towels in such  tragic circumstances and by such a rich person - not a good idea ...
Harvey first in the title but talks about trump for 70% libeeeeeeeral
Clever and fun
Thank you, Seth.
Holy crap. Its like he is reading a blog written by a 19 year old women's studies student. If you ever need an illustration of what a puppet looks like just remember this video.
Gorka is a faux intellectual bs artist.
https://youtu.be/uOBuGCd39Xw
Trumps, Beach bums.
LooK, Seth. I love your show. And if true, what Weinstein did is appalling. But accusation are still only accusations. He is not convicted yet. There is seriously something wrong with the fabric of American society if you talk like that - not only from the right. This piece is just dumb. Fire your writers.! toxic atmosphere of white male entitlement? It looks, like it is first and foremost a media problem with all the examples you state (including Trump). Be careful to tell this to ordinary white males because it's exactly why Clinton lost the elections.
White men somehow manage to systematically oppress women even thought Jews own 96% of US mainstream media and 90% of the porn industry and 90% US music industry, control Hollywood and our politician. At the same time, christian values, that promote every moral values that helps to create happy and healthy families, are oppressive. No matter what the white goyim do, they will lose.
Seth Myers sucked off harvey.
I haven't even listened to one word of this crap... Scanning the TRENDING section of you tube is like reading a death list...    Nothing but sickness. Nothing of redeeming value, just like most of the liberal front....   The count down for a reboot is coming..
notice how he left out Bill Clinton, in the leftist news
The very fact trump is in the white house is proof of systemic sexism.
The Trump voter has failed America.
Thanks Seth!
I think the Left is Completely missing the Point. Yes, if Trump is guilty of Sexual Assault on women then he should pay the consequence.\nHowever, So many Left Wing Celebrities have been spewing their Moral Superiority over the rest of the World, knowing what types of Evil they're working for - or even who They are at their core.
Reading these comments...sexual assault is not a political issue. It's a public heath issue. What the hell is wrong with you people?
Trump is a active racist and a retired sexual predator
DONT WORRY AYESHA, THATS NORMAL COMPARED TO TAMERA GIVING RASPBERRIES TO ADAM'S STOMACH

Idris literally just said last week that feet gets him too!!!
Y'ALL NEED TO KEEP AYESHA ON THE PANELLLLL
Women in their natural habitat. Cluck cluck clucking
People clowning on Steph...but imagine how many ballers in the league are foot lovers? Its nothing new or odd to have a foot fetish...other than the definition description itself which makes it seem unacceptable. Same thing applies with the Rex Ryan issue a few years back. There is absolutely no doubt many players in the NFL league are foot men. Recognize truth.
When you ask for nudes but she ain't even like you
I thought he liked fooking the calves...
Thats really cute🙃
And I bet Steph is going to be label as a foot creep.
I have feet fetish as well. Girls with bad feet is a major turn off for me.
Because he has that Quentin Tarantino foot fetus. Look up Thai foot massage 😂😂😂
astrology..it's a Pisces thing..i'm one..if her feet are ugly then it's a no
I'm here for the hilarious comments lol.
Y'all seen that video of a light skin sucking on that one girls feet? Must be lightskin thing to be into feet
KEEP AYESHA!! ADD her to the Cast!!
Ayesha please give Stephen your phone. TMI!
She’s not even cute fat ass face smh curry
Men who are turned on by feet are weird to me.
Single women always want to know the secrets to you & your mans relationship and guess what\nafter they find out they will use it to......GET YOUR MAN.   \nSmart ladies keep your private matters......private.\npeace.
I'm jealous right now he get all 10 toes to play with anytime. I know he enjoy her toes sucking on her pretty toes, tongue all over and between her toes
Love feet.. nothing wrong w that.. goes to show most real men pay attention to lil details
I like my mans Curry even more.
shes rich af and he doesnt even have the latest iphone lol shes still using like an iphon 6 it seems lol
She has nice toes
If my wife exposed me this bad shes getting divorced and sued for  emotional distress
Girls....make up your feet from now on 😂
I have foot fetish also
stephen should have killed ayesha by now
Cavs in 3

The ONLY way I'll watch the real again, after the shameful way they treated Tamar, is to bring her back. I'll also settle for Ayesha Curry cuz Tamar is booked!
I like that though very unusual but kind of cute too.
I fw Steph lightskin girls always got pretty feet and white girl
Shows me that Curry is a faithful dude. Instead of looking for thots while on the road he asks his wife for nudes/feet pics.
There is no heterosexual explanation for this
Lony is wearing  Tamar ‘s wig hahahhahaha and Adrienne is wearing Tamar’s dresses hahahhahaha I think realdaytime  is saving good money this season
It’s her man/husband she can send him him whatever.
Ayesha do got some sexy feet.... *pulls out lotion
Shaq gonna send some feet pics to curry now lol
Dickhead for exposing him

Lmao Steph is a toe sucker. still I'd suck Ayesha's toes
Fucking normies infest everything and now they are heading for the fetishes 🙄
Black Fat bitches!!!!
To clarify, just because you can find an image on Google doesn't mean it's legal. This law is very loosly enforced but still is a law.
Legal illegal. What's the difference. If I want to do it I will and get away with it. Oh I've already done it like a million times.
Then how come movies can reproduce it? Do they ACTUALLY ask permission?
So we have to wait until 2055 to take photos of it at night?
is that y on geoguessr/google maps stuff is blurred out randomly XD
The French can't get me I'm in the United States! *searches Google for Eiffel Tower at night*
What about if the lights are off? Could I take a picture then?
This is what's wrong with the world
in america we'd stop the wind Gosh how are we supposed to do that? Build a bubble around it or something?
https://www.pixelstalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eiffel-tower-paris-night-wallpaper.jpg Heres a picture of the Eiffel Tower at night.\n\nfuckin idiots lol
Really? Taking the photo of public place such as Eiffel at night is illegal. Are you joking?
ok fine ill just search up
When you realize Ksi took a pic of the tower at night on his Snapchat story
Why was this video so interesting?
Fuck France, Pissy Bastards wine over everything. I only respect France in world war one, after that Knock Knock, It's the Third Reich
at night the tower sparkles with lights i saw it on someones  insta story
I've taken more than 20 pictures of the eiffel tower day and night..
I don't think tourist will give a shit to that
now im gonna do it
Ima copyright my face and earn millions in court
Who gives a shit what France law says once you leave... if you leave the country with pictures (back to USA for example) they will have hard-ass time trying to get anything out of you, unless you go back to France again and they find your identity (in the case they care to begin with). I really doubt many countries will sign extradition paperwork/agreements based on such stupidity as this.
That's so stupid. But it doesn't stop compagnies to sell post cards showing the Eiffel tower at night and etc.
I had a puzzle of the Eiffel Tower at night.
what about if you are in USA ( like me)
* takes a video of the Eiffel Tower at night * opps
Kind of just a little bit retarded, France.
This guy disregards fair use completely
This is fucking fake, there are lots of pictures of the Eiffel tower at night
I'm JapanBall Copyright,  now u can't say that
Interesting world we live in today! Some of these countries' govts. that so diligently enforce copyright protections of their art etc., are so callous about either supporting or engaging in the illegal invasion of, and interference into the economies of less fortunate sovereign countries. And then, they have the audacity to manufacture legal protections in profiting from the stolen wealth.
Immediately looks up Eiffel Tower. Finds over a hundred pics of it at night 😐😂\n\nMaybe then you should change your channel name to “a mere fraction as interesting”
I like how when you search up Eiffel Tower on google and the first that pops up is a night view of the Eiffel Tower
If you live in utah and this is a law in the european union than it would be pretty hard \nfor the french government to arrest you in the us
This use of copyright feels like pointless and unreasonable overstretching to me.\n\n*TL;DR : Copyright law does not apply to this situation so the taking of photos is allowed.*\n\n1. The protection offered by copyright law is supposed to prevent exploitation of an original work in such a way that the creator/copyright holder could be harmed in some way.\n2. The designer/builder of the lights on the Tower is not harmed by pictures being taken of their work; they have already been paid for the work, been recognized for the work, and completed the work. They have nothing more to gain from the work.\n3. Nothing can be taken from the holder of the copyright because there is nothing to take, as point 2 states.\n4. Because of points 1 and 3, copyright law does not apply to the situation because the protection offered could not protect anything; making it inapplicable.\n5. Because of point 4, nothing is protecting photos taken of the Tower.\n6. Because absolutely nothing, then, prohibits the taking of photos of the Tower, it is allowed and not illegal.\n\nI don't see any holes in the logic here. Do you?
What if I posted the photo ? Would I have to pay?
Immediately after watching this I looked up eiffel tower night \n😎
This is RIDICULOUS. \nThese are in the public domain.
*Types Eiffel tower at night in google * Oh look, pictures of the Eiffel tower at night.
Wow, that is not true :D
I take a picture and nothing happend :/
Your French pronunciation is pretty good. Très bien.
First time watching a video on this channel, was thoroughly impressed. Keep up the good work!
If it was American we could stop the wind\nI hate cocky Americans they don't even have much to be cocky about. I understand most Americans aren't like that though
Copyright law is getting way out of hand if you cant even take a picture of a goddamm building
who in earth would think that I own or made up the Eiffel Tower by posting a picture of it at night
you are a fagget
Its not copyright if you are not sharing it... Thats like buying a game and saying its copyright..
so, theoretically in another 38 years, you can legally take photos of the Eiffel tower
So wait a second, the LIGHTS are copyrighted?
YouTube does NOT count as commercial use because it’s free
Honestly this is a stupid idea to copyright pictures of buildings
I learn more about this world in these interesting YouTube channels than I do on school
let me save you from wasting 4 minutes of your life. copyright.
pffft, now I know what time to visit the Eiffel Tower if I ever go
What the fuck is wrong with this world
I have things of the eiffel tower at night..
You can't go to jail for a copyright violation as its a civil dispute and not a criminal case
Send this video to James Rolfe, he would most likely make a You know What's bullshit?- video out of this rule.
One of the hundreds of Pathetic laws the world over!
Logan Paul did it
I just f* ckin broke the law when I was 8, on a vacation in Paris
this is stupid\n \nreally stupid
That google comment was a funny little gag, good stuff sir keep em coming
There is pictures of it at night
Lier, this is fully legal.
Stupid. We know this.  Don’t tear off the mattress tags either
You are not allowed to show the little mermaid in Copenhagen. But the people who owns it don't care. It's on tv and pictures all the time.
lol that video could have taken all of 37 seconds
Now people break laws do it not stopping anyone
Subscribe to support smaller channels!?
Lol this is fucking ridiculous and I will take as many pictures of the Eiffel tower at night if I want along with anything else in France.
pictures of the Eiffel Tower isn't illegal in the US at night because I just pulled up see some
I took a picture of the sky and a satelite came in the way. imma have to pay 20000000000000000$
... That's stupid. Copyright laws can be really stupid.
U can still see the lights during the day, but they just aren't being used. Does that mean any picture of the eifell tower is illegal?
i have seen so many pictures and videos in the dark
If you look up Eiffel tower at night on YouTube there's tons of videos showing the Eiffel tower at night.
Damn this comment section is lit
Stop freaking lying and try to indoctrinate people everything is false. I live in paris and everything are lies. Dont like the video. And also all eiffel tower merchants are illegal. This guy said exaclty the opposite of the truth
No shit\nIm still gonna take a picture of Eiffel Tower at night
Just think, in 40 or so years France will be a Muslim country it'll be trashed and Europe will be dead.
I looked Eiffel Tower and found 5 pics on the first 2 rows
what if im looking for a website for porn?
OH MY GOD THEY ARE BUILDINGS
l Tower at Night are Illegal
I mean why we complaining about Jake Pauls copyright strike wave when there are *buildings* that are copyrighted
Ok, just to clarify. Taking pictures of the eiffel tower is 100 percent okay. Also during the night. Just like you said: They don't enforce it. You know why? Because the French have to laugh at this rule too. It is considered a small flaw and ridiculous to make trouble over this. You never been to France/Paris apparently, otherwise you'll notice people filming / capturing it during evening. Heck, even the national fireworks on 14th of July, or New Year at the eiffel tower is massively photographed. Since 2016 nothing changed to that. \n\nIt's funny that you hear a flaw, but instead of checking out the rest of the reality, you just present it as a 'what if', and label it with a 'dont do it' warning, without knowing more. \nYou said: Ever noticed the absence of photo's off the eiffel tower at night? Eh? What absence. They are clearly in front of me when I type: Eiffeltower . It's everywhere. What do you mean absence.\n\nGuys, it's perfectly okay to photograph. Officially it may be illegal but they CAN'T and WONT do anythign about it. There is no way to enforce it, even in the future. Police officers won't arrest you when they find out. Nor they will ask you to remove it. The videoposter should not have blurred the buildings or tower. Nothing happens, it's just all entertainment by dramatisation. \n\nIt isnt a question wether its legal or illegal. It's accepted, because it would be strange NOT to accept it. It's permitted.\n\n\nI kinda dislike this video. Why? Because an American is telling half a story. Which isnt half as interesting if he didnt spiced it up. Hence his name probably. He tries to 'warn' people when there is nothing to warn about. It's misinformation and i kinda hate that, since everyone is so fucking gullible on youtube nowadays. Good job sir. Making the world dumber, video by video. As long as you get your revenue. amirite?
1:25 pause there and look at the comment  😂
This is fucking nonsense
Nice going France
Psh, come at me France.
Maaaan... that's bullshit. France, you weird.

'Sid, we're muslims, stop' 'Muslims dont have sex' 😂😂😂
Hi Dina. I watch your channel since the beginning. I have converted to Islam and your videos has helped me a lot since I didn't know any Muslims. I used to like you because you were humble and I used to see a good Muslim in you. However since you started mainly doing videos with Sid I find you very cynical, swearing and being rude most of the times. I don't think you are a good example for a good muslim/person anymore. I have actually unsubscribed from your channel and I just wanted to let you know, how one of your ex followers feels about your recent content. Please be more humble and don't swear as much. This behaviour is not nice at all. I know many non-muslims that are actually more humbled and charitable and generally nicer people. We as Muslims should be from the best people out there. And you don't seem like a nice person at all recently.
How to get to get flawless skin? = Genetics
This video is a mess lol
You should do more videos like this guys this was hilarious
'You look like a fat Egyptian guy' 😂😂😂😂
Dina : I just did it for the thumb-nail, now it's a waste. \nOut of 8 pic, doesn't even put it in the thumb-nail.\nEDIT Oh Dina man, you're trending again. Get ready to film another hate comment video 😂

Ur voice is soo loud deep and annoying! Bursted my ear drums!!!
Idk why he always points out things he doesn't need to. Usually mean things. Looks wise, he's quite ugly and she's beautiful. But I thought he's clearly a nice guy and that's all that matters. But in every video I've watched he'll say you look shit or something similarly rude or stupid. Almost as if now he's got her he doesn't need to always be polite. I know she's not offended by what he says and it's no big deal, it's their banter. Most men forget to show their appreciation to their partner.
You DIRTY fucking Muslim. Your horrible, bastardised English accent makes my ears bleed and on top of that, your whole fucking channel is cancer. Honestly, CANCER. I would like to watch you get fucking glutted with cement. You know the only reason you're as big as you assuredly are is because you wear a rag on your head.
Love this video so much
your not meant to cleanse soo much in one go
It's 2:00 am here and I am having laughing fits 😂
FACT: Islam is NOT a religion.\nFACT: Islam is a Godless, apostate murdering death cult, DISGUISED as a religion.\nFACT: Muhammad was a FALSE Prophet and Allah is a pagan moon god!\nFACT: Jews and Christians DENY that Muhammad was an Abrahamic Prophet of God!\nFACT: The koran is a forgery.  It was copied from the Holy Bible.\nFACT: Here are three credible sources that PROVE that Islam is a Godless LIE!
Mashallah you look very nice
still undefeated for the season hehe
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Arsenal lost 2-1 to Watford.
HAVE YOU SEEN CHELSEA LOSING TO CP ? OR ARSENAL TO WATFORD ? HELLO THIS IS REAL FOOTBALL NO ONE CAN CONTROL IT LIKE YOU DO WITH ALEX HUNTER'S JOURNY IN FIFA !
There's more than one way to skin a cat. The very best managers have the ability to chop and change tactics if required and there's no-one better than Jose. As a Liverpool fan the most important game each season is v United. It's THE Cup Final for Liverpool and they will always play 15% above themselves in this game. United have much bigger fish to fry in terms of trying to stay alive in 4 competitions with the ultimate goal of silverware in May.\n\nTherefore to go to Anfield and come away with a point, deny Liverpool fans the one win they want more than anything and make Liverpool's dream of the top 4 that little bit harder to achieve is not that bad a day's work for anyone who's heart belongs to Manchester United. \n\nAll this park the bus talk is generated by one emotion and one emotion only...................FRUSTRATION. It's 11 v 11 and Liverpool couldn't even score, never mind win. Liverpool needed the 3 points far more than United as they are already so far behind in the league, especially with it being a home game for Liverpool.  In summary.......................... Klopp 0-1 Jose.
Arsenal go foit => lost, Chealsea brave => lost, u should fire Mou , he is always set to win
Man Utd fan here. I agree with what Mourinho was saying. Watching the game, Liverpool had more possession and pressed higher, but they could not unlock our defense. Both teams were trying to nullify each other's attacks. Liverpool tried to keep the ball and pressing high when they didn't so they get the ball back. Man Utd were defending in numbers to counter-attack Liverpool, which has been a weakness of theirs. Klopp didn't risk removing a midfielder to reinforce their attack, because it meant that a space would form in the middle which would help our devastating counter-attack. He knew if we countered it would be over, so he played it safe. Both teams were defensively strong but Liverpool were poor in attack and we were waiting to attack. \n\nI don't mid the defending in numbers. What frustrated me was the sloppy passes and possession loss when we did have the ball. Our midfielders gave the ball away too much. This is why Pogba is good in counter-attacking. He has the best range of passing arguably in the world and would've been better for possession when we had possession.\n\nNevertheless, coming to Anfield is tough so a point is enough. United will be happier with the point though, especially with Liverpool's shit form. 1 win in 8 games, are you okay?
why wasn't Mata used as the creative player needed to feed Lukaku and the wingmen - Herrera and Matic could still play as holding midfilders - Jose makes no mention of Mata ?!?! stop making excuses for a lack lustre performance. why are you waiting for Klopp to allow you to win the game - is that for real from a so-called top manager
If you want to win the league. You have to try  attacking away from home to places like Liverpool,spurs,Chelsea ,arsenal and man city. These teams are almost like 4 points as the other top teams have to get a result like that too.
Oh man can't Waite for cytiy to teach him how is football fun
what a shameless complain and denying fact that Mourinho is saying  I`ve no midfielder..... but forgetting what Herrera did last year even with the 35 years old Carrick ! As a Man Utd culture of football I HATE TO WATCH SUCH GAME any more! No more bussssss in the playing field even for Man City match day or Barcelona!
Liverpool is shit. Scousers in general are born chav and smell very bad
All of you lot are fools, and bandwagoners who dont understand football, I'm sick of seeing this shit Oh Mou ruined the game - Who's the manager, who's won the lot time and time again, you fools were let down only by your expectations, and as a man utd fan, was I happy with the performance? No. Happy with the Tactics? No. Because like most of you I've been spoiled by the Sir Alex Era, so no I would never be happy. But do I understand? I do, I do understand, even though I don't agree, I understand, and I will support Mou as long as he is at the helm. The league will not be won and lost in October. If the opponent can't score they can't win. As for as many goals city have score and all the stats you like, we've score the second most, conceded the least, and let me remind you a Man City loss, just one, and a United win on any given weekend, and we're top of the league, now hows that for perspective ?
Fair play Jose altho im a united supporter Liverpool are a decent team but we still not defeated yet this season (bpl)
Nobody realizes he was trying to do a Chelsea v Liverpool at anfield 13/14......... sadly no one slipped
People don’t notice that Mourinho is scared of Klopp teams.
You always have to make the best of what you have available, OK united midfield was weak but this should have been compensated with the best attacking players.  I would have like to see martial, rashford and lukaku in the starting 11.   this takes pressure away from the weak midfield and would have forced liverpool into more defensive tactics.  I do not think mourinho works with a game to game plan.  seems to me that he thinks one game tactic fits all.  We should have burst out of the gates against liverpool and put them on the backfoot from the start.  Im not a big mourinho fan, I wanted giggs :(
I sink man u gonna sink
I see united fans on here saying that we played defensive! Lol and they call us deluded
Klop should just Thank Jose for not attacking that shity defense atleast he has another day to improve his shity team. . . .sacking is around the corner.
With the attacking power we have, I still don’t understand why Jose insists on playing so defensive against the top 6 away. It’ll be a problem for us to battle the best teams in Europe with this sort of play
Liverpool fan should listen to this interview.  it shows that klopp is slowly adapting his pressing style to be more defensively solid.  It shows that slowly he is heading toward a balance where he can keep creating and no concede to much.   If he carry's on and then adds a Van dijk and a proper striker we could be challenge.  Possibly next season. especially when you add keita to that midfield a defender and ma better striker
Chelsea united....as a Bayern Fan i lost all respect for manu... history and tradition means nothing to you i guess...never understood why they signed mourinho...
Dont worry is stil way to go
we draw? arsenal and chelsea loose and am happy
Everyone is complaining about Jose parking the bus, yet here he explains brilliantly how Klopp is no different. Klopp basically matched Jose in substitutions and tactics, refusing to make the first move to actually threaten United's defence. Especially for someone at home, lying 7th in the table and 7 points adrift, you take out Salah, Coutinho and Firmino as soon as Lingard & Rashford come on? Is this what heavy metal football looks like? It doesn't matter though. Hugging your players on the pitch instantly makes you a better manager.
Soo... basically he regrets that he didn't have Schweinsteiger. :P
Jose has found the keys to his bus I see
The truth is this, Van Gaal would not have played difensive against Liverpool neither would SAF have. Liverpool defense was shit and Jose made them look like class. As a United fan if you are not disappointed with the display and the fact that Jose went for a draw even before the game then you need to be his assistant.
Tot you'd be happy with losing 2pts against a cheap team you are a real idiot and we don't need cowards.. No chance to go to France?
The English press talks too much. Sometimes it unnecessary. He (Jose) had a game plan and he did exactly that based on the way the opponents played. A draw is always better than losing
So he waited for Liverpool to give him a chance to attack? What kind of a game plan is that???
WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN U
ramicoo bro liverpoo fans are honestly living in the past. Wake the fuck up its not 70s anymore. They are just pissed off cause they were waiting for a battering and didnt get it so they thought utd are there for the taking and even then they managed a 1 proper chance on goal by their defender for crying out loud. Where is your 120 million super star that u now wish u sold him to messilona after his memorable performance yesterday especialy the cheap dive to get a pen. FUCK OFF SCOUSERS
Mkhtaryan was useless he had no effort in him! Overated and our worse buy in 4 years!!
This result proves the only reason man utd have been on form is because they have played bottom half teams. They will lose every game against top 10 cos they're fucking shit with an arrogant black stinky cunt for a striker
Jose Borinho complaining that he doesn't have enough players haha.....Give him another £300m to spend.  He hasn't spent enough yet lol
Valuable point, against a difficult opponent away from home. For me, as a fan, it wasn't an exciting game, but I'm happy that we got a point. I'm expecting a lot more dominance from United in the Old Trafford fixture though.
Chelshit fans ranting about United parked the bus again. Chelshit played good football and got 0 points. You coudlnt simply beat Zaha. Mourinho is one of the best managers in English football. Salute from an Arsenal fan.
Liverpool fan here, of course Jose didn't play attacking here, why would he? We press high an aim for the neck, he sheltered the neck. Sure it wasn't exciting but there is 22 players on the pitch that can change that, all the managers can do is set a base, United were not good but we could not score either, they left with a point. I would take a point at OT too. Next game, let's go YNWA
This man is ruining what used to be the best fixture in the world, Liverpool vs United, he come in with a squad worth 250 million and parks the bus, its rlly depressing
am a man u fan he didnt park the bus he park a double decker bus
Klopp was the pussy if you can’t see that u have got problems
Jose had a good game plan, our players did not turn up for the game. Lukaku is a very good striker but is not that clinical for me at times. A game away if you get a single chance you must score twice. That could have changed the game completely. Liverpool could have broken up the mid 3 and played right into Jose's game plan. We were easily giving the ball away, I miss Pogba and Fellaini they dont lose the ball unnecessarily
Ryans Gigs criticised Moyes for being a 'respond to the other team' kind of coach, rather than being ManU and doing things their way. Jose does the same as Moyes, complains that the other coach doesn't let his side play, and he is some kind of super coach? Amazing.
I don't care what anyone says. But Liverpool fans who say deffo our year and try to prove that Coutinho is worth over £60m are a disgrace to football. They're just a bunch of chavs who have nothing better to do than cringe out everyone... like fuck.
He definitely go for a draw.. i can feel jose had a lot of pressure after last season.. he could have been sacked if he didnt win europa league after all the money  he spend.. so now he tried the best to not losing by parking ke train and not sacked by the bus..
People complaining ?? Looks like draw but it's beautiful 1 points, kloop worked on defending I think
Man that's an ugly shirt.
Jose Jose jose. Guardiola is playing de bryun and Silva both number 10 in midifield if Jose wants to really control the game he could have payed mata but he didn’t want to take risk. However as a Man U fan I think he did the rit thing by parking the bus. Fergi have done it, so why not Jose ?
Played for a point and can't even admit it
How is this on trending?!
LFC there for the taking and he bottled it
Fucking dickhead blaming his midfielders instead of his shite tactics. This man is a coward. Liverpool are shocking defensively, take the initiative and put them to the sword. This is cowardly. He played the same vs Southampton in the second half after going 1-0 up. Coward.
Man United manager doesn't care what fun say or think .\nThat what I like to morinho .
Everytime Arsenal depresses me, i always remember the mighty united spent 90m on a walking haircut to finish 6th and celebrate a EFL cup.
If Tony pulis, sam allardyce or sean dyche play like this and they are ridiculed and called out for ruining the game. Yet this horrible cunt mourinho does it and he is praised master tactician, genius bla bla. Get a fucking grip and pull your tongues out of his and man utd’s asses. He came for a draw that is it. Tell me any top team in the world goes out to a direct rival to get a point. I thought big bad man utd where running away with the league smashing teams? Oh ye thats right they have played nearly everybody in the bottom half of the table and the first good team they come up against and guess what they hardly got a kick of the ball. Fucking frauds
come on!!! why should he give you opportunity to counter attack????? you say they were very defensive??? come on!!! who was more defensive???
lol these reporters are out to wind up Mouringyo
he sends andreas pereira on loan and moans for having no midfield playes on bench.....pereira would have been great value in this squad.
One team wanted to win this game, embarrassing it’s hard to break down 11people behind the ball
How is 9k views in 6 hours ‘trending’
FRAUD.
morinho didn't care about fans
Arsenal lost, Chelsea lost, & b*tches complaining about Mourinho & United
Park the bus cunt.
Jose fucking coward
Good job Mourinho!
Haters - liverpool didnt win.... man utd didnt lose ==== what shit r u talking about
mourinho is a liar
Mou is classic.
1 point is still 1 point. no pobga no fellaini.
Calm down guys, Chelsea lost today......
best mourinho
Get a grip Jose!
Trending?
Terrible game
without retracts please !!
👿👿0/0:(
manu lack creative mid fielders
Jose you are talking BS. I have followed United for 28 years, and this is what you give back to our tradition. Sir Alex would never have done that. He would have gone for it, in the best of traditions of United. This is typical Jose play...
Mr. Parkinho!
Did not do the job needed during the transfer market. He should have bought 2 or 3 midfielders and atleast 2 more strikers. He bought a holding mid, a defender and a striker. Terrible mismanagement for a “topmanager” at a big club as Manchester United is. \n\nManchester United will run into the same issues as they’ve had last year. When injuries and suspensions show up the club has no back up, which will cost points. I am pretty sure that we will see more of these kind of matches if they won’t do their job the next transferwindow.
blah,blah MU didn't win bcoz pogba is injured and klopp did not go out full attack! \nmou is a shit manager!
GGMU  win lose or draw man united till i die, 20 times Champions!!! many plastic fan's (kids?) 😡😠 If you can't win, draw is good. J.M won more at Man Utd than J.K and P.G at loserpool and SHITY 😂
Back in the days he did it at Chelsea it worked because he had Drogba, who would have finished that one ‘Lukaku’ chance. Fact is he still parked a double decker! If Salah had left that ball for Coutinho this story would be different.
where was the 200 million buget team offensively? if he couldn't win this liverpool, in this form, in this period, he will never beat it.
Chicken-shit manager with chicken-shit scared defensive tactic. Nothing new from arrogant shit. Big game against big opponent and he goes defensive. His explanation is BS. He is a reactive manager. I hope City smashes them 5-0 like Barca did his Real M in 2010.
Why didn't Mourinho envisage the possibility of the formation that Klopp chose and have a mid-field  player on the bench to deal with it. Isn't that what coaches do especially the Special One? Of course he didn't come for 3 points but just the 1.
Garry Neville is full of shit.
Liverpool were all over you, \nU prick.
jose,jose, here ,over here, boring as fuck jose,man united charlatans again jose. here jose .millions spent and no joy jose. chelsea what jose, liverpool better .yes that is true. united found out again .
am so glad this bus parking man get out of my club.
KLOPP SPENT 120M SINCE OCTOBER 2015\n\n300M SPENT SINCE JULY 2016. HE'S A PATHETIC NEGATIVE FRAUD
When you play a quicker team. Start trying playing first more italian. Then play like Barca.
A 0-0 draw with Liverpool means Mourinho has now gone ten straight games without a win at Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham or Saturday’s opponents. His sides have drawn five and lost five of those games, conceding 15 goals and scoring just four times. Just one of those away goals have come since he was appointed at Old Trafford.
Meanwhile city keep bangin goals. Thats the diference between Pep and the bus driver.
Mourinho and utd..... SHIT!!!!!
Special one👏
What makes me mad is idiots that do not understand how deeply depleted the team is at this period of time, which Mourinho is trying to conceal as much as he can. Get it: no Bailly, no Rojo, no Carrick, no Pogba, no Fellaini and on top of that injured Rashford. Why Mouhrinho played defensively and Lukaku did not get service, because Mouhrinho is realistic, he got the maximum today and Lukaku had his chance to score. That is all Mkhitaryan's fault.
This shit gonna blow the fuck up when it starts playing on the radio 24/7

Is he playing this game on a console (if yes which one?) or PC?
Wow! A gamer who spreads the love of God?! Subbed! 👍🏽👌🏽🤙🏽💪🏽
THIS is how this game is meant to be played. Amazing!

That was Leonardo Davici shit right there
If the timer on the storm was slower to enjoy more intricate gun play I'd still be playing but I'ma hop back on world of tanks
honestly, it doesnt help your content very much to drop keys in every video, it brings around a bad crowd that isnt here for your content, but your keys. id say stop doing the keys for a good while, and see who actually stays, thats a good way to have a real community and audience. like me, i really enjoy your content, but the talk about keys in every video, makes you sound desperate. which is fine, its youtube, but it really would attract a better crowd if you didnt try to drop so many keys.
Can they not just break the bottom of the Base? ??
Love watch your videos keep up the content
Battle royale turned into a church service
You have a little over 500likes (sarcasm) I liked the vid btw

Mine will read, Trump 2020
Michael Bisping cries as he strikes you.
GSP is arguably the greatest athlete to have ever entered the octagon, but he doesn't have head for it, physically, his face breaks up very easily,  and I think his brain is going to be affected.
Georges “ drago “st pierre. “ i will breaaak you”
GSP is going to crack Bisping so hard, that he’ll fix his fucked up eye!
GSP is going to straighten Bisping's crooked eye with his jab.
Every time it’s 100% touching George first. Fk outta here Mike.
I will bgrreak you man!!
I love GSP i support him forever, He is a nice guy... Bisping is a garbage
Bisping needs to feel animosity, I get it
All Bisping is doing is attempting to increase those PPV buys, and you fucks are taking the bait. He has always played the villain. Now people will pay for a chance to see him get beat up. \n\nGod knows this is the only way to sell a GSP fight anyway.
It broke my heart when that kid ran away when GSP offered to take a picture.
Fuck you Bisping don't fuck gsp, nov4 you will get knock out!
That kid got scared and ran away lmaoo
I'm British and I fucking hate bisping
Pissing off GSP is never a good idea....ever.
Bisbing who ...omg 1 year of success...bout damn time.....GSP has a long history of fighting great fights who were in there prime bisbing got lucky he even won the belt
Don’t like either of them. This is fake.
GSP: I will touch you! I will Break you! lol
Bisbing trying hard to see a fight.
Bisring lol what a fool.look at the state of him...
Fuck hem..he is a bully!!! Not a fighter..all this fightdrs are bad for the sport..!!!!diaz is a bully..cooner is a acktor!!!tony is a gangsta not a fighter!!no respekt no humble no sport..this are All punks!!!
you Go GSP!\nbisping is a coward and loser😁😂😃😄\ntotally fake and doesnt know how to fight what a loser bro
They’re trying their best too hype this fight lol
Great example for the kids. Where's the sportmanship gone. Oh yeah it will miracously reappear when the fight is over. They have milked the chumps for their money time to be friends now
Best not to get gsp pissed off
Gsp saying fuck off is actually badass hahah I wish gsp cusses more. Now I really want tos we the fight after this video😝
Poor gsp...he felt bad cussing in front of the kid you could tell. I'm a bisping fan but hes takin it a bit far
The kid was like i don't want a picture anymore your crazy maaan🏃🏻
I hope GSP fucks up Bisping's other eye so he'll look normal.
Yup Bisping is getting knocked out. After GSP wins he should say I'm not impressed with your performance.
Bisping loves being the dick, but if you have half a brain you can see he is trying to get georges riled up because he isnt as aggressive as most opponents so its all mental game plan, bisping has said many times he respects the guy so all this is an attempt at breaking him down before the fight
gsp looks like hes gonna kill him with a knife if he touches him lol
Bisping is the one that needs to control himself.
This needs to be retitled to Bisping vs GSP. Dudes earned the A side here
I see only one idiot with no respect and it isn't gsp. Knock this clown out for good please
that poor little id ran away because both cant control themselves in public :( Not really great is it for a role model and fighter to leave that impression on a 7 year old fan .. hope its a double KO
i hope gsp shuts up bisping. dudes the only one trying to start anything between them for ppv buys. wolf tickets
Lmao @ the lil kid running away from George at the end
Did u see the kid run!!! lol
bisping is fucking embarrassing. you've fucking run from the top contenders at middleweight. you only fought Silva et al. when they where past it.
Bisping: Control yourself you little etc.\n\nMichaels making himself look bad. Maybe it's his one eye, but can he not see that he's the one that needs controlling?
pisping is a real piece of shit and worst shit talker.
Bisping is so triggered when he talks so much shit.
Bisbing. Being Such a dick. Save all the bs for the cage. How bitter sweet and poetic Justice will it be when GSP kicks your English ass.
Before everyone gets their panties in a twist, Bisping is just hyping the fight for fuck sake. He's making it seem as though he has some beef with George, when in reality he probably likes and definitely respects him a great deal. But the fact is he's fighting him, and the more interest he can stir up for the fight the more money he makes as champ with a ppv percentage..
The kid running away is not only hilarious but makes a statement about how kids know things we forgot. He wants nothing to do with people that act like that. Hyping the fight, people keep saying. That's just someone being a turd of a person, repeatedly.
Where’s the casual fans thinking that Bisping is copying McGregor??
There just trying to hype the fight
Bisping is full of shit he goes on about GSP touching him. Moron you touched him first
Fuck off.... I will break you!!!!
Bisping is the one touching george first! He's a fucking antagonising prick! I think everybody would react the same by pushing Bisping away after being touched, Practice what you preach Mr Bisping.
The name Michael Bisping will always be remembered as the British scumbag that represented himself, his country and his family like a disgusting disgraceful piece of shit. Pure dog shit. His kids are gonna turn out to be pieces of dog shit just like their scum father.
Damn gotta give it to bisping hes selling this fight but anyways hope gsp wins hes the original ppv king without all the talking anyways so this should be quite lucrative
i sincerely think he is afraid, those reactions...dont touch me dont touch me! trowing punches and shit.. this is real bully stuff.\nAwkward and cringy moment with the child at the end of the video by the way, soooo many embarrasing moments from this guy, @TMZSports how about a video? cheeeeers
What a fake world has become ufc
GSP isn't backing down. He's standing his ground against this bully Bisping.
There is a video I remember I watched few years ago about Gsp and karma watch it
Can't wait for Bisping to flatten this french speaking cunt
Mike, you look stupid when you act tough, not GSP, who doesn't do that. You have no idea how silly and retarded you sound.
Why are ufc fighters above the law? If you threat someone in public, thats illegall. Yes, we all know its an act, but common people dont know, like that little scared kid in the store!
Everyone should love George. Great example Of choosing to be a great human being by never sinking down to another person’s level, Treat those with dignity even if they’re ignorant enough to not treat you with dignity.
Come on people, Bisping is hyping the fight! He’s generating interest by doing these antics.
Gsp is a no good cheating dog, i hope Bisping breaks his whole face.
Bisping's nickname should be Dead-Eye!
Michael bisping vs gsp awesome fight
I WILL BRÈQUE YOU.
Fack Aff man I will bghreak you 😂
Bisping stfu your shit you ugly cunt
Gsp swearing is fkn awesome, seeing him trash talking seriously, is actually bad ass
McNugget And Mayweather kinda killed promoting fights....
i hope michael wins
Fake
Pathetic.
I Must Break You - GSP
bisping is a flog
fakk off man
Such class
Suck each other off already
Yo GSP cussing is the funniest shit ever
HEYYYY FUCK AFFFF MAN ! XD
Don't touch me maaan
GSP is a legend

BISPING YOU BITCH YOU
Gsp reminds me of karate kid
Yea fuck off man.

Gsp scared the hell outta... A kid... Lmao
GSP cussing makes me keep grinning
Delusional bisping.
Lambs eye
bisping is fucking cringe
Mad respect to GSP.
Yah fuck awf man
Fuck off!!!
Ay fack off man !
Fuck tmz tho still
BISPING IS A ROUGH LAD AHA
All Bispings doing is getting under GSPs skin. He does it so easily, why is GSP biting so hard
Gsp is gonna smash bisping..
As usual, I underestimated how long the podcast would take to upload, but it's already available at www.showmakers.fm, and will be on the youtube channel soon.\n\nPlease check out Brilliant too, it's a fantastic site and fits my channel perfectly: http://bit.ly/2xDcRNe
When created, RODS FROM GOD.
Big fan of your channel, was just wondering if you could do a video on the offshore floating wind farm that's being built in Scotland
Should work great in orbit with a small nuclear reactor as the power source.  Subzero temps, low level of O2 defensive means to ICBM’s and space junk.
Is it possible to convert heat into electricity?
It's already in service on a naval ship.
Portable railgun, https://youtu.be/FILJznSr6fs
The book “Ghost Fleet” features the Zumwalt class with a rail gun in a future war against China. Fiction but based on actual technology and politics.
Nice one - what you built here is just great
Sellout Mr. Theeta?
https://goo.gl/rM7CTt
Do a video on the BFR SpaceX
I'm a simple man; I see railgun, I hit like.
might as well just further improve long range laser beam thing thingy turret thing
Ey mate I like that you introduce all this cool science stuff and even give US a Chance to try it out. Almost majes me feel Bad that im such SMA dumbo
Does not seem like rail guns are the solution to much of anything. Rail guns require an impressive power source, whereas chemicals are so much more simpler. In fact the good solution seems to be liquid propellant. Also you get such diminishing returns in high velocity because air resistance goes up so fast relative to velocity.
why do u need this when i could just flick a coin up and make a finger gun
This gun is the armor killer
This technology was already used in Final Fantasy 8. Esthar  scientists shot Squall and Rinoa into space to Lunar Station.
Your voice reminds me of someone from FNV: Honest Hearts, Follows-Chalk I think
cowardice america needs desperate hype advertising-we need minimum of 50 allies or no war =cowards and hype to cloak lackey truth
us ships will crash into each other as always...not a prob\n\nor on island\n\nor on pelicans\n\non basically everything
REGION LOCK THIS FOR KOREA!!!!
Is It just a metal stick or does It have any gunpowder in It?
soon: solar powered renewable warfare
One EMP blast and its useless
Narrated by Tom Branson.
The second biggest boondoggle after the F-35\nLiterally the heat is melting the rails...limiting the rail gun to a few shots before it breaks...LOL
Isn't easier to make stronger bullts
Real talk for a sec, without even watching the video i can tell its bullshit because the actual most powerful gun is secret.
Late to the party. China has bigger better faster guns then US. Which explains why American just floated around SE chinasea and now just talk w NK. Lol they are laughing like the rest of the world. Funny how Americans just talk and no more walk.
Going to the last part of the video (the advert)\nAh yes- something that is missing in pretty much all schools:\nIf you made a mistake- be told why it's wrong.
I want to learn more about engineering. I don’t know nearly enough.
1:13 the explosion is from an underwater nuclear test (1946)
the LaWS is wayyyy coooler
BAE Systems 😩👌
okke
Fuck this
Dilbert would be proud
Neat
0:26 ACCUREH
Great Irish channel!
CLICKBAIT
False: Chuck Norris is most powerful gun
who the hell needs universal healthcare anyways?
Shoot Someone with it
Yes, I understand some of these words
Forget railguns. we already have the technology to finish operation: Star Wars
I have a rail gun on gta 5
Whether you love the US or hate the US we are the best chance Ally countries have at surviving war regardless of how crappy our leadership is at the moment. I'm so glad I live in the USA! Very interesting video btw!
Make it like the mini gun roataing barrles. In masseffect there guns use two barrles to help cool the gun before it overheated. So make our rail gun like a mini gun.
Most powerful pfft my farts is the clear winner
Okay but when will we be running around in Power Armour carrying a small one of these at our waists and ripping through aliens and shit like in Halo
BAE systems is not from usa DUH
1:27 why did you use Angola as target example, that's very rude and offensive
Make a video about Gas propulsion Engine
Nice video.\nInteresting how you showed bombarding Angola during the range comparison
A railgun? Now all you need is a Metal Gear to carry it.
Effectively a rail gun is the Justice League Space Station that orbits earth. Using the Stations mega gun requires the entire stations energy, and once fired, shuts down the station of all electric power for the next hour. It only retains orbit via emergency backup generators. Wow.
*generic comment about the US military that makes me an expert
Subscribe to my channel CJ Collins
Trump is America's most powerful gun, because he destroys anything he gets near!
At least it's not 1.21 gigawatts.
No better catalyst for technological advances than war
Yes..... The perfect thing to wipe out humanity from the face of the earth.
I think all guns bombs and weapons *not knifes* should be thrown away crushed and then thrown into the ocean for a long away generation to find then blow up the planet and not us :) im **copyright cannot show** and i think the government are stupid in some ways
Their most powerful weapon is not confront strong countries. Only peasants in Afghanistan and Vietnam.
The US military's most powerful gun... built and designed by the British.
5:28 We'll also need them for the covenant.
now do Germany
Lets make a mini dearh star!!

Leave Angola alone!
2:45 fuck that screen
Was that a nuke 1:17
25 megawatts of power. 25 megawatts, 25 megawatts. \nOh boy Einstein....
You said the current rail only lasts a few shots, that is incorrect.  It lasts hundreds of shots but it is short of the qualitative requirement for 1000 shots.
A rail gun?? What’s next a metal gear
I'm sure it can be built in less than 50 years.
The U.S. militaries technology is at least 20 years ahead of a US regular folks technology. Of course THEY want THEM to believe this is the best THEY have.
Why, when on restricted mode, can't I view this video? It's more about math and magnetism than war, and destruction.  Come on youtube!  Keep working on these, Real Engineering! Your videos are awesome!
Similar to the MAC cannon from halo
Except there are treaties about the militarization of space, as in you can't, and railguns wouldn't be allowed most likely
So...the man-portable railgun from MGS4 is probably not practical in the slightest, then
Considering there's talk about an asteroid the size of a country has a chance to hit us, having a giant railgun in space isn't a bad idea
I used to live like 50 steps from the military base that they shot this video at dalgren naval base in Virginia
Say don’t rail guns also work in space because no explosion is necessary?
I would consider the atomic Annie to be the most powerful gun to be honest.
Can you do an episode about different was to extract oil/gas from the ground? Feel like you would like learning about it, if you don't know much already
Anyone else notice the Canadian flag at 0:51
Wouldn't the acceleration at the moment of the shot destroy a satellite that was to be sent to orbit by it?
A Certain Scientific Railgun. Always comes to my mind whenever I hear, or think of Railguns.
Imagine this going through your body *ROBLOX OOF*
2:25 wrong way around, the current should be flipped. Fleming left hand rule. This isnt a generator.
Add 0.1th of a gram of antimatter on the tip of a round and you can practically destroy a tank or a house with one shot from a handgun.
What is the effect of a massive EMP on one of these railguns?
What about a tungsten coating or alloy to offset the thermal problem, or even using a liquid nitrogen cooling system?
Could something like this be applied to a rifle design?
Be care full not to explain it to deeply otherwise your enemy will use it against you
Most likely wouldn’t be heard in the comment section but this is how I would solve for the rods constantly destroying itself.\n\nConductive oil/lubricant. Or even lubricant or oils.
Melanie's yawn in the beginning was contagious. 😳
Hey Melanie, you're not the only one who does their eyebrows last. 😂 I always do them last.
It's so funny though, without make up you look even more alike :D\nSooo cute
TEAM JESSIE, ALWAYS EYEBROWS FIRST 💁🏻
Your reaction at 5:27 when Melanie was talking about her boyfriend hahahaha
I do my brows first and then clean it up with concealer... melanie you’re crazy😂
I can't do eyebrows or eyeshadow before foundation and stuff. I HAVE to do my base first 😂
I don't do my make up the Melanie way or Jessie Way as i am i lad who doesn't where make up i am afraid
Stopped listening to Melanie when Jessi was doing her brows - I was mentally cheering her on so hard, I had to go back and find out what Melanie said 😂
As a guy I could shower, brush my teeth, get dressed, have breakfast, and still have 5 minutes to spare before this video finished.
This is EXACTLY what my tired ass needed to get up outta bed and make some coffee. Thank you Jesse and Melanie! You've allowed for one more human in this world to become fully functional (almost) ;)
I do it slightly more like Mel. I do foundation, concealer etc, then brows, then eyes, and then finally mouth.
I do my eyes, liner and lashes first than my face than eyebrows than lips😂
i do my makeup literally exactly the same as melanie hahaha
Haha for the first 10 seconds I thought they were speaking another language
I definitely do mine Melanie's way, is that weird?
omg jessie where is your shirt from?? i love it!!!
Aw bless yas! Spit of each other but a blue eyed and a green eyed version ; ) xx
i do makeup in melanie’s order!
The order I do my makeup is- \nprimer, \nfoundation, \nconcealer, \ncream highlight, \npowder to set concealer. (My face is dry so I don't usually powder it.) \nbronzer/contour, \nblush,\nBrows,\nEye shadow,\nSetting spray\nLiner,\nMascara,\nLips. \nAm I forgetting something?
I wish I would look like youuuu
Idk why but when Melanie says i need to look less dead, i think i look very ghostly, it just made me laugh so much!!😂😂😂
haha this is such a cool video idea, loved it! 😌
I do green concealer, foundation, regular concealer, powder, eyebrows, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, then lipstick.
You two have such lovely personalities💓
“Get off me wench” ~Melanie 2k17\nI’m using that on my sister form now on
After having a mental crisis this mornin i thought id watch your videos to help cheer me up and its done wonders. Thankyou both xxx
Always the Melanie way 💃🏼😂!! X
I do my make up in the same order as Melanie but also have been told I'm mad for doing so!!
I do my makeup the exact same order as Melanie's
Melanie, I do my makeup the same as you!! 😂😂👊🏼💜
Jackie Aina taught me to do concealer first and not blending it, doing foundation and then blending concealer last as it increases coverage when it dries a bit!
YALL MAY THINK YOU LOOK ROUGH BUT YALL STILL LOOK WAAAY MORE SEXY THAN I DO WHEN I'M HUNGOVER WITH MY HEAD IN THE TOILET XX
Haha it's so strange to see what order others do their makeup :) I always start with eyebrows, then eyeshadow and will then finally go onto my base makeup 😂
I agree with everything Melanie's saying & doing about her makeup😹💓
Love you guys so much 💖
I do it like Melanie hahaha
I do my makeup the exact same order as melanie, can't draw brows to save my life otherwise lol
I do brows 2nd! Foundation 1st and then concealer 3rd. Then blush etc., eyes and then lips
Haha cmon, there's no wrong way in which order you do your makeup :D it's completely p to you :D silly Mel! And about your question.. well, it depends. When I'm in a rush, like the very early morning when I'm trying to save every second just for longer sleep I do my brows first, and then mascara, basically the most important parts of my face so if I ran out of time I could go at leas with my eyes done or something like that. But when I have a lot of time I put all my foundation concealer etc. stuff first. It's actually better for me to do my brows after foundation etc. because I'm not afraid that I'll have to do some touch ups after or smudge perfect brows or something like that :) Damn, that's a long comment!
Melanie: like when i went to Spain to see my boyfriend...\n **Jessies face @ **5:28**** \n\nLMAO AHAH <3
When Mel talks I have to turn the sound up and when Jessie talks I have to turn it WAY back down again hahaha
Me today !!! Love you girls
I do my makeup, when I do it, the Melanie way!
I always do my eyebrows last 😂😂 the only way I can do it !
I do Melanie's way and I see I also uses most of the products she uses :)
I do mine the same as Melanie💁🏻😂❤️
I do my makeup the same way as Melanie 😂
Literally do my makeup a different every day 😂 I’m with Melanie if I have a new product I want to get it on my face asap 💚
Omg I say this on every collab, but how I WISHED I had a sister !! Ur relationship is so nice, I always wanted a sister :'( hahaha
i do my makeup in the exact same order as Melanie minus the blush because i don’t use blush haha
iLife my everyday makeup I use concealer, powder, bronzer, blush, highlight, brow gel, and mascara it takes no time because I would rather sleep before school but when I have time I put effort and I do the full sha bang
hahaha your intro made me yawn
Ngl I yawned too
Foundation, concealer, powder, contour, blush, highlight, eyes, eyebrows, lips, mascara
You both look amazing!
My makeup steps:\nPrimer\nFoundation\nEyeshadow \nBrows\nMascara\nContour/blush/bronze\nLips
Pray for us #HurricaneOphelia
MORE.VIDS.TOGETHER.OMG LOVE YOUS
love thisss plz do more vids like it
7:30 xD
The order I go in is pore balm, whitening primer, cushion foundation, eyebrows, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlight, lips.
You girls should be models😱😍❤
Lol, i don't even have a routine, i just go with what ever haha
i have to do eyebrows first 😂
Jessie that highlight is popping!! And i always do my eyebrows first too! :)
Those pencils you use freak me out.  I would 100% stab myself in the eye every time!  I do not have steady hands. :S
Jessie B where's the dress/top that you wear in Melanie's video from?! the strIPES!!!
I do my makeup like jess brows then foundation concealed etc. I do lips or highlight last :)
Hahaha Melanie had a big drop of bb cream on her neck the entire video 😂😂 BTW I do my makeup like Melanie 😊
You two are the prettiest sisters 😍😍 love both of you and your videos 😗
I really want to get into makeup but I just don't know where to begin 😒
I always do my makeup the way Melanie done it. I can't function without having my base down first
Actually just started my period today for the first time in over a year (pcos) and I am miserable so I'm glad you updated today! Hope you're having a beautiful day lovely 💛💛
You should never say 'I'll only have a few drinks'! Such a bad plan, never works.  Still, they're often the best nights.
I know I'm super late but I just want to say thank you for uploading today I had a really bad day anxiety wise and really needed something to make me smile this video did that for me I love you both so much ❤️
You guys are so beautiful on the inside and outside even when you're hungover xx
YES GIRLIES!!!!!!!!!!
I thought it said get UNready with us after a night out! That would be a funny video seeing yous drunk trying to take off your makeup haha!x
MY BEAUTIFUL GIRLS 😩😩😩😍 Jessieee we haven’t talked in a CENTURY I MISS YOU 😭 Also sorry but I literally do my makeup i the EXACT order as Mel and I’m actually shook, what. As always I LOVEEE the video and I’m so happy to see y’all together again ❤️❤️ Also Mel has a longer face but, Jess, yours is wider 😂👍🏻
I just want to hang out with you guys.
both of you have beautiful eyes💎
Oh I love this video you two are my favessss 🙌🏻 I did my make up whilst watching this it felt like when I do my make up w my best friends & we're all sharing products & judging each other's methods 😅 Your face when you got given that contour brush is me when I get any exam results 😂👌🏻is this a joke... is this actually a joke 😂😂🙈 It sounds like you had a great night before filming this video 😉👌🏻 Love ya ❤️
Love you guys sooo much! Great videoo💓

I wish I had a sister! You guys are the best. And I totally do my makeup like Mel.
where is you jumper from Jessie? I love it xxxx
you are both even more beautiful without makeup omg you are like flawless natural beauties <3
This video is hilarious :-)
My makeup order is base first and then eyebrows. If I do eyebrows first then I end up accidently erasing them when I do my foundation. Haha I guess I don't have Jessie's makeup skills. You both look gorgeous by the way, both pre and post makeup.
Team Melanie on the makeup order!!! All my friends think I'm so weird!
OHHH YESS THE SISTERS ARE BACK BITCHES💗💗 love this ...I only watch your make up videos I don't do my make up but I love watching yours ...you girls pull off the hangover look well 😍🙊🙏 hope you had a mint week Jessie xx

I actually like John legend as a person hope he don't go and say some next shit like most these black entertainers does
disgusting… i’ve never seen a music video to be more racist towards white people and people who support our countries leader

Chance should’ve been in the video, but still 10/10 video and song
This is the John Legend I know.
Ever since he shitted on Kanye publicly I can't stand this dude... Like he put you on my yute. Chance fucks with him n ain't come crazy like u did... Humble ya self my mans
Only in a perfect 🌎 ......
I fux wit both them but this shit boring and chance that flow is washed. Just talking on the beat ain't cuttin it.
I don't understand
Heard it first at the Paris concert. Great song
Funny how YouTube hasn't recommended this once because I'm guessing it's too political for their Disney channel beliefs. So shameful because these two are some of my favourites! Great song and great message! SCREW YOUTUBE
I’m loving this and chances part 🤗🤗🤗
I love the message of the song
John was a Legend since Get Lifted!!!🔥🔥🔥👑👑👑
So damn good! Thanks for letting me know about it on your Instagram live ♥️♥️♥️
John Legend would totally hate this, but all I kept thinking was “Arthur” with him in those round glasses
Greatest video I have watch yet ❤️😍
John's voice is just so powerful
Can someone please explain to my slow ass what the video ment?
The Song is Cathy

I always find that both sides hate the other and preach about how they want to come together on their own terms, each side wanting  them to join their political ideologies in order to even converse with them, rather than put them aside and come together. I like this.

A little extreme for trending, this sort of thing is what you go and find if your into it.
did any people died ?
that's a stupid driver and elliot moose have in comment: idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot!
I like the disintegrating cars.
rocket man hit that car like he was wire guided
they should just ban driving, there
One schmuck is leading the green and the other is trimming the red--what did you THINK was going to happen?!
Dear Russia your not exposed to have kids with your brother or sister cuz it sure seems like you guys do
The drivers may be retardet (sic), but your spelling is retarded.
Damn I would hate to live in Russia
Lol, I think you are the retardet person here xD
Russia love car crash.
What idiots learn to drive
WTF😱😱😱😱
But yeah it’s true automatic cars cannot be controlled @ higher speeds when braked in emergency 🚨
asuu lo a aplastado \n😱😱😱😨
I am just wondering from where do russians get their driving license
wow... the fuck is wrong with these people?
@5:02 they steered into the crash. So dumb
Every single one of these accidents could have been avoided.

i have anxiety and emetophobia. my anxiety makes me nauseous, and my phobia of vomiting makes me more anxious when i feel nauseous, which makes me even more nauseous. it's a vicious cycle.
I developed anxiety attacks over a long period of time that came to a head many years ago when I had one of several panic attacks.  After dealing with this for over a decade, a new thing happened: agoraphobia.  I now don't leave my apartment unless I absolutely have to.  I no longer grocery shop nor do even go for a casual walk as each of these cause anxiety and panic - and for no known reason at all.  I take an SSRI daily but that doesn't do much except even out my moods so I no longer feel particularly happy or overly sad about anything as a result.  The worst part about this: I'm not alone.  There are so many others in the same situation as I am where our quality of life has been dramatically compromised.  I've lost most of my friends (since I can't visit them nor can I go out with them anymore for fun).  I certainly haven't met anyone that I could share my life with (how could I).  I buy most of my food at a convenience store because it's close by and I can quickly go there, grab something and come home again.  This is my life, or more accurately, my existence.  Anyone that thinks those of us that suffer with this _want_ to be like this are the ones that need to have their head examined.  Often, we are told that we need to pull our socks up, man-up, get over it, etc., or are asked things like What are you afraid of? Do you think people are watching and whispering? What is your problem? and don't understand when they get answers like I don't know what there is to fear: nothing, as far as I know.  This just happens.  No I don't think people are staring and whispering; I'm not paranoid or suffering delusions.  If I knew what my problem was do you not think I'd have addressed it already head on?  Then they wonder why we get upset and don't want to be around them.  To make this problem even worse, none of us experience this the same way.  One person's experience with anxiety and panic could be radically different from my own.  Sadly, we're all treated the same way.  Broken.
i figured i was going to comment along the lines of what a load of bollocks!\nbeing somebody who suffers anxiety for a host of reasons, along with depression, i get a bit sick of the whole change your diet, think positive! type of crap that appears on the net. \nyou didnt do that. \nthankyou!

QUESTION TIME!!! XD\nWhy do I love doing puzzles since I'm terrible at them?\nAlso where did all of the stereotypes about women wanting Make up and cars and hot boys more than gender equality or even common sense?\nIf you answer any of these then I will be the happiest person on earth. Thanks\n-Ozeroo

7 Million world wide or in the US alone?
0:4 whether writing an exam or when your crush doesn't care you exist and he is standing right next to you
What always amazes me is that I'll have these thoughts tormenting me, and then suddenly they just disappear--poof! My brain is calm.  It is like something pops, and it is over.
Why do we have appetite? And why are we slaves to our appetite?

I am so anxious  not to say something wrong in class because it will make everybody laugh... I am the only child in my class to be anxious with all the test and even daily lessons because I feel like I will not have study enough and in this way I would dissapoint my teachers... Once I got a 17 out of 20 in a test and I did not want to go to school for one week because I felt useless and that if somebody sees me, I thought they will laugh at me...
i make A S M R  relaxation videos to help people with anxiety.. hugs hugs to all that have anxiety problems.. I have it badly too   :(

God, watching this video made me anxious
I’m 18 and my boyfriend was just in a terrible car accident killing his best friend and leaving himself in a coma. I was wondering if you guys could do a video on traumatic brain injuries? More specifically diffuse axonal brain injuries please.
Hey I'm new here so I'm not sure if you've done a video on this but I think it would be really cool if ya'll could do a video on how experiences in childhood affect your life and relationships later on.
Why do we pass out when we lock our knees for extended periods of time? Please like this if you agree.
Maybe because assholes with power and money constantly have to make life difficult for the rest of us.

Life is hard when even your anxiety has anxiety.
What if I'm just not hungry? Is it bad for me?  I'll only eat dinner, once a day. I'm just not hungry throughout the day.

My anxiety gets exponentially worse when I’m on dates. I could be having an amazing time with someone I like but I’ll ruin it for myself.

The serotonin cycle gets disturbed if Magnesium levels are low in our body. That creates so many disorders starting from acidity, gastritis to anxiety and depression etc...\n\nIf Magnesium levels are proprly maintained, there won't be any anxiety and magnesium supplementation is the best solution to GAD.
Study always makes anyone full of anxiety so, I make videos that simplifies study concept in less than 2 minutes. Please support my channel.

I hate when people try to discredit my anxiety by saying, “It’s normal! I get super anxious all the time too!” 😐
Talk about how society started using the word triggered all of a sudden...

Do IT when it comes out
124) No topless scene for Sandra. 8:28 Those babies were perfect!
To the question  of whether or not Jason is a ghost,  he's  a revenant, an undead that comes back for revenge. They comeback stronger, faster and just as smart as they were when they were alive. They also use weapons.
16:51
The opening scene is supposed to take place two months after the events of the first movie and then fast forward 5 years for the main part of the movie.
Please do Wonder Woman. Even though its an amazing movie
Can you please do 'Everything wrong with Clowntergeist'? \nOh! And your videos are hella awesome, btw! Love every single one of them!
Everything Wrong With Meet The Robinsons
I will be great at Cinemasins after watching so many of your videos, now every time i watch a movie i keep searching for sins and with few minutes ding  .
All movie Friday the 13th
I know I say this every time, but I think this might be my fave Sins ep ever! LOL
Wtf I was wondering why I stopped getting your videos recommended turns out I was unsubscribed. The heck YouTube
Do a vid on the new IT
Wait they sinned the movie because her memories we're clearer while dreaming than when awake?....but isn't that a actual thing? Because y'know..... your subconscious and stuff...
You should do one on the Netflix movie The babysitter
I want to see Everything Wrong With Annabelle: Creation!
YouTube video sin guy thinks he knows EVERYTHING about movies.
Please do the it movie 🎈
you have to do alllllll the fridays
Do you like any movie??
You should do the Netflix original the babysitter
You need to do everything wrong with CinemaSins part 2! Nobody is without sin, even you.
Shouldn’t this have been published on the 13th if the movies about Friday the 13th
Funny because I watched this yesterday. Before watching this.
Where is EWW Death Note? Seriously, that would compensate the time I wasted watching this shitty excuse of a movie.
This may be the worst movie that you have gone over on your channel
McLaren F1 you sat in the middle of the car.  Just saying.
see yall next year for friday the 13th #3.
Well, Vickie wasn't running anywhere with a slashed quad muscle.
Why killed mark , he’s disabled :(
SIN!!!! sandra had the hottest tits and never took her to off
6:10 That's something a lot of bitches need to learn.
if Jason drowned,how the fuck does he look like a fuckin burn victim !!
How come you did a vid on this 1 day before Friday the 3th
Evrything Wrong With Friday the 13th Part 3 coming in Oct 2020 ?
11:59 Somebody never watched the movie Scream
speaking of nipples, anyone notice that when a girl in a movie or show shows her breasts, only the nipples are really blurred out and you can still kinda see the rest of the cleavage while guys on the other hand, if they take off their shirt nothing is censored, sooooo man nipples are ok? what if you put a man's nipple on top of a girl's nipple, would they still censor it? :/
Wait a minute, I sense pee behind me! \nYes hello I'd like to organize a funeral, because I'm fucking dead.
Nice to know that fight gave you a boner 😂
God dammit one day early are you kidding me.
That was a good movie! And that one girl in particular had a great ass! :)
Zero black people in this film. Wow. It sure was a different time back then!
I am struggling through part 3 of this series... are you going to do part 3 soon?!? Its painful.
14:01 the narrator says Jason slams his pitchfork into the MIDDLE of the car roof, a location where no driver has ever sat in the history of cars.  I'm giving this video a sin for the narrator having never heard of the Mclaren F1, which definitely has the driver's seat in the middle of the car, with a passenger seat on either side.  The car in the movie is obviously no Mclaren F1, but still the whole in the history of cars part is bullshit.
The 80's, cocaine
Do Hacksaw Ridge pls
Do it
Do Halloween (1978) please!!!

5:02 The pebble clearly hits her right cheek, yet she grabs her left. Trust me, I checked. +1 Sin!
cloth remember knee bet food child top future corporation.
Do everything wrong with the babysitter
Every thing with IT
By the way if you ever do the third one could you please bring up the news reports\nIf you listen closely to one of the news reports Jason apparently engaged in cannibalism and sexual mutilation \nI don't remember anything like that occurring in part 2 but then again we never did find out what happened to Paul so\nHOLY GINGERFUCK JESUS!
I would pay GOOD MONEY for Jeremy to  do the entire dance scene of this film with 50 Cent as the soundtrack!
Everything wrong with Jason takes Manhattan
no jason made a shack in the woods but when he fond his mother she was fighting alice than alicw chop of her head
*N*\n*I*\n*P*\n*P*\n*L*\n*E*\n*S*
i love the Swingers reference at the end.
@7:52 he calls Paul Ted I’m sinning you Cinemasins *CinemaSins ding*
Remove 1 sin for every nipple scene. Please. Soft-core porn was tough to come by in the early 80's.
I love that you used a clip from Club Dread at the end there. Haha!
Nipples
I think the biggest sin is the fact you uploaded this the day before Friday the 13th.
This was made on my b day
Can we Get a translation for 9:32?
in it's defense this movie might be the origin of the cat scare it wasn't cliche yet.\n\nAm I the only person that was really depressed that the paraplegic guy never got laid? :(
''only two cars? how the hell did everyone get there?'' JEREMY THE HITCHHIKED?!
14:35 wait a minute I sense pee behind me lol😅

Sri Lankan Elephant Chasing Due To Foolish Activity. plz skip the button http://1ink.cc/WEu4
123
Hilarious as always, but you should have taken one sin off for that awesome shot near the end where Ginny is standing in a apparently-safe room and you can see Jason running toward her through the window behind her. One of the best shots in horror film history, imho and according to reviewers.
3:15 WOAH! o.0 that looks EXACTLY like my cat 0.o
I love how even in low light you can see that Nic has really beautiful and well taken care of skin, not just throwing some moisturizer on like most gurus who sctually have awful skin without their 1000 watt, full coverage and filter trickery.
Am I the only one left that applies makeup with my fingers..for everything?
You should do a review of some of Storybook Cosmetics products!
Please help! I the a slightly oily skin, with fry patches! I just brought some benefit foundation (hello) and it looks lovely when I put it on but going really patchy after an evening out! I like a good coverage but don’t know what else to try! X
Your eyes are like flames, so beautiful
Argh I'm still so in two minds about Fenty. I don't understand how some people hate it and some people can make it look amazing!
I wonder if you mix a little moisturizer with the foundation to make a BB cream would it work better?
How do you keep your skin soooo smooth and youthful?
Can you review the Claudia Schiffer Make Up line as well? :D Thank you!!
NARS  would be my pick especially as it relates to dry skin
Would you review Kevyn Aucoin if you haven't already?
This was great Nic, you gave a thorough and fair review. I love that you roadtested the products for a day before. I'd like to see you review Makeup Revolution, I love their gold chocolate bar eyeshadow palette, their double ended eye liner pen and the palette they did with British Beauty Blogger. Thanks. Xx
I love this channel and you girls are amazing, but that contour looks terrible, it's like thick patches of dirt.
Love this review Nic! Really useful. Thanks :) also, may be a really stupid question, but how do you work out your skin tone? I always struggle matching foundation. I don't know if my skin is warm, cool, yellow or pink undertones etc. And different make up stands tell me different things! Thanks xx
Pls review hudabeaty cos I feel she’s overhyped. Swatched her palette and it was so disappointing
A video using several Clinique products would be great. I rarely ever see videos with their products included, and I'd love to know which of their non-foundation products are good!
PLEASE can you guys do a review on THE ORDINARY FOUNDATION & the GLOSSIER  products xxxxxxxx ❤️❤️❤️
Yes!!! Thank you for being one of the few people who used these products to their full potential. I love that you weren’t limiting the product to one specific use but you used your creativity to use the products the way you wanted. Love this!!
Like that you take the time to play and understand how work the products before you show to us ;)
I have oily skin and this foundation broke me out really badly. I loved the finish and how it wore on my skin but I cannot use it. Does anyone have the same problem with the foundation?
Hi Nic, Thank you for the awesome review. So much hype on this one that it became so confusing... Btw, can I request you for a review of Huda Beauty's new foundation lines? Thanks a lot!
Pray the rosary everyday and quit the vanities of the world, because the world is passing away and the life of the soul is what is everlasting
love your take on makeup. told myself I wouldn't watch anymore fenty reviews but had to watch yours because I knew you would have a unique stance
Love you and your videos!! Would love to see you do a Bobbi Brown review xx
Eeeeeeeeeeeek. So jealous jealous jealous. I ,over her products. U look absolutely stunning. I loooooooved the eye makeup.the stick blush kinda thing and  the lip gloss. But all too expensive. But absolutely amazing makeup . Absolutely love u nic. ❤️❤️💕💕💕💋💋💋💋🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Love the lipgloss and the eye colours, however am not a huge fan of the base xx
Nic could you do a Fall/Autumn makeup routine video 😙 Love your videos!!
I would love to see a review on Kjaer Weis or RMS Beauty! xx
please review the ordinary serum and coverage foundations!
You girls are beautiful inside & out.
Nic - I'd love to see reviews on all of the upcoming Holiday collections!!!!
I'm obsessed with this look, stunning make up as always. ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
Hi Nic - I know you ladies tend to review/use more high end brands (not a criticism) but I was wondering if you would review the Primark range. X
To me the foundation matches your skin tho
I got the gloss and it just looks like clear gloss on me. The pretty color...disappears.😢
Would love love love a tarte review
This is my favorite review of this brand!
one of the most adventurous full fenty beauty looks i've seen! i think the glowy, natural-looking look most people create with these products are lovely, but you really used her products in the versatile way that rihanna wanted. and you did it really well!
Jesus Christ, that’s horrible 😂 She looks absolutely fine, but that over the top makeup is just too much. Sorry guys, but is it just me?
Really like the Brand reviews n seeing all the products used
You should do a review on Jeffree Star cosmetics! The brands Vegan I believe and available on Beauty Bay
Her hairline goes way back like the 1980's
The lighting was so much better in this video! :)\n\nAlso great review :) x
Best review of Fenty I've seen! Love the unique ways you used the products.
I have always loved you!!! Been a subscriber to your channel since your PixiCut hair days! But I love more how excited you get when you show in the products that would look great for darker skin. ❤️
I have to be honest, the contour looked very muddy! Maybe it was because of the lighting? Other than that, the cheeks and eyes looked gorgeous
its 2k 17 \ni cant recognize humans any more
Wasn't she menta shake the foundation first
I wanted to comment on how this has been the best review of the Fenty Beauty line, but everybody has already said it. This is why I've trusted Sam and Nic for years now. Their videos are so informative that they have helped me pick which MAC, Estee Lauder, and Clinique foundations would suit my skin type. Moreover, their reviews are so positive, it's always pleasing to watch them.
I wanted to love the foundation but it sank right into my pores with and without a primer. Good thing I only got a sample.
Would love a review on jefree star products. Thanks x
Out of all the Fenty Beauty reviews I have seen... I feel you were the most honest and transparent... but you guys always are.  💟  This was super informative... Thank u.  Well done!!
Love what you did here 🙌🏼❤️❤️ showing the versatile usage really helped me 😊
honoring the men in makeup too! Thanks Nic so much, this means so much to someone like me. much love from Orlando! xoxo
I think it's great that you did a full face using the highlighters as eyeshadow! Clever!
Love that you used Trophy Wife as an eyeshadow, and not a highlighter like other light skinned girls have done on Youtube.
Love this look so much!! 👌🏼
Would be great if you did an update skin care video. ☺
Any time you like something I just want to run out and buy it haha! I would love to see you review an affordable brand like Sleek or Nyx please, for those of us who need to rely on cheaper products most of the time...
What colour foundation did you go for Nic?
I love the look you did with it. I haven't seen anyone else use the highlighters as eyeshadow or lipstick
I like the way you do makeup - I don't understand contouring the forehead though.  It just looks like everyone has a dirty forehead.  You don't of course.
The foundation made me break out in little red spots (not pimples/active acne, almost like an allergic reaction as opposed to a breakout) but I really liked the way it looks when mixed with a luminous foundation for my dry skin - I used Koh Gen Do Aqua and the two seemed to play nicely together. If anyone's bought the foundation but has dry skin and finds it isn't working but also own a liquidy dewy foundation try mixing the two!
I have really dry skin and the formulas just did not work for me. I got the foundation as soon as it was released because of the color selection. I have a strong yellow undertone that is hard for me to match. The foundation and primer just made my skin look even dryer. I looked like I had more texture then I actually have.
Celebrity make up . I shall pass
Please review Le Mètier de Beautè. I am very curious on your feedback for a high end brand.
I love that she didn't just gush over Rihanna for being Rihanna. I'd like to try the matchsticks!!
I LOVE the lighting here!! I am so tired of overly bright videos that everyone else does. xx :)
Thank you for always including us darker skin girls in your reviews and recommendations.
I'd like to see a tutorial on Pat McGrath's new eyeshadow palettes.
Fantastic review Nic! Always enjoy listening to your honest thoughts and loved the look💗
Looks great nic.  Would love your opinion on Glossier.
I love but please cut down on the Botox your eyebrows didn't move the whole video!
Could you do a nyx review/tutorial.  I have not used there stuff but have heard good things about it. Also I have extremely pale skin with really dark under eyes. What would you do with that as I have never found a concealer good enough? I love your video. I like how real you are. Keep it up.
This is by far the best review of Fenty Beauty that I have seen so far. 👏🏼
Awesome review
love
Best review so far
Do you still use Lilash?
I thought you said 'ginger minge' 😂😂
CT please!!
Do NYX!!!!!
Best tutorial of fenty beauty. Thanks Nic
that finishing powder.... wow!
NARS would be great! Please please!
Please review Milani
Love the lighting
What moisturiser did you use?
37??? you look great!
Your right side looks fantastic!
Please review Dolce & Gabbana makeup! Thank you!
while tension male wbrozx conviction seemingly fish touch start overall.
This was a fantastic overview--I was laughing at the sheer volume of products that you managed to slap on but it was great to see them all in action!♥
To me sound very aggressive here, you can speak softer. Feels exhausting to listen sometimes. Still loved the content :-)
Omg! I looooove this look!
You knew you’d be applauded for making special mention of men and makeup. Nothing is stopping men from wearing makeup. I came here like most, to relax and watch a makeup tutorial. Instead it’s like everywhere else you turn- politically charged and obsessed with political correctness at every point where it can be mentioned.
Would love to know what you think about the new Nars Luminous weightless foundation and how best to apply it!
I watched this feeling like I learnt so many new things!
Great review as always, please can you do NYX thanks xxxx
At first I didn't like most of the collection but after watching this again I kind of get it now. I guess you made glamorous holiday outfits for every personality wether you like to be flashy, a little more conservative, or low key
IS THIS A DUDE I GOT 2 ASK NOWADAYS
Every piece is so gorgeous Carli! You are the best ❤️🙌🏻🙌🏻
Honestly I would have liked if u tried them on so I can see like a. Reference
So excited for the second drop of your Missguided collection clothing line!
So once these are sold out their gone forever after the second launch?
Whens the next release of product, like what you're wearing right now isn't on the website :(
Carli where did you buy your dress 👗?
The kardashians would love your stuff if only they knew !!!
I would have loved a try on video
I ordered the gray cropped sweatshirt and a little dissapointed in the design... the stitching on the top is so close together that it looks like i have shoulder padding in it, and it does not look flattering :(
I would need a hat to make my track-ir racing videos!! ;) (BTW congrats for your amazing collection, you do a really great work!!)
Where do you wear that in fall? I live in South Dakota.
I want a few of these items but a mom of 4 have to ha e my priorities straight! By the time I have the money I'm sure they will be sold out as each piece is amazing! 😣
Wow your prices went up real fast !!!\nWay to make money !!!\nPrices started today one thing and went up yo another !\nDisappointed with missguided scaming us
BettyElmer
Main country wire bkssld crop inquiry stuff treaty avoid honor judicial
Can we talk about her last snap ??? Where is her bf
Damn I just realized how I've completely fallen off interest in this girl like HARD! She used to be my queen but I just like every empire everything does come to an end... obviously people are still showing some love but nothing new here... I'm ready for Carli to get off YouTube and maybe be on tv instead... THAT I'd be interested in
Girl, you should totally do a lookbook!!!
I love the clothing line but I am sad to see that Brett and Carly are not together anymore 😭😭
Absolutely love!  Thanks for adding plus/curvy sizes!
Please do a navy smokey eye... it’s my birthday November 1st and my boyfriend is taking me away the following weekend and I have a navy jumpsuit to wear but no idea for my makeup!!!
I'm waiting for the second launch to come out then i'm 🛍🛍🛍
Where is her dress from that she is wearing on this video? *-*
i WANT ALL OF IT!!!!!
Thank you SO MUCH for not forgetting about the plus size community!!!!
Will she ever upload twice a week without excuses like before.... :(
Also wish you would do like a fashion show and try some of the stuff on, ovs I know would take forever but take some pics of some of the clothes on you xx
For the holiday collection PLEASE try on all the pieces 🙌🏻🙌🏻 when you made your first clothing line, I think the #1 thing that helped me decide what I wanted to buy was seeing you try on all the pieces. Thank you Carli!!! Can’t wait for the second drop ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Aaaaah I CANT wait to get a lot of those pieces Carli!!!!!! EVERYTHING was pretty much breathtaking 🙌🙌🙌🙌❤️ YES I've ALWAYS loved your style since the very first time you started I've followed your channel and have been obsessed with the way you dress!! Your style is UNIQUE & I'm in love with it!!! ....KEEP IT UP CARLI, you're amazing and you've beeeeeen doing an AMAZING job 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 TONS OF LOVE TO YOU from Chicago ❤️‼️ ...and snapchat lol and IG and Twitter! 😂❤️😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️‼️
I hope you’ve made some plus size in those over 100 pieces
All this stuff looks like Kim K knockoffs. It literally looks like everything on every instagram boutique. The rhinestone two piece she wore on the billboard was cute.
It's so amazing to see how much your brand/channel Has grown! I'm so excited for you beautiful 💖💖💖
♥️ all pieces, I will wear the grey mini dress with the jacket ✨
This collection is so EXTRA and so me! I'm obssessed. Too bad I'm poor. And can't get any of it.
Confused. Are the prices online different from the prices in store or something? Bc Misguidedus.com didn't get this price memo lol. As I was going through this video I got excited bc the prices she says are pretty reasonable but the majority of these are so off. Like they're way more expensive online then what she says here sooooooo????
Love the shoes towards the end.
CONGRAGULATIONS!\n\nThe collection is stunning x
Your collection is so you😭😍😍. It’s gorgeous!! Once I get enough coins I will definitely invest in your collection! Good job babes!! 😇🎊❤️
I am so in love with your line Carli😍😍 Trying to purchase my items now hun but the prices are higher when in the cart. @carlibybel
Hi Carli, \nI loved your collection and was looking forward to purchasing couple items but the price point doesnt match when towards the end of the purchase. \nI am very interested in purchasing the Gold & Silver Rhinestone halter as priced for $45, but towards the end of the purchase it updates to $57. I have spoken with one of the customer representative and she says that she will not be able to price match and I was wondering if this was a glitch or was your price point mistaken. \nThank You <3 \n\nP.S. Anyone purchasing this item having similar problems?
I love every piece but the prices are ridiculous😑
What size are you wearing in the sweater dress?
Carli, everything in this collection is BOMB. my grandma was watching as well and said I wish I was young so I could wear beautiful clothes like that!  😂 You are only young once so now is the time to wear fun clothes like this! I can't afford this but my heart is bursting for you I'm so proud of you! A beautiful mix of casual and fun holiday stuff. Sending love from Vancouver BC XOXO
its her birthday today
I definitely need that denim jacket! It sold out before I could get my hands on it.
Hi Carli! I love you and I'm so excited for your clothing line! I went on today to buy the plum joggers, and the price is jumping from $35 to $48 when I add them to the cart. I'm not sure what is going on. Has anyone else had this problem?
everybody complaining about the line are the ones who can’t pull the pieces off...oops 🙊
You know someones rich when they think wearing something seven times in the past two months is a lot
what is missguided’s sizing like? I’m usually a 0 or 24 for pants but I looked at their size chart and the measurements seemed a little small.
Very unoriginal..seen most of these styles on Kim K.. you slowly trying to morph into her!
30” Extensions very in right now
Hi Carli! What size you wear on that gold metallic bandeau dress?
What camera do you use ??
Why are people commenting on her weight? People saying she looks better now that she's gained some weight my gosh that's the same thing as telling someone that they look better now that they've lost weight. Idk. People come in different sizes, shapes, colors etc etc..why do these things always have to get pointed out? There's hardly no acceptance anymore. This world is doomed :\
Bummed out you didn't try the outfits on... I was looking forward to it
I wish this collection would be more classic and chic.. 😔
Carli!! Where are the boots from that you are wearing with the sporty blue dress?
This is very specific but the silver top looks exactly like the one Jenny from Forest Gump wore when she’s about to commit suicide...
In your next collection video, could you cut to clips of you wearing them? It really helps to see things on in motion 😊
Ok butt are you and Bret not\nTogether anymore?????
Where’s Brett? We haven’t seen him in your social media
so cute!  Can't wait for your holiday drop 2.
Who is this disturbing plastic faced woman ?
I love how these pieces are toned done colors
I wish she would try them on or post pictures...
Definitely gonna take this oversize jumper dress with the over the TOP shoes and corset, I’m obsessed 🔥🔥
I'm EXCITED FOR THE NEXT COLLECTION!!! I see a lot of things that I LOVE!!!!!!
Hi, congrats on your billboard Carli. The silk boots are beautiful and will probably purchase them but is the heel have silk, or is it more like a usual heel. Thanks carli I live in Northern Ireland and was wondering if you  are a 8 or 10 uk size what would that be American size
Are you and Brett still together?
Am I the only nosy one that’s wondering if her and Brett are still together?🤔🤷‍♀️😢
Everything kim Kardashian inspired so it’s not you’re style hun ,I think they are expensive for being misguided because the material it’s always the same kinda cheap material so should’ve been less expensive! Don’t get me wrong I love every piece but none it’s original !
I couldn't even finish the damn video it was lagging my man
November 13! that's my 20th birthday! 😭😭😭💓💓💓💓
I honestly love all of these pieces but I'm sad to say that most of those don't come in my size. Your collection will do great but it would also do really well with plus sizes. I'd like to see more plus size options! Still, congrats on your new collab with missguided!! 💗  Loved every single item in this collection ❤️
She's so cute! Love her! Can't wait to buy these pieces ❤️
Amazing. Beautiful colors and fabrics. Everything may not be for me, but at least half  of everything is. Also, you get what you pay for with F21. While I love that store, you need to really take care of the clothes you buy there if you want them to last. I feel like these would last a tad bit longer. Much support and good vibes!
Can't wait to get my hands on some items! Who wants to be friends guys?!?!?
Congrats on the collection!! Pretty pieces! I am eyeing the sweaters and sweatpants!!
Carli, I'm so disappointed ☹ most of this stuff are items I can find at Forever 21. I was so looking forward to it but I'm not crazy about anything, especially the slouchy looks that I can't get in Downtown LA for $5. Nothing like all the good quality product you had for Spring. I'll probably buy 1 item. All the rest I hated 😭
Looks like Carli and Brett are no longer together. He's no where in her new videos,snaps, or big events
Hi Carli are you and Brett still together? Just noticed that both of you never post or mention each other anymore😐🙈x
Hey why I’m not seeing her boyfriend with her did they broke up :o
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME, ARE HER AND BRETT TOGETHER? some guy was grinding on her in her snap chat
Congratulations Carli! You absolutely deserve it! ✨
She look like KimK
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Stunning 😍❤️❤️❤️
Maybe carli bybel and khloe kardashian were switched at birth
Her hips are much bigger
Omg this whole collection.. wowww
YOU LOOK AMAZINGGGG!!!
Happy birthday Carli
didnt see the corset belts?????
HAPPY BIRTHDAY lol
THAT JUMPSUIT THOUGH!
The prices are not the same that you are claiming. The sparkly booties were supposed to be 80 now they’re 95 and they don’t look the same on the website. Kinda disappointed....
That sandal is not 80 it’s 95
I know im late but im defiantly gonna make my mom buy me some of this stuff, btw her birthdayvwas the same day as Gucci Mane and Key Kior
She’s a legend 👌🏾
I love her so much! !
HOW OLD IS THE MEATBALL.
where did the egg come from ?
she's so great
I can’t stand his fake ass laugh
Freaking LOVE HER! 😎👍
Her and Em are dope. That new track is fire!
Jimmy looks like he is really a fan <3
love you pink you are so amazingly talented keep doing you
Pink is hot stunning woman talented singer songwriter actress and dancer alot of people would want to work with her
Why do her mannerisms remind me of Melissa McCarthy?
Where else can I say this...\n\nI love pink!!!!!!
P!NK is soooo cute! She's probably the coolest down to earth mom. Been a fan since Most Girls. She still has the same personality.
Yup just bought a ticket. She is coming to Australia.
I LOVE YOU, P!NK\nPlease perform in Super Bowl Halftime
Don't you mean she cries when he sings?
I also cryied when my mum sang to me when I was a baby
when will eminenm guest in the tonight show?
 we work with the same people like Rihanna, i know that she is way hotter than me , but i'm funnier LOL i' ve loved her
mayb he cries because mammy has an angry face alot when she sings
The one song I HATE (and deleted) is the next single. 😣
Jimmy you have 2 more year as the host... You're starting to feel fake, like super cringe!
How can you cry on such shitty music she is just like crap
Her son isn't the only one crying when he hears her awful songs.
I don't know about anybody else but She is still beautiful. And still married to the man who did the first backflip on a a dirt bike!!!😀
I LOVE HEERERR SO MUCH!!!
Pink+Eminem
This is some normie shit.
My *Meatball* I was like AWWWWWWWWWWWWW and i cried\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I saw the girl singing and I screamed *SHE SO DAMN CUTE*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRihanna is so much hotter than me but I'm *funnier*
Jimmy tries too hard to relate with his laughs and comments. Lots of guests just seem to smile and put up with him.
So, I've emailed Marshal...\nThats a different level xD
i have't seen a Pink Eminem... nah!
Pink suit to the VMAs is literally LIFE!!!
I'd like to see Pink's bean.  I'd also love to play with her bean.
She's so great, god, I thank the universe for people like her.
I love to hear her lagth, I think I would tickle her for a long time just to hear it.
Fire Starter,.....lol, priceless,....and actually, she does, lol, and that lip synch part, ha, amazeball's!!  Love her, and her new album is amazing :D
Love it!! Check me very fast bass player https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfjY1UtIWmDN4sDXtpt2hIg?sub_confirmation=1
The part where she talks about Revenge and how she was drinking wine and wanted a Rap Grammy and asked Eminem and whatnot-- she gave that interview on the radio here in New York VERBATIM like to the point I was just wondering if they edited out Jimmy and put in Elvis Duran's voice like every little joke she made and EVERYTHING. Until Jimmy interrupted her joking along about the email it was EXACT. Like, I get that they have to tell the same stories over and over and shit when they're doing promo for an album and especially for one specific single BUT usually their answers are slightly different seeing as they're talking to someone different etc... this literally like was weird and made me feel like she's a robot HAHA. Seriously google the interview if it's up and you'll see... so weird. Ver-bay-Tum. Lol\n\n  Incidentally, Revenge is my favorite song rn like I LOVE it hahahaha it's just different and cool and funny. Also I love Eminem so there's that. Two thumbs up. (That song, plus the interview, actually made me DL the entire album and so far I've listened to like half of it and it's great, I highly recommend it).
If you sub to me I will sub to you
I cry when she sings too and at my age I'm nearly deaf.
Time is a heartless bitch to me,,but Missy Pink is holding up really well.   Funny stuff.   Meatball and Firestarter,,Ha!,,,  Kids have a bright future,  so long as their mom has a good heart, which she does.   Good luck Mom!
who cares? this bitch is ugly
P!NK has been around forever, yet I notice she's only recently been really famous, I don't get it.
what a brave transgender pink is. and what an Adonis belt!
Too bad cant afford to see her live
March 1st is my birthday!!!!!!! I will be 18!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU PINK
He cry’s because he hates her voice.
Pink is cool. M&M is a douche-bag.
Me too, she's not very good
I see Eminem in the description I click.
P!NK went to school with my mom in highschool
Pink is ugly,  and her music is bad, and shes stupid.
Shes so genuine and beautiful..good on you ms lady!
have u guys thought of P!nk doing the Superbowl Halftime show?
She’s fucking awesome! \nCan’t wait to see you in New Zealand
why at 0.28 does he always do that fake laugh?
Yo is she the one, Simon said was trash??
Give leading please export potato offer site treatment identical category.
Ughhhhh STFU and let her speak
Pals rate Anyone  identify bigger  this case? laxghing
I cry whenever she sings
Pink: Hi\nJimmy: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Love
Pink stinks
yo pink is qeer! JUGALO FOR LIFE!
Stink
She has balls too.
Fallon's ratings are tanking lol
Go 'head, Big Sis. I just love P!nk. I love her personality and her will to not give in to trends.
Their pictures with them all bending the gender lines to push the filthy marxist luciferian hollywood agenda of post-genderism and ambiguity is digusting.
Love her!! This album is underwhelming but she is amazing!!
I like their song together on Recovery. I would have been shocked if Eminem said no to her after she’s been on one of his tracks.
Does she love Eminem after threatening to drop all his fans if they don’t drop Trump.  Thug...
Maybe coz her music has lost its edge? Just kidding but I really do miss the early 2000s
Jimmy is so sweet!!!
Such a nice Person :)
pinks awesome. Jesus this guy is cringe to watch tho. So fake with his laughter. Are all american talk show hosts this bad?
Гуф Умер!
oh  so sweet !
Jimmy loves everything lol
I would be honoured to have anal sex with PINK.
She is so cool...
pink is not her real  name but she is good i love  her
I want her to be my Mommy. :D
I thought this was going to be a really sweet story about how her son loves her voice so much he cries when she sings... oops XD
She is lovely.
I love pink
Love me some P!nk. ❤ #Awesome
I think Jimmy has a little crush on Pink and who could blame him!!!   xox great interview
She's an amazing woman!
#get rid of jimmy fallon because he's not funny
Pink should do next super bowl halftime, cuz she's is awesome!!!
YOU'RE fat ! He cries because you're a bad celebrity.
If she didn't look so damn stupid we might actually pay attention to her voice.
lazy ass voice

ISSA SAVAGE🔥😈💕
Issa lit😇😇😇😇
Damn anyone can rap only good rappers could rap about real shit respect to 21 #slaughtergang
Hands up don’t shot ! 🙏🏼
i like this 21...not that mumble bs
The auto tune is too much in this, yet you still can’t understand what he’s chattin 😂
why isn't this on Spotify?!
....🎶 They killed Martin Luther King, and all he did was spoke 🎶.. (909)
This song makes me wanna open water and drink the bottle.
Focus on the real issues like on black crime not criminals shot by cops. Wtf is wrong. He sayin is nothing new but keeps releasing music promoting violence
how can someone be so deep but act so retarded at the same time
They killed Martin Luther King all he did was spoke
For all you people that are just simply dumb and even dumber this song is not targeting white people it’s just talking about the past and how they messed up the hoods
More like nothing new for him 'on God 24/7
Realist song of the year
I hardly ever get emotional to some rap but this is a different story...i feel it
This hoe go so fuckin hard 21 a fool for this one omm
Imma like this twenty one times😤
this a whole new savage
Kinda ironic “slaughter gang” trying to bitch about people getting killed countless white cops get killed everyday and they talk about killing people and proving black lives matter maybe people wouldn’t be scared of young black men if they weren’t portraying them selfs as murders “slaughter gang” they disrespect teachers and don’t try and make something out of them selfs legally and they wonder why there is minor racism I can sympathize with the Muslims b/c not all of them are bad the majority isn’t but the majority of young black men act ignorant and that is why people treat them the way they do if young black me didn’t act so foolish there wouldn’t be racism
I HATE THAT I LOVE THIS
00:45 is when the video start
White cops aint shit bro why would you shoot if my hands up like duh duh tf
21 savage thankyou for exposing our society black poeple are flesh and blood to me theyre like family
How does this shit not have more views.
Reminds me of Future - News or Somethin'
This is my favorite one man issa banger and ive watched like like a hundred times
Good point, bad song. I do like most of your music though. Sorry.
im white but i bump this shit
“They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke”🤕🙌🏾
*”They thought I only rapped about murder and pistols”*
Can't believe racism is still happening till this day. \n\n\n\nThis world is fucked up.
This shit hit me. My grandma said this stuff that he was talking about was actually happening.pray to all the moms sons that have died from stealing or robbing.🙏🙏🙏
The fuck is this?
But blacks kill blacks all the time...
B.L.M was made by a cop killer. please keep that in mind
This song would have better if he didn't use that bit of autotune
I want out of this illuminati shit
This video sends a powerful message..
But y u trapping so hard
everybody stop wht y'all doing and go check out my freestyle on my channel I'll appreciate it
I hope all these people calling anyone who dislikes the video racist know that the only people who owned slaves were the rich people so I most likely don't even have an ancestor who owned one!
I KNEW HE COULD REALLY RAP I SCANNED HIS BADGES LIKE Solluminati

Damn i hate cops like that and R.I.P. to all those who lost their lifes to racist cops who shot them just cause they black.
If the people dislike this shit they must be trump suporters

Shit's got me. 21 Savage just showed me his true soul. This takes a lot of guts. Keep it up 21.\n\nMetro and Zay too.
Shitty song, shitty video
Issa making me hate my own race.
Who else loves this song ! I know I do 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They killed Abraham Lincoln and all he did is free the slaves btw Im not white Im Hispanic and Black
I can't handle the pitch of her voice. She sounds like she's complaining about a co-worker.
Minute Earth: Well\n\nDrug Addict: THEY COME FROM PINK FAIRIES MADE FROM BACON
Great video!  But Tacrolimus has many more uses that just treatment for Eczema.  It has revolutionized transplantation as an anti-rejection drug!
Why don't you also do a video about hippos? And the difference between the crocodile and the alligator?
In short, drugs are made from fungi 😂😂😂
Just went to talk at the University of Minnesota with Dr Salomon presenting about this stuff. Extremely interesting and innovative.
Every time my mom puts a banana in my lunch its smell and taste gets somehow infused with the rest of the lunch. If you could make a video explaining this that would be great. Thanks!
From the cute 11 year old boy next to my house\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm 91
From the drug store, bruh
I dont know why but i get the best chills watching minuteearth and even get my eyes wet...
One teaspoon of soil a day will keep the doctor a stone's throw away.
The power of natural products
Simple - they come from mexico
would you do a video about wolves and their mating
From third world countries.
Where Do Our Drugs Come From?
00:02 to 00:10\nThe REAL question is WHAT the hell is it in the remaining medications?
I just get it from that sketchy guy behind Walmart.
wait Minnesota!? thats the state i live in
How come researchers don't try mutating fungi to target the MRSA bacteria common in hospital? \n\nLike put a certain type of fungi that's enemy with the staf bacteria and see if it mutates after several generations to become resistant to the MRSA.
Hello, please provide translations, thank you.
Sooo...The ice cream truck isn't the only place to buy drugs?
The CIA is where they originally came from. LSD
Mostly colombia and Mexico
You're looking for a guy named Heisenberg, you didn't hear it from me😑
They came from the pharmacy, duh.
It’s from that Ugandan warlord
The world is brutal by nature, killing is a necessity to live.
Is it just me, or do they use Dutch Haagel Slaag alot in their vidoes?
Imagine the really useful ones they don't release to the public.
The art of XKCD and the voice of Marzipan from homestarrrunnner, it's a winning combination!
1:59  right hand column 4th one down,  we discovered aeroplanes from leeks?
Oh I thought this was about drugs like cocine, meth or others
We should get rid of the current education system and instead replace them with a movie like experience, where all the students get like ridiculously comfy chairs, a big screen with everyone in front of it, popcorn or snacks of any kind with drinks, and just play minute earth and minute physics videos. Guarantee you this, whatever the official number is for the amount of students that succeed through their lives will skyrocket compared to how it has been. An 8 year old could watch this and learn without confusion. This world is very far behind where it could already be, people like the people here at minute earth are what we need.
my plug, Kevin. shoutout to him
Easy drugs come from hell
Yes, the University of Minnesota is a major source of knowledge regarding medical research (I will get treatment there for chronic tmj)
i think antibiotic or antimicrobe that bacteria pump out have another purpose. Some journal say it used for signaling neighbor microbe with chemical substance rather than killing them.
penecilin dosnt exist anymore... newer and newer antibiotics have to be made all the time because with every new antibiotic comes resistance and adaption by the bacteria. Good luck this will be a massive problem eventually and everyone will get infected.
God like all things
I already have the smelly socks one :P
This was a waste....
In another universe, fungi and bacteria are taking Guns and Nuclear Weapons to treat their infections of humans.
So live in forest and start pharmacy!
My dealer usually makes me jerk him off, but never gives me the drugs. Why is that? He even pinky promised.
When theyre really imported from government officials
I thought you were gonna tell us ur dealer
What about the remaining 3/10 chemicals?
Biggest opium plantations are guarded by the military. Take a wild gues, DUURRRRR
2:20 This bacteria with stinky socks, made me smile;p
What about the other 3?
I'm now more curious about the other 3/10 drugs
Don't get me wrong, I like Kate's voice, but there's something... unusually high and squeaky about it. Does the recording software not do her voice justice? Or does she really sound like a chipmunk?
What do they say about the guy who brings mushrooms to the party?\n\nHe's a real fungi!\n\n**rimshot**

Ok I'm going to say it as a female....Anna's boobs look great. As well as her hair.
hahaha the good lads story cracked me up!
Anna's eyes are amazing 😍
I’m getting JLo vibes in this vlog I get what Johnathan means now!!!!
LOOOVE your hair. The colour and style is length looks amazing. I think we need a new how to curl your hair tutorial 😁
Hey! Great video :) what brand t shirt are you wearing? You always have the loveliest v necks and I need one!
You look a lot like Jennifer Lopez in this video xx
love you so much!! how about an updated grocery haul?
Glad your back, you are a great inspiration
You are so gorgeous Anna, I love to see your vlog🤗😘
I have missed these so much!\nYour answer for the messy home I literally re-watched twice...I have three young children & completely relate to that. THANK YOU so much for that.
Great video. Loved it
So glad you've found yourself again. Be comfortable in your own skin Anna because you truly are an inspiration to others. Keep up the brilliant work as a human and a mother x
who is this beauty trending on Youtube???Who is this milk of magnesia? What does she want with me?
I just want to thank you and Jonathan for choosing to document so much of your lives with us. I cannot express the love and joy you bring to me and all your fans every single day. You are just so raw and real it's refreshing. I hope more people become like you, don't listen to haters there just the scum of the earth. Little low lifes who want nothing more than to be where you are xx
Anna your eye makeup looks so nice xxxx
Please do a video on how you're not going to do videos any more. That would be great.
The Rumors that Anna had plastic surgery is bullsh**.  \n\nPeople will do anything to tear down Anna and Jonathan.  Anna is a natural beauty but people can’t believe it.  \n\nThe fact that the Sacconejoly are so drop dead gorgeous family intimidates people.   \n\nPeople need to look deep down inside them-self to wonder what is wrong with them.
You are so pretty and I wish I could meet you and the others ❤
Who is the youngest viewer
You look absolutely amazing!!  😍💋❤
How cool would it be if Jonathan would let the camera film Emilia and Edouardo interacting with Alessia when they know you're not watching them.\nLove u guys<3
Omg you want a 4th baby?? 😍❤️
really love your hair here!
Let me be your 400th dislike...
Did she say: she has 3 and wants another.😭\n👧👴👶👶
You really looks stunning, looks so happy and amazing! 😍 I have never thought about this before but you look like Jennifer Lopez, love love love your hairstyle and the color 😍 keep up the good work Anna! ☺️💕 love from Sweden
What's this channel all about?? Kids?? 🤔😁
Going to show this video to my hairdresser cause I need this hair color!!! Its beautiful!
Who cares
Are this the person True geordie is talkin about
I love you so much Anna, you are incredible 💗so beautiful 💕✨🌸☁️💗xoxo
Your whole bit about how you deal w keeping a tidy home made me cry 😢 thank you! That is such a good way to look at/deal with it 💞💞💞💞 xoxo
A lovely video Anna I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):)
Wow u look so much like j lo there
Wait, Anna's only 29?!  Huh!
I totally agree with not worrying so much about having the house neat and spotless and worry about spending time with my daughters.
I'm half Italian and my siblings and I all have French names! So does my mum!
😂😂 omg your response to plastic surgery, “we daily vlog” like hello people, she couldn’t hide facial surgery if she’s vlogging everyday. Haha! You look beautiful, so proud of you being so real and honest
You start to look like JLO 😊
Your long hair makes you look so much younger omg !!!!
Your eye makeup is stunning !😍x
Crazy to think Anna is only 3 years older than me and she’s got her whole life sorted out. I don’t even have a boyfriend/husband 😭😂
Annnaaaa! So nice to have an update. Ignore the silliness of people talking about you having had 'work'. They are just in disbelief that you are such a beautiful woman. Keep on doing you. Watching you guys from here in Uganda. Have a lovely week xoxoxo
Hello Anna! Have you ever heard the name Audra? We chose that name for our first girl and just love it. Thought of you when you were talking about A names. Plus you can really use a tongue roll with it. Haha.
Anna, you’re so beautiful, I’ve been following you for 5yrs now and you get better with age x
I love the name Alessia :)
Rumours?! Clearly I’ve been blind to everything...
Francesca is my middle name. Also a family name. ❤️
Does anyone know the song at the end?
Do you walk all the dogs at the same time? Id like to see that in a vlog :D
I love your hair in this video! You look stunning xx
U have a brother? Never saw him
I think people think you have had plastic surgery because you look so different from when you guys first started vlogging. Your makeup is drastically different, the dark eye color and orange hair made you look older. People change, you can change your makeup and hair color and look completly different.
can anyone tell me how to open up description/info box on desktop with the new YT interface? :(
okay
Aw Anna! You're such a lovely lady! I love watching your videos!!
I love that your doing 3 videos a week. Missed you Anna
Are you going to show your Fall/ Halloween decorations? I always like to see these.
Anna and I are literally the same person 😊♥️
Anna, you are just gorgeous, and so sweet and real--so happy for you and your sweet family!!  💕 Lisa
Anna, thanks for sharing your Q&A! I always enjoy your chats. The story about Emilia and Eduardo was so funny. 😃 Never a dull moment with kids! BTW, you look so beautiful, and I love your hair! 💖💖
She has a bit of a irish accent am i right??
Hi Anna, thanks for sharing a little tidbit of yourself. I wonder what Emelia & Eduardo’s newest adventure code will be..lol.. Just wait till they get Alessia involved when she grows up..lolI don’t have Snapchat or Instagram so thanks for sharing this vlog. You&your family are lovely. Take care & see ya : )
U look beautiful
Girl, you look so gorgeous! Like a greek goddess! Is it creepy if I say your curves look fabulous?
Seeing her childern with that pout I believe she has not done any lip job 😘😍
You have Grown into Such a Wonderful Lady.. So many Changes Anna, in you Attitude and Really matured beautifully.,💖💖
Could you PLEASE share some insights on having a family in the spotlight, like especially because you are mainly social media based. How do you protect them? Do you get threats? Could you be real about your struggles? For all the moms thinking about blogging but torn about how much exposure to give their children? Any advise?
Would love you to do a skin care and/or hair care routine video!!
I’m i the only one who thinks she looks like Jennifer Lopez?
I think people forget that Anna is still only 29 and also is natural beautiful. Not every body needs or wants Botox!
Literally made me feel 100 times better today. I have two kids one is a month old and the other 3 and she has the worse cold. No washing done and no cleaning I feel so guilty but seeing this made me feel so much better
You're so sweet, Anna :-)
Love this video so much😍😍Well done Anna😘😘
Hi Anna so glad u came back and you don't have to explain yourself to us and love u see u guys in Glasgow
👍So happy your back Anna😗
When you're so pretty they think you've had plastic surgery.
You look stunning Anna 😀
Love this video <3
YAY
Anna your hair looks incredible😍
Tits
Oh pls stfup 😴
Halloween 🎃 House Tour?😍
U look beautiful
Great video x
love your video anna
You are stunning
Rock On !!!!!!!
The earrings trap story was the funniest!! 😂 looking gorgeous Anna 💕
You're so stunning Anna!
So gorgeous Anna😘X
Alessia sounds like a name my 4 year old would make up during playtime.
Looking at the bottom half of the video
I think it is a bit unfair how all their names are to do with Anna's side of the family but not Jonathan's
Had no idea Anna had a brother?!
How do u afford 3 kids while UK is so expensive and you want a fourth one hehehehehehe
No cos you said we only film a few bits a day. Your cheeks are huge . Liar
Funny how when you talk about plastic surgery you say you didn't get your lips filled or Botox but you don't talk about the things you DID get done because that would be outright lying.  Anyone who used to know you (wink wink) knows you got your nose and your boobs done.
I love the cabinet and the way you've organised it. 😍
It’s not the table. I think it’s the picture above it. You should leave the table and replace the picture with something smaller.
Omg that carrot cutter is GENIUS
Your the first person who I’ve heard that is exactly like me! Literally the week before my period I can never get full! And I crave everything! Of course not healthy stuff lol
Boy cats who wee a lot in the wrong place even though they're fixed might have kidney stones.  It happens a lot to fixed males and he could be trying to tell you something
Also could you do an updated video all about your scrap booking?
Omg where are those carrot scissors from lol I need them
I wish I had pale skin 😭😭😭
I love the cabinet but maybe you should move the picture 😂
I've lived in Brighton my whole life and hardly ever go to the beach 😫 need to start!
Did she say she was chubs? Omg... if she's chubby I can't imagine what the rest of us must be.
Oh my I cried with you :'(
Whenever I cry when I’m being over emotional my mum and brother always laugh at me 😂
can you do a scrapbooking vid🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
9:00 what is that song?
Hey gab you think you can help me out with a lil shout out for my channel to get started?
Gabby has such a beautiful smile. Seeing her happy makes me smile xx
The company that did those cute pages from your old agenda is called shopban.do ! They also have a ton of other cute things, including prints!

Gabs vlogs just put me in such a good mood 💓
You look gorgeous in this ❤️ black suits you so much
The gold stand it too small in that part of the room you should put two plants either side
I got my boyfriend one of those prints for his birthday, except it was the sky on our first date 💕

My form last year was 9LS 😂
whats the link to the company that sent you the picture of sheffields sky??
Awwww! Gabby bless ya,I get sad days like that too 😢 days when you don't want to be sad/upset and days where you don't even know why your sad/upset you just are
Gabs I literally had one of those sad crying moods on my birthday. Honestly the worst day of my lifeee lol xxx
Does anyone remember the film Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen?\nI don't know why but the dance mat clip reminded me of the dance mat scene in that movie 😂
no, you ARE the cutest thing xx
Omg I was crying when you put the slightly blurred picture of you on the screen it was so funny  😂  Love you sm xox
7.40 is me and my mum 😔💗 smile beautiful💗
With what app do you make your thumbnails with? 💗
Lucy's hair is goals af

I'm literally crying with you gab 😂 ❤️
The print from the day she started her youtube channel is from https://www.bookishly.co.uk shes accidentally forgotten to leave in the description 💖
Youve come such a long way, ive been watching you since you started, im so proud of everything youve achieved with your anxiety& getting through all the opperations youve had on your body. I love you so much youre such an inspiration❤️❤️❤️
Did you castrate the cat? It should stop the peeing.
Love your hair colour, really want to dye my hair darker now. What hair color did you use? X
Oh and where did you meet eachother? Through youtube or what???
The gold cabinet with that green in the art print... 👌🏼
All tucked up on the couch watching this. I cried with you. I loved your makeup in this video  too. Shame about the cabinet. .
noo gabby needs to paint the frame of her banana lead print gold !! itll tie it all together
This video has really cheered me up after I’ve been heartbroken by this boy I loved and I feel like crap and this brightened my day having a gabby vlogs marathon cus they’re my fave, I love watching you snapchat story and seeing Nellie and bean and it makes me want a kitten again. Love you gabby thank you for cheering me up xxxxx
I once wrote out all the lyrics to cotton eye joe and learnt the ‘just dance’ wii routine xx
The humour in this, omg xDDDDDDDDDDDD that last bit. I love you, hahahaha x
I feel like I've been waiting for your cabinet to come forever!!!!
Could you sell your old phone? ngl kinda want it!! ha ha love you! xxxxx
The views in this vlog are straight out of a film. I loved it.
Awwww it's so cute how u cried to ur mum ❤️❤️
8:15, you looked stunning! I did a lil double take cause id just had it on in the background!x
Cats like plastic because it has a smell to them that’s like cat pheromones. I know a boy cat called Snickers that CANNOT be trusted around plastic packaging.
Hey Gabriella, I usually don't comment, but I watch your videos all the time... I thought that if you turn your leaf print to portrait instead landscape it might look better with a smaller cabinet. xx
you're both so cute can i pls join your squad
Gabby your literally me when I am pms crying to my friends on FaceTime and them laughing at me, usually I cry about wanting pizza 😂😂
honestly, your videos literally make my day i love watching them so much<333
Gabi I’d love to know if bean is gonna stay with you or live at your mums ❤️
I don't know why I'm crying - legit me last week outside of college before my period on the phone to my mum.
Something about your vlogs are so addictive!
You look so damn good in this vlog!! I don't know if it's your hair or your skin looking paler but you look really really good 😍

Cabinet looks so beautiful.
love your videos Gabby
Are the walls in Gabriella's living room purple or grey? 🙈
I normally get really upset when people cry, but cause she said it's PMS I couldn't stop laughing bc same 😂
Whats the name of the website that the print is from of the sky above sheffield??
Those adverts are really annoying.
U should put like small tables on either side of the cabinet to fill the space up. Just an idea.😉😄
I need the link for the print!!!! OMG I need that in my life right now!!!
Don’t usually bother commenting on videos but this is my favourite vlog this year! ❤️
What the heck is with the carrot scissors!? That's ingenious 😍 so much easier than them pinging off the chopping board. Wow. Need that haha
Get out the facking club
This man is toxic and half those players don't deserve to wear the shirt
this old cunt is going to kill me.
WENGER IN
fuck this guy
Xhaka was terrible playing out of position ..giving ball away ..why not play wilshere  instead ? Arsene clearly lost it ..
Lol Donkey! Please stay at Arsenal forever. Laughing stock of the league.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Welbeck just back from injury ..why play him instead of Giroud ?
WENGER-IN
First... fuck Wenger
Scandalous decision! Bit like offering you another 2 years then Mr Wenger!
Jesus christ just go, every decison you make is a WTFFFFFARE YOUDOING!@#@@#@ decision.
Look aaahhh
Europa League club. Facts. \n\nFeel bad for Wenger. \n\nWas it raining? Ty definitely gonna muster something banterful at another Watford defeat.
All said at exactly 0:10...
i cant listen to him anymore
This man face is horror film scene, worse than hell fire.. fuck off here
Wenger in! Fuck your you modern day football fabs
Hahahahahahah
pack youre bags and fuck off!
Specialist in failure
Carlos anceloti is still available
Hahhahahahahahahahahahaha
Bahahahaha! xD
Donkey!!!!!
🤣🤣🤣
Excuse after excuse after excuse MAN THE FUCK UP give us the answers we deserve to here we deserved to lose penalty or not
Spineless...coward
No one wants this shit, just do mcgregor vs Ferguson
Conor is the a side as they say so get in the cage with him
Washed up no power Pauline. Still trying to stay relevant. Nigga worse than a female.
Conor would wipe the floor with this stupid washed up never any good fucking American fucking cunt
Does he really need to get slept again
This dude is still thinking about Connor's balls.
Who da fuck wants to see Paulie ina ring again, get the fuck outta here....
Paulie bring your balls and fight Conor in a REAL fight
fight him in the octagon pussy. boxers with all their rules calling out mma fighters is a joke
Fuck off pauline , or grow a pair and take your old ass into the octagon
Paulie in his prime would school Conor easily but if they fight now, it would be a stalemate.
All these boxing fans are gay af.  Connor made Floyd his bitch! Rub that bald head of his lol.  Connor could rape paulie and Floyd at the same time irl just saying (since u gay boys love gay stuff)
Who gives a flying fuck about paulina lmao Conor vs tony 💯 let’s get it done Dana. We don’t need this pillow fighting fake ass shit.
Who really cares about this fight ? Nobody cares this dude's a clown.
Boxing still has fans after the McGregor fight? 😂
this guy is easy money for Connor Mc gregor !!!!!!!!
Conor better not fight in the ring. He got to defend his titles.
sit down and wait in line Paulie. you are 4th in line maby
Hey Paulie, take Conor’s balls out of your mouth, we have a hard time understanding you as it is.
if Paulie had such big balls then why don't be get in the cage
No fucker would be interested in paying to see a fight with this Shmucko...
Refuses to step into the octagon/ a REAL fight = The very Definition of NO BALLS!!! FYI McGregor already stepped into the boxing world!!!
If conor had no balls how about u do what he did and cross over!! Face him in his sport like he did with mayweather...yh right lol...no chance youd do that cus u know...u know ur a pussyhole
paulie is delusional lol hes never been a ppv star, doesnt have a title and lost most of his last few fights.......Dude got more fame sparring conor twice than he did when he was boxing. be grateful and keep it moving paulie
PAULIE SOUNDS LIKE A BITTER EX GIRLFRIEND.. STILL TALKING ABOUT CONORS BALLS.. REAL TALK HE SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE WHO GOT HIS ASS WHOOPED AND WANT A SECOND CHANCE TO REDEEM HIS PRIDE.. UNFORTUNATLY HIS PRIDE IS IN CONORS BACK POCKET
is this faggot still talking he will get dropped in the 4th or 5th round
Didn’t this clown get kod with a body shot in his last fight against a nobody name Eggington beat it paulie
Come to MMA or shut your mouth.
go fight in the UFC you no balls having mother fucker.
Paulie  what are you talking about...you punch like a bitch!!!
He sure says balls a lot
PM U JUST A HIGH DEF TROLL LMFAO
Would love it if this fight happens. Never happier to see paulie getting knocked the fuck out!!!!
Sick of hearing this prick talk man
paulie man i love yea man but in a reall fight you die man.so dont be calling him a pussy
Get paulie into the octagon against conor, and then rematch conor floyd in the octagon, and lets see how long they last in there.
Who the fuck wants to see this ? I really haven't  seen any positive feedback from people on this fight. If this happens to be Mcgregor's next fight, he has to vacate the belt he cannot expect to put the division on hold for another 6 /8 months. He hasn't fought since Nov 2016 & it would be close to two years if this does happen .
who da Fook is that guy??
This is Paulie try to make money talk  😂😂😂😂😂
Shut up you moron this guys doing my head in with that mouth I'll step in that ring with him and I have no boxing experience at all and still kick he's moaning ass...... Bored.
PURE BOXING IN THE OCTAGON WITH 4OZ GLOVES MAKE IT HAPPEN DANA
this guy is a walking mouth
Woahhh ground breaking info ....a boxer can beat a non boxer in boxing and an MMA fighter can beat a non MMA fighter in MMA. \n\nIn other news water is wet and fire is hot.
Love you Paulie and everything you do but I can't wrap head around when you say he's got no balls...he wanted the fight so he stepped up into the boxing world..maybe one of you guys should step into the octagon..if your not pussy
I’m a boxing fan first, but paulie is getting annoying as fuck begging for this fight. He got knocked down and he’s still salty as fuck.
Says he's got no balls yet doesn't want to fight him in mma ok
It ain’t gonna happen Paulie. Paulie is broke that’s why he is running his mouth
Paulie....get in the octagon...or STFU with the pussy shit!!!...you don't have a hair one on your tiny little balls, McGregor got into the ring with the GOAT ...which takes balls no matter what (even if it is just boxing)...that having been said, Paulie throws the terms pussy and no balls around quite a bit for a guy who KNOWS there isn't a snowballs chance in hell he'd fight under MMA rules!!! Paulie should be thanking Conor for making him even remotely relevant!!!
'conor has no balls'\n\nfirst of all, you aint even competed in MMA.\n\nsecondly, it takes a lot of balls to compete and win in the ufc so go figure
Can this guy just fuck off, I'd rather see Conor defend against Tony or fight Nate in the trilogy. None of this boxing bullshit anymore, if these faggots want a payday they can go to the octagon because Conor is the draw not them. Conor vs Floyd was an exclusive boxing match and Conor has no business in the ring anymore.
I hope Conor knocks his fucking head off! I can't stand that whiny little bitch
Nah...not interested in this fight in boxing or mma.  I’m sure Paulie would beat him in boxing and McGregor would kill him in mma.  But would rather see Tony Ferguson fought McGregor to legitimize lightweight division, anything else is a side show.
Come to the octagon Paulie before you start talking about balls.
MMA mate u want it bribg ur balls go to his sport
Call a boxer bitch like canelo or broner not a none boxer
Bro Paulie with a full camp? Forget about it. And you know he’s gonna be training at TMT
You ain't getting it Paulie. No one cares about you, Conor & Dana have bigger plans sorry pal
McGregor gonna fight with a real fighter next : Tony Ferguson. Not your bum ass
Why don't McGregor fight Canelo, he did so good against mayweather it should be a good fight right MMA fanboys?
You fil step in the octagon show your ballsack
Coward. At least meet halfway and fight under Muay thai or K1 rules.
i wont watch this garbage. it’s another con.  crap
Omg are we talking about diarrhea mouth Connor \nConnor  box like a fucken 12yr old kid boxing his first match
Fuck this little Rat. He cant fight for shit and talks shit. Just like Floyd. Even i would woop dat ass. Boxers Are the easiest opponent for grapple/kickers
In the Octagon Conor McGregor would whoop your ass and Floyd Mayweather's ass in one night
This just has to stop now 🤦🏽‍♂️ he got his ass whooped and he just begging for another one with a payday and it's embarrassing
paulie about to talk himslef into about 20-25 million.. not mad at him
Shout out to Tommy gun , come to my house and you'll be the dinner you fucked up little pussy , going to my videos and calling my daughters whores? You'll never know how lucky you are sitting behind your keyboard. And I notice you've deleted all your comments. You best pray we never meet.
as an alpha male, you don't try this hard to get one back on a dude if he didn't kick your ass once. Paulie just got handled in sparring. big deal
Doubt any real  boxing or MMA fans would have the slightest interest in this farce after the previous one.
Let's see Conor vs GGG \nOr Canelo vs Conor\nNot this pillow puncher who got embarrassed by Conor
Paulie is selling this right, playing with Conor's ego by daring him.......i hope it works so we get to know the truth!
Paulie such publicity stunt clown . Everyone knows Conor just made a social media post about a fight with Tony Ferg
Your no Floyd.  You'll get dat ass whipped!
Who wants to see that shit again... Boring and circus shit..
Bring it to the octagon!
Whoever Conor fights next, he'll be labelled a pussy for not fighting whoever he's not..
Paulie stop it its about the money u will get like 10 mill for the fight ur biggest pay day
This dude Paulie is probably the biggest cuck on my radar right now. The dude is grasping at straws to stay in the spotlight and get Conor to take a fight with him so he can get a decent payday for minimal work. Can't say I blame him, but he really needs to get real with himself and fuck off. Saying Conor has no balls despite the fact that he just boxed the greatest boxer even? This coming from the same guy that claimed Conor never touched him yet we saw video evidence to proof otherwise. Paulie just kind of seems like a pitiful schmuck who's career is over yet he clings to the media to try and stay relevant.
Conor needs to return back to the Octagon. He better not continue in gaylord boxing.
God plz no.
paulie still salty cuz he got his ass whooped. pussy forever.
Paulie Pillow Punches
paulie got hair implants! LMFAOOOO
HAHAHAHAHA Paulie would be MURKED....  WE ALL SAW WHAT HAPPEND
Everyone already forgot about paulie
Conman No Balls Mcbum knows Paulie is speaking facts.... Stick to the wrestling octagon gay ass Mcfaggot.....
Still fucking whining
In Boxing, Paulie whoops his ass, nuff said.
your a bitch Paulie
Fuck off you greasy Wop!  Go back to shitstain Italy you ugly Dago!  #TRUMP #MAGA #WHITESONLY
uploading anything about Paulie is an immediate dislike lol.
This parrot still talking?
Danm this dude sounds sooo salty nothing but hate coming from this pussy!
Still concussed? Pauline?
Balls.
Hes calling people pussy with earings?
MMA 11 yr olds don't want to see Pauline the bitch cock slap Mcgregor the puff 😂
UFC never released the FULL UNEDITED 12 rounds sparring vid smh
who givesa fuck about conor boxing some guy he already starched,.   MMA is where it at  tony vs mcgregor  is a REAL fight

NEW ONE IS BETTER
This may be my favorite review yet, and I haven't even seen either movie. This is so well made, funny, and creative. I'm watching it for at least the 4th time now, & I doubt this will be the last.
Meme him we did.....We memed the hell outta that scene....too funny
The book is the definitive it
The old school comedy at the end is great.
I always thought when Pennywise said They all float down here, he was talking about the kid's corpses floating in the sewers.
I gotta say, the bits with the old and new Pennywise's was some of the greatest NC shit I've seen in a while. For a change, the sketch might actually have been the best part of the entire review (I know the whole review is basically a sketch, but still). Actually, the acting all around was spot on. I dare say everything about this review was pretty great, actually. Great job, guys!\n\nSpeaking of old and new, even if this review did a similar thing, I'd love to see an Old vs. New on IT.
A mass shooting in the first minute, sounds fun!
i find it kinda dumb that the word trigger is used in the same way as the word upset or butthurt
Your testicles will have to drop before you can imitate Tim Curry.
Who is else notice the feral ghoul
Idea: Nostalgia Critic Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull (clipless)
@24:28 KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!!!!!!!
I hate laugh tracks with a burning passion when they are used unironically, its like I should be able to tell when something is a joke I don't need you to point them at. Same thing with those aw tracks to signify a sad someones feelings got hurt but i feel like the Disney channels uses these the most in.
5:58 You're not Tim Curry, that's why he ran!
Penneywise:HI--YAH Georgie\nGeorgie  and me : N O P E
well the chart says
It's funny because I would forget stan existed when reading the book
I know my hearing's pretty bad, but I could have swore she said there was a penis behind the curtain. I do so need my hearing checked.
this feels self defeating.... that was pretty clever!!!
I think the Float part means, When they die in the sewers their body will stay afloat not actuall leviation
This was great it really helps with my depression.\n\n10 out of 10
I really wanna punch that nerd in the face. Nothing is truly black and white in this world. GET OVER IT ASSHOLES!
What did Beverly do in the book???
YES!!! THAT WHOLE JOKER THING WAS ABSOUTELY PERFECT!!! AMAZING!!!!!\nI really wish that Mark Hamill himself would've contributed his time for this. Heck, I would DONATE for him and the animation team to do it!
Good to see daddywise is doing well.
but i like opinions thats why i watch this channel for opinions on my favourite movies
The rock fight in the new it... was the worst green screen in the history of cinema!!!!!!
I am a man of simple taste. I see MTG, I'm in
Both IT movies are shit. Sorry but it's the truth.If you like IT you like shitty movies.\nThis review is better written and was more creative. Doug playing both ITs and himself? Genius. \nThe sad thing is most of the people watching are too dimwitted to notice and appreciate things like that.
He does so much hand motion one he talks
God, how long does it take to write such an elaborate script??
Not to be mean but, where's the Audience Screening of It. I like the other one because it made me feel like I was watching it on the big screen (Which I sadly never saw on the big screen) It was a cool idea. I hope you guys get this message, have a nice day, and keep doing what you do best.
The only issue i really had with the 2017 IT was the odd choice to go from terrifying to non terrifying from scene to scene.\n Like the basement scene with Billie. After he avoids a near death from Pennywise we are cut to a scene of the kids together and Billie is seemingly unaffected by his previous issue.
That it crowd reference gave me pure joy.
Army of Darkness reference! Yes!
The new it is the best horror film ever I don't you forget it whoever you are
This was amazing!!!!!!\nSo many references, beautifully shot, wonderful job done all round
22:58 If you ever wondered what the look of what a constipated clown looks like...well here.
Can you tell they only had one pair of singed hands?
Remake by Stephen king’s it
Nostalgic critic I owe you 10 donuts because I saw 10 red balloons and thought of it every time so tell me where to ship it
I dont remember anybody calling this movie scary. I mean, it was a good movie but it wasn't as scary as other popular films.
fantastic intro. for the record. I loved the previous IT review. great job guys.
I knew you'd make a joke about the children orgy in the book. 😂
Am i the only one who saw richi has boobs
Lol I did not expect the Clown Prince of Crime would make an appearance.
This was a funny and great review. It's perfect. And anyone who thinks different hates all of Nostalgia Critics reviews.
I need the meme me song in my life
Um what does the girl do in the book...?
Let's see what the book says... 😂😂😂😂
Wow, Tamara! I'll have to use your assistance to deliver a type of speech like that on my show sometime. :D
i love how he up talks richie i dont even know if up talk is a real thing
Actually Doug would make a pretty good pennywise.
I personally prefer the remake, because Bill Skarsgard is WAY more scary than Tim Curry was. Having said that, though, the original miniseries was pretty decent, and a VERY faithful adaptation of the book.
You really DO love batman the animated series
Hmmsm. I liked the videos that internet aristocrat guy did. Or Jim Or Mister Metokur. Hey that guy is great. No idea why he was so into you guys.. i mean look at screen junkies if ya wanna dig for dirt. Anwway, was worried you guys would change things up whatever but from that and just gender politics and blah blah... bottom line your cast and writing continue to improve. So bang ons !
That's just typical of you critics isn't tit? xD
I think kids wouldn’t go to a hospital. That lebra guy was just silly though...
I saw the movie and the guy Eddie meets looks like a zombie but he says it looks like a sick guy
I would kill to see Tim Curry be the Joker.
Honestly, when I saw the headless guy I started laughing so hard, becouse it was so predictable.
You know, tonally, this review is very confused\nWell, thats your movie in a nuttshell\nHeh, comedy gold
I love the it crowd.
Hyper Fangirl and Devil Boner are getting married! Is the wedding going to be on or off-screen?
2:54 he now the new host of the crystal maze
Yo why don't you wait till the movie comes out on dvd so you can show us what you are talking about instead of having to act it out
Me: i thought the new 'IT was good \n*sees nostalgia critic video* \nMe: ... Time to ruin my opinion
The NKOTB joke wasn’t about ‘OMG, remember the 80’s?!’\n\nIt was a joke about a boy liking a boy band. Which is something a boy would be picked on for.  If it was set now, they’d probably use Justin Bieber or someone like that.
I still don't get how they don't like the remake ?!?! It was everything they were asking in their real real thought on It and in other kid horror film...It's like snobing it because it got good review or they already hate the source material...The mini-serie was corny, had a bad screenplay and the only saving grace was Tim Curry...mostly because it's Tim Curry. His version of Pennywise is...interresting ??...It's more like a pedo-clown which is scary in a way but not at all like the book...The new version is suppose to be fear incarnate only TAKING THE FORM OF A CLOWN !!!! The clown is not the issue...he's not suppose to be pure clownish...he's suppose to be shit your pants kids cause your fear is tasty scary ! Make no sense for the character to be mostly funny when he's suppose to gain from their fear ?!?! It remake got everything right...the tone...the characters...the look...the scares...and cut the scene we really don't want to see in the book....Can't wait for part 2.
I really enjoyed this review and really funny intro! Your doing great, man.
We’re FRIGGIN CLOWN’S\n        ~Pennywise 2017\nThis one quote deserves an actor
I would love to have seen what Tim Curry Joker would be like.  Fucking great, I'll bet!
My thoughts on the It adaptations:I think Tim Curry did a better Pennywise but the new movie is better, so if you were to have the new it except with Tim instead of Bill, you'd think it would be amazing, but Bill's role as Pennywise fits better with the tone of the movie, sure Pennywise in the new one looks too scary to be able to lure anyone, but if Tim Curry's Pennywise was the one running around, it would ruin the movie, if it was Tim's Pennywise doing the odd run towards Bill or the Dance, the movie would be too fun for it's more horror/ thriller adaption, and plus, the book had Pennywise scarier than the average clown, so I think that the new It is the Definitive It
I never read the book. What could be so bad about what happened in the novel that Beverly and the guys not do in this review?\n*Checks Wikipedia*\nOh...um, yeah. I can see why that wasn't put in the movie.
No joke this is the best Nostalgia Critic Episode I have seen and I think I've seen about 2/3 of them. \n\n+1 For not letting Jim fuck with you and for actually some of his criticism. \n\nI started out watching because I liked your writing and but hated your characters.\n\nI always respected that you took the effort to make elabortate sketches that were not to my liking; but still well done given budgetary constraints. \n\nAs time went on I've come to enjoy some of these sketches and the fact you re-create the story (and also get around not being able to show clips) is something I really love about your work. I say act way because you do improve with practice and with passion. \n\nI also love the black lighting behind you in the B:TAS Card table ref scene. Might try more black behind you instead of white. \n\nHats off\n\n-Austino
Yes the new one can have good part's that are better than the original like the floating scene and yes the booth have good memes like \nThe Classic waha waha and the dancing scene\nAnd i know why you like riche IT's because is finn wolfhard
Ledger was better
Oh hi kids ha ha ha ha

FUCK THE PAINTING.
Love the Fallout ghoul...
that ending was 10/10
he turned into Tommy Wiseau!!!! hahahahahahaha
I love how Critic is basically giving the finger to the social justice yuppies at the beginning. And I love the Abbott and Costello joke
i enjoyed your video, i shall subscribe
I don't get it, firste the critic says that pennywise should be goofy and a little funny because he's a clown, but the he says that he should looks scary, I think that this pennywise was okay
Screw you, Critic. Pennywise's dance was genuinelly scary.
Where did you get the 2017 Pennywise Costume I looked and it is not at spirit halloween or party city so if anyone knows please tell me think you
Was...was this video made before or after the mass shooting in Las Vegas?
Can someone explain the joke at the beginning with the magic the gathering cards? I don't get it
did douggy boy go bald?\nbtw why does doug have a boner for sketches?
Thanks Coldplay
Who came here because of Tibble Slimes?
Lovely. every mix of colors outside of skin tone lol.
So satisfying. Whoever the owner of those hands are, they are so lucky!!! I want to feel and play with all  these slimes.
@Beck I have been the fan for many years. I would like to express the gratitude that I have in my heart 4 all the work that you have done to make my life a movie. I love you and I hope that one day we'll get to meet each other because in my eyes you ra great man
Queria meter a mão nessas coisas aí

Color, texture, and viscosity. Absolutely beautiful.
Génial

Some kind of visual ASML.
Vocals and chorus B52's style.
That purple/lilac slime was pure porn
I just got slimed...
I feel an urge to bathe in playdoh
why is this so satisfying
If you are ihr thanks to Coldplay ✨
am I the only one finding the dark nail art disgusting? Totally ruining the video for me, sorry, ugh!
I love it, I thought it was from Phoenix old records though!
Not surprised to see Beck make slime look cool
The cornflower-colored slime is really nice
Oddly satisfying
He slimed me
This video could have been REALLY satisfying... BUT... dirty fingernails everywhere distracted me from the colors.
Got the album colours and it was great !!!?!!
This song and album is too dope to be true <3
slime 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You want it, you got it! \n      Tactical Sopo, héroe del pueblo

So satisfying to watch
I'm curious, who was the slime artist who made all of this lovely slime? :)\n\nbecause you probably have to be a molecular physicist to make that sort of thing,\n\nand there aren't a lot of those around.\n\nWas David Hanson involved???
[TOXIC DO NOT INGEST]
This is fucking smart
It's a sure-fire stress reliever 😄

my daughter has a sensory thing. She has been creating various slime, goo and bead combinations for years -
1st minute: Oooh.. slime visualiser... Seems good...\n2nd minute: This is quite different from what I've heard from Beck before\n3rd minute: ok, this is getting a little weird.. what am I even watching? What am I doing with my life?\n4th minute: might as well wait for it to finish, even though it's not that interesting anymore
beck is fucking great at following trends
90' artist...
ASMR
Beck is back.
i busted a nut
es muy....muy placentero verlo
B-52s
This almost qualifies as visual-tactile synaesthesia.
So satisfying.. so hypnotizing
mmmmm
Is beck trying too hard to be 6th graders? Whatever because this song is great
Find my way through the lost jizz...
This is absolutely GREAT 80's music.
This video made me slime,i mean,smile
Is this seriously the official video
This song does nothing for me.
I 'will love to eat this video !
3:28 widest panned drums! Such a fine piece over all.
Manual work for an original clip :)
r/oddlysatisfying
In which Beck showcases his daughter's awesome slime collection with an awesome soundtrack.
I LOVE this song! Kinda sounds like Beck has been listening to Justice lately...
I love Beck, But this is not for me
this guy's a fuckin genius
Reminds me a lot of Animal Collective.
i need to hear Beck ft. Calvin Harris
I wish people made slime videos like this ;-;.
what's next, fidget spinners?\nI'd probably still like it tho.
Man that chorus 1:03\n4:14 Brought to you by Node js haha
There's no such thing as good acid but I'm glad someone still doing it
Like an 80’s and 90’s fusion. On repeat all day
This is my fetish.
Beck THIS SONG!!!!! You're so incredibly talented
Beck just saved the year with some others
A couple months late but ok
As a mom, i just cant escape slime...in the house, on the couch, in the garage, baggies of it, cups of it....now on my Beck video lol
I need to make slime right now (I love this song)
Honestly this is so aesthetically pleasing. My favourite is the plain purple slime! My friend who knows I like goop linked it to me, and then I heard it on BBC Radio 1 when Beck came on - this has a lot of replayability IMO!! Great song!!
This is some high grade slime
I need to see the live version of this!
Anyone else getting animal collective vibes from the vocals?
If there's a nontoxic version to imitate, kids with autism would be in heaven to see this.
no man, le re chupo la pija a tu imaginacion
The purple one is the most satisfying.

I'm a 62 yr old dude and I've loved Beck since I first heard him in '94.  Best musical phenom since The BeaTles.
wow, i can't believe this is still the same guy who did Mellow Gold, Still a loser, baby to me, this new stuff is way poppy
i wanna eat some of dat yummy stuff and die
Mello Gold was pure genius. Who kidnapped that guy? Usually I can follow an artist and appreciate changes in their style, but Beck lost me. I have honestly tried.
Im baked nig

this slime looks so cancer causing :O

Get out of my feed
BECK IS SO COOL his vids keep getting better and better
You watch alot of the DYI slime videos on OuTuben, too, I see.
I hope you enjoy the video, if you did! Be sure to Subscribe to see more :)
You are very patronising to your grandad
So you live 2 mins down my road, get the train 30 seconds away from my work and I still haven't seen you irl for years... fml...
your grandad is a joy to watch haha
Bent him over the machine and gave him the finger treatment cause he were paralysed and crying I honestly lost my shit 😂😂😂
Tom, your grandad got it the wrong way around.  If the royal standard (the flag that was above Buckingham palace in your vlog) is flown, the queen is in residence.  If the Union Jack is flown, the queen is NOT in residence.
Your grandad is Amazing! We Love GORDON! ❤️
ngl i think ur a bit peak to gordan sometimes
*Britishness intensifies*
I was in absolute hysterics from the phone call at the end. GORDON FOR PRIME MINISTER!
Gordon is a LEGEND!!!!
Had the time of his life :D
*Before watching this video.*\nAw hes so cute, so awesome. Keep it up Gordon!\n\n*After*\nYoo Gordon a savage! Bashing heads, finger treatment!
gordon is so adoreable! i love this vlog
Tom's gonna be so upset when Gordon passes away I think everyone will tbh
Tom in March 2018 I'm going on that warship for a ska festival
You had it right Tom, Big Ben won't chime for 4 years.
Your grandad is so cute😩
@ronanmcmahon740
Amazing adventure Gordon continues to be bloody hilarious
@___b.en__
You should go on a helicopter ride and fly over London, it is the best experience ever.
Dude you have the coolest Grandad! Plz make more videos like this!!!!
How can none of them know the national anthem. That's ridiculous.

Old people are the best
Man like Tom on trending and all that.
The queen is in when the royal standard is flying like the one in the vlog, not the Union Jack
I FOUND AARON RAMSEY!!
don't mess with Gordon or he will smash your face in.
So this video has barley 200k views and is in the trending section and has 8 ads in it... okay...\n\nThis guy also conned his fans.
Being a guard must be such a bore

Your Grandad needs his own Insta!! Who cares about people's cats and dogs, I wanna see a page about Gordon!❤
who would id rather be sponge bob or mr t
Did tom just say why do we need a Queen... Does he not realise that all changes to the UK and all changes to the law in the UK she has to approve or disapprove even if the UK Prime Minister wants it or not. The queen out votes them all
Seen how many ads, skipped the video, wasteman.
The flag above the palace was the Royal Standard meaning the Queen was in residence. The union Jack is flown when she is not.
Your grandad is the cutest!!! 😂😊
I HAVE THAT BATMAN V SUPERMAN POSTER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel so happy that I have something in common with tom (apart that we are both from Manchester)
I got 11 bloody ads 😂
That ending tho! 😂
Your right tom about the pendolino or technically class 390 its max speed is 140mph but only goes 125mph
I remember meeting tom at Euro gamer 2013 outside the building in front of the surgeon van I was wearing a Minecraft creeper t-shirt
Ok one thing I wonder what side of the family is Gordon from Toms Mothers side or his dads. He has Tom's mums smile but he looks like his dad as well.
i think toms business syndicate original should sell a light grey jackets just like cordons. id buy that shit! gordon is a legend
Mate it won't even ding dong after they've fixed it😂😂
Your granddad is so freaking adorable!!
Russia is in Asia bro...
good vlog! but 40min is waaaay to long :/
Loses half of his fans album flops 😭
Money doesnt do nothing for you demon possessed bitch so shut the fluck mnm chump..you have no balls..if you did u piece of devil you would run for president and help all your fellow freaks..
This is my opinion but this doesn't sound that good
I love this guy, he's got the balls to say what he feels and everyone else is affraid to do so. Yo Shady :-)
i hate trump, voted for obama and hilary, born and raised in metro detroit, and a huge fan of eminem. but i cant stand that kneeling shit during the anthem. so now i cant be an eminem fan anymore? wow of thx Em
DAMN he aged, but this is impressive!
Even eminem needs to use Trump for PR and promoting his new album, hahahaha. Would be nice if celebrities didn't lecture us about what is right
Hey Eminem, thanks for your support.. take care, stay strong.
Wow that was bad! Eminem used to be pretty good back in the day. What happened to him?
0:03 when you realize one of them niggas in the back had kryptonite in their pockets
I love Eminem but this is sucks.  I'm not talking about the subject of Trump (exactly) just saying it does nothing for me.
is this really eminem \ni think this in not
All u jerks who believe its just a freestyle ,a Cypher, Marshall presented for the BET..open your eyes..coz its a message and ''the calm before the storm'' thats soon to rise..to blow off such sophisticated political criminals in suits and ties as Donald Trump coz  ''Racism is the only thing he is fantastic for''....love and respect to sir Mr. Marshall Bruce Mathers III..love and respect to the former president Mr. Barack Hussein obama II for his noble deeds..heartfelt support and acceptions from Nepal. America!!!!.. unite and rise against!..../ .
Yall should at least respect eminem for being brave enough to make these statements
I this an ad for peer pressure? All the weird looking fucks in the background are black. Eminem is a scared little white bitch...
The only one with the balls to stand up and say it. Can always count on Eminem
Eminem looks so old but he is still beast
I'm just here for the Regal
to be honnest dafuk is this? not heard much from eminem for ages then he do this? guess its one way to get popular again knowing half murica hate trump and half love him so ether way his doomed to get supporters whit it, not hard to see his just after publicity when he go from rapping about killing, lyrics  and how good he is to political crap lol.\nBut dont get me wrong i like some of his songs but when he do shit like this just for publicity and never had anything to do whit political crap before it just get pathetic.\nPS. before the election the left always screamed trump would nuke everyone and so on, well how long have he been in office now? not one nuke dropped, where are all the camps for coloured people the left said trump would make?\nits really amazing people actualy go around still ripping on him after been proven wrong over and over.\nbefore anyone think im a trump supporter im not from murica so yeah didnt vote for him and i couldnt vote for him i simply seen what he done good and bad and compared it to other presidents through the years and of what i seen trump already done alot more good than 2 times voted obama lol
He looks like Mariah Carey's impersonation of him
This is trash if y'all werent dumb you would know that donald trump is really a savior
This wasn't freestyle.\nThis was slam poetry.
I thought he was smarter than that . Even with all his resources he doesn't realise there is more to it than left and right. We need to unite not all this divide and conquer shit. Either Eminem is stupid which I doubt is possible with his ryming ability, he is wilfully ignorant or he knows what he is doing and choosing to divide so others can conquer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh6roEF3TXI&feature=em-subs_digest Awesome remix!! Same guys that did the Antoine Dodson one!!
AMEN...High five for Freddie Gray!!! <3 Still fighting for Freddie!! Still wanna know know how a dude 's head was dislocated from his spine???? And NOT one fuckin person was held accountable???
Nice freestyle...but why does he keep doing his freestyles in parking lots & abandoned warehouses?Must be the acoustics.
If this wasn't a freestyle, He would have destroyed trump.
God hears us one day he’ll would get red of Donald trump amen
Anyone here remember the band Eagles?
Weird. I guess it's hip. Oh well, I thought there'd be music with the words
I don't like to be given and ultimatum so i choose neither
Good message, not so good freestyle but there were some good parts
Eminem look like an old dad
Is he emenim\nHis look is very  change
C R I N G E ! ! !
One of my top fave rappers ever. Always on point.
Like the message but no flow
Yo this is real lol
Minority groups like Trump voters need to understand that Eminem speaks for America.
he just told the future basically because that gentlemen that was just ambushed in Africa was in Iraq rip much love to all that serve for our freedom. and can't forget the ones that stand for it to. but happy belated birthday marshal I join you on the same day I'm a tremendous fan. I support you to the end. I'm not a s.t.a.n lmao. much love from iowa
I was moved by eminem!!! He gave it to him. He is one of the greatest to ever rap.
Oh god. you sad little twat. you've become the very thing you built your career criticising... a sell out media puppet desperately trying to claw back cultural relevancy by jumping on the hate trump band wagon. I wonder if this childish tirade has anything to do with your new album coming out soon.\nwashed up has-been, media hack who's run out of ideas... that's how you ended up eminem. congratulations
sorry,em that was lame
This is junk
FACK TRUMP
Legend
#fuckputin
is than eminem?

You're orange so edgy
Last attempt to grasp fame.
playback on 1.5x gives old eminem vibes

8 years
This Is Overrated!
Em lost it
Can u stop removing dislikes? Thanks
epic
Build that wall
Garbage.
Even Eminem Is Old He is still good
Misogyny is the only thing you fantastic for.
I thought this guy was supposed to be a rapper - his shit don't even rhyme. why don't you rap about hillary carry hot sauce in her purse. That bitch is the real racist - talks down to black people, lies to get their vote, then forgets about em
I used to like Eminem until he became retarded, well in that case, Ive always hated him
Sounds like some has - been that needed some publicity because he’s slowly fading away .  😞
this shit wack.  m&m is a hasbeen , washed up, just sayin this shit so he still looks cool in the black community eyes...
s u c k s
lame one trick pony and that trick is old. time to grow up and get a real job you're almost 45.
Is this a cena rap?
What an idiot! He looks like in deep need of money.
yall dumb. mane did this actin out for straight publicity....and he sure got y'all...smh
I made a remix of this freestyle with an instrumental . If you want to hear how this sounds with music you can check out on my channel ;)
Go back to shitting on your mom and singing about killing your babies mom you punk bitch
This is coming from sexist and abusive Eminem lmao, yes he was the greatest of his time and is one of the hip hop greats but he is dumb now
Haha wow speaking about our president, blows my mind. Super disrespectful. I wasn't a big Obama or Bush fan but I would never disrespect them like this. Maybe Eminem should move to a different country. I guess Eminem doesn't like me because I support trump haha dang.
Sucka MC! Holy shit this is wack! Thanks for proving my point that's your wack! Bitch! Ass chump!
Isn’t this the same guy that used to call people faggots and queers and stuff? “Like Elton john im just a mean cocksucker?
Here's a bar! Eminem wears diamonds that Africans mine out a dark cave.. Just so he can deceive us and light up the stage
This was honestly the worst selection for US President in history. The fact that we as Americans actually allowed this election to take place is something we should all be ashamed of. \n\nWhether you voted for Hillary or Trump, deep down you know they both were no where near what we needed as our President, especially in times like these. \n\nBut instead of uniting and making REAL change, this election is a tool to divide us further. Demo... Repu... two sides of the same coin people. And as for Eminem, he's  only fueling the fire because that is what he has been told to do. Keep us divided. Keep us weak. Keep us distracted. \n\nIf Eminem was as real as he claims he is, he'd be rapping about what is really going on behind closed doors. Not about some puppet President that holds as much power as he is allowed to by his masters.\n\nAnd I love how a group of black men stay silent in the background during this entire segment. Letting a white man speak for them and get the final say, of course.
Hahahahhaaha guess he forgot Obama dropped.. More than 65 thousand bombs... A year... Every year... Of his residency... Lol
That 1 million likes is such a beautiful thing.
ear rape
Well ... Another  puppet
This is shit.
Do some cardio. Your commie cuck ass is panting!
Goddamn Eminem is getting old
also shit rap
weak as shit. Written ASF. freestyle my ass.
Yeah sick tan -eminem 2017
Screw Trump and screw white people.
All these trump supports and people who aren't even from the US but making bad comments are weak 😂Just scheming. Obviously you do not know Eminem, nothing about what's been obviously going on in politics, or what is a freestyle is. Go take a seat 💺 like kudos to Slim Shady for this. Y'all feelings hurt- That's the only reason y'all cringing and complaining.. Sorry but a wake up call is due. Y'all like a pimple face, indignant, teenager who don't want to wake up for 7am class. 😂 Stop the whining. He just took y'all to school.
this is shit
Sounds like a broken CNN record.
Shalom Eminem. We all thank you for this masterpiece. Globalists will run the world! All races, cultures and traditions will disappear. You are one of our best puppets in music industry. Are you interested in playing a role in a new Hollywood movie?
Trump doesn't deserve so much hate, he's trying to save our country from what its become and restore it. We need to take a stand against the SJW Black lives matter, feminists and LGBT scum that are ruining this once great land.
I just burnt all his cds and deleted all his songs. Eat Shit and die Eminem!
So..basicly his tought of procces is''if you dont hold the same opinion on politics as me,well sorry you can't be my friend,lol. What a pathetic cu nt,mindset of a middle school child he has. Hahahaha
the first half was so cringe
He say trump gonna bounce when the bombs start dropping? U think eminem wouldn't do the same? Another rich hypocrite. fyi i don't like trump either. or hillary or obama. the whole system is screwed up. Next election let's elect a bunch of sane homeless americans to office. Instead of a bunch of rich pedos and rapists. cuz our current elected officials and celebrities are all too rich to understand what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck. but that's how they keep us slaves. And they use rich icons like eminem and trump to keep the agenda going. controlled opposition. keepin us divided so we don't work together for real freedom. keepin us on our phones and computers. so we don't talk face to face.  labeling us black, white, yellow, brown, etc... to put us in boxes. separate.  we are all humans who want freedom, peace and happiness. Stop buying their albums and stop paying taxes and see how quick these rich assholes change their tune.
was gutted when you didn't try the urban outfitters dress on :(
I LOVE your makeup! Minimal face makeup and eyes and a bolder lip. Very different than a lot of looks that you rock, but it's perfect and I want to try it!
Really digging the minimal makeup and that you can see some of your beautiful freckles more! Love the vid as always Helen!
Do you ever shop in Pull & Bear? I just imagine a lot of the stuff being things you'd wear!
Just wanted to comment on how stunning you're looking in this video! xo
I can’t find a good pair of jeans anywhere!! I’ve tired topshop Jamie jeans (last 6 months) tried new look (sizing is so bad), asos again sizing issues (always falling down) superdry jeans (too pricey & fake pockets) so any suggestions I’m open too XD.  #help!!!
Ordered those slouchy tops you love from UO today a rose colour and dark grey cannot wait to try them now I need that button one. Love you xxx
Helen you look stunning in white! 😊
That pink jacket screams Dolores Umbridge 😂 but I love it
Those shoooeees!!!!! 😍  And I love the toned down makeup look!
Loving the simpler make up on you ..so pretty
I've just found you through Megan and I'm SO CHUFFED! You're wonderful! New fan :)
I love your hair with that bow it looks soo cute!
Why didn't she try on the dress?  I wanted to see it :(
Hi Helen ! In what size did you buy the yellow jumper from Zara? Just asking for reference, I like my jumpers to be oversized but not too much 😅😊
Oh my gosh you are soooooooo beautiful ... I love the no makeup look and your hair are on point  🤘💗🎀
you look sooo beautiful! love the minimal makeup look on you!! 🤗💕
looooved your hair and makeup in this video helen! x
Where are your pants from ? The ones with the cow print ? 😊
I don’t know why Helen, but you are one of my favorite youtubers! You are always so happy.. I love your editing... the colors.. the music and ofcourse your style! You are just so cool :D
Primark have jumpers almost the exact same as the one around 5 mins, it's chenille! Th only difference is the neckline
Eeee I have that white jumper with the fluffy sleeves and I adoooree it!! It's so nice on and super comfy 🖤
You look so young and fresh in this video! Would love to see an updated skincare routine, your skin looks amazeballs.
I love the lipstick you're wearing in the cut away!!!!
OMG YOUR MAKE UP LOOKS STUNNING! love love love it!
You have the most beautiful facial bone structure! ❤️ kisses!
Can you consider signing up and selling on Depop please!? LOVE most pieces you wear.
You are literally the girl in me before you. You look and sound the exact same
I dont want to say that i like you way more without much eye makeup or in general makeup, but you LOOK SO GOOD and fresh without heavy makeup! It looks so natural and ..just great! :)
Crazy I never noticed your eye colour before! Must be your makeup today -  😍
You look AMAZING in everything 😍😍😍
That white jumper from Zara looks\namazing on you! Reminds me of Christmas!!!
LOVING LOVING LOVING you in minimal makeup you look so fresh and Parisian!
Makeup looking lovely! Few things will be seeking out this weekend. It's Prince of Wales check, rather than dogtooth or herringbone x
Omg you look so pretty with minimal makeup!!!! ❤
You are so beautiful Helen x
Loveing the makeup! You have beautifull skin and don't need foundation :D
I love the way you manage to make everyday or more casual outfits look really interesting and glam. You have the best style :)
everything about you is perffffff xx
You are so beautiful. Your lashes are just INCREDIBLE.
Just wanna say how much I love your videos and the effort you put into each of them. Got a little bummed when I didn’t seen “try on” in the title, but alas! You tried things on (I hate when hauls aren’t try ons, you don’t know what things look like!) You never disappoint.
OMG, babez, you look so cute today! What is that lipstick you're wearing in the try ons? It looks so beautiful on you! Pls let me know! xx
Always find it weird  I see stuff I already own in hauls
ahhhh I’m trying to save money😩😩😩😩😩
Where's the jumper ur wearing from? It's amazing
This could've potentially been a very expensive video for me to watch, if I didn't have to shop in the girls/teen section of every store! 😂😂😂
That top at the end went with everything you put on! Love it 😍
Actually loving the lighter makeup on you, looks so fresh! And that white jumper from Zara wowza! XX
@Helen if you want to revive your old face jeans you can buy some dylon dye that you put in the washer, worked a dream for me! hope this helps!!<3
i looove the lace up kinda jeans so much!!
As soon as you said that you’ll love this jumper I knew which one it was before it came up, saw it the other day and fell in love 😍😍😍
On the white boots, the right foot has a stud missing.. unsure if you noticed?! 💗💗
I love the fluffy sleeves from Zara - such a statement piece :) xx
I bought a mustard jumper just like that yesterday but in Primark, fucking LOVE it!! So warm and incredibly soft 😍 \nLove, love, love your sense of style! 💞 xx
The v neck on the rusty/mustardy jumper looked really flattering on you, Helen! Really lovely. Love your hauls :) x
Your pink coat YES I'M IN LOVE
You didn't show us you in the yellow dress!!
I absolutely love how mustard colored clothes look with your purple hair 😍
Love love love that you have your own style and that you aren't like all the other you tubers that are carbon copy's of each other. So refreshing 💕💕
Those bright pink trousers look so good on you! I'm loving everything you've gotten in this haul 😊 x
The slight rumbling makes me think of paranormal activity when the bass comes up when crazy shit is about to happen
They do the coat in grey as well - bought it a few weeks ago it's amazing!!
You look so lovely and fresh without lots of eye make up!
You look AMAZING in the cutaways!! I don't know if it's your make up or weight loss but your face just looks incredible, and obvs just love this video because what's not to love 🤙
Hel you look so cute and fresh faced in the cutaways where you’re trying the stuff on!
Love your style Helen- so fun which is what fashion should be !
looking so cute with this make up 😍😍 great video Helen 😊❤❤
On the white boots there is a big stud missing ( right side of the screen)
Helen, how do you like the UO top? I've been eyeing it forever and am on the fence about buying it because I'm plus size so I don't know how well it'd fit me.
Do a video with all your favourite new looks!
The fact that I can kinda hear the music but not really is making me crazy
I love this makeup!!!! Like the minimal eye and brighter cheek makes you look like a beautiful doll!!!! Love u <3
You just ooze beauty and are so stunning ☺️ I genuinely dig your whole aesthetic ❤️❤️
I love white boots! I have a pair of white platform ankle boots with a three inch heel, the entire thing made me five inches taller! I wore them to death though and I think they only have about two wears left before they really fall apart!
I was watching this intro thinking what have u done different your makeup looks so good and fresh!! Then u said u had hearsay any on 😱 man I wish I looked fresh with no makeup lol
Can we just talk about how everything fits her perfectly?
That's a Helen coat 🍉💜 Love the whole haul. Xoxo
Helen where is your jumper from?? I lurvvvv it xx
Oo I really like those lace-up trousers and that coat!
Yes! Loving the makeup!

Prefer you makeup here
The 'rusty mustard' jumper material is called chenille 😘
OMG! Finally I found a liverpool youtuber! 👏👏👍
I love your videos especially the hauls.. I love hearing you describe items hahaha, rustardy mustardy :)
The material is called cheneille I think ? So incredible in jumper form and doesn't get bobbly !
Haha love you girl your lipstick missing in the corner and mascara  all over your eyelid.  No fucks given
I love your style! ❤❤❤
Loved this? Where’s the cute blue tie up top from? xoxo
Why are British youtubers so spoiled,snobby and self absorbed? Zoella, her bf, this one? And why r they always trending? Is this remotely entertaining?
Pray the rosary everyday and quit the vanities of the world, because the world is passing away and the life of the soul is what is everlasting
I'll play this on loop till the new film comes out.  I don't care Sacred Bones Records buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*
Too spooky I had to listen to it with the sound turned off
*My neighbors threw a rock through my window to the hear this*
Reznor and Carpenter? Perfect match!!! And movie next year,that will be super. I´m sure of it.
Ok guys, since when does the swedish chef  makes soundtracks for movies?
Pretty damn amazing. They should use this in the new one.
Not for me I'm afraid. Waited patiently for the beat to kick in at 6:30 and was let down. I like NIN and LOVE the Halloween theme. Unfortunately, this didn't deliver
Is this the oficial theme of the new movie? looks very creepy
Hell nah ! \nSo thought this was going to be dope but it’s not that great \nY can’t original shit just be left unduplicated & undisturbed 😒🤔🙄😑
Awful. Simply pathetic. They butchered it. Big fan of NIN but this was simply a quick cash in attempt by NIN. Word of advice mr. Reznor: stay away from covering classics and stick to original songs.
I heard the original back when I was 9. Trent is a genius, but nothing can re-capture that terror. I heard John Carpenter came up with it. Talk about talent; he tapped into my fear center when I was a kid. Now; now I'm more worried about insane drivers during my commute. Carelessness is far more terrifying than evil.
This is it. This is the Halloween song I will remember.
Get serious and remix some Silent Hill jams, RezRoss...
Wait.  This is coming out?! Cool!
Oh wow. I love how they stuck to the original then threw in some modern beats. Yes! Love it! Awesome.
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is the best version of this theme, i've ever heard.  Somehow i just KNEW IT WOULD BE.
Trent needs to do In The Mouth of Madness
That Le Matos version tho... (look it up. I can wait)
Sorry, but that first time the piano kicks in is just a piss take.
I hope to god this gets used in the new film.
8:30pm alone in school , puts headphones, turns volume all the way up = A little piece of terrror gets proyected in the mind :)
I like how it incorporates rhythms from the piece Myers House from the original soundtrack
I feel like there was more to Micheal Myers than we know\nLike I think maybe he survived literally everything for a reason\nI think a part of him wasn’t human
pretty sick\nthanks for the upload
Garbage compared to the original
I guess I’m gonna be this guy, but I really don’t like this. The strange pizzicato lead part just rubs me the wrong way; the highest note of each phrase sounds too flat. And most of it’s just “spooky” ambient noise. It ends up sounding like a twisted remix of the original.
Is this for the new film? And is this a reboot?
🖖 I'm slowly peeking with one eye.
i approve of this message
This is pretty terrible
Please don't fuck this up!
Hey guys! You guys think yall help me to get me to 500 sub's? I'll be subscribing back to everyone who comments DONE! My channel consists of vlogs, song covers, and my own originals! Enjoy if you choose to do so! 😄
Subscribe to Colin flaherty the truth ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️the FBI numbers are out
Well the film will be rehashed shit but at least we got this out of it.
Meh . I didn’t hate it but I didn’t love it either . It’s just meh
I feel that if done correctly, you can make a genuine horror movie that will make you scream and jump, but with music just like this. I envision that around 2:00 is when we know that Michael is near but we, just as the main character, do not know where, until the second the music hits 2:09 and she sees him and screams but you hear nothing but the song, before she continues to scream and run.
Finally something I can fall asleep too
Who would be the ideal director for the next one?\n\nMy votes either Darren Aronofsky or Nicolas Winding Refn
This Halloween Michael Myers is coming home Laurie Strode is coming home for the very last time to finally  kill Michael Myers once and for all can't wait to see the new Halloween 2018 can't wait
Master of the ambient background noise
Nothing like perfection! Anything Trent touched is a masterpiece....especially when they work together. Fucking love this! Reznor and Atticus forever!🖤🖤🖤🖤
Amazing additions to a classic! Love it.
350 people do not know genius when they hear it.
Trent Reznor came thru with the jams this Halloween 🎃
20+ years later and that  parts that starts at 2:10 still makes me shiver. Love it!
So will there be a laurie's theme too? It's my favorite.
The ending part is dope! Should be longer.
I expected more, but this is good.
now this is scary! Love it.
I've been a fan of nine inch nails, have to say this is fuckin awesome!
The blackest eyes, the devil's eyes...
Is this is going to be in the upcoming sequel? I heard that a new Halloween project is coming next year so I'm expecting greater things.
It's $ P 00 K Y  S E A S O N
Nothing beats the original
With Trent and Atticus, of course it's brilliant.... ❤👌
What a shit show. This isn't even as good and powerful as the original theme and it's a nutless rendition that's bordering on elevator music. Hard fail, for fanboys only.
Goosebumps!!!
Celldweller did it better.
I KNEW when I saw Trent's name on it, it would be freaking amazing!!!
I heard good things. Will post my reaction after I watch
The most remarkable thing they captured was the dissonance of the original score.  I'm sure the low budget and technology at the time prevented Carpenter from editing the music properly, which created flawed, out of pitch notes which, coincidentally enough, added to the sense of unease that the movie imbued within the viewer.  To capture that essence of imperfection shows how much love and dedication they put into this rendition.
Ehhhhhhhhhh......... These guys ripped off that Lincoln Park song!
Did anyone else have sort of an ear shutter in the last few seconds? For me it seems to happen when music gets so chaotic, and then suddenly calm. It's so strange that music can trigger something physiological and involuntary.
How the fuck do they do THIS?!!
This must be what it's like inside Michael's head😶
wasn't sure at first but i dig
this is super Impressive it makes me wonder what Trent version of a Halloween remake would be since Rob Zombie is such a white trash hack and damaged Halloween to the point of no return.......

00:55 woooooooooooo 🔥🔥
I'll play this on loop till the new film comes out. I don't care Sacred Bones buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*
Dont play Cahill for Ffs i said in my line u play C.Ap A.c Rud \nPlay david in mid we were so rubbish its unbelievable honest why did we not keep the ball bats had his chance i would have played Ped from the starts instead of William our team needs to do some much hard core training we playes a team that have a game since the start . The 2nd goal wtf wtf wtf come on he runs past u and score . Please we need to play A.C Rud at the bk . We have serious need of players . Simple
think we should concentrate on europe, man city are looking on another level this year.....
Michy isn't a premiership player we are playing as a mid table side
Bakayoko was the best player. Michy was the worst. And there were some people who said they prefered that formation over the false 9...
Just a shit day. Big players like Hazard, Azpi who are consistently brilliant were completely out of it today. It's clear to see why Michy isn't rated by Conte. We've got Tammy banging them in for Swansea, infinitely better than Michy who imo plays better with a second striker. No Kante, no Drinkwater, no Morata, Moses goes off, just a shit day. Happens. Conte should rotate? With what?\n Hasn't got the players or quality to rotate. We move on and we put it right asap. COME ON CHELSEA!
Sophie here! Apologies I meant David Luiz back from suspension not injury! Besides this, I do feel our title hopes are unfortunately over. Our rivals are displaying much better performances. Thoughts??
Things that went wrong for me. Willan ,Alonso,michy. No quality in backup. Board didn't back Conte he was calling for it all summer. Probably a cup top 8 or top 4 in champions league and see pep take the league when we could have build on a winning season
The Kante rumour was meant to trigger you guys. Kante wouldn't get in to that PSG midfield.
Stunning Sophie would love to tie you to that bed and do torturous things to you~ \n\nOut title race is over, Hazard will leave for Madrid because of Willian's wankstain ability.\n\nCahil still starts, Christiensen dropped for no reason. \n\nConte still the stubborn old bag he is. Michi needs to fuck off the Twitter merchant cunt.
Hazard is not a world class player..
I noticed on a football stream the commentator mention that we are at the exact  same stage for points, goals, etc as we were at exactly the same stage as last season. Interesting...
Its not the end of the season just yet and just like last season chelsea will start winning their games and get more points 2 win the league . 4 this season , I think Chelsea might become first and do what they did last season
I can definitely see you Sophie 💦💦
This always happens with Chelsea. Those who run the club run it like a business so they do not invest to maintain the momentum. The root problem is at the top with the board who in turn have to do what the Russian Oligarch says. The incompetence at board level is breath-taking. They do not get behind the manager at Chelsea by investing. You can win the Champions League or the title at Chelsea and still get the sack....that is a dictatorship that demands success yesterday. And yet despite being a business rather than a football club, they can't even run a frigging business properly. The Mancs and the North London lot must be having a right laugh. Mourinho must be so very relieved to have moved on from this Chelsea board. They want success quickly that's why the youth team will never get established in the first team. It gets so very weary and exasperating supporting Chelsea which I have done for nearly 50 years. I knew of the 31 August deadline day that the inexcusable indifference of the Chelsea board to reward Conte for the title was a sign that the lack of depth would mean yet another exasperating season after winning the title. No loyalty to managers from the board, no heart, no steel, no true leaders. And to think some people think they will have a right good go at the Champions League.... It's helpful to not hope too much from Chelsea and why? Because they NEVER LEARN from their mistakes. In the real world those board members would have been sacked long ago. But not at a Business run farce like farce like this lot.  Have something else substantial in your life apart from Chelsea Sophie is my advice.
its about time tammy abraham next season should be first team regular next year man on form in swansea he should play with alvaro mrata week in week out charly musonda shold be given more time
As a city fan I was felling like this when we lost at Leicester and Everton so really Chelsea fans welcome to reality I'm enjoying heaven with city. Secondly best was fabregas and worst Mr invisible hazard
You  are better pundit than some at Sky sports, keep it up . Chelsea will come back
batshuay out. call Tammy Abraham, Even if he is not going to score but he has good movement than Batshuay. I hate Batshuay
Michy isn't as good as other strikers. He doesn't make runs or give defenders a hard time. It was his time to shine but he never. Now I understand why conte doesn't rate him. Just a shitty day but I hope we bounce back against Roma.
the problem with chelsea is your overconfident conte prick! you shouldnt change your winning comibination be it any sport! the guy let costa, matic leave who were key players for you the last time so it shouldnt be a shock to you!
Conte didn't even  commit long-term to Chelsea and he was allowed to get away with offloading Costa, our top goal scorer, one of the best in the PL. Now we're seeing the effect of that. Chelsea is done for now and the next 2 years, we won't win anything. Conte will not attract any top player with this attitude.
Bakayoko and fabregas were the only players showing any real passion but weren't good enough like the rest of the squad. Cahill needs to be dropped completely we have 2 centre backs on the bench who are better and have passion. Willian isn't the same player he used to be which is a concern as he has been so good in the past. Zappacosta looked good when he came on. If we are that desperate for a striker then we should recall Abraham? He needs to work alongside people like Morata to show quality. Simply not good enough.
i don't think you can retain your title. top four/cup is the best for you, but even if conte is not at fault, he would get the sack if he doesn't do much this season. that said, he IS at fault for you lot, sicne he's got shit tactically wrong.
If we still have Costa and Matic in that match .............
Best performance was Cahill , worst was azpilicueta , all the rest were awful
Conte of late is making a habit picking the wrong squad....cahill,willian keep strolling into the team when they are clearly out of form.....rudiger,pedro,christinsen keep warming the bench...why??something is going on behind the scenes and conte needs to sort out the issue.
Sophie babes I wish u was mine so peng 😍❤️
Conte needs to just fucking get over it. work with what u got. we still have enough in our squad to beat a shit side like Palace. He needs to get he head in it because he is obviously distracted by something.
Can someone tell this chick that its not about the selection its about the whole team... We needed reinforcements in the summer.. Maybe Cahil shouldn't start but having Willian and Alonso with no replacement... Michy aint a  footballer!! \nAnyone that thinks Michy is by any chance better than Arsenal's Yaya Sanogo then you're deluded!!!\nI don't know why i'm commenting here...fuck this shit hahaha!
I think Tammy Abraham is better than Michy. 4 Epl goals in 5 game is absolutely good talent.  We need to back him because off we need him.
we'll be okay against Roma
Unless Man City do an Arsenal and crumble spectacularly towards end of season, then the title is surely theirs.. This Chelsea squad isn't as good as last years. Sell Matic get Drinkwater?! Transfer window was a joke, Morata is good but he's just one player. We're gonna be fighting for a top four place for sure!\nStill early days, gonna reserve full judgement until around November. Echo other comments would like top four finish with stronger emphasis on Champs league.
Babe shows us some cleavage when Chelsea looses as it will at least help a bit
Oh Conte's a little bit rubbish now.. Just go do one Sophie ffs
Please popularise this comment to conte. Some improvements: buy aubameyang to play him up front with Morata. Also, get Sanchez. His skill works amazing with hazard and pedro and Willian. Imagine that. Sanchez. Aubameyang. We have the money! Cmon conte!!!!!
Yeah, concentrate on CL That'll help.......
Can u dress like u did in soccer am
Well firstly Rory never has a clue! Didn’t see the match today first one missed in ages , I do agree we won’t win the league. Man City will easily but we should try and at least push for 2nd or 3rd
We need Jamie Vardy pay the 40 or 50m
Got a phone number ?
It’s funny coz I was getting clothes for my holiday and there was a palace supporter severing me and I was like I think palace will win as a joke and he was like nah Chelsea will smash us and here we, I was right even though I didn’t want to be 😂
Drinking water,)\nToday in Liverpool vs man United\n one  player\n he looks like a big STARS on the making.. unbelievable \n.. 11..⏳👌👏
Batshuayi looses the ball so easily, he just can't hold up the ball. On top of that many players underperformed today ( don't want to pin point them ). Yes after this game the title hopes are realistically over, unless we pull off something great.
really dislike michy as a player
4 min in and your analysis is....what is it exactly? You are not consistent and you are too emotional. I will chalk it up to thinking with you heart. \n\nGive credit to Palace and the position they were in. They don’t want to break the record for worst start to a season. Zaha has always given us problems and was running riot on Cahill and Alonso. Townsend and C are quality and the ball and luck was with them. \n\nChelsea was looking forward to midweek obviously. The analysis is quite easy for an educated footballer/supporter. I know you have it in you. \nI recommend writing up some outline notes and maybe watch highlights to refresh you memory. I support  you and your Channel and I love you as a fellow fan...and of course dem tig-o-bittties heheh 😏\n\n#COYB
Hellooo gorgeous, u look healthier than the previous video..I think baka n ces should not play together.. agree w/ u Rudi, Andreas n Azpi as the back three.. and why Willian Conte????
I want to see only two things this season, and you know it...
Sophie is class,speaks a lot of sense. - Manchester Utd fan.
Fabregas was world class that match, it's a shame he was the only one who was half decent though. Even Bakayoko was average because, apart from his goal, his performance was sub par. I still have faith in Conte to bring us back into the title race however. COYB
This season is all about the Champions League. If we finished 4th, that would be fine considering our injuries and lack of depth for now. Roman is all about the CL and unless we take points from Roma, it's going to be ugly. If we don't make the round of 16, the season may be the Mourinho year we didn't think possible. Would back-to-back losses to Roma be the end of Conte? He looked pretty angry in the post-match press conference. Too bad there's not an October window.\n\nMitchy showed what no one is willing to say, and that is he doesn't actually create anything and he's scored his goals almost accidentally. Better as a sub when nothing else is working. I wasn't surprised to see Musonda. I expect to see him play v. Roma, even if Conte says Morata will play.
You are going to be very happy I suppose when Conte leaves !! Mitchy suuuuuucksssss
I hope you manage to decipher that I am a real Chelsea Fan amongst the idiots in this comments section, born and raised Chelsea Wharf and Worlds End.\n\n1.What's the big crisis? We lost to the current premiership leaders 1-0, and lets be honest they have been killing all the competition 4-0, 5-0, 7-0 etc.\n\n2. Palace away , who lets not forget are great going forward.\n\n3.A depleted squad with an own goal to boot.\n\n4.INTERNATIONAL duty meant players got injured and fatigued.\n\nCmon you Blues!!
Everyone was just bad, no one did any good.....
I want to be with you in your flat Sophie
Not only were Chelsea the first team to concede to the one of the worst premier league teams ever (not scoring for 7 games straight, losing all) but they also lost to that team.\n\nWow....
clickbait
I've seen your tits😳
Embarrassing...nothing more to say.
Llorente didn't want to join Chelsea, prefered Tottenham anyway.
Highlights | Live Match Review?
😍😘😗😙😑
Bring back Tammy, play Christensen, Rudiger, Azpi! :(
Hazard was terrible
who's zara?
except bakayoko nobody was good without kante
Best - Zappacosta Worst - Luiz
You missed MATIC !
Fuck u guys
Poor game
Title hopes are gone :(
Tammy Abrahams to be recalled?
bring back tammy ffs
Ur so beautiful baby girl
I fking called it.. if rorey stops doing those 5 reasons that we smash crystal palace and such bullshit and jinx the damn team always against these minnows it would be appreciated. lol
The Atletico was one of my favourite performances ever from us, we actually attacked. City was back to normal, just trying to sit back and defend, and a poor team choice from Conte, then this game was just embarrassing, we had players missing but still.
Now you see why Michi should not start.
can we play you every week......and didnt we beat you last season......get over it
Yes Sophie we had an arguement few days ago about  this game, as we all worried  about it, as we all can smell problems in our team. Palace is not an average team, they are loaded with some very good players and a very good coach. Zaha  is probably better than most of the Chelsea attackers, and Townshend is a better  winger than any Chelsea's wingers. Conte is very upset, very angry and probably will not sleep for a few nights. he knows he made mistakes, and he is a very good learner. Let's hope  he will do his homework well. Problem is not just a debt. We have now 4!!!! injured players and at least  2-3  completely  out of form. We do have Musonda and we do have Kennedy. maybe Conte should  give these two  a fair chance
You just got beat by the *CRYSTAL PALACE* football club, formed in *1861* then founded in *1905*
Wahey! Hahahaha fucking palace the Geordie's will show you's southern cunts how it's done next week!
We are missing a leader up front, which is Costa.
Let's be honest.  Conte is going to leave. The board are clearly pissing him off and it's effecting the team.  Not contes fault.  Fuck the board
I tried to troll Chelsea but then realize we have just lost 2-1 to  Watford
Truth. Conte is rigid. Christensen can play on the LCB.\nTruth. Trust a woman's intuition, Rory. Your positivity is on plastic levels.\n\nBest performance is Cesc. Worst is the whole team.\n\nNo chance of League. Don't dream of Cups (except Sophie's). Conte's record in cup competition is abysmal.
Chelshit
The difference between us and the Manchester clubs are why we are not as good as them, our squad is just as good, if not better, but we mess up against teams like this, and when we do win we sit back and defend when the Manchester clubs go to destroy every team. We need to play like we did against Atletico every game, we need to stop this sitting back game plan now.
I only hope Christensen goes to a better team that will value him, why on earth are we not playing a class young CB who will be the best defender in the world.
fuck off   chelsea
Exchange batshuayi for Zaha in January
Hazard is inconsistent for us but for Belgium he bangs in goals all day long
We will still win the league
AXLE IS A BLOATED SHADOW OF HIMSELF, AND THE BAND IS SLOPPY. SELLING A FADED DREAM OF DAYS GONE BYE NOW IS ALL!!
ax i'm not into pink... sorry.
god i love Pink,  best voice around imo,  she can sing anything
What happened to rock music these days?
Pink's great, but who's that fat bloke she's singing with ?  ;)\n\nSeriously, anyone who is surprised by how well Pink can sing really needs to go back and listen to some of her earlier albums. Take away the hip-hop wannabe singles and she was every inch a pint-sized rock star. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwaJbRBdoTU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDKGWaCglRM\n\nHer guitarist, Justin Derrico, absolutely blazes live - well worth checking out.
This is epic. One of my favorite female singers with one of my favorite bands growing up.
Damn Axl go on a diet and lose weight. You will look fkn amazing then. GnR 4ever!
Loved this. I have loved. GnR since 88 and Pink was F'n amazing.
Pelo menos ainda assovia bem
I love P!nk's voice.
Neil Young was right.
What is it with middle age musicians (they’re not stars) and their inability to not dress like a 16yr old punk kid?
Guns N' Roses' latest chapter in their how to destroy your legacy book
Glad I got angus young as special guest!
Axl and P!nk, both in their prime, at the same time, that would have been a historic duet!!!
Pink Fucken sucks another  band letting there music get fucked up by these absolutely shit pop stars
greatest front man  ever period! axl rose
Song is very nice.but…Axl is still fatty.
Love it!
She sucks
nice pink uhuu
I’m so glad Axl doesn’t sound the way he did from 2010-2015. It was like a mixture of a really drunk Willie Nelson and Mickey Mouse on a bad acid-trip. Slash murdered this shit as always! I saw them 3 times last year and I loved every show!
That was pretty cool!
Another video to add to my P!nk collection!
Pink has some records to sell to those middle aged fans out there..give credit to her agent for showing up with Mickey Rourke for 30 seconds\n*LAME* sell-outs
it' s true love :)
😁 Wish Trump would have walked out and said I told you peeps that is all you need. 😁
Honestly, they sound better with Pink. That's exactly what they need. She can really hit those high notes, and she sounds very strong, aggressive, soulful. She has stage presence, looks kinda badass, and doesn't mind running around half naked. That's exactly what Guns n' Roses needs right now, to make up for Axl losing a step. If Pink came out in leather with her tits out, hitting all those high notes, nobody would notice Axl being old and fat.
I respect pink but as far as guns and roses I'll refer to Jason newsteads..opinion. Show up on stage on time. Don't make a habit of starting the show 2 hours late that's disrespectful to your fans and road crew. I'd never pay to see them live.
She's so out of time; very annoying. She's got a great voice, but this was a disappointing watch...at least for me.
I know the world has changed, musical tastes too, but man... They had lots of talent. GnR were a one of a kind.
Vc faz um favor em continuar cantando AXL velhas canções Novas emoções. ....♥♥.
Was at that  show, all good but alllll Slash. Something must of happened to Axl cause he kept running backstage , taking long breaks and having Slash solo a loooot. Overall great show though.
Rock is for the young...This is embarrassing.
Axl needs to lose some weight!. yeah he is 55 or whatever but thats no excuse to not hit the gym and lay off junk food
That moment when you realise your guest sings your song better than you......
Pink SLAMS Rose with just a few seconds Lol! \nBTW that final scream from Rose seems like the sound of a dying chicken! Fuckin awful!
Axl still has the pipes!! LEGEND!!
Slash still looks hot under that hat, hair and shades
Love it.  Axl is clearly whistling with a backing track, but it'd be impossible to pull that off ive every night.
Great video quality! What camera did you use?
Welp...... my life is now complete
Wow what's on his waist ??trash bags?? love the group but why the shaggy stuff hanging??? They still sound AWESOME!!
This band sucks.  Axl Rose is a complete tool bag.  And Pink??  WTF?  Real badasses!  Your street cred is gone.
What camera are you using to take the vid? Great quality for how zoomed in it was.
Thank you for sharing. You've got an excellent camera, what is it?
I had such an awesome time at the concert last night 🤙🏼☠️ sickkkkkk
I hope the it ain’t easy guy keeps his desire for a drug free life. Lots of temptation.

Lol..He is so bad pink had to stop singing so she wouldn't show him up
Which is pink a nd which is axle
Damn axl even whistle like Mickey Mouse. Welcome to Disneyland city where the voice is lost and the vocal chords are ruined. ....
Sorry.. it would have been the best if axl sang the whole thing. I mean pink did ok but the song is axl's.
So many wasted years with Gnr glad to see axel finally came around
Até que ele se tornou um senhorzinho simpático depois de sequestrar o Axl Rose ... Rsrs \n\nBrincadeiras a parte, o vídeo ficou mto bom !!
Great as usual. Never disappoint
I can not love this enough
I love you Pink
Yea she was always a huge fan! Good for her man!
My favorite band back when. Miss those days
She said stuck in the ground should be stuck in the crowd but overall she sounded great.I'm technical is all so don't mind me.😉
We Want FINCK NOT PINK !!!
Totally boring till pink arrived

How beautiful! !!
She sounds like crap...omg

pink messed that one up
damn pink is fatter and uglier than usual
Fuck you fuck boy.  Eminem is a shitty rapper, this rap was shit and you apparently are a litter box of a person.   Fucking tool
Right now I want an Eminem rap-metal album
Ahh, I smell the tears of Trumpflakes on the breeze.
You convinced me that 2017 RATM need Em not Zack. lol
So many butt hurt Trump flakes in the comments
Eminem actually has a Zac De La Rocha flow on this
this gonna be the anthem  for the resistance
That was pretty great, Sir.
Donny's bitches are salty about a freestyle by a reportedly irrelevant rapper.
I got banned 4 times from Facebook this year for talking shit to Trump fuckbois, it's almost as if they need a safespaces or something, fucking snowflakes.
You are still the best mash-upper od the world!
it's honestly the perfect mashup. fuck the haters.
This works almost too well together. Eminem, one of the greatest rappers of all time, mixed with Rage Against The Machine, one of the greatest metal bands of all time. I LOVE IT!!!
This is an Anthem....Well done...this is going to break the internet...
Fuck yeah!
FUCK YEAH!!!
OMFG yes. God damn.
This shit slaps
Look guys, Trump and his supporters have it really rough right now, and I don't think it's fair to keep making fun of them.  Sure, they've made some mistakes: their entire party is being swarmed by white nationalists and neo-nazis, the Russian collusion investigation is gaining steam every day, Trump is constantly saying and doing things that are either hypocritically stupid or patently false, their healthcare has been sabotaged, they're mentally gearing up for Twitter-ignited war with North Korea, they're convinced a Muslim terrorist is hiding behind every corner, their country is constantly losing political clout with its allies, they've been inundated with both domestic and and foreign propaganda campaigns, they're being mocked by the entire world, and not a single thing has gone right for them since Hillary lost the election.  Not to mention the fact that Hillary still isn't in prison, the Wall still hasn't secured funding, the swamp is still full, the job market in rural America is still falling, the plan to defeat ISIS still hasn't materialized, and America still hasn't become any greater than is was last year.  Everything they've been promised has been a lie.\n\nWe should take pity on these poor, dumb souls who are so invested in the Trump presidency they would rather die in nuclear hellfire than admit their leader is not doing a good job.
no one needs trump, no one needs eminem...but most of all no one needs profits of rage. we just need ratm...
It felt really awkward without a beat, so yeah, this is fucking gold.
How phucked are we when Eminem has a higher moral compass than our president?!? LOL
Omg two of the best mashed up!! Miss RATM but love that the message can be sent with music!!
I have to say it's nice mash up. I really like Eminem and RATM <3
Dope shit !!! Hottest remix
this is hard and u kno it
(Ft. Macho Man Randy Savage) 😂😂
This is amazing bro. Nice job. Rage and Em should collab on Ems new album coming out
OMG make this happen for real love RATM and Eminem!!! Prophets of Rage also very good tho, but if they get new vocals Eminem should be the replacement.
You know, I was skeptical of how good this was gonna be. But damn. That's a pretty legit mash up.
The upcoming civil war is gonna have some banging music
Holy shit this is amazing. Well fucking done.
i luv u all, thanks o/
If only I had more likes to give. You’re absolutely killing it man. Great backing track for this powerful poetry.
Awesome! A rarity that a mash up actually works!
This is such a smart mix. Loved it.
Sounds a lot better than the new prophets of rage album
When I first heard Eminem’s freestyle, I was like “Eh, that was okay I guess.” This mashup with Bulls On Parade enhanced by a million times. And I loved the quick Macho Man cameo.
This is fucking great
This is fucking great!
love during the choruses you can hear faint glimpses of a zack de la rocha sound alike as backing vocals
This was uploaded on my birthday. Thanks for the amazing present, DJ Cummerbund!!!
That was fucking awesome. I don't know how you got Zack's voice to overlay with Em's but that was fantastic.
this is awesome work. although i dont agree with eminens rant...hes targeting the wrong person...its not trump, its the whole government system - trump is just the logo these next few years - but the work in this mashup is freaking excellent! well done
Some billionaires know pretty well how to earn big money and fame easily with social anger. Easy money. I admire it.
Rage is the best Eminem is nothing without rage. Rage is god, rage is life. Zach is god
This is sick!!!!\nEminem and RATM doesn't get much better!\nThe resistance starts now!
FUCK YOU, I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME!
Trump yards get upset so easily like little  babies
This needs to be an MP3 so I blast this down the road driving
Any way to download this?
This turned Em's trash ass cypher into hot fire. I disagree with what he said but I more disagree with people shouting it was great just because he shit talked Trump. Awesome job.
This makes me wanna hear an actual Eminem and RATM collab album
In the words of the great macho man... ooooooohh yeaaaahhhh
People won't like you for this, I'm sure. Fuck them, this is great on every level.
this dope man f**k trump
most dope~!
fucking epic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pure shit
This is amazing
73 people can fuck thenselves along with drumph
Perfect ! Great job!
Bla bla bla
great mix
This is amazing
This sounds fucking great
LOVE IT! 🤘
f* dope!
Shit mash up
epic!
Fantastic
fuckin amazing sync dammmmm
randy savage clap clap clap clap clap
On repeat! ❤️🤘
Man, this shit is FIIIRE
damn great job!!!
WOW!!
BRILLIANT
just awesome! i love RatM
Don't agree with Eminem's bullshit, but this mashup is awesome!
Yes dj cumberbund you da fire dj boiiii
Making a difference, one Oh yeah! at a time
Wow this is one of the best mashup songs I have ever heard!
My favorite part is that you all have offered such compelling arguments... i may have changed my mind.    \n\n\n\nNope, youre all still fucking morons for liking emeinem and the inability to articulate a real counter argument or stance.
Democrats can get it too!
I'm all for anti trump slogans, but fuck Eminem. Stop ruining one of my favourite bands for me. Fuck this made my ears bleed. Fucking awful shit!
Fuck Eminem and whoever made this garbage.
I like the original better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LunHybOKIjU&t=1\nEminem has more passion, this remix is a joke.
gay like eminem
I LOVE ❤️ this so much!! Once again thank you!! Incredible job. EMINEM AND RAGE ARE THE BOMB! SAYING DONALD THE BITCH FEELS SO GOOD I AM ADDICTED!! This trending why ARENT there more views maybe the RUSSIANS ARE HACKING THIS! THEY ARE TRYING TO STOP THE MOVEMENT WITH  45!! Just a guy feeling.
great job homie
What is that at the end? Randy Savage rapping? XD
So how do you get this to be a trans-atlantic number 1?
This is mix   eminem and rage agains the machine
Great job on mixing these, it's perfect !!!
Can you do another mix with Crowder's version? Pleeaase?\nhttps://youtu.be/NrdT1rEO54c
Eminem is still angry Hillary didn't win. Thank god.
2:02 listen carefully, you guys could recognize Zack’s voice flowing along Em. This is insane!!!
You realize he was saying hate trump not hey trump?
Great band with shitty rapper + shitty rapper with no band = Meh.  Never mind.  It still sucks.
Reminds me of my husband on our wedding day, I cried too.
Should’ve disabled comments
The kid looks so confused.
This is the one time that I approve disabling comments
This is so sweet :,)
n'awww adorable
I wish I had a boyfriend who would look at me like that
When the waiter finally comes with my food
Is that Rochelle's son Jordan?
i'd like to see this guy on a game show
I want to be this in love...
I cried too, but I was crying because i thought my life is over I’m officially her prisoner 😂
Lovely video but just you wait and he will find she was boinking the best man all along because he too emotional lmao
Beautiful 💗
He's crying because he can't get a refund on that atrocious singer they hired.
he's crying because he knows that tonight he's gonna have to stick his dick in that hippo
Black bitch
Black people are so dramatic.
Little boy going damm what a bitch, stahp this is embarassing.
What a fag!
That was like 30 shades of eyeshadow.. I've been following makeup tutorials for a while now. No every day person is going to be able to follow that and honestly it's super unnecessary
Can you paaleeease film more make up tutorials! You used to make so many back in the day! I totally know your so busy with everything your doing and pretty dope to be like “yo I made it.” But My make up game has elevated so much because of you. Lol I’m not trying to be creepy! Just make more damn videos!😭😂 ps love love your paletteeeee!
Jaclyn, I know you'd love the products I sell! We have GRADE A essential oils! www.mojiproducts.com/AriaK
Love you Jaclyn!!\nI started a makeup YouTube channel! Would love for you to watch it!! No judgement please! I just love make up!
Jaclyn I lurveeeee this! I don't know why, but it really reminds me of the song Tainted Love! But the rose gold and the purple are so pretty :)
film some more videos with john! i love watching yall together bc goals af
When are you going to upload the what’s in my bag video that you filmed? 😊
makeup is one of my passions and when I started watching your channel you really inspired me to try new things and to love makeup even more then I already did if that possible lol thank you so much for everything that you do and keep killing it girl I love u
I love the look, but because of using so many palettes, it was difficult to replicate. I’d love to see another tutorial using only your palette!
I love seeing your house in the background instead !!💘
Where is the jacket from?
what do u use to clean up lashes I just got me a pair of there lashes for my wedding
What's on her lips?????
I'm a fan of yours, but this was just ridiculous ...i swear you used liked 20 different shades
why do you use the same brand omg
Thank you for your snap about color range of foundations!!! Im only a medium skin woman and i have issues matching my foundations ... Xoxo
Speaking of Hocus Pocus, these colors really remind me of the costume Dani is wearing and just the overall theme of the movie
Please do your foundation on camera as well! I want to see everything always!! 😊 Love you ❤️
Obsessed with this look so much!!
because you have so many fillers without makeup you look like a puffy blob. the fillers are making your face look lumpy. 2:14
Talented.
that jacket babe!!!!!
Purple sparkles are 28/10
Is there anyway you could make a video on eyeshadow looks that compliment different eye colors? LOVE YOU! SO much!
i am living for this look 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is so beautiful! Can not wait to recreate <3
I like the glitter back drop but the home back drop is wayyyyy more you girl and I prefer the home back drop but a glitter is so exceptable a couple times a month lol ilysm Jaclyn your my fave youtber ever!!!! @jaclynhill
Film a house update video! I'm dyinggggg to see the progress on it
I guess this is why the US is the most envied, sneaked in country of them all.. Any average looking halfwit with decent editing skills can get rich. So sad really.
I feel like the editing was rushed/choppy on this video. But the look is GORGEOUS and you and your husband remind me of me and my husband! So funny!
I like the purple background, but I love when you’re just filming in your bedroom, living room, or whatever with a “normal background.
Writing notes!!! Yasss girl. 🔥🔥🍷

Furnished house tour!!!
What happened to her face. She’s gonna look like donatella if she doesn’t stop wtf
Jac I just wanted to say that the positivity you bring is really appreciated. I just wanted part of a video  (I had to stop it because I was getting a little upset) that someone made bashing you as a person. And it's not just because they were bashing you that made  me upset, I was mostly irritated because they spent time to make a video about someone else and pick them apart. I've been a long time follower of yours and it's always exciting seeing you post videos where you're comfortable and yourself. Long story short, I'm appreciative of the positive community you've built around you
Love you Jaclyn, keep doing you baby! Idc what brand you use as long as the look is 🔥🔥. Honestly people complained about the shipping price from Morphe for your palette and you brought it to Ulta which makes shipping and access cheaper and you made the packaging easier to clean. Thanks for listening and trying to make us all happy. I appreciate the effort and think you are doing great. You are an amazing artist keep it up.
One of the best tutorials there are out there for smokey eyes! Love it!!! I have a question why do you mix shades that much? Is it because you don´t have the exact color or would you do it anyway? xoxo JH
Does anyone know how to block certain channels?  So that I don't have to see them in my recommendations even when I am not subscribed to them.
Big fan of yours. You've taught me almost everything I know about makeup and I love watching you. Follow you on all my social media sites but snapchat videos are my favorite. But if I have a question relating your snapchat videos what is the best way to ask you those questions in reference to your snap chat stories? \nMuch love ❤ - JH
JUST BOUGHT YOUR PALETTE FROM ULTA TODAY for my birthday!!! i love you so much thank you being YOU! your videos always make me happy you’re just so genuine and sincere in ALL your videos i always look forward to them i’ve been wanting your palette forever and i can’t wait until it gets here i’m beyond excited!!!
Maybe I missed it, but I've been waiting on you to come out with your own makeup line for the past like two years when you first mentioned it. Are you still creating your own line or no?
Ah one more question do gel eyeliners dry down or is it like once you have applied it if you rub it it will smear?
Love this look! So pretty!
I use to follow her awhile back ago when she did tons of make up tutorials but now that she is making big money she seems to have moved on.  Good for her that she has the success she has worked hard for but don't act like you care about your followers
Wow. \nYour palette has a new packaging and is being sold at the same price at ulta.  Yet i paid 45 with shipping included and i had to wait for it to be delivered. \nI fuken applied clear duct tape just so it won't get dirty , and wrote the names next to the shadows , to find out u have a better version. \n\nI want an exchange. This is bs
Jaclyn you need to start a vlogging channel!❤️❤️❤️
Your chest and hands are so rosy & pink compared to your face!
You should do a complete house tour now.
This is amazing!! I love it & YOU! I want to try to create this look now :) & keep using Morphe! Don't listen to the hate lol.
You use sooooo many colors in one look like me 🙌🙌🙌🙌 I thought I was crazy 😂
i hate scary movies
Youe makeup always looks so pretty.
More jaclyn hill palette looks pls!!!
omg its so nice!!!
https://youtu.be/7ZpTYXS79CE
hey Jaclyn i just got me palette nd it is awsome  i was not a huge fan of your but now watching and using i am a huge fan of your well done nd congrats ....
Jaclyn your puppies are so precious!!!! What is the breed? Also where did you get them from and for how much? Are they girls?
I love you jaclyn I am hoping to get your pallet for Christmas or my birthday since my birthday is November 21st and I can't wait to play with it again love you
I can't believe how many colors you used on the lid and it came out to such a pretty combination
I love everything. I love you, I love your makeup, and I love your back drops. Just keep doing you. I will literally watch any content you put out. I have bad anxiety right now and watching your video right now is the only thing I can do to help myself.
When you have hooded eyes and eyeshadow never looks this good :(
And your dog is snoring coz your voice and words are so pointless and boring
i am in love! so beautiful!
I feel like this would look so sexy and bombshell vibes with your hair down and waves or loose curls 😍❤️ wish you would have worn it down for the intro. Such a beautiful look! 📸🔮💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
People are hating her but admit it she’s really good on her every tutorial.
I curious why you started with black liner on your bottom water line?
What did you use on the bottom lashes?
Please answer!! How do you get such good pigment from eyeshadows? I use high quality eyeshadow including your palette (which I love) and nice brushes, and I still don’t get good color payoff from eyeshadows on my lid and outer crease!!
Most definitely recreating this! One of my fave looks!
This is what you excel at, tutorials.  Your looks are always really good and you are a good teacher. Please keep giving us more tutorials. :)

Can you do more videos using ur palette? Ita been a week since i bought ur palette but i want to know more what looks should i do
Such an artist! LOVE YOU ❤️
please do Halloween looks I love how you do yours and they always look so real love ya
Regarding your updated eyeshadow palette: After working on the product for 2 years you come out with an update less than a year after the launch?  So glad I didn't jump on the first one! Still better planning and going the extra mile for your subscribers would have been nice instead of trying to cut corners to save money. Debating whether I should even buy the new one, with all the drama surrounding it...
The shimmer on the purple is GORGEOUS😍
Jac u should do more videos using Makeup Geek shadows again !! I would love to see you bring some of the back. xoxoxoxo
Why did you stop writing which products you’re using in the description box?
Can you PLEASE do more tutorials using your palette!
Jaclyn I feel like you are very close to Morphe and trust you for a genuine answer- on their FAQs it doesn’t say anything about animal testing/selling in places where it’s required - can you clarify whether Morphe is cruelty free and if it tests on animals? I feel like I always see conflicting answers on the internet. Thank you!
As soon as I saw the backdrop I though “ hocus pocus”
Can you do a tutorial on the new Anastasia Prism pallet.
Would you recommend for a beginner the Kay Von D contour palette or the Anastasia contour palette??
People are Rude, shes so talented! And a different packaging has people this upset..im getting the original one and Im ok..Im not gonna die, I think my life can go on..jesus Christ...I care more about the shadows..Jaclyn if you ever see this..uggg people are gross with Jealously!! Like noone else tries to make money in this world...the drama gives me a fucking headache and that John Cuntchian I dont know the idiot who drinks the Tea and bitches about everyone...Hes so Jealous of you...ok thats all.❤❤
Sooo..... Can you try to do a wearable look using only halloween makeup? I think it would be amazing to see what you could come up with lol
I love the rose gold! I just subscribed and can't wait to see more of your videos! I'd love for you to subscribe back!
Love this ! 💖\nbut if I try it it would probably look like someone punched me in the face
Where is ur necklace from? I love it! xx
Just a little bit, sprays face 10 times hahahaha
Love this. 💯🙌🏼
i dont ever wear makeup Im just where for your amazing personality 😍😍😍
I’m sure it’s really difficult to use that backdrop, since it’s hard to color balance against it. I personally don’t like backdrops, just you in any room is fine. At some points during this video you turned orange. I think that without the backdrop it would’ve been easier to see all the colors in their true form just against your skin color.
Jaclyn! It is also a tradition of mine every October to watch Hocus Pocus (I grew up with it) and I would loooove to see your recreation of Sarah Sanderson's makeup (since she is my favorite witch) it would be soooo cool to have it as a Halloween makeup tutorial on your channel this year (with that same purple background, which actually reminded me of Sarah before u mentioned u were watching the movie)
You seem so tired in this video :( like your bummed about something. I miss your boss attitude and professionalism. The way you used to teach us make up with that raw energy you had was so amazing. Where you at Jaclyn?!
You should do a updated makeup collection and beauty room tour once everything is done
Omg the ending was THE best part. How you expect me not to scare easy if you just took me to see IT a week ago?
*douses self in setting spray* hahaha ily and this looks SLAYS
You got skills! 👏🏼
So pretty!!!!!!!! Love!!!!!! 😍💜💜💜💜

It was just a prank, -Han- Woody!
YEA Gavin is Missing, better hire Dan as his replacement
Cant believe it doesn't run on headlight fluid
That actress is in quite a few things but i know her most from SuperStore
Gavin running into the skeleton in the first Lazer Team was the hardest I've laughed at anything in my life
Bet Gavin is the bad guy or his the one they rescue...
The whole Michael keeps thinking that they are time travelling doesn't make sense. That is something that would be for Gavin.
i loved the first one..... this one looks great!! it helps that hot ass nichole bloom is now part of the team, too.
Seems like Michael got the best lines.
Wait it's coming out next month? Now I'm excited.
Still haven't even seen the first one
They must have won the tournament I guess
Gavin couldn't film because he was in Britain the whole time The Movie
Didn't they lose like $800,000 on the first Lazer Team? Hope you can pull it off with the sequel Rooster Teeth...
I legit just watched lazer team again before i saw this! We doing a fund for this one too?
I'm a bit disappointed that it isn't La2er Team
How long before It's not a DeLorean! becomes a shirt?
I can see that the writing hasn't really improved much...\n(JK, I love you guys)
Oh God, does this mean every single RT video is going to start with the teaser This video brought to you by the new movie Laser Team 2. Coming November 22?
Lazer Team is slowly becoming SuperStore. Can't wait for Dina to be in Lazer Team 3.
aye they got emily from until dawn
im so happy right now!!!!
I bet it's actually a DeLorean.
Why is Gavin/Woody not in that thumbnail?
Is that Emily from Until Dawn?
This one looks wayyyyyyyy better then the first one
I can't wait!
Can anyone please tell me the name of the song playing? It's so goofy I need it.
TBS or Adult Swim will likely air this after AT&T complete the acquisition of Time Warner. RT is co-owned by AT&T. Bring It On! (I have go to watch the first one though).
There are jokes here about Gavin still never being at work, and Across the Galaxy is really just across the ocean in jolly ol' England
Is that Emily from Until Dawn? It looks like her
nice gavins gonna be present for 5% of the movie just like how hes present 5% of the time already
What is it with Rooster Teeth and rifts
How come this community doesn't understand jokes or sarcasm?\nThat's all this channel is
I really do hope it's better than the first one.
change the name to razor team and slit your wrists..
Lazer Team 2: The movie the community wasn't really clamoring for but I guess we'll still watch it anyways and at least we don't have to crowd fund it this time so that's a plus
I love this studio...
Would love to watch if Canada had Youtube Red
With each Lazer Team movie, we slowly replace all the original cast with the Superstore cast
From the thumbnail I was worried they cast Lindsey as the scientist.  thank god it didn't happen.
I am really happy this is coming out soon! way to go RT, I'll see you in theaters next month
So this is it, huh, we're some kind of Lazer Team?
i predict strong 5 out of 10. watchable
is that amanda from shameless?
I'll be honest, I REALLY liked the first movie and I'm looking forward to this one. Maybe it's the fanboy in me talking, IDK.
I feel there going to scale back on the sequel. But I'm still excited. The dynamic between the team and the scientist might be interesting.
*when Gavin is taken* YOU BASTARDS
Jesus wait, I haven’t even seen the first one yet...I want to if you wanted to know
I have yet to see the first one, and you're already bringing out a second. Bravo, dudes and dudettes - bravo!
...I see the writing is still clever.
first one was meh, but I liked it just cause of burnie, michael, and gavin...this one looks meh, but I will watch it cause of burnie, michael, and gavin
*AND YOU DIDN'T BRING ANY EXTRA PLUTONIUM?*
I hope the dialog volume is a bit higher in the movie than in the trailer, some of the texts were hard to make out.
all aboard to the HYPE Train!
IS THIS ONE PLAYING AT TORONTO AFTER DARK TOO???
Reviews for the first one weren’t good, because people never watched roosterteeth, the jokes were great and I loved it, this looks even better
Is that emily from until dawn? if it is and you didn't make a joke aout the butterfly effect i will be disappointed.
They got that one girl from shameless.
This and the first Lazer Team are the main reasons why I have my YouTube Red account. I'm so hyped!
Really hope this is rated R...
Anyone wander why this is on trending with 200k views and h3s video with 10mil in one day wasn't... YouTube there's other ways of advertising! Which are fairer too
I feel bad about Gavin, he is poor when he got stuck across the galaxy, but I like the girl's hairstyle.\n👏🏻🖖🏻👌🏻👍🏻✌🏻️😃
I wish I still had YouTube red!!!Because I love the first one!
Nicole Bloom who plays Amanda from Shameless. Yes, she is topless in that show. You're welcome.
Only issue right off the bat is I feel like Gavin isn't going to be in much of the movie, and Gavin is one of my favorite parts of the first movie so I'm really not sure how to feel about this trailer
For some reason I can't be excited for this idk why
End of lazer team 1: \n*Ice cube's voice*\nyall motherf*ckers is going to space

Please share your experiences/relationship with alcohol in the comments section below, we'll both be reading them all! xxx
I LOVE HOW YOUTUBE KEEP PUTTING YOU AND LUCY INTO TRENDING OMG YAS QUEENS YAS
thank you so much girls for talking about such a sensitive subject 💓x
Good video, important topic. But, it’s only about binge drinking. The silent drunk holding a job is who kills you with a car.
I had my first drink at my first college (uni) party and since I've turned 21 I only drink when I'm with friends and it's just fun to drink with them. I never drink alone.
This is so needed in our society to talk about this and give it exposure. Thankyou for doing this 💖💖
I have only drank a bit of wine in a church when I was young and nothing after that. I'm soon-to-be 20 and I don't drink. I do go to the bars and clubs with my friends still and I have fun, maybe even more than they do! I love dancing so i really enjoy clubbing and then just the overall buzz of the night like Melanie said. People usually think that I would be blthered if I was around people who drink but that's not true either! So I'm glad that you are talking about this because like in Irelend in finland the alcohol culture is a big thing and kids start really young...
I'm a muslim never drinks so idk why I'm watching this lol
I liked this video! I just wanna say that addiction doesn't form because of why you're drinking, it's how much and how often. It doesn't matter if you're drinking socially or drinking because you're sad, addiction can form either way. It forms when you drink too much too often. How much is too much depends on every person. Size is a factor, but family history is also a factor. If you are a heavy weight then you are more likely to become addicted. If there is someone in your family who is an alcoholic, you are more likely to get addicted. It's important to actually research the science and know exactly how much is too much for you.
I live in South Africa and we have such a different drinking culture... like a lot of people don't drink, and when we do drink it's at a club or a big party. Obviously it's different in different circles, and there are some people I know who were alcoholics at 14 and stuff, but the legal age is 18 and it's generally considered bad to drink younger than that (even though most teenagers have at least tried alcohol before then). A lot of parents allow their underage children to drink at home to kind of expose them to alcohol for the first time in a safe environment. We don't really have too much of a problem with alcohol here, the main concern is just drinking and driving because we drive everywhere (busses don't exist, the taxis like... aren't at all to be trusted, and you'll probably get mugged in a train/walking home if you're drunk late at night). So ya. I'm 18 so I don't have much experience with alcohol, but I definitely only drink when I'm in a good place in life. When I'm going through a bad phase I actually convince myself that alcohol is only a bad thing and I won't drink because I've completely convinced myself that it'll completely ruin me. So that works for me haha
I'm 19 and I'm from Italy. At the moment I can't drink for some health issues, but I never ever got drunk! I started tasting alcohol at a very young age, but this has taught me to appreciate it and to drink it for its taste and for pleasure, avoiding to get drunk. Here we have a very strong alcohol culture, and with this I mean we have a lot of different wines and liquors, and also cocktails, that we enjoy in particular occasions. For example, I'm absolutely in love with spritz 😍, which is the most important part of aperitivo
In Switzerland the legal drinking age is 16 for beer and wine and 18 for everything else. 👌
I reckon binge drinking can be really harmful and it's a safe option to usually drink in moderation 😉❤️
I probably only drink 2 or 3 times a month, and it's usually 1-3 beers with friends at game nights at someone's home or seeing a band in a pub. None of my friends really go in for the club/binge drinking scene, especially since uni.\n\nI noticed the same relaxed drinking culture in Italy. People would meet up for 1 or 2 drinks to hang out and chat, but I don't remember ever seeing anyone drunk in public, except American study abroad students.
I'm going 15 in a few months and I'm in 3rd year,  everyone  my age is starting to drink and hallowe'ens coming up so everyone In my year and younger is drinking. But I'm not really into that I don't like sneaking around drinking without my mam and dads permission and I'd feel too guilty drinking behind my parents back
I'm Australian and we also have a very prominent culture of drinking and underage drinking. To drink a bottle of wine or a six pack of beers on a weeknight is considered very normal among my age group. I'm 20 and spend pretty much every evening with friends after work/uni etc. I'd say that I drink at least 6 standard drinks 5-6 times a week but that doesn't make me drunk (I've probably heightened my tolerance a LOT). I never see friends without a couple of drinks at the same time. I feel that none of us drink to get drunk at all, its just a pleasant (and delicious) addition to the vibes. Because of this there is no dependency there or anything.\nEven my parents have a couple of drinks and a good chat to debrief every night after work.\nWhere I live, drinking is a natural part of everyday life, but for the most part it's not done in a destructive manner.\nPs loved this video - so interesting!❤❤❤
Binge drinking is considered normal to a lot of college students and people in their twenties here in the U.S. I regret most of the binge drinking I did in my youth. Now I rather enjoy a really good cocktail, glass of wine, or fancy beer.
I'm 13 in second year and if anyone drinks people always talk shit about them and no one really does so cause it's really looked down on like
i'm giggling, I was raised in Germany, legal drinking age for beer and anything under 5% alcohol is 16, anything more than 5% is 18, and most kids start having drinks/getting drunk around 12. the full blown cliche lol
I'm from North Wales and I think that the drinking culture here is very similar to that of Ireland, or maybe it's just the particular place I've grown up in. I started drinking when I was around 13y/o, nearly 14. Myself and my friends would ask strangers to go into the shops for us and I would drink, usually, a whole bottle of 20cl straight vodka most Friday nights before going ice skating! My worst years of drinking were probably around 14-15 when I would go to house parties most weekends. I was in a long term relationship from 16-18 and realised that my drinking slowed down, and even since turning 18 I didn't go out regularly like my friends did, I thought maybe I was over it since I'd been doing it since such a young age. However, now I'm nearly 19 and just started uni in Liverpool and I've found that my drinking habits have worsened quite severely, probably due to my relationship ending too! I think the UK as whole has a really bad drinking problem, especially compared to abroad!xxx
i'm Scottish, we're not much better.
I don't know why, but I grew up being anti-alcohol even though both my parents were (very moderate) drinkers. At 15 my friends started drinking so I had to loosen up, but then at 16 a very traumatic event that has shaped my life happened, which included alcohol. And I decided that I would probably never drink again in my life
I'm in my 20s and I don't like to drink. I don't like the taste of alcohol or the way it feels once it settles in my stomach. I've never gotten drunk or tipsy. Before I turned the legal drinking age in my country I was so excited to finally be able to drink but now that I've gotten a taste of alcohol I don't fancy it at all. I guess it's a blessing.. I save money and I'm doing my liver a favor as well.
I got into a habit over the summer holidays where I drank more or less every single day and was drunk each time (I'm 18 next friday) and I put myself in so much danger and I ruined many relationships in my life. I did this because I was severely depressed and as an Irish person the drowning the sorrow culture was the only way I knew and although some of the times it was great Craic most of the time it was VERY bad I think I did become dependant on it because now I always want a drink but I haven't drank since the end of August and I'm going out for my birthday in two weeks to drink and I know how to control myself now thankfully
Drinking culture is really rough where I live. I live in a very religious place where drinking is strongly discouraged. Because of that a lot of young people (and really all people in general) are never taught what responsible drinking is. I'm grateful that I have a pretty good relationship with alcohol. I never drank in my adolescence. Now that I'm older I definitely enjoy having a drink every once and awhile. But it's pretty occasional. Maybe once a week or less.
I recently spent four weeks in Dublin and can confirm what you said in the beginning. Now I'm sure that there are similar drinking cultures in other countries like my own. What struck me the most was, that most of the Irish people went with the stereotype and presented themselves and their culture as everyhing was about the alcohol. I felt like there was nothing else to do in Dublin than going to the pub - in the middle of the day!
I'm 16 and German and I don't drink and never even did. But there's some kind of pressure to also start drinking. I don't have any friends because they literally only meet to have some kind of drink/fun. This also kinda shows that my generations or teenagers are bored and don't know what to do with each other. But because I'm not interested in drinking/smoking etc I'm alone. I've lost some good friends because of this their hobby
Awn you're so pretty in this Mel
The Czech Republic has probably higher alcohol consumption than Ireland, but I think that's also because of beer and pub tourism especially from English-speaking countries that exists here. \nHowever, binge drinking is not such a big issue because people would drink a beer or two with friends on any week day and not only at weekends, so they don't feel the urge to compensate for the dry week. It's changing, tho, and more and more people only go out at weekends and then drink a lot.\nI think beer and pubs is really a part of our culture and it would be pointless to try to eradicate it, but there should be more awareness about how easy it is for some people to become addicted. You mentioned drinking alone at home and that's just one of the red flags that people should watch out for.
I’m 17 and I have been to few party’s and I love going out with my friends and getting nearly drunk but I don’t think I have ever been fully drunk because I know how dangerous it is and I don’t want to be the burden on friends. I’m the one that will be going around with water I went to a party at a weekend for my friends 18 and her whole family and her got drunk and I was meant to be staying there but got a friend to take me home because it wasn’t safe. I think there’s a level with alcohol that once you cross it you have ruined yours and other people night and put your self danger and I like to get near it but never cross it
Can you do a video about weed or drugs in general?
I rarely ever drink and don't really enjoy getting drunk at all. I personally enjoy the buzz you get and the relaxed state alcohol can put you in but I always like to be in complete control of what I'm doing etc, so I rarely ever get drunk. I started university just a month ago and some of the things I've seen have genuinely shocked me. If you like the taste of it and can limit yourself that's not a problem! There is definitely a very unhealthy attitude towards alcohol in the UK, especially among students, but I'm lucky in that I'm surrounded by lots of positive influences and people who never pressure me to drink!
In America it's really about who you are friends with. I'm friends with people where if you have one glass of wine at a get together you are the odd one out but my cousins have friends where if you didn't have one or two glasses of wine you are the odd one out. And then there are people where if you didn't get plastered you are the odd one out.
Scotland has basically the same drinking culture. I don’t know if it’s the Irish culture which is very imbedded in Scottish culture due To when the Irish came over from the seventeen hundreds to the present day. I’m definitely not saying this is the Irish’s fault it’s our fault because we know our own statistics and we aren’t stopping it. But I have Irish friends and Scottish friends,teenage boys and girls underage and their all getting so drunk every weekend and it’s bad. X
Thanks for talking about this. I'm 22, Irish and in my first year of college. It is strange how many people I can think of that are alcoholics or how many have issues with alcohol. I've a feeling we all go through trouble patches with alcohol since, as you say, it heightens whatever you're feeling at the time and nobody's happy 100% of the time.\n\nFor myself, I don't drink atm for health reasons. I didn't drink anything until 6th year after I'd been 18 awhile and even then only ever one or two. Nobody in my family drinks, same with family friends. They had all seen and tlld stories of how drink had changed people for the worst and you never know if you could have a taste for it. In saying that we'll have a Bailey's come Christmas. Life is a bit strange here not drinking - across weddings, debs, birthdays, funerals... In the end I just found it easier to have one and nurse it for the night instead of having people chat to me about why I'm just drinking a coke.\n\nI met the two of ye in Schuh a few months ago. I was pretty stunned and not in a very good place at the time. The two of you were so nice even though you were rushing. Just wanted to thank the two of you for your kindness and for your solid content time and time again. \n\nHope all well after the hurricane! X
Ok ok Mel & jess Tbh, I grew up in the 🍀Irish catholic church🍀 over here in the states and there was alcohol at a lot of the church functions 😁😂😁🍺🍷\n\nBut I have a sporadic and social relationship with alcohol cause I have such a seriously low tolerance. I wouldn’t say I need an alcoholic beverage everyday but most weekends I defo enjoy a couple pints with friends 😁👍🏽\n\nGood vid ma girls, loves ya 😁😍😉
England is the same to be honest. I’m 17 but there are a lot of places that will sell to me and the first time I got drunk was at 14. I don’t have an alcohol problem I just drink at parties and occasions which I think is healthy
I just realized I love Irish girls!
Came from Dom aka the womb  raIDER
I saw a docummentary on Netflix called The truth about alcohol where they said the more muscle you have the higher your tolerance will be so you will need to drink more to get drunk.
I'm currently sober, been so for 4 months! Quit drinking, smoking cigarettes, weed, and doing other drugs since I wanted to become a better person I guess. It's going good, I like it! I started drinking when I was like 14 or something, it seemed so cool! I used to get really drunk, so drunk I passed out, and I enjoyed it. Now I'm 20 year old, I want to live my life to the fullest and I believe I do so (currently) by being sober. I used to always be looking forward to the next party, now I enjoy them but it's not the reason I'm alive if you get me. I sit there with a cup of tea or some water instead  ^-^
Thank you so much for this video Melanie! Absolutely amazing ! The drinking culture in Norway is the same way... a lot of pressure to drink in many situations
Last time I got drunk was about a week ago, maybe a little more, I drank so much vodka and whisky that I got alcohol poisoning. I'm such a small person, and once I have a bottle I don't know how to stop. usually. this time I didn't stop and even though people took the last bit I had left, it was too late and I had an awful time and I harmed my body in ways that I don't think anyone should ever expose  themselves to. im not saying drinking is awful , but if you are like me and you do not know how to stop then there is a problem. I don't think I'm an alcoholic but I did have the time to self access and realize I was drinking for very very wrong reasons. I can't say if there are right reasons to drink but I know of people who enjoy it and who can control it and that has to say something about the habit.
I'm Irish... I've grown up with an alcoholic father and put off drinking until my 18th birthday (when I had some West Coast Cooler). I was always afraid of becoming like him so I don't push my limits. I can get a little bit tipsy and then stop, that I'm having a good time but it never gets messy (and no hangovers either). It's only since my younger siblings have grown up that we've been more exposed to his alcoholism and the resulting stigma from the problems he attracts to our house. It's pretty shit! On a different note, I've watched my bf's younger brothers start drinking and secretly drinking since they were 13/14. What is the country coming to?
I watch your videos only because of Irish accent. P.S. your sister doesn't look like a teenage
I don't drink like I've only ever had sips of other people's drinks in my life, I'm going to University soon and I'm scared about how people will treat me
As someone who doesn't drink, has never drank, and doesn't plan on ever drinking(I'm 17, so that might change, but as of now, I don't plan on it), I found this so interesting to watch. My mother and my grandmother were pioneers, and have never drank, and my father is french, so he grew up surrounded by the idea that alcohol is a kind of delicacy. My dad drank from the age of 14, but he never binged on drink/ It was always a glass of wine at the dinner table with my granddad. He often comments on how dangerous the drinking culture is here in Ireland. How, when you turn eighteen, the biggest thing you think of is 'Yes! I can drink now!'. I'm very lucky because I haven't grown up in an environment where drinking is seen as an essential or as something that is part of life, because it doesn't have to be either of those things. Thanks for your insight, I really enjoyed this!!
I live in Australia in a small town just out of Melbourne, I'm 14 and I've never had a drink. A lot people will probably look at that and be like oh thats good and normal. But I can tell you so many people I say that to literally look at me like I'm an alien, where I am it isn't strange for an 11 year old to be drinking, the legal age here is 18 as well and for good reason lol. \nAnyway but when I was twelve I knew kids were dropping out of school because they were drunks and addicts and I mean that was just normal. The adults around me even often try to pressure me into drinking but I just I can't, I think I've seen what its done to those around me and it makes me so bloody anxious, just the thought of drinking gives me so much anxiety its dreadful.
I am from the Netherlands, 21yo. I started drinking at 14.. back then the legal drinking age was 16 (since then it has gone up to 18). I used to binge drink at every party I went to and sometimes we would go into a park at night to drink, so our parents couldn't find out, so not a very safe environment.. I don't think I've ever had a problem with drinking, besides feeling peer pressured into drinking loads at parties. I think when you get frown upon when you don't drink, that is when social drinking stops being fun. I am currently trying to stay sober till christmas, I havent craved any alcohol whataoever and I couldnt care less, but with social gatherings it can get quite hard. Wondering if people can relate?
It's probably hard to believe, but I'm 27 y.o. Russian (lol, stereotypes) who never tried any alcohol and not going to. I was just never interested and I believe it causes more harm than benefits you.
I never had a drinking problem and the only few times I ever got tipsy was when I just wanted to see what it felt like or because I felt pressured to drink because of other people. But when I get tipsy I always get pretty down and tired. In Germany you can legally drink with 16 and you are able to buy stronger liquor with 18. But I have seen and heard of 12-13 year old kids drinking and I personally got tipsy for the first time with 14. I never thought of drinking in relation to culture, but since we have the Oktoberfest it probably seems to be rooted in our culture.
If I go out with the intent on drinking, I'll go for beer most of the time. I do enjoy vodka and rum too. Not together obviously lol. I have never been drunk in my life. My brother has a dependency on alcohol so after growing up seeing what being drunk did to him, it made me realize I never wanted to feel or be like that. We've tried several different ways to help him. None have worked. Guess you can't help someone if they don't wanna be helped.
First id like to say I love your videos! Im 22 and live in the US. I usually drink maybe one shot of chilled cinnamon whiskey or gold schlager a year maybe...usually around my birthday. My parents always were very open with alcohol around my sister and I. We learned about it early on and how to to be responsible while drinking. I tend to not drink though because when I have drank before my negative emotions came out worse. For example if I was sad the sadness just became more apparent after a little bit of alcohol.
Thanks so much for sharing your experiences! It was really interesting to me, as a teenager who gets a lot of these talks from school and has friends who I know are partying and drinking a lot.\n\nI'm 17 living in California. I'm from a family that discourages drinking, plus my mother and older sisters hate the taste of alcohol. Because of this, I've always been the goody-2-shoes who never drinks. I've mostly been okay with that, until now. I don't always want to be afraid of drinking and never try drinking at all because I'm afraid to get too drunk or binge drink or something. I think I have a healthy relationship with alcohol because I'm so aware of all of this stuff, and I have supportive people in my life. Also, I would never hide my alcohol usage. I would tell my parents, even if they weren't happy with it, and I think that's what matters. So now I want to allow myself to be free and have drinks with friends because I trust myself and the people around me to be aware of how I'm using alcohol and keep it safe and healthy.
I'm not a big drinker really and not bothered about the taste, but if I don't choose alcohol people sometimes get uncomfortable as if I'm therefore judging them.\n\nUK is the exact same. UK and Ireland are the binge drinking capitals of Europe I'm sure. I started drinking at 17.5 and that was LATE. My siblings have all started at about 14.
The one on the left = ♨️
How much is a pint of beer in Ireland? Just out of curiosity because yous mention it's so expensive
This is amazing. Thank you so much for talking about this!!! Also, all I want is to be your friends!!!!
I'm currently in college and drinks are as cheap as €3 for a double vodka!
what do you think of changing he legal age to 16? do you think it would benefit irish teens in a way that they would be safer with it or do you think it would have the opposite effect?
Hi to both of you,\n\nI personally think that the reason countries in the northern hemisphere particularly in Europe drink more because going back a few hundreds years, I believe that we would drink to keep ourselves warm and with English pub history, men would go to work all day (wives at home), then go to the local public house to relax before going home for tea. It's how it was in those days.\n\nFrom my own experience of drinking in England and in a hot country, I could drink the same amount or more but feel in control of myself in a warm country whereas in England, I'd feel ready for home. I think this links between the different environments, haven't quite sussed out the reasoning behind it but there is my theory. \n\nHope this makes sense...\n\nHazel
I think Germany is almost the same (but I also think I don't even have to say that because Germany is pretty popular for their beer and the Oktoberfest and stuff haha) with the drinking, its starts at a really young age, you are allowed beer and wine at the age of 16 and harder drinks at 18 but to be honest loads and loads of young people already drink with 14 (one girl had to get picked up from a halloween party in school when we were like 13 because she had alcohol poisoning!) So yeah, it is pretty bad over here as well but I have to say I grew up in a small village and was never really interested, I never really went clubbing before (I am 19) because I feel uncomfortable around a bunch of strangers being drunk. The only thing I really enjoyed was back when I lived  in Ireland when you go out with a few friends and drink a few drinks, I tend to get sick quite easily but if I drink I LOVE baileys or cider (one of them is called orchard right) ! But else I don't really drink, even when it is very common here in Germany and a huge social thing, if you go out on a weekend you get massively drunk and tell your friends the monday after how fun it was to be that drink (or at least all my classmates do haha)
I'm from the north of England and I feel like the drinking culture here in the UK is pretty much the same as what you've described in Ireland. It here is also a part of the culture, it's a lot more rare to find people who don't drink in my opinion. :p
I'm of Irish heritage in the US (I'm a McD.). I remember as a kid seeing the stereotype of the drunk Irishman and how stupid he was. I went the opposite way. I only have drinks on my birthday (usually 2 margaritas) and none the rest of the year. It's actually really easy to do if you have the right friends. Great video, Melanie and Jessie!
I’m from Australia and there is a huge drinking culture down here. If you are aged between 15-25 and don’t centre your weekends around binge drinking “you aren’t having fun”. It’s even more prevalent in 18-25,  especially at uni. I don’t like who I turn into when I drink so I stopped at 22. Have felt so much better since.
my biological dad was an alcoholic and even though I havent lived with him since I was 2 I think it's still ingrained in my memory somehow. Ive never been one to drink, Ive gotten tipsy once (I was about 19 at the time). However I can't drink a lot as Ive got epilepsy and drinking too much can trigger them. there is not a lot of drinks I like/will drink but I have started to have a drink now and again, mainly if I go out for a meal or if we have a special occasion, so I feel I have quite a healthy relationship to alcohol in comparison to the majority of people my age (I'm 23)
Us in Scotland have a massive drink  problem too. I am the same as Jess. I drank most at 17 to 18. Now 22 I rarely drink. Drunk stories are funny and scary but it's good to get it out of your system so then you can respect alcohol :).
Im from the uk where binge drinking is also a pretty big problem. I like to drink mainly socially but i know i also have a bad relationship with it where i'll drink on my own in my room because im depressed. So it fluctuates
Le me say this.. I enjoy watching beautiful creatures talking non-stop
I don't drink it makes me so sick straight away not tipsy just so poorly! So just don't bother but I would like to be able to enjoy a few! I think I got out of lots of drink between 16-20 from the sickness the morning after too I would throw up all day long! Xxx
This video came in the right time
I rarely drink now but when I was much younger (14-17) I would drink so much and I think that's why now I just would rather not get drunk. Sometimes I do but as I started drinking so young it's completely put me off 👌🏼
I actually basically don't drink much at all,  when I was younger sure there was a drinking culture when was a teenager in the 80's so its been in OZ for a very long time, I stopped most of my drinking when I had my Kids and Believe it or not lost the taste for alcohol.  I am also a Muso so drinking is pretty standard in my world, however i choose not to drink and don't care what anyone else think.  I also think our drink driving laws in QLD have made a difference to some people as well,  as far as their drinking habits, more people drink before they go out now.   alcohol is expensive and I rather spend my money on other stuff.
Jess your makeup is beautiful. Brings out your natural beauty
i rarely drink but when i do it's small amounts with family around the holidays
I'm 15 in the suburbs near chicago in the U.S. I have never drank. my friends don't want to, and neither do I. some people at my school do have drinking parties and shit like that. It just depends on who you are and who you're friends with. There's 2,600 students at my school, so it makes sense why our culture is so varied.
I only drink to savor the flavors. I've never got drunk before. I love nicely brewed beer, tasty wine.... One of my favorites is umeshu (Japanese plum wine).
We definitely have issues with alcoholism here in America. think part of it is the up bringing. Here in the states you can't drink until you're 21 (legally) so most people do a lot of binge drinking when they're young because they aren't 'taught' to drink they're sneaking it. Then another part is maybe the attitude of work and play... Americans are still pretty concerned with 'the American dream most working crazy long stressful days. So to unwind they maybe have a few at the end of the day. So now you drink to relax and have fun. Happy? Drink. Sad? Drink. It's Tuesday? Bottoms up.
The Portuguese have a very similar culture of drinking. The stereotypes are old drunk farmers.\nIn Canada though, the legal age is 19 and places are STRICT about this. \nMy first drink was when I was 14 and from then on I would drink and get plastered at parties occasionally.\nI grew up in a house where my dad was an alcoholic and because of that, I don't have a very good relationship with alcohol. My mom has been afraid I'll be more inclined to that behaviour. I have a low tolerance and I try to stay away from alcohol when I'm sad or lonely because I don't want to indulge those feelings with something that can really harm me. My friends binge drink a lot and I actually had a discussion with a few of them and it's scary. \nWhat were you parents like about you both drinking?
Why do you drink in the first place if you believe it harms you?
I am from Spain. We start drinking early, my first drink was when I was 13. I have drank a lot in my life, I am 30 now, but this year I have started to quit. I would have maybe two or three beers when I go out but that's it. I can't deal with the shame, the anxiety and the hungover anymore. But the pressure even from friends is huge.
I started drinking just before I was 16 and that was 100% my choice. Like a lot of people have said in Australia we have such a similar situation with alcohol where there are 15 year olds getting drunk and tbh it’s not right in a way but it all comes down to the person, if they want to get drunk at 15 they can have that choice to do it
Not even on my 21st birthday did I drink. I've never had alcohol and don't really plan to. I'm just not interested. What bothers me is how people react when you simply don't drink. Its like people need a reason as to why you don't. I remember going to a bonfire when I was 18 with my new college classmates. One of the girls I was hanging out with asked me if I wanted a drink. I told her no, I didnt drink. When she asked why, I told her, My uncle had liver failure when I was 15. It put me off alcohol. She said she respected that but proceeded to go on about how she thought people that don't drink for no reason are f***ing losers. My uncle did have liver failure but I hate that I feel compelled to use that to get people to leave me alone about alcohol. Alcohol is a personal choice. Drink if you want to, don't drink if you don't want to. Lets respect everyone's choice :) love this series. Love you Mel. Love you Jess 💚💚💚
I'm from Germany and I started drinking and binge drinking with 14. I don't know why, I think I just wanted to distract myself from my problems. I am 16 now and I actually don't drink that much anymore but I still can't control myself when it comes to drugs. I wish people would talk more openly about drug abuse instead of romanticizing it
I just saw this vid and its funny because i have been hanging all day because last night I went to a party and normally im not that bad drunk but i was sloppy and kissing people i shouldn't have and alcohol is such a depressant for me and raises anxiety so much that i was crying in a car park for over an hour... but i kind of know my limit but all my friends were drinking loads so i did and its so unhealthy :(
Both looks so good in this!! The natural makeup looks so amazing on Jess!😍
I rarely ever drink only on occasions. I like being in control of myself haha I get drunk so easily too 😂😂
Thank you for talking about this, my mom passed away this year due to an alcohol addiction so I've never really had a good relationship with alcohol. I've done all the things you've said; been out binge drinking then not remembering then things I'd done then next day. Moms addiction made me see alcohol in a different light, it went on for over ten years and destroyed her life. It can be so dangerous! I would never tell people not to drink as I still drink every now and then (not currently cos I'm pregnant!) but my eyes are so open to the dangers xoxo
I didn't start drinking until I was 19 due to both my parents having somewhat unhealthy relationships with alcohol as I was growing up, and I think I'm glad I waited. I'm from the US but studied at a uni in the UK for a year and also worked in a pub after and personally enjoyed the binge drinking culture. Not that I think it's positive overall, but for me I knew I didn't like the idea of drinking everyday and letting it become habitual, but having one night every couple of weeks when my friends and I would get kinda messy was actually really cathartic for me (I can be pretty anxious otherwise) and there were only a few times that I ever regretted it. Fortunately I'v never turned to alcohol as an escape, and I can see how those habits plus a heavy drinking culture can be a harmful combo. Now I'm back in the US I very rarely drink. I feel there's much more judgement around it here, like people are quick to hand you a beer but also quick to tell you that you're too drunk and should be ashamed a few hours later (not so much from personal experience as observations of others). Plus you have to drive everywhere, and I'm small enough that even one strong drink could put me over, which really limits options for social drinking.
Where is Jessie's top from? It is absolutely adorable !💛
1) U BOTH LOOK HOT\n2) NO REALLY SO HOT\n3) THIS IS IMPORTANT
Melanie, your hair is the epitome of Autumn. I love it!
i come from a family of alcoholics and can honestly say that this is so important and an excellent video- thank you guys for being honest about the effects alcohol dependence can have and these issues!
I'm an Irish 22 year old and I've never had a drop of alcohol and I don't plan to. I hate it when I meet people on a night out and they ask what I'm drinking and I say a coke or something they automatically assume that either A) I'm pregnant (which I'm not) or B) that I used to have a drinking problem (which I haven't). When I tell them that I've never had alcohol they all go Fair play to ya or they look at me like I've got ten heads! Last year I was out with my older brother and his friends at his birthday party in a pub/nightclub in Dublin and when I told when of his friends that I don't drink he literally started to question me for the next 45 MINUTES! He was in shock that I never had some cider down the park when I was younger. Also, as a student living away from home for the first time in a different city, I find that I'm not invited out with my friends from college because they automatically assume that I don't like pubs or clubbing. I'm half Irish, half English I LOVE going down to the pub and having the laugh with my friends! Just because I don't drink doesn't mean that I don't like going out with friends on a night out. I find it really sad that we have such a big alcohol problem in Ireland and no, neither of my parents are alcoholics. The reason why I choose not to drink is A) It's WAAAY to expensive! I'm a broke ass college student! B) I don't need it to have fun. Also I'd like to say that no, I don't shame my friends for drinking or anything like that. If they want to drink, let them drink! Rant over.
When I was younger I thought the German drinking culture was bad...then I spend some time at a British Uni and now I think differently. I know people who sometimes get quite drunk, but not too many. I rarely drink. When I do it is usually a drink or two at a bar with friends, very rarely I get a bit tipsy before going out. I like the taste of some alcoholic beverages, especially cocktails, but I also get a bit sick of the taste quite quickly, so drinking a lot wouldn't be easy for me anyway. I also never felt the need to. Most of my good friends don't drink that much and even if I am at a party where people are drinking, I just stop when I feel like I don't want to drink anymore. It is sad that you then sometimes have to justify yourself for not drinking. I also find it shocking when I hear people as young as 18 say that it would be a challenge for them to abstain from drinking for a month. I really have nothing against a bit of social drinking, but I find it disconcerting how something as harmful as alcohol plays such a big role in society.
I live in portugal (which is in the top 20 countries with the most alcohol consumption; legal drinking age - 18)  and I am 16. I can't even count how many times I've gotten  like really fucking drunk. Around my circles of friends it's pretty normal. I've bought alcohol as a 15 year old. It is not allowed but I did it in a self-service place and loads of more local/small shops sell you if you don't look too young, without carding ya. My father incourages me to drink (not the way I do), but since I was little he'd let me drink from his glass. I don't think that had to do with how I came to drink more heavily but idk just thought i'd share that. It´s not just drinking, I don't think I've gone to a party where there wasn't any weed and some other shit. Everytime we're going out it's always with the minset of like let's get fucked. BUT besides that I don't really drink by myself, I don't really feel the need to. And I've never got drunk to solve any problems, it's always been in good fun, I guess. Plus I somehow have never gotten a bad hangover and haven't had any too bad experiences with it, so it has never been a problem for me. the worst that's happened was not enjoying the party cause I was passed out. \n(We mostly drink vodka but anything will do really, also alcohol is really cheap  €6 for a bottle of vodka black for example.)
love these
Text me 💋 mistress text me girl.
In England it's also terrible!! I am 17 now and my friends at my school and even myself started heavily and I mean heavily drinking at 13, every single weekend. I know I'm my self have become very dependent on my self with alcohol, I don't wanna go out at all without it or did when growing up. It does take a massive hold on your life and I wish I wasn't addicted as I am now , but I don't fucking love it at the same time .
omg you both look so stunning, im so incredibly gay...
😍😍😍
That place looks gorgeous!
#shoitsmash.
Omg that Gucci bag!!! Love your vlogs!
I love how excited you sound about our little island!! Santorini is very unique but if you enjoyed it you should definetly come back to see other places. Kyklades have many to offer but they are in a way all the same, so I would suggest to visit Agistri, Spetses, Corfu or Samothraki. I hope you didn't have any unpleasant experience, because Greek businessman in islands usally overcharge foreign tourists. Btw Aslan mispronounced Oia but he did it in a very cute way 😛 Anywayy love you and you both looked beautiful in your matching outfits and your sunsetie light ❤
aw fab video!! 😌
absolutely looooove your dress ❤️💜❤️💜
I get what you mean about smells. I am Albanian and to me south Albania by the Ionian coast has a such a beautiful smell. Woodsy and sweet. Its from a plant that grows on the mountains, don't know what it is in English.
In this video, Estee=perma-grin☺

Love how you pronounce Greek names! It's so cute!
Is Aslan just holding the GoPro? Because it's so steady 😐 I'm all over the place with mine
Hey! What camera is she using?
If I had to pick the best part of the video...well ok..how about all 18 minutes of it?  Yes, sure does seem like paradise.  This is akin to visual utopia.  Well, I'll pick just one highlight.  @13:05 when you were showing off that lovely outfit.  The background, the sun setting behind you.. the colors and everything...beyond breathtaking.  Also doesn't hurt that we have a wonderful couple responsible for putting such a brilliant vlog out there.  BTW..I have watched this more than once.
this is so immersive, I've been to Santorini and the places you've mentioned including a visit to the caldera (Santorini is a volcanic island) and it's so beautiful! the people are very nice too. I love you guys :-))
This is amazing! This video just re-confirmed that I want my honeymoon there!
Made me so happy I have to go now
i really love your vlog, especially with aslan on it! xx
Oh my goodness! The pool! I cried! I adore your dress ❤️️❤️️
You in that flower dress and the background.. So beautiful <3
If you want a parfume that smells like that fresh salty air in Santorini you should try Jo Malone Wood sage & sea salt. It's just the best 😍😍😍😍
Hey Estee, seeing your vlogs for years now. Aslan n u are growing so beautifully!
Feel like I need to book a holiday now
Beautiful hotel, sadly out of our budget 🙁 but thanks for sharing
The audio quality is insane!! Huge thank you!
Ohhhh my goodness. It is my number 1 dream to go to santorini. 😭😍 Sooo lucky.
So lucky!!! Makes me want to drop everything and go somewhere
So beautiful. Thank you for sharing!!!!!
Oh the memories! We went there four and a half years ago on our honeymoon and also stayed in Imorovigli. We were like the fourth to last hotel, you would have walked right by it. Man it’s beautiful. We neeeeed to go back! We did the hike right when we got there and were NOT prepared. We just went out, only brought one bottle of water, and were wearing flip flops. Whoops! We did the sunset in Oia, our hotel, and Thira and it was so amazing. Thus makes me nostalgic... thanks for the video! Shout out from Red Deer, Alberta!
esteem I'm sorry i just need to say that you are a beautiful classy lady:)
Those views are what dreams are made of!
Estee, you should really try the Korres body lotion/ shower gel in Santorini Vine! It's my favourite scent out of the whole brand, which is greek and natural ingredient based! They're amazing!!
You picked the best time go. I will say until September Santorini is packed. Enjoy!
Santorini looks like the most beautiful place 😍 xo
what a beautiful video! this made me really happy <3
16:28 Estée has the most beautiful smile ever!
So happy you two visited my country!!!!
Estee, you are glowing. Love to see you and Aslan having such a wonderful time. Some of my favorite people ever, live it up in Santorini!
was thinking you guys both uploaded the same thing! I like the part 1/2 idea. Did you both edit the vlogs together?
I need to go right now, omg, so beautiful!
googled the hotel in case one day I go to Santorini - a little outta my price range 😳
This video is amazing , you guys are adorable
It looks AMAZING! Firmly on my Greece Trip list for June xx
Oia is pronounced Ia! Have fun in Santorini from a Greek in the UK :)
Honeymoon destination.....check!... No doubt about it Santorini it is!!
Estee,try the Korres Santorini vine line....I'm sure you are gonna love it!!!!First time I tried it ,I swear to God I felt I was there......also, Oia is pronounced Ia(not aia  but ea)....(oi in Greek is called difthongos, and is one of our 5 different Is)💖
I was in Santorini last month! It is so beaufitul place, thats true!! :-)
The fresh air they were talking about reminded me of when I visited Oregon...such clean fresh air!
It is pronounced IA in greek. Weather in Greece is nice till almost Christmas time.\nBut July and August it is very hot.
I went to see how much money it would cost for me and my boyfriend to go to this hotel at the end of august next year. A week for 5.500€. So... That isn't happening. :D :D :D
In the name Oia, the O is silent so you pronounce it as if it was written Ia (capital i not l, lol)!! I am a big fan of your videos! Hope you enjoy your time in our country! Welcome! If you need any tips, feel free to contact me!
Awww, Santorini is my absolute favorite place. Love every piece of it. Have fun. xx Linda
The trail has a lot of wild oregano growing along side.
Why do you all watch these Fucktards!!! Get your own life.
I'm so glad you visited my country and had such a wonderful time. You should visit again and discover the unique beauty of many other islands as well! Lots of kisses!
You are such a cute couple.
The prices for the hotel are absolutely ridiculous!
I really really enjoyed this vlog! Now I want to go there too!!
Please break down your trip to Santorini on your blog! I do want to visit. The hotel room looked extremely claustrophobic though, so not sure I could stay there even though it looks beautiful. 😳
this trip of yours was amazing . One of the best vlogs!!!!!  loved it 😘😍
I love you guys! Couple holiday goals💖
There's a shower gel by Korres called Santorini Vine and it genuinely smells like Greece, I really recommend it! It's amazing.
you guys are so damn perfect together UGH want.
The thumbnail is so so sweet especially you guys rarely kiss in front of the camera!
I can't stop smiling! So gorgeous.
Wow i wanna earn that much money via youtube so i plan this kind of trip as well
So glad you two had a great time in my homeland! Next time you are in Greece go to Chania. Aslan will love the history and you will absolutely love this adorable little town.
Ok, it's time for me to finally go to Greece! I've done a bit of research, since I watched your videos, and the end of September, beginning of October is a great time.
Hey Estee and Aslan! My fiancé and I visited Santorini last spring, watching your vlog made me wanna go back asap! Thinking about maybe getting married there... Who knows!
Glad you had a wonderful time, just amazing views. You just cannot beat beautiful Greece at dusk. Great video
Love all the extra information Aslan provides!!! Thank you

If you loved the air in Santorini, I’d highly recommend going to iceland! You’ll love it, the air is so fresh
Hey random person scrolling through the comments!\nI hope you have a great day! \nFrom a Danish singer who's dream is to hit 10k subs🍀
this video was so calming to watch... dreamy
Stunning place,and an amazing vlog :))
Fat chinky and a flabby girl....fuck off
I remember watching this and Seth receiving some backlash online by people who didn't get the joke. They thought it was awkward and uncalled for but with new light being shed on Weinstein's assault charges, I'm sure some of those same people are jumping on their high horses now like Oh, I knew all along!!!! Smh.
This comment section is fucking disgusting. Can none of you scrotum licking cuntshits not think of ANYTHING to call people than 'faggot' 'nigger' and 'feminist'? Go back to licking Trump's anus.
The people on Hollywood know about all the sex and pedophilia and didn't do shit. Screw them all
Wow ! Lmao . He was like Seriously though 😏
lol seth was dead serious, look at his facial expression, just stone cold dead 😂
Why tfk they all laughted at????? Thats the attitude keeping these kreeps in power.....laugh until its your doughter or wife..
His face at the end. He's disgusted.\nThis man is a fucking genious.
They all knew. Hollywood is full of nothing but hypocrites and dirtbags. And we are the poor mother fuckers making them rich.
this isnt calling out, it is just making a joke....
I wish I could be a successful actress without hollywood. jfc
It's basically going to come down to who hasn't been assaulted by HW
Must be a lot of nervous actresses out there for when  Harvey comes clean on the ones who did put out for a movie role.
And in those 4 years a little more fondling and a few more touchups.
Hey, while he was busying doing that Weinstein was busy sucking up to Bill Clinton & thanking him for teaching him amazing things : https://youtu.be/cTo8nGXz2Yw
*Emma Stone looked like she wanted to laugh at the dig but still had to be careful for her career...* What a vile industry!
Probably why they do not want him hosting again.  I thought he was the best host yet.  Give them peckerheads  hell Seth.
So in everybody's face, creepy feeling about this one.
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
People did say something. Multiple people did. They were paid off, or they weren't believed, or their story just didn't reach enough people to make a difference. Meanwhile people made jokes like this, knowing Weinstein was a creep and adulterer and maybe rumours of his crimes but not having anything concrete enough to convince anyone. Blaming victims for not coming forward is cruel and nonsensical. A lot of them did and it made no difference, and they faced retribution. Blaming Seth MacFarlane is questionable. He joked about rumours. If he'd known any specific detail about any assault it's doubtful he'd be treating it in such a joking manner. Plus, he did publicly speak about the rumours which is what a lot of people didn't.\nThe primary problem here is the behaviour of one terrible man. The secondary problem is how hard it is for the victims should they choose to share their stoties, and how unwilling people are to treat them seriously or even look into them. About that secondary problem, we can all work a little harder on this.
Out of anger? Im 99.9% sure anyone can see his was making a joke and not a bit angry.
*Jesus Christ is the only true God!* \n♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥\n*The one God who rose from the dead and lives forever.*\n*Jesus Christ is the only one qualified to give us eternal life.*\n*also heal their bodies.*
Hollywood is Dead...This was a great foreshadowing of this https://wp.me/p5TGq4-2AdL
Hollywood hypocrites praising their God Harvey: https://youtu.be/YPpoKquOG5Q
Dilion harper had a strange haircut back then
I guess Harvey raped seth McFarlane too, no wonder he loves rape so much he's an expert at it
They all took the job
As a man,I am sickened by other men who think they can violate women and get away with it. Call me a feminist all you want,but I hate to see disrespectful disgusting pigs like Pervstein thinking they can get away with this kind of behavior. Ladies,just please remember that not ALL men are sex crazed lunatics. There are still some honest,respectful guys in this world,who don't view women as nothing more than a piece of meat ☺❤🌹
Its just a JOKE that even if Harvey heard it he'll laugh. its the way friends joke. its the way EVERY Oscars host made against the nominees.  \nEveryone in hollywood knew about Weinstein, and Seth more than others given that Jessica Barth confided in him long ago. And did he call the cops in the years since? No. Did he speak out in a serious non-friendly-joke manner? No. He just settled on a joke that no one cared about until now. What good that joke did since 2013? \nIf religious people or Trump did something wrong, Seth would've marched in the streets in protest. And now that Harvey's been exposed Seth tries to be in the spotlight and take credit for a telling a joke. He's a hypocritical asshole.
everybody fucking knew, but lets attack Ben Affleck. \nIf he is hypocrite so do all of you are.
So you only reveal now, smh
As disgusting as Harvey Weinstein's actions are I'm really confused as to why people care so much when they didn't seem to care this much about Trump. (I'm not saying it's bad that people care about it, it just seems weird considering who is the president.) Could someone please explain to me why one is seen as fine but the other isn't? I'm seriously curious.
😂😂😂😂 this guy is litreally a legend
I don’t think he was even joking here. He looks pissed that people are laughing about how it. He said it to make it sound like a joke but his face says it all.
Can someone fill me in on what the fuck this is? I need context. And it came up in my trending tab
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
it wasn't a joke
CNN was first to get exposed, now it's Hollywood and next will be academia.  The three megaphones of cultural Marxism are slowly and surely being silenced.
hey there im just starting out you tubing and will like to see some support on my channel \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CfnO3bRTCqkwHs3Fv2x1w
I wonder which leading ladies have let Harvey do them ? And are they being quiet because now they feel like ladder climbing whores?
with jews, you lose. Non jews are literally referred to as cattle (goyim). Chief Rabbi of Israel Ovidi Yosef, The only reason to keep non jews alive is because they are donkeys meant to serve the jews. Had a million jews attend his funeral.
Just makes you wonder if an actress got to where they are on their own merits or because they conformed to the Casting Couch!!!   How embarrassing for someone like Ashley Judd to make an ass out of herself calling Trump out for something WAYYYYYY LESS disgusting than what this PIG did to so many women.   Amazing how many twisted women like Meryl Streep continued to praise and bow down to this Nasty Creep, KNOWING his reputation with women and perhaps her own experience with him.
LOLITA EXPRESS. Look it up on YOUTUBE!!! IT'S AWESOME
He makes my skin crawl, i wouldnt be suprised if he's a nonce himself
PLEASE SUB TO more. Inc BEST CHANNEL EVER
I found a cool game in which you can play with your friends, fun and interesting. https://goo.gl/MwBxgx
seth, you fucking legend!!!
0:34 yep I said it
0:27 That guy laughing the loudest was actually Harvey Weinstein himself.
I feel like he meant well but that comment was slightly degrading to women. It's like he implied that they were okay with pretending. But I don't think he meant it that way, it just came out that way
How is this 'calling out Harvey Winstein'? This is more a jab at the women or actresses in general.
Everyone knew and no one had the stones to say anything ? they all laughed about it secretly knowing. Shame
holy Shit!,Seth MacFarlane sounds like Mitch Lucker from Suicide Silence \n\nhe should be the new frontman!,I pictured his talking voice becoming his screaming voice and it sounds FUCKING AWESOME IN MY HEAD!\n\nMitch Lucker 2.0!
And another thing people are given out oh he knew and never done anything about it ,how could he what's he going to say to the cops I believe he's a rapist , the only thing he was able to do was to say it to a large audience he called him out in front of all actors making it none to All  women  ,it was up to the women themselves to report it until then nothing can be done
simply proving the hollywood shock & outrage today is predictably fake. (smh)
Actresses pretending to be attracted to producers is nothing new. This title is misleading. That joke works just as well with any other producer, including Seth, himself.
Yes he made a joke, most people would not have known what he was talking about, why didn't he expose him properly 4 years ago, alot of women would have been saved from his unwanted advances another Hypocrite.
Don't go down there.....the comment section gets pretty brutal.
Everyone already knew and nobody did shit about it. The public will have the same reaction once the child sex rings are finally exposed even though everyone with a brain could already see it.
Seth MacFarlane honestly isn't that funny
Ehh nothing new it's been that way in Hollywood since the 1940s hell almost half of Entourage season 4 episodes address's this issue.
that was just making a joke of the disgusting behavior, not calling him out.  Additionally if you google the ass clown you will find that he explicitly says he did not want to call him out....It is just another case of liberals protecting liberals and shows us how far hollywood and its heros and idols have fallen.
All of them new now pretend to be shoked...son of a bitch
Poor man. Why all come out now. Seems like its fake
You call this a call out, i call it making a joke of something he obviously knew and in the process made his co-host look sick at what he was suggesting.
that face though... https://youtu.be/L1Ki-fun_8U
The look on his face. He fucking meant it.
In the end he’s like “Yea I’m joking but.. come on..”
We've stayed silent until now. We feared. We were threatened. We needed to rebuild our lives. But we can no longer sit back and let the monsters who sexually assaulted women and raped girls to roam free. Please check out famous actress Kate del Castillo movie about her abuse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOX3tjTVgQc
This harvey weinstein is your typical kike sheeny yid piece of shit!  He should be thrown in a concentration camp and be rapped in all holes until he dies from it!
People on here seem surprised that Hollywood is full of hypocrites and fakes.They're actors for crying out loud. They are professional fakes. It has been well known for at least 25 years what that perv was doing. Everyone turned a blind eye until it was made public.Now they all come out and tell us how surprised and disgusted they are. Actors are the most useless people on the planet. Got the shits? Call a doctor. Leaky tap? Call a plumber. Dodgy hair? Call a hair dresser. Persistent boner? Call a hooker. There is no possible scenario that could occur in everyday life which would require you needing an actor. They're fucking useless.
Jews
I keep rewatching this
is seth macfarlen a comedian.
Seth MacFarlane = Dillion Harper
Emma stone is gorgeous
damn
Oh boy
I'll suck Harvey's dick for an oscar
Lol i drink fluoride aswell.
Weinstein is a victim of Jewish Hollywood infighting,he must of upset some powerful members of his Tribe and they are simply settling scores.
Ooooooh
He Knew
That was really funny
They knew Harvey was a perv but nobody dared do anything
Wow
The Chosen People had to much Shekels
Seth knew the audience would laugh at that statement and his reaction to them laughing is to almost laugh but to feel completely disgusted also.
hey that guy sounds like the dog off family guy hohoho
I think I am starting to finally get that Family Guy scene where Peter takes Stewie to Disney World and Stewie gets captured by the “it’s a small world” ride people and made to in there as a slave with the other children from around the world. I had no clue at the time what the scene was about until I saw it again at a friends house here over the weekend. Jeezo, we spoke about it and prayed that we are still just guessing at its meaning, but the scene now seems creepy second time around ....
So Seth McFarlane like most of Hollywood knew this was going on and instead of using his power and influence to do something instead  made a cheep in joke about it at a ceremony. What a fucking hack piece of shit douche bag
I will fight sexual abuse with women every step of the way but women have to do their part as well. First start off by NOT wearing yoga pants 365 days a year everywhere - to hospitals, schools, stores, out and about. The crutch of freedom of expression and comfort has been broken, you cannot tell me you will walk out in public wearing white/grey/tan/green yoga pants with your cameltoe hanging in broad daylight and tell me you are doing it for comfort and NOT for attention. Start respecting yourself before expecting others to respect you. A grown fucking woman should know better!
I'm glad that Seth took a swing at Weinstein and can see in his facial expression the disgust he has for him.
I blame the woman...if she is not a whore.. .. just say fuck off Harvey im not doing your shity movie...simple as that
It's been an open secret for some time now.
U guys should watch open secret documentary...Harvey is harmless compare to these guys
Everybody knows it too.
I love Seth.... Marry me.☺️😍💕
I'll rape dat
DXOmark is a cheat company and the smartphones companies that make Pixel or Iphone are not even ashamed on beating their drums on DXO ratings. Pixel 2 was rated almost even before the product was announced. Yet there is no sign of LG  V30 in DXOMark  , which is one of the most consumer friendly phone in the flagship bracket
I was thinking of getting the pixel 2 xl but have changed my mind. I think the note 8 has the best camera. A long with the v 30 then iPhone 8 plus then a the mate 10. Then pixel 2. I was thinking of getting the mate 10 pro as well but what a let down. Looks like I'll be getting the note 8 after all.
Good solid reporting! I think the problems with DxO procedures go even deeper. Take for example the bokeh test which sets the camera in a fixed distance from the front object and the front object from the background object. Well, that’s useful if every photo you take uses those distances but more than likely NO photo you take will have those exact relationship distances. It would not be a valid conclusion to think DxO’s bokeh test will tell you anything about a photo you make if it has different and likely very different distances. I loved the fact that they have a viewing panel of experts who view “real world” photos and then judge which camera was most accurate. Even 5 experts will disagree about this sort of thing, you only need to look at a camera forum or a high end hifi forum to see how differently people react to the same images. I could go on and on. The attempt to be “scientific” means DxO has to standardise conditions,  temperature, light source colour, locked on a tripod, etc which means if you replicate the situation then you should get repeatable results. But real world shooting means NO conditions are standardised. \nIn fact most high end smartphone cameras can make better photos than the people doing the shooting. It’s false to think anyone can find “the best” camera. Now go download CIPA’s white paper on Image Stabilisation tests for another eye opener of meaningless stats.
fabric anybody  know bigger than thix ooj?
Are you considering doing a Blind Test 2.0 next year maybe?
Very well done! Perhaps using a scoring system that places most phones just below 100 wasn't the best scale to use.
Weight the characteristics is important. For example a food can be delicious, but deadly and another can be just average, but not deadly.
An excellent video n the much needed one.. 👌👍
Nokia 808 Pureview should have been in the 1st place, next is Lumia 1020 and others. DxOmark is just biased in every flagship released.
*Good work dude, these videos is why i subscribed :D* Bold = * Text (Again The Simble)
So good at what you do, Marques.
I hit a like because its informative!
I dont think it's an accident that they are close to 100.
Great fucking video, my favorite so far.
Useful video and understand your points, but why would you choose a samsung phone for portraits because it has a specific secondary camera for that purpose... Google has clearly stated that without the use of a second camera they are able to achieve the same result...? Also machine learning means the more you do something the smarter/better it gets so you take loads and loads of portraits on the pixel, they in theory should get better over time, either way fair enough to your video!
Great video
I just got out of class... lol
This video should have been named The one with Marques destroying DxOmark (mikedrop).
Snarky, but I like it! haha
you nailed it marques!!\njust love the way u present!!
This why I subscribe to this channel! No BS tech videos!!
How about a review of the new Nikon D850 … from the perspective of a video maker?
Saw that.. Poor V30... Poor LG 😞 lol
Bro too much talkin,,,, uv never been so.........
I don't know why but this is one of my favourite MKBHD videos
All this time I chose a smart phone camera based on things I need and performance I liked from that camera. DxO mark ratings or any other ratings will fade if you don't get what you were looking for from the camera. So like you said, grain of salt.\nOr a teaspoon.
My S7 edge in coral blue got 88!!! Woot!  What will my S9 get one day? 100?
Thanks MKBHD. This is really a great info video!
Thanks for informing the rest of us. You made some great points about how the score is weighted based on certain aspects of camera performances that are subjectively emphasized over others. I also didn't know about the partnerships, or that the score wasn't out of 100.
this is the fatest iphone that we've ever made XD
thats why we watch mkbhd instead of paying attention to the press
Your best video ever. You’re smart 😀
Wow, thank you so much for putting this video together and explaining how the scoring works. I thought it was out of 100 as well haha. Now I'm informed!
Thanks for clearing things up
Where should you go for prime tech journalism? MKBHD.
I actually dont know about dxomark until this video. lol
Can you decrease treble in your voice mkbhd
This is your best video. Thank you
Clean and clear explanation. Pretty cool😎
Do explain videos like this more.
You can tell MKBHD is tired of all these scores and finally had to say something. Haha great review guy.
This proves again and again how great a YouTuber you are! Great job as usual MB.
Thanks for the breakdown
It is very nice to have someone to point out that!
Thanks for the clarity around this rating.
Hi everyone l like everything about SMARTPHONE SO I HAVE A GREAT TIME TO INTERNET CONNECTION WITH YOU
I am thinking how much Google gave money to dxo
This video is super crisp and clean even at 240p (on a smartphone)
I have both a note 8 and a Pixel 2 and I completely disagree that the Note takes better portrait shots. The software of Googles camera more than compensates for the lack of second camera
With all the flagship models, most cameras do great and you're right, it is difficult to tell the difference. After all, in real life, nobody is going to sit and compare your travel photos taken with the Google Pixel 2 or the iPhone 8. The best camera is the one we have with us, and more often than not, the most important element of the camera is the one who's pressing the shutter.
Right on. Thank you.
Dope video & and thanks for dropping some knowledge.
I love your show. You deserve all your subs. Well done Sir.
how did Pixel get a weighted average of 99 when none of the individual values are as high as that
I'd get it if it had a headphone jack - _-
Anyone know where that Engadget video is? Can't seem to find it.
Are you going to do a full review of the Lg V30?
My man's video roasted Engadget so bad they removed their video from their channel 😂
Apple better pick up their game and make their designs and customization features better
The only one with the highest score! \nThat makes sense alot of sense...
Yo Marques, whats that bracelet you wear on your hand (the long one, covering your forearm and hand)? Pretty neat
Well benchmark tests are also 1 number so this is pretty much like that. I still use this number to determine if a camera on a phone sux or not
It’s like car brands they want to succeed on the Nurburgring, not on the road .
If I purchase a Cellular Ipad (AT&T)  - will I be able to make and accept phone calls on it through AT&T??
Is the Apple WATCH  LTE WORTH THE EXTRA VERIZON COST?
And it makes sense for it to be a linear thing rather than an out of 100 rating because what if a phone camera from 2011 got a 95 and then in 2017 a phone with a clearly better camera gets a 95 then was there an improvement?
Great insight about DXOMark ratings. Makes me wonder what other ratings these companies are using as a marketing edge.
Consulting for their scoring systems? Clever girl..
Bruh i totally had it with them wack  was phones! Review some more camera's/computers/tech!
This Benchmark isn't the most important
This video is a BIG SLAP to whoever bashing Dxomark ratings (including Google) lol...
Who else went to the DxO website after this?
bujo in the bg. bujo styled dots in the theme 🤔
savage!
MKBHD rants. love it
Their review of the old 808 definitely seems strange. They have the 808 as the lowest rated phone. That's the 41MP camera from 2012.
DxOMark doesn't want to test Fujifilm cameras.
I really wish they'd put small bezels on the pixel 2 just like the pixel 2 xl
where is the galaxy s7/s7 edge? That should be listed
God I love Marques
all the dislikes, I didn't even know Engadget had 1000 employees damn
Dxo is bs i think.
MKBHD mark
MKBHD fighting fake news since 2017
FAKE NEWS. READ THOSE RECEIPTS MARQUES YAS
MKOBEHD
Explained Nicely👍
As Always Best
Engadget deleted their video
Mate 10 pro?
Samsung bokeh :45\nPixel bokeh :45 ☺️
Awesome video 👌
plz review the apple watch 3\ncellur connection
Much appreciated
Great video!
basically u r telling they r fraud withing saying it.
Good vid
well explained !!
Respect!
Good info
Really look forward to something!!!😃✨✨✨
Someone give Adam an Oscar already. The way he expresses his sadness while taking the shot is too good to handle.
Complete misdirection as an answer to all theories out there. Nice to see Disney creating trailers as answers to its fanbase community, really progressive. Really thoughtful and cruel at the same time because this trailer is somehow marvelously created to confirm and disrove at the same time all our predictions so far.
Who keeps coming back to rewatch the trailer because they cannot wait
Wow.  And THAT's how you do a trailer!
Flying is for droids
Spoiler Alert: The last Jedi is neither Rey nor Kylo. Kylo turns Rey to the dark side. It's up to a character long thought dead to return and fill out his duty as the true last Jedi. A man who hid his influence over the force by disguising as a pilot. The only man capable of saving the universe from Rey, Kylo, and Master Snoke... is Porkins.
Hmmm.... I'm a huge Star Wars fan and always have been. This looks like a really cool movie to watch, but as far as Star Wars goes? ... I think it's done. Rogue 1 was awesome due to the nostalgia factor in the chronology, and my second favorite under ESB. But this just seems to be missing something even thought it looks really fun to watch. Maybe they should just let the Star Wars universe be?
Love it so going to watch it
Pls go and watch mersal official teaser it's amazing
I've seen power like this before ha these nibbas think hes talking about anakin.
May 4 is my birthday!!  STAR WARS DAY!! 😍
What if Rey turns to the dark side.... and Kylo turns back to the light side?
Will Star Wars: The last Jedi be the last Star Wars Movie?😏😏😏
I see RAW... UNTAMED POWER always gives me chills
Star Bores is more like it. Shop-worn and weary. Tedious, banal and pointless. 0(
0:01 if you look closely through the window you will see that all that is actually atats and atsts from the empire. Example. See the walking atst. Hmm wonder what this means
At 1:47, Luke seems to be laying on the ground talking to who I assume is Rey.  I  predict that the two of them will have some sort of confrontation.
I really hope we get to see Luke back in a lightsaber duel.  It's been far too long...
I think the main thread here is Sith teaching a Jedai, there must be balance, there can not be dark side without a light side, there can not be shadow without a light.
Beginning at 1:27, the music gets AMAZING!\n\nGive us this movie, Disney. Give it to us NOW! WE NEED IT!!!
Hows this for a theory: Rey eventually turns evil after her meeting with snoke and Kylo ren is reaching his hand out to luke, to return and stop rey.
Rey, they black dude and Luke all die within 10 mins. I worked on the film.
Imagine Anakin coming back as a force ghost to help Luke!
Parents: Oh that's nice, counting down to Christmas?\nMe: No, Star Wars
Let the past die, says the guy who's obsessed with maintaining his grandfather's legacy
Im buying tickets now before the starwars nerds buy them all😂
This isn't a solid theory whatsoever, merely a passing thought; but what if Rey is significantly older than she is portrayed to be? Those etchings inside her home on Jakku are not days, but years. There was an odd moment in TFA where she gazes at an elderly lady, the reason for that inclusion has always puzzled me. She never mentions that she is waiting for her parents, she simply says family, and the boyfriend exchange with Finn is also an notable scene. I wonder if we are supposed to focus on whether she is a plausible daughter of one of the existing characters, when in fact this is misdirection and her parents may date back a great deal further than we think. Again, just a thought, but I'm sure a theory could be built on this somewhat, I was always led to believe Jedi could live longer than non force users....
Oh god I simply cannot wait
I saw the Leia Look Alike
R.I.P Carrie Fisher (Leia) may the force be with you your true fan will always love you!
Luke is scared his daughter will suffer his nephew's fate
Rey is a descendant of palpatine
But is the Sector Clear though?
I may or may not have shat my pants a little at the very end when Rey was talking to Kylo... no no Rey
Don't you just love the hundreds of videos made with the title 10 things you missed in the trailer, and then they photoshop something tiny into any still image from the trailer and use it as a thumbnail. Don't forget to circle the thing with a red circle~!
Looks like a reboot of 'The Empire Strikes Back'.
We all know Snoke is Jar Jar
Its all about people doing stuff they dont like but they survive and then they have to do someting else they dont like
Just saw it once more (100 total) ... I keep on... 😂
Dark rey will be cool
I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE
My takeaway from this is 0:50 Mary Sue Rey 0:40 journeys to Mordor 0:55 to find the Terminator.  =P
Kylo ren’s actor looks like rodrick from the long haul ew
Is that Luke at 1:52? I wonder what's happening there...
This Star Wars game looks real! Does it come with a DLC?
'May the force be with you. '\nPlease click the thumbs up button.
Random quote from trailer that idiots will upvote for some dumb reason.
Rey will turn to the dark side. Very likely
kylo will turn to the light side.
I was not expecting to see Carrie Fisher!! I am crying. She does live on, forever in our hearts.
I love everything! Carrie, the soundtrack, I really hope the movie has depth and emotion Rogue. I find Kylo so sexy. I love his voice
Hey hey is that an ATST in the background at 1:41??
this film is not yet rated \n\nNO WAY !
I can't reveal my identity but I have seven different passports and currently live in an obscure Himalayan cave with nothing but The Complete Works of Shakespeare and a limited supply of Earl Grey Tea.\nEven I had to see this trailer.
I can't wait to see it

NO Jedi or Sith has ever had a WHITE lightsaber.  White is the combination of all colors. When WHITE light is passed through a prism it separates into the colors of the rainbow.
Feminism is cancer
Wait a minute they got someone to play leia since she died in 2016
I hope Harrison Ford's character will return in some compacity
The Emperors scream when Rey ignites her lightsaber has me thinking she is a Palpatine .
OmG💙 Gahan one of the most beautiful voices ever !
What's the matter with all these morons commenting on Dave's demonic side because of the video??!!? Are you f..ing crazy?? 1) Dave has nothing to do with the concept of the video 2) his voice is a gift from God for all of us who have a soul 3) with what he's been through, no one - NO ONE - has any right to comment on his personal life 4) anyway, WHO CARES about moral implications??? Just listen and appreciate the music for what it is. Long Live Dave <3 And thax Kurt!
Best DM song in years!! Ops... :D
Perfecto love this song 🤙🏻👌🏻
Perfect, i love the athmosfere, the darkness, the sound of this song and obviusly my idol Dave <3 great job Kurt

Tageslied. Song Of The Day @guteshoerenistwichtig: https://guteshoerenistwichtig.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/tageslied-null-void-feat-dave-gahan-where-i-wait/
I absolutely love Dave, but he really needs Martin. That's what is lacking here. Not a bad song though.
I like this song, but I must confess that it's different  from what I expected.
Real magic and power!
I think I got the idea of this video: she killed him so that nobody could prevent her from watching Dave and listening to his deep voice :)
Dave is very GOOD...but the music is 😞😩
rifadísima!
Amazing ---------------> Dave !!! <3
DAVE GAHAN is BACK to SHINE :'(
WOW
One of the best songs 2017! The voice is legendary and the music/programming is breathtaking!!!
This is it :) Nice....

I loved them a long time ago but fuck me! As pretentious and as same as an album full of DM songs as you are ever going to find.😴
is it trevor or something
Sounds like real synthy Depeche Mode, but here is very feeble non-catching refrain.
The best song of '17 until now
great  track, that  woman  is  really   Tall..  niice
perfect description and personal evaluation...very successful,both the video,and the lyrics...❤️👑🖤
Dave could sing every song and make it famous and wonderful.. but his best is ONLY with Depeche Mode... from 1981 to 2017...
Oh Dave oH Dave   i 'll be waiting you
Amazing! Dave should be the front. It’s different then Depeche Mode by tons. This is the future
What the sound, what the powerful song was this. It will be becoming more popular  than i think.
Electronic Music brought me here ✨

Perfect 😚.
Love it Dave Gahan  the master voice.
This sounds like a B side from the SOTU record that should've been the first single 😐😧😳SHEEEEEEZE that was good
good
Love Gahan, love the rythm, love the visuals, wow!
YES yes.🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤💕👍👍💕👍👍💖💖💖💖👍💕💕💕💕❤💕❤❤❤
Leck mich am Arsch! Schweinegeil!
Increíble!!!
Great 😁
Sends chills down my spine
Dave's damn sexy voice!!!
INTRYGUJĄCE , \nA ZARAZEM PIĘKNE ...
ME ENCANTA !!
Красота!
Incredible!
New songs​, eletro pop, synth pop.
Beautiful song
The outro is perfect...great !!!
Sweet !
wonderful
Good sound
Fantastic Sounds !
KOOL!
ДЭЙВ РУУУЛИИИТТТ!!!!!
Very nice indeed!
Neo noir atmosphere.
Очень похожа на Precious! Luxury music.
Impresionanteeeee!!!!!!! ♡
Excelente, la voz de Dave exquisita y sensual y la música oscura pero muy fresca. Me encantó más que los singles de spirit
peccato per un video cosi' fuori luogo e truce
This Sound is very deep. \nThe Beat is very dark.  \nSometime we need dark and deep things in our Lifes.  \nBut if you sell yourself into the Darkness, you will never be the same Person anymore. It's your Choise, when you even sell your whole body and soul to the Darkness. Sorry Dave Gahan, but this is not my music and not my World. Satanic, Diobolic, whatever. Not every deep music is so dark like this Song, but l will only listen to the beauty of music itself. You have dissapointed me.
Bellissima la musica è la voce di dave sempre grandiosa e sensuale!! Questo pezzo è  travolgente! Lo adoro dal primo ascolto! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Słucham i słucham całkiem to dobre
LYRICS pleae. I love this song
I WANT THEM TO DO ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE SOUNDS OF THE UNIVERSE..  or another song like fragile tension or in symphony they really need to go back to that sound or speak and spell to bring the 80's sound back at least one song like dreaming of me that was a real good song
worst song of 2017
I LOVE YOU DAISYYYY!!! <3 <3
I love this woman
Look at all that Star Wars money at work
Please do 73Q's with Emma Watson 💕
Daisy is such a beauty <3 She seems like a fun person to hang out with :)
Please, 73 Questions with Emma Watson
I was going to be rude.....But she is cool.
I really want to believe that this wasn't 100% scripted and rehearsed but...
5 british teevee shows Peepshow, Fawlty Towers, The Office, The Young Ones and Coupling
The answer Follow your heart is not helpful. Here's my advice for the random friend: You can't just pick up and leave whenever your so-called heart tells you. You have a job, and you made a commitment to your employer, who expects you to live up to your word. If you go on vacation whenever you please, your boss will realize he or she can't rely on you, and just like that, you're fired. Travel on your own time.
I have never thought of Daisy as foul mouthed XD
I love listening to her voice
I LOST it at the Mom's Upsetti song\nKeeping Up Appearances?!?! NICE she watches the bucket woman XDDDDd
Looks like the start of a porno
Daisy kinda looks like the porn actress character from Californication's first season.....what was her name again? Oh yeah, Daisy :p. (Nothing against porn actresses or Daisy Ridley :p).
*Daisy Ridley trying to act american*\nTea is ready!
She looks so much like Keira Knightley.. especially when speaking!
5:27 I’m just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
This felt more like a pork intro than anything
74: How are you so pretty?
I would love to suck those ti..............nipples.
that sunflower is anything but giant, it is pretty small in fact
THANK GOD she's prefer Hip-Hop than the generic pop rock EDM mellow hits. \nPlease make sure that she listened to Kanye West as well!
who else thinks it's about time that Daisy took on some roles that were a bit more sexually explicit in nature ?
Wow, I think shes cool and all but that japanese was in no way understandable japanese haha
I’m now in love, urgh 🙄😩
73 questions with no star wars questions
I would have the best sex known to human kind with her oml
How did she crack her phone? Lol, I just noticed that after watching this like 10 times.
She had me at the whistle, man I wish I could do that!
I think I’m in love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
I have the same hair cut but how do I style my hair like this? 💞
Looks like one of this pornhub vids
Just saying that if an actor/actress spoils a movie before it comes out they get fired, she didn't actually tell him anything
Jesus she's so beautiful
She reminds me of the lovely Audrey Hepburn
73 questions with Larry David. Please.
Are you a man or a woman?
She´s so beautifull.  Natural, not like the sluts these days.
So giroud has succeeded in attracting all top ladies towards Arsenal! Lets applaud for his only achievement!
This is by far the best video on Vogue. It was a free flowing, very well prepared interview.
Damn right it's football
she s amazing she will become better than jennifer lawrence and most of the actress of the moment
it'd be soo dope if there's a 73 questions with Millie Bobby Brown!
She had me until Arsenal......... COYS!\n\n...... Let's be honest, she still has me though.
Typical English rose. Atypical English rose.
Fake.
DAISY IS AMAZING, I AM IN LOVE
Plz 73 questions with the rock
That lady on the phone just lost her job
I'VE FINALLY FOUND ANOTHER PERSON WHO LIKES MARMITE YESSSSS
I SWEAR TO GOD LOSE YOURSELF IS ALSO THE SONG I KNOW ALL THE LYRICS TO AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT BEFORE SHE STARTED SINGING. SWEEEEAAARRRR TO GOD.
She is so pretty.......im crying
Love/ Hate relationship with watching these because we love them too much!
I really hate when she got bleeped out in the end OMFG!!!
She is completely boobless. Couldn't even see a hint of a bump coming from under that dress :(
i’m in love with her until she said she supported arsenal
Anyone knows any pornstar that looks like Daisy Ridley? A fap session is due......
Wow, look at this view 'focuses on daisy'
73 questions with Logic!!
Man she hot lol
As a Welshman I'm always strangely subservient to an English rose as beautiful as her
Having her as a wife would be mission complete marked on my life
He should've jumped off that balcony!
I'm in love. She's perfect. When she corrected him (*football), I was blown away.
Honestly, I began watching this thinking it would represent the stars in a realistic way...but this is SOOOO fake it makes me cringe.\nIt's so obviously scripted, it just comes out as artificial.\n\nSorry, maybe I didn't know what I was getting into, but I won't be watching more of these, thanks.
Star Wars: The Last Porno
How the fuck did I know the song would be Lose Yourself before she sang it? Maybe because it's also the only song I'll always know from start to finish, but shit that was creepy and cute at the same time
The format of these videos is cringeworthy in the extreme, the most faux staged unnatural interviews you will ever come across. Just horrendously American.
When he asked what movie made her laugh the hardest, I instantly thought in my mind Spy!
Who is Daisy Ridley would be the first question
73 Questions with...\n-Margot Robbie\n-Natalie Portman\n-Keira Knightley\n-Amanda Seyfried\n-Cara Delevingne\n-Adriana Lima\n\n....please? :)
She’s adorable

Bleeps everything but the f-bomb

Daisy Ridley 2020
MARY SUEEEEEEEEEEEEE FUCK OFF CUUUUNT

Okay she's hot, beautifull, fucking strong what else? I'm in love
She was cute until she started belching out Little Marshalls foolishness.
anyone else get a porn vibe
73 questions with Millie Bobby brown
The girl on the phone was Sophie Turner who play's Sansa Stark on Game of Thrones.
Damn that non-existent breast
Spoiler alert
It look-a- like-a man.
Why people are saying shes super beautifull?look at her body she has manly body look at her shoulders and back muscle lol
Who is the most nervous Natalie Portman Keira Knightley Or Daisy Ridley??
The plot to the film is coded into this video.
ERROR 404 \nBOOBS NOT FOUND
Feels like its trying not to be rehearsed but it is so its unauthentic.
Yay, Ryan's Cooking Show! 10/10!!
omg Ryan's Cooking Show pls make this a thing!! with cheesy music and everything!
ryan's so funny :D
I am REALLY impressed by that transition at 5:07 Grace, well done!\n(I genuinely love you guys' creativity and content in general, but this one just really stood out to me...)
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Big spider??  It's so spindly!  Just a cellar spider; totally harmless.
I see Ryan likes spices, garlic and basil. An handsome englishman who likes mediterrean ingredients?\nActually that nice pasta is some kind of Amatriciana, rather than Carbonara. They both have bacon inside but they are totally different; i adore them both anyway.
I think He is good at cooking. Great
Good day to you madam
Mmm, I want Ryan's cooking
Love you guys! Xx❤️\n\n\n\n\nAnd your vlogs! Xx❤️
Ur vlogs r so cool
4:00-4:08 vibes 😂 same
Fumbs up!
Wow!\nHow old is the building?\nLooks quite old.  Lots of work.
Yay, food! but what is 5:23?

Without Eriksen Tottenham are nothing trust me. Any striker who plays week in week out will score plenty of goals for that team, maybe not as much as Kane but Eriksen just runs the game.
One can understand why, the players like him.. He is a very normal and clever guy on football..
Keep ArseAnal under keep Wenkar IN!
I love u please get more tottenham vids out!

Lyrics video of this song https://youtu.be/m5acyjrZ1M0
Honestly, the melody is not very impressive.  It's better than 6,  but his July is still the best.
T A L E N T
It's funny because when he left EXO almost everyone was saying sht like How dare you. You aint nothing without EXO. And when the other two chinese left EXO the thing became Kris gonna be the worst among them as a soloist. \n\nNOW SAY IT AGAIN MOTHERFCKERS. LOOK WHO'S KILLING IT.
kris im so proud of u bby
god, i love yifan but part of me hopes he doesnt change his natural self, smoking joints surrounded by barely dressed girls was never his image. Love this song tho, \n\n\n~

1:41 Who’s that handsome devil?
Kylo Ren you are the second character to break Star Wars tradition.  Don't say the actual title in a sentence in your own dimensional universe.  😂You only use the title at the introductory of each story without actually saying it unless it's an audiobook.  After that keep it %101 anonymous while the stories are being told.😅
1:42What the hell man relax!😂😂😂😂
When I first saw the force awakens, I hated kylo. Now due to you guys he's my favourite character!
Yes I love these
*THERE WILL BE NO TRUCE* more  evil laughter *WHOA TICKETS AVAILABLE NOW?*
Tyrion kills his father????? WTF KYLO THANKS FOR THE SPOILER
I mean you say it's 100% certified raw...but is it organic too?
What's christmas? Lost it. XD
this is my new favorite thing on the internet
I thought Kylo would be a Reylo shipper. In the ground not in my bed?
These are the greatest videos ever 👍
Hey a good idea for the future would be to do a 10 things that would make star wars better like you did with the hobbit
Star Raws:  The Last Jedi
I can't wait for Kylo to see Blade Runner 2049 and go you're still alive!?
Please let *_RAW_* turn into a meme
I'm more excited for the new Jedi Party than the actual movie
This is a good gimmick you have here. Might as well have Kylo Ren reactions to various trailers and commercials; including outside of the Star Wars franchise...if you can let us vote or decide in the comments sections then you can draw real hype to this channel.
I really  enjoy  the Kylo  Ren, I  would  to  see  how  the Hitler reaction  to the Last Jedi  is going  to be  like.
THIS STEAK IS SO RAW, SUPREME LEADER SNOKE WANTS TO TRAIN IT TO USE THE FORCE!
3:00 Thumbs up to all the pervs who saw this little bit of humor. Apparently our boy Kylo likes some Suicide Girls action.
How about in the ground? Lol 😂 (extends hand) what!?? Hahaha
The Auralnauts are 100%  Absolutely Positively Without a Doubt Certified Midichlorified Gugu Mbantha-RAW!\nWhat's Christmas? Lol\nAlso, is that Baby Time playing in the credits?
This shit is so fucking good holy fuck! CLASSIC!!! THUMBS UP!!
The only react videos that matter are from Kylo.
These vids never cease to get a giggle from me lol 😂
I'm so raw!!!
This reaction is raw
This video was so RAW
I hope he still reacts to stuff unrelated to Star Wars after Star Wars is over.
It's baby time
The Suicide Girls at the end....so raw!
That was so Awesome and funny.  I liked how he said this was in the future.  My favorite was when it first switch to Rey.
I'm really disappointed that weenie doesn't seem to be in his helmet for most of the movie.
“I need someone to show me my place in all of this...”\n\n“How bout in the ground?”\n\nLost it.
lol!!! i love how he shouts out Whaaat?!!! and that laugh
2:44 ''How about in the ground'' LMAO
I heard lady Gaga really liked this trailer. In fact, she said it was raw raw raw raw  rawwwww.
Gordan Ramsey is super pissed at how raw this trailer is.
I need someone to show me my place...\n*points to the kitchen*
I'm glad you like it Kylo
You should make videos of Kylo watching other trailers other than Star Wars. 👍🏽

“What’s Christmas?”
WHATS UP EVERYONE ITS YOUR BOI KYLO

I like your new avatar
My future job is to become part of the Animation Squad. I'm 13, and I'm currently Working with my dad. In law, it ISNT my job, but I treat it as one. I work at a pet grooming store, and its really fun to bathe other people's dogs and cats. (Mostly dogs because cats dont like baths and they scratch hard as a KNIFE!!!) I basically started doing comics on Snapchat, and people find it amazing! So once I get a drawing tablet, I'm gonna start animating! (Hopefully)

I literally cried. ❤️
this is beautiful an has so much meaning to it
Why am i here
Is it wrong that as soon as I saw VEVO in the thumbnail I thought it was another diss track?
This little faggot needs to be raped
i thought it will be communism song by the title
So is so stupid and boring from a kid
i hate fukin country its like IM A COWBOY
it’s good but too much like eminem
I was hoping this would be that one song from All Dogs Go To Heaven...
What kinda gay ass shit is this kane, common bro.
That smile. That blink of your eyes that made me change my ways. You freed this man from all his rusted chains and changed everything I ever knew. You blew away all the walls I  could ever place before your feet. You took this heart I buried 6ft deep from all to see and made it believe it's fine to be alive and thrive in the light of the day that you gave me. You saved me, and for that what's mine is yours...
Made me cry😭 Not sure if I'm crying coz they super cute and so happy or coz I'm a bit jealous.\nIf anyone tries to break them up they'll have to deal with me❤❤ they so cute man.
Very beautiful song and sweet video.
Who shoots on VHS anymore?
